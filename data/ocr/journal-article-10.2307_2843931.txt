<plain_text><page sequence="1">443 SOME ROCK-PAINTINGS IN CENTRAL TANGANYIKA. [WITH PLATES XLVIII-LIV.] By A. T. CULWICK. DURING the latter part of the last century two important discoveries of ancient art were made. One was in Europe, where the marvels of Palheolithic art were brought to light, and the other was in South Africa, where the so-called Bushman paintings were discovered. Since that time our knowledge of early art has grown considerably, and further discoveries have rewarded the investigator not only in Europe, but also in Africa. It is to some of these latter discoveries that I wish to draw attention. Attempts have been made to establish a connection between the European art of prehistoric times and that of South Africa. Struck by similarities of style in paintings separated by such an immense distance, some have thought that in due course discoveries would be made in Central Africa linking up the art of the north with that of the south. Many paintings are now known to exist in this central area and some of them may link up with north and south as expected. Others, on the contrary, far from helping to solve the old problems connected with the subject, merely add new ones. Rock-paintings have been found which fit in neither with the early art of the north nor with that of the south. Such are some of the paintings of the Central Province of Tanganyika Territory, for example, some of those discovered near Kondoa-Irangi by Dr. T. A. M. Nash in 19291 and those found at Bahi in the same year. The Bahi paintings2 occur at three sites within a few miles of one another. They are executed in a white pigment on the concave surfaces of overhanging boulders. The objects depicted include human figures, cattle, stools, a hoe, gourds, an arrow, a bird, bangles and possibly a native churn. Some of the anthropomorphic figures have horns attached to their heads, while one of them wears the typical Masai head-dress with his hair in a pigtail. There is one single red painting at one of these three sites in the form of a large figure of 8. According to native legend, these white paintings were executed by the Wamia before the Wagogo, who now occupy the country, came to Bahi, and were used ritually by their painters. The Wamia are supposed to have drawn these designs at funeral ceremonies and on other import- ant occasions, and it is interesting that the Wagogo have carried on the ritual to the present day although they do not fully understand the original significance of the paintings. They regard the sites as sacred and gather there for their rain-making ceremonies. Part of the ritual consists in brushing over the old designs of the Wamia with melted fat from a sacrificial animal, after which the design is screened with boughs. Paintings which have recently been treated thus have a waxy appearance, but in time the fat decomposes leaving a white deposit. 1 Journ. Roy. Anthrop.

A rough idea of the age of these paintings can be obtained by a study of the genealogy of the present chief of Bahi, which shows that his ancestor Kimanchambogo came to Bahi some 250 years ago and found the Wamia in possession of the country. Unfortunately it was impossible to make any excavations at these sites for fear of causing offence to the tribesmen. The districts of the Central Province in which so far paintings are known to exist are Kondoa- Irangi, where besides Dr. Nash's, there are reported to be many other sites; Dodoma, i.e. the Bahi series; and Singida and Mkalama in the north-west, where red paintings have been found. These districts are all on the central plateau of Tanganyika Territory. The rainfall is very small and there is a long dry season, so that for the greater part of the year the countryside looks parched and dead, open sandy spaces alternating with areas of dense thornbush. Enormous granite masses are a characteristic feature of the landscape, consisting of huge boulders piled up one on top of another and reaching in some cases to a great height. The paintings are found in shelters formed by these boulders. It has been known for some little time that paintings exist on the Iramba Plateau in MIkalama District and at Ilongero in Singida District, the sites being some 60 miles apart. The paintings are very similar and consist in both cases of an eland and two other animal figures. They are identical in style and pigment with those at Dindima's, which are described fully below. At the site on the Iramba Plateau they are on the exposed face of an enormous rock, about 100 yards from a spring, and are rapidly being destroyed by the Waniramba, who chip off pieces to use as charms. We had no opportunity to explore the vicinity for shelters or to dig near the paintings. Ilongero, the second site, is about 16 miles north-east of Singida Station in a large stretch of flat open country, which is marshy grass-land in the rainy season and bare sand in the dry, when water is obtainable only at a very few places. Here the paintings are on the concave surface of an overhanging boulder which is one of a large group of rocks. The shelter, P1. XLVIII, Fig. 1, overlooks a permanent water-hole and faces south-west. Since the prevailing wind comes from the north-east, the paintings are protected from the weather and are fairly well preserved. No other paintings in the neighbourhood were known to the natives, in spite of the fact that in the course of herding their cattle they wander round most of the rocks. But a certain hill upon which no one might venture seemed to have possibilities, especially as there was said to be a great cave near the top of it. This hill, which is shown on the right in P1. XLVIII, Fig. 2, is part of a rocky escarpment running along the eastern side of the flat stretch of country round Ilongero, and is not more than 5 miles south-west of Ilongero. With great reluctance the local chief, Dindima, wbo lives at the b)ottom of the escarpment, consented to lead the way up this hill. In the ordinary course of events not one of his people dared set foot on it for fear of a devil who inhabited the cave at the top. But the old man, after consultation with his people, appeared to come to the conclusion that as the Government and the devil were probably on very good terms the venture might be made under Government protection ! Upon receiving an assurance that we could and would deal with the devil should he be met, Dindima, accom- panied by a crowd of excited and voluble followers, set forth up the hill. The cave at the top was of no interest, a big bare shelter washed out by rain, but half-way up the hill on the eastern</page><page sequence="3">A. T. CULWICK. -SOMe Rock-paintings in Central Tanganyika. 445 side there was a large overhanging rock whose surface to the extent of an area some 70 feet long by 9 feet broad was covered with red paintings. The obvious amazement of the natives showed that, though they lived close by at the bottom of the escarpment, they did indeed know nothing of the paintings which were so near at hand. The only thing Dindima knew of the hill was that, although none of his people might climb it on account of the devil, some of the Masai used to come or, it may be, had once come-to sacrifice there. The paintings are executed in a red pigment with a matt surface, and the colour stands out more clearly when wet than when dry. It was unfortunately impossible to obtain any photo- graphs of them, for they were on a dark background. Brilliant negatives were obtained of the rock surface but the figures did not appear, as the pigment and the rock were almost equal in their power of reflecting the actinic portion of the spectrum. Tracing was also found to be impracticable, on account of the faintness of much of the colour, of the roughness of the rock surface and of the position of the paintings. The only method of reproducing them accurately, therefore, was to draw them to scale. By drawing a pencil datum line across the painting and measuring offsets, it was possible to plot the necessary points of the outline on graph paper. When the outline had been drawn in, it was carefully compared with the original and check measurements were taken. In reproducing the paintings, no attempt has been made to recon- struct those which have been damaged. (P1. L-LIV.)1 At this site there are line drawings, figures in plain colour, and two examples which seem to be a combination of both techniques, as they are filled in with colour but yet the outline (or part of it) is darker than the rest. AVith regard to chronological sequence the evidence is as follows. In the first place, in P1. L, Fig. 2, figures in plain colour (a and c) have been painted over a line drawing (b), and all the evidence of the state of preservation points to the line drawings as the oldest series. In the second place, both the paintings with a dark outline are partially covered by other paintings in plain colour, in the one case, P1. LI, Fig. 2 (a), the top of the head being hidden, and in the other, P1. L, Fig. 1 (a), the bottom of one of the forelegs. Thus we have the line drawings as the earliest series, the paintings in plain colour as the most recent, while those with a dark outline occupy an intermediate position. No complete line drawing of an animal remains, the best fragment being shown in P1. L, Fig. 2 (b). Nevertheless, at one time large numbers of them must have existed, for one particular area of the rock face is covered with fragments of them, frequently recognizable as different parts of animals, while the rest has been obliterated by weathering or blackening due to smoke or by the superposition of later paintings. The style is the vigorous one of an artist who worked without hesitation and with a perfect knowledge of the effect which each line would create. Nowhere is there any trace of uncertainty, such as wavering or broken lines; each appears to have been made with a single bold sweep of the " brush." Apart from the remains of animal figures, there is one almost complete line drawing, P1. LIV, Fig. 2, lower part, which may possibly represent a game-trap, the animal being killed by the I NOTE ON PLATES L-LIV.-In these plates selected paintings have been grouped together for con- venience of publication. Except in the case of the superimposed figures the groupings are artificial. In situ the figures do not occur in any obvious association with each other.</page><page sequence="4">446 A. T. CULWICK.-Sone Rock-paintings in Central Tanganyika. fall of the block suspended at the top. The design immediately above this is puzzling. It should be noted that in each case a small part of the drawing is discoloured and the pigment has turned to a dull, distinctly bluish tinge. Besides these drawings there are many disconnected lines among the paintings. One meanders across many feet of the rock, through paintings as in P1. LIII, Fig. 2 (c), and finally ends as shown in P1. LIII, Fig. 1 (h). The bean-like object beside it was probably originally oval as the nick in it seems to have been made by a piece of the rock breaking away. Other line designs appear in P1. LI, Fig. 1, and P1. LII, Fig. 2. In discussing the characteristics of the paintings, the two later series can be grouped together, for, except for the fact that one has a dark outline, they are exactly similar in style. The figures in better preservation occur in two groups, one on the left of the rock and the other on the right, the centre being blackened by smoke and covered with blurred traces of pigment. The most frequently portrayed animal is the giraffe, of which seven occur near together towards the right-hand side of the rock, besides other scattered examples. P1. L, Fig. 1, shows two typical specimens, and P1. LIII, Fig. 1 (e), a particularly clear head taken from one of the other figures. The attitudes are life-like, and little details such as the curves of shoulders and hocks lend a finished appearance to the picture. A notable exception is seen in P1. LI, Fig. 1, which shows an awkward, wooden-looking creature, quite unable to stand comparison with the rest of its kind. There appears to have been a difference of opinion among the artists who painted these series as to the best method of portraying ears and horns in silhouette, some having decided to include both ears and both horns at all costs. Some of the figures, too, are drawn in awkward attitudes in order to show all four legs in the silhouette. The eland in P1. LII, Fig. 1 (a), is a good example of this. A strikingly fine picture is that of a leopard in P1. LII, Fig. 2 (c). Itis full of life. The curve of the back, the arch of the neck and the nose thrust forward to scent the prey show that the artist watched his model with care and knew how to convey his impressions. Another life- like touch is the curve in the trunk of the small elephant in P1. LIII, Fig. 1 (c), and the same plate, Fig. 1 (k), shows a hyena jumping in a stiff, but not altogether unrealistic manner. Another example of a moving animal is shown in P1. LI, Fig. 2 (b), a picture of an animal charging. It may be a rhinoceros, but the outline of the head is unfortunately very hazy. In spite of being damaged this picture is still remarkably realistic. The head well down, the arched back and the tail stiff out behind give it movement and speak well for the artist's power of interpretation. P1. LII, Fig. 2, is interesting at least as far as the older and fainter figure (a) is concerned, for it represents an elephant upside down.' It was either painted by an inferior artist or else the effort of inverting it proved too great, for the drawing is very poor. It may be noted here that another picture of an inverted animal has been found at the site at Singida itself; it will be described later. It is not easy without considerable practice to paint a good picture of an animal upside down, and one would think that unless there were some special reason for choosing that particular position the artist would have kept to the more usual one. There is no possibility of the picture having been painted from above as there are no ledges on the face of the boulder, which rises to a great height above the paintings. But it may be that he wanted to paint an 1 Cf. G. W. Stow and D. F. Bleek, Rock-paintings in South Africa, pl. 30.</page><page sequence="5">A. T. CULWICK.-Some Rock-paintings in Central Tanganyika. 447 elephant as he would wish to see it-dead. Now the side-view silhouette of a dead elephant would not make a very striking picture nor one very easily recognizable. A " bird's-eye " view, on the other hand, would not be distinguishable from an ordinary picture of the animal when alive and standing up, unless it were inverted. It therefore seems possible that this picture represents a conventional method of depicting a dead animal.1 The pictures of animals described above are all side-view silhouettes, but at the extreme right of the rock are paintings of the heads only of three animals drawn full face, P1. LIII, Fig. 1 (d). P1. LIII, Fig. 2 (b), is a rather curious picture of a tree, including even the roots. It does not strike one as a very realistic drawing and it is difficult to see what species it is intended to represent. The animal close by has been badly damaged. Under the body of one of the giraffes a mlost interesting mark may be seen. It is 21- inches long and 14 inches broad and consists of eight lines divided from one another by equal spaces, each line being roughly 0 07 inch wide and each space 0 a 14 inch. Towards the bottom, the mark tapers and the lines tend to converge. The closeness and fineness of these lines and the way in which they converge suggest that the mark was made by some form of brush. Traces of a similar mark are easily discernible on the shoulder of one of the giraffes. From the marks, the brush would appear to have been a stiff one and may possibly have been made by beating out the end of a stick, the method employed by the natives of the present day when making a tooth-brush. The pigment applied with this brush was of a penetrating nature, and in places has permanently stained the rock to a depth of a tenth of an inch. It is possible that this pig- ment consisted of a mixture of melted fat and red ochre, two easily obtainable substances which would have had a most penetrating effect especially when applied with a stiff brush. At Singida itself, about 12 miles from the paintings described above, some interesting frag- ments of paintings were found. Round a permanent spring of fresh water are scattered some large boulders, much weather-beaten, in many cases whole sides having fallen off and buried their original outer surfaces in the ground. However, on two of these boulders we found frag- ments of pictures of particular interest. On a blackened, vertical rock face are part of an animal upside down and three fragments which may be the remains of a giraffe. There is what seems to be part of its head and neck, a trace of a foreleg, and of the hind quarters. The top of its head is not only coloured but cut into the rock, the painting at that point being slightly recessed. The legs of the inverted animal are also recessed to a depth of about three-sixteenths of an inch. The pigmented surfaces of these legs and of the head of the giraffe are smooth compared with the pitted surface of the rock all round, and in the latter case the edge dividing the rough from the smooth is quite distinct, while in the former there is not such a clear division, the edges of the recessed area being some- what worn. These recesses are completely filled in with colour, so that their edges form the outline of the animal's legs. About a hundred yards from these pictures stands a huge rounded boulder, on whose weather- beaten surface occurs the most interesting picture of the set. Situated as it is in a completely unprotected position on the top of a boulder, it has been much damaged in the course of time, I G. W. Stow and D. F. Bleek, op. cit., pl. 37, depicts figures of slain Basuto upside down.-[Ed.] VOL. LXI. 2F</page><page sequence="6">448 A. T. CULWICK.-Some Rock-paintings in Central Tanganyika. and, unfortunately, our work there drew attention to it so that other people, perhaps from some kraals close by, must have visited it after our departure, for when we returned some months later we found to our intense disappointment that some of it had been broken away. The rock is, in any case, so much roughened by the weather and the colouring of the picture is so faint that it is possible to pick it out only at midday, when the sun is well overhead and the irregularities of the rock cast no shadows. But when first found it was certainly recognizable as part of an elephant, while now the upper part is practically destroyed, though the legs remain. In P1. LIV, Fig. 1, the artist has used the natural features of the rock with the greatest ingenuity. The top of the boulder is in the main grey, but in some places pink granite comes to the surface. The diagrammatic cross-section in Text-fig. 1 makes the technique clearer than any description in words. The artist has made use of the pink granite where possible, removing part of the rock's surface to expose the colour required, and laying on red pigment to fill in those parts of the picture where he was unable to make the granite serve his purpose. For the foreleg, the grey granite has been removed leaving a smooth pink granite surface; for its hind leg, where the pink granite comes to the surface but evidently spread too far towards the front leg, the superfluous pink has been removed till the desired outline was achieved. Thus, while both legs are in the pink granite, the foreleg is recessed, while the hind leg is slightly embossed as FIG. 1.-DIAGRAMMATIC CROSS-SECTION OF ELEPHANT' S LEGS. (A, GREY; B, RED.) regards one edge and level with the surface of the boulder as regards the other. Further, at one point along the outline of the animal's back, the pink granite runs off the picture, extending considerably further than required, and it seems that an attempt has been made to expose the grey as in the case of the hind leg, but without the same success. A groove a quarter of an inch deep has been cut a little way along the animal's back, but the pink granite is too deep for removal at this point, so the groove has been left as part of the outline and red pigment laid heavily along the inner margin of it to make the outline more definite. These pictures at Singida certainly display considerable ingenuity. What little is left of them, however, does not suggest that they were particularly life-like or pleasing to the eye, but rather crude and stiff as compared with the realistic paintings at the sites already described. After considering the paintings themselves, the question naturally arises: "What is associated with them ? " and the answer to that question. is by no means clear. In place of any recognizable industries, strange collections of granite were found. No one of the granite objects, taken by itself, would have attracted attention, but the eye was struck by the fact that the same shape turned up over and over again. The next and obvious step was to see if these shapes were to be found lying about round the rocks and in the open, but though in the course of many walks we looked out for them, we were unable to pick up objects comparable</page><page sequence="7">A. T. CULWICK.-Some Rock-paintings in Central Tanganyika. 449 with those in the shelters. Often a likely stone would be seen, only, when turned over, to prove (Iiite different on the under side, probably not flat at all. Yet, under the large panel of rock- paintings at Dindima's, in a cave near the Singida paintings which on excavation revealed evidence of human occupation, in a small shelter close by the paintings at Singida, in two small shelters at Kititimu not more than a couple of miles from these paintings, the shapes recurred not singly but in dozens. Taking this into consideration, it is not so easy to ignore them. It is hard to assign a use to many of them, and it is impossible to say with certainty whether or not they were shaped by man. But even if one concludes that their formation is natuxal, one is driven to the belief that for some reason collections were made of stones of these particular shapes-and considering the difficulty we experienced in finding any lying about, the task of collecting them must have been fairly laborious. Before I deal with the series of objects themselves, I should mention a find made at Ilongero because it bears on the suggestion that collections of stones were made. The shelter in which the paintings occur at this site has a floor of bare rock, but about a quarter of a mile away is a fairly large cave which at first sight seemed a most promising proposition. Unfortunately, however, it had proved useful to other people before us, namely, to the Wanyaturu in the days of the Masai raids, when it had served them as a refuge. They had blocked up most of the entrance with boulders and had thoroughly disturbed the loose soil lying on its floor, for the ashes of their fires reached right down to the rock. The interior having been thus spoilt, there was yet a chance that something might be obtained by digging just outside the entrance, in a small area between it and the next boulders. There had been fires on the surface, but after the first few inches the soil was undisturbed. Rock was reached at about 3 feet, and resting on this floor were three heaps of granite slabs roughly 18 inches high. One was of slabs of grey granite varying in size from about 4 to 18 inches square, and in thickness from 1 to 2 inches. Some 4 feet from these was a pile of red slabs of similar size, and near by another heap consisting of sharp-edged pieces. It is perhaps superfluous to add the comment that nature does not usually arrange slabs of granite according to their colour and sharpness of edge ! Turning now to the other shelters, the objects found fall into three main classes. P1. XLIX, Fig. 1, shows a representative collection from the first class, whose striking feature is a square end. As these objects were dug up their similarity in this one respect could not but strike the eye. The opposite end varies in shape, occasionally having a sharp edge. The second class is seen in P1. XLIX, Fig. 2, a series mainly of lozenge shapes which were the most frequently occurring of all and often had remarkably straight edges. The larger ones were found at all the sites, while the sheltered cave at Singida alone produced the small ones which, if they ever did exist in the other more exposed shelters, must long ago have been destroyed or swept away by water during the rains. Some of them have one sharp edge; a few others appear to be only partly formed, for three edges of the lozenge are complete, but the fourth only extends half-way through the thick- ness of the slab. The third main class of objects is best described by reference to P1. XLIX, Figs. 3 and 4. They are all asymmetrical with a shoulder on one side and a kind of tang. The edge on the same side as the shoulder is quite often sharp, and some are large enough to be held conveniently in the hand. 2 F 2</page><page sequence="8">450 A. T. CULWICK.-Some Rock-paintings in Central Tanganyika. In addition to these three series, a few dolerite hammerstones were found, and at Dindima's, in country where to the best of my knowledge no flinty rocks exist, a flaked piece of chert, beak- like in shape, was dug up along with two other small pieces of chert. Two grooved stones were also found, one at Dindima's and one at the Singida home-site. The former is made of a greenish schist, sharp-edged at one end and tapering to a point at the other, with a well-worn groove a little broader than a lead pencil running down the centre. The Singida specimen has a deep groove triangular in cross-section. It was found along with another piece of the same rock FIG. 2.-GRANITE, IMPLEMENT (x 4). which was sent to the Geological Survey at Dodoma for identification. It proved to be a fresh olivine basalt, a fact of considerable interest, as the nearest known source of supply is 50 or 60 miles from the cave. Text-figs. 2 and 3 show two rather interesting finds. The first was in a small shelter close by the exposed paintings at Singida. It is a triangular slab of granite with a screw-driver edge of felspar crystal at one apex. The edge shows signs of considerable wear, and some such tool would certainly have been suitable for pecking away the weathered surface of the boulders, as FIG. 3.-GRANITE IMPLEMENT (X X). has been done in the paintings at this site. The second is a somewhat similar object found at Dindima's. It, too, is a triangular piece of granite with a felspar crystal exposed at one apex, but in this case the block is much thicker, a fact which would prevent its use as a pecking tool. By merely reducing the thickness of the block, however, it would be possible to produce an object identical with that found at Singida. The sites at which these things were found were, with the exception of a dry sheltered cave at Singida, rather open shelters among the piles of granite boulders which are strewn about the country, shelters formed sometimes by a slightly overhanging boulder, sometimes by two or</page><page sequence="9">A. T. CULWICK.-Some Rock-paintings in Central Tanganyika. 451 more boulders leaning up against one another. There was usually a certain amount of soil on the irregular floor, and, on account of the flow of water after storms, the granite objects tended to be concentrated in pockets between the boulders forming the floor or in other nooks and crannies at the sides of the shelters. In the small shelter close by the paintings at Singida there is a deep narrow cleft between the boulder forming one side anid the boulder forming the back of the shelter (P1. XLVIII, Fig. 3). Very little dust had collected in it, and the granite objects were simply lying between the rocks. The larger lozenge shapes were especially common here. At Dindima's the shelter is formed by the overhang of the great rock on which the paintings occur. It is quite open to rain from the east or south-east. The depth of soil on the floor averaged about 2 feet, but as the rocks under the soil were very irregular the depth was not at all constant. The granite shapes, among which the square-ended pieces were very prominent at this site (P1. XLIX, Fig. 1), came from near the bottom of a pocket between the rocks of thefloor at theleft- hand side of the shelter, while the grooved piece of schist and the chert flakes were above them. Along with the granite objects was found a piece of bone on which a flat surface appeared to have been roughly cut. Further towards the right-hand side of the shelter, after removing some inches of soil, we found we were digging out wood ash and charcoal. This continued for about 2 feet till we reached the rock floor on which lay one piece of iron slag. There was, however, no trace of a fumace. The presence of the iron slag and the enormous accumulation of ash shows that iron was at one time smelted at this site. It must have been at a period subsequent to the painting of the pictures, for the smoke has blackened the centre of the overhanging rock and partially obscured a large number of paintings. The present tribe, the Alimi, who have occupied the country for some 100-150 years, are not iron-smelters, but have always bought their iron from Unyamwezi, and, as previously mentioned, they are afraid to set foot on this hill. Every site so far examined had been exposed to the action of water during the rains or had been recently disturbed, but after some search among the granite masses near the different paintings, a dry cave undisturbed by any recent occupation was discovered among some rocks on the west shore of Lake Singida. A view of these rocks is given in P1. XLVIII, Fig. 4, with someone standing at the foot of them to give an idea of their size. The cave is about 30 feet above the lake level, and can be reached either from above or below, neither entrance being very easy to negotiate. There are a number of ledges, some open, others sheltered, with a low inner cave, the whole forming quite a " desirable cave residence." After the inner cave had been dug out, a man could just sit upright; before, it was only possible to wriggle in on one's stomach. It is perhaps 20 feet wide and varies from 4 to 8 feet deep, and was filled -up with dust to a depth of between 2 and 3 feet, very fine wind-blown dust, light enough to have been carried across three-quarters of a mile of water, for the lake is on the open windward side of the cave. It would therefore appear that the cave had been some little time in filling. The floor when exposed proved to be of one boulder, slightly lower towards the left of the cave, forming there a depression about 6 feet in diameter. At the back left-hand corner there was a small opening leading out into a narrow passage between two huge boulders, where, it may be noted in passing, a hammerstone was found. As the prevailing wind blew in at the front of the cave, this opening formed a natural chimney. It was not altogether surprising, therefore, to find a</page><page sequence="10">452 A. T. CULWICK. -Some Rock-paintings in Central Tanganyika. hearth of big stones in close proximity to this chimney. The hearth, in the middle of the depres- sion in the floor, was covered by over 2 feet of earth and was separated from the rock floor by a few inches of black mud, only found at this side of the cave where the floor drops. Nothing was found in the upper part of the earth in the cave, nearly everything lying in close proximity to the hearth, either in the last few inches of earth removed or actually in the black mud, which also contained many decomposed fragments of granite which fell to pieces on removal. The smaller and more fragile kiinds of lozenge shapes were only found in this undisturbed and well protected spot, from which also came the grooved piece of olivine basalt. A few small pieces of charcoal were found in the hearth, together with fragments of animal bones, chiefly remains of teeth, which from their condition appeared to be of considerable age. Mr. A. T. Hopwood, of the British Museum, has kindly examined them. He states that some of them belong to a gazelle, while others are the " teeth of a large bovine animal, most probably some species of antelope." This latter beast must have been cut up before being brought into the cave as the entrance is too small to admit a large animal. This fact, together with the proximity of the teeth to the hearth, suggests that the animal was used as food. There was also a small piece of bone with lines on it which at first sight seemed like the marks of a rodent's teeth, but as they do not always go in pairs it is doubtful if they can be so explained. We have seen that the excavations round Singida have provided us with three classes of finds: (1) the remains of animals which appear to have been used as food; (2) a few artefacts; and (3) the granite shapes. The presence of the first two requires no explanation, but it is extremely difficult to account for the occurrence of the granite shapes at these sites. Two views are possible-either they arrived there as the result of natural causes, or they were placed there by man. It seems impossible to think of any use to which these shapes could have been put, and for this reason one is tempted to adopt the theory of their natural occurrence at the sites. This theory, however, immediately leads us into difficulties. If we hold to it, we must explain by what natural means stones of certain shapes have been gathered together in large numbers within areas of a few square feet, while outside those areas they are so rare that diligent search has failed to reveal a single specimen. Also we must explain how nature has managed to grade rock by its colour, forming the neatly stacked piles of pink and grey granite which were found at Ilongero. Taking this into consideration, it seems impossible that these granite objects are of natural occurrence at the sites, and this being so, we are forced to the alternative theory that they were placed there by man. The further question then arises "Are they artefacts, or were they merely collected? Granite is a highly heterogeneous crystalline rock, and it is therefore impossible in most cases to determine whether a given fragment has been detached from a block by natural agents or not. Granite exhibits no flake scars, and therefore the human origin of a given specimen is extremely difficult to demonstrate. We must assume, however, that the piles of irregular slabs at Ilongero were placed there for some purpose, and they may have been a store or raw material for the fashioning of the granite shapes. Again, the partially formed shapes may represent the unfinished product, though it is equally possible that they have been formed</page><page sequence="11">A. T. CULWICK.-Some Rock-paintings in Central Tanganyikc. 453 naturally. Altogether, the evidence of human workmanship is extremely scanty, and though we must assume that the granite shapes were placed at the sites by man, their origin must remain an open question. There is nothing to show whether they were made or merely collected. The excavations in. Singida district were originally started at the sites where the paintings are to be found and were later extended to other shelters. The granite shapes were found at two sites where the paintings occur, and the piles of granite slabs were only a few hundred yards away from the pictures at Ilongero. This raises the question whether there is any connection between the two. At present it is impossible to say whether the granite shapes occur in shelters outside the immediate vicinity of the paintings. There are in the district a vast number of rock shelters scattered over a large area, and of these only a few have so far been examined. No granite shapes, however, have yet been found in shelters far removed from the paintings. Turning now to the question of the relationship of the paintings in the Central Province of Tanganyika Territory to other known examples of prehistoric art, it must be borne in mind that these paintings cannot be placed in one group. The white paintings at Bahi stand by them- selves and have been proved to be comparatively modern; but even leaving these aside and confining our attention to the red figures we are forced to distinguish between several distinct styles. The paintings at Dindima's, Ilongero and the Iramba Plateau represent one style, the semi-engraved figures at Singida another, while the illustrations published by Dr. T. A. M. Nash represent at least two more schools of art. All these styles differ from one another considerably in conception as well as in technique.' There are, however, known to be many sites where rock-paintings exist in Usandawi in the eastern part of the province, of which, so far as I have been able to discover, no descriptions have yet been published. It is possible, therefore, that evidence will in due course be obtained from them to elucidate the problem of the relationship of the different styles to one another and to. cave art in other places. [ In the discussion which followed the reading of this paper attention was drawn by Mr. M. C. Burkitt and myself to the close resemblance, both in style and technique, between many of the Ilongero paintings and those of Rhodesia and South Africa, presumed to be of Bushman origin.-ED.]</page><page sequence="12">o 1 S i _ - . . i . i; i~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~N - 1 1 0 FIG. 1.-ROCK-SHELTER WITH PAINTINGS, AT ILONGERO, NEAR SINGIDA.
