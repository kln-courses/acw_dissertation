When the holiday was over Smith stayed on in Cornwall, despatched the family back to London and turning his back on the sea moved to St Columb Major, a small village about three miles inland where, he wrote, 'I painted Cornish landscapes' (see right).2 This was to be his base for the next three to four months where he produced one of the most remarkable series of landscape paintings in the history of English art, a series which have become known as the Cornish landscapes.3 In examining these twenty or so paintings I hope to show that Smith's experience of war emerges as the dominant theme of the works and that the violently experimental manner of their execution belies starkly the traditional theme of their subject-matter. The Cornish landscapes form a kind of major coda to the first period of development in Smith's oeuvre which began shortly after he left the Slade School of Fine Art and moved to France in 1908.4 By 1910 he was living and working in Paris and was, albeit briefly, enrolled at Matisse's school where he saw the master teach on at least three occasions. As his early work shows Smith absorbed lessons from the work of the Fauves and the Nabis which he could see around Paris at this time.5 In 1912-13 Smith assimilated some fauve technique into his practice and these techniques enabled him to make the kind of progress as a painter which had been hindered by his time at the Slade School of Art. The strong colour and childlike or primitive qualities which had earned the movement its name were precisely those qualities which attracted Smith, at least in part because he knew that his former teacher, Henry Tonks would disapprove.6 Another important factor is Smith's meeting with the expatriate Irish painter Roderic O'Conor in Paris, late in 1918.7 The two artists became close friends and O'Conor's personal knowledge of recent developments in French painting and in particular his understanding of the work of Gauguin, as well as O'Conor's own work, played a significant role in the evolution of Smith's personal style.8 These influences have been covered in much of the literature on Smith.9 In this essay I want to focus on that aspect of the Cornish landscapes which reflects Smith's experience of modern life and in particular his experiences through the First World War.10 The war years separate the Cornish landscapes from those Fauve-inspired paintings which Smith had produced around 1913. My contention is that Smith's suffering during his active service in the war had powerfully affected his mind and that experience imposed itself upon his vision in these immediate post-war works. With the benefit of hindsight, John Rothenstein recognised this when he stated, with their black oppressive skies and trance-livid fields, roads and trees, (they) were the products of a darkening mind, a mind engaged in a losing struggle to maintain its equilibrium.11 Smith himself later strenuously maintained that they were merely a straightforward description of the thing seen. He told John Russell that even the reddest and most apparently anti-naturalistic of his Cornish landscapes were on the contrary a faithful representation of the conditions created by an unusually wet Summer and Autumn.12 There may have been a number of reasons for this denial but if we accept it as an honest one we would need to conclude that the powerful sense of gloom evoked by these works must have been largely subconscious. With the benefit of subsequent advances in psychoanalysis we can perhaps now better understand this kind of denial, which only serves to reinforce the strength and depth of feeling inherent in this series of paintings.13 Alice Keene in The Two Mr. Smiths provides an account of Smith's army career.14 It began in November 1916 when, having been declared unfit for regular soldiering, he was mobilised into the Inns of Court Officer Training Corps. On 9 March 1917 he was commissioned temporary second lieutenant and attached to the No. 25 Labour Company, Royal West Surrey Regiment and almost immediately despatched to Boulogne where he was put in charge of about a hundred men involved in clearing up battlefields newly won by the French. In a letter to his sister Phyliss Smith dated May 27 1917 Smith sensitive as ever to his readers sensibilities describes his duties as rather interesting. . . you can imagine we see a good deal. . . in one little place today we found 1200 boxes of Mills bombs. . . of course we find stacks of helmets, British and Bosche, and many other things, some of them not too pleasant to come upon.15 By June of that year Smith's company was attached to the 5th army at Ypres and a month later he was transferred to No. 133 Labour Company. Passchendaele began on the last day of July and Smith was at that time probably in charge of the burial of the German dead. He was later deployed in laying track east of the Yser canal. Keene continues, Their position was very exposed, subject to heavy shelling and gas attacks. They suffered casualties by day as they worked and by night as well, since the men were not fit enough to march and had to sleep in the open. On 13 September Matthew was slightly wounded but carried on working. Then on the 26th he was felled with a severe shrapnel wound in the thigh.16 97</page><page sequence="2">The BRITISH ART Journal Volume iy No. 1 1 Cornish Landscape with monkey puzzle.

Oil on canvas, 53. 3 x 64.2 cm. Tate Britain Smith was hospitalised initially in the Red Cross hospital at Rouen where a large piece of shrapnel was removed from his leg and within the week was in a hospital in London.17 These war experiences were to have a lasting influence on his work as a painter even beyond the Cornish landscapes. The immediate effect was to produce in Smith the determination to make the most of the rest of his life. Having been spared on this occasion his reaction was to take hold of 'life beautiful life' and strive to enjoy it to the full.18 These feelings become apparent in Smith's mature work after 1924, in which the two extremes of sensuality and the anxiety and pain of modern life combine. In the Cornish landscapes produced so soon after the war the effects of pain and suffering are uppermost in the expressive distortions of colour which Smith unconsciously or otherwise imposes on the motif. The normal healing effects of nature and the implied moral goodness which contemplation of the country side usually promotes are absent. What is powerfully evident on the other hand is the pained and demoralised psyche of the artist. Smith's palette changes dramatically almost immediately after the war. In the still-lifes and portraits he produced in London in 1919-20 he is beginning to make use of the dark reds and crimson, viridian green, black and prussian blue which feature throughout the Cornish landscapes.19 This dark palette replaces the primaries of the early fauve works. Smith would have taken time to assimilate the Cornish countryside, acquiring a bicycle and exploring the neighbourhood in search of suitable motifs. He strongly disapproved of those artists who could go outside, plant an easel in the ground and start work straight away. He was also exceptionally shy of attention when working and the earlier works were almost certainly painted from the windows of his lodgings.20 Cornish landscape with monkey puzzle (PI 1), Steeple in Cornwall (PI 2), Red landscape, St Columb , and Cornish Church (PI 3) can therefore be considered amongst the first works in the series.21 In these paintings the dark experimental palette outlined above is immediately apparent. The paint is generally applied relatively thinly without the use of white, any luminosity being achieved by the transparent colour applied in generous oil colour washes over a white primer.22 The skies are often painted dark blue, purple or black which creates an oppressive sense of gloom. The 'disharmonies' of colour in these paintings have a bitter, astringent quality which make them unrestful to the viewer.23 In Cornish landscape with monkey puzzle (PI 1) the trees are portrayed as thin red stalks which run down the composition like veins or rivulets of blood. The thin blasted shape of the monkey puzzle tree itself is a comic mockery of a tree. The normative view of nature as having the power to heal is negated in these works. The sky is an unrelieved 98</page><page sequence="3">Volume iy No. 1 The BRITISH ART Journal Prussian blue laid on with vertical stabs of the brush, increasing the heavy sense of oppression on the few small signs of habitation in the middle distance. The overall impact is claustrophobic and foreboding. Gauguinesque crimson pinks are used to describe foreground buildings which are painted in flat geometric forms contrasting with the cloisonnist rendering of the natural landscape beyond. The critic David Piper stated, The Cornish landscapes of this period, painted apparently through a phase of doubt and distress, stand still supreme for some of his admirers in his work; haunting with an authentic stifling claustrophobia though they are, they seem to me less satisfying, perhaps because in them can be felt precisely too much control in design, a stringent reigning-in for fear of running amok.24 Despite the criticism Piper here levelled at the works he was clearly aware of the claustrophobic and almost apocalyptic force of these images. Piper seems to be responding to an explicit sense of control which could only be inevitable, given the nervous crisis which Smith was facing. The 'stringent reigning- in' merely adds to that powerful feeling of claustrophobia in the paintings, and one factor which contributes to a sense of control in the design is the drawing. Unusually for Smith, who in his later practice would usually enter straight into the painting, there are a number of preparatory drawings for the Cornish landscapes and the underlying structure of the works in terms of drawing is stricdy faithful to the motif portrayed. Cornish Church (PI 3) is, like every one of the Cornish landscapes vacant and unpopulated, and shows a crimson and indigo building, with a black window like an eye revealing a voided mind ( as it were) against a flat and emphatically black sky. As in many of the works there is a path which meanders into the space of the painting, reminiscent perhaps of wartime lines of safety through minefields and seeming to lead from nowhere to nowhere. The obtuse and unreadable geometry of the frame of the window at the left of the composition extends into the blackness but only deepens the gloom, providing no comfort. It is a vision of a depopulated, cold and unwelcoming post-war world. In the Cornish landscapes there are almost always signs of human presence: gates and tracks; buildings and roads; but they are always devoid of human figures, a device which further emphasises the oppressive presence of the artist's shell-shocked psyche. Cornish landscape: the orange road , (PI 4), The wet road , A winding road (PI 5) and Cornish Landscape (PI 6) all portray narrow empty lanes which lead into the image but seem to fall short of distant, anonymous dwellings. The roads seem insecure against the overwhelmingly oppressive and darkly violent forces of the natural world which threatens them on every side. The 'natural world' in these three works can be read simultaneously as a dense mass of violently expressive brush- marks, especially in Cornish landscape: the orange road , a painting which exemplifies a process of evolution running through the series away from the solid geometry of, for example, Steeple in Cornwall towards a much freer handling of paint, which on occasions borders on gestural abstraction. One of Smith's favourite motifs in Cornwall was an isolated cottage or hut at the edge of a road as in Cornish landscape with cottage (PI 6), Winter landscape, Cornwall (PI 7) or Cornish landscape (No. 7) but with no sign of any habitation. The painter is the only person in the work. In Steeple in Cornwall (PI 2) a wall fills the foreground of the painting.25 Obvious, simple and stark, the wall forms a bulwark against the landscape, almost naturalistic, almost hopeful, yet beyond reach and trammelled in the distance. Smith does not make use of any aerial perspective. The paint 4 Cornish landscape: the orange road. Oil on canvas, 53-3 x 64.7 cm. Private collection 5 A winding road.Cornish landscape.

A sense of distance is created merely by overlapping forms or lines so that the integrity of the picture surface is maintained. In his mature work after 1924 Smith was to go on to develop an essentially premier coup ' or 'alia prima ' method of working in which those elements of technique already evident here would predominate. The application of that technique already to the Cornish work leads to that rawness and stark honesty of execution which, through the manipulation of the substance of the paint, itself suggests the artist's devastating experience of modern life. The facts and the drama of Smith's life are one with the shapes and the coloured stuff of the paint. The modernity of these works is evident through an appreciation of the highly charged process of their creation, rather than simply through a reading of their iconography. Three outstanding paintings from the middle of this period are Cornish landscape (No.l) at one time owned by Jacob Epstein, Cornish landscape (No 5), now at Queensland Art Gallery, Australia,26 and Cornish landscape (No.2), now in the Museum of Modern Art, New York. These three images are very similar in composition and have often been confused by commentators and curators of exhibitions. It would seem that the last was almost certainly painted away from the motif, transcribed from one of the former works, as the emphatically cloisonnist and uncommonly distorted rendering of the forms suggests a greater than usual freedom of execution. These large paintings represent a pinnacle of Smith's achievement at this time.

Smith When left he Cornwall returned to in spend the new Christmas year he with found his he family. was When he returned in the new year he found he was unable to take up the work again.27 The inspiration had passed. He left for France where, having produced no work through 1921, his mental state deteriorated to the point that in March 1922 he admitted himself to the Clinique Valmont in Lausanne for treatment by the psychiatrist Dr Roger Vittoz. It is interesting to compare the Cornish work with a small 9 Landscape near Lyon. Oil on canvas, 46 x 27 cm. Private collection series of landscapes that Smith produced during and shortly after the treatment he received at the clinic.28 The Lyons landscapes from 1922, as in Landscape near Lyons (No. 2), (PI 9) are by contrast with the Cornish landscapes, gentle, decorative and restrained. The colours are higher key and the violence of the premier coup attack has to a great extent ameliorated.29 The great energy in Smith's work was always to be paramount but was never to be quite as dark in tone as that in the Cornish landscapes.30 In this series of paintings Smith achieved a remarkable synthesis of means and expression and of colour and feeling, which represented a considerable deepening of the significance of his work over that which he had produced during his fauvist period prior to the war. It was only after a 100</page><page sequence="5">Volume iy No.l The BRITISH AKT Journal new start in 1923-24 and then through the 1920s that he was able to work out a personal mode of facture which would eventually become the defining Smith style. In 1942 Kenneth Clark wrote that Smith among others could not be included in the War Artists Collection because such 'painters are interested solely in putting down their feelings about shapes and colours, and not in facts, drama and human emotions generally'.31 This may have applied to such painters as Ivon Hitchens and Victor Pasmore but in Smith's case, as my intention has been to show, the drama and the emotional effect of war can be communicated through shape and colour, and the limitations imposed by Clark's dichotomy of form and content hinder a true reading. Smith's Cornish landscapes are his war work. 1 For the details of Smith's life two biographies have been referred to: Alice Keene, The Tivo Mr Smiths , London, 1995, and Malcolm Yorke, Matthew Smith: His Life and Reputation , London, 1997. 2 On a postcard of St Columb which Smith sent to his family. 3 In my catalogue raisonné of the oil paintings I have identified a total of 22 Cornish landscapes and one flower piece from this period. See John Gledhill, A Catalogue Raisonné of the Oil Paintings of Matthew Smith, with a Critical Introduction to his Work, unpublished DPhil thesis, University of York, 2000. Evidence of the lasting strength of these paintings is perhaps shown by the fact that several are now in major public collections. For example, Cornish Church is in the Tate Gallery, London and Cornish landscape (No. 2) is in the Museum of Modern Art, New York. 4 It is interesting to note that while Smith was in Cornwall he passed his 42nd birthday and was yet to produce the main body of his mature work. 5 Smith certainly saw the famous collection of Fauve work at the Steins' apartment and a major Vuillard exhibition at the Bernheim- Jeune gallery in 1912. It was only in France that Smith felt he really began to learn to paint. As he said to John Rothenstein, on his arrival in France, 'My life began; my mind began to open out.' John Rothenstein Modern English Painters, London, 1952, p231. Smith's most overtly Fauve paintings are familiar, notably Dulde 1913-1915 and the Fitzroy Street nudes Nos. 1 and 2 from 1916. Dulcie is now in Southampton City Art Gallery, Fitzroy St. nude No. 1 is in the Tate Gallery and Fitzroy St. nude No. 2 in the British Council collection. 6 Henry Tonks taught drawing at the Slade from 1892 to 1930. According to John Russell, 'Matthew Smith... was one of the best painters to come out of the Slade, and he hated Tonks and everything he stood for. In fact this very hatred may have speeded up his development and forced him to decide, since he was against Tonks, just exactly what he wanted instead.' John Russell, Bryan Robertson &amp; Lord Snowdon, Private View, London, 1965, pl52. 7 Smith was at this time on leave awaiting demobilisation which much to his frustration didn't happen until March 1919. Through the spring and summer of 1919 Smith stayed in France, spending time in Paris where in July he saw the large Courbet and Matisse exhibitions which were held at the Bernheime-Jeune gallery. 8 Smith undoubtedly saw O'Conor's work in his Paris studio. His comment was that O'Conor was 'a Fauve before the Fauves'. The importance of this meeting in view of the Cornish landscapes is not only O'Conor's knowledge of Gauguin and thereby Synthetism, but his philosophy, which Smith had no trouble accepting, that there should be a greater unity between colour and emotion in painting, a factor which both painters would have considered an essentially mysterious matter. 9 The extant literature on Smith is meagre to say the least. Only one monograph was published during Smith's lifetime: Phillip Hendy's Matthew Smith published as part of the Penguin Modern Painters series in 1944. This small book was released following the major two- man exhibition of Smith and Epstein at Temple Newsam, Leeds, in 1942. Two monographs were published in 1962 shortly after his death: Matthew Smith with an introduction by Philip Hendy, published by Allen and Unwin, and a monograph published by the Beaverbrook Press, also entitled Matthew Smith. John Rothenstein included a chapter on Smith in his 3-volume survey of contemporary British Art, Modern English Painters, first published in 1952. The only other significant published material on Smith over the next 40 years, apart from the two biographies already referred to, were two exhibition catalogues; one for the Tate Gallery exhibition in 1953 and the other for an exhibition at the Barbican in 1983. 10 The theme of this article is derived from the critical essay which accompanies my Catalogue Raisonné, in which I argue that Smith's mature work shows a kind of modernism which is evident not in the iconography of the pictures but in the manner of their execution. Briefly, Smith's essentially premier coup method of working leads to the expression of the anxiety of modern life. The stuff of the paint itself forms a kind of narrative of the psychological process of its execution. The modernism of Smith's work is a modernism of the psyche, and of the nervous system of a highly sensitised individual reacting to the stresses of a too rapidly changing and war-torn world. 11 J Rothenstein, Modern English Painters, op cit, p232. 12 John Russell, 'Matthew Smith in France', Apollo, 1962, p372. 13 Even if we were to accept the 'faithful representation' Smith speaks of here the choice of subject remains significant in that it provides an equivalent for the emotional state of the artist at this time, although my argument accepts that there is in fact expressive transformation in the images referred to. 14 Keene, op cit, pp 39-40. 15 Quoted Yorke, op cit, plOl. 16 Keene, op cit, p40. 17 Alice Keene also recognises reference to Smith in the following description from Alden Brooks' Novel The Enchanted Land, (London, 1924): 'They had brought him back with a terrible wound in his side; . . . doubled up like a thing broken in two, half unconscious with pain, ... - his whole life wasted - never known what life was - and now all over, ended, dying. "Here," said the voice, "there's still some chance of saving this fellow; put him on the table." Then to wild spasms of pain as they lifted him into the light, he had to raise himself on one elbow, look around, swear that, if it were true, he would never do anything else in future but live life, to the full, as it should be led.' Alice Keene, 'Extract from a Biographical Study' in Matthew Smith, exh cat, London, Barbican Art Gallery, 1983, p22. 18 Yorke, op cit, pl05. 19 Smith's palette in 1920 consisted predominately of transparent or semi-transparent colours such as Alizarin Crimson, an unidentified transparent yellow referred to by Smith as Venetian Yellow, Viridian Green (Oxide of Chromium), Prussian Blue and Black. 20 Malcom Yorke visited St Columb Major in the process of researching his biography of Smith and managed to locate the room he stayed in. He was able to identify the precise location of a number of the views which Smith painted from the windows of his room. Yorke noted the faithfulness of the drawing to the subject. Yorke, op cit, pill. 21 Titles given for paintings are mainly those which were originally given by Smith. Some, however, are those given in my Catalogue Raisonné where titles have occasionally been altered to distinguish one work from another. 22 This technique led Hendy mistakenly to state that Smith had made use of 'glazes' in these paintings. A glaze is a transparent layer of thin paint, but one that is laid in over another colour, usually to create depth in the shadows. Hendy, op cit, pp 9-11. 23 In his review for the Listener in 1949 Geoffrey Grigson, comparing the Cornish landscapes to Smith's later nudes, described their effect in the following terms: 'Colour met colour with a straight edge, and together they became far more active and melodiously irritant.' G Grigson, "IWo London Art Exhibitions', The Listener, 1 February 1949, p282. 24 David Piper, obituary of Matthew Smith, The Listener, 8 October 1959, p565. 25 As Yorke has pointed out the 'Steeple' in this painting is in fact a decorative filial, a feature of a boundary wall which Smith could see from the window of his room. Yorke, op cit, pill. 26 I have only recently identified a photograph of this image as being slightly but distinctly different to Cornish landscape No. 1. The dimensions of this painting are also different to the other two related images being 28 x 36 inches (71.1 x 91.4 cm), making this painting the largest of the Cornish landscapes. 27 A mystery surrounds Smith departure from Cornwall. He received a telegram from Epstein's first wife Margaret, requesting that he come to the Sculptor's side immediately as he was seriously ill. When Smith arrived at the Epsteins' home he was, however, completely well and working with his usual vigour, a characteristic of his friend which could occasionally intimidate the less than healthy Smith. Smith then immediately left for France. See Francis Halliday and John Russell, 'A Biographical Note' in Matthew Smith, London, 1962, np. 28 Smith had been referred to one of his disciples by Vittoz, a Dr Paul D'Espiney who was based in Lyons. See Keene, op cit, p45. A description of the methods invented by Dr Vittoz for the treatment of neurasthenia can be found in Peter Ackroyd, TS. Eliot, London, 1984. 29 In my Catalogue Raisonné I have located a total of 12 landscapes painted in 1922 at Lyons, most of which are in private collections. One, Landscape near Lyons (No 4) , is in the Government Art Collection. 30 In the 1930s Smith produced a further major series of landscape paintings in and around Aix-en- Provence, beginning with a view of Montagne St Victoire (so often painited by Cézanne), now in a private collection, in 1932. All in all Smith produced a total of more than 100 landscape paintings, contrary to the opinion which still persists that his range was narrow. See, for example, Iain Gale, 'Sir Matthew Smith', The Independent, 21 June 1995. Gale states, 'Apart from a few landscapes, Smith's entire life was spent painting just two subjects: the still-life and the nude.' 31 Kenneth Clark, 'War Artists at the National Gallery', Studio, CXXIII (January 1942), p586. 101</page></plain_text>
