<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Sketch of the History of Science in Georgia By Schuyler Medlock Christian SCIENCE lumbus. We in America have inherited began with much the from Indians, them centuries in Georgia before because Co- lumbus. We have inherited much from them in Georgia because of long and exceptionally friendly contact and because the southern tribes had the highest civilization of their race. DeSoto in 1540 found the southern Indians building and using mounds and Bartram noted a great mound on the Savannah River, with a unique spiral ramp to the top. These mounds were built with fair geometric skill, having circles and right angles accurate within one per cent- and this is not easily attained. The art of the people was well developed, showing strong Central American influence. By 1568, Spanish missionaries on the Georgia coast had written a grammar of the local dialect and translated the catechism into it; and the friars had tried to poor effect to teach the Indians improved trades and agricultural methods. The logical roots of science grow in the language it employs, and the southern tribes spoke effective languages with rich vocabularies, fine distinctions, abundant synonyms, and flexible syntax. Sequoyah's invention of the Cherokee alphabet in 1822 was a fruitless imitation of English letters. Indian lore was "applied" rather than "pure" science, with the logical approach of all primitive people: it was anthropomorphic, superstitious interpretations of sun, moon, clouds, plants, disease, and death. Indians discovered the medical virtues of plants by trial and error, or induction; and they also reasoned deductively, for example, administering fern leaves to straighten rheumatic limbs, since these leaves uncoil as they grow. They knew that two negatives make an affirmative; and if we can depend upon the early trader, Adair, they had the concept of proportionality, saying that swallowing flies would breed worms "in proportion to the number they eat." Though weak in arithmetic, the Cherokees used a decimal system, and formed ordinals from cardinals as we do superlatives, thus: "Sun- day is the onest day, Monday the twoest." The Chickasaw added the superlative ending for multiples of ten, thus: 100 is ten-est, 1000 415</page><page sequence="2">4l6 THE GEORGIA REVIEW is ten-est-est, and so on beyond a million, an exponential system. They recognized indirectly the abstract nature of numbers, reverencing some as sacred: thus the Creek Confederacy had four main towns, built facing four directions, and used four chief medicines. Their astronomy was crude and practical, with a simple calendar; ages and dates they remembered by events such as the great meteor showers. The year was divided into five seasons: budding spring, re- turning-sun time; roasting-ear time; highest-sun time; corn-harvest or leaf-fall; and winter or cohonk, "being the sound of the wild goose." They found directions accurately by the Pole Star, said that comets presage trouble or wars, and agreed that the earth is a flat plane under a solid vault, which opens morning and evening to let the day- sun and night-sun in or out. They said a new moon in a cup-like po- sition holds water and means a dry month, while one turned like a tilted cup means pouring, wet weather. (A Georgia ex-slave repeated this superstition to my mother.) They thought the sun was larger than a house, but very far away, because if it were close it would burn everything up. Their sun-worship is the most reasonable of pagan re- ligions, because of the real importance of that star. Adair relates how during a lunar eclipse the Cherokees "all ran wild, this way and that way, like lunatics, firing their guns, whooping and hallooing, beating of kettles, ringing horse-bells, and making the most horrid noises that human beings possibly could. This was the effect of their natural philosophy, and done to assist the suffering moon." The name Nantahala, "mid-day sun," preserves the observation in that gorge of cliffs so steep that the sun lights their faces only at noon. Buffaloes located the paths of least resistance, which the Indians adopted as their trails; some are still visible, worn as much as six feet deep. Many are so well-placed that we use them for our modern high- ways. Distances were measured by finger-joint, foot paces, and day- marches; the doctors measured medicine in swallows, half-swallows, and drops. Later the mouth became the standard volume for measuring beer: the buyer brought a large-mouthed friend to measure his drink. They used rattles, drums, and flutes for music, and knew the advantage of wedges for tightening knots, and the atlatl or throwing stick. In the Appalachians, they mined mica for mirrors from huge pits, which we still exploit; likewise flint for arrowheads. This mica they traded to Great Lakes tribes for copper, which was hammered into</page><page sequence="3">HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN GEORGIA 417 shape, such as the beautiful Etowah platters. Their pigments were hematite, malachite, white lead carbonate, ocher, coal, kaolin, and soot. They used red clay as a red paint, and roasted it to make a yellow one, their nearest approach to chemistry. Not having salt springs, the Cherokees used ashes or lye as salt; they named as the elements earth, water, air, and fire, as in the Pythagorean system. They named animal species well, including such minor ones as a corn-worm, and distinguished toads from frogs, turtle from terrapin, centipede from millipede. "Of the Mock-bird: The Indians, by way of eminence or admiration, call it Cencontlatolly, or four hundred tongues." Legends indicate that their ancestors saw the mammoth alive here, but this is doubtful. They did some rude embalming, which gave them a direct knowledge of internal anatomy. The Creeks said that the Alli- gator and Turkey clans were closely related, because they both came from eggs, suggesting the evolutionary relationship between reptiles and birds. Bear grease was used in large quantities as nourishment for the hair, for which it is still famous here. Indians ate many kinds of animals, fish, and insects; some covered their fish at night, to prevent putrefac- tion by moonlight. Their agriculture was highly developed, and they planted each crop in the most suitable type of soil, using fish as fertilizer. They killed trees by girdling, and when a field was exhausted moved to a rich new-ground. These bad practices the whites have followed. They grew a large quantity and. variety of corn, beans, passion-flower or Maypop, and gourds, which they used for many purposes, hanging some for nests for martins, to drive owls away. They preserved black- berries, persimmons, and grapes by drying. Nuts were an important winter food, and walnut oil was a favorite flavoring, a carrier for paint pigments, a preservative of wood and leather, a medicine, and a lamp fuel. They made two supreme gifts to civilization, both plants. Tobacco they smoked for ceremony and panacea, not for pleasure. It was taken to England by Sir John Hawkins in 1565, and by 1650 it was used around the world; some whites still hold the Indian belief that tobacco kills germs and stops fatigue . . . Corn was evolved from a Mexican or Guatemalan grass, and the priests were good enough geneticists to maintain four distinct varieties. The Cherokees made a weak beer with corn meal and lye, but did not master fermentation as did the Pueblos.</page><page sequence="4">4I8 THE GEORGIA REVIEW The Indians distinguished genera of plants very well, but not species: the Cherokee name for such a plant as mullein is "tobaccoish," because it seeds as does tobacco. They employed a dozen vegetable dyes, such as poke, sumac, and walnut. They were at their best with medicinal plants, and "in most cases the Indian remedy was as good as that used by European doctors of that time." Mooney collected 700 species of plants used by Cherokee doctors, and estimated that of these 1/10 were the best herbs available, 2/10 were of some value, and 7/10 were useless. They used nearly half of the drugs in our present pharmacopoeia. Here are some Indian drug-plants included in the 105 medicinal plants recently listed from Georgia: prickly ash, butterfly weed, baptisia, boneset, blue flag, bayberry, blackberry, bloodroot, cohosh, devil's shoestring, dogwood, elderberry, slippery elm, false unicorn root, golden seal, ginseng, sweet goldenrod, haw, hellebore, horsemint, Jimson weed, ladyslipper, lobelia, mullein, mistletoe, mandrake, New Jersey tea, pinkroot, pipsissewa, pennyroyal, partridge berry, saw palmetto, poke- berry, queenroot, rabbit tobacco, sweetgum, sassafras, sumac, smilax, snakeroot, white oak, wild cherry, willow, witch hazel, wormseed and yarrow. The holly Ilex vomitoria was another panacea, drunk as tea: it con- tains much more caffeine than other species of Ilex- nearly 2 per cent- and was used as a source of caffeine when our Oriental supply was cut off in 19 1 6. The Indians also used narcotic drugs in both medicine and ceremonies. These medicines were discovered and ap- plied by the medicine man, a most intelligent individual, who was feared rather than respected by his community. His position was much like that of the scientist today: he spoke his rituals in a language more universal than the local dialects, and not understood by common people. He taught his secrets to a few select apprentices; when pos- sible, to his sons. Indian medicine was less effective against unfamiliar diseases. Smallpox killed more than half the Cherokees: they fatally treated its fever by plunging the patient into a cold stream. They accepted dreams and trances as sources of the highest wisdom. They knew the psychological natures of animals: Cherokees named a dull fellow "turkey buzzard," an ill-temper√©d one "wasp," one very garrulous "grasshopper," and a hoarse one "bull-frog." Their myths are probably a source of the Uncle Remus tales. The punishment for misdemeanors was sarcasm, which they knew is most painful.</page><page sequence="5">HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN GEORGIA 419 They recognized the sanctity of human life, yet sometimes bred out weak stocks by exposing weak or deformed infants. Their severe initiation exercises were partly meant to kill off unfit youths. Probably because of these, pure-blooded Indians are still free from some heredi- tary faults, such as insanity. With utilitarian science only, and that studied only by a few, they could never advance far. They were preoccupied with immediate lo- cal problems, and not interested in theory. Generally lazy, superstitious, and unfriendly to outsiders, they clung to their old traditions. Like us, they loved to sit in smoky councils and recite their past glory, instead of working for a better future. The Colonial period was characterized by geographical and biological exploration along the coast. The travels of the Spaniards, Jean Ribault and others, yielded some description of the land and products; wild turkeys were sent from here to France fifty years before the Puritans found them in New England. The first real scientist in this region was Mark Catesby, who col- lected and painted from Virginia to Florida, though mostly in Geor- gia, 1719-1722. He went far from the white settlements on the coast, up the Savannah River to Fort Moore (near Augusta), and on up the mountains, hunting bears, panthers, and buffaloes. In the time of Gen- eral Oglethorpe it was said there were 10,000 of these useful buffaloes between Darien and Sapelo Island, but forty years later they were nearly extinct. Catesby sent plants, animals, shells, and sponges to his patron, Sir Hans Sloane in London; he recorded that Oglethorpe car- ried wild nutmeg back from Georgia. Worthy forerunner to Audubon, Catesby pictured birds, mammals, fish, reptiles, insects, and plants beautifully if not quite technically. He painted living specimens when possible, showing them most naturally; he described the chigger and its painful effects. His "Natural History" ran to four editions, one in German; and several sets of this magnificent work are now in Georgia libraries. Dr. William Houston, employed as early as 1732 to collect plants for the Georgia colony, brought specimens of many tropical varieties to Savannah ... J. William G. DeBrahm, "Surveyor for the Southern District of North America," made the first map of Georgia in 1757; his survey continued twenty years, begun when he founded Bethany, Georgia, with 150 German settlers in 175 1. He gives astronomical ob- servations, latitudes, temperatures, and a list of 90 trees, classified as</page><page sequence="6">420 THE GEORGIA REVIEW to whether they grow in swamp, upland, or mountains. DeBrahm was said to be "much addicted to alchemy"; he discusses indigo cul- ture, useful rivers, and the aborigines . . . Joseph Ottolenghi, a converted Jew, came to the Savannah Protestant Episcopal Mission as school- master in 1750, and was elected to the American Philosophical So- ciety of Philadelphia in 177 1. John Morel of Savannah was in 1770 also elected to that eminent scientific society, which in 1838 published his paper on the oil of benne seed. John Bartram of Pennsylvania studied Georgia plants en route to his botanical investigations of east Florida. His son William Bartram wrote the classic, "Travels," which, many times reprinted and trans- lated, has been called the foundation of natural history in the South. Oblivious of the Revolution, he set out in 1773, "at the request of Fothergill, of London, to search the Floridas and the western parts of Carolina and Georgia for discovery of rare and useful productions of nature, chiefly in the vegetable kingdom." From Charleston he crossed Georgia to Florida, thence by way of Augusta back to Charleston- and then he repeated this entire trip. The next year, he turned west across the Savannah, and entered the Tennessee River valley. But hostile tribes turned him back at Chatta- nooga; so he turned south, going by Augusta past Macon and on to Mobile. After exploring the Gulf coast across the Mississippi, he re- turned to Georgia, spent several months in the Altamaha basin, and rode back across the Carolinas to his father's house. This travel took courage, in regions where there were few or no white men, but unlike his hot-tempered father, he had a gift for making friends with Indians. They named him Puc-Puggy, the Flower-gatherer, and helped him on his way. Later he published a description of his red friends, an import- ant chapter in American ethnology. Except for five years' wandering through these southern states, he lived in retirement at his Quaker home, dying still a bachelor. Bartram knew botany better than any earlier visitor to Georgia, identifying plants accurately, with their Latin as well as common names. Little that related to the botanical missed his keen eye; he sent immense collections to his London patron, made excellent drawings of the specimens he collected, and began the systematic study of trees of this region. He discovered in Georgia the beautiful camellia-like shrub Gordonia, which in nature became extinct because of forest fires; but we have descendants of specimens that he preserved in his</page><page sequence="7">HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN GEORGIA 42 1 Philadelphia garden . . . His notes on migration became "the starting- point of American ornithology." He recorded extensive data on plants and animals, and discovered many new species of birds, listing 215 species found here . . . He noted the subsidence of the Georgia coast, later confirmed by Lyell, who repeatedly credits Bartram's accuracy in geological observation. Dr. Alexander Hewat named Georgia birds cursorily in 1779. Moses Marshall of Philadelphia also made a "botanic tour" across Georgia about 1789 . . . Intermittently from 1785 to 1806, Andre Michaux and his son F. A. Michaux studied trees along the coast and across the mountains to Nashville, collecting for the French government. For ten years, from a base garden in South Carolina they explored into Kentucky, Georgia, and Florida. Richmond Academy at Augusta, opened 1783, was one of the earliest schools in the United States. Its first curriculum was, as usual, languages and applied arithmetic, but soon the mathematics was ex- tended to calculus; later astronbmy, geology, and botany were added. The Academy was well equipped from the start, with a Dollond tele- scope, quadrant, surveying instruments, compass, and thermometers. William Longstreet of Augusta patented a steamboat in 1788, and it traveled on the Savannah River in 1806, the year before Robert Ful- ton's demonstration. But the value of priority alone is not great. More effective was Eli Whitney's invention of the cotton gin near Savannah in 1793. John Abbot is a man of whom we know little. After studying en- tomology in England, he became a prosperous planter, schoolmaster, and naturalist here. Quietly living for sixty years at the now dead town of Jacksonborough on Beaver Dam Creek, Screven County, "and neighboring parts," he painted thousands of beautiful colored pictures of butterflies, moths, and birds; his numerous comparisons with insects of Virginia show that he spent time there also. The first book on American insects is his Natural History of the Rarer Lepidopterous Insects of Georgia, edited and published by Sir James Edward Smith in London. Smith made the technical identifica- tions and nomenclature, but gives Abbot full credit for the substance of the text. Other reproductions of Abbot's drawings and descriptions of his specimens were published by Boisduval, Hubner, and Major John LeConte. Abbot's earlier collections are in the British Museum; others were</page><page sequence="8">422 THE GEORGIA REVIEW sent to Johann Karl Megerle at Vienna. His remaining specimens and 750 plates of drawings are in Savannah and at the Boston Museum of Natural History. He pictures accurately male and female, top and bottom, in lifelike position, with metamorphoses, as well as the adult stage, showing many details which the old master Fabricius had not noted. Beyond that, he gives exact dates of the appearance, habits, and diets. He notes the smaller insects parasitic upon the larger ones, points out some species harmful to plants, and tells how to destroy them. His many birds in the British Museum show that he was also an expert taxidermist. He made excursions around Savannah with Alexander Wilson, the chief pioneer American ornithologist, and drew Swain- son's warbler and LeConte's sparrow 25 and 40 years, respectively, before they were described and named by Audubon. The University of Georgia opened in 1801, with mathematics and natural philosophy taught by Josiah Meigs, a former Yale professor. The next year Meigs became president, but he continued to teach the sciences; after ten years he resigned to become Surveyor-General of the United States. Except Franklin, "he was perhaps the earliest scien- tific meteorologist in America," having published observations made while he was practicing law in Bermuda. With Jefferson, he led in establishing the U. S. Weather Bureau. The early curriculum at Georgia was the same as in other univer- sities, especially Yale, being mostly languages and theology, with arith- metic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, astronomy, chemistry, and natural philosophy. Before the disastrous fire of 1830, the University had acquired $10,000 worth of apparatus, as much as was owned by most institutions of that time, with the exception of Transylvania. Be- sides giving demonstrations himself, Meigs let the students perform many experiments, long before individual laboratory work was customary. Natural philosophy was taught next by the extremely popular Dr. Henry Jackson, who in 1822 separated physics from chemistry. After he left in 1828, all the sciences were taught by James Jackson, son of the Revolutionary hero, G√©n√©ral Jackson, and a member of the first class graduating from the University, in 1804. Besides teaching physics, chemistry, mineralogy, French, etc., he botanized as far as Tennessee and Carolina, finding several new species. Many naturalists visited Georgia before 1820, including Beyrich, Thomas Say, James Mease, Thomas Nuttall, and the Portuguese, Abbe Correa de Serra, who inspired a group of young Virginians to en-</page><page sequence="9">HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN GEORGIA 423 thusiasm in botany, and studied there with F. W. Gilmer, a founder with Jefferson of the University of Virginia. The skeletons of mastodons, saber-tooth tigers (Megalonyx jef- fersoni), and such large animals were found near Savannah in a fossil bed representing eight species. They were studied by J. H. Couper and Drs. Habersham and Scriven, and their findings summarized in a memoir by William B. Hodgson. This versatile Georgian also ex- plored with Lyell and LeConte, and wrote a monograph on the North African languages, from his observations as consul at Tunis. He further studied the southern Indians, and was a charter member of the American Ethnological Society, along with S. K. Tefft of Savannah, J. H. Couper, and W. B. Stevens of Athens, later Bishop Stevens of Philadelphia. A large part of Georgia's ante bellum culture was overflow from South Carolina, and there were close relations with the scientists of that state. The prominent Charlton family of Savannah descends from Thomas Walter, the first important botanist of South Carolina. In that remarkable cultural center of Charleston, none was more gifted than Stephen Elliott, legislator, financier, editor, teacher, orator, and botanist. Like many southern leaders of that time, he was a Yale graduate; his marriage with Miss Esther Habersham of Georgia strengthened his ties with our state. His Sketch of the Botany of South Carolina and Georgia was the best and most complete work on this flora before the War, describing more than 3,000 species. Elliott's de- scriptions are most reliable, "especially accurate on the difficult grasses." He explored east Georgia a little, but depended on correspond- ents more than on his own field work. He acknowledges help from the following: (1) William Baldwin, a Pennsylvania Quaker who, forced to come south by hereditary tuberculosis, practiced medicine at St. Marys and served as ship's doctor on a South American cruise. He made long foot journeys all over Georgia, Florida, and Indian territory, seeking both health and plants. He described several new species, and helped Muhlen- berg catalog North American plants. Baldwin's herbarium of southern and South American plants was studied by Nuttall, who named the species Baldwinia for him- "his botanical zeal and knowledge rarely excelled in America." This herba- rium was given to Darlington, who published Reliquae Baldivinianae and sold the collection to the North Carolina cryptogamist, von Schweinitz. He in turn found in it 3,000 species not in his own herba-</page><page sequence="10">424 THE GEORGIA REVIEW rium, and finally bequeathed it to the Philadelphia Academy. Torrey and Gray in their monographs used Baldwin's remaining unpublished MS. (2) John Abbot, who sent Elliott many specimens from the Savannah region. (3) James Jackson, later of Athens, who sent many plants from Louisville, Georgia. (4) Dr. Samuel Boykin of Milledgeville, who sent specimens to Elliott and to Nuttall. Later at Columbus, Georgia, Boykin studied the botany and conchology of that region, and sent Chattahoochee shells representing 1 1 new species to Isaac Lea at Philadelphia. When Sir Charles Lyell passed through Columbus in 1846, Boykin showed him the fossil beds there, and they found much new material. (5) Arminius Oemler of Savannah, who botanized into Carolina and Maryland; he also studied oysters intensively, corresponded with the Boston entomologist Harris, and gave the Elliott Society of Charles- ton a collection of butterflies. His son, Dr. Augustus Oemler, John Abbot's friend, also studied insects and drew them well. (6) Mr. Lyon, who gathered a herbarium from Georgia swamps to Carolina mountains, and into Creek territory on the west, leaving his collections with Elliott while he botanized in Florida in winter. Lyon also pointed out some unusual Georgia sanguinaria to Nuttall. (7) Aloysius Enslen, who, sent by Prince Lichtenstein of Austria, made a large collection in Georgia and neighboring states; he sent El- liott especially many swamp plants, and likewise assisted Pursh and Muhlenberg at Philadelphia. (8) Prof. William Green at Athens, a botanist, who taught mathe- matics and astronomy; the University bought his set of globes for $200. (9) Dr. John Brickell of Savannah, for whom Elliott named the species Brickellia. This Georgian also aided Muhlenberg. Others assisting Elliott included Congressman R. W. Habersham, Mr. Kim of Philadelphia, Dr. Latham along the lower Chattahoochee, and Drs. Wray and Leavenworth of Augusta. Never before or since have so many contributed to a science in Georgia. The most notable of Elliott's Georgia collaborators were the Le- Contes. They left the state as young men, but they form a special chapter in Georgia history, and they would have raised our region to a position of scientific eminence if they had remained. Major John E. LeConte, Jr., explored several states effectively. In</page><page sequence="11">HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN GEORGIA 425 New York, 1811, he made one of the earliest local florula in this country. He sent Elliott Altamaha plants, published many botanical papers, and undertook to write a "Synopsis of the Botany of the United States." His zoological publications include the initial volume of a comprehensive treatise on American Lepidoptera, describing 29 new species of Coleoptera, 14 of which he found in Georgia. He sent Coleoptera to S. S. Haldeman; he sent Georgia, Alabama, and Virginia shells and fossils to Isaac Lea, and butterflies to T. W. Harris at Boston. He established a species of turtle, contributed several new species of fungus to von Schweinitz, and rare specimens of mice to Bachmann and Audubon for their monograph on American quad- rupeds. By "unremitting exertions" he added much to the collection of southern plants by Pursh, who did not find time to explore Georgia personally. In a more practical way, Major LeConte joined F. P. Porcher in a study of grape culture, intensively comparing northern and southern states in this respect. His son John L. LeConte of Philadelphia was "the most distinguished entomologist" of the family, like his father specializing on Coleoptera and describing many Georgia insects. Lewis LeConte remained on the family plantation in Liberty County, but he was more than a successful planter. Besides gathering specimens for Elliott, he sent many shells to Lea. At the suggestion of his brother, the Major, he traveled 100 miles into the Indian territory which is now Alabama to collect certain shells. He made excursions deep into the Altamaha swamps for rare plants, and discovered new species, all of which he selflessly gave to others to publish. Few scientists have given away more glory. He knew botany profoundly and identified some species for Elliott. Botanists from afar came to study in the botanic garden on his farm. He collected a fine scientific library; he was expert in mathematics and physics, and he built a chemical laboratory in his house. He completed several botanical and zoological papers, which were burned by Sherman. Lewis' daughter Jane married Dr. John M. B. Harden, who had studied medicine in the office of Dr. W. C. Danieli at Savannah, and later at Charleston. Dr. Harden and Major LeConte gave great assist- ance on reptiles to the Charleston herpetologist, Dr. J. E. Holbrook. Harden was a master of zoology, botany, geology, chemistry, astron- omy, and mathematics. A flora of Liberty County and an article on the climate of that region were among his publications.</page><page sequence="12">420 THE GEORGIA REVIEW Lewis' sons, John and Joseph, were the greatest scientists ever pro- duced in Georgia. Both received undergraduate training in the Univer- sity of Georgia, medical degrees in New York, and further graduate study at Harvard. They taught at the University of Georgia until 1857, when they went to South Carolina College at Columbia. Both served the Confederacy in the Niter Bureau during the war, and in 1869, be- cause of desolation and carpetbaggers, went to the new University of California, where they were inspired to produce many important re- searches, and played a large part in making that institution great. John LeConte taught chemistry and physics at Athens, and he also prepared the lists of Coleoptera and 273 species of birds in White's Statistics of Georgia. He explored with Lyell, identifying birds for him, and studied the localization of response by a decapitated alligator, an important point in psychology and neurology. At Columbia he discov- ered the sensitive flame, and his later work was principally acoustical, until he became the first president of the University of California. Joseph LeConte married Caroline Nisbet of Macon and practised there a year, in 1849 helping to form the Georgia State Medical Society. Probably inspired by Agassiz' lectures at Savannah, he went to Harvard to become Agassiz' first and best student, also studying botany under Asa Gray. For one year, he taught all the sciences at Oglethorpe Uni- versity, and then geology, botany, and French at the University of Georgia. . His first important paper was a study made with Agassiz, on the growth of Florida coral, published from Athens in 1856. His first class at the University found him so inspiring that they presented him with a large encyclopedia. During the War he manufactured drugs and ex- plored the caves of north Georgia and adjacent states, analyzing sources of niter. Among the hardships he suffered were a narrow escape from the Yankees, and Sherman's burning of the MS. of his doctoral dis- sertation. In 1869 he first published his classic geology textbook, which shaped American work in that field for a generation. There were so many LeContes, and all contributing to diverse fields, that it is often difficult to know which one did a particular piece of work: thus Eaton's Ferns of North America simply credits a fern to LeConte. Their continued mastery of a field resembles the works of the Bach and Bernoulli families. There are still several descendants in this region, actively engaged in scientific work.</page><page sequence="13">HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN GEORGIA 427 In 1828 a 36-pound meteorite was seen to fall in Forsyth County; it was immediately recovered, and a piece analyzed by Dr. C. U. Shepard of Charleston. Several others have been found in Georgia, and studied both here and in Europe; the largest, weighing 219 pounds, found at Social Circle in 1926, is in the State Capitol Museum. Dr. Shepard's ex- cellent collection of Georgia minerals went to the Charleston Museum, the oldest American museum and one of the best in the South. About 1830, the State University received mineral collections from Dr. W. C. Danieli and the Reverend George White, of Savannah; Pro- fessor M. A. Ward established a new brick museum building and an extensive botanical garden, which was highly regarded by visiting bot- anists for many years. In the same decade, Elijah Burritt of Connecticut settled in the capi- tal, Milledgeville, to edit a newspaper, practice civil engineering, sur- vey the Chattahoochee valley for the state, and publish a pamphlet on star-finding. Though his paper had not expressed any anti-slavery views, he was suspected of being abolitionist, and in 1829 he was driven out by a mob, with his property confiscated. Georgia was the loser, as this refugee later published Geography of the Heavens: 300,000 copies were sold by 1876, and the book had wide influence, even though his observa- tions were not reliable. For instance, he states that Canopus is not viable in the United States, whereas it is seen as far north as Chattanooga. Editor's Note : This article was ivritten in two parts. Part II will appear, as a continuation, in the Spring, 1949, issue.</page></plain_text>
