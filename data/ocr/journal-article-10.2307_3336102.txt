<plain_text><page sequence="1">Njom among the Ejagham HANS-JOACHIM KOLOSS n January-February 1980, while on a collecting expedi- tion in the Cross River area of west Cameroon for the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart, I was able to study some impor- tant aspects of Ejagham culture.1 The museum already owned a large number of Ejagham masks and figures, and I wanted to use this opportunity to conduct first-hand research on their purpose and significance. It soon became apparent that they could only be understood in a context involving witches and the medicines used to combat them. The term "medicine" re- fers to the God-given power, derived from plants, to fight evil.2 It must be fixed on certain objects, such as figures and masks, and is activated by prayers to God and the ancestors to save seriously ill persons when the usual curatives have failed and diviners have determined that the sickness has been caused by witchcraft. In 1975-77, I had encountered many of the same phenomena while conducting research in Oku, a Tikar kingdom in the Cameroon Grassfields to the northeast.3 The findings from that study may be usefully compared with those for the Ejagham in west Cameroon, and together they provide a much broader basis for understanding medicines in the overall Afri- can framework. It is significant that because the cultures sur- rounding the Cross River region and the Grassfields have de- veloped social and political structures that are superficially very different, they hold a different attitude toward medicines and their use. I was much impeded by the fact that little original research has been done on this subject in the Cross River region and the Grassfields. The work of P.A. Talbot, who spent the first three decades of this century as a colonial administrator in Nigeria, is the most notable. In the Shadow of the Bush (1912), his book on the Ejagham of southeast Nigeria, whom he calls the "Ekoi," not only helps to explain certain phenomena found among the closely related Ejagham of west Cameroon, but shows the his- torical relationship between the latter's medicines and as- sociated masks and those of southern Nigerian peoples. How- ever, very little ethnological material on the Cameroon Ejagham is available.4 Although a distinct cultural and linguis- tic entity, apparently they have never had any kind of signifi- cant political center. In precolonial times, they comprised numerous autonomous groups, each consisting of only a few villages numbering a few thousand people. The 1980 study concentrated mainly on Kembong, a com- munity of approximately 5,000 inhabitants located some eighteeen kilometers southwest of Mamfe, the most important town of Manyu Division in the Southwest Province of Came- roon. The fact that my companion and interpreter, the Rev. Peter Ayukachale, was a native of the town very much influ- enced my decision to restrict the physical area of research. The study of witchcraft and medicine, in which masks and figures have a traditional role, involves special problems. Since the malevolent activities of witches always take place in utter sec- recy, ordinary humans can have only incomplete knowledge of them. In fact, one ran the risk of being suspected a witch if one exhibited too much knowledge. Although the secrecy sur- rounding this subject has been relaxed, the old rituals are sel- dom performed now, and there are few people in a position to give reliable information. With Mr. Ayukachale's help, how- ever, I was able to make the acquaintance of the most impor- tant men representing various medicine groups in Kembong and to interview them extensively To avoid the possibility of informants' biased interpreta- tions, the prayers intoned during the rituals are included here verbatim. These are not standard spells or incantations, but spontaneous appeals to the ancestors that are formulated to fit the particular situation. As the prayers are the key to the medicines' effectiveness, their wording is a source of invalu- able insights. Talbot was particularly interested in the rituals used to counteract witchcraft (1912: 65ff., 139ff.). Although he has not recorded the whole range of rituals and especially prayers, his reports indicate that they coincided with those I encountered. Before medicine can be discussed in its various manifestations and social contexts, the most important princi- ples of witchcraft must be illustrated, because among the Ejagham in Cameroon-as everywhere in Africa-medicine is nothing more than an antidote to these much feared powers. Witches are persons who make themselves invisible or turn themselves into animals in order to commit serious crimes, most notably, murder. The belief in their effectiveness is an important fact of daily life in the Cross River area, evidenced by the number of socio-political institutions and magic rites and practices that exist to fight against them. It is said that witches do not usually appear individually, but form societies much like regular societies in which members are required to pay dues. In their case, however, these are not paid with domestic animals (e.g., chickens and goats) but with members of the witches' families: they are forced to give their own blood, so to speak. The society "eats" the victim, or rather his vital force, which is gradually drained out of him until he dies. The soul of the witch leaves its sleeping body at night to carry out the task, perhaps transforming itself into an animal, and it returns at dawn. Witches are said to be constantly on the lookout for new ways of destroying their victims. They turn themselves into owls, using their tongues to penetrate walls and draw blood from sleeping people. They carry them off in the guise of huge birds. As pythons, they poison victims by spitting on them, and they murder in the form of leopards, elephants, and other dangerous animals. In invisible form, witches may beat their victims with clubs or cutlasses, pull them from their boats into the water to drown, or rob them of their hearts. Attacks in dreams are especially common. Witches even have ways of forcing people to commit suicide. The fear of witches used to be so intense that people would not leave their houses after dark. This fear remains even today, not only in the isolated rural areas but also in the cities. They are blamed for most accidents, serious illnesses, and deaths. The Ejagham say, "Nobody dies without a cause," the only natural deaths being those of the elderly. Because witches are the powers of invisibility, of darkness, and of the night, their 71</page><page sequence="2">society is called Ekume Atu ("Sitting in the Night") or Echem Atu ("Meeting in the Night"). It is said that they are used by God to punish man; and that without them everything on earth would be good. Although a witch can be male or female, women are said to have the greater affinity for witchcraft.5 Among the Ejagham of west Cameroon, women are clearly second-class human be- ings at best, thought to be without real intelligence or self- control, whereas men are considered physically, intellectually, and morally superior. Their supposedly greater supernatural powers indicate the presence of sexual antagonisms within Ejagham society Supernatural powers are considered to be hereditary and to manifest themselves in certain physical characteristics. The stomach of a witch is thought to contain miniatures of those animals into which she transforms herself. A concentration of these on the left indicates that her predisposition was inher- ited from her mother, from her father if on the right. The vic- tims also reveal a sign: small pieces of meat are found in their hearts. This explains why autopsies used to be performed on all corpses by the men "with four eyes" (i.e., those who have extraordinary powers of seeing).' These men also possessed some supernatural abilities but used them only to the good of society. They could determine whether the deceased was a vic- tim of witchcraft or a witch herself. If medicine killed a witch, her blood would turn to water. Her corpse would then be treated with medicine to destroy her dangerous soul. It is necessary to remember that in Africa all calamities are blamed on social problems and conflicts, and witches more or less fulfill the role of scapegoat. Public pressure often leaves an accused person, even if innocent, no choice but to admit a crime of witchcraft. Among some peoples it is believed that a person can subconsciously act as a witch. Under these condi- tions, everyone runs the risk of being so accused. These sub- conscious aspects of witchcraft have not yet been studied in depth, and therefore R.F. Thompson's findings in this regard are all the more valuable, especially since they also concern the Cross River region. According to Thompson some women ac- cused of being witches were questioned by the mask-medicine Obasinjom: '"Have you done this?' They answered, 'Yes'. He asked again, 'Were you at a certain place?' Again they an- swered, 'Yes'. They apologized and said they did not know that their powers had been so destructive. They begged for- giveness. They offered material amends and these were ac- cepted" (Thompson 1974: 215). The psychological and social aspects of witchcraft in the Cross River area are also typical for witchcraft in the Oku kingdom of the Grassfields, although there are important dif- ferences. In Oku, women are not believed to have greater supernatural powers than men, nor are these powers consid- ered hereditary or accompanied by physical signs. Con- sequently, autopsies are unknown. One has the impression that witchcraft in Oku, as compared to that among the Ejagham in Cameroon, is more abstract in the sense that acci- dents and all evil are blamed on usually rather obscure influ- ences and "ghosts." In fact, all thoughts and actions that threaten the social order are considered witchery. With the help of the medicines, the attempt is made to ward off these anonymous and dangerous powers. Should, however, a crim- inal or a witch be caught by a diviner, it is the duty of the much feared secret society called Kwifon to punish him. Probably the greatest difference between Oku and Ejagham witchcraft lies in the special dangers connected with death in Oku. It is believed that a deceased may have secretly been a witch, who will now take revenge by torturing and tormenting members of his own family, especially as they sleep. There are quite a number of medicine societies whose sole object is to drive away these spirits. Giving someone who has died a proper funeral is an essential part of Oku medicine. Among the Ejagham, the spirits of the dead are apparently less feared. In any case, the medicines do not figure in funeral ceremonies. The task of ijomi, the Ejagham term for medicine, is to hold a witch responsible for an illness or death and punish her ac- cordingly. Four kinds of uljom found in Kembong will be dis- cussed here: Enok Ateng, Mfam, Amok, and Okeboho. A fifth type, Obasinjom, which is localized in a mask, will be treated in the second part of this article. Ayuk Tambla from Afap, a small village near Kembong, is a native healer specializing in rheumatism and broken bones. He is, however, best known for his medicine Enok Ateng ("Fighting Alone"), localized in an anthropomorphic figural carving, and for his abilities as a diviner. The medicine (called "juju" in pidgin English) had been passed on to him, the first-born son, twenty years earlier by his father, who also taught him the art of healing. Since he must also be able to deal with witchcraft, a healer is believed to have special en- dowments that only God can give him. Ayuk Tambla's father had shown the medicine to his other sons as well, but they proved to be unsuited to this difficult profession, being unable to learn to identify and use the medicinal plants. Therefore, shortly before his death, the father transferred all of the medicine to his eldest son. He took the figure in his hands one last time, taking his leave: "I am going. I do not carry this with me. I empower you. If you wear this medicine, it should do its work. And if you treat a victim who has been attacked by it, and he has confessed, may he or she be well. I have given you food." As during all the ceremonies, he faced the sun, the source of light, power, and life. The abdomen of the figure displays the tooth of a wild pig, and attached to the head are several feathers. It was explained that in this human form the medicine is able to spot and ap- proach invisible witches without arousing their suspicions. The feathers allow the medicine to follow them even in flight. With the tooth of the wild pig (i.e., of a very aggressive animal) Enok Ateng can strike at the supernatural creatures. Its equipment includes a black cloth used to create darkness and capture witches by throwing it over them like a net. Unlike many other medicines, Enok Ateng has no special society, nor does it have a "secret forest" (also called "evil forest"), an area in the bush outside the village that is forbid- den and dangerous to outsiders, where important and secret ceremonies are conducted and the magical plants are grown. Anyone may see or touch the figure, but menstruating women must keep their distance so as not to weaken the njom. Whenever the medicine specialist, Ayuk Tambla, activates the figure, he must have abstained from sexual relations with women the night before. He must also take care that Enok Ateng is "fed" occasionally, or it will turn against him. Approx- imately every two months, if the medicine has remained un- used, he spits on the figure with hot alligator pepper and pours palm wine on it, saying: "Father God, Mother God,7 you made us all. Let there be no trouble. This is your food. Take and eat." In case he ever wanted to give up his njomr-a question that would never have arisen in the old days-he would first kill Enok Ateng, or rather, its power, with a special medicine. Every time Ayuk Tambla begins treatment of a patient, he drinks a little palm wine and, holding the vessel in his left 72</page><page sequence="3">hand, addresses a prayer to his father and his other ancestors: "Father, you taught me this medicine. And all that I do, I learned from you. I want to start treatment. If anyone through witchcraft or by any other means tries to hinder this treatment, then let this medicine fight such a person. But (and now he takes the glass in his right hand) if it is true that I got these powers from you, let what I do bring success. The patient and myself be in peace." Taking the glass in both hands, he pours the rest of the palm wine-the portion for the ancestors-onto the ground. When it is to be activated against witches and criminals, Enok Ateng asks for one jug of palm wine, a cock, one "ani- mal" (meaning the leg or joint of a wild animal), 3,500 CFA (a worker earned about 300 CFA a day in 1980), and pepper. Payment must be made in full, with each item shown to the medicine before it can be activated. Ayuk Tambla spits on the figure with palm wine and then shows it the cock ("Here is the cock. I have taken it."), then the meat ("Here is the animal. I have taken it."), and finally the money ("Here is the money, 3,500 CFA. I have taken it."). Then he chews the alligator pep- per and spits it on the figure: "If the witch sets him (this pa- tient) free, you also set the witch free. But if he persists and kills the patient, then also kill the witch." Leaving the figure in the patient's room, he goes home. If the afflicted person, who receives no further medical treatment of any kind, gets well, that is the end of the affair. The medicine specialist has gotten his fee. If the patient dies, a njom will not be satisfied until it kills not only the witch but the witch's whole family, unless it is recon- ciled in a special ceremony. The payment for reconciliation is particularly high: a goat, a cock, a new cutlass, a bottle of liquor, alligator pepper, and a raffia bag. One of the members of the witch's family officially approaches the medicine spe- cialist: "Father, this, my illness, is the result of the medicine you swore last time. I have gone to the diviner and have been told that it is because my late sister did such a bad thing. So we have come to appease your medicine." Facing west, the medicine specialist rubs magical plants between his hands, saying: "Father God, Mother God, I sent out a soldier to war. I now know the victim, the witch. And now I want to appease you." The figure is then rubbed with the medicine: "I have told Father God and Mother God. From this moment do not go again against this family." He spits on the figure once more, and the curse is lifted from the family of the witch. Together the participants in the ceremony eat the meat. Enok Ateng is used not only against witches, but against all who break the law, including adulterers, murderers, and thieves. The prayers the njom specialist addresses to the medicine in these situations are basically the same. In the case of theft, for example, he might say: "Enok Ateng, I want to send you to war. That man who has stolen this article, hunt him. If he brings back the article and puts it behind the house, set him free. But if he hardens his heart and refuses to return the stolen article, catch him. Do not kill him, but make him confess." Ayuk Tambla is also a diviner. His method of divining is un- usual in that it employs the assistance of a virgin boy. In a glass of water containing some dissolved medicine, the boy is able to discern a spirit who questions the criminal. During this in- terrogation, Ayuk Tambla places his hand upon the boy's head. These sessions take place only in the morning or in the evening, when the sun is not at its zenith. According to the njom specialist, criminals caught in this manner have never denied their crimes.

Before relinquishing it, he held it in both his hands saying: "Enok Ateng, I have sold your object to the white man, but not your power. You leave this object now and come back to me. This is the money I have re- ceived. May the object go without anger from you." He concluded by spitting on the carv- ing. Ayuk Tambla gave the following instruc- tions to the carver for a new figure: it must be able to stand without help; it must be straight and have natural proportions; and it must have eyes and ears to be able to see and hear. It need not be beautiful; instead, it should look fearsome. The finished figure was introduced to God early in the morning: "Oh Father, I am going to the bush to look for the various herbs to empower this figure. Help me not to forget any." Before cutting the most important and at the same time most dangerous herbs, he spit on them with alligator pepper and apologized for having to kill them: "I have come in the name of God and my father to get you. I am not taking you for harm but to serve man- kind." Back in his compound, he ground and mixed the herbs, rubbed the figure with the medicine, and then killed a cock, letting its blood run over the carving: "God, give power to this figure because all power in life comes from you. Let things be good and not bad." Chickens, particularly cocks, are by far the most important sacrificial animals for the Ejagham, who regard them as pure and hav- ing but little blood. It is said that they are close to the ancestors: when they stand motionless on one leg they are thought to be communing with them. After each sacrifice, the testes of the cock are examined. If they are white, the sacrifice has been accepted; otherwise it must be repeated (cf. Mansfeld 1908: 176). In Oku the chicken is also the sacrificial animal, but for another reason. It is said to be "devilish" because it recognizes danger. Even shut up in a completely dark coop, a chicken will cackle if a bird of prey circles above the compound. Thus its blood is considered to be particularly potent and must run over a newly made njom. It would be possible for Ayuk Tambla to sell the medicine-not only the figure, but also all of the knowledge and the utensils that go with it-for a high price. With the sale, though, he would create additional competition for him- self, a drawback outweighing any momentary profit. He also refuses to make Enok Ateng into a medicine society in which strangers, for a fee, can become members and acquire certain rights. This would be profitable, too, but he prefers to remain alone and independent. Probably most medicine societies developed when formerly independent njom specialists decided to take on such partners. Unlike Enok Ateng, Mfam, the second njom to be discussed here, represents a medicine society. In Kembong its former membership of fifteen has dwindled to four, and its usage, frequent in the old days, has similarly di- minished to only two or three times a year. 90</page><page sequence="5">The power of Mfam resides in two bushcow horns filled with medicine. The reason for this form and its exact beginnings are unknown. It is said to have originated in Kesham (Mamfe-Overside region) and probably reached Kembong via nearby Afap during the last century Mfam societies can be found in a number of villages, but these maintain no connections with one another. Talbot also mentioned Mfam and classified it as one of the most important "Ekoi" medicines, but he de- scribed it as consisting of six horns (1912: 51,139). In Kembong the members do not meet on any particular day They simply get together for ceremonies in the house of the society's leader. At present it is Hollford Ndip, who says he was born in 1905. Anyone may look at the medicine, but the uninitiated are sent away if they go too close. A person who delib- erately touches the medicine will fall ill. Mfam has a secret forest, where the most important magical tree of Mfam and the most important magical herbs are to be found and where im- portant ceremonies are conducted. The society is composed of three stages. The first is called Abang Mfam ("Horn of Mfam"). Whenever new members have paid the required initiation fees-an "animal" (i.e., leg or joint of a wild animal), a cock, a bunch of plantains, a jug of wine, and a bottle of oil-a feast is held, but no religious cere- monies occur. Participation in the eating and drinking revelries of the society and the use of Mfam free of charge are the only privileges en- joyed by members of this rank. The second stage, called Etem Njom ("Forest of Medicine"), is reserved for full members who know the magical plants. The fees for this rank are the same as for Abang Mfam but also include two fathoms of loincloth for the leader. Whoever has be- longed to this stage the longest will automatically become Ndip's successor after his death. The third level is that of the leader himself. Upon being installed in office, he pays the fol- lowing fees: a goat, a cock, an "animal," a bunch of plantains, and a jug of wine. No reli- gious rites are performed. However, during the next ceremony to take place in the evil forest, the new leader embraces the sacred magical tree and calls out "Oh Mfam!" seven times. Whenever Mfam is sought out, Ndip takes the medicine horns to the patient's compound during the early morning. These are laid on the ground, and he addresses them: "You have been brought here because of Mr. X's ill- ness. It has been known that he is being be- witched. If the witch allows Mr. X to recover, set him free. But if he continues to hunt the sick person and kills him, follow the witch. If the witch replaces a child or an adult for the killed one, set him free. But if there is no re- placement, kill the witch and also enter his family until the last member is dead." The family of the stricken person is obliged only to give Mfam a gourd of palm wine. Since the "swearing of medicine" among the Ejagham is normally done in public, the witch can be sure of being forewarned. If she leaves her victim alone to recover, the matter is consid- ered settled. No further ceremonies or fees are required. If, however, the witch should con- tinue her attacks and the patient dies, she her- self will fall seriously ill, and a diviner will tell her that she is being persecuted by Mfam. There is no escaping unless the medicine is appeased. In this case, the fees are a cock, an "animal," a bunch of plantains, and a jug of wine. Under the tree of Mfam, Ndip talks to the medicine: "Mfam, we have come. Some weeks ago you were sent to war against those who killed Mr. X and now you have done your work. The victim was caught by you. She has confessed and fulfilled all your conditions. Now we want to start treating her. Tell us if you accept the treatment or not." Should the medicine reject the ceremony because certain requirements were not fulfilled, preparations for it must begin anew. Only after the offer- ings have been accepted and Mfam has been appeased can the stricken witch be treated with the usual curatives. Should she dare to attack a human being again, she will not be spared by Mfam. This medicine cannot be killed. If there is no one left who knows how to use Mfam, it will turn against the descendants of its owners, who will have to propitiate it. The njom is not altered or reconsecrated unless the horns, or the medicine in them, are damaged. Should this occur, a cock is sacrificed and the blood is allowed to run into the horns. Unlike other njom, Mfam does not demand regular sacrifices, but every morning Ndip says a prayer before washing: "My father, I am washing my face this morning, and I re- member you as the one who taught me Mfam. Mfam has been sworn for many purposes. It seems as if you are sleeping. As I pray to you, wake up and do the jobs which you are called to do. Father God, Mother God, you are the giver of all things. You made the leaves and taught our ancestors how to use them. If the prayer I make is true, let success-follow. But if I am unfair, bring any ill back to me." The power of Amok, another type of njom, rests in rather nondescript lumps of clay. In Kembong there is a large one (approximately 9 cm. high) called Nseh Amok ("Father of Amok"), which must never leave the com- pound, and fourteen smaller ones (about 8 cm. high) that are simply called Amok. These objects are placed on earthen shards to avoid contact with the ground. Women are forbid- den to touch them. Amok has no secret forest. It does not even belong to a society, in the strict sense of the word, where the leader may be descended from any of the various families in the town, but is the particular and unsala- ble property of a single family. In Kembong the current chief is Moses Ojong, who took over this office from his father, Ata Ogomar- reje, around 1968. The chief of the family is also the leader of Amok. Amok was founded by an ancestor named Ata Enowekuku when there were supposedly large numbers of witches, and subsequently many leopards, the preferred guise of witches. At that time, the family lived in the small hamlet of Abaresire Otop, which no longer exists. The magical herbs, the details of the equipment, and the rituals were revealed to Ata Enowekuku by God in a dream. The revelation of such knowledge in dreams is common in both the Cross River region and the Grassfields, as well as in other parts of Af- rica. God explained to him that the magical herbs have power and would protect the fam- ily The name Amok (" to push away") derives from Ata Enowekuku. Since his time, no de- tail connected with the medicine has been al- tered; Amok is the same today as when God and the ancestors created it. In the past, it had a good many more members and was used much more frequently. Today its services are needed perhaps ten times a year. All of Amok's important functions must remain within the domain of family members. Only they may know its secrets, especially those of the magical plants. At about four years of age, the boys of the family begin their education in the medicine. When they are older, they are taught the magical herbs, a process called the "washing of eyes." For members of the family igeither special initiation into Amok nor initiation fees are necessary. These two requirements are de- manded only of outsiders who may come from any of the different quarters in the com- munity. The initiation fees consist of an "ani- mal," a cock, plantains, and wine. When the food has been prepared, Nseh Amok is brought into the yard, and Moses Ojong takes a little of it into his left hand, with which the ancestors are always given their share of food: "Ata ('father') Enowekuku come here, take this food and meet your sons and grandsons Ata Tabengombo, Ata Enowugombo, Ata Ag- bormungui, and Ata Ogomarreje." He sets the food in front of the medicine and adds a little meat: "This is your own share of the meat." He also pours a little water on the ground: "This is to remove particles of plan- tains and meat from your teeth." Last, he of- fers the ancestors palm wine: "And now here is wine; take and drink." When this is done, he fetches the food for the members of Amok and explains the reason for the gathering: "This is our own food, meat and wine, brought by Mr. X to become a member of Amok. We want to eat it now. May no one suf- fer from headache and neck pains." Everyone receives the same food, except that the bones are reserved for the leader. It is important that no leftovers be taken home. In the end, Ojong takes the glass in both his hands and pours the rest of the wine on the ground, saying, "Amok fern" ("Cause the person to swell"; Amok punishes its victims by making their bodies swell), and the others answer, "Fern kput" ("Swell very large"). Anyone wishing to make an appeal to Amok must bring along a jug of wine. The leader may grant his request to take an Amok clay object to his compound to be sworn there, on condition that Amok never come in contact with water and that the solicitor ab- stain from sexual contact with women the night before. If the leader himself is asked to activate the medicine, he must be paid a cock. 91</page><page sequence="6">Ojong "awakens" Amok by rubbing the lump of clay with yellow camwood, throwing a pebble at it with his left hand, and finally spit- ting on it with alligator pepper: "Amok, you are listening. If the one who entered Mr. X's house and carried away the money from Mr. X brings the money back, let him be free from your attack. But if he persists and will not bring back the money, then catch him. When he comes for treatment set him free only if he returns the money." If the thief secretly re- turns the money to the compound of the robbed man, the latter must take it to Ojong, who in turn shows it to Amok: "This is the money that was stolen. After swearing you, the thief feared you and threw the money into the owner's compound. As the owner brought it to me to show it to you, now I hand it back to him. If he uses it, let his head and neck not be pained." Returning the money to its rightful owner, Ojong turns once more to Amok: "I still send you to war against the thief. Catch him. Catch him, until he brings the necessary things for the sacrifice." The medicine must thus be reconciled even after the thief has contritely returned the stolen money to its owner: "The thief has shown fear and has accepted his guilt. He has brought the stolen money and he has also brought the necessary things for your sacrifice. Don't go to war against him any longer." Should the thief try to keep the money, Amok will cause him to fall ill, and eventually he will be forced to pay the prescribed fees: a goat, an "animal," a cock, an egg, a bunch of plantains, a jug of wine, a bottle of palm wine from a standing palm tree, a bottle of palm oil, alligator pepper, yellow camwood, indigen- ous salt, a fathom of cloth, tobacco, and a piece of chalk. All of these things are taken behind the house. In the presence of the leader the thief must then confess, "I have stolen the money," and at the same time hand the money over to him. The leader then asks, "Have you finished?" The reply: "Yes, I have finished." The leader says, "Amok, he has finished." Subsequently, the usual offerings of food are made, accompanied by prayers ending with the words "This food has been brought by Mr. X for the pacification of Amok against him and his family." Only the members of Amok partake of the meal that follows. The patient and his family are excluded. Then the egg and the cock are sacrificed, with the contents of the egg and the blood of the cock poured over the lumps of clay: "I give you this egg and blood. When you catch somebody, let the person shine (the body swells up and the skin begins to shine) if he bathes or not." Finally, the testes of the sac- rificial cock are examined. If these indicate that Amok has accepted the offerings, the treatment of the patient stricken by Amok, who always exhibits the symptoms of a swol- len body and shiny skin, can begin. First, the patient is given a room of his own in Amok's compound. Then a diviner must determine which of the Amok people is to administer the treatment. That person must procure the necessary herbs and prepare the curative medicine that the afflicted person will receive orally and in the form of an enema. During the healing process, he is given only plantains and salt to eat. If it appears that the njom has not accepted the offering, which would occur, for example, if the thief had not returned all of his loot, Amok keeps the fee. The thief will have to pay again to free himself of his illness. All cases of this type conclude with the leader's returning the stolen money to its rightful owner. The latter turns to the medicine saying: "Amok, I have taken my money which was stolen, and then I sent you to war against the thief. May now the sacrifice be good and also the treatment that follows. Give back health to the victim." He then hands about ten percent of the stolen money to the leader, who may either keep it for him- self or divide it among the Amok members in his family. In order not to warn the witches unduly, prayers are sometimes dispensed with when Amok is activated. Ordinarily, however, Ojong spits on the lump of clay with alligator pepper and gives very detailed instructions: "Amok, I give you food. This man has invited you to guard and protect his house. Do the job for which you have been invited." Amok re- mains in the patient's house until he has got- ten well. No medical treatment is given, so his recovery indicates that the witches ceased their attacks out of fear of the njom. It is as- sumed that at this point the medicine also ceases to pursue the witches further, but this is not known exactly. The patient thus saved by Amok is not required to pay any additional fees. If the victim dies, Amok will persecute the witch mercilessly until she is destroyed, un- less the family of the witch is willing to replace the victim with one of its own children. After paying the customary high fees to the medicine, the witch must deliver the child: "I replace the bewitched person with this my own child. If I do this with two hearts, let the sacrifice not be effective. But if I give this child with one heart, let me go free from this medicine." An unusual situation occurred for the soci- ety in 1979, when the leader's house had to be torn down and rebuilt. That meant that the Amok objects also had to be renewed. During the initial phase, the magical herbs were col- lected and the lumps of clay made. On that day, the members were forbidden to eat and were allowed only palm wine to drink. Dur- ing the preceding night, they were required to abstain from sexual activity. Seven days later, when the clay had hardened, the objects were consecrated by the leader: "Ata Enowekuku and the other fathers, I have made with my brothers these various lumps. I invite you now to give power to them. This is the food, which I have brought for you, and this is the water and wine." After seven more days, this ceremony was repeated, and the lumps were rubbed with yellow camwood: "Amok, I am inviting you. A wicked man who does not want the other people to prosper-hunt such a person. If he spoils the blood of other per- sons, then spoil his own." Amok does not demand regular sacrifices and there is no way of killing it. If the family should cease to care for it, it will turn on them. The last category of njom to be discussed here is Okeboho, a society whose medicine consists of small bags (about 8 cm. high) woven of raffia fiber. Okeboho originated in Bali in the Cameroon Grassfields and proba- bly reached Kembong during the last century. Medicine societies having the same name are also found in Besongabang (near the Mamfe airport) and in Ajayukudip near Ewelle, a vil- lage west of Kembong. Supposedly Okeboho was purchased for the price of one woman and seven pounds, five shillings. A person selling medicine may ask only what he him- self paid for it, or else incur the wrath of the medicine. Formerly, Okeboho had many members, not only from Kembong but also from the sur- rounding villages. Currently the society, now headed by Agbor Enow, numbers only nine men. Some of the rituals can no longer be per- formed because the members who knew the herbs and the exact procedures of the cere- monies are now dead. Okeboho requires no regular sacrifices, but it is impossible to kill it. If all the members should die, the medicine will turn against their descendants. Their only recourse then would be to turn for help to other Okeboho societies outside the Kem- bong area that know the medicine and how to appease it. The society has two grades. At the first one, the initiation fees for new members consist of an "animal," a cock, a bottle of oil, a bunch of plantains, palm wine, and food. At the sec- ond level, which requires the same initiation fees, the members are taught the magical herbs and all the secrets. Upon the death of the leader, a diviner determines a successor from among the members of the second level. Not only does Okeboho have a secret forest, but it alone among the Kembong medicines also possesses a considerable "part of the night"; that is, important ceremonies take place under the cover of night, which is also the temporal realm of witches. The cere- monies include the most diverse irrational and mystical elements whose secrets even today remain inaccessible to the uninitiated. That performed by the leader of Okeboho when he sold one of the small medicine bags to the Linden-Museum could be regarded as one example of these mysterious rituals. The head of the society recounted that on that occasion, he went to the evil forest at night and, as is customary at all important events, played one of the four Okeboho pipes made from a crab claw.8 Subsequently, a python appeared and, after some moments, went into a coil. The leader, who had laid the money for the bag on the ground even before the snake had arrived, explained: "This is the money obtained from the white man who wants to take away one of your bags. He is not going to swear it, but to keep it only. If you want me to take the money, pick it up and throw it in front of me. But if you don't want me to use it, take it and go away with it." At this point he then addressed the Okeboho di- rectly: "Okeboho, I am sending you on a jour- 92</page><page sequence="7">ney. It is as if you were dead. So travel in peace. Let his (the white man's) neck or head never be painful. He has done as you wanted." At important ceremonies there are always four medicine specialists, each playing one of the pipes. The leader then swings the sacrifi- cial cock and begins the prayer: "Father of Okeboho, we have come to give you your own food, brought by Mr. X as we sacrificed in the day." Again the python appears and coils itself up. The leader throws the cock to the snake, and the medicine specialists leave the secret forest without turning or speaking. Ceremonies are also necessary whenever the raffia bags or the medicines in them are renewed. In both cases, a goat is sacrificed and its blood is allowed to flow over the bag. The medicine specialists spit on the bag with alligator pepper and sprinkle it with yellow camwood. Then the leader of Okeboho in- tones the following prayer: "If the man of the night (i.e., witch) who comes to the house where you, Okeboho, are, brings an ill inten- tion, any member in that household must go to war with him. But if he comes with no bad intention, leave him in peace." The swearing of this njom is similar to that in other medicine societies. Whoever requests Okeboho's aid must pay the society a jug of wine. Again, it is the society's leader who ac- tivates the medicine: "This is the person who has come to hire you for a thing which has happened. And now I want to send you with him." The leader then gives instructions to the person seeking help. Should he need to urinate on his way home, he must deposit the bag on the right side of the path and then uri- nate on the left side. Back at his compound, he must place the bag on the ground and appeal to the medicine: "The thief, the thief, the thief who has stolen my money If he brings the money back, as I have sworn this Okeboho against him, he should be set free. But if he hardens his heart and does not return the money, Okeboho shall go to war against him. His hand and leg shall be paralyzed." If the thief secretly returns the money to the com- pound of the person robbed, the latter must contact the head of Okeboho so that the medicine can be reconciled: "You were sent to war against the thief who stole this man's money Now the thief has feared your powers and has returned it. This is the money that I show you now. If the owner uses it now, whether for marrying or for buying an article, let nothing happen to him." Okeboho is then given as much of the money as is needed to buy the ingredients for a meal that will be prepared in the secret forest: a goat, a cock, an "animal," a bottle of oil, pepper, salt, a bunch of plantains, and a jug of wine. Before pepper and salt are added, Okeboho receives its share. A part of the food is laid down in front of the large palm-wine pot (such pots are less common among the Ejagham than in the Grassfields): "Okeboho, this is your food we have come to give to you. It has been given to Mr. X whose money was stolen and which was now returned. We now come to consult and inform you not to go to war again." The meal must be eaten not in the secret forest but at a remote farm. If the thief does not return the money and is stricken ill by Okeboho, he will be forced to capitulate anyway, and the medicine will have to be appeased: "Mr. X who has been caught by you has confessed to us that he did such a bad thing, and now we want to undertake treatment. If you want us to carry out the treatment, let the oracle tell us." Should Okeboho reject the offering, all of the fees are left behind in the bush and the thief is told to consult a diviner, who must determine which of Okeboho's demands were not complied with. The ceremony is repeated in the hope that it will be accepted so that treatment can begin: "Okeboho, you caught this man because he had stolen Mr. X's money He has confess- ed and has paid back the money And now he wants you to heal him. So come out of him. If a child commits a crime, it is punished; the crime is forgotten. So come out of him and let him be healed." Medicinal herbs and palm kernel oil are mixed in a coconut shell. The medicine is rubbed into the cuts on the repen- tant thief's hands as well as on his cheek- bones, for those persecuted by Okeboho often lose the power of speech. This treatment is repeated seven times every other day for a period of seven weeks. Should the thief fail to confess, Okeboho will eventually kill him. If the crime is murder, Okeboho will unques- tionably punish the culprit with death; that is the law of this particular medicine. ED The second part of this article, on the mask-medicine Obasinjom, will appear in a future issue. This project was carried out with the permission of the Na- tional Office for Scientific and Technical Research, Yaounde. I am greatly indebted to the Rev. Peter Ayukachale, who acted as my interpreter and accompanied me for the dura- tion of my work. His personal connections in Kembong facilitated my research enormously, and perhaps even made it possible. I also wish to express my gratitude to the leaders of the medicine societies whose support made this research possible, especially Tanyiashu, who was the head of Obasinjom-Kembong at the time and who received us daily Lastly, I wish to thank Margrit Schatz, Weissach im Tal, for the English translation. 1. Our collections from this region then consisted of a number of skin-covered masks and anthropomorphic fig- ures, and we hoped to complement these holdings with traditional household goods as well as objects typical of the colonial and postcolonial eras. With the aid and permission of the Cameroon Ministry of Information and Culture, I was able to collect a total of eighty-eight objects. I was further able to study the women's organization Mbokandem, noted for the monumental concrete figures it erects to commemorate deceased members. These figures can be found in villages across large sections of the Cross River region. The findings of this study will also be pub- lished. 2. It should be added that it was not possible for me to study the plants that are essential to the making of medicines. Aside from the short amount offime available to me in the field, this would have required special botani- cal and pharmacological knowledge I do not have. Above all, such a study would have touched on important secrets that might have jeopardized the whole project. Moreover, I do not believe that botanical data would necessarily have much bearing on this discussion. 3. That research project was made possible by support from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. Its findings are in- tended for publication in a larger volume under the tenta- tive title "World View and Society in Oku (Cameroon Grasslands)." Since the subject of this paper is Ejagham medicines, the Oku material used here for comparison and illustration has of necessity been kept short. The proposed Oku study will discuss in depth the phenomena of medicines and witchcraft in that region. 4. Important source material can be found in Mansfeld (1908) and in Ruel's work (1969) on the Banyang, neighbors of the Cameroon Ejagham. 5. For convenience, witches among the Ejagham will be hereafter designated as female in this paper. 6. Autopsies were also common in areas north of the Grassfields; Gebauer describes those of the Kaka, for example (1964: 34). 7. Talbot gives detailed descriptions of the bisexual creator god of the "Ekoi," which also appears as two separate en- tities: the male Sky God, Obassi Osaw, and the female Earth God, Obassi Nsi (1912: 13ff, 44). 8. The sacred musical instruments are less common among the Ejagham than in the Grassfields, where they are indis- pensable at all important ceremonies and many medicine rituals. According to Talbot, among the "Ekoi" the pipes made of crab claws had an important function in cere- monies, but unlike the "dangerous" musical instruments of the Grassfields, these could also be played in public (Tal- bot 1912: 55ff., 62ff., 197ff.).
