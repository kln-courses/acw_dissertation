ISBN 3-406-50565-1 (cloth). Objects require a definable provenance if they are to be understood for what they were. This is a truism of archaeology often invoked by those who deplore the modern business of collecting antiquities. In the case of Greek painted pottery, however, it remains a principle more easily called upon for the sake of sanctimonious effect than applied in pursuit of scientific results. The archaeological context of many sur- viving examples of figured vases "made in Greece" during the sixth and fifth centuries B.C.E. is, typically, an Etruscan tomb. Yet no one supposes that all these vases were originally created by Greek artisans for deposition as Etruscan grave goods. A plausible case has been made for certain produc- ers (notably Nikosthenes of Athens) devising some kind of export strategy for a range of ceramic shapes and certain batches of vessels being decorated as if to suit Etruscan taste (e.g., the so-called Tyrrhenian amphoras). The possibility that immigrant Greek craftsmen set up workshops in Etruria remains attractive for particular stylistic groupings (e.g., the "Caeretan hydriae") . Nonetheless, it is an undeniable fact of archaeological circumstance that vases produced in Greek city-states have been found mostly at a distinct remove from their first destination. They are, in other words, the dislocated spoils of an ancient antiquities market. 1 Webster 1972. 2Osborne2001. The economic history of this situation is not beyond ex- planation. Vases decorated for the sake of Greek festivals or social institutions, primarily the symposium, accrued value in Etruria as secondhand goods. This was the hypothesis firmly advanced by Webster in his Potter and Painter in Clas- sical Athens * - a hypothesis that met with some misgivings among scholars when first broadcast but that has never been refuted (so far as I know) with any enthusiasm. It does not necessarily imply that Etruscans accepted "job lots" of assorted Greek pottery from trans-Mediterranean traders; a case can be made for Etruscan discrimination regarding not only shapes but also types of decorative subject matter.2 New and used vases may well have been loaded together, amid a generally mixed cargo of goods; evidence from shipwrecks indicates that painted vessels were traded as items with their own worth, not as containers of consumer goods.3 But beyond the economics of this exchange, the issue of iconographic communication remains difficult to fathom. Many vases made thejourney westward. Yet, how much did the Etruscan owners of Greek-made vessels comprehend the imagery on those vases? Two catalogues of the Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum, plus a supplementary volume to the same series, offer fresh cause for posing that speculative question - and some hope, I think, of supplying an answer. Of the two catalogues, one is dominated by vases with a certain provenance: the 90-odd Athenian black-figure eye cups in Munich, 70% of which were retrieved from the tombs around Vulci during the early 19th century. Mostly purchased by King Ludwig I of Bavaria in 1831, and a number of them broken when the Antikensammlungen were bombed by the Royal Air Force in 1944, these drinking implements may indeed be said to have come a long way from the symposium tables of sixth-century Athens. The Mannheim catalogue presents a more heterogeneous assemblage, including many pieces recently purchased from the Swiss auction houses and therefore in denial of provenance; nonetheless, we may assume a similar proportion of Etruscan findspots. And it might be said that, overall, no great iconographic problems were once posed by these objects to their Etruscan keepers. A Mannheim kylix signed by Nikosthenes displays a pair of large eyes on its exterior; inside are a simple horse and rider. It is hard to imagine any hermeneutic crisis being created in Etruria by such imagery. A substantial number of the Munich cups feature broadly Dionysiac themes. Again, these would appear suitable enough for a wine-drinking society well integrated within the trade routes of the archaic Mediterranean. So it may be perverse, when presented with 3 Johnston 1991, 218. 659 American Journal of Archaeology 110 (2006) 659-61</page><page sequence="2">660 NIGEL SPIVEY [AJA110 the artificial assemblage of data constituting this or that CVA, to seize upon items of "special interest" and turn them into case studies of a general process. But if we indulge that temptation, then empathizing with an Etruscan viewer becomes a challenge once more. Of Munich's best-known and most delightful kylix - signed by Exekias, with central motif of Dionysos abroad on the wine-dark sea, dolphins sporting in his wake - it is possible to remain cautious about supposing any implicit reference here to the tale of Dionysos and the Tyrrhenian pirates, as recounted in the seventh Homeric Hymn. Fellmann's com- mentary allows the piece to be free of such poetic resonance, though it is demonstrable that some inhabitants of Vulci in the late sixth century B.C.E. appear to have known about "the Tuscan mariners transformed,"4 and intuitively one wants to credit Exekias with a rhapsode's skill. Faced with another Late Archaic cup (inv. no. 2085), however, we cannot permit this sort of ambiguity. It is unat- tributed, though its shape looks distinctly Nikosthenic, and its publication history indicates that modern connoisseurs have been chiefly impressed by the landscape features of its exterior scene, which evokes an olive grove. However, this olive grove is merely the setting for an action that at first sight is not easy to recognize. A male figure, apparently absorbed in some task, is stooping over a mysterious object. Though the figure is unbearded, it looks as though Herakles is intended, to judge by the knotty club propped nearby. So what is Herakles doing here? Only by close scrutiny, plus the application of mythological priming, can we surmise that the mysterious object is a lion, flipped on its back, with its hind legs attached to the trunk of a tree. It seems that here we have a representation of Herakles flaying the Nemean lion, prior (presumably) to assuming its pelt as a trophy of wres- tling with the beast - which challenge to the young hero was conventionally reckoned as the first of his Twelve Labors. To say "conventionally reckoned" begs several questions, including, naturally, the problem of assessing how far Etruscans shared in what might be termed the "intellectual property" of the Greeks. Say that a surviving Greek text (in this case, Bacchyl. Epinikian 9, though the poem contains merely an allusion to "the first of Herakles' Labors") gives proof that the tale of Herakles vs. the Nemean Lion was in panhellenic circulation not long after this vase was made in Athens, and that may be enough to claim the possibil- ity that Hellenized Etruscans were familiar with the story. But would knowing the story be sufficient to interpret the scene depicted here? As Fellmann notes, in the eyes of one modern expert (Frank Brommer) , it appeared that Herak- les here was shown disemboweling the lion. To say that is a Misverstandnis perhaps overemphasizes the technicalities of ancient taxidermy; yet, error is forgivable, given the absence of any iconographical tradition regarding this aspect of the heroic deed. As it happens, there is not much of a textual tradition either; Bacchylides (13.53) again knew about the lion's invulnerability, but the most eloquent literary rendition of the myth - a "Herakles Leontophonos" of the third century B.C.E. , loosely ascribed to Theocritus - relates no more than 4 Spivey and Rasmussen 1986. 5 Moretti Sgubini 1999. the fastidious logic whereby an invulnerable lion could only be skinned by using its own claws (Theoc. Id. 25, 272-79). One could pursue a particular line of investigation about the popularity of Herakles in archaic Etruria, in particular at Cerveteri, where Livy (22.1.10) was aware of a fons Herculis, a cult site that, according to recent excavations, seems to have been located in the Sant'Antonio area of the ancient city. Etruscans made dedications to Herakles (Hercle) here, using Attic vases, among other votive objects. It is probable that the large kylix attributed to Onesimos, with its austere evocation of the Sack of Troy, was one such vase.5 Inscriptions attest to not only a local but a sophisticated understanding of Greek-painted images and their divine associations. Witness the red-figure column krater found in 1994 near an altar at Pyrgi, the port of Cerveteri, showing Herakles as a symposiast and carrying an invocation of Fufluns, the Etruscan Dionysos.6 For present purposes, however, the essential point to make is one of general principle: that Greek painted pottery was not only treasured by the Etruscans for deposition with their dead but was also put to regular use within the society of the living. Several years ago, this principle was one of the conclu- sions that Christoph Reusser drew from his painstaking survey of the functional circumstances of Athenian vases found at Etruscan sites.7 Now Reusser, in alliance with Martin Bentz, has gathered further evidence from throughout Etruria to support his thesis that imported "fine wares" meant much more than just grave goods to the Etruscans. These vases circulated with various domestic and religious purposes - for which factors of shape might be no less important than factors of decoration (and perhaps rather more so). A considerable amount of material is presented in this CVA supplement, and, as with a new CVA, there is fresh temptation to single out pieces of particular iconographical interest. For example, there is the fragmentary red-figure kylix, "late Douris" in style, which may show Theseus in combat with the Pallantids - a vase from the settlement at Gonfienti, near Prato. Or else it may be the recognition of an identifiable "hand" that attracts our attention; thus, from the habitation at Castellina del Marangone, just to the south of Civitavecchia, one cup fragment attributed to Euphronios and another to Makron. These painters are old friends to the modern connoisseur of Athenian pottery. Did rustic Etruscans regard them so affectionately? But to focus on such pieces is pure favoritism. The essays gathered by Reusser and Bentz are topographically inclu- sive from Etruria Padana (Adria and hinterland) to Pyrgi, encompassing finds from Marzabotto, Pisa, and Volterra. Though there are some obvious gaps in the coverage - nota- bly Tarquinia, Veii, and Cerveteri - the spread and quantity of material are telling. Of course, few vessels are preserved in anything like an integral state, and the proportion of fine to coarse wares at habitation sites is not always clear. Impressionistically, however, the overall picture appears to support a distinct pattern of morphological bias. The bias is evident from the very first essay of the volume, an assessment by Maria Cristina Vallicelli of the relics of Attic black-figure recovered from the urban area of Adria (the Bocchi collec- 6 Maggiani 1997, 85-98. 7 Reusser 2002.</page><page sequence="3">2006] GREEK VASES IN ETRURIA 661 tion) . Of the finds, 40% in this assemblage are kylikes; if one includes skyphoi, the preponderance of drinking cups rises to over 70%. The ensuing essay (by Frederica Wiel-Marin) is a consideration of red-figure material from the same center; again, a similar pattern is apparent. Moving inland by some 15 km, we are then introduced (by Maurizio Harari) to the excavation of San Cassiano, an archaic farmstead in the chora of Adria. Here it is possible to quantify a small proportion of Attic fine ware when matched against local coarse pottery. But again there is evidence to reveal a preference for drink- ing vessels - and evidence sufficient to make a further claim with regard to Etruscan habits. The custom of using imported vases was not confined to the coastal cities or emporia where such objects might be easily acquired in the general flow of mercantile exchange. Refined sympotic practice extended into Etruria's agricultural hinterland, while along the coast, relatively minor sites such as Castellina del Marangone (here presented by Irma Wehgartner) inform us that objects from the leading exponents of Athenian vase painting were part of the Lebenswirklichkeit of provincial Etruscans. In a sense there is nothing to surprise us about this pat- tern - especially if we remember the Greek historical tradi- tion, voiced from the fourth century B.C.E. onward, regarding the tryphe of Etruscan everyday life. Say that an Etruscan elite routinely indulged themselves en potois with vases that the Greeks reserved for special occasions, and one can almost hear the ghosts of Theopompus and Poseidonius muttering, "We told you so." But it does oblige us to readdress the ques- tion of how far the images on Athenian vases were "used" by their Etruscan viewers. For example, the inhabitants of the oikos at San Cassiano had at their disposal a large cup - it was a one-handled kantharos, probably - and it looks as if on this cup there was a scene of Apollo at large, near the palm tree of his birth on Delos, and Dionysos ensconced on a couch, possibly related to his union with Ariadne on Naxos. At one level (Dionysos on the couch) we can understand how this image made sense to its barbarian users; as for the further resonance of Cycladic mythology, we can only guess. But since such vases were also considered appropriate as votive dedications at sanctuaries where Etruscans worshipped dei- ties with names and anthropomorphic identities similar to their Greek counterparts, it is natural to suppose that this mythology was not wholly arcane. Scholars will divide between those who remain skeptical of Etruscan "acculturation" to this extent and those (this reviewer among them) who are inclined to see the poetics of Greek art operating effectively in Etruria. But it seems to me now untenable to take the view that the Etruscan taste for Greek painted pottery was a phenomenon comparable to later European fashions or fetishes for objets d'art from China or Japan, prized as "exotic" but hardly understood on their own terms.8 Volume after volume of the CVA series is packed with Greek vases extracted from Etruscan tombs. The significance of the Reusser-Bentz supplement is to make clear that the final destination of these objects simply reflects a local social practice. When Etruscans furnished their tombs, it was their ideological principle of design to provide the dead with a home away from home. Ultimately, then, fine Greek vases were put in Etruscan tombs because they were Etruscan domestic goods.
