<plain_text><page sequence="1">IMAGE AND STRUCTURE IN HAWTHORNE'S "ROGER MALVIN'S BURIAL" PATRICIA ANN CARLSON Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology "Roger Malvin's Burial" (Token, 1832) is one of the earliest and, at the same time, one of the most complex of Hawthorne's major tales. The richness of its thematic content is suggested by H. H. Waggoner's remarks about the tale and its conclusion: These closing words of the story, like the Biblical allusions throughout, make it clear that a reading of the tale in terms of both primitive religious myth and the historical and theo- logical aspects of creedal Christianity are as clearly justified as the psychological reading is. Oedipus and the sacrificial savior loom in the background of this tale whose foreground is fashioned out of colonial history and the nature and effects of concealed guilt. Original Sin and the Atonement are as clearly involved in Reuben Bourne's story, as are the psychology of guilt and the demands of the unconscious.1 Such multiplicity of interpretive levels makes an essentially mono- lithic examination (which is the nature of this study) appear un- satisfying and simplistic. Nevertheless, the images established in the setting are efficacious in all facets of the tale, and, because of this pervasiveness, have a certain authority and autonomy which justifies their being considered without constant reference to the "pagan-Christian-historical-theological-psychological"2 amalgama- tion of its theme. One of the best examinations, to date, of scenic properties as functional images in "Roger Malvin's Burial" is Virginia O. Bird- sall's "Hawthorne's Oak Tree Image," which analyzes the oak tree as the locus for horizontal unification of the dramatic-narrative structure as well as for vertical unification of the levels of mean- ing. Though brief, Birdsall's article gives a wealth of interpretive insight-far too much to be adequately recounted here. Her find- ings, nevertheless, complement this study. She says that the "tree functions most obviously . . . in unifying the tale on the level of direct action. Here it is simply a tree-a natural phenomenon rooted at that point in the forest where the narrative action begins, later useful to Reuben as a marker, and at the end of the narra- tive, still rooted at the same spot."3 As the story progresses, Bird- sall notes, the author loads the image with mythic, religious, and psychological implication. "The fact that Hawthorne insistently makes the tree an oak and not one of 'the pines which were the usual growth of the land'" (p. 182) is very significant; "historically</page><page sequence="2">Hawthorne and mythologically, the oak has always been a symbol of strength . . ." (p. 182). Furthermore, as the tale evolves it becomes "apparent how intimately the oak tree is tied in with the rest of the tale's complex Biblical allusions" (p. 182). Finally, the oak is an objec- tive correlative for the physical and psychological character of Reuben. When the youth ties the bloody rag to the branch, he interlocks the destiny of the tree with that of his own life. Eighteen years later, at the very moment of Reuben's expiation, "the with- ered topmost bough of the oak loosen[s] itself in the stilly air, and [falls] in soft, light fragments upon the rock, upon the leaves, upon Reuben, upon his wife and child, and upon Roger Malvin's bones"4 in an anthropomorphic gesture of blessing. This correlation is carried out not only in the actions but also in the verbal texture of Hawthorne's parallel descriptions of Reuben and the oak. As Birdsall comments, "like Reuben himself, it [the tree] was intro- duced into the tale as 'a young and vigorous sapling,' although 'far, indeed, from its maturity'" (p. 182). Virginia Birdsall's critique isolates and evaluates two aspects of the functional setting in Hawthorne's art of fiction. First, scenic elements very often dictate the narrative contour of a tale. Second, a correlation between dramatis persona and environment is a viable device for expanding and explaining characterization. But she has by no means covered every use of the setting in the tale for establishing metaphor and image. An additional major tech- nique accruing from the functional setting is the structuring re- verberation of the rock-grave image. For the granite out-cropping is the primary scenic property to determine the dramatic and symbolic lines of "Roger Malvin's Burial." Like the maypole in "The Maypole of Merry Mount," it looms above all the important events of the story, and when the action of the plot wanders from beneath its shadow, the dramatic intensity is lost. Most important, like the scaffold in The Scarlet Letter, the periodic and sequential recurrence of this central image composes the organic evolution and the dramatic development of the tale. The rock, and the multiple symbolic connotations which Haw- thorne rings upon the image, sends out tendrils through the whole of this tale. However, if one examines the motif carefully, it be- comes evident that this germinal image appears only in three specific and well-defined portions of the five-part structure of the story. A diagram will show this more clearly. (See page 5.) But even this linear summation does not illustrate how func- tional the tripartite division of the rock image is to the structure of the tale. The static surface of a page and the fixidity of the printed word cannot adequately capture the fluid motion generated by the position and development of these three reverberations of 4</page><page sequence="3">South Atlantic Bulletin Narrative Content I.

Yet, if one can imagine a revolving equilateral triangle-a flowing quasi-geometrical figure of interpretive criticism in which each apex passes the force of thematic gravity on to its adjacent side, in a clockwise direction-then one will have some idea of how the scenically-created structural dynamics of this tale operate. X-I Introduction (Reality) X-II Median (Mental Image) X-III Finale (Reality) Disregarding the narrator's historical introduction, the tale actually begins with a topographical passage in the second section, not the least part of which is the ominous rock (X-I). "The mass of granite, rearing its smooth, flat surface fifteen or twenty feet above their heads, was not unlike a gigantic gravestone, upon which the veins seemed to form an inscription in forgotten characters" (V. 133). In this one sentence Hawthorne inserts three important levels of meaning for the rock. First, it is.given a physical descrip- Rock Setting Image New England history. X-I X-II X-III 5</page><page sequence="4">Hawthorne tion. Second, its foreboding likeness to a gravestone is introduced. This figurative transformation will be reiterated with such force that the syimbolic image becomes the controlling metaphor of the tale. Third, the enigmatic "inscription," which will later be ex- panded to suggest the graven tablets of the Ten Commandments, constitutes the first Biblical allusion in the tale. These three characteristics-physical, figurative, allusive-are continued through the whole of section II. Physically, the size of the rock establishes it as the primary property of the landscape. Its centrality makes it the milestone for measuring and delineating the dimensions of the environment. "On a tract of several acres around this rock, oaks and other hard-wood trees had supplied the place of the pines. . ." (V, 133). Furthermore, the rock, in this section, has a utilitarian function; it becomes a stepping stone for Reuben to reach the upper branch of the young oak. Other salient physical attributes of the rock are included near the end of this section. The reader learns that one side of the boulder is "rough and broken" (V, 141), in contrast to its even, flat front. Also, "every part of the rock, except its broad, smooth front, [is] concealed at a little distance by the dense undergrowth of the forest" (V, 141). Such minute, seemingly inconsequential details are "artistic plants" -like small imagistic sensors implanted in the reader's mind, they will set up a complex pattern of reverberating elements when the thrust of the figurative design in the story returns to a memory of section II in the delineation of section V. The concept of the burial of the dead is fundamental to the tale, and it spans the gamut from title to theme in "Roger Malvin's Burial." Reuben Bourne's sin is not that he left Roger to die alone in the forest but that he concealed this fact from the comlnunity- making it impossible for him to return and redeem his pledge by burying the body of his father-in-law. Hence, Hawthorne finds it essential to retain the grave inage-in either a literal or figurative form-before the reader's consciousness in order to structure plot, sustain suspense, and amplify theme. The figurative and allusive metamorphosis of the rock into a gravestone is repeated numerous times in section II. Rather than being just an ornament of description or an adjunct to the tone, this image has the practical responsibility of providing a toluchstone for the unfolding of the piece. The vacillating emotions and moti- vations in the debate between Reuben and Roger emi)loy the rock- grave configuration as a vehicle of statement. Roger, having re- signed himself to die in the wilderness, tries to convince Reuben to leave him: "Reuben, my boy . . . this rock beneath which we sit will serve for an old hunter's gravestone" (V, 134). To which the unyielding Reuben replies, "1 will dig a grave here by the rock, 6</page><page sequence="5">South Atlantic Bulletin in which, if my weakness overcome me, we will rest together . . ." (V, 136). Roger's rejoinder is, again, couched in terms of the figura- tive gravestone: "For a monument, here is the gray rock, on which my dying hand shall carve the name of Roger Malvin. . ." (V, 136). And, having persuaded Reuben to leave, Roger abandons all pre- tense that he will survive until help arrives and extracts a promise from the young man to return: "when your wounds are healed and your weariness refreshed, -return to this wild rock. . ." (V, 142). The second functional appearance of the rock (X-II) occurs in section III. This time it is not the physical presence of the granite boulder but the oppressive weight it exerts on Reuben's guilty conscience that is emphasized. Having returned to the community alone and married Dorcas, Reuben is plagued by vague and haunt- ing fears which threaten to disturb his mental balance. The rock, as a token of an unredeemed pledge, has been absorbed and assimi- lated into Reuben's consciousness, thereby gaining the freedom inherent in an articulate mental image to appear whenever sum- moned by the powers of Reuben's own guilt. By a certain association of ideas, he at times almost imagined himself a murderer. For years, also, a thought would occasion- ally recur, which, though he perceived all its folly and extrav- agance, he had not power to banish from his mind. It was a haunting and torturing fancy that his father-in-law was yet sitting at the foot of the rock, on the withered forest leaves, alive, and awaiting his pledged assistance. These mental decep- tions, however, came and went, nor did he ever mistake them for realities; but in the calmest and clearest moods of his mind he was conscious that he had a deep vow unredeemed, and that an unburied corpse was calling to him out of the wilderness. (V, 149) The rock, which had a physical, figurative, and allusive develop- ment in section II, further gains in thematic resonance; having served as a gravestone, a milestone, a stepping stone, and a touch- stone, it now becomes a lodestone drawing first Reuben's mind and later his very being to the locus of his unfulfilled vow. Neither did he know where in the pathless and illimitable forest to seek that smooth and lettered rock at the base of which the body lay; his remembrance of every portion of his travel thence was indistinct, and the latter part had left no impression upon his mind. There was, however, a continual impulse, a voice audible only to himself, commanding him to go forth and re- deem his vow; and he had a strange impression that, were he to make the trial, he would be led straight to Malvin's bones. (V, 150) 7</page><page sequence="6">Hawthorne From this mental landscape and its compulsive influence, the force of the image draws the story back to the locale of the intro- ductory scene. With an eerie sense of deji vu, the reader "watches" as the author sets about reduplicating the rnise en scene preparatory for the dark necessity of the working out of Reuben's guilt. The first scenic echoes and intimations that the family has "inadver- tently" returned to the same place in the forest are very inconspic- uous and likely to go unnoticed on the first reading. In describing the campground where Dorcas arranges the evening meal, Haw- thorne mentions the twilight atmosphere: "The sunshine yet lin- gered upon the higher branches of the trees that grew on rising ground. . ." (V, 161). This half-light is a parallel of the first line of section II in which dawn finds the two wounded men lying at the foot of the rock while "the early sunbeams [hover] cheerfully upon the tree-tops. . ." (V, 133). The rising terrain also indicates that the family has returned full circle because the rock was de- scribed in the opening scene as being "situated near the summit of one of the gentle swells by which the face of the country is there diversified" (V, 133). The introduction of the rock in this section is slow and calcu- lated in order to increase the suspense of the situation; Hawthorne nurtures the development of this section as if it were a dark, slow- blooming flower. Dorcas, while looking for her son, approaches the outcropping from its opposite side-the facet which was previously depicted as "rough and broken." "Once she imagined that he [Cyrus] stood beckoning to her at the base of a craggy rock" (V, 163). The physical representation is consistent; Hawthorne-in this sec- tion-is playing upon the remembered image of section II in order to generate dramatic intensity. Slowly Dorcas makes her "way round the foot of the rock" (V, 163) to find the spectacle of horror which the reader instinctively knows is there. The rock undergoes yet one more metaphorical transformation: it becomes the altar stone for a ritualistic blood sacrifice to an Old Testament God. In the finale, the tableau vivant ending the tale, the rock is again the dominant scenic component. The posture of the bodies at its foot is an exact duplication of the two wounded men as they appeared eighteen years previously, only this time Cyrus replaces Reuben and the stillness is one of death and not of weariness. The rock, which was initially a figurative tombstone, has fulfilled its destiny by becoming an actual monument to the dead. NOTES 1.
