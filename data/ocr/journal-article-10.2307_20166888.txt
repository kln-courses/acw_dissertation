Under six feet of water in the Acula River they chanced upon a four-ton carved basalt stela bearing over four hundred glyphs in an unknown script that is both different from and prior to the glyphic script of the Classic Maya. Pulled from the river with some difficulty, the stela was brought to the museum in Xalapa for storage and scrutiny, and was named La Mojarra Stela 1 after a settlement on the Acula River near the site of discovery. Because of its provenience and its text, as well as the image its surface bears, it has been justly called "one of the most important carved monuments ever found in Mesoamerica" (Stuart 1993:259). A preliminary description and illustrations of the newly discovered La Mojarra Stela 1 were published, and the stela was dated by means of its own inscriptions to the middle of the second century A.D. (Winfield 1988). Additional efforts to interpret the text and image have been made by Barthel and von Winning (1989, 1991), Meluzin (1987), Stross (1990), Stross and Reilly (1991), Macri (1990), and Anderson (1991). A very recent and methodologically impressive decipherment of significant portions of the La Mojarra text published by Justeson and Kaufman argues that the language is Zoquean and not Mixean (1993). Iconographie evidence presented here suggests also that the language is Mixe-Zoquean, but Mixean is slightly favored. Mixe-Zoquean languages are of particular interest in Mesoamerica because they probably descend from and reflect the language of the Olmecs living in Middle Preclassic Mesoamerica (Campbell and Kaufman 1976). Regardless of which of these related languages underlies the stela's text, the iconography is useful for generating hypotheses concerning the worldview as well as the language of the people. The stela shows a standing ruler holding a weapon, his costume and headdress literally covered with symbols of power (fig. 1). At the very peak of his headdress is a maize plant depicted as?or transformed into?a shark, with a curved blade for a fin and a twin maize ear for a tail; it has resisted identification as such until now, although one part of it was correctly called a knife blade, and another a rope (Winfield Capitaine 1988:9) (fig. 2). This shark image can be placed in the context of selected other Late Preclassic artifacts (approximately 300 b.c. to a.D. 200). The shark and surrounding imagery are interpreted as tentative evidence that the language of this stela could be Mixean or Zoquean, because symbolism inherent in the iconography suggests through visual punning verbal analogues allowable in a Mixe-Zoquean language. Nearly contemporaneous imagery found elsewhere in Mesoamerica on the Hauberg Stela (fig.3), carved by Mayans in the Guatemalan Peten near the end of the second century A.D., facilitates interpretation of ?mages on La Mojarra Stela 1. The Hauberg Stela depicts four miniature individuals descending from a vision serpent. Figure 2. Shark on La Mojarra Stela 1. Detail from Winfield Capitaine 1988:8, fig. 8. Drawing: George Stuart.

They are shown as ancestral maize deities, having headdresses representing four stages in the life cycle of maize, whereas the ruler's headdress represents a culminating fifth stage: the stage of the ripe corn ear. Similar representations of maize growth stages can be inferred on La Mojarra Stela 1 by structural comparison with the Hauberg Stela. For the final fifth stage, the Hauberg uses a single maize ear in the ruler's headdress and a figurative maize stalk?depicted as a serpent?in his hands to symbolize visually his power. For the final stage, La Mojarra Stela 1 employs twinned maize ears on a maize stalk?pictured as a shark?in the ruler's headdress, and a weapon in his hand, to reference his power. In addition to these pictorial examples of the connection between power and maize, Mayan divinatory day-names reflect stages in the life cycle of maize and, therefore, suggest the importance of maize symbolism in elite ritual practices. Because humans, in the Mesoamerican view, derive from maize, it is appropriate that a Maya ruler should reflect on his person representative stages of maize growth. A similar perception of the importance of maize is articulated on La Mojarra Stela 1, which celebrates the ruler's power and his accession to office. Recognition of the importance of maize in rulership has significant implications for maize identification in several Mesoamerican images where it has remained previously unrecognized. I. The shark and the maize plant The frontal head ornament on top of the La Mojarra Stela 1 ruler's headdress is an anthropomorphic profile head that is structurally equivalent to the contemporaneous Late Preclassic Maya tripointed "Jester God" diadem on the Dumbarton Oaks Pectoral (fig. 1; fig. 4); it is a symbol of kingship (Freidel and Schele 1988:552-555). Behind this frontal ornament is a long-lipped zoomorph that is identifiable as a shark. The Dumbarton Oaks Pectoral also has a similar long lipped zoomorph occupying the same structural position in the headdress. Although it has been referred to as a "personified world tree, the axis mundi" because of its positioning and the three leaves in which its tail terminates (Schele and Miller 1986:120), this zoomorph also might be considered a shark from the characteristic underslung mouth, even without an obvious fin like the one on La Mojarra Stela 1. In a similar manner, Late Preclassic Kaminaljuyu Stela 11 depicts a ruler whose head is topped with a</page><page sequence="4">Stross: Maize and Fish 13 Figure 4. Dumbarton Oaks Pectoral. From Schele and Miller 1986:119, pi. 32a. personified tree, the base of which is a similar, though not so long-lipped, zoomorph (fig. 5). This zoomorph is being scooped up by a raptorial bird, just as an osprey might catch a fish, and the place where the hooked talon penetrates the fin is given iconographie realism by two dark patches representing blood. If the zoomorphic monsters from Kaminaljuyu Stela 11 and the Dumbarton Oaks Pectoral are compared to the shark atop the ruler's headdress at La Mojarra, it is evident that all could be depictions of sharks, or derived from older depictions of sharks. The shark on La Mojarra Stela 1 has body parts that serve dual semantic functions in a visual sense. Its fin doubles as a knife blade whose curved shape is similar to knives from Teotihuacan (fig. 6); its tail doubles as uneven twin maize ears, analogous to the asymmetrically bifid tail of a real shark (fig. 7). The fin (knife blade) is linked to the shark's tail (maize ears) by a notochord (rope or umbilicus) on which four baby sharks swim up. Three pairs of blood droplets (or another sacred substance) drip from the notochord, and seven more pairs of the same circlets drip from the maize ears, for a total of twenty, the number of days in the Mesoamerican divinatory "month." The rope is Figure 5. Kaminaljuyu Stela 11, detail of ruler's head and diving bird. From Schele and Miller 1986:109, figure II.2. umbilical in appearance and may represent the symbolically crucial blood link between maize, fish, and the human to whose head these elements are attached for display. Blood, fish, and maize Mayan and other Mesoamerican traditions allege that humans of the present era have been created from maize and autosacrificial blood, whereas previous eras saw ancestral humans transformed into fish during a great flood. Thus, maize, and before that fish, are both human ancestors. Highland Quiche Mayans of Guatemala, for example, in their sacred book the Popol Vuh make explicit the transformational linkage between humans and maize and between humans and fish, in the personages of the "Hero Twins"; they are replaced by maize in the middle world while they visit the underworld, and transformed into channel catfish after having had their bones ground and thrown into the river before reappearing as young men (Tedlock 1985). Moreover, Huastec Mayans, living north of Veracruz, believe that in a previous era human ancestors drowned and became fish during a flood (Alcorn 1984:60).</page><page sequence="5">14 RES 25 SPRING 1994 Figure 6.

This "living rope" (as Mayans call it) holds the "baby" (twin maize ears) face down in relation to the shark "mother" (cornstalk). Drops of blood (circlets) fall from the cord and around the maize ears, and one end of the cord abuts a stone knife. This iconography recalls the Chorti, Tzotzil, and Pocomam Mayan practices of cutting the human newborn's umbilical cord over a maize ear, which, having received the dripping blood, is then planted in a special divinatory cornfield, or milpa, which is called by the Tzotzil the "child's blood" (Edmonson 1971:108, 121 ? 122; Guiteras Holmes 1960:6; Taube 1985).1 Much additional evidence demonstrates that the Maya and other Mesoamericans of the past and present conceived of maize and blood as both sacred and essentially synonymous (Stross 1992). The Late Postclassic Yucatec Paris Codex (dating to the fifteenth century or earlier) reinforces the iconography of the umbilicus on La Mojarra Stela with its descending young maize deity and umbilical cords (fig. 8a), as does the sixteenth-century Aztec Codex Vatican A, which depicts Xochiquetzal as a maize deity falling from the sky amidst maize; she grasps bicolored (umbilical) cords wreathed and terminating in flowers (fig. 8b). Significantly, Tzotzil Mayans and Aztecs symbolically equated the flower with blood (Laughlin 1962). These scenes of "falling" may be representations of the descent of the solar deity to fertilize the earth in producing maize (Pasztory 1983:57), and possibly symbolic versions of the sacrifice of the lower of two maize ears on the developing maize stalk at the stage called "face down," so that the upper maize ear can reach maximum size.2 Maize Maize symbolism appears in the shark's pectoral fins, which also function as ear pendants; these are almost identical to the ear pendants worn by deity heads on the Late Preclassic Pomona Flare and can be interpreted as symbolizing different stages of maize growth (Stross 1990). Maize symbolism can be found also in the tri pointed vegetation tied with a knot where the maize ears emerge and where the knife pokes up from the shark's shoulder; this vegetation appears to represent maize leaves. It is precisely such a tripointed element that surmounts and frames the face of the Maya "Jester God" in the Dumbarton Oaks Pectoral, declaring the wearer of that face to be the ruler; Fields has elegantly demonstrated that the iconographie heritage of the Maya "Jester God" includes development through a complex of maize iconography originating among the Olmec (1989:18).3 In fact, the whole La Mojarra shark must represent the whole maize plant qua world tree, its tail being the twin ears of maize and its fins representing the leaves, while the stalk is its body. The squared nature of the maize kernels on La Mojarra Stela 1, like the maize ear itself, along with other evidence on the shark, such as the knot indicating where the ear was attached to the rest of the shark, make it clear that the La Mojarra ruler wore not a real shark on top of his head but instead a replica composed of various materials, including a twinned maize ear (the shark's tail) apparently woven from basketry materials. The twinned maize ear is of special interest here for its implications of kingship and fecundity. Petrich notes that "in all Mesoamerica twinned ears of maize are synonymous with fertility, and they produce a special cult. They are considered as a manifestation of the maize deity, of the maize kernel's spirit" [translation mine] (1985:156). More than just fecundity, however, the twinned maize ear can also be directly linked to rulership, in that a Mixe name for the twinned ear of maize is "King Maize." Specifically, in San Juan Ixcatlan kooN-mook King Maize is described as a "mazorca [ear of maize] fasciated at the tip or divided at the terminal part into two or more ear-like branches" (Lipp 1991:23).4 1. More evidence of maize linkage with parturition in Maya thought can be found in the Tzotzil custom of placing two maize ears on a woman's abdomen immediately after birth (Vogt 1969:63). 2. The "diving god" is an important manifestation mentioned in literature particularly in connection with Postclassic Maya sites of the Quintana Roo region; indeed, iconographie parallels abound in Mesoamerica. The maize deities of Aztec and Maya codices provide one parallel, and a connection of this diving deity with maize. The Late Preclassic deities falling down the Hauberg Stela's knife blade suggest the same connection with maize. Further discussion of a diving god and umbilical cords can be found in Miller (1974), although the connection with maize is missed. 3. "The Jester god, a clearly identified signal of kingship in the Classic period, occurs as an object worn or handled, as a glyph denoting kingship, and as a semantic determinative for the status of king, ahaw" (Freidel and Schele 1988:552). 4. The orthography employed herein is a normalized phonemic one, deviating from Amerindianist practice in that A stands for shwa (the mid-central vowel), ch stands for the alveolar affricate often written c, and tz stands for the dental affricate t. Herein also, x indicates the post-alveolar voiceless groove fricative (or sibilant) known as "esh," while / indicates the voiceless velar fricative that in the I PA is given as x, and N refers to the velar nasal known as "eng" or "engma."

It is important to note, therefore, not only that the identifications of both fish and maize can be made from the image alone but also that the symbolic equivalence of fish and maize is plausible in a Mesoamerican context. In fact, considerable evidence for this equivalence exists. More evidence can be adduced as well. For example, on Bonampak Stela 1 the young maize deity is emerging also from the forehead portals on either side, and these deity heads surmount fish bodies, suggesting an intimate relationship between fish and maize that can be documented among Mayans even today; for example, fish is said to be the maize deity's animal familiar or nagual (Girard 1979:260). A similar fish and maize equivalence for Late Preclassic people in Veracruz is suggested by La Mojarra Stela 1, where the shark's tail is composed of maize ears. Significantly, on the Gulf Coast in Veracruz, near where La Mojarra Stela 1 was found, small sharks, referred to as caz?n (derived from the root for "to hunt"), constitute a relatively abundant delicacy; local inhabitants say they are tasty and tender like fresh maize ears (Miguel Baraona 1989: private communication). It is here if anywhere that the shark can be seen as a symbolic and affective equivalent of maize. Of major interest is the fact that Mixe-Zoquean languages support by near homophony this symbolic equivalence between fish and maize. For example, Mixean mook (maize) sounds much like maak (to fish), and Proto-Zoquean *koke (fish) is very similar to Proto Mixean *kok (maize spike), or ?ilote (immature maize ear). Additionally, Proto-Mixean *akx (fish) is sonically similar to Proto-Mixean *Akx (maize degraining) (Table 1). The iconographie equivalence between maize and fish on La Mojarra Stela 1, on Kaminaljuyu Stela 11, and on the Dumbarton Oaks Pectoral are in agreement with instances of near homophony in Mixe-Zoquean languages and demonstrate the verbal and visual punning and polysemy capabilities of Mixe-Zoquean TABLE 1 Proto-Mixe Zoquean Proto-Mixean Proto-Zoquean Maize (?ilote) *kok Fish *aksa *akx *koke Maize (degrain) *Aks *Akx *Aks Maize (mazorca) *mook *mook *mook To Fish *maak *maak *maak speakers. Therefore, the writing on La Mojarra Stela 1 could represent a Mixe-Zoquean language. To be sure, Maya iconography relates fish to maize as well, but there is little linguistic basis in Mayan languages for such visual and cognitive equations. This suggests that the Classic Maya could have inherited the symbolism from ancestors that borrowed it from neighboring Mixe Zoqueans in whose languages the symbolic connections might have been based on near homophony. Three In addition to the fish and maize iconography that provides clues about the language of the makers of La Mojarra Stela 1, the numbers three and four are iconographically significant in this context and can be demonstrated to support visual punning in Mixean languages while possessing general symbolic significance in ancient Mesoamerica. Three kernels are depicted in each ear of maize on the La Mojarra shark's tail, allowing the three to reference the whole ear by means of visual synecdoche, the part standing for the whole. Because the word for "meal" is derivationally related to the word for "maize tortilla" in many Mesoamerican languages, and because meals in Mesoamerican societies were based on maize in various forms? inextricably linking "meal" and "maize"?it is significant, therefore, that a sound similarity exists in Mixean languages between the words for "three" and "meal" (compare Totontepec Mixe toohk "three" and tOhkx "meal"). This sound resemblance between "three" and "maize/meal" only weakly points to Mixean rather than Zoquean as the language of La Mojarra, however, because some Mayan languages also have near homophones in words for "three" and "maize."5 indicated by an apostrophe. In these conventions, I am closely following practices of Mayanists. Bracketed words reflect spelling conventions of the original sources from which the words are taken. I take responsibility for the reconstructed Mixe-Zoquean words, which by convention are preceded by an asterisk. 5. The breadnut tree (called ixim te' in Tzeltal in recognition of its use as a substitute for maize), is recognized by Huastec Mayans as being the "maize" used before maize was discovered. In proto Cholan the breadnut is ax, similar to Proto-Cholan ux (three). In Yucatec Maya the words for "breadnut" and "three" are fully homophonous.</page><page sequence="8">Stross: Maize and Fish 17 Figure 8. (a) Maya Paris Codex. From Villacorta and Villacorta 1930.

The three kernels in each ear of maize at the end of the La Mojarra shark's tail (fig. 9a) can be identified as the structural analogues of three circlets on the personified trees from the Dumbarton Oaks Pectoral and Kaminaljuyu Stela 11 (figs. 9b-c).

The hand accompanies a kingly head wearing an apparent maize headdress that resembles a pointed helmet to indicate maize sprouting out from the underworld (see Girard 1979:193). This image, perhaps depicting a ruler of Chalcatzingo (Kent Reilly 1988: private communication), is shown with a sample of maize kernels from "sustenance mountain" to display his control over sustenance. Triple circlets can also be found later, in Classic Maya iconography; for example, in the three squared (maize) kernels arranged in a triangle in front of the "Step" glyph on a bloodletting basket depicted on Yaxchilan Lintel 24 (fig. 10a). The steps of the "Step" glyph represent a portal cleft in the top central portion of the "Mountain" monster's stepped forehead (Linda Schele 1989: private communication). From this stepped forehead cleft the young maize deity emerges on Bonampak Stela 1 (fig. 10b). A comparison can also be made here with the three circlets on top of the stepped mountain seat of the Aztec goddess Chalchiuhtlicue, and the cave mouth formed by it from which the mountain's waters pour, as depicted on the Aztec Codex Borbonicus (fig. 11). Here, too, the three circlets are reflections of a maize symbol in the "sustenance mountain" of Preclassic and Classic Mesoamerican tradition, although for the Aztecs they could have represented little more than a fossilized sacred theme with no native exegesis. The number three is symbolic of maize (three circlets) and maize vegetation (three spikes); in the form of the tripointed diadem of the Late Preclassic it also indicates the ruler. The ruler at La Mojarra was 6. There is no contradiction in identifying these three circlets in a row both with maize and also with the Preclassic version of the three stones of creation. Heavenly reflections of the Preclassic stones of creation are either the three stars of Orion's belt (Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka) or Betelgeuse, Alnilam, and Rigel; this is a conclusion based on the contemporary Mixe constellation "Child's Hammock" extending from Betelgeuse to Rigel, with Orion's belt in the middle (Lipp 1991:112), which is close to the triangular Classic Maya constellation, the "hearthstones of creation" (Alnilam, Rigel, and Saiph), identified by contemporary Quiche Mayans as Alnitak, Rigel, and Saiph (Tedlock 1985:261).</page><page sequence="10">Stross: Maize and Fish 19 Figure 10.

Efforts by this ruler and by later rulers of Maya kingdoms (and even by the much later Aztec rulers) to show that their heads were equivalent to the young maize ear can be seen in abundant representations on codices and on stone monuments.7 From archaeological remains it can be inferred that many a Mesoamerican ruler practiced cranial deformation, elongating the skull to produce a long sloping forehead. A plausible hypothesis to account for this is that the ruler elongated his skull to approximate more closely a tender, young, and beautiful maize ear (see Taube 1985:180). Mesoamerican iconography and ethnohistory suggests further that in imitation of the maize ear he wore his hair as if it were cornsilk, even tinting it red or yellow, like the colors of cornsilk (see Alcorn 1984:37). Additionally his headdress reflected maize in numerous ways and in various stages of growth. By synecdoche, then, the ruler could be perceived as a personification of the young maize ear, the staple food of his subjects. By the sacrificial letting of his own blood, which was closely related in ancient Mesoamerican cosmology to maize, the ruler apparently called forth his deified ancestors, gave birth to them, communicated with them, and became one with their incarnate state of grace, thus insuring a good harvest and with it the lives of his subjects (compare Schele and Miller 1986:183; Stross 1993). The La Mojarra ruler was relating himself symbolically to more than just maize. The maize ears terminating his headdress are also the tail of the shark, and as a shark he might have been seen as the fierce guardian of his people, a terror to his enemies, a symbol of deadly destruction. Animal avatars and associates of rulers varied with time and place in Mesoamerica, and included the shark, the jaguar, the crocodile, the alligator garfish, the harpy eagle, and others (see Reilly 1987). Four Four newly born sharks swim up (or slide down) the rope on the shark's back on La Mojarra Stela 1, each with its own little rope passing through the center of its 7. Additional tantalizing evidence survives in linguistic form; for example, shared homophonous roots in the Yucatec Maya hek (ear of maize) (Barrera Vasquez 1980:195-196) and hek-eb (deputy, chief who governs in place of another) (Barrera Vasquez 1980:196).</page><page sequence="11">20 RES 25 SPRING 1994 body; this makes a total of five fish. Four smaller elements around a larger central element describes the quincunx pattern, which, like fish, is also intimately connected with maize. With their bodies divided into three sections each, as is the main shark, the four little sharks may also be analogous to the four "maize kernels"?each also divided into three parts?surrounding the "maize tree" on the Middle Preclassic Dallas Plaque (fig. 9d). This is particularly so if we conceptualize the fish as ears (or kernels by synecdoche) of maize. The analogy can be taken further by recalling the quincunx pattern. If the maize tree on the Dallas Plaque symbolizes a larger fifth maize kernel, then the maize kernels can be interpreted as being planted or scattered in the four directions around the central axis (the ruler and central world tree), in a re-creation of the cosmogonie event leading to human discovery and use of maize according to Mesoamerican tradition. In Quiche and Cakchiquel Mayan accounts, the discovery of maize is attributed to animals leading humans to Pax/7, the sustenance mountain. "Those animals, the discoverers of maize, are perpetually evoked in Chorti and Quiche rituals during the moment when the [centrally located] elder throws four grains of maize to the four cosmic directions, assigned to the coyote, the bird or crow, the bird of prey, and the mountain cat" (Girard 1979:261), making a quincunx pattern. The Tzeltal Mayans also relate maize to the quincunx pattern. The normal Tzeltal method of planting maize is to make four holes that radiate out in four directions from a central hole, measured with the five foot length of the planting stick, precisely forming a quincunx (Berlin et al. 1974:126). Huastec Mayans plant five maize seeds in each hole, perhaps conceptualized as forming a quincunx pattern inside the ground. At La Mojarra the quincunx formed by the four fish and their mother is figurative rather than literal; but if the ruler is the central axis within the four circlets on which he stands, thus representing the world tree, then a quincunx is depicted there. The significant portion of the word for "four" in Mixean, taax, sounds similar to the words taxy, or "to let blood," and tax, or "stream of water, canal." These notions of water and of bloodletting are completely appropriate to a context of four baby sharks swimming up the bloody notochord of a water dwelling shark, and of a ruler with the symbolic power to call forth water by his letting of blood to nourish the maize planted by his subjects. No such appropriate homophony between words for "four" and "water" or "blood" concepts occurs in Mayan languages, nor in Zoquean languages. While not strongly indicative of Mixean, this data is at least suggestive. Four hooked circlets surround the central feature of the "mouths" held in the hand and suspended in front of the face of the ruler at La Mojarra. Such mouths are here presumed to represent, as do the Aztec oztotl and the Olmec and Maya quatrefoil motifs, entrances to the underworld; portals that are the foci of temporal and spiritual power because they are the links between this world and other cosmic domains. Such doorways serve as channels permitting communication between the ruler and his ancestors (Reilly 1989). These portals to the underworld, like the caves and fossae used by Maya today, require sacrificial blood to open them and to lubricate the passage between worlds. These portals at La Mojarra are represented by the stylized mouth of a shark, an interpretation derived from comparing La Mojarra's mouth portals with a Xoc (shark) mouth from Kohunlich (fig. 12), an Early Classic Maya site with masked temple facades (Jones 1991:253).8 Four is also the number associated with the day ahaw (lord) for the Mayans, but the connection between the two is nonlinguistic. On the other hand, the Copainal? Zoque word aNguVmoye referring to "chief, one who governs" is derived from the root aN (mouth) making a linguistic connection that could underlie a visual rebus connecting the mouth with power and governance (see Bernal-Garcia 1989). Similarly, the Proto-Mixean cognate *awa (mouth) refers to the ruler's source of power, identified on the La Mojarra stela as a "mouth" symbol. The Maya ahaw (lord) glyph evolved from a similar "mouth" symbol (see Fields 1989), creating a cross-language linguistic connection between the concepts "mouth" and "lord." This is significant because it has been shown that Mixe Zoqueans provided some input to the iconography and script of the Maya (Stross 1982; Justeson and Kaufman 1993). Individual Mixean languages reflect the reconstructed form for mouth in slightly different ways in accord with Table 2. 8. "Atop the ear ornaments at the sides of each mask rests a Xoc head in profile, its lower jaw missing and a large spine-tooth mounted near the tip of the upper jaw. In addition, from the mouth of the mask itself another tooth projects. Of considerable size, flattened at its cutting edge, and filed in the shape of a T, the tooth possesses all of the selachian traits described above, including the blood drops and U-form, adapted to the geometry of its new form" (Jones 1991:253). This Tau tooth is in essential form an Imix glyph; appropriate in that Imix is the Maya day equivalent to the Aztec day Cipactli, variously translated as Crocodile or Shark.</page><page sequence="12">Stross: Maize and Fish 21 Figure 12.

In the context of her independently motivated suggestion that a Mixean word for mouth may have been borrowed into Mayan languages as ahaw, Fields notes that "the importance of orality in relation to the ruler is a concept found among the Postclassic period Mexica, where the emperor's primary title was tlatoani 'speaker.' An equivalent meaning may well have been in operation as early as the Middle Preclassic" (1989:75). Sound similarities between Mixe-Zoquean mouth and Mayan lord can be viewed as a reflection of the conceptual relationship between the two referents that evolved first in Preclassic Olmec iconography and later in Classic Maya iconography, suggesting a coincidence that may well have causal and historical roots. If that is the case, and if Mixe-Zoquean languages can be more closely associated with Olmec and post-Olmec related archaeological remains while Mayan languages can be more closely associated with Classic Maya culture, then clearly temporal priority of Mixe-Zoquean concepts can be established. TABLE 2 Metaltepec Mixe aw [au] (mouth) Totontepec Mixe aah (mouth), tzap-'aw (open mouth), hOt-'aa ("mouth" of the stomach), awah (canine teeth) Sayula Popoluca ahw (mouth) Oluta Popoluca awA (mouth) It seems that some linguistic evidence can be brought to bear on the problem of what language was in use by the carvers of La Mojarra Stela 1 even without decipherment of the glyphs themselves. Based on the stela's characteristic of making visual symbols simultaneously index multiple referents, appropriate homophony or polysemy can be an indicator of the language in question. This kind of evidence suggests a Mixe-Zoquean language as the most probable language spoken by the people connected with La Mojarra Stela I, and Mixean is slightly favored.9 II. Rulership and the life cycle of maize In the context of Fields's work on the derivation and manipulation of political symbols (1989), including Cohen's suggestion that politically significant symbols are usually overtly nonpolitical, their potency being derived from their ambiguity (1974), it can be inferred that the elote (ripe maize ear) bearing maize plant that is also a shark on the top rear of the La Mojarra ruler's headdress is crucial as a political symbol to his display and maintenance of power. This focal symbol is ambiguously a shark and maize because one is a transformation of the other, a phenomenon well known to indigenous Mesoamericans. It is only the central element of a five-part system that serves by means of four peripheral elements to locate the ruler in space and time in relation to strategically placed developmental stages of maize. It will be easier to look back at the relevant La Mojarra iconography from the vantage point of more easily recognizable constituents in the maize life cycle, such as those found on other Late Preclassic artifacts, like the Hauberg Stela. 9. On the other hand, Justeson and Kaufman propose a partial decipherment of the La Mojarra script using Zoquean grammatical components that suggest Zoquean rather than Mixean as the language of the La Mojarra script (1993). Because of the small number of crucial grammatical elements in the decipherment and the lexical similarity of the languages involved, a conclusive language determination may not yet be possible.</page><page sequence="13">22 RES 25 SPRING 1994 The Hauberg Stela The Hauberg Stela, attributed to the Guatemalan Peten region inhabited by the Classic Maya, is roughly contemporaneous with La Mojarra Stela 1, and it has glyphs that are early forms of Classic Maya script (fig. 3). Insights about La Mojarra symbolism are available from a comparison of its iconography with that on the Hauberg Stela. Moreover, greater insight into Mayan cosmology and symbolism itself derives from the recognition that the "climbers" of the Hauberg Stela are deity representatives of different stages in the life cycle of maize. These in turn can be related to the three "masks" of the La Mojarra ruler's costume and the two main elements of his headdress. Mention here of stages in the life cycle of maize is not meant to imply anything about the biological facts of maize development. What is referred to here is only the coding, through iconographie and linguistic means, of perceived culturally relevant growth stages as filtered through the particular cultures involved. The ruler on the Hauberg Stela clearly has a ripe maize ear with two kernels on top of his head. It is sprouting from what must be a large ripe maize kernel shown in a form different from the other two. Structurally this larger seed is also the counterpart of the large teardrop-shaped element directly below the La Mojarra shark's mouth, doubling as the long-lipped mask's eye; formally it resembles each of the six kernels within the twin maize ears on the La Mojarra stela more than it does the other two maize kernels on its own ripe maize ear. It is likely that the two different shapes of maize kernel reflect the difference between frontal and profile views of the seed.10 The Hauberg ruler's headdress maize ear is in fact the last stage depicted in a series of developmental stages in the life cycle of maize, beginning with the maize spirit near the top of the "vision serpent" or "sky snake," winding its way over the ruler's shoulder and into the sky. This serpent itself has a headdress naming it the Wakah Chan ("six sky" or "risen sky"), by means of which it is recognized as the world axis of Maya cosmology (Schele and Freidel 1990:67-70, 418), a later transformation of which can be found in the serpent bar scepter symbol of Maya rulership. The Hauberg serpent can be understood to symbolize equally a planting stick (coa), a maize stalk, and the axis mundi, or world axis. The La Mojarra ruler is holding a weapon for piercing (perhaps a short spear), which could also symbolize a planting stick, recalling Tzeltal and Huastec Mayan recognition of the planting stick as a metaphorical weapon. All four climbers on the Hauberg Stela's serpent (planting stick, spear, axis mundi) have headdresses that represent, in order from top to bottom, four stages in the growth of maize. The fact that the top one (fig. 13a) is a seed and the rest are more mature stages, suggests that the climbers may be beginning at the top and climbing down in terms of time, in keeping with current Maya belief that the spirit of maize is kept in the heavens, descending when it is time for communion with the maize in the milpa, or "cornfield" (compare to fig. 3), just as in reality the maize kernel falls from the planter's hands into the hole that can be seen as a miniature symbolic "maw" of the underworld monster, a portal linking cosmic planes. That the second maize spirit, or climber (fig. 13b), represents the spirit of sprouting maize is indicated by the top of its headdress. He is larger than the first maize spirit and older. The spirit of maize is even today conceptualized by the Huastec Mayans as a growing boy.11 The third maize spirit on the Hauberg Stela (fig. 13c) is bigger still, with a maize "spike" or "flower" headdress. The five circlets at the end of the cornsilk may represent an appropriate number of twenty-day months (that is, 100 days) for the maize ear to have progressed to this stage in the lowlands. The fourth and smallest of these miniature maize spirit deities at the bottom of the vision serpent (fig. 13d) has what seems to be a ?ilote (immature but edible maize ear) stage headdress. This being has a skull for a head and he is carrying an ax. The explanation here is that the ?ilote stage is a time for the first harvesting. These young maize ears are tasty and nutritious and early harvest of one of the typically two ears per stalk allows the remaining one to get larger than otherwise expected. Clearly this jilote has been beheaded, or "chopped" off, the stalk in order to be eaten, explaining the skull and the ax.12 It recalls the fact that one 10. An ahaw-like glyph occupies the upper end of the Hauberg Stela's ripe maize surmounting the seed from which the ear sprouts, which resembles the po element in the Maya ah po glyph, recalling both that one etymology of the word ahaw (a title equivalent to ah po) is "he the-sower-of-seeds" (cf. Tzeltal aw "seed"), and that Proto Mixe-Zoquean *puuh means "seed." 11. Huastec Mayans perceive the spirit of maize to be aging. "As the maize plant ages, so does the spirit of the maize present in the milpa. He slowly ages from a young (circa seven year old) boy to an adolescent as the days progress. (One informant said Thipaak [the maize deity] was either a boy or three people?father, mother and son?but he wasn't sure.)" (Alcorn 1984:354). 12. It is difficult to determine whether the ax (which could refer to the Maya head variant for "six") also represents completion of the sixth 20-day month in the maize cycle (120 days, enough in the</page><page sequence="14">Stross: Maize and Fish 23 Figure 13. (a, b, c, d) The "Climbers" on the Hauberg Stela. From Schele 1985:146, fig. 14. (e) The "Fallers."

The sky snake, serving as the maize stalk down which the maize spirit (from seed to /7/ote) climbs, must also represent the maize planting stick whose Spanish name, coa, probably derives from N?huatl coati, meaning both "snake" and "twin."13 The "twin" meaning is apt for the uneven twinned maize ears composing the shark's tail on the La Mojarra Stela as well as the asymmetrical double maize ears (or horns) on the southern (or Nadir) deity's portrait found in the late Preclassic Cerros and Nohmul caches (Hammond 1987:20). The asymmetrical "twinning" associated with maize abundance has its real life explanatory parallel in the fact that normal maize plant development includes two lowlands for a ?ilote to develop) or whether the death's head (as a head variant for ten) represents the completion of ten 20-day months (200 days, enough for a fresh roasting corn ear elote to develop in lowlands or highlands). Barbara MacLeod has brought to my attention the fact that in several Maya lowland regions there are green maize festivals at 180 day intervals (nine uinals, or periods of 20 days), corresponding to the harvest of the ?ilote, when green corn tamales are freely distributed (1989: personal communication). Nine uinals corresponds to the day Chicchan in Table 3, and thus perhaps also to the Bolon Mayel emblem (representing one of two portals to the Otherworld), which has both a maize ear sprouting from it and the number nine in bar and dot notation. 13. Mocho (Mayan) pach (lizard, twin) preserves the same sort of homophony but substitutes lizard for serpent. One must suppose a historical relationship between this word for lizard and Proto-Mixe Zoquean *patzi. Note the similar Tzeltal name, bach for the agricultural implement with a turned up "nose" (like the crocodile depictions from such locations as Izapa?as opposed to the turned down long nose characteristic of shark depictions) is bach (fig. 20).</page><page sequence="15">24 RES 25 SPRING 1994 ears of corn on each stalk, an upper and a lower one. It is documented among the Tzeltal that only the lower maize ear is taken at the hi (?ilote, immature maize ear) stage, whereas the upper ear is left on the stalk to mature into an even larger ear of ahan (elote, ripe maize ear), and most of the ahan ears of corn are left to dry out as ears of ixim (maiz, matured dried seed maize ear or kernel) (Berlin et al. 1974:77, 113). This explains the double ear, one larger than the other, hanging from the end of the La Mojarra ruler's rope on his headdress; that is, the double ear that comprises the shark's tail, one half of which is larger than the other. Because the ruler on the Hauberg Stela has a fully developed roasting ear of ripe maize (Proto-Cholan *ahAn, proto-Tzeltalan *ahan) on his headdress, he is, in effect, the central figure in a five piece set, a quincunx. In this context he can be viewed as having called forth by means of ritual bloodletting an ancestral deity to be incorporated into his own body (Schele and Miller 1986:183; see also Schele and Freidel 1990:116). According to Mesoamerican traditions, humans were created from maize sprinkled with the blood of autosacrificed deities, via an earlier generation of ancestors turned into fish; the maize imagery on his headdress implies both the pervasive importance of maize and the power of the king through his living representation of its completed spirit. On the Hauberg Stela, the maize spirit's descent from the heavens has been brought about by the autosacrificial offering of royal blood, represented by three upper bodies that have been chopped in half, blood flowing from their severed torsos, descending headfirst down a scalloped edged and recurved flint blade, presumably the one that cut these figures in half (fig. 13e). Similar scallops are visible on one edge of the La Mojarra depiction of a blade (compare to fig. 6). From comparison with the La Mojarra blade, it is now apparent why the Hauberg blade seems to come from the king's back.14 The La Mojarra version, more accurately reflecting a prototype of this scalloped blade, is a shark's fin, a fact not necessarily perceived by the makers of the Hauberg Stela. The scalloped blade is sprouting from the Hauberg ruler's shoulder as is the blade (shark fin) on the shark at La Mojarra. Comparative iconography seems to indicate that the king on the Hauberg is the shark, right down to his Tau-shaped stylized shark's tooth incisor, the bloodletter par excellence. The three torsos falling in the blood along the Hauberg knife blade's edge, it may be noted, also appear to represent stages of maize ear growth, perhaps the three stages at which maize is cut (plucked) from the stalk, or "sacrificed," for human consumption; in descending order: the hi (jilote, immature edible maize ear), ahan (elote, ripe maize ear), and ixim (mazorca, seed maize ear). The last sacrificed stage at the bottom, ixim, shows a k'in glyph, representing the sun, infixed in the headdress, as reflected in a Mesoamerican belief that the sun god is "reborn in the form of maize" (Pasztory 1983:57). The maize is sacrificed not only for human consumption but also so that the maize spirit can be reborn the next year. This same headdress adorns the head emerging from the mouth of the rear serpent head on the ruler's serpent bar on the Leiden Plaque, and can also be seen on the head of the central figure of Kaminaljuyu's Monument 65. The iconography of the Hauberg Stela shows clearly the maize spirit descending from the heavens on the "sky snake" in four stages, culminating in the ruler as the fifth stage, made visible on his headdress, presumably as an incarnation of the mature maize spirit. Four stages are represented by the miniature climbers, two above the ruler's shoulder and two below. If the top and the bottom can be taken to represent Zenith and Nadir, respectively, in a dual program where Zenith and north are the same, the Hauberg ruler is then facing north, with the west on his left and the east on his right. He is thus the central element in a cosmos bounded by an equilateral diamond-shaped quincunx.15 A similar quincunx of deities with headdresses representing different stages of the maize life cycle can be found on the portrait of Stormy Sky on Tikal Stela 31 (two are on the belt, one on the left arm, one above the right hand, and the one with the largest headdress directly atop Stormy Sky's crown). Here only the heads 14. Relating specifically to the scalloped blade, an Olmec jade figure from Costa Rica has scalloped "bat wings" sprouting from his back; the scalloping shows that these wings, like the fins of the La Mojarra shark, might be doubling as knife blades. Note that even in Spanish the words for wing, ala, and fin, aleta are derivationally related, and in Mayan and Mixe-Zoquean languages they are usually the same lexical item. 15. In combination with the Pomona Flare, discussed herein, these spatially oriented maize spirits constitute evidence for interpreting Classic Maya directional symbolism as a dual program in which north can also be Zenith and south can also be Nadir (cf. Stross 1991). The two sprites on his right must represent the Zenith/ north (top) and the east; the two on his left must represent the west and the Nadir/south (bottom).</page><page sequence="16">Stross: Maize and Fish 25 of the deities are shown. Each of the heads is that of a different deity, and each has a headdress with a different stage of maize. Another quincunx of deity heads occurs on the ruler portrait on the Leiden Plaque (two on the belt, one emerging from each end of the double-headed serpent bar held in the ruler's arms, and one with the Jester God's headdress atop the ruler's head). Yet another quincunx of images with maize stage headdresses can also be found on the Pomona Flare and in two Late Preclassic quincunx caches all from Belize and discussed below. Much the same sort of quincunx of maize stage headdresses can be discovered on the ruler portrait on La Mojarra Stela 1. Three masks labeled b, c, and I on fig. 1, and the k'in head and the shark atop the ruler's head can all be taken together as constitutive of a cosmogram with elements that include different stages in the life cycle of maize. That the elements represent maize stages is not obvious from a visual inspection of La Mojarra Stela 1 alone; it is instead a conclusion generated from a comparison of structural elements of this stela with the other artifacts. III. The quincunx cosmogram The centrality of the ruler in space and time?his critical position as pivot in the universe at least since Protoclassic times in the Maya area and perhaps earlier elsewhere in Mesoamerica?has been discussed in detail by Schele and Miller, who specify that the ruler is declaring himself to be the World Tree of the Maya cosmos (1986:109), and by Schele and Freidel, who place the ruler at the apex of the social pyramid, at the center of the various cycles of temporal activity, of the socially defined universe, and of a smaller quatrefoliate sacred space created by ritual (1990:98, 116, 437). A quatrefoliate perimeter around a center, or a five-part design composed of four peripheral elements around a center, defines a quincunx pattern, which seems to be the essence of the southern Mesoamerican cosmogram, or graphic depiction of the cosmos, as seen in the Hauberg Stela. The iconography of just such a quincunx-shaped cosmogram has been discussed by Hammond in a comparison of Late Preclassic "diadem heads" from the Cerros and Nohmul caches with the Pomona Flare, also dated to Late Preclassic, around a.D. 100 (1987) and by Freidel and Schele, in a consideration of Late Preclassic Lowland Maya kingship (1988). It is in the latter that the cache pendants are proposed to be part of the ruler's diadem headband (1988:555), and in the former that the proposed directional symbolism of these deity diadems is laid out (1987:20). The quincunx pattern, usually shown as a square of circlets with a larger central circlet that can be turned ninety degrees to become a diamond of equidistant circlets with a larger circlet in the center, is the shape created by the diadem heads of the Cerros cache, and more schematically by the climbers on the sky serpent of the Hauberg Stela. It is also the pattern reproduced by Mesoamerican shamans and curers when from their central positions they establish sacred space through dedications of smoke and/or drink to the four directions. Even today the quincunx is absolutely basic to the shape of the Mayan cosmos and to the important maize-related items within it. The positioning of maize based offerings on the altar and in the milpa, the measurement of the milpa, the planting pattern, and so on, are of quincunx shape. The most common Tenejapa Tzeltal pattern of planting maize, for example, is to begin with a center hole and mark off four more holes in the four corners that are one planting stick length away (about five feet). This results in a quincunx (Berlin et al. 1974:126). Among the Huastec Mayans, "After requesting the earth's permission to work his chosen plot, the milpero slashes a border (pehol) around the boundary of the area covered by the vegetation to be slashed back. The first pehol was made by Thipaak, maker of the first milpa, who established his borders by shooting an arrow in the four directions to mark the four corners of the milpa to be" (Alcorn 1984:341). Ideally five seeds are planted in each hole (Alcorn 1984:350). The Chorti (Mayans) also plant maize with the planting stick, "the planter digging five or six holes all around himself while standing in the same position. ... If four cuartos [handspans] apart, four grains are planted in each hole, and if five, five grains are planted. The former is more common and illustrates the ritual value of the number four" (Wisdom 1940:45). The number four, when arranged from a central position, is of course a quincunx. It can be concluded that a quincunx cosmogram has persisted until today since at least Late Preclassic times, when cached diadem deity heads were being set in place in a quincunx pattern. Pomona Flare The Pomona Flare is a large Late Preclassic jade from Belize shaped like an ear flare?a trumpetlike ring curving inward to a "throat" roughly an inch in</page><page sequence="17">26 RES 25 SPRING 1994 Figure 14. The Pomona Flare. From Hammond 1987:12, fig. 1. Drawing: Peter Matthews. diameter and constituting the most prominent part of the Maya earplug assembly?but probably not one in view of its large 7-inch diameter. It has four apparent deity head glyphs in Maya style arranged at equal intervals around a central hole (fig. 14), forming a quincunx. Hammond noticed that these heads can be compared almost point for point to diadem heads from a Late Preclassic Cerros cache, arranged when discovered in the form of a quincunx (fig. 16a), and also compared to diadem heads from a cache of Late Preclassic Nohmul (fig. 16b). On the Pomona Flare the deity heads corresponding to the diadem heads of the Cerros and Nohmul caches are accompanied by two glyph collocations, the numbers "four" and "eight" in bar and dot notation, and two apparent "footprint" glyphs.16 The footprints have been interpreted as "paths," showing the direction Figure 15. The Pomona Flare. After Hammond 1987:12, fig. 1. Drawing: Peter Matthews. Arrangement: Brian Stross. to go from Zenith/north to west to Nadir/south to east, that is, clockwise as arranged by Hammond (1987:13). My interpretation of the Pomona Flare departs from that of Hammond at this point in that I would turn the Flare by 180 degrees from his proposed positioning, so that the number eight is at the top, accompanied by what is known as the young maize deity, whose portrait head is the head variant for the number eight in the Maya script (fig. 15). This means that the deity head accompanying the number four in bar and dot notation, one of the two heads having a k'in (the Maya "sun/day" glyph) ear, is in the Nadir position at the bottom. This coincides appropriately with the Mayan notion of the sun as "Jaguar Lord of the Underworld," corresponding to GUI of the Palenque triad, who is the sun god and whose glyph usually has a k'in replacing the ear or atop the head (Schele and Miller 1984:50). It also coincides with the belief mentioned earlier that the sun god, having coupled with the earth goddess in the underworld, dies and is reborn as maize. The east head is then on the observer's right, and the west is on the 16. Each of the "footprints" has a bar cartouche that could stand for five, so that counting this five along with the four dots in the Nadir position, there are nine: the number of the underworld, the number of lords of the night, and the number that is appropriate to the Nadir. The Zenith position with its bar and dot eight, when increased by the five contributed by its footprint bar, becomes thirteen, the number associated by the Maya with the sky, its layers, and its deities. One may note additionally that one of the footprints has nine "toes" and the other "seven"?highly significant numbers for maize growth, when we recall the "seven" and "nine" deities (Uuk Ek Kan and Bolon Mayel), both of whom are strongly related to maize (cf. Harrison 1988).</page><page sequence="18">Stross: Maize and Fish 27 observer's left. If one faces north, as the ruler is presumed to do on the Hauberg Stela, east is also right and west is left. Whereas Hammond focuses on a directional interpretation of the quincunx cosmogram formed by the cache heads and by the deities on the Pomona Flare (fig. 17), I suggest that in addition the deity heads on the Pomona Flare and in the caches represent developmentally significant twenty-day "months," in fact, growth stages in the life cycle of maize, just as on the Hauberg Stela. On the Pomona maize deity heads the ears of maize in various developmental stages are represented where the ears would be on the head itself (that is, in back), whereas the sprouts, roots, and silk are where the hair would be on the head. The head itself is topped by the planted seed. Beginning with the Zenith deity and going clockwise in order around the circle of heads (Zenith, to east, to Nadir, to west) it is possible to discern four and even eight stages representing growth, although one can speculate that the designers of this flare may have envisioned thirteen in all, with the Zenith head being in the final position. Beginning with the Zenith deity head, the seed is sprouting atop the head, with little rootlets pushing downwards (fig. 17a). This could represent completion of the fourth 20-day period following preparation of the milpa for planting, that is, Ahau (Table 3). It would n3F r-i^^? a ^&lt;~&lt;*r Figure 16.

The part in the deity's hair goes down into the seed, showing that it was recently planted. The maize deity who also represents here the four stages of the sun in time (rising, noon, setting, midnight) and space (east, Zenith/north, west, Nadir/south), although going counterclockwise as the sun, has his eye fully open, for he is at Zenith. The second position is the east deity head (fig. 17b), representing completion of the fifth 20-day cycle (here called Imix after the day-name ruled by the god of number five), when leaves appear?visible on the deity's forehead, where the sprout of the Zenith head has become a leaf, and the hole in the seed has been filled. The deity's ear, still with a circular center, now has an additional curl at the bottom. As the sun, this deity's eye is just opening after the night's sleep in the underworld, at sunrise, the waking up eye has what may represent a residue from sleep, depicted below the eye as a "step" motif characteristic of shark depictions?compare with the mouth of La Mojarra's shark (fig. 1). Continuing in a clockwise direction, the third position in the Maize cycle is the Nadir deity head, representing completion of the sixth 20-day cycle, named Ik (Wind, Breath, Life), when life has been breathed into the newly forming maize ear as a</page><page sequence="19">28 RES 25 SPRING 1994 Figure 17. Cerros, Nohmul, Pomona Flare laid out together. After Hammond 1987:20, fig. 6. Arrangement: Brian Stross. consequence of the union of the sun god and the earth goddess in the underworld (see Pasztory 1983:57) (fig. 17c). At the end of this time, 120 days will have elapsed since the beginning of the maize cycle. The ear of maize at the back of the deity head has begun to flower and to take on its characteristic form. The seed is no longer accessible at the top of the head, although a notch remains. The maize at 120 days corresponds to the seventh named Tzeltal maize developmental stage, which has a long name meaning "the staminate inflorescence of the stem begins to appear and the first immature corn ear begins to come out" (Berlin et al. 1974:65). As the sun, this deity's eye is completely closed now, for he is in the underworld. The next stage is represented by the west maize spirit deity head on the Pomona Flare (fig. 17d). The half open eye of this maize deity shows he is just waking up, having received the breath of life in the underworld where fertilization has taken place. This position in the cycle corresponds to the seventh 20-day month in the life cycle of maize, which can be seen in Table 3 to correspond to Akbal, the glyphic symbol for which is visible on the deity's cheek. In the Tzeltal highlands, the ninth of thirteen named maize developmental stages is "the young immature corn ear begins to come out." At this stage the maize ear is called pak in Tzeltal, from a root meaning "face down" or "head down." At the end of this stage the first silks will have come out: "The corn flower . . . begins to bloom several days prior to the appearance of the first silks. When the first silks do occur, the developing ear, now 140-160 days old, is no longer considered a s-pakumal but has become hi" (Berlin etal. 1974:65). The ear at the back of the deity's head shows a young maize ear, and the U-shaped seed has reached its smallest point and moved to the back of the eye.17 In this phase of the maize cycle the eye is half open because the maize is waking up. As the sun, this deity's eye is half-closed at the time of sunset, ready for full closure during the sun's passage through the underworld (note that we are traveling clockwise in the maize development cycle, but the sun deity itself is going counterclockwise). Returning to the Zenith/north maize deity head on the Pomona Flare, the deity head itself now represents the developing ear. The eighth day-name Kan, which follows Akbal, and which means "Ripe" in Yucatec, says that at the end of the eighth 20-day cycle, the jilote (the edible immature ear of maize) will be ready for eating. This deity head on the Pomona Flare is accompanied by the number eight in bar and dot notation, also suggesting that this is the completion of the eighth 20-day month. This correlates well with the tenth named stage in maize development according to 17. The ear of the deity could instead represent a clasp in the back of the deity's neck as part of a necklace. In this connection, we may notice that this somewhat internally variable element at the back of the necks of three of the Pomona Flare deity portraits greatly resembles the Maya glyph that has a phonetic value of yu (cf. Stuart 1987:47); note also that Proto-Cholan *y-uh or *y-uhy refers to "necklace," and that Proto-Mixe-Zoquean *yo'k meant "neck, throat," while Proto-Mixe-Zoquean *yu' meant "hunger."</page><page sequence="20">Stross: Maize and Fish 29 Day Caban Etznab Cauac Ahau Imix Ik Akbal Number Days Deity Passed One Two Three Four Five Six Seven 1-20 20-40 40-60 60-80 80-100 100-120 120-140 Kan Eight 140-160 Chicchan Nine 160-180 Cimi Ten 180-200 Manik Eleven 200-220 Lamat Twelve 220-240 Muluc Thirteen 240-260 TABLE 3 Maize Activity Related to Day Name Prepare *earth *Spear the earth and plant maize *Rain comes to germinate the maize *Sun comes to warm the soil *Roots develop indicating seed is fertile. *Leaf sprouts appear.

(Seven is Aztec number referencing ''harvested maize ears.") Tzeltal informants: me' hi'iltikix (the mature hi with immature styles) (Berlin et al. 1974:65). At the end of this eighth 20-day period, 160 days have passed. Appropriately, the number eight is presided over by the "young maize deity," who also rules the day named Kan, and who is depicted at the Zenith/north position on the Pomona Flare. It is at this point, at the end of the eighth 20-day stage that the young maize deity dies for the first time: As the s-pakomal develops, the young ear will eventually assume the form known as hi. This is approximately 160 to 180 days after planting, or around the middle of July in the midland and more temperate parajes of Tenejapa. It is normal that two developing ears should be apparent on each stalk of corn by this point in the growing season. The hi may be harvested at this time, and if it is, the lower ear (yalan tz'al) is invariably taken. The Tzeltal recognize that removal of the lower ear allows the remaining upper ear to increase considerably in size. Berlin etal. 1974:113 Of the two ears on the normal cornstalk, then, the lower one is picked at the end of this stage, when it has become an edible hi, thus, accounting for the lopped off cornate ear on the left side of the Nadir/south diadem heads from the Cerros and Nohmul caches (fig. 17). That is to say, one of the two cornate ears represented on these diadem heads has been picked as hi, that is, as a jilote. The maize spirit represented by the smallest diadem head, has lost one of his horns. This may also explain why on the Hauberg Stela the "Chak-Xib-Chak" maize spirit, depicted skeletally and with a hatchet, is smaller than the other maize spirits, just as with the Nadir diadem head (fig. 13d). He represents the lower maize ear, or the one closer to the underworld; that it was believed in Mesoamerica to be populated by dwarfs accounts perhaps for the small size of this deity head, and of the Hauberg's "Chak-Xib Chak." This bottom ear is plucked prematurely, allowing the top one to get bigger. It is shown as the smallest of the maize spirits, and the smallest of the</page><page sequence="21">30 RES 25 SPRING 1994 heads. The one that survives can be seen on the ruler's head some forty days later, the larger for having lost his younger brother. IV. The divinatory month Already the proposed stages of maize as represented on the Hauberg Stela and the Pomona Flare, as well as by the deity heads recovered from Late Preclassic caches, have been referred to as representative of 20 day intervals. At this point it will be useful to explore more fully evidence that the stages of maize can be seen to follow a calendric sequence of thirteen 20-day intervals totaling 260 days, equivalent to a Mesoamerican calendar cycle referred to by Mayanists as the Tzolkin (Sacred Almanac or Ritual Calendar). The Classic Maya Calendar Round involved the meshing of two cyclic calendars. The first was a "ritual" calendar of 260 days consisting of all combinations of one each from a set of thirteen numbers (1-13) and another set of twenty day-names (Imix-Ahau). The second was an "agricultural" calendar of 365 days, consisting of eighteen named 20-day months plus one unnamed period of five additional days at the end. The Tzeltal people have retained a vestige of their agricultural calendar, but have lost the ritual calendar. As seen earlier, a 260-day portion of their 365 day agricultural calendar corresponds (though not necessarily isomorphically any more) to thirteen named stages in the life cycle of the milpa, lasting approximately 260 days (Berlin et al. 1974:64-65), and thus to thirteen of the 20-day months. The 260-day Tzolkin, or Maya Sacred Almanac, not only approximates the length of human gestation, it accounts for the named stages of maize, month by 20-day month, from milpa preparation to harvest of the dried ears. A single 20-day month is created by naming off in order the 20 day-names of the veintena; the interval between any given Imix (the first day-name) and the next Imix will be 20 days.18 Following Imix comes the day Ik, with the same interval between it and the next Ik; and so on. Thus, a sequence of thirteen day-names could serve as a shorthand referencing of the named maize growth stages, provided that there once was a time when the thirteen named growth stages were at least cognitively isomorphic with thirteen 20-day periods. Given that maize agriculture is spoken of with reference to 20-day increments, and that there are thirteen named stages, it seems that such growth stages are still at least cognitively isomorphic with 20-day intervals for the Tzeltal. But using a day-name as a shorthand for stages in the life cycle of maize requires choosing a day-name with which to start. Fortunately such a decision is easy. Thompson noticed an interesting but unexplained fact relating the day-names to the corresponding numerals. He concluded that "it is almost certain that a sequence of thirteen of the day names running from Caban to Muluc represent in the same order the identical series of gods ruling the numbers 1-13" (1971:103). The day Caban is ruled by the same deity ruling the number one, and, therefore, is the best choice with which to start. Caban is ruled by the moon goddess of fertility, Na; Na means not only "mother" but also "first," and so is appropriate to her head variant reference of the number one. Moreover the name Caban (phonetically kaban) refers most definitely to the earth, kab. Although there are no currently attested examples of this stage, its semantic value should refer to preparation of the milpa earth prior to planting. The next day, Etz'nab, has been related to a spear (Justeson et al. 1985:43); the maize-planting stick "spears" the ground during the next named stage. Cauac, the third in our series of stages, and the day of rain, surely refers to the rain coming and watering the newly planted maize crop. The fourth day of this Caban-initiated sequence is Ahau (lord), ruled by the god of the number four, the sun deity. The number four written with four circlets accompanies the Kin (Nadir/south) deity on the Pomona Flare. This can be interpreted as a reference to the sun approaching the summer solstice and warming up the earth so that the Cauac-watered maize can germinate. ?mix is the fifth day in the Cafaan-initiated sequence, returning on the Pomona Flare to the east maize deity. The Mixe name for this day means "root" (Miller 1956:60), and the Maya name refers to "water lily"; the glyph for Imix may depict the leaf of a water lily. This is where the Tzeltal growth stage naming for maize currently begins. The sixth day, Ik (phonetically ik', breath, life, spirit) must be the point where life is breathed into the developing maize in the underworld; this is where the Pomona Flare's maize deity head is located. The seventh day, Akbal (ak'bal, night), can be related to the named Tzeltal growth stage in which the inedible maize ear is "face down" (toward the underworld, 18. Yucatec names for the veintena days are given here, following general practice among Mayanists.</page><page sequence="22">Stross: Maize and Fish 31 which is visible at night). On the Pomona Flare the maize/sun deity is facing down. The eighth day, Kan (k'an), referring to "food, maize," and glyphically shown as a kernel of maize, correlates well with the Zenith/north maize deity head on the Pomona Flare, where the number eight is inscribed in bar and dot notation. It is this eighth 20 day month that sees the development of an edible ear of maize that is "beheaded" and eaten by humans. Table 3 displays the day-names in order (column 1), the number whose glyphic head variant depicts the deity ruling the corresponding day of the veintena (column 2), the number of elapsed days since the beginning of the 260-day cycle initiated by Caban (column 3), and the activities related both to the maize cycle and to the day-names (column 4). Meanings related to the meaning of the day-name itself are designated by an asterisk. Clearly in the succession of 20 day-names, there is some semantic reflection of named 20-day stages through which the maize cycle passes. Thus thirteen of the day-names must have served as a shorthand mnemonic for stages in the maize cycle somewhere in the Maya region and at some stage in the evolution and diversification of Maya cultures. Yet because the maize cycle varies somewhat from lowlands to highlands and from region to region depending on rainfall, an isomorphic correspondence between 20 day period and named growth stage is not to be expected, except perhaps on an ideological level. To the extent that the full cycle from planting to harvest is inferred to have taken 260 days, one can speculate that the cosmogram integrating the life cycle of maize may have originated or become very influential as part of a symbol system somewhere in the highlands. V. Stages of maize growth The Pomona Flare, being too large to serve as an ear flare, is too complex simply to have named four stages in the growth of maize, though that may have been important cosmol?gica!ly. The flare could have been a divinatory surface, a kind of almanac mnemonic that could be used for counting days for the purpose of divination, while referencing the stages of maize growth. Its hieroglyphs remain undeciphered, and although some elements on the faces of the maize deity heads have been identified here, others await further scrutiny and identification (see justeson et al. 1988). The Cerros and Nohmul quincunx cache offerings demonstrate by their headdress patterns that they represent stages of maize. Using the growth stage metaphor one can account for much of the form and substance of these offerings, including an explanation for the fact that the bottom head is both smaller and has lost its left horn, signifying an immature maize ear. A ritual is suggested by the cache offering, one that anticipates on a regal scale a maize farmer of today breaking off the lower immature maize ear for eating, thereby allowing a corresponding increase in the size of the upper ear. The accompanying ritual could have referred to royal autosacrifice, and/or to the immolation of captives. That headdresses reflect an ordered relationship with stages of maize development in examples of ritual imagery from the Late Preclassic in Mesoamerica allows for identification of stages of maize development in headdresses elsewhere in Mesoamerican symbolism. A ripe maize ear sprouts from a seed atop the maize deity's head on the Princeton Plate, an Early Classic cache vessel to which a Peten provenience is attributed. Some one thousand years later, many Aztec deities appear to be wearing one stage or another of the sacred maize plant, and the Aztec king, like the ruler at La Mojarra, is often depicted with the full pair of maize ears somewhere in his headdress; at La Mojarra it is the "elder and younger brother" ears from the same cornstalk, whereas the Aztec king seems to have two fully developed elotes (fig. 18). Wider implications from the identifications herein advanced relate to earlier as well as later iconography in Mesoamerica. The Dallas Plaque, an Olmec piece from Guerrero (fig. 9d), with its central tree surrounded by four maize kernels, can be seen as an early form of the quincunx in which the central part is elongated; the typical abstract Olmec quincunx is simply a bar and four surrounding dots. Kent Reilly has suggested that the Olmec bar and four dot quincunx is an abstract depiction of the earth crocodile's body and four feet (1989: personal communication). The crocodile has long been associated with maize and also with the day named Imix in Mayan studies, and both the crocodile and the shark have been identified as the referent for the Aztec day named Cipactli, which is the counterpart of Maya Imix. In an important way, the crocodile, the shark, and maize are interchangeable according to Mesoamerican traditions. Additional inferences can be drawn from the identification of maize stages in relation to the many figurines found in early Mesoamerica.

From Codex Ixtlilxochitl, pt. 2., Biblioth?que Nationale, Paris. Drawing: Brian Stross. Chalcatzingo, for example, a Middle Formative site, nearly six thousand recognizable fragments of figurines have been excavated (fig. 19); there were found many heads broken off at the neck, a few torsos, and very few complete figures. Such a regular pattern indicates deliberate decapitation, according to Harlan (1987:252, 256-258). The decapitation theme is one that brings to mind the maize harvest, in which the head (the maize ear) is snapped from the body (the stalk). In view of the above identifications of maize spirit stages, it seems reasonable to suggest that the headdresses of some or all of these figurines might represent the maize spirit at various stages in its life cycle. Even further back in time, one also recalls Sejourn?'s perceptive argument that many of Tlatilco's Early Formative figures are representations of the maize spirit, wrought from motives of sympathetic magic (1978:49-53).

Although much effort will be required to fill out more of the maize picture in the Mesoamerican iconography of power, several points serve as guideposts to further research. The maize stage-related calendar and some of the ritual may have originated in the highlands, where the complete maize cycle more closely approximates the 260 days of the pan Mesoamerican ritual calendar. Equally important, the day-names of the ritual calendar appear to encode as much agricultural information as the month names of the agricultural solar calendar, in addition to a great deal of nonagricultural information that has been added over the centuries; thus, they may have served ritual and mnemonic functions related to agriculture in ways quite unsuspected, such as in scheduling maize planting activities from beginning to end of the maize cycle, and generating the times for ceremonial activities</page><page sequence="24">Stross: Maize and Fish 33 engaged in to secure the favor of the gods in order to ensure a good harvest. The shark has been a potent symbol of bloodletting and maize, and mountains and power at various times and places in Mesoamerica. No matter how ambiguous the data on this identification may be for some eras and places, it is quite unambiguous on the Late Preclassic La Mojarra Stela 1, which can be attributed to descendants of the Middle Preclassic Olmecs because of the Mixe-Zoquean language in which the text is written. Sharks and maize, and blood and power, are intertwined in the image on this stela, and elsewhere in Mesoamerican tradition, and the symbolic equation of sharks with maize is nowhere more clearly presented.

Stela 1, the Hauberg Stela, the Pomona Flare, and the Cerros and Nohmul caches, it appears that maize symbolism was even more closely incorporated into elite ritual during Preclassic times in Mesoamerica than previously thought (see also Taube 1985). Armed with knowledge of the range of maize symbolism and with Mesoamerican models of maize growth stages, it should be possible to press somewhat further toward motivated and accurate interpretations of rituals and relics long discontinued, discarded, and forgotten, known only from the partial evidence of archaeology.</page><page sequence="25">34 RES 25 SPRING 1994 BIBLIOGRAPHY Alcorn, Janis 1984 Huastec Mayan Ethnobotany.
