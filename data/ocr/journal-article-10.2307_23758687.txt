<plain_text><page sequence="1">Recent Archaeological Research at Matacapan, Veracruz: A Summary of the Results of the 1982 to 1986 Field Seasons Robert S. Santley, Ponciano Ortiz Ceballos, and Christopher A. Pool Since 1982 we have been conducting a seriesof archaeological investigations at Matacapan, a large Classic Period site in the Tuxtlas Mountains of southern Veracruz, Mexico (Santley et al. 1984a, 1984b, 1985b; Pool et al. n.d.) (see Fig. 1 ).Our origi nal reasons for undertaking research at Matacapan were to de fine the character of the Teotihuacan "presence" postulated to have existed at the site ( Valenzuela 1945) and to obtain data on Community socioeconomic structure and patterns of long-dis tance exchange. Since sites with evidence of a substantial pres ence are also often located near resources which were widely traded in antiquity (Santley 1983), we were especially inter ested in collecting information on prehistoriccraft production. This paper reports some of the results of that fieid research. The objectives outlined above required the followed fieldwork tasks. Initially, we completed a surface survey of the site. The surface survey strategy was multistaged, with an extensive sur vey conducted first to establish the boundaries of occupation loci, followed by a stratified program of systematic controlled surface collecting employing systematic interval transect sam pling to determine ranges of variability in the distribution of surface remains and then block sampling to define sources of internai variation at specific occupation loci. The survey re sults provided the basis for a series of stratigraphie excavations. The excavation program was designed to supply information 41</page><page sequence="2">Gulf of Mexico \ / -&gt; v \7fe . . • I \ ( \'S &lt;■ V '' #&gt; 4 \ Yucatan v Peninsula/'' s s-y y • Valley of Tulancingo v !

Over the course of four field seasons we surveyed an area of more than 20 km2 in size, produced a topographie map of main area of urban occupation, obtained more than 6,500 surface collections, and completed 100 stratigraphie ex cavations located in eleven différent parts of the site. A number of ancillary studies werealsoconducted. These included a gen eral reconnaissance of the Tuxtlas Region to obtain samples from fine paste clay sources for XRF analysis, an ethnoarchae ological study of contemporary pottery manufacture, and re search on modem land use patterns, household activity struc ture, and refuse disposai. The results produced thus far have bearing on three mayor is sues of archaeological interest: site occupational history and activity structure; craft production and long-distance ex change; and ethnicity, enclaves, and the Teotihuacan presence at the site. Data relative toeach of theseareasof interest are dis cussed below. Many of the inferences presented in the follow ing paragraphs, however, must be regarded as tentative since many relevant analyses are still in progress. OCCUPATION HISTORY AND SITE STRUCTURE Matacapan is a very large archaeological site covering at least 20 km2. Two major occupations are represented: an earlier Middle Formative occupation (ca. 900-600 B.C.) which was terminated by an éruption of the nearby volcano, San Martin; and a later Classic Period occupation (ca. A.D. 400-1000). Late Formative and Postclassic occupations occur on hills surround ing the main zone of bottomland settlement. The Middle Formative occupation occurs in pockets through out Matacapan. Each pocket apparently represents a small group of wattle-and daub structures occupied by farming households. Each structure had agarden situated nearby which was intensively cultivated and probably planted in maize (as evidence by ridgingand furrowing) and which alsoserved as a repository for household garbage. Tronco-conical storage pits were placed near dwellings and filled with trash after falling intodisuse. Although some Pachuca obsidian occurs in the For mative lithic assemblage, much of the material présent ¡s clear banded obsidian, which probably came from the Pico de Orizaba or Guadalupe Victoria source. Three réduction indus tries are represented duringthe OlmecPeriod: a percussion mi croblade industry; a prismatic pressure blade industry; and a | biface industry devoted primarily to the production of projec tile points. Most of the pottery retrieved from Formative con texts consists of Utility wares, primarily coarseware tecomates. Absent are the elaborately decorated services wäre found at San Lorenzo (Coe and Diehl 1980), Tres Zapotes (Weiant 1943), and La Venta (Drucker et al. 1959). Although the relative ab sence of status wares suggests that the Olmec component at Matacapan was not hierarchically organized, it is precisely what one would expect if Matacapan was occupied by small groups of egalitarian farmers. Miniature basait heads and stone ballcourt yokes, however, are présent, implying that the Middle Formative site did support some rank differentiation. Matacapan lay virtually unoccupied from the Middle Forma tive Period until the Classic Period. The Classic occupation contains two components: a substantial Middle Classic com ponent (ca. A.D. 400-600) which occurs throughout the site; and a more less common Late Classic component (ca. A.D. 600 1000) which is confined to a few localities in the main zone of civic-ceremonial architecture. Near mounds 1 and 2 there is evidence of an Early Classic component (ca A.D. 200-400) which predates the episode of Teotihuacan contact.</page><page sequence="3">PAVED ROADS DEPRESSION Fig. 2 The Middle Classic site is dominated by a large complex of Craft production, specialization, and long public buildings covering 1.5 km2 (see Fig. 2).

Subséquent research has demonstrated that materialsproduced Teotihuacan-style occurovera much larger area. Teotihuacan-style artifacts are présent in every excava tions that encountered Middle Classic occupation, but they occur as acomplex of materials principally in the Teotihuacan Barrio, in the area of urban residential occupation immediately to the west, in Bezuapan to the east of Comoapan, and in the Fine Gray and Fine Buff production zone in the southern part of the site. Teotihuacan residential architecture may also be présent. Mound 61, for example, consists of a complex of domestic structures, with room groups (apartments?) arranged around patios and separated from one another by intervening corridors, as at Teotihuacan (Millón 1973). The burial pattern involved the flexed interment of thedeceased below house floors within the structure, a Central Mexican practice (Sanders et al. 1982; Serrano and Lagunas 1974; Spence 1971). Represented in the sample are individuáis of both sexes and ail ages, including perinatals interred in vessels, a Teotihuacan mortuary custom. Grave goods found with adults included a large numberof cy lindrical tripod vessels with supports decorated in typical Teo tihuacan-style and imitation copaware. The evidence at hand supports the proposition that Matacapan supported a Teotihuacan enclave. Most of the materials that were rendered in Teotihuacan-style areobjects which appearto have had a ritual-ceremonial function (e.g„ figurines, can deleras, incensarios, seal stamps, cylindrical tripod vases) or a role in food préparation and consumption (e.g., braceros, cream pitchers). Two levels of Teotihuacan-inspired ritual-ceremo nial activity appear to be represented (Santley et al. n.d.a). Talud-tablero architecture and incensarios are présent in public contexts, implying a supra-household function. On the other hand, candeleras, figurines, cylindrical tripod vases, and seal stamps generally occur in private contexts along with domestic refuse, suggesting a role in family or household ritual. These cérémonials also involved the burial of the dead in typical Central Mexican fashion, often with locally-made copies of Teotihuacan goods as grave goods. This patterning agréés with evidence reported in the ethnographie literature which indi cates that enclave identity almost always is expressed as a rit ual ideology (Barth 1969; A. Cohen 1969; R. Cohen and Mid dleton 1970; Maybury-Lewis and Plattner 1984; Nagata 1984). The Teotihuacan presence at Matacapan was established abruptly sometime during the Middle Classic. The Teotihua can Barrio appears to have been occupied first. Later, a large zone of dense urban occupation richin Teotihuacan-style ma terials was founded around the barrio and main zone of mounded architecture. Many of Matacapan's principal public buildings may in factdate to this time period. The Teotihuacan presence at Matacapan thus stands in sharp contrast with that at Kaminaljuyu where the Teotihuacan occupation was confined mainly to a small complex of buildings located on the periph ery of the site (Kidder et al. 1946; Sanders and Michels 1977). Also, at Kaminaljuyu Teotihuacan household ritual-ceremo nial paraphernalia such as candeleras, figurines, seal stamps, and représentations of the deity, Huehueteotl, either are not présent or are extremely rare, and the persons interred in Mounds A and B were buried in typical Maya fashion. On the other hand, these materials occur at Matacapan where the dead were buried under house floors. According to William Sanders (1977), the Teotihuacan presence at Kaminaljuyu involved a group of maies who intermarried with local elites and gradually adopted Maya customs. In contrast, Matacapan appears to have supported a Teotihuacan enclave which contained adult mem bers of both sexes and which preserved its foreign identity by maintaining regular contacts with the Central Mexican me trópolis.

That evidence, we believe, indi cates that Matacapan contained an enclave of foreigners from Teotihuacan. The Teotihuacan-style assemblage from Mataca pan also contrasts sharply with materials from other South Gulf Coast sites. Cy lindrical tripod vases and candeleras do occur at Tres Zapotes (Weiant 1943), but they are not very common. In fact, all of the tripod supports and candeleras from Tres Zapo tes we have seen may very well have been imported from Mata capan. Teotihuacan-style materials also occur at Cerro de las Mesas (Stark: pers. comm.), but again they are very rare and only vaguely reminiscent of cylindrical tripods from Teotihua can or Matacapan. The same may be said for the Teotihuacan style tripod supports from Laguna de los Cerros. One implica tion from these linesof evidence is obvious: Teotihuacan mate rials are not uniformly distributed across the South Gulf Coast but are confined principally to the Tuxtlas Mountains, to Mata capan in particular. We suspect that Teotihuacan's reason for establishing abase in the Tuxtlas was primarily motivated by commercial factors. As we pointed out earlier, sites containing what have been inter preted as Teotihuacan enclaves are generally located near de posits of raw material widely traded in antiquity as well as on established trade routes. Matacapan's géographie location conforms to this pattern. The Tuxtlas contain the only readily available source of igneous rock for groundstone tools on the South Gulf Coast, and the région is centrally located relative to the Gulf of Mexico, a major route of coastal trade at the time of the Conquest, and the Rio Papaloapan and Rio Coatzacoalcos, the two principal arteries of riverine transit into the interior. Re</page><page sequence="7">liance on trafficking by canoe may explain how Matacapan, Tres Zapotes, Cerro de las Mesas, and other South Gulf Coast sites were able to import obsidian in bulk. Transport by canoe attenuates marketing hinterlands, allowing goods which nor mally could not be shipped very far to be moved much greater distances (Sanders and Santley 1983; Hassig 1985). Matacapan is also situated near a large complex of Pliocene clay deposits rieh in kaolinite which wereextensively reliedon forceramics in the Classic Period. While pottery produced from this clay was probably not shipped in great amounts beyond the Tuxtlas, the base claystone may have been. Kaolin is often used as a major ingrédient for slips, paints, and other décorative coatings because it fires white. It may therefore be no coincidence that white-slipped pottery is a common représentative in many South Gulf Coast ceramic assemblages. The Teotihuacan enclave at Matacapan probably served sev eral purposes. First, by setting up a base in the middle of the deposits of kaolin the Teotihuacan enclave would have been able to control the distribution of claystone long distances, and if transport was by canoe rather than overland, Teotihuacan merchants would have been able to move ceramic raw materials cheaply and in large lots. Basait for groundstone, tropical fruits, and other perishable bulky resources confined to the Tuxtlas may have been moved in a similar manner. Second, by Controlling access to ceramic raw materials the Teotihuacan enclave may have indirectly stimulated the development of Matacapan's ceramic production industry. Once the enclave was established, households which produced pottery in rural villages would begin migrating to the main center where sources of demand for ceramic goods were becoming more highly concentrated and economic opportunities were greater. Lack of inadéquate rural servicing would subsequently make the countryside more dépendent on urban-produced craft goods. Ultimately, an internally differentiated ceramic produc tion system would corne into being as marketing hinterlands increased in size and différent production entities produced goods fordifferent local and regional clientèles. Finally.abase in the Tuxtlas would have provided a convenient way station for Teotihuacan merchants traveling from Central Veracruz to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and the Maya Lowlands. Pottery fromtheareaaroundElTajin is reasonably common at Mataca pan, as are hollow Maya figurines. The presence of such materi als in frequency at Matacapan is exactly what we would expect if the site was a key node in a system of macro-regional ex change overseen by Teotihuacan. Itis also possible that elites from El Tajin and various Maya polities were key participants in the system, as John Molloy (n.d.) has suggested. Whether such was case, however, must await future research. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Research at Matacapan was conducted with the permission of the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia. Our field and laboratory research in the Tuxtlas was made possible by grants from the Tinker Foundation, the Mellon Foundation, the University of New Mexico, and particularly the National Science Foundation.

Der Fundort Matacapan in den Tuxtla-Bergen erlebte seine Blüte im Klassikum und scheint damals eine Schaltstelle zwischen dem zentralmexikanischen Hochland und dem Maya-Gebiet gewesen zu sein. Weitläufige Oberflächenerkundung und stratigraphische Grabungen der vergangenen Jahre geben nun Aufschluß über die zeitliche Phasen folge, Siedlungsformen und handwerkliche Spezialisierung des Ortes sowie dessen Beziehungen zur Metropole Teotihuacan. Die Interpretation der Funde spricht unter anderem für die zentralörtliche Funktion von Matacapan und eine Enklave von Fremden aus Teotihuacan. RESUMEN: La investigación arqueológica de Matacapan, Veracruz: una síntesis de los resultados de las campañas 1982-1986. El lugar de hallazgo Matacapan en las montañas de Tuxtla tuvo su auge en la época clásica y parece haber sido punto de intercalación entre la serranía del México cen tral y la zona Maya. Extensas exploraciones de superficie y excavaciones estratigráficas en los años pasados dan ahora explicación sobre la sucesión de fases, la forma de colonización y la especialización artesanal del pob lado, así como sus relaciones con la metrópoli Teotihuacán. La in terpretación de los hallazgos afirma entre otras cosas la función centralista de Matacapan y un enclave de extraños provenientes de Teotihuacán.</page></plain_text>
