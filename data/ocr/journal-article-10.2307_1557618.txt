BARBARA ZABEL Perpetual Motif proves to be a perfect description--really the overriding metaphor - for Man Ray's career in that it succinctly symbolizes the driving energy and inventive- ness of this American artist.' Man Ray's final version of one of Surrealism's more arresting objects, the conjoining of a metronome and a photographic cutout of an eye, introduces the major themes of his oeuvre. Serious yet playful, straightforward yet multileveled, the work in- corporates the readymade materials of Dada, the unex- pected reverberations of Surrealism, and radical manip- ulations of photography. It also announces the artist's ambivalent love affair with the machine and his role as detached observer. In wrenching an eye from its ana- tomical context and transferring it to the realm of ma- chine control, the artist comments on the impact of the machine in twentieth-century life. Man Ray's love for punning and puzzles also tempts us to read the eye as the first person pronoun, thus emphasizing the work's autobiographical significance and Man Ray's own sense of detachment. Man Ray thus presents himself as Dadaist/ Surrealist/photographer/object maker with restless, per- 29</page><page sequence="2">?E SZliBLs* I .i*** i':i?`lf~~ft~t~5~8~a"~"~""11"1~~~"'-*~; ;6 i..I:. : ....r*** ????-?r*r rll Rs~--???F~nsnnea~P--r~UI?~rZ~;t:~:E:;r;r ....~~~~?~?** -\-rr** ***.ri**r*****?*?;;i;i;'r*~rr*.~?-;: r::ii*"**"'*" ~r*?u.r**r~***.?*.rc-11*1**'1"?'?"'?". ;ii***.?.?*..r,*??*~r ~~~ ??-~ ?- ?- ? -' ? . : .

In her introductory essay Merry Foresta, the organizer of the exhibition Perpetual Motif, provides an excellent context for Man Ray's embrace of modernism, which from the beginning meant taking an adversarial position. Photography was attractive to Man Ray precisely because it provoked controversy at the time. Also considered shocking was Man Ray's appropriation of techniques used by commercial artists, for example the airbrush. Yet, while Man Ray was on the one hand a revolutionary embod- iment of the avant-garde, he was also a commercial pho- tographer. Foresta confronts this dichotomy, discussing the trouble his critics--and the artist himself--had in effectively reconciling his overriding desire for creative freedom with his commercial enterprises. The rapprochement of high and low that Man Ray seems to propose in his art has a certain currency today. Because of his seemingly easy adaptation to the com- mercial world and his appropriations from so-called low culture, he anticipates postmodern modes of making art.2 However, to fit him into this mold is to suppress the contradictions inherent in Man Ray's art and career. Man Ray felt alienated from bourgeois society, yet he desper- ately wanted acceptance and financial support from it. Subversive and oppositional, Man Ray's modernism functioned against its society, but at the same time its slick commercial side seems inconsistent with revolu- tionary intent. Rather than resolve such conflicts, Foresta manages to keep the contradictions alive by presenting Man Ray as a creature of his own times. Taking on what she calls the "unruly subject of Man Ray," Foresta invites further chaos by inviting seven other scholars to con- tribute essays. While at times a bit redundant, the result works remarkably well, presumably because of careful guidance and editing on Foresta's part. Given the task of surveying the development of Man Ray's art until he left for Paris, Francis Naumann, in "Man Ray, 1908-1921: From an Art in Two Dimensions to the Higher Dimension of Ideas," achieves a lucid explication of the early works and the motivating forces behind them. He masterfully demonstrates how Man Ray found his way from the derivative and mimetic to the iconoclastic and inventive, how he finally liberated himself from tra- ditional media and subjects to begin experimenting with new methods, first collage and assemblage and then aerography. Naumann recognizes the Revolving Doors col- lages of 1916-1917 as pivotal works in this process of discovery. Not only do they use nontraditional materials (pasted paper) and subjects (drills, concrete mixers, and dirigibles), but they also introduce the idea of a work of art as a construction. These collages thus set the stage for a remarkable series of assembled objects, including New York (1917), Lampshade (1919), and Obstruction (1920). Marcel Duchamp's role in inspiring this new direction was of course crucial, and Naumann gives a discerning account of the beginning of their lifelong friendship and the impact of the Frenchman's ideas. However, Naumann seems to exaggerate the differences between the artists' Man Ray, New York, 1917. Wood strips and carpenter's C-clamp.

He maintains that Man Ray "preferred to alter or manipulate the design of the manu- factured piece, sometimes by combining it with other objects and/or by adding provocative titles to create a sense of poetic expression"; whereas Duchamp usually chose objects "at random" on the basis of "aesthetic indifference" and gave them titles that had "nothing to do with the objects themselves."3 Recent scholarship on Duchamp, and on Fountain in particular, has played down the idea of randomness in his selection of objects and titles. William Camfield has shown that while the notion of "aesthetic indifference" was popularized by Duchamp himself late in his career, Fountain, in the context of 1917, displays anything but randomness.4 And Wanda Corn has pointed out that the work was, on one level at least, Duchamp's criticism of American artists who did not no- tice the new America of mass production, and that the title may have been his satiric jab at Americans' greater obsession with the modern bathroom than with public statuary and fountains.5 For Duchamp the work was thus a deliberate comment on what was deemed important in American culture. Like Fountain, Man Ray's New York of 1917, a carpenter's C-clamp with a tight grip on wood strips that signify skyscraper forms, alludes to American progress; it comments as well on the constriction of Man Ray's dada spirit in New York. "Dada cannot live in New York," Man Ray wrote, "all New York is dada and will not tolerate a rival,--will not notice dada."6 New York and Fountain thus demonstrate how both artists delib- erately selected objects--as well as titles--to comment on the culture they lived in and their place in that culture. Naumann astutely notes, however, that rather than pre- senting actual objects, as Duchamp was more prone to do, Man Ray frequently created a photographic record of the readymades so as to exercise control over the view- er's point of view "to more succinctly link the subject to its suggestive title."7 Indeed, Man Ray's photographs of such found objects as an eggbeater (Man), a section of a rifle (Rebus), and a wrapped object (The Enigma of Isidore Ducasse) rival his found objects as his most intriguing works. In "Man Ray, Paris," Billy Kliiver and Julie Martin have written less about the works themselves than about Paris in the twenties, providing a colorful description of Man Ray's place in this world. The cross section they present is very rich indeed, since the artist took part in so many different aspects of Paris life--not only in the avant-garde world of art and literature, but also in the realm of the rich and famous via his portrait commissions, the world of fashion through his work for designer Paul Poiret, and the nightclub scene through his mistress Kiki. The authors also remind us of a crucial characteristic of the Paris art world: the acceptance it has traditionally offered artists of any nationality.8 Acceptance was not of course automatic; indeed, there was something quite unique about Man Ray, his art, and postwar Paris that made it possible for him to slip so easily into the Parisian art scene. This is the topic explored in essays by Elizabeth Hutton Turner and Stephen C. Foster. Man Ray, Untitled, ca. 1928-1929. Black and white photograph. 'J I I "~* ~d, ~ ?ula,..~J?i3SSt 31</page><page sequence="4">Turner's "Transatlantic" is especially incisive in specu- lating why Man Ray was embraced by the innermost circles of the Paris art world. She characterizes Man Ray as a "jeune fille Americaine"--as providing "the spark of new life the Europeans so wanted," or as Tzara put it: "He had invented the force of tender and fresh light- ning."9 At least in part, this perception of Man Ray was a function of the Europeans' excitement about his cam- eraless photographic experiments, his rayographs, called by Tzara "pure Dada creations." The ready acceptance of Man Ray's innovations in France, however, did not ensure that America would follow suit. Man Ray des- perately wanted America's recognition, but he knew his growing commitment to Dada and to unorthodox uses of the camera would undermine that acceptance. It was Man Ray's open renunciation of what he called "the sticky medium of paint" that ultimately liberated him from the pressures of New York."' While Turner focuses on the often conflicting bicontinental demands on the artist, Stephen C. Foster in "Configurations of Freedom" analyzes the internecine struggles within the tightly knit art circles of Paris. Amazingly, Man Ray managed to function independently in the midst of raging crises, es- pecially the conflict between Tristan Tzara and Andre Breton. Foster also argues that while Man Ray did not buy "the overarching social utopianism" of Surrealism, his art is not without social purpose. As Man Ray wrote, "All progress results from an intense individual desire to improve the immediate present, from an all-conscious sense of material insufficiency. In this exalted state, ma- terial action imposes itself and takes the form of revo- lution in one form or another." While the artist had no "historical mission," he had the highest faith in the in- dividual and in the revolutionary purposes of art. Foster provides a perceptive analysis of how these key articles of faith inform Man Ray's art. The artist was preoccupied with dissociating objects from their usual function, and such "disturbance of norms" can be seen as fulfilling the artist's subversive agenda." Appropriately, then, the core of the book centers on Man Ray's strengths during the high point of his career, the inter-War years: Naumann highlights the emergence of the artist's collage aesthetic in the late teens; Turner, the revolutionary significance of his rayographs in the twenties; and Foster, the "decontextualization" of objects assembled in his Paris years. In "Themes and Variations: Man Ray's Photography in the Twenties and Thirties," Sandra S. Phillips underscores the paramount importance of photography to Man Ray. Indeed, his statements of the time corroborate this: "I never stopped believing that painting is an obsolete form of expression and that pho- tography will dethrone it when the public is visually educated."'2 The author sees Alfred Stieglitz as a key inspirational figure because of his strong belief in the medium, yet the older master also provided a strong force against which to react. Indeed, according to Phillips Man Ray's early experiments, such as Man of 1918, a pho- tograph of an eggbeater, function as "an antidote to Stieglitz's aestheticism and idealism," demonstrating a . , .

Because the title of this work puns on the artist's name, and the image is mark- edly anthropomorphic, this work is autobiographical. The frequency of such autobiographical allusions in his work underscores Man Ray's strong identification with photography. " For his photographic works Man Ray often started with "oddball, ordinary things," which he then tended to de- materialize via the rayographic process, concentrating on their shadows, on the ghostly absence of the objects rather than the objects themselves. The mysterious aura re- sulting from such dematerialization was increased in his more surrealistic, and more erotic, photographs of the 1930s.'4 Particularly in his many images of women, Man Ray utilizes surrealist techniques of manipulation. As Rosalind Krauss has shown, instead of a truthful re- vealing of the real in straight photography (e.g., as in Paul Strand), Man Ray's photographs, with their strange solarizations, double exposures, and displacements, em- body a betrayal of reality." Indeed, women increasingly appear as obsessional objects as the artist manipulates their images into fetishes. While Phillips does survey the erotic elements in his works, on the whole she plays down the fetishistic implications of Man Ray's photographs of nudes. This is not a whitewashing of Man Ray; quite a few of his most potent surrealist images are reproduced in the book, and they speak strongly on their own, but they also cry out for a more in-depth analysis than Phillips provides. 32</page><page sequence="5">In "Exile in Paradise: Man Ray in Hollywood, 1940- 1951," Foresta provides a necessary summary of the art- ist's activities in California, where the artist clearly wanted to make his mark as a painter instead of as a photog- rapher. There he continued to make and remake objects, and it is in them that the artist's characteristic inven- tiveness is most apparent; the paintings by comparison are disappointing. Whether this was a failure of nerve or a response to the fundamental conservatism of Los An- geles is not clear. The strength of the essay is Foresta's discussion of the way in which Man Ray became "both a conduit of historical surrealism and a synthesizer of his own past. 16 It was a fortunate editorial decision not to end the book with these rather anticlimactic Hollywood years. Roger Shattuck's final essay "Candor and Perversion in No-Man's Land" in a sense redeems the artist, in that it gives a fresh interpretation of Man Ray with an eye on the most successful periods of his career. Shattuck nudges us to look at Man Ray in relationships that are as un- expected as they are revealing. Thomas Paine, James McNeill Whistler, and John Reed are not names which readily come to mind when thinking about Man Ray, yet Shattuck finds telling parallels. And Nadar, Lautria- mont, and the Marquis de Sade have probably never been cited as "collaborators" of Man Ray, yet here too a con- vincing case is made. These esoteric allusions do not serve, however, to further perpetuate the mysterious aura which has tended to obscure the artist's accomplish- ments. Like Foresta, Shattuck sees Man Ray as part of an American tradition of pragmatism. He uses the French term, "bricoleur," to describe Man Ray's "handyman" propensity to use whatever was available." In describing the artist in this down-to-earth way, Shattuck appropri- ately situates the mystique of Man Ray in the work rather than the man; and indeed mystery is, according to Shat- tuck, one of the key ingredients in his art (the others being humor and the erotic)." While the man and his motives are straightforward, the work tends to be the multileveled, ambiguous, and mysterious. Perhaps, then, Man Ray is best described in his own words as a "practical dreamer." 19 Perpetual Motif brings together the latest research on Man Ray. In particular it provides a trenchant analysis of Man Ray's relationship to European modernism; in- deed, the focus of many of the essays is Man Ray the expatriate - that is, the artist's accommodation to French avant-garde circles. In presenting Man Ray as a kind of a tinkerer or jack-of-all-trades several of the authors seem to concur on the Americanness of Man Ray's approach to art making. But is there something about the resulting works which reveals an American inflection? Is there something unique, perhaps a unifying pattern, in his ma- terials and subjects which distinguishes his works from those of his European contemporaries? A fuller under- standing of his role as an expatriate depends on further consideration of Man Ray's relation to American art. The essays here have advanced our understanding of Man Ray as a modernist and have revived debate about the relationship between art and commerce in the artist's work. This is a book which will reward attention on these subjects, generate further discussion, and provide the base on which Man Ray research will build for some time.
