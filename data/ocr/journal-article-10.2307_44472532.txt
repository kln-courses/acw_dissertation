NASA Headquarters ABSTRACT Recent Presidential directives have intensified the study of human participation in Solar System Exploration within the United States. NASA has updated its planning baseline for these missions, (1) and has identified improved life support as one of the key capabilities needed to enable long duration missions of exploration. This paper discusses the question of life support for the exploration missions of the future, and suggests a strategy for the development of these critical systems. INTRODUCTION As humans move out from Earth into the solar system, their most immediate challenge is to provide a life-supporting environment in locations that are naturally devoid of food, air, and water. Without these life support commodities there can be no exploration, no reaching out, no discovery. Life support systems for exploration will provide these commodities in all phases of the exploration missions: during intravehicular activities (IVA) within space transfer vehicles, while living in surface habitats, and while moving around in pressurized rovers, and during extravehicular activity (EVA). There are certain design drivers that are common to all life support systems (Table 1). Current IVA life support systems provide a habitable environment in space, but at great cost. The open-loop life support systems currently in use by the United States require that TABLE 1 IVA LIFE SUPPORT DESIGN DRIVERS Overall system reliability in the space environment (1/6 g, |x-g, etc.) - Maintainable/replaceable during a mission - Allow for component down-time Reduced resupply mass (consumables, spares, etc.) Minimized Mass, Power, and Volume Reqts. • Ability to use in situ resources for increased self sufficiency - Lunar and Mars resources transformable into water, air, &amp; food the air, food, and water needed by humans in space be resupplied from Earth. These same systems are unable to recycle the waste products that result, and these must be returned to Earth or left in space. Since humans require approximately 6.5 kg of potable water, air, and food each day, provisions for a crew of 4 run to nearly 9500 kg per year. In addition, if the crew is to bathe, wash dishes, flush toilets, and clean clothes, then the crew need swells to nearly 28,500 kg of provisions each year. This is the overhead on space operations. As long as mass to orbit is a quantity to be conserved, then recycling of life support commodities represents the one of the best ways to lower this overhead. The situation is even more acute for exploration missions to the moon and Mars. For example, because of the additional cost of Earth- 709</page><page sequence="2">moon transportation, as much as 7 times the mass required on the lunar surface must be delivered to low-Earth orbit (LEO) prior to delivery to the moon. Supplying the minimum set of life support consumables for one person, without hygiene and wash water, would require approximately one heavy lift launch vehicle every two years to LEO. This additional mass penalty makes it even more important to develop regenerative, recycling life support systems to enable the exploration goals of permanent human presence and eventual self sufficiency. Regenerative systems will be crucial to allowing the use of local resources to provide the full range of life support needs, as humans learn to "live off the land" away from the Earth. If the success of the exploration missions is dependent on the ability of humans to work and explore on different planetary surfaces, then this success will be dependent on productive extravehicular activity, conducted at great distances from the support systems of Earth. During these missions astronauts will be exposed to a range of gravity conditions and a diversity of environments. Robitic systems will be able to offset only a portion of the EVA requirement. With the normally intense activity that is expected on the exploration missions, issues of productivity, usability, durability, and maintainability of EVA suits will become more acute. Operational and medical considerations will include prebreathing regimes, life support system capability, environmental health, radiation protection, and emergency-mode operations. Allowing humans to transition simply and effectively between IVA and EVA will both enhance productivity, and increase overall mission safety. Technology has been developed that has allowed successful, short-term, EVA on the lunar surface (1/6 g). For long stays on a planetary surface, however, current systems are incompatible with mission requirements in most areas. Apollo technology is not maintainable, and is too massive for use on Mars (2/5 g), while Shuttle (and potential Space Station Freedom) suits are designed for limited use in p-g environment only, and are even more massive. Future EVA systems will have to deal with the additional demands of the exploration opportunity. Such systems will undoubtedly include enhanced anthropomorphic suits similar to those now in use, but may also include new elements that blur the line between suits and spacecraft. LIFE SUPPORT STRATEGY The mission design activity for the exploration missions has posed requirements for life support systems to meet a variety of needs. IVA systems are required for lunar and Mars transfer vehicles (LTV, MTV), lunar and Mars excursion vehicles (LEV, MEV), a set of lunar and Mars habitats, and a pressurized rover. EVA systems must be provided for the moon, Mars, and for space operations on orbit and in transit. There are limitations on the amount of mass brought to LEO, and demands and restrictions on the operations of all of the various systems. For IVA systems in particular, there is the requirement for long-duration habitation on planetary surfaces leading to permanent human presence away from Earth, for as many as 8 people. Perhaps the most challenging set of systems are those required for Mars exploration, where the Mars Transfer Vehicle must have a resupply-independent life support capability that will last as much as 3 years, and a Mars Habitat that will support 5 people for 500 days. EVA capabilities required are repeated, productive surface activity for up to 8 hours each day for up to 6 days a week. Suits must be maintained by the crew, and must be resistant to contamination by planetary materials such as dust. For both EVA and IVA systems it will be critical that these functions be achieved with the provision of a safe, non-toxic environment and with food and water supplies that are not only free of contamination, but provide adequate nutrition and psychological benefits. These systems must be provided by building from today's capabilities and developing systems in an evolutionary fashion as much as possible. The baseline capability is defined as the systems designed for the Space Station Freedom (SSF) permanently manned capability (PMC), and for the Shuttle extended duration orbiter (EDO). From this baseline a program will be designed to provide growth into more capable systems for use on the Moon, and to 710</page><page sequence="3">use the lunar experience and SS F system testbeds to provide the life support upgrades needed for Mars. IVA LIFE SUPPORT Based on the needs of the exploration missions, the following design guidelines have been specified: • Use closed-loop systems wherever practicable to reduce logistics requirements. • Use open-loop systems wherever power, mass, volume, and operational requirements dictate, or where development timelines preclude the use of a closed-loop system. • For habitats and long-duration transfer vehicles, provide for life support system growth and evolution as technology progresses. An example of the last would be the establishment of a core physical-chemical system in a habitat that would be compatible with the later provision of plant-growth systems that could provide food as well as air and water to the habitat. IVA life support systems must address the following performance areas: • Air Revitalization • Water Purification • Food Supply • Waste Processing • Environmental Monitoring • Thermal and Humidity control • Fire Suppression • System Control • Local Resource Conversion SYSTEM DESIGN GOALS - Life support systems to be developed for the exploration missions fall into three basic groups. Details are given in Table 2: LTV. LEV. MEV. and Pressurized Rovnr - Open systems are presently baselined for these vehicles because these applications are either near-term, precluding development of more closed systems, or are low-power systems where regenerative life support may not pay direct benefits. All of these applications have relatively short use times, and have operational restrictions that allow the use of open life support. Lunar Habitat. MTV - These applications are baselined to use physical-chemical regenerative systems as the basis for their design, with some fresh food (salad) supplementation to provide a diet enhancement for long-duration use. Because of both development timeline for the Lunar Habitat and the p-g environment requirement for the MTV, both of these designs are expected to have significant SSF heritage. Significant enhancement of SSF systems will, however, be required. Such enhancements may provide significant benefits back to SSF. Upgraded Lunar Habitat. Mars Habitat - These systems must meet the needs of applications where there are a number of people living for a long period of time. Minimizing resupply needs to offload the logistics train and provide the basis for self-sufficiency is paramount. The development time-lines for these applications will allow the perfection and testing of hybrid physical-chemical and bioregenerative systems. Bioregenerative capability can be added to an appropriate enhanced-technology physical- chemical core system incrementally over time. The use of local resources will further reduce resupply. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS - In order to provide technologies for IVA life support, an intensive development program must be initiated now. Regenerative life support systems are critical to the exploration missions, but they have yet to be tested with humans. The overall investment in this area has been low for a number of years, preventing candidate technologies from being brought to an acceptable level of maturity. It will be a major challenge for SSF, at PMC, to use recycling technology to supply a portion of the potable water and all of the hygiene and wash water for the crew. Regenerative oxygen revitalization and complete drinking water recycling are also envisioned. It is essential to the exploration 711</page><page sequence="4">("I g H ÇO CC UJ H O &lt; CC &lt; X ÏÏ2 CD (0 &lt; LU HQ &lt; &gt; ř cc o CL Û.

For some systems required by the exploration missions, present technologies will suffice. The life support systems requirements for the Lunar Transfer and Lunar Excursion Vehicles are adequately met by technologies from Skylab, PMC Space Station Freedom, and the EDO. These systems can be identified and integrated during the course of vehicle development. Variants on those systems should be appropriate for the Mars Excursion Vehicle and for a Pressurized Rover. Other technologies need to be readied for the Mars Transfer Vehicle and for the various habitats (Mars, moon). A two-phase program is needed to develop these new systems. The initial program must include an accelerated process and subsystem, and system technology development program that will capture SSF technologies and ready new technologies as appropriate (both physical/ chemical and bioregenerative system concepts), and that will use breadboards, technology testbeds, and flight opportunities for proof-of- concept testing at the systems level. Without this systems level development, component-level processes and subsystems cannot be considered ready for further development. This technology development program will require a range of facilities, from university and industry labs to dedicated laboratory-scale breadboards, to low-fidelity human-rated testbeds. The second development phase requires an advanced development program that will use mission system testbeds for integration of specific mission-capable life support systems. These testbeds will use component technologies proven in the technology development program and marry them into systems intended to meet specific mission needs. Because of the special demands imposed on the Mars Transfer Vehicle life support system, ji-g testing of that system is essential. PROGRAMMATIC RISK/SCHEDULE DRIVERS - Due to the relative lack of technological maturity in the area of IVA life support, an immediate commitment needs to be made to the development of these systems if the current exploration schedules are to be supported. Readiness for missions will slip without immediate budget resources to gain technology readiness from SSF program upgrades and without providing for the advanced development of the Lunar Habitat system. Life Support architectures must be planned with integration and growth in mind, and with an awareness of the uncertainties associated with currently-available technologies. As soon as possible it is necessary to begin upgrading SSF technology for Lunar use, and bringing to maturity those additional technologies required, and starting work on an advanced development testbed for the Lunar Habitat. Meanwhile a strong physical-chemical and biological technologies development program must be funded to prepare for the later development of more capable systems. EVA LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM DESIGN GOALS - EVA systems for exploration missions will provide the basis for much of the operational capability of the missions. Human interaction with planetary surfaces, the ability to construct and maintain space vehicles, and the emplacement of a surface infrastructure will be augmented by robotic helpers, but will ultimately depend on these systems. Whether provided by an EVA suit alone, or by more complex systems, there are a set of desirable features associated with EVA systems: • Minimize time to transition between IVA and EVA Particularly important here is the difference between the habitat pressure and the pressure of the EVA system. The difference in pressures affects the likelihood that a crewmember will develop the bends, with a greater difference being less safe than a smaller one. Conversely, higher EVA pressures demand more robust EVA systems, and can limit the capability of systems because of higher mass 713</page><page sequence="6">requirements and less capable suit gloves at the higher pressures. • Maximize time available for productive EVA If the EVA system depends on human power for mobility, then suit mass can be a limiting factor on EVA time. Portable Life Support System capacity and ease of recharging is another constraint. As EVA durations increase, the ability to supply food and remove wastes from the crewmember must be taken into account, and concerns about air and water quality and radiation protection become more pronounced. Overall time for EVA on a mission of course is a factor of the maintainability of the EVA system. Systems must be designed to reduce the need for extensive overhaul after use. • Allow minimum restriction on normal human capabilities Such constraints as suit mass and overall size can limit human capabilities in an EVA system. If humans are to routinely do hard work during EVA then the full range of metabolic levels must be supported with adequate thermal control. Suit mobility in the area of gloves, the torso, and boots are important to overall productivity. Communications capability of the EVA system must support crewmember- crewmember and crewmember-habitat interactions for safety and productivity reasons. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS - Current capabilities in planetary surface EVA derives from the Apollo experience. That experience provides an excellent starting point for future missions. The Apollo suit was a limited-lifetime design, without extensive maintenance and refurbishment provisions, and was affected by dust contamination. In addition, the low pressure suit design would prohibit use of higher-pressure habitats, while the mass of that suit would be too high for use on Mars. In the area of p.-g EVA, there have been significant advancements, though maintenance and refurbishment requirements are still high with the Shuttle suit. SSF suit development has TABLE 3 EVA SYSTEM FEATURES SINCE APOLLO 12) Apollo Shuttle SS Freedom* Suit Mass 27 kg 50 kg -90 kg PLSSMass 62 kg 73 kg ~ 195 kg Total Mass 89 kg 1 23 kg -285 kg Operating Pressure 258 hPa 296 hPa 572 hPa PLSS Expendables Resupply Resupply Regenerate • Preliminary estimates provided greatly improve glove technology, better than Apollo, but higher suit pressures are still a major challenge. Existing PLS Systems are large, and require extensive logistical support (Table 3). To meet the needs of the exploration missions, it is anticipated that the EVA system being developed for SSF will meet the needs of in-space EVA, but that extensive development will be needed for planetary surface EVA systems. The needs of this development can be met by a parallel technology development program that will minimize the risks for surface EVA systems by providing light-weight, high pressure suit options need to be readied for advanced development. Technology areas to be emphasized include: • Lightweight and durable materials • Glove design • Dust contamination protective measures and techniques • Lower torso mobility systems for walking • Ancillary mobility systems for surface transportation • Lightweight, compact, PLSS technologies EVA technology options will be weighed during the advanced development of the EVA system to assure integration of EVA elements, the medical and environmental control needs, and habitat interfaces. It will be particularly 714</page><page sequence="7">important to bring an integrated system approach to this activity. After advanced development, mission systems should undergo extensive testing prior to use. Given the initial time-lines envisioned for the exploration missions (1), it is clear that the development of the initial lunar system will be much more constrained than that for Mars. Enhancements to the lunar technologies must be continued throughout the lunar phase of these missions. Improvements over the lunar technology will be essential for Mars, and most can be tested on the moon. PROGRAMMATIC RISK/SCHEDULE DRIVERS - As with IVA life support, the EVA system development activity is a pacing element for the conduct of the exploration program. Readiness for these missions will slip without immediate budget resources to provide technology readiness and an advanced development focus. Near-term activities that must be initiated include suit prototype fabrication, PLSS breadboarding, and the development of EVA mobility-aid technologies and strategies. Extensive environmental monitoring and requirements research needs to be undertaken, and phase-A studies for the lunar suit advanced development effort must be started as soon as possible.
