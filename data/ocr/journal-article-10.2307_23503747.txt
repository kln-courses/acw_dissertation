<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE TREATMENT OF ANTHROPOMORPHISMS AND ANTHROPOPATH ISMSANTHROPOPATH ISMS IN THE SEPTUAGINT OF ISAIAH* HARRY M. ORLINSKY Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion, New York. 1. 1. While preparing an analysis of 1־0-7/כי־פי הוא ציה κύρως everei λατο avTois in Isa. 34.16 for my "Studies in the St. Mark's Isaiah Scroll, VI" (this Annual, 25 [1954], 85 ff.) I found it necessary to determine the attitude that the Septuagint translator1 of Isaiah dis played towards the anthropomorphisms and anthropopathisms that he found in his Hebrew text. The present article is the result of the study. 2. It should be stated at the very outset that the few studies that have been made recently of this aspect of Bible translation do not indicate that their authors attacked the problem objectively. Whether they were conscious of it or not, they started out with the notion that the physical and other human attributes of God as described in the text of the Hebrew Bible were repulsive to the Septuagint translators. Consequently, they tended to overlook the many passages in the Septuagint where the "hand" or "foot" or "anger" of God was repro duced literally in the Septuagint, and attributed anti-anthropomorphic tendencies to the translator in the one or two passages where these words were not reproduced literally. In short, the methodology was faulty, and the conclusions invalid and misleading. *I have employed the following abbreviations: MT for Masoretic Text (any printed edition); LXX for the Septuagint, J. Ziegler's model edition of Isaias (1939) in the Gottingen series; JPS for the Jewish Publication Society Translation of the Hebrew Bible (1917) ; RSV for the Revised Standard Version of the Holy Bible (1952); Schleusner for his Novus Thesaurus Philologico-Criticus . . . Veteris Testa menti,menti, 5 vols. (Lipsiae, 1820). 1 On the possibility of a separate translator for Chapters 36-39, see the latter part of §7 below. J. Ziegler, "Einleitung," pp. 95 ff., saw no reason to suspect more than one translator for the entire Book. 193</page><page sequence="2">[2] 194 HARRY M. ORLINSKY 3. In 1943 C. T. Fritsch published his doctoral dissertation on The Anti-Anthropomorphisms Anti-Anthropomorphisms of the Greek Pentateuch. In general, not many scholars made direct study of the author's data and methodology, and some of them tended to accept the conclusions of this work un critically.2 In my somewhat detailed review of this work (in Crozer Quarterly,Quarterly, 21 [1944], 156-1603), I attempted to demonstrate how Fritsch "allowed himself, quite without realizing it of course, to be misled by his predecessors into accepting as a premise what he should first have demonstrated to be a true proposition; namely, he should have proved that we are really dealing with anti-anthropomorphisms, etc., before assembling, classifying, and discussing them as such. As a matter of fact, the reviewer is now convinced more than ever, as a result of Dr. Fritsch's collection of the data, that what have been re garded by virtually everyone as instances of an anti-anthropomorphic attitude on the part of the Septuagint translators are the result of nothing more tendentious than mere stylism, with theology and philosophy playing no direct role whatever in the matter . . ." {op. cit.,cit., pp. 156-7). Thus Fritsch made nothing of the fact that the LXX translated the "face" of God literally 18 (!) times in the Pentateuch, and proceeded to create an anti-anthropomorphic fiction out of one ( !) instance of this phenomenon — and an alleged one at that {ibid). My criticisms dealt also with the "eyes," "wrath," "mouth" and "hand" of God, the pronominal suffix "His," and several alleged anti-anthro pomorphisms.4 "E.g., I. Soisalon-Soininen, Die Textformen der Septuaginta-Ubersetzung des RichterbuchesRichterbuches (Helsinki, 1951), pp. 83-4; R. Loewe, "Jerome's Treatment of an Anthropomorphism," Vetus Testamentum, 2 (1952), 262 n. 2. J. Reider's review (JBL 63 [1944] 203-5) asserted that "As to the numerous cases of anti-anthro pomorphism listed in the book, not all of them can be accepted as such without demur . . . The author's judgment may be challenged also on other points . . ." 3 Cf. also §1 on pp. 32-3 of my article on "The Septuagint — its Use in Textual Criticism" (Biblical Archaeologist, 9 [May 1946]). 4 The lack of methodology is apparent also in such works as J. Wevers' article on "Exegetical Principles Underlying the Septuagint Text of I Kings ii 12 —xxi 43" {Oudtestamentische{Oudtestamentische Studïén, 8 [1950], 318), and the article by Loewe cited in n. 2 preceding. A particularly glaring case in point is D. H. Gard's interpretation of The ExegeticalExegetical Method of the Greek Translator of the Book of Job (JBL Monograph Series, Vol. VIII, 1952); cf. my review in JBL, 73 (1954), 251-3; and that by G. Zuntz in L'Antiquité L'Antiquité Classique, 22 (1953), 538-41. In his descriptive listing of "Septuaginta Forschungen," § II. Die Septuaginta als Ubersetzungsurkunde (Theologische Rund schau,schau, 22 [1954], 171 fL), J. W. Wevers is less than objective in his treatment of the works by Fritsch and Gard (174-5, !87-90), colleagues of his at Princeton Theological Seminary. Cf. A. Soffer's Critical Note on " 'The House of God/Lord' in the Septu agint of the Pentateuch," JBL, 75 (June, 1956).</page><page sequence="3">[3] ANTHROPOMORPHISMS AND ANTHROPOPATHISMS 195 4. My conclusion that "What is involved is not theology, but stylism and intelligibility" holds good not only for the Pentateuchal material but also for the Septuagint of Job (op. cit., 159-160), and now also for the Septuagint of Isaiah, as will be indicated below. In addition, my student Arthur Soffer is completing for his Master of Hebrew Letters thesis a detailed study of the treatment of anthropomorphisms and anthropopathisms in the Septuagint of Psalms, and the data have led him to the identical conclusion. 5. The "hand" (יד) of God occurs 38 times in the Hebrew text of Isaiah. It is reproduced in the Septuagint literally (ף xe'P) on ah but 2 occasions: 1.25; 5.13, 25 (bis); 8.11; 9.11, 16, 20; 10.4; 11.11, 15; 14.26, 27; 19.16; 23.11; 29.23; 31.3; 34.17:40.2; 41.20:43.13; 45.11, 12; 48.13; 49.2, 22; 50.2; 51.16, 17; 59.1; 60.21 (epya avrov for masoretic 14 ,66.2 ;65.2 ;64.7 ;62.3 ; (5מעשה ירי.

The "ear" of God (אזן) was rendered literally (to ous) in 5.9; 22.14; 59.1; note that in the first two instances the masoretic text reads not כאןני but (1כ!^זבי (יהוה כבאות /ets rà wra (or, toIs ûal) kv s I may note here that the complete Isaiah Scroll (formerly St. Mark's, and now in Jerusalem, Israel.

ORLINSKY ρίουρίου σαβαωθ. In two verses, however, 37.17, 29, it would appear that anti-anthropomorphism was at work: in the former הטה יהוה אןנך וקטע ?.קח יהוה עיניך וךאה was rendered εισάκουσαν, κύριε, εΐσ-εΐσ βΧεφονβ κύριε; and in the latter verse ו?זאננך עלה באזני was turned into και ή πικρία σον άνεβη προς με. My student Marshall S. Hurwitz is now at work on a Master of Hebrew Letters thesis that deals inter inter alia with the Septuagint of Isa. 36-39 in relation to the Septua gint of the rest of the Book. In the parallel passages in II Kings 19.16, 29, אזן and ע;ן are reproduced literally in the Septuagint. 8. The "mouth" (פה) of God was translated literally (τό στόμα) twice in the expression י(14 ·58 ;1.20) ?י ?י יהוה דבר and once para phrastically (40.5, ότι κύριος εΧάΧησε — unless פי was overlooked accidentally after כי); again literally in 45.23; 48.3; 55.11, and para phrastically in 30.2 (1?, לא 0אלו/ερε δε ουκ έπη ρώτησαν, cf. RSV "without asking for my counsel," J PS "And have not asked at [!] My mouth"). In 34.16 בי פי הוא ציה was rendered ότι κύριος ένετεί ΧατοΧατο αύτοΐς, probably because the Septuagint Vorlage read כי פי 9.יהוה והוא) צןה 9.9. The "foot" of the Lord (ךנל) is reproduced faithfully (ό πούς) in 56.1. In 60.13 there was haplography of the entire clause ומקום רגלי אכבד either in the Hebrew Vorlage of the Septuagint or in the Septuagint proper. 10. The "voice" of God (קול) is rendered faithfully {ή φωνή) in all 6 instances: 6.8; 28.23; 3°-3°. 31! 32·9! 66.6. 11. The "lips" of the Lord (קפתןם) was translated literally (to χεΐΧος)χεΐΧος) in 30.27.10 12. The "arm" (רוע;) of God was reproduced literally (ό βραχίων) in 30.30; 40.10; 51.5 (bis), 9; 52.10; 53.1; 59.16; 62.8; 63.5, 12. In 8 R. Kittel's note in Biblia Hebraica5 reads: "g 2 R עיניך." One may well wonder how Kittel could distinguish עינך from עיניך via εϊσβλΐψον\ On the all-too-frequent worthlessness and misleading character of Kittel's so-called criticus apparatus, see most recently my "Studies in the St. Mark's Isaiah Scroll, IV" (Jewish Quarterly Review,Review, 43 [April, 1953], 329 ff.) and "VII" (Tarbiz, 24 [1954], 4-8), and "Notes on the Present State of the Textual Criticism of the Judean Biblical Cave Scrolls" (to appear in the W. A. Irwin Festschrift, 1956). י Annual, 25 (1954), 88-90. 10 The [לעי of God in the parallel clause is not reproduced, either because the Hebrew Vorlage was different or because the LXX text (presumably a form of ή ,γλώσσα,γλώσσα αντον) has itself undergone corruption: &lt;ךזנה שם־יהוה בא ממךךוק) ננער אפו וכבד משאה שפתיו מלאו זעם ולשונו כאש אכלת:/ καιόμενος ό θυμοί, μετά δόξης το λόγων τών χειλέων αΰτον, το λόγων οργής πλήρες, και ή οργή τοΐι θ ν μου ώς τνρ εδεται.</page><page sequence="5">[5] ANTHROPOMORPHISMS AND ANTHROPOPATHISMS 197 48.14 masoretic (דעו (בעדים η was read זרע in the Septuagint (του άρα άρα ι σπέρμα χαλδαίων). 13. The "inward parts; compassion" (מעים) of the Lord was trans lated correctly, if not etymologically, in 63.15, ((א:ה קנאתף ונבורתיף סעיף ורחסיף pnq/7ro0 έστι το πλήθος του έλέους σον καί οίκτιρμών σου. Compare the rendering in JPS and RSV, "the yearning of Thy heart." 14. The "face" (פנים) of God was reproduced literally (τό πρόσωπον) in 5 instances: 8.17; 19.1; 59.2; 64.1, 6. In v. 2 (and 63.19. See the edi tions of Rahlfs and Ziegler on the Greek text; the clause seems to have originated here by vertical dittography in the Hebrew text), unlike v. ι preceding and v. 6 following, מפניף was rendered ά7τό σου. This is either a free, even if correct rendering, or else may derive from a cor ruption of original ά7τό προσώπου σου. In 57.17 הסתר was spelled out anthropomorphically in the Septuagint: καί άπέστρεφα τό πρόσωπον μου.μου. 15. The "eye" (עץ) of the Lord was rendered faithfully (ο όφθαλ- όφθαλ μός)μός) in two passages (1.15, 16), and less literally, although not less correctly, in five other instances11: 43.4 ('^0/מאער י.קךת בעיני' ου 'έντιμος'έντιμος έ^ένου έναντίον μου. Note ή κεφαλή for נפש in this same verse, and ή χειρ for יד in v. 13); 49.5 (בעיני יהוה Ί23»)/καί δοξασθή σομαισομαι έναντίον κυρίου. Note ή χειρ for יד in v. 2); 59.15 (1!רע בעיניו/ καί καί ουκ ήρεσεν. Note τω βραχίονι αύτου for זרעו in v. 16); 65.12 (01»/נתעשו הדע בעיני έποιήσατε τό πονηρόν έναντίον έμου); 66.4 1*ע«יי בעיני) yyj/καί εποίησαν τό πονηρόν έναντίον μου. Note πούς/b)·} in verse I, and χειρ/χ in verse 2). In 37.17 ((הטה יהוה אזנף ושמע] פקח עינף וךאה...וךאה... mx/εΐσβλεφον, κύριε) and 38.13 (והטוב בעיניף עשיתי/ και καί τα αρεστά ένωπιόν σου έποίησα) there is the possibility of anti anthropomorphism having been at work; see above §7 on אזן. In 2.11 (עיני &lt;3בהות אךם ש?ל was rendered 01 yap οφθαλμοί κυρίου (υψηλοί, ό δέδέ άνθρωπος ταπεινός . . .). 16. The "heart'1 (לב) of God is found but once in Isaiah (63.14): (:ו)/&lt;כי יום נקם) בלבי (ושנת ?אולי באה)μέρα yap άντ αποδόσεως) έπήλθον αυτούς αυτούς (καί ένιαυτός λυτρώσεως ιΓάρεστι). That the anthropomorphic element played no role at all here is evident enough (1) from the picture as a whole, (2) from the literal renderings of המה ,אף, and ןרע in our very section (verses 3-6), and (3) from the fact that לב could readily have been rendered by some such term as διάνοια (a "" Cf. my comments on עיני? and לעני, in association with both God and man, in Crozer Quarterly, 21 (1944), 158.</page><page sequence="6">[6] 198 HARRY M. ORLINSKY common term for לב; see E. Hatch, Essays in Biblical Greek [Oxford, 1889], pp. 102-3, §1V), the term used for God's "thoughts, plans" in 55.9 (see §17 following). It seems to me that hτήΧθον αύτοΐς is merely a paraphrase of 12בלבי — incidentally, not a bad one in the context (parallel to 7'/באהrάpeστ1.), rather than the rendering of a Hebrew verbal form that is nearer to the original than preserved בלבי. 17. The "thoughts, plans" (מחשבה) of the Lord are treated in the LXX in the same manner as those of man. In 55.8 בי לא מדזשבותי מחשבותיכם was rendered ού yap eiaiv al βουΧαί μου ώστβρ ai βουΧαί υμών;υμών; and in verse 9 בן נבחו . . . מחשבתי מפחשבתיכם was translated ούτως άτίχβι . . . καΐ τα διανοήματα υμών ατό rfjs διανοίας μου. 18. The "anger" (אף) of God was reproduced literally (ό θυμός, ή οργή) in nearly every instance: 5.25 (bis); 9.11, 16, 20; 10.4, 5, 25; 12. 12.ι; 13.3, 9, 13; 14.6; 30.27, 30; 42.25; 48.9; 63.6; 65.5; 66.15; and cf. 12. ι בי np:v./upyiaeys μοι. 19. As with אף, so with its synonym תמה a literal translation (θυμός, όργή) was employed virtually throughout: 34.2; 42.25 (see my dis cussion of חמה אפו in Journal of Jewish Studies, 2 [ 1951], 151-4); 51.17, 20, 22; 63.3 (see below), 6; 66.15. In 27·4 ס?ה was rea&lt;^ ח?'ה in the LXX (τό τύχος); in 59.18 ονίΐδος was employed (cf. όνβιδισμός/ חרון in Jer. 12.13, an&lt;3 see Schleusner, s. vv.); in 63.3 ώς yijv for בחמתי is in all probability only a corruption of some form of opyr! (parallel to ,BH^/ev θυμώ), brought on perhaps by γην at the end of the verse, which, in turn, apparently derived (erroneously?) from the end of verse 6; in 63.6 the entire clause ואשבר□ בחמתי (parallel to ואבוס עפים 01»/באפי κατίτάτησα αυτούς τή opyfj μου) is lacking in the LXX, probably accidentally. 20. Still another term for "wrath," חרון, is combined twice with אף חרון אף)) and rendered literally by όργή (13.9) and θυμός (13.13). In translating the verbal form, the LXX expressed itself even more anthropomorphically than the Hebrew (v. 25): אף־יהוה πηπ/και 101' μώθημώθη οργή κύριος σαβαωθ. 21. Another synonym, זעם, was reproduced faithfully (οργή) in 10.5, 25; 30.27. On יהוה ובלי זעמו in 13.5 Gray (ICC on Isaiah) comments, 12 The same verb, k1τίρχομαι, was added neatly elsewhere in the LXX of Isaiah, e.g., in 13.13: 1"5)/(לעבךת יהוה לבאות) וליום סרון אפו θυμόν opyrjs κυρίου σαβαωθ) T7j ήμίρα f! αν ίτίλθτ] 6 θυμοί αΰτοΰ.</page><page sequence="7">[7] ANTHROPOMORPHISMS AND ANTHROPOPATHISMS 199 "The"The instruments of his indignation\ Jer 5ο23; cp. 'instruments of war' as applied to Saul and Jonathan, 2 S 127"; he might have noted in this very connection the appropriate rendering of our phrase in the LXX (cf. Schleusner, s. όπλομάχος, "Sensum expresserunt"), κύριος και oi όττλομάχοιόττλομάχοι αύτου (used also for צבא] מל^זמה] in verse 4 preceding). In 66.14 the LXX rendered the verbal form ((ונודעה :ד־יהוה את־עבז־יו וזעם (את־אויב'ו:) effectively (και ,γνωσθήσβται η χάρ κυρίου τοΐςτοΐς σββομένοιςσββομένοις αυτόν) και απείλησα (τοΐς έπειθουσιν). 22.22. Such other synonyms as 30.30) זעף) and 60.10 ;54.8 ;34.2) זקצף) were likewise reproduced literally (θυμός, opyrj). The same holds true for the verbal forms (λυπέω, οργίζομαι): 47-6; 54.9; 57-16, 17 (bis)(bis); 64.4, 8. 23. The עננו־ה ("wrath, fury") of God was translated literally (θυμός; or θυμός όρ^ης) in all 5 instances: 9.18; 10.6; 13.9, 13; 14.6. 24. The "rebuke" (נעךה) of the Lord was reproduced faithfully (η απειλή) in 50.2(thesame term used in 54.9). In 51.20 the same word (εκλύω) was used for גערה as for the synonym זעף in I Kings 20 (21)43: (:01)/(ה?!לאים חמת־יהוה) גערת (אלהוך πλήρεις θυμού κυρίου) έκλε λυμένοι λυμένοι (δια κυρίου του Θ60υ).13 In 17.13 &lt;וגער &lt;בי was reproduced by και άτοσκορακιβΐ (αυτόν), and in 66.15 ןעךתו was rendered άπο σκορακισμόςσκορακισμός (parallel to ע6/בחמה אפו θυμω έκδίκησιν). 25.25. Many translators have left open the direct antecedent of (הנה יוכריהוה בא) אכזרי in 13-9י whether it be "day" or "Lord"; the LXX did not hesitate to construe the Lord as the antecedent (ιδού γαρ ημέρα ημέρα κυρίου) ανίατος. 26.26. Attention might be drawn readily to a number of other instances where crassly anthropomorphic figures in the Hebrew were retained in the LXX; two cases in point will suffice here. In 6.5 כי את־המלך יהוה צבאות ךאו עיני was reproduced literally, και τον βασιλέα κύριον σαβαωθ 13 In view of the fact that απαλή is used both for געו"ה (as in our 50.2; Prov. 13.8; etc.) and זעף (e. g., Prov. 19.12), and since ΐκλύω is employed both for נערה (as in our 51.20) and יעף (I Kings 20.43; see Schleusner, s. «λύω, against proposed עף)), there is insufficient reason for assuming יגיעת for נערת in our 51.20 as the VorlageVorlage of «λύω, or an inner-LXX corruption in ΐκλίλυμΐνοι. In addition, ΐκλύω was not employed by the LXX translator of Isaiah for either יגע or יעף. In Isa. 44.13 Schleusner (s. «λίγομat), following Doederlein, would emend ΐκλίξάμαοί (for יעף) into ΐκλυόμίνοϊ (cf. Ziegler, note at 44.13); but ΐκλύω for יעף is foreign to the LXX of Isaiah.</page><page sequence="8">200 HARRY M. ORLINSKY [8] elbovelbov rots δφθαλμοΐς μου.

Our conclusions for the LXX translator of Isaiah (Chaps. 36-39 require separate study; see above §7) is precisely the same as for the LXX translators of the Pentateuch and of Job, namely, that whether he did or did not find anthropomorphisms and anthropopathisms offensive, he reproduced the Hebrew terms literally and correctly.</page></plain_text>
