<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CONSUMMATION OF SORROW: AN ANALYSIS OF CONFUCIUS' GRIEF FOR YAN HUI Amy Olberding Liberal Arts Division, College of DuPage, Glen Ellyn, Illinois As is often noted, a dominant metaphor deployed throughout the Analects is that of dao or "way." The model of philosophy evident in the Analects is oriented toward offering practical instruction for daily life, and its emphasis is on making one's way, negotiating a path. In this regard, Confucius functions as a cartographer, his counsel aimed at mapping a safe and efficacious passage through a variety of prosaic human experiences. Among these experiences, perhaps one of the most prominent is bereavement. To suffer the death of someone we love, Confucius suggests, is a uniquely perilous area in the landscape of human life. To navigate this area requires a robust and careful understanding of grief and its significance in a life well lived. In what follows, I wish to focus on the counsel Confucius offers regarding loss and the way in which Confucius valorizes grief as a constituent of a flourishing life. Confucius, like many philosophers, recognizes that reconciliation to death, broadly conceived, is necessary if one is to live without the disabling burdens of fear and anxiety. He acknowledges, that is, that the fact of human mortality cannot be denied and that an inability to accept this most basic reality imperils the quality of life we can achieve. However, acceptance of mortality does not, in Confucius' idiom, entail that we should accept, without sorrow, the deaths of those for whom we care. Indeed, Confucius suggests that the capacity to grieve, to be undone by loss, is, in some ways, a measure of our having lived well and richly. Confucius' in- struction on this point is evident in a number of passages in the Analects that broadly concern grief, but its finest expression is found in the series of passages that describe Confucius' own response to the death of his beloved student, Yan Hui.' These pas- sages offer valuable access to Confucius' counsel. In them, we see Confucius himself thrust into an encounter with personal pain and bereavement. The passages thus display a philosopher forced to confront loss and sorrow not as a matter of theoreti- cal concern but as an immediate reality. Before turning to the passages themselves, however, it is necessary to establish just why, aside from their poignancy, they merit significant analysis and attention. To consider Confucius' counsel regarding grief through an analysis of his own behavior when bereaved is perhaps to risk eliding the difference between a philos- opher's work and his biography. For philosophies are not generally judged by what the philosophers who offer them do (or fail to do). Yet Confucius' behavior at the death of Yan Hui is consistent with the philosophical goals that he describes. More- over, Confucius' ability to manifest his aspirations in the painful circumstance of Yan Hui's death must be treated as more than a fortunate intersection of philosophy and biography, for it has an import that surpasses the felicitous coincidence of theory and Philosophy East &amp; West Volume 54, Number 3 July 2004 279-301 279 ? 2004 by University of Hawai'i Press</page><page sequence="2">actual practice. This significance derives from a different and heightened emphasis given to models, or exempla, as well as to a particular emphasis placed on the model of Confucius himself. For the Confucius presented in the Analects, it is clear, cuts a figure worthy of appropriation. In his capacity as a model, he both evokes the experiential reality of human struggle and functions to exhort to action. As such, the model offered by Confucius' own behavior is a substantive element in the persuasive force of Confucius' counsel. To evaluate Confucius' counsel is, in many ways, to evaluate Confucius himself. This is not to claim, however, that to follow his counsel is merely to imitate his example. For while Confucius represents an instantiation of the aspirations he describes, neither he nor anyone can exhaust them. To make clear the centrality of Confucius' example and, more specifically, the centrality of his re- sponse to Yan Hui's death, it is necessary to examine in more detail the way in which the concept of a "way" or dao operates in the Analects. Charting a Path I have compared Confucius to a cartographer, but it is necessary to characterize more precisely the nature of his activity as such. For cartography can be pursued both as a descriptive activity aimed at an exhaustive account of a presumably fixed, or at least stable, geography, or it can, perhaps more modestly, aim at simply facilitating a route that is both safe and efficacious for the traveler. Confucius is a cartographer in this latter sense. His project is not to provide an atlas of the human experience, a precise charting guided by a prevailing conviction that the terrain can be ordered with a global vision that encompasses all possible routes and byways. It is, rather, a selective description of what Francois Jullien terms an "itinerary": "Instead of setting up a general theoretical point of view that might embrace diver- sity under the ordering gaze of reason," Jullien explains, "the Confucian proposition follows an itinerary logic; instead of leading up to a panorama, it marks out a cir- cuit."2 A "cartography" of human experience is, in this context, a prescriptive en- deavor grounded in a practical concern with both an aesthetics and an economy of movement. As such, it is always provisional and subject to modification. To characterize Confucius' counsel in terms of an itinerary rather than an atlas is not to assert that it operates wholly without a guiding vision. While its vision is not, and does not aspire to be, exhaustive, its very selectivity points toward a certain set of broader concerns. The articulation of an itinerary presupposes the existence of some destination. For if our aim is simply to wander, we need no direction. An itinerary likewise presupposes the ability to identify and locate landmarks that can orient the traveler and measure her progress. While the identification of orienting landmarks may change as the landscape itself alters, some set of markers is neces- sary if the traveler is to make her way. Finally, the itinerary presupposes that others have traveled this way before. The capacity to chart and follow a course is contin- gent on some prior knowledge of the landscape, some precedent for opting for one path rather than another. It is in these three features of the itinerary that Confucius' more global vision becomes apparent. 280 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="3">In the Confucian itinerary, the destination is, in its more modest formulation, personal cultivation and the achievement of a nobility and dignity in the individual character. At its most ambitious, however, the Confucian itinerary points toward the extension of this more modest aim into the whole of the community. These are not separate aims-the life of any one person and the life of the community are mutually shaping-but different aspects of a single destination. In characterizing these aims as a "destination," however, it is necessary to address what it would mean, in this context, to "arrive." In some ways, the notion of arriving at a destination seems inapt as a metaphor for Confucius' project. For it suggests, in a way that Confucius does not, that there is a fixed point at which the traveler stops and the journey ends. Yet however alien it may seem to describe Confucius as locating a fixed point of arrival, it seems at least equally inapt to describe him as sanctioning a persistent, or even aimless, wandering. It is not a free and open space to which Confucius offers access. For there is clearly, in Confucius' work, an operative if implicit standard of mea- surement: one can be near to, or far from, what is appropriate; one can move toward, or away from, a flourishing life. One can, in short, get lost. The destination that Confucius describes resists description as a point of arrival. It is, rather, akin to an unwalled city, an environ whose boundaries are not fixed but changeable. The nature of such a city permits a variety of approaches and there is no unambiguous boundary one may cross at which it is singularly correct to assert, "I am in the city." Yet there is a city that one can reach. Having reached it, the traveler does not abruptly stop but becomes a part of the patterns of interaction that consti- tute the life of the city. She dwells there, her activities part of the city's vibrancy, her presence something that inevitably introduces a new element that subtly modifies the city itself. The Confucian destination of personal cultivation and dignity of char- acter is, like a city, less a fixed order than an achieved resolve to abide within a certain temperament and aesthetic. Confucius' counsel thus indicates an ideal with dynamic and evolving borders. Having characterized the destination of Confucius' itinerary, it is necessary to return to its other features: its use of orienting landmarks and its reliance on earlier travelers as precedents. As they would be in any literal itinerary, these features of Confucius' philosophical itinerary are closely related. For the ability to distinguish relevant landmarks is a benefit conferred upon the traveler only through her ac- quaintance with the experiences of those who have passed this way before. Both of these features of Confucius' itinerary are evident in his use of models, or exempla. Confucius largely directs his audience through a strategic deployment of models, both historical and from his own personal acquaintance, who display some feature relevant to the listener's progress. The models may serve as positive inspiration, a marker on the horizon toward which the traveler should aim, or as a cautionary in- dicator, a warning of what hazards lie down a particular path. In either case, the relevance of many of these models will depend, to some extent, on the present location of the person whom Confucius would guide. In the Analects, Confucius is often seen adapting his responses to the "location" or temperament of his interlocutors. Because these responses are adaptive, they are Amy Olberding 281</page><page sequence="4">not formulaic but tailored to the circumstance in which they are given and richly suggestive.3 Like Confucius' immediate interlocutors, the contemporary reader of the Analects can only avail herself of his counsel through a careful attunement to the suggestive ambiguity of Confucius' particular responses to particular interlocutors, as well as through a determination to recognize her own position in the landscape. For the efficacy of some markers in the Confucian landscape derives from their aptness in a particular circumstance. As such, their use is somewhat circumscribed. In writ- ing an itinerary, I may, for instance, direct a visitor to recognize my home by the magnolia blooming in the yard. The efficacy of my instruction will clearly be deter- mined by the context in which it is offered. In the right season, and provided that my visitor knows her trees, this may be the most effective marker. A variety of conditions will inform the worth of my magnolia as a marker, and many of Confucius' models carry a similar circumstantial worth that is contingent upon the needs and context of their audience. Some models may be best suited to those of a certain character. If, for instance, one is possessed of a somewhat rash temperament, it is Confucius' descriptions of his impetuous but courageous student Zilu that will most assist. As a model, Zilu answers a particular need. In similar fashion, some models may most effectively serve to direct those within a certain historical epoch or cultural context. Confucius' models are often cultural heroes, and shifts in culture may engender a need for models that more readily resonate with the new context of a new audience.4 In short, many of the models Confucius deploys are particular to a circumstance, a personality, or a season. Responsiveness to circumstance and need serves here as both a practical technique and a more global sensibility regarding what is required of the traveler who wishes to make her way well in the world. While some models may be of most avail to those who share a particular trait or historical epoch, how- ever, others have a broader application. Part of what makes a marker useful is its distinctiveness. While what is distinc- tive will often depend on circumstance, there are some landmarks that, owing to their less transitory and less common character, function as substantially stable (not to say permanent) points of orientation. In Confucius' lexicon, these are models of individuals who serve a dual function as both markers and examples of those who have reached their destination. They are akin to a city's lights at night-visible from great distance and remarkable in their clarity and prominence on the horizon. Both Yan Hui and Confucius himself cut such a figure in the Analects. In the case of Yan Hui this is evident from the way in which Confucius describes Yan Hui's character as, above all, reliable. His constancy in pursuing self-cultivation serves to provide a model that, unlike the model of Zilu, for instance, can be counted on to provide re- liable instruction. The model that is of most relevance here, however, is Confucius himself. Compiled by Confucius' students, the text of the Analects is, in large measure, a vivid and descriptive account of the character of Confucius. In addition to recording the words of Confucius, it offers superficially incidental details about his comport- ment and behavior in a variety of circumstances. It describes Confucius' habits while 282 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="5">dining,5 his gait in the presence of mourners (e.g., An. 9.10, 10.25), and his physical posture in a variety of contexts (e.g., An. 10.19, 10.24, 10.26). The text thus func- tions as both philosophy and something of a biography of Confucius. Yet the bio- graphical, the display of Confucius' persona, is philosophical, for it does what Con- fucius' pronouncements alone cannot. Such details, Jullien claims, are "meant to be not understood but 'savored.' "6 For such details do not simply breathe life into the ideas that Confucius offers. Rather, they display the ideas incarnate and, in so doing, marginalize the importance of ideas qua ideas in favor of the enjoyment of an "atmosphere."7 The theme to which they insistently return the reader is that of wisdom as dynamic and evolving, an activity that resists sedimentation into abstract truth. The personae of individuals such as Yan Hui and particularly Confucius thus represent what David Hall and Roger Ames describe as an "actualization of a mode of being."8 The "mode of being" here displayed does not, and cannot, serve, once and for all, to map a course. The deployment of models serves, rather, as "acts of evocation."' They instruct by manifesting, pointing rather than articulating. In this manner, they do not command intellectual assent, but lie on the horizon inviting appropriation and emulation. The Analects offers a wealth of markers but the efficacy of these resides as much within the purview of the reader's attention to what they can tell her as it does within Confucius' own skill as a cartographer. The well-skilled traveler cannot pro- grammatically "heed" Confucius, but must, finally, use what he offers to develop her own internal sense of direction. Confucius gives, as he claims, but one corner of a picture; it is left to the one who would follow his counsel to creatively complete it (An. 7.8). To "creatively complete" a flourishing life is not, it should be emphasized, to create ex nihilo. The path we traverse leads somewhere and has been traveled before. We are not without stable points, each the creator of her own map. The Confucian problematic cannot be described as the attempt to invent a type of life that no one has ever lived before, and, in this sense, the language of an "ideal" is somewhat suspect. If we take seriously the metaphor of the city for our destination, then whatever the character of the city, qua city it must be peopled. It is an "ideal" not in the sense of an abstract conception that can never be made manifest, but in the sense of an aspiration that may be made manifest without being exhausted. We can, that is, enter the city, yet no individual resident can exhaust the richness of possible meaning conveyed by the descriptor, "in the city." In investigating Confucius' counsel regarding grief, what I propose to do is to examine the model Confucius himself offers when he is immediately struck by the loss of Yan Hui. While, in the case of many philosophers, a study that focused on the examples that the philosophers themselves provide would, for a host of reasons, offer a constricted and perhaps even ungenerous picture of their work, the nature of Confucius' work demands that we attend to Confucius himself. Doing so reinforces, as any examination of grief in situ would, the experiential reality of loss. More importantly, this manner of accessing Confucius' counsel best accords with his own method. To describe Confucius' reaction to Yan Hui's death is to describe something highly idiosyncratic and particular. Yet it is also to describe the character of a more Amy Olberding 283</page><page sequence="6">general sensibility or, in Jullien's idiom, an "atmosphere." The susceptibility of Confucius' counsel to a broader application-its capacity to answer to loss in our own experience-depends, in large measure, on its efficacy at enabling us to achieve a similar sensibility and atmosphere in our own lives. It will not map a fixed way or "direct our behavior from the outside," but instead seeks to facilitate the growth of an internalized sense of direction, an ability to orient ourselves in a land- scape and respond fruitfully to unique circumstances. 0 Understanding Life While Confucius' reaction to Yan Hui's death is embedded in the character of each man and the relationship between them, there are features of Yan Hui's death that permit a scope beyond this particular circumstance. There are, in short, attitudes toward death that Confucius brings to this encounter with loss that inform his reac- tion. While understanding Confucius' response to Yan Hui's death is not reducible to a summary of these attitudes, neither can his response be comprehended indepen- dently of them. Thus, a brief examination of these attitudes is necessary before turn- ing to the unique aspects of Yan Hui's death and Confucius' resultant grief. As P. J. Ivanhoe has argued, the death of Yan Hui shares three important features with the death of Bo Niu, another of Confucius' students.1 These features and Confucius' grief at both of these deaths in turn reveal something of his attitude toward loss more broadly conceived. Confucius is clearly troubled in both cases, yet there are circumstances here that demarcate and delimit grief. It is not loss qua loss that troubles Confucius, but specific sorts of loss in particular contexts. Thus Con- fucius' distress in each of these cases, as Ivanhoe argues, results not from a "lack of nerve" in Confucius as he immediately and concretely encounters loss, but from the presence of specific circumstances that lend these deaths in particular a tragic char- acter.12 Confucius does not conceive death, in a generic, abstract sense, to be tragic. It is, rather, a predictable and familiar aspect of natural and generational processes. While death itself is not tragic, however, particular deaths can be tragic insofar as they represent waste. The sorrow of Confucius at the deaths of Yan Hui and Bo Niu is, in part, attributable to the way in which these deaths are wasteful. As Ivanhoe argues, the waste of these deaths derives from the confluence of three principal features that they share. Both Yan Hui and Bo Niu are relatively young. They are also "good people, leading lives in accordance with the Dao."13 Finally, both men died of illness rather than from any calamity resulting from their philosophical and virtuous practices. They did not, in short, give their lives for some higher aim. While many philosophers insist that reconciliation to death requires an accep- tance of its capacity to come when unexpected and strike with an indifference to age, Confucius' reactions to the deaths of Yan Hui and Bo Niu imply a modified sense of this acceptance. While Confucius would accept the prudence of recogniz- ing death's capacity to take even the young, he does not equate reconciliation to death with a readiness to count the age of the dead a matter of indifference. The notion that a life can, no matter what its span, be "complete" is wholly alien to the 284 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="7">Confucian worldview, a worldview in which the development of one's character must, in some ways, be measured according to the opportunities that life affords. While one can, by dint of effort, achieve considerable success regardless of station and stage in life,14 there are certain kinds of human experience that are only afforded to those who have reached a certain age. Thus, although one may flourish whatever one's allotted span, longevity is to be prized not for its own sake but for the way in which it permits maturation of understanding and the expression of virtue across a full spectrum of possibilities that human life can offer. The best life, like the best marriages, is an achievement that cannot be detached from its persistence across a temporal span.15 For in both cases, time and experience are elements that permit an enrichment otherwise unavailable. No matter how rich and varied my life, how earnest and genuine my affection, I cannot, at thirty, love my husband now the way that I will at seventy. A commitment to pursue a life of cultivation and virtue is, in Confucius' view, like the commitment to marriage. It presupposes not stasis but enriching change, and while one's commitment to virtue may be accomplished in a moment, its fullest expression can only be afforded given time and opportunity. Because both Yan Hui and Bo Niu died young and as stu- dents, there were opportunities that they were unambiguously denied. The world would know them only as students and never as the teachers they might have become. They would never be husbands in long-lived marriages, grandfathers, or elders in their communities. The tragedy of their deaths and Confucius' grief re- garding their loss are thus in part attributable to the way in which the brevity of their lives represents possibilities unrealized. In valuing longevity, Confucius does not deny that our sense of the order of things, our inclination to expect and prefer that students outlive their teachers, is often unsupported by experience. What he denies is that the frequent frustration of our desires in this regard should lead us to neglect the value that a wealth of time well spent can add to life. To count all deaths as timely (or as equally untimely) is to deny the value of those aspects of human experience that derive their quality from their processional nature. A robust conception of virtues such as perseverance or fidelity, for example, requires that these be manifest across a span of time and evi- dent in a variety of life experiences. Such virtues are less achievements than pro- cesses, or ongoing activities, whose significance and meaning can only emerge given time. Confucius would thus concur with the judgment of philosophers who insist that there is not, in any strict sense, such a thing as a "death out of order." Death takes young and old alike and we cannot, if we are prudent, expect otherwise. Confucius would likewise agree that valuing longevity cannot but leave us vulnera- ble to having our desires frustrated. However, for Confucius this vulnerability is to be valorized rather than rejected. In hoping that we and our companions are long-lived, we champion a certain vulnerability in order to preserve the vibrancy and meaning of values that cannot be vouchsafed without it. The "early" deaths of Yan Hui and Bo Niu thus merit special sorrow because to treat them otherwise is to forego the productive value of time well spent. While Confucius' grief at the deaths of Yan Hui and Bo Niu is in part informed Amy Olberding 285</page><page sequence="8">by his regret for the opportunities that they are denied, this alone does not suffice as an explanation. For dying young may be, in some circumstances, a good or at least not tragic. It may serve as a regrettable good if a young life is sacrificed, or martyred, in the pursuit of laudable values. It may fall short of tragedy if the life lost early was of a nature that did not promise to use additional time well. Time itself is thus of little value and the denial of time to Yan Hui and Bo Niu strikes most painfully because it occurs to men who are both good and felled by illness. That Yan Hui and Bo Niu are good men gives a special sting to their early ends, for their characters and activities suggest that they would use time well and max- imize any opportunities afforded them. As Ivanhoe argues, "had they been bad people-young or old," it seems unlikely that Confucius would be "particularly distressed."'16 Confucius, on at least one occasion, evidenced little patience with those who fail to cultivate themselves and spend their lives heedless of their char- acter. Such people, Confucius suggests, do not mature but merely grow old and lack even the "grace to die" (An. 14.43). Persistence in life to no good end is not, clearly, the avoidance of tragedy. Being long-lived is only of value if those to whom time is granted make it so through their efforts. That Yan Hui and Bo Niu had characters that promised such effort makes their ends a sorrow and a waste of possibility. The notion of deaths that are tragic because they waste possibility is complete when the cause of death in these cases is considered. Yan Hui and Bo Niu are, in Ivanhoe's words, "cut down early in life for no apparent reason and in the service of no greater cause."17 They died of illness, a peril indifferent to the character and quality of the lives it strikes. To die in service to what is appropriate, to be "firm to the death" in one's values, is a hallmark of a good character (An. 8.13). In Con- fucius' era, the willingness to lose one's life in the practice of virtue was no vain pretense. A commitment to stand firm could and did put many at risk. Yet an early death in such a manner was at least partially redeemed by the confidence that the values for which one stood were in some way worth it. Had Yan Hui and Bo Niu died as a result of their virtuous practice, had their own conduct brought about their ends, the pain of loss would be coupled with, if not surpassed by, the compensation offered by honor. As it was, their deaths had no such compensation. They were not sacrifices willingly made for a higher purpose, but ethically purposeless and thus merely losses. The circumstances of Yan Hui's and Bo Niu's deaths and Confucius' resultant grief provide the grounds for some general conclusions regarding the attitude toward loss that Confucius would recommend. They shed light on Confucius' claim that one must understand life before understanding death is possible (An. 11.12). Confucius' understanding of life is at once prosaic and profound. In affirming the sorrow we endure at lives apparently cut short, Confucius implies that there is a certain justice in the rather commonplace tendency to view "untimely" deaths as a special sorrow. Yet this sensibility is elevated beyond the merely commonplace by the way in which Confucius embeds it in the affirmation of specific values. Grief here is not blind outrage at the caprice of fate taking the young before their time. It is not, that is, rooted in the perception that fate has dealt with us unfairly. Rather, grief painfully 286 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="9">consummates human values. Insofar as one recognizes one's place in the world as intimately bound up in one's relationships with others, insofar as the quality of one's life is described according to the defining character of these human intimacies, grief will emerge spontaneously as the fitting response to the loss of a relationship. Our desire to see those we love afforded a fullness of time and to be afforded a fullness of time in our relationships with them cannot but leave us vulnerable. However, to insulate ourselves against this vulnerability is to insulate ourselves from those aspects of life that most enrich. Grief is thus but a natural extension of the values that invest human life with significance and meaning. The Elusive Difference As the cases of Yan Hui and Bo Niu reveal, grief will be, in some ways, measured according to the circumstances surrounding any particular death. The death of any- one about whom I care will, as a result of the value I place on my relationships and their longevity, incur sorrow. The depth of grief will, however, be conditioned by what it is that is lost. Compensations, such as a heroic death or a death that comes "late," following a life that has ripened into old age, may salve the sting. Consid- erations such as these inform the account of death and sorrow that emerges in the Analects. They are not, however, sufficient as a description of Confucius' views of grief. For while such considerations well lend themselves to a somewhat abstract treatment of sorrow, they seem to fall short in a more immediate sense. An abstract account of the untimely deaths of Yan Hui and Bo Niu permits a certain insight into the significance of factual circumstances in shaping the reaction to loss, yet treating these two cases as a type of death risks a certain reduction. While it is in some sense accurate to depict Confucius as recommending a grief measured by circumstances, this can also be misleading. For, by reifying the way in which losses lend themselves to classification, it risks the suggestion that grief is formulaic. Losses may be classified according to their timing: Yan Hui and Bo Niu die young. Losses may likewise be classified according to relationships: Yan Hui and Bo Niu are Confucius' students. These similarities in the deaths of Yan Hui and Bo Niu permit us to see the grief manifested by Confucius in these cases as comparable owing to their common tragic character. Treating the deaths of Yan Hui and Bo Niu in such a fashion, however, neglects the way in which the circumstances that per- haps matter most are precisely those which resist classification and make any two deaths fundamentally incomparable. Confucius grieves the loss of Bo Niu and of Yan Hui, but the nature and apparent depth of Confucius' grief in these cases suggests an elusive and profound dissimilarity. Confucius' grief at Bo Niu's death is addressed in but one passage in the Ana- lects. In this passage Confucius attends to Bo Niu in his illness. Holding Bo Niu's hand, Confucius anticipates his student's end, saying, "We are losing him. Such are the conditions of life. That such a man should suffer such an illness! That such a man should suffer such an illness!" (An. 6.10). That Confucius is distressed is evident in the repetitive and seemingly wistful way he expresses his dismay at a man like Bo Amy Olberding 287</page><page sequence="10">Niu suffering a fatal and presumably painful illness. Yet Confucius also expresses a certain resignation. He does not rail against the conditions-conditions blind to Bo Niu's youth and potential-that have brought this tragedy to pass. Instead he frames the illness as a part of the way things are, a result of the operations of natural pro- cesses that lie outside the scope of human control and preferences. This passage represents all that can be known of Confucius' reaction to Bo Niu's death and, in- deed, largely represents all that can be known of Bo Niu himself from the text of the Analects. Bo Niu's death is never mentioned again and Bo Niu himself is only mentioned on one other occasion, when he is ranked, along with Yan Hui, as a student notable for his virtuous conduct (An. 11.3). While the circumstances of Yan Hui's death resemble those of Bo Niu's, the "atmosphere," to use Jullien's felicitous term, created by the passages concerning Yan Hui is markedly and dramatically different. In contrast to Bo Niu, both Yan Hui and Yan Hui's death figure prominently in the Analects. Confucius likens Yan Hui to a son and often recommends him as a model for emulation. When Yan Hui dies, Confucius' reaction displays a sorrow so intense that even his students-presumably Yan Hui's companions and friends-are taken aback. After Yan Hui's death, Con- fucius refers to him in a way that suggests a persistent and abiding melancholy that exceeds simple nostalgia. The differences evident in the Analects' portrayal of Con- fucius' reactions to the two deaths thus suggest that the appropriate response to loss resists summary in an account of rather abstract and general circumstances such as age, goodness, or manner of death. They suggest that, insofar as the reaction to loss is shaped according to circumstance, a more robust notion of "circumstance" than readily abstractable features is warranted. While general observations about timing and character provide a context for understanding, there is much here that they cannot explain. The nature of Confucius' grief for Yan Hui seems rooted in some- thing both more immediate and more elusive than an appeal to factual circum- stances can capture. It is not a class of death that Confucius rues but the death of one man in particular. The Stupid Man Because Confucius' dramatic reaction to Yan Hui's death is situated in the relation that the two men enjoyed, the first step in entering into the atmosphere of Confucius' grief is to investigate Yan Hui himself. Who is Yan Hui? Given the relative wealth of passages in the Analects that concern or describe Yan Hui, this question is surpris- ingly difficult to answer. For Yan Hui, an individual whose death seemingly had the power to elicit Confucius' greatest display of grief, often appears in the Analects to be, frankly, remarkably unremarkable. Yan Hui, it is quite clear, is a good man. Yet relative to the dynamic, challenging, and even entertaining figures cut by many of Confucius' other students, his very goodness apparently conspires to make him col- orless, his personality tightly circumscribed by the moral lessons to which his activ- ities and attitudes give rise. Indeed, goodness here seems to exercise a sort of tyranny over personality, obliterating any features or peculiarities of character that might 288 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="11">compete for notice. Were it the case that the other students who people the Analects were equally featureless, this might simply be attributed to the literary style of the text. However, this is not the case. While the personalities and idiosyncratic char- acters of other students appear prominently, Yan Hui, it seems, is unique not only in being a rare species of good, but also in being somewhat insipid. One possible route to take in interpreting the rather dull picture of Yan Hui given in the Analects is to treat him less as a character in the narrative than as a recurring trope. To treat him thus is to forego seeing him as a student among Confucius' other students in favor of placing him in the company of figures such as Yao and Shun, the sage kings of antiquity to whom Confucius occasionally refers. The sage kings, about whom very little was known with certainty, figure in the Analects as historically distant models whose goodness derives more from their legendary status than from any specific or detailed accounts of their activities and attitudes. Yao and Shun, in short, are tropes of goodness and virtuous rule. When Confucius appeals to them, he apparently wishes to recall his audience to a Golden Age, an era that, whatever its actual character, was revered in Confucius' time in no small measure because of a belief in the nobility and probity of its rulers. By invoking the names of Yao and Shun, Confucius would be evoking in his audience both nostalgia and possibility: what had been might become so again. In this context, any idiosyncratic features of Yao and Shun would profit little, for such would be irrelevant to the purpose served by invoking their names. In similar fashion, Yan Hui may serve as a more contemporary and immediate trope for goodness. Because of his early death, Yan Hui, like Yao and Shun, lies in a past that may be summoned nostalgically but may not be accessed directly. His life is finished, his voice stilled, and only the force of memory can make him present. Unlike Yao and Shun, Yan Hui is of humble origin, and deploying his example evokes a modified sense of possibility. He represents earnest effort in straitened cir- cumstances. His success may thus stand as a more modest and personal version of what Yao and Shun signify: what he had achieved, others might also. Even within the upheaval of the Spring and Autumn era, the example of Yan Hui attests that a nobility of character can be realized. If this is the message of Yan Hui, and surely it is at least in part, then the idiosyncratic is not of great import. The dullness of Yan Hui relative to the portrayals of Confucius' other students is, in this interpretation, a result of his serving a substantially different function. There is, however, a formidable rea- son to suspect that such a reading is inadequate or, at best, incomplete. For such an account seems fundamentally ill-equipped to explain the apparent enormity of Confucius' grief. In recalling Yan Hui to mind, Confucius does not summon a distant cultural memory but that of one of his own flesh-and-blood companions. The species of abstraction required to transform an individual into a trope, to make a life a moral lesson, requires a remove that fits ill with Confucius' obviously deep attachment to Yan Hui the man. To account for Yan Hui's dullness by treating him as a trope thus seems perilously reductive. It leaves little room for any robust understanding of Confucius' grief and neglects the significance of the biographical features of the Amy Olberding 289</page><page sequence="12">Analects. Unlike Yao and Shun, Yan Hui seems memorable not for what he repre- sented to Confucius or his students, but for who he actually was and who he was to them. However featureless his image, he seems more than a trope. There is a more parsimonious and plausible way to read the portrayal of Yan Hui and that is to conclude, quite simply, that Yan Hui was dull. Such an interpretation has much to recommend it. To read the characterizations of Yan Hui in the Analects as descriptions that, in some measure, mirror the man is to conclude that Yan Hui was often notable for what he, in contrast to Confucius' others students, lacked. He had none of Zilu's impetuosity, displaying instead a remarkable constancy (An. 6.7). Unlike Zigong, who was given to measuring and ranking others (An. 14.29), Yan Hui focuses on his own progress and shortcomings (although, notably, none of these shortcomings are specifically identified) (An. 14.29). He is resolute and energetically pursues learning, showing none of the laziness of Zaiwo, a student who often merited Confucius' censure and whom Confucius once described as both "rotted wood" and "dried excrement" (An. 5.10). These are but a few examples of the many contrasts that the Analects implicitly draws between Yan Hui and his peers. These contrasts mark Yan Hui as a kind of exception to the human foibles to which Confucius' students are prey. The picture of the relationship between Confucius and his students that emerges in the Analects is one that manifests features recognizable to anyone who has spent much time teaching. It is a relationship that affords moments of great affection and reward, and yet these are equally matched by moments of frustration, challenge, and conflict. Yan Hui is an exception in this regard as well. For, by Confucius' own ac- count, Yan Hui never disagrees with him: "Hui is of no help to me, for he does not disagree with anything I say" (An. 11.4). If he frustrates Confucius-it seems that he may if Confucius' claim that Yan Hui is of "no help" is any indication-it is a com- parably mild sort of frustration. Insofar as the descriptions of Yan Hui in the Analects are comparable in function to the descriptions of other students, that is, insofar as they at least partially serve a biographical function, the view that Yan Hui's is a countenance without much color is borne out. Confucius makes a few remarks regarding Yan Hui that both confirm a certain dullness in Yan Hui's personality and begin to reconcile that dullness with the exalted position in Confucius' affections that Yan Hui holds. Perhaps the most telling passage is one in which Confucius describes his own curiosity regarding Yan Hui's mild mien: The Master said: "I can talk to Hui all day and, as though he were stupid, he will not disagree with me. Yet when he withdraws from my presence and I witness his private actions, [I see that] he manifests what I have been saying. Hui is clearly not stupid." (An. 2.9) This passage is extraordinary on a number of counts. It shows a rarely seen side of Confucius. Here he is bemused, the skill with which he typically "reads" the char- acter of others having apparently failed him. He has clearly entertained doubts about 290 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="13">Yan Hui's abilities, yet whatever these doubts, they are matched by a suspicion that something has eluded him. Thus Confucius observes Yan Hui in secret in order to see what an unguarded Yan Hui is like. That Confucius is drawn to watch his stu- dent, acting with what one must imagine as a degree of stealth, likewise indicates another side of Yan Hui's own character: he is, in some way, mysterious, even to his teacher. That his teacher sees fit to report his secret observations furthermore sug- gests that the suspicion that Yan Hui is stupid is not limited to Confucius alone. Were it only Confucius who found Yan Hui puzzling, one would not expect Confucius to feel a need to report his findings to others. This passage thus reveals a seemingly contradictory conclusion regarding Yan Hui's character and personality: he is both what he seems and more than what he seems. He is an insipid figure, and yet in his very lack of flavor resides a skillfulness that is at once consistent with Confucius' counsel and mysterious. To resolve some of this mystery, it is necessary to return to the attribute of Yan Hui's character, his goodness, that the Analects most clearly defines. The Empty Man Yan Hui is dull and he is also good. That he is both, however, is more than a sim- ple coincidence. In a brief study on the "Chinese Notion of 'Blandness,'" Franyois Jullien argues that blandness-whether it be manifest in art, food, or individual hu- man beings-is a "virtue."18 Using Jullien's insights regarding the rich potential of the bland, it is possible not only to reconcile Yan Hui's dull character with his goodness but to show how his comparable plainness makes his goodness possible and, by extension, to show just why he so endears himself to Confucius. As Confucius' covert observations of Yan Hui demonstrate, the bland has about it an air of mystery. It appears to conceal as much as it reveals. Since he is unlike Confucius' other students, who are readily known by their words and responses to events, knowing Yan Hui requires a resort to other measures for he displays no marked features. This absence of display is itself, however, what uniquely marks Yan Hui. He is, in Zengzi's words, one who is "full yet appears to be empty" (An. 8.5). Being bland in character is, in some measure, to withhold oneself and be modestly sparing in personality. It represents, claims Jullien, a rare species of psychological equanimity: As a harmonious relationship between diverse qualities or capabilities, blandness ex- presses an optimal and discrete equilibrium in which no one quality manifests itself in such a way as to exclude another-and so where all qualities may coexist simultaneously and manifest themselves appropriately according to the diversity of the circumstances.19 To be bland is thus not to lack personality but assiduously to hold oneself in balance. It is to be insipid not for want of a defining character but as a means to assert a character that invites determination. The virtue of the bland rests in its capacity to lie open, to be both adaptive and opportunistic. Seen in this manner, the contrast between Yan Hui's dullness and the Amy Olberding 291</page><page sequence="14">colorful foibles of Confucius' other students assumes a significance beyond a con- trast in personalities. The reactions and behaviors of Confucius' other students are, in many ways, predictable. Owing to the color of their characters, their ability to suc- ceed in a variety of endeavors can be anticipated with some confidence. Zilu's courage makes him well suited for military matters, yet this same strength-a will- ingness to forego concern for personal safety-can clearly function as a disability in circumstances where it is caution that is warranted. Zilu's character is thus both colorful and overdetermined. There are circumstances to which he will not easily adapt, opportunities he cannot maximize. A dull character, in contrast, permits un- predictability because it lies in wait, open to determination and susceptible to a greater degree of variation. Zilu's character is such that he imposes its flavor upon his undertakings, effectively delimiting, in advance, the possibilities any circum- stance might offer. Yan Hui, because he is bland, offers an underdetermined mien in which no single aspect "monopolizes one's attention or insistently imposes itself."20 He is a traveler who can skillfully make his way because he will not charge ahead, heedless of all but his will to movement. He will, rather, "read" the landscape and measure his step according to what the terrain demands. Because of his dull aspect, Yan Hui's is a character at once obvious and myste- rious, and there is a sense in which he must ever remain unknown. What he might have been lies on an unreachable horizon of possibilities only dimly glimpsed. That the loss of Yan Hui strikes Confucius with such force is bound up with both the ob- vious and the mysterious. He sees Yan Hui's skill and, in that sense, knows and appreciates the character of the companion he has lost. Yet the nature of Yan Hui's skill is such that it is too easy simply to attribute Confucius' grief to the loss of a known and beloved student. Yan Hui is not, or not simply, a young man whose character promised great achievements. His death represents, for Confucius, possi- bilities unrealized, but these are no ordinary possibilities. For what makes Yan Hui unique and his death uniquely painful is not that he is known but that he is un- known. What he offers is unfamiliar and unpredictable, even to sage Confucius. Unlike that of his other students, Yan Hui's character promises to show Confucius something he has never seen before. Thus Confucius rues not what he knew Yan Hui would become but that he could not know what Yan Hui would become, and Yan Hui's untimely death ensured that he would never know. If Not for Him Confucius' grief for Yan Hui is most explicitly detailed in two passages that, like the passage concerning Confucius' bemusement at Yan Hui's apparent stupidity, reveal a seldom seen aspect of Confucius' character. The first passage simply records what appears to be Confucius' immediate response to Yan Hui's passing: "Upon the death of Yan Hui, Confucius cried, 'Alas! Tian has destroyed me! Tian has destroyed me!'"21 Confucius' exclamation here both indicates a palpable distress and reveals a sentiment that stands in marked contrast to that displayed in his reaction to Bo Niu's death. Gone is the resigned acceptance of natural processes. In its place is 292 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="15">a claim that bespeaks injury, complaint, and perhaps even anger. That Confucius is "destroyed" and that he attributes his destruction to tian seems such a departure from, if not a betrayal of, so much of his philosophy that it is difficult even to begin to assay the implications of this claim. Tian, that which Confucius describes elsewhere as the source of his virtue and consequently his protection from harm (An. 7.23), is here the apparent source of bereavement and ruin. It is personified not as a benevolent moral order but as the enemy of Confucius' well-being. Furthermore, Confucius himself, whose moral progress is regularly offered as a model, displays none of the resolve and resilience that characterizes wisdom. Instead, he is, by his own account, a wrecked man. Confucius' claim is so extraordinary that perhaps the most sensible interpretation of it is to abandon any hope of discovering an explicit philosophical content and conclude that here Confucius has, simply and rather unambiguously, lost his wits. Such appears to be the conclusion drawn by Confucius' other students. In the sec- ond passage that most explicitly details Confucius' grief, the author or authors tell us simply that, upon Yan Hui's death, "in weeping for him, the Master wailed without restraint" (An. 11.10). Confucius, it is implied, had lost control. When his students bring this to his attention, they implicitly ask that Confucius explain himself, saying, "You are wailing without restraint." In response, Confucius simply replies, "Am I? But if not for him, for whom would I wail without restraint?" Once again, Confucius appears in an unfamiliar light. His behavior is clearly dramatically unusual. It strikes his students as worrisome and sufficiently so that they see fit to query Confucius about it even, apparently, while he still weeps. That they do so implies both an urgent concern and perhaps even a mild reproach. Confucius' demeanor appears to his students as unwarranted by the circumstances and puzzling given Confucius' usually reliable self-command. Confucius' response to his students does not reassure, but instead apparently confirms the suspicion that he has lost control. For Confucius appears, at some level, to share his students' bemusement. "Am I?" he asks, seemingly disoriented and un- aware of his own comportment. Yet Confucius seems to protest his students' implied question as well. He does not deny the veracity of their perception that he has abandoned himself to sorrow yet defends his loss of control as warranted. The rup- ture in his habitual self-control, Confucius claims, is merited by the magnitude of the rupture opened by Yan Hui's death. To understand Confucius' grief and his broader counsel for loss, it is necessary to analyze both the nature of these ruptures and Confucius' somewhat oblique justification of his sorrow. Superficially, Confucius' extreme reaction does seem unwarranted. Insofar as the death of Bo Niu represents a comparable circumstance, it is apparent that Confucius could and does bear loss without abandoning his composure. However, as I have argued, both the number and nature of the passages concerning Yan Hui in the Analects imply that this is a special case. When Confucius "justifies" his grief by recalling Yan Hui to mind, it is clear that Confucius grants Yan Hui something of a special status in his affections. To some degree, this special status can be attributed to the skill and virtuosity Yan Hui demonstrated. What remains to be assessed is just Amy Olberding 293</page><page sequence="16">what is it about the loss of a student with such abilities that strikes Confucius so forcefully. Who Yan Hui was is clear. What is less clear is who he was to Confucius. The Confucius Who Never Was Much has been written regarding the "relational" construction of self in Chinese philosophical literature, and it is beyond the scope of this essay to revisit this subject exhaustively here. However, the sensibility displayed in Confucius' grief cannot be detached from his larger sensibility regarding what our relations with others signify and the import they have for our ability to flourish. Death, perhaps more than any other phenomenon, seems clearly to demarcate self from other. For the fact that those I love can be stripped from me by a shift in circumstance necessitates a dis- tinction between them and those elements of my well-being-my character, in par- ticular-that seem to lie outside the grasp of changeable circumstance. Confucius is not indifferent to the value of making such distinctions, for an awareness of the fra- gility of our relations with others clearly informs his work.22 Yet while Confucius accepts this fragility as a given, he would not, in consequence, relegate relations to others to the status of an external, something that can properly lie outside the artic- ulation of my character. Instead, relations to others, including their fragility, are in- corporated into a robust conception of self in which to flourish as a human being is to flourish among and with others. The nature of a self so defined can perhaps be captured in an abstract discussion of the roles we play among others and the way that these roles offer unique opportunities for the articulation of personal identity. There are a number of studies available that pursue such a discussion. However, here I simply wish to address the way in which this sensibility is manifest concretely, in particular the way in which it is manifest in Confucius' relation with Yan Hui. For relations are always relations with someone, and Confucius' grief is best understood in situ, in the specificity and particularity of his unique relationship with Yan Hui. To say that my identity is constructed in the patterns and interactions of my relations with others is to acknowledge that who I am and can be is always em- bedded in a set of circumstances that are changeable. The death of Yan Hui serves as a dramatic and final rupture in the relation between Yan Hui and Confucius. Confucius claims to be destroyed by it, and, in a very real sense, he is correct. For insofar as his relationship with Yan Hui defines and circumscribes the character of Confucius, there is a certain "Confucius" who can no longer be. It is in this sense, I maintain, that Confucius' expressions of grief are indicative of one who has lost his wits. Confucius' behavior following Yan Hui's death makes no sense, coming as it does from a man remarkable in his ability to navigate his way, resiliently and reso- lutely, in the chaotic landscape of his time. To claim that Confucius' expressions of grief make no sense is not, however, to say that there is no sense to be made here. For in their lack of sense, there resides a significance that is independent of their explicit content. Confucius' wailing and protestations in part function to force the recognition that immediate grief is, in many ways, unspeakable. The "language" of grief mirrors its 294 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="17">source. Rooted in loss and privation, grief's most fitting expression is aphasia. Just as the habitual and familiar patterns of relation are ruptured by death, so, too, do the habitual and familiar patterns of speech abandon the bereaved. One's tongue is caught and the language in which one lives cannot match the raw facticity of death. Confucius weeps and, pressed to explain, he seems to suggest that this is all he can do given the circumstance. His absence of self-awareness, evident in his asking, "Am I?" bespeaks confusion. His response to his students' tacit query bespeaks a defiant refusal of explanation. "What is there to explain? In what language would I explain it? Yan Hui is dead," he seems to say. Confucius' reaction to this loss appears to be, as I have argued elsewhere, "unpremeditated" and "largely ungoverned by any ordinary awareness of the purposiveness and meaning attached to actions."23 It is a reaction unmediated by a cognitive process by which it could be justified or adequately explained. Its language is as significant for what it cannot say as for what it does. Confucius does not speak in his usual manner because he cannot. Much of Confucius' activity as a teacher is familiar. He attempts to lead his stu- dents, to exercise an influence over their intellectual and moral development. His manner of doing this is likewise familiar: he instructs, he questions, he challenges preconceptions. His students react with questions of their own. They disagree at times and challenge Confucius to explain himself and his claims. They frequently resist his influence. Together Confucius and his students thus manifest many of the common traits of teacher-student relations: receptivity and resistance, understanding and struggle, acceptance and challenge, successes and failures. The evident effect of this process on Confucius is to provide him an arena of exploration and discovery. His abilities are engaged and enriched by this play of communication and challenge. While Confucius and Yan Hui are ostensibly "teacher" and "student," their re- lation and the process of instruction in which they engage is markedly different. As Yan Hui is unique, so, too, is Confucius' relation to Yan Hui. Confucius claims that "Yan Hui is of no help" (An. 11.4), yet this claim, like the worry that Yan Hui is stupid, is one that falls short of conviction. The way in which Yan Hui helps is, however, like his character, difficult to penetrate. Yan Hui is, Confucius claims, the only student who "listens with persistent attention" (An. 9.20), and he is the only one whom Confucius will describe as "eager for learning" (An. 6.3). While these are features that would presumably please any teacher, there is a sense in which they only add to the mystery of Yan Hui's character. For Yan Hui's manner of engaging his teacher is apparently to adopt a posture of placid receptivity. He does not dis- agree, and thus he does not explicitly challenge. Yet in his agreeable attention resides an implicit challenge. As a student, Yan Hui is, according to Jullien, a "paradox."24 He is of no help and appears to be stupid because he denies Confucius "the incitement that a less talented disciple, such as Zigong (An. 3.8) offers by his repeated questions."25 Yan Hui listens and heeds. Indeed, he requires but the "barest indication" of Confucius' meaning in order to appropriate and exploit what he is offered.26 Confucius observes this and recognizes its power. When Zigong is loathe to compare himself to Yan Hui because Yan Hui "is able to hear one thing and understand ten," Confucius matter- Amy Olberding 295</page><page sequence="18">of-factly sympathizes (An. 5.9). "You are not as good as he," Confucius says; "neither you nor I are as good as he." The challenge that Yan Hui poses is, like his character, an admixture of the obvious and the subtle. He will not disagree with and he will not engage Confucius in agonistic dialogue. Instead, he will absorb and he will instantiate, his open and passive demeanor an implicit challenge to Confucius not to defend or clarify his teachings but to teach more yet. The Confucius who teaches Yan Hui cannot be the same Confucius who teaches Zigong and the other students. With Yan Hui, Confucius is called to be both more and less than he is with his other students. He must be more, for Yan Hui's skill places the relation beyond ready predictability. What Yan Hui does or will do with Confucius' instruction admits a mystery not evident in Confucius' relationships with his other pupils. Thus it is the teacher as well as the student who is faced with the unfamiliar and novel, who is called to respond fruitfully to the circumstances offered by a new terrain. However, Confucius is also less in this relationship. He and Yan Hui enjoy the repose of an easy communication in which an excess of words is un- necessary. Yan Hui's skill as a student and Confucius' skill as a teacher conspire to produce a mutual understanding "so complete," claims Jullien, "that it suppresses the dialogue."27 The vocabulary of instruction so vital to Confucius' activity with others can here give way to an appreciative and pregnant silence in which "teacher" and "student" dissolve into Confucius and Yan Hui, each enjoying the vista that their companionship and collaboration opens up. Confucius is, thus, in this relationship something he cannot otherwise be. The Confucius displayed here is at his most efficacious as a teacher. He may instruct with a confidence that he is understood. He may speak sparingly and trust that his words are sufficient. Above all, he can enjoy his own bemusement in the mystery of Yan Hui and the way in which Yan Hui's character imbues Confucius himself with mys- tery. What might a teacher with such a student become? What might their collabo- ration produce in the world? Confucius is confident of the path he traverses and he is confident in Yan Hui's skill, but these are questions he cannot answer. For he does not and cannot know. They lie on a horizon of possibility that can only be accessed by Confucius and Yan Hui together. With Yan Hui's death, this horizon, dimly glimpsed, recedes from view, and the Confucius who could travel there is destroyed. When Confucius grieves, he appears to his students to have abandoned his usual self-command, but that Confucius is "not himself" is unsurprising. Yan Hui's death opens a rupture in Confucius' identity. He cannot, in this circumstance, be who he was. His response is uncharacteristic because it cannot be otherwise. He is as a man on a landscape suddenly bereft of a marker by which he defines his course. He is disoriented, unsure of his position, lost. That he should weep without restraint simply indicates that he appreciates the significance of what he has lost. Baring One's Neck It may seem reasonable, at this juncture, to ask just what Confucius offers in terms of counsel for loss. To frame Confucius' work and the model he offers as counsel 296 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="19">implies that there is some help to be had here for our own losses. Yet there is a sense in which Confucius' treatment of grief closely resembles what might be counted a naive or untutored response to loss. Confucius does not, for instance, challenge basic assumptions about loss. Indeed, in many ways, Confucius' work seems to state, rather than contest, the obvious: caring about others entails desiring their well-being and continued existence; loss is painful and calls for tears. Confucius' own behavior largely appears to be simply reaction. It does not, that is, appear to be the product of a cognitive or philosophical process through which Confucius has concluded that grief is justified and appropriate. He has not decided to grieve; he simply grieves. However, Confucius' grief is neither simple nor simply reaction. As is the case with his treatment of our desire for longevity for our loved ones, Confucius provides a counsel that both endorses and elevates the obvious. For while a decision to grieve is not a direct antecedent to Confucius' behavior following Yan Hui's death, Con- fucius has chosen to grieve. When Confucius answers his students' query about his grief for Yan Hui by asking "If not for him, for whom would I wail without restraint?" he makes a claim that is richly suggestive. For, by asking "If not for him, for whom?" Confucius, per- haps inadvertently, indicates that there should be someone whose death would elicit such a response. That this claim, made in the midst of Confucius' grief, might have such import is reinforced by the way in which Confucius repeatedly mentions grief as the most important and ethically valuable response upon the death of a loved one. When he discusses mourning practices, in particular, he insists that grief is of more import than the performance of the particular ritual activities to which such deaths give rise.28 That Confucius highlights grief in such a fashion suggests that he views it not as a wholly involuntary response to loss but as something that we can, to some extent, both command and sanction by virtue of the way we lead our lives and conduct ourselves in our relationships. Genuine grief cannot be commanded at the moment of loss, but our capacity for such grief will be informed by our past activities and the way in which we have framed our relations with others. The species of grief that Confucius advocates and displays stems from a complex of values that notably differ from the conditions that give rise to an untutored or blind grief. Surely one of the more common causes of grief is a sense that we have failed to realize what we have with loved ones and a perception that we have taken for granted their presence in our lives. We belatedly realize the import of others yet we cease to take their presence for granted only when it is taken from us and our loved ones are absent. In short, we rue in the death of the other what we have failed to do and to feel in life. Grief here results from a wrenching awakening to values only dimly or incompletely apprehended while those we love still lived. The grief that Confucius offers is, in contrast, not an awakening but a consummation of values. One is seized with sorrow not because one has failed to realize the worth of the other but because one has realized it. This realization entails vulnerability, but it does not thereby preclude one's capacity to exercise a certain control. It is not, it should be emphasized, the abandonment of one's well-being to the vicissitudes of a necessarily fragile and changeable world. Amy Olberding 297</page><page sequence="20">What most distinguishes the vulnerability that Confucius describes from a naive vulnerability is that here vulnerability is the product of consent. As such, it reflects a modified species of control regarding the well-being that can be achieved in the fragile and changeable circumstances of human life. As the relation between Con- fucius and Yan Hui attests, there are aspects of personal identity and character that are only afforded us through our activities and interactions with others. When we self-consciously commit to a course of life that is open to definition within and through our relations with others, our character and the character of our lives be- come a matter of discovery rather than assertion. Yet the capacity to be so open, to entertain this indeterminacy, does require control. It requires that we sanction for ourselves a life that can, through a shift in circumstances, come undone. It is to assert that a desire to be insulated from harm shall not overcome my attachments to others and that I will withstand the threat of loss. Loss cannot but be fearful, but to thereby abandon my attachments to others is to deliberately impoverish what my life is or can be. The grief that results from loss in this context cannot be counted a failure of will or of understanding. To care for another in the way that Confucius suggests and to admit that another has a formative function in the construction of my identity entails a tacit rejection of the notion that every individual will and must die alone. It is to pledge myself and my well-being to another by saying, in essence, "You will take me out when you go." Yet Confucius' counsel is not an endorsement of unques- tioning or untutored sorrow, for it also requires that we combat an ordinary species of vulnerability. It requires a valorized vulnerability in which I stand ready to con- summate the value of my relations to others by being open to injury. To stand thus is to know the potential cost of my affections and deem them worth it. It is self- consciously to bare my neck to the stinging blade of loss while knowing well that if it strikes I shall bleed. Confucius' grief at the death of Yan Hui is an eloquent descrip- tion of such a laceration. Notes 1 - The text that is often considered our most reliable source for Confucius' thought, the Analects, will be my focus in what follows. Although perhaps more dependable than other sources using the voice of Confucius, the Analects itself is not, however, without problems. A collection of what are ostensibly Confucius' statements, his conversations with his students, and, in part, simply a record of his activities and comportment, it contains many passages that scholars identify as problematic and that are suspected to be later interpola- tions. There is, at present, little consensus about these textual issues. Although I will be sensitive to these concerns, I propose to treat the Analects as a narrative and discuss the Confucius who emerges as the protagonist of this narrative. I will thus be less concerned with assessing the historical authenticity of the received text of the Analects and the image of Confucius it offers than with 298 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="21">discerning whether a consistent and coherent therapy for the sorrow of be- reavement may be discovered there. 2 - Francois Jullien, Detour and Access: Strategies of Meaning in China and Greece, trans. Sophie Hawkes (New York: Zone Books, 2000), pp. 211-212. 3 - Because many of Confucius' claims are given as responses to particular inter- locutors, understanding them requires that they be treated as assertions in- formed by the context in which they are given. To the degree that the text of the Analects permits, knowing the characters of Confucius' interlocutors is necessary for a hermeneutically responsible reading, for Confucius' replies are often measured. The message is not fixed but weighted against what the capa- bilities and character of the interlocutor will permit. Thus, Confucius does not, for instance, settle upon singular definitions of terms but instead offers a variety of meanings, none of them exhaustive but each responding to a particular need and circumstance. It is for this reason that Confucius' claims are best described as "suggestive." Any apparent inconsistency between claims is resolved if they are treated not as attempts to hit a fixed target or establish a truth once and for all, but as deliberate and methodical efforts to indicate a direction for further inquiry. As such, they deploy a strategic ambiguity of sorts, inviting the reader to entertain a complex variety of meanings. 4 - As Confucius' practice of citing models from his own immediate acquaintance suggests, there is no permanent pantheon of unchanging models. To accept Confucius' counsel is thus not to accept wholesale only those models that he offers, for such an acceptance would neglect the way in which Confucius' counsel resists reduction to a formula. To tread the path he describes would, rather, entail that I, like Confucius, look for models among those in my own immediate context and cultural framework. A vital "Confucianism" would be one that does not stop with the models of the Analects. 5 - See, for example, Analects 10.8, 10.10, and 10.11.

There she distinguishes marriage as the sort of project that death does indeed inter- rupt. This is so because marriage "is not a single isolated act, but a pattern of daily acting and interacting, extended over time, in which the temporal exten- sion, including the formation of patterns and habits, is a major source of its value and depth." It is just this sort of "formation of patterns" within relation- ships and enjoyment of an array of roles in life that informs the value Confucius would ascribe to longevity. While longevity, like marriage, does not guarantee that a person will avail herself of the opportunities it offers, without it there are potential sources of value that are unambiguously denied her.

Often, as is Con- fucius' claim here, the term is deployed in a manner that is anthropomorphic, suggesting that a part of what operates in cosmic order is not only natural physical processes but also the humanistically oriented order operative in the relations between ancestors and their living descendants. Tian thus incor- porates both physical processes typically considered indifferent to human values and the appropriate moral order of human society. For a more detailed explication, see Roger T. Ames and Henry Rosemont, Jr., The Analects of Confucius: A Philosophical Translation (New York: Ballantine Books, 1998), pp. 46-48. 22 - See, for example, Analects 4.21, in which Confucius claims that the joy in having one's parents survive into old age is matched by a trepidation con- cerning the approach of their deaths. 300 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="23">23 - Amy Olberding, "Mourning, Memory, and Identity: A Comparative Study of the Constitution of the Self in Grief," International Philosophical Quarterly 37 (1997): 30. 24 - Jullien, Detour and Access, p. 202. 25 - Ibid. 26 - Ibid. 27 - Ibid. 28 - See, for example, Analects 3.4, 3.26, and 19.1.
