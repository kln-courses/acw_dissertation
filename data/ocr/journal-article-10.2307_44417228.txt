<plain_text><page sequence="1">February, 1970 THE CEA CRITIC Page Thirteen My Sister Mary Is a Neophyte or# Look to Your Laurels, Mrs. Malaprop To those of us who live constantly with the Death Wish in that bizarre, dim half- world called English 101 or Fresh- man Composition, the Vocabulary Game is still an effective memento mori , the gray speck, the Ash Wednesday daub on the forehead reminding us of our vulner- ability as champions of the Word in the Age of McLuhan. One batters away at the resistance to precision, at the hostility to objective standards of criticism nur- tured through four years of "creative" high school English classes, sweats out somebody's eclectic anthology of essays or short stories, examines one's own methods for symptoms of faltering "rele- vance," weeds out the tosh and twaddle and resounding clich√©s of a succession of "themes," offers hints for Effective Writ- ing, laboriously expounds the classics, such as Orwell's "Politics and the English Language." In short, one tries to Cope. Somewhere in their early college or even pre-college experience (judging from the number of themes that begin "Web- ster defines 'love' as . . .") students have acquired access to a serviceable dictionary. In repose, which is to say, seen from the infallible side of the lectern, their faces reflect amusement, comprehension, even curiosity. Some may challenge one's more flaccid generalizations or dispute a point here and there in the reading. So when the time comes to see how much is in- telligible to them in context, one is under- standably hopeful that some borders of meaning have been defined. But the ear, evidently, works well ahead of the dictionary mind. A while back, after calling attention to some of the more exotic terms in our reading, and suggesting that a Funk &amp; Wagnalls for- mula was not enough for the diligent scholar, who must apply a word accur- ately, perhaps even gracefully, I asked my freshmen to use each of the following words in a sentence: 1. introspective 2. mercenary 3. effete 4. neophyte 5. analogy 6. unctuous 7. Junkers 8. anthropomorphic A few sample results, not necessarily the most striking, but food for thought among aspiring pedagogues: 1. They were always effete after hiking. 2. Anyone may use the analogy, which is up in the library. 3. My sister Mary is a neophyte. 4. Neophyte can be found in the ground. It is one of the 92 natural elements of the world. 5. The analogy we use in class is full of interesting essays written by well- known authors. 6. The mercenary traveled from mission to mission. 7. The judge had no choice but to be mercenary. 8. Over the years John had become a neophyte. 9. The effete was quite tall and beauti- fully composed. 10. He was a neophyte at writting [sic]. 1 1 . The girl next store [sic] was often called a neophyte by the gang in school. 12. Mr. Gray was loved by all, he was congenial, and one of the biggest neophytes in his neighborhood. 13. We should more introspective our- selves at that point. 14. Something very effete had to be done to improve the style and plot of the essay. 15. The Junkers, once they receive their supply, wait patiently for the addicts. 16. If you see strange looking people standing around a ship, looking sus- picious, they are probably Junkers. 17. The neophyte set fire to all the barns along the way. 18. The Junkers came to the town dump yesterday, but could find nothing. 19. George and his wife went on a mer- cenary trip to help George's sick mother. 20. Some of my best friends are anthro- pomorphic. Brooding over such, one is tempted to give the students credit for unsuspected resources of whimsy. At least they apply themselves to the search for plausibility, euphony and coherence, after a fashion, and some of the exotic usages hold up rather well, empirically. When I intro- spective myself, for instance, I find that I am effete after a three- or four- mile hike, though not necessarily tall or beau- tifully composed, and it is true that many, if not most, of my best friends are anthro- pomorphic. To those of us who remember the films of the 1940's, moreover, Nos. 16 and 18 evoke vivid glimpses of Holly- Humanities PERSPECTIVES IN AESTHETICS Peyton E.

The instructor may well conclude, too, as the themes drift in, that some freshmen are more apt than he assumed to rely oil auditory osmosis in keeping the stale phrases out of their writing. A niourner is described as "prostate with grief." The village post office is alive with activity because "not only the natives but the summer people conjugate there." A brief immersion in modern literature may re- turn a mind-bending judgment that "Al- bert Camus was an exist-sensualist." One is grateful, after a couple of deep breaths, for the images thus provided, and once again made aware that in teaching Freshman English (or any other foreign language) the trick is to enunciate slowly and distinctly.
