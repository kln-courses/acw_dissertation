<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRAGMATISM AND THE METHODOLOGY OF METAPHYSICS One of the seemingly dominant traits of pragmatic thought is its "antimetaphysical" attitude. And, indeed, the general methodology of pragmatism may seem by its very nature to exclude the possi bility of speculative philosophy, for any pragmatic metaphysics must be at once faithful to the limits of meaningfulness and knowledge imposed by a pragmatic epistemology and in harmony with the scientific spirit of pragmatic philosophy in general. The following essay will examine a pragmatic methodology for metaphysics as it emerges when the philosophies of C. S. Peirce and C. I. Lewis are used for mutual clarification. It is not here held that all pragmatists would accept the methodology which will emerge from such a mutual clarification; neither is it held that no pragmatists other than Peirce or Lewis would accept it. Moreover, it is not held that either Peirce or Lewis consciously embraced it in its entirety. This, however, is not to say that the present procedure is arbitrary, for it is justifiable by the intelligibility of the methodology of metaphysics which emerges and the usefulness of this methodology in clarifying the systematic consistency of epistemology and metaphysics in a prag matically oriented philosophy. Indeed, according to the basic doc trines of pragmatism, no other justification can be offered for this or any interpretive schema. In the following analysis, in which the positions of Lewis and Peirce will be taken as indicative of the "pragmatic predicament,, in general, three questions must be kept in mind. First, how can a pragmatist meaningfully discuss metaphysical issues? Secondly, how can he be said to know anything in the area of metaphysics? And, thirdly, how do the answers to the problem of meaning and the problem of knowledge in a pragmatic metaphysics relate to the generally scientific spirit of pragmatic philosophy? It is with these issues that the present paper will deal. Peirce poses the "problem of metaphysics" in the following way: "We must begin by asking whether the categories can be admitted as simple and irreducible conceptions; and afterward to go on to</page><page sequence="2">PRAGMATISM AND METAPHYSICAL METHOD 253 ask whether they cannot all be supposed to be real constituents in the universe." 1 His conclusion seems evident from his statement that the "premisses of nature . . . though they are not the perceptual facts that are premisses to us, nevertheless must resemble them in being premisses. We can only imagine what they are by comparing them with premisses for us." 2 It would seem, then, that Peirce recognizes the necessarily imaginative or metaphorical nature of any metaphysical discussion. Here, however, the question immediately arises, is the assertion that metaphysics is metaphorical compatible with Peirce's own often repeated characterization of his metaphysics as scientific? To answer this question, it will be necessary to see precisely what Peirce means to assert when he states that his meta physics is scientific. An answer to this question will help clarify not only the relation between metaphysics and science but also the mean ing of Peirce's statement that metaphysics can be only imaginative or metaphorical. Peirce holds that the attitude of meaphysics "toward the universe is nearly that of the special sciences from which it is mainly dis tinguished, by confining itself to such parts of physics and psychics as can be established without special means of observation. But these are very peculiar parts, extremely unlike the rest."3 In what way are these parts upon which metaphysics rests peculiar? According to Buchler, "What these 'peculiar parts' are we never find expatiated in Peirce." 4 Though it is true that Peirce never explicitly clarifies this point, he perhaps gives the clue to their peculiarity in his state ment that metaphysics "rests upon a kind of phenomena with which every man's experience is so saturated that he usually pays no par ticular attention to them." 5 Thus, the data for metaphysics differs from that of science precisely because the former is so pervasive of our every experience that its presence is often not recognized. 1.

ROSENTHAL We see then that metaphysics, like science, rests upon observa tion. Does this mean that metaphysical assertions are open to direct verification in experience? As Peirce points out, even "the things that any science discovers are beyond the reach of direct observa tion. ... It is only the premisses of science, not its conclusions, which are directly observed." 6 If "the things that any science dis covers" are beyond the reach of direct observation, what is their experimental role? As Bosco has noted, it is enough for the experi mental character of a science that its conceptions and theories are necessary for a more satisfactory explanation of certain phenomena which are directly observed.7 Thus, we see that the conclusions of neither metaphysics nor science are directly observed in experience. What, precisely, is the nature of the conceptions and theories of science according to Peirce? As he remarks in answer to objections to his position, "I hear you say: 'This smacks too much of an an thropomorphic conception.' I reply that every scientific explanation of a natural phenomenon is a hypothesis that there is something in nature to which the human reason is analogous." 8 Thus, science is anthropomorphic. Does this mean that Peirce holds the matter of science to be "in itself" of the nature of mind? As Peirce states in speaking of anthropomorphism: I heartily embrace most of the clauses of that doctrine if some right of private interpretation be allowed me. I hold, for instance, that man is so completely hemmed in by the bounds of his possible practical experience, his mind is so restricted by being the instru ment of his needs, that he cannot, in the least, mean anything that transcends those limits. . . . For let him try ever so hard to think anything about what is beyond that limit, it simply cannot be done.9 Thus, that which transcends experience in either science or meta 6. Ibid. Here it should be noted that when Peirce speaks of premisses and conclusions, he is indicating the direction of abduction, not deduction, or in other terms, the order of discovery, not the order of logical analysis. Thus, the premisses are the observed data, while the conclusions are the abductive hypotheses formed from the data. 7.

In both science and metaphysics, we proceed to hypotheses via analogy from the experienced to the un experienced. Both science and metaphysics rest on observation, both proceed from the observed to the unobserved, and both conceive of the unobserved in terms of the observed. Peirce prefers to say that science and metaphysics are anthropomorphic, but what he means is not that the "matter" of either science or metaphysics is of the nature of our experience but that we can understand it or even conceive of it only as analogous to our experience. Thus, we see that Peirce's metaphysical discussions are couched in speculative and anthro pomorphic language not in spite of the limits of meaningfulness imposed by his pragmatic epistemology but because of them. His metaphysical discussions are highly metaphorical because he recog nizes them to be metaphor. Because the data from which metaphysics sets out are the charac teristics which pervade all experience, scientific and nonscientific alike, its postulates must be at a level more comprehensive and hence more abstract and less verifiable than the postulates of scientific theory, but the difference is not essentially one of kind. Does the difficulty of either formulating or verifying a metaphysical theory mean that metaphysical speculation will eventually halt? Peirce an swers that "you might as well pass a law that no man shall jump over the moon, it wouldn't forbid him to jump just as high as he possibly could."10 Does this mean that Peirce, in his more "prag matic moments" must hold that metaphysical speculation is merely a useless but unavoidable pastime? To this, Peirce replies with a question of his own: "Do you think, reader, that it is a positive fact that Truth, crushed to earth, shall rise again/ or do you think that this, being poetry, is only a pretty fiction?"11 In short, as Peirce sums up the problem of metaphysics, "The best that can be done is to supply an hypothesis, not devoid of all likelihood, in the general line of growth of scientific ideas, and capable of being verified or refuted by future observers," 12 at least in some sense. Concerning his own positive metaphysics, Peirce states that he is "convinced that it 10. Ibid., 5.356. 11. Ibid., 1.217. 12. Ibid., 1.7.</page><page sequence="5">256 SANDRA B. ROSENTHAL would go far toward supplying the philosophy that is best to har monize with physical science."13 Victor Lowe, in contrasting the metaphysical perspectives of Peirce and Whitehead, notes that "Peirce's position seems to be a kind of scientism," while, for Whitehead, "Metaphysics is nothing but the description of the generalities which apply to all the details of practice."14 According to the present view of Peirce's method of metaphysics, however, this latter characterization could well be at tributed to him. Indeed, it is precisely Peirce's point that "everything of which we are conscious, as enjoyed, perceived, willed, or thought, shall have the character of a particular instance of the general scheme."15 Perhaps it is just the awareness of this latter role of metaphysics, coupled with the epistemologically founded belief that metaphysical statements can have only metaphorical meaning, which led Peirce to use such blatantly anthropomorphic language. Murray Murphey has noted that Peirce's formulation of his ideas often "converts a perfectly reasonable doctrine into something which seems utterly outrageous." 16 Indeed, if, on the one hand, Peirce's claim to be scientific in his metaphysics is taken too narrowly, or, on the other hand, his metaphorical assertions are taken too literally, then his doctrines will seem outrageous and often contradictory. In short, it is well to heed the warning that a good pragmatic meta physics must be "scientific" but not "scientistic," not a superscience but a philosophical reflection which is attentive to and in conformity with the methods and results which the scientists attain.17 The above discussion has shown that a pragmatist can make meaningful assertions concerning metaphysical issues while remain ing faithful to the demands of both the pragmatic criterion of mean ingfulness and the spirit of scientific philosophy. The problem then arises, how can a pragmatist be said to know anything concerning metaphysical issues. In short, by what criteria are certain meaningful 13. Ibid., 1.6. 14.

Before this question can be answered, however, it must first be determined what the metaphorical meanings discussed above are intended to be "about." Or, in Peirce's terminology, what is one talking about when one talks of "truths of being?"18 This problem can best be met by a some what negative approach. What Peirce's pragmatism will not allow should by now be evi dent. As he states, pragmatism serves to warn us "that almost every proposition of ontological metaphysics is either meaningless gib berish-one word being defined by other words, and they by still others, without any real conception ever being reached-or else is downright absurd."19 Thus, if metaphysical discussion is to be of value it must be not about empty words but about meaningful con cepts. Does Peirce hold "being" to be a meaningful concept? He notes that certain very metaphysical and eminently intellectual notions are absolutely simple. But though these concepts cannot be defined by genus and difference, there is another way in which they can be de fined. All determination is by negation ; we can first recognize any character only by putting an object which possesses it into com parison with an object which possesses it not. A conception, there fore, which was quite universal in every respect would be unrecog nizable and impossible.20 And, "being" is precisely such an "unrecognizable and impos sible concept," for as Peirce states, "Being . . . may be defined, for example, as that which is common to the objects included in any class, and to the objects not included in the same class. But this is nothing new to say that metaphysical conceptions are primarily and at bottom thoughts about words."21 Or, as Peirce more succinctly sums up his views on "being" : "The conception of being, therefore, plainly has no content." 22 Thus, we see that being, for Peirce is an "empty concept" or, in more exact terms, "being" is not a concept at all, but merely a term to which we can give no meaning, for as 18.

ROSENTHAL indicated above, a concept to which no empirical content can be given is, in fact, no concept at all. ^Metaphysics, then, is not about "being qua being" but rather about categories of being which is quite another matter, as will become evident below. At this point, however, the term 'category,' as it enters into a pragmatic philosophy, is ambiguous. To clarify this term it will be helpful to turn to Lewis's statements on this subject, for the incom plete formulations of Lewis and Peirce can be used for mutual clari fication. Lewis notes that "as it turns out, the problem of metaphysics is 'the problem of the categories'." 23 However, in the context of Lewis's technical terminology, 'categories' indicate the most funda mental principles of ordering by the mind. They exhibit our inter pretive attitudes, not that which is interpreted. Thus, eliciting our fundamental categories would seem to clarify the fundamental pur posive attitudes in terms of which we approach the independent element; it would not seem to provide any information about the in dependent element in its character as independent. Lewis does state that the categories are "the principles which formulate criteria of the real."24 However, it is evident that he means by reality here that experiential content which has been sub sumed under its proper category. Thus, he says, "the problem of distinguishing real from unreal, the principles of which metaphysics seeks to formulate, is always a problem of right understanding, of referring the given experience to its proper category." 25 And again, "metaphysics is concerned to reveal just that set of major classifica tions of phenomena, and just those precise criteria of valid under standing, by which the whole array of given experience can be set in order and each item (ideally) assigned its intelligible and un ambiguous place."26 Finally, he notes that the categories "impose no limitation upon the given, but, as principles of interpretation, nevertheless condition it as a constituent of reality."27 The reality thus "produced" is not independent reality in its character as inde pendent of our interpretive categories but rather is a reality which 23.

Ibid., p. 14.</page><page sequence="8">PRAGMATISM AND METAPHYSICAL METHOD 259 can best be termed "epistemological reality," since it "emerges" from the epistemological process of conceptually structuring that which is given for interpretation. In this sense, metaphysics is systematic epis temology. However, if the epistemological process is such that knowledge arises by the application of concepts to an independent element, then certain conditions must hold of this independent element. In short, the universe must be one which allows for the knowledge situation as a pragmatic epistemology interprets it. Lewis himself recognizes this second sense of metaphysics when he states that the problem of realism, idealism, or phenomenalism is at one and the same time epistemological and metaphysical, because it concerns the subject object relation, instead of any relation, both ends of which neces sarily lie in cognitive experience itself.28 Here it is clear that Lewis sees metaphysics as related to the independent element or "object" element, not to the epistemological categorization of experience to produce epistemological reality. Similarly, he states that "there are, in my opinion, metaphysical presuppositions which are essential to epistemology, for example, the nature of knowledge itself presup poses a reality to be known which transcends the content of any experience in which it may be known." 29 Metaphysics in this latter sense, as the analysis of the categories which must hold of independent reality if the knowledge process is to be possible, is not a categorial set of the same level as any categorial set which is applied to the given data to produce epis temological reality. The categories, as truly metaphysical, stand above any context of epistemological reality and make intelligible the epis temological situation in which alternative categories can be applied to given data to give rise to epistemological reality. The use of the term 'category' in reference to the conditions for the application of categories or concepts or perceptual judgments to a given content in the epistemological process, though confusing if not properly understood, points out something of importance. We cannot get outside our epistemological predicament to examine in dependent reality. The concept of independent reality and the classi 28. C. I. Lewis, "Realism or Phenomenalism?"

ROSENTHAL fication of its aspects can itself be only a categorization made within experience to make experience more intelligible. From the epistemo logical point of view reality-any kind of reality-results from the application of concepts or categories to given data at some level. But, to understand the possibility of this being so, independent reality must be characterized by certain metaphysical categories. Indeed, Peirce's eliciting of the phenomenological categories and his subsequent application of them to metaphysical reality indicates a partial awareness of precisely this fact. That Peirce would have recognized the validity of Lewis's analysis of the cognitive situation seems clear, for in Peirce's terminology, a perceptual content is in terpreted in the abductive perceptual judgment and a perception of objective reality or objective fact results. In this sense of the real, Peirce holds the real to be the outcome of opinion.30 However, Peirce, focusing on the fact that such an analysis of the knowledge situation itself results from a categorial analysis of given experience, recognizes that three categorial distinctions are applied in making such an analysis-the distinctions elicited by the categories of First ness, Thirdness, and Secondness; or, in other terms, the experiential situation is analyzed to contain an element of qualitative immediacy, an element of conceptual interpretation, and an interaction of the two.31 Such categories, which Peirce holds to account for the analytic aspects of all experience, are then taken by him to hold in an analo gous fashion of that independent element which enters into all experience and makes experience as we have it possible. However, in the last analysis, Peirce, like Lewis, confounds levels of interpretation. This confusion is evinced in his statement that 30. CP, 5.407. 31. Though Peirce's description of his phenomenology as a science of what seems, precisely as it seems, may be thought to be inconsistent with the present interpretation, Dewey has noted that Peirce's analysis of the phaneron is in fact logical, not psychological. Similarly, Goudge points out that "in reality Peirce's phaneroscopy is a double-edged sword, possessing at once both its rational and empirical edge." This interplay of rational and empirical factors will be clarified below in the discussion of the pragmatic a priori. Furthermore, Peirce elsewhere clearly indicates that even "seeming" statements involve interpretation. Therefore, the "science of what seems, precisely as it seems," does not exclude the use of interpretive categories (John Dewey, "Peirce's Theory of Quality," Journal of Philosophy, 32 [1935], 702; Thomas Goudge, The Thought of C. S. Peirce [Canada: Uni versity of Toronto Press, 1950], p. 77; Peirce, CP, 7.656, 5.157).</page><page sequence="10">PRAGMATISM AND METAPHYSICAL METHOD 261 "Metaphysics is the science of Reality. Reality consists in regularity. Real regularity is active law . . . Thirdness.,, 32 Thus, "metaphysics, as I have just remarked, treats of phenomena in their Thirdness." 33 Peirce then goes to deliberate pains to elaborate a metaphysics which gives equal play to Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness.34 The above clarification shows that Peirce's argument commits the fallacy of equivocation. Epistemological reality is an affair of Third ness, for it is only through the application of concepts in the in terpretive perceptual judgments that there is an objective reality as known; and concepts and judgments do indeed belong to the category of Thirdness. However, to understand the possibility of this being so, independent reality must be characterized by Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness. Here a problem may be held to arise. It was stated above that the metaphysical categories of Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness provide the conditions for the possibility of the knowledge process as interpreted in a pragmatic philosophy. Yet, these categorizations of independent reality themselves arise within the knowledge pro cess. And, if the knowledge process is characterized as one in which alternative sets of categories can be applied to the given data, then it would seem that there must be alternatives to the categories of Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness as indicative of independent reality. This, however, is precisely what Peirce and Lewis would hold. Peirce nowhere indicates that his categories are absolute or eternal and in fact states quite clearly that though his selection seems the most adequate, alternative series of categories are possible.35 Similarly, though Lewis speaks of metaphysics as providing the pre suppositions for epistemology, he notes that though a presupposition is logically prior, the idea of necessity must be given up.36 Nor is such a presupposition known by some "higher" type of knowledge, for as Lewis explains: Where the body of facts which such a presupposition implies is considerable and well established, and there are no implications of 32.

ROSENTHAL it which are known to be false, the presupposition gains that kind of verification which particulars can give to general principles that is, the partial and inductive verification of it as an original hypothesis.37 At this point, one may object that pragmatism has become in volved in an arbitrary circle with no firm roots anywhere. It is true that though a pragmatic metaphysics attempts to understand the in dependent element which enters, along with a conceptual element, into our sense of empirical reality, what this independent element is like can be determined only from experience; and it is also true that how we understand experience will in part be influenced by the ontological categories in terms of which we approach it. A prag matic metaphysics can be only tentative and responsive to experience while at the same time legislating for the analysis of experience. This type of procedure, however, is not peculiar to metaphysical analysis but rather is continuous with the method of the "pragmatic a priori,, which pervades all levels of knowledge, from the most primitive commonsense knowledge to the most sophisticated meta physical knowledge, for our interpretive concepts and categories at all levels have arisen out of past experience and have been made prescriptive for the interpretation of future experience. This type of mutual feedback is surely not arbitrary; indeed it harmonizes quite well with the conception of scientific method as indicating a self corrective rather than a "building block" enterprise. Such a self corrective method is not viciously circular, nor is it circular at all, but rather it is a cumulative process based on the pragmatic inter play at every level between concepts or categories and experience. Furthermore, as Lewis has noted, when dealing with the highly ab stract level of scientific theory (and mutatis mutandis the level of metaphysical theory)38 it "is no longer easily possible to say whether concepts are devised, and laws discovered, to fit phenomenal facts, or whether the conceptual system itself rules and facts are recon ceived in conformity to it." 39 We have seen that it is precisely such a tightly knit link, and hence one difficult to detect, between concept 37.

If a dichotomy is made in this way, then the problems attributed to Peirce's method do in fact arise, for if the method is empirical, then we cannot know that the categories have universal application, while if the method reduces to an a priori assertion, they have universal application "by fiat" but seem somewhat arbitrary in their applica tion to experience.41 The above clarification shows that Peirce's method makes use of what Lewis later explicitly developed as the pragmatic a priori. The categories of Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness are drawn from the phenomenological analysis of experi ence, but they are held universally applicable because we make them analytic tools for the understanding and interpretation of the ex periential data of metaphysics. Like any set of categories at any level, they are justified by the intelligibility they introduce into their given data. Thus, metaphysical knowledge, like commonsense and scientific knowledge, arises from the application of concepts or categories in a way which introduces intelligibility and order into the array of given data. The above examination has attempted to determine a pragmatic methodology of metaphysics as it emerges from the philosophies of Peirce and Lewis, and hence a context within which their positive metaphysical doctrines can be interpreted. This essay cannot con sistently hold that the methodology which has emerged from the mutual clarification of the positions of Peirce and Lewis is The methodology of a pragmatic metaphysics or even The truth about the methodology of Peirce and Lewis. The data which forms the basis for the present interpretive schema can no doubt be inter preted in other ways by other conceptual schemes which are brought to it. The justification for the present interpretive schema lies in 40. See above, p. 260. 41.
