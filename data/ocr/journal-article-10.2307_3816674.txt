HUNTINGTON LIBRARY AND ART GALLERY Paradises, Heavenly and Earthly* By HARRY LEVIN Y SUBJECT iS one for which I find myself altogether unqualified, lVI and, so far as I can gather, there does not seem to be much pros- pect that I shall ever come to know it at first hand. In fact it does not come, by definition, within the divinely specified limits of human observation. "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him' wrote the Apostle Paul to the Corinthians, echoing the prophecy of Isaiah. Yet where there is not a shred of evidence, there can be an endless amount of speculation. There is a Shrovetide farce by Hans Sachs in which a wandering scholar tells a farmer's widow that he has recently been sojourning in Paris. The simple woman has never heard of the French metropolis; but she has heard a good deal about paradise, where she likes to think that her late husband abides; and she somehow confuses those two places, with a credulity which works out to the scholar's dishonest advantage. I could hold forth with more confidence about Paris, which has not the reputation of being such an ineffable locale or of having such Rhadamanthine en- trance requirements. It is narrated that when Moses himself asked an angel about the nature of paradise, he was sternly warned that it was immeasurable, unfathomable, and innumerable. However, this in- *An address delivered on Founder's Day, February 28, I966, at the Henry E. Hun- tington Library and Art Gallery, San Marino, Calif. 305</page><page sequence="2">306 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY junction has not stayed the age-old effort to take its measure, fathom its range, and enumerate its attractions. The flaming sword that guards the interdicted entrance continues to fascinate, as well as to put off, curiosity-seekers. The apocryphal Sir John Mandeville, whose fancies greatly outdistanced his famous travels, confessed: "Of paradys ne can I not speken propurly for I was not there; it is fer beyonde and that forthinketh me [I regret it]. And also I was not worthi. But as I have herd seye of wyse men beyonde, I schall telle you with gode will' And Mandeville went on, as so many others had done before and still others would do since, depending on hearsay, to describe the indescribable. Such descriptions, when we sort them out, testify with monotonous eloquence to the poverty of the human imagination, reminding us of the poor cockney dwarf in a novel by Dickens, who had been to the country once in his child- hood and cherished a vague remembrance of a lot of grass and some swans. The radiance, the fragrance, the balmy climate, the spontane- ous bounty, the twittering birds, all those lawns and terraces and fountains, those pavilions of so little else ecept crystal and jasper, that continual music in the background, the frulit so available and uni- formly delicious that Eve grew fatally bored with it, the colorful verdure and kimdly animals varying only with the flora and fauna known to the describer-there can hardly be another theme, among the universals of folklore, that has been sounded for so long and so widely with such a modicum of variation. "If a man could pass through Paradise in a dream;' mused the dreamy Coleridge in Anima poetae, "and have a flower presented to him as a pledge that his soul had really been there, and if he found that flower in his hand when he awoke-Ay! and what then?" What then indeed? Perhaps our most appropriate answer to this rhetorical question, characteristically a self-interrupion, would be to suggest that insofar as the floral memento was real, it would have been a poem. Mystics have presumably passed through paradise in their dreams, but their transport has not lent itself too palpably to verbal description, whereas the poets-fusing their pnvate fantasies with racial memories-could bring that vision into the upper reaches of our experience. Therefore comparative literature rushes in where com- parative religion fears to tread. The enraptured Elizabethans could sing, with Michael Drayton:</page><page sequence="3">PARADISES 307 The poets paradice this is, To which but few can come; The muses onely bower of blisse Their deare Elizium. Yet, as these verses blithely hint, the initiation is rare. The poet who returns from it to tell his tale may envision himself, like Coleridge, as having drunk the milk of paradise. But since that particular rapture was actually stimulated by opium, it was what Baudelaire would call un paradis artificiel, an expansion of consciousness promised today by those who experiment with psychedelic drugs. Moreover, Cole- ridge found himself unable to recapture his paradisiac dream of "Kubla Khan" His sunny pleasure-dome, his underground river, his incense-bearing trees, his caves of ice, though they will always tan- talize our minds, are fragmentary glimpses of a realm that we shall never be enabled to visit. All the more honor, then, to that greatest of poetic visionaries whose septicentennial we have witnessed during this past year, whose bust has been lately encircled with many garlands of scholarly aspho- del! For, questionless, no dream vision has ever been so graphically rendered as Dante's; no single work of fiction has encompassed so vast a conception; no other dreamer, awakening from an immersion in the guiltiest anxieties and the most ecstatic hopes of mankind, has succeeded in framing them all within so architectonic a synthesis. Benedetto Croce, with an aesthetic rigor which has proved to be untenable, tried to draw an oversharp distinction between the pure poetry and the didactic structure of The Divine Comedy. Happily, other critics have not pursued that endeavor to splinter its unique wholeness into fragments. Though it abounds in passages that could stand as poems by themselves or touches of detail that confer imme- diacy on seemingly distant matters, Dante's supreme imaginative achievement surely is to play the demiurge, the poet as maker who has made the framework of his poem coextensive with the cosmic system. Yet its very scale has hindered the common reader from appreciating its larger symmetries. He is likely to be more familiar with the excerpts that turn up in anthologies than with the context of supernal design. Setting out to accompany Dante, like Vergil, he may never get to paradise. This propensity to fall by the wayside-or, at any rate, to linger in</page><page sequence="4">308 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY less exalted regions-is by no means limited to the fainthearted, but represents a deep-seated aspect of the response to Dante which his commentators and editors confirm. Thus the catalog of the British Museum lists some five hundred titles under Inferno, as contrasted with a hundred and fifty under Purgatorio and about a hundred under Paradiso. Though there are fewer entries, the same discourag- ing proportions are roughly preserved in the Library of Congress and the Bibliotheque Nationale, and I dare say they would be in the Huntington Library. Thence a number of implications follow, least of all the naive fact that more people start to read a big book than ever finish it. More profound is the hard-won wisdom of Vergil, who figures as Dante's guide because he has visited Hades in the Aeneid and has discovered that the way down is much easier than the way back: "facilis descensus Averni' The descending path seems also to be the more attractive, for those who do not take it personally as a matter of life and death. Hell and purgatory are more closely linked to the circumstances of mundane existence. "The greater part of those who have heretofore lived' Jonathan Edwards would preach, .. . are now in hell' The threat of hellfire has been the main concern of Puritan sermons; Calvinism has stressed the damnation of sinners more than the salvation of the elect; and the repression of physical impulses, if less interesting, has seemed nobler than their indulgence. Sin is more recognizable than grace, just as descent is less arduous than ascent. As in Plato's myth of Er, the soul, whatever the condi- tions of its journey through the afterlife, confronts the alternative of moving downwards or upwards. Heaven itself would scarcely be meaningful unless it were juxtaposed to the notion of hell-a comple- mentary relationship which may have originated in Jung's collective unconscious, and which has been suggestively illustrated by Maud Bodkin's Archetypal Patterns in Poetry. The threat of infernal punishments, as it is invoked by the traditional doctrines of eschatol- ogy, seems to leave a stronger impression than the promise of heav- enly rewards. Hell is regarded as matter, where heaven is pure form. One of Dante's most clearheaded critics, Francesco de Sanctis, com- mented upon the Paradiso: "Its adequate form is feeling, the eternal jubilation' Hence it cannot be too precisely described; the feeling is not merely subjective, it is supersensory; and the poet can best con- vey some sense of it, paradoxically, by dwelling upon the inadequacy</page><page sequence="5">PARADISES 309 of its means of expression. Its basic precondition, along with height, is light: "prima luce, . . . pura luce, / luce intelletual, . . . somma luce, ... luce eterna" Dante is dazzled, to the verge of blindness, again and again. This bedazzlement seems all the brighter in its contrast to the darkling air he has traversed. The general effect could be epitomized in a verse from the Scottish poet Sir David Lyndsay: "Evident brychtnes, but obscuritie' Every culture harbors a longing of its own for a great good place, an island of the blest or happy valley, whose qualities are notable for their freedom from those ills to which that culture is ordinarily vul- nerable. Consequently the concept of the next world flourishes most richly in situations that are by no means flourishing; conversely it tends to be played down where satisfaction is taken in the material things of this world. The contemiptus mundi of the Middle Ages was the point of departure for a spectacular series of visions, such as the Visio Pauli or St. Patrick's Purgatory, which Howard Rollin Patch has recounted in his fascinating survey, The Other World according to Descriptions in Medieval Literature. An ascetic bleakness here below, in various religions of the East, seems to have promoted the most gorgeous expectations of the hereafter. In the United States it is the underprivileged Negro whose consolatory gospel has harped on the blessings stored up for him beyond the pearly gates. Our attempt to imagine heaven is bound to be an amelioration of the earth as we have experienced it. When-colloquializing a numinous phrase-we talk of being in the seventh heaven, we often mean no more than that we are indulging our vanity or satisfying our appetite. The voyager Maeldu'in was greeted with good liquor when he explored the other- worldly isles. Possibly this was because he had set out from Ireland; yet we recollect that the Olympian gods prided themselves upon the ambrosia they served. The fairylands of Celtic lore are far more imaginative than the Bauernhimmel, let us say, the peasants' heaven of Germanic popular tradition, which is single-minded in its devotion to creature comforts and riotous living. The daydream of another world becomes much earthier than our existing one when it takes the form of Schlaraffen- land, or the Land of Cockaigne, as it has been pictured by Pieter Brueghel. There the cottage roofs are thatched with pies, the fences are composed of sausages, the streams overflow with wine, and little</page><page sequence="6">310 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY pigs already roasted-with knives and forks conveniently stuck into them-run about squealing: "Eat me! eat me! " Its denrizens, who have eaten their way into it through a rice-pudding mountain, grossly snore unbraced and surfeited, the incarnations of sloth and gluttony. Its counterpart on the American scene would be the hobo's heaven, with its lakes of stew and whiskey too, and its Big Rock Candy Mountain. Here the idea of happiness is the removal of inhibitions ("All the cops have wooden legs") as well as the gratification of the senses. A slightly more sophisticated tribute to the enjoyments of this unbuttoned modus vivendi is presented in a seventeenth-century English broadside ballad, "An Invitation to Lubberland": There's nothing there but holy-days, with musick out of measure; Who can forbear to speak the praise of such a land of pleasure? There you may lead a lazy life, free from all kinds of labour, And he that is without a wife may borrow of his neighbour. Such heavens, from a more orthodox viewpoint, would obviously be hells. Yet they can be vehicles of religious ethics: the Middle English poem on the Land of Cockaigne is an ironc satire on the idleness, the luxury, and the lechery of the monastic establishments. And, though these all too anthropomorphic mock-heavens reduce the whole proc- ess to their own level of crude burlesque, they remind us that man 's heavenly ideals could not but be projected out of his earthly involve- ments. Indian huntsmen seek a happy hunting ground, Viking war- riors a feast in Valhalla after the battle, Jews a family reunion in Abra- ham's bosom, and polygamous Moslems a dalliance attended by houris. Every man has his own self-centered definition of euphoria and creates a heterocosm out of his unfuffilled desires. But if there is a projection from the stuff of our daily lives to the image of a higher existence, there can likewise be a sublimation in the fullest sense of the term. Of this the shining exemplar is Dante's Beatrice, who began as an object of courtly poetizing and ends-pre- figuring the Virgin Mary-as a principle of spiritual enlightenment. Even as she replaces Vergil in guiding Dante through his Paradiso, so</page><page sequence="7">PARADISES 3"I an ethereal insight must transcend a mere corporeal perception. Sig- nificantly, the transidion takes place in the Terrestrial Paradise; Dante rejoins his lost love, divinely transfigured though she be, in the very garden where Adam and Eve tasted forbidden fruit. Despite the re- finement of Dante's symbolic overview, it still conceives the after- life as an eternal prolongation of this life's happier moments, just as his Inferno transfixes its sinners in the unchanging postures of their sins. Differing views of the next world would emphasize its antitheses to this one, rather than its continuities. Many of Professor Patch's paradises cannot be described except by a string of negatives. The voyage of St. Brendan brings him to the Land of Promise "where will be found health without sickness, pleasure without contention, union without quarrel"' and so on. Felicity is the absence of such griefs as would seem to be man's usual lot, and Brendan's fabled land is a critique of what must have been a much grimmer actuality. Simi- larly, to praise the virtues of the Golden Age is to deplore the vices of subsequent ages. "Goodness is Heaven' said William Blake, abstracting the prob- lem in accordance with his belief that all deities reside in the human breast. "Evil is Hell' If this disembodiment were heresy, it had been foreshadowed long before, when certain Fathers of the Church had propounded an allegorical interpretation. The Kingdom of God, if it was not of this world, must be within; paradise must then be a state of mind. The mind is its own place, and in it self Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n. But we ought not to repeat Milton's dictum without recalling that it is spoken by Satan, who has just failed to make a hell of heaven and who will now fail to make a heaven of hell. The mind may well be its own place, but Satan's mind is an anti-paradise: "Which way I flie is Hell; my self am Hell" So long as goodness is opposed by evil, some men will go on believing in a literal heaven and hell. Emanuel Sweden- borg, though qualified as an eighteenth-century scientist, claimed that his extraordinarily concrete account of both places had been dic- tated to him by an angel "from things heard and seen' Furthermore, he believed that humans could keep in touch with the celestial sphere through a network of correspondences. "In general"' he had learned</page><page sequence="8">312 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY from his seraphic informant, "a garden corresponds to the intelli- gence and wisdom of heaven; and for that reason heaven is called the garden of God; and men call it the heavenly paradise"' Sweden- borg, in his metaphysical zeal, almost puts the signification ahead of the symbol. In the natural order, gardens come at the beginning, heavens loom at some distance, and-since the two conceptions have often coalesced-we must try to bear in mind the differentiation. The parable of the garden is the Ur-myth of mankind. Bacon recapitulated the original statement of Genesis when he opened his essay: "God Almightie first Planted a Garden.' Voltaire, after ex- tended philosophic inquiry, could make no better recommendation for happiness than the continuance of Adam's pursuit: to dress and keep, to cultivate, one's garden. Edgar Allan Poe, in one of his megalomaniac reveries, fancied himself playing God as a landscape gardener and rearranging the scenery of a large and luxuriant do- main. The garden-perennial norm of Shakespearean values-is cen- tral to the human condition because it sustains a personal relation with the universe; it embraces man's adaptation to nature and nature's adaptation to man; it domesticates for him what would otherwise be an alien environment. Taking it for granted as we too readily do, we can barely surmise how much its shade and sustenance must have meant to nomadic tribes wandering through the sunbaked wastelands of the Middle East-all that Canaan, flowing with milk and honey, later meant to the Israelites in the wilderness, all that the land of Beulah would promise again, or Zion from the vantage point of Babylon. "By how much Adam exceeded all living men in perfection, by be- ing the immediate workmanship of God' Sir Walter Ralegh would write in his magniloquent History of the World, "by so much did that chosen and particular garden exceed all parts of the universal world, in which God had planted. . . the trees of Life, of Knowledge; plants only proper, and becoming the Paradise and Garden of so great a Lord:" Ralegh devoted his third chapter to a question perennially moot, "Of the place of Paradise:" Immemorially, the Garden of Eden had been the navel of the earth, the center of the cosmos; but where would that have been? Only one of its four rivers, the Euphrates, bore its modern name; the other three have been identified with the Tigris, the Ganges, and the Nile. Thence the speculative geographers</page><page sequence="9">PARADISES 3 1 3 shifted its locality to Asia or Africa or-as we shall be seeing-to the Americas, and beyond that to the North Pole, the stratosphere, or the moon. Those sites were "castles in the air" for Ralegh, who staunchly kept his feet on scriptural ground, and appended a map of Asia Minor to show that "eastward in Eden" designated the valley of the Euphra- tes. The second chapter of Genesis is the tersest of outlines, but it has been picturesquely filled in with the elaborate details of Talmudic literature, which Louis Ginzberg brought together in his monumen- tal compilation, The Legends of the Jews. Undeterred by Mosaic warnings against enumeration, the Rabbis seem to have been fasci- nated by statistics, especially round numbers. They count eight hun- dred kinds of roses and myrtles, for instance, and sixty myriads of angels singing away in each corner of Eden. They report that the tree of life has fifteen thousand different tastes and perfumes, and that it would take five hundred years to cross an area equidistant to the diameter of the trunk of the tree of knowledge. The highest reward of the just is to sit under canopies and listen to God expounding the Torah. Such is the nostalgic retrospect of a bookish people, far removed from their promised land or agrarian state. Adam and Eve, they sur- mised, had spent no more than six or seven hours in that garden. The key to the episode is that it was closed by the Fall; and so it remains the mythical prologue to history, the timeless preserve of an inacces- sible perfection. "No one stays in Eden' James Baldwin has written in another connection. Yet everyone goes back to the ancestral sources in his own fashion, reenacting the myth of our common pro- genitor Seth, retracing the footsteps of our ultimate parents down a green path to their proscribed abode, yearning for the days when man lived in primordial innocence with the beasts and near to God, close to the tree of life and uncontaminated by the tree of knowledge. When the fable was allegorized by St. Ambrose, Eden stood for the soul; Adam symbolized the understanding and Eve the senses, with the serpent as delectation. This interpretation would seem to con- demn the very meaning of Eden, which had its derivation from a Hebrew word for pleasure. The early Christian theologians were misogynists, who dated the loss of paradise not from the expulsion or the apple but from the creation of woman. Andrew Marvell would succinctly agree:</page><page sequence="10">314 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY Such was that happy garden state, When man walked there without a mate... Two paradises 'twere in one To live in paradise alone. This would accord with Thoreau's cult of solitude at Walden, if not with Melville's "Paradise of Bachelors" which he situated, not on Tahiti or the Marquesas, but in the convivial masculine society of the Temple at London. His friend Hawthorne, on the other hand, looked upon marriage as a renewal of Eden and highlighted his stories with paradisal imagery. And Omar Khayy'am voiced his approval of soli- tude d deux by affirming that the presence of the beloved, along with a book, a jug, and a loaf, could turn a desert into an oasis: "Oh, Wilderness were Paradise enow! " Eden as the precinct of sensuous delight, hortus deliciarum, could be only the most primitive version, the pastoral prefiguration of para- dise. The latter word, deriving through the Greek from the Old Persian, is haloed with a distinctly Christian aura. Though it original- ly signified an orchard, park, or garden, its connotations have been vastly sublimated. The moment of transcendence could be marked by Luke's narrative of the crucifixion, when Jesus promises the good thief: "Today thou shalt be with me in paradise.' Where the empha- sis was mainly retrospective in the Old Testament, looking toward a lost heritage, it is prospective in the New Testament, looking toward a future dispensation. Meanwhile the location has been shifting sky- ward, so that St. Paul can speak of being "caught up into paradise" and hearing "unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter' Given the custom of burial, it has been the inherent tend- ency of many mythologies to set the habitat of the dead under- ground, in some sort of Sheol. But the tendency to look up to deity, to locate the gods in the skies, engendered a countermovement, leav- ing the souls of the damned in their underworld while translating those of the blessed to the heavens. The deep concern of the Prophets for redemption, adumbrated when the second Isaiah foretold of new heavens and a new earth, was elaborated into a chiliastic spectacle by the Revelation of St. John, with its background of early Christian persecution and its mystagogic portents of the Millennium and the Last Judgment. The Biblical story commences in a garden and concludes in a city.</page><page sequence="11">PARADISES 315 The culmination of John's apocalypse, the panorama of New Jeru- salem aglitter with precious stones and resounding with harps, arises in sublime compensation for Sodom or Babylon. St. Augustine will unfold an analogous tale of two cities: civitas dei, the holy city of the Catholic Church, and civitas terrena, the worldly corruption of the Roman Empire. When heaven is visualized as an extramundane metropolis, it reflects an urban civilization; but it may also be a re- action from an all too fleshly city toward the imaginary garden again. Here the religious nostalgia is reinforced by the literary con- ventions of pastoralism. Ernst Robert Curtius has shown how the medieval Latin poets repeatedly depicted the same ideal landscape, the locus amoenus or pleasance. Tertullian, speaking of paradise as a place of divine pleasantness ("divinae amoenitatis"), likened it to the Elysian Fields. Vergil's classic depiction of them, like Ovid's re- verberating description of the Golden Age, furnished the words and images for many poems on Eden. Some of those have been col- lected by Arturo Graf in the appendix to his monographic study, II mito del Paradiso Terrestre. "There is a certain place . . . (Est locus ... ),' they typically begin, and go on to specify its negative amenities: no chill nor blaze, no crime nor sickness, et cetera. Such is the hallowed spot from which the Phoenix takes its flight, in Latin verse and Anglo-Saxon paraphrase, to emerge as a symbol of resur- rection. It is characteristic of Dante, who found a place within his field of vision for everything, that his poem should comprehend both past and future. The past becomes the present through his encounters and recognition scenes, his dialogues with his dramatis personae, and the monologues of his mythical, legendary, and historical characters. The present becomes the future through the grandiose scheme of his work, his dramatization of Christian eschatology, the afterworld where justice is unsparing to popes and emperors who have abused it. We can recognize elements of personal retribution in the atti- tudes of this spiritual pilgrim who likewise happened to be a politi- cal exile. The city from which he was banished reappears, just as it does in Florentine paintings of the Holy Land, where the architec- ture looks Italian and the cherubim have Tuscan faces. His claims to truth must be reaffirmed at the levels of allegory, since his super- natural journey is literally fictitious, as it were a pseudo-apocalypse;</page><page sequence="12">3I6 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY yet his shrewd and poignant insights lend bodily substance to what, at other hands, might have become a sequence of weightless excur- sions in outer space. In the twenty-eighth canto of the Purgatorio, mingling the canonical traditions with bold touches of his own, he reveals the Terrestrial Paradise at the summit of the purgatorial mountain. Matelda, the tutelary spirit who welcomes the poet to this "nest of mankind' explains that it was first given by God to man as "a pledge of eternal peace"-a foretaste of the Celestial Paradise. The peace that Dante will not know on earth, he makes clear in his rendering of the Lord's Prayer, will be assured to us by the com- ing of God's kingdom. The identity of man's peace with God's will is definitively enunciated by Piccarda Donati, when Dante encoun- ters her not far beyond the threshold of heaven: "e la sua volontate e nostra pace" It is her contentment with her modest station in the moon's sphere that helps him to realize "how everywhere in heaven is paradise (com' ogni dove / in cielo e Paradiso):' In equating para- dise with the firmament, he has been guided by the astronomical knowledge of his day, and Beatrice delivers an informative lecture explaining the spots on the moon. The Ptolemaic universe, with its nine concentric spheres-the moon, the planets, the sun, the fixed stars the primurn mobile-and finally the empyrean, provides a cos- mological equivalent for the concave circles of hell or the convex stages of purgatory. As the soul moves upward, propelled by light, the setting is less visibly picturesque than the sublunary perspectives; the personages are more and more luminously depersonalized. But "the general form of paradise (la forma general di Paradiso) " though elusive, is not wholly inexpressible. It is expressed by the very mag- nitude of the spatial arrangements. Processions and pageants wind their way across Dante's path, singing hymns and celebrating festi- vals; while the white rose, emblematic, sempiternal, and multifoliate, turns out to be a prodigious kind of grandstand, with seats reserved for the hierarchy of doctors and saints and all who will have been redeemed at the grand finale. It is this happiest of conceivable endings that justifies the title of Commedia. So far as suspense goes, the drama is virtually over by the time we reach the Paradiso, and what happens there is predominantly cast in the lyrical mode. The Inferno is epical but static, because its issues have been settled for all time. Paolo and Francesca are bound</page><page sequence="13">PARADISES 317 together for a bittersweet eternity, Ugolino can never do more than gnaw upon the skull of his worst enemy, and Satan-no longer walk- ing to and fro-is immobilized in a pit of ice. The Purgatorio is the dramatic phase where the outcomes are still being decided, where the spectator Dante becomes an actor and threads his way among the other penitents. But if the Paradiso resolves the tensions, it vibrates to its planetary gyrations in a perpetual dance; the choreographic movement of the angels is harmonized with the music of the spheres. After St. Bernard's prayer on behalf of Dante, he completes his pil- grimage with a climactic vision which surpasses our power of speech: "il mio veder fu maggio / che il parlar nostro' The fulgura- tions are too blinding for us to witness the recognition scene, when he beholds the triune face of God. This reunion with the Unmoved Mover brings the poem, in the line completing its last tercet, to an acknowledgment of its motivating force: "the love that moves the sun and the other stars (I'amor che muove il sole e l'altre stelle)'" The poet's soul, caught up in that cyclic motion, will revolve with it for- ever. It would be hard to imagine a consummation more remote from the oriental Nirvana, where the reincarnate souls ascend through a long plurality of successive paradises to that final beatitude which can be nothing but oblivion. Fully to understand Dante's afterworld would be, in his own metaphor, squaring the circle. Milton, perhaps because he was so well aware of Galileo's new astronomy while con- tinuing to make a stage design out of Ptolemy's geocentric cosmol- ogy, is even more explicit in putting us off. His Raphael is quite el- liptical in describing the hierarchs, as they surround the Almighty's throne with ten thousand thousand ensigns: "in Orbes Of circuit inexpressible they stood, Orb within orb, the Father infinite" The Great Architect, so the affable archangel cautions Adam, may laugh at man's ambitious calculations and scientific conjectures: "how gird the Sphear With Centric and Eccentric scribl'd o're, Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb"</page><page sequence="14">318 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY Milton's direct approach to the court of heaven is introduced by the refulgent invocation to light that prefaces his Third Book. The iden- tification of God Himself with light gathers its special poignance from the realization that the visionary is blind. Small wonder if the phenomena that he contemplates seem to be less visible than Dante's contemplations. Wisely Milton dwells upon their inwardness: Satan carries "within him Hell"' and the Archangel Michael leaves Adam and Eve with the comforting prediction of "A Paradise within thee, happier farr" Actually we hear more-indeed we see more-of hell than of the heavens in Paradise Lost. The realm of darkness is con- ceived as a parody of the fields of light, presented at the outset in chiaroscuro and monumentally reconstructed in Pandemonium. The heavenly episodes that we best remember are the battle scenes, "War- ring in Heav'n against Heav'n's King' where the Son is armed in "Celestial Panoplie" and the "dev'lish machination" of the Adver- sary leads to the invention of gunpowder. Without accusing Milton of taking the devil's side, we could agree with Blake that he had more liberty to deal with the rebellious infernal forces. Most of Mil- ton's readers are more at ease with the diabolic, we must admit, than with what Allen Tate has called "the angelic imagmnation." To be "lowlie wise;" to "Dream not of other Worlds' is Raphael's advice to Adam and Eve: "Heav'n is for thee too high' They have every reason to be content with their "delicious Paradise" on earth. The poet ransacks Greco-Roman fable for comparisons to embel- lish the topography of their garden and to set the "Silvan Scene" for their tragedy. The charms of nature itself, orchestrating the Fall with a sigh of universal sympathy, have never been set forth with greater artifice. "Properly speaking;' Milton declares in a parenthesis of De doctrina Christiana, "Paradise is not heaven'. With some con- sistency he maintains the distinction throughout his works, reserv- ing the term for the Terrestrial Paradise, which in some ways he seems to favor over the celestial heaven-a preference consistent with his Mortalism, his reluctance to consider the soul apart from the body. "O Earth, how like to Heav'n, if not preferr'd / More just- ly . . . !" Satan exclaims. He is an untrustworthy spokesman, to be sure, and the Son-inevitably-prefers his Father's kingdom to those of this world in the sequel. Yet if amends are made with Paradise Re- gained, and Christ resists the temptation to which Adam has yielded,</page><page sequence="15">PARADISES 319 the consequence will again be "Eden raised in the wast Vilderness'. The concluding anthem of the angels can promise: "A fairer Para- dise is founded now / For Adam and his chosen sons" But that can- not be other than the internal paradise foreseen by Michael, when he predicts a happier day for the couple departing from Eden. If Paradise Regained, by virtue of its happy ending, is a comedy in the Dantesque sense, then Paradise Lost, with its double fall, is the tragedy of tragedies. As opposed to the trinitarian symbolism of Dante's progression through the three well-ordered Catholic after- worlds, the absence of Purgatory from the Protestant outlook in- tensifies the polar opposition between heaven and hell, which are in dynamic conflict through both of Milton's epics. If he individualizes where Dante systematized, it is because iconoclasm has meanwhile been challenging dogma. The Divina Commedia could be read as a guidebook which would help believers to advance from wretched- ness to a state of blessedness, as it is suggested in the epistle dedicating the Paradiso to Can Grande della Scala. The Miltonic goal is theod- icy, a justification of God's ways to man, but its moralistic purpose is tempered by the aesthetic canons of classical art. John Bunyan could offer guidance to striving Christians on the evangelical plane of a popular handbook telling them what they should or should not do to be saved: The Pilgrim's Progress from This World to That Which Is to Come. The practical and plainspoken manner of Bun- yan's allegory seems to be more effective along the road and across an English-looking countryside, where pitfalls are pointed out, than at the terminus, a conventionally gilded evocation of the Celestial City. In his satirical tale, "The Celestial Railroad' modernizing the theology as well as the technology, Hawthorne could reverse the direction and send his pilgrims to hell. The allegorical purport of The Faerie Queene is ethical rather than theological. As an idealized picture of Elizabethan England, blending various myths and supernatural motifs into its idealization of nature, Spenser's Fairyland lies well out of this world yet not quite in the next. Its fabulous terrain is fertile soil for earthly paradises, such as the Garden of Adonis glimpsed in Book III, where Belphoebe, the heroine who personifies chastity, has been nurtured amid the haunts of pagan voluptuousness. In Book II it is the Bower of Bliss, where Sir Guyon, the champion of temperance, climaxes his adven-</page><page sequence="16">320 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY tures by dauntlessly resisting and putting down the blandishments of the temptress Acrasia. The sensuous beauty of this "daintie Para- dise" is invidiously compared with many a Greek prototype-to which Spenser adds, with a touch of puritanic compunction, "Or Eden selfe, if ought with Eden mote compare'? Elsewhere, in one of his Amoretti, the not quite attainable bosom of the poet's beloved is termed "the bower of blisse, the paradice of pleasure." Paradise, tra- ditionally associated with carnal temptation, thus presents a demoral- izing ambush of forbidden delights to the virtuous knights of Spenser and his predecessors in Christian heroic romance, Ariosto and Tasso. Those notorious gardens of their respective enchantresses-where Ruggiero is seduced by Alcina in the Orlando Furioso, or where Rinaldo dallies with Armida in the Gerusalemme Liberata-are de- cadent and illusory versions of Eden, Ariosto's "birthplace of love.' Such enchantments, though malign, are accepted as truly magical. We hear reports of other snares and delusions which, while pretend- ing to the miraculous, were contrived by perverse human ingenuity. Mandeville has an anecdote about a certain rich man, living on the eastern Isle of Mistorak, who redecorated his castle and grounds in that paradisal style which has become so obvious to us: precious stones, plashing wines, musical accompaniments, delicacies served by damsels and striplings dressed in cloth of gold to simulate angels. The subtle deceit, as Mandeville phrases it, was to befuddle his knightly visitors into laying down their lives for their host, in the belief that they would be thereby entitled to spend an eternal life on his prem- ises. This might serve as a cautionary example of a fool's paradise. Those who were disinclined to be taken in might become wary, not merely of their over-enterprising fellow men, but of institutions and doctrines which put off the fulfillment of their glittering promises until after death. Was immortality to be taken for granted, or was it an illusion? What did men know about heaven, after all, they asked themselves in their Enlightenment? An article in the Encyclopedie pointed out that the notion of a paradise in the sky had been rendered obsolete by modern astronomers; if le paradis existed, it was "not a place but a change of state:" As for the Millennium, it supplied an occasion for some of Gibbon's most withering ironies: So pleasing was this hope to the mind of believers, that the New Jerusa- lem, the seat of this blissful kingdom, was quickly adorned with all the</page><page sequence="17">PARADISES 321 gayest colours of the imagination. A felicity consisting only of pure and spiritual pleasure would have appeared too refined for its inhabitants, who were still supposed to possess their human nature and senses. A garden of Eden, with the amusements of the pastoral life, was not suited to the advanced state of society which prevailed under the Roman em- pire. A city was therefore erected of gold and precious stones, and a supernatural plenty of corn and wine was bestowed on the adjacent ter- ritory; in the free enjoyment of whose spontaneous productions, the happy and benevolent people was never to be restrained by any jealous laws of exclusive property. Gibbon's periods are far more elegant than the revivalistic strains of "The Sweet Bye and Bye"' but the same note of skeptical reservation can be heard in Joe Hill's burlesque: "You'll get pie in the sky when you die?' Stated more positively, the implication was a socialistic demand for more pie on earth-or, as Heinrich Heine sang, for roses and myrtles, beauty and happiness, yes, and green peas for every- body, leaving the heavens to the angels and sparrows. We deflect our gaze from the welkin, then, to the garden once more. Some of the learned authorities speculated that the Terrestrial Paradise had been washed away by the Flood; others argued that it had survived because of its position on a mountain-top. Enoch and Elijah still lived there, it was believed, having been translated bodily; and Alexander the Great had vainly tried to storm the verdant sum- mit. Travelers' tales connected the territory with the mysterious land of Prester John. One of Columbus' favorite books, the Ymago mundi of Pierre d'Ailly, gave it a standing in fifteenth-century geography and summed it up in a reminiscent phrase as "locus amoenissimus' Hence Columbus came to feel that he had all but rediscovered it dur- ing his third expedition in 1498. He assumed that it was in the Orient, of course, as he assumed that he was: "in the ocean sea at the end of the East' The actual spot that he seems to have had in mind was somewhere near the peninsula of Paria, at the mouth of the Orinoco River, in what would soon be named the Spanish Main. Believing that fateful tract could not be entered without God's permission, he did not investigate further; but in an eloquent letter to his royal patrons, Ferdinand and Isabella, he marshaled the observations and precedents in favor of this conclusion. He was now of the opinion that the earth was pear-shaped rather than round, that the newly dis- covered hemisphere was shaped like a woman's breast, and that the</page><page sequence="18">32 2 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY Earthly Paradise was located at a high point corresponding to the nipple. Samuel Eliot Morison, in his compelling biography, Admiral of the Ocean Sea, explains how Columbus might have arrived at such a theory by miscalculating his altitudes. Yet there may have been a deeper impulsion at work-not unrelated to that primal urge which prompted Edmund Spenser to describe his lady's breasts as a bower of bliss-so that Columbus, seeking the aboriginal site of human generation, would nostalgically envisage it as a maternal archetype. At all events, it inspired Bishop Las Casas, the sixteenth-century chronicler of the Indies, to an erudite digression authenticating the Earthly Paradise and distinguishing it from pagan superstitions about the Elysian Fields. Later voyagers, notably Amerigo Vespucci, would localize it southward; Richard Hakluyt, in his chronicles of the Eng- lish navigations, would place it south of the equinoctial line (Dray- ton, in his ode addressed to Hakluyt, hailed Virginia as "earth's onely paradise"). Its role in the discovery and colonization of Brazil has been canvassed by S6rgio Buarque de Holanda in Visao do Paraiso, while its influence upon the relations between Europe and the United States has been studied by Charles L. Sanford in Quest for Paradise. With the economic development of the Americas, Eldorado must have seemed a more pertinent image than Eden, and the search for the noble savage had to be pushed ever westward to the South Sea isles. With the decolonization of postwar years and the emergence of underdeveloped nations, the horizons of priminvistic escape have been closing in upon us. The impact of these changes on the West- ern conscience and consciousness has been registered lately by Henri Baudet in a farseeing little treatise entitled-what else but Paradise on Earth? Eden is always set far apart from civilization in space or time. There was a time-already past for Shakespeare's John of Gaunt- when England could be hailed as "This other Eden, demi-paradise." But that green world had totally receded by the epoch of the Indus- trial Revolution, and Blake's prophetic wntings form a program for messianic revival: to abolish "the dark Satanic mills" and to build a New Jerusalem "In England's green and pleasant land' Impatient for that advent, Englishmen might cross the Atlantic with Martin Chuz- zlewit, lured by a prospectus for the Eden Land Corporation on the</page><page sequence="19">PARADISES 323 banks of the Missouri River; but the "flourishing city" advertised by promoters is as yet no more than a "hideous swamp"; and Dickens' young surveyor, after having nearly succumbed to its fevers, returns to the Old World a poorer and wiser man. The American record is full of other Edens raised in the wilderness with greater success, demi-paradises brought up to date with all the latest conveniences of Utopia. The Edenic impulse, however, has been at odds with the Utopian impetus. Reviewing a book by a German technocrat, J. A. Etzler, The Paradise within Reach of All Men, Thoreau sharply recoiled from its campaign for salvation by labor-saving devices: Thus is Paradise to be Regained, and that old and stern decree at length reversed. Man shall no more earn his living by the sweat of his brow. All labor shall be reduced to "a short turn of some crank' and "taking the finished articles away" But there is a crank,-oh, how hard to be turned! Could there not be a crank upon a crank,-an infinitely small crank?-we would fain inquire. No, alas! not. But there is a certain dim energy in every man, but sparingly employed as yet, which may be called the crank within, quite indispensable to all work. Would that we might get our hands on its handle! In fact, no work can be shirked. It may be postponed indefinitely, but not infinitely. Nor can any really important work be made easier by cooperation or machinery. This would seem to be one of those situations where Thoreau stands alone, where the railroad has rushed by Walden Pond, where the crank within has unfortunately been superseded by the push button without. "Of course' Thoreau was to jot in his journal, "we do not expect that our paradise will be a garden" His daily life in the woods or on the pond or at the bean-field was like the hardworking routine of Adam after the Fall. Nor would he have wanted to be exempt from the aftereffect of Original Sin upon nature: "the penalty of Adam' as Shakespeare put it, "The seasons' difference" After the summer birds, the autumn colors, the winter snows, Thoreau noted in Walden: "As every season seems best to us in its turn, so the com- ing in of spring is like the creation of Cosmos out of Chaos and the realization of the Golden Age' It may be that so exceptional a personality could succeed in inter- nalizing his individual paradise. Wordsworth, in a fragment of The Recluse, held that anyone could do so under the proper conditions and that such perceptions could be externalized:</page><page sequence="20">324 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY Paradise, and groves Elysian, Fortunate Fields-like those of old Sought in the Atlantic Main-why should they be A history only of departed things, Or a mere fiction of what never was? For the discerning intellect of Man, When wedded to this goodly universe In love and holy passion, shall find these A simple produce of the common day. But this is too abrupt a comedown from the unattainable to the com- monplace; paradise would soon lose its luster, for most of us, if it were so accessibly near at hand; it is the impossibility of their quest that makes heroes out of William Morris' wayfarers in The Earthly Para- dise. The truest paradises, lamented Marcel Proust, are those that we have lost ("car les vrais paradis sont les paradis qu'on a perdus"). His innocent childhood in those Parisian gardens known as the Champs Elysees, like the heaven that lay about Wordsworth in his infancy, was perfect because it was irretrievable except through the nostalgic illuminations of art-the only other world with which Proust ulti- mately reckoned. Moralists, regarding the loss of Eden as a fortunate lapse, could look ahead to man's destiny rather than back toward his origins, in the pious hope that paradise could be regained by his moral exertions. His unwillingness to accept his mortality, along with his desire to participate more actively in the mysteries of existence, found encouragement among the theologians. Happiness is always in the past or in the future, Schopenhauer has observed, while the pres- ent is always cloudy. To which we might subjoin a remark of the Romanian essayist, E. M. Cioran, that all paradisiacal visions take place in a static world, in a time that is out of time, an everlasting spring or unending youth. Nonetheless they have animated the his- tory of the only world we know with any certainty, luring Colum- bus on toward a mnirage of repose on the very bosom of Mother Earth and mitigating Dante's troubled dreams wlth intimuations of conntnual love and eternal peace.</page></plain_text>
