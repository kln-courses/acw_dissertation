<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of the American Academy of Religion LXIII/4 Early Rabbinic Exegesis on Noah's Son Ham and the So-Called 'Hamitic Myth' David H. Aaron I. INTRODUCTION There are many myths about myths, and this essay endeavors to counteract one which has proven particularly deleterious to histori- ans of religion. The idea of a "Hamitic Myth" first came to my attention when a colleague questioned me concerning a passage in the tract known as The Secret Relationship of the Blacks and Jews, an anti-Jewish document published by the Nation of Islam.' When the colleague inquired about the Jewish origins of the myth, I was unable to respond as I was unfamiliar with a "myth" by this appel- lation. Later I learned that what underlay the issue was the Curse of Canaan (Genesis 9) and how it with other exetegical traditions would be woven together into a mythology about Noah's descend- ants. The matrix of images to emerge would be distorted in numer- ous para-academic tracts, but more surprisingly and more importantly, misconceptions about the "Jewish origins" of the Hamitic myth and its alleged role in the African slave trade would be echoed in respected publications. In the case of the former, misconceptions are pursued because they satisfy ideological dispo- sitions (usually nefarious), while in the case of the latter, I believe they are preserved on the basis of what one might call "scholarly inertia." My goals here are two: (1) to provide an analysis of the exegesis on Ham-related passages in Genesis 9-10 in the earliest relevant rabbinic sources, namely Genesis Rabbah (GnR) and the two David H.

Two scholars have already discussed the most important aspects of the historical record on these matters: Ephraim Isaac provides a comprehensive discussion of Second Temple Period and Rabbinic sources in his article "Genesis, Judaism, and the Sons of Ham"2; Bernard Lewis discusses rabbinic and Islamic sources relevant to this "myth" in his book Race and Slavery in the Middle East: An Historical Enquiry (Ch.8, with particular detail in note 9, 123-125). While Isaac's and Lewis's writings set the basic record straight, neither of them set out to decode the complex exegetical passages which surround the character-portrayals of Ham and his sons. Consequently, from these articles alone it may not become apparent to the non-expert in rabbinic literature why the Curse of Ham is not what many have made it out to be. This essay seeks to uncover the hermeneutics of the rabbinic passages noted above as they form the basis for grave misconceptions. It will not offer a history of the exegesis beyond these texts which have been at the root of the myth about the myth; that task remains to be done. The discussion will be structured as follows: in Section II I shall define the so-called Hamitic Myth by drawing upon a few examples in previously published material; in Section III the biblical sources which underlie the whole controversy will be analyzed; Section IV will be concerned with the rabbinic exegesis; in Section V I shall raise the issue of how rabbinic literature might relate to the writing of history. II. MYTH ABOUT THE MYTH In The Oxford Companion to the Hebrew Bible (1993:268) under the heading, "Ham/Canaan, Cursing of," Steven L. McKenzie pro- vided the following entry: "Because some of Ham's descendants, notably Cush, are black (see Gen. 10.6-14), the "curse of Ham" has 2The reader should refer to Isaac 1985, 1992, or the Encyclopaedia Judaica for more exten- sive lists of relevant sources beyond those considered in this essay, including some Medieval references. Isaac's goal is to treat the theme generally, not the hermeneutics which underlie the key passages as will be done here. The medieval materials are for the most part, simple adaptations of the earliest midrashic strands. Isaac also discusses issues of methodology.</page><page sequence="3">Aaron: Early Rabbinic Exegesis 723 been interpreted as black (Negroid) skin color and features in order to legitimate slavery and oppression of people of African ori- gin. This interpretation occurs first in the Talmud and has persisted in certain circles" (my italics). McKenzie provides absolutely no references for this "interpreta- tion," which he believes to have first appeared in the Talmud. Moreover, his comment implies that there was a black African slave trade during the talmudic period, but once again, there is abso- lutely no source cited as supporting evidence for this. It is also curious that a companion to the Hebrew Bible would take it upon itself to offer so diachronic an assessment (inaccurate at that) with- out considering its intellectual and social impact. Indeed, much more could be said about Ham in the context of Scripture than McKenzie endeavors to do, but that information is ignored for the more obscure discussion of a post-biblical myth. What did the author have in mind with the phrase, "persisted in certain circles?" Again, no source is given to demonstrate this claim, but the entry does not hesitate to ascribe to the talmudic interpretation both lon- gevity and social importance when it came to justifying the slavery and oppression of people of African origin. Of course, not a single medieval source is noted. McKenzie (as well as the others to be noted below) might have been surprised to learn that in the Bible commentaries of Rashi (d.1105), Abraham ibn Ezra (d.1167), the Ramban (d.1274) and Sforno (d.1550)-i.e., the main commenta- tors printed in standard Rabbinic Bibles-there is no remnant of this legitimization of African slavery. A similar generalization, once again without any primary sources cited, occurs in an article by J. R. Willis (ironically in the very book which contains Ephraim Isaac's article noted above). Willis maintains, "[though there is] neither suggestion of color, race nor ethnicity in the Genesis text [with regard to Ham], by a strange migration of meaning, the sense of darker hue springs from rabbinical fancy and is thrust into the original theme-the sons of Ham become men of color destined to a fate of servility" (8, my italics). There is no basis for Willis's understanding of the relevant passages in Genesis or the alleged "rabbinical fancy." One need only take into account the genealogies of Genesis 10 to recognize that the biblical text establishes (some) African peoples as the descendants of Ham. Rabbinic exegesis simply makes explicit what is implied in the biblical source, namely that some of Ham's</page><page sequence="4">724 Journal of the American Academy of Religion descendants are black. Thus, the "sense of darker hue" does not just spring from "rabbinical fancy" to be thrust into the original theme; the Bible itself determines the genealogical links. However, having created an etiological paradigm-namely, that black people will descend from non-black people-rabbinic exegesis does offer an explanation. There, of course, exegetical "fancy" does take over, but it can only be understood when it is contextualized-something Willis has not done for the reader. Willis cites as support for his summary a passage in a book by R. Graves and R. Patai called Hebrew Myths (1964); and, if I under- stand his footnote correctly, he has not quoted the passage directly from this book, but has rather copied it from a problematic article by Edith R. Sanders (Sanders: 521). The distortions in Sanders's piece are numerous; for our purposes a couple of examples will suffice. As was the case with both McKenzie and Willis, one finds in Sanders's essay sweeping statements about midrashic and tal- mudic literature, suggesting that they are one homogeneous corpus, uniform in thought and equally representative of "Jewish" thought. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth, but the failure to contextualize in all of these articles would appear to stem from the authors' dependence upon secondary sources for their understanding of "Talmud" and "Midrash." Sanders depicts the Hamitic myth in rabbinic literature as follows: "The Babylo- nian Talmud, a collection of oral traditions of the Jews, appeared in the sixth century A.D.; it states that the descendants of Ham are cursed by being black, and depicts Ham as a sinful man and his progeny as degenerates. Thus, early tradition identified the Hami- ties with Negroes and endowed them with both certain physiog- nomical attributes and an undesirable character. This notion persisted in the Middle Ages, when fanciful rabbinical expansions of the Genesis stories were still being made" (522).3 The highly problematic nature of Sanders's depiction of the Tal- mud and summary of its contents is extended into a consideration of how "Talmudic and Midrashic explanations of the myth of Ham were well known to Jewish writers in the Middle Ages" (522). In the present essay it will not be possible to consider medieval sources in a comprehensive manner, but since Sanders's presenta- tion of the evidence is quite typical of much current scholarhip, it 3Sanders draws her materials from T. F. Gossett and Graves and Patai. One cannot help but note the rhetorical similarities between Sanders's writing and that of Willis cited above.</page><page sequence="5">Aaron: Early Rabbinic Exegesis 725 is worthwhile noting her treatment of Benjamin of Tudela's travelog (d. circa 1180). Without any reference to evidence which might serve to link the "early tradition" with the later medieval mindset, Sanders (521) draws attention to Benjamin's unquestionably pejo- rative reflections on the Nubians of the upper Nile.4 She interprets the negative description as both indicative and typical of the medi- eval Jewish grasp of the "Talmudic or Midrashic explanations of the myth of Ham" (522). "By and large," writes Sanders, "the Negro was seen as a descendant of Ham, bearing the stigma of Noah's curse" (523). Sanders quotes a limited passage from Benjamin's travelog as it is translated by R. Hess (1965) without having considered the con- text, the characteristics of the genre, or Benjamin's rhetoric more broadly. She deletes (by marking elipses) two key sections of Hess's own citation, both of which draw attention to nuances that contradict her thesis about Benjamin's use of the Hamitic Myth.5 Benjamin describes the Nubians as animal-like, eating "of the herbs that grow on the banks of the Nile and in the fields"; they "go about naked and have not the intelligence of ordinary men. They cohabit with their sisters and any one they find. The climate is very hot." Are we to take this description as indicative of Benja- min's attitude toward all blacks as the descendants of the cursed Ham or does the text indicate a particular attitude toward a spe- cific tribe? Sanders employs the passage to support the former claim, but only the latter can be supported with the unmanipulated evidence. The particularity of this tribe is conveyed in the two phrases Sanders omits. Here is part of the text ignored by Sanders as it appears in Hess's article: "It is a twenty days' journey from there through the desert of Seba to the land of Uswan [Aswan] on the Nile, which comes down from Cush. They have a king whom they call Sultan al-Habesh. There is a people among them who, like animals. . .etc." (16-17). 4Sanders: 522, takes a text from R. Hess :17; I am using the critical edition by Adler 1907 (in the Hebrew the relevant passage is ? 96), as well as the more recent edition introduced by Signer 1983, where the relevant passage is on 127. 5 Sanders records the passage as follows: "There is a people. . .who, like animals, eat of the herbs that grow on the banks of the Nile and in their fields. They go about naked and have not the intelligence of ordinary men. They cohabit with their sisters and anyone they can find.. .they are taken as slaves and sold in Egypt and neighbouring countries. These sons of Ham are black slaves" (522).</page><page sequence="6">726 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Sanders leaves out the partitive phrase "among them," present- ing the reader with only, "There is a people. . .who, like animals, eat of the herbs. .. ." (522). With the entire context intact, we understand that the entire population of the region is Cushite, but the bizarre behaviors of this particular tribe in their midst draws Benjamin's attention. The other part of the quote Sanders fails to bring in (as is indicated by the second elipsis in her citation) makes the distinctiveness of this tribe yet more salient. Benjamin relates how the men of Assuan would raid the region and take Nubians as prisoners to be sold "in the land of Egypt and in the surrounding countries. And they are the black slaves, the sons of Ham."6 This identification, "they are the black slaves," suggests that Benjamin understood the slave-descendants of Ham to be quite distinguishable from other black peoples. Indeed, nothing indi- cates that the people of Aswan are other than black, so that what we appear to have is a group of blacks taking a second group of blacks as prisoners for a slave trade. Sanders simply quotes the ".. .they are taken as slaves," omitting who the attackers are. My interpretation-which views this passage as describing the specific group of Nubians and not blacks as the descendants of Ham, in general-is supported by a more thorough consideration of Benjamin's treatment of people of color. Here is Benjamin's description of the blacks of the port-city of Khulam (Quilon, Malabar): These are the sons of Cush,7 who read the stars, and are all black in color. They are honest in commerce. When merchants come to them from distant lands and enter the harbor, three of the king's secretaries go down to them and record their names, and then bring them before the king, whereupon the king makes himself responsible even for their property which they leave in the open, 6My italics; Adler's rendering (127). Sanders uses Hess's translation which reads "These sons of Ham are black slaves." Hess comments that "it is convenient to give [his] own trans- lation of this passage here," based "for the most part" on the British Museum manuscript which underlies the Adler critical edition. What Hess meant by the words, "for the most part," is impossible to say. The Hebrew in the Adler critical edition is whm h'vdym hihwrm bny hm, quite literally, "they are the black slaves, sons of Ham"; no variants are cited in the apparatus. The Adler translation reads, "and these are the black slaves, the sons of Ham." The reader will find Hess' altogether reasonable discussion of why Benjamin depicted these people in such exotic terms most interesting, but of course, it does not allude to a Hamitic myth as a motivating factor. 7See Adler's note on the meaning of Cush, Benjamin of Tudela 115, who notes that the region identified by this name includes countries east of the Tigris.</page><page sequence="7">Aaron: Early Rabbinic Exegesis 727 unprotected. There is an official who sits in his office, and the owner of any lost property has only to describe it to him when he hands it back. This custom prevails in all that country. [. . .] And throughout the island, including all the towns, there live several thousand Israelites. The inhabitants are all black, and the Jews are also. The latter are good and benevolent. They know the law of Moses and the prophets, and to a small extent the Talmud and Halacha. It is absurd to take Benjamin's description of the Nubians of the upper Nile as a stereotypical, racist depiction of black people. In fact, what should be concluded is that far from being a racial category (blackness), Benjamin related the enslaved sons of Ham to a very specific group of black Nubians who occupied the upper Nile. In other words, if there is a "myth of Ham" operative in Benjamin's writings, it is quite obviously not racial, but geographi- cally or tribally based, (this is especially the case if the Aswan raid- ers were blacks as were the Nubians). As is made clear by the passage I have just quoted, the sons of Cush dwelling at Khulam, who must also be recognized as descendants of Ham (whether or not the myth is operative), are distinct from those who are black slaves and likewise Hamites. The Cushites of Khulam are depicted in only the most benevolent and laudatory terms and no curse appears to plague their community. The problem for Sanders and those who follow her line of thinking is that concepts of race sim- ply did not function during the Middle Ages the way they do today, so that any claim that a talmudic or midrashic ideology of Hamitic descendants as black slaves dominated the medieval Jewish mentality toward blackness is folly.8 These examples (and, unfortunately, many others could be cited), taken from reputable publications, indicate how a potent myth has been attributed to the Talmud without sufficiently estab- lishing the sources or their meanings in context. Complicating 8The whole issue of race during the Medieval Period is quite complex and cannot be con- sidered in this context. Benjamin Braude (1995, forthcoming) has brought to my attention a passage from the Medieval travelog of Sir John Mandeville (circa 1350), which identifies the "people of Israel" as descendants of Japhet rather than Shem. Braude believes there did not exist in antiquity a consistent racial-geographic interpretation of the biblical Noah material. Consequently, any notion that modern racism is founded upon an ancient Jewish or Chris- tian reading of Scripture cannot be justified on the basis of the evidence. My thanks to Braude for sharing with me his work in progress. His findings will be presented in a forth- coming paper: "Mandeville's Sons of Noah and the Construction of Racial Identities" (Octo- ber 1995, Sixteenth Century Studies Conference, San Francisco).</page><page sequence="8">728 Journal of the American Academy of Religion matters is the fact that there has been ascribed to Jews generally an ideology regarding blacks and slavery for which cogent evidence has yet to be offered.9 These assessments would appear to have been integrated into the narratives without any political or social ramifications in mind. Of course, that is not the case in the more venomous hate literature which is in fashion today. Consider the following passage taken from Tony Martin's The Jewish Onslaught: Despatches from the Wellesley Battlefront (1993: 32-33). Reflecting upon a letter he received which employs motifs (in a distorted fash- ion) from the Curse of Canaan passage in Genesis, Martin explains: This is of course the newest rendition of the very old Hamitic Myth.. .whereby Noah in the biblical book of Genesis cursed the descendants of his son Ham. The association of Ham with the Afri- can race made of this myth a major rationalization for the European enslavement of Africans. For if God himself had ordained that Afri- cans should forever be hewers of wood and drawers of water for the children of Europe and Asia, then the moral dilemma of slavery was resolved. The slavemaster was simply doing God's will. Christians have customarily borne the brunt of the blame for the Hamitic Myth, and they certainly are not without sin in this regard. Yet, the Hamitic Myth (that is, the association of the Afri- can with the supposed curse of Noah), was invented by Jewish tal- mudic scholars over a thousand years before the transatlantic slave trade began. As important as may have been the Jewish involve- ment in helping finance and prosecute the Atlantic slave trade (as detailed in The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews), their invention of the Hamitic Myth may be of even greater importance, since it provided the moral pretext upon which the entire trade grew and flourished. (pp.32-33, my italics) Any surface reading of the biblical text indicates that the only son to receive a curse is Canaan, while the others have not even been mentioned in the text yet. Martin claims that the "talmudic sages" created the myth which ultimately served in the theological justification and-more significantly-the moral pretext for the enslavement of blacks. While recognizing the "sin" of Christians (Muslims for some reason go unmentioned), Martin implies a direct link between the values of those who engineered the African 9Many other examples could be cited; see Isaac's discussion (1985:82f.) of similar portray- als in scholarly literature. Isaac also draws attention to the problematic entry in the classic Jewish Encyclopaedia.</page><page sequence="9">Aaron: Early Rabbinic Exegesis 729 slave trade and the moral precepts of the Talmud. In support of this assertion, Martin cites the dissertation of Harold Brackman (80-81). The problem is that Brackman was totally dependent upon secondary sources for his understanding of this myth in rabbinic literature, and in a forthcoming publication, he acknowl- edges his reliance on translations and paraphrastic renderings.10 Martin only cites Brackman, never Brackman's sources. The text Martin takes from Brackman-and, as it turns out, a pivotal text in the history of this myth about the myth-runs as follows: ...Ham is told by his outraged father that, because you have abused me in the darkness of the night, your children shall be born black and ugly; because you have twisted your head to cause me embarrassment, they shall have kinky hair and red eyes; because your lips jested at my exposure, theirs shall swell; and because you neglected my nakedness, they shall go naked with their shamefully elongated male members exposed for all to see (35). This "text" is a composite; no single historical source contains these exact images; and those which have some of them, or variants thereof, differ in significant ways and must be understood in their original literary contexts. On the other hand, as will become quite evident, Ham is treated consistently in a derogatory manner in rabbinic literature. How then, do we treat the claim that the Tal- mud (or any rabbinic document) could be responsible for originat- ing an ideological position regarding slavery in Western Civilization? To this question we will turn at the end of this essay. At the present time, having established the nature of the Hamitic Myth in contemporary scholarship, it is important to establish the content of the texts in the Hebrew Bible and early rabbinic litera- ture which have fueled the misconceptions. III. THE BIBLICAL TEXT The biblical materials which underlie this controversy can be found in Genesis 9-10. The most often cited verses are those of 101n my seeking a copy of his dissertation to trace down Martin's citation, Brackman sent me materials, soon to be published, which indicate this. Martin cites Brackman so that he might be able to say that he took the information from a Jew. This is a typical ploy of this genre. See Davis' comment pertaining to this practice, Davis 1994.</page><page sequence="10">730 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Genesis 9:18-27 which are presented here as they appear in the JPS translation of the Tanakh. The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham and Japheth-Ham being the father of Canaan. These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the whole world branched out. Noah, the tiller of the soil, was the first to plant a vineyard. He drank of the wine and became drunk, and he uncovered himself within his tent. Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father's naked- ness and told his two brothers outside. But Shem and Japheth took a cloth, placed it against both their backs and, walking back- ward, they covered their father's nakedness; their faces were turned the other way, so that they did not see their father's nakedness. When Noah woke up from his wine and learned what his youngest son had done to him, he said: "Cursed be Canaan; the lowest of slaves shall he be to his brothers." And he said, "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem; let Canaan be a slave to them. May God enlarge Japheth, and let him dwell in the tents of Shem; and let Canaan be a slave to them." The biblical text is laden with problems. At the very beginning, the gloss attached to Ham's name, "Ham being the father of Canaan," establishes the socio-political agenda of the redactor. The original passage must simply have read that all human beings were descendants from these three men, but as the redactor's pur- pose is to include a story about Israel's use of Canaanite labor and eventually, to discredit the ethos of other peoples, the gloss-bla- tantly anachronistic-serves as a foreshadowing. Similarly moti- vated must be the salience of Shem who will have dominion over both Canaan and Japheth (the latter will dwell in Shem's tents). The Israelites and the Arabs would figure prominently as his descendants (Isaac 1992:V,1195; 111,31). There is no reason given as to why Ham's actions should result in the cursing of Noah's grandson Canaan-a child otherwise not yet mentioned in the Gen- esis narrative. What is clear is that the curse should have fallen on Ham, for he commits the wrong-doing. In short, the biblical writer didn't need a "Curse of Ham," but did need a "Curse of Canaan." The Midrash Genesis Rabbah is well aware of this textual problem and asks quite directly: "He said, Cursed by Canaan .... Ham sins</page><page sequence="11">Aaron: Early Rabbinic Exegesis 731 but Canaan is cursed! How so?" (GnR 36 ? 7)11 A consideration of the midrashic solutions will occupy us below. The Noah narrative is most often seen as the merging of at least two independent sources, that of the J and the P writers (Bailey 1989; Sarna 1989). The early source was apparently concerned with the immediate environs so that the names Shem, Ham, and Japheth were proposed as ancestors of only the Israelites, Canaanites and perhaps the Philistines or Phoenicians respectively (Bailey: 160). In contrast, Genesis 10 (P) expands the genealogy quite considerably. Indeed, this so-called "Table of Nations" epito- mizes the priestly conception of national divisions according to ter- ritorial, linguistic and familial characteristics (Gen. 10:20,31). It covers the region from the Caucasus in the north to southern Ara- bia, the Iranian plateau, Crete and perhaps beyond in the west. Canaan, the future site of the land of Israel is naturally placed at the center (Sarna: 68). Not all of the names can be identified with certainty today; indeed, many may have been inherited by the P writer without him ever having had real contact with these peoples. Generally, it is thought that Shem includes both the Israelites and ironically their rivals (in later eras), the Arameans and the Assyri- ans. The sons of Ham include African peoples and the Egyptians, as well as the Canaanites. Japheth will provide ancestry for an extremely wide geographic domain, including much of Asia Minor and Europe. As such, the geo-political connotations of divisions were different for the writers of the originally discrete narratives. It is extremely important to note that racial characteristics, physical types, or the color of skin play absolutely no role in the identification of groups. Nahum Sarna points out that despite the Bible's claims to the contrary (Gen. 10:20,31), even language fails to serve as a consistent grouping device; the Canaanites were recognized as speaking the same tongue as the Israelites (Isaiah 19:18) but were nonetheless attributed to a different patriarch (Sarna: 68). Clearly the socio-political concerns outweighed any other logic in the divi- sion of peoples. 11Also see the Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 70a-b which has two sins attributed to Ham: (1) he castrated his father and (2), he sexually abused him. Both of these themes are repeated in later sources, including the Tanhuma and Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer (Pirke 170) where Canaan is explicitly the person who emasculates Noah, not Ham! On the sexual overtones of the biblical material in general, see Eilberg-Schwartz: ch.4.</page><page sequence="12">732 Journal of the American Academy of Religion The sons of Ham in Torah are four: Kush, Mitzraim, Put, and Canaan. In the Genesis text-as it reads now-Kush (or Cush), is eponymously the father of black Ethiopians (in Hebrew, the Kushites) and the Nubians; Canaan, Ham's fourth son, is con- demned to slavery.12 Though their destinies and characteristics are altogether independent, conflation does occur in biblical sources, as it will in some post-biblical texts. The name "Ham" is periodi- cally used in place of the name of his son Mitzraim when referring to Egypt. (Ham is used metonymically for all of Egypt in Psalms 78:51, 105:23,27, 106:22; I Chron. 4:40.) The midrash will envi- sion the biblical image of the Egyptian (Mitzraim) and Ethiopian/ Nubian (Kush) captives being led away by Sennacherib (Isaiah 20:4) as the result of Ham's indiscretion (see below).13 Lloyd Bai- ley has suggested that "the problem with the switch in names (Ham looks and Canaan is cursed) arises primarily when one reads the text as if it were an account of individuals, rather than reading it as an etiology" (161). Bailey's argument supposes that "ancient hearers would not have clearly distinguished the Canaanites from the larger Hamitic group to which they were assigned" (161). The metonymic manner of referencing appella- tives elsewhere in the Bible might be used to support this thesis, but just how one "heard" the name-switch must remain specula- tive. For us, the more crucial question is, How does all of this pan out in terms of the dominant themes and popular mythology? The etymology of these names is dubious, as is often the case with old appellations. Ham may be derived from a West Semitic name for a sun god, Hammu, but there is no certainty. Canaan could be related to the Western Semitic roots for "to bend, or bow," or perhaps "lowland," though scholars have recently linked it to non-semitic words as well, perhaps connoting "Occident" (Astour). Later interpreters would understand the name with the homiletical sense of "to be humbled, to humiliate oneself."14 The names Kush 121 am relating here the common designations, as reflected for example in Isaiah 43:3 and 45:14. In fact the text is more complex than this. There was an ancient kingdom of Kish in Mesopotamia; Gen. 10:8 appears to recognize this and makes Kush the father of Nimrod. Consequently, Kush fathered both Africans and Mesopotamians. See Sarna :19-20 and 72- 73. 13See Tanhuma Noah ? 15 and Tanhuma Buber 2.21. Keep in mind that the humiliation of the black Nubians and the non-black Egyptians is not based on race here, but on the challenge of cultural assimilation which is the issue for Isaiah 20. 14Some have viewed the name Ham as related to the Hebrew word meaning, "to be hot," not unlike the Greek aithiopes. See, for instances, the Cyclopaedia of Biblical Theological and</page><page sequence="13">Aaron: Early Rabbinic Exegesis 733 and Mitzraim, both place names, are attested in a variety of ancient documents, but their meanings are obscure (Koehler/Baumgartner, ad loc). The adjectival designation "Kushite" occurs a number of times in the Hebrew Bible. It does not appear to be a racial term as much as it designates a person's geographic origins. In II Sam. 18 it is a Kushite who conveys the news of Absalom's death to David. There appears to be no significance here other than to attribute a particular familial origin. The prophet Zephaniah was a descen- dant of Kushi, perhaps indicating that his father was an Ethiopian while also being a Judahite. The curse of Ham's son, Canaan, makes perfect sense given the socio-political realities during the time Hebrew Scriptures were composed. Slavery was a fact of the Ancient Near Eastern world. All of the ancient legal documents of Mesopotamia (including Ur- Nammu, Eshnunna, Hammurabi, Hittite Laws, Middle Assyrian, etc.) contain detailed rulings regarding slaves. The legal codes of the Pentateuch are no different. While preserving the shifting tides with regard to slavery policy in several passages, all of the Torah texts differentiate between Israelite and alien servility. Both Exo- dus 21 and Deuteronomy 15 make it quite clear that Hebrews could acquire other Hebrews as "slaves," though the manumission status of an Israelite was different from that of a non-Israelite as the terminology of these passages suggests (Cassuto: 265ff.). Hebrew slaves could only be indentured for six years and their release involved making them economically solvent. The policies of Leviticus 25:39-46 not only establish limits on the terms of cor- vee labor to pay off debts, but it is explicitly noted that only "aliens resident among you" may be acquired as slaves in the sense of property.15 Both the Levitical text and Deuteronomy employ as a justification of their different treatment of Hebrews the bitter expe- rience of servitude in Egypt. Jeremiah (sustaining the Deutero- nomic philosophy) makes the connection between the two Ecclesiastical Literature (New York, 1873), vol.4: 34, written under the supervision of James Strong of the Drew Theological Seminary, whose 1890 Bible Concordance was revamped as recently as 1990.

But your fathers would not obey Me or give ear" (Jeremiah 34:13b-14). Our contemporary sensitivity would have preferred to see the Israelite experience used as the basis for eliminating slave labor altogether, but such an expectation is grossly anachronistic. The double standard for slaves was part of the cultural and economic heritage, but, if Jeremiah's comments are indicative of anything, it would be that Israelites did not respect even these Israelite-related- laws very scrupulously. The Levitical author is responsible for the insertion and/or composition of many of the short etiological poems found in the early chapters of Genesis. It is therefore not surprising that the Levitical redactors who sought to clearly restrict the enslavement of Hebrews by Hebrews, would also include an ostensible justifica- tion for the (substitutive) enslavement of the neighboring populace (the Canaanites). According to one line of historical reconstruc- tion, the Hebrews were themselves Canaanites.16 We have already noted that an artificial distinction between the peoples was created by attributing them to different Noachide sons. Otherwise, on the basis of real (as opposed to political) determinants, the linguistic, territorial and social characteristics of these people were often indistinguishable. An essential premise for the Genesis 10 genealogies was reli- gion. The Torah itself makes clear that the separation from the more general Canaanite population was justified on the basis of 16The biblical narrative of Joshua presents the confrontation of the Israelites and Canaanites as one of conquerors and conquered, but the archaeological evidence makes it absolutely clear that the Canaanites were a superior people technologically and in terms of their socio-urban structures. Moreover, there is no evidence of conquests during the late Bronze Era. Consequently, many scholars, following the provocative socio-literary approach of Norman Gottwald, have concluded that the "conquest" motif is nothing other than a literary creation, while what really took place was a slow, peaceful integration of migrating populations. For a brief and accessible consideration of the different perspectives on the relationship of these two peoples, see the transcripts of a Symposium at the Smithsonian Institute, October 26, 1991, later published by Shanks, including an essay by William G. Dever and responses by Israel Finkelstein, Norman Gottwald, and Adam Zertal with accom- panying notes and bibliography. See Mazar: 329ff.

The Hebrew cult and belief system were dif- ferent, and the differences became only more pronounced as time went on. Literatures from the seventh through fifth centuries make it quite clear that assimilation was viewed as an ever pending dan- ger; xenophobia may have been a by-product. Equally important are the moral overtones which accompany the initial divisions of peoples. While the story of Noah's drunkeness may derive from a viticultural context, Ham's turpitude is sexually oriented, not alco- hol related. This theme will be emphasized in rabbinic sources as well. Given this context-and only with this context in mind-one can understand how and why the enslavement of Canaanites was written into the etiological myths of Genesis.17 Equally clear should be the fact that race-in the modern sense of the term-was not part of the biblical literary history.18 IV. RABBINIC EXEGESIS Ephraim Isaac was the first to draw attention to the source of many of the predominating misconceptions by determining that a passage in Louis Ginzberg's The Legends of the Jews (1909) has often been the source for the texts cited in subsequent studies (Isaac 1985; Ginzberg: 1,169). However, Ginzberg's passage in iso- lation does not provide all of the images which have been used by subsequent scholars.19 Using Ginzberg's narrative as evidence for anything in a scholarly study (and the same is true regarding Graves and Patai) is very dangerous. Ginzberg often conflates sources to provide an anthological narrative which reflects a sense of the variety of images in rabbinic literature. What makes Ginz- 17This is the assessment that the Bible wishes us to assume. For a more objective approach to the reality of religion in ancient Canaan, see Mark S. Smith, especially chapter 1 where he notes, "Early Israelite culture cannot be separated easily from the culture of Canaan" (1). Smith provides in his notes extensive references to the scholarly discussion of this issues. Also see Michael David Coogan; Coogan's approach is also "to consider the biblical religion as a subset of Israelite religion and Israelite religion as a subset of Canaanite religion" (115). 18This fact did not preclude later interpreters from adapting this material for their racial beliefs, as is especially clear in ante-bellum America. However, it should be kept in mind that Jews, Christians, and Muslims all had equal access to the original text materials, and as will be discussed below, ancient exegesis cannot be shown to have been an influence in later theological abuses of this material. 191n their footnote, Graves and Patai: 121 cite eight different sources which were composed over as much as a three hundred year period; nonetheless, their composite text is embraced by quotation marks giving the impression that it derives from a single quotable document.</page><page sequence="16">736 Journal of the American Academy of Religion berg's study so very important to scholars are the invaluable almost-1000-pages of detailed footnotes that provide the references for his otherwise highly popularized telling of Jewish legends. There is no single source reflecting exactly the specific matrix of images Ginzberg has created, as his own footnotes indicate. Even so, Ginzberg included in his portrayal a key phrase which is overlooked by those who have used his work (or cited it second hand). In the passage most often quoted for an elucidation of Ham's curse, Ginzberg wrote, "The descendants of Ham through Canaan," thereby avoiding any distributive "Hamitic Curse." Sometimes (as will be discussed) the rabbinic sages did use Ham metonymically with regard to all of his descendants, but I believe Ginzberg tried to indicate that such broad-stroke usages were not indicative of any particular ideological tendency. There is no reason to rehearse here just what aspect of Ginz- berg's text was adapted by various scholars (see Isaac 1985). The depiction of Ham and his descendants through all of his sons in a conflationary manner is what causes so much confusion. And for good reason: there is sufficient ambiguity in the rabbinic sources themselves. The primary passage containing many of the contro- versial images regarding Ham is found in the Tanhuma (Levy- Epstein edition, Noah 13; 29; Zondel edition: 17) and it reads as follows: ".. ..as for Ham, because he saw with his eyes the nakedness of his father, his eyes became red: and because he spoke with his mouth, his lips became crooked ['qumot] and because he turned his face the hair of his head and his beard became singed [nithdark] and because he did not cover his [father's] nakedness, he went naked and his prepuce became stretched, [all this] because all of God's retributions are commensurate to a transgression. Even though this was the case, the Holy One Blessed be He, returned20 and had mercy on him, for his mercy extends to all his creations."21 In this particular passage there is no mention of Ham becoming black, no focus on his progeny, and the parody on his appearance is quite specifically linked (exegetically) to his transgression. Tra- 20This is meant either literally or figuratively, i.e., God reconsidered the issue. 21As the text works with the classical concept of measure-for-measure, I have underlined the key words in the parallelism. See discussion below. I have cited Isaac's translation which is accurate and literal, but it does not include the last two lines which indicate the concept of "measure-for-measure"; they are my own translation.</page><page sequence="17">Aaron: Early Rabbinic Exegesis 737 ditions regarding his sin in the ark vacillate between two dominant images. The one relevant to this Tanhuma text is that he viewed his father's "nakedness," most certainly a euphemism for his geni- tals (and it may imply either homoerotica or that he saw him in the act of copulation).22 The other justification present in classical texts is that Ham himself had sexual intercourse while in the ark. It is worth noting in passing that a couple of paragraphs later in Tanhuma Noah (? 15), a brief pericope contains the argument that the curse of Canaan was deserved on the basis of Canaan's own actions, bypassing Ham's involvement altogether and thereby excluding his brothers. Like Genesis Rabbah (36 ? 2), Tanhuma identifies Ham early on as "the father of a shameful one" ('bwy dphth) (Townsend 50). The practice of elucidating the destinies of individuals accord- ing to the principle of measure-for-measure is very common in rabbinic literature (Urbach 1975:438-439).23 It has very little to do with the reality of one's biography and a great deal to do with the cleverness of the exegete in being able to fabricate a string of images. Each part of Ham's appearance is to remind us of his transgression. The first image, "red eyes," draws attention to the fact that his sin involved glancing at his father. As we lack evidence suggesting that any real human beings actually had red eyes in the ancient world, we can only assume that this ascription relates to a portrayal of his character rather than physical appearance. If noth- ing else, this aspect of the narrative (as well as others to be dis- cussed), must be seen as setting the tone for the entire passage. Why should we judge any of the other descriptions as more "racially" bound than the charge of "red eyes?" The deformation of Ham's lips (they are bent) derives from the fact that he spoke of what he saw to his brothers, who then went about covering their father's nakedness (as Genesis 9:22-23 makes clear). Ham's twisting to see (or the turning of his face) is again in contrast to the appropriate behavior exemplified by his brothers' action. As Genesis informs us (and the Midrash elucidates), they approached their sleeping father in order to drape a cloth over his 220n the widespread use of euphemism in Scripture see Fishbane 1985:66-77, with his extensive bibliography. In rabbinic literature euphemism is ubiquitous; see the entry in the Talmudic Encyclopaedia [Hebrew] under lin sgy-nhwr for examples. 23Establishing the primacy of the principle in Genesis Rabbah, see chapter 9 ? 11. For the import of this material in the early Piyyut, see Mirsky:34-42.</page><page sequence="18">738 Journal of the American Academy of Religion exposed body with their heads turned away so that they would not look upon his nakedness. In other words, while the benevolent brothers did not allow themselves to see the nakedness, the sages portray Ham as specifically having twisted to view it; hence the deformity is manifest in the twistedness of his hair and beard. I have been unable to determine why the particular term "singed" (nithdrek) is used with regard to his hair. If "kinky hair" were the purpose (as Martin's text notes above) then there are numerous other verbs which would have served much more felicitiously. At this point, I have not found another text which would elucidate this word choice. Perhaps the point is that the vision of his father itself actually "singed" him. Finally, the stretched prepuce is directly commensurate to the sin of having viewed his father's geni- tals-implied by the euphemism, "his nakedness." This particular deformation is also relevant to the motifs of the other versions of this story which group Ham with the raven and dog, all of whom are cursed by having their sexuality take on disturbed forms of behavior. The Tanhuma text, preserved in many versions, is quite difficult to date, but what we now have is most likely redacted after the eighth century (Bregman). We are simply unable to establish whether this reading was new to this edition, had significant rabbinic antecedents, or was drawn from other cultures. Two points deserve special attention: (1) "blackness" is not part of the Tanhuma exegesis, and (2) the characteristics of Ham's descend- ants, while sometimes influenced by a metonymic portrayal of Ham, are at other times-in the very same anthology-depicted quite independently.24 But let us play the role of the devil's advocate for a moment. One might argue that the Tanhuma text is simply an elucidation of earlier traditions which it inherited from Genesis Rabbah and other independent (now lost) sources. One could argue that the absence of any reference to the blackness of Ham here is insignifi- cant in that it might simply be presupposed by the author. As with the entire issue under consideration, the best we can do is speculate. The hope is that the speculation employs judgments 24The Buber Tanhuma does not contain this passage. There are, however, interesting vari- ants which concern the distinction between the enslavement of Hebrews (six years) vs. Canaanites (permanently); and nakedness is cited as a way to humiliate people who have sinned. See Tanhuma materials in Townsend:53f.</page><page sequence="19">Aaron: Early Rabbinic Exegesis 739 based on a sound understanding of the literature, its mechanics and ideological assumptions. While it is possible that the Tanhuma text "assumes" the blackness of Ham, I would maintain that it is unlikely. Consider just how much detail this passage presents. It goes well beyond any extant textual predecessor in elu- cidating the "appearance" of Ham. To assume that "blackness" would simply be presupposed and therefore not worthy of exegeti- cal elucidation does not fit into the pattern of the Yelammdenu literature in this context. I have also argued that the depiction is not essentially "racial" in the modern sense at all, but that the "red eyes" and extended prepuce convey ethical depravity and not true physiological characteristics. Had black skin allowed for a certain ethical connotation which would have derided the Israelites' neigh- bors (as appears to be the goal), then it is difficult to understand why some characteristics were only assumed and others elucidated with such detail. Finally, as I hope to show, "blackness" is not unambiguously a part of the Tanhuma's midrashic inheritance.25 A consideration of the last line of this text must figure into one's assessment of this myth's function in rabbinic literature. "Even though this was the case, the Holy One Blessed be He [i.e., God], returned and had mercy on him, for his mercy extends to all his creations." Naturally, this phrase which softens the impact of the entire Hamitic debacle, does not find its way into the quotes of those who ascribe to the Talmud the moral pretext for African slav- ery. Emulation of divine attitudes is a central value in Judaism from the Bible through to the modern day. The Tanhuma text closes this midrash with this mitigating comment, perhaps as a warning not to take its exegetical gymnastics too seriously after all. In the entirety of the Babylonian Talmud there is but one refer- ence to a myth which cites a sin of Ham and a resulting punish- ment manifest in his skin. (To place this in context for the non- expert; the standard English translation of the Talmud (Soncino Edition) is seventeen volumes, with the average volume approxi- mately 800 pages in length.) In Tractate Sanhedrin 108b we read: "Three copulated while in the ark, and they were punished-the 25Buber Tanhuma 2.21 (Townsend:53) stipulates why Ham cannot be cursed. "Ham looked; is Canaan cursed? R. Judah said: The curse does not coexist with a blessing. Ham could not be cursed because it is stated (in Gen. 9:1) then God blessed Noah and his children. R. Nehemiah said: Canaan had looked and told his father; so the curse had returned to its source. For that reason it is stated, Cursed be Canaan." Note the distortion of the biblical text to avoid the contradiction regarding blessings and curses.</page><page sequence="20">740 Journal of the American Academy of Religion dog, the raven and Ham." The copulation is not with one another, but with their own species; nonetheless, it was taken as inappropri- ate, for during a time of destruction (they are all in the ark during the flood), the posture of mourning was to be assumed by every living being-or so the Talmud argues.26 The sages used the ark- narrative to provide an etiological legend regarding the way (or the imagined way) crows and dogs copulate. The raven is thought to inseminate its females orally, and dogs are linked together for extended periods of time during copulation. Ham's punishment is related as follows: "Ham was smitten in his skin" [laqah b'or]. The meaning is ambiguous. The medieval commentator Rashi (1040- 1105) whose Talmud and Bible commentaries have been the stan- dard fare of European Jewish education since the thirteenth cen- tury, explained this Talmudic idiom in his commentary (ad loc) to mean "that Kush descended from him." We can safely assume that Rashi understood this to imply that Kush became black despite the whiteness of his father. In his Bible commentary to Gen. 9:25f., Rashi understands the curse of Ham as the exile of Sennacherib noted in Isaiah 20:4 (see below); despite the lack of an explicit mention of blackness, the reference to the Nubians should be understood as connoting black-Africans from the Upper Nile. The similarities between Rashi's reference to the Nubians and Benjamin of Tudela's comments (noted above) may indicate that specifically the Nubians had a certain stigma; but more research is required to draw this conclusively. Though it is reasonable to understand "smitten in his skin" as implying blackness, it is also reasonable to read the word "skin" as yet another idiom for his genitalia (Eilberg-Schwartz: 85f.). Here too measure-for-measure is the underlying principle of retribution. Just as Ham's indiscretion related to his father's genitals, so is his punishment manifest in his reproductive organs. This interpreta- tion fits especially well in the midrashic context which pairs Ham with two other sexual offenders (the crow and the dog); since their penalties related directly to their reproductive practices, why shouldn't Ham's be the same? The condemnation of Ham and his descendants with regard to their sexual practices is a theme with many sub-motifs. We must keep in mind that the Torah repeatedly 26During a time of mourning, sexual intercourse is forbidden in rabbinic Judaism. Tanhuma gives this reason, Noah ? 13, as well as other sources. Also, Genesis Rabbah itself, 31 ? 12 (Theodor-Albeck: I:286.5f.)</page><page sequence="21">Aaron: Early Rabbinic Exegesis 741 identifies "the otherness" of Canaanites, Moabites and other local peoples, by referring to their sexual abominations. The offenses will include whoring, intercourse while in states of impurity and incest (Fishbane 1985:119f.). Since assimilation (i.e., intermar- riage) with Canaanites and other indigenous groups provides a great challenge to the religious establishment of both biblical and rabbinic times, the extension of Ham's sexual abominations to his son Canaan must be understood in part as a strategy against the breakdown of endogomy. In the Jerusalem Talmud27 we read that "he [Ham] exited [the ark] charcoal colored" [yasa' mfuham]. This reading is partially reflected in Midrash Genesis Rabbah with a significant variation, (a text edited around the same time as the Jerusalem Talmud in Roman Palestine circa 400 B.C.E.). The principle by which Ham's punishment involves becoming dark is again the classical midah kneged midah, "measure-for-measure." Genesis Rabbah 36 ? 7 (Theodor-Albeck edition, 341 ? 5) reads: "R. Huna in the name of R. Yosef said: You [Ham] prevented me [Noah] from doing that which is done in the dark [i.e., coitus]; accordingly, your seed will be ugly and dark." It is important to note that this passage in Genesis Rabbah is but one of five different interpretations offered in a string of exe- getical alternatives; a typical literary construct for Genesis Rabbah. No one interpretation is given preference.28 The sages do create here a punishment explicitly for Ham which will include his off- spring. The practice of extending either blessing or curse to the offspring of a patriarch is a common method of praising or con- demning a people in both Hebrew Scriptures and rabbinic litera- ture. Whether the offspring are viewed in a positive rather than negative light has little to do with any particular behavior of the patriarch, but a great deal to do with the socio-political context in which the exegesis of the behavior is composed. Take for example 27See Taaniyot, 1,4,4; Vilna-type versions, Ta'anit, ch.I, Halakha 6, p.7a. 28The English rendition of Freedman:I,293, is hardly decipherable due to the degree of word play. The other explanations which appear in this passage which will not be discussed at length here are as follows: (1) Ham cannot be cursed because this would contradict a blessing already rendered upon Noah's sons in Gn 9:1; therefore the curse is delayed to affect the son Canaan. (2) Ham's act prevents Noah from fathering another son who would service him; consequently, Canaan, Ham's son, is forced to serve in that role. (3) Similar to #2, but a play on numbers, by stating that Ham's act prevented him from having a fourth son; consequently, it is Ham's fourth son who is cursed.</page><page sequence="22">742 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Lot's impregnation of his daughters while in a drunken stupor (Gen. 19:30-38). Incest is a taboo in all biblical contexts. Yet in Genesis Rabbah there is actually something of a debate as to whether the original conception of Moab (the offspring from Lot's older daughter) was brought about in a spirit of immorality or with a noble motive.29 There can be no doubt that ambivalence regard- ing this otherwise blatantly proscribed act of incest derives from the fact that Ruth is a Moabite, ancestor of King David and by extension, progenitor of the king-messiah. For the sake of Ruth's name, Lot's daughter's injudicious sexual act is justified. In other words, what is morally and legally unconscionable in the social domain can be legitimized in the realm of midrash if the induce- ment is pressing enough.30 Of course, the opposite is also true: an otherwise neutral act may be condemned as an abomination in the light of certain fetishes. What then, can be said of the characters Ham, Shem, and Japheth? Genesis Rabbah itself (36 ? 6) speaks of Shem's and Japheth's rewards as being manifest in their descendants' lives. Ham's punishment in Genesis Rabbah 36 ? 6 is described by means of the verse in Isaiah 20:[3]-4 which may also serve as a conceptual underpinning for the Tanhuma exegesis cited above: Just as my servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot for three years so shall the king of Assyria drive off the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Nubia, young and old, naked and barefoot and with bared buttocks-to the shame of Egypt. The verse is a highly charged polit- ical vision regarding the future. The original meaning of the verse is less important for our discussion than the midrashic utilization. Here the "captives of Egypt and the exiles of Nubia" are indicative of Ham's progeny. The expression "naked and barefoot and with bared buttocks" is for Isaiah and the rabbis an idiom of extreme humiliation. Clearly the exegetical link between this verse and that of the Noah narrative is the exposure of Ham's father, on the one hand, and the nakedness of the captives, on the other. 29Perhaps this story and that of Noah's drunkenness derive from a viticultural source whose original purposes have been lost. Neither Noah, Ham, nor the Moabites and Ammo- nites are condemned because of any specific sin related to alcohol, though the Moabites will be condemned for their seduction of Israelites at Shittim (Nu. 25:1). See bSan 70a-b for a consideration of the role of wine. Also see Eilberg-Schwartz :81-109 for numerous consider- ations of the Lot and Ham narratives as well as the role of wine. 301n contrast, Lot's younger daughter produces the Ammonites, in whom little is at stake. See Deut. 23:4 where the Moabites and Ammonites are both forbidden from the Temple; and Zeph. 2:8 where the two are also paired, perhaps as a hendiadys.</page><page sequence="23">Aaron: Early Rabbinic Exegesis 743 The crucial issues with respect to the Genesis Rabbah text are as follows: What would have caused the sages to choose this par- ticular exegesis on Ham? Is the ugliness and darkness to affect all of Ham's offspring?31 And if servitude is understood as implicit with regard to all of the children as well, should we view this text as a significant source for the religious-ideological justification of African slavery? A surface reading of the text yields a simple affirmative answer to the question of Ham's offspring. The sages are fully aware of the strange aspect of the text that has Ham look but Canaan cursed. In order to distribute the sin beyond the sons of Canaan so as to include his brothers' progeny as well, the rabbis establish the sin of Ham's copulation in the ark.32 As such, retribution for Ham's sin would be distributed to all his offspring, and along with it, his tur- pitude. Some midrashic material on the Noah episode is generally condemnatory of the heathen nations for which Ham becomes a metonym (see especially Tanhuma Buber 2 ? 19). This is the tail end of the Noah narrative whose central purpose was to tell of the destruction of the immoral world as it had come to be. The fact is that Noah's descendants are not to survive with impunity should they perpetuate what God originally sought to wipe off the face of the earth. This, then, would serve as a motivation for this particu- lar exegesis; it is past rather than future oriented. How much ideology is conveyed in this midrash? Rabbinic literature often makes sweeping or hyperbolic statements regard- ing all sorts of events and conditions. There can be no doubt that 31Bernard Lewis suggests that St. Ephrem, the Syrian Church Father, may be the earliest source expressing the notion that both Canaan and Ham became black (124). There he juxtaposes St. Ephrem, who died in 373 C.E., with the Genesis Rabbah text under considera- tion; according to Lewis "the anonymous Bereshit (Genesis) Rabbah was probably complied in the sixth century A.D., with later accretions of which this may be one." This would make St. Ephrem a potential source for the Genesis Rabbah passage. The problems are manifold. First of all, the dating of Genesis Rabbah is quite uncertain. Some scholars date it as early as the end of the fourth century; others, like Lewis, believe it is later. Until some new source comes to light, the issue will never be resolved. While it is possible that the sages drew this from an external source, I have tried to deal with the text internally. I believe there are enough exegetical clues to show that it stands on its own, though we cannot say specifically why this passage is as inclusive as it is. My sense is that GnR is earlier rather than later, which also makes the St. Ephrem evidence of lesser significance, except to say that Chris- tians may have employed the same or similar myths. 321 say "establish" rather than "concoct," because they undoubtedly recognized the term "nakedness" as a euphemism indicative of a some sexual indiscretion beyond "seeing." Howard Eilberg-Schwartz has suggested that the episode relates to a homoerotic event (81ff.).</page><page sequence="24">744 Journal of the American Academy of Religion the "effect" is more important than the actual content. If one accepts the umbrella statement about Ham's offspring as indicative of historical fact or social ideology, then all of Ham's sons, includ- ing his fourth son who is destined to servitude, would also be des- tined to ugliness and darkness. The problem with this reading can be summarized as follows: We know for a fact that the dominant rabbinic tradition does not portray the Canaanites and the Egyp- tians as dark skinned;33 in contrast, the Nubians or Ethiopians (midrash does not necessarily make a distinction) are consistently depicted this way with no specific racial or negative connotations. (See Isaac 1985:80f.) In addition, neither the Nubians nor the Ethi- opians, or for that matter, the Egyptians (all portrayed as descend- ants of Ham) are portrayed in an historical sense as "slaves" (indeed, the Egyptians are masters in the Moses narrative). Why then, would a sage make so grand a claim, knowingly contradicting the dominant character depictions and genealogies? Ideological consistency with regard to Ham's sons, or any other issue for that matter, was never the problem of the midrashic writ- ers. This is the reality of the midrashic imagination, and any attempt to ignore this fact results in the promotion of grave mis- conceptions. The sages delighted in exegetical intricacy, they sought meaning by creating meaning, but they did not endeavor to write pragmatic theology, history, or scientific etiology. Hence, our attempt to work through the philological intricacies when exploring this question is fundamentally moot, in that the sages themselves would never have been bothered by the apparent the- matic "inconsistency" at the macro level. To make this fact evident, however, it is necessary to expose the intricate exegesis that is at the base of these midrashic passages (at the micro level) and to emphasize that the exegetical exercise was the key to the text's composition, not the promotion of a particular ideology.34 When it comes to midrash, "surface readings" never constitute good read- ings. Indeed, Ockham's razor does not obtain here, for midrash by its nature requires a complex decoding process for meaning to emerge. It is at once interpretation and requiring of interpretation. 33By "dominant" I simply mean that tradition which numerically appears most often in literary texts. 340ne would not make this claim about every midrashic passage across the board, but much of Genesis Rabbah appears to conform to this pattern. There are, however, many ideological polemics in the text. See Neusner 1983: Chapter 5, and 1986.</page><page sequence="25">Aaron: Early Rabbinic Exegesis 745 Let us entertain two reasons why the Genesis Rabbah expres- sion "ugly and darkened" has a role in this literature. While recog- nizing the danger of sounding apologetic, I contend that black skin in a racial sense is not the issue here, but rather, the coining of a derogatory appellative to connote humiliation in a hyperbolic man- ner. No doubt, the entire idiom only works because "black" and "darkness" are seen as negatives (ethical and otherwise) in contrast to "white" and "light." The question relates to how such images are used. First let us establish why this idiom may have been so desir- able; then we will speculate as to its connotation. Noting that the classical rhetoric of "measure-for-measure" is employed, we can appreciate that the term used for Ham's dark- ness, mfuhadm is parallel to 'felh-the term used to describe the absence of light when the sin occurs.35 But why this particular word-mfuh4m-for "black," a most unusual term.36 Essential to this word choice is the paranomasia that can only be appreciated in the Hebrew. It would have been quite easy to call the darkened Ham adhor, the colloquial word for "black," as the shepherd girl of Song of Songs is identified, "I am black, but beautiful."37 However, the alliteration of the final syllable of mfuh.am with the very name of the disgraced and punished Ham (i.e., ham) is what draws exe- getes to employ this verbal form to indicate "color." The root itself is related to the noun connoting charcoal. Because Ham's sin took place in the dark, he became dark (measure-for-measure). This method of paranomasia (a nomen-omen, or ein sprechender Name), is commonly used in classical Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, and Latin literatures. It is noteworthy that a midrash using "ugly and black," where the word for "black" is the conventional color-term, occurs later in 35The root of mfuham is phm, but I am providing the phonetic representation with "f" to make pronunciation accurate. 36The term f lah specifically means the absence of light, and is never descriptive of a color. In contrast, mpwhm is a passive participle which is not regularly a "color" either. 37Song of Songs 1:6. See both Isaac and Lewis on this passage where some of the history of exegesis is reviewed. There is absolutely no doubt that the Hebrew w in this verse, which can serve as either a disjunctive or conjunctive particle, is serving as the former, "but." The girl first says, "Don't look at me because I am swarthy, for the sun has burned me. .. ." The point being that her unusually dark complexion, which is the result of her brother's mean trick in isolating her out in the vineyard, has caused her to become extremely dark. This does not diminish her beauty. The Targum actually uses the Kushites in the allegorical interpretation: "When the House of Israel made the calf, their faces turned black as the Kushites who dwell in the tents of Kedar."</page><page sequence="26">746 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Genesis Rabbah. In the infamous story of Abram's descent to Egypt (Genesis 12), Sarai is asked to lie by saying that she is Abram's sister and not his wife. Without going into the complex exegetical issues, it suffices to say that Abram must justify his bizarre request. It is the extremeness of Sarai's beauty that causes Abram to fear his wellbeing. Here is the biblical text and then the midrashic comment: Genesis 12:11-13: As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, "Behold what a beautiful woman you are. If the Egyp- tians see you, and think, 'She is his wife,' they will kill me and let you live. Please say that you are my sister that it may go well with me because of you. .. " Genesis Rabbah: 40 ? 4: She was with him all these years, yet now he says to her, Behold what a beautiful woman you are. The reason however, is because travelling takes a toll of one's beauty [but Sarai retained hers]. [. ..] [Abraham said:] We have traversed Aram Naharaim and Aram Nahor and not found a woman as beautiful as you; now that we are entering a country whose inhabitants are ugly and black, please say you are my sister. (Gen. 12:13). As noted, the Hebrew for "ugly and black," (khwrym wthiwrym)38 employs only the most expected lexical entries. The phrase is clearly hyperbolic, contrasting Sarai's beauty with the appearance of the local population, the Egyptians, in an extreme way. I sup- pose one might then argue that the Egyptians-according to this text-were blacks. It would be an abuse of the evidence. The judg- ment being rendered here is a relative one. The Egyptians are darker than Sarai, who somehow has retained her light-skinned- beauty despite the long journey in the sun-baked desert. The lan- guage "ugly and black" is derogatory; it is not racial. It involves cultural aesthetic judgements, just as to this very day some cultures judge light skin or dark skin within the same race to be a character- istic of beauty; apparently, so it was in ancient times. The exegeti- cal motivations behind the use of mfuham ("darkened") regarding Ham (GnR 36 ? 7) are accentuated when contrasted with the more expected idiom wielded by Abram in Genesis Rabbah 40 ? 4. 38The T-A version based on MS London actually has the mispelling k'wrym; indeed, in most of the manuscripts, this defective orthography occurs.</page><page sequence="27">Aaron: Early Rabbinic Exegesis 747 Yet another passage in Genesis Rabbah involves usage of a simi- lar idiom, once again suggesting that the issue here is perceived beauty and not race. In Genesis Rabbah 18 ? 5 the verb used to describe the Israelite women who became unattractive to their hus- bands during the time of Nehemiah is based on the same root used to judge Ham swarthy: "When Nehemiah left the Exile, the faces of the [Israelite] women were darkened by the sun (ntphmw) and [their husbands] left them and went and married foreign women" (Theo- dor and Albeck: 167.4). It should be obvious that in this passage "darkened" was not an additional genetic or racial trait, but rather it conveyed "disgraced" by means of an altered, unattractive appearance (even this may be meant symbolically). In the case of Sarai and the Israelite wives, the judgments are relative: darkness of skin is contrasted with lightness of skin-the latter being the desirable trait of beauty. Adding support to this non-racial connotation of the idiom is the very passage which comes immediately after this questionable phrase in Genesis Rabbah 36 ? 7 (the last of this string of five interpretations). It reads as follows: "...Ham came forth [from the ark] mfuhdm, while the dog publicly exposes its copulation. R. Levi said: This may be compared to one who minted his own coin- age [bearing his own effigy] in the very palace of the king, where- upon the king ordered: I decree that his effigy [or: his face] be defaced (ytphmw) so that his coins be invalid. Similarly, Ham and the dog copulated in the Ark and were punished."39 I would argue that the contiguous usages of the root plhm in these two passages is not coincidental; nor are their semantic fields unrelated. In the second passage the most felicitous rendering of the word yitpahamu [ytphmw] is not "blackened." The whole point is that the effigy on the coin is defaced, struck in a way as to degrade the person represented in public.40 This would suggest 39Brackman includes a version of this passage in his dissertation (81), not taking it from the original but rather Samuel Rapaport's A Treasury of the Midrash (New York, 1968). Con- trast his highly problematic rendering with my own as yet another example of how danger- ous it is to rely upon translations for the understanding of a rabbinic passages: "Just as when a man has the audacity to coin the king's currency in the king's own palace, his face is blackened as a punishment and his issue declared counterfeit." 40This is the interpretation put forth by Theodor, ad loc, for the parallelism here is between the dog's public humiliation and the man's public humiliation. However the grammar allows for an alternative, namely, that the act of "defacing" actually took place to the man's face, making him unrecognizable or humiliated. I am grateful to the JAAR reader who reminded me that the minting-of-a-coin motif is sometimes used as indicative of man having</page><page sequence="28">748 Journal of the American Academy of Religion that the color of the face is not nearly as significant as the symbolic defacement which is Ham's punishment for a sin considered unforgivable (cf. Leviticus 18:6ff.). Again, exactly how this might transfer to Ham's children remains a mystery considering their common depiction in rabbinic literature, but, if we understand the verb in question to connote the "defacement of character," then this highly charged depiction of the depraved nations who derived from Ham's sons is more easily understood. This interpretation does not soften the harshness of the ethno- centric and xenophobic attitude expressed by this passage. On the contrary, I am fully acknowledging the cultural prejudices that are implied. However, in trying to establish an accurate appraisal of the midrash, we must avoid extracting a modern day "racism" toward blacks out of a more or less typical, indeed stereotypical, depiction of foreigners who were perceived as hostile. In assessing the impact of these isolated passages, we have not established any evidence for centuries of a Jewish Hamitic myth, for the existence of such a "myth" can only be derived from sources subsequent to the midrash that would reflect this early exegesis. Indeed, what should impress the reader with regard to the ancient material is the relative paucity of sources reflecting this motif and their rather impoverished development. One need only consider rabbinic liter- ature's consistent and invidious condemnation of Esau-early Juda- ism's code word for Rome and/or Christianity, depending upon the period-to realize how a social conviction found articulation in the exegetical condemnation of a patriarch. In other words, when the sages wished to launch an ideological diatribe into the main- stream of Jewish literary circles, they managed to do so with con- siderable success. Esau is but one example; the Amalakites, the quasi-heretical character of Elisha ben Avuyah (referred to by the alienating appellation, "the other one"), the Samaritans, mystics, gnostics, and sectarians, to just name some others, are all people or groups, about whom rabbinic literature fabricated highly charged polemical material. If there existed a functioning "Hamitic Myth" regarding blacks and slavery, then it is reasonable to expect its literary structures to have been similar to these other cultural antipathies. The fact of the matter is, no such evidence moves us in this direction. been created in God's image; hence, the defacing of the coin would convey the notion that Ham has his appearance and relationship to God's image altered.</page><page sequence="29">Aaron: Early Rabbinic Exegesis 749 In summary, the earliest rabbinic material (Genesis Rabbah and the Jerusalem Talmud) was more concerned with providing a rhetorical creation that cashed in on the paranomasia derived from Ham's name than it was set on establishing the blackness of his skin or that of his descendants in a racial sense. The focus was on the past to explain the present; on creating a link between the depraved antediluvian world and the turpitudes of the postdiluvian descendants of Noah. Had the sages wanted Ham and all of his descendants to be black and slaves-not just Canaan, the son con- demned to slavery-then we may speculate that the idea would have been more prominently distributed in the corpus. But the relevant passages are few in number, and those reviewed here are complex exegetical exercises. V. CONCLUDING COMMENTS ON THE USE OF RABBINIC LITERATURE IN WRITING HISTORY We must return to the question of how any of this material should be integrated into one's attempt to portray the history of ideas. For the moment, let's push aside the nuances and read the passages simply for their surface meanings. As we noted earlier in this essay, it would remain legitimate to ask: What is to be made of the fact that one passage implies that all of Ham's sons were "black," and that numerous others imply that only his son Kush was black? One who studies this literature becomes aware early on that no midrashic document attempts to establish the answer or the policy with regard to any particular issue; no midrashic document portrays the belief of Jews with regard to any particular concept.41 (The words "doctrine" and "theology" are absent from classical 41Lest this charge remain too abstract, I would like to provide another simple example of how easily one could use a talmudic comment as paradigmatic of dominant Jewish belief at any given point in history, thereby producing an absurd depiction of that history. Consider the implications for the unaware historian of Rabbi Eleazar's proclamation recorded in the Talmud that "since the destruction of the Temple [in 70 C.E.], the gates of prayer have been locked." This statement was meant to imply that without the Temple there was no longer any purpose in prayer since the conduit to God had been destroyed (Bab. Baba Metzia 59a). Taking this as a "Jewish belief" would lead one to write that prayer, since the destruction of the Temple, is simply not efficacious according to rabbinic doctrine-a belief which could not be further from what contrary evidence overwhelmingly shows to have been otherwise. Examples of this sort can be multiplied thousands of times over. What any particular state- ment in the Talmud has to do with what people actually believed is an extremely sensitive issue.</page><page sequence="30">750 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Hebrew and Aramaic.) The fact of the matter is that the five passages in this Genesis Rabbah string of interpretations represent the exegetical games played by those who were the most talented with the hermeneutics of their day; none of them was bent on establishing a racial policy or justifying a slavery policy (the latter only coming into existence centuries after the rise of Islam). No doubt, sometimes midrashic ideas reflect dominant social conven- tions, but in this case, we have no way of measuring the promi- nence or function of this imagery in colloquial contexts. The issue of colloquial prominence is especially problematic. Scholars frequently debate the extent of formal rabbinic literature's influence on the religion and thought of any given era in Jewish history. The fact that long passages of the Babylonian Talmud con- cern rituals (especially Temple related) and judicial practices which had not been in effect for centuries, should, if nothing else, cast grave doubts as to this literature's relevance to daily Jewish life. Most scholars tacitly agree that the Midrashim and Talmudim were the domain of a very concentrated scholarly class throughout Jewish history. Moreover, ideology is hardly derivable from rabbinic literature, except when it comes, perhaps, to hermeneu- tics; indeed, even theology is oblique. The problem remains for the historian to determine how much of the actual content of rabbinic literature was actually transferred into the common vocabulary and thinking of Jews, and how much influence was ultimately reduced to general impressions with little substantive content. Before using rabbinic texts to reconstruct history, a scholar must be aware of the ongoing debate as to just what it is that mid- rash does and why it insists on recording multiple opinions on every issue usually without resolution. Steven D. Fraade puts it this way: Anyone who approaches ancient rabbinic texts with the intention of using them to reconstruct some aspect of ancient Jewish history, society or practice must confront the challenges posed by their deeply rhetorical nature. The literature of the rabbis is not so much one which simply seeks to represent the world outside it; it ultimately seeks to transform that world by the force of an illocu- tionary world, or web, of representations, both halakhic [legal] and aggadic [non-legal interpretive], into which it dialogically and, hence, transformatively, draws its society of students in the very process of creating and conveying its meanings. By no means do I wish to deny the possibilities of using rabbinic literature for the</page><page sequence="31">Aaron: Early Rabbinic Exegesis 751 purposes of historical reconstruction, but to caution that such uses are fraught with great difficulty. (Fraade 1992:253) Underlying this whole issue of how much influence rabbinic literature had on Jews is the fact that the literature is fundamen- tally incomprehensible to other than the specialist, and even among specialists, there is considerable controversy as to how it should be to read.42 The strangeness of the literary mode compli- cates exponentially our assessment of rabbinic literature's impact outside of the Jewish community. Consider the evidence regarding Christian uses of and attitudes toward the Talmud (Funkenstein 1968, 1971; Jeremy Cohen). Merchavia notes that no direct citation of rabbinic literature among non-Jews can be found before the twelfth century; the word "Talmud" is never even mentioned in any source prior to this period (93). The Christian diatribe against Judaism concentrated on demonstrating how Scripture justifies the replacement of the Old Israel with the New Israel. For this purpose rabbinic materials remained largely irrelevant until the twelfth cen- tury.43 It was only then that post-biblical materials enter into the anti-Jewish polemic, but in a most limited fashion (Funkenstein 1968, 1971; Jeremy Cohen Ch.1 and 75f.). The socio-political con- text sought employment of these sources in discounting Judaism (especially its supposed "legalism") or in contrasting Jewish ideas with Christian ones. Rare instances of exegetical borrowings do exist, but Christians did not look to the Talmud or the Midrash for ideological justification.44 Indeed, the Church depicted the rabbinic literature of its day as "a pernicious oral tradition of reli- gious law and doctrine, a gross deviation from the religion of the Old Testament. The Talmud not only.. .held 'the Jews obstinate in their perfidy' but also, with the equation of the talmudic goy and the medieval Christain, proffered a real threat to Latin Christen- dom" (Jeremy Cohen 76). Perhaps more important is the point that the Church did not need the Talmud to distort any biblical 42For a number of approaches to the essence of midrash, see the recent articles in Fishbane 1993, by I. Gruenwald, D. Halivni, M. Idel and D. Stern. Gruenwald rightly refers to mid- rash as a cognitive mode. 43There are some exceptions. See Kimelman and previous scholarship on Origen's knowl- edge of Rabbinic exegesis. 440n the emergence of Christian Hebraists, see Moore 1921, and Katchen and his extensive bibliography. Most of the "borrowings" came through familiarity with philosophical or kab- balistic sources, not the Talmud directly.</page><page sequence="32">752 Journal of the American Academy of Religion passage in the service of a social or political gain; it had its own history of exegesis and a distinct hermeneutic. We conclude that the existence of a Hamitic Myth within Juda- ism has yet to be verified. The first task will be to establish just how the relevant rabbinic texts might have functioned as an ideo- logical building block within Jewish communities. (Of course, this task is not specific to the issue at hand.) More importantly, even if the textual foundations for such a myth had existed in the Talmud and Midrash as McKenzie, Willis, Sanders, Martin and others hypothesize, scholars must be obligated to provide solid documen- tation to indicate that these texts had influence on the development of Christian (European) and Islamic (Asian) thought before citing them as having provided the foundational building blocks of Europe's African slave trade. At the present time, no such docu- mentation exists demonstrating a Christian or Islamic awareness of the Jewish exegesis on the Curse of Ham/Canaan. The infinitesi- mal impact Jews had on the slave trade alone-never mind its ideo- logical underpinnings-should cause us to approach any thought of the Talmud as a significant player in the justification of the medie- val and early modern slave markets as a travesty. More impor- tantly, (as noted) there is enough of a textual handle in Genesis itself to make the Talmud irrelevant to the justification of black servitude. That is to say, Christians who claimed the Old Testa- ment as their own, were not in need of midrashic parables on the descendants of Noah to find a theological justification for slavery. Perhaps a newly discovered source will arise from the Cairo Geniza or some other realm that will shed new light on the subject. In the meantime, the function of the so-called "Hamitic Myth" in the consciousness of Jews is unknown. Perhaps all we have to go on is the infrequency of its occurrence in the literature as a whole. Assuming that the rate of repetition in the literature is indicative of some measure of popularity, we would have to rate this motif as hardly known beyond the innerrabbinic circles. Of course, fre- quency in the official literature should not be used to quantify pop- ularity in folk culture; unfortunately, for the most part, folk culture did not leave us with documents chronicling its themes. The complete history of exegesis on Genesis 9-10 regarding Noah's son Ham in rabbinic, Christian, and Islamic sources remains to be written. An assessment of how formal exegesis influ- enced social thought and policy throughout the ages will be yet another project. In the meantime, the use of this motif will</page><page sequence="33">Aaron: Early Rabbinic Exegesis 753 undoubtedly appear in print in a manner that preserves the inertia of the misconceptions with respect to its Talmudic permutations. Since George Foot Moore's repeated proscriptions (1927-30) against using individual passages in rabbinic literature as indica- tive of Jewish belief more generally, the study of the Midrashim and Talmudim has developed immensely. This does not mean that Moore's message or its spirit has consistently been heeded. In order to avoid the implications of Moore's warnings, many masters of rabbinic literature have woven together webs of rabbinic per- icopae, thereby fabricating systems of thought that have no resem- blance to any reality whose existence can be objectively confirmed.45 The translation of rabbinic literature-including most of the classical Midrashim and the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmudim-has only served to invite non-expert scholarly dis- course to be inclusive of rabbinic texts. Yet no translation to date can bring a reader close to the meaning of a truly complex exegeti- cal passage; indeed, even those who work in this field are often unable to make sense of translated passages without having seen originals (or without reconstructing them in their minds). Richard Sarason has argued that the rabbinic materials were composed exclusively for a rabbinic audience; hence, their Sitz im Leben should preclude the popularization of their ideas (68). Tak- ing up a theme which Jacob Neusner has long urged, Sarason writes: "What seems to me to be an urgent disideratum is a fresh detailed exegesis of the texts themselves, document by document, which would ask basic questions of the literature with proper attention to nuance and specific literary context as well as to larger, generic literary and conceptual traits." Once this exegetical exer- cise has been engaged, then the more global issues may be raised: "What sort of world view is expressed, or presupposed, by the con- ceptions put forth in the texts, and through their distinctive modes of formulation? (I.e., What is the literary and cognitive relation- ship between what is said and how it is said?) What does the text tell us about its intended audience? What sorts of conceptual traits and prior ideas and concerns does it take for granted on the part of the audience? Who would understand these texts? What can we learn about the conception and valorization of Scripture on the 45Perhaps most prominent of these "theologies" (in terms of size) are those written by Ephraim Urbach 1975 and Arthur Marmorstein 1920, 1927, 1929, 1937.</page><page sequence="34">754 Journal of the American Academy of Religion part of the framers of these texts from the detailed operations per- formed therein on scriptural passages?" Currently, a detailed exegesis of the massive corpus of rabbinic writings does not exist, nor will one appear any time soon. As the case under consideration has shown, the misconstrual of rabbinic materials can lead to unwieldy misconceptions about the nature and purpose of rabbinic dicta. Though it will not often be the case, such misconceptions can lend themselves to nefarious formula- tions in the ideologically charged marketplace of ideas, a market- place in which the loudest, most provocative voices often earn high dividends on the basis of their aggression rather than their accuracy.
