<plain_text><page sequence="1">FREDERICK M. RENER Friedrich Spee's "Arcadia" Revisited IN JOSEPH von Eichendorff's Geschichte der poetischen Literatur Deutschlands (1857) we can read the following statement: "Kein Dichter hat wohl so innig ... die verborgenen Stimmen der Natur belauscht und verstanden: wie die Strome und Walder und Bachlein emsig Gottes Lob rauschen und die Vogel von Ihm singen und die geheimnisvolle Nacht von Ihm traumt."' Amazingly enough, this characteriza- tion describes not a nineteenth-century Roman- tic but an early seventeenth-century poet, Fried- rich Spee von Langenfeld (1595-1635). Stress on Spee's intimate and personal knowledge of na- ture, far from being Eichendorff's monopoly, has since become the outstanding feature not only in general works on the history of literature but also in those devoted specifically to Spee, or in studies on descriptions of nature. Except for a progressive intensification of Eichendorff's opinion, no new development has taken place in the last hundred years.2 Recent studies of Spee and most comprehensive ones de- pict him as an "ausgesprochener Naturfreund" and the first German poet, "der die Natur so erlebte und darstellte." He is said to perceive "im gottlichen Kosmos der Natur mit Tranen der Ruhrung jede kleinste Existenz, jede kleinste Regung" and to have the ability "aufmerksam Beobachtetes bis ins Kleinste aufzuwerten."3 His landscape stands out for its greater "Wirklich- keitsfreude und Naturverbundenheit" as com- pared not only to the rest of the seventeenth cen- tury but even to that of Angelus Silesius, his closest peer. In this harmonious chorus there is one clearly perceptible dissonant voice, Ilse Martens' study devoted exclusively to Spee's description of na- ture, indicating that his landscape contains far too many enumerations and allegories for it to qualify as erlebte Natur.4 Yet at the end of the study the author unexpectedly joins in the final amen: Spee does indeed see with his own eyes and hear with his own ears. Such inconsistencies are found also in Gunther Muiller, for instance, where in the chapter devoted to Spee a caption line "Barock nicht Romantik" is preceded, a few pages earlier, by this statement: "Mit einer fur die Zeit unge- wohnlichen Aufgeschlossenheit wird der Zauber der Landschaft, der Tages- und Jahreszeit erlebt und verwortet [sic]. Die Natureingange schwellen von atmospharischer Lebendigkeit."5 Moreover, there is the recent trend to enlist Spee among the Schiferdichter (hence the label "Arcadia" at- tached to his landscape) while still upholding the old notion of Naturverbundenheit without realiz- ing that an ideal landscape, which Arcadia cer- tainly is, can neither be experienced nor be real- istically portrayed.6 My decision to revisit Spee's favorite country- side was prompted partly by such inconsistencies which are indicative of a blurred vision on the part of my predecessors, but to a large extent also by my conviction that Spee's presumed realism is highly unlikely in the early seventeenth century. In order to proceed in an orderly fashion this study will examine three groups of poems in Spee's Trutznachtigall, one of which is characterized by a common content (praises to God, or laudes) and another by a common form (eclogues). The third one, on the other hand, consists of a mixture of poems of various nature (Gesponl or Sponsa poems, BuRlieder, Trostlieder), too few to form an independent group. I shall follow Spee's order: (1) mixed section, (2) laudes, and (3) eclogues. Incidentally, this division is tailored for the pur- pose of this study and is not intended to be an incursion into the debate about the structural details of Spee's work.7 In the first section there are poems beginning with a description of nature, for which German critics have coined the term Natureingang. Here are two samples quoted in their entirety: Die voglein schon erklingen / Die Sonn sich stralet auff / Die kuhle brunlein springen / Die bachlein seind im lauff. 967</page><page sequence="2">9Friedrich Spee's "Arcadia" Revisited Die blumlein zart erspriessen / Zur Erden kriechens au3 / Laub / graB3 / herfur auch schiessen / Die pflantzlein werden kraui3.8 (p. 96, 11. 5-12) In grunem waldt ich newlich saI3 / Gen einer steinen Klausen; Da kam durch zartes laub vnd graB3 / Ein sanfftes windlein sausen. Ein briunlein klar / Bey seiten war / So frisch / vnd frolich spritzet Ein Bachlein rein Auch eben fein Von holem Felsen schwitzet. (p. 10,11.4-13) These two passages show not only the schematic enumeration of natural events, mentioned by Martens-in some cases at the rate of one per line-but also a similarity of settings which is sur- prising in a presumably realistic poet. Further- more, if the elements of both passages are com- bined (birds, forest, brook, fountain, breeze, flowers) a pattern results that fits E. R. Curtius' description of the topos locus amoenus: "Sein Minimum an Ausstattung besteht aus einem Baum (oder mehreren Baumen), einer Wiese und einem Quell oder Bach. Hinzutreten konnen Vogelge- sang und Blumen. Die reichste Ausstattung fuigt noch Windhauch dazu."9 In classical antiquity, the topos was designed not as an end in itself but with man in mind. This anthropocentric approach is visible in the fact that the topos was always inhabited by men or the gods; hence the components were selected on the basis of the delight they were bringing to all human senses. Moreover, the components them- selves were endowed with human emotions and described in anthropomorphic terms (e.g., ridentia prata).10 They were chosen for their variety, but their quantity was also important. The latter was expressed by the poet by means of lists or cata- logs. Thereby the topos acquired also an epideictic function inasmuch as it served to praise the land, its fertility or its usefulness to men, depending on which one of the various patterns of the topos was used: the thicket or park (Mischwald), the garden, or the orchard variety (Schonbeck, p. 15). In its thousand-year-long history the topos ex- perienced many changes in many of its aspects, changes deterrtiined by the century, the country, the context in which it was used. The continuity of the tradition, however, was provided by the imita- tive approach to poetry writing and by the schools of rhetorics in which, incidentally, the topos often served as the conventional formula for the ele- ments of time and place (argumentum a tempore, argumentum a loco mostly as toposthesia rather than topographia)." There is evidently more to the topos than Curtius wanted to or could convey in the concise description that he intended as a stimulus rather than a definitive pronouncement. By the same token, this study must be more than a mere ap- plication of Curtius' formula to Spee's poetry. I will give a descriptive analysis of all the aspects of the tradition as found in Spee without losing sight, at the same time, of those points on which the poet departs from the typical. The typical, or the common denominator, as Rainer Gruenther calls it,12 will provide the proper perspective and in- dispensable information, while the numerator will show either a phase in the historical evolution of the topos or, more often, a willful manipula- tion on the part of the poet. Finally, since this study deals with a poet and his work, it will include those aspects of form and style that, more than any others, represent his original contribution.13 In the first section of Trutznachtigall there are two kinds of poems. The first, an "action" poem, describes a walk into nature for the purpose of meeting, searching for, or being with the beloved. The other, a "mood" poem, deals with a state of the soul: yearning, joyful, sad, penitent. In both of these situations nature plays a role: either it provides the setting for the action or it reflects the state of the soul. The Spaziergang device, known to us from the Middle High German, became very popular in the late Middle Ages.'4 The tradition is much older, however, since both the situation and the word (spatiari) appear in Medieval Latin poems that combine the walk, the morning, springtime, and love.15 The locus amoenus serves here both as a lovely place and as the place for love. Spee uses the Spaziergang six times, yet not every walk is automatically followed by a descrip- tion of nature. Sometimes only a formula ("Auff gruiner Heyd und Matten," p. 47, 1. 12) satisfies the poet. As a matter of fact, only a small number of poems in the first section (4 out of 18, counting the introductory poem) contain a description of 968</page><page sequence="3">Frederick M. Rener nature worthy of notice. All such descriptions, however, are unmistakable examples of the locus amoenus, yet each instance presents signifi- cant differences determined by the poem in which it occurs. In poem number four, "Die Gesponfi Jesu spielet im VValdt mit einer Echo oder vvider- schall," for instance, the argumentum a loco is ex- pressed in terms of the topos (the park variety) used as a Lagerungsmotif ("safi"). Its components ("waldt," "steinen Klausen," "laub vnd grafi," "windlein," "briinlein," "bachlein") were chosen with the echo game in mind. Since the echo was the predominant acoustic element, the poet elimi- nated the birds, which would normally fulfill this function, and inserted instead the rocky defile because it would contribute to the echo. The forest and water are stripped of their acoustic qualities and given only a visual function, also to contribute to the poet's plan. The flowers are absent, pre- sumably because this is not the garden but the park variety of the topos. Poem number one, "Eingang zu diesem Buch- lein / Trutz Nachtigal genant," on the other hand, focuses on acoustic effects. Its purpose is to intro- duce the nightingale, the queen of singers, whose vocal qualities are measured and made to excel by a comparison ("doch stisser noch erklinget") with an acoustic version of the topos. In the pattern used ("Vogel," "Waldt," "Krufften," "Bachlein," "Wind," "Baume") the birds obviously stand out: the poet placed them first and assigned to them more space than to any other component. The concentus is enriched by the acoustic qualities of water ("sausen," "stimmen ein") and of the wind that uses the branches of the trees for its string instrument. Even a traditionally visual element like "Waldt," however, acquires an acoustic func- tion, as a sounding board ("der hole Waldt ertonet") aided by the "Krufften" which also "geben klang." In the remaining three poems of the first section that are of interest here, landscape appears not as a place element but as the argumentum a tempore. The poems follow the classical approach men- tioned above of equating man and nature in terms of emotions. Poem number seventeen, "Ein Christliche Seel muntiert sich auff im abgang jhrer travvrigkeit," and number eighteen, "Jubel einer Christlichen Seelen nach vbervvundener travvrigkeit," are both Trostlieder describing the soul's regained spiritual joy after a period of aridity and depression. This inner state is pro- jected into nature where the poet describes a simi- lar transition from winter, conceived as a state of distress ("Natur war auch im schmertzen"), to spring. In both poems winter is only mentioned while spring is described as a locus amoenus of the garden variety (with flowers but without trees). While the number of components is roughly the same in the two poems, the two topos passages differ in length, formulation, and rhetorical char- acteristics. Poem number eighteen has two stanzas, twice as many as in number seventeen, both char- acterized by different anaphoras (5 lines in the 3rd stanza begin with "Weil," every 2nd line in the 4th begins with "Schaw"). In addition, this same poem introduces the bees as a component of the topos, as they used to be in classical antiquity, since in the poem the spiritual joy of the soul is presented in terms of honey. Poem number eight, "Liebgesang der GesponI3 Jesu, im anfang der Sommerzeit"'l6 represents another tradition associating love and spring. An extended, pattern of the topos, five stanzas out of twelve, describing the joy pervading nature at springtime, is designed, using the comparison device, to heighten, by contrast, the sadness of the loving soul at the absence of the beloved. In addi- tion to the standard elements ("laub," "bliim- lein," "bachlein," "brunnlein," "wind," "Vog- lein"), this poem, too, presents a peculiar feature in the topos, and only the knowledge of the tradi- tion supplies a possible explanation of its presence. The element in question is "die jagerin Diana stoltz," which is rarely found in the topos at this time.'7 Even more surprising is the fact that it is used in a religious poem without any visible relationship with the rest of the poem; the poet may have used it because in classical antiquity it was part of the Belebtheit of the topos. The middle section of Trutznachtigall is com- prised of the praises of God or laudes, a coherent group of twelve poems,'8 which the critics have unanimously regarded as derivations of the psalms. Ilse Martens, endorsing the opinion of Schachner and Biese,"9 says: "Man kann in dieser Hinsicht sageh, dafi Spees Anschauung 'im wesentlichen eine biblische zu nennen' ist. Gleich den Dichtern des alten Testaments ruft er die ganze Natur auf zum Preise ihres allmachtigen, schreckend erhabenen Schopfers" (Darstellung, 969</page><page sequence="4">970 Friedrich Spee's ' p. 567). Rosenfeld shares the same view when she states: "Wenn sie auch auf der Unterlage bi- blischer Psalmen aufgebaut sind, so variieren sie doch den Psalter auf originelle und reizvolle Weise in immer neuen Toinen" (Studien, p. 135; see Baroque Poetry, p. 54). Only poem number twenty-four fits this de- scription in all its implications; in the others the problem is more complex. The critics have evi- dently read all the laudes in the light of this one and on the assumption that laudes and psalms are synonymous and interchangeable, which even a casual acquaintance with both will disprove. When these poems are analyzed in terms of the descrip- tion of nature, two distinct traditions, a classical and a biblical, emerge, although differences do exist also in some aspects of form and especially in the notion of the Creator, since here nature is seen as creatura. In poem number twenty-one, "Anleitung zur erkandtnui3 vnd liebe defi Schopffers auf3 den geschoipffen," Spee makes a key statement for the classical tradition: Dal3 meisterstuck mit sorgen Wer nur wilt schawen an / Jhm freilich nit verborgen / Der meister bleiben kan. (p. 110,11.6-9) The passage is founded on the classical conception of the universe as cosmos, originally an adjective meaning orderly and beautiful, which presupposes a creator who is an artist, more precisely, either an architect (deus opifex) to go with order or a painter (deus pictor) to go with beauty. Both notions were incorporated into the Christian thought and are also found in Spee.20 In the same tradition the poet conceives of the universe as divided into three kingdoms (triregnum): the heavens, the earth, and the ocean, another idea assimilated by Christianity.21 Spee's conception of the universe is geocentric not only in a physical way ("Steigt auff / vnd steigt hinunder" p. 140, 1. 24) but also in the amount of attention and space he devotes to it. In the first part of this same poem, for instance, he apportions two stanzas to the heavens, six to the "erdenreich," and one to the ocean. The triregnum serves here as an element of structure and order. The earth is depicted as a series of "Geschopff" or wonders of creation, except for poem number "Arcadia" Revisited twenty-three, which deals with only one such wonder, the bee. The poet's goal is to arouse in the reader not a sense of fear as Martens suggested but one of amazement at the sight of such "Wun- der." Since in the view of this tradition the "Meisterstiick" is a direct reflection of the "Mei- ster," the admiration will ultimately reach God through an inductive process: O mensch ermess im hertzen dein / VVie vvunder muI3 der Schopffer sein.22 (p. 110, 11. 14-15) These two lines are repeated as a refrain after each one of the eighteen stanzas of his "An- leitung." While drawing this panoramic view of creation the poet does not set up his canvas out of doors so that nature can stand model but relies on the topos locus amoenus as the source of his inspira- tion. In classical fashion, he spreads the compo- nents spaciously over entire stanzas (the topos functions here as the very content of the poem rather than a mere argumentum) and he does so using the techniques that were themselves an integral part of the topos in classical antiquity. To begin with, he leaves no doubt that the prin- ciple he follows in drawing his landscape coincides with that of the topos, namely, the delight to all human senses, although in practice some of the senses are missing: Wo nur dai aug man wendet hin / Mit lusten wirds ergetzet; Ergetzet wird fast jeder sinn / Vnd alles wunder schetzet. (p. 125, 11. 13-16) Of the two cosmic characteristics mentioned above he reserves order primarily, though not exclusively, for the heavens ("kein harlein sich verfahren") and beauty for the earth. The amoeni- tas ("lieblichkeit") of his "erdenreich" originates, just as in the classical notion, in the variety of the components which shows in their quality ("schon- heit") and quantity ("zahl"): O schonheit der naturen! 0 wunder lieblichkeit! O zahl der Creaturen! Wie streckest dich so weit ? (p. 117, 11. 5-8) In order to achieve a maximum of variety he combines all three classical types of the topos:</page><page sequence="5">Frederick M. Rener the park ("die stoltze baum in walden wildt," p. 123, 1. 1), the garden ("blumlein"), and the orchard ("die zahm / vnd fruchtbar baum," p. 123, 1. 13). When it comes to express "die zahl der Creaturen" Spee resorts to the catalog device which he uses several times. The most impressive is the list of twenty-five flowers (p. 120, 11. 15-22 and p. 121, 11. 1-8), followed by the ten fruit trees (p. 123, 11. 13-20), and the six wild animals (p. 116, 11. 19-20). Elsewhere he uses shorter catalogs.23 It is from these lists that he received the reputation as a painter of miniatures and as a keen observer of nature.24 At times, he expresses quantity also by purely rhetorical means, ranging from single words like "unzahlbar," "ohn mafi," "vber alle massen," to rhetorical questions ("Wer will die baum nun zehlen," p. 114, 1. 9), to repetitive cumulations (geminatio) which were thought to have a strong influence on the "Affekte" of the audience: Der zweig vnd nast seind tausent / Vnd tausent / tausent viel / Mehr tausent / tausent / tausent / Der blattlein / vnd der stiel. (p. 114,11. 19-22) Such descriptions of a paradisiac nature end abruptly with poem number twenty-four, as if the poet had planned a division of the laudes along our lines. The contrast introduced by poem twenty-four is noticeable, on the one hand, by the absence of the familiar components used so far and, on the other, by the presence of new and strange elements like "Drachen," "Walfisch," "gewurm," "stoltze berg," "Ceder-holtz." The most significant change, however, is the presence of atmospheric phenomena which are not only foreign to the topos but also diametrically opposite to its very amoenitas. Auch hagel weil3 / auch flocken greifI3 Von schnee vnd eyf3 entzogen: Auch dampff / vnd fewr / blitz ungehewr / Zusampt dem regen-bogen. (p. 142, 11. 21-24) It is true that these elements are to be expected in this poem because the poet found them in Psalm cxlviii which he is paraphrasing. The same is true of the two following poems (nos. 25 and 26) which, according to the manuscript titles, are also drawn "aul3 vnterschiedlichen psalmen Dauids" (see Trutznachtigall, ed. Arnt, pp. ci, ciii). How- ever, they have been incorporated also in the two large invitational ("Ermahnung") poems (nos. 27 and 28). Here a combination of the classical and the biblical influences can be seen. The former is present in components like "bluiimlein," "vogelein," in some details like the tall growing trees (see Schonbeck, pp. 49, 157), in references to deus pictor ("wolgemahlte voglein," p. 154, 1. 15). The latter is condensed into one single stanza: Auff / auff / Gott wil gelobet sein: Jhn loben wind / vnd regen / Jhn loben blitz / vnd wetterschein / Zusampt den donner-schlagen: Jhn lobet auch der regen-creiI3 / Der bogen bunt gefarbet; Reyff / wetter / wind / vnd sommer-eyf3 Jn kisel klein zerkerbet. (p. 154, 11. 3-10) Seen from the point of view of wording, rather than content, even these "biblical" poems are not immune from classical influences. In the poetic version of Psalm cxlviii, where the original has the bare noun "birds," Spee has four lines that would fit quite well into the opening poem: Auch du so schwanckes feder-vieh / So thust in lufften schiffen / Vnd zierlich trillest je / vnd je Die zuinglein rein geschliffen: (p. 143, 11. 13-16) Such classical formulations can be found through all of the "biblical" poems. Other distinctive features of the biblical in- fluence are: (a) the exclamatory, invitational tone as opposed to the descriptive in the classical poems (the masterpiece praises God by its very existence); (b) the presence of angels in the "heavens" whereas previously he used only the astronomical triad (sun, moon, stars); (c) the division of the universe according to the four elements rather than the triregnum, and, above all, a totally differ- ent image of the Creator. Here he is the absolute ruler ("Sein ist der Scepter / sein die Cron," p. 144, 1. 15) who makes the whole creation tremble ("Vor jhm erd / himmel bebet," p. 144, 1. 16) with the power to preserve and destroy: Waf3 er dan wil / thut er behendt Jn gleichem punct verrichten; Was er auch wil / thut vnverwendt Jn gleichem punct zernichten. (p. 147, 11. 10-13) 971</page><page sequence="6">Friedrich Spee's "Arcadia" Revisited In recent years, scholars have turned their atten- tion more and more to Spee's eclogues, found in the third and last section of Trutznachtigall, thus giving Spee the new image of a pastoral poet and his landscape the label of Arcadia. "In den Eklogen wird zum erstenmal in der deutschen Literatur eine arkadische Landschaft gezeichnet, wenn auch ein geistliches Arkadien."25 From this and similar statements the reader gets the impres- sion that the eclogues are a coherent group of poems in which nature plays a significant role. Furthermore, since the topos has for centuries been almost synonymous with Arcadia, the reader rightly expects here a more generous sampling of it than in any previous section. None of these assumptions is confirmed by re- ality. The eclogues represent only one half of the poems in the section and are distributed unevenly through it. The poet evidently did not intend them to be a collection within the collection. Only two (nos. 45 and 50) display a genuine arcadian land- scape while in the others only general references to nature are made, like "auff gruiner heyd" (p. 236, 1. 10), "auff grunem feldt" (p. 195, 1. 18), "zun gruinen wasen," i.e., "wiesen" (p. 190,1. 4). In some of them nature is absent entirely. Poem number fifty, the last eclogue, describes the resurrection of Christ against the background of the resurrection of nature in springtime. The poet employs a sizable pattern of the topos ("Sonn," "voglein," "felder," "bliimlein," the in- separable couple "Bruinnlein" and "bachlen," a minicatalog of mixed trees: "tann," "linden," "Eich," "Cederbaum") to which he adds the typical arcadian elements: the meadow as "weyd," the grazing animals, and the shepherd-musicians. The other eclogue, poem number forty-five, has a shorter topos ("feld vnd wisen," "fluil3 vnd wasser," "bliimlein") and another small catalog of trees ("linden," "eichen," "buichen"). The function of nature in the two poems (nos. 45 and 50) is similar; it underlines a religious event, with the difference that here it is not jubilation but its op- posite, a "planctus naturae" (Spee calls it "klagliches hirten-gesprach") at the death of Christ in the person of the mythological shepherd Daphnis. The reason for this reduced role of nature in these poems is not easy to find, and thus, only tentative answers can be offered. Strangely enough, in spite of the scholarly interest in the eclogues, no thorough study is available, especially none that shows them in the tradition of the eclogue. Such an investigation would evidence that the eclogue has developed considerably since Theocritus and Virgil and that it was used as a medium by which the most disparate topics of public and private character could be treated. The majority of topics had no connection with pastoral life other than the fact that they were treated in a dialogue form by two presumed shepherds.26 Spee used this medium for religious purposes, sometimes taking up pastoral elements from the Gospel (the shep- herds at Christ's birth, the parable of the good shepherd), and preserved a comparatively great number of the classical elements of the eclogue, like the dialogue ("hirten-gesprach"), the competition ("Reimen-streit"), the distinction between Schdfer and Hirt,27 and mythological references to Daph- nis. Yet his topics vary. The first three eclogues are laudes using the firmament as content,28 others take place at night, or in the wintertime, or deal with unpastoral subjects. In such cases the locus amoenus was unusable. Another possible reason for the lack of land- scape comes from the pactical purpose for which the eclogues may have been written. In my opinion, in arranging the third section of Trutznachtigall, Spee followed not numerical symbolism as Robert Browning has recently suggested,29 but the eccle- siastical year. With few exceptions,30 these poems are clustered around feasts which allowed for ex- traliturgical manifestations. These were primarily Christmas and Easter with their sacred repre- sentations going back to the Middle Ages. A third feast, Corpus Christi, was added later to honor the definition of the dogma of transubstan- tiation.31 Its extraliturgical manifestation was, and still is, the procession. In Trutznachtigall the Christmas cycle (poems 33-36) comprises two eclogues (nos. 34 and 36), the Easter cycle (poems 38-51), eight eclogues (nos. 3941, 45, 47-50); and the Corpus Christi has only one poem that is not an eclogue. The poems are arranged chronologi- cally (the Easter cycle amounts to a small Passion play), and the eclogues are placed at the points where their topic fits into the chronology, hence their uneven distribution. One can assume that the eclogues were minia- ture "sacred representations" used in the Jesuit spirit of the counterreformation and performed either in church (at the manger and Easter sepulchre) or in catechism classes.32 In such a case 972</page><page sequence="7">Frederick M. Rener the dress of the "actors," a gesture, a word like "grimne heyd" would have sufficed to create the illusion of the setting. This would have made a description of nature superfluous except where nature was a part of the action or the "plot," which is the case in the two poems (nos. 45, 51) discussed above. This hypothesis receives more credibility from the fact that Spanish religious eclogues also display the same three cycles of the ecclesiastical year.33 After these investigations directed primarily to the physical aspects of the topos I will now turn to some stylistic aspects. One such aspect, which also shows Spee's dependence on the topos, is his use of the epithets. I will examine only those associated with water because they are most numerous and most diversified. For water is the only component that can appeal simultaneously to several senses as can be seen, for instance, in Petrarch's famous line: "Chiare, fresche e dolci acque."34 The quali- ties of water had already been set in classical antiquity and the epithets learned in schools of rhetorics together with the nouns of the topos, hence their presence in all Western literatures. Originally, they referred to the physical qualities of water but, later, metaphorical forms emerged, mostly out of comparisons. Unlike Petrarch, Spee has no taste sensations, but only those of vision, hearing, and touch. The visual effect of water stems from either its appearance or its movement. The former is ex- pressed by the epithet "klar" as in "Ein brunlein klar / Bey seiten war" (p. 10,11. 8-9), which grew out of the postclassical "clarus" (Boccaccio has "claros rivos" in his Carmen Bucolicum, Ecloga v) replacing the classical "limpidus." Through the comparison with glass (Virgil's "vitrea unda," Horace's "splendidior vitro") and later with crys- tal came Spee's metaphorical "wasser-glas" (p. 156, 1. 15) and "die reine flu13 Crystallen klar" (p. 124, 1. 18).35 Classical antiquity also knew epithets referring to the reflections rather than the translucency pf water. It was compared to silver, as in Ovid's "fons argenteus." Spee makes fre- quent use of this in various forms, as a noun, an adjective, or lexical compounds: "Wie glas / vnd silber leuchten" (p. 149, 1. 17); "All silber-weifie tochterlein / Der holen Berg / vnd Steinen" (p. 35, 11. 19-20); "Klar wie lauter Silberschein" (p. 101, 1. 14); "Wal3 manche fliessend silber-gas" (i.e., Gasse) (p. 156,1. 17). Traditionally, the topos uses only moving water, and the course is either descending (Horace's "per pronum rivum") or, more often, a winding one (Horace's "obliquo rivo" or Ovid's "recurvatis in undis"). Spee renders it by means of either the adjective "krumb" ("die Bachlein krumb gefloch- ten," p. 2, 1. 3) or the verb form "wancken" ("wanckend Wasser klar," p. 202, 1. 25) or a combination of the two: Frisch hin vnd her gehn wancken Die klare bachlein krumb. (p. 113, 11. 4-5) The metaphor used in this connection is the snake (Ovid's "nullo cum murmure serpit") which is found in Spee: Wie Schlanglein krumb Gehn lachlend vmb Die bachlein kuihl in Walden. (p. 35, 11. 14-16)36 The acoustic aspect of water, besides the ob- vious "sausen," was expressed in classical an- tiquity by the onomatopoetic and anthropo- morphic "murmurare" (Horace's "quae per pro- num trepidat cum murmure rivum" or Ovid's "aspice labente in iucundo cum murmure rivum") which many languages have appropriated as a lexical form. Spee uses the verb form ("murren") only once. The situation, however, namely the presence of stones in the riverbed, is treated in anthropomorphic terms more than once: some- times as a playful chatter ("gepleer," "beschwet- zet") between water and the stones: Bald rauschen her / Nit ohn gepleer / Vnd mit den steinlein spielen. (p. 36, 11. 2-4) or as altercations with varying degrees of animos- ity ("angefochten," "zancken," "starcken spalt"): Heut ein bachlein wol beschwetzet Nahm die flucht auI3 grunem wald; An den steinlein sich verletzet / Hett mit jhnen starcken spalt: Dan weils jhm nit wolten weichen Auf3 so lutzel feuchter straf3 / Zornig that es neben streichen / Murret starck ohn vnderlaI3. (p. 315, 11. 1-8)37 The third sense area, that of touch, has, besides 973</page><page sequence="8">Friedrich Spee's "Arcadia" Revisited the obvious "kuiihl," an epithet that relates to the origin of this quality, namely the shady trees, hence Ovid's "umbrosa unda" which Spee uses as a situation rather than as a lexical form: Die reine fluii3 Crystallen klar / Verbremt mit griunen weiden / Von schatten schier bedecket gar / Die Sonnen-hitz vermeiden. (p. 124, 11. 18-21) This quality especially betrays the Mediterranean origin of the topos and, in so doing, shows that such landscapes are not drawn from reality. In Spee this fact is particularly evident not only be- cause of the location of his native Rhineland but, above all, because the context describes the prime of spring ("Der Fruhling riistet sich zum lauff," p. 117, 1. 19). This study has shown that the topos is so elastic that in the large samples a single component can take up a whole stanza. Now I would like to examine the technique used in these expansions, particularly since details of color or lighting drawn from nature could have been added by the poet. I have shown already that most of the qualities in the topos had been standardized in the course of time. Rhetorics, which was responsible for this tradition, also provides the answer to my query. These passages are amplified by rhetorical means and no new qualities or details are added. The most concise pattern of the topos contains bare nouns: Ade du schone Fruhlingszeit / Jhr Felder / wald / vnd wisen / Laub / graB / vnd blumlein new gekleid / Jhr wasser klar / (p. 39, 11. 13-17) Such passages are rare because they are rhetori- cally uninteresting. It was through the epitheta and other embellishments that a poem gained brilliance.38 In? the process of rhetorically decorat- ing the elements of the topos, Spee uses various means: adjectives, adverbs, participial construc- tions. The length of these formations is determined by structural aspects of Spee's stanza based on symmetry and numerical reduplication. In the eight-line stanza divided into two equal segments by a full stop at the end of the fourth line, a state- ment fills either one, two, or four lines. Con- sequently, descriptions of topical components stretch over one line, "Die voglein schon er- klingen" (p. 96, 1. 5), or two lines: Da sausen gleich an Baumen Die lind geriihrte Zweig. (p. 2, 11. 11-12) or four lines, Die Bachlein krumb geflochten Auch lieblich stimmen ein / Von Steinlein angefochten Gar sui3lich sausen drein. (p. 2, 11. 3-6) Larger samples are attained by parallelisms based on synonymical expressions (also a type of re- duplication). Thus the bird song can be character- ized by a simple epithet ("schoin" or "sii3") or by two epithets ("sui3 vnd rein") but it can also be expanded to fill almost an entire stanza: Die flugelreiche schaaren / DaI3 Federbuiirschlein zart In suiissem Schlag erfahren / Noch kunst noch athem spart: Mit Schnablein wolgeschliffen Erklingens wunder fein / Vnd frisch in Lufften schiffen Mit leichten ruderlein. (p. 1, 11. 12-19) Seen in this light, such passages, taken out of context as they are, give this poetry a mechanical and artificial character, which is one of the main criticisms leveled by nineteenth-century esthetics at all poetry of this century. The poet, in imposing on his formulation patterns of order and structure, in applying devices readily available in the manuals of rhetorics and of the ars poetica, was striving to attain the standards of craftsmanship his peers and readers expected from him.39 The word "arti- ficial," rather than being a censure, was a compli- ment signifying that a poem was literally a "work of art" (arte-factum). Yet the existence of this technical apparatus and the poet's use of it did not thwart his creativity. On the contrary, it chal- lenged it. Rhetorics and the ars provided him with a rich palette of colores rhetorici, but the choice and the mixing were his own. It was here that the real poet could be distinguished from a mere versifier. The formularity of the topos invited repetitious- ness. Spee avoided this danger by finding a new formulation for every component each time he 974</page><page sequence="9">Frederick M. Rener described it.40 This entailed not only imagination and inventiveness but also mastery of the lan- guage. "Das geschichtlich Einmalige" (Gruenther) in Spee may be seen, therefore, not only in the subtle adaptations of the topical pattern to fit the poem but far more so in the variety of formula- tions he devises.41 It is this that gives Spee's poetry that unmistakable characteristic that later cen- turies interpreted as experiential "Naturgefuihl" and "Volkslied" style. This study has produced some unexpected re- sults: nature is not as preponderant in Trutz- nachtigall as was assumed, whereas Spee's de- pendence on the topos exceeds expectations. In spite of the restrictive connotations of the topos, the creativity of the poet, in form and content, was visible through this investigation of each of the three groups of poems under study. The landscape itself harbors some surprises. First, it suffers from an atrophy of the senses as compared to the classical model, the visual quali- ties outnumber by far those of hearing, and touch receives little attention while smell and taste are completely absent. Yet the poet knows and men- tions four senses elsewhere in the book.42 Second, it is very one-sided. The poet is familiar with four seasons, with night and day, with parts of the day.43 However, when it comes to describing the seasons he knows only the prime of the day and the prime of the year. Third, it abounds in movement, but only movement in place. Motion in time seems unknown to him inasmuch as there is no change of lighting or weather in his landscape, no sunsets, no April showers, not even a cloud, except for the biblical pattern. But even these do not bring change. Fourth, in the laudes it is self-contra- dictory. The poet is supposedly describing the early hours of the day, yet the sun shines as if it were noon; it is the beginning of spring, yet the forest is dark with foliage, the heat is intense, the vines are loaded with grapes, and the fruit trees "fast alle nast beschwaren" (p. 124,1. 1). Many of these contradictions dissipate as soon as it becomes clear that the topos locus amoenus as preserved in the Christian descriptions of the earthly paradise also displayed similar synchro- nism and timelessness of nature.44 This fact poses another question regarding Spee's landscape: in using the topos is Spee only following a tradition, or is he implying, at least in the laudes, that only this prelapsarian nature is capable of revealing God's "wunder," whereas real nature (natura lapsa) is not? While no clear position can be taken at this stage of our research, a positive answer seems unlikely. According to Gruenther, in the Middle Ages the "paradisiac" nature had already acquired paradigmatic status for landscape de- scriptions (Paradisus, p. 144). This study would not be complete without a few remarks about the gap between its findings and those of its predecessors. Some divergencies, those regarding the laudes and the eclogues for instance, are caused, in my opinion, by hasty conclusions on the part of the critics. The more serious differences, however, have their roots in the reception Spee's poetry was granted in the early nineteenth century when the foundations of our histories of literature were being laid. Spee fared well compared to his contemporaries: as I have shown elsewhere, he was considered a religious Volksdichter rather than a poeta doctus.45 Because of the derivative nature of the histories of literature which often consisted of mere elaborations on what predecessors had said, this notion soon acquired the semblance of a general consensus. This, in turn, commanded such authority that it blurred the vision of the critics, much like tainted eyeglasses, to such a degree that neither a recourse to the sources (Ilse Martens, Gunther Muller) nor a new positivistic approach to history writing (Wilhelm Scherer) could cor- rect it.46 University of North Carolina Greensboro Notes 1 Neue Gesamtausgabe der Werke und Schriften, ed. Ger- hart Baumann and Siegfried Grosse (Stuttgart: Cotta, 1958), iv, 195. 2 Quotations from a few selected works arranged chrono- logically will give an idea of the unbroken tradition of the consensus. Among these works, the histories of literature played a prominent part because of their long life-span and their many editions, which added new authors as time went on but left intact the passages about older ones. August Vilmar's history of literature, e.g., first published in 1845, a decade before Eichendorff's, reached the 25th edition by 1901 and was last printed in 1936; Robert Konig's book saw 975</page><page sequence="10">Friedrich Spee's "Arcadia" Revisited the 8th edition in 1880, the 32nd in 1910, and the 37th (ed. Paul Weiglin) in 1930; Alfred Biese's work, first published in 1907, reached the 24th edition by 1930 and its last print- ing in 1934. August F. C. Vilmar writes about Spee: "Der eigen- tuimliche Zug an seinen Liedern . . . ist die Vereinigung eines kindlichen, tiefen, innigen Naturgefuhls mit in- briinstiger Liebe zum Heiland" (Geschichlte der deutschen National-Litteratur, 12th ed., Marburg: Elwert, 1868, p. 349). Heinrich Kurz, in his Geschichte der deutschen Liter- atur (4th ed., Leipzig: Teubner, 1885), II, 247, asks the rhetorical question: "Oder wer verkennt die Gesundheit in der Liebe zur Natur, die er so wundersam schildert?" while Robert Konig makes the following statement: "Eine tiefe, seelenvolle Innigkeit und Frommigkeit spricht aus seinen Liedern, ein warmes Naturgefuhl" (Deutsche Literaturgeschichte, 32nd ed., Bielefeld: Velhagen &amp; Kla- sing, 1910, i, 239). In the 20th century, the tradition is continued by Alfred Biese, who writes: "Neben warmer, echter Frommigkeit bricht auch bei ihm wie bei Gerhardt immer wieder die Liebe zur Natur hervor" (Deutschle Literatlrgeschichwe, 15th ed., Munich: Beck, 1919, i, 391). Kuno Francke speaks of Spee's "Gefuhlsromantik" and of his "heitere Naturfreude" (Kulturwerte der deutschen Literatur, Berlin: Weidmann, 1923, pp. 270, 274) and in his History of Ger- man Literature (New York: Holt, 1931, p. 194) he states: "Spee's strength lies in his keen eye for the beauty of out- ward things." In Fritz Martini's more recent Deutsche Literaturgeschichte (6th ed., Stuttgart: Kroner, 1955, p. 145), we read: "Mit mystischer Inbrunst feiert er Gott in der zu allen Sinnen sprechenden, jubilierenden Schonheit der Natur..... Inbrunstige Glut wechselt mit schonen Bildern, mystische Verzuckung mit bildhafter Anschauung einer bluhenden, von Pflanzen und Vogelgesang belebten Landschaft." Ten years later Werner Kohlschmidt writes in his Geschichte der deutschen Literatur vom Barock bis zur Klassik (Stuttgart: Reclam, 1965, p. 90): "Diese Einstellung fuhrt zur Versenkung in jede einzelne Erscheinung mit auf3ergewohnlicher Glut und Innigkeit, der auch Steine, Erze und jedes Ding franziskanisch einbezogen werden." The same idea is found also in more specialized works. In Emil Ermatinger's Barock und Rokoko in der deutschenz Dichtung (Leipzig: Teubner, 1928, p. 41), Spee is called "ein mannlicher Droste, nur tiefer und inbrunstiger" who gives all his love "der Kleinwelt der Natur." Paul Hankam- mer, in his often reprinted Deutsche Gegenreformation und deutsches Barock (3rd ed., Stuttgart: Metzler, 1964, p. 164), speaks under the heading "Naturgefuhl" of "zierlich-zarten Naturschilderungen." More recently, August Closs states that Spee "often paints natural scenes of charming sin- cerity" and that his poem "Konterfey des menschlichen Lebens" in particular "reveals Spee's sensitive feeling for nature" (The Genius of German Lyric, Philadelphia: Dufour, 1963, p. 125). Marian Szyrocki, in his Die deutsche Literatur des Barock: Eine Einfiihrung (Reinbek bei Hamburg: Rowohlt, 1968, p. 164), writes: "Er besingt die Schonheit der Landschaft und der Tages- und Jahreszeiten. Zwar sind seine Naturschilderungen als Preis Gottes gedacht, doch sie sind 'ganz untheologisch geformt' und zeugen von der Ergriffenheit des Dichters durch die Herrlichkeit der Natur." For works on Spee see nn. 3, 4, 5, and 14. 3 Emmy Rosenfeld, Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld: Eine Stimme in der Wiiste (Berlin: de Gruyter, 1958), pp. 233, 237; hereafter cited as Stimme; Neue Studien zur Lyrik von Friedrich von Spee (Milan: Cisalpina, 1963), p. 131; here- after cited as Studien. See also Philipp Witkop: "Aus dieser Liebeseinheit erwachst Spee ein Naturgefuhl so stark, so dramatisch, so seelen- und lebensvoll, wie es bis dahin in der deutschen Lyrik ohnegleichen, wie es bis Goethe nicht wieder zu finden ist" (Die deutschen Lyriker, Leipzig: Teubner, 1925, I, 36). 4"Die Darstellung der Natur in den Dichtungen Fried- richs von Spee," Euphorion, 26 (1925), 564-92; hereafter cited as Darstellung. 5 Geschichte des deutschen Liedes (1925; rpt. Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche, 1959), p. 43. Eric Jacobsen seems ambig- uous when he touches this point: "Von einem romantischen Sichverlieren in der Natur ist hier nicht die Rede, dagegen zeigt Spee ein schones Einfuihlungsvermoigen" (Die Meta- morplhosen der Liebe und Friedrich Spees "Trutznachtigall," Copenhagen: Munksgaard, 1954, p. 161; hereafter cited as Metamorphosen). The term "Einfuhlungsvermogen," how- ever, betrays his adherence to the traditional view seen in n. 2. 6 This is esp. visible in the 2 studies by Rosenfeld. 7 See Jacobsen, Metamorphosen, pp. 20, 158; Robert M. Browning, "On the Numerical Composition of Friedrich Spee's Trutznachtigall" in Festschrift fur Detlev D. Schu- mann, ed. Albert R.

Flusse) Menschengestalt annahm." I am indebted to this study for several ideas in this paragraph. Spee's poetry abounds in anthropomorphic forms. "Ridentia prata," e.g., or variations thereof, are found in "Weil die grune wiesen lachen" (p. 101,1. 5), or in "Gehn lachlend umb," speaking of the brooks (n. 35,1. 15). For the tradition see: "Prata iam rident omnia"; "Ianiam rident prata" in Mediecal Latin Lyrics, ed. and trans. Helen WaddJll (1929; rpt. Harmondsworth: Penguir, 1962). pp. 262, 224. Goethe's "Es lacht die Flur" ("Mailied") alsi reflects this tradition. 11 See Heinrich Lausberg, Handbuch der literarischen Rhetorik (Munich: Hueber, 1960), ?382-84. 12 Gruenther says: "Der von Curtius topisch abgesteckte 'Lustort' ist gleichsam der gemeinsame Nenner bestimmter 976</page><page sequence="11">Frederick M.

Raby, A History of Secular Latin Poetry in the Middle Ages, 2nd ed., Oxford: Clarendon, 1957, II, 239.) "lam prata sunt amoena/ spatiari dulce est" (Wad- dell, Latin Lyrics, p. 220). 16 "Sommerzeit" reflects the division of the year into 2 seasons. "Das iar teilent die liute in zwei, in den winter unde in den sumer, aber die meister teilent es in vier teil." Meinauer Naturlehre, ed. W. Wackernagel, Bibliothek des Literarischen Vereins in Stuttgart (Stuttgart: Hiersemann, 1851, xxII, 14). In Spee it is synonymous with "Fruhling." 17 Found in Boccaccio's Ninfale Fiesolano and in his La caccia di Diana. The same detail is used later by Pope in his "Windsor Forest" (1704): "Th' immortal huntress and her virgin train" (1. 160). 18 This number includes some poems from the neighbor- ing sections (1 Gesponf-poem and 3 eclogues) because of their common content. 19 She is referring to Heinrich Schachner's Naturbilder und Naturbetrachtung in den Dichtungen Friedrichs von Spee, Programm Kremsmunster (Linz: Steyr, 1906) and to Alfred Biese's Die Entwicklung des Naturgefiihls im Mit- telalter und Neuzeit (Leipzig: Veit, 1888). 20 See Curtius, Europnische Literatur, pp. 544, 550; St. Ambrose: "Pictus es ergo, o homo, et pictus a Domino tuo. Bonum habes arteficem atque pictorem" (J.-P. Migne, Patrologiae Cursus Completus Series Latina, Paris: Migne, 1844-82, xiv, 276). An example of deus opifex in Spee: Da sambt meinem Vatter droben Wir die schone welt gemacht. Erd / vnd himmel / wir in zeiten Han gezimmert / vnd gebawt / . . . (p. 261, 11. 9-12) and of deus pictor: Er mahlet jhn die federlein'/ -Schon vber alle massen. (p. 149, 1. 8) Griin farbet Er den erdenklotz / Mit blumlein vntermahlet.

Similarly, in an early hymn: Rex coeli, terrae, marium Regnari hic disposuit. (Guido M. Dreves, Analecta Hymnica Medii Aevi, Leipzig: Altenburg, 1886, v, 55.) 22 See also another passage in Trutznachtigall: Steigt auff vnd steigt hinunder In alien wercken sein; Rufft vberall / wie wunder Mui3 er doch selber sein! (p. 140, 11. 23-26) 23 See pp. 201, 202, 219, 220, 290, 325. For unknown reasons he does not use here a catalog of wild trees so popular in other literatures. For a discussion of the "cata- log" as a general enumerative device, see Harry E. Wedeck, "The Catalogue in Late and Medieval Latin Poetry," in Medievalia et Humanistica, Fasc. 13 (Boulder: Univ. of Colorado, 1960), pp. 10-16. Ovid's selection of trees is analyzed by Viktor Poschl, "Der Katalog der Baume in Ovids Metamorphosen," in Medium Aevum Vivum: Festschrift fur Walter Bulst (Heidelberg: Winter, 1960), pp. 13-21. Ovid's influence on tree catalogs in English (Chaucer, Spencer), Italian (Tasso, Poliziano, Marino), and, above all, Spanish poetry (Lope de Vega has 72 trees in a poem) is discussed by Rafael Osuna, "Un caso de continui- dad literaria: La 'Silva Amoena,'" Thesaurus, 24 (1969), 1-33. Spee uses, for variety's sake, native and exotic ele- ments like pomegranates (found already in Homer) and citrus fruits among the trees and nonnative beasts in the following catalog of animals: Elphanten / sampt Camelen / Rol3 / Lowen / hirsch / vnd Bar / (p. 116, 11. 19-20) For another example of plenitudo Dei see Spencer's poem "Hymn of Heavenly Beauty" quoted in Eustace M. W. Tillyard's The Elizabethan World Picture (1943; rpt. New York: Vintage, n.d.), p. 25. 24 This idea is expressed by Gustav Balke in the introd. to his edition of Trutznachtigall (Leipzig: Brockhaus, 1879, p. xlvii) as a deficiency due to lack of imagination: "Wie wir hier groI3e, schwungvolle Phantasie vermissen, so finden wir dieselbe auch nicht in den Naturschilderungen Spe's [sic]. Dieselbe sind Kleinmalereien." Later it became a commonplace in passages dealing with Spee but as a posi- tive value. See Rosenfeld's "jede kleinste Existenz, jede kleinste Regung," Kohlschmidt's "Versenkung in jede einzelne Erscheinung," or Susanne Bankl: "Die letzten 977</page><page sequence="12">Friedrich Spee's "Arcadia" Revisited zwei Strophen sind ein Beispiel fur Spees Kunst der Kleinmalerei und die Innigkeit der Betrachtung auch des Kleinsten in der Natur," in "Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld und die europaische Mystik," Diss. Vienna 1959, p. 360. 25 Rosenfeld, Stimme, p. 245. While this aspect was mentioned in passing in earlier works and identified as a pastoral "Maskerade," it has become the topic of many studies, esp. after World War Il: Wolfgang Nowak, "Ver- such einer motivischen Analyse des Schaferhabits," Diss. Berlin 1954; Elfriede Eikel, "Die Entstehung der religiosen Schaferlyrik von Petrarca bis Spee," Diss. Heidelberg 1957; Richard Newald's chapter on Spee entitled "Geist- liche Schaferdichtung" in Helmuth De Boor and Richard Newald, Geschichte der deutschen Literatur, 3rd. ed. (Munich: Beck, 1960), iv, 245. Nowak attempts to explain all aspects of Spec's work from the pastoral point of view. As a result we can read in a history of literature whose authors have read Nowak but not Spee: ". . . und die ein- undfiunfzig Lieder, die er Trutz-Nachtigall nannte, sind zum grol3ten Teil aus der Schaferdichtung hergeleitet" (Her- mann Glaser, Jakob Lehmann, and Arno Lubos, Wege der deutschen Literatur: ELine geschlichtliche Darstellung, Frankfurt: Ullstein, 1962, p. 79). 26 See William Leonard Grant, Neo-Latin Literature and the Pastoral (Chapel Hill: Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1965), p. 258. 27 See Harsdorffer, Frauenzimmer Gesprachspiele, ed. Irmgard Bottcher (1645; rpt. Tubingen: Niemeyer, 1969), v, 450: "Der Hirten sind viererley / Kuhehirten / Schaf- hirten / GeiI3hirten und Schweinhirten: Dieser letzten aber wird gar selten gedacht; der Schafhirten und Schafer am meisten: weil sie bey ihren Heerden fast miissig / ihren Gedanken am besten abwarten konnen und kein so un- bandiges Viehe / wie die andern / zu huten haben." An example from Spee: Treiben keine gleichen schaaren; Ich die schafflein / er die kuh. (p. 326, 11. 19-20) 28 The laudes-eclogues are arranged antithetically: in the first (no. 30) the shepherds are presented as they "zu nacht Gott loben, dievveil Mon, vnd Sternen scheinen" and in the next as they "zu morgens fruh Gott loben, allvveil die schone Sonn scheinet." The principle for this arrangement is known in rhetorics as distributio: an idea, instead of being expressed directly, is broken down into antithetical com- ponents ("polare Ausdrucksweise"). Spee's "zu nacht" and "zu morgens" stand for "always" or "day and night." The third eclogue (no. 32) combines this polarity into the same poem. In order to make "always" even more emphatic Spee increases here the number of subdivisions: the day is subdivided into morning, noon, and evening. He uses this device elsewhere'in the book, notably in his BuI3lieder and his Klagelieder. In the former, the antithesis appears in 2 consecutive poems (no. 15 at night, no. 16 during the day) whereas in the 2 latter ones (nos. 6 and 8), the antithesis is contained within each poem. 29 Browning, Composition and Baroque Poetry. The ideas presented in these 2 works certainly deserve a critical exam- ination but not within the framework of this study. 30 The exceptions are the laudes-eclogues, poem no. 37 which separates the Christmas and the Easter cycles, and poem 52 at the end of the book which may have been added, as Browning suggests, to fill a few empty pages. 31 Browning claims that this poem was put at the end of Trutznachtigall because it represents the climax and "the key to the interpretation of the whole cycle" (Baroque Poetry, p. 53) and he supports his assertion by pointing to the fact that it bears the number 51 which he calls "pente- costal" (Composition, p. 33). Judging by the title of the poem ("Am heiligen Fronleichnams Fest, von dem Hochv- viirdigen Sacrament defi altars") we are dealing heie with a poem composed expressly for the feast. Its position is de- termined by the place the feast of Corpus Christi occupies in the ecclesiastical year, namely at the very end of the impor- tant feasts. Its proper place would be in the Easter cycle (Maundy Thursday and the commemoration of Christ's Last Supper). However, the idea of such a feast came rather late when all the others were firmly established in the calen- dar. Consequently, it was decided to put it after Trinity Sunday which concluded the pentecostal cycle, yet on a Thursday to preserve its connection with Maundy Thurs- day. The Council of Trent confirmed the doctrine and the feast and gave the procession the character of a public manifestation, a "sacred representation" as it were, "damit ihre (i.e., der Wahrheit) Gegner im Anblick solchen Glanzes . . . wieder zu Verstande kommen" (Resolution of the Council of Trent in Taschenlexikon Religion und Theologie, Gottingen: Vandenhoeck, 1971, under "Fronleichnams- fest"). See also Handbuch theologischer Grundbegriffe (1962; rpt. Munich: DTV, 1970, under "Eucharistie"). If Spee really wanted to complete his collection with a "pente- costal" poem, would his Trinity-Poem (no. 29) not have served this purpose better ? 32 Theo. G. M. Oorshot suggests that several poems from Trutznachtigall may have been intended to be sung at cate- chism classes but he does not mention the eclogues in this connection ("Nachwort" to his edition of Spee's Giildenes Tugendbuch, Munich: Kosel, 1968). 33 See Eugen Kohler, Sieben spanische dramatische Eklogen, Gesellschaft fur romanische Literatur, No. 27 (Halle: Niemeyer, 1911), and Doris Lessig, Ursprung und Entwicklung der spanischen Ekloge bis 1650 (Geneva: Droz, 1962). 34 Le rime di Francesco Petrarca, ed.

(Orlando Furioso, Canto i, st. 35) 38 The technical term was "illustrare" and the embellish- ments were compared to the stars. See, e.g., Johannes Sturmius, De imitatione, ed. V. Erythraeus (Strassburg: Jobinus, 1576), n. pag.: "Tum verborum atque senten- tiarum ornamenta non magis celari possunt, quam sidera coeli." 39 More about Spee's structural preoccupations in my article "Friedrich Spee and Virgil's Fourth Georgic," Comparative Literature, 24 (1972), 118-35. 40 A few more examples of the description of birds: Sich die schone voglein rusten / Scharpffen jhre schnabelein / Sie sich lan der stimm gelusten / Blasen jhre pfeiffelein. (p. 326, 11. 5-8) Wan dan schallt auff den zweigen Gesang der vogelein / Noch Laut / noch Harpff / noch Geigen Klingt also su1i vnd rein: Jhr lieblichs musiciren Mich dunckt so sauber gut / Jhr kunstlichs coloriren / Bringt lauter frewden muth. (p. 115,11. 3-10) Zu dir viel tausend vogelein Mit frewd / vnd jubel schweben / Zur sang-schul zu dir kommen ein / Vnd nach dem Crantzlein streben / Wer wil die stucklein zehlen all / So die dan figuriren ? Concerten / Fugen / Madrigall / Auff hundertfalt maniren. (p. 160, 11. 3-10) 41 The word "derivative" used at times to describe this type of poetry tells only half of the story. It is evidently a remnant of the 19th-century esthetics where the "what" scored higher than the "how." 42 Wal3 nur zum jeden sinn gericht / WaI3 zum gefiihl / vnd horen / (p. 160, 11. 23-24) Wai3 zum geschmack / wai3 zum gesicht Sich last von keim zerstoren. (p. 161, 11. 1-2) Browning called my attention to poem no. 13 where Spee describes a flower that "gab auch so siissen ruch" to rebut my claim that Spee's flowers only blossomed and did not smell. However, this flower, probably a rose, is not part of the topos. It is used here as a symbol of the passing of beauty. 43 Dort stellet er den sommer klar / Den winter dort beyseiten; Dan auch den herbst / vnd Fruhling beyd . . . (p. 148,11. 13-15) 44 See A. Bartlett Giamatti, The Earthly Paradise and the Renaissance Epic (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1966), with ample bibliography. ? 45 See my "Spee, Herder, and Literary Criticism," German Quarterly, 44 (1971), 525-33. 46 Concluding his paragraph on Spee, Wilhelm Scherer says: "Zuweilen empfangen wir den Eindruck einer mit Schnorkeln und Gold uberladenen, mit verlebten Gemalden und gewundenen Saulen prangenden Jesuitenkirche; aber bald springen die Pforten auf, die Wande schwinden, und aus hoher offener Halle blicken wir auf Wald und Wiese und Bergesgipfel im Morgenschein: Bache rauschen, Vogel singen, Bienen summen, und die Harfe klingt" (Geschichte der deutschen Literatur, 7th ed., Berlin: Weid- mann, 1894, p. 335); also in Oskar Walzel's revised edition of Scherer's work (4th ed., Berlin: Askanischer Verlag, 1928, p. 259). 979</page></plain_text>
