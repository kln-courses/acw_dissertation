<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FINAL PALEOLITHIC IN NORTHERN ASIA: LITHIC ASSEMBLAGE DIVERSITY AND EXPLANATORY MODELS SERGEY A. VASIL'EV Abstract The paper reviews the rich and diverse record of Northern Asian lithic assemblages be- tween 15,000 and 10,000 years B.P. The patterning in lithic assemblage variation in the Paleolithic of Siberia cannot be adequately described within a "local culture" framework, still prevailing in Russian prehistory and based on the assumption of the existence of regionally discrete culture units in the Upper Paleolithic. It seems that the diversity of "local facies" might simply be a func- tion of the random and fragmentary nature of the available evidence. The illusion of separate cul- tural groups may disappear with the accumulation of more data and a better ability to bridge the gap between the archaeological record and the prehistoric past. Russian prehistorians have long discussed the spatio-temporal subdivision of the Siberian Final Paleolithic. Frequently, emphasis has been placed on the identification of "evolutionary phases" and "cultural patterns." This approach is not limited solely to the past; it is still common in current frameworks of Siberian prehistory. Undoubtedly, theoretical premises dominant at a particular time have shaped the various conceptions of Siberian Pleistocene prehistory. Viewed historically, a subtle and gradual change in interpretation can be seen which corresponds to change in these larger theoret- ical perspectives. Historical Background Savenkov (1892), one of the pioneers of prehistoric research in Siberia, paid particular attention to the peculiar, or unique, characteristics of Siberian lithic assemblages. He was the first scholar who pointed out the coexistence in the Siberian record of Acheulean- and Mousterian-like types with typical Upper Paleolithic small endscrapers, gravers and other tools, and a refined bone and antler industry. Despite the generally archaic characteristics of many of the artifacts he studied (many of which were from the sites of Afontova Gora), he suggested that the assemblages were Final Paleolithic in age (at that time called the "Reindeer Age"). However, cer- tain leading scholars of the West (e.g., de Mortillet and de Mortillet 1900), assigned the sites of Afon- tova Gora to the Acheulean or Mousterian, follow- ing de Baye (de Baye and Volkov 1899). From the early days of research, interpretation of prehistoric cultural change generally took place within a rigid framework of unilinear evolutionism. As such, the ultimate research objective was the ar- rangement of assemblages along a temporal ladder of discrete categories that defined successive stages of development. Some classic examples of this ap- proach, although limited by a paucity of data, can be seen in the works of such pioneers as Petrie (1923), Gorodtsov (1929), and Auerbach (Auerbach and Sosnovskii 1924). Additionally, these early Sergey B.

Today, of course, these early models only have his- torical significance. With the gradual accumulation of more data, new attempts at developing regional syntheses and more refined models of periodization began to ap- pear. Among the scholars addressing these concerns, Gromov (Bonch-Osmolovsky and Gromov 1936; Gromov 1948) played a crucial role in establishing a relative chronology of known sites. Sosnovskii fur- ther refined Gromov's conceptualization and, in 1934, published the first regional synthesis of Sibe- rian Pleistocene prehistory, entitled: The Paleolithic Sites of Northern Asia (Sosnovskii 1934). From the 1930s to 1950s, Soviet Paleolithic ar- chaeology was dominated by what can be termed a stadial approach, proposed by the State Academy for Material Culture History, and which can be con- sidered a developed evolutionary model. According to this model, cultural change is viewed as a pro- gression through successive "stages," and the Upper Paleolithic is no exception. This new approach differed from the older and simpler "classical" evolutionary model by establishing a relationship between identified cultural stages (presumably based on assemblage composition and other mate- rial indicators) and "progressive changes" in social life and economy, whatever these might be. It also differed from the older model as discrepancies be- tween actual assemblage compositions and the sug- gested stage schemes (i.e., the difference between what is actually found and the expectations of what "should" be found at a particular time, given the as- sumptions of the scheme), were explained away as population migration from other areas. The primary assumption was that different regions might express a given stage at different times. Within this frame- work, Efimenko (1953) and Boriskovskii (1953) at- tempted a subdivision of the Upper Paleolithic associated with the European portion of the USSR, while Sosnovskii (1934) and Okladnikov (1950) tackled the Siberian Upper Paleolithic. Sosnovskii (1934) suggested a basically uni- linear sequence for his stadial subdivision of the Si- berian Paleolithic. Based primarily on data from the Yenisei region, he defined three stages of culture change (see below). He believed that these stages re- flected the evolution of a single, autochthonous cul- ture. To summarize his scheme, Kaiskaia Gora, the main assemblage of Mal'ta, and Voennyi GospitaF were identified as the Siberian early Upper Paleo- lithic. The middle Upper Paleolithic was defined by the lowermost horizons of Afontova Gora E, Afon- tova Gora III, Kokorevo II, Bugach, Voennyi Goro- dok, and Kubekovo. Because of a lack of evidence, this middle phase was thought to be absent in the Angara River valley. The late Upper Paleolithic was marked by spatially differentiated cultural manifes- tations in the different regions. He ascribed these differences to the isolation of human groups and/or environmental factors. In the Angara River valley, Verkholenskaia Gora, Ushkanka, Badai, and the up- per assemblage of Mal'ta were assigned to this final stage, while in the Yenisei River region, the upper layer of Afontova Gora II, Afontova IV, Layers B and C of Biriusa, Buzunovo, Pereselencheskii Punkt, Kokorevo I, II and IV, Lepeshkino, and Gremiachii Kliuch, among others, were thought to represent a slightly different variant of the same final stage. The handful of Trans-Baikal and Altai sites known at the time were summarily assigned to this final phase as well. Sosnovskii's stadial concept served as the basis for Okladnikov's scheme of Siberian Paleolithic pre- history. During the 1950s, Okladnikov identified two "cycles" of cultural evolution in the Siberian Upper Paleolithic, termed the Early, or Maltinian Stage, and the Late, or Afontovian Stage. Okladni- kov argued that during the earlier phase, lithic as- semblages were similar to those of Europe, while during the later phase - from the time the Afontova Gora sites were occupied onward - a revival of macrolithic technology was apparent (Okladnikov 1950). He argued that subsistence change was re- sponsible for this change in lithic technology, be- lieving that all of the Final Pleistocene industries could be treated as a single cultural entity, or cul- tural province, spanning from Altai to Lena and Sel- enga. In spite of the appearance of local names of industries in different portions of Siberia, Okladni- kov continued to believe in the essentially homoge- neous character of the Final Pleistocene culture in northern and central Asia. In his later years, he re- marked: "one can label the Siberian Upper Paleo- lithic culture the Afontova in the Yenisei, the Verkholenskaia Gora in the Angara, the Shishkino in the Lena, and the Oshurkovo in the Selenga" (Okladnikov 1968:146). The rapid accumulation of data from 1950 to 1960 coincided with significant changes in the methodological approach of Russian prehistorians. In an important development during the 1950s, Ro- gachev (1953) challenged the stadial models out- lined above. Based on the excavation of numerous multi-component sites at Kostenki, along the Don River, he identified discrepancies between the "stages" identified by the then popular stadial mod- els, and actual variability in the archaeological rec- ord. In his earlier works, Rogachev regarded assemblage variability as a reflection of particular idiosyncratic features of culture, referable to sepa- rate bands or isolated population groups (Rogachev 1953). Later, he introduced the notion of "local cul- ture" to explain the variability (Rogachev 1957). In the 1960s, he defined assemblage variability as a re- flection of tribal or ethnic communities, following</page><page sequence="3">VasU'ev: Final Paleolithic in Northern Asia 5 the dominant view of Soviet prehistorians of the time (Rogachev 1964). Later, however, he rejected the connection between tribes or tribal unions and local archaeological cultures, as well as the idea that the actual history of the Paleolithic could be recon- structed. This prompted his statement: "prehistoric archaeology ... is obliged to study social [and] his- torical process only in a hypothetical and schematic way, adhering only to the fundamentals of a histori- cal approach and does not attempt to describe the 'concrete' history of bands and tribes" (Rogachev 1979:4). Rogachev's notion of "local culture" was hotly debated during the 1950s, and several leading fig- ures of Soviet archaeology opposed his views (Bo- riskovskii 1957; Efimenko 1958). Eventually, how- ever, his concept of local culture was widely adopted in Paleolithic research, especially during the 1960s and 1970s, and Siberian Paleolithic ar- chaeology underwent a major paradigmatic change. Dozens of local cultures were identified for the Pa- leolithic, linked to different territories and periods. Such change is clearly seen in Abramova's early writings (e.g., Abramova 1966), in which she pre- sents a scheme concerning the development of Sibe- rian Paleolithic cultures, essentially based on the concept of local culture. Contemporary Models and Problems The concept of the local culture1 is still prevalent in Siberian Paleolithic research. In fact, it forms the ba- sis for the two most dominant frameworks for ex- plaining archaeological patterning in the Siberian Paleolithic: those of Abramova and Mochanov (dis- cussed in greater detail below). Of the two, Abramo- va's arguments show an underlying assumption of the use of local cultures more or less explicitly, by stating ". . . the lithic and bone inventory is an indi- cator of the cultural identity of assemblages, rather than [an indicator of] cultural succession of the lat- ter" (Abramova 1972:255). Thus, this notion of the local culture is nothing more than a variant of a culture-historical model. Whatever the validity of such reasoning, the concept of local culture is the building block of "ex- planation" in Siberian Paleolithic research. Abramo- va's (1975) account of the Siberian Paleolithic is probably the most widely accepted "explanation." In it, she used hierarchically organized subdivisions of the Upper Paleolithic. Conceiving of the Siberian Paleolithic as a single cultural zone, she subdivided it into several large culture areas, each characterized by similar local cultural patterns. Thus, the South Siberian Culture Area embraces the Altai (the Srostki culture), Yenisei (the Afontova and Koko- revo cultures), and Trans-Baikal (the Oshurkovo culture) regions. The Middle Siberian, or Angara- Chulym, Culture Area (Abramova 1984) includes the Mal'ta-Buret' culture of Angara, and its vari- ants dispersed throughout the Chulym (the Achin- skaia Culture) and Tom' basins (Tomskaia), as well as such Yenisei River sites as Tarachikha and Afanas'eva Gora. She argued that the upper compo- nent of Krasnyi lar I and Fediaevo could be con- sidered a subsequent development of the Mal'ta culture. The Northeast Culture Area is represented by industries of the Dyuktai and Makarovo type. In her later writings (Abramova 1989), how- ever, Abramova's model as summarized above was modified considerably. Along with local archaeolog- ical cultures, she now proposed the concept of "cul- tural entities." A cultural entity is not the same as a culture area; many entities may exist together within a single area. To clarify, she provided two examples of such entities: Afontova and Dyuktai. If Abramova has a tendency toward minimal subdivisions of raw data, Mochanov (1977) presents an even simpler model. To him, the single most im- portant indicator for the classification of Upper Paleolithic industries is the presence/absence of bifacially flaked foliate points and knives. Thus, Mochanov recognized only two broad cultural traditions - or trajectories of cultural development - throughout the vast territory of northern Asia: Mal'ta-Afontova and Dyuktai. However, Mochanov did not specify which recognized local cultures were included in each tradition, and simply stated "... more detailed analysis could reveal that the Kokorevo and Srostki Local Cultures are no more than local facies of the Afontova Culture" (Mo- chanov 1977:226). Mochanov further recognized that these two traditions followed their own very broad spatial distributions, so that he could also define two culture provinces - Western and East- ern - which correspond to the Mal'ta-Afontova and Dyuktai traditions, respectively. The border between the two lies in the Angara River basin, which Mo- chanov saw as an intermediate or transitional area where the Verkholenskaia culture of the Dyuktai tra- dition coexisted with the Mal'ta-Badai culture of the Mal'ta-Afontova tradition. Finally, Mochanov argued that the Eastern Culture Province encompassed not only Yakutia, but also Sakhalin Island and part of the Japanese archipelago. One of the main obstacles hampering Siberian Paleolithic research is a lack of adequate methodolo- gies for handling such a huge mass of data, spread over such a wide area. The approach based on par- ticulars of "local culture," described above, remains dominant in Siberian prehistoric archaeology. In this approach, emphasis is given to the identifica- tion of local manifestations of material culture. Con- sequently, confronted by such a large body of data, many researchers tend to observe and interpret data within a narrow spatial range, and efforts at inter- regional comparison have been minimal in recent years. The current situation in Russian archaeology</page><page sequence="4">6 Arctic Anthropology 38:2 is similar to the old American debate between the "lumpers" and "splitters" (Taylor 1948:125). Over thirty years ago, Boriskovskii offered a warning to his colleagues. It was appropriate then, and it ap- plies equally well to the current situation of Russian archaeology. For a long time, Soviet scholars have not paid ap- propriate attention to the detailed study of concrete peculiarities of Paleolithic assemblages, [as well as to] their grouping and their connections and inter- relations . . . and that is why these problems need special attention now. All this is true. But mistakes and deficiencies in the development of the science might and ought to be corrected in the process . . . but not by going from one extreme to another. (Bo- riskovskii 1969:11-12) A lithic assemblage reflects a number of inter- related factors. Not only do cultural or stylistic dif- ferences create variation in the composition of assemblages, but mere differences in excavation technique might be responsible as well. In Russian archaeology, the importance of considering incom- plete data is often acknowledged on an abstract level, but in actuality the majority of researchers tend to regard their data sets as complete. Under such an assumption, similarities and differences in assemblages can only reflect "cultural" differences. Too often, there is not even a consideration of func- tional differences between sites or assemblages within a single culture. This concern has been ex- pressed by Clark, who has noted: Many Soviet workers were, and continue to be, in- clined to take the archaeological record pretty much at face value. They appear to operate on the as- sumption that archaeological remains are primarily reflective of cultural entities of some kind (that is, identity-conscious social units). Patterns in stone tool assemblages are explained in cultural terms: the stone tool reflects actual groups of people who shared and participated in lithic manufacturing tra- ditions over time. From an American perspective, there are obvious problems with this approach. (Clark 1988:4) As discussed above, the prehistory of Siberia is still interpreted within a framework of an out- dated culture-historical approach. Recently, how- ever, the validity of this approach has been questioned with increasing frequency, following more detailed studies that have identified a great deal of both inter-site and intra-site assemblage vari- ability (e.g., Kholiushkin 1981; Petrin 1986). Ulti- mately, such studies will likely portray an accurate picture of the complexities of the Siberian archaeo- logical record, but they will also demonstrate that this complexity cannot be explained by the prevail- ing interpretive models. Final Paleolithic Siberia: An Overview Beginning around 16,000 or 15,000 B.P., abundant archaeological data are available from the different regions of Siberia. As such, many syntheses and ex- planations of patterning in those data have been proposed (Fig. 1). Among these studies, "Afontova culture" is probably one of the most familiar and most commonly used terms (Abramova 1966; Astakhov 1966a). Lithic assemblages assigned to the Afontova culture are characterized by those features which have long been viewed as the most unique traits of the Siberian Upper Paleolithic in general. These features include a flake technology based on heavy, single and double platform cores, a domi- nance of sidescrapers, including bifacial examples, endscrapers, and pieces Ã©squillÃ©es. In addition, as- semblages may contain various types of retouched flakes, notched and denticulated tools, rare small points, borers, backed bladelets, and choppers. Sites of the Afontova culture are densely clus- tered along the Yenisei River, and form three groups. The northern group includes the Afontova Gora localities proper (Figs. 2, 3), Listvenka, Kacha I, Pereselencheskii Punkt, Karaul'nyi Byk, Shalunin Byk, and Biriusa I. The central group found along the middle Yenisei River, the sites of Kokorevo E, HI, IVA and VI, Kurtak IE, Divnyi I, Pervomaiskoe E, and Tashtyk I and II are also assigned to the Afontova culture. To this central group can be added such localities in the Minusinsk Depression as Tagarskii Ostrov and Sosnovoe Ozero. Finally, Maininskaia (Figs. 4, 5), Ui E, Sizaia VEI, Mainin- skii Lesozavod, Kantegir, and Dzhoi form the south- ernmost cluster of sites assigned to the Afontova culture. Final Paleolithic industries similar to the Afontova culture technologies are common to the west of the Yenisei River as well. Examples may be found at Starokuznetsk and Ail in the Kuzbass re- gion, Mogochino I along the Ob' River, and Srostki, Maima, and Urozhainaia in the piedmont of the Al- tai. This might suggest the presence of a single cul- ture throughout these regions. To the east, in the vicinity of Lake Baikal, the Badai localities also share many features in common with the more typi- cal Afontova sites, but the sites contain variants of wedge-shaped cores that are lacking in the Yenisei River basin. There are also clear similarities in lithic tech- nology and typology between the site of Oshur- kovo in the Selenga River basin, and the typical Afontova-type assemblages along the Yenisei River. Shared features include endscrapers made on flakes, sidescrapers, and pieces Ã©squillÃ©es, as well as pebble tools, micro-endscrapers, bifacial half moon-shaped sidescrapers, and a distinctive ventral thinning tech- nique on the distal end of sidescrapers.

For example, in many cases the striking platforms of microcores were prepared by removing elongated flakes, rather than by retouch along the edge to be transformed into a striking platform. As a result, there is a higher frequency of wedge-shaped cores of the elongated type in the sites located further to east, in the An- gara and Trans-Baikal regions, than in Yenisei River and Altai sites. In addition, Oshurkovo, an eastern site, contains a fair number of choppers whose working edges were formed on the long end of cob- bles, a trait that is rarely reported from the Yenisei River region. The presence of harpoons is also noted for the Lake Baikal area. Abramova (1966) defined another tradition dat- ing to the Final Paleolithic, termed the Kokorevo culture. It, too, is centered in the middle Yenisei River Valley, positioned alongside the Afontova cul- ture, but was thought to be slightly younger in age. The Kokorevo culture is defined on the basis of a highly developed blade technology, using large, elongated cores, some of which look almost pris- matic. Retouched blades, Mousterian-like points, and endscrapers made on blades are also common, but microlithic endscrapers are absent. Pieces Ã©s- quillÃ©es are less abundant than in the Afontova cul- ture, and they are not microlithic. Some of the sidescrapers are made from exhausted cores, but bi- facial scrapers and retouched bladelets - found in the Afontova culture - are lacking. Antler points in the Kokorevo culture usually display a flattened cross-section, and the tradition also includes flat, dagger-like tools with insets and needle-like points. An important hallmark and distinguishing trait of the Kokorevo culture is a distinctive variety of hearth, which is surrounded by slabs of stone to form a rosette. Sites assigned to the Kokorevo culture include Kokorevo I (Figs. 6, 7) and IVB, Novoselovo VI and VII, the middle component of Novoselovo XIII, Aeshka I and III, Chegerak, Cheremushka, Kruto- gorskoe I, Pervomaiskoe I, Podgornoe Ozero, and the middle component of Listvenka. Analyses of these sites suggest that there are few apparent differences in assemblage composition between the sites of the core area of the Kokorevo culture and sites within the Yenisei River drainage to the north and south (such as Druzhinikha and lime). This distribution of sites raises an impor- tant question regarding the existence of similar, Kokorevo-like assemblages in areas other than the Yenisei region. The assemblage of Shumikha in the Tom' River basin, for example, shares a number of features in common with the Kokorevo culture, though the data are too scanty to permit a reliable comparison. Even more surprising, however, is the striking similarity between the core Kokorevo cul- ture sites and the site of Shul'binka, located not in Siberia, but in the upper Irtysh River valley of east- ern Kazakhstan, nearly 1000 km to the southeast. Although published accounts (Taimagambetov 1987) are unclear and somewhat controversial, Shul'binka apparently contains three cultural layers embedded in the upper loam deposits of the 35 to 40m terrace of the Irtysh River. The assemblages contain single, double, and triple platform cores, conical cores, butt-ended and wedge-shaped microcores, re- touched blades, side- and endscrapers made on blades, pebble scrapers, Mousterian-like points, bor- ers, choppers, and hammerstones. Based on Taima- gambetov's (1987) illustrations, the stone tools of Shul'binka look identical to those associated with Kokorevo culture sites. As seen, both of the Final Paleolithic cultures of the Yenisei River valley - Afontova and Koko- revo - have counterparts situated far from the river basin itself. What remains uncertain, however, is the relationship between the two cultures, or whether, as Okladnikov (1981) has suggested, the notion of two distinct cultures is even valid. Interestingly, dif- ferences between the two are restricted mainly to details of lithic technology2 and the relative fre- quency of different tool classes. Of the two, the use of relative frequencies is inadequate, for tool fre- quencies can fluctuate from site to site depending on the function of the locality. Since there might very well be spatially segregated functional variation within a single cultural horizon, or between differ- ent horizons of a single site occupied by people of the same culture at different times, chance excava- tion of certain portions of a site would result in the production of assemblages of apparently different composition. As such, an index of relative frequen- cies of tools alone is inadequate for "cultural" iden- tification. The technological differences between the Afontova and Kokorevo cultures may be more meaningful than relative frequency indices. The Kokorevo culture is dominated by large, mainly elongated, single and double platform blade cores. Many bear traces of radial preparation of the strik- ing platform, although this can be found in some assemblages of the Afontova culture as well. Some- times the cores closely resemble prismatic cores, but details of the reduction sequence demonstrate that they clearly are not prismatic cores. Techniques of blade production naturally affect the composition of toolkits, and in the Kokorevo culture, this ac- counts for the high proportion of retouched blades and elongated, Mousterian-like points. Microcores are similar in both the Kokorevo and Afontova cul- tures, but Kokorevo-related sites do not contain pen- cil-shaped cores and microcores made on elongated bladelets. Despite these differences in lithic technol- ogy, however, upon closer inspection it becomes clear there is much more variation between and among assemblages of both cultures than the current</page><page sequence="11">Vasil'ev: Final Paleolithic in Northern Asia 13 Figure 6.

Vasil'ev 1992). As seen, the Final Paleolithic of the Yenisei re- gion is quite complex. In general, Kokorevo cultural assemblages are relatively cohesive while there is much more variability in assemblages assigned to the Afontova culture. However, depending on the tool types or technological attributes chosen to form "cultural" groups, different configurations can be obtained, for there is no single distinguishing crite- rion for identifying an assemblage as belonging to either one cultural tradition or the other. Further- more, patterns of variation for many traits appear to be space-dependent rather than culture-dependent. For example, axe- or adze-like heavy-duty tools are widely distributed in the middle Yenisei River re- gion regardless of the general characteristic of the assemblage - and regardless of whether the site is assigned to Afontova or Kokorevo - but they are ab- sent in the upper Yenisei River region. Overall, it seems more appropriate to view the similarities and differences between (and within) the Afontova and Kokorevo cultures as the kind of variation expected within a single "cultural" tradition, rather than that expected between different cultures. At this time, there are a few additional indica- tions that this explanation does indeed account for the variation in the Siberian prehistoric record. Be- rezovyi Ruchei I (Vishniatskii et al. 1986) produced an assemblage which, in general, resembles those found in so called "typical" Afontova culture sites, but it also contains large endscrapers made on blades, retouched bladelets, and flattened, inset ant- ler tools, all of which are diagnostic of the Kokorevo culture. Similarly, the site of Kokorevo IVB (Asta- khov 1966b) contains a lithic industry that is clearly Afontova-like, but the site also produced a typical Kokorevo-type hearth. Upon closer inspection, then, it appears that there is no firm basis for viewing the Siberian Final Paleolithic as a dichotomy of two cultures. On the contrary, following the same logic used by Siberian researchers, it might be better to return to the con- cept of a single Yenisei culture, with a number of variants and transitional phases. Undoubtedly, with the accumulation of more sites the number of vari- ants will continue to increase, making it even more difficult to adhere to the scheme of two distinct cul- tures. This model of a single culture is not new. It was originally proposed by Astakhov (1966a), and prompted a comment by Okladnikov that is still rel- evant: There is no cause for surprise concerning the fact, as observed by Z. A. Abramova, of quantitative dif- ferences in stone industries between individual oc- cupations in the Yenisei, particularly considering the general socio-cultural pattern of life of prehis- toric people at this time. They probably lived in small bands, much like an "atom." Each band would have its own peculiarities, reflected in the characteristics of technology, tool types and dwell- ing construction. Small bands of this kind coexisted for centuries and millennia, occupied the same sites, interacted, mixed, interrelated, joined together or separated. All of the lithic assemblages, which are qualitatively very similar, are quantitatively dis- similar, so that what we see is a complex, mosaic- like picture, very different from that of later prehis- toric periods. (Okladnikov 1981:113) The above discussion applies primarily to the Yenisei River region. In other areas of Siberia there are many additional industries contemporaneous with the Afontova and Kokorevo cultures. Unfortu- nately, even less is known about the prehistory of these other regions, but they also must be consid- ered to fully understand the complexity of the Sibe- rian Paleolithic. One of these Siberian cultures is the so-called Bedarevo culture (Markin 1986) identified in the Tom' River valley and represented by the sites of Shorokhovo I, Il'inka II, and Bedarevo II. Given that the assemblages are based on a blade technology, with retouched blades, burins, and peculiar heavy- duty core tools, they resemble the Kokorevo culture more than the Afontova culture. In the Altai region, the Final Paleolithic Srostki-type culture (Fig. 8) coexisted with a blade- let industry, as evidenced by Denisova Cave, Layer 9, and Ushlep IE. Within the Katun' River valley of the Altai, a lack of precise chronological control makes it difficult to clarify the details of the Final Paleolithic occupation (Kungurov 1993). Though there are presumed Final Paleolithic sites, the possi- bility must not be ruled out that some of these may be younger, early Holocene manifestations. The characteristics of the Final Paleolithic in the middle Angara River region also remain uncer- tain. The mixture of layers at Ust'Kova makes it im- possible to work out the characteristics of the different occupations (Drozdov and Laukhin 1990). Compared to the middle Angara River region, rela- tively more information is available for the upper Angara River basin. Here, two cultural traditions assigned to the Final Paleolithic (or "Early Meso- lithic" when following the terminology of Irkutsk researchers) are identified (Aksenov 1980; Medve- dev 1971). One is known as the Badai culture, which includes assemblages from Cheremushnik I and II, Badai I, Peresheek, Kholmushino, Kulakovo, the lower layers of Ust'Belaia (Fig. 9), Layer 3 of Sosnovyi Bor, and probably Layer I of Mal'ta and Fediaevo. The Badai culture is characterized by double platform and discoidal cores, medium- sized wedge-shaped microcores, and bifacial and pointed sidescrapers. The second identified cul- ture is known as the Verkholenskaia culture, identi- fied from Verkholenskaia Gora I (Fig. 10) and II, and surface finds from Kamenka I, II, and IE.

Differences be- tween these two cultures - seen primarily in tech- niques of microcore shaping and harpoon form - are minimal, and they are more similar to each other than either is to the Yenisei cultural manifestations. Although little is known of the Final Paleo- lithic in the upper Lena River region, the Makarovo localities (Fig. 11) reflect typical characteristics of the Siberian late Upper Paleolithic. For this reason, Aksenov (1974:110) stated that ". . . there are no forms peculiar [solely] to the Makarovo Culture. Practically all of them occur among the Angara as- semblages." In the western Trans-Baikal, the Final Paleo- lithic is characterized by the coexistence of Afon- tova-like industries (e.g., Oshurkovo) and blade assemblages, as seen at Studenoe I (Fig. 12) and Ust'Menza I and II. The eastern Trans-Baikal has been less explored archaeologically than the west- ern area, but apparently Final Paleolithic assem- blages with foliate bifaces (e.g., Sokhatino IV; Okladnikov and Kirillov 1980) have been found there. In Yakutia, Mochanov (1977) defined the Dyuktai culture on the basis of flattened single and double platform cores, discoidal cores, and wedge- shaped microcores, in association with bifacial knives, foliate points, endscrapers on flakes, side- scrapers, burins, and borers. The age of these Aldan region sites, however, is a matter of debate. Certain scholars (e.g., Abramova 1984; Yi and Clark 1985) are inclined to believe that the early radiocarbon dates (ca. 35,000 to 24,000 yrs. B.P.) on wood from Ust'Mil' II and Ikhine II are incorrect. During fluvial deposition, pieces of wood can disperse through dif- ferent levels, thereby rendering the association be- tween dated wood and cultural remains unclear. Given the problems in dating and association, the firmest conclusion that can be drawn is that there is no unambiguous evidence of the Dyuktai culture in Siberia greater than 18,000 to 17,000 years B.P. Regardless of its age, confusion also surrounds the composition of the Dyuktai industry. If the definition of the Dyuktai culture is based on the assemblage from Dyuktai Cave (Figs. 13, 14), few sites can be attributed to this culture. Sites such as Ust'Mil' E, Ikhine I and II, Ezhantsy, Maiorych, and Berelekh, which are often assigned to the Dyuktai culture, actually do not contain characteristic Dyuk- tai artifacts, but merely wedge-shaped microcores. These sites can only be called Dyuktai-like when the presence of wedge-shaped cores is taken as the hallmark of the culture. This, in fact, is what Mo- chanov (1977) does when he assigns all of the Pleis- tocene localities of Yakutia to the Dyuktai culture. There is no justification, however, for assigning all the lithics from the sites of the region to the Dyuktai culture, since wedge-shaped cores are found widely throughout Siberia and they probably are not a char- acteristic of the Dyuktai culture alone. A similar problem surrounds foliate points, which are often viewed as the most characteristic tool of the Dyuktai Cave assemblage, and hence of the Dyuktai culture. A wide variety of foliate bifaces are reported from Dyuktai-associated sites, includ- ing laurel-leaf, sub-triangular, oval, and elongated willow-leaf pieces. However, while the Aldan sites have certainly produced the most beautiful exam- ples of foliate points in Siberia, they do occur in other parts of northern Asia. For example, leaf- shaped bifaces very similar to Dyuktai types are known from Nian'gi and Sokhatino IV in the Trans- Baikal, Verkholenskaia Gora I, and other sites in the Angara River basin, Strizhova Gora in the Kan River basin, and even at Tiumechin IV in the Altai. Given this, Mochanov's (1977) dichotomy of "unifacial" versus "bifacial" industries for describing the Sibe- rian Paleolithic seems to be more a result of applying different classificatory schemes than a de- scription of real archaeological patterning. While bi- facial technology does indeed predominate in the Northeast, bifaces occur in other cultural areas as well, and are probably not a diagnostic trait of any single industry. For instance, many of the Afontova assemblages contain bifaces, and though they are usually classified as bifacial scrapers rather than knives, they look almost exactly like the Dyuktai fo- liates. Given this overlap in typology and technol- ogy, the so called Dyuktai culture appears to be nothing more than a variant of the more general Si- berian Upper Paleolithic, though one which is cer- tainly rich in foliate forms. Discussion As demonstrated above, it seems that the Final Pa- leolithic assemblages of Siberia, despite their appar- ent variations, generally overlap in technology and typology. Given their basic homogeneity, they might be treated best as a single "cultural entity" with the following characteristics. 1. Informal single and double platform cores, commonly manufactured from cobbles and pebbles, with flakes and blades removed by parallel blows are often present. Though less common, the more archaic Levallois and ra- dial cores are found as well. 2. Various wedge-shaped and butt-ended micro- cores are ubiquitous throughout the area. 3. "Fully developed" Upper Paleolithic tool types are commonly found with more archaic forms. Although Abramova (1975) believed that this coexistence was limited to the South Siberian Culture Area, it can be seen through- out northern Asia during the Final Paleolithic.</page><page sequence="18">20 Arctic Anthropology 38:2 Figure 11.

Throughout this enormous area, prehistoric men lived in light, above-ground huts . . . [and] there was distributed an astoundingly homogeneous fundamental culture of the Late Paleolithic tribes. (Okladnikov 1968:69) Of course, not all of the sites are identical and there are, for example, some assemblages with a blade technology based on prismatic cores. Exam- ples may be found at Golubaia I (Fig. 15) in the Yenisei and Ushlep El in the Altai. In contrast to the more informal blade core technologies found elsewhere, these assemblages display a greater de- gree of "classical" Upper Paleolithic traits. On the other hand, as the upper component of Krasnyi lar I demonstrates, sometimes elements from older tradi- tions persist and coexist with new traits. Such varia- tion, however, is to be expected, and it is probably impossible to define "cultural entities" or "local cultures" during the Final Paleolithic of Siberia which have clear, non-overlapping spatio-temporal boundaries. Given the gigantic area under consideration, however, there likely are traits that can be used to define culture areas in the future, though on a very large scale. One such attribute is the wedge-shaped core. Wedge-shaped microcores, with platforms prepared by a single longitudinal blow, are found primarily in the eastern portion of Siberia (i.e., Ya- kutia, Trans-Baikal, and the Angara River basin) and westward to the Kan River. In contrast, cores in the Yenisei and Altai regions display platforms formed by multiple, often wide and short retouch flakes. Similarly, the distribution of transverse burins tends to be limited to eastern Siberia, although there are some finds in the Yenisei region, and bone har- poons are only reported from the vicinity of Lake Baikal and the Kan River valley. At this point, the cultural significance of these patterns is not clear. Another interesting point is that many of the Final Paleolithic industries continue into the early Holocene, and there seems to be no significant change in the composition of toolkits correspond- ing to the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary. Given this, there has been much debate concerning the Mesolithic, or Epi-Paleolithic period in Siberia (Med- vedev et al. 1975; Okladnikov 1966). Depending on the point of view, either the Upper Paleolithic traditions persisted into the Holocene, as argued by Okladnikov, or the Mesolithic traditions began before the end of Pleistocene, as a number of re- searchers in Irkutsk believe. Thus, Okladnikov prefers to use the term "Epi-Paleolithic" to describe these early Holocene assemblages, while others stick to the notion of a "Pleistocene Mesolithic." Debate over the details of the two viewpoints need not be treated here at length. In essence, both sides rec- ognize a single cultural entity, in which the early Holocene assemblages represent the younger end of a continuum beginning in the terminal Pleistocene. To conclude, it might be worthwhile to ad- dress the spatial limits of the Siberian Final Paleo- lithic, as defined above. It is clear that these characteristics are found from the Altai, and proba- bly from eastern Kazakhstan, all the way to Trans- Baikal and Yakutia. The primary concern, then, is to define the southern and western boundaries of this cultural entity. Given a lack of data, the southern frontier remains obscure. It is hoped that future re- search in southern Siberia, Mongolia, northern China, and the Russian Far East will clarify this pic- ture. The western boundary is better defined than the southern one. A quick examination of the lithics from major western Siberian localities, such as Chernoozer'e II (Fig. 16), Shikaevka E, Vengerovo V, and Novo-Tartasskaia, shows that they are quite dis- tinct from the eastern Siberian finds. While the characteristics of living floors and structural features at Chernoozer'e II are similar to those found in east- ern Siberia, western Siberian industries are essen- tially based on a prismatic blade core technology. Choppers do occur, as do "microlithic implements" (Petrin 1986) resembling core preforms, though these are rare. Sidescrapers and Mousterian-like points - distinctively Siberian types - are absent. On the other hand, geometric microliths are seldom found to the east, beyond western Siberia. A single crescent-shaped piece is known from Denisova Cave, and truncated, rectangular bladelets were col- lected from Ushlep III, but these are the only known occurrences of these types of implements. In gen- eral, Final Paleolithic assemblages of western Siberia resemble those from Europe. The Ob' River basin, then, can be regarded as the western frontier of the Siberian Paleolithic. Final Paleolithic assemblages from the south- ern portion of the Russian Far East (e.g., Ustinovka I [Fig. 17]), and Sakhalin Island demonstrate a pecu- liar sequence similar to that seen in Japan and Ko- rea. Chemical analyses of obsidian artifacts from the site of Sokol on Sakhalin Island show that the mate- rials were derived from Hokkaido, while analysis of obsidian samples from Ustinovka I on the Russian mainland, indicates Pektusen on the Korean Penin- sula as the most likely source (Kuzmin et al. 1999). Sites throughout this area display many technologi- cal similarities as well. For example, Sokol pro- duced a number of Horoko and Yubetsu cores, types</page><page sequence="23">Vasil'ev: Final Paleolithic in Northern Asia 25 Figure 15. Golubaia I (after Astakhov 1986).

Yubetsu core preforms were also identified at Imchin I, also on Sakhalin Is- land, and Moro knives - another characteristic of Japanese assemblages - were found at Ustinovka I. Given these and other similarities, Golubev and Lavrov (1988) argue for a correlation between the Sakhalin assemblages and the Sirataki and Tovaru- betsu cultures of northern Japan. During the Final Pleistocene, then, it seems that a broad culture area, united by raw material exchange networks, existed in this region. The spatial extent of this tradition, however, remains far from clear, and more research, particularly along the Amur River drainage, is needed to fully delineate its northern frontier. Summary and Conclusions In sum, patterning in the lithic assemblage variation in the Paleolithic of Siberia cannot be adequately described within a "local culture" framework, based on the assumption of the existence of regionally dis- crete culture units in the Upper Paleolithic. If this were the case, morphologically similar assemblages would tend to cluster within limited spatial bound- aries. This is not the case in the Final Paleolithic of Siberia, as similar assemblages occur over a very wide area. It seems that the diversity of "local fa- cies" might simply be an illusion, a function of the random and fragmentary nature of the available evi- dence. Only small artifact samples are available for extrapolation to the presumably complicated net- work of interaction and complex material culture of the Siberian Paleolithic hunters. The illusion of sep- arate cultural groups may disappear with the accu- mulation of more data and a better ability to bridge the gap between the archaeological record and the prehistoric past.
