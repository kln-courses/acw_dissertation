The investigation of religious symbolism in the early Aegean, the stated goal of Lucy Goodison's book, de- mands a certain scholarly courage. The author herself ad- mits that every generation of scholars tends to turn away from those areas of study "in which its predecessors most obviously made idiots of themselves," leading to lacunae in scholarship [xii, quoting West 1975: 15]. Although material designated as religious abounds in Bronze Age Aegean studies, little theory has been articulated to struc- ture work on the subject (see Renfrew 1985 for a notable exception), and religion and ritual still often stand as "ex- planations" for puzzling archaeological conundrums. Re- cent work on prehistoric Greek religion has often focused on the identification and elucidation of cult practice and place (e.g., van Leuven 1978; Higg and Marinatos 1981; Gesell 1985; Rutkowski 1986) rather than on the sym- bolic infrastructure of religious thought itself, as mani- fested in the archaeological record. Within this context, Goodison's book constitutes a ma- jor contribution to the study of Aegean religion. The author's central thesis is that solar symbolism represents an important-and previously overlooked-aspect of pre- historic Greek religion. Far from looking strictly at solar imagery in the archaeological record, however, she at- tempts to sketch the cognitive outlines of a vast universe encompassing attitudes toward death, women, fertility, nature, and divinity from the Early Bronze Age to the beginning of the Archaic period in Greece (ca. 3200-700 B.C.). She draws her material from the entire Aegean basin, focusing primarily on Crete and the Cyclades, and to a lesser extent the Greek mainland. The book is divided into a brief introduction, three chapters exploring the symbolism of regeneration in the Aegean through time, a concluding chapter entitled "How are symbols formed?" and an appendix on the Early Bronze Age Aegean as a cultural continuum. A full third of the volume is devoted to illustrations, many unfortunately of poor quality. There is no index. Goodison states at the outset that her intention is to trace specific symbols through time, and relate the changes observed to the socioeconomic structure of the society under consideration. She first challenges the assumption that anthropomorphic deities were the focus of early Ae- gean religion. Definitions of religion that refer to divine ruling powers or supernatural forces do not apply well to animistic religions, which impute a spiritual essence to natural phenomena such as the sun. In this way only does she prepare the reader for her own investigation of the symbolism of natural forces in the Aegean. Strikingly ab- sent is any theoretical perspective on her task: how exactly will she recognize and interpret religious symbols in social terms? How, indeed, are we to understand the concept of religion in the context of early societies? The only defini- tion of religion she offers (misattributed to Onians) is one that she dismisses, yet a replacement is not suggested. She briefly dissociates herself from structuralist efforts to elu- cidate religious beliefs, yet again offers the reader little substitute except a vague reference to the dynamic rela- tionship between a society and its symbols. To be fair, Goodison does not intend the introduction to serve as a theoretical orientation for the reader, considering it suffi-</page><page sequence="2">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 18, 1991 499 cient to explore theories of symbol use in her final chapter. Nevertheless, the intervening chapters, replete with inter- esting data and discussion, would have gained much in coherence from an explicit statement of the author's per- spective on her subject. In the first chapter, "Before the Mycenaeans," Goodison sets out to establish that the sun was a significant focus of Early Bronze Age religion. She challenges anew the early assumption that prehistoric religion was organized around a unified fertility goddess, a "mother-goddess," convinc- ingly demonstrating that whatever notions of female di- vinity may have existed were diffuse rather than centered in a single deity. Following Renfrew's (1985) lead, she argues that the symbolism of solar imagery can be revealed by attention to the contexts and associations of its ap- pearances. The very recognition of solar images, of course, presents a problem: circular and rayed motifs are ubiqui- tous in patterned decoration of many media. To Goodi- son's credit, she states explicitly her reference points for identifying motifs as solar: sun-motifs on Near Eastern cylinder seals, solar symbols in Egyptian religion, and motifs on Minoan hieroglyphic seals designated as suns by Sir Arthur Evans; each criterion, however, clearly car- ries its own problems of subjectivity and applicability. Nevertheless, having collected motifs possibly representing the sun, Goodison then looks at their presence on objects she would argue often carry "magico-religious signifi- cance"-sealstones and "frying-pans." The fiunerary contexts of many of her examples lead to a review of mortuary customs in the Early Bronze Age, focused primarily on the Mesara tholoi, in which she emphasizes among other aspects the circular form of tombs (wombs?), the "foetal" position of the corpse, and the eastern orientation of many graves. Evidence for the religious and funerary significance of the boat and the sea in the Aegean is raised; the presence of boat models in graves and iconographic juxtapositions on sealstones and "frying-pans" suggest to her that both sun and boat may have "stood as a shorthand for the journey ahead of the dead soul" [p. 38], an association of ideas well docu- mented in Egyptian and Mesopotamian religion and, as Goodison notes, a part of modern Greek fiunerary imagery. The common conjunction of pubic triangle, sun, and ma- rine images on "frying-pans," if we accept Goodison's (and others') identifications, together with the possibility that the vessel itself may represent an abstraction of the female body, is intriguing, although to my mind her subsequent leap from the association of motifs to their conflation- the sun at this time was conceived of as female-is un- founded. Further associations with images of vegetation may reflect a symbolic system common to many early agricultural societes, in which the fertility of the land is closely bound to human fecundity, and the cycles of the seasons and vegetation serve as a metaphor for the human cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. The frequent depiction of pithoi on sealstones, the production of vessels with female sexual attributes (e.g., the "goddess of Myrtos"), and the dual capacity of pithoi from the Neolithic on to store agricultural produce and the remains of the dead also figure in the author's elaborate structure of symbolic linkages. In Chapter 2, Goodison examines the religious sym- bolism of the later Bronze Age, first emphasizing elements of continuity from earlier periods (e.g., the role of women in ritual; the presence of solar imagery in funerary con- texts; marine, plant, and vessel symbolism) and then pro- ceeding to isolate new elements (e.g., the partial replace- ment of the boat with the chariot as a vehicle for the dead; the emergence of the sun as a male deity). The animistic tendencies of the Early Bronze Age suggested by scenes of people touching or dancing before natural elements- animals, stones, plants, tree, sun-are superseded by a pantheon of personified deities and the frequent represen- tation of animal sacrifice. Although she sketches a socio- economic context of Mycenaean militarism and stratifica- tion at the outset, the subsequent discussion of symbolism unfolds with hardly a glance back. "Into the Iron Age," Chapter 3, again highlights ele- ments of continuity and change in aspects of religious symbolism. To the archaeological evidence she now adds the texts of Homer and Hesiod: the sun continues to be associated with death, with rites conducted by women, with the boat, horse and chariot, bird, and fish. The as- similation of these elements to a male deity or deities, first apparent in the Late Bronze Age, continues. The discus- sion, as ever, ranges widely, from Pandora's jar to the distinction between spirit and matter, and the "numinous significance" attached to the number three. In the concluding chapter, Goodison discusses the for- mation of symbols, reviewing briefly universalist theories of meaning (structuralism), the work of Durkheim in re- lating symbolic classifications to the social order, and Marxist thought on the relationship between the means of production and the function and evolution of religious ideology. She advocates "a middle path," looking at sym- bols in the Aegean as an integral part of society, "never totally separable from material factors but positively in- teracting with them and merging with them" [p. 196]. In this spirit, she then points out "correlations" between the social structure and religious symbolism of the three pe- riods examined. Thus, the largely egalitarian (?) society of the agrarian Early Bronze Age communities, with its em-</page><page sequence="3">500 Book Reviews phasis on collectivity rather than individuality, is related to the observed affection for circular and triangular forms, from the shape of tholoi to the emphasis on pubic trian- gles, and to the circularity of time (or timelessness?) im- plied in the scheme of regeneration involving the cycles of the sun, vegetation, and the renewal of human life. The hierarchical structure of Mycenaean society, with differ- ential access to power, wealth, and land, and a marked division of labor between the sexes, is linked with the shift in religious iconography to graphic scenes of aggression among humans and upon animals, and to the emergence of personified deities. Finally, in the early Iron Age, in the face of a widening gap between rich and poor, and be- tween men and women, the religious symbolism also changes: Zeus now dominates with force, earth and sky are conceived of as distinct planes, and the sun assumes the attributes of a male god with pastoral associations, a watchman over the herds. "The sharp divide between sky and earth, male and female, purity and impure body func- tions, life and death, are as different from the circular symbolic system described [for the Early Bronze Age] as the sharp divide between social groups in this period is different from the apparently more egalitarian social or- ganizations of that earlier period" [p. 201]. Although Goodison's arguments are sometimes more intuitive than systematic, the scheme that she outlines, particularly for the Early Bronze Age, in which the rising and setting of the sun is conceptually linked with the regeneration of human, plant, and animal life, is ultimately plausible. Indeed, the complex manner in which symbols of fertility permeate mortuary ritual throughout the world has a long history of scholarship in the anthropology of religion, from Bachofen (1859) and Frazer (1890), to Eliade (1978) and Bloch and Parry (1982). Central to many religions is the denial of the apparent finality of death by declaring it a new beginning, and it is therefore surprising that Goodison does not place in historical per- spective her own inquiry into such a phenomenon. Also disappointing is her failure to interrelate in any depth social and symbolic perspectives on her material. The discrete summaries of social organization for each period serve largely as background and rarely figure in her discourse on symbolic structures. The wide field from which she draws her data encourages her to select those aspects that best reinforce her thesis: thus, while much is made of the contracted position of the dead in tombs facing east, no explanation is offered for westward facing, extended burials. Similarly, the presence of red ocher in some funerary contexts prompts the suggestion that a belief in the afterlife is reflected, the ocher functioning as a metaphor for the blood covering the newborn baby. Yet what of the variability of the archaeological record? Red ocher is found with a small minority of burials, an obser- vation that surely relates to the distribution of power within that society. That mortuary ritual and symbolism are shaped by beliefs and values current in the Bronze Age Aegean, as Goodison asserts, is undeniable, yet interpre- tation of those symbols must articulate their role in con- temporary social and political process. Although she states that symbols are "involved in a complex and dynamic relationship with other aspects of that society's life" [p. 196], she does not present contextual details necessary for an understanding of that relationship. Ultimately, my quarrel with the author centers on her interpretation and use of context. Her scale of analysis is enormous, reminiscent of Nilsson's seminal study (1950), resulting in generalizations drawn on the basis of examples widely separated in space and time. To take a diachronic view may require a broadly sketched context; yet why not focus on a smaller region, or even a single site, that we might have more confidence that a given set of symbols holds a common set of meanings? Why not explore in greater depth the archaeological details of the contexts of discovery, perhaps limiting the study to funerary contexts? The correlations between social context and world view that Goodison poses in her final few pages rest primarily on "common sense," a notoriously poor guide to the distant past. Why, after all, should it be an egalitarian social structure that generates triangular and circular im- agery? How, in that case, do we explain the continuing sanctity of such imagery (e.g., Hesiod's tripartite division of the universe, Homer's circular stream of Oceanus) into the markedly inegalitarian Iron Age? In the absence of explicit theory and detailed context, the author's correla- tions can stand as little more than interesting possibilities. The emphasis in much recent archaeology on logical propositions that can be empirically verified may have discouraged some from even approaching the issue of religion: prehistoric mortuary ritual, for example, al- though without doubt linked intricately to religious thought, is commonly discussed with little reference to the metaphysical at all (e.g., Jacobsen and Cullen 1981). A strength of Lucy Goodison's work is to remind us of the complex symbolism invested in the patterning of ma- terial remains. She has provided us with a wealth of icon- ographic associations for three periods of early Aegean history, and interpreted them in terms appropriate to the general contexts of each, wisely avoiding the temptation to read the earlier scanty data in terms of the later. Her argument that the sun, from early times on, played a part in religious ritual, together with other referents of fertility and regeneration, is convincing. I would like to see her</page><page sequence="4">Journal of FieldArchaeology/Vol. 18, 1991 501 next tackle the ways in which such symbolism articulates with social and political forces at a given time, and to consider further the ways in which that articulation is expressed in the archaeological record.
