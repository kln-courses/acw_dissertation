THE VISUA L ARTS: A HISTORY Hugh HONOUR John FLEMING From 30,000 B.C. to the present, art history is viewed and explored in relation to the history and culture of the time and place in which it was created. More than 250 color plates and over 695 black and white illustrations are effectively placed to corre- spond with the narrative. Using a chronological framework, emphasizing periods, representative works of art are treated in terms of their historical, social, and cultural context. Every aspect of art is touched upon, including the work of women artists, non-western art, architecture, and decorative arts, such as coins, textiles, pottery, and enamels. In their introduction, Honour and Fleming explain how to fully appreciate great works of art through approach and criticism. They also examine modern concepts about the purpose and meaning of art, in a text that will be apt for years to come. 1982, 640 pp., paper (94234-2) $19.95 cloth (94235-9) $30.00</page><page sequence="11">A WORLD OF ART AT YOUR FINGERTIPS FROM PRENTICE-HALL ART: A History of Changing Style Sara Cornell This lively and well-illustrated introduction to Western art skillfully explores how the evolution of art styles reflects the social, political, and economic devel- opments of specific historical eras from the ancient king- doms of the Near East to contemporary movements of the 1970s. 1983, approx. 456 pp., paper (04711-8) $19.95 cloth (04712-6) $35.00 MODERN ARCHITECTURE SINCE 1900 William J.

Harrison Introduction by the author; foreword by Peter Morse The Etchings of Odilon Redon is the definitive study of these prints and a project long overdue; there has been a need for a new catalogue raisonne since 1913, when Andre Mellerio published his volume. The scarcity of Redon's etchings is legendary (some are known in only one impression). Where Mellerio's early listing comprised only 37 states of 30 prints, Dr. Harrison has discovered 64 different states of 33 subjects. One of these plates was completely unknown until now and was printed for the first time in 1976 at her urging. With more than a hundred illustrations encompassing the progressive states of the etchings, the book reveals Redon's working methods in a way never before known. The early etchings, in particular, give us a new insight into the little-known period around 1865, when Redon worked closely with Rodolphe Bresdin. 10 .,o "I'' od,, it , e,40l : 0'k, w- A.- el vp3 _61 ,i ~, sOf 2f.- 71 Plate 22. TMte de jeune fille, circa 1886 Newly discovered print in collection of the author Redon's etchings hold a special place in his oeuvre, containing some of his most personal and disturbing images. For the surrealists, especially, these works presaged their own efforts to unite the real and the dream world; for the artist himself, the etchings were the only truly artistic medium, distinguished from the lithographs, which he considered primarily reproductive in nature. Dr. Harrison has traveled widely in the U.S. and Europe, visiting numerous museums and private collectors, and compiling new information on every aspect of the work. Her catalogue data include dates, measure- ments, states, editions (including restrikes), signatures, paper, technical notes, and identification of sub- jects (particularly ones that Redon chose to leave obscure). Much of this will be new even to the most experienced scholar. In addition, the book contains four previously unpublished letters from Redon to Bresdin (and a letter from Mme. Redon) regarding the etchings. There is also a detailed introductory essay-the first critical examina- tion ever made of these prints-as well as a concordance table, a bibliography, and a foreword by print scholar Peter Morse. This ground-breaking catalogue adds a new dimension to our understanding of Redon, this most complex and prophetic artist.
