<plain_text><page sequence="1">NONVERBAL COMMUNICATION AND PARATAXIS IN LATE ANTIQUITY In discussing the proper conduct of a young man, Cicero in De Officis includes a section on propriety in bodily movements and outward ap- pearance (I, 126-132). His discussion embraces manner of speech, clothing, gesture, posture, gait and facial expression. Cicero recognises that in his society people are judged by appearances as much as by what they say or achieve, and urges everyone with a concern for propriety to use the various nonverbal channels of information to present themselves in a favourable light '. In his Christianised version of the De Officis, composed c. 391, St. Ambrose had a section that parallels Cicero's discussion (I, 67-89). Ambrose's treatment is more expansive and has a different emphasis. Whereas Cicero stresses the avoidance of solecisms and the presentation of the inner self through external channels and glosses over the deception this may entail, Ambrose stresses the fidelity of nonverbal means for representing the true self 2 : "the attitude of the mind is seen in the bodily posture ... bodily movements are like the utterances of the soul" (I, 71). Observers therefore can rely on nonverbal evidence. Ambrose cites the offensive gait of two clergymen he once knew : both subsequently betrayed and rejected the orthodox faith (I, 73). Any artifice or insincerity, he believes, will be manifest and displeasing. Clergymen should, therefore, achieve the virtuous inner state that permits spontaneous and natural ' Indeed the educational system of classical antiquity, by the value it attached to role playing, encouraged interest in nonverbal behaviour. The distinction between presentation and representation of self is drawn and elabo- rated upon by J. Spiegel and P. Mechotka, Messages of the body , New York, 1974, pp. 3-6. Presentation is an act or performance : it can be unrelated to inner states. Cf. too D. Sless, Learning and visual communication , New York, 1981, p. 29, for the distinction between involuntary produced "information" and voluntary produced "communication". St. Augustine similarly distinguishes the "natural" and the "intentional" qualities of a signal (De Doc. Chris., II, 1, 2 ; 2, 3 ; 3, 4 ; De Trin ., XV, 10, 19 ; Conf, I, 8, 13).</page><page sequence="2">224 R. F. NEWBOLD nonverbal representation. Verbal and nonverbal expression should har- monise 3. Erich Auerbach, in his well known discussion of the world of Am- mianus, notes the gestural quality of many of Ammianus' scenes. Accor- ding to Auerbach, the literary vocabulary of the whole age became gestural and pictorial, replete with sensory imagery : objectivity, rationality, rhe- torical lucidity, good form and restraint give way to subjectivity, emotion, communication by gesture and posture ; and to the grotesque, the senso- rily vivid, and the "rhetorically horripilating" 4. Ancient rhetoricians were fully aware of the importance of optimizing every channel for sending messages 5. Even if one does not speak or move, one cannot help emitting information about oneself via posture, facial expression, clothing, hairstyle, skin colour, etc. Indeed, such fields of information will then be more avidly studied for clues. Deception and tension (the latter often being caused by the former) can be discerned in awkward, stilted behaviour, change of pace in speech or movement, stiffness, exaggerated gestures, alterations in voice pitch, etc. 6. Much of this information is exchanged subliminally but when inauthenticity is sensed it may intensify efforts to strip off the mask 7. And in late antiquity 3 This, the saintly relevation of inner qualities is a dominant theme in hagiographie literature and in works such as Eusebius' Vita Constantini. For a further example of Ambrose's expectations and interest in nonverbal communication, cf. Theodoret, Hist. Ecc., V, 17, where Ambrose wonders what gaze, gait and posture Theodosius would use in heaven. Mimesis , Princeton, 1953, p. 46. "A whole gallery of gruesomely grotesque and extremely sensory-graphic portraits can be culled from Ammianus' work" {ibid) and Auerbach cites XVI, 10 ; XVII, 1 1 ; XXI, 14 ; 16 ; XXV, 10 ; XXVI, 6-9 ; XXVIII, 1 ; XXIX, 2 ; XXX, 9 ; XXXI, 14. For the fullest ancient discussion, see Quint., XI, 3 : cf. Cíe., De Orat. , III, 59 ; Xen., Mem., III, 10, 1-5. In a different context, Ovid, Am ., I, 4, for example, shows how much can be communicated without words between lovers. (For a more censorious view of such signalling, cf. Jerome, Hil., 21). Cf. M. Critchly, The language of gesture, London, 1939, pp. 1-3, on the relationship between speech and gesture as discussed by Plato, Diodorus and Lucretius. W. Lamb and E. Watson, Body code.

Before proceeding to suggest why this might be so, it may be helpful to provide some concrete support for this intuition and to list most of the means by which information can be transmitted nonverbally between humans 8. 1. Gesture : gestures may be numerous or few, expansive or inhibited, free or stereotyped, jerky or smooth. 2. Posture : not just the altitude (lying, sitting, kneeling, standing) and attitude (or angle) of the position, but whether the person is relaxed or tense, steady or unsteady. 3. Facial expression : scowl, smile, nature of gaze. 4. Bodily adornment : clothing, cosmetics, hair or beard style, jewellery, insignia, tattoo. 5. Gait : manner and pace of locomotion. 6. Autonomic nervous system responses which reveal emotional states : blush, pale, horripílate, sweat, tremble, weep. 7. Silence. 8. Eye contact or avoidance : an important source of signals about fear and security, dominance and submission. 9. Spatial arrange- ments : arrangements of furniture or distance between bodies. 10. Odours. 11. Pictures : painting, sculpture, mosaic, engraving, diagrams. 12. Dance, mime. 13. Architecture. 14. Music. 15. Handwriting (graphology). 16. Tone, volume, timbre, pitch, speed of utterance. 17. Nonverbal human sounds : wail, snore, groan, whistle, etc. 18. Touch - self or others : kiss, embrace, stroke, hit, fidget, scratch. 19. Inanimate signalling devices: spears, arrows, stones, flags, mirrors, smoke. n. 135). But not always : Ammianus, IX, 9, 9 ; Jer., Ep ., 43, 2.

Evans [Physiognomies in the ancient world, in Trans, of Am. Philosophical Soc., 59 (1969), part 5] discusses and illustrates fourth century interest in these features as well as facial and body appearance. Deceit in the matter of countenance, insignia, costume etc. was a typical attribute of, inter alios , Satan, demons and heretics and was particularly troublesome to those who believed that inner virtue should and could be outwardly visible : Julian, Or., 3, 122 c-d ; Eunapius, Vit. Soph., 479 ; Prudentius, Peri., 2, 300 and Äthan., Vit. Ant., passim. See L. Forsdale, Nonverbal communication, New York, 1974 ; C. Wolff, A psy- chology of gesture, London, 1945 ; P. Ekman and W. V. Friesen, Unmasking the face, New Jersey, 1975. Information may be transmitted via dreams, telepathy or the genetic code. Abstract patterns or the designs of objects may also convey nonverbal information.</page><page sequence="4">226 R. F. NEWBOLD To check whether there was in late antiquity an increased sensitivity (at least among literates) to nonverbal cues, excerpts from seven authors were paired with same sized excerpts from seven authors active between 70 B.C. and A.D. 10. The Augustan Histories and Suetonius made an eighth pairing. The pairings were made on the basis of similarity of genre and (treatment of) subject matter 9. Of the nineteen nonverbal channels listed above, instances of numbers 1 to 7 were collected 10. The results below may not in themselves be probative but they confirm Auerbach's impres- sions and accord with other statistics that point to an increased late antique alertness to nonverbal behaviour ".As can be seen from the table below, the total score down the seven categories of every late author exceeds his earlier counterpart ; and across every category the combined total from the eight late authors exceeds the total from the earlier ones. ' (I) Cicero, De Offlciis, I, 33-6, 40, 61-2, 74-80, 84, 86-7, 102-4, 108-14, 126-31, 138-41 amounts to 495 lines of Loeb text. Ambrose, De Officiis Minis trorum, I, 65-105, 139-51, in J. P. Migne, Patrologia Latina, XV (Paris, 1887), contains the same number of words and deals with similar material (see p. 223 above). (II) Catullus, 64 (408 11.) and Claudian, Rap., I (288 11.) and II, 1-120 are mythological epyllia. (Ill) Ovid, Met., II, 833-75 ; III, 1-315 and IV, 563-603 (397 11.) deals with similar mythological material to Nonnus, Dion., I, 46-144 ; IV, 311-463 and V, 287-432. (IV) Livy, I, 49-60 (489 11. of Loeb text) and Ammianus, XIV, 1, 5, 7, 9-1 1 narrate tyrannical behaviour. (V) Virgil, Aen., XI, 1-409 and Prudentius, Psych., 1-409 narrate epic combats. (VI) Horace, Sat., I, 2 ; I, 5 ; II, 2 and II, 6 (41 1 11.) and Jerome, Ep., 40 ; 43 ; 125, 1-1 1 (quibus) in the Loeb edition satirise contemporary behaviour. (VII) Sallust., Cat, 14-32 (495 Loeb 11.) and Theodoret, HE, III, 1-16 (ed. J. J. Grynaeus, Basle, 1587) are hostile accounts of Catiline and Julian. (VIII) Suetonius, Dom., 3, 2 - 23, 2 (498 Loeb 11.) and SHA, Duo Gall., 1, 1 - 19, 8 are hostile imperial biographies. 10 In the samples, facial expression, no. 3, includes references to the appearance of the eyes, an important area within the primary field for conveying emotion, the face. Gait, no. 5, includes less normal forms of locomotion, such as crawling or limping or references where the manner or pace of the movement is stressed by means of adverbs or adverbial phrases or clauses : simple references to running, walking, going or hurrying were not counted. 11 In an analysis made for a separate study, I collected 400 11. samples from 7 epics and epyllia from the late Republic and early empire, and 7 from the late empire. The samples were made up of the first 100 11. of 4 different books, or from the first 400 11. in the case of epyllia. The nonverbal score for the early group was 238 (Catullus 64- 41, Virgil- 13, Ovid, Met.-42, Lucan-18, Valerius Flaccus-37, Statius, The b. -62, Silius Italicus-25) : for the late group, 315 (Quintus of Smyrna- 10, Claudian, Rap.- 68, Prudentius, Psych. AS, Tryphiodorus-27, Nonnus-54, Colluthus-58, Musaeus-53) - a 32% increase. (The Claudian sample was taken from the first 132 1/3 11. of the 3 books of the De Raptu and Musaeus' score of 45 on the 340 11. of Hero and Leander was raised to 53 to give an equivalent score from 400 11.</page><page sequence="5">NONVERBAL COMMUNICATION AND PARATAXIS 227 Early Cat.

Words are the primary means of social control 13. Rulers issue edicts and stipulate through words how subjects should behave towards each other, towards outsiders and towards the ruler. Oral precepts organize behaviour and complement other forms of social control prevalent in the 12 S. McCormack, Art and Ceremony in Late Antiquity, Berkeley, 1981, p. 116. Some earlier authors, such as Apollonius Rhodius, Ovid and Statius, evince great sensitivity to nonverbal communication. On what follows, cf. R. Poole, Towards Deep Subjectivity, London, 1972, pp. 16-30 ; J. Benthal, The Body as a Medium of Expression, London, 1975, pp. 10-11 ; and M. Bloch, Symbols, Song, Dance and Features of Articulation, in Archives Européennes de Sociologie , 15 (1974), pp. 55-81.

F. NEWBOLD community. The ruler often seeks to identify and invest himself with words : hence extensive preambles to pronouncements and lengthy tito- lature. Speech may be formal not only in content and vocabulary but in intonation and delivery. Proposing and asserting, it can drastically limit the range of possible responses from an individual or group. Communi- cation becomes a oneway street, a rehearsal of dialogue initiated and composed by the powerful. Acclamation and choruses of praise, whether the context is secular or ecclesiastical, are like shouting in uniform, with all the restriction on manœuvre and creativity that implies. Writing can give permanency, anonymity and spatial extension to the controlling power of words. Written law codes can be no less restrictive for being formulated by voluntary community consent. To some degree, nearly everyone tries to control the environment, particularly its human aspect, by words. By words we seek to shame, encourage and manipulate others, to reduce threats and win favours. We seek to impress, to present ourselves favourably ; and thus, often, to deceive, lie or cheat. In a small community, where everyone knows much about everyone, prolonged extravagant falsehood is difficult to get away with. Lesser deceits are tolerable as being easily checkable and discountable. However, as popu- lations increase and become more ethnically diverse, successful misre- presentation becomes easier and poses a problem to anyone having to deal with an ever growing number of strangers. One does not know how far to trust and how to relate to so many unknown quantities, particularly when standards of polite intercourse encourage concealment, circumlocution and euphemism. Nonverbal clues to real emotions and intentions behind the verbal facades and the ostensible badges of status become increasingly valuable. People are more practised at lying with words than faces, and with faces than bodies l4. Apparent aids to true interpretation and pro- tection from deceit, such as physiognomy, may have strong appeal l5. 14 Ekman and Friesen (at n. 8), p. 135, and cf. Lord Chesterfield : "Mind, not what people say, but how they say it, and if you have any sagacity, you may discover more truth by your eyes than by your ears. People can say what they will, but they cannot look just as they will" ( Letter 108) cited by G. Tytler, Physiognomy in the European Novel, Princeton, 1982, p. 196.

Verbal language becomes tarnish- ed by its association with bureaucracy, injustice and legal quibbling, and by its employment to defend the indefensible. When rhetoric forsakes the goal of persuasion and control for pleasure and adornment, it can be criticized as meretricious and for clothing the truth in superfluous veils that require time, energy and much learning to remove 16. Written words, in particular, because it is impossible to scrutinize the author for valuable supplementary and perhaps correcting information, may alienate 17 . Words inadequately express intense feeling. People may therefore reject the verbal medium and turn to their bodies as a medium of expression. They protest and dissent not by logical argument, lies and verbal mystification (the weapons of the authorities, the allies of social conformity) but by embo- dying their arguments in gesture, posture, costume ("dumb insolence") and by bodily occupation of centres of power and influence - or by removing their bodies from the scene, "dropping out". Argument about the ethics of persuasive speech goes back at least to Fifth Century B.C. Greece, but the initial Christian rejection of rhetoric as the handmaiden of paganism further undermined the standing of complex and ornate verbal structures 18. Any search for truths soon reveals the inadequacies of century French high society are most pertinent to fourth and fifth century Rome. Grand lying may be tolerated as a necessary survival mechanism for those struggling to succeed in a competitive and socially mobile society but needs to be carefully guarded against : cf. L. Bloom, Lying and Culture : a West African Case- study, in Journal of Psychological Anthropology ; 3 (1980), pp. 175-84. 15 Not to mention e.g. graphology and astrology.

Todorov, Theories of the Symbol , Oxford, 1977, c. 2, especially pp. 76-8. Autocracy ruled out free speech and persuasion but unease about sensuality prevented idolization of adornment. 17 The lack was keenly felt, and Greek and Latin try to supply the "meta-linguistics" via particles.

The Fourth Century A.D., an age of comparatively rapid change, wit- nessed not only an intensified search for truth 19 but an efflorescence of bureaucratic language (both Greek and Latin) that was repetitious, strident, clumsy, rambling, bombastic, inflated, euphemistic, highly abs- tract, and increasingly incomprehensible20. Modes of address became more complex and honorific - and widely adopted by, inter alios , minor officials, poets and historians. Communication via formal, complex verbalizing breeds an orientation towards structure, order, authority 21. Furthermore, in an embattled society, protection against foes was needed, be they demons, heretics, rebels, barbarians or rivals. Apotropaic ritual and gesture could supplement or substitute words and incanta- tions 22. Body language is more easily and sooner learnt than verbal language. It is preverbal. Emission of information is more subliminal, and assess- ment of perceived information more intuitive. And the process is para- tactic in that it comprises an array of signals that are not produced in the logical, organized, hypotactic manner of sophisticated speech. Body language is a shifting constellation of juxtaposed elements. Yet, if para- tactic, it is also simultaneous (as opposed to the sequentiality of verbal discourse) because facial expression, posture, gesture etc. may be pro- longed and because a range of signals are emitted simultaneously. Words are bits, pictures are wholes. Even the simplest sentence structure supports a cause-effect way of regarding experience, with a subject acting upon an object - a simplified linear view that excludes multiple influences or reciprocal subject-object relationships. Sentences attune people to concen- trate on differences rather than similarities. Further, alphabetic linguistic systems favour association by contiguity, thus creating a powerful logical mechanism and a highly abstract system of signs. The logic of contiguity " Cf. Sabbah (at n. 15), pp. 44-5 1 , on the fourth century as an "age of discipherment" ; and my article Space and Scenery in Quintus of Smyrna , Claudian and Nonnus, in Ramus, 10 (1981), pp. 53-68, esp. 65.

Prose, philosophy and science tends to favour the former mode, poetry, diagrams, models and icons the latter. Pictures, and words that conjure up pictures - metaphors, myths, ecphrases - can all convey a less fragmentary impression of the world 23. As suggested earlier (p. 229), nonverbal communication offers more scope for ambiguity, hinting, implying, persuading rather than asserting. Visual rhetoric, a language of images, has a reduced agonistic charge 24. Verbal statements invite verbal engagement : it is harder to dispute with a prose, song, poem, picture or ceremony. Nonverbal communication can, of course, be quite unambiguous and provocative at times, e.g. a punch in the face, a sulky silence, flamboyant costume. Both verbal and nonverbal communication have a formal mode that seeks to control and limit idiosyncratic interpretation. But in a society that has found words to be the most ready, clear and efficient means of instruction and exposition, nonverbal communication offers a world of dumb insolence and subtle nuances to be delicately explored 25 . It offers a comparatively low risk method of challenging authority and traditional assumptions. Nonverbal communication can offer "space" to explore and in which to assert autonomy and individualism. It is appropriate that St. Augustine, who wrestled so much with the problems of ambiguity and communication, should belong to this period and should be regarded as the founder of Western semiotics (theory of signs). Augustine recognized that words were not the only signs, but that taste, touch, smell and sight were sources of signs too. His categories of the proper/natural, direct/indirect, intentional/inferential modes that may apply to visual and audial messages approximate to explicit/implicit and are his way of differentiating the conventional, univocal sign from the 23 There is a voluminous literature on the subject of what follows. See e.g. C. Hampden-Turner, Maps of the Mind, New York, 1981, p. 8 ; G. Steiner, Language and Silence , London, 1958, p. 46 ; D. Pignatari, The Contiguity Illusion, in T. Seboek, Sight, Sound and Sense, Bloomington, 1978, pp. 84-97. W. J. Ong, Fighting for Life, Ithaca, 1981, p. 164. Thus, e.g. modern advertisers of unhealthy products avoid verbal assertions about the value of their merchandise and rely on visual imagery and musical accompaniment. When the Syracusan tyrants Gelo and Hiero tried to monopolise the power of words by forbidding citizens to utter any sound at all, the citizens devised a strategy of silent signs to carry on their (ultimately, successliil) resistance. See V. Farenga, Pindaric Craft and the Writing of Pythia IV, in Helios , 5 (1977), pp. 3-38.</page><page sequence="10">232 R. F. NEWBOLD natural, multivocal symbol 26. In his concern to impose his version of the truth on others, Augustine, inevitably, had a communicative bias towards explicit verbalization. He deliberately used a vulgar style in his concern to be understood rather than to observe grammatical immaculacy 27 . If one can regard an interest in nonverbal communcation, as inter alia, an interest in the implicit and the paratactic, a manifestation of these characteristics in art, language and literature may offer corroboratory tokens of a shift in community consciousness and styles of perceiving and communicating and, therefore, thinking and living. Linguistic structure can be characterised as propositional, logical and appealing mainly to reason. Vocabulary tends to be abstract and sentence structure complex, hypotactic and periodic, seeking to arrange ideas in a hierarchy of importance and to propositionally corner reality, i.e. to suggest that there is only one way to regard something and to proceed to a single conclusion, step by guided step. Or else linguistic structure can be appositional, associative and appealing mainly to emotion or intuition. Vocabulary tends to be concrete and sentence structure simple and paratactic, leaving the perceiver to make the connections, fill in the gaps and resolve any ambiguities. Parataxis spatialises discourse and creates a non-linear, analogical-topological syntax 28. If the person speaking in this style is anxious to be clearly understood, there may be increased recourse to an explicit, easily understood code of accompanying nonverbal signals. The paratactic style cannot clearly convey certain abstract and complex thoughts and thereby foster cultural innovation, but it can be richly evocative and imagistic, fostering divergent rather than convergent think- ing, and it can, if necessary, express simple ideas clearly. Ammianus and Eutropius are respective exemplars of hypotactic and paratactic written styles. It is significant therefore that the syntax of literary Latin in the late empire became noticeably more paratactic, achieving its (sometimes strikingly monumental) effects through simple juxtaposition rather than through the hierarchical elaboration that purposefully and subtly grades and arranges the components for the perceiver. Corresponding relaxations 26 The distinction between "conventional sign" with its limited range of possible meanings, and the wider-ranging imagery of "natural symbol" is explored by V. and E. Turner, Image and Pilgrimage in Christian Culture. Anthropological Perspectives, New York, 1978, pp. 28, 142-8, 160, 245 : cf. too Todorov (at n. 16), c. 1. Auerbach (at n. 4), pp. 61-2.

The greater informality of sermo humilis , which increasingly influenced literary Latin, was less oriented towards establishing strict and explicit logical relationships. It was more egalitarian in the sense of being more willing to embrace all types of experience, the elevated and detached as well as the base and sensory, and was more accessible than the sophisticated linguistic technology of a Livy or Tacitus 29 . The stylistic unevenness and the dissonances caused by the more frequent inclusion of documents and biblical quotations in Fourth Century historiography, biography or eccle- siastical treatises contrast with the greater stylistic harmony and homo- geneity of earlier authors, and parallels the "fragmentary" style of imperial sculpture, whereby original and reused sections are juxtaposed. The resurgence of qualitative verse metres and the emergence of rhyme are part of the same movement to less formal and more evocative modes of expression 30. Hymns introduced a new popular, worldly element into divine services that differed from the solemn chanting of psalms 31 . Parallel developments occurred in (especially ecclesiastical) Greek. After the second century A.D., the verbal system of mood, tense and conjugation simplified and loosened. Periphrasis and parataxis increas- ed 32. Tonic accent took over from vowel quantity. The conflicting claims of clarity and high culture produced a threefold coexistence of literary, ecclesiastic and common styles. 29 "The new linguistic form thus differed from the old ... in such a way as to ... (lead) to a more direct participation by both speaker and listener in a conceptual world caught in the act of its generative process, in its no longer secret internal vision" (W. Dorigo, Late Roman Painting , London, 1970, pp. 289 and 280-9 generally). Cf. too Auerbach (at n. 4), pp. 62-3 ; Introduction to Romance Languages and Literature , New York, 1961, pp. 56-70 : cf. p. 69 - "... as regards adverbs of time and place, prepositions introducing circumstantial complement of time and space (after, before etc.) and temporal or local conjunction (during, since, when etc.), Vulgar Latin tended to reinforce them in order to make them more concrete and also to emphasise the gait (so to speak) of the temporal or local movement signified by these words".

NEWBOLD Literary style becomes at once more concrete (i.e. sensory and imme- diate) and metaphoric. Weapons are corn ; dew is fire ; a voice is a shield 33. There is a proliferation of personification - another instance of the abstract becoming concrete. A relating of common elements to the point of their fusion and identification replaces careful distinctions be- tween the animate or natural, and the inanimate or artificial. Historio- graphie interest in numerical detail, analytic precision and chronological sequence declines 34. The greater literary interest in nonverbal communica- tion, particularly gesture, reveals a pictorially inclined interest in space rather than in sequential time. References to nonverbal cues force the hearer or reader to make more attempt to visualise the scene, the movements and the spatial relationships between characters. If only the words of the speakers are given, the temporal aspect of events is empha- sised 35. Gesture, like parataxis, spatialises, and draws the reader into the immediacy and drama of the situation. The paratactic arrangement of scenes in narrative (see e.g. any poem of Claudian, or the overall structure of the Posthomerica) reveals an indifference to hierarchically arranging the parts and organising the reader's perceptions that parallels linguistic developments. Panegyrics of the time similarly illustrate an emphasis on space and pictoriality rather than time and narrative : on what rather than how 36. Compositional structure loosens. Ammianus ranges more widely than Tacitus. The Dionysiaca proceeds in an associative manner unmatch- ed by Ovid, let alone Vergil. Classical antiquity appears not to have fully understood or practised the principles of linear, single-point perspective in visual art : but partial, several-point perspective was regularly achieved, and most of the tech- niques for representing three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional surface were understood. Perspective in art is a means of standardising 33 E.g. Claud., Ruf., 2, 291-2 ; Stil., 2, 468-72 ; Nonnus, Dion., XIII, 482-3. Cf. G.

Perspective devalues what the eye is primarily and most immediately concerned with - colour and light - in favour of the most complex component of visual sensation - form. Form is the component most subject to influence from preconceived cultural data : it is fundamentally an intellectual construction projected outward through the eye. The abandonment of perspective and dissolution of form releases a world of radiant colours that take form in the right brain hemisphere of the beholder 37 . In a literate society, mental constructions are determined by words. Any effort to abandon form for light and colour is also a movement away from verbalised structures and from government ideology. Hellenistic art employed a rational method of representing space to achieve a conventional realism of form 38. Even partial perspective involves an integrated relationship between figure and ground that uses spatial cues to suggest depth, to focus attention, indicate the relative importance of the components of the design, and direct interpretation in the manner of a syllogism. Particularly in the Latin west, late antiquity saw a successful resurgence of plebeian art that challenged the previously dominant Hellenistic canons. This trend parallels linguistic and literary develop- ments. Non-perspective, two-dimensional art leaves the viewer freer to arrange the spatial relationships. Guides to interpretation, and suggestions as to the relative importance of components are indicated by more emotional and "naive" means such as size and nonverbal expressiveness 37 The discussion of J. A. Arguilles, The Transformative Vision , London, 1975, pp. 6-149, is extremely useful on the way perspective syntactically organises perception : the Impressionists "at least partially cleansed the doors of perception. After centuries of static form, the luminous, irradiative nature of reality began to reveal itself in all its splendour" (148). See too J. White, The Birth and Rebirth of Pictorial Space , London, 1967, c. 16 ; G. Richter, Perspective in Greek and Roman Art, London, n.d. Even more than art, architecture may organise perception. Cf. R. Brilliant, Roman Art, London, 1974 : "Roman architecture ... (expresses) a psychological preference for order not only in composition but as a method of rationalising and structuring the causal aspects of experience. Some form of linear development seems to have been the most prevalent system of organisation (33-4) ... The architect's desire to translate rhythmic variations in a linear plan into a carefully controlled, rich sequence of dramatic, emotional experiences (43) ... The focus of attention lay at the head of the central axis in a person, an image, or a grand symbol" (44). Any kind or urban planning is a form of visual censorship, for it orders certain ways of perceiving and relating to the environment. Cf. K. Albarn and J. M. Smith, Diagram.

Absence of Euclidean three-dimensionality results in a paratactic arrangement of figures on a flat plane. Bird's-eye viewpoints and frontal setting allow the eye to roam unopposed over the whole pictorial surface. Not fixed in space by an organic relationship with the ground, the figures may "float" 39. Contemporary aesthetic theory, Neo-Platonist and Christian, also attests a shift in interest from form towards colour and light, and this emphasis is evident in contemporary architecture too 40. The growing popularity of mosaic vis-à-vis the other visual art media is part of the trend from line to light, for it is a low-definition medium, requiring more input from the observer, and the variously angled tesserae of wall mosaics reflect light in a way that dissolves form 41 . With a body of teaching that freely mingled everyday life and the most sublime tragedy, and with an orientation towards essence rather than form ("the letter kills, the spirit gives life"), Christianity was well equipped to lead the assault on the traditional, elitist hierarchical categories and canons. From the first it had a small-group, anti-organisational stance that persisted into the Fourth Century in its ascetic and rural strains. Humble, wise piety went with simple speech 42. Yet, also from the beginning, there was a strong bias towards the written word. Christianity was a religion of the book and the needs of polemic and apology could evoke elaborate rhetoric. Nonverbal, visual representations of doctrine were strongly aniconic, an abstract system of "conventional signs" rather than concrete 39 I.e. they do not obey the laws of gravity (weight, solidity, but also connoting seriousness, seriality and speech : sermo derives ultimately from serere, to tie together : cf. Sanscrit sarat, thread ; Greek seira, rope ; Latin series). Perspective makes objects and people appear heavy and subject to the law of gravity. Cf.

From the Third Century on, Christian art became increasingly iconic and therefore concrete. Yet, like plebeian pagan art, it tended to lack perspective, adopt frontal treatment and use ornamental partitions to organise the composition and provide a background 44. In the Fourth Century, reports of image worship by Christians became common and church leaders became concerned that worship of Christ's image would divert attention from His teachings. So far we have produced some evidence for increased interest in nonverbal communication generally and in implicit, paratactic modes of expression within language, literature and art. We have suggested that these developments may represent an inarticulate, vaguely understood reaction to order, structure, hierarchy, mass society and rhetorical over- communication ; and it may be part of a renewed effort to seek truth and authenticity. The paragraph immediately above suggests where some of the initial impulse for the trend came from, and whence it was subsequently reinforced. We have also contrasted two days of sending, perceiving and processing information ; the relaxed, diffused, unfocussed, "soft-eyed" mode, more concerned with synthesis and the overall picture versus the focussed, concentrated, "hard-eyed", analytic mode, more concerned with detail, fine print, hierarchical organisation and pre-existing schemata 45. These cognitive styles tend to correspond to those of the right and left brain hemispheres respectively. The right hemisphere mainly processes wholes, pictures, spatial relationships, and proceeds analogically, linking similarities. It is the hemisphere primarily concerned with orientation in space, body image and the recognition of places. The left hemisphere mainly processes parts, words and numbers, and proceeds analytically, emphasising differences 46. Nonverbal communication involves more of a person than verbal communication : it permits a more comprehensive expression and perception of the personality. If the right hemisphere has been comparatively neglected and down- graded in the days when a comparatively high level of imperial organisa- tion was achieved, one might feel that an eventual reassertion was inevi- 43 Cf. above, n. 26.

Moreover, the weight and length of preceding "high" civilization may be implicated in another way. The increasing diversity and brightness of costume, despite official attempts at regulation, suggest that the Fourth Century was a highly competitive, visually flamboyant and individualistic society 47 . Important paths to achievement depended upon mastery of the classical cultural heritage and an accurate recollection thereof. Given the comparative scarcity of written material and the difficulty of access to specific facts in non-indexed books, much of value for everyday life or the competitive struggle (winning an argument by citing an authority, recognising an obscure poetic allusion) had to be stored in and retrieved from the head. Successful memorisation requires mobilising all the senses and the trans- lating of as much information as possible into concrete, graspable images that are more easily stored and recalled. The larger the preceding accumu- lation of cultural achievement preserved through writing, the greater the demands on the memory, and the more need to revert to analogic, imagistic modes of storing, interpreting and synthesising the ceaselessly proliferating and complexifying patterns of data48. In the absence of a technological breakthrough, such as printing, to speed up and transform methods of data processing, the Fourth Century's manuscript culture had virtually reached saturation point in its ability to absorb more verbal data : hence a need for the condensed, highly charged imagery of sensory, natural symbols49. In a competitive society, ambitious people need to ascertain quickly and accurately who are worth investing time upon, when 47 McMullen (at n. 20), pp. 367-8 ; Some pictures in Ammianus Marcellinus, in Art Bulletin , 46 (1964), pp. 435-55, esp. 445-51.

Dixon, The Evolving Brain, Melbourne, 1978, p. 145. Use of the imagination to generate vivid, memorable images to memorise a speech had long been an essential part of rhetorical training ; cf. F.

Holroyd, Alien Intelligence, New York, 1979, p. 24. Under hypnosis some people can recall the most trivial details of their environment weeks previously. The sensory acuity of primitive peoples is largely a function of their right hemisphere bias. Modern techniques of accelerated learning and improved memory recall (up to a factor of 50), such as Suggestology, activate the right hemisphere by means of relaxed bodies, difñise attention, music, mild hypnotic trances and strong visualisation.

Greater sensitivity to nonverbal cues in personal interaction may therefore be part of a wider general trend towards more holistic modes of processing data. To farther refine our argument and pull together the diverse strands : implicit and explicit modes of expression are possible in any genre. In different ways, clarity of expression and control of others are attainable both by hypotactic and paratactic language, or by two dimensional and three dimensional art. But where hypotactic language alienates through obscurity and excessive adornment, the natural reaction is a drive for simplicity via parataxis. Where it alienates by its linguistic high technology, by its appeal to an elaborate code of abstruse and learned allusions, by its over explicitness and by its directiveness and manipulativeness, the reaction is towards the implicit and the ambiguous that parataxis also offers. There may be a reaction to either overt authoritarian control or to any deceptive presentation of the self/truth, whether that control and deception be exercised verbally or nonverbally or in both ways ; and that reaction may be direct via revolt, ecstasy, flamboyance and licence as well as by an insistence on authentic representation of the inner self, or it may be indirect, via counter-deception and exploring nonverbal nuance, sub- tlety and implicitness. In literature or visual art, the reaction to control, to restraint and to hierarchical, linear, three dimensional, explicit com- positional form may manifest in emotionality and expressiveness of subject matter, juxtaposition, two-dimensionality and looseness of structure. Of course the tendencies and counter tendencies that have been isolated and identified blend with each other, within and between communicative modes ; and the overall interreaction produces a very complex situation which will be explored a little farther below. But if we think of language, and particularly alphabetic script generally as having more to do with conventional signs, and nonverbal communication as generally having more in common with natural symbols, we are witnessing a wholesale shift in cultural emphasis from logic, language and literature to intuition, space and visual art, from left to right hemispheric cognitive modes. Such a shift may help explain why late antiquity is more notable for the quality of its visual art than for its literature 5I. Although there may have been an overall (if imperfectly realised) decline in the prestige of rhetoric and the power 50 M.

NEWBOLD of words to influence, there is no clear evidence that people spoke, read or wrote less in late antiquity, however much Christian asceticism and palace ceremonial valued silence52. Church and state evinced their continued faith in verbiage to impress, control and instruct via an abundance of edicts, inscribed laws, titles, panegyrics, sermons, exegeses and polemics. But to win hearts as well as minds, nonverbal means also have to be employed. The deep and ineffable layers of consciousness affected by symbols cannot be ignored. The danger for (would be) controllers is that recourse to emotion, imagery and metaphor may so stimulate the imagination that messages are interpreted too freely and may convey a meaning opposite to what was intended 53. Too much soft-sell and transformative vision incites individualism, undermines organizational structures and distracts from communal goals. Nonverbal communication must therefore be carefully controlled and employ as far as possible a language of conventional signs - uniforms, medals, insignia, flags, colours - to maintain complex hierarchies 54. An unprecedented number of imperial images was produced in the Fourth Century and placed in public areas and official rooms throughout the empire 55 . Ceremonial became more colourful and ornate and the setting of panegyrics became more important than the speech itself56. Verse panegyrics replaced prose panegyrics by the end of the Fourth Century. The images and slogans of panegyric, literature, art and coins converged to form an ecphrastic, iconographie, widely intelligible code. To the extent that there was more presence in whatever medium of insubstantiality, colour, chiaroscuro, texture, metaphor, gesture, natural symbol, sensory richness, expressiveness and theatricality, the government 52 Cf. K. M. Setton, The Christian Attitude Towards the Emperor in the Fourth Century, New York, 1941, p. 194. 53 Thus, "the fly, though small, is dangerous" failed as a health message in one African country because its metaphor-prone population interpreted it as, "the Europeans are few but they are powerful ...

Enthusiasm for pageantry may index the degree of popular susceptibility to metaphorical thinking 58 . However, such an accommodation could only be allowed to go so far if an empire was to be maintained. Among the results were works wherein contrasting styles coexist, such as the misso- rium of Theodosius. In a fluid society, "processions and banquets are the occasions for once more making the rungs of the social ladder clearly distinct" 59. Ceremonies such as adventus, consecratio and accession became increasingly liturgical and by the end of the Fourth Century were offering less scope for participation by the populace. They became more stereotyped and crys- tallized. By recording detail of ceremonial and protocol in books, more exact repetition in future was ensured 60. Thus fixed, the "language" of the occasion, once understood is, in a way, simplified and less likely to inspire "wrong" interpretation or original response. Further, any writing about a ceremony gives it permanence and expands the audience. Careful re- hearsal of gesture and intonation means that the speaker61, whether delivering a panegyric or reading out the emperor's letter, offers less scope for genuine multi-channel communication from himself to the audience. Spontaneous delivery offers more nonverbal cues and may suggest unwit- ting dissonances between the speaker's words and feelings, particularly in the case of some hopelessly euphemistic and optimistic piece of propa- ganda. Two-dimensionality, frontality and gestural figures in art may invite participation and reduce the distance between scene and spectator, but staring eyes and imperious, impressive gestures compel (rather than invite) attention and do so on the (hired) artist's own terms 62 : it is a controlled involvement. Rigid posture, standing "at attention" signals alert, tense orientation towards the fulfilment of goals 63. Majestic immobi- 57 U. Eco, The Role of the Reader ; Bloomington, 1979, pp. 47-59. 58 D. M.

NEWBOLD lity, posture and gesture, convey authority and stability at the centre of flux 64. An unchanging and unchangeable arrangement of inner qualities may be suggested. Perceiving "rulership" in costume and expression was more important than recognizing individual emperors. Reverse coin types became fewer in number, less subject to change, less sensitive to current events, more evocative of a few quasi-permanent features of the life of the state and its concomitant, recognizable insignia and rituals. The range of motifs on coins and medallions contracts and those motifs that remain increasingly resemble each other 65. Muscular tension is easily communicated and observers tend uncon- sciously to imitate the attitude of the observed. In particular, people tense when stared at. The multiplication (and sometimes magnification) of staring imperial images was presumably designed to heighten arousal and induce a mirror stiffening and disciplining of physical movement and posture ; and hence a more focussed mental attitude. Nonverbal commu- nication is a means of adapting to as well as challenging authority. Since so much nonverbal communication occurs subliminally, submissive reac- tions cannot always be checked. When perceived, consciously or un- consciously by authority, they appear to legitimise the continued right of authority to dominate. Authority can be advertised by means of visual gestures that emphasise the loci of power and prestige 66. In short, the imperial language of gesture and clothing was simplified into a pictogra- phically explicit "script for the illiterate" 67 . The emphasis shifts to legi- bility, verb and "what", from movement, adverb and "how". "How" requires a greater knowledge of the historical background and context to interpret the scene (how and when did the portrayed sequence of actions begin ?). Such curiosity may seduce attention into the allusion-rich periphery. In the pictographic style, carefully delineated insignia or gestures supply much of the context by a code of explicit and conventional signs. The appealing timelessness of two-dimensional art was harnessed lowered muscular tension, looser posture, more informal clothing, cf. D. Morris, Man watching, London, 1978, p. 19. Cf. H. P.

If perspectivai composition is a means or organizing perception, its comparative decline did not mean the end of ideology in art. Some of the means to influence interpretation that were employed in the Fourth Century have been mentioned (p. 236). Symmetry, stereotyped figures, axial design, strong delineation are amply attested. Serried ranks of spectators all watching the central and/or apical figure (the "chorus effect") and reacting with appropriate posture and gesture are another strong and common means of directing the viewers' attention and clari- fying messages about the proper social order. The design of basilicas, in the way it drove the eyes of the audience towards the ciborium in the apse, was an architectural aid to focussing attention 69. The problem of representing figures and conveying visual messages that were consistent with standardized dogma exercised ecclesiastical minds no less than secular ones. Being more overtly oriented towards transcen- dence of form and the ineffable, Christianity, like most religions, had a more innate affinity for the nonverbal anyway. Rejection of hypotactic structures was more tolerable. But the problem of control and organiza- tion was correspondingly more difficult for church leaders. Religious zeal, unguided by the supposedly informed ecclesiastical experts, (con)fused signified and signifier, e.g. by regarding an image of the virgin as a concrete embodiment of Her immediately tappable powers rather an abstract indication of their remote existence 70 .

F. NEWBOLD language of visual symbolism (e.g. Pelagians, Gnostics) were a threat to those who gathered in the periodic Church councils and sought to standardise perception. In embracing the agonistic, rhetorical tradition, church leaders gave conciliar edicts a polemical edge. They created heresies and controversies as they created distinctions and refinements in their effort to control and to articulate the truth 71 . Although the limited number of abstract motifs in pre-200 A.D. art gave way to more concrete, anthropomorphic representations and an emphasis on light rather than form, nevertheless, stereotyping and limitation of motifs (which increasing- ly borrowed from imperial models) are evident 72 . Exactly repeated and dignified ritual or liturgy focussed attention on familiar and conventional meanings : the spontaneity of Arian liturgy, which could admit dance, alarmed orthodox opinion. The issue of conventional signs versus natural symbols is central to the later iconoclast controversy and, significantly, the championing of the former came from above. Writing of the Dominate, one scholar has observed : "In the whole of conceptual life there is a movement away from the complex towards the simple, from the mobile towards the static, from the dialectic and relative towards the dogmatic and the authoritarian, from the empirical towards theology and theosophy. There is a trend towards plain, uncomplicated absolutes which are imperturbably fixed in themselves. ... when actions or things are embodied in such absolutes, their individual outlines and their adaptability to situations ... disappear ; they all become alike and come to rest in this similarity" 73 . This statement is largely true but it is important to distinguish (as we have tried to do) two types of simplification. One was a simplification from above, as it were, of forms into stereotypes and a code of conventional signs, explicit, easily processed by the analytic mind and aimed at control of the population. The other was a "simplification" of communicative style from below (three-dimensional to two-dimen- sional, hypotaxis to parataxis, verbal to nonverbal).
