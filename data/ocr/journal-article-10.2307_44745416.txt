Haffner National Highway Traffic Safety Administration G. Newaz and S. Nusier Wayne State University ABSTRACT The Isodamp damping material (also known as Navy Damp) used in the ribs of current crash test dummies provides human-like damping to the thorax under impact. However, the range of temperature over which it can be used is very small. A new rib design using laminates of steel, fiberglass, and commercially available viscoelastic material has been constructed. Load-deflection response and hysteresis of the laminated ribs were compared with corresponding conventional ribs fabricated from steel and Isodamp. Impact tests were conducted on laminated and conventional ribs at 18.5° C, 22.2° C and 26.6° C. Results indicate that the response of the laminated ribs is essentially the same as that of the ribs with Isodamp at 22.2° C, which is the operating temperature of the conventional ribs. The variation in the impact response of the newly developed laminated ribs in the temperature range of 18.5° C to 26.6° C was less than 10%. The variation was well within the allowed reproducibility range, and significantly less than the 30-40% variation seen with the Isodamp material. Repeated impact tests indicate that the new laminate construction is generally robust and provides repeatable response. FE modeling was used to predict the properties of alternative materials needed to provide adequate damping over the required range of temperature. Damping properties of various materials were evaluated using cantilever beam tests followed by single rib tests of most promising materials. This paper will present details on the design, development, and testing of the new laminate rib. INTRODUCTION An anthropomorphic test device (ATD), or crash test dummy, is an important tool in assessing the likelihood of injury in a vehicle crash. The response of the thorax of the crash dummy is an essential element in evaluating the injury potential to the thorax in such events. Injury may occur either through direct impact with interior vehicle structures such as steering wheels or dash panels, or through loading by vehicle restraint devices such as belts and airbags. The human thorax is a viscoelastic structure [Melvin, 1985], Its response to blunt impact shows the following characteristics among others: 1. Pronounced velocity sensitivity: Higher forces are generated with higher impact velocities at the same level of deflection. 2. High hysteresis effects: Cadaver tests have indicated that the hysteresis may range from 69% to 85%. 3. Significant force at low deflection: The high initial forces arise from rapid inertial loading of the relatively light sternum. A dummy thorax is required to mimic the human thorax in its shape and its response to blunt impact. Current dummy thoraxes, such as those of the Hybrid III and THOR, consist of a steel structure (with or without flexible joints) which represents the spine and a set of ribs. The ribs are attached to the spine and are fabricated from hardened steel hoops to which damping material (EAR Isodamp CN) is bonded. In the new THOR frontal crash test dummy developed by the NHTSA [White, 1996; Rangarajan, 1998; Haffner, 2001], there are seven pairs of ribs which are elliptical in shape to resemble the outline of the human ribcage. They gradually increase in extent from the first to the seventh rib. In addition, the second to the seventh ribs are gradually slanted down, again to replicate the anthropometry of the human ribcage. 490</page><page sequence="2">The traditional tests used to assess the biofidelity of the dummy thorax under blunt impact to the central sternum are the Kroell tests [Neathery, 1974]. These tests use a 23.4 kg cylindrical impactor. The face of the impactor has a diameter of 1 51 mm and impact speeds of 4.3 m/s and 6.7 m/s are normally applied. The thorax of both the Hybrid III and THOR are biofidelic at these Impact speeds. The Isodamp CN material, with the appropriate stiffness, satisfies the three characteristics of the human thoracic response described above. The principal limitation of the Isodamp CN material used in a crash test dummy is that it can be used to mimic human impact response only in a narrow temperature range. The effective range is between 22.2° C (72° F) and 23.3° C (74° F). The usable temperature range Is limited because the dynamic modulus of the damping material falls rapidly from about 1010 N/ m2to about 2*1 09 N/ m2 when temperature is increased from about 10° C (50° F) to about 25° C (77° F) [EAR Technical Data Sheet, 1997], This change in Young's modulus is reflected in the 35% variation in total thoracic acceleration and 42% variation in chest deflection when the ambient temperature is varied from 18.3°C (65° F) to 26.7°C (80° F) [Saul, 1984]. Dummies are tested in various kinds of laboratories all over the world. Heat transfer properties of the damping material dictate that the dummies have to be "soaked" at the right operating temperature for several hours before its use. The need to "heat soak" the dummy and the need to maintain very strict controls over the temperature in the laboratory add to the cost of tests and make dummies harder to use. This is important to car manufacturers and test laboratories that conduct several tests a day. Even a well "soaked" dummy can lose its calibration when it is exposed for a long time to the heat from the lights at the sled facility. The aim of the research reported in this paper was to design dummy ribs that would have greatly reduced variability in response within the temperature range of 18.3° C to 26.7° C. The paper describes the steps which were followed in selecting the materials, developing the fabrication process, and finally, testing the new design. PREVIOUS EFFORTS The problem of variability of response of dummy ribs with temperature has been addressed previously. Ore and Saul [1993] attempted to lessen the temperature dependence of Hybrid III ribs by designing and developing thermoplastic fibre-reinforced composite ribs. They reviewed the properties of available thermoplastic fibre-reinforced composites and selected several materials. They developed appropriate manufacturing techniques and fabricated six rib sets. None of the materials exhibited adequate hysteresis. In an effort to improve the hysteresis, a thin layer of the damping material used in the Hybrid III was applied to the neutral axis of the composite rib set. This provided adequate hysteresis but the problem of temperature dependence was still present, although the thickness of Isodamp CN was reduced from 12.7 mm to 3.1 mm. Bell [1984] also studied the problem of temperature sensitivity of the ribs. He reported that the Hybrid II dummy showed a 9% variation in its force deflection curve over a range of temperature from 18.3° C to 26.7° C which was deemed acceptable. Hybrid III exhibited a 42% change in the same temperature range. This is apparently because Hybrid II has more steel than damping material. Unfortunately, the Hybrid II does not show biofidelic response to sternal impact. The author also developed a double rib, which had partial success. DESIGN REQUIREMENTS There were several design requirements for a new rib design in a crash dummy thorax. 1 . Shape, size and mass of the thorax has to be human like and the thorax CG must be in the anatomically correct position. 2. Thorax impact response must lie within current corridors and dummy should behave in a humanlike manner under bag and belt loading. 3. The thoracic cavity must have enough space for instrumentation and it would be desirable to use the currently available Instrumentation. Current injury criteria derived from dummy tests are based on information obtained from these instruments. 4. It should be easy to assemble, calibrate (preferably using current calibration equipment) and use. This is because many laboratories use the dummy several times during the day and because laboratories have invested considerable amount of money in calibrating equipment. 5. It should withstand about 30 tests within the limits set by the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). METHODOLOGY Several different approaches to finding an alternative to the spring steel and Isodamp CN structure of the current ribs were considered. At the outset, the primary aim was to search for materials that would have equivalent stiffness and damping, while being less sensitive to temperature. The simplest method of adding damping to a structure is using viscoelastic materials (of which the Isodamp CN is an example). In general, viscoelastic materials with 491</page><page sequence="3">significant damping tend to be more temperature dependent. The goal was to find one that is less so. Several damping materials were considered, such as Sorbothane, Vamac, and other varieties of Isodamp. None of these had damping or stiffness characteristics close to that of Isodamp CN. Another type of viscoelastic materials were damping interlayers which are normally thin strips that can be layered either as a free structure bonded to a stiff backing or as a component of a constrained layer design [Finnegan, 1999; Gibson, 1999]. These included the 3M and Avery- Dennison viscoelastic adhesive tapes. The 3M tapes in particular appeared to have desirable temperature characteristics. They showed significantly less variation of their dynamic modulus in the temperature range of interest [3M Technical Data Sheet, 1999], These viscoelastic layers could be potentially used as part of a constrained layer design using either metal or composite beams. Composites using either carbon fiber or glass fiber would be attractive because of their light weight and their relative strength and durability. Another possible candidate would be a shape memory alloy such as Nitinol. These materials, normally have excellent dissipative properties. More complex methods of achieving damping would be using electronic damping using piezo-electric materials such as certain ceramics. Other methods employ active vibration control using magneto-electric and magneto- resistive materials, where the stiffness can be tuned using sensors and actuators. A possible limitation of these methods (apart from its complexity) is that it may be difficult to achieve the proper magnitude of damping. Another limitation is that it may not be possible to maintain the damping over the range of frequencies of interest. During this research effort, attention was primarily focused on viscoelastic adhesive materials. A two step approach was taken. Tests were conducted using a vibrating beam as a way of measuring the stiffness and damping of the materials. A finite element model of the vibrating beam setup was employed to help select the potentially most useful materials. DESCRIPTION OF VIBRATION TEST SETUP The experimental approach that was followed in evaluating possible candidate materials for the dummy rib was to use a vibrating cantilever beam as the primary structure from which the stiffness and damping characteristics of the materials could be quantified. Such a structure was also simple enough to be modeled using finite elements. In order to estimate the damping property of a candidate material, the vibration test was set up as shown in Figure 1 . 492 Figure 1 . Sketch of vibrating beam fixture. The basic objective in this experiment was to create free oscillations of the beam, which is fixed at one end. An accelerometer was attached at the free end of beam to measure the acceleration of the system. An initial test was performed with the steel only. This served as the base reference. By using the acceleration response, both the stiffness and the damping properties can be easily estimated. The time period (inverse of the frequency) is a function of the stiffness of the system. The basic geometric/inertial information of the specimen are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Geometry of the test specimen Material Length Width Height (mm) (mm) (mm) Steel Beam 304.8 19.1 1.5 Damping Material 279.4 19.1 12.7 The candidate materials were bonded to a flat, steel beam. The metal surface was sandblasted and the surfaces to be bonded were chemically treated to allow for a suitable bond. Appropriate heat and pressure were applied for the epoxy used for bonding. The specimen was soaked in a controlled environment at a specified temperature for 1 hour prior to the test to assure the material temperature was uniform. The beam was then attached to the fixed support as illustrated in Figure 1. The beam was excited manually by displacing the free end downward approximately 50 mm and then released and the accelerometer data were recorded. The recording time was long enough to capture seven to eight complete oscillations of the beam. The data from the vibration test were used to compute two basic properties of the beam. One was the bending stiffness of the beam and the second was the damping coefficient. The vibration test fixture is shown in Figure 2 below, with the beam prior to release.</page><page sequence="4">Figure 2. Setup of vibration fixture prior to release of beam. The free vibration of the beam is described by the standard, linear equation of a damped system [Thomson, 2000]: d2x dx . A m - 2 - - hC h kx . = 0 A (1) dt 2 dt d2x dx 2 ^ - - + 2Ç(ùn - + con x-0 ^ (2) dt dt where: m = effective mass of beam c = damping coefficient k = beam bending stiffness and: IT con = J - = undamped natural frequency (3) V m c Ç = - j= = damping ratio (4) 2d km (Damping ratio Ç = 1 implies that the system is critically damped) The damping ratio, Ç, can be computed from the amplitude ratio which is the ratio of two successive peak amplitudes. S = 'n^~ (5) *,-+i AK2 - 1 Ç = (-T + l)2 (6) o Once Ç is computed, then the natural frequency can be obtained from the time period of the damped vibrations. 2n °&gt;d=Y (7) where: T = time period of the damped vibrations From o)n, it is then straightforward to compute the beam stiffness k. The damping ratio is related to the loss factor q which is defined for damped systems as the ratio of the energy lost during one radian of a vibration cycle to the maximum stored energy [Thomson, 2000]. Loss factor = q = AW/(27r)/Emax (9) where: AW = energy lost during one cycle Emax = maximum stored energy = 1/4kx02 (10) For forced oscillations, the motion of the beam can be represented by the function: x(0 = x0 sin cot (11) with, co being the angular frequency of the external force and x0 being the amplitude of vibration. The work lost in vibration cycle due to the damping component in equation (1 ) is given by: A W = &lt;jcx&lt;źc = cx^dt = ex2 dt =7īccaxņ (12) where the functional form for x given in (11) has been used. Thus, equation (9) becomes with the use of relations (3) and (10): v = T k = ~T^ = {~)2(; (13) k condkm con At resonance, where the external frequency is equal to the natural frequency of the system, the loss factor is given simply by: ?1 = 2Ç (14) In performing the vibration tests, it was assumed that beams that have similar stiffness and damping in these tests, will also have similar responses, under impact, when shaped into a rib-like structure. 493</page><page sequence="5">Baseline Tests with EAR Isodamp CN Material The test results with the Isodamp CN material are given in Table 2: Table 2. Response of Isodamp CN material in vibration tests Quantity Temperature (°C) 18.3 22.8 26.7 Amplitude Ratio .43 .31 .30 Period (sec) .059 .061 .067 Stiffness (N/m) 2030 1940 1640 Damping (N-s/m) 4.04 4.69 6.5 Using the values at 22.8° as reference, there is a 4.5% change in stiffness and 14% change in damping at the lower temperature. At the higher temperature, the difference is more dramatic. There is a 15% decrease in stiffness and 39% increase in damping. As indicated previously, the change is due to significant decrease in the dynamic modulus curve of the Isodamp CN material in the temperature interval between 10° - 30° C, which the temperature range of interest for testing crash test dummies. The loss factor (which is related to the damping) also increases somewhat in the same interval. FINITE ELEMENT MODELING A finite element model of the vibrating beam system was developed to evaluate a number of candidate materials. The ABAQUS FE code [Hibbit, et al. 1997] was used to perform preliminary analysis of the damping characteristics of steel beams with damping adhesives such as supplied by 3M. The number of elements in each layer was increased to 40 until the results showed very small variation in the predicted response of the beam. The steel beam was modeled using beam elements and the results validated against the experimental results. The viscoelastic layer was also modeled using beam elements. The viscous damping option in ABAQUS was utilized in modeling the viscoelastic interlayers. The modeling results showed that the thickness of the adhesive (damping material) was a major factor in improving overall damping of the layered system. Figure 3 shows a graph comparing the results from the FE model and the original test for the acceleration time history at the edge of the beam. The graph shows the results from models using both plate elements and beam elements. The test curve shows some secondary oscillations that resulted from the manual release of the end of the beam. Also, it is seen that there is good agreement for the first three oscillations after which the FE curves begin to lead the test curve. The level of agreement was adequate for using the FE model to evaluate potential designs. Figure 3. Comparison of beam acceleration from test and predicted by the FE model. The FE models were used to predict the stiffness and damping characteristics of multi-layered constrained systems with the viscoelastic adhesive in-between layers. The basic form of the model is shown in the Figure 4. Figure 4. Sample output from FE model of cantilever beam. The initial models consisted of two metal layers with the viscoelastic adhesive layer in-between. Two cases were examined. In the first case, a layer of aluminum was attached to a steel backing layer, while in the second case another steel layer was substituted for the aluminum. Standard properties were used for the steel and aluminum. The properties of the viscoelastic layer were obtained from literature published by 3M [3M Technical Data Sheet, 1999], The loss factor (t|) is approximately 1 .0 in the temperature and frequency range of interest. This would indicate a damping ratio (Oof about 0.5 using equation (13). The initial modeling indicated that significant damping could be achieved using the 3M type viscoelastic damping layers, though the metal-metal layers were not optimized to produce the desired level of damping. Additonal simulations were performed to examine the response of the vibrating beam with a thicker layer of the 3M adhesive. Some of the simulations also used a a composite beam bonded to the steel. Both carbon fiber and glass fiber composites were evaluated. A summary of the results are shown in Table 3 below. 494</page><page sequence="6">Table 3. Results from ABAQUS simulations with 3 ayer model. Description Stiffness Damping (N/m) (Ns/m) Steel+adhesive+carbon 860 5.1 Steel+adhesive+glass q2ą 5 -ļ Steel+adhesive+steel '21Z 5 4 It is seen that all three beams show comparable levels of damping. The steel on steel construction had the highest stiffness, but this would probably make the whole ribcage too rigid. Thus, interest was mainly focused on composite materials. The results from the modeling suggested that a viscoelastic adhesive like the 3M-130 could provide the type of damping being sought. With the appropriate selection of the constraint layers, it appeared that characteristics comparable to the original rib material could be achieved. VIBRATION TESTS WITH CONSTRAINED LAYER BEAMS The first step in designing the constrained layer beams was the selection of a suitable viscoelastic adhesive. Three different viscoelastic damping polymers were available from 3M, and of these the 3M-130 appeared to provide the best temperature response in the range of interest [3M Technical Data Sheet, 1999]. The damping polymers can be used in damping applications as free- layer dampers, as part of a constrained layer damping design, or as part of a laminate construction. They can be used with a variety of substrates, such as stainless steel, aluminum and polyester. A graduated series of tests were performed with the 3M- 130 tape both as free layers and as part of a constraint layer construction. A number of different materials were evaluated for their applicability, including steel and a number of different plastics and composites. As mentioned in the discussion of the preliminary FE modeling, a glass fiber or carbon fiber composite appeared to be a good candidate material for a constrained layer. A glass fiber composite was obtained in the form of strips. This particular composite contained continuous unidirectional E-Glass fibers pre-tensioned and aligned in an epoxy matrix. For these tests, strips of dimensions 267mm x 19mm x 3.2mm were used. Two configurations were tested. The first used a single layer with 5 layers of the 3M-130 in between the E-Glass and the base steel beam, while the second used two layers of the E-Glass and steel, with the 3M-130 between each layer. The structure of the two layer laminate is shown in Figure 5. rigure 5. Layout of the laminate with 2 layers of E- Glass. When two layers of the E-Glass were used (for 6.4mm thickness), there was a significant increase in damping and stiffness. This material appeared to have good response characteristics under vibration, and it was decided that a dummy rib with this material forming the constraining layers would be fabricated. Thinner samples (.8mm) of the material were ordered, in order that the material could be bent around the rib. It was decided that two layers of the material would be epoxied, and each 2-layer beam would form a constraining layer to be attached using the 3M-130 material. TESTS WITH PROTOTYPE RIB Single rib tests were conducted with the rib attached to a rigid support. A specially designed linkage system known as a CRUX was used to measure the deflection of the rib. CRUX systems were designed to measure the 3-dimensional deflection of the ribcage in the THOR dummy [White, 1996]. The unit was attached at the base to the back of the rib, and at the front to the rib end. A software program was used to convert the angular data from the rotary potentiometers used in the CRUX to X, Y, and Z deflections. The two free ends of the rib were connected with a 1/8" thick strip of stiff Urethane (the same material as used on the THOR outer bib). This allowed the rib to deform without the free ends generating additional vibrations. The initial impact tests with the ribs were performed with an impact pendulum. The pendulum consisted of an effective 5 kg moving mass with a 76mm x 152mm rectangular impact surface. An accelerometer was used to compute the impact force. As mentioned above, a CRUX linkage system was used to measure the deflection of the front of the rib. The setup for the test is shown in Figure 6. The back of the rib is supported on the fixture on the left and the face of the impactor is seen on the right just making contact with the front of the rib. The face of the impactor is covered with a 3.2mm layer of a Neoprene material to prevent metal-metal contact with the bolt heads at the front of the rib. 495</page><page sequence="7">Figure 6. Initial setup of rib impact test. Preliminary tests were conducted using the original EAR Isodamp CN material. Rib #4 from THOR (out of seven) was selected for the test. Tests were conducted at two impact speeds, namely, 2.1 m/s and 3.1 m/s. At these speeds, the expected deflections were about 30 mm and 50 mm. Tests were conducted to evaluate the response of the original rib in the temperature range of 18.3-23.7° C (65-80° F). The results are shown in Figures 7 and 8 below. Figure 7. Variation of force-deflection response of Isodamp CN with temperature at low speed. Figure 8. Variation of force-deflection response of Isodamp CN with temperature at high speed. The E-Glass fiber composite with the 3M-130 viscoelastic polymer was used to fabricate the equivalent laminated rib. The individual strips of the glass fiber were bonded using high strength epoxy. A special 3M primer was then used to bond the individual layers of the 3M viscoelastic layers to the spring steel rib and to the glass fiber laminates. A fabricated rib is shown in Figure 9 below alongside a standard rib using the Isodamp CN. Figure 9. Comparison of the glass fiber laminate and Isodamp CN ribs. It is seen that the laminated rib appears to have a larger profile than the CN rib. This arises because the E-Glass layers, which come in straight strips, have to be stressed to be bent into the elliptical shape and as they try to regain their straight shape they push the edges outwards. In the normal dummy ribcage, the individual ribs will be kept in place by a stiff bib that helps keep the outer shape within anthropometrically correct contours. The initial tests were performed at the operating temperature of 22.2° C (72° F). The aim of these tests was to tune the E-glass laminate rib to produce a response similar to that of original Isodamp CN damping material. It was found that the peak forces with the 2 layers of fiberglass were about 10% too low compared with the original. Therefore, another layer of the .¿mm fiberglass strip was added to the new rib. The new layer was attached to the previous layer with a ,635mm thick layer of the 3M-130 damping layer (equivalent to 5 layers of the stock tape). This was expected to increase the stiffness and damping and hence increase the peak force. The responses of the new construction are shown in Figures 10 and 11 below. It is seen from the graphs that the response of the E- glass rib was quite similar to that of the original Isodamp CN rib at both the lower and higher velocities. The degree of correspondence between the two rib designs in terms of stiffness and damping at both impact speeds provided confidence that such a rib design could be a feasible replacement for the current Isodamp CN ribs. 496</page><page sequence="8">Figure 10. Comparison of response of glass fiber laminate rib and original THOR rib at low speed. Figure 1 1 . Comparison of glass fiber laminate rib and original THOR rib at high speed. Tests were then conducted with the new 3-layer glass fiber rib at the temperatures of 18.3° C and 26.7° C. The impact response of the rib has been quantified by three parameters, namely, the maximum force, maximum deflection and hysteresis, (hysteresis is defined as the loss of energy during the impact and will be given by the area between the loading and unloading portions of the force-deflection curve). Table 4 shows the variation seen in these three impact response parameters for the Isodamp CN and the new fiberglass rib. Table 4. Comparison of Isodamp CN and fiberglass laminate in temperature range 18.3-26.7° C Rib Type Speed Change Change Change Max Force Max Defl Hysteresis Isodamp 2.1 m/s -26% +32% -7% CN 3.1 m/s -14% +28% -10% 3 layer 2.1 m/s -20% +22% -15% fiberglass 3.1 m/s -11% +15% -7% It is seen that the variation is reduced from the Isodamp CN material, except for the hysteresis at the low speed. There was actually very little variation in the glass fiber laminate rib in the temperature range 18.3-22.2° C (65- 72° F). The variation in this temperature range is shown in Table 5 below. Table 5. Comparison of Isodamp CN and fiberglass laminate in temperature range 18.3-22.2° C Rib Type Speed Change Change Change Max Force Max Defl Hysteresis Isodamp 2.1 m/s -16% +18% -0% CN 3.1 m/s -9% +13% +4% 3 layer 2.1 m/s &lt;-1% +1% +1% fiberglass 3.1 m/s -1% +2% +3% It is seen that the variation in maximum force and deflection are significantly smaller for the new laminated rib than the rib with the Isodamp CN damping material. Almost all the significant variation in the new rib occurred between 22.2-26.7° C (72-80° F). The greatest benefit in the E-Glass rib was in the reduction of the sensitivity in maximum deflection. Also, it is seen that for the E-Glass rib, the variation in the full temperature range is less at the higher impact speed. The next step was to try to identify the source of the temperature variation that was observed. It was not clear, which of the components was contributing to the variation at the higher temperature. One conjecture was that the 3M-130 damping material might be responsible. In such a case, reducing the fraction of the material in the system should improve the temperature response. With this in mind, a new rib was constructed with 2 layers of the 3M-130 material between the laminates instead of the original 5 layers. In this case, it was found that the fiberglass rib was slightly stiffer at both speeds (about 13% higher maximum force at the low speed impact and 8% higher force at the high speed impact). The peak deflections matched well and general shape of the force-deflection curve were again very similar. The variation of the response with temperature is shown in Table 6. Table 6.

It should be noticed that the change in hysteresis was reduced significantly, 497</page><page sequence="9">indicating that a significant part of the damping was being contributed by the 3M material (as might be expected). Examination of Influence of Epoxv We examined the properties of the adhesive used to bond the ,8mm thick strips of the E-Glass with each other. This epoxy was Hysol 9430 which we had used previously in the construction of the THOR ribs. The epoxy had been selected because it had a very high lap shear strength and was employed to improve the durability of the rib against debonding. The Hysol literature indicated the lap shear strength was fairly constant up to 25° C (about 5000 psi). Above this temperature, there was a sharp drop in strength. It was conjectured that this might have played a role in the reduction in stiffness of the rib in the range of 22.2-26.7° C. A number of different adhesives/epoxies were researched to determine if one could be found with better temperature properties. Two candidates were found. One was Hysol 9437 and the other was 3M 2214 adhesive. Testing with Hvsol 9437 Following the vibration tests, a rib was constructed using the new adhesive. The original construction of two 1.6mm strips and a single ,8mm strip was first tried. Three layers of 3M-130 were used based on the previous result that five layers of the 3M-130 appeared to have a higher temperature variance while two layers made the response somewhat stiffer than the regular Isodamp CN rib. The modified rib was found to be too soft, but there was an improvement in the temperature variation. The variation in peak force was reduced from 12% to 3% and variation in deflection from 18% to 10%. After some testing, a rib with three layers of 1 .6mm thick strips was found to produce good results. Three layers of the 3M-130 damping polymer was sandwiched between each pair of laminates. The variation in the response parameters is given in Table 7. Table 7. Change in response of glass fiber laminate rib using Hysol 9437 epoxy in temperature 18.3-26.7° C Rib Type Speed Change Change Change Max Force Max Defl Hysteresis 3 layer 2.1 m/s -4.9% +4.3% +2.7% fiberglass 3.1 m/s -12.0% +7.7% +1.2% The variation with temperature was reduced by more than 50% when compared with the variation seen with the standard Isodamp CN rib material. The magnitude of the response was also within the acceptable limits. Testing with 3M 2214 The 3M 2214 adhesive was also used in constructing a rib. In this case, two 1.6mm thick layers and a ,8mm thick layer were bonded together. Three layers of the 3M-130 tape were used between each glass fiber laminate. The force-deflection responses are shown in Figures 12 and 13 below. :igure 12. Force-deflection response of g ass fiber laminate rib using 3M 2214 at different temperatures (low speed). Figure 13. Force-deflection response of glass fiber laminate rib using 3M 2214 at different temperatures (high speed). Figures 12 and 13 also show the original Isodamp CN response at 22.2° C. The temperature variation was similar to that seen with the Hysol adhesive and showed a slightly stiffer response than the original Isodamp CN rib. These graphs should be compared with the comparable graphs for the Isodamp CN material given Figures 7 and 8.

Change in response with 2 1/2 layer laminate using 3M adhesive in temperature range 18.3-26.7° C Rib Type Speed Change Change Change Peak Force Max Defl Hysteresis 2 1/2 2.1 m/s -11.4% +6.7% +2.7% layer fiberglass 3.1 m/s -7.0% +7.0% +1.3% As with the Hysol 9437, using the 3M 2214 adhesive also reduced the variation seen with the standard Isodamp CN rib material by more than 50%. As indicated in Figures 12 and 13, the rib using this adhesive also matched the response of the existing Isodamp CN rib. The tests with the Hysol 9437 and the 3M 2214 adhesives and a rib constructed of constrained layer laminates of glass fibers show that both these ribs can qualify as candidates for a practical temperature insensitive rib. DURABILITY TESTING OF NEW LAMINATE RIBS A series of tests were performed to evaluate the durability of the new ribs and compare its performance with the existing ribs under multiple impacts. For the laminate rib, the last successful construction using two 1.6mm and one ,8mm E-Glass strips was used. The E- Glass strips were bonded using the 3M 2214 adhesive. A higher impact velocity of 3.8 m/s was used for the durability testing. This impact energy level leads to about 75 mm of maximum deflection and 700 N peak force. This amount of deformation is considered to be at the upper limit of what is expected within the thorax at the level of rib #4. A check was made to examine if the response of the original Isodamp CN rib and the new laminate rib were comparable at the higher energy level. Upon verifying that the responses were similar, a series of durability tests were done on the Isodamp CN rib. The comparison of the response of the rib at the start of the testing and after 50 tests is shown in Figure 14 below. During these tests, little time was allowed between tests. The material did not fully recover in this short time interval, so the results are the worst case example. The results indicate that after fifty tests there was an increase in the maximum deflection of about 10% and decrease in peak force of about 7%. There was very little change in the response after the first twenty tests, and most of the change occurred in the later tests. After the fifty tests were completed, the material was allowed to fully recover and after retesting the response returned close to the original. Figure 14. Durability and repeatability testing of Isodamp CN rib (50 tests). The new laminate construction was then tested under the same conditions. The results from the tests are shown in Figure 15. Figure 15. Repeatability of glass fiber laminate rib under multiple impacts (high severity). It is seen that there is no significant change in response for the first fifteen tests (graphs labeled 4dm3g301 and 4dm3g315), and as mentioned previously corresponded to the initial response of the Isodamp CN rib. After 20 tests (graph labeled 4dm3g320), there was a significant drop in the peak force and increase in the peak deflection, similar to what was seen with the CN rib described above. Again, very little time elapsed between consecutive tests. Upon examination of the rib, it was seen that there appeared to be some delamination of the 3M-130 layers from the laminate layers at the outer edges of the strip. A set of small clamps were used to press the laminate layers against the base spring steel and the arrangement left to sit for a couple of hours. Upon removing the clamps and retesting, it was seen that there was a significant recovery in the response of the rib (as shown by graph 4dm3g326). About 50% of the increased deflection was reduced. In order to verify if a longer period of clamping would be useful, the laminate rib was left clamped overnight and retested. The results of the tests conducted after clamping was removed are 499</page><page sequence="11">shown in Figure 16 below. It is now seen that the response from the 45th test (graph labeled 4dm3g345) now corresponded well with the results from the first five tests. Figure 16. Repeatability of glass fiber laminate rib following overnight clamping. The results from the durability tests indicated that the 3M-130 interlayers were susceptible to some performance degradation under rapid, severe, multiple testing. The degradation is reversible with proper clamping for an adequate amount of time. Since the durability tests were done under rather severe conditions, these results were very encouraging in allowing us to conclude that laminate construction would be a practical method for constructing and using the ribs under normal field conditions. It is also possible that upon further research, a better adhesive than the primer used for bonding the 3M-130 to the E-Glass can be found which maintains the bond for a larger number of tests. It is probably not a good idea to make a very strong bond for the 3M-130, since it will likely reduce the shear capacity of the material, which provides its good damping characteristics. DISCUSSION A new laminated rib structure has been fabricated, that has similar response characteristics as the current rib material, EAR Isodamp CN. It has significantly lower temperature variation in the temperature range 18.3- 26.7° C (65-80° F). The temperature variation in the stiffness and damping of the CN material has been a major limitation in the testing of crash dummies in a broader temperature regime. The new laminate construction consists of three laminate layers consisting of a fiberglass material, known as E-Glass. Each laminate layer is separated by a damping interlayer consisting of ,4mm (equivalent to 3 layers) of the 3M-130 Viscoelastic Polymer. The bottom layer is attached to a spring steel base, again with the 3M-130 material. The spring steel has a thickness of 1 .6mm and is the same material used in the current rib design using the Isodamp CN material. The laminate layers consist of bonded strips of the E- Glass. Each strip is ,8mm thick and two of these are bonded using an adhesive. Two different constructions proved to be successful. The first used three laminates, each 1 .6mm thick, with each laminate consisting of two of the ,8mm strips bonded with Hysol 9437. The second also used three laminates, two being 1.6mm thick, and the third ,8mm thick. The 1 ,6mm thick layers consisted of individual ,8mm thick strips bonded with 3M 2214. A comparison of the temperature variation of the responses of the two different laminate ribs and the original Isodamp CN are shown in Table 9 below. Table 9.

The variation is also within the reproducibility variation of a rib, which in a dynamic environment is usually accepted to be in the range of 15% - 20%. The difference in the average response of the laminate ribs with that of the standard Isodamp CN rib is given in Table 10 for the two impact speeds (at 22.2° C). Table 10.

At the lower impact speed, the rib using the 3M 2214 adhesive has a higher deflection than the CN rib than seen with the Hysol 9437. As indicated in the Introduction, the Kroell tests [Neathery, 1974] are the traditional way of evaluating the biofidelity of the dummy thorax. With the Isodamp CN rib, it has been observed in the Kroell test at the lower impact speed (4.3 m/s) that the maximum deflection response is at the lower end of the biomechanical corridor. Thus the larger deflection at the lower impact speed is actually desirable. Overall, both laminate ribs show behavior similar to that of the original rib material. The correspondence was further confirmed in tests using a different rib size, that of rib #6. The results show that the response of the laminate rib of this size is also very similar to that of the original CN rib. CONCLUSION Based on all the results, it is reasonable to expect that a complete ribcage constructed of a similar laminate of E- Glass with the 3M-130 acting as a damping interlayer, would show similar response as the original THOR ribcage. The durability of the laminate construction under severe impact conditions (one producing more than 75 mm of deflection) was also examined. Some degradation in the response under rapid repeat testing was found (after approximately 20 tests). The undesirable effects could be reversed by properly clamping the rib after a normal sequence of tests, to regain the original properties. The next step in the research is to develop a complete ribcage using the fiberglass laminates and verity its response under standard Kroell impacts. As part of this process the following areas will be addressed. Develop a practical manufacturing process for the ribs. • Improve fabrication process to reduce possible delamination of 3M-130 interlayer. Define response as a function of temperature with greater resolution. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was funded by a SBIR Phase I contract with the Volpe National Transportation System Center.
