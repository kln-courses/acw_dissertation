<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> “The Crowns of Their bābtum”:  On Wives, Wards, and Witnesses seth RiChaRdson  univeRsity of ChiCaGo BM 80989 is a late Old Babylonian tablet that documents the receipt of silver weighing less  than a teaspoon of salt, for the performance of ilku-work contracted out to an extended family;  the receipt was “witnessed” by the crowns of two gods. Both contracts for hired labor and the  use of divine emblems in legal contexts are well known from Old Babylonian sources, and our  text differs little from parallel texts in these broad contours. But the tablet introduces variations  on practice which prompt new questions about the relationships between wives and families,  households and neighborhoods, temples and wards, and between gods, their symbols, and men.  Two features in particular complicate the basic subject matter: one, the position of wives as les- sors for brothers-in-law; two, the appearance of divine emblems (in this case, crowns of Šamaš  and Marduk) in the company of other gods as witnesses. Let us first look at the text: tRansliteRation BM 80989 (Bu. 91–5-9, 1127) Date: Sd 04/09/01 Size: 48 × 47 × 23mm Receipt of silver for the performance of ilku-work; witnesses include Šamaš, Aya, and divine  emblems of “their babtum.”  KEY: ° = erasure « = ṣupru-marks obv.

Month 9, Day 1, Samsuditana Year 4. notes The text is not a house rental, contra Leichty et al. 1988: 247. The kišib epigraphs on the left edge appear directly next to double ṣupru-marks. l. 6: MAN = šanû, “another one, a second one,” obviously to clarify to any disbelieving  reader that there were indeed two women named Bēltani involved. l. 7: The partial erasure before the KA sign leaves traces suggesting the scribe began to  write either the DAM sign again, or a conflation of DAM and KA. The DN Ajamma other- wise occurs in OB onomastica in the PN Mār-Ajamma; Awat-Ajamma is, to my knowledge,  a unique personal name. ll. 8–9: DUMU.MEŠ PN here refers to the husbands, and not to the wives (i.e., as  “daughters-in-law”). However, the 2.f.pl. durative illakā specifies that the obligation of  Nanna-mansum’s ilku-duty lies on the wives—whether originally, or by force of this new  arrangement—and not their husbands. On syntactic and contextual grounds, we can rule out  Iluni as the referent of -šu in ilikšu. l. 15: It is also possible to read ma-ḫi-ra, but maḫrā seems the more likely form; note that  /aḫ/ and /ḫi/ are sometimes poorly distinguished from each other in this period. l. 17: The onomastic form Suḫumtim is unattested. A less likely option, but not impos- sible is [la?]-ḫu-um-tim. Cf. CAD L s.v. laḫmu s., ‘(hairy) monster’ or the like; such beings  were associated with Marduk and thus might belong in a list with other witnessing deities.  Laḫumtim, however, is also unattested, and the line lacks space for a preceding DINGIR  sign. l. 18: Two crowns for two deities rather than a single “double-crown” is the most likely  interpretation; see n. 49 below. l. 19: This abbreviated paleography of the /na/ sign is normal for Late OB texts; it should  not be confused with /an/, the writing of which is emphasized with very long, extended hori- zontal strokes; compare /an/ signs in ll. 2, 3, 7, 8, 16, 18, and 22. disCussion The writing is perfectly legible, and in its main purpose the text is quite straightforward:  two women—who are not nadiātu—receive silver in payment for the hired labor of three  men, all of them related to the lessors as brothers-in-law, to perform the ilku-service of  their father, presumably deceased; the text is witnessed by two divinities, one unidentified  agent, and two divine emblems. Yet these briefly stated conditions are peculiar in their own  right, in two different respects: first, in the appearance of the women as lessors for the labor  of brothers-in law; second, in the appearance of divine emblems, the crowns of Šamaš and  Marduk, in three distinct senses: 1) in the crowns’ situation as witnesses stricto sensu, rather  than as objects upon which oaths were sworn or testimony delivered; 2) in the apparent  legal and theological redundance of Šamaš and his crown appearing simultaneously; 3) in  that the crowns are said to belong to the ward (bābtum)—and specifically to the ward of the  wives (bābtišina). I’ll address these peculiarities in three imperfectly bounded senses: the  functional-situational, the legal, and the theological. </page> <page sequence="4"> 626 Journal of the American Oriental Society 132.4 (2012) the text’s people and pRaCtiCes Three practical details warrant brief recognition before we get to the larger issues pre- sented by the text. First, two pairs of fingernail impressions on the left edge appear next to  the names of the Beltani’s. Second, the scribe of the text was kind enough to take the trouble  to clarify that there are indeed two different Beltani’s in the text by adding šanû in l. 6.  Third, we have two previously unattested personal name forms here, Awat-Ajamma (l. 7)  and Suḫumtim 1 (l. 17). No archival setting for the text can be established at this time. Only one of the actors  in this text can be even possibly identified in other texts. 2 The Awīl-Sîn to whom the first  Bēltani is married may be the same man known from two substantially earlier documents,  both also from Sippar. In both of these texts, he appears as a purchaser in credit sales: 3 the  first of these texts is BM 81239 (Ad 26), in which Awīl-Sîn receives palace wool from the  well-known UGULA DAM.GÀR Ilšu-ibni; 4 the second text is VS 29 55 (Aṣ 05), drafted  eighteen years before our present text, in which Awīl-Sîn receives silver as capital for the  purchase of grain. 5 Assuming that the Awīl-Sîn of the earlier (Ad 26) text was at least eigh- teen years old, and that he was the same person, he would have reached age fifty or more by  the time our text was drafted in Sd 04. 6 But even this would not tell us much more than that  the principals were in middle age; we really cannot say more about any of these people on  present evidence, not even to explain the unusual homonymity of the Bēltani’s.  An archival approach to the text thus leads to a dead end. Perhaps a generic approach can  help. The text discusses subjects common to the period—ilku-payments and labor hires—but  their co-occurrence is actually unique. Can we find comparanda?  7 In terms of text types, we  could look at the text as essentially either a receipt for ilku-silver (as it technically is), or as  the satisfaction of a contract of hire (which it suggests). Let us begin with the first document  type: no other receipt for ilku-silver from this period—twenty-six have been published (see  Table 1) 8—establishes labor as the medium of exchange occasioning the delivery of that  1.  It is not entirely clear that the reconstructed [Su]ḫumtim (l. 17) indicates a person. The onomastic form is  unattested, but no alternative presents itself; though one might expect a deity or a divine object to be listed here,  such a reconstruction seems impossible. 2. It is not impossible that the Nanna-mansum s. Marduk-mušallim in VS 18 31 (Aṣ 03) and YOS 13 308  (Aṣ 08) is the father of the Marduk-mušallim in our text—a possible case of papponymy—but this is speculative.  Extending this thinking about papponymy, Amanda Podany has pointed out to me that it is not impossible that the  Nanna-mansum of l. 8 was the grandfather of the Nanna-mansum in l. 3, and thus the Bēltani’s were actually the  great-aunts rather than the sisters-in-law of the hired men. For neither of these two cases, unfortunately, is there any  supporting—or confounding—evidence. 3. It is further possible that Awīl-Sîn s. Nanna-mansum is identical with the Overseer of the gagûm Awīl-Sîn s.  Sîn-[ ], ÌR Ammiṣaduqa, active between Aṣ 04–14. If this patronym were to be restored as Sîn-[iddinam], it might  in turn be an onomastic variant of Nanna-mansum; see Tanret 1996: 193, 206. Notwithstanding, this equation seems  unlikely. 4.

The payments normally range between 1⁄2 and 12 GÍN KÙ.BABBAR, averaging  about three shekels; our text stipulates less than one shekel (a little over six grams, about the  9.

Westbrook 2003: 368–69. Lautner (1936: 42–46) distinguished hires of occasional wage laborers (“Lohn- mann, Lohnarbeiter”) as rentals, identifiable by the payment of kiṣru (KA.KEŠDA), a “contractual price,” from the  hires of semi-free laborers (“Mietling”), mostly remunerated with idum, “wages.” </page> <page sequence="6"> 628 Journal of the American Oriental Society 132.4 (2012) weight of a nickel), close to that of the smallest similar transaction. Despite the modesty of  this amount, the contract offers the labor of not one, but three replacements, and the tablet  is heavily authorized in comparison to other receipts. Of these twenty-six ilku tablets, only  nine are witnessed; two more are expedited (GÌR) by an official; one more is both witnessed  and expedited. 11 In only one case are gods among the witnesses (igi DN1 / igi DN2 / igi PN  DUB.SAR), 12 and nowhere as the objects of an oath; in no cases are emblems mentioned at  all. The contrast with our text is stark: in terms of silver, the document is a pocket-change  transaction with big-deal witnesses. Why? The text is also unique among these silver receipts in presenting an ilku-payment as a  family affair. The ilku-obligation of BM 80989 is said to rest on the women (l. 9, illakā  against illikū), presumably transferred from the deceased (or so I assume) Nanna-mansum  (ša ilikšā). But in no other ilku-receipt does a woman (or, indeed, any family member) act on  behalf of or in concert with another family member. Yet, if here we have a case in which the  transference of a service obligation between family members is made explicit, it still brings  more questions than answers. Why did the text not trouble to specify that Nanna-mansum  was dead (a not uncommon feature)? Why did the obligation pass to the daughters-in-law,  and not, apparently, to any of the five sons? And if this was an obligation incumbent upon  the family, what circumstances made it necessary for an outside third party to satisfy the obli- gation by providing the ilku-silver in exchange for labor? In sum, all other known receipts  for ilku-silver are relatively simple payment documents, against which our terse little text  already presents a more elaborate background. If we look at our text as the satisfaction of a hire (which technically it is not), we could  look at hire texts as well. Since these texts are more numerous—forty-six in all (see Table  2) 13—we might feel it twice as likely that some parallels could emerge. But among these hire  texts, there is no mention of ilku; no gods or emblems act as witnesses or objects of oaths; 14  no men are hired out by their sisters or sisters-in-law (or wives, for that matter). 15 Women do  appear as lessors in at least nine cases (20%): twice, the lessor is the hiree’s mother; 16 twice,  the lessor is the nadītu owner of a slave; 17 three more times, the lessor is a nadītu, without  either family relationship or ownership status to the hiree specified; 18 in two more cases, the  female lessor is unrelated to the hiree. 19 11.

We can also rule out the idea that the text merely required  the names of the Bēltani’s to appear purely for formal purposes—that is, by some internal  logic of contract law or scribal practice, some name—any name—was required to be listed  as principal, where the name of the real lessor for some reason could not be given. But since  self-hires were the single most common method of hire, followed closely by hires by broth- ers, it is impossible to see why in this case any of the five sons of Nanna-mansum could not  have acted in this capacity. 22 The rarity of mothers, wives, and sisters as lessors of course reflects the rarity of house- holds under the legal authority of women altogether. The few businesswomen of the era  usually either had some situationally independent legal status—widows, nadiātu, etc. 23—or  they acted in concert with their fathers or husbands. Neither situation pertains in the case of  the Bēltani’s. Are we to understand that by some dire circumstance or unorthodox inheri- tance the Bēltani’s were in fact the heads of household? The closest comparable case to my  knowledge comes from Late Bronze Age Emar, where daughters could be legally established  as “sons” and widows as “fathers” 24—but only in inheritance documents, and never with a  lateral, same-generation inversion of legal power, i.e., of wives over husbands or sisters over  brothers. 25 We might be tempted to explain this unusual text by pointing to a growing lack of unifor- mity in all kinds of documentary practices in Samsuditana’s reign, as the Babylonian state  slowly unraveled. In this regard, we could note that BM 80989 is, in fact, the latest-dated  receipt for ilku-silver known. 26 But the text itself indicates that a wealth of legal institutions  and practices still held force: contracts, the temple, the city ward, witnessing, and the implied  royal obligation to deliver ilku all still structured the legal environment. We must conclude  that these women had at least situational household authority over their brothers-in-law and,  implicitly, their husbands, Awīl-Sîn and Awat-Ajamma. Moreover, within the framework of  this document, the designation of the bābtum as “their” ward—that is, the sisters’ ward— implies that their household authority was recognized at the level of the  community. The case thus backs up Ray Westbrook’s dictum that “Legal capacity was . . . more a  function of one’s position in the household than of one’s sex or age.” 27 It may further be, as  Van De Mieroop has argued, that our text merely makes explicit what other texts do not— that some people whose gender we cannot clearly identify by onomastics, whom “we con- 20. Other than the two instances of mothers as lessors, in six cases the lessor is the hiree’s father, and in eight  cases, a brother. 21. Even for nadiātu; see Harris 1962 and Richardson 2010b: 338, sub Table 2C. 22. Lautner (1936: 245) briefly considered, but doubted, the possibility of such fictive arrangements. One other  unusual aspect of BM 80989 is that—though it is not, strictly speaking, a hiring contract—it would be unique in  implying more than one lessor. All of the forty-six texts in Table 2 specify a single lessor. 23. Diakonoff (1986: 227–28) saw among period documents from Ur only four types of women appearing  in texts who were not “under patriarchal authority”: priestesses and paupers (whom he treated together, the latter  “probably . . . ḫarimtum-prostitute[s]”), “judges of the temple court,” and women acting as witnesses. 24. In case of widows, their status was also sometimes termed “head of household.” 25. Westbrook 2001: 36–41. 26. YOS 13 360 is dated Sd 2. 27.

It may be that the emblems stand in the final  (textual) position in the witness list usually occupied by scribes of record in other contracts  and legal documents—but without comparanda, we are in the dark here. There are four further challenges for analysis. One, even among known emblems, the  appearance of the crowns of gods—as opposed to the more common divine “weapons” or  “standards”—is unique. Two, the identification of the emblems as belonging to “their city  quarter” (bābtišina) has no immediate parallels. To lean too heavily on the little preposition  ša, not without its ambiguities, seems insufficient to settle beyond the shadow of a doubt the  crucial ownership/custodianship questions raised, but the plain reading is that “crowns of  their ward” means that the women’s ward owned the crowns. To these first two problems we  will return shortly. A third problem: though oaths taken and testimony delivered on divine emblems are both  well-attested practices, 30 emblems acting as witnesses (i.e., designated by IGI) is not. I am  not aware of any other case in which emblems are said to have been (active) witnesses rather  than the passive objects upon which principals and witnesses swore oaths. 31 The importance  of this distinction is difficult to evaluate. This may be nothing more than a formal variation  of a general practice in which (human) witnesses swore oaths to the validity of transactions  or testimony. On the other hand, it may point to a fully anthropomorphized role for both  gods and emblems in oath practices. 32 Again we can come to no certain conclusions, but it  is worth pointing out the potential significance of substituting the thing normally sworn upon  for the agent doing the swearing. 28. Van De Mieroop 1992: 216. 29. For additional gods see, e.g., MHET II 396, 403, 406; for personal names, see, e.g., MHET II 443, 468, 476,  and 514. Šamaš is also known to have acted as a principal in contracts, mostly loans (e.g., BM 78491, 81328), in  this period: see Veenhof 2004. 30. Pongratz-Leisten 2011a: 106, 109; Spaey 1994: 413–14; Porter 2009: 183. A related function may have  been to compel truth-telling generally (van Lerberghe 1982: 254), as with a modern witness’ oath in a court proceed- ing. See also the note by Hallo (1981: 255, on l. 132). 31. Spaey’s (1994) overview cites no instance of this variation. Ellis (1986: 779) points to an Old Babylonian  text from Ishchali published by Greengus (1979: 97, no. 27, pl. XIV), in which an “x-(?)u2-mu-um” (“presumably  an emblem”) of the god Bēl-gašer may be restored—this much is true—acting “probably as a witness.” But this  cannot be true, since the object is listed (with another divine emblem) on the text’s obverse, i.e., not in the position  of a witness. 32. That is, a Babylonian oath before a god or testimony before an emblem was not as allusive as the “So help  me God” sworn on a Bible in American courts; it required both the physical presence of images and emblems, and  the enactment or performance of their participation in legal processes. Gell (1998) would have held this distinction  to be one of degree, not kind, but he also insisted that the physicality of secondary agency was important in the  symbolic systems of idols, which permitted “real physical interactions to take place between persons and divinities.  To treat such interactions as ‘symbolic’ is to miss the point” (p. 135). </page> <page sequence="10"> 632 Journal of the American Oriental Society 132.4 (2012) The fourth and most curious aspect of the presence of the emblems, however, is that of  their seeming redundancy: since we normally assume that an emblem of a god implies his  presence pars pro toto, why was it necessary to have both Šamaš and his crown attend- ing the same proceeding? 33 We know of many instances in which divine symbols were  used away from the temple, on which more below, but we assume in those cases that the  objects implied the presence of the deity with which they were identified—a divine stan- dard of Sîn, a divine bird of Ninmarki, a divine spade of Marduk, etc. 34 Their divinity may  be anticipated from the cases in which the emblems were identified by the determinative  DINGIR (in both Sumerian and Akkadian writings, though there was little consistency in  written practice). And this divinity, in turn, we might suppose derived from their essentially  synechdochic relationship to various gods, i.e., as parts or possessions of these deities. But  in this case, the simultaneous witnessing of Šamaš and his crown reveals that these entities  were perceived as neither duplicative nor derived—that emblems possessed specific powers  in their own right. 35 But this still does not explain why both the god and the emblem were needed in this  particular case (there are also religious-symbolic implications of this simultaneity—see  below—but I will first attend to the legal ones). The physical and social location of the  proceeding, and the multiple institutions represented, suggest that the overlapping symbol- ism was a solution to overlapping jurisdictions—i.e., in the coincidence of the bābtum and  external authorities. This jurisdictional extensibility was probably true for all legal uses of  divine emblems—they were all used in places exterior to the temple—at city gates, in courts,  for tax-collection in rural areas. But in three known contexts, divine emblems were used in  legal proceedings specific to city quarters: 36 BE 6/2 58: 1 (Nippur): 37 urudu.šita Ninurta ina bābtim izzizma šībātušu izzizama, “The  mace of Ninurta was present in the ward and the pertinent (lit: his) female witnesses were  also present.” BE 6/1 103: 33 (Sippar): 38 ēma ša i-im 2 šurinnū ša Šamaš [ana] dag.gi.a urdūma ukīnšu,  “Wherever . . . , two emblems of Šamaš went down [to] the ward and he (i.e., the guilty  party) installed (them) there.” RA 25 43: 5 (provenance unknown): šurinnam rabâm ša Sîn ušēṣ[iu] babtum ù itašu  izzizuma, “They took out the great symbol of Sîn; the ward and its neighbors(?) 39 took up  a position.” One wishes that among the comparanda there were more unanimity of language, since  each text uses a different verb to describe how an emblem came to stand in the city  quarter— 33.

Though a full translation has eluded its editors (and this author), the clause does begin with  ēma, “wherever,” implying variability of place—of situational practice, that installation sites  could be subject to the needs of the moment. 43 At a minimum, what seems important about  emblems in the abstract is their mobility and appropriateness to specific civic spaces away  from temples—in their capacity for phenomenological impact. Why did the bābtum need such emblems? The legal role of the bābtum in relation to other  authoritative units is not well understood. Norman Yoffee thought that the bābtum-institution  was marked primarily by regulation of its own membership, “especially concerned with the  allocation of special roles and property” among a group composed of associated “households”  (i.e., É PN). 44 Unfortunately, hard evidence for the bābtum as an institution is scarce. Andrea  Seri, having made an exhaustive study of local juridical bodies, concludes that “although the  city ward was probably a relatively independent authority, it rarely appears with the local  powers considered in this study.” 45 One wonders if the word “although” ought to be replaced here with “because”: because of  its autonomous nature, it rarely interacted with other institutions. What could have brought  these units together in this case? It is difficult to divine what interest the temple would have  had in either family business or ilku-payments, the latter a concern of the Crown. The answer  seems to lie in the fact that BM 80989 deals with social circumstances outside of commu- nity norm—the exercise of household authority by women over men—necessitating multiple  40. waṣû, warādu+kânu, izuzzum; cf. nasāhum, “to pull out,” used for the šurinnu-emblem (van Lerberghe  1982: 255; Westbrook 2003: 374, 410), and in comparison to still other verbs used for the appearance of emblems  in judicial proceedings: izuzzum, erēbum, alākum, šakānum, etc. 41. Some modest evidence exists to suggest that emblems may have been housed in their own small structures  (bitāti): See CAD Š/III s.v. šurinnu s. 1 for references to the É(.MEŠ) of various ŠU.NIR, as against a (few) setting  them in a temple (É DN, e.g., ibid., 1e and 1f). 42. Ur also revealed other neighborhood “chapels” (e.g., No. 1 Paternoster Row) and household shrines (e.g.,  No. 2 Church Lane); see Van De Mieroop 1992: 138–41, 145. 43. With Schorr a century ago (1913: 378), I read the signs /ša i-im/ here, although the ša appears more akin to  other /ta/ signs in the text. CAD Š/III s.v. šurinnu 1 neither transliterates nor translates these three signs. One possi- bility is that this is an erroneous writing for šīm (&lt; šiāmu, “to decree, determine”), which is contextually appropriate  to the passage (i.e., “wherever deemed appropriate,” or the like), but one would have to blame the scribe. Regard- less, ēma implies the variability of where a symbol might be erected. 44. Yoffee (1978: 27–29) understood the “extended families” of a bābtum to imply kinship relations “having  very little to do with exclusive biological descent relationships, but rather the formulation of political and social  allegiances between groups.” 45. Seri 2005: 187; earlier, she writes, p. 170: “Unfortunately, I could not find any document where the elders,  the city, or the bābtum appear in close connection with the assembly.” See also Westbrook 2003: 366. Dombradi  (1996: 18–19) notes the legal appearance of the bābtum also in VS 7 56 (Ad 24), VS 18 1 (RS 55), VS 7 16 (SI 3),  CT 2 1 (n.d.), and CT 2 9 (Si 6). </page> <page sequence="12"> 634 Journal of the American Oriental Society 132.4 (2012) levels of authorization, especially that of the neighborhood. That the women acted outside  of normal social practices might have rendered the transaction more than usually susceptible  to challenge, and thus the document required adjudication at multiple levels—by household,  temple, and ward—even though the latter regulated only internal affairs, normally outside  of the sphere of textuality. The intersection of jurisdictions and questions of social custom  required both ward and temple to step into the affair. 46 This conjecture about bending social norms is borne out by two of the three bābtum- and-emblem cases cited above: in BE 6/2 58 a groom is suspected of jilting his bride, and  in RA 25 43 a family attempts to reclaim a dissolved paternal estate within a ward. In both  cases, one could imagine neighborhood customs and tempers being offended. In the third  case (BE 6/1 103), however, it is hard to see any implication of social custom: the text deals  with litigation between private parties and authorities from Babylon about muštābiltu-tax, 47  adjudicated by the judges of Sippar. The question of custom and community must therefore  remain unresolved for now. Still, our text highlights that divine emblems were symbols particular to individual parts  of the city and countryside, and not universal symbols of temple power everywhere. Two  implications emerge from this observation. The first is that individual communities were  bound to larger institutions through their custodianship of sacred objects and instrumenta  recognized by temple and state—illustrating the co-existence and interplay of not only insti- tutional and popular forms of religion, but also of “high” and “low” legal cultures. 48 The  second implication is that individual wards could have varying community standards, cus- toms, and social expectations, even when they lived under the same sets of state nomoi and  the authority of the same officials. theoloGiCal iMpliCations  We cannot say much about the physical appearance of these specific Sippar crowns. They  were almost certainly individual crowns of the two gods rather than (somehow) a double- crown belonging to the two gods together. 49 What might the crowns have looked like? A  crown of Šamaš, for one, is depicted on Hammurabi’s stele, where the god wears a “multiple  horned crown, and rays of sunlight emerge from his shoulders.” This image accords well  with other images of him on seal impressions, on the so-called “Sun-god Tablet,” and on the  Susa stele. 50 But this hardly distinguishes the Šamaš crown from the iconography of many  46. Spaey (1994: 414–15) has already drawn attention to the dispute-resolution function of the emblems of  Šamaš. 47. That the writing appears as še’am ša mu-uš-ke-ne-tim (= muškēnūtu?) calls this reading of muštābiltu into  question, as CAD M/2 admits. 48. Pongratz-Leisten (2011a: 107–8) has in this connection astutely recalled that divine standards served as  city-emblems in various third-millennium contexts. 49. Though “double-crowns” are also known, they were normally for individual gods, not shared: see CAD A/1  s.v. agû A 1a–1′, AGA.AGA, a “double-crown(?) of Zababa,” and 1a–2′, 2 AGA.MEŠ dEN.ZU, a “double tiara of  Sîn.” Conversely, see ibid., citing BBSt. pl. 98: AGA dŠamaš mušši 2, “crown of Šamaš . . . two (wr. next to the  crown of Šamaš),” seemingly a second or alternate crown for this deity, perhaps with the implication that it had  previously been lost or forgotten (mušši). 50. These images are very consistent in supplying the crown of Šamaš with four horns and a slightly rounded  top. Bahrani 2007: 158; Munn-Rankin 1959: 22; al-Gailani Werr 1978: 62–63, but noting elsewhere (1986: 463)  that sealings of this Late Old Babylonian period tended to simplify divine crowns by replacing them with mere  “pointed caps.” </page> <page sequence="13"> RiChaRdson: “The Crowns of Their bābtum” 635 other Mesopotamian gods, though a few seals reveal a small ring (or sun) shape surmounting  his conical crown. 51 The crown of Šamaš is poorly known from textual sources, too. The only year name of the  First Dynasty of Babylon mentioning a divine crown (though many year names refer generi- cally to unspecified “emblems” or “objects”) is Apil-Sîn 8—two hundred years before BM  80989 was drafted. The year 8b formula refers to a crown made for Šamaš of red gold; the  8a formula clarifies it as “Year in which Apil-Sîn made for Šamaš in Babylon the crown of  heaven (AGA.AN.NA) with lapis-lazuli” (my emphasis). The location presumably excludes  the possibility that this was the Sippar crown of our present text. 52 The Marduk crown seems even less distinctive: a Kassite reference to a crown of Mar- duk described it as bearing šalummatu, “shimmering light,” as a “tall horned crown of gold  and lapis lazuli, ornamented with various precious stones” 53—but little other description is  available. In glyptic imagery, Šamaš and Marduk are mostly identified by entirely different types of  insignia—the saw and the spade, principally—and so the individuality of the crowns seems  unimportant. 54 In any event, it is impossible to know if the cult objects described in our text  either were or resembled the images or terms we can cull from period sources. More likely,  the two crowns appearing here were uniquely local iterations. It is virtually impossible, for  instance, that the Marduk crown of this Sippar bābtum was the same as the one safely tucked  in the Esagila in Babylon, and this in turn casts some doubt on the identity of the Šamaš  crown in the Ebabbar and the one in this Sippar bābtum. Whether the two crowns were even  modeled on those of the temple images—or to what extent—we will never know. The most  that can be said is that the particularity of physically unique items owned by the ward begins  to shed some light on their religious significance. There is no particular reason to think that crowns (more than other types of objects) were  symbolically appropriate to this proceeding. Divine weapons and other types of objects, not  crowns, were the ones generally associated with oath-taking. In the three comparable legal  contexts of bābtum and emblem noted above, for instance, the divine objects took the shape  of a mace and two unspecified forms.  55 One cannot say that their significant metaphorical  uses alluded to either justice or community. Crowns instead played, unsurprisingly, a promi- nent role in kingship symbology, for both men and gods. 56 Nor does the pairing of Šamaš  and Marduk seem especially significant here, though it is less expected than the pairing  51. See Porada 1948: II, nos. 394, 399, 401, 402, and (most clearly) 421 (Pls. LVII–LVIII, LX) for these  instances—five from among thirty-three images of Šamaš (compare with image no. 12 in Boehmer [1975: 432]).  The earlier Akkadian period images of this god (Porada 1948: nos. 178–94) reveal no such emblem surmounting the  crown. Unfortunately, none of the seals can be provenanced, with the probable exception of no. 399, the epigraph  of which points to an Uruk origin; cf. Buchanan 1981, especially nos. 749, 816, and 956, where the figure of Šamaš  is epigraphically labeled. 52. An early temple hymn describes Šamaš of the Ebabbar as “tying on a SUḪ10-crown at night,” but this is  even less informative: all kinds of deities, kings, and even temple personnel are identified in Sumerian literature as  wearing this type of crown, and we have no idea what it looked like. 53. Winter 1994: 128. 54. Berlejung (1998: 40–41) makes exactly this point. 55. Ibid.: 165, 183–84: Porter suggests that it was the active power of the weapon that made it appropriate to  oath-enforcement. The composition “Gilgameš, Enkidu and the Netherworld” (ETCSL 1.8.1.4) has a fragmentary  variant (UET 6 60) which may allude to a practice of touching the crown of Šamaš, apparently as a form of welcome  into the palace for the people of Uruk; cf. Spaey (1994: 412): in Elam, “the litigant who ‘touched’ the [emblem]  lost the divine protection . . .” 56. Asher-Greve 1995: 185–86; e.g., an epithet of Utu of Larsa is “grandly suitable for the shining crown”  (MEN.KÙ.GA [GAL.BI] TÚM.MA); Frayne 1990: 157. </page> <page sequence="14"> 636 Journal of the American Oriental Society 132.4 (2012) of Šamaš and Aya, who were routinely co-witnesses in Sippar texts. Šamaš and Marduk  are found together in some other contexts, occasionally as the deities invoked in royal  inscriptions of the dynasty; 57 some earlier year names pair these deities; 58 and a Marduk  cult is attested at Sippar.  59 Perhaps the most compelling context in which the gods appear  together is their near-ubiquity in northern Babylonian letters. The wish that “Šamaš and  Marduk keep you in good health” (almost always in that order) begins so many letters that  it attains an everyday quality as a common custom, the vernacular politesse of the Baby- lonian realm. 60 Still, no real pattern emerges to suggest that the pairing evoked any special  theological authority, unless it makes oblique reference to Marduk as a representative of the  King of Babylon. As mentioned above, the simultaneous presence (but independent agencies) of Šamaš and  his crown does not seem paradoxical. I have argued that emblems were not mere proxies for  their respective gods, but numinous talismans in their own right. This point is even more  strongly supported by the fact that the objects in question were the crowns of gods, since  crowns were not merely, as Barbara N. Porter puts it, “tools used by anthropomorphic gods,  but instead belong to the category of objects that served them as marks of their divinity or as  insignia of their authority.” 61 In other words, a crown’s principal metaphoric purpose was to  refer to the god himself rather than some function of that god, and so the simultaneity here  is all the more striking. The seeming imbalance in the representational structure also emphasizes the symbolic  independence of the crowns, since there was no crown for Aya (the goddess who was on  hand), but there was one present for Marduk (who was not). The crowns were not equal and  reciprocal symbols brought out to meet or match the divine images; they were different wit- nesses for different constituencies. This particularization ought to be considered even when  we find divine emblems alone and not in the company of particular gods—even if they are  identified as the property of a particular god. Following Beate Pongratz-Leisten (who follows Alfred Gell), we can usefully problema- tize the “representativeness” of emblems first by identifying them as “social agents,” as  entities which “cause events to happen in their vicinity,” in Gell’s words, because “in prac- tice, people do attribute intentions and awareness to objects like cars and images of gods”  (emphasis mine). 62 Next, however, comes the question of whether or not the crowns stood  as what Gell understands as “primary” or “secondary” agents, the latter defined as “objec- tive embodiments of the power or capacity to will their use [by primary agents].” 63 Were the  emblems perceived as entities operating on behalf of or as extensions of their gods (i.e., as  secondary agents)? Or were they seen as entities independently capable of causation? Here I  57. Frayne 1990: 335 (E4.3.6.2), 348 (E4.3.6.12), and 413 (E4.3.9.2). There are no mentions of divine crowns  among inscriptions of this dynasty. 58. The year names Samsuiluna 6a/b and 33 and Ammiditana 01 and 02 put these divinities together, princi- pally as the gods commanding royal acts. 59.

BM 78577 (Aṣ 09),  an unpublished partial repayment for a credit sale of crown wool, was co-witnessed by Šamaš and Marduk rather  than Šamaš and Aya; that the payment is stipulated to be brought to Babylon from Sippar is probably relevant  (Richardson 2002: II.215). 60.

To the gods? To the temple? To the bābtum? To the women? To the court? Which of these  proposed primary agents “distributed its agency in the causal milieu” 64 to the emblems? In  my opinion, this very ambiguity was the point: between social actors and institutions, it was  the special ability of objects, if only through their cryptic silence, to validate or even con- stitute 65 multiple authorities simultaneously. It was precisely in situations of social conflict  where the over-particularity of laws and customs was unhelpful; the function of emblems  was to permit different actors to agree concurrently, if on different premises. If there was anything truly particular about how the objects were used, it most likely had  to do with place. It is helpful to recall here the point made earlier about the uses of emblems  in places outside the temple. The other major legal context in which divine emblems were  used—the cumbersomely named “rental of the journey of the weapon of Šamaš”—was in the  collection of in-kind revenues from rural communities. 66 In those cases, the emblems were  rented out by the temple authorities and then carried out to farming towns by the lessees. The  “weapons,” by the logic of these contracts, were owned by the temple, unlike the emblems  identified in BM 80989, which belonged to the ward. 67 Building on the common feature that divine emblems were deployed to social units other  than the temple, we can observe that the temple and state built out their control over exterior  communities through synecdoche and mental mapping. The temple’s extended network of  membership and property was physicalized through the allocation—or appropriation—of  specific divine instrumenta to individual places. As Tallay Ornan puts it: The weapon of Assur goes out to battle. The stamped image of the god on a standard goes to  your house. But within the temple, they prefer the anthropomorphic representation of the god.  This implies a hierarchy in the forms of representation. 68 This representational hierarchy papered over the fissures between institutional, commu- nity, and household orders—those not-quite-joined segments of the state—which problema- tized those representational needs in the first place. Gods inhered in their images, emblems,  and names in quite different capacities, but the mimesis of these simulacra suggests an  unbroken identity and a theological omnipresence which may have been understood quite  differently depending on whether one stood before an icon in the temple, inscribed a divine  name on a tablet, or fixed the emblem of the ward before the neighborhood gate. 64. Gell 1998: 20. 65. Gell (1998: 20–21, 116–17) makes an argument for a bidirectionality in objects used as secondary agents:  they were not only instruments of primary agents, but also constituted their identities, becoming indispensible com- ponents of those agents. In this sense, the crowns could be seen as extensions of their gods, yes; but the gods would  not have quite been the gods without their crowns, either. 66.
