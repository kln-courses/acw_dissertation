<plain_text><page sequence="1">BURNS'S COMEDY OF ROMANTIC LOVE BY FREDERICK L. BEATY THE eighteenth-century adaptation of sen- timent to comedy, as well as the Scottish vernacular tradition, afforded Robert Burns ample precedent for his humorous love poetry. He was obviously interested in examining the comic spirit, as random comments in his letters indicate; yet he apparently elaborated no critical manifesto of his own to explain his practice. Per- haps because he was often regarded as an in- spired but untaught genius who succeeded with- out conscious artistry, influential critics of the early nineteenth century usually looked not to him for illustrations of their comic theories but rather to Jean Paul Richter, who had obligingly translated his own precepts into creative ex- amples. Not until after many of the speculations about humor had crystallized into definite con- cepts could Burns's achievement be fully ana- lyzed.' Just as his poetry had unwittingly sanc- tioned in advance many of the tenets enunciated in Wordsworth's preface to Lyrical Ballads (1800), so too his portrayals of comic love antici- pated theories of subsequent analysts and, conse- quently, have become increasingly meaningful in the light of critical doctrines articulated after his practice. As Romantic critics saw it, the dichotomy be- tween humor and wit inherited from the eight- eenth century constituted one of the basic cleavages between neoclassicism and their own aesthetic of natural sensibility. In his introduc- tion to Lectures on the English Comic Writers, Hazlitt made the distinction explicit: "Humour is the describing the ludicrous as it is in itself; wit is the exposing it, by comparing or contrasting it with something else. Humour is, as it were, the growth of nature and accident; wit is the product of art and fancy."2 Thus wit, being contrived, aggressive, and generally derisive, was considered the province of the mind; whereas humor, being natural, emotional, and empathically under- standing, belonged essentially to the heart. Similarly De Quincey, when he attempted to popularize Richter's philosophical theories on the comic, carefully emphasized the distinction between wit as "a purely intellectual thing" and humor as a phenomenon that brought into play "the moral nature" involving the will, affections, disposition, and temperament.3 Humor in Richter's creative works, according to De Quincey, was interwoven with pathos, his gentle satire characterized by smiles rather than by scornful laughter. Subsequently Carlyle, who had assimilated much of the comic psychology in Richter's Vorschule der Aesthetik (1804), demeaned the irony and caricature of neoclassi- cal satirists to a position conspicuously lower than that of humor. "True humour," Carlyle explained in his second essay on Richter, "springs not more from the head than from the heart; it is not contempt, its essence is love; it issues not in laughter, but in still smiles, which lie far deeper."4 Through a kinship with sensibility, therefore, the ultimate justification of humor resembled that for human love: it helped unite man with mankind. Despite objections from purists who pre- ferred their emotions and their genres un- alloyed, the analogy of love and humor was generally endorsed by Romantic critics as a valid precept for life, as well as art. Even the delicate question of whether the heart was capable of sympathetic laughter had an apologist in Lamb, who differentiated between "the petri- fying sneer of a demon which excludes and kills Love" and "the cordial laughter of a man which implies and cherishes it."5 By laughing with rather than at humanity, one might enjoy him- self while heightening his benevolent proclivities. And if humor was produced by what was uni- versally comic, laughter, especially from a man sufficiently perceptive to associate the ludicrous with traits in himself, could prove highly edify- ing. Keats, in the letter that evolves his principle of imaginative identification, selfless sympathy, and suspended judgment known as "negative capability," significantly progressed toward this doctrine from a statement praising the superior- ity of humor over wit.6 As Keats realized, humor enabled an imaginative understanding whereby 1 Stuart M. Tave's The Amiable Humorist (Chicago, 1960), which surveys comic theory of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, clearly demonstrates what meager at- tention Romantic critics paid to Burns's humorous treat- ment of love. 2 "On Wit and Humour" (1818), The Complete Works of William Hazlitt, ed.

Furthermore, the artistic advantages of humor were seen to rest on valid psychological grounds. As both De Quincey and Carlyle pointed out in their respective analyses of Richter, humor prevented sensibility from deteriorating into a lachrymose or maudlin sentimentality. However serious the emotion of love might be, a touch of the comic-what Bergson in his essay Laughter defined as "a momentary anesthesia of the heart"-con- tributed to a healthful perspective. The con- junction of active and passive, far from annihilat- ing one another, restored a sane equilibrium ap- propriate to the Romantic goal of unified sensi- bilities. By its very nature life was seen to be full of inconsistencies, incongruities, paradoxes, and frustrations imposed by mundane limitations. Yet if the dominant principle of life was (like that of its creator) love, then the force striving for unity with the infinite tended to transcend finite limitations. Hence the juxtaposition of finite and infinite, which Richter postulated as the true source of humor, contributed to the desired totality of existence. The soundness of Romantic insight, striving for the union of reason, sentiment, intellectual intuition, and imagination, was later confirmed by professional psychologists. Sigmund Freud, who endorsed many of the Romantic theories on the comic derived from Richter, further demon- strated that joking, however pleasurable, was also a serious matter. He analyzed humor in the following manner, according to the circum- stances of its origin: The forms in which humour is manifested are, more- over, determined by two peculiarities which are con- nected with the conditions under which it is generated. Humour may, in the first place, appear merged with a joke or some other species of the comic; in that case its task is to get rid of a possibility implicit in the situation that an affect may be generated which would interfere with the pleasurable outcome. In the second place, it may stop this generating of an affect entirely or only partially; this last is actually the commoner case since it is easier to bring about, and it produces the various forms of "broken" humour-the humour that smiles through tears.7 Subsequent psychologists have likewise ex- plained the compatibility of love and humor in their own terms without seriously disrupting Romantic concepts. While love is customarily associated now with the integrative or self- transcending tendency and the comic spirit with the self-assertive, human emotions are usually mixed. Love, in all except its hypothetically pure instances, is sufficiently ambivalent to include some of the self-assertive. Sexual love, particularly from the masculine point of view, contains enough of the aggressive to invite forms of the comic that are indeed far less sympathetic than humor. Nor does laughter provoked by such instances undermine the essential serious- ness, for the emotions meet on common ground. Yet exactly how much of prevalent theory on comic love Burns was consciously aware of is difficult to ascertain. It seems likely, however, that he may have been acquainted with one of the longest treatises on the comic spirit, that by the Scottish philosopher-poet James Beattie, whose poems and essays Burns greatly ad- mired.8 Continuing the traditions first popu- larized by Addison and Steele (and later by Sterne), Beattie, in his "Essay on Laughter and Ludicrous Composition" (1776), claimed that laughter arising from innocent mirth was not only therapeutically desirable but also indica- tive of a benevolent, rather than a spiteful, na- ture. Moreover, he predicted a kind of literature of which Burns was to become the chief poetical exponent. "As romantic love in its natural regular procedure is now become so copious a source of joy and sorrow, hope and fear, triumph and disappointment," Beattie asserted, "we might reasonably conclude, that in its more whimsical forms and vagaries it could scarce fail to supply materials for laughter."9 His views on the vis comica were essentially standard, even though his terminology differed somewhat from that of other aestheticians and his specific defi- nitions perhaps did not indicate rigid classifica- tion.10 Wit he described as the "unexpected discovery of resemblance between ideas supposed dissimilar"-a kind of discordia concors such as Dr. Johnson saw in metaphysical analogies. Humor Beattie identified with the "comic exhibition of singular characters, sentiments, and imagery." Yet he certainly divided the comic spirit into two categories according to the 7Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious (1905), The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, tr. and ed. James Strachey (London, 1953- 64), vm, 232. 8 In addition to several references to Beattie's poems, he alludes to Beattie's "Essay on Truth" in "The Vision" (Duan II, st. vii). Burns approved of George Thomson's plan to have Beattie write an introductory essay on Scottish music, presumably because of what the latter had already written about it in his "Essay on Poetry and Music" (The Letters of Robert Burns, ed. J. DeLancey Ferguson, Oxford, 1931, In, 148). Since the "Essay on Laughter" was often printed with Beattie's other essays, Burns probably knew it. 9 Essays (London, 1779), p. 438. 10 Essays, pp. 301-305, 380-383. 430</page><page sequence="3">Frederick L. Beaty responses it evoked: the ridiculous arousing contempt or disapproval, and the ludicrous pro- ducing a simple, undefinable, risible emotion. This latter reaction was brought about by the pleasant awareness of inconsistencies-often in an unusual mixture of similarity and contrariety. As the "Essay" further analyzed it, innocent laughter could be purely "animal" if occasioned by tickling or sudden gladness and "sentimental" when it proceeded from feeling or sentiment. Since theories such as these were already formu- lated, Burns, who was especially sensitive to the incongruities of certain character traits in par- ticular situations, had only to put the sentimental comic into practice. Before fully understanding Burns's treatment of "romantic love," however, one must recog- nize that to him sexual attraction was the most natural and inspiring justification for existence. Complete gratification in love became virtually synonymous with the pursuit of happiness; and from this basic premise, which colored all he had to say about love, stemmed the related attitudes expressed throughout his poetry. Associated from the beginning with poetic inspiration, this "delicious Passion," as he explained to Dr. John Moore, was held "to be the first of human joys, our dearest pleasure here below."" His most celebrated affirmation of loyalty to the eternal feminine, "Green Grow the Rashes, O," divides humanity into those with hearts and those without.'2 Though the "war'ly race" may seek and often find riches, Burns declares that true enjoyment, a fulfillment of the heart, will never be theirs. As spokesman for the other race, he vows his preference for the simple, unassuming joys of making love, one of the few inalienable rights of the poor. In an uncertain, anxiety- filled world the lasses alone make life bearable and meaningful. Nor does the poet assume that a man's love ought to be confined to one girl. In opposition to grave Calvinistic strictures con- demning earthly joys, he cites scriptural (and therefore irrefutable) authority that Solomon, traditionally the wisest of men and devotee of infinite variety, "dearly lov'd the lasses." Carry- ing matters a step further in the poems he con- tributed to The Merry Muses of Caledonia, Burns is often very explicit, sometimes by means of clever metaphors, about the unsurpassed plea- sures women afford sexually. Obversely, he char- acterizes the loss of physical love as tantamount to death in life. A good example occurs in lines from "Epistle to James Smith" (I, 59-67), which express fears that the worst blight of senility will be deprivation of that greatest joy--"dear, deluding Woman." The same poem also affirms the basic cleavage between those men, including Burns, who can appreciate the pleasures of a full life and that other segment-the "douce folk that live by rule"-whose stagnant lives lack affection, sentiment, and happiness even in their prime. Similarly, the poem "To Major Logan" (ni, 99-103) distinguishes between the "purse- proud race" obsessed with respectability and those who respond to the gadflies of feeling. Declaring his lot with the latter, Burns defies priests who condemn women for the fall of man- kind, adding sincerely: "I like them dearly... / God bless them a'l" Quite logically, a belief so devoutly affirmed had to be translated into practice, and many of Burns's poems celebrate the following of natural inclination-a precept he advocated most con- vincingly from the masculine viewpoint. Despite some admissions, as in the "Epistle to a Young Friend" (I, 140-144), that illicit affection hard- ened the heart and petrified the feelings, he usu- ally assumed that the most ardent flames of love ought to be kindled immediately because they were too often of short duration. Hence he ad- vised his brother William: ". . . try for intimacy as soon as you feel the first symptoms of the passion."'3 Somewhat like his bard in "The Jolly Beggars" (ii, 15-16), Burns usually regarded it a mortal sin to thwart a divinely implanted in- stinct. Being a man entailed fulfilling the obliga- tions of manhood, and whoever shirked them was not entitled to the name. In an attempt to refine a coarse original of his song "The Tailor" (iii, 179), Burns implies this argument as ex- planation for the central character's behavior. Whereas in the earlier version the tailor sadis, tically had taken advantage of a sleeping maiden, in Burns's humorous redaction he attains his goal because he is charming and ingratiating. (This alteration itself indicates how the poet frequently softened the harsh original without radically changing its import.) The profession of Burns's tailor provides him with nothing more than an entree; his real vocation is that of a lover who "kend the way to woo." In one choice line the poet laconically sums up all that is indelicate in the earlier account, adds what is needed to con- clude the anecdote, and comments on the action: "The Tailor prov'd a man, O!"

A man obviously disturbed by his recent excursion into adultery tries to allay his conscience by repeated questioning whether he ought to be blamed for his actions. Part of the humor no doubt stems from the transposition of the customary roles in love-of an aggressive Lady Booby plotting the seduction of a relatively passive Joseph Andrews. But the crowning achievement in the lyric is the speaker's unwit- ting revelation of his own naivete and his unwill- ingness to admit that the married woman had ac- tually manipulated him. Knowing that he would not wish his valor impugned, she had shrewdly called him "a coward loon" for his reluctance to enter her house. Then perceiving his vanity and susceptibility to pity, she complained of how cruelly her absent husband treated her and thereby threw all the blame for her own actions upon a tyrannical spouse. What indeed could a sympathetic young man do but comfort and con- sole her? In retrospect he protests: Could I for shame refus'd her? And wadna manhood been to blame Had I unkindly used her? (III, 150) After performing his duty, he reveals some un- certainty about true manly behavior by recount- ing that on the following morning he tried to drown his compunction in brandy, though he con- tinues to solicit our comforting assurance that he was not the one to blame. A somewhat different aspect of the problem is reflected in many of Burns's autobiographical poems that poignantly describe the suffering inflicted by conventional morality on natural deeds of love. The concept of vice as a virtue carried to excess was difficult for him to com- prehend when the virtue was love and when others of his acquaintance seemingly enjoyed the pleasures without concomitant pains. Neverthe- less, his overall attitude was remarkably consis- tent in that he not only fulfilled his obligations of manhood but also assumed all the parental re- sponsibilities that his encompassing affections and limited financial means could provide. The pathos tinged with humor in poems concerning his own difficulties with unplanned parenthood no doubt reveals his mixed reactions. Probably the best illustration occurs in "A Poet's Welcome to His Love-Begotten Daughter" (II, 37-39), which expresses his great delight upon first be- coming an illegitimate father. Assuring his child by Elizabeth Paton that she is just as welcome as though she had been invited, he addresses her as Sweet fruit o' monie a merry dint, My funny toil is no a' tint: Tho' thou cam to the warl' asklent, Which fools may scoff at, In my last plack thy part's be in't The better half o't. (II, 38) Not even the pains attendant on illegitimacy could diminish the swaggering bravado he as- sumes in a few of his poems celebrating propaga- tion of bastards. One reason for such boasting on his part was undoubtedly the private masculine audience to whom such poems were initially addressed. Furthermore, his defiance of ec- clesiastical authorities, who in some cases had been no better than he, for the penance and fine they imposed upon him could best be expressed with mocking raillery. Though in "A Poet's Welcome to His Love-Begotten Daughter" he merely disclaims any objection to being called "fornicator," he boldly asserts his right to that distinction in "The Fornicator" of The Merry Muses.'4 That Burns sincerely believed he had been made to suffer excessively is clear from his repeated comparison of himself to Biblical "men of God," who achieved ultimate salvation despite rather cavalier attitudes toward the seventh commandment. King David and King Solomon, both famous as poets and adulterers, provided him with choice illustrations of sexual energy as the true manifestation of vitality. In "Reply to a Trimming Epistle Received from a Tailor" (in, 96-99), a devil-may-care poem regarding Burns's own ill repute, the poet argues that even though he may give women's "wames a random pouse," the manly sport of fornication should not call down great abuse from men who admire King David as one of the "lang-syne saunts." Burns then concludes with a fanciful tale, the true index of his indignation, about how he made fools of the Kirk Session that assessed punishment for his transgression. According to this account, the defendant candidly admitted he would never be any better unless he were gelded; and the minis- ter, perhaps on the analogy that an offending eye ought to be plucked out, immediately endorsed amputation of whatever proved to be his "sp'ritual foe." But instead Burns facetiously recommended putting the offending part under the guidance of the lass-a suggestion that pleased the Session "warst of a'" and ended the interview. The autobiographical poem that even the most devoted followers of Burns sometimes find diffi- cult to justify is the "Epistle to John Rankine" 14 See the edition of James Barke, Sydney Goodsir Smith, and J. DeLancey Ferguson (New York, 1964), pp. 69-70. 432</page><page sequence="5">Frederick L. Beaty (i, 176-179), with its elaborate metaphor of game-poaching. First must be remembered, how- ever, the character of the individual for whose enjoyment it was originally intended. The open- ing lines of the "Epistle" characterize its recipi- ent as "rough, rude, ready-witted Rankine," a man apparently well known for his rowdy fes- tivities, stories, sprees, and exposes of hypocrit- ical clergymen. Hence the principal anecdote was especially appropriate. Then too, the tradi- tion of witty comparisons was so well established in Scottish vernacular poetry that Burns's anal- ogy of poaching and promiscuous lovemaking would not have appeared so derogatory to the woman as it may seem today. As Burns put it, 'Twas ae night lately, in my fun, I gaed a rovin wi' the gun, An' brought a paitrick to the grun'- A bonie hen; And, as the twilight was begun, Thought nane wad ken. (I, 178) Indeed many of Burns's poems employ meta- phors, such as ploughing, threshing, playing the fiddle, filling the bowl, and shooting wild birds, that were common in the Scottish tradition long before he used them. In "The Bonie Moor-Hen" (Iv, 20-21), to cite another example, he tells of a fair game bird that had long eluded hunters until she was finally taken by a young man with a brass firelock that dazzled her eyes. Thus in the poem addressed to Rankine the implied com- parison of his affair with Elizabeth Paton, the servant girl who bore his first child, to shooting down a partridge that did not rightfully belong to him and consequently having to pay a guinea's fine in the Poacher-Court (Kirk Session) ought to be regarded as a clever and natural treatment of the subject. If it reveals a sportive flippancy to- ward the begetting of bastards, it is nevertheless distinct from mere locker-room braggadocio. By connecting two of the most primitive survival drives in man-hunting for food and gratifying the sexual impulse-it atavistically reveals a basic masculine desire to make a sportive plea- sure of necessity. Nevertheless, Burns's depiction of young girls who have unwisely yielded to the rapture of love shows highly sympathetic insight, sometimes mixed with restrained masculine humor, into their various plights. Portraying them without reproach, ridicule, or sentimentality, he accepts their condition as an unfortunate though natural consequence of love. The "sleepy bit lassie" in "The Tailor Fell Thro' the Bed" (III, 44) naively thought the tailor could do her no harm, and in- deed he gave her such satisfaction that now she longs for his return. Slightly graver complications have ensued for the girl in "Jumpin John" (III, 14-15). Despite her parents' warning, she yielded only to discover her folly; yet the second stanza implies that because of her excellent dowry and "bonie black e'e" the lad who beguiled her may yet decide to marry her. Less bright are the hopes of the girl in "To the Weaver's Gin Ye Go" (III, 3-5), who laments the loss of her happiness for granting more than her heart to a weaver lad. Though reluctant to tell what occurred, she now fears that information will soon become increas- ingly obvious to everyone. In a similar plight is the unfortunate lass in "Robin Shure in Hairst" (III, 194-195), who has discovered how false her Robin's promises were-he has not provided for her even during pregnancy. But the subtlest and perhaps most appealing characterization of such a girl appears in the first set of lyrics entitled "Duncan Gray" (II, 23-24). Whereas her friends can still enjoy themselves, she now has the cares of unintentional motherhood, which she with half-hearted jocularity blames on the bad girth- ing. While she and Duncan were riding a horse on Lammas night, she recalls, the girthing broke, and one fall followed another. Now she wistfully hopes that Duncan will keep his oath so that all (including the bad girthing) may be rectified. Also from the feminine point of view, "The Rantin Dog, the Daddie o't" (ii, 70) expresses the anxieties of an unwed, expectant mother who seeks assurance that Rob, the rollicking father of her child, will assume his paternal obligations. Quite understandably she finds it difficult to joke about her very serious plight, and adding to the embarrassment is her realization that she has taken in earnest what had only been poked in fun. Burns's songs about courtship are also rich in portraits of charming young girls who, tempering good humor with common sense, know what they want and cleverly overcome obstacles to their goals. An outstanding example is the lass in "O, Whistle an' I'll Come to Ye, My Lad" (IIm, 5-6). Since there seems to be parental objection to her lover, she gives him explicit instructions on how to reach her without letting anyone else know. And though she wants him to ignore her publicly, she nevertheless insists that he is not to court an- other, even in jest, for fear he may accidentally be enticed away. In "Last May a Braw Wooer" (iII, 242-243) a girl not so completely in control of the situation pretends to be virtually inacces- sible and, to her dismay, almost loses the young man to a rival. With cunning, however, she pro- 433</page><page sequence="6">Burns's Comedy of Romantic Love ceeds to win him back and reveals her dissem- bling nature even in her public reasons for marry- ing him-not for her own sake but, ironically, just "to preserve the poor body in life." Another song, "0, for Ane-and-Twenty, Tam" (iii, 111- 112), expresses the view of a minor heiress who has decided on her husband but is obliged tem- porarily to wait. Her inheritance seems to depend upon her family's consent to the marriage; yet she is determined to have both Tam, whom they do not endorse, and the inheritance if he will just wait three years until she comes of age. Espe- cially winsome is the maiden in "I'm O'er Young to Marry Yet" (IIm, 6-7), who pleads with her suitor that at her tender age and as her mother's only child she is psychologically unprepared for marriage. But unwilling to reject his proposal completely, she suggests that should he come again next summer she will be older and perhaps ready to reconsider. Timidity in men, on the other hand, is a topic rarely mentioned by Burns. Significantly, in his gallery of lovers the traditionally humorous bashful young men are almost nonexistent. He did, however, compose to the tune of "The Bashful Lover" lyrics entitled "On a Bank of Flowers" (mI, 49-50), portraying a lad who is shy only at first. Having chanced upon lightly clad Nelly asleep among summer flowers, Willie begins by merely gazing, wishing, then fearing, and blushing. When Nelly awakes and sees him, she flees in terror; yet Willie, presumably having overcome his initial hesitancy, overtakes her in the woods. The most despicable variety of courtship in Burns's view was that which hypocritically aimed at marriage for money, and he was par- ticularly scornful of men offering themselves as marketable commodities. "There's a Youth in This City" (mr, 61-62) pokes fun at a handsome, elegantly attired young man in search of a wealthy girl to marry. Several prospects with commendable fortunes are eager to have him, but actually he loves none of them so much as him- self. A thoroughly cynical attitude toward the transience of feminine beauty is satirized in the song "A Lass wi' a Tocher" (mII, 229-230), in which a man extols woman's wealth as her only enduring attraction. Without denying the witch- craft of youthful beauty, he brazenly expresses his preference for a lass with "acres o' charms." The girl in "My Tocher's the Jewel" (IIT, 90) sees through the pretended love of just such a man. Though he has praised her beauty and her family, she shrewdly understands that her greatest ap- peal for him is her dowry and therefore bids him try his fortune elsewhere. Of course, shallow- hearted girls may also prefer silver to love. Meg o' the Mill, in the second set of lyrics by that title (iv, 38-39), foolishly jilts a desirable miller for a repulsive but rich laird. In all these in- stances, as in Burns's poems of social protest, wealth is seen to be a corrupting influence. Comedy of a more playful sort is produced by refining the natural instinct of courtship into sophisticated skill-such as the fine art of seduc- tion. In "Extempore to Gavin Hamilton" (iI, 93-95), a poem that strips the ornamental tinsel from many seemingly important matters and shows them for what they are-"naething"-Burns relates how he applied the same technique to a female Whig. Her initial refusal to have faith in a poet, as well as his exalted reference to "Her Whigship," arouses our antipathy toward a pre- tentious woman who deserves to be not only cor- rected but leveled. The poet's adroitness in the game of "love for love's sake" is so great that, despite her inevitable objections while they "grew lovingly big," he taught her "her terrors were--naething." Burns concludes: Her Whigship was wonderful pleased, But charmingly tickled wi' ae thing; Her fingers I lovingly squeezed, And kissed her, and promised her-naething. (II, 95) Whatever the consequences, seduction might be regarded as a challenging sport in which each of the two individuals, while abiding by the rules of the game, fulfills his prescribed part. By transposing the customary roles of male and female, as Thurber has often done in our day, Burns provided another rich source of the comic, well exemplified in "Wha Is That at My Bower Door" (Im, 102-103). In the original song the woman is blatantly aggressive whereas the man is meekly compliant. In Burns's version, the wom- an, though less conniving, is still manipulator of the action and puts up only token resistance to letting her lover, Findlay, in. He, on the other hand, understands his obligations: he must argue until she deludes herself into thinking that, against her better judgment, his rhetoric has overwhelmed her. These pretenses are clear from the dialogue; the girl introduces in conditional clauses exactly what she ought to fear while Findlay counters with his assurance that each condition will be fulfilled. When he promises to abide by her last stipulation-never to tell what may transpire in her bower-there is no longer any need for him to remain outside. By super- ficially maintaining her pretenses, however, the 434</page><page sequence="7">Frederick L. Beaty girl preserves her self-respect-at least in her own opinion. Burns was also interested in burlesquing artificial conventions of courtship in his second set of lyrics entitled "Duncan Gray" (in, 215- 216). When he sent the words of this song to George Thomson, he observed that the melody "precludes sentiment" and that "the ludicrous is its ruling feature."15 Both Meg, with the proud disdain of a courtly lady, and Duncan, with his lachrymose despair verging on suicide, so over- play their roles that they achieve the comedy of exaggeration. Excessive sentimentality in Dun- can, however, produces its own reaction, for he banishes affectation by realizing the absurdity of dying for "a haughty hizzie." As he recovers his health, Meg, discovering how much his love had meant to her, grows ill pining for him. The fact that Duncan is "a lad o' grace," as well as a shrewd psychologist trained in Scottish com- mon sense philosophy, permits all to turn out well. Pitying Meg, who suffers as he himself once languished, he demonstrates his true worth by magnanimously refusing to cause her death. The guarded manner in which he accepts her indicates he has learned a very practical lesson in amatory psychology: nothing is quite so attractive as casual indifference. In other instances Burns used the playful treatment of love to shatter some of mankind's treasured illusions. "I Murder Hate by Field or Flood" (ii, 250) mocks exalted, unrealistic no- tions of heroic death for noble causes. Instead of endorsing the usual demands of military heroism, whereby a soldier kills his fellow man, the poet would much rather spend his blood in "Life- giving wars of Venus," rather "make one more / Than be the death of twenty." Somewhat more seriously, he maintains the same idea in a poem entitled "Nature's Law" (II, 47-49): Let other heroes boast their scars, The marks o' sturt and strife, But other poets sing of wars, The plagues o' human life! Shame fa' the fun: wi' sword and gun To slap mankind like lumber! I sing his name and nobler fame Wha multiplies our number. (ii, 47) Perhaps because of its limited range of possi- bilities, Burns rarely approached the comical aspects of married love with the geniality and compassion required of true humor. In writing of domestic situations, he easily turned from humor to satire, and it should not be surprising that the preponderance of marriage poems are, by their very nature, sharp, succinct, and often epigram- matic. This antipathy toward the marital state, revealed with varying degrees of aggressiveness in the majority of his poems treating comic love, is exactly what one should expect. According to Freud's analysis, no institution in our society has been more carefully guarded by accepted moral- ity or more vulnerable to attack than the con- nubial relationship.16 The prevalence of cynical jokes deriding wedlock as bedlock illustrates the unconscious antagonism which men in particular feel toward rigid suppression of sexual liberty. Since this hostility can be temporarily freed from the unconscious by means of some clever witti- cism-a "pleasure premium," that enables us to laugh at what we revere-tendentious wit aimed at marriage momentarily overcomes whatever inhibitive power exists and permits us to enjoy a release of aggression, often quite contrary to what our sober thoughts might recommend. Burns's practice would indeed tend to support Freud's theory. Regarding marriage as a mixed blessing, he was not able, as he admits in "Yes- treen I Had a Pint o' Wine" (iv, 25-26), to resign himself wholeheartedly to its restraints. Yet his ability to identify imaginatively with either op- ponent in marital warfare not only relieved him of acerbity but permitted him, usually with the verbal economy of an excellent raconteur, to turn even the worst situation into a good joke. One group of his poems about marriage em- phasizes the change which a husband feels has occurred in his wife since their wedding. Stanza vi of "Extempore to Gavin Hamilton" (II, 94) cogently points out how during courtship the lover sparkles and glows when "Approaching his bonie bit gay thing," but after the irrevocable ceremony he learns he has acquired a dressed-up "naething." Sometimes a disenchanted husband, as in "The Weary Pund o' Tow" (III, 108-109), becomes so embittered with a lazy, tippling wife that, after her death, he vows to hang himself rather than marry again. The unfortunate man in "O, Ay My Wife She Dang Me" (iii, 191) may have suffered even more; yet there is something admirably winning about his resignation to fate. Though the peace and rest he anticipated in marriage were never realized, at least he has the consolation of knowing that, after suffering "pains o' hell" on earth, he is assured of bliss above. The husband in the justly admired "Whistle o'er the Lave o't" (III, 58) has also had his hopes shattered, but through an amazing humor born of suffering he seems to be chuckling 5 Letters, In, 135. le Jokes, p. 110. 435</page><page sequence="8">Burns's Comedy of Romantic Love while cataloguing his woes. All that he had associated with Maggie before the wedding has now changed to its antithesis, and but for fear Maggie would find out, he would even name the one he wishes were in her grave. Implying far more than he expresses, he refrains from elab- orating on each unpleasantness and turns it into jest by whistling about what cannot be altered. No doubt the evasive and suggestive quality that makes him a fascinating conversationalist also renders him a most exasperating husband to a shrew. All these cited poems, as well as others, demonstrate how painfully husbands learn that married love is subject to mutability. A considerable number of marriage poems are concerned primarily with exposing and ridiculing an intolerable wife. In so doing, they also reveal the curious relationship between the shortcom- ings of one spouse and the weaknesses of the other. For example, in "The Tyrant Wife" (II, 248, 438), which was published also under the title of "The Henpecked Husband," Burns ex- presses the belief that a shrew is partially the fault of a spineless, fearful husband who deserves reproach rather than pity. The anomalous situa- tion would never occur if the husband of such a woman wisely subdued her by breaking either her spirit or her heart. The efficacy of such action is demonstrated in "She Play'd the Loon or She Was Married,"'7 in which the man expresses doubt concerning his wanton wife's ability to be- have unless she is controlled as a child ought to be ruled-namely, by the rod. Perhaps the only suffering husband who genuinely elicits our pity, however, is the one in "Kellyburn Braes" (iII, 129-132). There the unfortunate man yields his termagant wife to the devil, who in turn dis- covers her to be more than a match for him and his demons. Upon returning the shrew to her husband, the devil admits that he had never been truly in hell until he acquired a wife. Among several poems that disparage the hus- band without particularly ennobling the wife, some make light of the essentially serious afflic- tion of impotence in advanced age. The young woman in "What Can a Young Lassie" (iII, 93- 94) temporarily evokes our sympathy with com- plaints about her peevish, jealous old husband until she reveals her plan to torment him to death and then use his "auld brass" to buy her- self a "new pan." The subject receives an almost poignant treatment in "The Deuk's Dang o'er My Daddie" (III, 139-140), where acrid hostility between the lusty wife and her incapable spouse is mixed with remembrance of happier bygone days and nights. Two of Burns's songs deal with an equally old marital jest, cuckoldry, but they do so in a manner characteristic of his humor. The women of "0, An Ye Were Dead, Guidman" (Iii, 146-147) and "The Cooper o' Cuddy" (III, 157-158) are openly and defiantly committing adultery with their lovers while their husbands do nothing but resign themselves to their proverbial horns. Though some compassion is naturally directed toward the poor, helpless cuckolds, the comic pleasure derived from these two lyrics stems less from a debasement of the husbands than from our fascination with the brazen, res- olute determination of the hussies to satisfy their desires. Burns could hardly write of love without relat- ing it humorously to another of his chief delights, John Barleycorn, which he recognized as a true, though unscrupulous, liberator of man's psychic energy. In some instances alcohol could demean its imbiber to such a ludicrous state that he be- came excellent material for mordantly satirical, aggressive comedy. Especially when associated with Calvinistic moral attitudes, as in "Holy Willie's Prayer" (II, 25-30), tippling served to accentuate what Burns considered the irreconcil- ability of canon law with man's instinctive na- ture. Willie's anthropomorphic concept of God- capriciously unjust, vindictive, and incapable of love-reveals the speaker himself. Since his sexual drive is wholly identified with proscribed pleasure, what Burns would have called human love can never be anything but lust in Willie Fisher, who ironically justifies his own promis- cuity by pleading drunkenness. Also in "The Holy Fair" (I, 36-47) a perversion of what ought to be the celebration of divine love in a com- munion service is allied with alcohol and lechery. Superstition and hypocrisy in the preaching tent combined with careless fun in an adjacent tavern justify the poet's attack on the Scottish Kirk-a corruption of faith that ideally should be char- acterized by good deeds, sincerity, and love. Hence he comments ironically on the man who, by letting his hand wander over the bosom of his lass during a sermon, makes a mockery of both religion and human love. And as the scene moves to the tavern, he portrays a predominant mood of lechery whereby liquor alters Venus Uranus into a lusty pandemic lass. Thus what began with a hardhearted religion leads, through the stimulation of drink, to a parody of love- "houghmagandie." With less satire and far greater humor, Burns 17 The Songs of Robert Burns, ed. James C. Dick (Hatboro, Pa., 1962), p. 196. 436</page><page sequence="9">Frederick L. Beaty treats the bibulous freeing of emotion more sym- pathetically in "Tam o' Shanter" (I, 278-287). Just as good Scotch drink presumably released Burns's thoughts and feelings for poetical com- position, so too it heightens Tam's amiability toward both Souter Johnie and the landlady, causing him to postpone his return to a hostile, sullen wife. Unfortunately it later contributes to his admiration for an attractive witch dancing lustily in a sark so short that it barely covers, and as a result Tam is momentarily deprived of ra- tional control. Quite unconsciously he roars out the ingenuous praise that almost undoes him. With mock-serious didacticism, Burns in the conclusion warns that the path leading from alcohol to lecherous contemplation often cul- minates in disaster. The negative moral lesson is, of course, a variant of the admonition in a classic naughty story pertinent to mice and ardent men. Because Tam loses his head to drink and a "cutty sark," his mare is bereft of her tail. An entirely different attitude toward the com- bination of love and alcohol is found in "The Jolly Beggars" (II, 1-19, 307), which in some manuscripts bore the title "Love and Liberty." The beggars, who have a simple, intuitively acute perception of man's nature, possess no inhibi- tions whatever and accept the basic instincts without any concern for what is ordinarily called ethical standards. What might in polite society be condemned as obscene is from their point of view perfectly normal. Indeed the comedy of this cantata, which is universally considered Burns's masterpiece, verges on what Freud analyzed as the naively comical-the effect often produced in adult listeners by the spontaneous, forthright comments of children.l8 The poet's sympathy with (and at times even undisguised envy of) a segment of humanity usually thought beneath contempt is just as sincere as the beggars' child- like, irrepressible, and irresistibly appealing can- dor. Had these uninhibited outcasts been deliber- ately attacking institutions of the society which they rejected, then some of their satirical jibes might be considered tendentious wit: the reader would have to assume that through enticement of comic pleasure they were trying to elicit his hostility against principles which he had been conditioned to respect unquestioningly, despite an unconscious dislike.19 And there are indeed occasional touches of such wit in their oblique comments on marriage, respectability, legality, and religion, particularly in the Merry Andrew's song and the final chorus: A fig for those by law protected! Liberty's a glorious feast, Courts for cowards were erected, Churches built to please the priestl (II, 18-19) Yet these bits of aggression are casually tossed off at inhabitants of a world having little contact with theirs. The supremely winning quality of the beggars is their belief in both love and liberty not in the negative sense of revolt against restraint but rather as positive virtues. The old soldier and his doxy, both of whom enjoy their present in- dulgence in love and drink rather than the ex- ploits of their former military careers; the pro- fessional Merry Andrew who, unlike the hypo- critical fool, calls himself what he is; the female pickpocket whose Highland lover died on the gallows for defiance of Lowland laws; the small fiddler who proposes cohabitation with the pick- pocket but has only brief enjoyment of her; the bold tinker who offers himself to the same "un- blushing fair"; the bard who, resigning himself to the loss of one mistress because he has two others left, sings in praise of free love and freely flowing drink-all reveal in an unsophisticated way their refusal to be duped by the sham, hypocritical cant of society. There is something wonderfully refreshing, as Burns himself acknowledged in his commonplace book, about associating with such people.20 Though their actual deeds may be no better than those of many ostensibly respectable friends, the beggars' mental attitude is more appealing be- cause of its honesty, sincerity, and total lack of pretension. They spontaneously express by both precept and example what all of us know intu- itively but have been taught to renounce. The occasional intrusion of artificial diction on their unaffected vernacular, to which many critics have objected, subtly reminds us of conventional society's futile attempt to overlay and encroach upon their natures; yet the beggars remain es- sentially loyal to all that is natural in humanity. They have indeed achieved the "happy state" described in one of Burns's favorite quotations: "... when souls each other draw, / When love is liberty, and nature law" (Pope's "Eloisa to Abelard," 11. 91-92).21 Especially when we com- pare the beggars' adherence to their own code of behavior with the contrasting failure of society to abide by its ethical standards, we realize the supreme humor with which the poet conceived his work. 18 Jokes, pp. 182-188. 19 Jokes, pp. 90-119. 20 Robert Burns's Commonplace Book 1783-1785, ed.

Yet among the most objec- tively perceptive, his extraordinary ability to fuse the seemingly heterogeneous elements of love and comedy by means of uniquely incisive humor did not go wholly unnoticed. Lamb, who was quick to recognize in Burns some qualities he himself possessed, observed "a jocular pathos, which makes one feel in laughter."22 After read- ing a collection of Burns's unpublished letters, Byron remarked: "What an antithetical mind!- tenderness, roughness-delicacy, coarseness- sentiment, sensuality-soaring and grovelling, dirt and deity-all mixed up in that one com pound of inspired clay!"23 Carlyle, equally aware of these paradoxes, especially stressed "the ten- derness, the playful pathos" and shrewdly per- ceived that the principle of love which charac- terized Burns's poetry "occasionally manifests itself in the shape of Humour."24 Aside from the drollery associated with caricature, Carlyle claimed for Burns "in his sunny moods, a full buoyant flood of mirth" related to his ability to be a "brother and often playmate to all Nature." To emphasize this extraordinary ability Carlyle especially cited those poems expressing a fellow feeling with animals, presumably because mice, mares, and sheep would seem the most difficult creatures with whom a love poet could imagina- tively identify himself. And while some genteel critics regarded his subject matter as crudely un- poetical, Matthew Arnold thought Burns had provided a genuine criticism of life, ironic though it was.25 Despite a revulsion from "Scotch drink, Scotch religion, and Scotch manners," Arnold stressed the "overwhelming sense of the pathos of things" and singled out for illustration of par- ticular merit those works treating love humor- ously. If such poems lacked the requisite high seriousness that excluded their author from the Victorian Valhalla of poetical heroism, it was because Burns (like Chaucer, with whom Arnold repeatedly compared him) believed that many serious observations on life could be uttered more effectively in jest than in grave solemnity.
