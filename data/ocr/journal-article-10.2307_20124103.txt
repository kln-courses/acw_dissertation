BUTTS Almost alone amongst his nineteenth-century British contemporaries, Whewell maintained that genuine science develops in the direction of be coming a comprehensive system of laws that are both universal and neces sary. The examination of Whewell's view of necessity in science begins with an analysis of his claims that necessity is not derivable from expe rience, that necessary propositions are such that their negations are not only false, but impossible, and that necessity is known by means of intui tion. Whewell's theory of necessity is illustrated by a detailed analysis of his philosophy of classical mechanics. Finally, an attempt is made to show that Whewell tried to justify the forms of scientific thought that he regarded as necessary. Recent commentators have held either that Whewell made no attempt at justification (Ducasse), or that his philosophy of science was conventionalistic (Walsh). I try to show on the basis of Philosophy of Dis covery and Whewell's printer's copy of Of the Plurality of Worlds that Whewell introduced a theological justification of necessity in science, arguing that the forms by means of which we know are also forms used by God to structure the creation. Recent Work in Aesthetics, JOSEPH MARGOLIS A comprehensive survey is provided of recent contributions to the Anglo-American literature in aesthetics appearing chiefly, though not ex clusively, in the journals. Attention is directed to problems of criticism, including the description, interpretation, appreciation, and evaluation of works of art; also, to the literary arts, particularly to fiction and metaphor; also, to specialized controversies regarding the artist's intention, the defini tion of a work of art, aesthetic experience, and perception. A bibliography is appended. The Problem of Theoretical Terms, PETER ACHINSTEIN Various philosophers have considered it important to distinguish two sorts of terms employed by scientists: theoretical and non-theoretical. * Abstracts of articles from leading philosophical journals are published as a regular feature of the Review. We want to thank the editors of the journals represented for their cooperation and the authors of the articles for their willing ness to submit abstracts. Where abstracts have not been submitted, the name and author of the article are listed.</page><page sequence="2">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 169 Some base the distinction on a concept of "observability," others upon a notion of "conceptual organization" or "theory-dependence." My purpose is to examine these criteria and to argue that neither they, nor various related ones, generate the desired distinction. Rather each is capable of generating many different distinctions resulting in markedly different clas sifications of terms. This by no means precludes questions concerning the manner in which terms employed by scientists are tied to observation and to theories. Such questions, however, should not be raised upon observation or theories in general, but about particular kinds of observations and about terms in specific theories. If categories are invoked to mark similarities that do exist they will need to be a good deal more specific than the theoretical and "non-theoretical" classifications too often presupposed by philosophers of science. Family Resemblances and Generalization Concerning the Arts, MAURICE MANDELBAUM Wittgenstein's doctrine of family resemblances, and his application of it to the notion of a game, is critically examined. The author then attempts to show the inconclusiveness of several well-known articles which reject the possibility of forming adequate generalizations concerning the nature of art. The articles criticized are by Weitz, Ziff, Kennick, and Kristeller, as well as some contained in Elton: Aesthetics and Language. Unfalsifiability and the Uses of Religious Language, ALASTAIR McKINNON This paper attempts to answer the charge that religious claims are unfalsifiable by an examination of certain contexts and uses of typical religious utterances. Working with a model from science, it distinguishes the assertional, the self-instructional, and the ontological-linguistic uses and offers a detailed analysis of each. It shows that the first is in principle always falsifiable but that, since, so used, it is really a blank for a variety of possible assertions, the utterance itself is never finally falsifiable. It shows that the falsifiability demand is inappropriate to the second use and hence to the utterance so far as this is a constituent element. Finally, it argues that the third use is an unfalsifiable but significant factual claim and that, so far from being a defect, this is an essential feature of this use and a condi tion of the job for which it is actually intended. Family Resemblance Predicates, KEITH CAMPBELL Wittgenstein made the suggestion in the Philosophical Investigations that many predicates apply to objects in virtue of criss crossing and over lapping resemblances between them. This paper attempts to develop that suggestion into a more systematic and precise account of what it is to be a family resemblance predicate, by what method such predicates may be detected and distinguished from other types, and in what way the distinc tion is important for logic. It is argued that making the distinction must be understood as part?and part only?of an attack on the traditional prob lem of justifying the use of general terms, that family resemblance pred</page><page sequence="3">170 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS icates are essentially dependent on predicates of a more fundamental kind, and that hence not all predicates can be of the family resemblance type. It is argued further that although family resemblance predicates are clearly intelligible and doubtless exist in English, they suffer from disabilities which make their successful removal from our thought an improvement. Seeming to See, CLEMENT DORE Until recently, many philosophers believed that there is a certain state?frequently called "sensing a sense-datum"?the existence of which is logically necessary for the perception of any object. Nowadays, this posi tion is commonly rejected. Professor Ryle, for example, has argued that there is no locution which is characteristically employed to report such a state and that we are therefore without the needed marks of our being conscious of it. As against Ryle, I argue that it is far from obvious that locutions such as "I seem to see ..." are not commonly used to report the state in question. In the course of my argument I consider and reject a number of analyses (e.g., those of Ryle and Warnock) of ". . . seem(s) to perceive ..." which entail that it is false or nonsensical to say that seeming to perceive is logically necessary for perception. INTERNATIONAL PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. V, No. 2: May, 1965 Reflections on Evolutionary Knowledge, MARTIN VERSFELD The article raises some epistemological and metaphysical questions arising from the fact that, in an evolving world, man is himself involved in the process, and must see his knowledge of the process from the point which he himself occupies in it. Thus he must ask by what right he retrojects his own present position and experience in descriptions of a pre human world, and in what sense, ontologically, he "represents" what went before. A theory of vicarious representation is developed. This raises the question of the relativizing of our knowledge, a question answered by an application of the Thomist dictum: cognitum est in cognoscente per modum cognoscentis. Since the cognoscens is exercising a consciousness which is itself in process of becoming, the degree of truth of his evolutionary theories depends on the act by which he self-consciously grasps his own being. The conclusion is that evolutionary theory has reached a stage when it can not be satisfied by purely "objective" description, but must include the historical situation of the observer in its constatation of its results. Jaspers: Beyond Traditional Metaphysics and Ontology, OSWALD SCHR?G The article is an attempt to show that Jaspers is both ontology's best friend and most severe critic. Ontology is man's most intensive effort to unveil being, but being is a perpetual unveiling and veiling, and instead of</page><page sequence="4">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 171 understanding being as that out of which all else proceeds, experience becomes weighted toward objective beings in the world. Consequently traditional metaphysics and ontology tend to reduce being to a mode of being in terms of object-being, self-being, or being-in-itself. Periechontol ogy resists equating a mode or modes of being with the source of being. All objectivity, including metaphysical objectivity, and all subjectivity as well, are capable of becoming cipher. The cipher is the only means of over coming the subjectivity-objectivity polarity. Metaphysics becomes the read ing of ciphers, the language of transcendence, and eventually all ciphers, including the pivotal cipher of Existenz founder, and foundering itself becomes the most decisive cipher pointing to both being and nothingness. Teilhard de Chardin: Scientist or Philosopher?, JOSEPH F. DONCEEL, s.j. In the process of evolution a double level of causality is at work, the level of efficient causality and the level of formal causality. To the former corresponds the scientific, to the latter the philosophical explanation of evolution. In his earlier writings Teilhard distinguished these two levels. In his later publications, he gives up the distinction and he urges the scientist to consider both of them and to combine both explanations. The article tries to show why Teilhard's earlier position is preferable. Never theless, a complete explanation of evolution is impossible without taking both levels into account. The scientific and the philosophical explanation of evolution imply each other; they stand to each other like the determined to the determining element, like body to soul. Both are always used implicitly, it is advisable that both be used also explicitly. This, however, is the task not of the scientist as such, but of the philosopher, or of the scientist speaking as a philosopher Stalin's Contribution to Soviet Philosophy, ANTON DONOSO As a result of the extreme form of the cult of Stalin's personality in the U.S.S.R., especially from 1930 onward, it was inevitable that Stalin should influence profoundly Soviet Marxism. Indeed, the history of philosophy in the Soviet Union during those years was largely the history of Stalin's "philosophical" activities. It is the purpose of this study to present an account of these activities, to examine any significant contribution made by them to Soviet Dialectical Materialism, and, finally, to attempt to deter mine how the so-called "de-Stalinization" has affected this contribution in respect to the contents of selected, current Soviet philosophy textbooks. Stalin's main contributions concern the concept of "revolution from above" (to justify Party "direction" of ideological activities) and the proposal that an aspect of society (e.g., language) could belong neither to the basis nor superstructure. His capabilities were along the lines of a practical politician who justified, ex post facto, in theory, what he had already accomplished de facto. Since his expos? Soviet textbooks have either completely ignored him or cautiously and/or critically quoted him.</page><page sequence="5">172 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS The Neo-Vedanta of K. C. Bhattacharya, GEORGE B. BURCH Vedanta philosophy is rational analysis of experience in terms of reality and appearance. The mark of illusion is that it can be sublated as a dream when we wake up. According to non-dualist Vedanta the whole world can be sublated. What cannot be sublated is the self. K. C. Bhatta charya follows the Vedanta practice of constructing a series of steps from object to subject with a new subtlety of discrimination which justifies the designation "neo-Vedanta." Freedom is attained, or rather recognized as eternally possessed, by progressive development of the subjective attitude from perception of environment to perception of the body, inner feeling of the body, knowledge of absence by conscious non-perception, image, idea, thought, feeling, introspection, non-individual self, and finally freedom itself. Basic Reflections on Husserl's Phenomenological Reduction, RUDOLF BOEHM The article traces out the history of the evolution in meaning of the phenomenological reduction in Husserl's writings. The starting point is Husserl's conviction that what is lacking most to philosophy as well as to science is a truly rigorous scientific method. Already in the Logical Investigations (1901) the phenomenological reduction is presented as the core of this method. But here this reduction is understood as a deliberate restriction or limitation of the mind to what is adequately perceived in an "adequately fulfilling intuition" within the immanence of consciousness, excluding any transcendence (i.e., suspending any judgment on it). In his lectures on The Idea of Phenomenology (1907) a significant expansion of the notion of reduction begins to appear. There is still the insistence on the absolutely given, but this now begins to include a certain "real tran scendence" extending beyond the sphere of "real immanence to conscious ness." This change appears first in his published works in the Ideas of 1913. This development is finally shown to link Husserl up by deep affinities with the "effort to verify in a higher sense the radical sub jectivism of the sceptical tradition," culminating in Nietzsche. Intersubjectivity in J.-P. Sartre, MAURITS DE TOLLENAERE The article traces the development of the theory of intersubjectivity in Sartre from L'Etre et le N?ant to Critique de la Raison Dialectique. In the former he took over the Hegelian dialectic of the An-sich and the Fiir-sich and the Master and the Slave, with the significant modification that the radical self-identical In-itself phase of being, which is self-consciousness for Hegel, is the brute facticity of unconscious being for Sartre. Thus the primary relationship between conscious persons becomes not that of destina tion for each other, as in Hegel, but mutual competition, threat, hatred. The insincere practical compromises of apparent friendship, love, etc., are revealed for what they are by the objectifying stare of the "third party," the witness. In his later work, in which he explicitly tries to integrate Marxism into his philosophy, he accords a more positive role to the third</page><page sequence="6">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 173 person in the formation of the social group. Yet despite all his efforts the basic relation between persons still remains one of mutual coercion with no place for authentic friendship or love. Medieval and Modern Science: Continuity or Discontinuity, ERNAN McMULLIN* (1) There is a fundamental discontinuity between Aristotelian and modern science regarding most questions of method; (2) insofar as the medieval period formed a bridge to the modern one, it was precisely to the extent that it saw the modification, or the beginnings of rejection of, some central Aristotelian themes; (3) nevertheless, medieval science remained basically Aristotelian in its approach; the transition from it to modern science was not a gradual evolution due to internal re-working, but much more a revolution in which the literary Renaissance, the growth of tech nology, as well as many other agencies outside the domain of science itself, contributed to a change of intellectual climate in which the Aristotelian approach to natural inquiry no longer made sense. THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. LXII, No. 6: March 18, 1965 Substitutivity, LEONARD LINSKY The principle of substitutivity is this: "Given a true statement of identity, one of its two terms may be substituted for the other in any true statement and the result will be true." There are well known counter examples, hence the principle must be ammended to apply exclusively to terms in referentially open positions. But so ammended the principle appears entirely empty for a referentially opaque position is just one for which the unamended principle fails to be a valid mode of inference. Defenders of the principle will argue that it is merely explicative of the concept of reference but the difficulty is that the concept of reference appealed to seems to involve nothing beyond the principle which is sup posed to explain it. The verdict of the uncaptive intellect would seem to be that the principle is just false. Self-Justifying Statements, ROBERT BROWN Are statements about one's own psychological attitudes and states self justifying? Chisholm has answered "yes," claiming that such statements exhaustively record their own evidence. This is mistaken. For I can always be incorrect in thinking that I have a particular belief or desire, since it is sometimes possible in fact to produce evidence against my claim, and it is always logically possible to do so. My assertion that I have a * This article appeared in the February issue of the International Philo sophical Quarterly, Vol. V, No. 1.</page><page sequence="7">174 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS particular belief or attitude neither ensures that I do nor ensures that I have identified it correctly. Arguments to the contrary take the occurrence of an attitude to supply it with either the whole or part of its own object. But either alternative leads to a vicious infinite regress. Implications and Analyticity, JOHN L. POLLOCK This is an attempt to clarify the logical concepts of implication and analyticity. Implication is characterized in terms of the relation of immediate implication, where we say that P immediately implies Q if and only if the inference from P to Q is immediate, requiring no argument. Such immediate implications arise from our "semantical intuitions," with the help of which we directly perceive logical relations. Then several ways of defining analyticity in terms of implication are discussed, and it is shown that they are all equivalent. Finally, the relationship between implication and the relation, "Part of what it means to say that P is that Q," is discussed. In the light of the paradoxes of strict implication, it is argued that these two relations are not equivalent, but rather, that the latter relation is equivalent to immediate implication. Vol. LXII, No. 7: April 1, 1965 Truth of Being, ALBERT HOFSTADTER Theoretical, practical, and ontological truth are described in order, with emphasis on the last. Truth is understood in terms of the adequa tion relation between intended and actual entity. Theoretical truth is adequation of intended with actual entity, practical truth adequation of entity to intended norm. In ontological truth the adequation relationship present externally in theoretical and practical truth is internalized within the true entity. The concept applies to artificial entities due to the consti tuting power of the mind that intends them. It applies to persons by way of their own immanent intentionality. An intentionalistic entity's essence is of the nature of a potency consisting in an endeavor after essence and actuality. For it, to be is to be a hunger for truth of being. This is de scribed for persons in the ethico-social sense and in the sense of the full possibility of their being: truth of personal being. Vol. LXII, No. 8: April 15, 1965 The Generality of Predictions, RICHARD M. GALE and IRVING THALBERG The contention of this paper is that any statement whose logical subject refers to a future individual, i.e., one that does not yet exist, must be general, while statements whose logical subjects refer to a past indi vidual, i.e., one that no longer exists, may be singular. The reason for this asymmetry between prediction and retrodiction is that future indi viduals, unlike bygone things, cannot now be identified. There are two relevant senses in which individuals are identified: (1) by means of a demonstrative, and (2) by the use of a proper name. Future individuals</page><page sequence="8">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 175 are not identifiable in either sense, but past individuals may be singled out in sense (2). Why not name future individuals now? This suggestion misses the important difference between giving a name to an individual and making up a name for an individual. Future individuals may be referred to by the use of definite descriptions, but this is not identifying. A woman may describe her assailant but be unable to identify him. Fatalism and Ordinary Language, JOHN TURK SANDERS Richard Taylor's brand of fatalism neither follows from his premisses nor, being untestable, is it cognitively meaningful. In ordinary language, it is analytic that if one has the ability (know-how) to (e.g.) swim, and conditions for the exercise of this ability are "normal" (one has not been bound, drugged, etc.), then one has the power to swim?even though a future necessary condition (e.g., turbulent water) or a past necessary con dition (e.g., not deciding not to swim) of swimming is lacking. Thus Taylor's main principles, (P) "No agent has the power to perform an act a necessary condition of which is lacking," is a false synthetic statement. Because Taylor unwittingly treats P as analytic, he is plagued by the bogey of fatalism, he drains "ability" of meaning, and he is committed both to bidirectional causation and to the idea that our own decisions deprive us of free will. Vol. LXII, No. 9: April 29, 1965 On a New Argument from Design, JAN NARVESON We rely on our senses for information about the external world. But if we were to rely on the information contained in a sentence found in scribed in sand, author unknown, we would be (logically) forced to assume there was an author; so perhaps there is an Author of Nature speaking to us about His creation through our sense organs. So argues Richard Taylor in his Metaphysics (Prentice-Hall, 1963). But (1) we have to sense (see or hear) the marks or sounds which embody sentences; but if our sense organs literally conveyed information to us, we should have to learn to "read" their language by knowing their structures before we could sense with them, and we don't. (2) We would not automatically trust anything our sense organs did happen to say to us even if they could say anything. We would have to check up on their veracity by observation. Thus sensing cannot be understood as analogous to understanding what someone or something is saying to us; hence the argument fails. Vol. LXII, No. 10: May 13, 1965 Craig's Theorem, HILARY PUTNAM Salmon's Vindication of Induction, IAN HACKING Reichenbach's "straight rule" for estimation says that when m of the n observed a are ?, you should estimate the long run frequency of ? among a</page><page sequence="9">176 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS as m/n. W. C. Salmon recently claimed to prove that this is the only sound rule for estimating on the basis of observed frequencies. But quite aside from difficulties connected with Goodman's riddles about "grue," the proof is defective. At least two more premisses are needed to single out the straight rule as both sound and useful. No one has yet given a good reason for believing either of these premisses, so Salmon's "vindication of induction" has not yet succeeded. On the "Meaning" of Scientific Terms, PAUL K. FEYERABEND In previous writings the author has attacked the principle of meaning invariance according to which the progress of science (must) leave (s) un touched the meanings of at least some descriptive terms and he has argued that total upheaval is preferable to piecemeal reconstruction. He has also tried to develop a methodology in which theories, and not only experimental results, are used for the criticism of accepted points of view. This dual enterprise was attacked on the grounds that theories could not compete unless they had some meanings in common. The present paper tries to show that this is not so and why it is not so; and it also uses a concrete example (classical celestial mechanics vs. general relativity) to elucidate the general argument. Vol. LXII, No. 11: May 27, 1965 Prima Facie Duty, ROBERT K. SHOPE It is argued that there are exceptions to moral principles, and that, because of this fact, a certain ambiguity in the account W. D. Ross gives of prima facie duty is harmful. For, in cases where there are exceptions to moral principles, this ambiguity leads to contradictory judgments as to which actions are prima facie duties. This ambiguity is explained and it is then argued that several attempts to make it harmless by not admitting exceptions to moral principles are unsuccessful. Finally, a way of elim inating the ambiguity in order to develop a useful conception of prima facie duty is proposed. Vol. LXII, No. 12: June 10, 1965 More About "About," HILARY PUTNAM and JOSEPH ULLIAN Some Comments on "About," THOMAS E. PATTON The workings of Nelson Goodman's criterion of absolute aboutness, in all but the simplest cases, are obscure. Goodman employs technical notions of designation and universal generalization, in particular, that are largely undefined. Suitable definitions for them are made no easier to find by the fact that Goodman's remarks about his own criterion are in consistent as well as incomplete. An interpretation of Goodman's criterion must clarify these notions and some others, guided by what seems most fundamental to his analysis.</page><page sequence="10">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 177 "Some Comments on 'About' " attempts to do this. In discussing universal generalization, the hardest notion to define, a criterion is advanced in terms of which several notions and the interpretations that embody them are rejected. An interpretation that satisfies this criterion is finally found. All does not end happily, however, for it turns out that on this or any reasonable interpretation the "principle of selectivity" supposedly embodied in Good man's criterion becomes idle in all but the simplest cases. A Simple Treatment of Complex Terms, JOHN BACON Geach has produced some ingenious examples to illustrate the anomalies that arise when complex terms like 'woman whom every tribes man admires' are treated as genuine logical units analogous to simple terms. If we formalize complex terms by means of a binding operator ?a? so that a which is &lt;?&gt; becomes ?cl&lt;&amp;&lt;x.?the anomalies disappear. They result, as it turns out, from confusions about the overlapping scope of [--operators and quantifiers. MIND Vol. LXIV, No. 294: April 1965 Privileged Access, A. R. LOUCH Surely the barrier to the feelings and thoughts of others is factual, not grammatical. Surely, too, we report our feelings, we do not merely express them. Why should philosophers have argued otherwise? Perhaps as deliberate paradox, to purge us of the bloated mental world that comes from assimilating feelings and observations to a single class of mental occurences. Or perhaps the philosopher is still mesmerized by the verifica tion principle, and so finds it intolerable to treat first-person statements as genuine, i.e., verifiable, reports. He fights paradox with paradox, replacing the bloated with the anemic mental world. He does not tell us about feelings and the talk appropriate to them, but about a usage of "report" consistent with the verification principle, or about the sense of "can't" in "One can't know what's going on in another's mind" that jibes with his doctrines about possibility and certainty. Practical Reason, R. EDGLEY Hume's argument against the possibility of practical reason pre supposes a practical-theoretical dichotomy based on the contrast between actions and propositions. The contrast between doing and believing presents a less formidable version of this dichotomy, and for an under standing of the nature and scope of reason a less misleading one: for what a reason is a reason for, even in the theoretical field, is not a logical item such as a proposition but a psychological item such as believing something. This notion of a reason as what justifies a person's psychological attitudes,</page><page sequence="11">178 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS and with them the person himself, exhibits logical truths as also normative. Though as logical truths they are non-substantive, since it is logically impossible for anything to contravene them, as norms they are substantive: illogicalities are logically possible. The principle of universality discussed in ethics is analytic and normative, non-substantive and substantive, in similar ways. Professor Tillich's Confusions, P. EDWARDS The article begins by making a distinction between the position of believers in an "anthropomorphic" and believers in a "metaphysical" god. On the former view, God can be literally characterized by adjectives taken from ordinary experience; on the latter, which is Tillich's position, terms taken from ordinary experience must be used "symbolically" or "meta phorically" when applied to God. It is argued that Tillich's theological sentences do not succeed in making genuine assertions about the world? they are compatible with anything whatsoever, even a world vastly more terrible and unjust than the one we live in; and they invariably contain untranslatable metaphors. The concluding sections of the article deal with some of the pronouncements by Tillich and other existentialists about Being and Non-Being. It is maintained that these, if they make any sense, are usually "bombastic redescriptions" of very familiar empirical facts. It is also argued that the existentialists have totally misconstrued the view of analytic philosophers that "nothing" is not a name. Negative judgments do not presuppose a realm of Non-Being any more than disjunctive judg ments presuppose a region of Or-Being. Remarks on Logical Necessity and Future Contingencies, A. H. IHRIG MONIST Vol. 49, No. 2: April 1965 Agent, Actor, Spectator, and Critic, L. W. BECK The differences between the "agent" or person as seen by himself and the "actor," the agent as seen by a "spectator" using only causal explana tions, are explored. The conditions under which the spectator, so defined, comes to use "agent-categories" and thereby becomes a "co-agent" or "critic" are investigated. It is argued that an understanding of these conditions throws light on the problems of freedom of will, predictability of behavior, self-reference paradoxes, and intersubjectivity of knowledge. Action and Agent, KURT BAIER The thesis defended is that all types of action admit of deterministic explanations. Five senses of "action" are distinguished, from one another, from "occurrences" and "undergoings," and from the philosophers impor</page><page sequence="12">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 179 tant notion of "performing an action." The latter is explained as the exercise of the capacity for action. The nature of that capacity is brought home by two imaginary cases, the Prisoner in his Body and the Conscious Puppet, illustrating the almost total loss of it. The Prisoner, still having goals but unable ever to reach them because perpetually overwhelmed by opposing and superior forces, has altogether lost control over the environ ment, though retaining vestigial control over his body. The Puppet, capable merely of envisaging desirable or undesirable states of affairs but incapable of initiating bodily change, retains control only over the mind. Finally, the agent's having control over something is explained in terms of the necessary and sufficient conditions of occurrences. Universalizability of Moral Judgments, P?TER WINCH Sidgwick's thesis that "if I judge any action to be right for myself, I implicitly judge it to be right for any other person whose nature and circumstances do not differ from my own in certain important respects" fails to differentiate moral judgments of importantly different kinds and, in particular, overlooks peculiarities of a kind of judgment, made by a prospective agent, about what he ought to do. The court-martial in Melville's Billy Budd is closely examined as an example. Although we can speak of such an agent "finding out" what he ought to do, he is not finding out what anyone ought to do in such a situation, but something about him self: something, however, which can only be expressed in moral categories. This interpretation does not lead to the moral and logical paradoxes which supporters of the universalizability principle have alleged to be involved in the denial of that principle. Pleasure as a Reason for Action, ALISDAIR MacINTYRE Prediction, Explanation, and Freedom, DAVID L. PERRY Application of a spectator's categories, prediction, and explanation to an agent's intentions and actions does not preclude the agent's freedom. In some situations these roles can be combined, but an agent logically cannot deliberate while anticipating his own decision or action. Neverthe less, an agent's deliberation is compatible with predictions of its outcome by a separate spectator. Intentions are explicable by the agent Or another spectator. Prediction and explanation as such do not preclude freedom of intention or action, although some bases for predicting and explaining intentions do preclude freedom and render deliberation and intention irrational. That freedom and predictability are irreconcilable may be ?n erroneous inference drawn from the fact that a deliberating agent cannot himself predict his decision. Misinterpretation of the fact that the agent category, reason for action, is not the spectator category, cause, may prompt denial that rational processes can be psychological causes. Disagreement as a Dramatic Event, DWIGHT VAN DE VATE, Jr. Currently, the philosophy of logic is dominated by the mathematical analogy in which logical rules are discovered and described, not made.</page><page sequence="13">180 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS But logic also has a function: it makes possible the social act of persuading. I argue that one creates oneself by role-playing, by persuading others of one's identity. Therefore the necessity of persuading is fundamental, and nothing?not even logic?is a descriptive last resort. Logic as a codified affair is a public invention, a response to the necessity of having ways to persuade. It follows that analogies drawn from ethical and political theory are at least as useful to the logical theorist as the customary mathematical ones. The Self as Agent and Spectator, ARTHUR W. MUNK In a day when there is new interest in the problem of the self, it behooves us to investigate two vital aspects, namely, agent and spectator. While the first implies the person as conscious center of unity together with such capacities as efficacy, freedom, and creativity, the second involves the ability to behold, to contemplate, and to observe objectively. Not only do these aspects lie at the basis of the higher nature of man, but it must also be remembered that, apart from a self or person, they become meaningless abstractions. As over against John Macmurray (in his book, The Self as Agent), by means of a synoptic approach, an effort has been made to do full justice to both agent and spectator. The truth of the matter is that, in the functional self-conscious unity of the person, both aspects really complement each other. Agency Without a Substantive Self, REM B. EDWARDS A non-substantive theory of selfhood is briefly developed as a pre supposition of making the notion of "self-determination" intelligible. The basic difference between this and older substantive theories such as that of C. A. Campbell is that for the latter the self causes its choices and other self-activities whereas for the former the self simply is its activities as well as its desires, feelings, etc. This non-substantive theory is defended against the six objections 1) that the libertarian misinterprets the nature of "trying" or "making an effort," 2) that the libertarian concept of self-activity is mere "chance," 3) that libertarianism makes motivation and character super fluous, 4) that it cannot explain "continuity of character," 5) that it cannot account for moral responsibility, in part because 6) it cannot meet the con dition of absolute personal identity. These objections are answered as they have been raised by such critics as No well-Smith, Ross, McTaggart and Rashdall. It is suggested that the controversy between determinists and libertarians is of great theoretical significance but that it is of little practical importance. Causality and the Self, DUANE H. WHITTIER This paper's thesis is that there is no proper way of conceiving the self so that freedom and determinism can be made to conflict. Libertarians who hold the self to be an unconditioned power of self-determination, and determinists who consider the self as never responsible for its acts, alike make the mistake of thinking that causality works upon us, rather than</page><page sequence="14">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 181 through us. The will is neither externally determined, nor is it a center of absolute freedom which non-determinately responds to confronting causal forces. Rather, we are a history of causation which interacts with present causal circumstances. In developing this thesis the "imputation" theory of free will is examined and judged consonant with, rather than an alternative to, determinism. Other topics explored are: akrasia; the "sub ject" versus "superject" view of the self; and the relation of performatives to imputations. A Third Dogma of Empiricism, THOMAS M. OLSHEWSKY The reference-orientation of positivism is a third dogma of empiricism. It is the assumption that man is a spectator standing over against his world, with truth and meaning dependent upon a referential relationship to that world. This orientation underlies not only Quine's "two dogmas," but the subject/object bifurcation in epistemology and the fact/value bifurcation in axiology. It arises historically out of the combination of empirical inquiry with a tacit metaphysical dualism. The pragmatic tradition opposes this with a use-orientation which precludes these several dogmas by taking intentional action as its starting point. The dogmas themselves have come under attack through recent developments in logic, philosophy of science, and psychology. The use-orientation avoids these difficulties and thus presents a better framework for inquiries. THE PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. XV, No. 60: July 1965 The Presocratic Origin of Explanatory Method, JERRY STANNARD Care and precision of documentation aside, interpretations of the meaning and intent of the Presocratics reflect the philosophic positions of their expositors. Among the influential interpretations was that of John Burnet. His identification of the Presocratics as scientists has been dis credited, largely because of his na?ve view of science. But if by "science" is meant the formulation of a method and not merely the gathering of facts and prescient anticipations of things to come, Burnet's thesis takes on new life. The present paper shows that the Presocratics, in an effort to explain some of the gross features of the world, made use of inference, classification, hypothesis, and generalization. It is not claimed that these are "steps" occurring seriatim or that they define the scientific method. Rather, this paper is offered as a corrective to the currently-fashionable theological and mythopoetic interpretations.</page><page sequence="15">182 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Incompatibilities of Colors, COLIN RADFORD "Nothing is red and green all over (at the same time)" has been variously interpreted. When misconstrued as asserting that red and green are not one color, i.e., some shades of red are not shades of green, it is obviously analytic. "Red" and "green" are not simply interchangeable in application in English. Construed as asserting that red and green are completely different colors, i.e., have no shades in common, it is again analytic. For we regard red, blue, yellow, etc., as single hues, and deal with mauve, orange?and green itself? etc., by treating them as (mixtures of) two or more hues. Lastly; if construed as asserting that red and green are incompatible, i.e., there is no analogue of mauve or orange, then, be cause "red" and "green" can only be taught with examples, the statement cannot be shown to be analytic or not?unless we find a counter-example! Does Knowing Make a Difference to What is Known?, JOHN F. POST The occasion of this piece is a criticism by Alan Donagan of an argu ment in Collingwood's Autobiography to the effect that it is absurd to claim to know that knowing makes no difference to what is known (realism). Unbeknownst to Donagan, and probably to Collingwood, precisely the same argument-form demonstrates the absurdity of the claim to know that knowing does make a difference to what is known (idealism). The argu ment is valid when supplied with a premiss which Collingwood does not state, a premiss also taken for granted by philosophers like Hume. If the premiss is true, then it is impossible in principle to know whether or not knowing makes a difference to what is known, one's being acquainted with an object cannot be a property of it, and Moore is not entitled to claim in "The Refutation of Idealism" that one's awareness of an object makes no difference to it. Impartiality and Intellectual Virtue, D. R. BELL The article is intended to cast doubt on two recently argued theses. The first of these is that impartiality is a differentia of moral as distinct from other kinds of judgements and the second is that impartiality is specially relevant to moral judgements in virtue of the logical form of such judgements. An attempt is made to clarify the notion of impartiality, the approach to this topic being made through the contention that impartiality is an intellectual rather than a moral virtue. An intellectual virtue is defined as a desirable characteristic of judgements, not all of which need be moral judgements. The article finishes with some remarks on the com plicated connexions of intellectual and moral failings in the light of the foregoing discussion.</page><page sequence="16">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 183 PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW Vol. LXXIV, No. 2: April 1965 Aesthetic and Nonaesthetic, FRANK SIBLEY Hume, Probability, and Induction, D. STOVE On the basis of certain passages in his writings, Hume is nowadays certified, by some leading philosophers and historians, as having proved not only that inductive arguments can never be demonstrative (in the sense of "logically conclusive"), but also that they can never even be probable (in the sense of the classical probability-theorists). This article points out that Hume uses "demonstrative" and "probable" in order to distinguish between arguments, not with respect to their degree of conclusiveness, but with respect to the nature of their premisses. And it tries to show, by a detailed examination of the argument in the passages in question, that far from having refuted the thesis that there are probable inductive arguments, Hume never even contemplated it. Are Logical Truths Analytic?, JAAKKO HINTIKKA Analytic truths are nowadays characterized as turning solely on the meanings of the terms involved (sense I of analyticity). Here two alter native senses of analyticity are explored. In sense II, a statement S is analytic if it conveys no factual information. In sense III, it is analytic if it is provable without using any expressions in which more individuals are considered than in S. Sense II is developed further by observing (with reference to certain normal forms the author has studied elsewhere) that each consistent quantificational statement in a sense admits some of a finite list of specifiable alternatives with respect to the world, excludes the rest. It is uninformative it is excludes no alternatives. The logical truths of quantification theory are analytic in this sense. However, they are syn thetic on the most natural interpretation of sense III, an interpretation which approximates closely the sense in which mathematical truths were synthetic for Kant. PHILOSOPHY Vol. XL, No. 152: April 1965 Freedom, ALAN RYAN Three questions are discussed: (a) Is freedom essentially negative? (b) Is freedom necessarily valuable? (c) Is the free-will problem about freedom? The method proposed is to examine the grammar of such expressions as "free to," "free from," "freely," "of his own free will." This</page><page sequence="17">184 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS method is defended against critics of J. L. Austin in the first part of the paper; employing it in the second part, we conclude: (a) "free" is one of Austin's "trouser-words"; its negativeness is that its meaning on any particular occasion requires an absent constraint, (b) because being free is being untouched by some constraint, freedom is necessarily valued by an agent, (c) that the "free-will" problem is muddled by confusing "Was he free to do otherwise?" with "Was he able to do otherwise?". It is the latter question in which we are interested, and an answer to the first ques tion may not help to answer the second. The Reification of Appearance, J. J. ROSS Process and Prediction, P. C. GIBBONS PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH Vol. XXV, No. 3: March 1965 Existentialism, Realistic Empiricism, and Materialism, ROY WOOD SELLARS The purpose of this paper is to correlate and appraise contending posi tions in contemporary philosophy. There are four of these demanding attention: realistic empiricism, materialism, existentialism, and neo Thomism. It should be noted that these positions are dominant in differ ent cultural regions and have divergent historical connections. In this respect, philosophy differs from science. I stress my own type of empir icism which diverges from the Humean and the pragmatic in that it builds on a re-analysis of perceiving. I call attention to a from-and-to circuit involving reference and information input. I hold that materialism must be considered more seriously and distinguish between an evolutionary and non-reductive materialism and dialectical materialism. The term 'dialec tical' needs clarification in usage. As I see it, traditional empiricism has been too phenomenalistic to grapple with materialism and dialectical mate rialism was not quite able to work out its "reflection" theory of perception. I have suggestions here. Neo-Thomism deserves careful study but never quite faced up to the Cartesian dilemma and the scientific view of things. I have sympathy with the existentialist's stress on human Existenz but I am persuaded that it has laid no new foundations. Isolation has been a weakness here. Moral Action, Ignorance of Fact, and Inability, DANIEL KADING I try to show that contrary to Prichard in "Duty and Ignorance of Fact" there are good reasons for maintaining that in certain respects at least we may be unavoidably ignorant of our duties and obligations, and of what is right and wrong generally. Why did Prichard stand so firmly against un avoidable ignorance of our duty ? I suggest that he is really thinking about</page><page sequence="18">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 185 one of the conditions for being blameworthy, for certainly it would be con tradictory to speak of someone's being blameworthy by virtue of unavoidable ignorance. I also raise the question of the connection between moral action and ability, and I try to show that there is much to be said against the usual view that "duty to," "wrong not to," etc., entail "able to." We are readily led to this view, I suggest, because (like Prichard) we are really thinking about one of the conditions for being blameworthy. Aesthetics, Signs, and Icons, CHARLES MORRIS and DANIEL J. HAMILTON This article reviews the main discussions and criticisms occasioned by the paper of Charles Morris, "Esthetics and the Theory of Signs" (Journal of Unified Science [Erkenntnis, Vol. VIII (1939), pp. 131-150]). This paper had suggested that the work of art was an iconic sign signifying the value (or values) which, as iconic, it embodied in itself as sign-vehicle. The theory of signs (semiotic) was considered the proper metalanguage for aesthetics. The present article displays criticisms of this view: that the work of art is not a sign; that the treatment of the iconic sign raises a number of problems; that semiotic has at best a limited value for aesthetics. Some account is also taken of views which in part support the position of the 1939 article. Looks, Impressions, and Incorrigibility, IRVING THALBERG Phenomenalistic theories of perception entice us because they in oculate one class of statements, namely those describing current appearances and sense-data, against doubt. Consequently it will weaken the spell of phenomenalism if we can explain why appearance and sense-datum state ments are not really immune to challenge and correction. In the course of the argument, crucial distinctions are suggested between various types of appearance-statements, and statements concerning sense-data and impres sions. The contention that sense-data possess indefinite characteristics is examined and rejected. Finally, it is asked whether the possibility that a man should be mistaken or ignorant about the way things look to him requires us to distinguish between the "apparent" and the "real" looks of things. This manner of accounting for such shortcomings is shown to be gratuitous and misleading. Explication and Ordinary Language Analysis, FRANK A. TILLMAN The business of philosophical analysis is clarification, but explicators and ordinary-language philosophers disagree about how to achieve it. Their mutual criticisms or attempts at arbitration are made at such a level of generality as to leave the basis for dispute or settlement obscure. By focusing on supposedly competing analyses of truth?Tarski's semantical and Strawson's performative conceptions of truth?the paper makes clarification itself the subject of clarification in an attempt to determine the basis of dispute. The disagreement between explicators and ordinary-language analysts could be settled if one procedure for achieving clarification could be shown</page><page sequence="19">186 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS to be more successful than the other. But obviously no question of relative success could be raised unless the goals of analysis were similar. An examination of actual practice reveals that the procedures are not alter native ways of achieving the same goal; rather they are different ways of realizing two different, and tenuously related, goals. The two goals of clarification determine what procedures will be used, and the procedures themselves determine in part what problems must be solved before clarifica tion can be achieved, what constitutes a problem demanding clarification, what constitutes a relevant solution to the problem, and, finally, what range of philosophical problems will submit to clarification.
