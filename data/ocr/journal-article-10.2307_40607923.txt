<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bioweapons: Postmodern Ruminations on a Premodern Modality Ruth Cecire Weapons function as interpretive keys to larger cultural and psychological subtexts. As instruments of death and destruction, they ignite our imagination by tapping unconscious intimations of personal extinction. As projections of our inner demons, weapons evoke dread and/or denial; as conduits for cultural norms, they mark the changing configurations of "the barbaric"; as societal "defense" mechanisms, weapons serve to sanitize inner rage by operationalizing it. In sum, the weapons we choose to kill with reveal much about w7ho we are and how we choose to live. Accordingly, I submit that the heightened risk of biowreapons' use as an instrument of tw7e η ty- first-century terrorist warfare is a significant hermeneutic through which to explore shifts in the contemporary Zeitgeist. The onset of the tw7enty-first century witnessed an incessant post- 9/1 1 chatter regarding weapons of mass destruction- where they are, who has them, w7ho should have them; a new lexicon of destruction emerged. The nation's late-twentieth-century emergence as the sole remaining superpower had buttressed its historic "exceptionalist" mythology and exposed a historic imperialist proclivity. Evidencing an implicit "might makes right" rationale, U.S. economic and political elites declared that all Feminist Studies 35, no. 1 (Spring 2009). © 2009 by Feminist Studies, Inc. 41</page><page sequence="2">42 Ruth Cedre manner of weapons were, a priori, a justified and vital part of our sustain- ing booty. We have the weapons we want because, as former President Bill Clinton recently noted in a different context, power fuels its own impri- matur; we do certain things simply "because [we] can." Conversely, these same political elites have assumed a moral high ground in their efforts to advance the nation's geopolitical interests by limiting these same weapons systems elsewhere. This "exceptionalism" was both threatened and emboldened by the events of September 11, 2001. "Our world has forever changed" was the ill- omened refrain that shaped the ensuing public discussion. After all, modern, twentieth-century wars were always fought on someone else's soil; some other country's civilians paid the price. By providing an all-too- palpable specificity to a seemingly amorphous and distant threat, the events of September 1 1 challenged our national complacency; our per- ceived immunity from attack was no longer credible. The toxic anthrax letters that followed the 9/11 attack only served to exacerbate this sense of public disquiet and fear. They evidenced the potential of new, more portable and cheaper weapons of mass destruction that were seemingly indifferent to our superpower arsenal and status. I wondered how this expansion of apocalyptic potentialities would affect our sense of being. Would new institutional rituals emerge to shape and/or manage our per- sonal and societal sense of safety? For example, air-raid drills were a regular school occurrence for my post-war/pre-baby boomer generation. My relationship with the nuclear arsenal was personal, even intimate. I was encouraged to believe, however erroneously, that I could forestall destruction by hiding under my desk, in the hall, or (as during the Cuban missile crisis) in my basement. I lived my life with the knowledge that some day a huge bomb might rain down from the sky, explode, emit radiation, and end my life. I think, in some part, because of this conditioning, I didn't experience the September 11 attack with the same astonishment that my grown daughter and her younger friends did. I nevertheless clung to the belief, more precisely the delusion, that I could, if needed, do something to save myself. With enough notice I presumed I could escape from ground zero; I could flee to Canada or even</page><page sequence="3">Ruth Cedre 43 a more remote location in South America or Australia. Bioweapons, on the other hand, effectively discourage such ruminations. There are no clearly designated safety enclaves, externally or internally. Insidiously, and without notice, modern bioweapon cocktails threaten to shatter our known humanness by rearranging our DNA code. This dread seemed to subsist as post-9/11 subtext; many commentators, either explicitly or implicitly, upped the pervasive angst by conveying the view that bio- weapons development crossed a significant normative boundary. As Robert Jay Lifton and Richard Falk note in their thoughtful volume Indefensible Weapons: The Political and Psychological Case against Nuclearism, our "mental relationships" to the weapons we create, our "illusions" about the dangers and protections they engender, inform our essential viewpoint. Each age's weaponry codifies the culture's approach to issues of life and death; each weapons system suggests a distinctive worldview. Accordingly, this article contemplates our "mental relationship" to bio- weapons by considering the meanings and implications of "weaponizing disease," the social, political, and cultural subtext of its potential use. It explores the salient distinctions between bioweapons and other contem- porary modalities of war. Most significantly, it identifies the linkages between the ascendancy of the contemporary bioterrorist threat and the new globalized world order, between its gendered connotations and the pariah status of bioweapons in much of the Western world.1 The analysis relies, in large measure, on two essential hermeneutics. The first is Jean-Marie Guehenno's contention that, in a globalized world, the significant distinction is between "those who [or that which] can escape boundaries and those who [or that which] can't." The second is Leo Braudy's view of war as an "exorcism" of sorts, a "casting out [of] what is feared and the affirmation of what is desired," that is, a gendered "ritual of differentiation and distinction."2 This article is not intended to be a scientific treatise or a moral critique. It references the scientific debate about development and use only tangentially as it relates to the article's overall argument; it does not ask if bioweapons' deployment can ever be "just." The article's underlying assumptions are twofold: (1) bioweapons are essentially "unjust" weapons by virtue of their inability to adhere to Just War concepts of proportional-</page><page sequence="4">44 Ruth Cedre ity, restraint, and respect for noncombatants; and (2) all weapons systems are subject to the vengeful excesses of their users. The article is conceived, in the main, as an etiological exploration of the context and psycho/social meanings attached to bioweapons in the twenty-first century. Background The weaponizing of disease is hardly a new phenomenon; the smallpox decimation of Native American populations that distinguished our history attests to that reality. From antiquity onward, disease has, in fact, been part of the available military arsenal. Scythian archers dipped arrowheads in manure and rotting corpses to increase the likelihood of their weapons' lethality. The Tartar practice of using plague-infected bodies as projectile missiles had an inglorious history from the Black Plague of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries to the early-eighteenth century when Russian troops threw infected bodies over the walls of their Swedish adversaries' encampments. Foreshadowing the events of the French and Indian War, Spanish conquistador Pizarro used contaminated clothing to infect South American native populations with smallpox during the fifteenth century.3 As Jared Diamond recounts, "the winners of past wars were not always the armies with the best generals and weapons, but were often merely those bearing the nastiest germs to transmit to their enemies."4 Although Japan, Canada, France, Germany, the Soviet Union, and the United States all contemplated the possibility of bioweapons' deployment at various points during the twentieth century, actual use in the modern era has been relatively restrained. World War I witnessed the use of chemi- cal weapons by the Germans; and, by the war's end, in 1918, Japan had established a bioweapons research unit. Fearful of Axis capabilities and intentions, Britain and the United States initiated their own research efforts in 1942 despite being signatories to the Geneva Protocols of 1925. However, Japan was the only World War II combatant to actually engage in germ warfare (a combination of anthrax, typhoid, and the plague) against their Manchurian adversaries.5 Undeniably, there has been a widespread consensus that biological and chemical weapons are particularly heinous, even within the context of the established military objectives of death and destruction. The fact</page><page sequence="5">Ruth Ceare 45 that, historically, germ warfare has only been directed against Native American populations and most seriously contemplated against enemies of color, for example, during the Korean and Vietnam wars, may, regret- tably, attest to this abhorrence. Underscoring this point, historians have noted that it was, in fact, the use by the United States of herbicides and tear gas in Vietnam that stalled the 1972 Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention's (BTWC) negotiations.6 Primarily, however, it has been a conflation of practical concerns and embedded delusions that has led the United States, in particular, to view modern bioweapons as mass destruc- tion instruments of last, rather than first, choice. Three agreements have sought to regulate the development, produc- tion, and use of bioweapons: the Geneva Protocol of 1925, prohibiting the use of chemical or biological weapons in war; the 1972 BTWC, the world's first ban prohibiting the development, production, and stockpiling of a whole class of weapons (effective 1975); and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention prohibiting the development, production, stockpiling, and use of such weapons, which entered into force in 1997. The BTWC ad- dresses the technological weapons gap between 1925 and 1972. Condemning germ warfare as "immoral and repugnant," President Richard Nixon approved the end of "use" as opposed to "defense" research in 1969 and ultimately signed the 1972 Convention. In reality, however, the 1972 Convention was a flawed document. Full of loopholes, it lacked mechanisms for enforcement or standards for distinguishing between defensive and offensive work. In the end, moral concerns appeared largely extraneous to Nixon's decision-making process. According to biowarfare expert Judith Miller, he signed the 1972 Convention to secure a military advantage: "If war wras costly and military action required tons ot ad- vanced equipment and nuclear arms, only the wealthiest countries could play the game. Cheap arms of devastating force leveled the playing field. And that was something that the U.S. wanted to avoid."7 These same concerns fostered the passage of a series of domestic safe- guards. In 1989, Congress passed the Biological Weapons Act, outlawing the possession, trade, sale, or manufacture of a biological substance "for use as a weapon"; the 1991 embargo barred U.S. companies from trading with countries thought to possess biological weapons; and the 1996 Anti-</page><page sequence="6">46 Ruth Cecire Terrorist Act allowed the arrest of anyone even "threatening" to develop or use biological weapons. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attack, the anthrax assaults served to intensify concerns regarding the possibility of ongoing bioterrorist activity. As a result, new regulatory controls on bioresearch were implemented. The Patriot Act of 2001 and the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 proscribed research involving agents deemed by the Centers for Disease Control to have dangerous potential.8 There is, however, considerable ongoing debate among the state parties to the Conventions regarding the potential efficacy of varying regulatory strategies. The United States, in particular, has argued that the unique characteristic of life science research renders a BTWC verification protocol largely ineffectual.9 The Ascendancy of Bioterror Disintegrative social and political forces that surfaced as the end of the cold war signaled the demise of the long-standing, post-World War II world order. The stability of the so-called nuclear age had been predicated on a rather simple strategy. Inasmuch as the high cost of maintaining a nuclear arsenal restricted the number of potential players, it was thought that superpower nuclear dominance could forestall the outbreak of wide- spread hostilities. This prevailing consensus was, however, shattered by a confluence of events including the collapse and balkanization of the former Soviet Union, attendant ethnic wars, the growth of a new global- ized economy, and the rise of fundamentalist Islam. Modern terrorism, what Braudy refers to as "the political aggression of the disenfranchised," stepped into the breach; undeterred by a nuclear arsenal, guerrilla tactics forced technologically advanced nations to largely abandon their distanced, technological advantage. To have any chance of success, First World nations had to transfer operations to guer- rilla-friendly terra firma terrain.10 Aptly dubbed "the dark side of globaliza- tion" by former President Clinton, bioweapons' transnational availability increased as the expertise of tens of thousands of newly impoverished, out-of-work Soviet scientists became a prized market commodity, avail- able to the highest bidder group and/or nation. Suggesting a "low-rent way to be a big player," it is akin, opined Miller, to "arranging to make</page><page sequence="7">Ruth Ceare 47 hydrogen bombs available at the supermarket."11 The fundamental prop- erties of bioweapons, that is, their inherent unpredictability and ease of their transport and use, make them uniquely suited for a guerrilla arsenal. Considered "quintessentially weapons of terror,"12 rather than effi- cient instruments of war, their utility has been questioned by both the military and scientific communities. Military critics refer to their lack of strategic predictability, while the accuracy of epidemiological data regard- ing magnitude of impact is subject to ongoing scientific debate. There is, nonetheless, widespread consensus regarding their psychological potency. Raising the specter of disease run rampant, public health preparatory exercises are infused with worst-case scenarios full of "grim epidemic images."13 Bio terrorism expert Margaret Hamburg addressed these issues in her March 1999 congressional testimony. A bioterrorist event is different from all other forms of terrorism in its potential to precipitate mass behavior responses such as panic, civil disor- der and pandemonium. . . . The damage that is inflicted is not to material infrastructure but to the human infrastructure-a kind of damage that takes considerably longer to repair.14 Terrorism intends to create public panic, "to wreak destruction via psychological means- by inducing fear, confusion and uncertainty in everyday life."15 Whereas some wars have strengthened feelings of com- munal solidarity, the intensity and intimacy of epidemics has historically signaled "an inexorable collapse" of social solidarity.16 Poignantly and singularly, a bioweapons attack anticipates apprehension among intimates, driving people apart rather than together. Inasmuch as a biological event is not likely to be immediately identi- fied, easily tracked, or contained, the initial public panic will likely be exacerbated over time as citizens wait to see, first, if they have been infected and, second, the extent of the damage. With an incubation period that can, depending on the pathogen, last as long as eight to twelve weeks, with an unknowable number of distribution points, public assur- ances will ring hollow. Eventually, palpable terror may incite repressive, violent action.17</page><page sequence="8">48 Ruth Cedre In the public consciousness, chemical and biological weapons are erro- neously considered to be similar entities; they are not. Chemical attacks are finite; once identified, they can be contained and neutralized. Con- versely, biological weapons are infinite in the magnitude of their potential spread. Chemical attacks are thought to have greater wartime utility because of their precision; yet, bioweapons have the capacity to inflict greater lethal damage and are thus considered a greater strategic threat.18 Further techniques used to cope with chemical attacks, such as "washing" the purported point of contamination, may only exacerbate a bioterror attack by spreading the pathogen.19 As Michael T. Osterholm and John Schwarz note in living Terrors, "bioterrorism relies on our inher- ent mobility."20 Both its virulence and usefulness as an instrument of terror is nourished and magnified by the new global world order. Deconstructing bioweapons discourse, we find terminology that has been historically gendered female. Characterized as uncertain, unpre- dictable, and inefficient, bioweapons invoke widespread panic, fear, and confusion in spite of or because of these widely held perceptions. Worst- case scenarios fail to focus on coping strategies but instead serve to rein- force the notion of a mass hysteria that cannot be controlled.21 Nicholas B. King questions the bases for this panic, asking us to consider how much of the anxiety regarding bioterrorism is "driven by a reasonable assessment of the risk and consequences of an attack, and how much by the displace- ment of other anxieties onto the nefarious figure of the bioterrorist?" Is the contemporary bioterrorist merely a more activist, modern incarna- tion of a historic circumstance; that is, is apprehension regarding societal upheaval being "refracted through the lens of infectious disease"?22 The New World Order Positing an era of growing nation-state obsolescence, Guehenno, as previ- ously noted, maintains that the ensuing paradigmatic hermeneutic is the gap between "those who [or that which] can escape boundaries and those [or that which] can't."23 Despite the post-September 11 resurgence of U.S. patriotic "tribalism," these "gathering-the-wagons" expressions of stunned disbelief do not, I would argue, alter the essential truth of Guehenno's ecopolitical perspective. Twenty-first-century power denotes mobility-</page><page sequence="9">Ruth Cecire 49 economically, politically, and personally. Economic arrangements still resist territorial imperatives as economic actors and their capital flow transnationally; political power is asserted on the world stage and through worldwide networks. On a more personal note, people who can, relocate and even change partners with relative ease. The diminished import of territorial boundaries has encouraged a corresponding construction of other internal and external limits. The ascendancy of such autopilot constructs as "zero tolerance," mandatory sentences, and "three-strikes" legislation reflects the populace's deep- seated uneasiness with the social and institutional flux that marked the end of the twentieth century. The veneration of standpoint, for example, is in constant tension with the search for a cohesive, metanarrative. Bioweapons reflect this purview perfectly. As science writer Laurie Garrett notes, "microbes and vectors recognize none of the artificial boundaries erected by human beings." Difficult to detect and highly portable, they suggest a fundamental permeability, both existentially and functionally. In contrast to nuclear weapons' fundamental solidity, they evoke both the unseen, mysterious pathways of cyberspace and the perva- sive and clandestine spread of the terrorist "threat." Although the poten- tial speed of the spread is not certain, bioweapons expert Richard Preston speculates that, absent effective controls, millions of persons could be infected with smallpox in just a few months. "It has," he notes, "taken the world 20 years to reach roughly 50 million AIDS cases. Variola could reach that point in 10 or 20 weeks."24 Evidencing E.O. Wilson's designation of the postmodern era, that is, an existential doubt that "we can know anything at all," bioweapons resist easily discerned, obvious categorizations. A pastiche of the primitive and the contemporary, technologically enhanced bioweapons are illustrative of a postmodern standpoint in their fundamental porousness and inher- ent "transgression of boundaries"- geographic, anthropomorphic, and symbolic- leitmotif. For example, in national security-speak, bioweapons are described as made of materials that have "dual use." As Garrett explains, "every step in production of bioweapons involved material and equipment that could be put to legitimate exploits. . . . The dual use dilemma lay at the heart of</page><page sequence="10">50 Ruth Cedre weapons inspection obstacles."25 In much the same way, one can employ a "dual use" hermeneutic to describe the disease trajectory. As weaponized vectors, diseased persons will be unwittingly transformed from targets/victims to perpetrators. The unlimited virulence of epidemic disease has historically been interpreted as signaling intimations of divine disfavor, a natural rebuke, and/or divine censure for problematic social change. Yet again, a "dual use" and/or "double effect" perspective is apt. Characterized by medieval Christianity as both a physical and moral pollutant, plagues were, none- theless, said to "purify" a degenerate populace by eradicating the "sinful" souls among them; it proffered nature's polluting essences as a cleansing communal remedy. In its manipulation of nature for lethal ends, biowar- fare denotes a human appropriation of divine authority reminiscent of the wrathful plagues of ancient Egypt. For those Islamic critics who are called to struggle by a desire to reinstate "the sacred" in modern life, bioweapons appear to offer disaffected, antimodernist groups the potential for a funda- mentalist-inspired corrective. What is so ominous in the current context, however, is that the increased likelihood of bioweapons' usage is occurring at a time when biologists are being schooled in "how to manipulate the instruction books of life." The potential dire consequences of these activities have alarmed some quarters in the scientific community. Notably, Nobel Laureate Joshua Ledeberg has warned that the creation of new disease agents through the manipulation of synthetic genes portends the "most perilous genocidal experimentation."26 A hypothetical research agenda, as Miller notes ominously, could in- clude a manipulation of all of the critical processes, including cognition, development, and reproduction. Imploding instead of exploding, biowea- pons signify a definitive deconstruction; human biological construction, as we know it, can be effectively manipulated and, in effect, dismantled and created anew. Contemporary reflections on the "weaponizing" of disease seem apt and peculiarly familiar. After all, the accepted argot for the discussion of nonweaponized, natural disease is rife with warlike metaphors. Diseases are "invasive"; patients are "bombarded" with X-rays programmed to</page><page sequence="11">Ruth Cedre 51 "kill" aberrant cells; and society often bands together to "war" against cancer, drug addiction, AIDS, and so on.27 As an identified combatant, microbes as a target and means of war has conceptual credence. The bioterrorist image replicates this porous paradigm. The "Global War on Terror" envisions the paradigmatic terrorist as a nonstate actor, unbound to international conventions, and, hence, an improbable nego- tiating partner. Signaling a pervasive lack of control, we fear that terror- ists will appropriate our research with the same ease they transverse borders.28 The dual-use dilemma is also evident in the scientific regulatory debate. Many scientists question whether bioresearch can ever be effec- tively regulated and controlled given its broadness, complexity, and amor- phousness. Conversely, others are concerned that attempts to control varying research projects will hamper the imaginative impulse needed for critical life research. As Ronald M. Atlas and Malcolm Dando note, "the more we advance our knowledge of life and develop biotechnology for human health and welfare the greater the risk of malevolent applications."29 Thus as both reflection and critique, bioweapons suggest a timely social exegesis. In an age that extols the false glamour of appearances, they are invisible; in an era of the transitory, they bear the virulence of nature's persistence; in a culture of infinite scientific possibility and ultimate control, they remind us of our essential powerlessness in our attempts to trivialize, conceal, and/or control death. The Nuclear/Bioweapons Spectrum Until recently, intimations of a nuclear holocaust most engaged the public apocalyptic imagination. In exploring the psychological dimensions ofthat hold, Lifton and Falk identified the following issues: • Nuclear weapons effect a distinctive quality of fear. The invisibility of the radiation they emit informs a pervasive sense of special mystery, a mystery that is heightened by the magnitude of their destructiveness. Evoking notions of the infinite, the destruction that nuclear weapons</page><page sequence="12">52 Ruth Cedre produce suggests that a Final Judgment may be at hand; as a result, a pervasive sense of helplessness abounds. • The central existential fact of the nuclear age is vulnerability. We are haunted by the possibility of extinction, that "life [may be] extinguished at its source." • An ultimate form of desolation not only "encompass[es] human death but [goes] beyond it." This extreme transgression, the possibility of destroying nature itself, leads us to "experience a quality of dread, hidden guilt and nothingness."30 I would suggest that biowarfare essentially magnifies these horrors. More significantly, perhaps, it shatters the illusions that Lifton and Falk say have framed our relationship with the nuclear age, that is, the illu- sion of limit and control, the illusion of foreknowledge and preparation, the illusion of recovery, and the illusion of rationality.31 Nothing is certain in the globalized, gluttonous, unpredictable twenty-first-century world. Although diseases would also be rampant in the wake of a nuclear attack, they would, in contrast, be an anticipated by-product of a clearly defined event. The aforementioned elemental mysteriousness, the pervasive sense of helplessness, is exacerbated by bioweapons' essential invisibility. While the buildup of nuclear weapons may, in due course, be detected, bioweapons production and dissemination is essentially indiscernible. Whereas the start of a nuclear attack, the initial detonation, will be all too evident, the silent emission of bioweapons will be, as noted, undetected at the onset. Referencing T.S. Eliot's resonant phraseology, it eliminates the patriarchal "bang" in favor of his prophesized, and softer, whimper. Shrouded in mystery, bioweapons are about not knowing and waiting; long-estab- lished, traditional warfare assumes the questionable comfort of recogni- tion and potential detection. In a bioterrorist incident, for example, it may be difficult to determine at the outset whether an outbreak was the result of enemy activity or a naturally induced contagion, and thousands of persons may be infected before a definitive diagnosis and a clearly dis- cernible pattern emerges. The illusion of control that high-tech, compli- cated, fallback missile-detection schemes promise would be rendered useless; once unleashed, toxins are exceedingly difficult to control.</page><page sequence="13">Ruth Cecire 53 Newly reconfigured versions of old deadly bacteria and/or viruses may attack vital internal organs in unanticipated ways. As a result, health professionals may be significantly hampered in their ability to identify and treat infected persons. The word "vulnerability" seems ultimately too slight and insignificant to describe affected communities' state of mind. There is, after all, a modicum of comfort in the "idea of a violently attained [nuclear] nothingness."32 The violence of an identified projectile offers the illusion of ultimate control; the essential mystery appears to be forestalled. Recovery is equally difficult to imagine. An ongoing and pervasive terror may incite repressive, irrational, and/or violent actions.33 Signaling the import of the relational as opposed to the substantive, the structure of cities and towns will be untouched. Ostensibly unworthy of the virus's trouble, the obsolescence of the tangible is seemingly underscored by its very presence. Whereas the intimacy and invisibility of bioweapons' targets will likely exacerbate the difficulties of psychological recovery, a changed human configuration will render it nearly impossible. Intimations of extinction will be intertwined with apprehension regarding the misappropriation of the divine. Although nuclear weapons' lineage is clearly anthropomorphic, modern bioweapons' brew, a concoc- tion of human ingenuity and natural, some would say divine, forces, clearly crosses over onto questionable territory. Our ability to alter and interchange the basic elements of life suggests an all-too-credible Franken- stein scenario. A nuclear weapons attack will result in a certain and know- able demise for most persons circa the epicenter, but life may horribly proceed for victims of biowarfare. A palpable sense of futility and desola- tion, a magnification of the aforementioned, "dread, hidden guilt and nothingness" may well epitomize a postepidemic world order. Gender Dislocation Yet, comparisons of weapons' malevolence are inherently difficult. On what bases can w7e reasonably compare a bioweapons' induced demise with other timeworn methods of destruction? How, for example, does it compare with a death by stoning, electroshock torture, gunshots, arrows, lashing, crucifixion, and/or a funeral pyre? Is death by nuclear conflagra-</page><page sequence="14">54 Ruth Cedre tion really a more sanguine ending? These are difficult, if not impossible, questions to answer. Barbarity as a moral judgment is, in the end, a rela- tive concept that conveys both a given era's sociocultural subtext and its notions of honor.34 "Trustfing] the wisdom of [our] repugnance,"35 as Leon R. Kass has advised in a different context, it is instructive that biological and chemical weapons are, after all, the only cohort of weapons that has been interna- tionally banned. As weaponry "ethics" appears a dubious concept to many, the question arises as to why this particular group of weapons has been singled out for international condemnation by aforementioned treaties' signatories. Gender, in addition to the practical concerns already discussed, appears to offer a useful prism through which to contemplate these issues. The feminine/masculine divide is a (or perhaps "the") critical her- meneutic through which each society constructs experience, assigns meaning, and asserts its basic values. Bridging the essentialist/construc- tionist rift, I would argue that this divide is informed by a conflation of biological difference and cultural representation. It is my contention that bioweapons have been disdained and ostensibly banned, at least in part, because they are largely gendered female and, hence, do not serve the fantasies and ends of the patriarchal war system; their semi-androgynous amalgam of science and disease fuels and substantiates extant culture and gender wars. As instruments of terror for the aforementioned "disenfran- chised" nations and groups, they connote the mythical "furies" of "disem- powered" female rage. That is not to say that bioweapons will never be employed by First World powers but, rather, that gendered perceptions shape their geopolit- ical status and deter potential use. Evidencing what Barbara Ehrenreich and Arlie Russell Hochschild refer to as the "metaphorically gendered relationship between rich and poor countries,"36 First World males are intent on safeguarding their advantage by denying their Third World (disempowered) counterparts access to weaponry that would equalize the destructive playing field. Lastly, inasmuch as each weapon system conveys a certain status, banning a class of weapons, declaring them outlaw arma- ments, functions to further demean potential users.</page><page sequence="15">Ruth Cedre 55 War, as Braudy notes is an "exorcism" of sorts, a "casting out [of] what is feared and the affirmation of what is desired." As a means of demonstrat- ing "who we are versus who we are not," war has been historically charac- terized as a "ritual of differentiation and distinction."37 The tension between the need to establish control and predictable wartime excesses demands that critical distinctions be fortified lest they collapse entirely. Most often, however, the reinforcements of traditional gender delineations serve to nourish the aspirations of an ecstatic phallic culture by giving license to eroticized male violence. Recent images of female soldiers as forbidding dominatrices essentially serve this paradigm. Thus, although contemporary wars, particularly those fueled by secular or religious ideology, have been defended as wars of high purpose, of "love," in the end they invariably serve the gods of "lust" and desire- for ever more power, sex, thrills, and/or riches. Analogizing war excess to drug addiction, New York Times war correspondent and author Chris Hedges suggests in the 2002 War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning that ever more perverse and extreme behavior is needed to satisfy this essential crav- ing. The anonymity and passivity of biowarfare scenarios fail to meet this critical challenge.38 The physical combat that characterized traditional wars- a ritualized conflation of male violence and sexual aggression-has been historically viewed as a quintessential male marker. It is not just that across cultures and races men have been largely responsible for the planning and fighting of wars,39 it is, more precisely, that wars have "often served to define manhood exactly." Particularly in times of social and economic flux, war has shored up gender identities by providing men something "uniquely manly" for them to do."40 The conflation of male muscle with military prowess has served as a paradigmatic point of demarcation. And so it remains. In both wars of insurgency and missile-intensive incursions, the telos of war, despite a growing female presence in some military organiza- tions, remains the valorization of male muscle- on the ground or meta- phorically via "masculinized" projectile weapons systems. Thus an "alpha" aspiring male, such as George W. Bush, found it difficult to estab- lish the multilateral alliances that his "sissified" opponent John Kerry believed essential.</page><page sequence="16">56 Ruth Cecire As a requisite proving ground for masculinity, a wartime macho culture is fueled by a defining "flight from the feminine" (not necessarily the female).41 Taking this observation a step further, Nancy Hartsock has written that war culture, at its core, intensifies what she refers to as a com- munal "barracks" mentality, that is, a worldview informed by the primitive fear of and hostility toward women.42 After all, rapes of enemy civilian women have been considered a time-honored strategy and/or bounty of war. The recent reportage regarding rapes of servicewomen in the Persian Gulf by fellow soldiers unfortunately serves to reinforce this point.43 Categories of Weapons: Metaphoral Implications It follows that weapons, what Betty Reardon refers to as the "tools and icons of the war system,"44 are similarly gendered. In fact, the Anglo- Saxon word for the males of a species, whether humans or animals, is "woepned" (weaponed).45 Men are, and have always been, endlessly fasci- nated with their "weapons"- be they anatomical, mechanical, electronic, nuclear, or digital- in ways that typically elude and/or even intimidate some women; weapons have been time-honored instruments of play for the growing and adult male. Their allure persists and is basic to contem- porary geopolitical relations; a nation's status and power are directly related to the weaponry it possesses. The First World's "masculinization of technology" has been intentionally designed to extend the patriarchal state's use and abuse of power; "masculine" weaponry secures "masculine perceptions and values" as the essential lens through which war and peace are discussed and understood.46 Both Helen Caldicott and Carol Cohn have discussed the link be- tween weapons development, gender discourse, and male sexuality. Caldi- cott's much-quoted term "missile envy" aptly conveys her hypothesis that the "arms race" exists to mask male emotional and sexual vulnerabili- ties behind ever-bigger military budgets and ever larger, sexually sugges- tive, weaponry. Describing a missile launch, she notes how it rose slowly from the ground, surrounded by smoke and flames, elongated into the air. It was a very sexual sight indeed; more so when armed with the ten warheads it will explode with the most almighty orgasm. The names used by the military are laden with psychosexual overtones; missile</page><page sequence="17">Ruth Cecire 57 erector, thrust-to-weight ration, soft lay down, deep penetration, hard line and soft line.47 Cohn relates her experience observing an all-male community of North American nuclear defense intellectuals and security affairs analysts during the Reagan era in two articles, "Clean Bombs and Clean Language" and "Wars, Wimps, and Women: Talking Gender and Thinking War." Underscoring Caldicott's thesis, Cohn reports that because of the con- stant need to prove one's manhood, a sexualized discourse, veritable verbal "pissing contests," served to obscure any personal vulnerability or concern about lives lost; to do so risked being ostracized and demeaned as "soft," a "pussy," or for "acting like a wimp," which is, in their eyes, femalelike. Concern that Russians were essentially "harder" permeated strategic discussions, while, at the same time, new entrants to the nuclear club were said to have lost their virginity. It is thus hardly surprising to learn that when Edward Teller communicated news of the first success- fully detonated hydrogen bomb, his telegram exclaimed, "It's a boy."48 Extant customary weapons still reflect a time-honored masculine iconography. Like arrows and guns, conventional and nuclear bombs evoke clearly discernible phallic imagery; the power and immediacy of their impact connote a masculine orgasmic event. Biowrarfare's essential formlessness denotes a terror long associated with the primordial female; the extensive and continuing waves of contamination suggest a more expansive female response. In contrast to a boundaried and finite mascu- line sensuality, the amorphous intensity of female sexuality is, in contrast, unsettling. While the trajectory of the male orgasmic event is decidedly public, the workings of the female orgasmic arc are largely hidden from view; female "delivery systems" have historically been enveloped in mys- tery. Females' ability to mask and/or "fake" their response in ways unavail- able to their male counterparts reinforces notions of an unknowable and plausibly insatiable female sexuality- a clear and continuing danger to male control and self-esteem. Similarly, by failing to offer the desired buzz of a spectacular launch, bioweapons' invisibility and camouflaged "dual-use" delivery systems disappoint and confound. Whereas missile technology development</page><page sequence="18">58 Ruth Cedre aspires to ever-greater precision and control, bioweapons are essentially uncertain in their impact. One is finite and targeted; the infinite and expansive "other" depends on a relational web to sustain its spread. Subtly subversive of the prevailing "phallic" culture, the chaos, mess, and disor- der of an epidemic fails to suggest the integral ecstasy of General George Patton's delineation of war, that is, the "cataclysmic ecstasy of violence."49 Virulence Like female sexuality, female-linked violence has been symbolically and socially construed as dangerous in its lack of constraint. Noted war theo- rist Jean Bethke Elshtain documents gendered connotations of violence from early Greek writings. She notes that "male revenge and killing [was] publicly sanctioned and ha[d] a large purpose. Female killing [was] disor- derly conduct, private revenge spilling beyond the bounds of the house- hold or threatening the bases of social order."50 Metaphorically, the pandemonium associated with female violence has historically denoted the contours of a terrorist act. Although the concept of female rationality is no longer considered the definitive oxymoron it once was, remnants of outmoded archetypes still abound in the collective unconscious. Notions of a volatile and boundless female sexuality are still linked, by many, to long-standing notions of the female body as paradigmatic nature, that is, essentially messy and out of control. Metaphorically suggestive of both beneficence as well as a more capricious and brutal potentiality, the female body as nature incarnate has been intermittently used to signify an all-powerful, alternately nurturing and/or engulfing mother, unreasoned sexuality and violence, reproduction, disease, and death. It is, after all, both the initial wrenching from our mother's wombs and the subsequent detachment from the early symbiotic state that provides our first intimations of ulti- mate departures. It is also instructive to recall that clearly destructive forces of nature, such as hurricanes, were uniformly christened with fe- male names until a changed political consciousness forced a more equi- table gender assignment. This conflation of female sexuality, disease, and death has also informed Western religious and medical traditions. Eve, the initial index</page><page sequence="19">Ruth Cedre 59 case, has not only been blamed for humanity's mortality; but also, in her disobedience and desire, she has been vilified as the initial vector for the sexual transmission of "original sin." The strength of the "Eve" imprint was still at work in the efforts of nineteenth- and twentieth-century contagious disease "warriors" to stem sexually transmitted disease by focusing on women as primary conduits of dissemination. Pollutants: Honor and Dishonor In many fundamentalist and traditional societies, female and/or male family honor rests precariously on the shoulders of related females. In effect, the more dependent men are on women for preserving male honor through sexual fidelity or, secondarily, women's productive and repro- ductive abilities, the more women are likely to be perceived as threatening and polluting.51 Furthermore, cultural mores continue to sanction the elimination or brutal humiliation of the identified "pollutant" as an appropriate rejoinder for the perceived sullying of the family honor. Similarly, in many religious and culturally orthodox societies, the "impurity" of menstruation (blamed in many traditions' ancient writings for a panoply of harms from "blighting crops to rusting iron and bronze") requires that a woman be essentially "quarantined," that is, temporarily eliminated/separated from her mate, family, and/or community.52 As a messy, uncontrollable, albeit toxic pollutant, bioweapons suggest a similar iconography and demand a similar communal remedy. Conversely, war (gendered male) has been historically viewed as a natural elixir and a purifying crucible; it has been often marketed as a necessary counterweight to cultural fears that a "growing effeminacy" was "sap[ping] a nation's vitality" and/or an antidote to moral laxness. War was to shape character and offer opportunities to demonstrate honorable action. Honor, however, requires evidence; as Braudy notes, it "must be risked [and observed] in order to be validated."53 A bioweapons attack virtually eliminates the time-honored tests of physical risk linked to mili- tary prowess. A populace is, in effect, ambushed without warning; in a war perpetuated by unseen microbes, heroic action will, of necessity, be shared by a more androgynous conflation of medical and military personnel.</page><page sequence="20">6o Ruth Cecire Referencing more recent events, Braudy's excellent and compre- hensive 2003 exploration, From Chivalry to Terrorism: War and the Changing Nature of Masculinity, underscores the import of gender as a critical military hermeneutic. Practical-minded skeptics might laugh at the idea of Freudian war, in which the phallic power of greater weaponry gets deployed against an obdurate enemy. . . . But fantasy has a deep role in war preparations and nowhere is it more significant than in the 20th century, when it merged with the explicit image of a masculine and virile state. . . . The attack on September 11th was made in the name of exclusionary masculine culture against what it considers an emasculated mercantile culture.54 It is this pervasive gender anxiety that, in part, fuels a likely reemer- gence of bioweapons as an instrument of disenfranchised terror in the twenty-first century. In a struggle over manly preeminence, a sado- masochistic leitmotif lurks (note Abu Ghraib). For those nations/groups unable to secure commensurate First World bulk, biowarfare offers the promise of bringing First World virility to its knees by regendering the power divide. (During the first Gulf War, similar fantasies were manifest in a widely circulated cartoon that depicted Saddam Hussein kneeled over in prayer with a huge missile poised to "penetrate his upraised bottom."55) Fundamentalist fervor is energized by the thought of weaponizing an "im- pure and polluting" essence to attack First World "infidel" nations. In a somewhat parallel development, a 2005 Newsweek article entitled "Women and Terror, Al Quaeda's New Recruits"56 detailed the recruitment and use of female suicide bombers by Al Quaeda. The recruitment campaign had a twofold message initially; women were "shamefully" needed because men were not stepping up in sufficient numbers to the hallowed "suicide" plate. In desperate circumstances, training as suicide bombers offers dis- possessed, "impure"- no longer virginal- women the possibility of regain- ing social position by volunteering for a communally venerated, more "efficient" use of the traditional widow's pyre. By infiltrating, polluting, and humiliating First World adversaries in their most intimate spaces, bioweapons breed impotence via a paradig- matic, albeit "sissified" rape. While the less powerful certainly understand the force of a visually cataclysmic event (witness 9/11), the logic and effi-</page><page sequence="21">Ruth Cecire 61 ciency of unseen, portable, and cheap bioweapons has not been lost on terrorist enclaves. Remedial Strategies Interestingly, both the problem of bioterrorism and the requisite preparedness strategies have similar configurations. Both are global and unboundaried; both are gendered female. While nuclear preparedness denotes the development of high-tech hardware, such as retaliatory missiles, bioweapon preparedness seeks to integrate the formerly separate silos of medicine, public health, law enforcement, and national security in order to create a preventative "global web of protection."57 Replicating the dual-use paradigm, public health programs emphasize both prevention and control- of communicable diseases, of vulnerable populations. Public health is what many would call a parental, even a "mommy" undertak- ing. Charged with developing population-based health promotion initia- tives, the public health authority seeks to implement "best" health practices through the alternate use of carrots and sticks. Privileging benefi- cence and justice over autonomy concerns, public health epitomizes a feminist relational perspective in its understanding that intersectionality is key to the transmission as well as the remediation of disease. It asks how we can best "play well" together for the benefit of all instead of how any one nation can prevail. Recommending "healing" instead of "killing" as an appropriate defensive strategy, it is decidedly at variance with the predominant wartime macho culture. Conclusions Biowarfare essentially magnifies anxieties long associated with the nuclear nightmare. It shatters the illusions that have framed our relationship with the nuclear age, that is, the illusion of limit and control, of foreknowledge and preparation, of recovery and rationality. It underscores our ultimate vulnerability. Bioweapons illustrate the paradigmatic tensions and fears of our era. Their essential properties denote contemporary power arrangements. In an age when power is distinguished by its ability to transgress borders, bioweapons offer the potential of rapid mobility and total transparency.</page><page sequence="22">62 Ruth Cedre Quintessential instruments of terror, they track the displacement of the cold war by the War on Terror as the defining U.S. geopolitical fixation. Dubbed the "dark side of globalization," the accessibility of bioweapons suggests, to Western audiences, a sinister outsourcing, a potential transfer of lethality from First World to Third World players. Positioned in the crosshairs of the ethics of scientific exploration, bioweapons call to mind the sinister potential of science gone amok. In their refutation of the tangible, they correspond to the cerebral and unseen world of cyberspace; in their "dual-use" construction and disease trajec- tory, they evince a postmodern resistance to definitive categorizations. Yet, as both reflection and critique, bioweapons suggest a timely social exegesis. In an age that extols the false glamour of appearances, they are invisible; in an era of the transitory, they bear the virulence of nature's persistence; in a culture of infinite scientific possibility and ultimate control, they remind us of our essential powerlessness in our attempts to trivialize, conceal, and/or control death. I have argued that bioweapons' ostracism from the internationally en- dorsed arsenal is due, in part, to the fact that they are, in critical ways, gendered female and, hence, do not serve the fantasies and ends of the patriarchal war system. Bioweapons are at variance with the instruments of play and symbolic extensions of prowess that have largely defined the male coming-of-age process; their semi-androgynous amalgam of science and disease suggests extant culture and gender wars. Although the traditional cohort of weapons is finite and targeted, bioweapons' infinite and expansive properties depend on a relational web to sustain their spread. Subtly sub- versive of the prevailing "phallic" culture, the chaos, mess, and disorder of an epidemic fails to meet Patton's "cataclysmic ecstasy of violence" war test; the nation's outsized ego demands that its destructive power be seen and admired. In actuality, the dread associated with an anticipated bioweapons attack parallels the fantasies and fears regarding the primordial female (that is, of an unruly, uncontrollable power) that have long held us cap- tive. While male violence has historically suggested communal approba- tion and common purpose, the pandemonium and lack of restraint associated with mythical female "furies" has denoted the contours of</page><page sequence="23">Ruth Cedre 63 terrorist activity. The gendered associations between an essentially impure and unclean female body and disease fuel a pervasive revulsion; the quarantine of "impure" menstruating and/or sexually active women in traditional societies suggests communal responses to germ warfare pollutants. In the contemporary struggle between modern and tribal versions of patriarchy, the weaponizing of disease most often suggests a usurping of a disdained female power by disaffected, disempowered players. If war is a "casting out" of that which is most feared, bioweapons proffer traditional patriarchal societies the opportunity to "cast out" female and/or androgy- nous power, to use Western modernity/"toxicity" against itself. In its reliance on a global network of public health practitioners as a primary modality of defense, bioweapons are, again, distinguished from the more culturally syntonic "macho" war machine.
