The only exception is the doctrine of Augustine,1 but this violent reaction from pagan philosophy was soon smothered in the chaos of Rome's fall. The doctrines of the Pantheists, Manicheans, Epicureans, and Averroists each enjoyed a period of vogue, but none ever seriously threatened the supremacy of the traditional view. Protestantism denied the Pope's right to dictate his own in terpretation of that view, but it did not challenge its substan tial correctness. This philosophy, which I shall call scholastic, was inevi tably both eclectic and variable. To say that Clovis and Suarez shared a common philosophy is obviously preposterous. But I think I may say that each conceived of the hierarchy of powers in rather the same way. The sources of the view were the Old and New Testaments, Plato, Aristotle, and Plotinus.

Nor were the changes purely cyclical: for the advance from Clovis, in 500, to Suarez, in 1600, is enormous. Nevertheless, the changes were in the proportions rather than in the ingredients, and the frame or architecture, grown no less supple with the ages, had always been able to adapt itself to the strains. It is frequently said that the Thomist synthesis crystallized the doctrine, but this is to overlook the prestige of Scotus and Occam, whose own conceptions rivalled that of Aquinas dur ing the whole period from 1310 to 1550. Thomism's first decisive victory was at the Council of Trent. At the very peak of this hierarchy are the eternal truths ? a relic, no doubt, of the Greek Fate. Conspicuous among them are the laws of logic and mathematics, and ? though this was sometimes a matter of dispute ? the fundamentals of physics and of human nature. Even Scotus, whose apoth eosis of God's omnipotence and free will was an age-long scandal, had said: Nor does it follow that, so long as fire remains fire, it can be im proved by being endowed with intellect and will, because it is not capable of possessing them.la Which means, according to Gilson, that, " even if God wished it, He could not endow fire with intelligence and will since this is contrary to its nature." And Suarez declared that God could not have made human nature other than it in fact was by nature.2 Even as late as 1630 the Schools taught that God had not created and could not now change these eternal truths or essences of things.3 Exactly how these truths came to exist ? whether pre existing from eternity, or created by God out of nothing ? was not made clear. Presumably the truths of logic and mathematics were uncreated and eternal, being realities apart from any physical existence. The other truths, however, were originally contingencies or potentialities the actuality of which depended on God's creation. God might have pre la Quoted in E.

Thus only the existence, but not the nature, of that which He created was within the power of His free will to determine. And it was on this account that His under standing, which taught Him this nature, was necessarily some thing different from His will, by which He chose to bring it into being.4 God was therefore not omnipotent; He was given principles and essences, not of His own making, with which to create what He could. Having created, and having put this creation into operation, He was then further obliged to see that it con tinued to function as He had intended that it should. God must be the First Mover for the simple reason that, if the universe were not constantly being moved, it would, like a watch, quickly run down and stop. He was thus not only justice but also energy, and. He wielded both powers rather by superhuman than by supernatural methods ? by mecha nisms and agencies rather than by a mere fiat or exercise of will. Like a despot's, His will was law, but only because He acted as well as willed and because He also had subordinate forces to help Him. The agencies which He employed in physical matters were the outer, or eighth sphere of the fixed stars and the seven inner spheres, in each of which a planet was embedded. Whether these functioned by purely mechanical laws or through star intelligences, was a favorite topic of scholastic controversy, and it was also a matter of debate whether the nine hierarchies of angels ha,d any part in this transmission of purely physical energy.5 For the transmission of spiritual energy God's first agent after the Creation was the Devil, through whom God tempted Eve. The Fall which thus ensued greatly enlarged the scope of the Devil's operations, and at the same time made possible the creation of a privileged class ? of prophets and saints ? 4 E. Gilson, Le Thomisme (Paris, 1923), 58-77. 5 Aquinas said that they did not: ibid., 125 and 128.</page><page sequence="7">2l6 MASSACHUSETTS HISTORICAL SOCIETY [MAY organized to counteract the Devil's activities. By a skilful manipulation of these conflicting agencies God was able to actualize the potential good or evil latent in every human individual. At times, as in Augustine's day, these saints and demons were merely helpless tools manipulated by God; at other times, as under the Merovingians, the saints became repre sentatives of God with broad discretionary powers. The Devil, indeed, as we shall explain in a moment, was for a long time even thought to be capable of acting beyond his authority and so in defiance of God. But, whatever the details, it was always recognized that agents of one or another sort were in dispensable for the proper realization and execution of God's intent. This God, with His Old Testament disappointments and His Greek artifices, had therefore created the world and man only in the face of difficulties and at some risk to His peace of mind. It was hard to believe furthermore that, were He in fact omnipotent, He would have chosen to redeem man by so cumbrous and agonizing a method as was the Passion.5a Such was the divine hierarchy. The second hierarchy was that of man. Since, by the Fall, man had been deprived of all knowledge of God beyond a " dim glimmering of light unput-out," 6 even the revelations of God could not suffice to teach man the truth of virtue. The Church had therefore to be instituted, to guide men's feeble will and understanding toward the light. And since, too, by the Fall man had also lost control of his passions, the State ? founded on the principles of natural equity and inalienable rights ? had also to be organized to keep those passions from injuring, not the man himself, but other men. Here, there fore, was a twin hierarchy: at the head of each a single person, ruling, through agents, over his subjects. Sometimes, as by Leo the Great and Justinian, the agents were conceived as mere puppets of the ruler, at other times it was felt that the Councils must control the Pope, and Bishops be popularly elected, that the Emperor or King must be controlled by an hereditary nobility and by elective bodies. There were even 5a See for instance Leo the Great, Sermons, #28, ?3 ; and Gregory of Tours, History, vi. 5. 6 Augustine, Confessions, x. 23.</page><page sequence="8">193 !] SCHOLASTIC HIERARCHY 217 times when the people felt that they had a right to elect their own saints. Finally there was nature, created?-as not even Augustine 7 and Bernard8 allow us to forget ? to serve as an earthly paradise. And although, as a result of the Fall, it had been transformed into a penitentiary, none the less it still subsisted exclusively in order to serve man's best interests. As Loyola said: And the other things on the face of the earth were created for man's sake and to help him in the following out of the end for which he was created.9 After the Fall, therefore, no less than before it, nature retained a purely extrinsic, anthropocentric significance. Here then was a third hierarchy, and it ran from the beast through insect and plant to the four elements of fire, air, water, and earth.10 The earth and water nourished the grass and crops for cattle and men; the winds not only brought the rain but, according to Scotus, also exercised the trees; 1X in sects fed the birds which man might then eat. Animals12 served man for food, clothing, cultivation of the soil, and transportation; trees gave shade, heat, and materials for houses and other conveniences; crops gave food; minerals gave salt, coal, iron, gold, and so on. And many of these served man's medicinal as well as economic needs: certain animal parts were thought cures for certain diseases, and d?lia Porta prescribed herbs according to their supposed physical resemblance to the diseased organ or member, as pigwort for the glands, pulmonaria for the lungs and hep?tica for the liver.13 Paracelsus, although he revolutionized chem 7 Augustine, The City of God, xxn. chap. 24, especially the last paragraph. 8 Bernard, Life and Works: English edition by S.

All medicines are created for the sake of the sick. . . . Where there are sicknesses there too are the medicines.14 This much of the doctrine was a purely pagan inherit ance; 14a but Christianity had gone much further. It observed that a great deal in nature did not have any obvious economic or medicinal use. Why, then, was it created? Why might it not be as a natural revelation of Christian truths? As the ant warned men of the sin of sloth, as the fly was thought by Luther to exist in order to try men's patience, as to Loyola fresh flowers " recall the blooming of spiritual life," so to Bernard the mountains warned against the aspirations of the haughty and worldly. Animals, too, taught specifically theological truths by symbols ? as did the unicorn, the phoenix, and the elephant. Through these symbols man's recollection of the mysteries of Christian theology was re freshed.15 Such, then, was the hierarchy: eternal truths, the Triune God, with His attributes and His divine agents, then His human agencies such as natural equity, the Pope and Em peror, their agents and the people, and finally animals, vegeta tion, and the four elements. And in the year 1600 this conception was still intact15a ? no longer so vividly convincing as five hundred years earlier, yet solid in its fundamentals even now. We must remember that the Renaissance revived the very Greek mentality which was the metaphysical foundation of the system; and, if the Protestants relied unduly on the Old Testament, the Catholics relied no less on Aristotle.

Long before, Occam had said that bodies moved because carried along by their own momentum; 16 long before, Oresme had said that it was the earth, and not the heavenly spheres, which rotated.17 More recently, Coper nicus had shown that the earth moved not only in rotation but also in an orbit around the sun. In their day, however, the world had paid no attention to these theories; 17a it was only when Galileo championed each one of them and added that the fixed stars, instead of being embedded in the circumfer ence of a sphere, were at every distance from each other and everything else, that the intellectual world began to take notice. The implications of Galileo's allegations were clear: if, as Oresme had said, the earth rotated, the heaven of fixed stars did not and so needed no Mover; and if the planets moved in their orbits and the earth rotated merely because, as must be inferred from Occam, there was no force to stop them, these, too, needed no Mover. Furthermore, if there was no sphere of fixed stars, there was no surface by means of which any of these bodies could be moved, even were there need to move them. Such a conservation of energy once granted, God as an astro-physical force became superfluous.18 And there was a second implication: if, as Copernicus said, the sun and not 16 Qu stiones et decisiones in IV libros sententiarum, n. question 26. 17 Commentary on Aristotle's De C?elo et Mundo.

Galileo thus raised two problems: if the stars and planets do not serve to transmit energy, why were they created; and, if man is the cause of the Creation, why is the sun in the centre? On the heels of this Galilean astro-physics appeared new theological speculations, which hinge, I believe, on the prob lem of evil. Augustine, we must remember, believed the source of evil to be, not matter or evil deities, but man's own fallen soul. But this theory did not long survive the invasions of the barbarians: to a race whose idea of justice was based on the hereditary feud the story of the Fall of man was sure to appeal and so the conviction was sure to arise that evil was due to God's wish to revenge Himself on Adam's descendants. Another view came with the revival of the Neoplatonic and Manichean doctrines, which led men to regard the source of evil as that Matter which God had neither created nor ever entirely subjected to His will. Finally, during the course of the fourteenth century, men grew more friendly to nature and, soon after, with the classical revival, more impressed with the innate nobility of human nature. But if the source of evil was not in God, or even in matter or man's own soul, where could it be? By process of elimination it was concluded that it must be in the Devil. Not that the scope of his activi ties was enlarged, for throughout the Dark and Middle Ages he had been able ? directly or through human allies ? to inflict damage on innocent persons, and more than this was never attributed to him even in the hey-day of the witchcraft epidemic. The difference was that after 1300 the suspicion arose that in doing this he was acting, not as the agent of God, but contrary to His wish and so as His enemy.19 The medi 19 With the beginning of the fourteenth century there appear a good many decrees declaring a belief in the Devil's independent power to be a heresy: S.

This view, which is substantially that of Hobbes, is the traditional and orthodox Catholic view which had been consistently held since Augustine;</page><page sequence="12">i93i] SCHOLASTIC HIERARCHY 221 aeval conception of God had grown out of a Merovingianized Jehovah, still eager to avenge the insult of the Fall. The cruelties to which the Devil subjected man could reasonably be attributed to such a God. But the thirteenth century be gan to emphasize the sacrifice of the Redeemer and the mercy of His Virgin mother, and it thereupon became harder and harder to believe that a God Who harbored such tender feel ings for men could countenance the cruelties which the Devil was still every day inflicting. It seemed impossible that with God the Devil had more influence than had God's only be gotten Son and this Son's mother.20 Yet, if the Devil were not in fact acting by express divine authority, he must be acting in defiance of that authority. And, if this were so, the Devil was in active rebellion ? surreptitiously enticing men into his service to war against that virtue in man for the sake of which God had created him. To this new faith ? noble, and in so many ways enlight this first change was not, therefore, in the view of the Church, but in that of a greatly increasing number of independent-minded individuals. It was only in the fifteenth century that the magician or witch began to be prosecuted and executed, not as a heretic who believed in a power which did not exist, but as an evil-doer who allied himself with a power which did exist. Even then the Church would not recognize that the Devil acted with out God's tacit consent ? the evil done by the Devil and his servants was always declared a just judgment of God ? but the pains taken to demonstrate this, and the nature of the arguments (in contrast to the intellectual vigor of Augustine), make it clear that there was rather a desperate clinging to tra ditional faith than a living conviction: see Malleus Maleficarum, 1489, Pt. 1. questions xn. and xv.; and on Gabriel Biel (1425-1495) see Hansen, Zau berwahn, 267. The dilemma of the Church is well described by Roskoff, Geschichte des Teufels, 11. 214: " In regard to witchcraft the Church acted in consistently, for on the one hand she sought to exterminate the superstition ? that is, she sought to eliminate all recognition of the Devil's power, represent ing it as a nothing; while on the other hand she herself nevertheless recog nized that power, since she felt it necessary to set her own power in opposition to it, lest it should otherwise increase." As in the law of agency, it is all a matter of degree, but when the point is reached where the agent acquires de facto powers so wide that those who seek favors deem it expedient to pay court to the agent rather than to the prin cipal, we can safely say that the agent has independent power. A pertinent analogy would be the power of Richelieu the agent, in contrast to that of the principal, King Louis xm. 20 Roskoff, Geschichte des Teufels, 11. 198, says, " The parallel advance of the cult of the Virgin and the belief in the [power of the] Devil is not to be overlooked, and it is this which explains the fact that both increase from the 13th century onward."</page><page sequence="13">22 2 MASSACHUSETTS HISTORICAL SOCIETY [MAY ened ? the rise of the Inquisition was due, to it was largely due Europe's four hundred years of hideous religious persecu tion, to it we owe the founding ? in the sixteenth century ? of the Jesuit Order ? directed to offer to God the service of all virtuous men in His titanic struggle against the Powers of Darkness. Observe Loyola's injunction: In all conversations by which we hope to win over others and bring them into the net for the greater service of God, Our Lord, let us follow the same course that the enemy follows with regard to a good soul, he all ad malum, we all ad bonum.21 And the early seventeenth-century Bavarian Jesuit, Tanner, explains that the persecution of witches, however deplorable, is necessary " in order to avenge the honor of God, and in order to chastise with just punishment the grievous injury inflicted upon God." 22 Where God's sovereignty, and so His justice, is in jeopardy, how can the end not justify the means? The end was no longer man's salvation ? this was now but a means ? the end was God's triumph over the Devil. A generation after Loyola lived Teresa, she who declared that she loved God equally, whether he chose to damn or to save her. It was chiefly through this Spanish school which worshipped God for His own, and not for man's sake ? spe cifically through Rodriguez and Alvarez23 ? that this " theocentric " worship entered Catholic France, touching three of her greatest men. The first was the famous Savoyard director of souls, Saint Fran?ois de Sales; the second was Cardinal de B?rulle, founder of the French Oratory and the greatest intellectual figure in seventeenth-century France be fore Descartes; the third was the great humanitarian, Saint Vincent de Paul. To what degree these three Frenchmen believed in the ind?pendent power of the Devil is not easy to determine: they were living at the very moment when men were beginning to shrink from the appalling results of the witchcraft persecu 21 Letters and Instructions of St. Ignatius Loyola, English translation by D.

There are two reasons for suspecting this: the first is that whereas the Spanish Jesuits advised try ing to outwit the Devil by paying him back in his own coin ? " let us follow the same course that the enemy follows " ? the Frenchmen believed that a more effective policy was to try to win men from him through the infectious example of charity and love.25 Does this not suggest a new confidence in God's power to protect the truly innocent and virtuous? The second reason for our suspicion is that B?rulle laid a very special emphasis on God's greatness ; yet, manifestly, so long as God was thought incapable of protecting innocence against the as saults of the Devil, He could not be regarded as supremely great. The familiarity with which Fran?ois de Sales was in clined to treat God shocked B?rulle.26 If one believed God to be more virtuous and merciful than mighty, familiarity was perhaps natural ? man and God were in that case comrades in-arms as are the soldier and the general.27 But, if God were alone mighty, and, through His complete ascendency over the Devil, alone the source and cause of all the cruelties and hor rors of this world, it was just as well to treat Him rather with distant, if still loving, awe. This may well be the key to B?rulle's doctrine of God's greatness: a repudiation of that dualism which had pervaded Catholic thought for four hun dred years, a demand that the prestige of God, undermined by an exaggerated idea of His benevolence, be rehabilitated.28 We can well imagine B?rulle's excitement when, in the midst of his meditations on the forgotten greatness of God, he suddenly came upon an account of the Copernican theory. Here is what he says of it: Nicholas Copernicus has maintained that the sun, and not the earth, is at the centre of the universe; that this sun is immobile, 24 Especially by Adam Tanner (1572-1632): Riezler, Geschichte der Hexenprozesse, 249. 25 Especially Vincent de Paul: Bremond, Sentiment religieux, ni. 237-239 and 245. 26 Bremond, Sentiment religieux, m. 33-37. 27 Ibid., 62, on Loyola. 28 M.

This new theory, little regarded by the science of the stars, is useful and should be heeded by the science of salva tion.29 What more appropriate symbol indeed, even to the newness of its revelation, than that of the sun,30 representing God, at the centre, with the earth ever circling around it, reverentially and at a discreet distance? Of no less importance to us is B?rulle's conception not only of God's greatness but of His unity.31 He alone is to be wor shipped ? all else, except in so far as it is somehow a part of Him, is as a nothing.32 What significance, then, is to be given to the saints? B?rulle urges their suppression as independent objects of worship since God is but One. To him the saints, and even the Virgin, are divinely real only in so far as they are expressions or manifestations of Him. " Speaking to you, Mary, we are speaking of Jesus." 33 Even Jesus he chooses to contemplate as the God of the Trinity rather than as the incarnated Redeemer of man.34 That God should be wor shipped in His human guise was not consonant with His transcendent majesty; that He should have chosen actually to suffer the agonies of the Passion for man's sake seemed to B?rulle a mystery to be passed over as lightly as was seemly. This assault on the saints, once started by B?rulle, con tinued unabated for another generation. In Belgium van Helmont declared that the cures supposedly effected by their relics were actually effected by natural magnetism,35 and there Bolland began the first systematic separation of the legendary from the historical saint in that first volume of the Acta Sanctorum, published in 1643.36 Bourgoing and Eudes37 29 Bremond, Sentiment religieux, in. 24. 30 Gilson, Descartes, 166-169. 31 Gilson, Descartes, 174; Bremond, Sentiment religieux, in. chap. 2. 32 Bremond, Sentiment religieux, m. 93-95.

Three of his notable disciples: Condren, Gibieuf, and Descartes, each now pressed the assault on the divine hierarchy from a different point. The first was Condren, despiser of the Devil. Notice the language of one of his prayers: "Oh Lord, leave me rather in the clutches of the evil spirit to be tortured, and abandon me rather to his will than to my own. He will do no more than punish me and execute Your justice."40 If the Devil can do no more than execute the judgments of God, if his power is purely contin gent on our misguided belief in it, he is then not to be feared but only to be despised. That this view expressed by Condren is not mere pious repetition of a traditional axiom of belief, is indicated by the constant trouble he took to reiterate and emphasize this point. Why should he keep repeating: the Devil has no power to act except as God wills that he shall, unless many even pious persons believed the contrary? And why were witches still being executed if the magical powers they wielded were be lieved to be expressly granted by God? Nor is Condren's emphasis an isolated case. On the con trary, it was precisely in these sixteen-thirties that the voice of enlightened Christendom first cried out in concert against the mad belief in witchcraft.41 Among the influential protests 38 Quoted in Kirchenlexikon, vu. 1514-1517. 39 Bremond, Sentiment religieux, ni. 506. 40 Quoted in Bremond, Sentiment religieux, m. 316; and see also 315. 41 Earlier allegations that witchcraft was a delusion were made by Johann Weyer or Wier (1516-1588) and Cornelius Loos (1546-1595), Allgemeine</page><page sequence="17">226 MASSACHUSETTS HISTORICAL SOCIETY [MAY were, in England, that of Hobbes,42 in Germany that of von Spee,43 in France, shortly after Condren, those of Gassendi44 and Gabriel Naud?.45 Law naturally moved more sluggishly, and condemnations occurred for another generation.46 Among ignorant people and in backward communities the belief lasted even longer.47 But from now on it was, as an intelligent opinion, dead.48 The second of B?rulle's notable disciples was Gibieuf ,49 who declared that God no more ruled the universe as does a King than He eats like a King. God is, after all, a God, and there fore to suppose Him an overworked and harassed ruler, striv ing by an agile use of a miscellany of agencies and bodies to keep the universe steadily on the course He has laid out for it, is unimaginatively to suppose Him a mere superman. Prompted by the implications of the new theory of physics, Gibieuf suggested that God was not, in the human sense, striving for any end, but had, on the contrary, so de vised things that they must, inevitably, by their own inherent natures, themselves proceed unerringly toward their end.50 For the same reason, then, that B?rulle and his successors belittled the power of the saints and the Devil, Gibieuf dis Deutsche Biographie (1893), article on "Spee"; and by Jean Uvier (ca. 1530-?) and Reginald Scott (ca. 1538-1590), Encyclopaedia Britannica (nth Ed.), "Witchcraft," 757c.

It was, therefore, not only because of the complications created by the discov eries of the telescope, but also because of the doctrines of B?rulle, Condren and Gibieuf, that the power of the stars was now relegated, with that of the saints and demons, to the limbo of superstition. When, in the course of the thirteenth century, astrology had again fired the imagination of Europeans, it was believed that man could himself learn to read the future in the stars. Not only, however, did the astrologers' prophecies soon raise doubts, the worst of it was that they could not even give good reasons for their bad prophecies. By many their failure was attributed to the loss of understanding resulting from the Fall.51 Since it is only with reluctance, however, that men will abandon the hope of reading the future, and since it then still seemed clear that the earth's energy was transmitted from the stars, there remained the practical question of devising some method by which the nature of this influence could be diag nosed and so utilized. It was soon after this, in the early fourteenth century, that men began to attribute independent powers to the Devil. Now theology had always taught that, although the Devil had no more access to divine knowledge than had man, he was, because of his longer experience and greater cleverness, infinitely skilful in all natural knowledge. In that case it was more than likely that he had mastered the intricate science of the stars. But how was a decent person to get this knowledge without himself compacting with the Devil? This was very simply arranged: he consulted a physician or astrologer who, in turn, consulted the Devil. The client was told, of course, that the physician or astrologer himself read the stars, but he knew better, and they knew that he would never have consulted them had he not expected them to get their information from the Devil.52 But now, just as the Devil was falling into discredit, Gibieuf further embar rassed the situation by suggesting, on the strength of the new astro-physics, that God governed by no such clumsy physical 61 As by Ronsard and Shakespere: Franz Boll, Sternglaube und Stern deutung (Leipzig und Berlin, 1919), 48-49. 52 See Bayle's Dictionnaire, " Ruggieri," note D.</page><page sequence="19">2 28 MASSACHUSETTS HISTORICAL SOCIETY [MAY methods. This raised the awkward question of whether there was in fact any science of the stars for the Devil or any one else to master. If not, the Devil could not thereby learn the future, and in that case he was quite as much of a hoax as any physician or astrologer.53 Condren had been entirely right to say that he deserved only contempt. By this alliance of theology with physics, astrology was now cornered. It had been the general faith of the earlier generation ? of Galileo 54 and Kepler, and, more recently, of Fludd, Wallenstein, Morin,55 and Vanini. Just after them came the Franciscan, Mersenne, who, in a hopeless way, asks how, since God created the sun in order to give man heat and light, it can seriously be asserted that God did not create the stars and planets for some analogous purpose.56 His question was not answered, but faith in astrology none the less now quickly collapsed. Already in 1628 a law had been passed forbidding " the insertion in almanacs of all predictions ex cept those relating to the weather, to phases of the moon and to eclipses, on the . . . ground that whatever exceeds these limits is uncertain." 57 And at the birth of Louis xiv, in 1638, Morin was secretly summoned to be present in order to be able to cast the horoscope with proper accuracy, yet was hidden that his presence might not be generally known.58 It was at just this time that Gassendi wrote his important work against astrology,59 and that Descartes soon added the weight of his support.60 Within a decade thereafter it was to the cultivated Frenchman already a matter of ignorant superstition.61 53 See, on this relation, Malleus Maleficarum, 1489, Pt. 1. question 5. 54 Franz Boll, Sternglaube, 51. 55 F. Boquet, Histoire de l'Astronomie (Paris, 1925), 331.

Boquet, Histoire de l'Astronomie (Paris, 1925), 403.</page><page sequence="20">193!] SCHOLASTIC HIERARCHY 229 And it was Gassendi who also took the next logical step. Galileo had demonstrated that heavenly bodies could conserve their energy, but he had not properly shown how other energy maintained itself. Yet this also had to be explained before it could be clear that no influences were being showered down from the heavens. Gassendi does this by supposing that matter is composed of atoms each of which is endowed by God with an innate energy. When a composite body is at rest, this is only because its atoms are consuming their energy in bang ing against each other. It is this agitation which causes the sensation of heat, which causes the sensation of light as com municated from the sun, which causes the phenomenon of falling bodies.62 Such a theory was dangerously close to materialism,63 and yet, if men were to reject astrology and so God's infusions of physical energy, the alternative was to accept, not only the inertia doctrine of Galileo, but also this innate agitation doctrine of Gassendi. Yet, suppose the whole were adopted, might it not be all too plausibly alleged that the universe was ruled rather by the laws of physics than by the laws of God? The ground was now cleared for the third and greatest of B?rulle's disciples, Ren? Descartes. Trained first in science, then by Gibieuf and the B?rullian school, Descartes soon found himself confronted by a fundamental dilemma, and he determined to devote his life to its solution. Whether the greatness of God or the reliability of exact science was his deepest conviction, has been a matter of learned argument. Could he himself have answered that question? How, indeed, may a new philosophy more properly start than on the foundation of two equally deep convictions? We have already explained that one of the most uncontro verted of scholastic doctrines was that which assumed the existence of certain eternal truths whose nature God had not created. He had actualized these truths, but in doing so He had had to create them exactly as they already potentially were by nature. And even Scotus had agreed that God could not, even after this creation, change their nature.64 But if, 62 E. Gerland, Geschichte der Physik (M?nchen und Berlin, 1913), 462 465. 63 This has been described as the age of the philosophical libertines: H. S?e, Id?es politiques, 338-339. 64 And Suarez: Gilson, Descartes, 50-55.</page><page sequence="21">230 MASSACHUSETTS HISTORICAL SOCIETY [May thought Descartes, this were really true, it follows that God is not omnipotent, and, if not omnipotent, where shall we say that His potency begins? If matter, for instance, was already a potentiality before the Creation, and if God was in fact unable to endow any one of its elements, as fire, with intelli gence or will, can we logically say that God created these recently discovered laws of motion and of heat, and if He did not, how can we be sure that events are proceeding so pre cisely as He wishes them to? Only so long as He was thought of as the sole and immediate source of physical energy, was it reasonable to believe this. But according to the new astro physics, He might conceivably have started the universe and yet now be no longer able to control it. As a matter of logic, indeed, there was now no physical proof that God at the present time any longer existed.65 Descartes' momentous solution ? that God is Himself the Creator of each and all the eternal truths ? was thus wrung from him by an acute pressure. It is only because God of His majestic free will chose it to be so that two contradictory things are not both true, that 2 and 2 equal 4, that the angles of any triangle are equal to' two right angles.66 Only because of His free will is there matter and space; 67 only because of it do the virtues of the saints merit an eternal reward.68 God is the cause and creator of every order, law, and essence of truth and goodness.69 By this theory, too, the Unity of God, a conception so dear to B?rulle, is metaphysically explained: God does not need the anthropomorphic attributes of understanding and will about whose precedence Aquinas and Scotus so elaborately disputed,70 for His only understanding can be of His will.71 A final difficulty remained to be solved: 72 if God's free will was so complete, why might He not at any time change the 65 See Gabriel Maugain, ?tude sur l'?volution intellectuelle de l'Italie de 1657 ? 1750 environ (Paris, 1909), 158. 66 Gilson, Descartes, 14, 23, 29, and 32. 67 Ibid., 22. 68 Ibid., 29. 69 Ibid., 30. 70 Ibid., 130-136 and 147. 71 Ibid., 55-57. This is comparable to Plotinus: Whittaker, The Neo Platonists, 60. 72 That of Scotus and Suarez.</page><page sequence="22">1931] SCHOLASTIC HIERARCHY 231 truth by changing His mind? To this Descartes answers that since this involves imperfection and God is perfection, there is this single limitation on His free will ? He can not change his mind because He can not change the perfection of His own nature.73 Thus, through the genius of Descartes, the great ness of God grew from a relatively obscure devotional con ception into a complete philosophical and even scientific demonstration. And the history of seventeenth-century absolutism has other ramifications: as to B?rulle in philosophy must be added Gibieuf and Descartes, so to B?rulle in theology must be added, not only his disciples, such as Condren and Olier, but also the beginnings of the Augustinian revival ? with Saint Cyran and Jansenius. Nor may another manifestation be overlooked: if God is omnipotent and to be worshipped for His own sake because sovereign over truth as well as over man and nature, it was the more natural to conceive, as did Richelieu, that the king was to be venerated for his own sake because sovereign over law and justice as well as over the people.74 It was not only God, indeed, Who was now being unshackled from His hoary scholastic impediments: the king was to be unshackled too ? from his hoary feudal impediments. But observe ? as did Richelieu ? this corollary: being perfect, God could not change the nature of the very truth He had, according to Descartes, Himself created, but the king, being imperfect, was virtually under the necessity of seeking to perfect the nature of the State. To the political theorists of the Middle Ages, the State was founded on certain definite principles of equity; on these principles ?their fundamental law of inalienable rights75 ? the existence of the State de pended, and neither king nor States-General had the power to abrogate or amend them. But, just as Descartes had declared that eternal truth was the free creation of God, so Richelieu declared that even the fundamental laws of the State were the free creation of the king. 73 Gilson, Descartes, 15, 24, 51, and 55~?56. 74 H.

It would be interesting to know whether, while the great Cardinal B?rulle and the great philosopher Descartes were so absorbed in championing the omnipotence of God, either of them was at all struck by the coincidence that another great Cardinal, Richelieu, was just then no less absorbed in cham pioning the omnipotence of the king. in THE FALL OF MAN Until 1660, man had been able to retain a good deal of optimism about himself: he had free will, noble intentions, self-control, and, through reason and experience, a solid com prehension of truth. These comfortable illusions were now to be destroyed by the collaboration of pious Jansenists and sceptical nobles. In the sixteen-fifties M?r? had expounded the philosophy of the Pr?cieux, which identified social charm with virtue,76 and Corneille had dramatized the philosophy of the warrior nobility, which identified personal honor with virtue. These doctrines the Jansenist Arnauld exposed to ridicule, showing that charm merely inclines others to treat you as if they thought you virtuous and so enables you to think yourself so, and showing that personal honor is based on man's hope that if he can delude others into admiring him, they may be able to delude him into admiring himself. Of captains he says that only the prospect of unusual reward and honor " diverts them from the considerations of danger and death."77 The earlier seventeenth century was also the hey-day of 76 See Edmond Chamaillard, Ed., Le Chevalier de M?r? (Niort, 1921), 132-140. 77 Logique de Port Royal, 1. chaps. 9 and 10.</page><page sequence="24">i93i] SCHOLASTIC HIERARCHY 233 the Jesuit casuists,78 who argued that a man sinned only if he did evil with calculated intent.79 But to say that a man did no wrong so long as he did not think he was doing any, was to set a premium on self-ignorance. No less than Corneille, the Jesuit was generous and romantic. The courtier-noble, La Rochefoucauld, however, was neither: " The acts of men which the world regards as virtues are very often merely their image and likeness."80 The virtue we call constancy is likely, he says, to be the vice of dejection, resolution to be stupor,81 pity to be foresight of our own fragile predicament.82 And he observes that even " solemnity is a mystery of the body in vented in order to hide the defects of the mind." 83 This is not hypocrisy but self-deception: there are, for instance, but a very few men who have not managed to persuade themselves that they do not fear death.84 Another courtier-noble, Saint Evremont, says that men who despise preferment at court do so for fear that it might otherwise despise them. He therefore adds that it is " not strange for a man of honor to despise the court, . . . but . . . ridiculous of him to take pride in de spising it." 85 And with Cardinal de Retz this fear of self deception approaches a mania: There is nothing so subject to delusion as piety. All sorts of errors creep in and hide themselves under that veil ; it gives a sanction to every kind of fancy; and the most honest intention is insufficient to guard against its vagaries.86 On being appointed Archbishop of Paris, he therefore decides that he will at all costs avoid " the most dangerous absurdity to which our profession is liable: the jumbling together of sin and devotion."87 In his eagerness to achieve the newly revived Augustinian virtue of learning the full extent of his own depravity, he chooses to shun all the other virtues ? lest 78 E.g., Laymann (1575-), Petau (1583-), Escobar (1589-), Diana (i595-)&gt; Busembaum (1600-). 79 H.

From this time forward, therefore, until the rise of the fatuous Encyclopaedists, there could no more be a non Augustinian ethics than a non-Euclidean geometry: 88 Jesuit ethics was under chronic papal fire from 1655 to 1690,89 and in 1676 the Essays of Montaigne were put on the Index90 ? the crime of both was that of harboring a weakness for human weakness. The first generation of psychologists had demonstrated that man was as hopelessly the slave of his self-love as was any beast ? there was no indication that man's will, at any rate, had ever been especially created in the image of God. The second generation was next to demonstrate that neither did man's understanding seem to be so created; that even the definition of man as a rational animal ? which Aquinas had taken from Aristotle?had no more solid basis than vanity. Descartes had, shortly before, been so impressed by the con trast between the human and the bestial mind that he declared beasts to be mere automatons or machines ? superior to clocks only as God was superior to man.91 To the new gen eration of the sixteen-sixties this was bound to seem prepos terous. One of the earlier rejoinders was that of Cyrano de Bergerac. Describing an imaginary community of birds, he reports that there the average bird . . . believed that it was shocking to suppose that a beast [such as man was] who did not have a face like theirs could be endowed with reason.

Do these latter not think from their earliest years? One may think then, though not conscious of oneself.93 Could it not still be maintained, however, that the intelli gence of the beast is nevertheless fundamentally different because only man's understanding is rational enough to realize that the universe is subject to a divine Providence? But this Pascal denies, if by it is meant that man's reason has ever enabled him to recognize what the divine virtue is: " Stealing, incest, the murder of children and of fathers, all these have at some time been regarded as virtuous acts." 94 And Nicole goes on to show that man's understanding is quite incapable of distinguishing which acts of man are dictated by the bestial instinct of self-love and which by the divine guidance of grace. Since man's happiness depends on the admiration of others, his life will tend to be exclusively devoted to acquiring a reputation for virtue. Consequently, Although there is nothing so in contrast to charity, which is directed only towards God, as self-love, which is directed wholly towards itself, nevertheless there is nothing so closely resembling the effects of charity as the effects of self-love; they follow indeed so identical a course that there is hardly a better way of learning the route which charity should take than to learn the route taken by an enlightened self-love which knows where lie its true interests and is proceeding rationally towards the end it seeks.95 Man is, therefore, unable to tell whether another's ? or even his own ? desires and behavior are dictated by the beast or the God in him.96 93 Fables, Book x.

Why should Pascal not see what had been so obvious to men far less intelligent than he? Galileo's and Gassendi's as tronomy and physics was, of course, one reason. But there was another: the new facts recently made known through the microscope and through exploration. The argument suggested by the microscope was chiefly psychological. Revelation's statement that man was created in God's image was, of course, to be taken to refer to man's soul only, not to his body. Nevertheless, at least since the Renaissance, man's body was much admired. The elaborate structure and mechanics of this body seemed to be peculiarly designed to serve the noble soul which it encased.97a It was perplexing enough to learn that man seemed to behave with this soul almost as do the animals without it, but to this per plexity was now added the discovery of the naturalists that man's body, too, as well as his will and understanding, differed from that of other organic things only in degree.97b One of the first to feel this close resemblance was the Italian, Malpighi. In undertaking the study of the essence of life, he says that he first concentrated on the structure of the higher animals: But since this branch of study, clouded as it is in very particular darkness, still remains in complete obscurity, it requires a compari son with simpler phenomena, and it was in this way that I was attracted to an investigation of insects; finally, since even these offered difficulties, I have now come to the study of plants. . . . 97 uvres, xm. 138.

" Yet perhaps even this is not enough, for the kingdom of minerals and elements ought to come first of all." 98 In the course of these new microscopic investigations, of his and of many others between 1676 and 1690, it became apparent that not only the higher beasts, but even insects and plants, were physiologically extraordinarily like man. To a far greater degree than was the case even ten years earlier they became convinced that these multifarious organisms breathed,99 ate,100 digested,1 excreted,2 and copulated,3 substantially as did human bodies. In many there seemed to be a circulation of something analogous to blood4 and even a nervous system like man's.5 And nervous systems could hardly serve any other purpose than in order to register pleasure and pain.6 By 1690, then, the evidence rather clearly showed men that they differed from beasts neither in virtue, understanding, nor body. And, in ruminating on the acuteness of their per plexity, we must not forget that for the last four hundred years every one of education had known that Aristotle thought man to be simply the final and most successful productive effort of nature.7 98 Anatomes Plantarum Idea, introductory paragraph (written 1671). 99 Swammerdam in L.

Was not this basis of differentiation still a valid one? The best evidence in proof of this hypothesis had always been the remarkable number of things in nature which served man's economic wants. How could a cow's usefulness to herself possibly compare with her usefulness to man? The cow was just as useful to the Frenchman of 1680 as she ever had been to Greek or early Christian, but that usefulness became less and less convincing an argument as the micro scope and exploration revealed more and more thousands of species ? animal, vegetable, and mineral ? almost none of which, apparently, was of the slightest economic use. But might not many of them have been created for therapeutic purposes? The physicians answered that they only wished they could honestly say so. Paracelsus, as we have men tioned,8 believed all nature to be an apothecary; so, appar ently, did d?lia Porta9 and B hme.10 Even now there were still reputable physicians who trusted in this teleological view of nature. Speaking of woodbine, the English physician, Nicholas Culpeper, who was born in 1614, remarks: "Well, then, if it is not good for this, what is it good for? It is good for something, for God and nature made nothing in vain." 13- And Culpeper therefore still clings to the theory of signatures, inferring that heart trefoil strengthens the heart " not only because the leaf is triangular, like the heart of man, but also because each leaf contains the perfect icon of a heart, and that in its proper colour, viz. a flesh colour." 12 But the really distinguished physicians of this time were no longer relying on any such theoretical principles. Sydenham, who was eleven years younger than Culpeper, shocked the English medical world by depending on empirical methods,13 and the 8 See quotation, supra, pages 217-218. 9 C. G. Cumston, History of Medicine, 267 and 314. 10 But Bcehme does not desire ? so far as I can see ? to get beyond the philosophical principles. 1X The English Physician (1770 Ed.), 356. 12 Ibid., 341. 13 Encyclopaedia Britannica (nth Ed.), " Sydenham."</page><page sequence="30">i93i] SCHOLASTIC HIERARCHY 239 Dutch-German, Sylvius, just of Culpeper's age, was one of the first to react against the traditional theory that the human organism is specifically designed in order to combat each pos sible disease.14 Thus neither relied at all on the age-long theory of an artificial synchronism between the human body and outer nature. Nowhere, to them, were there ready made, accessible therapeutic tools; there were, at best, only the raw materials out of which man's wits might, or might not, be able to fashion these tools.15 The third and fourth purely human uses for which nature had supposedly been designed ? in order to teach moral and dogmatic doctrines by resemblances and symbols ? were by 1680 no longer receiving much serious attention. The Phy siologus stories or Bestiaries, in which this lore was chiefly collected, had not survived the sarcasm of the humanists. Yet even now there were still whimsical traces of the old tradi tion. The Italian humanist, Magalotti, for instance, having learned on what seemed to him impeccable authority that the unicorn had been recently seen in Africa, makes this bewil dered observation: Thus the most famous and perhaps the noblest and finest of all animals serves as an amusement, as a convenience, and even per haps as a gift, to the most barbarous and savage of men.16 14 Max Neuburger, Die Lehre von der Heilkraft der Natur (Stuttgart, 1926), 46-47. 15 Historians of medicine may here be reminded that the indirect or nega tive help given to that science not only by Galileo, van Helmont, Gassendi, Descartes, etc., but also by the B?rullian and Jansenist theologians, may be quite as significant and influential as the direct and positive help given by Harvey, Sylvius, Sydenham, etc. At least for the history of pathology and therapeutics three developments of the middle seventeenth century are of capital importance: 1. The discovery that nature has not been endowed with therapeutic sig natures. 2. The discovery that the stars and so the horoscope are no indication of the condition of a patient's health ? past, present, or future. 3. The discovery that God, rather than the Devil, is the cause of disease. It was not easy to believe that God specifically inflicted painful diseases on apparently worthy and upright persons, and He, as well as the Devil, was therefore soon dismissed as the immediate and decisive cause. Thus for the first time was a theological basis outlined for a belief in intermediate natural causes of disease. Until that time any systematic, widespread search for natural causes was not to be expected. 16 Lorenzo Magalotti, Relazione di Cose esotiche: Dell'Uccello di Para diso, del Pellicano e dell'Unicorno.</page><page sequence="31">240 MASSACHUSETTS HISTORICAL SOCIETY [MAY Here is the unicorn, for centuries the acknowledged and familiar symbol of Christ,17 relegated to the interior of Africa! Yet the unicorn was but one of many thousand species which seemed to serve no conceivable human end. Of what possible use, for instance, were those worms that live in the stomachs of horses? Malpighi thus describes them: In these worms the two openings of the air-vessels, as we shall in due course show, are close to the anus, and these air-vessels follow the length of the flanks, proceeding towards the head and sending branches to the right and to the left to spread among the viscera. In the case of these animals, therefore, which live sub merged in fluids, nature seems to have arranged that, for their breathing, they should have few orifices, and these so specially situated that they may be able to breathe the air at the most op portune time and place.18 Here was an obscure and only recently studied creature whose organism is designed with a skill vying with any of the most admirable of God's works, and yet all this design seems as perfectly suited to facilitate its own prosperity and survival as it seems unsuited to affect the horse ? not to speak of man ? in any way, for either better or worse. What right then has man to assume that nature was created only for his sake? Suppose that by some chance the poor beasts were created rather for their own than for man's sake? Observe the attitude taken in an anonymous article of 1684, as paraphrased and probably somewhat embellished by Bayle: The soul of the beasts has not sinned and yet is liable to suffering and misery; it is made the slave of all the ungovernable desires of the creature which has sinned. How do we treat the beasts? We make them maul each other for our entertainment; we cut their throats in order to feed ourselves; while they are still alive we rummage about in their entrails in order to satisfy our curiosity, and we do all this by virtue of the sovereignty which God has given us over the beasts. How illogical that the innocent creature be the victim of every caprice of the criminal creature! There is not a casuist who believes that one sins in setting dogs on bulls, and in resorting to a thousand ruses and violences in hunting and in fishing in order to destroy animals. ... Is there not cruelty and injustice 17 Rose, Ed., The Epic of the Beast, 199. 18 De Bombyce, last paragraph.</page><page sequence="32">1931 ] SCHOLASTIC HIERARCHY 24I in subjecting the innocent soul to so many miseries? We are freed from all these difficulties through the doctrine of Mr. Descartes.19 But if nature was not created for man, was there any valid reason for regarding it as a hierarchy? If the beast was not created in order to serve man, neither was the wind created in order to exercise the trees nor the insect in order to feed the birds.20 v THE FALL OF GOD By 1690, then, man seemed to be in the very jaws of na ture.21 One of the first to perceive this clearly had been Pascal, whose despairing cry to God for His help lest man be wholly a beast, has echoed down the ages. Only the Redemp tion stood between man and matter; 22 only because Christ loomed above this nature, could Pascal have faith. To him the least unconvincing natural proof of God was size ? the minuteness revealed by the microscope and the hugeness re vealed by the telescope. Descartes' opportune assurance that God had created everything, including terrifying space, was consoling.23 But wait a moment. The scholastics had always been careful to differentiate God from nature ? it was be cause of His power to divert or suspend its operations that man trusted to Him in times of disaster?of plague, earth quake, flood, drought, and invasion. But Descartes' God was a new God, Who, being the creator as well as the ruler of nature, was not so easily differentiated from it.24 Scotus and 19 Bayle, Dictionnaire, article on " Rorarius," note C ; see also L. C. Miall, History of Biology (New York and London, 1911), 48. 20 According to modern Catholic doctrine, the beast, having been created for the exclusive sake of man, suffers the fate of his master. Before the Fall he shared with man a life where there was only pleasure; in consequence of the Fall the beast shared in the punishment and was therefore doomed to a life in which pain predominates. Thus, to the Church, the beast's predicament is like that of man in the eye of an unbeliever: though personally innocent of sin, he is doomed to great suffering and imminent annihilation by death. His is an unmoral world, without virtue or sin, and without rewards or punishments, present or future. 21 F. T.

Thus the laws of nature were God, as perfect and unchangeable as He was. From this premise it was only a step to infer that, since human nature was a part of nature, this, too, was in a sense divine. The doctrine of Nicole ? that enlightened self interest was man's best criterion of what might be the effects of divine grace ? was an ominous premonition. Soon after, Bourdaloue declared that there is not a divine mystery which transcends ordinary human comprehension.25 Finally to Malebranche,26 Leibnitz,27 and Bayle,28 man's reason ? that is, his logic and mathematics ? offers a reliable criterion of what these eternal truths in fact are, and man's conscience, or natural intuition of justice, offers a reliable criterion of what must be God's justice. The biblical Revelation thus became a superfluous corroboration of what man could find out by natural means. Spinoza had said, rather bluntly, what thousands were feel ing and not saying: if nature is God, let us trust her, let us submit ourselves to her wishes. Man is henceforth to be saved by following her divine dictates. This is the beginning of laissez faire, not only in ethics and science, but also in economics with Boisguilbert29 and in education with F?nelon.30 Such, then, by the end of the century, was the sad plight of religion. Because to the men of the seventeenth century God was inseparable from the traditional hierarchy, its collapse 25 Bremond, Sentiment religieux, vm. 319-327. 26 D?sir?

It was the penalty paid for an im pure, anthropomorphic conception of Him. That there may be something higher than nature, higher than man, and that the least inarticulate description of that something is to be found in the Bible and the great commentaries inspired by it, was just as obvious in 1700 as it is to-day. It is only with difficulty, however, that man can live by faith alone ? he is therefore ever tempted to clothe that faith with concrete ac cessories. But these are man-made and so ephemeral, go rotten in course of time, and, in rotting, give man the mo mentary illusion that the faith has rotted too. VI THE FALL OF THE KING Richelieu and his successors had reduced the human hier archy from feudal multiplicity to the simple duality of ruler and subjects. Just as the simplification of the divine hier archy facilitated the fall of God, so Richelieu's doctrine facilitated the fall of the king.81 So long as the old God sur vived, there was still a major hierarchy to support this minor, human one, but, with God precipitated into nature, the only valid claim of the kingship could now be that it was natural. But this was perhaps the one argument that could not be made, since it had long been the favorite argument of the monarchists that God had instituted kings for the exclusive and specific purpose of controlling and suppressing the social disorder towards which our fallen nature tended. Bossuet had repeatedly said that revolution was the order of that nature; 82 Locke and the Protestant refugees, Jurieu33 and Levassor,84 needed only to take him at his word in order to proclaim that, whenever natural man felt impelled to revolu tion, it was just that such a revolution take place.

The first categorical denial of hereditary monarchy seems to have been that of Boulainvilliers; 35 with this dec laration our story of intellectual evolution ends: the razing of every sub-hierarchy and hierarchy is at last complete, and not only God and man, but even the king, appear as merely so many manifestations of a single almighty, all-inclusive nature. To the outward eye, and to the average man, God, with His saints and devils, and the king, with his ministers and nobles, lived on, but in the flesh only, not in the spirit. The great minds had for the time being moved on. In 1789 was merely practised what had already been preached under Louis xiv. Mr. Frank Washburn Grinnell read a paper on Glimpses of the Life of Benjamin Robbins Curtis Benjamin R. Curtis was born in Watertown, Massachu setts, in 1809, the son of a sea captain who died early, leaving him and his brother, George Ticknor Curtis, to be brought up by a devoted mother with very little property. He graduated from Harvard in the Class of 1829 and was one of the first students in the reorganized Harvard Law School under Judge Story and John Hooker Ashmun. After about a year and a half of study there, he fell in love with Eliza Maria Woodward, the daughter of the defendant-in-error in the Dartmouth College case, and, in order to secure an income, left the school to take over the practice of General Ne vers, an old lawyer with a collection practice in Northfield, Massa chusetts, who was appointed Sheriff of Franklin County. Curtis remained three years in Northfield where he satu rated himself with law reading in his spare time, and then moved to Boston where he became associated with Mr. Charles P. Curtis and began his rapid rise at the bar. His practice was varied, and his unusual versatility in grasp ing every kind of question presented was compared in those 35 H. S?e, Id?es politiques, 276.

In 1836, he appeared before Chief Justice Shaw and the full bench of the Supreme Judicial Court in a slave casex in support of a proposition similar to that which he himself an swered later from the Federal bench in his dissenting opinion in the case of Dred Scott.2 In 1851 he was made chairman of the Commissioners appointed in accordance with legislative resolve " to revise and reform the proceedings in the courts of justice " in the Commonwealth, and was elected to the legis lature of that year to put through their recommendations. While there, he drew up the public address to the people, signed by one hundred and sixty-seven members of the legis lature, denouncing what he described as the " corrupt bar gain " of the coalition between the Free Soilers and the Democrats which made George S. Boutwell governor and sent Charles Sumner, the unspecified Free Soiler in the " bargain," to the Senate.3 On September 4, 1851, a vacancy occurred in the Supreme Court of the United States, and on September 10, President Fillmore and Daniel Webster each sent to the other, in letters which crossed each other, the suggestion of Curtis, then forty two years old, for the place. Although demonstrating from the first his exceptional judicial and juristic qualities, it was his dissenting opinion in the Dred Scott case which electrified the country. Almost by itself it steadied Northern sentiment and checked the tide of popular disrespect which threatened the authority of the court as a result of Chief Justice Taney's unfortunate opinion. In that dissent he provided a legal foundation on which the more temperate men of the North could join the Republican Party and support Lincoln. In that same year he resigned, mainly because the salary was not sufficient to enable him to live in Washington and support and educate his family. After his resignation he re turned to active practice, which he continued until his death in 1874. 1 Commonwealth vs. Aves, 18 Pickering, 193. 2 Scott vs. Sandford, 19 12W. 393. 3 See Memoir of Benjamin Robbins Curtis (Benjamin R.

Some of the things said about him by men of distinction are arresting. For instance, Mr. Justice Miller, of the Supreme Court of the United States, in an address before the Iowa Bar described Curtis's place in his profession in these words: In this sense I pronounce Benjamin R. Curtis the first lawyer of America, of the past or present time. I do not speak of him as an advocate, alone or specially, nor as a counsellor ; I speak of him as a lawyer in full practice in all the courts of the country, as en gaged in a practice which embraced a greater variety of questions of law and of fact than is often to be found in one man's experience.4 This is strong language, not of local pride, but from a dis tant state at a time when large offices and stenographers and telephones and all the present helps of modern business were unknown. Sydney Bartlett said of Curtis: " In his favorite science he had among us no superior and but few equals "; and Webster said: " In clearness, he has probably never been surpassed at the bar." If one reads enough (and it does not require much) about the critical period between 1865 and 1868, to visualize the dramatic crisis with which the Federal Government was faced in 1868, and then reads the answer to the impeachment charges which was prepared for the President by Curtis, working, it is said, for thirty consecutive hours without rest or sleep, the force of Webster's remark appears. That impeachment trial was a veritable Thermopylae for the government of the United States with the pass held by Curtis supported by his four associated counsel, twelve Demo cratic and seven Republican senators, twenty-two men in all. Against them was a horde of inflamed, vindictive people, led on by earnest but self-righteous, fanatical graspers for power like Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner, aided by Ben Butler, Boutwell, Henry Wilson (all but Stevens from Massa chusetts), and others, all of whom persuaded themselves, or professed to believe, that the entire sovereignty of the United 4 American Law Review, May, 1880.</page><page sequence="38">I931] BENJAMIN ROBBINS CURTIS 247 States was in Congress. There was an unholy alliance of pro fessed saints and political sinners, with the presidential as pirations of Ben Wade of Ohio, the presiding officer of the Senate, in the immediate background, and with New England leading the way (for Stevens was born in Vermont). As Gar field, then in Congress, characterised the situation, many per sons in Washington were doing extravagant things to prove themselves radicals; he was trying " . . . to be a radical with out being a fool," by the looks of things "no small diffi culty." 5 Andrew Johnson was a great figure, but in a sense an in cidental one in that struggle for power, for it is evident that the same tactics would have been used against Lincoln if he had lived. The real issue involved was whether the inde pendence of the executive office would survive the attempted usurpation of its powers by a headstrong Congress. Johnson refused to yield the powers which he believed had been en trusted to him by the Constitution, and Curtis defended his position. In 1926, the issue was raised in a judicial proceed ing for the first time since 1789, and the Supreme Court of the United States decided that Andrew Johnson was right in his refusal to obey the Tenure of Office Act of 1867, which was the basis of the impeachment charges.6 Joseph B. Warner, in his essay on Curtis in Great American Lawyers 7 speaks of the fading dramatic interest in the im peachment trial. But he did not foresee the appearance of the recent books which rescue the strength of Andrew John son from mountains of fanatical abuse, bring out the con temptible and dangerous sides of his opponents, and set forth anew all the drama inherent in the trial. The team play of the counsel for the President seems to have been perfect, Evarts with his wit, Stanbery, Nelson, and Groesbeck with their earnestness born of personal knowledge of the President. But the real turning point of the trial was at the opening, when the clear intellect and the impressive character and bearing of Benjamin R. Curtis set the tone of the defence of the 5 Theodore C.

Butler for the impeachment managers. After reading various accounts of the trial and of the ordeals to which the seven Republican senators, and particu larly Senator Ross of Kansas, were subjected, and then read ing over the opening of Butler for the managers and the open ing of Curtis for the defence, I think the really controlling issue in their minds was the constitutional nature of their position as judges. Lawyers are familiar with the remark of Causten Brown ? or whoever it was ? in regard to some judge: that he had to work twice as hard as other judges because he not only had to decide what was the right thing to do but, after he had determined that, he had to make up his mind whether to do it. In the same way, the seven Republican senators were satis fied that there was no case from a judicial point of view, and since they had been required by the Constitution to take an oath to do impartial justice, their struggle was to preserve their judicial character in the face of every form of pressure to act on political grounds. Stevens and Sumner cared noth ing for the constitutional character of the proceeding, and Butler opened with a specious argument that the Senate was not sitting as a court, but merely as a Senate conducting, not a trial, but " an inquest of office " with " none of the attri butes of a judicial court as they are commonly received and understood." Curtis answered that argument with impres sive clarity of statement in his opening sentence when he said: Mr. Chief Justice, I am here to speak to the Senate of the United States sitting in its judicial capacity as a court of impeachment, presided over by the Chief Justice of the United States, for the trial of the President of the United States. This statement suffi ciently characterizes what I have to say. Here party spirit, po litical schemes, foregone conclusions, outrageous biases can have no fit operation. The Constitution requires that here should be a " trial ". . . .8 The contrast between the conception of the government suggested by Curtis and that suggested by the opening of 8 Trial of Andrew Johnson, President of the United States (Washington, 1868), 251.</page><page sequence="40">I931] BENJAMIN ROBBINS CURTIS 249 Butler is intensely dramatic when one reads the accounts of what happened and the closeness of the vote. There was no foundation for the impeachment, but the court was politically packed and the impeachment was lost by only one vote. While Senator Fessenden of Maine, and, perhaps, one or two others seem to have realized their position from the start, it seems clear that the mind and character of Curtis held some and welded the rest of the seven Repub lican Senators to their judicial oaths. Perhaps Massachu setts has never been more impressively represented in Wash ington than in that argument when one of her sons successfully defended the nation against itself in the rancorous attack led in the main by five other sons of New England.

Down the road came Ellery Channing, the poet, trundling a trunk on a wheel barrow. "Where are you going, Mr. Channing?" inquired the Judge. " Going to Rome! " And to Rome he went, with out the formality of saying good-bye to his wife and children, or making any provision for their support. After rambling over France and Italy for several months, Ellery returned to Concord and was forgiven and begot another child. Not Edward, but one of the four elder of the five children who were born to the poet and his wife Ellen, the sister of Mar garet Fuller, Countess d'Ossoli. About nine or ten years later, in December, 1855, this elfin father indulged in one of his " riparial excursions " at Con cord with Henry Thoreau. In reply to Thoreau's inquiry as to where he was living, Ellery Channing replied, " that he did not know the name of the place."x The place then happened to be Dorchester, where his fifth child, the subject of this memoir, was born on June 15, 1856. Ellery at that time was in New Bedford, attempting journalism. Three months later Ellen Channing died of tuberculosis. Ellery completely washed his hands of all responsibility for the five children, and went his own way during the remaining forty-five years of his life. Edward remembered having seen his father just once. This may serve to explain a certain impatience of Edward Channing with ideals and idealists, especially those of the Concord School; why any youthful expression of enthusiasm for New England's favorite 'isms was apt to be met by an 1 F.

Transcendentalism may have been a leaven to New England materialism, he might grudgingly admit; but that it did not produce thrifty citizens or "good providers " he had experienced. He was in almost every respect the opposite to his father. His attitude toward life was realistic. He had a hard head for business, and knew how to get on in the academic and literary world. For fame, though not for notoriety, he had a wholesome apprecia tion; for royalties and salaries, a keen though not exagger ated sense of value. One can trace in him that drive and per sistence of the " fighting Fullers " which made Margaret such an intellectual prodigy, and enabled Ellen to bring up four children with a casual poet for a husband. But Channing's drive and energy were directed toward a tangible and attain able goal, the writing of a great History of the United States, and the only thing that could make him deflect from that goal even for a month, was the necessity of providing for his family. It would seem that heredity and environment drove Channing into contrariety. The son of a poet, he cared naught for poetry. The offspring of a man who was "all genius and no talent," as Thoreau said, he was all talent, tal ent carried to a high degree by hard, unremitting industry. Nor did Channing react toward another side of his inherit ance, the solid ballast of mercantile Higginsons, Cabots, and Perkinses, which might have been expected to sink his indi viduality in the genteel tradition of Boston. He spurned the Federalist-Whig-Republican yardstick by which Cabot Lodge measured history. In other words, Edward Channing was Edward Channing, and nothing else. He followed his own bent and formed his own opinions, independent of fashion, example, and influence. Independence was in the Channing tradition. No less than six Channings, all born within the forty years 1780-1820, may be found in the Dictionary of American Biography, sand wiched between Chang the Siamese twin and Chanute the aviator. They were not of the early Puritan migration. The first of the family came over from Dorsetshire and settled at Newport, Rhode Island, sometime about the year 1720.2 A 2 Edward T.

Up to this time the Channings seem to have been a prudent and plodding sort of family, but the Ellery blood woke them up, as it has other families (like the Sedgwicks) with which it mingled. Three of the ten children of William and Lucy Channing became famous. William Ellery Channing was the colossus of New England Unitarianism.3 Edward Tyrrell Channing, Boylston Professor of Rhetoric at Harvard, taught English to Emerson, Holmes, and Lowell, and established the classical diction of New England. Walter Channing, our Edward's grandfather, was an eminent obstetrician and medi cal professor. He married a daughter of one of the wealthy and philanthropic Perkinses of Boston, bringing also the cool Cabot blood and the ardent Higginson strain into the family crucible. Their only son was the poet, who married in 1841 Ellen Kilshaw, youngest of five children of the Hon. Timothy Fuller, sometime state senator and Member of Congress, and a descendant of the early Puritans. Enough of forbears. We left the future historian mother less and as good as fatherless at the age of three months, in September, 1856. When his mother died, it seemed likely that the seven-months baby would follow her to the grave. Just in time a proper nurse was secured, a shoemaker's wife of South Abington. With her and her husband, excellent people, Ed ward passed the first three years of his life. One Sunday a relation who came to see how the baby was doing, found him alone in the house lying in a deep drawer where the shoe findings were kept, contentedly sucking a lobster's claw. At some time during the year i860 the little boy said good-bye to his foster parents, and came up to Boston to live with his Grandfather Channing and his Aunt Barbara, in a big house on Tremont Street. The baby had been named Henry 4 ? possibly after Henry 3 " My father wished me to inquire what relation you were to the great Channing ? " once inquired a shy student of our Edward. " I am the great Channing ! " was the characteristic reply, delivered with a thump on the breast bone. 4 New England Historical and Genealogical Register, vm.

With a thrifty view to his eventual prosperity, his grandfather had him renamed and formally christened Edward Perkins Channing. Edward for his great-uncle the Boylston Professor, who died the year he was born, leaving a widow (an Ellery cousin) who had some money but no children; Perkins for his paternal grand mother's people, who had plenty of money but a great many children. Edward liked his first name, although he never got anything for it but a bad fall from the widow Channing's porch, when brought out to Cambridge as a child to remind her of his existence. The middle name he hated. Boys nick named him "Perky"; Perkins relatives patronized him. After graduating from college he dropped the Perkins, and it never appeared on any of his books. Dr. Walter Channing, like every member of his family, was a " character." After being expelled from Harvard College, along with his brother Edward, for refusing to grovel to the Faculty after a student rebellion, he obtained a medical edu cation at Philadelphia and Edinburgh, and eventually became Professor of Obstetrics and Dean of the Harvard Medical School. It was he who introduced the use of anaesthetics in childbirth. A temperance reformer, abolitionist, pacifist, and a brilliant talker as well, he did not fit in with the conventional notion of a family physician, and was usually called in at the last moment, in desperate cases. For that reason he slept on a hard couch in a room by the front door, in order to respond to nocturnal summonses. By the time his little grandson came to live with him Dr. Channing had so large an obstetrical prac tice, and had accumulated so comfortable a fortune, that in a few years he moved to Dorchester to escape importunate calls, and then to Brookline to escape the tax assessors. His daugh ter Barbara, who kept house for him, did not hold with her father's allopathic ideas, but kept a complete pharmacopoeia of homeopathic medicines with which to dose herself at need. Edward Channing always remembered his horror at seeing his grandfather, on one occasion, empty a whole bottle-full of these pellets into his hand, clap his hand to his mouth, and ms. letter of T. W.

The old gentleman had felt a craving for sweets, and, unable to find sugar in the pantry, chose the sweetest of his daughter's assortment! Miss Barbara Channing was one of those forthright New England spinsters who always did as " she'd a mind to," with a lovable character and a warm heart which went out to the motherless little boy committed to her charge. For her, Ed ward Channing felt a deep and lasting affection. Beside her, family he had none, in the ordinary sense. His grandfather was kindly but aged. His two sisters 5 were ten or more years older; his brothers Walter and Giovanni Eugene 6 were dis tributed among other aunts' and uncles' families. Edward was a lonely little boy, with a passionate love for companion ship which was never satisfied. So the tiny tot created an im aginary companion whom he called Mr. Dowdy. There is a charming description both of Edward and Mr. Dowdy in a let ter of Thomas Wentworth Higginson, dated January 21, 1861 : Speaking of Channings, I think Anna will break her heart over little Edward (n? Harry) who is becoming one of the most fasci nating little creatures who ever lived; a sort of male fairy; blue eyes, long soft hair and the most plaintive little expression, with a low tender voice like a nursing angel and all the character and indi viduality of a Channing and a Fuller combined. He is not shy or piteous now, but healthy and gay, only on a low gentle scale, his loudest warwhoop a sort of meditative soliloquy. His one chosen companion is the imaginary Mr. Dowdy, whose individuality is hopelessly intertwined with his own, he is Dowdy, but Dowdy is not he; ?in fact, as he confidentially whispered to me " There's a great many of them"; he peoples the world with Dowdies. All his small rebellions, not very frequent, are conducted with refer ence to novel first principles. " Don't you want to be good " re marks Auntie solemnly; " No " says the seraph very gently, shak ing his tresses, as if he saw no force in that aspect of the case ? " / don't want to be good."

What to do with a disputant whose tones only become more soft and celestial amid sin and retribution? 7 Truly, this boy was father to the man! Edward Channing never did " want to be good," nor was he ever much concerned with pleasing his friends or any one else. The world of imagination was so much more real to this flaxen-haired little boy than the world in which his maiden aunt and his grandfather moved, that he remembered little of the stirring events of 1861-65. Just a vague impression of fluttering flags and marching men, and one vivid picture of his ninth year, when the terrible cry "Lincoln is murdered! " was heard in the house, and Edward was allowed to go out into Tremont Street alone for the first time to buy a paper. Physicians seldom took a summer vacation in those days. But as the little boy's health was frail, and his guardians feared tuberculosis, he was " put out to grass " as he called it, during the summers of 1865 and 1866. " Mother Hewes," wife of an excellent farmer in Weston, known to Dr. Chan ning because she made clay stoppers for carbolic acid jars, took Edward to board. He was initiated into country life by being tossed by the village boys into a poison ivy thicket, whence he ran howling home to Mother Hewes. But he proved to be immune, and soon joined the neighbors' lads in persecuting the reputed witch of Weston. She was, he re membered, " an old woman, long and lank, and whenever we threw stones at her front door she would come out with a broom ? preparatory to riding through the air, as we thought, but no doubt desirous of banging her persecutors." Nor was this the boy's only contact with the seventeenth century. As he recalled in later life, " the Sabbath was then the Sabbath." It was not a day of rejoicing and of tearing around the country ? on the contrary, it was the day to reckon up one's misdeeds of the past week and make resolves for better doings. On Saturday night the gate leading into the front yard was closed at sundown, the horses were given a day of rest; feeding the stock, milking the cows and driving them to and from pasture was the only work that 7 Higginson mss., no. 699.

Every one put on his or her best attire. On one occasion, Albert the grown-up son, pulling on his Sunday boots with great difficulty, ejaculated " By George, that hurts! " Whereupon his mother told him to stop swearing, which he did im mediately. We walked to meeting in the morning and the small ones stayed after to attend Sabbath School. We had a cold dinner and went back to meeting for the afternoon. After supper we boys gathered in the road in front of the house and gazed hopefully into the sky for the sight of the first star, when one could play; for in those days the Sabbath began at sundown on Saturday and ended with the coming of the first star on Sunday.8 Soon after this Dr. Walter Channing's household moved from Tremont Street to Dorchester, near Savin Hill Bay. The Dorchester Estate [Edward remembered] had land around it which was then an orchard and a garden. My aunt was fond of gardening and as I was too young and frail to do much in the way of attending school, I was set to work in the garden and have hated the smell of soil and of growing plants ever since. ... It was at this period of my existence that my Aunt Barbara thought that I would better acquire some of the graces, so I was sent to dancing school and my sister undertook to give me lessons on the piano. It seemed to me that dancing was about as silly a performance as could be thought of . . . and I ... do not know how to dance to this day. Nor did his sister have any better success with the piano lessons. About the year 1870 Dr. Channing moved to Brookline, in a house near Edward's two married sisters. There he made the acquaintance of sundry Cabot, Perkins, and Higginson cousins, and attended somewhat irregularly, on account of his poor health, William B. Eayres's private school in Boston. He had constant headaches, and was a dull scholar. It was not until after his marriage that Dr. John Morgan, an oculist who had studied in Vienna, discovered that astigmatism had been the entire cause of Edward's weakness. Life at Brookline was very pleasant. There were plenty of open spaces, and an opportunity to raise chickens ? a hobby 8 This quotation, and several others, as well as many facts in this memoir, are taken, by Mrs. Channing's kind permission, from the manuscript of an incomplete autobiography which Channing dictated in 1929-30, and which he intended to publish under the title " Memoirs of a Hitherto Truthful Man."</page><page sequence="48">1931] EDWARD CHANNING 257 which Professor Channing found to be a useful topic of con versation some fifty years later when the Crown Prince and Princess of Sweden were brought into Widener 417 by Presi dent Lowell. Dr. Channing, always solicitous of his grand son's health, sent him one summer to a camp on Lake Winni pesaukee, and in due time procured him a boat and arranged to have him go cruising with Lindsay Swift. But he had little boyish companionship. He was too slight to take much part in boys' sports, and although he manfully tried football, it resulted in his right arm (already once broken accidentally) being badly wrenched, so that ball games had to be aban doned. He was considered lucky to pass the entrance ex aminations for Harvard with six " conditions," which had to be made up during the college course. In the fall of 1874 he entered with the Class of 1878. Harvard was not much better than school for the first two years. President Eliot, at that time only forty years old, had not yet got the elective system extended to the Freshman and Sophomore classes. Edward Channing, with splitting head aches, conditions to be worked off, and prescribed studies which he loathed, was able just to stay in college. In the social life of the university he had slight part. He did not care much for his classmates, nor they for him. In the Sopho more year only did he have a chum, Lincoln L. Eyre. Junior year he roomed in Matthews 42 with a dog " Tim," and subse quently in Stoughton, where the proctor was less tolerant, with a cat; later, as a resident graduate, his pet and com panion was a parrot.9 Still frail in physique ? weighing only 117 pounds at graduation ? and shy in the sense for which the French have the word sauvage, he kept much to himself, belonged to no clubs or societies, and made no athletic teams. This is not to say that Channing was a bookworm, with no taste for outdoor life. He had a deep love for the sea, in which he was able to indulge during the summers that he 9 Curiously/this seems to be the only trait that Channing had in common with his father. Cf. Thoreau's Journal (Bradford Torrey, Ed., rv. 294): " Cfhanning] says he keeps a dog for society, to stir up the air of the room when it becomes dead, for he experiences awful solitudes. Another time thinks we must cultivate the social qualities, perhaps had better keep two dogs apiece." Again (vi. 75), "When I was at Cs the other evening, he punched his cat with the poker because she purred too loud for him."</page><page sequence="49">258 MASSACHUSETTS HISTORICAL SOCIETY [MAY spent at Nantucket with his sister, Mrs. Folien Cabot. It was typical of Channing that his boat should be the ideal one for a lone hand, a Rob Roy sailing canoe, built to his order from John Macgregor's design. Dr. Gardner Weld Allen, Harvard '77, remembers how Channing would paddle the canoe sev eral miles out to sea and lie there basking, drinking in the beauty of sky and ocean, absorbing the strength that comes with sunlight and clean air. The Rob Roy, which he kept for six or eight years, served him also for lonely longshore cruises. This sailing experience made Channing an excellent amateur seaman, deepened his love of the sea, taught him self-control, and proved most useful in his historical work. For there is no art, science, or experience that can not be turned to the service of Clio.10 It was on one of his cruises, in the summer of 1884, that Channing performed his first experiment in iconoclasm, or what would today be called " debunking " history. Ascertain ing from the United States Coast Survey the time of high water at Plymouth on December 21, 1620, the day of the " Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers," Channing chose a summer day when high tide came at the identical hour, passed the night before on Clark's Island as the Pilgrims did, and pushing off early next morning in his Rob Roy found that the current carried him well up toward Jones River and Duxbury Harbor; that Plymouth Rock was out of the question as a landing place. That convinced him that Elder Faunce, when in 1741, at the age of 91, he pointed out that rock as the place where the fore fathers landed, suffered a lapse of memory. Of course Chan ning had the common sense to know that his experiment proved nothing, and never in print claimed that it did.11 But 10 Channing had a sure touch when dealing with matters of naval warfare and maritime commerce. In his third volume, for instance, he points out for the first time a fact that even Alfred T. Mahan had overlooked: that the French naval victory off the Capes of the Chesapeake on September 5, 1781, was the determining factor in the Yorktown Campaign. " The American Revolution was won in the dockyards of Brest and Toulon," was one of his aphorisms. He liked to read such books as Treasure Island, Tom Cringle's Log, and Southey's Life of Nelson for relaxation; and the only time he was known to express any regret at taking up history as a profession, was when he saw the experimental naval tank of a professor of naval architecture. 11 Note his guarded statements on " The Landing on Plymouth Rock," with references to his periodical controversies on the subject, in his History of</page><page sequence="50">i93i] EDWARD CHANNING 259 the episode served his courses for many years as an excellent illustration of the untrustworthiness of old men's memories, and of popular tradition. It was not until his Junior year that Channing found his chosen cult; and the high priest who conducted him into the temple was Henry Adams. For in that year he was admitted to Henry Adams's famous seminary on mediaeval institutions. Let him tell the story himself: I cannot express, no words of mine could, the debt that I owe to Henry Adams. He was the greatest teacher that I ever encoun tered. He could draw out from a man the very best that was in him. In my Junior year, I took his course in Advanced Mediaeval Institutions. I remember him well, sitting perched on his throne in one of the little rooms in University Hall. He would twist his legs around the chair legs, lean forward and lecture for an hour without books or paper. . . . The subject he assigned to me was " The Influence of the Canon Law on English Common Law." I knew nothing about Canon or Common Law, but it was my busi ness to find out. I abandoned all other work and devoted myself for a month, more or less, to both. Finally, fully primed and quak ing in my shoes, I stood up to read my report to the class when the door opened and in walked President Eliot with a stranger, an Englishman. Adams uncoiled his legs, arose to his full length of about five foot three, greeted the Englishman warmly, gave him a seat, and President Eliot departed. Then Adams without a blush said, " I will conclude my remarks on the Career of Simon de Montfort," of whom he had never mentioned a word. But he pro ceeded with so much learning that the Englishman was amazed, and so was I. And Adams forgot all about my lecture, for which I was duly grateful. However, I had to write a thesis on a comparison of the marriage institutions of the Germans in the time of Tacitus and those of the North American Indians. I knew nothing about either, but went to work to find out, again abandoning all other attempts at learning. My chum, who was a Latin scholar, helped me with Tacitus, and I proceeded on my own hook to find out what I could on the North American Indians. One day in the library in old Gore Hall, Adams suddenly came in. He spied me and asked if he could help me. I told him that I could not find much about the Indians. Thereupon he took me under his wing for an hour or so and we procured a pile of books which we placed on a table and the United States, i. 320-321; and also 2 Proceedings, xvn. 381-382.

That essay was my undoing. I had been designed by my grandfather for the law, but I abandoned it for history. It had been Channing's intention to take Henry Adams's course on American History his senior year; but in 1877, Adams, having induced the Corporation to establish a " rival course " in that subject, and to appoint Henry Cabot Lodge to give it, suddenly decided to resign. Hence Channing studied American history his Senior year with Lodge, who did not share Adams's love for upsetting traditions and hearing the other side. Channing undertook in a report or thesis to expose what he considered to be the hypocrisy of Francis Hig ginson, the first minister of Salem. Dr. Lodge was displeased: " Mr. Channing, do you not know that Mr. Higginson was your ancestor? " " Yes, sir." " Do you think it well to speak thus of your ancestor? " It was the dogmatism of Lodge and the bias of Hildreth, the current text-book, which gave Channing his first idea of writ ing a History of the United States from the sources. Even before he took his bachelor's degree, he began to accumulate notes for that purpose. In the summer before Channing's Junior year, his grand father, who had so far seen him through college, died. Dr. Channing left an estate in trust for his children and grand children; but the country was slowly recovering from the panic of 1873, and in Edward's Senior year he received only three hundred dollars from it. Obtaining a Bowditch Schol arship from the College, he took one of the cheapest rooms in Stoughton, renting at forty-four dollars per annum, and sought out new sources of income. The most lucrative was a cramming session for students less industrious or interested than himself given the night before history examinations. For this service, Channing charged a dollar a head. The first trial was so successful that the second " seminar " adjourned to a larger room, and eventually the audience overflowed into</page><page sequence="52">I93i] EDWARD CHANNING 261 the entry and onto the stairs. He also made money in part nership with a fellow student who procured books from pub lishers and sold them to undergraduates at cut prices. And once, getting advance news of a bad smash-up on the Old Colony Railroad, and knowing how the public reacted to such catastrophes, he borrowed money, bought the fallen stock on margin, and sold it again a few days later, clearing three hun dred dollars.12 By such means, and by an improved yield from his grandfather's estate, Channing was encouraged to remain for two postgraduate years in order to seek the doc torate in history. Harvard College, then, did not teach Channing to get along well with people, as another college with a moulding tradition might have done. But it gave him full opportunity to develop his own talents; and it set his course for life. If Channing did not find friendship at Harvard, he found himself. Dr. Lodge's efforts to prove Thomas Jefferson a tricky and insincere politician made Channing suspect that Thomas Jefferson was a great and sincere statesman, and he decided to write a life of him?a project abandoned when Henry Adams's History of the United States was announced. As a work preparatory to the biography, he chose the Louisiana Purchase for his doctoral dissertation. In those days no gen eral examination was required of doctoral candidates who had taken final honors in history; consequently Channing was able to concentrate on his dissertation, and it was ready in February, 1880. He did not, however, neglect his health, or the sea, which to Channing meant much the same thing; sunlight and the sea were a vital force to him as to his seafaring ancestors, re storing his strength after a long winter's study, invigorating both mind and body. His favorite boat was still the Rob Roy canoe; but an opportunity for deep-water seamanship came through his classmate, George K. Boutelle, who tells the story in a letter to the writer, dated April 17, 1931 : Although we both were in the Class of 1878, my relations with Edward Channing did not become at all intimate until some time 12 Channing enjoyed taking little flyers in stock like this, all his life. He used to tell the writer that he would ask the advice of his Cabot and Higginson cousins on State Street, and then do the opposite, which in the long run proved profitable.</page><page sequence="53">2 62 MASSACHUSETTS HISTORICAL SOCIETY [MAY after our graduation, when he was reading for his Master's Degree and I was in the Law School. We discovered (accidentally, so far as I remember) that we both had a strong liking for boats and for all that concerned a sea-going life; and it was chiefly on that com mon interest that our subsequent relations grew up. Under the influence of these subjects, to which we both brought a considerable degree of youthful enthusiasm, many of the tempera mental qualities which during his undergraduate days had held him somewhat apart from his classmates, fell into the background, and we spent many hours together in good talk and agreeable personal relations. His practical knowledge of our principal subject was altogether superior to mine, and he made it extremely useful to me in giving advice and suggestions in my first nautical venture ? the acquisition of a cat-boat named Alice. After that we spent many weeks together at Squirrel Island, Maine, sailing about the harbor and building up an experience which I could hardly have had in a more agreeable or more effec tive way. Later on I became the owner of a larger boat, named Norna, in which we used to make cruises together along the coast from Squirrel Island as our home port. Our living quarters on board were much confined, but we always got on well together. He had many qualities which made him an uncommonly good com panion under such conditions ? always ready to do his part of whatever was to be done, never complaining about the weather and making the best of everything that came along. He had moods and peculiarities of temper, and so had I; but by that time we had come to know each other pretty well and were able to avoid diffi culties. In his most genial mood he was the best of good company, with a sense of humor and an appreciation of the relations of things and people that was unusual. In 1880, the Harvard Faculty was not yet broken in to the additional burden of examining candidates for the doctorate; as Channing's experience in seeking this degree, proves. Weeks passed after the dissertation was handed in, and no word came from the committee appointed to read it. Finally Channing sought out one of the members, Professor James Barr Ames, and proposed to read the thesis aloud to him. Day and hour were appointed ? Ames's rooms in Holworthy. On ascending the stairs, Channing encountered another pro fessor descending them somewhat unsteadily, followed by a man-servant bearing the remains of a large lunch. A short time after Channing had begun reading, he observed that</page><page sequence="54">1931 ] EDWARD CHANNING 263 Mr. Ames was asleep; but the interruption of the reading awakened him. After three such performances, the examiner told the candidate that the thesis was very interesting and that he did not need to read any more. A day or two later Mr. Ames was married. The thesis approved, the next step was the examination, which took place in an upper lecture room of Harvard Hall. Professor Torrey was chairman of the committee, and with him were Professors Ames, Gurney, and Lodge, and Henry Adams, whom Channing had recently been assisting in gathering data for the first volume of his History of the United States of America during the Adminis tration of Thomas Jefferson. Channing had a throbbing tooth, which gave him a sort of Roderic Dhu attitude toward his examination. Somewhat to his disappointment, all re fused to question him save Professor Torrey, who found it " pretty hard sledding." The climax came when Mr. Torrey inquired whether Albert Gallatin had been mixed up in the Whiskey Rebellion. Channing answered, "No, at the time he was in New York getting married, and could not attend to business." He looked at Mr. Ames, who blushed; and Mr. Torrey hurriedly concluded the examination. The candidate was kept in suspense only five minutes, after which he was informed that he would receive the degree of Doctor of Phi losophy at the next Commencement. Having secured the coveted Ph.D., the question was, what next? An application to President Eliot for an opportunity to teach American history received the reply that none such existed, together with this comment, which was a very apt description of the academic status of American history at that time: Your desire to teach American history is a laudable one; but you of course recognize the practical necessity of having other strings to your bow. There are only two colleges in this country within my knowledge where much is made of American history, and you know how elementary the teaching on that subject is in American schools. History is generally taught by a master who has several other subjects on his hands.13 Fortunately for Channing, an increased yield from his grandfather's estate put him in possession of a substantial 18 ms. letter to Channing, June 23, 1880.</page><page sequence="55">264 MASSACHUSETTS HISTORICAL SOCIETY [MAY sum of money which he put to the best possible use ? a grand tour of Europe. Crossing on a steamer of the French Line, in order to practise the language, he soon found himself at Le Havre. While most of the passengers made the conven tional journey to Paris, Channing took a series of river steam ers, local trains, and canal boats to Rouen, Amiens, Ghent, Bruges, and through Holland. Thence to Bremen and Ber lin, where he joined forces with Edward H. Stroebel '77, in a tour through Germany and Italy, which he looked back upon as one of the pleasantest experiences of his life. Other Ameri can companions were picked up or joined on the way, and there were sundry innocent romances with young ladies, American and otherwise. From Naples he struck off alone for the Near East, visited Athens and Constantinople, made friends with a Queen's Messenger, and was deterred from a journey through Russia only by the fact that the port of Odessa was closed. Another steamer thence to Marseilles, then a visit to Carcassonne, which he had read about in Viollet-le-Duc; through southwestern France to the ch?teaux on the Loire, and to Chartres, where his first sight of the cathedral remained a vivid memory fifty years after. Several weeks were passed in and around Paris, stopping at a pension in the Latin Quarter; then London and Oxford, with a memo rable dinner at Oriel College, where his cousin Francis A. Channing (subsequently Baron Channing of Wellingborough) was a don. This grand tour opened new vistas for Channing, enriched his knowledge, and kindled his imagination; he al ways said that it was the best investment he ever made. Returning to Cambridge in the fall of 1881, Dr. Channing procured rooms in Felton Hall, and settled down to make a living by his pen, until something better should turn up. In those days Harvard still admitted to the privilege of cham bers, library, and commons, mature scholars who were not seeking a degree. They paid a small fee, and were listed as Resident Graduates. It was a survival of the mediaeval tradi tion that a college was primarily a shelter for scholars, and not a boarding school for boys, or a forcing-bed for the profes sions. Like other traditions, both useful and useless, it was soon after swept out by the besom of reform; but Dr. Chan ning was able to enjoy the pleasant privilege. He had a small</page><page sequence="56">i93i] EDWARD CHANNING 265 independent income from his grandfather's estate, and made a little more by writing articles and book reviews for the New York Nation, Science, and The Literary World; and he was in the position to keep a weather eye on the Harvard His tory Department. President Eliot used to give Horace Greeley's advice to young Harvard graduates eager to break into the Faculty; but the canny ones knew better. It was well to be on hand, and not in Chicago, Madison, or Berkeley, when a substitute was wanted for a sick professor, or when an unexpected vacancy occurred. And academic reputations were made then, as now, by writing rather than teaching. During his undergraduate days, Channing had become much attached to Henry W. Torrey, the senior professor of history, and upon his return to Cambridge fell into the habit of calling upon him frequently. By 1883, Mr. Torrey, fifty years out of college and forty-seven years McLean Profes sor of Ancient and Modern History, was getting ready to retire; and as a preliminary relief, offered Channing a share of his course on " The History of Modern Treaties." Accordingly, in the fall of 1883, Channing obtained a proc torship and a one-year appointment as instructor in history. The arrangement was that in History 15, "The History of Modern Treaties," Professor Torrey heard the class recite twice a week on Woolsey's International Law, while Chan ning lectured the third hour. Soon came the ordeal dreaded by all young instructors ? the first lecture. Stuffed with knowledge and primed with dates, Dr. Channing proceeded to the lecture room, marched up the aisle with a stern look on his naturally pleasant countenance, and slammed his notes on the desk with a resounding thwack. Turning around to face the class, his eye lighted on a man who had been a popu lar and prominent Senior at the time when Channing was a timid and unregarded Sophomore. Any one who has expe rienced that sort of gulf will understand the sinking feeling that seized Channing when he saw the great man of college days in the front row. But he steeled himself, advanced to the edge of the desk so that the students could see that his notes were not necessary, and went full speed ahead for the required fifty-five minutes. " It was an ordeal," he wrote, in 1930, " but it gave me a feeling of confidence which never de</page><page sequence="57">2 66 MASSACHUSETTS HISTORICAL SOCIETY [MAY serted me in the nearly half-century of my pedagogical efforts at Harvard." Ever after, he used to urge his graduate pupils to lecture without notes, not only because it impressed the class, but because it enabled the unimportant details to sift themselves out of one's mind; and he would add this wise counsel: " Remember this, no matter how little you know, it is always far more than the class knows." Channing had hoped that History 15 would prove a step ping-stone to Adams's and Lodge's old courses on the Eng lish Colonies and the United States. But his ambition for many years was thwarted by the simultaneous appointment of Albert Bushnell Hart. Although graduating two years later than Channing, Hart had since taken his doctorate at Freiburg under Herman von Hoist, and returned to Cam bridge with high recommendations from his German master. So it was Hart who obtained the American history courses, while Channing had to be handy-man in the department. Considerably discouraged by this, Channing, in 1885, became a candidate for a professorship in history and political science at Ohio State University. President Eliot recommended him " as a valuable member of any academic staff," for his train ing, character, general intelligence, and "unusual attain ments"; but the position was awarded to a Michigan Ph.D., Professor George Wells Knight, and Channing hung on at Harvard. In 1886-87, Hart relinquished to him the course on Colonial History, subsequently famous as History 10. But it was many years before he was able to concentrate on this, his chosen field. Hart and Channing were promoted assistant professors and professors at the same time, in 1887 and 1897. Together they gave Harvard her great reputation as a center for the study and teaching of American History. In character, methods, and everything else the two men were utterly different; yet each was a great teacher, and both did incalculable good for the study of American history. They learned to rub along together fairly well, to appreciate one another, and even to cooperate in the famous Guide to the Study of American History (1896), a remarkable hand-book and classified bib liography; Channing also contributed a volume on The Jef fersonian System (1906) to Hart's American Nation series.</page><page sequence="58">i93i] EDWARD CHANNING 267 It is much to the credit both of President Eliot and the De partment of History that Harvard managed to retain and use the diverse talents of these two rivals. During the first year of his instructorship, Channing wrote his first important work, in competition for the Toppan Prize offered for the best essay on " Town and County Government in the North American Colonies." Herbert Baxter Adams, one of the judges, secured Channing's prize essay for the Johns Hopkins University Studies in Historical and Political Sci ence, which he had lately founded. It was printed in 1884 as Town and County Government in the English Colonies. As institutional history was then the prevailing fashion among professional historians, Channing had done very well for him self. Besides being the first published proof of his scholarly capacities, it led to his election to this Society in December of that year, at the unusually early age of twenty-six. For two years after his first teaching appointment, Chan ning continued to contribute geographical articles to Science; and the research for one of these, on the roads from India to Central Asia, led to a friendship with Justin Winsor, Librarian and Curator of Maps at Harvard. In consequence, the young man was invited to accompany the elder to Saratoga, New York, in September, 1884, where the American Historical As sociation was founded.14 There he met a small but distin guished company, including a few members of the elder gen eration of historians such as Charles Deane, with a number of young and ardent doctors like Ephraim Emerton and J. Franklin Jameson, who were eager to give scientific history its proper place in the American university curriculum. Channing's association with Justin Winsor meant much* to him. It was from Winsor that he learned the simple method of jotting down facts when you obtain them, on separate slips made up from the backs of torn proof-sheets, but always with an appropriate heading and the exact reference; and classi fying the accumulated slips at a precise time every week. One of the first fruits of this friendship was Channing's col laboration with Winsor in his Narrative and Critical History 14 The first paper delivered before the American Historical Association was Channing's " Town and County Government," in abstract, Papers of the American Historical Association (New York and London, 1886), 1. 23.</page><page sequence="59">2 68 MASSACHUSETTS HISTORICAL SOCIETY [MAY of America, to which he contributed the chapters on " The Companions of Columbus" in Volume 11. (1886), and "The War in the Southern Department" in Volume vi. (1887), together with much assistance in the critical essays on authorities. When Channing joined the Harvard Faculty, the introduc tory history course was being given by Professor Silas Marcus Macvane, whose saturnine and somnolent personality made it a deadly experience for the undergraduates. In 1887-88, Channing was associated with him in this course; the next year it was given by Channing and Charles Gross; and dur ing the next three years by Channing alone. During that time, by stimulating lectures, by scrapping Freeman's Out lines in favor of such reading as would appeal to the under graduate mind, Channing built up History 1 so that it over flowed from Lower Massachusetts, then the largest lecture room, into Sanders Theatre. That was farther than Chan ning cared to project his voice; besides, he was at the same time giving his course on Colonial history, one on English history with Macvane, a graduate course on " The History of Political Theory," which met around his dining-room table, and a seminary on American history with Hart. This " Chan ning and Hart Seminar" proved a magnet for capable stu dents, both future historians and others. In the years 1891-93, for instance, there passed through it Evarts B. Greene, William Garrett Brown, and William MacDonald, historians; David F. Houston, university president and cabi net minister; W. E. B. DuBois, intellectual leader of his race; Francis G. Caffey, lawyer and federal judge; Frederick W. Dallinger, congressman; and Jeremiah Smith, the financial savior of Hungary. Nor did Channing neglect his adminis trative duties as a member of the Harvard Faculty, which in those days met weekly, debated long, and settled each indi vidual case of discipline separately. He attended regularly, spoke frequently, and served on many committees. He was a leader of that party in the Faculty which wished to reduce the length of the course for the bachelor's degree to three years; a policy which in later life he believed to have been mistaken. In 1893, relief came in sight when President Eliot asked</page><page sequence="60">i93i] EDWARD CHANNING 269 Channing if he could not find something to do in the History Department for young Archibald Cary Coolidge, who had returned with a Freiburg Ph.D. Channing gave Coolidge a special section in History 1, which he conducted so well that in 1894-1895 he was given entire charge of the course. Channing then took over from Macvane a course on " The History of England in the Tudor and Stuart Period." It was of great value for his work, giving him a thorough knowledge of the English background to American Colonial history. This first third of Channing's teaching career was closed in the summer of 1896, when there began a well-earned sabbati cal year. By this time Channing had firmly established him self as one of the leading junior historians in the country. As a teacher he was effective and highly respected, though not popular, except with serious or advanced students, and with those who came to know him personally. His lectures were pungent and stimulating, he selected his reading well, and saw that it was done; but his manner toward undergraduates, especially those of the more fashionable and frivolous kind, was crusty. In the college comic paper of that day Channing always appears wearing a top hat, and generally bearing a hatchet or some such implement of destruction, aimed at the Washington Elm, or Plymouth Rock, or other popular fetish. When the rapid growth of enrollment in his courses aroused some of his superiors to visit them, in order to see how it was done, Channing suavely invited them to address the class. When Samuel Eliot, of the visiting committee of the Overseers, walked into Lower Massachusetts and asked permission to join the audience, Channing glared at him and said, " I'm very sorry, Dr. Eliot, but I am holding an hour examination to day." An unannounced test was the sword that Channing kept suspended over his class. One spring morning while he was lecturing, a large dog wandered into Lower Massachusetts, and attracted more attention than did the lecturer. Channing announced, " If that dog isn't out of here within one minute, there will be a written recitation," and took out his watch and began to count the seconds. A couple of football players promptly collared the dog and threw him out. Ef you read History, all runs smooth ez grease, Coz there the men ain't nothin' more'n idees,</page><page sequence="61">270 MASSACHUSETTS HISTORICAL SOCIETY [MAY says Hosea Biglow. But it never ran smooth as grease from Channing's lips to the student mind, and historical characters, as he described them, were quite as human and cantankerous as Channing himself. He had a great contempt for the " fin ished lecturer " beloved by lazy students and women's clubs, who delivers history in predigested form, with neat headings and paragraphs. Instead, he furnished the youthful mind with roughage on which to ruminate and plenty of spice to di gest withal. Such episodes as the Voyages of the Northmen and the Boston Tea Party were not emphasized because im portant in themselves, but for the methods that their study involved, and the insight they gave students into the myth making process. And while Channing made no effort to con ceal his own opinions of men and events, he was delighted to have students come back at him vigorously, in their essays and examinations. It must not be supposed that Channing's heavy burden of courses in this decade consumed all his time or exhausted his energy. By the most rigid economy of both he managed to do a good deal of important writing. Following his prize essay on Town and County Government (1884), a study of the Narragansett Planters, a curiously exotic New England group, was published in the Johns Hopkins Series in 1886. Next came a paper on the Navigation Laws, the first full and accurate summary of the English Acts of Trade and Navigation affecting the Colonies, which was delivered before the American Antiquarian Society in 1889. In ^92 came the paper, mentioned elsewhere, on the Genesis of the New Eng land Town; and the same year, in collaboration with Albert Bushnell Hart, he began the publication of the series known as the American History Leaflets, pioneers in cheap and handy source material. In collaboration with Thomas Went worth Higginson he wrote, in 1892-1893, English History for American Readers, a useful text-book for schools.15 At the instance of Justin Winsor, he received an offer to write a short volume on the history of the United States for the Cambridge Historical Series. It was largely written during a summer at Nantucket, and published both here and in Eng land in 1895 as The United States of America, 1765-1865. 15 A later edition was called English History for Americans.</page><page sequence="62">i93i] EDWARD CHANNING 27I Although not profitable ? for the English will not read Ameri can history unless written by one of themselves ? this book was well reviewed on both sides of the Atlantic, and translated into French, German, and Russian. Ten years later Maxim Gorki told Channing that the Russian translation was read aloud in revolutionary gatherings, and helped the good work of undermining the Czarist r?gime. During this period, too, Channing was active in this Society, of which he was the junior member for several years after his election in December, 1884. "At that time," he said many years later, when referring to his election,16 " I looked upon this as a tribute to my historical precocity. Since then I have come to suspect that the fact that my mother, Ellen Fuller, was Dr. Green's playmate at Groton, may have had something to do with his interest in my welfare." Channing liked to describe his first attendance at a meeting of the Soci ety, and his pleasure at the grace and courtliness with which Dr. Holmes and Francis Parkman met him at the door, and welcomed him as the latest and youngest member. He was a frequent attendant at our meetings, and a contributor to our Proceedings with short remarks; he also served on the com mittee of publication for the Winthrop Papers, and did part of the work of preparing the fifth volume17 for the press. His only formal communication at this period, " The Genesis of the Massachusetts Town" (1892),18 concluded a sym posium on that subject. Channing, discarding the fanciful and atavistic theories of the New England town, showed its many points of resemblance to the English parish of the period, and reached the conclusion that the " towns were not based on any model; they grew by the exercise of English common-sense and political experience, combined with the circumstances of the place." Since that day, this paper has generally been regarded as the last word on what was once a very contentious subject, and is so cited by the latest author ity, Professor John Fairfield Sly.19 16 Proceedings, XLvn. 129. 17 6 Collections, m. 18 2 Proceedings, vn. 242-263; it should be noted that this paper is not listed under Channing's name in the Index to the Second Series of the Pro ceedings, although his other papers and brief remarks are mentioned. 19 Town Government in Massachusetts (1930), 57-58; 68.</page><page sequence="63">272 MASSACHUSETTS HISTORICAL SOCIETY [MAY Fortunately, Channing had enjoyed continuous good, rugged health ever since Dr. Morgan cured his astigmatism. He never wore an overcoat except in zero weather (when an ancient Inverness cape would be resurrected) and seldom an undershirt. His theory was that the reaction of the body to cold fresh air during a professor's short but frequent walks at his daily work, took the place of exercise. In his case, certainly, the theory was proved correct, for a daily row in summer was his only other activity out of doors. In his social life, Channing was always restricted. Among colleagues and friends, such as met for luncheon at the long table in the Colonial Club, he was full of wit and banter; but for general society he had no taste, and he neither danced nor played cards, nor dined out, nor belonged to any Boston club. His visits, even as a young man, were largely confined to the homes of his relatives, and to few of them. It was at the household of his kinsman and uncle-by-marriage, Colonel Higginson, that he met Alice Thacher, the younger sister of Colonel Higginson's second wife. They were married in the summer of 1886 and lived the first winter of their married life at 46 Concord Avenue, subsequently at 1 Brewster Place, and from 1900 in the former house of Justin Winsor, at 74 Sparks Street. There Channing enjoyed Winsor's library, a large oblong room lined on four sides with bookshelves; and there, when his day's work at the college was done, he spent his evenings in reading and research. For many years the Channings and their two daughters passed the summer months at Nantucket. In 1904, wishing to be a little less remote, they purchased " Noisy Point " on Cotuit Harbor, then a quiet Cape Cod village with few sum mer residents save A. Lawrence Lowell, Frank W. Taussig, and James Hardy Ropes. Channing continued his systematic, almost ascetic, life throughout the summer. Every morn ing he spent in his study, reading, writing, or dictating history to his excellent secretary, Miss Eva G. Moore. Promptly at noon he rowed across the harbor to get the mail, and this was his principal exercise. After lunch he generally went sailing in a small boat of Mr. Lowell's; and, as Mr. Lowell has said, showed his good seamanship by never touching her keel on bottom ? no common feat in Cape Cod waters. But he never</page><page sequence="64">I93i] EDWARD CHANNING 2 73 played golf or tennis; and the evenings were spent quietly at home, reading. It was in his Junior year in college that Channing conceived what was to be his chief monument ? a History of the United States from the beginning to 1900. About the year 1895, when relief from immediate and pressing tasks seemed near, the project began to assume definite shape. No such work then existed, nor has it been attempted since. Bancroft's History of the United States, upon which that author worked intermittently for more than fifty years, wound up with the year 1789. Hildreth's went down only to 1820. Von Hoist's, although much admired in his day, was mainly a very biased political history from 1815 to the Civil War. Henry Adams began with the year 1800, and turned to something else when he reached the year 1817. John Bach McMaster, to be sure, had already published three volumes of his History of the American People, which was to be Channing's pace-maker for many years; but McMaster began with the year 1782. Channing knew that the task he set himself would be long and probably unprofitable in a pecuniary sense; that he must sac rifice much if he hoped to attain his goal. He counted the cost, and at the age of forty determined to go ahead. The sabbatical of 1896-97 was to have been the first op portunity to work steadily on the " Great Work " (as Chan ning's students always called his History of the United States) ; but there came an unexpected though fortunate in terruption. The volume published in the Cambridge His torical Series attracted the attention of Mr. George P. Brett, who had just taken charge of Macmillan's new educational department in New York; and he invited Channing to write a one-volume college text-book of American history, offering such generous royalties as to " make most school-book pub lishers blush with shame." Professor Charles F. Dunbar, Channing's mentor on the Harvard Faculty, advised him to accept, since a successful text-book would help to keep the family pot a-boiling while the first volume of the larger his tory was being written. So the year abroad was devoted more to writing than to research in colonial history. One month in the summer Channing spent at London, working in the Reading Room of the British Museum, where</page><page sequence="65">2 74 MASSACHUSETTS HISTORICAL SOCIETY [MAY he made the acquaintance of Samuel Rawson Gardiner. Most of the winter he passed in lodgings at Bournemouth; and in the spring of 1897 the Channings took a cottage at Lee, a little village on the North Devon coast between Morthoe and Ilfracombe. In that quiet atmosphere and beautiful scenery, the Student9s History of the United States was finished, and the first edition appeared in 1898. It proved to be one of the most successful books of the sort, selling by the tens of thou sands, and, in several revised editions, holding its own for thirty years among a host of rivals. The Student's History had, however, one unfortunate effect. The writing and re writing of the copy in longhand gave Channing writer's cramp, from which he never recovered; and as he never found it pos sible to compose on the typewriter, all his subsequent books were dictated, somewhat to the damage of his literary style. Channing returned to Harvard in the fall of 1897 as full professor,20 and to a much easier schedule, which made pos sible continuous work at his main task. For the next ten years Channing offered only a course on colonial history for both undergraduates and graduates, and a seminary primarily for graduate students. History 23, as this course was num bered, became one of the most famous seminaries of American history in the country, a veritable nursery of scholars; for it moved forward with the irresistible march of the " Great Work " from the Northmen to the twentieth century. There it was, as Carl Russell Fish has well said,21 that Channing " gruffly boxed " his graduate pupils " into the paths of his torical rectitude." He always regarded them as individuals to be trained into self-sufficing historians, never as an organized band to cooperate. ... As a result, he sent out many leaders but did not create a school." History 23 was limited in numbers to ten or at most twelve students. For two or three weeks at the opening of the term, Channing lectured to them on methods, interspersing the solid matter with shrewd, witty, and original comments on persons and events. Too often, in this country and abroad, the his 20 In 1912 he succeeded Macvane in the McLean Professorship of Ancient and Modern History, the oldest chair of civil history in the United States. 21 Current History, xxxm. 863 (March, 1931), C R. Fish, "Edward Channing, American Historian."</page><page sequence="66">1931] EDWARD CHANNING 275 torical seminary has been perverted into a sort of sweat-shop in which the students save the professor time and labor by working up material which he can use. Channing never ex ploited his students; they obtained far more from him than he from them, for he seldom assigned topics on which he was not already himself expert. When, as often happened, the student discovered some fact or explanation hitherto unknown to Channing, he never failed to acknowledge it. To be " embalmed in a footnote " of the " Great Work " was deemed an honor by his pupils. Nor would he allow the dry read ing of a student's report from a written draft. It must be presented in the form of a lecture, with only an outline, or a few notes on slips; and the speaker must submit to inter jectory comments and discussion by the master and the other members of the class. Moreover, each student had the right to as much of Channing's individual attention as he wanted, including his personal advice on investigating the subject at hand and the method of presenting it. Hence his graduate students were trained in research and in teaching at the same time. The top student of each class was generally asked to be Channing's assistant in History 10, and the master's skill in gauging young men's ability is shown by the names of his assistants in five successive years: Carl Russell Fish, Henry A. Yeomans, Hiram Bingham, Everett Kimball, and Roland G. Usher. Channing's devotion to his students was one of his most endearing traits. His contacts with professional colleagues were not close or frequent; his scorn for slipshod or dis honest work, of which there is much in American history, led him to make sharp comments on fellow-workers in the field. But his own students were his friends for life. Both in college and after, they were free to break in on him at any moment, and without being made to feel that they were imposing on his time. The privilege was so much used that Channing had to discipline himself into resuming a train of thought after interruption, without loss of effort. If a student appeared in his corner of old Gore Hall, or before the glass door of Widener 417, the master would at once drop what he was doing, and after a preliminary glare of recognition, welcome the intruder with the utmost cordiality. It should be said,</page><page sequence="67">276 MASSACHUSETTS HISTORICAL SOCIETY [MAY however, that Channing was not one to suffer fools gladly. The shy boy who had good stuff in him was kindly encour aged and drawn out; but the windbag was quickly deflated by piercing sarcasm, and the hopeless dullard was sent quickly on his way, by no means rejoicing. As a teacher of undergraduates, in this period 1897 to 1912, Channing was not so conspicuously successful. He did not warm to the " college student " as such. He sympathized with President Eliot's desire to reduce the length of the col lege course, and enjoyed shocking people by declaring that Harvard College ought to be suppressed or moved out into the country where it would not interfere with the proper work of the University. He was a " terror " to lazy students, and asked in his examinations the sort of question that searched out what a man did not know, rather than giving him an op portunity to expand upon what he did know. But to students who were capable of sustained interest and work, he was encouraging and sympathetic. Around 1912, his attitude to ward the undergraduate suddenly mellowed. He became tolerant of the foibles and frailties of youth, and appeared to enjoy the brilliant if fashionable young men, rather than the earnest seekers after knowledge and grades. Interesting con troversial topics were assigned for the tests, thus making the reading "purposeful," as professional educators (for whom Channing had the greatest scorn) would say. He developed the faculty of driving home essential points with a touch of humor or turn of a phrase that left no doubt in the listener's mind as to what was meant, and although he still presented history in the rough, it came to the boys as a humane and fas cinating subject which was just being opened up, in which there were countless avenues for fresh study. Further, he impressed the students as a cultured gentleman, representing the best traditions of New England and of the University; academic clowning was as alien to him as was academic pedan try. During the last fifteen years of his career, he was a great teacher of both graduates and undergraduates. This development was coincident with a shifting of his courses, as the " Great Work " advanced. When a given period had been written up in his History of the United States, Channing was no longer interested in it, and read no more on</page><page sequence="68">1931 ] EDWARD CHANNING 277 the subject. Hence it was fortunate that in 1910 the transla tion of Professor Hart to the Department of Government left the general introductory course in the history of the United States from 1760 to the present, open to Professor Channing, so that his undergraduate, as well as his graduate, teaching coincided with the period upon which he was doing research. One must emphasize this notable eminence of Channing as a teacher because of his equal eminence as a scholar, for the two qualities are popularly supposed to be mutually exclusive. In the periodical outbursts of college students against being taught by " Ph.D.'s " and " researchers," Channing, who was both, was apt to be held up as an example of what a teacher of undergraduates should be; yet the world knew him only as a scholar. His success as a teacher was due in great part to the fact that he was doing or had just done intensive research on the subject he was teaching. In part, it was due to his method of lecturing without any more notes than would go on a large visiting card. The evening before a lecture he would devote to preparation, going over in his mind what he would say, perhaps pulling down a few books to verify a fact or date; but never falling back on old lecture notes ? he kept none. Although Channing never slighted his duty as a teacher, he frankly considered his History of the United States the most important part of his work for the University and for poster ity. In 1899 the contract was signed for the History, which appeared in the following volumes and order: 1. " The Planting of a Nation in the New World, 1000 1660" (1905). n. "A Century of Colonial History, 1660-1760" (1908). in. "The American Revolution, 1761-1789" (1912). iv. "Federalists and Republicans, 1789-1815" (1917). v. " The Period of Transition, 1815-1848" (1921). vi. " The War for Southern Independence " (1925). In the preface to the first volume, Channing declared that he understood history in its larger sense as denoting not merely the annals of the past, but as describing the development of the American people. . . . The growth of the nation will, therefore, be treated as one continuous</page><page sequence="69">278 MASSACHUSETTS HISTORICAL SOCIETY [MAY . development from the political, military, institutional, industrial, and social points of view. . . . I have considered the colonies as parts of the English empire, as having sprung from that political fabric, and as having simply pur sued a course of institutional evolution unlike that of the branch of the English race which remained behind in the old homeland across the Atlantic. I have also thought that the most important single fact in our development has been the victory of the forces of union over those of particularism. It is essential that the forces and institutions which have made for disunion should be treated at length and in a sympathetic spirit; but it is even more necessary that the forces and institutions which have made for union should be constantly borne in mind and brought to the attention of the reader, for it is the triumph of these which has determined the fate of the nation. The guiding idea in the present work is to view the subject as the record of an evolution, and to trace the growth of the nation from the standpoint of that which preceded rather than from that which followed. In other words, I have tried to see in the annals of the past the story of living forces, always struggling onward and upward toward that which is better and higher in human concep tion. It is only in this way that justice can be done to the memo ries of those who have gone before and have left for us a splendid heritage. They treated the problems which arose in their time by the light of the age in which they lived. To estimate them by the conditions and ideas of the present day is to give a false picture to the reader and the student. This wholeness of view is one of the distinguishing char acteristics of Channing's History of the United States. Keenly mindful of the charge of provincialism which was con stantly (though in the main unjustly, as he thought) being brought against New England historians, he leaned over backwards to give other sections of the country and other points of view than the orthodox New England ones, their proper place; and he succeeded notably. In the colonial vol ume, the chapters on the southern and middle colonies are fully as interesting and as well-documented as those on New England. But even more striking are those chapters on commerce, education, literature, religion, and the like, of the country as a whole. In those he demonstrated his thesis, " that the most important single fact in our development has been the victory of the forces of union over those of par</page><page sequence="70">I93i] EDWARD CHANNING 2 79 ticularism." The frontier interpretation of American history never found favor with him ? possibly because he did not invent it ? and although he was one of those whose prompt action obtained for Harvard the distinguished services of Frederick J. Turner, he dearly loved to tease his colleague, as in the pages where he interpreted the election of Jackson as a victory for the South, having nothing to do with fron tierism. Loyalty never prevented Channing from seeing facts in a new light, or telling the truth as he found it. Although friend, cousin, nephew, and brother-in-law to Thomas Went worth Higginson,22 the abolitionist and colonel of a black regiment, Channing was perhaps the first New England his torian to put the abolitionists in their place, and to expose the hypocrisy and jobbery that accompanied the recruiting of the Massachusetts negro regiments. Indeed, Channing's most striking characteristic as an his torian was his ability to wipe his mind clear of preconceived interpretations and theories, even if he had been teaching them all his life; to study every question and period anew, from the sources, and to reach fresh conclusions. These con clusions were never so startling in print as in his lectures and conversation, for he had a great fund of common-sense, and the facts brought out in discussion were taken into account. But there is hardly an important question, from Jamestown to Appomatox, on which his views were orthodox. As he was thorough and earnest in his research, so he was candid and fearless in expressing his conclusions; but also he had the wisdom of the serpent. He told the story in such a way that readers were convinced without being aware that they had been argued with; the effect he wished to produce was ob tained by a careful array of facts, just as a painter produces his desired effect with form and color. In consequence, Chan ning, almost alone of contemporary scientific historians, never ran foul of the professional patriots. Channing carried out his promise to write the History from the original sources. He was constantly at work on primary material, both printed and in manuscript. He visited all parts 22 Thomas Wentworth Higginson married (1) Mary Channing, an aunt of Edward Channing, and (2) Mary Thacher, the sister of his wife. Both Chan ning and Higginson were descended from Stephen Higginson of the Essex Junto.</page><page sequence="71">28o MASSACHUSETTS HISTORICAL SOCIETY [MAY of the country in order to study the great manuscript collec tions; transcripts were made from foreign archives; pam phlets and the most obscure repositories of fact and opinion were sought out. The only source of which he made little use was the newspapers. He neglected these partly because the proper use of them would have doubled the necessary time for research; partly because McMaster had leaned so heavily on newspapers for his History of the American People, a work which Channing estimated very lightly. For his fourth and fifth volumes, this lack was a distinct loss. The enormous and increasing biographical and monographic material was pretty thoroughly ransacked and digested; but Channing considered it a waste of time tb read general histories of the United States by other authors. The effort put on a given problem never distorted his conception of its value, and the result of a long and arduous piece of research might be ex pressed in a single sentence, if he thought the result worth but that. It was not often, however, that his efforts were wasted, for he developed a very shrewd sense of how far and long it would be profitable to pursue a given bit of research. " The time comes when the historian must begin to make up his mind." 23 The moving finger of time was ever before him as he worked and wrote; he had what Carlyle called the " indis pensables t beauty in knowing how to get done." In form and style, the History of the United States is more suited to the student and teacher, than to the general reading public, although some of the volumes, notably the third and sixth, have had a wide public sale. Channing had no knack of vivid narrative or description, and his method of dictating rather than writing resulted in a rather formless, and occa sionally slipshod style. He was quite aware of this defect, and made no virtue of it; he simply did the best he could, and was ever urging his pupils to write better than he.24 But there 23 The Present State of Historical Writing in America (Worcester, 1910), 9. 24 "With the worker in colors, the novelist, and the poet, the historian must possess imagination. He must be able to picture to himself, in broad out line, the condition of a people at a given time, to see the march of armies, to recognize the inter-action of economic forces, and then to reproduce these im pressions with a lightness of touch that will make them readable and with a heaviness of detail that will make them convincing. In his presentation, he must seek to produce a truthful impression upon his reader. Oftentimes, to do this he must sacrifice absolute accuracy in detail and in perspective. If the</page><page sequence="72">1931 ] EDWARD CHANNING 281 is a dry humor and a personal flavor to the style which makes the work a favorite with students and readers seeking in formation and enlightenment rather than relaxation. The copious footnotes, and the appendixes on contentious ques tions, supply a guide to further research, as well as a history. The steady progress of the History was accomplished only by the most rigid economy of time, and the most persistent application to the task. Indeed it is quite as significant for Channing's life to remember some of the things which he did not do, as to state what he did do; for the time and energy saved from the one, in part made the other possible. Al though brought up a good Unitarian, he ceased to attend church around 1905, and never indulged in the modern forms of Sabbatarian observance; Sunday was needed for work. Although by way of becoming a professional book reviewer in 1883, he did not write a single book review after he began his teaching career: a record probably unique for an academic historian. Nor did he write letters to the newspapers point ing out other people's mistakes in matters of which he had ex pert knowledge, although liberal in such rectifications before students. He contributed no articles to popular or other magazines, if we except a brief appreciation of Justin Winsor and a few notes on the Virginia and Kentucky Resolves, in the American Historical Review, in. and xx. He attended very few meetings of the American Historical Association; none, I believe, between 1906 and 1919, when he was elected presi dent; and none since 1920, when he delivered his presidential address. With that exception, he accepted no office in any of the historical societies to which he was elected. He accepted no exchange professorships, although several times offered them, and delivered no extension or public lectures, except one course before the Lowell Institute. He no longer at tended meetings of our Society, except in answer to the mem bers' repeated demands to deliver an occasional paper, which was little more than a preliminary draft of a chapter of the impression produced upon his reader is truthful, it matters little whether all his dates are correct, all his names are properly spelled, or if all his facts are accu rate.

He delivered very few lectures outside Harvard University, and made no ad dresses at school or college commencements, Harvard gather ings, political conventions, teachers' associations, patriotic observances, centenaries, or other public or semi-public occa sions, where professors of American history are expected to be present and vocal. Consequently his name never became known to the larger public, like those of many contempora ries in the field. Consequently, too, he was able to concen trate on his life work of teaching, writing, and research, as few of his colleagues and contemporaries have had the time or the single-minded persistence to do. It was as a part of this race with time that Channing pre served, even cultivated, the gruff manner which had origi nally been a mask for his youthful shyness. He could be the most delightful of companions if he chose, but he did not often so choose. Once he had made up his mind to accept no invitations, social or otherwise, it saved time to be regarded as a hopeless prospect by the organizers of good causes, and as a social liability by Cambridge hostesses. Channing was much touched, so he told one of his old friends, by the dinner given in 1920 in honor of one " who had been nothing but an old bear all his life" ? but that dinner was organized by his former pupils, who knew little of the bearish quality, who rather regarded him as a kindly old centaur like Chiron, who 25 These papers were (i) " The American Board of the Commission of the Customs " in Proceedings, xim. 477-490 (1910). In this Channing called at tention to the importance of the Temple Papers in our Cabinet. He was in vited to prepare those papers for publication in our Collections, and to that end obtained many transcripts of important documents from the Public Record Office; but when near the point of publication, was told that there were no funds.

A., to Colonel Higginson, clearing up the alleged " Confederate atrocity," of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw's burial among his colored troops. He also contributed in 1906 to the Proceedings of the Ameri can Antiquarian Society, an article on Governor Thomas Dongan (n.s. xvm. 336-354), and in 1910 a most timely and significant paper " The Present State of Historical Writing in America" (n.s., xx. 427-434), which is also printed separately.</page><page sequence="74">1931] EDWARD CHANNING 283 might let them ride on his back for a while, but was chiefly concerned in preparing them for life. Since few persons other than his pupils ever got beyond the defensive and crusty armor, it should be said that Channing was really one of the kindest and most affectionate of friends, full of little acts of thoughtfulness and consideration. During the war, Channing generously took up some of his abandoned courses while his younger colleagues were in serv ice; but after 1919 he was regularly given leave of absence for half the year in order to get on with the History. Although as it progressed, the literature of his subject became con stantly vaster and more complex, he kept very close to his schedule, bringing out the fifth volume in 1921 and the sixth, "The War for Southern Independence," in 1925. This was his harvest season. He was elected President of the American Historical Association in 1919; in 19 21 he received the honor ary degree of LL.D. from Michigan; in 1926 a Litt.D. from Columbia, being elected a fellow of the American Academy the same year. Channing greatly enjoyed this public recogni tion, although it was both unsought and unexpected. He had never played academic politics, or catered to the critics, or courted favor from any man. Particularly grateful to him was the acclaim his sixth volume received from reviewers in the South and West, as the work of a Yankee come to judgment. When he reached his sixty-fifth birthday, in 1921, Chan ning was eligible for retirement from teaching; but his classes were as large and enthusiastic as ever; so freshly ran he on eight winters more. At the announcement of his coming re tirement, in the spring of 1929, his friends, colleagues, and former pupils conspired to have his portrait painted by Charles Hopkinson. The admirable painting, expressing Channing's unique combination of sauvagerie and friendli ness, was unveiled in University Hall by his little grandson, John Channing Fuller, and received in the name of the Uni versity by President Lowell. On that occasion, when many were present to express their devotion and affection, Channing radiated benevolence. After the publication of the volume on the Civil War, there came a gradual slowing-down of the historian's pace. Retire ment from teaching left him more time for research, but re</page><page sequence="75">284 MASSACHUSETTS HISTORICAL SOCIETY [MAY moved part of the stimulus ; and the seventh volume, although already overdue, was still unfinished when the end came. To the last, he appeared to most people his usual ruddy and healthy self; but to his family and closest friends there seemed to be a distinct slackening of his mental and physical powers from the year 1929. He did not attend the Boston convention of the American Historical Association on the last three days of 1930, nor did he feel equal to receiving many of the old friends and pupils who then wished to call and pay their respects. On Tuesday, January 6, 1931, he was in his Widener study until lunch time, working as usual over the manuscript of Volume vn. That night he was taken suddenly ill. It proved to be a cerebral hemorrhage; and after the ad ministering of an anaesthetic he did not recover conscious ness, but passed away on the morning of January 7. Channing accomplished what no man had done before, and what is not likely to be done again. Between his fortieth and his seventieth year, with his own hand, and from his own re search, he wrote a great history of the United States from the beginning of colonization to the close of the Civil War. In the meantime, he trained scores of men to carry on the work in his own spirit of thorough and fearless inquiry; and to thousands more he imparted a love of our country's history, based on knowledge. For this he sacrificed much that men hold dear; but gained what was more dear to him: recogni tion, and affection. The little motherless boy, who for want of a companion created an imaginary " Mr. Dowdy," died a ripe scholar of seventy-four, the head of his profession.</page></plain_text>
