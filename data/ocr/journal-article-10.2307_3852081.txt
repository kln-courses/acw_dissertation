<plain_text><page sequence="1">JAMES McCONKEY Stories from My Life with the Other Animals I. Americans in Italy Two decades ago, my wife, Jean, and I and two of our sons?Jimmy, who was nine, and Cris, who was seventeen? spent a year in Italy. We lived in a spacious second-floor apartment in a villa that was surrounded by olive trees, grape? vines, and hillside fields but yet was within walking distance of downtown Florence. The owners of the villa?an Italian and his English-born wife?and their children occupied most of the large sixteenth-century stone dwelling. We thought of the wife as our landlady, since she handled the business operations of the house and its land, supervising what, without any self- consciousness at all, she called its "peasants"?the couple who lived in the gate house and maintained the lawns and flower gardens, and the other couple who lived in the casa colonica, a farmhouse separated by a patio from the villa itself, and did the agricultural work. It was difficult to tell the age of the farming couple; the husband appeared to be considerably older than his wife, and I first mistook him to be the grandfather of his two young children. Her many years in Italy had made our landlady, both in gestures and attitude, more Italian?or so it seemed to Jean and me?than many of the lifelong residents of Florence whom we met. When she gave us the key to our apartment, she told us that if police or other city officials paid us a call, we were to tell them that we were "exchange" visitors who paid no rent directly in money but instead were offering our house in the United States to members of her family; for she wished to avoid the municipal tax on our rent. We considered the rent remarkably modest, and were willing to pay more to cover the tax and thus to avoid any possible penalties to her. "Oh, no, no, no," she said,</page><page sequence="2">38 THE HUDSON REVIEW vigorously shaking her head; it was obvious that, unaware of local customs, we were impugning her skill at constructing socially expected stratagems. "The government adds fifteen percent to the regular taxes," she told us. "This is to cover cheating, which, as you can see, is therefore legal, up to a certain point. Occasionally an inspector checks our dustbins, to determine if we have any foreign renters; but he knows as well as I that Maria [she was the woman who lived in the gate house] daily burns the garbage of our renters." She also told us that one of the villa cats, given the English name of Monster, considered our apartment his home, and would expect us to feed him. In our farmhouse in the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York, dogs and cats (usually several of each species) lived with us, and on winter mornings Jean and I often woke up to find most of them snuggled up next to us; it sometimes seemed to me they had an unfair advantage over our two horses in the unheated barn we had built for them. I felt as much affection for the horses? particularly for the quarter horse, Smokey, whom we had bought when he was a colt small enough to put his head on my shoulder, as he followed me about in the paddock?as I did for the household pets, and in the earlier years of our life in that farmhouse, mature adult though I assumed myself to be, sometimes wakened on particularly cold mornings to a pleasur? able fantasy that put all of our animals in bed with Jean and me. During our year in Italy, our oldest son, Larry, who was a senior at Cornell, had remained at home, living in the farm? house with other students; he had promised to care for the domestic animals as well as to feed the birds once the snows came. He was a responsible son, and had listened carefully to all my instructions?including my warning to him to fill the bird feeder with seed only around midnight, and to do it as quietly as he could. The reason for such stealth was to prevent Tammy, Smokey's stablemate, from seeing or hearing him at the bird feeder; for if she did, that mare surely would jump the top paddock rail and eat all the seed before setting off down the road. In Florence, I realized how much I missed feeding and other chores that I had sometimes considered irksome, as well as the idiosyncrasies of each of our animals; and so was glad to have a surrogate for at least our cats.</page><page sequence="3">JAMES McCONKEY 39 Monster, though, never provided us with much companion? ship. Despite his name, he was a scrawny little animal; the name was the result of a missing ear, torn hair, scars, and continual fresh wounds. The most severe of these injuries had been inflicted upon him by his worst enemy, a vicious tomcat from the neighboring villa who claimed the territory as his own, the rest of them by the other cats who lived with our landlady and her family in a relationship quite different from the one we had with our animals. Except for the occasions on which these cats were discovered using the shelf above the kitchen cabinets for their personal bathroom and would be chased out of the house for a few minutes, they were treated with the tolerance that is another name for indifference; it was as if they were visited upon the family by a fate its members had to accept as well as they could. In consequence, the cats never to my knowledge asked for affection, never engaged in activities designed to please their owners, never showed off in the manner our cats always have. (For example, Fearless Fosdick, one of our present cats, climbs a backyard tree only while guests are sitting in the lawn chairs beneath it, and continually looks down to note their alarm or consternation as she?Fearless Fosdick is aptly named except for her sex?edges out farther and farther on a limb bending under her weight.) Perpetually wounded pariah among cats though he might have been, Monster was as indifferent to humans as any other cat on the villa grounds. He spent his days lurking on the roof tiles, coming down only to be fed. As an Italian cat, he spurned milk or the chicken giblets Jean several times cooked for him; he had an appetite only for huge plates of spaghetti, which he preferred with cheese and tomato sauce. Whenever our cats desire milk, they alter their conventional miaow?or so it has always seemed to me?to make it approximate that English word; the only sound that ever came from Monster was a brusque but self-satisfied "ciao" after he finished his plate and headed for the door. Perhaps, in the interval between renters in which he may have scavenged upon the remains of rodents or birds left by the more aggressive cats, he had ingested parasites; in any event, several months into our stay, he began to lose his appetite, and finally died from a massive infestation of worms. (We repeatedly told our landlady that he had stopped eating his</page><page sequence="4">40 THE HUDSON REVIEW spaghetti, but such news led her only to that well-known Italian gesture of helplessness, a shrug accompanied by hands raised palms-up. When at last, observing herself how feeble he was, she rushed him off to a veterinarian in remorse, Monster was too far gone to be saved.) One shouldn't generalize about the attitudes toward animals of Italians on the basis of a single family, especially a family with an English wife and mother, I know; all that I can say is that this family had a much more casual relationship with their pets than I did. Still, that casual attitude was but a step removed from the callousness of other Italians to animals outside the household, for by and large they seemed to regard them simply as objects for sport or consumption. Though the husband who lived in the farmhouse was pleased, for the sake of his children, to be given the little potted evergreen decorated with miniature lights with which we had celebrated an advance Christmas (we spent the actual holiday in Sicily), he was insensitive enough to kill a rabbit for his family's dinner by thrusting a pointed stick through its eye and into the brain while Jimmy and one of his school friends were admiring all of the rabbits he kept in cages. Apparently it never occurred to him that such a killing, accompanied by a shriek from the rabbit, might be such a psychic shock to an American nine-year-old that he would have nightmares for weeks. And I was almost equally appalled by the slaughter of songbirds by Italian males who, unlike that peasant, were prosperous enough to afford guns and ammunition. We had taken rooms in the major hotel at Assisi?the lovely Umbrian hill town that had been home to St. Francis, famous for his love of birds and other wildlife?for the Easter weekend; at dawn on Sunday, we were awakened by a great blasting of shotguns, for just beyond our window, which overlooked the town wall and the woods beyond, the hunting hordes were mercilessly shoot? ing at everything that peeped or fluttered. During the weeks of the migration of birds from Africa to Italy, the meat counter of the supermercato we patronized in Florence displayed row upon row of bits of fluff, from each of which extended a limp neck and a little head with frozen beak and lidded eyes. Shooting as they came, hunters marched through the villa groves and fields; soon the pervasive migrant melody was stilled, leaving</page><page sequence="5">JAMES McCONKEY 41 only the song of the pair of nightingales that lived in the bushes by the little family chapel. Though hunters sought out night? ingales as a special delicacy, our landlady said that they were apt to survive longer than other birds because at least some of them had the good sense to nest in thick shrubbery close to houses? but here, of course, the cats eventually got them. Occasionally we had dinner at Omero's, a restaurant on our side of the Arno; it was on the crest of a hill not far from the Torre del Gallo, where Galileo built his telescope and made his astronomical observations. To provide guests with a fine vista of Florence and the Arno valley, the proprietor had put the dining room in the rear of the building; diners entered the restaurant through a storeroom door, making a passage be? neath the cured hams and other meats hanging from ceiling hooks. Remote from the conventional tourist routes, Omero's served good food at reasonable prices and attracted (we were told) young actors, artists, and clothing designers?something that seemed to us probably true, since a majority of the diners were in their twenties or thirties, many of them fashionably dressed, and nearly all of them wore dark glasses even at night. One evening at Omero's, we had a misunderstanding with our waiter that, while based on language, surely was connected with a difference in cultural assumptions about animals. No? body in our family could finish the unusually generous serv? ings; enough remained on our plates to provide us with a meal at home the following day. Did we have the temerity to ask our waiter to put it in a container? In America one asks for a doggie bag, and I thought such a euphemism might be customary in much of the world?and certainly would be understood at a restaurant like Omero's. As our waiter, who spoke some English, cleared the table for dessert, I asked him if we could have a doggie bag. uChe cosa?" he asked, puzzled. I was the only member of my family not studying Italian at one school or another. Cris, who was enrolled in several classes at the British Institute, was farther along in the language than was Jean, who took a class in Italian for foreigners at the University of Florence, or Jimmy, a student at a day school for American children. "Un saco," Cris said, pointing to the food on each of our plates. The waiter remained bewildered. "Non capisco," he said.</page><page sequence="6">42 THE HUDSON REVIEW uPer il cane" Cris said. "Un saco per il cane}" The phrase obviously made no sense to him. While the waiter watched intently, Cris went through a pantomime: he opened an invisible bag and, lifting first one plate and then another, pretended to push food into it with a knife. "Capisco" the waiter cried, striking his brow with his hand as illumination came. At first, it wasn't clear to us what that insight consisted of, since he didn't give us a doggie bag with the check. Perhaps, in Italy, domestic animals are unlikely to be treated as members of the family, and who could think that a bag for the dog could really be intended for people? The waiter must have assumed that we had gone into animal husbandry in a big American way on a Tuscan estate; for, as we were preparing to enter our car, he staggered out of the restaurant after us with two huge plastic bags filled with the day's kitchen scrapings. He smiled so radiantly for being of such assistance to us in providing food for our pigs or other farm animals if not for a kennel filled with ravenous hunting dogs that I couldn't tell him we didn't want all that garbage, and not even Cris had the facility with the language to explain that Maria, the gatekeeper's wife, would be furious with us for making her build a fire huge enough to incinerate all of those scrapings in order to prevent the officials from arresting our landlady for renting out her villa to a horde of tourists without paying the proper tax. As it was, I opened the trunk, and would have helped him lift the bags into it had he not waved me off; I even offered him an additional tip, which he?possessor of an Italian generosity of soul?refused. Hoping to find a rubbish bin into which we might furtively dispose of our garbage, I drove slowly back to our villa; but Italians are too canny to leave any such receptacles near the curb. For several days, dark smoke rose from the hidden area where Maria burned our garbage; though she was normally a friendly woman, she muttered and shook her head when I encountered her by our door, and it was a week or two before she again smiled and waved at us as we passed the gate house. In general, Italians are a warm-hearted people, the men as</page><page sequence="7">JAMES McCONKEY 43 well as the women showing an understanding of, and affection for, anybody's babies and young children that far exceeds my own. But I met only two Italians who treated their domestic animals as comrades; these Italians seemed like Americans, and their example made me yearn for home. During that year-long residency in Florence, I became conscious for the first time in my life that the value I found in animals was part of the particular culture I had been born into. II. My Bird The eleventh edition of The Encyclopedia Britannica, one that humanists value over subsequent editions for its subjective judgments on all sorts of quirky topics, says of the mockingbird (a native American species) that while there is little about the bird's physical appearance "beyond its graceful form to recom? mend it," its melody possesses "a varied range and liquid fullness of tone that are unequalled, according to its admirers, even by those of the nightingale." Several years after our return from Florence, a pair of mockingbirds made a journey farther north and west than is customary for the species to nest in foliage near our house. In the mornings, the male would perch on the chimney serving the Franklin stove in my study, his melody coming down the flue to resonate in the metal belly of that stove. Later in the Encyclopedia Britannica article, the author proves himself to be one of the bird's admirers by saying outright that its melody far surpasses that of "its European rival," a judgment that struck me as wholly true, as I compared the song of my mockingbird with that of the nightingale cock in Italy, whose melancholic gurglings had seemed to me an acknowledgment of impending demise. While plagiarizing at will from the work of others in the manner of all self-confident artists, my bird, through improvi? sation and surprising combinations, ended up with composi? tions totally his own. By making not the nightingale's but the mockingbird's melody a metaphor for the creative faculty, I put myself one up on Keats. I came to expect that morning serenade, which gave me the emotional kick?and more than that, the hubris?I needed for the day's work.</page><page sequence="8">44 THE HUDSON REVIEW But one morning the melody stopped. On the front porch, I discovered my favorite cat, Lucifer, sitting next to the gift offering she had left me?the severed head of my favorite bird. She ceased being my favorite cat at that instant. I chased that cat around the house maybe three times, vainly burrowing after her into the bushes. For the remainder of that long summer, the surviving mate spent her hours on the back yard power line, singing over and over a dirge?several notes, monotonously repeated, that drifted into my study through the open window. "Damn you, listen to that," I cried to Lucifer, whenever she stood at the study door in a cautious test of the emotional waters within. My work at the desk most of the summer was not very productive. It occurred to me, one sultry afternoon, that the casual or indifferent attitude of Italians toward animals is in some ways preferable to my own attempt at a more intimate kinship. Such an insight didn't grant me an Italian insouciance toward cats, but it did permit me to welcome Lucifer back into the good graces of the family and to get on with the task at hand. III. Anthropomorphism Some months back, my local newspaper, The Ithaca Journal, carried a feature story about a Cornell veterinarian who spe? cializes in animal behavior. According to that article, she often finds the key to a pet's behavior problem in its owner. While animals share with humans such emotions as "fear, courage, trust, love, hatred, aggression," humans and their pets may have different responses to any given situation. She is quoted as saying that veterinarians in the animal behavior clinic at Cornell "try to look at the way an animal interacts with its owner," and frequently discover that owners "are anthropomorphic, mean? ing they try to give their animals the same values they have." The observation seems unexceptional: you need to find out the reason that a cat pisses on the rug instead of getting angry at it for doing something you don't, even as you shouldn't expect a cat to know that the bird it killed was a metaphor to you. As an owner of pets for more than sixty years, though, I</page><page sequence="9">JAMES McCONKEY 45 think the comment implies too sweeping an indictment of anthropomorphism. Perhaps because of an early incident that led to a bonding between animal and owner, some pets seem to want to be considered human. Animals and humans have the same biological drives; animals are simply more transparent in demonstrating them. (Scoldings, threats, strong ropes, and even locked doors failed to keep Ben, an Irish setter my family once owned, from consummation of his sexual desires; on one occasion, he dug out a large foundation stone to reach a neighbor's bitch locked in the basement, on another he leaped with virile abandon through an expensive stained glass window of a house a mile from his own. When an official of the S.P.C.A. recommended castration, I felt a pain in my own testicles.) Furthermore, I believe that an animal and a human some? times do share identical attitudes toward an experience; that the animal can communicate such attitudes to a person through intimate eye contact as well as through body language; and that, once expressed, those attitudes can form the basis of a lifetime of understanding between the pair. As best as I can describe in words a communication that is wholly visual, the intelligence that passes from animal to human is based on humor and tolerance; it is as if the animal understands that he and his human companion are engaged in a friendly conspiracy. Until Tammy, his beloved stablemate, died of old age, Smokey (wall-eyed though horses are) frequently communi? cated that sort of message to me. As a mischievous young horse, Smokey acted as if he intended to bite my arm whenever I slipped a rubber pail of grain under the bottom rail of his stall; to outwit him, I would pretend to put it in the stall, and as he came for the grain (or my flesh) I would quickly place the bucket in the space outside the stall. My strategy became part of a game we played together: he would warily wait between the two possible positions, while I made a feint with the bucket toward one or the other. But would he really bite me if I left my arm exposed as he rushed toward the bucket, baring his great teeth? One morning, after engaging in the customary feints, I left my arm in a vulnerable position, just above the bucket. He bared his teeth?and, after delicately nipping my skin, nuzzled my arm and then licked it with his leathery tongue. Before</page><page sequence="10">46 THE HUDSON REVIEW bending his head into the grain bucket, he gave me for the first time that friendly and conspiratorial look. Tammy died in the neighboring stall one day. She weighed half a ton; it took a couple of pulleys attached to barn beams and a winch-equipped truck to remove the body. Jean and I managed to entice the nervous Smokey into the pasture, shutting the gate connecting it with the paddock and barn and covering the fence with blankets, in a vain attempt to keep him from seeing the body being slowly dragged toward the truck. Despite such tactics, Smokey held me accountable for the loss. Before the death, he would whinny when I approached the paddock with a carrot or apple. After Tammy's body was trucked away, he not only didn't whinny, he refused to take the food. He even turned his head away: he simply would not look at me. A year passed before he would accept anything from my hand. But our games belong wholly to the past, and his eyes now tell me nothing at all. Were Smokey and I to have a consultation with the animal behaviorist at the Cornell clinic because of my complaint that my old horse no longer communicates with me, she might consider me an egregious example of anthropomorphism. Is it possible that all along I only imagined an intelligent, if purely visual, understanding between Smokey and me that had formed the basis of a relationship? Had I only imagined that now and then I had seen the same look of conspiratorial friendship in nearly all the animals I've known since childhood? Like a trust in God or in the unity underlying everything in the phenomenal universe, one's belief in such a matter resists conclusive proof. I can only say that whenever I see that look, my memory carries me back to an incident in my childhood that?at least for me?validates its truth. In this memory, I am eleven years old, lying on my stomach outside the side door of a marvelous house in a new addition? called Normandy by its developers?of Little Rock; recently, my father, a traveling salesman, has deserted my mother, my brother, and me for a widow in San Antonio. It is a sunny day of a long summer during one of the years of the Great Depression, and my father has sent us too little money. Soon the three of us and my dog?a black German shepherd named Bruin by my mother, since as a puppy he resembled a bear</page><page sequence="11">JAMES McCONKEY 47 cub?will have to leave that house, which is being repossessed, to drive a thousand miles north, where we will arrive, without advance warning, at the home of some relatives. Bruin was my father's last gift to me before his betrayal of his family. The ground is pleasantly warm on my belly on this day. Bruin is standing above me, ready for a little game we play that always makes my mother angry at both of us, for it often ends up with a rip in my pants that she will have to mend. It's not much of a game, really: I give a little ass-wiggle, and Bruin? already an unusually large and strong dog, even for a German shepherd?attempts to lift me up by the seat of my pants. On this occasion, I give the customary sign and he obediently tugs at my pants. Suddenly, though, he lets me drop and assumes an innocent sitting posture at my side. I look up to see my mother's face above us, at the kitchen window. Apparently sharp-eyed Bruin has seen her before she has noticed what we have been up to; instead of scolding us, she smiles and waves. I sit up, facing Bruin; his eyes are friendly and intelligent, full of the knowledge of our conspiracy. To share such a secret with a loyal companion gives me great happiness: it is happiness of the sort I imagine I would feel if, waking in the middle of the night, I heard my father's car once more turning into the driveway. Whatever anthropomorphism I can be accused of has its source in this moment. IV. Goats as a Test of Human Character Larry, who is forty, and my namesake Jim, who is thirty, both live in New York City, where both are employed in film; Cris, the middle son, now works at Cornell, as do Jean and I, and shares the large farmhouse with us. Cris returned home a number of years ago because we had fields available for the six goats he had just purchased?the nucleus of a herd he needed for the goat milk and cheese he hoped to produce. At the time he was working the night shift at Morse Chain in Ithaca, and dreaming of a more pastoral vocation. The goat barn that he built, one with a milking parlor and a large processing room as well as eating and sleeping quarters for the forty-odd goats he ultimately owned, now stands vacant, at the far end of the</page><page sequence="12">48 THE HUDSON REVIEW grassy field that constitutes our back yard; for the financial returns from that enterprise were never enough to allow him to quit his factory job, and the dairy work was too time-consuming to permit him to continue with it while holding down a full-time job. Goats may not have memories as long-lasting and detailed as those of horses, who remember not only deaths but some? thing as mundane as a random route they once were directed to take through a woods; nevertheless, goats are more canny in their utilization of past experiences. As a two-year-old, Smokey felt the sting of the electric fence surrounding his pasture, and consequently he has never attempted to get beyond that bar? rier, though the charger has been disconnected for maybe a decade; on the other hand, Cris's goats soon figured out that the electricity pulsed through the wires, and scrambled at will through the fence in the interval between pulses. Within a week of the arrival of the first goats, we lost to them a small orchard of young apple trees which just were beginning to bear their first fruit; within the month we lost the long row of lilac bushes bordering the farm road leading to our barns and the old apple orchard?now mainly taken over by walnuts?beyond. Today, two blue spruces in the back yard still carry the hourglass shape sculpted into them by goats standing on their hind legs to browse upon the succulent branches. But goats?especially the kids?are endearing creatures, and their damage never vexed Jean or me very long. Not even Cris, whatever his labor and ultimate disappointment, regretted the four years that goats shared our lives as well as our efforts at landscaping. One winter eleven kids were born, and the barn, despite heat lamps, was so cold that early each morning Cris, whose shift ended at midnight, brought two or three into the house, sometimes after assisting the mother in a particularly difficult birth. We kept them in the kitchen, the only room with a linoleum floor. At 7:00 a.m., while Cris slept, Jean and I fed them with nursing bottles and then watched them frolic about the room for half an hour or so before we put them back into a makeshift pen in the corner of the room and mopped up the floor. Cris developed an affection toward his herd, including a love for its littler creatures; but anybody who raises goats?or cows,</page><page sequence="13">JAMES McCONKEY 49 for that matter?as part of a dairy operation would be incapa? ble of continuing were he or she to impart to them human attributes. By and large, male kids are economically useless and must be slaughtered; insufficiently productive females must be culled from the herd. Because the milk is intended for sale or for the production of cheeses, kids must be immediately taken from their mothers and weaned to a bottle: once they get nourishment from the udder, it is difficult to convince them to suckle from a nursing bottle containing a milk replacement. Even the first fluid from the udder?the protection-giving colostrum?must be given by bottle. Cris learned much about goat husbandry from three veteran goat raisers. He bought his initial goats from a locally-famous psychic or witch whose hands had become too arthritic for her to continue milking, and soon he became a friend of a long- married couple from Colombia who had bought a small farm overlooking Ithaca for the purpose of operating a large-scale goat dairy?eventually they had a herd of over two hundred animals. On the basis of my own limited experience with these three people, I decided that goat raisers are unusual people. The psychic had a confidence in her occult powers to abet her handling of animals as well as humans. ("Did you do that?" her husband asked her in anger, on the night that the television set, a source of controversy between them, blew up. She told me about this incident?leaving her husband's question unan? swered?on a hot Sunday afternoon as she was using the forked branch of a sapling to find us a new water supply, since our well had proved inadequate to the thirst of Cris's growing herd: a well drilled at the spot she indicated hit an underground, if slightly sulfurous, Mississippi.) Though they were in their seventies, the Colombian couple still practiced yoga, and often were standing on their heads on those early mornings that Cris arrived with a problem about goats. Successful goat raisers obviously were able to combine attach? ment with non-attachment, subjectivity with objectivity, affec? tion with a businesslike attitude?a mental approach that seemed to combine Italian attitudes toward animals with my own, and that, whatever its metaphysical catalyst, was the only practical way to handle creatures that are cunning in both senses of the word. Cris had the required intuitive knack. Still,</page><page sequence="14">50 THE HUDSON REVIEW he continually told me, as if in reminder to himself, that to avoid hassle and heartbreak with animals, you simply couldnt consider them to be like people?advice similar to that later offered by the animal behaviorist at Cornell. Only once, to my knowledge, did he violate that injunction, and it came near the end of his dairy enterprise, in a moment of exhaustion. How does one whose hours are limited find the time and the energy to milk goats and market that milk, to experiment with methods of making various exotic cheeses, to treat the ailments of the herd, to serve as midwife during difficult births? In his attempt to cope, Cris for a time brought a partner into the business, a young woman who took over the milking as well as the decisions concerning which goats to keep, and in addition hired a part-time helper, an exceptionally gentle young man. On a Saturday night in early spring, several kids were born, with Cris and his helper in attendance. At midnight, as Jean and I were preparing for bed, Cris ran into the house in great distress, shouting, "I just injured a kid!" Cornell has clinics for both large and small animals; "large," though, includes all livestock, and so its veterinarians treat sheep and goats as well as horses and cows and an occasional lion or elephant. Cris called the large animal clinic's emergency number. None of the veterinarians who had treated his goats in the past was on duty that night, but Cris was known and liked by them. The call was transferred to the home of one of the goat specialists, and he agreed to be waiting at the clinic when Cris arrived with the newborn kid. After he made the call, Cris told us what had happened. He and his helper were trying to get the kids to nurse from bottles. While his back was turned, his helper?whose kid was resisting the plastic nipple?decided it was in their mutual welfare to let it nurse in the way intended by nature. Cris took the kid from the mother, and for half an hour tried unsuccessfully to coax it to take the colostrum from the bottle. Finally, in frustration with his helper, the kid, and perhaps the whole bloody business, he roughly shoved the kid from his lap. It hit the wall, and couldn't walk. Perhaps its hindquarters were paralyzed, per? haps there was a spinal injury. Most of us have felt such impulses; with our own children, we resist them as best we can. In his remorse, Cris had exaggerated</page><page sequence="15">JAMES McCONKEY 51 both his violence and the injury; the kid was not seriously hurt. Actually, the event provided me with one of the most emotion? ally rewarding moments in my experience. I accompanied Cris in his pickup truck to the clinic, holding on my lap the cardboard box whch contained the kid and the soft rags cushioning it against bumps. A mixture of rain and soft snow was falling, making it hard to see. The doors of the clinic were immense enough to permit the entry of the largest truck. Inside, it seemed a gigantic and immaculate barn, brightly illuminated. For some reason, a veterinarian, his white coat stained with blood or manure, was marching a cow back and forth. A blue-jeaned young woman was sleeping on some hay outside a stall; apparently the crisis with her horse was over, for the animal was peacefully munching. From another stall, a bull gazed at us. He was as immobile as the bronze memorial statue of a horse enclosed by a fence I once had seen in a Kentucky pasture. Cris's veterinarian, a slender man in his middle years who had donned a freshly laundered white coat, watched us ap? proach down the major aisle, which, lined by the stalls and with the roof trusses above, reminded me of a cathedral nave. Cris put the little box at his feet. The veterinarian bent over the kid, lifting it from the box to observe its attempt to walk. He gently probed the animal's hindquarters with his fingers. Only one rear leg now seemed to drag, and the kid was able to put weight even on that one. "What happened?" the veterinarian asked. Cris said, "She wouldn't suckle from the bottle. I got angry, and threw her against the wall." If I had been in my son's position, I would have prefaced that confession with all the extenuating circumstances I could think of. It's possible I might even have lied, saying, Maybe a horse stepped on it, or I just don't know what happened. The veterinarian looked at Cris, his eyes (I thought) unusually kind. "That kind of thing happens more often than you probably realize," he said. "Your kid is luckier than most; it was just a minor dislocation, and the joint's back in place." I was astonished. "You fixed it, that fast?" "As you can see, it wasn't much of a problem," the veterinar? ian said. "By tomorrow the limp should be gone."</page><page sequence="16">52 THE HUDSON REVIEW A smiling, gray-haired woman encountered us just outside the clinic door. Despite the hour, she had come to see the progress of some animal of hers?a cow or a sheep. Cris had dispensed with the box, and was holding the kid in his arms. The outside floodlight illuminated all of us, and the falling snow as well. "What a cute kid!" the woman exclaimed, fondling its ears. And to me she said, "Your jacket is so handsome!" It was made of a beige-colored plastic and had a rip under one arm; I had bought it long ago at Woolworth's. But the wet plastic did look attractive in the glow of the floodlight, and I've remembered the praise of that jacket as a kind of benedic? tion?as if I were an aging father and maybe grandparent who had been blessed in an unusual way. V. Spiritual Love In my childhood, the stars and planets burned much more brightly in the night sky than they do now. Atmospheric pollution accounts for much, but not all, of the difference, for some of it is subjective. When I was eight or nine, my parents bought for me and my older brother, Jack, a children's ency? clopedia, Our Wonder World, that contained many conundrums, examples of word play, and the like; among the many illustra? tions were the first large photographs I had seen of star clusters and of planets in our solar system. In Little Rock during that first summer of my father's departure, I was fascinated by those photographs and by the text that accompanied them; as eve? ning came on, Bruin and I would lie together on the lawn of that house in Normandy we were destined to leave, and I would tell him about the Martian canals, the moons of Jupiter, the rings around Saturn, the speed of light, and the nature of the universe. Whether he ever saw the Milky Way, I don't know; but on occasions he obediently looked skyward, and I could see unknown stars reflected in his dark eyes. I've heard it said of passionate love that it is narcissistic; that is to say, the lover does not see the beloved as she or he truly is, but as a mirror of the lover's own spiritual desires, as a manifestation of idealistic yearnings. To discover an analogy between the love potion that drew Tristan to Iseult in doomed</page><page sequence="17">JAMES McCONKEY 53 passion and the moment of shared understanding that linked me to Bruin may be an absurd reduction of a major myth of Western civilization, but my delusion was at least of the same kind as Tristan's: grand animal though he was, Bruin for me became more than an animal or human can ever be. My anthropomorphic error was not one of imputing my own responses to him, but of making him a representation of an ideal beyond my grasp?something perhaps rationally less difficult to do with an animal than with a person, which may account for the deification of animals in early cultures, not only in Egypt but throughout a human world still in close contact with a natural one. Our attitudes toward animals change with our own altering views toward much else, and mine have changed with the inevitable ebbing of the once insatiable wanting that sometimes makes an unholy?and perhaps uniquely American?trinity of soul, sex, and possessions. For decades, though, Bruin reigned as such a major myth figure in my personal animal kingdom that I wanted any new animal to be as much like him as possible. The dog that we currently own, a black Labrador retriever- German shepherd mix named Gandolf, was a gift from Cris's former goat partner, who was leaving Ithaca for California. When the dog was offered to us by telephone, I said I probably didn't want it, but upon seeing Gandy, I immediately decided that we should take her?simply because her ears, when she raised them in alert attention, were black sails identical to those of Bruin, dead for fifty years. After my mother, brother, and I had to leave Normandy, I feared I might be forced to give up Bruin. My mother's sister and her husband took us into their home in Lakewood, Ohio, and allowed the dog to sleep in the basement. I punished his every indiscretion, not only out of fear that his misbehavior might cause his exile, but also because such misbehavior was not in keeping with the expectations of my love. Once, by a confectionary store at the corner of Madison and McKinley Avenues, Bruin picked a fight with a much smaller dog, and I hit him so severely that a woman stopped her car to shout at me, "If you strike that magnificent animal one more time, I'll call the police!" Her accusation of brutality shocked me, for it was nothing but love that had made me treat him like that. She</page><page sequence="18">54 THE HUDSON REVIEW didn't know that in Little Rock I had protected Bruin from exhaustion by keeping him in the house whenever I knew my brother intended to practice with golf clubs or rifle, for Bruin was ever eager to retrieve objects, and his hearing and eyesight were so acute that he could return with every golf ball, and once (my brother said) even found the tree in which a bullet was embedded. Nor did that woman know that Bruin would never repeat a transgression I had punished him for. In Arkansas, while we were companions on a long walk, Bruin had outraged me by killing a chicken. He saw a flock of chickens in an unfenced yard, sent them into a frenzy by rushing at them before I could tell him to stop, and shook one dead in his mouth. He dropped the corpse during my homeward pursuit of him. I hit and scolded him before locking him in the garage, and withheld his supper. Subsequently, whenever we passed the yard with the chickens, he crossed to the other side of the street, to be as far from temptation as he could get. In my fifteenth year, my mother and I accompanied my brother to Flint, Michigan, for he had been admitted to General Motors Institute, where students could earn an engineering degree while getting practical experience as well as a salary by working in one of the numerous General Motors plants then located in Flint. The only apartment we could afford was on the second floor of a downtown house whose landlady forbade pets. My father's sister and her husband, who lived in Wester- ville, Ohio, agreed to take Bruin. My brother made a sturdy wooden box in accordance with Railway Express instructions; but it was I who betrayed Bruin by coaxing him into it. He gave me a pleading look, but obeyed me. "Now, go get the form from your mother so we can leave," one of the two Railway Express employees said to me. "What form?" the other one asked; I knew from the question that it was a kindly ruse to keep me from seeing a boxed and frightened Bruin being lifted into the truck. I stood at the hall window by the staircase leading to our apartment long after the truck disappeared. When my uncle and aunt picked up Bruin at the Railway Express office?they had to come for him, for the company refused to deliver him by truck?they found a snarling and dehydrated animal whose box was plastered with cautionary signs: apparently he had bitten a handler en route, and</page><page sequence="19">JAMES McCONKEY 55 afterwards was not given either food or water. As I knew from their letters, my relatives grew to respect Bruin's intelligence and bravery. The most remarkable instance of these was his rescue of the neighbor's dog, a small female, that had fallen into a creek swollen by the spring rains. My uncle wrote that Bruin saved her by jumping into the torrent, grabbing her by the neck fur, and swimming with her to safety. That sounded like a fictional exploit in a novel about Lassie: could it really be true? Yes, since Bruin, my admirable dog, was the savior. But Bruin, through this exploit and others, became my uncle's admirable dog. I was to see him again only once, and not until he was old and I a college junior. My uncle and aunt had moved to a suburb of Akron, and I was visiting them in their new home. My uncle was away on a trip the day I came, and Bruin and my aunt met me at the door of a tidy two-story house. Bruin's ears were up, the two black sails separated by puzzled furrows of fur. He didn't wag his tail as I stroked him. Suddenly, though, he embarrassed me by sniffing vigorously at my buttocks. Excre? tory odors are agents of memory in dogs, no doubt for Odysseus' Argus as well as my childhood companion, though it is a detail that Homer ignores. At the instant of recognition, Bruin?how it delighted me!?leaped at me to lick my face; unable to contain his happiness, he jumped on the coffee table, upsetting all the glass objects on it. He ran through the dining room and kitchen, circling back to leap at me again, and then up the stairs, where he jumped on or over the beds, tables, and chairs in every room. My aunt and I followed him upstairs as quickly as we could?to prevent further damage, I suppose, but also just to see the antic behavior. We laughed until we embraced each other, crying. Six months later, Bruin died. In his letter telling me of the death, my uncle said he had a worrisome feeling that a nutritional lack might have caused it; he and my aunt hadn't been able to afford more than a can of dog food each day, to supplement table scraps. I suppose he as well as I never really thought about the fact that Bruin would die: you come to expect immortality from a dog like that, and feel a personal responsibility when the animal proves as mortal as you. It was in keeping with the narcissism of my old love for him that I</page><page sequence="20">56 THE HUDSON REVIEW wondered if he had died because, having been so joyously reunited with me, he felt once again betrayed, this time by my return to college. But Bruin was eleven, my age when my father gave him to me; and at eleven a large dog has lived his normal span. In recent years, conscious of a diminution of my spiritual powers, I have remembered again and again a passage in an essay on old age by Francis Bacon: "A certain rabbin, upon the text, 'Your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams,' inferreth that young men are admitted nearer to God than old." At sixty-nine, I know that the soul is a name for our unobtainable desires, and that as a child I made of Bruin a repository of a vast wanting that included my absent father but went beyond that to reach the stars?a mighty wish to reach a spiritual truth beyond my limited self, one that could end my isolation by merging me with the natural world and the mysteries of the universe. Over the decades, I dispersed the qualities I associated with Bruin to every animal that came into my household until little was left to give away, other than the alert nobility of his black ears. To recall the strength of a childhood wanting makes me nostalgic for it, but its loss probably has made me gentler with my animals. VI. Wrath When Gandy entered our household, she immediately be? came friendly with another black animal, a female cat missing a front leg whose name, ironically enough, was Grabber. She had been given that name by Cris's goat dairy partner, who had gone to the S.P.C.A. shelter with Cris in search of a barn cat. The kitten had actually chosen them, by reaching through the bars of the cage to grab the partner's sleeve as she and Cris passed by. Following the collapse of the dairy enterprise, Grabber became a house cat that I fed. For three days, including one that was the coldest of the winter, she was absent from home. She came back at last, one of her front legs hurt so badly that it became gangrenous. The veterinarian who finally amputated it?for several days Cris massaged the leg in warm</page><page sequence="21">JAMES McCONKEY 57 water in a vain attempt to return the blood circulation?said the injury had been inflicted by an animal trap. Given Grabber's new vulnerability, her ready trust of a strange animal?so much larger than she, and a member of a frequently hostile species?surprised and gratified Jean and Cris and me. Gandy, though, is an unusually gentle creature, and at first probably felt an insecurity within an environment still alien to her, so perhaps from the beginning a mutual need led them to sleep together on the carpet of the downstairs bathroom. Waking at 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., Jean and I could see in the glow of the bathroom nightlight the cat curled up against the warm belly of the dog. Gandy didn't seem to sleep as soundly as Grabber; if we stirred in bed, she would thump her tail, without moving the rest of her body. It was as if she remained as alert as possible, in protection of her smaller, three-legged friend?though in thinking that I probably am giving the dog some feelings of my own. I have always detested the use of steel traps to capture animals, and it angered me not only that somebody had set one or more of them, without permission, somewhere on our farmlands, which extend a half mile in nearly every direction from our house, but would permit an animal caught in a trap to suffer there for as many days as our cat obviously had. In the days and weeks after the amputation, Cris and I searched fruitlessly for traps on the property. Just before dawn one spring morning, I stepped over the sleeping pair to get to the toilet. As I was returning to bed, I remembered a newspaper report that a comet would be visible before sunrise that day, and so I put on a bathrobe, got the binoculars from the bookcase beneath the window that faces the bird feeder, and went to the glassed-in porch to have a look. But instead of focussing on the tiny golden smudge in the eastern sky, I used the binoculars to magnify a rusty pickup truck parked a quarter mile down the road, near the hedgerow that marks a stream meandering through our fields, just as its owner emerged from the hedgerow, a limp muskrat in each hand. Without taking time to throw on any clothing under my bathrobe, I grabbed my car keys, ran to the car, and sent the gravel flying as I backed out of the driveway. The trapper, having figured out I was the owner of the property he was</page><page sequence="22">58 THE HUDSON REVIEW poaching upon, and maybe sensing from my speed a murder? ous intent, jumped into his pickup and took off. Ignoring the stop sign, he spun his truck left at the dangerous intersection with the state highway, and I did the same with my little Horizon. Apparently his instinct was to make it home, as if he would find safety there; he braked so suddenly for his driveway I almost crashed into his rear bumper. He was out of his truck and running for his door as I jumped from my car, shouting, "Stop! Stop right where you are!", a command that he instantly obeyed. Rage made me incoherent, and nearly blind. I told him he had caught God knows how many of my dogs in his vicious traps (an exaggerated and maybe wholly untrue indictment: two of our dogs in recent years had limped home with leg wounds less severe than Grabber's) and had caused my cat to lose her leg, and what ever had given him the cruelty to trespass on my land? Gradually, I saw him for what he was: a frail man considerably older than I who was trembling from palsy or fright, the owner of a truck missing a fender and with a hood held down by a rope; who lived in an unpainted house?that place of his refuge?so unprepossessing that I had never given it the slightest notice in passing by it nearly every day for many years. Head down, he begged my pardon. His wife was dead, his children gone. For most of his life, he had been self- employed, a handyman, and now his income came from muskrat furs and welfare checks. He always intended to inspect his traps every dawn, but these past months had frequently been bedridden, and hadn't he gotten up this morning to check them, feverish though he was? He didn't know anything about the dogs, but he was terribly sorry about the cat. I used to think now and again about the contrary aspects? the gentleness and the grimness?of the religion I had been born into but had rejected. It seemed to me that if a merciful and omnipotent God existed, Hell could not: for if God knew everything about causality?if He had the answer to every "Why?"?He surely would have to forgive even the most terrible of human crimes. In the present case, I was not God but an animal lover holding the flaps of a robe together. I said, "Get some Havahart traps?you know, the kind that</page><page sequence="23">JAMES McCONKEY 59 just cage the muskrats?and you can leave them anywhere you want on my land." He said he couldn't afford them. If that was the case, I said, he'd better not return with his traps to my property, for I would confiscate them; stern as I tried to sound, I felt sorrier for him than I did for the cat he had victimized, who at this moment probably was still sleeping against the belly of a friend. But relationships between animals, like those between peo? ple, can quickly sour. Grabber disappeared a few weeks later, never to return, two days after the night Gandy nearly killed her. Jean and I were awakened by a cry that reminded me of the rabbit's scream as the peasant in Italy drove the pointed stick through its eye to its brain. Grabber was doing the screaming, for she was dangling from Gandy's jaws. At my shout, the dog dropped the cat and assumed an abject posture while the cat scrambled on her three legs to the safety of the basement. "One or the other of them must have had a fright? ening dream that started the attack," Jean said; but my first thought was, We have but ourselves, and even I find a terrible pleasure in the chase: who or what can save us now? In hindsight, I suppose such a cryptic thought came to me because for a frightening instant I had lost those assumptions of personal integrity and conscience that had enabled me to accept the absence of God from our tangled human affairs. Such a loss can occur when we see ourselves merely as beasts, while denying any quality but brutishness to our fellow animals. VII. The Road to the Veterinary Hospital On a balmy night in late June last summer, I sat next to Gandy on the huge slab of slate that, with a thinner slab for a step, probably has served as a front door stoop since 1831, the year our house was built. Humans and some of the unregen- erate (or at least undomesticated) animals live at cross purposes, and generations of burrowing rodents?rats, mice, squirrels, chipmunks?have undermined some of the rocks that support that slab, causing it to break under its own weight. One of the sections had begun to tilt. From what distance had Thomas Kelsey, who built this house from the white pines cleared for his</page><page sequence="24">60 THE HUDSON REVIEW farmlands, carted this stone, and how had he managed to get it in place? And how could I bring the broken pieces (each of them probably weighed nearly as much as had Tammy, whose body had been so difficult to move from the stable) into alignment before winter ice caused Jean or me to fall? The latter concern is one that wouldn't have come into my mind when I was younger, and only did now because Jean had broken a knee in another kind of accident a few years earlier. Our house is at a country crossroads, and neither road?one dirt, one blacktop?carries much traffic at night. I listened to the frogs in our pond, diagonally across the intersection from the house but hidden by the highbush cranberries Jean and I had received as plantings from a state conservation agency as food for the birds?though to my knowledge no bird (and no person other than that renowned advocate of wild food, the late Euell Gibbons) ever relished the bitter fruit. Over the years, the pond?where we and our children used to swim?has silted up; maybe future owners of our property would reclaim it for their children. Why think about such problems on this pleasant and sweet- smelling night? I watched the random pattern of the fireflies, the headlights of a tractor in the field across the road (the neighboring farmer who rents much of our land was working late, baling and collecting hay before the promised rain ar? rived), and the regular sweep of the searchlight across the clouds, a beacon calling attention to the annual Enfield Fire? men's Fair in a field by a busier crossroads?Miller's Corners? three miles away. When our children were young, Jean and I used to take them to that fair, to ride the Ferris wheel and merry-go-round or to try their skill at a variety of games. Once Cris, watching people fruitlessly trying to win goldfish by throwing table tennis balls at the tiny bowls containing them, figured out how to gain so many fish that Jean and I had to buy him an aquarium, for even at ten he had a scientific bent of mind. Instead of throwing the balls, he tossed them, under? handed, high in the air, so that they plopped into the bowls instead of glancing off the rims; after he'd won a half dozen or so, the proprietor of the stand shooed him away and shut down his business long enough for those waiting in line who had</page><page sequence="25">JAMES McCONKEY 61 observed his technique to wander off to the shooting gallery or the pie raffle. Like those of many classical revival farmhouses in upstate New York, the woodshed of our house is actually built into one of the wings; it has a sliding barn-type exterior door, and another that opens into the kitchen. In the summers, our dogs have always slept in the woodshed with the exterior door open; their presence there keeps rabbits and raccoons out of the nearby vegetable garden. I was walking with Gandy toward the woodshed just as the farmer drove out of the field, his task completed. The tractor headlights lit the bare branches of the line of Russian olives I planted by the roadside a quarter century before to give privacy to the back yard with its picnic table. Those little trees with their shimmering leaves fortu? nately had never proved appetizing to the goats, and so had given seclusion to our summer suppers outdoors for maybe twenty years; but now most of them were dead. When they first showed signs of dying, I talked to an old acquaintance, a now-retired nurseryman in the nearby hamlet of Mecklenburg, thinking he might know of some antidote for the road salt that I believed was harming them; it shocked me to learn from him that Russian olives (unlike autumn olives, some of which we also had planted, or highbush cranberries) normally live less than twenty-five years. But those trees would at least provide us with some firewood, whenever I got around to cutting them up with a chain saw. It is always a help to think of a new use for something that has died or outlived its purpose: it pleased Jean and me to use the backstop of Jimmy's old baseball diamond as a support for our pole beans. The tractor puttered down the road, pulling two wagons loaded with the hay that had been ejected into them by the farmer's new hay baler. For years, he had been opposed to such a labor-saving device, simply because he liked the bales of hay to be placed neatly in the wagons, the way a farmer and his sturdy sons can stack them; his new baler piled them randomly, an affront to his sense of order. But his sons, like mine, were grown, his with farms of their own. As I left Gandy in the woodshed, lightning flared up in the northern sky, but thunder never followed, and the rains never came. The smallest details of that night remain in my mind, the</page><page sequence="26">62 THE HUDSON REVIEW events transferred from my short-term memory to the one that will last as long as I do; for in the early hours of the morning Gandy, like Grabber before her, lost a front leg?and part of the shoulder as well. She happened to be on the dirt road?was she in pursuit of a rabbit who had entered our garden??just as a car came down it, perhaps the only car on that road from midnight to dawn. Jean and I were awakened by a cry of dog-anguish; we ran to the front door just as Gandy reached it. She collapsed in the hallway. The motorist who had hit her stopped his car in front of the house long enough to see we had admitted the dog, and then drove off. The commotion woke Cris. While Jean and I tried to stem the flow of blood with towels, Cris dialed the emergency number of the Cornell small animal clinic, and explained the nature of the injury to one of the veterinary students on duty that morning. She said she would contact a surgeon, and instructed us to tie a rope around Gandy's muzzle: severely-injured dogs, however gentle they normally are, sometimes bite as they are being lifted. Cris made an emergency litter from a canvas cot. We put no rope on Gandy's muzzle. Gently we put her on that litter and carried her to the bed of Cris's pickup truck. Jean and I climbed into the bed with her; Jean wrapped blankets around Gandy's body, to prevent her from being chilled by the wind as we traveled. Gandy was making strange noises, and twisting her body on the litter; Jean kneeled on one side of her and I on the other, to keep her secure. I stroked her head, and the ears that were like Bruin's. And so we headed for Ithaca, and the veterinary hospital on the far side of town. We passed the hedgerow where I'd seen the trapper while looking for a comet. Cris turned left on the state highway as I had done in my pursuit of the poacher; half a mile down the highway, we passed the house where I had managed to catch him. Other people now lived in it: I supposed the trapper was dead. At Miller's Corners, I saw the dark tents of the Enfield Firemen's Fair beneath the dark and unmoving Ferris wheel. The state highway had just been widened and given a new coating of asphalt, the surface now so smooth that the truck seemed airborne, an illusion intensified as we rose and de? scended with the hills. The fragrance of newly-cut clover and</page><page sequence="27">JAMES McCONKEY 63 timothy, punctuated now and then with the different sweetness of freshly-mowed lawns, accompanied us as we glided along. We were on the road we habitually took, to get to our respective jobs, but everything was transformed by the hour (we had the road completely to ourselves, and every house was dark) and our mission. How strange it was, to be floating through the air like this in a pickup truck driven by a son, to be a white-haired professor kneeling next to an animal that might be dying, while one's wife for forty-five years knelt by the animal's other side, her hair blown back by the wind! As we neared Ithaca, we passed the house where the Colom? bian couple had established their goat dairy. They were parents of sixteen children; their offspring had become doctors, nurses, nuns, and business people, and had scattered about the world, some in Europe, some in the Middle East, others in Central and South America and Canada as well as in the United States, but every ten years the family came together for a reunion. Cris, Jean and I had been invited to the goat farm for one of these gatherings. A number of picnic tables had been placed under the limbs of a grand tree in their side yard?that rarity, a full-grown American chestnut that had withstood the blight? and the main dinner fare was a calf roasted on a spit. The couple's children were middle-aged, with children of their own, some of whom had babies. The three older generations sang Colombian songs, and songs of the various countries in which they lived, to the accompaniment of a Spanish guitar. But soon after that reunion, the goat barn caught fire from a malfunction of the heater used for pasteurization; all of the goats died in the blaze. The couple sold the house and left America to introduce the techniques of goat husbandry to the natives of an island kingdom in the Persian Gulf. How brave and undeterred that elderly couple had been! I heard that the husband, Ignazio, died in a car accident in Mexico City while on a visit to a relative there. The new owners of the property had cut off the vast lower branches of the chestnut. Had those branches decayed, or did the new owners simply want grass to grow beneath the tree which had sheltered the picnic tables? As we drove by that house, I was aware of a kind of abyss or dark cavity, maybe in my mind or in the actual landscape, which once</page><page sequence="28">64 THE HUDSON REVIEW had contained the goat barn and the marvel of the chestnut as it had been. Above us, through a gap in the clouds, I saw the Big Dipper, the end stars of the cup pointing toward the invisible North Star; indifferent as that glitter was to us and our journey, it shone down upon us as if we?Cris, the driver, and Jean and I, the silent kneelers?were figures in some allegory or mystery play that centered on a suffering Gandy but included every? thing that we journeyed by. In part, my response was an intensification of my feelings on the night that Cris and I, the newborn kid in a box on my lap, had made a similar journey, but now it was accompanied by something else. The night air was tender not only with the pervasive smell of the various cut grasses, but with the ephemeral nature of our lives and all that we make, on this tiny planet: this was the theme of our play or allegorical tableau. It was a truth I may have long known but never had experienced so absolutely, in body and mind, as I did from the bed of Cris's pickup truck, looking at the seemingly empty structures (the passing houses and barns) that we humans build to provide, in addition to their utility, a necessary illusion of permanence and security. And yet what extraordinary effort we put into these delicate construc? tions^?in creating them from our dreams, and after that in maintaining and prettifying them! These feelings came, I suppose, not only because of the dark cavity I saw or imagined but because I was conscious of Jean's age as well as my own and was remembering a huge but broken slab of stone at the entrance of our house and was stroking a black sail that belonged both to an idealized animal from my own mythology and one that might now be dying. However much we humans may believe that we share an understanding with them, animals have shorter lives and can't speak; and maybe these are reasons that our experiences over the years with our animals can serve as a metaphor for much that remains more implied than said in our relationships with other humans during the longer curve of our own brief lives. From the crest of the hill, I saw the streetlights of Ithaca, and lights of the roads surrounding another dark cavity, one that held the deep waters of Cayuga Lake. At the veterinary hospital, a light had been turned on for us</page><page sequence="29">JAMES McCONKEY 65 at the emergency entrance of the small animal clinic, and two white-coated young women were waiting at the door. They carried the litter?Gandy was now completely passive?into an examining room. Cris left, to put his pickup truck in the nearby parking lot. Jean and I stood in the hallway. Though the quarters in the small animal clinic are cramped, preventing it from seeming the cathedral nave the large animal clinic had been to me when Cris and I brought the kid, it still was a comforting sanctuary. I was glad to be a teacher at a university whose faculty includes surgeons and other competent veteri? nary specialists who don't mind being waked at midnight or 3:00 a.m. to care for a newborn kid or a middle-aged dog of mixed breed. In addition to gratitude, I was still feeling giddiness from the ride, and asked Jean if the trip had seemed strange to her. She said that she had never been so aware of the evanescence of life or the fragility of houses. We are separate people, Jean and I, and our personalities differ; but we have been married a long time, and sometimes our emotions coalesce like that. Because we are separate, I can't say what the road from our house to the veterinary hospital signified to her that night, but to me it was (and remains) the present section of a road I've been traveling a long time. VIII. The Pond House It is now mid-August of the following year. I have found no remedy?other than rock salt mixed with kitty litter in icy weather?for the broken slab at the front door. Jean and I, though, have done something about the pond. We've had it dredged, deepened, and doubled in area; we have put in a sand beach and built a dock for diving. Presently we are finishing the construction of a little pond house, to be used as a cabana and as a Scandinavian-like summer house in which one can be lulled to slumber on sultry nights by the sound of frogs, waking to watch the great blue heron that visits the pond while the morning mists are rising from it, and that returns each evening. The house will serve other good purposes, too: since it will have a wood stove, we can use it as a warming room for ice-skating</page><page sequence="30">66 THE HUDSON REVIEW parties, and as a complement to the sauna that Cris plans to purchase. Jim, our youngest son, has done much of the heavy work during visits between his film jobs in New York and elsewhere; he cleared the space of underbrush, dug the post holes, decided to add a deck in front of the pair of sliding glass doors that face the pond, and helped install the roof and siding. To my mind, it's far more impressive than that quaint and precariously-built summer house used as a major setting in the film My Life as a Dog. We are building it as carefully as we can, to outlast us all. On weekends, Jean, Cris, and I have been working toward its completion; on weekday afternoons, Gandy accompanies me (I now teach only in the spring terms) for the several hours I usually spend on the structure, working on tasks I can handle by myself while others earn their salaries. Sometimes Gandy watches me, muzzle on her single front paw; sometimes she plays with two neighboring dogs, Butterscotch and Derby. Though Gandy hops like the rabbit she might have been chasing the night of her injury, she can run for short distances as fast on three legs as Butterscotch and Derby can on four. On weekends, when I and the other members of my family get overly hot from our labors, we go swimming; Gandy, half Laborador that she is, loves the water, and swims along with us. (I was alarmed when she first jumped in the pond, for I was afraid that the loss of a front leg might cause her to drown.) Like the rest of us, Gandy is as happy as she knows how to be.</page></plain_text>
