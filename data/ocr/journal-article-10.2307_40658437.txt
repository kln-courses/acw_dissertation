Something lurks in his mind, however; something is not quite right. Yet the comfortable categorizations of fairy or witch do not apply; he is dealing with, in all appearances, a regular woman. At certain transitional points women are in an in-between stage in reference to patriarchal female norms - when they are maidens, they are not quite wives, when they are pregnant, they are not quite mothers, and when they are old crones, men cannot be sure what they are because they are no longer beautifully bewitching or reproductively useful. Women at these three key phases seem to embody a power greater than themselves; they seem to have knowledge that escapes the rational framework of males and that connects with the natural world in an almost uncanny way. The witch trials of the early modern period are one manifestation of "a crisis of order, focusing on gender relations, that began around 1550, peaked in 1650, and passed by 1700"; however, representa- tions of women in early modern plays dramatize this crisis with female characters that exude threatening magical power without the label of witch or she-devil cast explicitly upon them.1 These types of characters show, in a sense, the roots and psychology behind superstitious beliefs of the time. Early modern women are Diane Purkiss's fairies as they embody "the dual promise of bliss and terror" by manifesting their power at key life stages and mystifying the rigid patriarchal definitions of women.2 Virgins and pregnant wives appear in various incarnations throughout early modern drama. Maidens such as Margret in Monika Karpinska completed her M.A. at McMaster University. This es- say is based on research examining representations of female power in early modern drama.</page><page sequence="2">428 Virgins and Pregnant Women Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay, Perdita in The Winter's Tale, the two sisters in John a Kent and John a Cumber, and the sisters in The Birth of Merlin encompass not only a natural virginal beauty but also an agency that can keep these women perpetually out of the domestic space relegated to them by men (as some maidens demonstrate by choosing the convent over the kitchen).3 Once in that domestic space, however, we find pregnant wives - perhaps best illustrated by Hermione in The Winter's Tale and Joan Go- to-'t in The Birth of Merlin - who respectively demonstrate female power allied and unallied with nature. The figure of the virgin and the pregnant wife are particularly worth examining as they present different-yet-connected configurations between women and the natural world - a certain kind of magic - and the attempts to contain, control, and perhaps understand that magic by the patriarchs at large. In the early modern period, as Walter Stephens argues, the belief in witchcraft was necessary for religion and, more specifi- cally, for the Christian sacraments to retain their power.4 If God is to have agency on this earth, then so must the devil. This neces- sary biblical condition is also the source of why, more often than not, women are the temples that evil possesses. In the Western tradition, the view of female weakness and women's subjugation as men's property is perhaps best traced back to the Bible. Just as the natural world is given to Adam by God for his use, so in the second creation tale is Eve: "and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."5 Later, once the temptation is complete and God doles out punishment to each being involved, he curses Eve with pain in childbirth and states that "thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee."6 And so Adam, just as he named all the fish and beasts, now names the woman Eve, "the mother of all living."7 Adam's punishment is the pain involved in laboring the earth for his subsistence; Eve's punishment is the shared subjugation, along with all the other living things, to Adam. Inherent distrust, and an inherent linking of Eve's betrayal to the ultimate lost property - the Garden of Eden - as well as the equalization of Eve with the natural world are the salient points of this creation myth from the point of view of Adam. In this widely believed story, woman is seen as a relatively easy target for demonic temptation as well as the ultimate temptress and the agent of loss and disorder in the male world.8 Adam's loss of property is tempered as he gains property</page><page sequence="3">Monika Karpinska 429 in the form of the female body - his to harvest and control. The expression of this type of attitude (reflected in representations of women) continues in early modern drama and is reinforced by the fact that both "Medieval and Renaissance society preferred the former [Old Testament] tale, which reinforced the belief that women's inferiority was justified."9 Julia Nurse examines Northern European Renaissance prints with sexualized portrayals of Eve, alongside other biblical women who step beyond their patriar- chally defined roles; these prints reinforce the idea that "beneath [their] 'womanliness' lies a sense of threat."10 These same themes occur in the English drama of this period: Eve represents the virgin temptress and at the same time, the cursed mother. In this sense, however, she is a recreation of a much older tale of female power dating back to the earliest forms of goddess worship circa 25,000 BC.11 The same duality represented in Eve can be seen in ancient fertility rituals worshipping a female deity as an anthropomorphic representative of the earth as a source of life: "she [Earth Mother] simultaneously incorporated both life and death, creation and destruction, growth and decay, the upper world and the under- world. She was the loving and simultaneously terrible (or devour- ing) mother."12 Women naturally became walking representatives of this "Earth Mother" because they were the "bearers of life . . . and shared her cyclical rhythms."13 The later Greek and Roman configurations of the Earth Mother are represented in the Triple Hecate - a female tri-form that embodies this duality and the cyclical nature of menstruation and regeneration that joins the two. Though the Roman triad of Diana, Luna, and Hecate is more threatening than the Persephone, Demeter, and Hecate configura- tion, the primary sense they convey of the female as both defying and encapsulating binary representations of the world is manifest much earlier in ancient earth-as-goddess worship (and later recast in the Eve story).14 By the time the authors of the Old Testament came to be, ancient peoples' view of the earth had changed from a symbiotic relationship of respect to one of dominance and sub- mission reflected in the beginnings of ownership and property rights as agriculture became the primary form of subsistence. In the Genesis myth this is manifest in the loss of the Garden of Eden and in the configuration of the female, still the representa- tive mother, as something to be named, owned, and used with the same patriarchal dominance that is exerted over land. Early modern representations of women in their natural vir- ginal state hearken back to these ancient connections that link</page><page sequence="4">430 Virgins and Pregnant Women women explicitly with the natural; in textual descriptions this is most often relayed with goddess imagery of the Roman or Greek period. In the same way, representations of pregnant women are those of a mythical earth mother or goddess at the height of her power. Yet in both states, the female is perceived as a threat to male order - reflective of the way witchcraft functioned during this period. Perhaps the threat is best explained as the inability of men to grasp the nature of female power, best represented by the earth-as-goddess - a merger of rational and nonrational, a queen of the in-between. "THE SECRET BEWTIES OF THE MAID" (FBFB, LINE 74) The seductive power of virgins in early modern drama is the natural result of their chaste state; yet the temptation that the beautiful virgin represents also yields a certain threat of instability prior to her absorption into the patriarchal marriage system. Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay has at its center a virgin whose charms seduce nearly all the male characters; by the end of the play the king himself acknowledges, "her fame flies through the English coast" (FBFB, line 1754). The prince, Edward, is the first to fall for Margret's "secret bewties." Upon nearly wedding her to Lacie, Bungay comments: "Hath not ech eye that viewd thy pleasing face, / Surnamed thee faire maid of Fresingfield," and indeed, Edward suspects that Bungay "courts the bonny wench" (FBFB, lines 672-3, 678). Later Lambert and Serlbie, two "neighbouring squires," come to proclaim their love for Margret as well; Lambert declares that she "ouer -shines our damsels as the moone" (FBFB, lines 1436, 1394). Evidently, Margret's natural charms have no sense of social hierarchy; she has attracted a prince, an earl, a friar, and two squires - a representative of each social class. There is a sense of the threat that this kind of beauty poses as the prince disregards his proper bride, Ellinour, while he is under Margret's spell and spends his time "malecontent" as he plots how to make her his own (even though it is clear to everyone involved that she will simply be his whore) (FBFB, line 27). In marrying Lacie, Margret climbs up the class system by sheer virtue of her beauty. She causes the death of four men by the upsetting of social norms that would normally have her choose one of the country squires for her husband and settle their initially good-natured squabble over who offers more economic security as a means of winning her maidenhead.</page><page sequence="5">Monika Karpinska 431 Edward's initial descriptions of Margret figure her as a natural goddess: "Her bashfull white mixt with the mornings red, / Luna doth boast vpon her louely cheekes" (FBFB, lines 59-60). Margret's beauty not only is magical by virtue of its mythical grandeur but also is allied closely with nature, as Margret herself reveals when she explains the characteristics of love to Lacie: for to garden well, Seeds must haue time to sprout before they spring, Loue ought to creepe as doth the dials shade, For timely ripe is rotten too too soone. (FBFB, lines 718-21) This virginal landscape, ready to be sown, is configured a differ- ent way in Edward's increasingly sexualized depictions of Margret fulfilling her "huswiferie," likening her to Venus, Pallas Athene, and finally to Lucrèce, the raped martyr of marital virtue (har- kening to later events in the play when Edward appears as the Tarquin figure and Margret swears to kill herself if she cannot be with Lacie properly) (FBFB, line 8 1).15 The purity of Margret is the purity of the earth before man has plowed, harvested, or reaped from it - Margret imagines a fruitful garden while Edward imagines a rape of virgin soil. Edward's inflamed depictions of how Margret will be treated as his concubine again combine the mythical with the natural: "Like Thetis shalt thou wanton on the waues / And draw the Dol- phins to thy louely eyes" {FBFB, lines 1003-4). Likewise, Lacie's descriptions of Margret upon their almost-wedding-day compare her once more with goddess figures - as Daphne who locked Phoebus Apollo "in the brightnesse of her lookes" (FBFB, line 686). Both Lacie and Edward want power over Margret but in two radically different ways - Edward wants to destroy, to nullify her power over him while Lacie, on the other hand, wants to preserve her beauty but make it his own by the tangible social contract of marriage: "fitter to be Lacies wedded wife, / Than concubine vnto the prince of Wales" {FBFB, lines 968-9). Yet when Lacie's dis- guise is revealed and the marriage vows-to-be take on the taint of class distinctions, confinement enters the language of the lovers. Margret offers Lacie, "He be your gailor once," and he responds, "Then am I double prisoner to thy seife" [FBFB, lines 742, 745). Lacie is prisoner to Margret's love as his disguised self, and now that he is revealed, he proves that his identity as earl is just as earnestly imprisoned. Thus the "double prisoner" is Lacie's refer-</page><page sequence="6">432 Virgins and Pregnant Women ence to himself both in and out of disguise (FBFB, line 745). On another level, Lacie is trapped both by his love for Margret and by his allegiance to Edward. Again, Margret's tempting beauties have posed a threat to the social order. In the final confrontation of this love triangle an argument ensues over who is to die to sate Edward's jealous rage; his mind is finally changed after Margret pleads that he kill both her and Lacie: "in one toombe knit both our carkases, / Whose hearts were linked in one perfect loue" (FBFB, lines 1056-7). This double death seems to give Edward pause (as the double imprisonment did for Lacie), and he decides instead to "conquer [himself]" for the richest spoils (FBFB, line 1067). Self-containment rules here, rather than containment of another through death or rape. The sexual self-control the prince embodies in this scene contrasts with notions of female sexual insatiability prevalent in the early modern period. The prince not only has overcome Margret's be- witchment but also has proven himself an even greater man by allying himself with the virtues of bodily self-constraint. Margret is later faced with the similar dilemma of self-con- tainment as she believes herself to be abandoned by Lacie and readies herself for convent life. Even though she had just been offered two equally good choices of husbands (in the form of the country squires), the world's riches do not suffice, and she would rather sequester herself than not be with the man she loves: The worlde shalbe to her as vanitie, Wealth trash, loue hate, pleasure dispaire, For I will straight to stately Fremingham, And in the abby there be shorne a Nun And y eld my loues and libertie to God. (FBFB, lines 1549-53) In comparison to other dramatic representations of virgins who choose convent life, Margret's choice is not philosophically based in the same way as Modestia's in The Birth of Merlin but is grounded in sheer despair over Lacie's betrayal: The vaine Illusions of this flattering world, Seemes odious to the thoughts of Margret I loued once, lord Lacie was my loue, And now I hate my selfe for that I lovd, And doated more on him than on my God. (FBFB, lines 1906-10)</page><page sequence="7">Monika Karpinska 433 Modéstia, on the other hand, states "These best of creatures ... weak man and woman, should have their souls, their making, life and being, to some more excellent use ... I'll pay to him [God], not man, the love I owe" (BoM, I.ii). Margret leaves the base world because it is the "engine of all [her] woe" - she has been disap- pointed in arguably the best thing the corporeal world has to of- fer, true love (FBFB, line 1924). Modestia's rejection, however, is not based on the rejection of any one man but on her rejection of the entire social framework that would confine her to the devo- tion of an earthly man; she expresses and acts upon an inherent distrust of the ultimate aims of existence available to her in the role of bride and mother. The limited agency of Margret - revolving around the selection of and devotion to one true love - parallels that of other represen- tations of virgins during this time. It seems to be the proper state of things that a virgin should be wed to the man of her dreams. Though Marian and Sidanen, the two brides-to-be in John a Kent and John a Camber, are largely passive figures in the bulk of the play - moved from side to side as magicians and noblemen duel - they express significant concern over their fates early on. If John a Kent and their true loves do not intervene, they plan for a double suicide rather than a double wedding: "A strong confection bothe we haue preparde, / of deadly Aconite wth them to drinke" (JKJC, lines 459-60). The sisters demonstrate striking devotion to the cause of true love. When faced with the threat of forced marriage to the wrong man, they choose to die "despairingly" and take the imposter grooms with them "reuendgefully" (JKJC, lines 463, 462). The devotion to love is commendable and parallels Margret's deadly proposition to Edward - she too is willing to die rather than give over her powers to the wrong lusty suitor. In fact, the power of this kind of love seems to be so strong that Margret rather quickly retracts her convent vow; the "inchant- ing face" of Lacie is enough to make her forego "heauens joy" for "earths fading blisse" {FBFB, lines 1984, 1972). Margret's story ends as she is firmly entrenched in the male-dominated realm and bound now not only to Lacie in "obedience, and such humble loue" but also to the "mightie men" of the Court and to Ellinour on whom she attends (FBFB, lines 2102, 2103). Margret's beauty and natural virginal power are absorbed into the courtly realm. The amount of power she has as a virgin in the first part of the play is altered, rejected, decreased, and finally absorbed as the play progresses to its socially stable conclusion. Also raised as a country maid, Perdita, the abandoned royal daughter in The Winter's Tale, yields an effect on the men around</page><page sequence="8">434 Virgins and Pregnant Women her similar to Margret's. The array of natural imagery and god- dess comparisons surrounding Perdita surpasses even that of Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay's virgin. Perdita's natural powers harness a love that Florizel declares eclipses all the knowledge the natural world has to offer: for all the sun sees, or The close earth wombs, or the profound sea hides In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath To this my fair belov'd. (WT, WAv. 490-3) Just as the king has knowledge of Margret's infamous beauty in Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay, so Camillo reports Perdita as "a daughter of most rare note" to Polixenes (WT, IV.ii.43). At the sheep-shearing festival, Polixenes himself is wooed by Perdita's beauty and charms: This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever Ran on the green sward: nothing she does or seems But smacks of something greater than herself, Too noble for this place. (WT, WAv. 156-9) Yet when the threat of Florizel's love for Perdita becomes some- thing more than a springtime fling, Polixenes' words quickly change their tone. When Florizel's oaths are regarded as bind- ing and he rejects his father in favor of this bride, the situation becomes menacingly serious. As soon as a threat to social order and a sundering of male allegiance (here between father and son) is present, Perdita is no longer the innocent pretty lass. She is instantly transformed into a "fresh piece / Of excellent witchcraft," "enchantment," and "[u]nworthy" of Florizel (WT, IV.iv.423-4, 435, 438). How quickly Eve becomes eve-il! Polixenes even goes so far as to threaten Perdita lest she attempt to "hoop [Florizel's] body more" with her embraces (WT, IV.iv.440). Perdita's own adopted father calls her a "cursed wretch" for knowingly charming the prince (WT, IV.iv.459). Without a word from her, the perception of Perdita in the eyes of the men around her changes from one of "bliss" to "terror."16 Luckily, however, the theory still applies: naturally protected virgins are destined to be with their true loves. Florizel remains faithful and true, and, luckily for him,</page><page sequence="9">Monika Karpinska 435 his marriage to Perdita reinforces social hierarchies rather than splitting them apart. Perdita's power eventually is legitimized and contained by her oath to Florizel. The danger of Margret' s power, had it not been contained, is reflected in Friar Bacon's character and the magic he wields. The power of Bacon as a sorcerer is contrasted to the natural power of Margret as a virginal country maid. Margret's power is allied closely with the natural world and she wields it without con- scious manipulation. As her power is based in her physicality, it is largely irrational, both potentially nurturing and threatening. Bacon's power, on the other hand, revolves around the applica- tion of rationality to control the natural world - seen most clearly by his attempts at the creation of the ultimate artificial power in the form of the brazen head. His power is destructive rather than life-giving, primarily mental rather than physical. As foils, Bacon and Margret are illustrative of the traditional division between man and woman - between rational and irrational - yet the fate of each is nearly the same. Bacon destroys his magic glass after witnessing the two sons of Margret's country- squire suitors kill each other avenging their fathers' deaths; using Bacon's magic glass, the two sons had just finished watching their fathers duel to the death over Margret. Bacon destroys the glass stating that his "magicke doth effect this massacre"; it is clear, however, that Margret's virginal magic helped effect this massacre as well [FBFB, line 1860). Though Margret is not destroyed in the same way as the glass is, by the end of the play her powers have indeed been contained. Just as the glass loses its magic, so does Margret upon official entry into the marital patriarchy. Her power, however, is not unnatural, like Bacon's, and thus she is not responsible for the effect of her charms. The parallel between the two is made clear on stage when Bacon vows to spend the rest of his life in devotion to God just before Margret enters the scene in nun's apparel on her way to the convent. Bacon's attempts at creation, an attempt to give birth to an independent intelligent entity, are unnatural and fail; he evokes their disjointed nature himself as he describes the natural world's revolt at his doings: "three-formd Luna hid her silver looks" as he tried to undermine female power by "Poring upon darke Hecats principles" [FBFB, lines 1575, 1579). Bacon repents for his unnatural meddling and wishes to be reborn "as a new borne babe from sinne," relegating himself to the domain of nature and women who hold the power of regeneration and its counterpart, death (FBFB, line 1891).</page><page sequence="10">436 Virgins and Pregnant Women The menace that Friar Bacon poses to the natural order of the world through his unnatural pursuit of knowledge is parallel with the unknowing menace Margret poses through her natural and unconscious knowledge - knowledge she has by virtue of her sex. Though Margret is an innocent seductress - naive, simple, and easily fooled - other virgins seem to be more aware of the power they hold. Through the symbol of Eve, virgins and temptresses are closely allied in the threat their charms pose to the patriar- chal order. This threat is reflected in the art of the period as Julia Nurse demonstrates in her examination of Renaissance prints.17 Beautiful women make fools of men in a variety of scenes: money is stolen while old men grope, philosophers are ridden like horses, and gods sweep the floor of the domestic space. The only difference between an innocently beautiful virgin like Margret and the more dangerous temptress is an awareness and conscious manipulation of this natural bodily power. Just as Margret's beauties threaten the allegiance between Lacie and Edward, so Artesia, the evil temptress in The Birth of Merlin, cleaves the bond between two royal brothers and successfully splits a kingdom by sheer force of her natural charms. As quickly as Edward falls for Margret, so Aurelius, the king, falls for his enemy's sister: "her beauty mazes me; I cannot speak if I but look on her" (BoM, I.ii). Acting at a more local level, the virginal bride in Thomas Middleton's The Witch possesses the power to convert a poten- tial rape by her true love into reciprocal love.18 Like the virgins discussed previously, Isabella too is fated to be physical solely with her true love. By rendering Isabella's imposter -husband impotent, Sebastian manages to preserve her maidenhead for himself - though he is not the agent by which Isabella ends up his wife, he is actively involved in recruiting the witch's help in maintaining her virginity for his own consumption, thus reinforc- ing both the temptation and the social importance of the unsullied bridal state. Isabella occupies an unnatural in-between space as a married maiden - comically reflected in her sexual frustration after her wedding night when she observes that "[I slept] more than I thought I should" and later in the play when Sebastian comments, "I know what makes you waspish" (TW, II.i.65; III. ii.48). Francisca, sister-in-law to Isabella, occupies a similarly odd space as a pregnant maiden. In her protracted efforts to keep up appearances of chastity, Francisca not only gives birth in secret but also attempts to sully Isabella's reputation in the eyes of her husband, Antonio. Francisca's betrayal of her own body, and of the body of women that should help each other within the patriarchal</page><page sequence="11">Monika Karpinska 437 space (reflected in Isabella's promise to Francisca), illustrates the hymen mania ruling the early modern period and the cleaving of female allegiances that it affords. The focus in this play is not on the spellbinding beauty of the maidens in question but on the sheer idea of them as maidens. The divorce of these women from any kind of individuality - there are no goddess comparisons or supplications to their beauties here - renders them as superficial agents of symbolic virtue. Their agency in the play revolves solely around complex machinations necessary to secure relatively safe positions for themselves in the patriarchal domain. The Isabella and Francisca relationship in The Witch parallels the relationship between Modéstia and Constantia in The Birth of Merlin. Just as Modéstia converts Constantia to convent life on her wedding day, Isabella tries to persuade Francisca into the married life in the second act, citing the "comforts" of bearing children amongst other benefits: "If you'd a husband, you might exercise / To th' good o'th' commonwealth, and do much profit" (TW, II. i. 89-90). Just as Francisca's pregnancy is unnatural to her supposedly virginal condition, so Isabella's enforced chastity is not natural to her newly married condition. The consequences for Francisca, who is simultaneously an anti-maid and an anti- mother, are meted out to her in accusations from both sexes - Isabella declaims her "base lust," and Antonio addresses her, rather hypocritically, as "thou fruitful wickedness, thou seed / Of shame and murder!" (TW, III.ii.51; V.i.29-30). These unnatural in-between states are soon remedied by forced marriage in Fran- cisca's case and, after a convoluted series of sexual accusations and disclosures, by the death of the imposter Antonio and the marriage with Sebastian in Isabella's case. Amoretta, the honest maiden in The Witch, declares herself "a maid, a perfect one" and functions only to "preserve a competant honesty" in regards to her chaste state (TW, II.ii.74, 115). The quick succession of her gain and loss of the enchanted ribbon from Almachildes has its comic effects as Amoretta's behavior, to the unknowing observer, demonstrates the changeability and fickleness commonly ascribed to women. Her only other action in the drama is to protect the virtue of the duchess whom she serves. Like the other virgins in The Witch, Amoretta serves to emblematize the chastity so tempting to ravishers such as Al- machildes. She is conscious of the importance of appearances and, in her speech to Almachildes, acknowledges that "we are all flesh and blood man" but that it is necessary to "play the game out modestly" (TW, II. ii. 127, 128). Middleton's virgins are unlike</page><page sequence="12">438 Virgins and Pregnant Women those of Robert Greene and William Rowley; rather than natural goddesslike beauties that pose a sweet threat to the very hier- archy of patriarchal order, they are walking shells of symbolic chastity already firmly entrenched in the artificial social system of appearances and imaginary hymens. Class differences enter the play here as there appears to be a correlation between a woman's social standing and her intelligence regarding her feminine powers. Since Margret is a country girl, her decisions are simple, based on emotions, while Modéstia and Constantia, on the other hand, are of the courtly realm, daughters of a nobleman, and show a level of philosophical sophistication in their bodily choices. Isabella and Francisca, also of noble de- scent, secure their positions by premeditated manipulations of their own, and Artesia, the evil temptress and sister of a king, consciously uses her body to effect even greater change - on a political level within the social sphere. Whether conscious of their powers or not, virgins in early modern drama illustrate the "dual promise of bliss and terror" by their bewitching beauty that promises men sexual satisfaction but simultaneously threatens to dismantle the patriarchal structures of class and allegiance by its powerful temptation.19 Allied with nature in the eyes of men, virgin representations hearken back to Eve - the first virgin and the first temptress to rift man apart from his "father" and his lawful property rights. "MEN MUST HAVE WIVES AND WOMEN WILL BE WED" (FBFB, LINE 1716) Through the institution of marriage, the natural virginal power of maidens is seemingly captured and contained: a woman is defined and positioned relative to her husband. Outside of this relationship, men perceive women as dangerous - either magically virginal or creepily witchlike in the form of a crone. Yet even within this domestic sphere the female body confounds its prison by the birthing process: the woman herself is no longer contained; she has created something within herself that is outside of the control, and perhaps understanding, of men. Walter Stephens explains the importance of the marriage act in the seventeenth century as seen through the eyes of Catholic theorists who through literal interpretation of the Bible saw marriage as "a kind of eternal sex act that literally conjoins husband and wife, making them 'two in one flesh.'"20 The "two become one" of marriage is reversed within the female body where "one becomes two." As a result, repre-</page><page sequence="13">Monika Karpinska 439 sentations of pregnant women endow them with nearly magical properties that, once again, make the connection between women and the natural world explicit. Distrust of the wife, manifested most commonly by a fear of cuckoldry, has its roots in the inherent distrust and imagined betrayal of the body itself. This, combined with the legendary "uncontrollable sexual appetite of women," reduces the seemingly safe status of the wife within the marriage to a tricky process of negotiation in which she has to carefully word and walk her way through the gender stereotypes of female weakness.21 Accusations of cuckoldry have to be carefully handled if a wife is to retain her respect in the public sphere without publicly shaming her hus- band. In Saint Paul's configuration of marriage, "man the head and woman the body of one flesh," the heritage of distrust and female betrayal becomes clear once more.22 This physical image of the divide between man and woman reinforces the "deep distrust of all things nonrational - the natural, the physical, the ecstatic, the intuitive, the emotional - all of which are equated with the feminine" and that are central to representations of the power of pregnant wives.23 Just as the senses can be deceiving, and the body often clouds the perceived rational faculties, so woman-as- body has the potential to deceive her husband. The workings of the body itself are an element of mystery in early modern society, and so women too fall into this hazy realm of the unknown, the untrustworthy, and ultimately the frightening.24 Pregnancy appears to be closely tied with this fear because heirs, birthright, and property entitlement are all dependent upon its issue. The husband has no guaranteed method of knowing the legitimacy of the children born into the marriage - the swell- ing of the female body seems to occur separately from immediate sexual contact with him, and once the child is born, the status of the wife has been reconfigured within the domestic sphere. By giving birth to a child, the woman undermines the superiority of the husband within the marriage contract because she is now in a dominant position, at least in reference to her children: "an individual woman is duplicated, or split, among her different roles and position."25 This duality is reflected in perceptions of the physical body as well, as Naomi J. Miller observes: "Beyond the purview of masculine control or regulation, the female repro- ductive organs could serve simultaneously to validate women's caregiving roles and to undermine male social authority."26 The "dual promise of bliss and terror" is reflected here on a bodily level: in the marriage state the female's physicality is reconfigured</page><page sequence="14">440 Virgins and Pregnant Women in its role (from temptress to caregiver) but retains an element of danger to the patriarchal order.27 Leontes' fear of cuckoldiy in The Winter's Tale begins after a conversation between Hermione and Polixenes that harkens back to biblical representations of the evil power of women. Polixenes' pastoral recollections of Leontes and himself in their youth are reminiscent of Adam's imagined innocence before temptation (via Eve) brought about his state of sin. Hermione seizes upon the implication and proclaims that Polixenes should not continue: "lest you say / Your queen and I are devils" and immediately hints at man's own folly, implying that the accusation would have more weight had it not been true that Polixenes and Leontes had "slipp'd not / With any but with us" (WT, I.ii.81-2, 85-6). Hermi- one's astute repartee paints the background on which Leontes orchestrates and executes his own fall. As the roles reverse, Leon- tes manifests a near -hysterical condition normally ascribed to a "wandering womb" phenomenon in women: "an animal within an animal, with its own consciousness."28 Leontes' sudden onslaught of suspicion and jealousy serves to desex him in his position of patriarchal authority. As Helen Ostovich observes, both the lords and ladies of the Court recognize his emotional irrationality but are hesitant to point it out. In his self-induced madness, Leontes decides that both he and his kingdom have become subject to all possible threats of disorder - traitors, bastard children, cuck- oldiy, and adultery.29 This role reversal can be extended to later scenes as Leontes indirectly kills Mamillius and orchestrates the abandonment of Perdita - acting the role of the quintessential anti- mother. Though Leontes does indeed act "like an unruly woman," he lacks the power of regeneration (given to him by Paulina later), and so he metes out the only power he can wield - that of death.30 Leontes is the author of the kind of inversion normally ascribed to witchcraft. The conclusion of the play, however, does not quite form a perfect "validation of a rigidly patriarchal society" as we get the sense that the reborn Leontes operates still under the watchful eye of Paulina and his restored wife.31 Leontes' fears of the power of female regeneration and birth are checked when Hermione is reborn by the magic of Paulina. His admiration of magic in this final scene may be indicative of his acceptance, or at least better understanding, of the unknown realm of female power. As Paulina leads the king and the royal entourage off the stage in the final scene of the play, the audience is left with a reconfigured image of power structures and the gender roles they reflect. The sense of power emanating from the pregnant Hermione is evident in the scenes immediately prior to her imprisonment and</page><page sequence="15">Monika Karpinska 441 during her absence in the form of Paulina who, Ostovich points out, acts as her agent.32 The authority Hermione takes during the imprisonment scene finds its counterpart in her skillful negotiation in speech between her private and public defenses against Leontes' accusations. Once she is confined, however, Hermione's power is manifest not only in Paulina but also in the natural forces linked to her recently transformed (i.e., pregnant) state. The anger that Paulina expresses toward Leontes is the anger Hermione cannot express through speech; similarly, the natural world lashes out with the anger that Hermione cannot express through action. The Clown's description of the destruction of the ship calls upon lunar imagery as he sees "the ship boring the moon with her mainmast" as it is heaved up and down on the stormy waves (WT, III.iii.91). Not only is the image one of repeated penetration, but also the ship's ultimate destruction takes place under the watchful eye of Luna, protectress of the virgin child Perdita. As Shakespeare reconfigured his source material to make Hermione, rather than Polixenes' wife, the daughter of the Emperor of Russia, the bear (not usually a Mediterranean creature) that kills Antigonus could be figured as Hermione's familiar, acting on her behalf in the kind of "subject-extension" that Frances Dolan argues wives and mothers often take up when their power is otherwise limited.33 The balance between life and death that these natural "disasters" have secured is summed up by the Shepherd: "thou met'st with things dying, I with things new-born" (WT, Ill.iii. 1 12). In Paulina and Hermione's actions we find "the presence of female subversion beneath an apparent conformity to social and moral standards," which Alison Findlay attributes to the Lancashire witches - seen here in seemingly regular women.34 In contrast to Hermione's power and pervasive ability to right the wrongs done against her, Joan Go-to-'t in The Birth of Merlin is another pregnant mother, but not one that is allied with na- ture. In her pregnant state, she wields little power and is largely an object of pity or derision. Though the scenes with her brother the Clown and the search for a father are largely comical, Joan suffers a beating from Prince Uter, followed by a variety of rejec- tions from various men: Oswald is compassionate, while Toclio invests Joan with false hope until she swoons with joy and then recovers to find him gone. At Court, Edwin labels Joan a whore, and Sir Nichodemus swindles Joan and her brother out of money. Though her unwed state is initially of great concern to her as she desperately searches for a father, after the birth of Merlin Joan is content to tie herself to him and repent her earlier "sin and shame" (BoM, IV. i).</page><page sequence="16">442 Virgins and Pregnant Women Joan's initial rejection of nature bodes ill for her when the natural world betrays her, in a sense, by permitting the Devil to tempt her within its sphere. In her repentance speech Joan reflects upon her youthful vanity: "Oft have I chid the winds for breath- ing on me, and curs'd the sun, fearing to blast my beauty" (BoM, IV. i). By taking for granted her natural endowments as something superior to the natural world, Joan as good as calls the Devil to her: "I supposed no mortal creature worthy to enjoy me" (BoM, IV. i). Joan is left for the rest of play dependent on various men to secure her position. When the Devil appears for the second time, there is no storm or pit in the ground to swallow him up, and it seems that Joan's pleas and newly repentant state are insufficient to save her; she is still a slave to her "wanton flesh" (BoM, V.i). Yet Joan now has natural protection of a slightly different kind: her offspring. Merlin's short-lived battle with the Devil defends his mother's newly found chastity. Joan's repentance, however, is to be lifelong as her powerful son constructs a prestigious convent- for-one in which she will "weep away this flesh [she has] offended" (BoM, V.i). Without any female allies of the kind Hermione has in Paulina, and without the natural world on her side, Joan is relegated to the sphere of men where she is defined as each sees fit: to the Devil she is a whore; to her son she is a Madonna. When women give full meaning to the name ascribed to them by Adam, Eve or "mother of all living things," they recall the earlier name of a pagan earth goddess: "She of a Thousand Names."35 Virgins and pregnant women exist at two transformative stages that call to mind this power. The superstitious beliefs that link fairies and magic to these types of transitional phases point to the knowledge that women possess, which simultaneously defies and encompasses the binaries so favored in the Western tradition. Though the early modern women examined here are not witches or fairies, they still embody the "dual promise of bliss and terror" as females; the power of the woman is closely tied with the power of nature as they transgress the boundaries of patriarchal female definition during the in-between stages of their lives.36 Maidens such as Margret and Perdita show one aspect of the mythic "Earth Mother" figuration as beautiful enchantresses - virgin springs and forests wrapped in human flesh - viewed with the patriarchal eye, fit for "productive" use. But the very reproductive use to be reaped is shrouded in mystery, and its product is a possible threat as Leontes' fear of cuckoldry dramatically illustrates. The women examined here are the sibyls and priestesses of another time. Dramatists of the early modern period have reflected not</page><page sequence="17">Monika Karpinska 443 only the gender -role anxieties of their time but also the backward links to representations of the female in her most ancient form; her anachronistic presence in these plays demonstrates how the beauty, power, and knowledge of the unknown continues to disrupt patriarchal knowns.
