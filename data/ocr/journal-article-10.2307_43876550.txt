After civilized man has had every thing which he can desire in season, his next wish is to heighten the enjoyment by consummation at extraor- dinary seasons . The merit here consists in conquering nature .7 - J. C. Loudon Prior to Rudolph Jacob Camerarius's definitive study of plant sexuality in 1694, De Sexu Plantarium Epistola , the literal and metaphorical means by which fertility and sex have guided a landscape's design, use, and interpretation were most often framed according to their significance in human sexuality.2 The cultivation of landscape as a stage for physical delight and sensual pleasure established the garden as both a setting for, and symbol of, sexual expression.3 Garden iconography, which referred to romantic or erotic themes contained within classical narratives; and dense vegetation, which afforded seclusion and privacy, together helped facilitate this dual role. The spatial relationships these elements lent gardens from antiquity to the eighteenth century provided romanti- cized settings for courtship rituals and sexual trysts.4 c CD C O -c y a £ c 0 oc -O co 1 ;S ~î c M- 1 ! c M- c i I c ¥ . f I s S g ° «&gt;-§ a&gt; a o a a) è ao "a ^ 3 Í2 C CD 3 Q3 •:r Q O S M £ g, 3 £ M LU £ I 5 1 1 l- I- LU 5 l-</page><page sequence="2">Plants, particularly flower species, were also considered relative to anthropomorphic referenc- es, or for their symbolization of human sexuality and fertility.5 Classified as members of a lower order within the Aristotelian worldview, their own sexual traits remained both unacknowledged and therefore largely unobserved. In the exceptional case in which male and female plants of a specific species were recognized and actively cultivated, as in the Mesopotamian date palm plantations circa 885 B.C.E, intuitive knowledge regarding plant sex was verified empirically through methods of artificial fertilization that had been perfected over several centuries. Since fruit production required gametes from both sexes, male flowers, and thus male pollen, were entwined with female flowers to ensure pollination.6 The fertilization process, made evident by Camerarius's findings, led him to sense the science's potential use: "The difficult question, which is also a new one, is whether a female plant can be fertilized by a male of another kind... and whether, and in what degree altered, a seedling will arise therefrom/'7 The developments within botanical science and related cultivation technologies have intro- duced a scale shift from the human body to the flower, such that the garden's evocation of hu- man interaction is juxtaposed with the cellular level of plant reproduction. This essay provides a broad overview of human intervention in plant reproduction; gauges the ability to precipi- tate propagation, pollination, and gene transfer; and assesses the influence such acceleration techniques exert on planting practices and vegetation characteristics within human designed landscapes.8 accelerated propagation In J.C. Loudon's An Encyclopedia of Gardening, an extensively detailed historical and technical overview of landscape gardening first published irn822, he stated that "scientific processes and operations include the master-operations of gardening as an art of culture. These opera- tions are all mechanical; but some depend, for their beneficial result, on chemical changes... but the greater number are dependent on the laws of vegetable life."9 Loudon systematically cataloged and described those techniques by which orchard and ornamental vegetation can be propagated by both seed and vegetative means {fig . 7), and emphasized early plant prepa- ration as one method by which to accelerate vegetative growth.10 His considerations under- scored the importance a scientific understanding of plant sexuality imparted to maximizing landscape and agricultural cultivation. In utilization in Babylonian date and fig production as early as 4,000 years ago, the vegetative propagation techniques Loudon detailed take advantage of a plant cell's regenerative potential 57</page><page sequence="3">2 Micropropagation of rice plant.

As opposed to seed propagation, vegetative propagation retains all the genetic material of the parent plant; all of the resulting off- spring are clones, and thereby maintain all of the unique characteristics that would be lost through sexual reproduc- tion. The lack of genetic diversity in a landscape of clones increases the landscape's susceptibility to devastation from insect infestation and blights. Yet, despite the disadvantages, vegetative propagation, in particular from cuttings, permits the generation of new stock in a limited space, at a faster rate, with a higher percentage of propagation success, and for a theoretically indefinite time.12 Developed at the turn of the twentieth century, and first put into practical use with orchid production in 1922, contempo- rary vegetative micropropagation techniques stimulate new plant development through the placement of tissue culture into an artificial growth medium under sterile conditions (fig. 2). Operating at the cellular level, the process demonstrates the cell's capability to form a full plant. Not unlike scions grafted onto disease resistant rootstock, micropropagation protects the new plants from pathogens; isolates desirable traits for new varieties at the cell level; utilizes little parent material; and, perhaps most critically, permits rapid multi- plication.13 artificial insemination Although beekeeping for honey production had existed as a practice for over 4,000 years, the insect's role in flower pol- lination remained unproven until Arthur Dobbs' discovery in 1750.14 His observations led him to conclude the insect's role in cross-fertilization, and confirmed Aristotle's observation that bees confined themselves to singular plant species dur- ing individual runs for pollen and nectar.15 However, despite Dobbs' findings, the potential influence of honey bees in pol- lination of specific plant species was not studied until M.B. Waite's publication Pollination of Pear Flowers in 1895. In the United States, migratory hives for honey production began in 1895, while renting of colonies for crop pollination began in 191o.16 Aided by moveable frame hives, this migratory prac- tice replaced the use of woven baskets, or skeps, such that mobile hives distributed among crop fields {fig. 3) replaced the construction of bee boles or freestanding bee houses.17 Honey bees have an effective pollination range of 180 meters, which suggests that the hives be placed at intervals of 150 to 180 meters. According to a Cornell University study published in 2000, the bee pollination industry contributes $14.6 billion to crop cultivation within the United States. Of the 2.9 million hives, nearly one million were trucked to California almond orchards alone, thereby demonstrating the national level at which hives operate, on the one hand; as well as a pattern of travel based on the reproductive cycles of the various crops being grown, on the other.18 In this regard, human manage- ment serves as an agent in large-scale pollination processes, including the selective breeding of plants more attractive to bees, as well as the breeding of bees for a particular prefer- ence for specific crops.19 gene manipulation The 300 species of the more than 3,000 edible plants cur- rently cultivated for food production have undergone, to dif- fering degrees, selective breeding at some stage in order to improve any number of traits, including yield rates, fruit size, taste, disease resistance, or even salt tolerance.20 The pro- cess has been fundamental to agricultural production since human populations transitioned from a nomadic to an agrari- an existence, and serves as a foundation by which subsequent genetic manipulation can be understood. Agricultural development is predicated on a process of domestication, whereby specific desirable traits exhibited by a few plants- such as ease of harvest- provided the seed base for subsequent crop generations. This domestica- tion produced plants whose propagation led to ever great- er harvests, even as the propagation cycles resulted in the plant species' gradual loss of natural defense mechanisms. In essence, humanity and cultivated crop species became co-dependent: humanity provided an environment in which the plants could thrive, while the plant provided the needed sustenance for growing populations.21 A number of scientific and technological advances that arose in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries initiated signifi- cant shifts in propagation practices, culminating in the Green Revolution in the mid twentieth century. Mechanical equip- ment increased the amount of seed that could be collected and planted; the invention of chemical fertilizers increased seed propagation, and, by extension, crop yields; finally, hybridization, based on Mendel's Laws of Heredity, produced 59</page><page sequence="5">6o new cultivars whose sexual traits maximized productiv- ity and disease resistance, while simultaneously decreasing labor, fertilizer, and water inputs.22 However, each change in a planťs genetic characteristics has ushered in adaptations in diseases and pests. The practice of cross breeding has further decreased plant diversity, given the tendency to cross breed between a limited genetic base. As a result, increased yields became more and more dependent on chemical inputs.23 Biotechnology has arisen to address the above limitations, and has further decreased the scale by which the propagation of plants is defined. Biotechnology, in general terms, relies on basic molecular proteins as building blocks for produc- ing new, desired traits (fig. 4). 24 The technology permits the transfer of genetic material between organisms, including the transfer of genes from one species to another. Even in the instance when the gene transfer is between members of the same species, viruses are utilized as the vector by which the gene is spliced into its new host. It is the cross between spe- cies barriers that has raised the greatest concerns and the most vocal criticisms, yet there is additional unrest involving how the changed organism could introduce unpredictable genetic material into the ecosystem.25 68 percent of transgenic crops are planted in the United States, with many of the crops altered either to increase their resis- tance to herbicides, or to produce their own natural insecti- cide. The intent is to reduce chemical use, which has obvious benefits to the surrounding ecosystem. Gene transfer devel- ops these traits at a rate significantly faster than traditional cross breeding. Yet agricultural crops are not the only plants that could be altered through these techniques. Programming for salt or drought resistance would be beneficial for plant propagation in a range of environments, agricultural or forest- ed alike.26 Similarly, reproductive methods that eliminate the need for sexual propagation by seed are being investigated. Seeds collected from plants originally grown from genetically modified or even hybrid seed stock cannot be planted, since the sexual traits will not match those of the parents. Due to this, most major seed companies, such as Monsanto, have to produce new seed to be sold each growing season. To coun- ter this, and to "simplify breeding schemes and genetically perpetuate" a particular plant hybrid, the hope is to exploit crosses between plants that reproduce asexually.27 conclusion Contemporary large scale landscapes, faced with protracted implementation schedules, and often times ecologically de-</page><page sequence="6">4 Polymer Chain Reaction test for presence of alleles with known function.

OMA's competition entry for Downsview Park in Toronto, and Field Operations' Fresh Kills Park on Staten Island, are two such projects whose vegetation establishment is contingent on the rapid propagation and maturation of plant stock. In each project, cuttings from vegetation planted in nurseries located on site could serve as one method by which each respective Park's vegetation is propagated and grown.28 In West 8's 1992 master- plan for Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, honey bee hives were programmed as one component of the design strategy in order to help pollinate the site's extensive clover fields and 25,000 birch tree stands, thereby increasing the rate at which the landscape matured.29 These examples point to the consideration of landscape as a place born of specific processes. J.B. Jackson, in his essay "The Word Itself," defined landscape as "a space deliberately created to speed up or slow down the process of nature. As Eliade expresses it, it represents man taking upon himself the role of time."30 Jackson's statement has been referenced in contemporary landscape architectural theory to emphasize the means by which landscape architecture can engage dynamic processes in the implementation and management of built landscapes. In context of the above propagation practices and plant related biotechnology, Jackson's statement parallels Loudon's own observations, in which he states that "vegetation is accelerated, retarded and modified, almost at the will of the operator; and this is done by processes, which suppose him to possess a considerable degree of physiological and chemical science, as well as practical skill and mechanical dexterity."31 In this regard, the application of techniques that take advantage of plants' cellular regeneration capabilities, pol- lination strategies, and gene transfer provide opportunities to cultivate vegetation capable of accelerated establishment, long term resilience, and performing an ecological service. These techniques, however, must respect the need to maintain species diversity; ensure that genetic manipulation remains environmentally benign once the plant becomes a component of a much larger ecosystem; and, utilize the processes that surround a flower's development as a setting by which the body experiences place. 61</page><page sequence="7">Endnotes i John Claudius Loudon, An Encyclopedia of Gardening, vol. 2 (New York and London: Garland, 1982; London: Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, and Longman, 1835 enlarged edition), 675.

Camerarius's De Sexu Plantarium Epistola (Letter Concerning the Sex of Plants), published 1694, Tubingham, Germany, was the first series of experiments to identify the male and female reproductive organs in plants. Sachs' incredibly comprehensive study frames the development of this botanical knowledge in context of allied fields in the physical and philosophical sciences.

Prest equates gardens designed for physical delight as an anti- Paradise, a reference to the two Creation stories depicted in Genesis. Toward this, Prest notes that a consequence of the consumption of knowledge, and thereby expulsion from Eden, could be understood as the awak- ening of sexual differences and erotic desire. 4 A number of essays are to be noted in regard to their discussion of human sexuality and erotic themes within the garden. In regard to iconography, David R. Coffin's "Venus in the Eighteenth-Century English Garden," Garden History 28, no. 2 (2000): 173-93, provided a founda- tion by which statuary and imagery within garden structures referenced fertility and eroticism. Likewise, Michael Niedermeiens "Strolling Under Palm Trees: Gardens- Love- Sexuality," Journal of Garden History 17 (1997): 186-207, discussed a number of these issues relative to Eighteenth Century German gardens. A.R. Littlewood's "Romantic Paradises: The Role of the Garden in the Byzantine Romance," Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies 5 (1979): 95-114, and Karen Harvey's "Gender, Space, and Modernity in Eighteenth-Century England: A Place Called Sex," History Workshop Journal 51 (2001): 158-79, http://www.jstor.org/stable/4289725, examined the garden's use in literature as a symbolic setting for romantic or sexual engagements. Finally, Mirka Beneš's "Recent Developments and Perspectives in the Historiography of Italian Gardens," in Perspectives on Garden Histories, ed. Michel Conan (Washington D.C.: Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, 1999) 37-76, http://www.doaks.org/publications/doaks_online_publications/Perspectives/perspeco3.pdf, notes the erotic activities that occurred in Italian gardens as revealed by a number of diaries, including the Marquis de Sade's travel diary to Rome during the eighteenth century. I am further indebted to Prof. Beneš for her insight and discussions on this topic. 5 Elizabeth Hyde, Cultivated Power: Flowers, Culture, and Politics in the Reign of Louis XIV (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 2005), 3-19. Hyde's book describes the manner in which plants were compared to human male and female body parts, in addition to noting their symbolic importance for various life events: loss of virginity, marriage and sexual union, death; fertility rituals during planting and harvesting; and the exertion of cultural power, if not male dominance. 6 George Sarton, "The Artificial Fertilization of Date-Palms in the Time of Ashur-Nasir-Pal B.C. 885-860," Isis 21, no. 1(1934): 8-13, http://www. jstor.0rg/stable/224804. Most plant species do not have separate male and female plants, containing, instead, male and female reproductive organs within a single flower. Given the Greeks' contention that plants were of a lesser order than animals, and therefore sexless, the process of reproduction remained less evident. The date palm is the exception. As a critical fruit bearing tree for the Assyrians, both economically and food-wise, the need to have both sexes for successful cultivation came to be known. See also A.H. Pruessner, "Date Culture in Ancient Baby- lonia," The American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures 36, no. 3(1920): 213-32, http://www.jstor.org/stable/528126. For a general discussion of date trees and early plant hybridization, see H.F. Roberts' Plant Hybridization Before Mendel (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1929), 1-15. As Roberts notes, the fact that other plants could be improved utilizing artificial fertilization, as in the date palm, never materialized for reasons that remain unexplained. 7 Roberts, Plant Hybridization Before Mendel, 15.

Human populations had harvested honey from wild nests at least as early as 8,000-2,000 B.C.E., as evidenced by Mesolithic paintings found in Spain. The earliest evidence for beekeeping as a practice, in which humans constructed colonies for honey production, were found in bas-relief scenes in Egypt that date back to 2,400 B.C.E. Verne Grant, "Arthur Dobbs (1750) and the Discovery of the Pollination of Flowers by Insects," Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club 76, no.3(i949): 217-19. Despite Julius von Sachs' declaration that Joseph G. Koelreuter was the first to recognize the insect's role in flower pol- lination in 1761 (see History of Botany 1530-1860, page 409), Dodd's connection between the bee and flower pollination was submitted to the Royal Society of London eleven years earlier. 15 Grant, "Arthur Dobbs", 219.

Apomixis is the process by which plants reproduce asexually, whereby the embryo develops without the paternal genome. As a clone of the mother, desirable gene combinations can be maintained. With the additional engineering of male sterility, gene flow through pollen transfer would aid in the containment of transgenes. 28 Current nursery practices for Fresh Kills' North Park indicate the development of stock through the use of potted containers. No indication was given as to the plant source, be it seed or vegetative. The suggestion for accelerating propagation vegetatively is purely speculative.
