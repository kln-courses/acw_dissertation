<plain_text><page sequence="1">Foreword In this special issue of SubStance we celebrate the centennial of Henri Bergson's Creative Evolution. Published in 1907, it has lost none of its relevance?in fact, as the content of this issue hopes to convey, it might well be that we are only now able to appreciate its far-reaching insights. After having set much of the agenda for twentieth-century philosophy (William James and American pragmatism, Ricoeur and history, Sartre and nothingness, Deleuze and differentiation, as well as engagements with Einstein, and of course the study of evolution), Bergson seemed to have exited the philosophical awareness around the late 1930s. If the great conferences on Bergson at his one hundredth birthday in 1959 were more akin to the form of extended obituaries, we can say that another 50 years down the line, Bergson appears to be alive and well.1 It is this sense of a flourishing of projects that we have attempted to transmit with this issue. More a matter of philosophical honesty than of hedging one's bets, Bergson always stressed that a final and complete knowledge of the world could only come at the expense of a world that is fully completed and without change. Since evolution is a living process and not a completed history, any understanding of it must necessarily be open-ended. If no one can have the last word, Bergson writes, the project of understanding evolution "will only be built up by the collective and progressive effort of many thinkers, of many observers also, completing, correcting and improving one another." With this appeal in mind, we have sought out authors from various backgrounds to write on Bergson and creative evolution. We present to you work from Bergson scholars seasoned and new, from the United States, Japan, France and Great Britain. Among the texts is the first English translation of a series of recently-discovered lectures that Deleuze gave in 1960 on the third chapter of Creative Evolution. Topics in our issue range from Bergson's encounters with Darwin, Nietzsche, Derrida and Deleuze, and from the analytical to the metaphysical. Preceding the articles are a few particularly relevant excerpts from a course on metaphysics taught by Bergson in 1887-88, in which he discusses different concepts of life, materialism and vitalism. Michael Vaughan opens this issue with his "Introduction to Creative Evolution." He situates the work both within the context of Bergson's other writings as well as in the context of work done in biology and complexity theory.

Bergson did not simply find inspiration in the sciences, but through sustained and thorough research into those fields, was able to create a partnership between philosophy and the sciences. It follows that Creative Evolution cannot be adequately understood from within philosophy alone. Situating it within the context of the sciences thus serves to introduce us to some of the main topics in the remainder of this issue. In "Bergson's Creation of the Possible," Pete Gunter discusses the problem of how to resist our natural investment in the idea that everything in existence is an instance of some pre-existing possibility. It was Bergson's conviction that the belief in the ready-made and in the possible provides one of the main supports for deterministic thought. Gunter discusses Bergson's critique of the idea of the possible, which shows this to be an anthropomorphism: it is to confuse our utility directed action with the movement of creation in the evolution of life. The notion of possibility assumes the existence of a plan that is somehow executed. But if we do away with the notion of the possible, does this not make all development into a random sequence of events? How then to understand life's continuity? It is to the concept of memory that we must turn. In Creative Evolution Bergson greatly expands this concept, developing a concept of memory that is not only retentive, but creative. As Gunter shows, it is memory as elan vital and its inherent limited capacity that allows for the creation of forms. Paul-Antoine Miquel, in "From an Immanentist to an Emergentist approach to Evolution: Between Bergson and Darwin," discusses the troubled relation of Bergson and Darwin. Often they have been portrayed as opposites: vitalism versus mechanism. And Bergson himself contributed to this (mis)understanding. But, as Miquel demonstrates, between Darwin and Bergson there is much less disagreement than between the schools of neo-Darwinism and Bergson. Through a careful reading of certain examples used by Darwin and Bergson, the opposition of vitalism and mechanism changes to one of immanentism versus emergentism. Though the one claimed or aimed to understand life from "within" and the other to offer a description from "without,", the conceptual mechanisms used to explain the appearance of new qualities are, in fact, strikingly similar. In his "Beyond the Human Condition: An Introduction to Deleuze's Lecture Course," Keith Ansell Pearson offers much more than a simple introduction to Deleuze's lectures on Creative Evolution. Rather, Deleuze's lecture transcripts occasion an inquiry into Deleuze's relation to Kant SubStance #114, Vol. 36, no. 3, 2007</page><page sequence="3">Foreword 5 and the post-Kantian tradition, and into the endeavor to think beyond the human condition. It is to Bergson's dual genesis of matter and intellect that we must turn to see how the Kantian project needs to be radicalized in order to be completed. Where Kant considered the forms of thought to be fixed and immobile, and thus the metaphysical project completed, Bergson urges us to consider how both matter and intellect have shaped and are continually shaping each other. It is in this sense that we should understand what Ansell Pearson sees as the main inspiration that Deleuze found in Bergson: to think beyond the human condition. The "beyond" here means to extend and improve our perception; to move from the ready-made to a world of becoming. Gilles Deleuze, as is well known, was strongly influenced by Bergson. His 1960 "Lecture Course on Chapter Three of Bergson's Creative Evolution" was recently discovered among some manuscripts, and is presented here for the first time in an English translation by Bryn Loban. Delivered between his 1956 article, "Bergson's Conception of Difference," and his 1966 book, Bergsonism, the lecture course gives both a fascinating reading of Creative Evolution and an intimate insight into Deleuze's relation to Bergson. How are we to have a true "genetic philosophy"?one that does not derive matter from intelligence or intelligence from matter (as the German Idealists supposedly tried to do), but in a form of reciprocality? This was Bergson's well-known dual-genesis theory: matter is as much shaped by intelligence as intelligence is moulded upon matter. Secondly, to think in terms of becoming means to remove any recourse to ontological negativity. When the nothing is removed, the question becomes one of differentiation. For Deleuze, this was Bergson's other major advance?to show us the difference between difference in kind and difference in degree. In "Matter and Light in Creative Evolution," Pierre Montebello continues this problem of the co-genesis of matter and intellect. He analyzes how Bergson tried to think matter as being of the same nature as the self. Montebello's analysis offers support to Bergson's somewhat puzzling claim that science, too, touches the absolute. Between 1850 and 1950, science underwent a paradigmatic change, where atomism gave way to the notion of fields of forces. When the external world becomes "as light" (waves, fields of forces, movement), we can see how it approaches our own "psycho-vital" essence (duration). As Montebello points out, these themes have an interesting parallel development in the then-contemporary artistic trend known as the "Rayonnist Movement." In "Life and Will in Nietzsche and Bergson," Arnaud Francois compares Nietzsche's will to power to Bergson's elan vital. He shows how SubStance #114, Vol. 36, no. 3, 2007</page><page sequence="4">6 Michael Kolkman through a shared critique of (neo-)Darwinism and of traditional concepts of the will, both come to posit will or duree [duration] as the fabric of life itself, thus rejecting any separation between appearance and the thing in-itself. Although they both come to formulate an "ontology of the will," they in fact posit not one movement, but two. That is to say, there is also a movement that runs counter to the will. How are we to understand Bergson's insistence on the finite nature of the elan vital, or Nietzsche's description of the will to power as a fixed force? Again, the answer lies in the appeal to think life and creativity in a non-quantitative manner, as both wholly positive and somehow limited. We conclude this issue on Creative Evolution with Hisashi Fujita's "Bergson's Hand: Towards a (non)-organic History of Vitalism." Here Fujita aims to contribute to a reconciliation between Derrida and Deleuze by returning to Bergson. He criticizes Derrida for offering a one-sided reading of Bergson's "haptico-optical" model (in Derrida's On Touching, Jean-Luc Nancy). By following the example and metaphor of "the hand" as it runs throughout Bergson's work, Fujita opens up the field of "bio logics," of the relation of organization and normativity, of creation and technology. Intuition is not a naive immediatism, just as the elan is not boundless creation. In fact, as Fujita writes, Bergson was probably the first to point out that mechanism and biology are not opposed, but are reciprocally implicated. We hope this issue will demonstrate the diversity and vitality of contemporary work inspired by Bergson. The articles presented here take their cue from Creative Evolution, and thus in no way exhaust the range of topics Bergson discussed. His thoughts on the metaphysics of time, on psychology and psychopathology, on memory, art and theater all provide rich sources of inspiration. To give the last word to Bergson: "Life is a source that does not waste since it always replenishes itself." Michael Kolkman University of Warwick Note 1.
