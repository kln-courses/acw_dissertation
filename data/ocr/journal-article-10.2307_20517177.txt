<plain_text><page sequence="1">348 DIVINE GRACE. V. THE SALVATION OF INFIDELS. T HE problem proposed for solution at the conclu sion of the previous article is briefly this: Formal faith, that is the belief in the funda mental truths of supernatural revelation because they have been revealed and rest on God's authority, is so necessary for salvation in the case of all adults that nothing can replace it. It is simply indispensable for the attainment of our supernatural destiny. Such faith is not merely obligatory as a precept, which binds only those who are aware of it; it is a sine qua non for every normal adult. This is a theological conclusion so certain that it would imperil our otthodoxy to question it. Still more certain and unquestionable is the doctrine that supernatural grace is necessary before we can elicit an act of formal faith. Even what is known as the beginning of faith, that is, the acts of intellect and will by which we prepare ouirselves for the first assent of formal faith, requires the aid of strictly supernatural grace. The Council of Orange has de fined this against the semi-Pelagians. On the other hand the universality of the salvific will of God demands that all men, even negative infidels, or those to whom the true faith has never been sufflciently announced, should receive at least remotely sufficilent grace for salvation. It follows in strictest logic that all must at some time or other get grace at least re motely sufficient for supernatural faith. How is this accomplished in the case of the many millions who never hear the true faith expounded or proclaimed? The difficulty is a serious one and has elicited many tentative solutions, in the absence of clear revelation on the point; for it may be admitted that God has not fully enlightened us on the point and it has been left to speculative theology to harmonise the data we</page><page sequence="2">DIVINE GRACE. 349 possess, as best it may. I will enumerate the various suggestions put forward. 1. The first opinion asserts that God has made faith universally accessible through a universal church which has the commission and makes the endeavour to spread the knowledge of truth to all mankind. But as this must be done through human agents who are free and may or may not accept the call to carry the good tidings to pagan lands, numbers are deprived of the grace of faith, not through their own personal fault, but through the failure of others to co-operate with the grace of apostolic vocation. God's salvific will would, in this view, be conditional and dependent on the consent of -wills other than those of the infidels in question. A somewhat similar reply is made by many with regard to infants who die without baptism, namely, that wherever this happens the parents, nurses, doctors, priests or attendant Christians are to blame in some way or other. But, first, the assertion appears gratuitous even as regards infants. It is a bold assumption to make that no child dies unbaptised without moral fault on the part of someone. Secondly, if this were true it would indeed be a tolerably good solution of the difficulty in the case of unbaptised babies, who only forfeit that supernatural beatitude which baptism would bring, and certainly are not con signed to the hiell of the damned; but it would afford a very poor anablogy for the case of adult infidels, de prived of faith through someone else?ls want of zeal. For it is generally assumed that these either attain the Paradise of the jusHt or (ultimately) the Gehenna of thle lost.' And it would seem self-evident that God could niot condemn anyone to ain eternity of torment for any tling less than hiis own personal sin. 2. A second opinion holds that all adults re ceive at some time in their lives a private I The reason assigned for this assunmption is the common sentiment of the faithful. To examine it at length would carry us into some tangled bye-paths of theology We can here decline the task, as the exceptions if any, would o relatively rare; and we are now con (criled witEl the genoral pr-ovilence of Cod in respect to adults.</page><page sequence="3">350 THE IRISH MONTHLY. revelation about the most essential truths of faith at least. This is sup'ernatural and enables them, if they will, to elicit an act of formal faith in the exist ence of God, the judge and rewarder of human con duct. This theory certainly solves the difficulty. But it is usually rejected as lacking sufficient basis in his tory. We cannot discover any solid reason for assert ing that all pagans get private supernatural revelation in this way; and merely natural belief in God arrived at by human reason Is no adequate motive for super natural faith. 3. A third view is linked with the name of Ripalda, most original and daring of speculative theologians, who propounded for discussion the opinion that perhaps fides lata, or faith based upon reason and the testimony of creatures to the existence of the Creator, could suffice for salvation, if it be supposed that God gives strictly supernatural grace to all men for the performance of all ethically good acts. This hypothesis, again, would solve the difficulty. But the first part of it is simply untenable because of St. Paul's teaching about faith and the definitions of Trent and Vatican. The second part, the universality of strictly supernatural grace, is also highly doubtful. It is generally rejected, though not as decisively as the former proposition, which even its author shrank from actually embracing at the start, and abandoned in his posthumous work on faith, as being less secure and less accepted. 4. A fourth opinion supposes that infidels get supernatural assistance in all grave temptations by which they are enabled to observe the natural law. If they correspond to this divine assistance, they merit, not strictly but congruously as the expression is, the announcement of the Gospel, or a private revelation, at least when death draws near. This differs from Ripalda's view in that it does not suppose supernatural grace given for all ethically good acts, and from the second opinion above mentioned in that it assumes a private revelation only in the case of those who have earned it in a certain sense by previous correspond</page><page sequence="4">DIVINE GRACB. 351 ence with grace. Further, It finds some support in many passages from the Fathers, as Pore Harent has demonstrated in his article: Le Salut des Infidtles: Dictionnaire de la Th6ologie, v. vii. col. 1847, sqq. Nevertheless criticism makes it difficult to hold be cause it supposes strictly stupernaturttl grace before the call to formal faith, which seems excluded by the teaching of St. Paul, St. Augustine, Trent aind Vati can. Some have endeavoured to save it by saying that all the acts of moral victory performed witlh the aid of grace pertain to fides tnchoata or initial faitl. This is ingenious certainly and just tenable, but not very convincing or reconcilable with theological traditionl. 5. Vasquez propounds a theory in many respects akin to the former. According to him God grants to all men in virtue of Christys merits a moral assistance in every good act which he calls cogitatio congrua, a con gruiouis thought. This is entitatively natural, but supernatural in the man-ner of giving. With its aid man can avoid sin, and if he does so God will infallibly make formal faith possible to him. The objection to Vasquez's system is that it establishes a mneans of positive moral causality between the natural and supernatural orders such as the coxndemnation of Secni Pelagianism renders untenable. It differs indeed from Semi-Pelagianism, but not suffliciently. 6. The opinion that formerly at least won most suffrages bears an apparently close resemblance to the hypothesis of Vasquez, yet differs from It in one impor tant detail. It'suipposes that infidels obtain medicinal grace, entitatively natural, suipernatuiral in the man ner of giving, to lhelp them in overcominlg grave temnpta tions and observing the na-tural law. If then they do all that in them lies with tlis preliminary aid God will assuredly secuire, by a miracle if needs be, that the faith will be announced to them before they die, whether this be by a human preacher or an angelic visitant. Yet their obserNration of thie natuiral law is not meritorious of the grace of faith nor evell a positive disposition, but only a negative disposition. That is to say, it re</page><page sequence="5">852 TIE IRISHI MONHLDY. moves the obstacle of personal sin which is the great impediment to the operation of God's providential arrangement for human salvation. The reason, there fore, why so many infidels never receive the grace of faith is because they have not co-operated with the earlier and lesser graces ty avoiding sins against the natural law. Hence the absence of faith is culpable at least in its remoter causes. This explanation does indeed meet all the requisites of the problem, and has the support of many great names, St. Thomas, for example, Suarez, and many more. But obviotqsly the miraculous arrival of a preacher, as the prophet Habacuc was conveyed of old, or the angel coming to reveal to the good pagan the essential truths of faith, looks very like a deus ex machina of the theologians; and the distinction between entitatively supernatural and entitatively natural grace has found many opponents in our own days, notably Cardinal Billot. 7. Since the beginning of the 19th century an ex planation has come into some favour, which is attrac tive and may well be the right one in some few cases at least. The truths of revelation which it is absolutely necessary for salvation to believe are, according to the commoner teaching of theology, only two, namely, that there is a God and that He is the remunerator of good and evil deeds. "1 He who approaches God," says St. Paul, "must believe that He is and is the rewarder." Now this central core, so to speak, of faith is found in many false religions-not merely in schism or heresy, but in Mahomedanism, and probably even underlying the errors of polytheism. The study of Comparative Religion points clearly enough to vestiges of primitive monotheism in many polytheistic lands, and enlightened minds in paganism have nearly always apprehended, beneath the gross anthropomorphism of popular beliefs, the supreme power that made the world and rules the lives of men. Most religions, even in Central Africa or among the Bushmen of Australia, have also their arcana religiosa, or religious mysteries, including sacred</page><page sequence="6">DIVINE GRACE. 353 dogmas, which are handed down from generation to generation and purport to be the revelation of the Deity, howsoever named. It has been suggested that this is simply the primitive revelation made by God to man at the beginning of his career and preserved as a sort of heavenly spark under the heap of dead ashes concealing, but not extinguishing it. If so it would be super-natural revelation, and wvould contain at least the bare mini mum of faith absolutely requisite for salvation. An infidel receiving this as the voice of God would be a fit recipient of supernatural grace, and if he acted in accordance with the lights and graces given him would have the possibility of salvation in his own hands. It should be added that this view differs from Tradi tionalism, which denied the possibility of a natural knowledge of God by the light of reason. The supposi tion here made relates to realm of historic fact, and, whether right or wrong, does not share the error of the Traditionalists. 8. But Cardinal Billot, in a series of articles in Lee Etudes (20 Oct., 1919-20 Dec., 1920), after discussing the various explanations hitherto proposed, and finding them inadequate, seeks along other lines to minimise the number of mankind apparently doomed to perdition through lack of formal faith. He holds that among pagans the moral and religious awakening by no means synchronises with what is ordinarily understood as the dawn of reason. Indeed many of them remain all their lives in a state of moral and religious infancy. They have not, therefore, the same responsibility as adults would have in cultural lanids, who can arid do hear re ligious and moral questions discutssed, who have at any rate a knowledge of ethical standards and philosophic specuilations. In this view multitudes of negative infidels would belong rather to the category of un baptised babies, and would meet in the world to come the fate of the latter, not the fate of adults consciously guilty of grievous sin and therefore condemned to the lot of the lost. They would in Limbo share the state of natural beatitude, perfect or imperfect, which modern theologians liberally assign to unbaptised infants.</page><page sequence="7">54 TPHE IRISH MONTHLY. PNre Harent criticises his fellow-couintryman's novel suggestion, and on the whole adversely. He protests against the inclusion of vast multitudes of adult infidels in the Limbo of children, and also against the modern tendency to look upon this Limbo as a state of more or less perfect natural happiness. In conclusion, he adds that none of the proposed theories can by itself alone be considered sufficient; but as they are not mutually ex clusive they give in their entirety a number of considera tions which may help to clear up a little point which God has chosen to leave in some obscurity. Opinions 6, 7 and 8, when combined, and they can be combined, will make us realise that God has many ways of work ing out His wondrovs plan and most adorable will, with out inj'ustice to any of His creatures, but with a sincere love for all things that He has made. Infants whose death without baptism is not their own fault are not punished in any strict sense of the word. They do not en ter into the glory of the Lord, but neither do they share the chains and penal fires of the reprobate. They lack a reward to which unelevated nature has no claim; but are not made to suffer the pains annexed to personal sin. Similarly, responsible adults, enjoying the full use of reason, either attain Heaven through an economy of grace, which brings it within their reach, or have them selves to blame, not any failure on the part of God, if they find themsellves excluded from it. But this state ment necessarily leaves undecided the thorny question as to when in given instatnces or circumstances respon sibility begins or how far it extends. " God searcheth the heart and the reins." : He and He alone knows the very complex factors that go to the creation of subjec tive morality. He will make all due allowance for the influence' of heredity, education, tradition, environ ment, retarded moral development, defective mental evolution-for everything, in short, that can be justly pleaded in excuse or palliation of the faults of men. It is because we know so little on all these points, and can never enter into another's heart, that our attempted answers are bUt guesses of more or less plausibility. P. J.
