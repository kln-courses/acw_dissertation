<plain_text><page sequence="1">Materiality and Autobiography in Baudelaire's "La Pipe" E. S. Burt In recent years, where materiality is under discussion the name of Baudelaire is rarely far off. Owing largely to the influence of readers of de Man and Benjamin it has joined allegory and irony as a term indissociable from the work of a poet who, for all the vaunted accessibility of his work, has left us some difficult poems to mull over through no less difficult concepts.' Given Baudelaire's well-known concern with the aesthetic and given also Benjamin's identification of Baudelaire as a poet of the disintegration of the aura (194), it is perhaps not surprising that this should be the case. For, according to one recent commentator, to assure "the stability of the category of the aesthetic"(Warminski, "Introduction," 3) an evasion or turning away from the text's materiality is required, just as the undoing of its stability requires a confrontation with it. The existence of both these apparently opposing trends in Baudelaire's work would thus tend to bring out materiality as a problem at its horizon. Whether considered a celebration of Art for Art's sake or an inquiry into the underside of aesthetics, Baudelaire's work would in both cases be haunted by materiality. The writer concerned with pointing out "the tatters, the cosmetics, the pulleys, the chains, the second thoughts, the scrawled- upon proofs, in short all the horrors that make up the sanctuary of art" (Baudelaire, 185; my translation) and the formalist for whom the point of writing poetry was to celebrate beauty would both ultimately be concerned with the same thing. DeMan's reading of Baudelaire's text as always containing both an enigmatic hypogram or infratext like "Correspondances" where a material vision is evident, and lyrical MLN 116 (2001): 941-963 ? 2001 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">E. S. BURT texts like "Obsession" that overlay it, has placed Baudelairian criti- cism on a path it seems set to follow for a while ("Anthropomorphism," 262). I am not interested in contesting the coupling of materiality with Baudelaire. Instead, I want to ask how it can help us read the poems, and more especially to consider at what point in reading a Baudelaire poem it becomes useful, and perhaps even necessary, to have re- course to such an enigmatic concept in order to progress. For it is not always necessary and indeed it might even sometimes be mislead- ing-encouraging misreading, through a confusion with materialism, if not in its loose sense of a preoccupation with material goods, then in its Marxist definition. In neither register does materialism quite fit with Baudelaire. When Baudelaire speaks of material or materialism, it is disparagingly, in opposition to the poet's preoccupation with spirit. And while it is true that an overriding interest in verbal econ- omy makes it possible to consider Baudelaire in the light of historical materialism as Benjamin has done, still, even a cursory acquaintance with Baudelairian dandyism or with such parts of Sartre's analysis as concern class solidarity and bad consciousness suggests that main- stream Marxist criticism will remain uneasy with Baudelaire. Material- ity may come up inevitably in conjunction with Baudelaire, but it takes something of an effort to make materialism do so. To ask when and where materiality arises in Baudelaire is not simply to say that one has to find its place in a literary analysis, to look for where it emerges as a problem in a language-oriented analysis. For, according to Andrzej Warminski, writing in Material Events of Paul de Man, de Man's analyses of Kant are not of "merely linguistic" problems. Rather, they are "analyses of how it is that something can, does, happen, how the 'next step' actually occurs" ("Poets," 23). The emergence of materiality, in other words, has everything to do with order, with taking steps, with things happening. That is what Warminski means when he speaks of a "material event" or material history. In asking about the point where materiality comes up as a necessary if problematic moment in a reading, we will have to consider the arrival of the poem and what it says about how events occur. Something can be said about what makes the notion of material event of interest for a study of autobiography. In concerning our- selves with how the poem reaches outside itself to touch the world in the event, we are naturally called upon to account for a referential dimension to language, a historicality presumed suspended when- ever, the aesthetic category being taken as stable, a formal analysis of 942</page><page sequence="3">M L N the poem's tropological system can be found sufficient, and its aim assumed to be achieved by a harmonious correspondence between meaning and form. This referential moment has to be distinguished from a naive understanding that starts out from the premise that the poem depicts the things and events of the natural world. Our concern is with the poem as event, with a pressure toward meaning that arises in conjunction with the recognition that the promised harmony cannot be achieved because the necessary closure cannot be deliv- ered. One of the effects of a stable aesthetics, the presumed corre- spondence of the inside meaning and the outside appearance, would be the ability to distinguish between referential and self-referential language use, prose and poetry. Where that stability comes into question, we have to abandon the model of carefully delineated contraries for a more ambiguous one where the difference between poem and prose, self-referring and referential language is not so clear cut. It becomes possible to think of reference itself as "something akin to a fiction" (de Man, 69), or to speculate that a fiction "may itself produce and determine the life" (69). One result is that one can think of the poem along the same lines as we think of an open-ended, unstable genre like autobiography, which also involves the interfer- ence of referential and self-referential language in the contradictory truth claims of fiction and history. Clearly, the Lejeunian definition of autobiography-"retrospective prose narrated by a real person of her own existence, in which the emphasis is placed on the individual life, especially, the story of her personality"-does not apply (14, my translation.) Even were Lejeune's definition broadened to include poetic texts like Wordsworth's Pre- lude, Baudelaire's poems are not pieces from a retrospective prose narrative written about himself. Baudelaire has written at most two poems that might conceivably qualify as autobiographical, without the autobiographical dimension of the poems helping us in the least toward an interpretation.2 With a poet like Hugo, we can have the illusion of understanding something if we know that a given poem appearing in a section of Les Contemplations meant to represent a father's grief at the death of his daughter was at first an epithalamion celebrating her marriage. But, with Baudelaire, it leads us nowhere except away from the poems to ask whether such and such a poem was inspired by Jeanne Duval's black hair or by the green-eyed Agathe. If we can talk about autobiography and materiality in Baudelaire, it is insofar as it is one of the defining traits of autobiog- raphy that the author "declares himself the subject of his own 943</page><page sequence="4">E. S. BURT understanding" ("Autobiography," 70), in the words of Paul de Man, and, conversely, another that he have to grapple with the linguistic, tropological nature of cognition, and thus with the possibility that his so-called life might have been shaped by literary models. The resultant impossibility of closure that dogs autobiography, which cannot even define itself without immediately requiring the inclusion of an exteriority it seems in its first gesture to have excluded, is perhaps best seen in the parable that Blanchot tells of St. Bonaventura. The poor saint finds himself condemned to die and to return to life over and over, the first in a vain attempt to bring his memoirs to a close and the second in order to write the story of the impossibility of doing so: This is reminiscent of one of the saints, Saint Bonaventura, who, as Chateaubriand recalls for us, was allowed as a favour by God to leave his tomb in order to finish his memoirs-strange favour! The writer must live on to recount his life and then, no doubt, must survive this survival to recount it in turn, and so on endlessly. (113) Having decided to write his story, Bonaventura has over and over to die and come to life again so as to write why he can neither finish nor leave open his story.3 Notice how impoverished Bonaventura's tale becomes. His memoirs do not reveal the rich variety of experience, nor do they embroider a wealth of pleasing patterns in which the imagination adorns experience. Writing in a time of survival, devoted exclusively to finishing his memoirs, Bonaventura has to undergo death over and over again as the direct result of having undertaken to write his memoirs. His writing will no doubt have a peculiar mo- notony to it that it derives from having just that one event of his death, over and over repeated, to worry about. Such glimpses of the world as would pass to us through his pen would be more distinct, set off in sharp relief by their status as penultimate experiences, and like a prisoner's last meal or last words, by their having become deperson- alized, purged of their experiential quality. In Baudelaire's prose poems we find a number of dramatic stagings of a conflict between a threatened lyrical subject and an impersonal structure that seem worthy of the pen of a Bonaventura. Les Fleurs du mal, too, as we hope to show, has an autobiographical dimension generally unrecognized because it shows up as the limit issue of the possibility and impossibil- ity of constituting an autobiographical subject. Several preliminary reasons can be found for picking the unpre- possessing sonnet called "La Pipe" to examine in connection with the 944</page><page sequence="5">M L N material event and autobiography. A first hint comes from the famous "secret architecture" of the collection. In the 1857 edition of Les Fleurs du mal, "La Pipe" ended the Spleen et Ideal section.4 By the 1861 edition, "La Pipe" had come to occupy a slightly different position- this time serving as the threshold poem to the Spleen cycle. In its 1857 position, as transition to the Tableaux parisiens with their allegorical, contemplative cast, it invited comparison with a poem like "Le Jeu," where a self-conscious poet, whose clairvoyant eye observes himself in the position of a misguided bystander, comments upon the limits of his understanding; or "Le Soleil," which features a poet who goes about "Tripping over words as over paving stones, / Sometimes knocking up against long dreamt lines" ("Trebuchant sur les mots comme sur les paves / Heurtant parfois des vers depuis longtemps reves")-a figure in which Cynthia Chase has rightly seen a poet confronted with the materiality of signs (135). In its 1861 position, "La Pipe" is liminal to the Spleen poems, which demystify the ideals of the self's unifying imagination and bring to the fore the material dimension of memory-witness the famous line where memory is described as "A big dresser with drawers laden by accounts, / Poems, love letters, lawsuits and ballads, / And heavy tresses rolled up in receipts" ("Un gros meuble a tiroirs encombre de bilans, / De vers, de billets doux, de proces, de romances, / Avec de lourds cheveux roules dans des quittances"). Despite his hesitation over the proper placement of the poem, then, Baudelaire has unwaveringly set it at transitional points to sections where materiality is a theme and the lyrical subject is reflecting on the limits of its understanding. It thus appears a likely place to ask about the emergence of the material dimension to the poem and to investigate the I's relation to that dimension.' The motif of tobacco provides another reason for the choice of the poem, and one that brings out the nature of the connection between materiality and the subject. With tobacco, states Derrida, Baudelaire finds an apt equivalent for the aporias of the gift and writing. In Given Time, tobacco is thought on the one hand as a type of gratuitous, luxurious consumption without return, pure expenditure, the depar- ture up in smoke of any appropriable remainder. In a similar vein, Richard Klein has argued that the excitation produced by tobacco has to be associated with the death principle and must be "removed from the economy of utility in which the expenditure of energy can be calculated, according to an equation of profit and loss" (45).6 On the other hand, consonant with the irreconcilable logics of an aporia, 945</page><page sequence="6">E. S. BURT tobacco is also eminently economic. Klein, writing on Sartre, notes that smoking "reveals the essence of appropriation-displays, in its most abstract form, the motive behind all desire to possess some- thing, to own at all" (37). Derrida too finds tobacco to be the kingpin in an exchange economy: a commerce is centered on it; the subject can organize its pleasure around it; as symbol of the symbolic, it grounds symbolic exchange; it engages the subject with others (109- 112). As such it stands for reappropriation, for what the subject takes into itself that feeds it as subject. The subject, that is: "reappropria- tion with surplus value, a certain capitalization" (101). Speaking of Baudelaire's "La Fausse monnaie" whose action takes place as two friends leave a tobacco shop, Derrida explains that tobacco frames the narrative with "a supplementary abyme, that absolute dissemina- tion that destines the text to depart in ashes or go up in smoke" (102). It is as if tobacco appeared at the point where claims for the subject's unity and autonomy associated with aesthetic categories seek a ground and find as well a radical loss of self-foundation. "La Pipe" provides evidence of the operation of an abyssal logic with respect to the subject. The poem dwells on the pipe's smoke and on the black residue left on its bowl, residue from which we are to get to know the pipe's master. Both smoke and residue are the leftovers of a "sumptuary expenditure" (112), the destruction of the natural product with a symbolic charge that is tobacco. We enjoy tobacco by making it go up in smoke, and the destruction of the natural plant, its leaving of a remainder in which "nothing natural remains" (112), tells us that as the phenomenal object is consumed, a material basis comes to the fore. The evaporation of the phenomenal tobacco is a last gasp experience. In smoking we use up the phenomenal world of subject and object and gain access to another mode, one that while it underlies the subject's relation to its experience, also threatens that subject with annihilation. At the same time, as we will also see, the poem's concern with the smoker's pleasure principle is very great. A depleted subject, one overcome by fatigue and sorrow, is restored by taking into itself the symbol of appropriation that is tobacco. In "La Pipe," tobacco lies at the point of passage between a phenomenal and a material relation to the text, and its function is ambiguously to refresh and to kill the subject. It is the disruptive surfacing and reabsorption of the aporia that makes for the event we are looking to localize. A passage from Les Paradis artificiels where Baudelaire is distinguish- ing between dreams according to their origins can help provide a first 946</page><page sequence="7">M L N unpacking of the aporia as it affects the I's psychic life. There are, he says, two sorts of artificial paradises, one of which is easily absorbed into a narrative of experience, and the other of which tends rather to be disruptive of such narratives. Some dreams have a natural origin, of which drug-visions, particularly drug-visions inspired by hashish, are one example. These "natural dreams" take the occurrences of everyday life and transform them via the sensuous imagination into metaphors (421). Visions entirely charming to those experiencing them, it is enough for the drug's effects to dissipate for the visions to fade away as well. Natural dreams faithfully reflect the subject who dreams them and, in the end, lend themselves to narratives telling of the growth and passage of an illusion. There also exist absurd visions that Baudelaire calls "hieroglyphic dreams" (408). These visions do not have an origin in the dreamer's relation to nature but seem rather to come from "a cause exterior to man" and to reflect a perspective that Baudelaire calls supernatural.' Such visions are puzzling. They are not dreams that pass as illusions; they remain like a dictionary of riddles to be deciphered by the sages: "It is a dictionary requiring study, a language to which the wise may obtain the key" (409, my translation). Their disruptive character is testified to by the fact that they remain after the conditions of sleep that have given them rise have disappeared, and also by their abrupt and mysterious emergence. In this typology of dreams, Baudelaire is distinguishing between two kinds of works of art. In the first case, the artificial paradises are linked to the imagination, representation and the substitutions of metaphor. In the second, figures involving difference like allegory or irony are more apposite, and the problem is not representation but the unrepresentable, not understanding but read- ing. The terms Baudelaire uses-dictionary and hieroglyphics-point to writing and reading as the operations necessary to produce and decipher hieroglyphic dreams. Both, he claims, are punctual: "[the dream] is a miracle whose punctuality has blunted its mystery (dont la ponctualite a emousse le mystere)" (408, my translation). What punctuality means, we may suspect, must vary according to whether the dream is natural or hieroglyphic. In keeping with the notion of the natural dream with its recombination of the materials left in the memory by the day's events, "ponctualite" can be a synonym for everydayness and banality: the dream is a repetitive phenomenon which does nothing more than recombine the events of the day into new patterns. It absorbs banality and transforms it, but so is it reabsorbed into it through repetition. 947</page><page sequence="8">E. S. BURT Punctuality also suggests exactness, however. Dreams arrive at the appointed time, even when-as is the case with hieroglyphic dreams- they are unforeseen, or as Baudelaire says, "unforeseen, without relation or connection to the character, the life and the passions of the sleeper" (408, my translation). This seems a feature of the enigmatic character of the hieroglyphic dream: a non-autobiographi- cal dream that arrives unforeseen and yet on time, as a scheduled and yet impossible occurrence. With the punctuality of the natural and the hieroglyphic dream, we are looking at very differing relations to the event: so far as the natural dream is concerned, the event is a happening of which the vision provides a sort of record, however transformed. With the hieroglyphic dream, the arrival of the dream, on the dot and unforeseen, makes for the event. How are these two dreams related to one another? Do they exist in isolation, as Baudelaire's typology suggests, or are they rather-as a reading of Les Paradis which takes into account that the book is itself a sort of dream about the drug-induced dream would show-related? Can the mysterious hieroglyphic dream attach itself to a natural dream as its incubus, and conversely, might the tendency of the natural dream be to absorb the hieroglyphic dream, by making the latter a sort of experience represented?8 While it is no doubt in the hieroglyphic dream that an access to materiality is available, such questions tell us that we cannot hope to proceed directly, but instead must look a little more closely at a poem, to get close up and personal with it-not necessarily an entirely pleasurable experience where, as in this case, a pipe exuding what Baudelaire elsewhere calls the "fetid odor of tobacco" (281) is concerned. La Pipe Je suis la pipe d'un auteur, On voit, a contempler ma mine D'Abyssinienne ou de Cafrine, Que mon maitre est un grand fumeur. Quand il est comble de douleur, Je fume comme la chaumine Ou se prepare la cuisine Pour le retour du laboureur. J'enlace etje berce son ame Dans le reseau mobile et bleu Qui monte de ma bouche en feu, 948</page><page sequence="9">M L N Etje roule un puissant dictame Qui charme son coeur et guerit De ses fatigues son esprit.9 "La Pipe" is written around the central figure of prosopopeia that gives voice to an absent, dead or inanimate being. The poet has given his I to the pipe and the grateful pipe returns this gift by turning itself toward relaxing the poet even as it celebrates its own powers. This is far from the only example of prosopopeia in Les Fleurs du mal. One thinks of the mother's curse in "Benediction," the false note's complaint of "Confession," the speaking eyes of "Les Promesses d'un visage," or, perhaps closer to "La Pipe," the wine poems where assassins and lovers speak under the influence of their wine of choice. In all of these poems, Baudelaire exercises the poet's right to attribute speech to what does not have it, and to speak indirectly both through the speeches themselves and also in his gesture of attribution. But, if not unique, this prosopopeia is certainly one of the most distinctive. Part of its distinctiveness is what the poem says about prosopopeia, the figure that one critic has identified as "the trope of autobiogra- phy" (de Man, "Autobiography," 76) and by means of which a writer like Rousseau, Wordsworth or Proust engages in a discourse of self- restoration to call a past self to life. The speaking pipe speaks about precisely that: the restoration of its master which it boasts it will achieve. "La Pipe" is thus set up as the self-portrait of the autobio- graphical figure of prosopopeia, as a celebration of its power to enable the restoration of the self. But, initially at least, the prosopopeia seems to have a different effect than the one intended. It does something that is also quite distinctive. The tool meant to enable self- restoration actually deprives the autobiographical subject of voice, absents it from the stage as speaker, makes it more like the inanimate object, a pipe, to whom voice has been given. "La Pipe" is about that effect of self-deprivation, about the way the figure for restoring takes over and keeps the autobiographical subject offstage. The referential situation of smoking is indicated here, for it is certainly true that the smoke signals of a pipe can only emerge where the smoker's mouth has been blocked by the smoking apparatus. Notice the effects of the transfer of speech: the inactive poet becomes in even more dire need of being restored, his passivity in marked contrast to the pipe's bustling activity of smoking, entwining, rocking, rolling, charming, healing. Whereas the pipe invites us to inspect its "mine," the poet is faceless and speechless. The transfer also has effects at the moral 949</page><page sequence="10">E. S. BURT level, in the freedom of action of each. Liberated from its servile condition, the pipe acts as a new Figaro to become master of the revels. It charms and flatters the poet, terming him ironically "maitre" and "auteur." It shows off its visage to the reader. As for the poet who has relinquished control, he is less a free agent than the target of the pipe's blandishments and activity. In short, by this awarding of voice, the pipe appears humanized, capable of action, passion and knowl- edge, whereas the poet has tended to become dehumanized. At the very least, the prosopopeia that speaks for itself, about its aims and its actual effects, defers the moment when we could talk about what the poet might mean by the prosopopeia. One critic goes so far as to claim that the poem has the contradictory central premise that the pipe rather than the poet wrote the poem. For Antoine Adam, the premise is playful and does not persuade. But Arden Reed contends that we have to take the pipe seriously. He appears to take the polysemy awakened in the poem by the proximity of like terms as evidence that a mechanical principle like contiguity is indeed opera- tive in a situation from which authorial will has evaporated. An accessory like a pipe makes a good figure for contingency as a motivating force. Thus, the proximity of the theme of seduction brings out a piper (to dupe, to decoy, to trick) in "La Pipe," or the Vulcan motif in the second stanza uncovers a lode worth mining in ma mine (Reed, 279). The accessory does not speak for the empirical author Baudelaire but for speaking by the accessory. The transfer of the poet's voice to the pipe, however, could be temporary and reversible, and the poet could ultimately get back the credit for whatever the pipe says. The referential situation of pipe- smoking that is the apparent origin for the poem suggests this. The poet's mouth is only blocked by the pipe for brief intervals in smoking and the pipe's eloquent smoke signals are stoked by the poet's act of drawing in air through its "bouche en feu." At this stage of the reading, the metaphorical transfers appear based on a repre- sentation and as such, are perfectly reversible, with the poem's pretense of having taken over the poetic scene little but a restful lull in the ordinary course. Properties are exchanged between the given, empirical entities of pipe and poet, one of which has an aperture comparable to the mouth of the other, and which can thus be ascribed thoughts and motives to represent as well as speech with which to represent them. Based as it is on ordinary experience, with its transpositions owed to the combination of that material, the vision seems the type of the natural dream (409) and like it, to mirror the 950</page><page sequence="11">MLN dreamer. Just as the illusion of the natural dream is destined to vanish with the day when light reveals what is, so the impression of a poet victim of his figure seems destined to end at the moment the poet lays down his pipe and the reader "La Pipe." In Les Paradis, Baudelaire paints a similar picture that introduces some complications and points to a new model for authority: I imagine you seated and smoking. Your attention rests for a little too long on the bluish clouds exhaled by your pipe. The idea of evaporation, slow, successive, eternal, grips your mind and you soon apply this idea to your own thoughts, to your thinking matter. By a singular misprision, by a manner of transposition or intellectual quid pro quo, you soon feel yourself evaporating, and you attribute to your pipe (in which you feel yourself bent over and tamped down like tobacco) the strange faculty of smoking you. (420, my translation) The explicit point of departure for the dream dreamt by "you" is once again an everyday occurrence. The hashish eater, seated smoking his pipe as in Baudelaire's portrait by Courbet, likens the evaporating smoke to the slow dissolution of his thought. Having "changed places" by metaphor with the tobacco, a complication ensues. He proceeds as if the exchange did not involve the names of things but the things themselves. He does not call his thoughts smoke, and himself tobacco. Instead, he is tobacco and his thoughts are its smoke. This is a mistake, an "equivoque," albeit a mistake that allows him to work out further implications of the likeness-for instance, the smoker has also undergone the fashioning that is given to tobacco before lighting ("bent over and tamped down"), and like it is in danger of being evaporated in entirety. From this mistake of taking the name for the thing, a certain critique of the assumptions about experience on which the empirically-based representation is predi- cated can be undertaken that will culminate in the rejection of the representational model and the dissolution of the empirical self. The first sign of this is that the characteristics of thought (it can be compact, but it can also evaporate) are extended to "you," to the subject tamped down and smoked by the pipe. That means that the subject is not after all the stable, seated entity having fixed properties that it first appears. Rather, like tobacco, it is revealed as a natural product, as becoming what it is through shaping and evaporating. The passage recognizes this production and dissolving of the subject in the creative act that frames the drug-induced vision: 'Je vous suppose assis et fumant," where we have to read supposer not in 951</page><page sequence="12">E. S. BURT the sense of picturing you as you have often been, but of inventing, sovereignly shadowing forth a seated and smoking addressee. In a discussion of Baudelaire's theory of the imagination in the Salon de 1859, Hans-Jost Frey helpfully notes a Baudelairian critique of naive imitation, defined as the representation of what is. Those who attempt to imitate what is do not know, Frey says, that what they are imitating is not "nature as it is but instead as a predetermined conventional usage" (65). He contrasts this to a reality that resides not in what is seen but in the poet's seeing of it. The Baudelairian artist aims to depict the relation of the perceiving subject to the object, to re-present the envisioning by which the subject produces its object, as Frey says, "without the predetermination of an original" (65). In the prose passage, what this means is that the tropological exchanges between the presumably given entities of smoker and tobacco of naive imitation give way to a model of mimesis as production in which neither of the beings transferred are what they are prior to their entering into relation to one another (69). In the passage from Les Paradis, the difference between these two models of the imagination is expressed in the prose passage by the difference between the "you" of the framed story, who is likened to tobacco by means of an imaginative act induced by the drug, and the I of the frame, whose active, productive imagination finds a figure in the transformation-producing mechanism of the pipe. The likeness of tobacco to "you" is based on an observable resemblance between the seated smoker and the tamped down tobacco, and leads to an awareness of both as givens to be operated upon. The relation of I to the pipe, however, is based on difference. Like it in having produced a transformation in the given, in having made "you" appear, the I is markedly different from the technical instrument that is the pipe. The pipe stands for the I, autonomous actor, by a figure like metonymy, where a contingent or accessory element like the scepter that stands for a king allows the substitution. In the poem a similar disjunction between interpretative systems is evident. The easiest way to get at it is through the ambiguous genitive of the first stanza. The pipe says: "Je suis la pipe d'un auteur," and the of can be construed as linking author to pipe in very different ways. The author may be the pipe's object. Just as we say "a pipe of tobacco," by which we mean that a pipe is the container or possessor of tobacco, so may we say "the pipe of an author" with an author the content possessed or contained by the pipe. Once again, the poet would be in the position of the natural product of tobacco, like it 952</page><page sequence="13">M LN intransitively smoking, with the pipe the artifice by means of which that likeness is explored. There is a rift between this system, which takes the empirical poet as a theme, and a system closer to Frey's view of the productive imagination. This system is visible in the pipe viewed as an object possessed by an author, standing in for him as agent or tool. It is also to be seen in the poem's performative dimension. We first glimpsed that performative side in the by- products accompanying the central project of restoration, and in the muting of the poet's voice. It is even more clearly behind the anomalous act of granting speech to a bit of smoking paraphernalia. The performative dimension of a prosopopeia, the giving part of giving voice and face, reveals the pipe's speech act to be ventrilo- quized, the verbal act of an autonomous imagination. What the poet means by giving voice is the productive imagination. Here it is not a matter of relaxing the poet in preparation for his return, but it is rather a matter of acknowledging a debt, returning to the poet the credit for his invention by way of the pipe as metaphor for the text. The insistent first person pronouns and the pipe's address over the head of its master to an implied "you" are signs of the deixis wherein a subject assumes the language and gestures to the other in the here and now of a speaking situation. The smoke with which the pipe wreathes its master, a modern take on the topos of a cloud-wrapped divinity, provides an apt figure for this situation, where an author's hidden presence has to be divined by virtue of the presence of an illusion."' In this reading, the restoration aimed at through the prosopopeia would be a restitution, a paying back, rather than a renewal of a past health. A more generalized authority accompanies the performative di- mension and with it comes a change in the position and importance of poetic language. Where the poet is not an imitator but a producer the polysemy noted by Reed ultimately enlarges the sphere of authority. For once a productive imagination enters the scene, the autonomy of the accessory has been limited, taken into account as the ruse of an author, and is even a necessary component. If what is, as Frey says, is the product of a relation and always requires an interpretation, the operation of proximity in reawakening dormant meaning brings that out. Instead of a misfire that seems a mistake, a side effect thrown off in the heedless rush to speech that threatens the author's supremacy, now the polyvalence of signs is a precious reserve to be tapped, and the mobilization of that polyvalence the occasion for an acknowledgment of a debt to the author for the 953</page><page sequence="14">E. S. BURT excess knowledge produced. The newly mobilized metaphors of mine (mine) and trickery (piperie) underscore the potential for relation to be determining, part of a process of meaning production. That they mean the riches and the duplicity of the imagination lies behind the authorial election of the pipe to represent the productivity of the imagination as it shapes form. By signifying his foreknowledge of language's excesses, the poet gives the poem license to do what it does in any case, and puts himself in the position to reap any speculative profits. As he conjures up an author figure that is rather the effect of the poem's interpretation than its cause, he does indeed free words from "predetermined conventional usage" (Frey, 65) and makes their meaning dependent on the structure in which they are taken. In short, the pipe makes the natural symbol that is tobacco evaporate together with the empirical self it symbolizes, to give way to a language theory that centers rather on the accessory, the signifier, and is preparatory to the recuperative return of the pipe's master ("pour le retour du laboureur"). Access to the author is by way of the pipe that can thus stand for the poem, as is shown by the fact that we have to look at the pipe to know anything about him: "On voit a contempler ma mine / Que mon maitre est un grand fumeur." It should be noted that the performative model is not ultimately contestatory here. That goes without saying in the case of conventional performatives. But even where it is inventive or inaugural, as it is here, the performative brings with it a notion of authority that is every bit as constraining and, in the last analysis, traditional enough. The self involved is not an empirical but a general self. It has overtones of the Augustinian self in Book Two of the Confessions, where the saint's motive for theft is not a desire for the natural object (a desire for knowledge) but rather for the act of transgression, of giving oneself one's own law, in a perverse imitation of Divine power and freedom, a desire related to productivity and performance. To love one's own perdition, to seek one's own destruction is, for Augustine, to parody God's act of creation. The poet who, through a prosopopeia, seeks not the recollection of a determinate past self, but rather the recognition from the other of his act of granting speech, is engaged in an act similar to that of Augustine. The sin is not concupiscence, but rather a form of satanic pride." A difficulty inhibits the promised recuperation, however: the speech act is not direct. The poet does not speak in his own name to say, Pipe, I grant you speech, but grants by subterfuge, by making 954</page><page sequence="15">M L N appear a puppet pipe to whom speech has been given. That has to be the case for there is a time lapse written into the performative. The poet only becomes competent to give the pipe speech by virtue of an invention retrospectively recognized as the act of a free imagination. Who could testify that the poet has granted the accessory speech? Not the speaker, the pipe. Not the poet whose authority is a result and not the cause of the successful performative. And yet, because it is the case, because the result of the act appears as it were out of thin air, disconnected from any cause, it also appears arbitrary and wilful, potentially as apt to be the result of the flexibility of the tool as an act of a responsible subject striving to show its freedom. Let's notice what happens to the poem if, following to the end the implication of the accessory's prominence, we take the lack of direct evidence for an author seriously and entertain doubts about a God conceived from evidence of some concealment going on. What would be the effect on the poem if we took the pipe to be speaking for a mechanical principle like grammar, with its sense-making abilities, rather than as a figure for the poet? What does the accessory say of the effect of the accessory? The first line of the poem can say something quite different than what we've said so far if its grammatical rather than its semantic value is foregrounded. Like the I in Rimbaud's "I is another," the I of "La Pipe" could be a grammatical subject, an I mentioned, and the line could be paraphrased: "'I' is the pipe of an author." That is as much as to state that the first person is the mechanism by means of which authority is actualized and volatilized, the self constituted and de- constituted as master trope. The text exposes a rule according to which, through the use of I, an authority that is neither legitimate nor illegitimate can be foisted off as legitimate. The importance of the line for a reading of Baudelairian autobiography is evident. We saw earlier that the poem, while not precisely autobiographical, was about prosopopeia, the figure for restoring the self, and thus about writing autobiography, so to speak an ars autobiographia. But now the poem is about the means for producing and undoing selves to be restored, about the failure of the self to be constituted, and thus about the impossibility of autobiography. I is not the indicator of an authority through which we can understand the poem and its figures; rather, it is through the pipe, the accessory, that we get a notion of the deictic as means by which the prestige of authority is made and undone. The poem goes even further in the third stanza. So far, we have assumed that the poet awards face to the pipe by an act of the 955</page><page sequence="16">E. S. BURT imagination, by metaphor, and that any excess meaning is retrospec- tively authored by the poet's decision to foreground the difference that language makes. But in fact, the fiery mouth of the pipe that justifies the prosopopeia is not metaphorical. The proper term for the aperture at the end of a tuyau is mouth. Language carries the figure in it, unrecognized as figure, in one of its names.12 The poet is thus not an imaginative genius but the translator of language's vision. He has simply remembered the pipe to be the talking head its mouth already makes it. Such recollections of the figurality of proper terms are a feature of drug narratives. In Gautier's "Le Club des hachischins," for instance, the arms of a chair open to embrace the hallucinating narrator and the feet of the furniture take to dancing. What has appeared so far as the dream of a human consciousness starts to have the features of a dream of hieroglyphic character, an absurd vision received from the language. The poem does not re-present the author engaged in the production of a poem, but can be said to issue indeed from the pipe's mouth. In Les Paradis artificiels, a certain reserve on the part of the narrator as to whether hieroglyphic dreams, which he says represent "the supernatural side of life" (408), are to be attributed to a divine origin, as some people do, is one indication that, for Baudelaire, there is a difference not to be neglected between the actual origin of a work and the one imputed to it by way of the topos of the productive imagination. We can have ideas of the supernatural that do not have an origin in God, but rather in the grammatical, sense-making side of language. In short, it is quite possible to read the poem as re-presenting an authorial figure even as it denies that it can be returned to that Divine author in the last analysis.13 The models we have considered for interpreting the poem leave something to be desired in both cases. The tropological model, with its empirical basis and its claim to provide knowledge trivializes the poem. It cannot account for effects of meaning that are apparent in its language and is moreover unable to account for the act that brought it into being. The performative model, while it does account for those effects and dignifies the poem as potentially a product of human freedom, feels wilful and arbitrary, for it does not provide any criterion to verify that it does indeed originate in a free act rather than in a mechanical principle. The difference between both models is as great as is the insufficiency of each. Certainly, in the prose passage from Les Paradis artificiels the difference between the drug-eating you and the imaginative I was 956</page><page sequence="17">MLN great enough to be spoken of as a rift, as is the difference between what the pipe says and its speaking in the poem. Yet in talking about restoration of the author, we are presumably positing a continuum between the two models for the poem, understanding the productive model as a later and more enlightened stage in a process that, in retrospect, is in evidence from the first. But can we really speak as if the two models could be laid out as a conversion narrative in this way? The poem certainly does not provide such a narrative, which not coincidentally is the typical narrative of autobiography. The connec- tion of its two models, if connection there be, will have to be by way of a third model foundational to both.'4 The question is: how great is this rift? Is it as abyssal as the poem promises in one of its signifiers ("Abyssinienne")? Can a bridge be built such that, for instance, the work as performative might be reconciled with the work as tropological, so as to obviate the charge of arbitrariness, or so that the frivolous occasional piece on smoking might account for the act that brought it into being? With a bridge, the general self of the performative might be brought into relation with the empirical self of the poem as trope, the acts of the one and the knowledge of the other might be harmonized. That, according to many accounts of autobiography, is the point of the genre. Even if the poem is not itself autobiographical, it might still provide the grounds for autobiography elsewhere in Baudelaire. To find a bridge, we need look no further than the residue left by the smoking of the tobacco. It is not the pipe but the black resin remaining on the pipe's bowl that is actually our means of access to its author: "On voit a contempler ma mine / D'Abyssinienne ou de Cafrine / Que mon maitre est un grand fumeur." We have circled back here to the beginning, to our main question of materiality's emergence. As concentrated resin, as residue-be it the writing representing the smoking of a pipe by a grand fumeur or left from the production of a discourse by a grand fumiste-material language can sustain both interpretations. It would even allow them potentially to be linked in a narrative: first the traces let us read the texts in terms of imitation, where the poet's absence is accidental, and then, in light of a recognition of a purposiveness to the disposition of signs, they lead to an interpretation of meaning as produced. Related by the material remainder, the two models can make up for one another's deficiencies. Thus, in a model where nature is everything and the poet constrained to its imitation and knowledge, the left-over resin reminds of an arena of freedom and of production. In a performative 957</page><page sequence="18">E. S. BURT model, the act divorced from nature finds a certain verifiability through the remainder of the smoking operation, and thus an exemption from the charge of arbitrariness. Through the material remainder we get news of an able autobiographical subject waiting in the wings whose action of smoking shows him capable of the appropriation of alterity (again, the subject: "reappropriation with surplus value, a certain capitalization" [Derrida 102]). The materiality of the text emerges where it is a question of stabilizing the performative, in the transition between the two models we have found at work in the text. But, if we are to believe the poem, the material aspect does not only operate to allow the articulation of the two models. While it grounds and stabilizes, it also disrupts, introducing its own effects on the system and substituting its own model. The third strophe provides a different view of the material remainder in the smoke, the "r6seau mobile et bleu" which the pipe claims as its mouth's product ("qui monte de ma bouche en feu.") At first sight this mobile network seems perfectly consonant with what we have just said about the remainder, as letting the poem be read according to the successive shapes given it. The network's power to embrace the poet suggests that the self does indeed owe its constitution to the poem's web. But this view of the remainder as smoke is in point of fact quite different from the resin, remainder of a transformational process which bears a trace of a past happening, for it is a future-oriented structure. It bears as yet undetermined shapes in it, and as such can stand for the potential for the structure to circulate without reference to any authority. Nor is this merely a vague prognostication in the present about the future. The future has already begun to affect the present of the poem itself, in the form of a self-division. The last stanza is the witness to be called here: "Et je roule un puissant dictame / Qui charme son coeur et gu6rit / De ses fatigues son esprit." The lines, as we have read things so far, aim at the reconciliation of tropological and performative dimensions, in what Ch6rix has identified as an "ivresse calme" (252), where the pipe's activity and the poet's atony are made harmonious partners. The pipe is promising that the poet's deliverance from fatigue and its causes is at hand. But it is quite within the reading possibilities of this poem to read "rouler" in its extended sense of "to meditate," "to turn and return in one's head," as in: "I roll over in my mind a powerful balm / That might charm his heart / And heal his spirit of its fatigues." In such a reading, the soothing poem would not yet have been written, and the poem we are reading would be rather 958</page><page sequence="19">MLN identified as a paradigm for the making of such poems than one of its number. The harmony between pipe and poet is put into question by a shape found in the leftover from their work of self-making and self- undoing. This shape is not the result of the harmonious action of empirical poet and tool. It spreads its effects unauthorized. A reading so divergent as to deny that the poem of which it speaks has yet been written cannot be recuperated by the systems of meaning discussed so far, both of which accept the being of the poem as in the present ("je suis"), its situation as that of an eternal verity. Instead, right on time-just like the hieroglyphic dream-at the moment when the poem promises the end of the song and the arrival of the poet figure, it provides-also like the hieroglyphic dream-an unexpected opening onto poetry as still to come. The point is not that we can read the already written remainder in a different way according to our desire and to the honor of the poet, as was the case with the paranomastic mine and piper. The point is that, as left-over, the remainder can organize itself into new combinations that do not allow us to return it to an author. The reading is owed to the potential of writing-the pipe is, after all, a sort of pen-to provide unantici- pated models through the operation of its letters. Writing, it seems, can animate, can dictate souls (dicte-ame), rather than being ani- mated, dictated by them.15 The letters of the poem can enter into combinations and propose readings disjunct from the reconciliation of pipe and author, unauthorized by the poem's signatory or the pipe that speaks for him. Here, materiality emerges to ruin the transition between the tropological model and the performative one and to increase the difference between them to an abyss. In short, the attempts to ground the authority of the pipe's master in "La Pipe" lead to the conclusion that the vision comes to us from a cause exterior to man, its absurd, hieroglyphic character evidence that the Baudelairian poet is rather a mouthpiece for a forging work of language that does not originate in man's imagination, or in a divine being, but in the prosaic materiality of the letter. Materiality works here as a name for resistance: what resists appropriation. The appropriation resisted is not simply that of experience, but also that of authority recuperated through the performative. The event is the event of a break with the autobiographical narrative that could legitimate the poem, and the emergence of a model for poems to come that will be dictated by something as otherworldly as the letters of dictame. In brief, Bonaventura's adventure, the adventure of memoirs broken off, unable ever to end, is quite like Baudelaire's, 959</page><page sequence="20">E. S. BURT whose memoirs, unable ever properly to be begun, endlessly circle around the place where they would begin if ever the subject could be fully grounded. Materiality comes onto the scene where the issue is the transition between the two models. It emerges in partial form as a polysemy recuperable by recourse to the more powerful authority of a general self vehicled by the performative. When it emerges fully, it is as a remainder that simultaneously provides evidence of an authority to an act, and ungrounds it by showing the act to which it refers as always to come. Poetic language is ultimately not mimetic or performative but inscriptional language; however the interest of that fact is only available if we let it emerge gradually from within the poem by the most careful reading we can manage of the mimetic and performative dimensions. What Warminski says of Kant can apply as well to Baudelaire: his discourse has recourse to the "prosaic materiality of the letter" to found itself, even as it is materiality that disarticulates and unfounds it ("Poets" 12). Baudelaire's modernity is to have understood the poet's function as that of the translator of linguistic dreams hieroglyphic in character. His poems have finally to be approached through an archaeology aimed at recovering in the most seductive and natural-looking of formations a materiality resistant even to the most general of subjects. That materiality stands revealed at its most disruptive where the subject's ruses for maintaining itself have been followed through to the end and it has come up against an alterity-resin, smoke, the letter-it cannot swallow.

(Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2000). 2 "La servante au grand coeur dont vous etiezjalouse..." and "Je n'ai pas oublie, voisine de la ville ...." 3 Baudelaire's "Une mort heroique" can be seen as making a similar allegorical point. 960</page><page sequence="21">MLN 4 It provided what Claude Pichois terms "un cul-de-lampe, resolution provisoire et humoristique des conflits evoques par les poemes precedents" (Baudelaire 963). 5 Perhaps Baudelaire's decision to place the poem before the "Spleen" section instead of as the transitional poem to the "Tableaux Parisiens," despite the presence of the apparatus of the pipe that links the poem with the bequilles, batons, jambes de statues, girouettes, etc. of the latter section, is based on his understanding of tobacco as a natural product, and, as such, not entirely at home in the artificial cityscapes from which the poet has excluded "le vegetal irregulier" (101). 6 Richard Klein, Cigarettes Are Sublime (Durham: Duke University Press, 1993). 7 Baudelaire may be borrowing from De Quincey. The English author sees his visions as divine and relates them to the hieroglyphics of memory. In a passage in the section called "The Pleasures of Opium," for instance, De Quincey states the difference between wine and opium in terms that suggest Baudelaire's distinction between natural and supernatural dreams: "In short, to sum up all in one word, a man who is inebriated, or tending to inebriation, is, and feels that he is, in a condition which calls up into supremacy the merely human, too often the brutal, part of his nature: but the opium-eater (I speak of him who is not suffering from any disease, or other remote effects of opium) feels that the diviner part of his nature is paramount; that is, the moral affections are in a state of cloudless serenity; and over all is the great light of the majestic intellect. This is the doctrine of the true church on the subject of opium, of which church I acknowledge myself to be the only member" (Confessions, 75). 8 It is worth noting that the passage is at odds with one of the more influential of recent readings of the configuration of the Baudelairian corpus, BarbaraJohnson's important Defigurations du langage poetique. Johnson's work is nuanced enough to require a more sustained reading than can be given it in a note. But in one of its tendencies, it explains the work as the fruit of two periods: the period of Les Fleurs du mal, characterized by a belief in the aesthetic dignity of the lyric and figurative language, was followed by the period of the Petits poemes en prose, the demystified production of a poet who had become disenchanted with the seductions of the lyric and interested by the disfiguration of figural language. This narrative of progressive demystification can be questioned in the light of the issues raised by materiality in a text like Les Paradis artificiels. Les Paradis is not governed by an opposition capable of engendering a narrative. Instead, Baudelaire posits two main kinds of imaginative productions that differ according to their origin, and whose relation is not to be construed in terms of a narrative governed by the poles of truth and falsehood. 9 1 am the pipe of an author; You can see, by contemplating my face Of an Abyssinian or a Kaffir, That my master is a great smoker. When he is overcome by sorrow, I smoke like the thatched cottage Where food is prepared For the laborer's return. I entwine and rock his soul In the mobile, blue network That rises from my fiery mouth, And I roll a powerftll balm That charms his heart and heals His spirit of its fatigues. (My translation) 961</page><page sequence="22">E. S. BURT 10 There are a number of examples of the topos in Baudelaire. One thinks of the divinity a child espies seated on a pink cloud in "Les Vocations," of the swirling clothing around an unmoving figure in "Avec ses vetements ...," or, in a different vein, of "Le Masque," where a face "tout encadre de gaze" hides another and "veritable face." 11 Note that Book Two contains the celebrated pun on pears (pirum) and perishing (perire) where a turning away of language from its accepted conventional use occurs that is similar to those we find in "La Pipe" (Augustine, 29). For an informed discussion of the Devil in Baudelaire, the reader is referred toJonathan Culler's "Baudelaire's 'Satanic Verses' in Les Fleurs du mal." 12 It is of course a catachresis. 13 The passage from Les Paradis artificiels cited earlier repeats this difference. There Baudelaire calls hieroglyphic dreams supernatural, but distances himself from the assumption of some that their source is divine. 14 The prose passage from Les Paradis does not appear to promise a narrative resolution either. It may be that Baudelaire is actually speaking of his own experience when he attributes the dream of becoming tobacco to the second person, but the choice to speak of "you" snaps the connection between narrated and narrating I, and thus makes a conversion narrative impossible. 15 The literal is important in the discussion of the soul in Baudelaire. In a poem like "Au Lecteur," ostensibly about the effect of evil (le mat) in depriving the soul of its animating power, it is hard not to read the overwhelming literal presence of animality in a passage about something else: "Serre (cerf), fourmillant (fourmis), comme un million (lion) d'helminthes (helminthes), / Dans nos cerveaux (cerf/ veaux) ribote un peuple de Demons, / Et, quand nous respirons, la Mort dans nos poumons (poux) / Descend, fleuve (louve) invisible, avec de sourdes (ours) plaintes." In confirmation, a whole strophe further on is explicitly devoted to a menagerie of animals ("Les chacals, les pantheres, les lices, / Les singes, les scorpions, les vautours, les serpents .. ."). It is as though the moralist's discussion of the soul's inability to stir itself to action had actually originated in a literal language animating in its stead, in an instance of the ill attacking the soul (anima- mal) that is being talking about. "Au lecteur" reads as a rebus of "Animal." In "Une Charogne," the point is even more explicit: there, the action of the sun on the cadaver animates things from the outside in, not only in the impression of life and breath given it by the movement of the waves of maggots, but also, for instance, through the rhyming word describing the carrion, "infame," which provides a plausible source for the "femme lubrique" to which the carcass is compared.
