<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURRENT RESEARCH EDITED BY MARY ELIZABETH KING SOUTHWEST GREAT BASIN. D. A. Graybill, using the 7500-year bristlecone-pine chronology developed by C. W. Ferguson, succeeded in dating, for the first time in this area, several tree-ring specimens from Crooked Creek Cave, a prehistoric rockshelter high in the White Mountains of California. UTAH. University of Utah survey parties directed by Gary F. Fry and H. G. Whylie recorded over 300 sites in extreme northwest Utah and southeast Nevada. Sites range in elevation from 4,200 ft. to over 10,000 ft. and are located in a variety of habitats. Concurrently, Gardiner F. Dalley conducted exca- vations at seven rockshelters in the Goose Creek and Grouse Creek Mountains, northwest Utah, selected for prehistoric use of high-elevation environments that might complement the data from nearby low-elevation Hogup Cave. One of the shelters is a stratified, large overhang situated at about 5,900 ft. The upper one to two feet of stratified deposits are dry and contain abundant Fremont materials. These overlie strata con- taining a sequence of known Desert Archaic pro- jectile-point types. Below a massive spall layer is a seven-foot deposit that yielded charcoal and food- bone scrap but no diagnostic artifacts. Indications are that the site was used primarily as a hunting camp. Jesse D. Jennings and John P. Marwitt conducted excavations at the Evans Mound site, near Summit. Four pit houses, five adobe storage structures, several burials and numerous artifacts have been assigned, on the basis of preliminary analysis, to the Paragonah phase of Parowan Fremont, a distinctive regional ex- pression of Fremont culture in southwest Utah. Evans Mound is the largest-known Fremont village remaining in Utah, and plans are underway to develop it as a state park. Ray T. Matheny directed Brigham Young Univer- sity's second annual field school in Montezuma Can- yon. Excavation at Monument Village brought into focus domestic activities associated with a Pueblo I pit house. Above-ground granaries with roof hatches di rectly connected with food processing structures are found paired on the north, west, and southwest sides of the pit house. All pairs of structures are oriented so that they connect to the house on radial lines. It appears that the pit house was a central domicile for several families, especially during the winter, and the paired granaries, food preparation areas, and other small structures served individual families during warmer months. Excavation of Pueblo I-III mound continues. Oc- cupation fill is 22 ft. deep at the mound, revealing Pueblo II and III masonry structures superimposed over older constructions. A previously unknown Basketmaker III site has been found. It includes cir- cular structures built with vertical slabs along the walls and stone-paved floors. Locations of Basketmaker sites are on the second and third terraces of Montezuma Creek buried under colluvium from older terraces above. William D. Lipe (SUNY at Binghamton) completed a second field season of survey and excavation focused on the Basketmaker II occupation of part of Cedar Mesa, near Grand Gulch. The Basketmaker II settle- ment pattern on the mesa top contrasts with the Basketmaker III through Pueblo III patterns. The later sites tend to be associated with deeper soils in head- water regions of Grand Gulch tributaries; Basketmaker II sites are more abundant in eroded areas near the canyon rim. The Basketmaker II people appear to have been seasonally exploiting both Grand Gulch and the adjacent mesa top, and the pit houses may reflect winter use of the mesa. COLORADO. The University of Colorado Mesa Verde Research Center conducted four projects in 1970. Salvage excavations were carried out on Wetherill Mesa along the proposed mini-train route and in the area of the proposed parking lot. Primarily, Basketmaker III materials were encountered, including four habitation structures and associated storage units. The dwellings exhibit considerable variation, the single unifying feature being that they all had burned. His- toric materials were recovered from the site of Nor- denskiold's third 1891 camp, to be destroyed by parking-lot construction. In cooperation with the U.S. Forest Service, inves- tigations were initiated at Chimney Rock Archaeo- logical Area. At Chimney Rock Pueblo, partially ex- cavated by Jeancon in 1921-22, a portion of the east great kiva and one habitation room were cleared. Stabilization has begun in this Pueblo II Chaco ruin of about 35 rooms and two known kivas. Salvage and problem excavations at two mounds at Chimney Rock Mesa were also undertaken. These sites are architec- turally different from the Chimney Rock Pueblo but appear to be contemporary. Survey in the Chimney Rock Archaeological Area recorded 65 sites, which include a concentration of large Pueblo II sites lying just east of the Piedra River. Ninety-two archaeological localities were recorded on the Southern Ute Reservation during the second year of an inventory sponsored by the Southern Ute Tribe and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Pueblo I sites are most numerous. Bureau of Land Management holdings north and east of Mesa Verde National Park were checked during the sixth season of archaeological survey sponsored by that agency. ARIZONA. On September 25, 1970, at the Mu- seum of Northern Arizona, the Colorado Plateau Environmental Advisory Council was formed. Repre- sentatives from 12 academic institutions, 11 busi- nesses, 8 conservation groups, 10 federal agencies, and 12 state agencies from Arizona, Utah, and New Mex- ico attended. The Council has begun a monthly news- letter reporting on activities of various institutions and 233</page><page sequence="2">234 their research. An office and library maintained in the Museum will supply basic information regarding en- vironmental studies in the area of the Colorado Pla- teau to all interested parties. During summer 1970, Douglas W. Schwartz (School of American Research) conducted a fourth and final season of research in the Grand Canyon, the second season spent excavating and surveying Walhalla Glades Peninsula. Four sites, completely excavated, represent the range of habitation of the rim from pre- A.D. 900 to ca. A.D. 1200: a pre-Pueblo lithic site near a large sinkhole; a one-roomed Pueblo I site; a two-roomed Pueblo II structure; and a multi-roomed Pueblo III settlement on Sky Island, a small rock pillar connected to the rim by a narrow saddle. Two surveys were undertaken-one of the main wash that leads from the North Rim to Unkar Delta and its tributaries, and another of Wotan's Throne. Ecological investigations included the agricultural potential and the upper elevational limits of Pueblo settlement in the area, a refined definition of the gross vegetation cover of the Walhalla Glades, a description of the vegetation cover of Sky Island and Wotan's Throne, and intensive transept surveys and description in a variety of areas on the peninsula. Experimental gardens again were grown under controlled condi- tions in a variety of micro-environments. Laboratory analysis indicates that the first seden- tary Pueblo settlement of the Glades (ca. A.D. 900) was confined to a few one-roomed sites near the canyon edge. The population increased dramatically until ca. A.D. 1050-1100, when there were a large number of two- and three-room sites evenly distrib- uted over the entire area. By A.D. 1175-1200, after which the area was abandoned, the population had decreased, and the settlement pattern was charac- terized by larger sites farther apart but still distributed over the entire peninsula. The North Rim contrasts with inner-canyon set- tlement, which was most aggregated during Pueblo II and most dispersed during the later Pueblo III period. North Rim data are now being analyzed in view of the changes in subsistence pattern and social organization between A.D. 1050 and A.D. 1175 indicated by data from Unkar Delta. In September, 1970, Prescott College archae- ologists, in association with archaeologists and biolo- gists from the University of Arizona and the Museum of Northern Arizona, carried out additional excava- tions in the late Pleistocene site of Stanton's Cave in Grand Canyon. The excavation was undertaken to recover biological materials for a paleoclimatological analysis. The stratigraphy reveals split-twig figurines in the upper 5 cm. (ca. 3,000 to 4,000 years ago), extinct goat and sheep remains at about 25 cm. (ca. 12,000 years ago), and driftwood from 50 to 100 cm. (more than 38,000 years ago). J. S. Dean and W. J. Robinson (Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research) and A. J. Lindsay (Museum of Northern Arizona) continued a survey of Long House Valley near Kayenta on the Navajo Reservation. Near- ly 100 sites of prehistoric, Hopi, Navajo, and Anglo origin were cataloged. Prehistoric sites range in time from a preceramic horizon to about A.D. 1300, with a [Vol. 36, No. 2, 1971 heavy concentration in the twelfth and early thir- teenth centuries. Sporadic Hopi utilization of the area before its permanent occupation by Navajos is also indicated. Prescott College again held a Peabody Coal Com- pany sponsored field school on Black Mesa directed by R. C. Euler and G. J. Gumerman. Excavation was concentrated on early sites such as a Basketmaker III house, a Pueblo I and an early Pueblo II village-all Kayenta sites. Don Morris (National Park Service) stabilized and started excavation of Antelope House, Canyon de Chelly National Monument during summer 1970. Por- tions of three rooms and a section of stratified trash were excavated. The Museum of Northern Arizona excavated at a Pai or Cohonino site near Cameron, an Elden phase pueblo and pit house village near Winona, and an historic Pai campsite at the Orme Ranch School. Over 100 sites were recorded in connection with archae- ological clearance reconnaissances requested by vari- ous governmental and private agencies in northern Arizona. The Field Museum continued work on the Joint site, a 32-room pueblo, where four sampling designs on one universe were used to find out if comparable information would result, although each sampling de- sign was generated to solve different problems. Fred Plog developed and tested, for the agricultural transition period, a model of growth based upon Mil- ler's systems theory and concepts of economic growth and industrialization. Four dimensions were used: population, differentiation, integration, and tech- nology. A critical change that took place in the transi- tion from gathering to farming was in technology and differentiation, not in population or integrative mechanisms. Plog also found and investigated several irrigation canals. Ezra Zubrow developed a model concerned with carrying capacity as a dynamic equilibrium system and its implications for prehistoric demographic and set- tlement patterns. Further detailed research, with Richard Hevly's cooperation, demonstrated that it is possible to determine the approximate carrying capa- city of each microhabitat and to examine the extent to which man made use of his biotic potential. Michael Schiffer initiated studies to interrelate fieldwork with contemporary culture through the space dimension. Indications are that as use of a storage facility increases, so will the size and diversity of the contents of that facility. Thomas Cook undertook to explain the variation in distribution and absolute size of populations not explained by the relationship of nearness of water to settlement patterns. He found that clusters of Bas- ketmaker sites could be explained in terms of socio- cultural variables measurable by means of ceramic stylistic attributes. G. J. Gumerman (Prescott College), sponsored by the United States Geological Survey, tested remote- sensing techniques such as false-color infrared pho- tography and infrared-scanning imagery in the Snake- town region. The utilization of various remote-sensing american antiquity</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT RESEARCH systems in a semi-arid environment appears to have great potential for archaeological survey. A related project, also sponsored by the U.S.G.S., is an areal survey of so-called fortified hilltop sites along the Mogollon Rim. Sites are located from the air, and as much data as possible are collected by remote-sensing techniques. Survey teams are then taken to the sites by helicopter to check the data and make collections. The Laboratory of Tree Ring Research has finished its massive review of collections of Southwestern archaeological tree-ring specimens now in its posses- sion. The past year saw the studies of material from the upper Rio Grande and Chaco Canyon, New Mex- ico, and Mesa Verde and Durango, southwestern Colorado, completed. During eight years of work, more than 12,000 dates were derived from the analysis of nearly 100,000 individual tree-ring specimens from 750 sites. Publication of project results continued with the appearance of six reports listing dates from northern and central Arizona, southern Utah, and western and central New Mexico. The National Park Service sponsored Southwest Paleoclimate Project, designed to apply the techniques of dendroclimatic analysis to sub-regional archaeo- logical tree-ring chronologies, is in its third year. Re- sults of this project include: (1) production of maps showing positive and negative growth departures at 23 chronology stations in the Southwest from A.D. 680 to A.D. 1700; (2) principle component analysis of the 23-station network chronologies to isolate patterns of covariation in tree-growth response along these sta- tions; (3) intensive study of differential growth re- sponse of different species of trees to local climatic factors as a basis for inferring seasonal aspects of prehistoric climatic conditions; and (4) investigation of the relationship between tree growth and crop yield at experimental dry farms once maintained in parts of the Southwest by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. E. B. Sayles (Arizona State Museum) continued work on a series of children's books, several other writing projects. and preparation of personal records for the Arizona State Museum archives. Country road construction just east of the type site of the Cochise Culture at Double Adobe permitted Arizona State Museum archaeologists another oppor- tunity for excavation in this important area. Ric Windmiller excavated a large Chiricahua phase camp- site approximately 0.3 mi. downstream from the type site. Extensive surface debris indicates a long and probably seasonal occupation in an area of stabilized sand dunes. Excavations have exposed use areas con- taining numerous hearths and food-preparation areas besides many artifacts. Testing on the floodplain of Whitewater Draw has provided excellent profiles of the alluvial geology with which Cochise culture is closely tied. Bones of extinct mammoth and bison have also been recovered. NEW MEXICO. During summer 1970, James J. Hester (University of Colorado) made an ecologically oriented survey in the Upper Dry Cimarron Valley where the Folsom type station is located. Initial re- search was calculated to provide clues to man's be- havior and specific utilization of the valley, although the main concern was to determine the types of data available for reconstruction of cultural history and paleoenvironment. The survey produced 41 sites ranging in time from paleo-Indian through Archaic, Early Historic, to Historic. Sites were tentatively categorized by presumed function into knapping, kill, habitation, food processing, and "other" types of sites. Seventeen ecological stations were recorded consisting of locations where faunal material and macroplant remains were discovered in the walls of deeply cut arroyos. In addition, a re-examination of the Folsom site was begun. Recently recovered records, a map, and photographs from the original 1926-28 excavations provide a base for further work. Soil samples collected during the spring have been analyzed and pollen sam- ples are being studied by James Schoenwetter (Ari- zona State University). C. Vance Haynes initiated geomorphological studies for the entire valley. C. Irwin-Williams (Eastern New Mexico University) began investigations on the Rio Puerco between the Puerco Dam and Guadalupe, a continuation of the previous program on Anasazi origins which focused on human adaptation in the area between 6000 B.C. and A.D. 700. Attention centered on obtaining prelimi nary data on evolving human ecology from A.D. 700-1300, the systemic structure of various sizes of social units and comparisons of the data. Vorsilla Bohrer conducted studies of regional botany. Three basic socio-demographic patterns are suggested for the region: ca. A.D. 700-850, relatively large pit-house villages on tributaries to principal drainages; ca. A.D. 850-1100, three concentrations of small (5 to 20-room) front-oriented units, each clustered around a larger (ca. 60-room) settlement; A.D. 1100-1300, aggregation of most of the population in a few larger multiple-building units with continuation of small subordinate units and development of separate farm houses ca. A.D. 1300. About A.D. 1300, there is evidence of a change in rate of local deposition and abandonment of the Rio Puerco region with possible relocation east into the Jemez drainage. C. Irwin-Williams began mapping and testing the Salomon Ruin near Bloomfield in cooperation with the San Juan County Museum Association. The site is a classic representative of Chacoan occupation of the area and comprises a single, large C-shaped structure, about 500 ft. by 200 ft. with masonry of the Chaco- banded style of A.D. 1060 to ca. A.D. 1090. It is believed to be three stories high and to include a great kiva about 50 ft. in diameter. As at nearby Aztec Ruin, the Salomon data suggest a secondary occupa- tion by groups closely affiliated with Mesa Verde. C. Irwin-Williams and M. Wimberley continued research in the Tularosa Valley near Alamogordo, focused on early agricultural development in the area. The Fresnel Canyon shelter continued to produce evidence of use of two kinds of maize, beans, and squash, as well as quantities of wild foods by inhabi- tants of the region by 1500 B.C. Alden Hayes (National Park Service) completed work at Pecos Mission in September, 1970, with the testing of outlying structures believed to be the secular "Casas Reales" which perhaps represented the first settlement of the modern town of Pecos in the eighteenth century. In the convento itself, a subter- ranean kiva was excavated. The inference is that the kiva was built, as an act of spite, with material sal- vaged from structures destroyed in the Pueblo Revolt 235</page><page sequence="4">236 of 1680. It was razed and obliterated by Franciscans after their return with De Vargas in 1682. The University of New Mexico continued excava- tions at Rio Rancho, west of Albuquerque, with fur- ther investigations at the classic Folsom site. A Desert Culture structure of undetermined age was outlined. Rio Rancho also produced a human mandible and two skull fragments from the Pleistocene level. Excavations were begun at a paleo-Indian site near Tome, south of Albuquerque. This site, covering approximately ten acres around Comanche Springs, includes Sandia, Clovis, Folsom, and two other un- known later types. Bone accompaniments identified with the site are mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Over 6 m. of Desert Culture material are stratified above the paleo-Indian, and above this a Basketmaker site occurs. A small pueblo (Pueblo III-IV) is nearby. In 1970, Christy G. Turner (Arizona State Univer- sity) directed further studies on the Gran Quivira human-skeletal series. Classic fluoride tests proved insensitive for differentiating between skeletons. A pilot X-ray study showed skeletons to have signifi- cantly fewer growth-disturbance lines than prehistoric California Indians. S. Genoves' stature-reconstruction formulae were found to be applicable. The mandibular torus occurred more frequently among Eastern Puebloans than in those of the West, and it can be as large as in Eskimos. Canyon de Chelly Pueblo II (?) human remains exhibit features more like those of Hopi than Zuni or Navajo. George Agogino (Eastern New Mexico University) with Susan Riches (University of Wisconsin) investi- gated a preceramic site in the Guadalupe Mountains. Excavation continued at "Honest Injin" Cave. Agogino also ran a field school at Agogino Cave near Fort Stanton. In July, 1970, the El Paso Archaeological Society excavated a trash pit and one room of a Jornada- Branch Mogollon, Capitan phase (A.D. 900-1000), vil- lage near Tularosa. TEXAS. In June, the El Paso Archaeological So- ciety surveyed Interstate 10 from the Texas-New Mexico state line to the city limits of El Paso with negative results. The El Paso Centennial Museum completed, during summer 1970, a salvage project on White Sands Missile Range, consisting of further exploration of the Con- dron Air Field site first investigated by Larry Ham- mack several years ago. The only new features re- sulting from this work were post holes which probably supported a ramada between two rows of buildings previously excavated, and a possible pit house or barrow pit in the same area. Other projects were an aerial study of fortification and communications sys- tems in the Casas Grandes area by Rex E. Gerald, and the recording, by Herbert C. Morrow, Jr., of an old Tigua house in Ysleta, Texas, that is being restored by the Tigua Indian Commission. Morrow has also been investigating some early dwellings and business locali- ties in downtown El Paso, in an area that is being cleared for a new community center. Gerald spent part of the summer compiling historic and ethnographic data for the Tigua land-claims case. ALEXANDER J. LINDSAY, JR. [Vol. 36, No. 2, 1971 MESOAMERICA MEXICO. On July 17, 1970, the United States and Mexico signed a two-year treaty of cooperation which provides for the recovery and return of historical, cultural, and archaeological treasures, including Pre- columbian artifacts, Colonial objects, and pre-1920 historical documents, illegally exported from one country to the other. The treaty also encourages seri- ous archaeological studies and provides for the circu- lation of archaeological and historical exhibitions from both countries. It is not retroactive. GUATEMALA. During October and November 1969, Alan Bryan (University of Alberta) surveyed an area within a 20-mile radius of Chichicastenango, Quich6, to locate preceramic sites. Two sites, south and west of Chichicastenango in the Department of Totonicapan, yielded distinctive, fine-grained andesite flakes. One of the two, Los Tapiales, had only historic glazed ware in the upper levels; the second site also produced middle Preclassic sherds. A combined char- coal sample from 25 cm. to 1 m. below the surface at Los Tapiales yielded a radiocarbon age of 9500+150 years: 7550 B.C. (GaK-2769), the oldest radiocarbon date yet known from Guatemala. Further work is planned at both sites. Locations and descriptions of ceramic sites dis- covered during the survey were passed on to Edwin Shook; artifacts were deposited in the Museo Nacional de Antropologia e Historfa. The most abundant type of site recorded in the rural areas was the ceremonial shrine, many of which are still in use. The most significant late site surveyed was "Chichicastenango Antiguo," a hilltop fortress about 5 km. from the present town center. Many stone burial mounds were enclosed in the walled portion of the site; occupa- tional evidence was scarce inside the walls but abun- dant in the milpas outside. THE CARIBBEAN ST. VINCENT and THE GRENADINES. During April and May, 1970, Ripley P. and Adelaide K. Bul- len (Florida State Museum, University of Florida) completed archaeological surveys of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Radiocarbon ages from this work ex- tend from 1790+100 years: A.D. 160 (RL-28) to 940+100 years: A.D. 1010 for the various modified Saladoid ceramic periods and from 720+100 years: A.D. 1230 (RL-27) to 550?110 years: A.D. 1400 (RL-76) for the Suazey complex which Bullen pre- sumes was left by Carib Indians. Publication of this research is scheduled in the William L. Bryant Foun- dation American Studies series in 1971. BARBADOS. Plans are presently being made at the University of Florida to conduct salvage excavations at the Chancery Lane site on Barbados. This site, tested by Bullen in 1966, is one of the few markedly strati fied sites in the Antilles. The 1966 work produced excellent stratigraphic data with Suazey complex pottery in a clearly defined zone overlying pottery of Chancery Lane and Pearls period, the latter being found in a geologically different zone. As with many sites of aboriginal occupation, Chancery Lane will be ameRican antiquity</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT RESEARCH bulldozed out of existence to make way for a new hotel. ST. LUCIA. After finishing their Grenadines sur- vey, the Bullens visited St. Lucia where they surveyed and tested sites on the Troumassee estate. They later visited various research institutions in Caracas, Venezuela, and Bogota, Columbia, where he examined pottery and she studied skeletal material having pos- sible pertinence to the movement of people into the Lesser Antilles from South America. The fourth International Congress for the Study of the Pre-Columbian Cultures of the Lesser Antilles is scheduled to be held in July, 1971, on St. Lucia. Proceedings of the third Congress, held on Grenada in 1969, have recently been published. MARTINIQUE. The University of Montreal is developing a program of social anthropological and archaeological research on Martinique. Louis M. Allaire, of that University, is presently studying under Irving Rouse (Yale University) and plans to write his dissertation on Martinique archaeology. ANTIGUA. Fred Olsen, Guilford, Connecticut, and Mill Reef, Antigua, has found a preceramic site on Antigua, one of the few such sites in the West Indies and probably the first to be found in the Lesser Antilles north of Trinidad. There are no immediate plans for excavation, but Irving Rouse (Yale) has indicated an interest in digging there when he is free from present writing obligations. PUERTO RICO and MONA. On November 19, 1970, a site museum was dedicated at the remarkable ball court complex at Utuado, Puerto Rico. Restor- ation of El Parque de los Indios has been accomplished through the efforts of Ricardo Alegria (Director, Instituto de Cultura Puertorriquena, San Juan de Puerto Rico) and his able assistant, Walter Murray Chiesa. In December, 1969, a cave-exploring group visited the island of Mona, located between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. The party explored 14 caves and in one, which they named the Sungod Cave, located near Uvero Desembarcadero, they found petroglyphs covering a 100 ft. by 40 ft. wall. They report (National Speological Society News, August, 1970) also finding a "sun god disc, turtle, and stick- men." No further details are yet available. JAMAICA. Ronald Vanderwal left Jamaica early in 1969 and is now working for an advanced degree at the Australian National University. He is in the field at Papua, New Guinea. James St. Clair (University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee) replaced Vanderwal as ar- chaeologist for the Institute of Jamaica for one year. During this time, he excavated an extensive cave burial site found within a few meters of the huge White Marl site on the south coast of Jamaica. Results of this work were discussed in some detail in the March, 1970, Jamaica Journal. BAHAMAS. The Florida State Museum has just published the results of recent research on San Sal- vador and Cat Island in the Bahamas in their Contri- butions to the Social Sciences series. CHARLES A. HOFFMAN, JR. CENTRAL AMERICA HONDURAS-EL SALVADOR. With the com- pletion of Claude F. Baudez's and Pierre Becquelin's Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique project in the Lake Yojoa region of western Honduras, field- work in the southern Mesoamerican frontier has shifted to western El Salvador, particularly to the Chalchuapa site-zone, located some 15 km. from the Guatemalan border in a geographically transitional zone between the Maya Highlands and the Pacific Coast. The areal extension for the site is nearly six square kilometers. Numerous mound groups-among them Tazumal, El Trapiche, Casa Blanca, and Las Victorias-form part of a complex that also includes massive plazas, low platforms, terraces and extensive occupational zones. The current project (1969-70) is a joint endeavor by the University of Pennsylvania Mu- seum, with William R. Coe as director-general, and Pitzer College, with Robert J. Sharer as field director. Graduate students have been participating under the Ford Foundation traineeship program administered through the University Museum. The results of the first season's work (1969) have already been reported (AMER. ANT. 34:517, 1970). During the final season (January-November, 1970), the project also excavated on the southern shore of Laguna Cuzcachapa in de- posits belonging to the Classic and Postclassic periods. In addition, a late Preclassic and Postclassic occupa- tional zone of Laguna Seca, a half-kilometer southeast of Laguna Cuzcachapa was excavated, as well as Classic period burials and occupational deposits north of the Tazumal Mound group. As a result of the Chalchuapa project, the Pre- classic sequence (ca. 1200 B.C. to A.D. 200) for western El Salvador has been verified and amplified. The stratified ceramic evidence from LC-2-3 gathered in 1969 was particularly useful. A preliminary con- tinuation of the sequence into the Classic and Post- classic periods was also suggested in 1969 and strengthened by 1970 fieldwork. By October, 1970, a total of 73,063 sherds had been classified by Sharer according to the type-variety system, and an arti- factual as well as a figurine analysis is underway. In the area of Bolinas, within the Chalchuapa site- zone approximately 4 km. southwest of Tazumal, an important figurine complex has been found by Stanley H. Boggs (Universidad Nacional de San Salvador). A descriptive and chronological study of these figurines is in progress. Most of the figurines are of the usual solid hand-modeled type of Providencia times (late Preclassic of Kaminaljuyu), but there are a few larger ones with hollow torsos which may indicate time differences although all figurines were found in one level and associated sherds have proved uninfor- mative. Boggs has also been considering short reconnais- sance excavations near Apaneca and Las Chinamas in the Department of Ahuachapan directly southwest of Chalchuapa. At Finca Santa Leticia in the Apaneca area he investigated the relationship between "pot- bellied sculptures" and a series of five man-made ter- races, the top one of which has modest mounds. Ceramic material from a test pit at the base of one 237</page><page sequence="6">238 statue is considered to be no older than middle Pre- classic and probably late Preclassic in age. Boggs' other activities in El Salvador included a short reconnaissance of Hda. El Rosario in the De- partment of Chalatenango east of the Chalchuapa area, cataloging and photographing the Tesak collections of artifacts from eastern El Salvador, and making sketch plans of important sites including Cara Sucia in southwestern El Salvador. He has also served as con- sultant to the National Museum of El Salvador and the Inst. Salvadorefio de Turismo in the formulation of a project that will restore and develop national prehispanic monuments. NICARAGUA-COSTA RICA. Wolfgang Haberland (Museum of Ethnology, Hamburg) received radio- carbon ages for several of his excavations on Ometepe Island, Lago Nicaragua. From the cemetery of Los Angeles are two radiocarbon ages for the Gato phase (transitional early to middle Polychrome period): 980?60 years: A.D. 970 (Hv-2668) and 1490?75: A.D. 460 (Hv-2689). Of these, Haberland considers only the first date reliable. From La Palma, a habita- tion site, there are two results: 1275?50 years: A.D. 675 (Hv-2690) and 1290+50 years: A.D. 660 (Hv-2691), for the middle Polychrome period. Finally there is a sample from San Lazaro, also a habitation site, which should date the latest part of the middle Polychrome period before Luna Polychrome appears in the stratigraphic cut: 1445?30 years: A.D. 505 (Hv-2692). It should be noted that Haberland's dates are about 100 years later than Baudez's for the same period in the adjacent Tempisque area. In the Greater Nicoya area of Costa Rica, Fred Lange (University of Wisconsin) is working in the Rio Sapoa area of Guanacaste Province under the auspices of the Associated Colleges of the Midwest and the Organization for Tropical Studies, Inc. His team has concentrated its efforts in the San Dimas area and at Finca Las Marfas in the Bay of Salinas. Test excava- tions at San Dimas revealed an early Polychrome (A.D. 500-800) component previously unknown. Extensive tests in other localities showed also that the valley had been broadly occupied during the Zoned Bichrome period (300 B.C. - A.D. 300). Added information about this period was provided by excavation of a badly looted cemetery on a ridge overlooking the Bay of Salinas. At Finca Las Marias excavations of a large shell midden at the edge of a mangrove swamp yielded early Polychrome materials, with a significant increase in the occupation during late Polychrome times (A.D. 1200-1500). Late Polychrome materials are absent from the adjacent river valley. Analysis of shellfish from Las Salinas showed that cyclical changes in the frequency of shellfish species from different ecological niches could be best explained by seasonal patterns of collection. During the dry season the inter-tidal sandy beaches and sand flats were exploited for large mol- lusks. When higher water levels in the bay flooded the inter-tidal flats during the rains, small gastropods and oysters were gathered in the rocky headlands. Exploi- tation of the estuary system was never very intense. It is possible that during the late occupation of this site the pattern of shellfish collecting was intensified beyond the carrying capacity of the bay. Cursory field examination of the faunal material shows small fish [Vol. 36, No. 2, 1971 and reptiles (iguana and snake) to have been impor- tant. A few small mammals were represented, but large ones, such as deer and monkey, were scarce. Of in- terest was the possible use of acorns (Quercus oleoides) suggested by the presence of mortars and pestles at Las Marias and two sites in the San Dimas Valley. A third and final season in the Rio Sapoa area is envisioned by Lange in 1971. He plans to investigate further the pattern of acorn exploitation and the pos- sibility that salt extraction from the surrounding salt flats was of importance during the occupation of coastal sites. Now that excavations at Sitio Guayabo de Tur- rialba have been largely completed, Carlos H. Aguilar (Universidad de Costa Rica) has been active in several new projects. First is a survey of the Landecho Valley, southwest of San Jos6 in the lower tributaries of Rio Grande de Tarcoles, in search of paleo-Indian sites. This area has yielded large mammal remains and in- teresting lithic assemblages. In association with colleagues and students from the university, Aguilar has also done salvage archae- ology in recently urbanized areas of San Jose and Cartago. In the new development of Rohrmoser de las Pavas in San Jos6, a large cemetery was laid bare by earth-moving equipment. New types of shaft and chamber tombs contain abundant monochrome and bichrome ceramics. Analysis is now in progress, but Aguilar is of the opinion that they date from before A.D. 900. At the Sitio L6pez in La Pitahya, Cartago, other recently discovered ceramics have yielded evi- dence of contacts with both the Atlantic watershed and the zone known as Curridabat. In view of the disagreement that exists about the age of Curridabat ceramics, the dating of this material will be important. PANAMA. With a third field season (December, 1969-February, 1970) the French Archaeological Mission to Panama, headed by Alain Ichon (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique) brings to an end a comprehensive project in the Azuero Peninsula supported by CNRS and the Comission des Fouilles et Missions Arch6ologiques (RCP 48). Ichon has focused his research on the little-known region of Tonosi, the southernmost sector of the Azuero Peninsula on the Pacific side of the Isthmus. Test excavations of chosen sites were made during the past season to refine and expand a four-phase chronology tentatively proposed by Ichon on the basis of previous season (1968-69). Stratigraphic cuts in the site-zone of La India (TI-1), located 4 km. down- stream from the village of Tonosi, revealed a rich deposit belonging to the area's oldest occupation. Characteristic decorative attributes of Phase I (Bicaro) ceramics-incision, punctuation, brushing, and appliqu6-share general resemblances to the Scarified-Guacamayo wares of Veraguas and Chiriqui. Charcoal from TI-1 has yielded a radiocarbon age of 1930+100 years: A.D. 20 (GIF-1643), placing the beginnings of this occupation well within the late Formative of western Panama. Stratified cultural deposits from the nearby sites of El Cafetal (TI-35) and Canfas (TI-57) yielded materials belonging to the next two phases, El Indio (Phase II) and La Cafaza (Phase III). The first of these phases is best known from the abundant funerary remains ameRican antiquity</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT RESEAR CH found by the expedition in 1968-69 at El Indio (TI-18). The polychrome ceramic style with red, black, and white zoomorphic and anthropomorphic motifs on double-bodied vessels is altogether different from the Cocle ceramics to the north. Despite Ichon's efforts to find parallels in Colombian and Ecuadorian ceramics and in those from nearby Azuero, Phase II pottery from Tonosf remains unique and isolated. Two radiocarbon ages from shell samples confirm the chronological priority of El Indio phase over Cocle phase: 1560?100 years: A.D. 390 (GIF-1641) and 1500?100 years: A.D. 450 (GIF-1642). Abundant stratigraphic evidence also exists for the replacement of Phase II El Indio polychromes by Sitio Conte type Cocle polychromes, and there is a clear break in burial customs between the two phases. Additional information on the transition between Phases III and IV (La Caiaza and Bijaguales) was obtained by Ichon during the last season at site TI-22 from the area at the mouth of the Tonosf River. Phase IV has radiocarbon ages from charcoal associated with circular stone structures: 1100?95 years: A.D. 850 (GIF-1520) from La Bernardina (TI-10) and 955?120 years: A.D. 995 (GX-1545) from Guaniquito Abajo (TI-28). Site TI-22, continuously occupied during all four phases, also yielded materials from the Colonial epoch in the upper strata suggesting a fifth occupation beginning shortly before the Conquest. In order to secure data on the distribution of the Tonosf materials during the four phases, Ichon visited (in 1969-70) 11 sites between Los Santos and Pedasf on the eastern coast of Azuero and between Pedasi and Las Canias on the southeastern coast. These sites contained materials of late Cocle affiliation, bearing cross-ties with Tonosf Phase IV ceramics Sites tested on the west coast of Arena de Quebro were also all Phase IV in date. Particularly surprising, however, was the exact correspondence between ceramics from the Mariato shell middens near the Estero of the Rio Angulo and those of Ichon's Phase II. Mariato is the only place outside of the Tonosf River that shows, to date, close relationships with the El Indio phase dis- coveries. Richard S. Cooke, a graduate student from the Institute of Archaeology, University of London, is working on the western Pacific littoral of the Province of Cocle. The first season (October, 1969-April, 1970) was financed by the Department of Education and Science, London, and transportation in Panama was provided by the Canal Zone Branch, Florida State University. A second stint in the field is projected for the next dry season (1970-71). Excavations at the site of La Herradura near the village of Rio Grande yielded a two-component deposit; analysis of the materials is still in progress. The lower strata contained ceramics typical of the "Aristide Polychrome" group, while the top strata contained sherds of a distinctive ware, known in the literature as El Hatillo, common in open sites near the town of Nata. Sherds of Cocle type were conspicuously scarce and unrestricted in the strati- graphic column. Unfortunately, datable materials from La Herradua were impossible to secure. A total of 37 habitation and cemetery sites were visited by Cooke in the area between the rivers Cocle del Sur and Santa Marfa. These revealed a fairly dense population along the lower reaches of these rivers, especially around Nata and Cerro Zuela (the central occupational zone for Sitio Conte?). Surprisingly few of the sites revealed Cocle-type ceramics, though geometric three-color polychromes of the Nata-type were everywhere abundant. Next year Cooke plans to extend his survey into the upper reaches of the Santa Marfa, Chico, Grande, and Cocle Rivers and the man- grove area on the Pacific coast between Aguadulce and Ant6n. In the westernmost sector of the Isthmus, Olga Linares de Sapir (University of Pennsylvania) reports that the first season (January-April, 1970) of the ethnoarchaeological project financed by the National Science Foundation (GS-2846) is emphasizing the reconstruction of subsistence practices and settlement patterns in selected "natural zones" of Bocas del Toro and Chiriquf Provinces. Philip D. Young (University of Oregon) worked among the Guaymi living in the area today, and Anthony J. Ranere (University of Cali- fornia, Davis), as field director, was in charge of ex- cavations. Graduate students from the University of Panama and several U.S. universities were able to par- ticipate in the project through Ford Foundation traineeship grants. Since the societies on both sides of the Talamancan range differed in degree of socio-political elaboration at the time of the Conquest, the first season in Bocas (on the Atlantic side) has been spent testing a number of related hypotheses on population density and the effects of ecological variables on resource distribution. Preliminary results of excavations conducted in "late" (post A.D. 500) shell middens of Almirante Bay in- dicate the presence of a dispersed population living in scattered hamlets subsisting on root crops, wild game and fish, without the symbols of social stratification present in the larger chiefdoms of Pacific Panama. One intensively excavated site (Cerro Brujo, CA-3) yielded a two-component occupation with affiliations for the oldest period being found further inland in the vicinity of Chiriquicito and up the Talamancan slopes. The more recent occupation cross-ties clearly with the Chiriquf phase. Abundant ceramics, a large faunal col- lection (representing a wide variety of mammals, birds, and fish), chipped and ground lithic assemblage (lacking manos and metates, so common in Pacific- coast shell-middens), and shellfish species are now undergoing analysis. During the second season (January-May, 1971), activities will shift to the Pacific side, in Chiriquf, to seek comparable ecological and settlement pattern data. The Archaeological Society of Panama has been dissolved, and its assets, including extra copies of the society's publications, its library, maps, and site re- ports, have been turned over to the National Museum of Panama. OLGA LINARES DE SAPIR HIGHLAND SOUTH AMERICA COLOMBIA. The El Abra rock shelters, in the Bogota highlands, have yielded evidence of occupation from as early as 12,000 years ago until recent times. Excavations were begun by Thomas van der Hammen (Universiteit van Amsterdam), G. Reichel-Dolmatoff, 239</page><page sequence="8">ameRican antiquity and Gonzalo Correal (Instituto Colombiano de Antropologia). In 1969, Wesley Hurt (Indiana Univer- sity Museum) directed the archaeological phases of the project with the assistance of Correal and John Dorwin (University of Kentucky), while van der Hammen supervised the geological and palynological investi- gations in sediments relating to the climate history of the last 50,000 years. The entire El Abra preceramic stone industry is characterized by unifacial per- cussion-flaked scrapers, blades, and perforators, with projectile points lacking. In addition, baked clay fire- places establish El Abra as a unique preceramic com- plex. In 1970, van der Hammen and Correal began work at a rock shelter near Tequendama Falls in the ex- treme south of the Bogota plateau. Under a layer containing Chibcha pottery, they discovered a pre- viously unknown pottery complex and several pre- ceramic strata with flexed burials and many lithic artifacts, such as percussion-flaked scrapers. Mammal bones and snail shells were also recovered from these deposits, which are assigned to a period of from about 5,000 to 10,000 years ago. Thomas P. Myers (Indiana University) examined several localities in the Magdalena drainage during the summer of 1970. The northern part of Huila was found to be characterized by cursive shaft and cham- ber graves, stone statues, mammiform tetrapod jars, and a variety of as yet unidentified ceramic styles. Directed by Warwick Bray (London University), a survey and excavations were carried out in the Cor- dillera Oriental in the Department of Santander. Donald Sutherland (University of South Carolina) located two unexcavated cemeteries, two caves, and several habitation sites, including two rather large nucleated centers of population. Excavations and analysis of pottery from the Carrizal site by Bray, Richard Cooke, David Hillman, and Donald Heldman point to a late pre-conquest occupation by the Guane. At Cueva La Antigua, excavated with Ines Sanmiguel de Barrera (Instituto Colombiano de Antropologia), similar wares were found along with perishable ob- jects. A plastic-decorated ware, showing affinities with those of the lowland Magdalena and Cesar drainages, underlay the painted pottery at both Carrizal and La Antigua. During summer and fall 1969, Sylvia Broadbent (University of California, Riverside) worked in Bogota on her collections from around Guatavita and an ex- cavated site on the Laguna de la Herrera. The exca- vated material bears out the conclusions, reached from the surface collections, that the ceramics represent a totally different complex than found at sites occupied during the conquest period. ECUADOR. At the University of Manitoba, William Mayer-Oakes has established an obsidian hydration laboratory, which has calculated dates of from approximately 4000 to 26000 B.C. for the arti- facts from the San Jos6 site. A key conclusion of the typological analysis is that the San Jose complex is distinct from El Inga. Of some 20,000 specimens, only five are bifacially worked. There are many more blade tools than at El Inga, although the industry is almost entirely unifacial. Mayer-Oakes is planning major ex- cavations at the San Jose site. Robert Bell (University of Oklahoma) has begun a survey aimed at collecting new information on the El Inga and other preceramic industries in the region centered around Mount Ilala and the valley of the Rfo de la Alcantarilla east of Quito. On the Santa Elena Peninsula, Karen Stockman (Yale University) began a year of surveying and ex- cavating preceramic sites, while at Columbia Univer- sity Edward Lanning and John Cole are completing the analysis of collections made earlier. Betsy Hill and Allison Paulsen are completing their reports on, re- spectively, the Valdivia complex and the Guangala and Libertad complexes. An approach to the climate his- tory of the Santa Elena Peninsula, based mainly on molluscs from archaeological sites, is being prepared for publication by Akkaraju Sarma (Temple Univer- sity). Olaf Holm and Heather Lechtmann excavated sev- eral huge furnaces in the province of Manabi which seem to have been used for smelting metal in prehis- toric times. Although direct evidence of smelting is lacking, the clay linings are vitrified to an extent which indicates very high temperatures. Manteiio ce- ramics were associated with the furnaces and samples for carbon dating were obtained. With Julio Viteri, Olaf Holm is investigating a late Valdivia Formative site in the interior of the province of Manabf. Here a dependence on maritime resources would not have been possible and the settlement is thought to have been based at least partly on farming. Jorge Marcos of Quayaquil discovered workshops of the Guangala culture (ca. 500 B.C. to A.D. 500) with bifacial chert points, similar to Jobo points, of a type frequently found on the Santa Elena Peninsula. Others have attributed such artifacts to preceramic horizons. Also working on the Santa Elena Peninsula, Carlos Zevallos M. is uncovering an extensive Huan- cavilca cemetery. Jos6 Alcina Franch (Universidad de Madrid) made a survey in the province of Esmeraldas on the north coast preparatory to excavations planned for 1971. In 1967 Gordon Hadden cleared and con- solidated some of the Incaic structures at Ingapirca. More recently, excavations by Juan Cueva demon- strated that this south highland center was much larger than previously thought. PERU. Directed by Michael Moseley (Harvard University) and Carol Mackey (San Fernando Valley State College), the Chan Chan-Moche Valley project began its second year of operations centering around mapping and settlement pattern analysis. The 1:5000 base map of greater Chan Chan is complete, and 1:500 architectural plans of the civic center are in prepara- tion. Kent Day (Harvard) finished a series of excava- tions in the great walled compounds of the site. The so-called "smelters" at Chan Chan have received de- tailed study by Heather Lechtman (M.I.T.) and the technical analysis of scoria is underway. In conjunc- tion with the Moche Valley survey, Paul Ossa (Har- vard) located and collected a number of surface sites with substantial lithic materials, and excavated one small rock shelter with a sealed assemblage. The pre- historic canal connecting the Moche and Chicama Val- leys was studied in detail by James Kus (Fresno State College). George Bankes (London Institute of Ar- chaeology) surveyed the Santa Catalina Valley and ex- cavated some Early Horizon and early Intermediate sites. An interesting observation from the survey is 240 [Vol. 36, No. 2, 1971</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT RESEARCH that most of the early Intermediate occupation and burial sites lie along the margins of present day culti- vation. Evidence suggests that the valley was irrigated to its maximum extent in Moche times, after which there seems to have been a gradual shift towards the Chan Chan area. In 1968, Rosa Fung (Universidad Nacional de San Marcos) with Carlos Williams explored the Sechin side valley of the Rfo Casma and excavated at Rumipal- lana. Important discoveries, reported at the last Inter- national Congress of Americanists, include the large size of the Sechih Alto ceremonial complex, which may have covered some 400 hectares by 1200 B.C. In the Cahuacucho stage, about 600 B.C., the ceremonial site had achieved its present size. More recently Fung worked at Bermejo for the Museo Amano, and at the Lomas Lachay site near Huacho in the Chancay Val- ley. Presently, in collaboration with Williams and stu- dents from San Marcos, she is excavating at the Chiva- teros preceramic site and nearby sites of later date. Josefina Ramos de Cox (Universidad Cat6lica) con- tinues her field work at Pando and Tablada de Lurfn. The Pando site shows evidence of use from the Chavin horizon until the 16th century, and Tablada de Lurfn from 9500 B.C. to the 6th century A.D. During the summer of 1970, Craig Morris (Brandeis University) collected data on coastal storage to com- pare with his earlier findings on Inca storage at Huanuco Viejo in the central highlands. Particularly, he is interested in the extent to which large storage complexes were characteristic of urban centers before Inca times, and how Late Horizon storage on the coast differed from that in the highlands. Throughout the central Andes archaeological knowledge is being rapidly extended. Recent work at Chavfn de Huantar by Lufs Lumbreras and Hernan Amat of the Universidad Nacional de San Marcos, demonstrates that this monumental complex covered a much larger area than previously thought. An elab- orate complex of subterranean drainage canals, the extraordinary symmetry of the temple and plaza structures, numerous new sculptured heads with feline and serpent designs, new ceramic complexes, and even a postulated destruction level about 2,000 years ago are some of the particularly noteworthy features. In the Callej6n de Huaylas, Thomas Lynch (Cornell Uni- versity) began excavation of camps used by hunters and perhaps pastoralists from at least 11,640 years ago through the Chavin horizon. Guitarrero Cave, with an occupation dating back 12.560 years was partially excavated in 1969, but earthquake damage has forced the temporary suspension of work in this area. Duccio Bonavia (Museo Nacional de Arqueologia) completed his analysis of material he recovered a few years ago on a difficult survey of the middle Mantaro. Major results included the identification of two large nucleated centers, Condorucho and Uchuihuamanga, on the 3,900m. puna, as provincial centers marking the extent of Incaic expansion in this area. Excava- tions in the large complex of agricultural terraces which descend toward the Mantaro indicate that they were contemporary with and supported the popula- tion centers. Although the terrace systems are not particularly elaborate, they present an interesting system of erosion control. The 1970 season of the Ayacucho-Huanta project, directed by Richard MacNeish (Peabody Foundation, Andover), saw the international collaboration of Antoinette Nelken-Terner (France), Angel Garcia (Mexico), and several Peruvian and North American archaeologists. Barbara Pickersgill (University ot Reading) continued her studies of the botany, while Nathaniel Rutter and Grayson Meade began work on the geomorphology and paleontology, and the late Eric Callen began analysis of the coprolites. Ten stra- tified sites were excavated in addition to two com- pleted in 1969, and Gary Vescelius (Queens College, CUNY) did some preliminary mapping at Wari as well. Some 10,000 preceramic artifacts have been assigned to a succession of phases, beginning with the Pacaicasa complex characterized by crude choppers and heavy scrapers. The Ayacucho phase, which follows, has bone projectile points and other bone tools, crude bifaces, points, burins, and many unifacial tools. This phase bears a radiocarbon age of 14,150?180 years:12200 B.C. (UCLA-1464) and more dates are forthcoming. These two earliest phases as well as the Huanta phase with El Inga-like artifacts, were assoc- iated with bones of extinct animals representing at least 12 species. MacNeish traces a continuous devel- opment from early hunters to sedentary agricul- turalists: Puente phase, 8500 B.C. to 6700 B.C.; Jaywa, 6700 B.C. to 5500 B.C.; Piki, 5500 B.C. to 4000 B.C.; Chihua, 4000 B.C. to 2800 B.C.; Cachi, 2800 B.C. to 1700 B.C. The excavations on ceramic sites by Luis Lumbreras (San Marcos), L. Benevidas (Huamanga), and Vescelius have given a long but less complete sequence of phases which is still being worked out. During the past few years, archaeologists from the University of California at Berkeley have been espe- cially active in the Cuzco area. Edward Dwyer carried out extensive field surveys with particular attention to the late Intermediate K'illki culture and excavated at Sucsahuaman, Pucarra Pantillijlla (just outside the Cuzco Valley), and Minaspata in the Lucre Basin. At this last site, working in collaboration with A. Valen- cia Zeqarra, Dwyer encountered over 4m. of stratified refuse dating from the earliest ceramic period known in the Cuzco area, Marcavalle, to Inca sherds found on the surface. Preservation allowed the recovery of beans, corn, and bones of camelids, guinea pigs, and other small mammals in the earliest levels. In the latter half of 1969, Jane Powell Dwyer studied and photo- graphed over 1000 Paracas style textiles in the Na- tional Museum in Lima. Analysis of these textiles in terms of both chronological ordering and iconographic interpretation is almost complete. Betty Holtzman, now at the University of Kansas, spent parts of 1968 and 1969 analyzing sierra irrigation systems in the Cajamarca and Cuzco valleys. During the summer of 1970, John Rowe, aided by Patricia Lyon and Catherine Brandel, studied and re- corded collections made in earlier years. Paying-par- ticular attention to differences among sites in the surface occurrence of pottery styles, Rowe suggests a division of the Chanapata style into three phases and reports that other problems were brought into sharper focus. The scarcity of sites with a single phase of occupation in the Cuzco area makes the use of surface 241</page><page sequence="10">242 segregation techniques especially difficult, while sug- gesting interesting reflections on the continuity or repetition of settlement patterns. This past season, Rowe also continued a long-term interest in the iden- tification of sites mentioned in early Colonial docu- ments. Visits to two sites named Q'aqya, one in the plain of Anta and the other near Calca, throw light on a peculiar contradiction in Inca traditions regarding their conflict with the Chancas. Dorothy Menzel continues her research on the later part of the Ica style pottery sequence, making new discoveries which are of considerable interest from the point of view of cultural reconstruction. Joel Gross- man has been granted a permit to excavate in the valley of Andahuaylas, where he previously surveyed, and he is now doing stratigraphic tests at the site of Waywaka. ARGENTINA. In recent years. Argentine archae- ologists have been especially active in the cordilleran and subcordilleran arid regions of northwestern and western Argentina, as well as in the high puna exten- sion of the central Andes. Jorge Fernandez (Mina Aguilar, Jujuy) located and excavated a number of preceramic sites in the Sierra de Aguilar-Chulfin or Inca-Cueva, Caverna del Indio, and the Rio Despensas rock shelter among them-while at the same time carrying out geomorphological and ethnobotanical studies. Collections from these sites are somewhat similar to those described by Gonzalez at Intihuasi, but at other sites Fernandez has assigned possibly earlier pebble and flake tools to Malpasense and Aguilarense complexes. In 1969 and 1970, the Instituto de Arqueologia of the Universidad del Salvador, Buenos Aires, centered its activities on the Pucara de la Rinconada, Laguna Vilama (Lidia Alfaro de Lanzone), Volcan (J. M. Suetta), and other localities in the Rinconada and northern puna. A late prehispanic town at Aguas Calientes was investigated by Marta Ottonello de Garcfa Reinoso (Universidad Nacional de Buenos Aires). P. Krapovickas (Museo de La Plata) worked in the region of Yavi, on the Bolivian border, exploring the fortress at Cerro Colorado and a cemetery with tumuli of various ages. M. Pellissero (Museo de Tilcara), G. Madrazo (Museo Etnografico Municipal, Olavarrfa), and Jos6 Antonio P6rez (Museo de La Plata) have been working independently in the Que- brada de Humahuaca, where Ci6naga Grande and Estancia Grande, near Tumbaya, have recently been excavated in an attempt to establish the cultural chronology of this important area. Eduardo M. Cigliano (Museo de La Plata) has been directing extensive excavations at the large town of Santa Rosa de Tastil, northwest of the modern city of Salta, which was occupied for about 100 years during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Principal ob- jects of the investigation have been the determination of household units, population density, and the nature of the relationships of this center with the food- producing area which supported it. Cigliano has sought to establish systems of exchange with other ecological areas, chiefly in the commodities of wood, fiber, fruit seeds, and molluscs. Other projects accomplished by the Cigliano team include excavations in the ceramic age refuse at Las Cuevas (also in the Province of Salta). a survey of preceramic sites in the Quebrada del Toro [Vol. 36, No. 2, 1971 (now under study by H. Calandra), and an investi- gation of the preceramic resources of Antofagasta de la Sierra, originally discovered by O. Barrionuevo. B. Dougherty (Museo de La Plata) discovered ce- ramic traits and other features which link eastern Jujuy with early cultures of the core Argentine Northwest. The western part of the Salta Province is currently under study by Pio P. Dfaz and Myriam Tarrag6 de Font of the Museo Arqueologico de Cachi, who discovered preceramic sites, curious granary-like structures in a cave, and an early ceramic assemblage at Esquina Colorada. The nature of the Candelaria culture, dating in the first millennium A.D., has been further clarified by Eduardo Heredia through excavations at La Cande- laria, San Pedro de Colalao, Chuscha, and other sites on the eastern slopes of the Andes between Salta and Tucuman. Excavations by D. Soria (Universidad de Tucuman) at Guasapampa, south of Tucuman, demonstrate contacts between Andean and lowland (Chaco-Santiaguefio) cultures. In 1969, Alberto Rex Gonzalez (Museo de La Plata) and his staff surveyed the Hualfin Valley and tested numerous sites in northern Catamarca. Among their accomplishments was the detection of a pre- Ci6naga phase. Ana Maria Lorandi, of the same insti- tution, has undertaken a long range study of human occupation of the Province of Santiago del Estero. She has excavated representative sites and defined three broad periods: Las Mercedes, studied first by Reichlen and since dated to about A.D. 1000; Sunchituyoj, a later period represented by some fifty settlements, and Averias, corresponding to the time of European con- tact. Juan Schobinger (Universidad Nacional de Cuyo), to whom the writer is grateful for most of his infor- mation on Argentina, undertook two expeditions to the high Andean region in 1968 and 1970. On Cerro Mercedario at the remarkable altitude of 6,740 m. (only 30 m. below the summit), his party located traces of two small structures with Inca sherds. These, and two more pirca structures at 5,300 and 5,500 m., must be the highest archaeological sites in the world. An Incaic tambillo and various other sites and petro- glyphs were also found. In 1970, Schobinger explored the region northwest of Mendoza and southwest of San Juan, discovering two promising caves and petro- glyphs. Other interesting finds elsewhere in the prov- ince of Mendoza include a preceramic site with "fish- tail" points and an Incaic tambo in the Uspallata Valley, which will be excavated and reconstructed. In the region of San Rafael in southern Mendoza, Humberto Lagiglia (Museo de Historia Natural de San Rafael) identified abundant crude preceramic material on terraces of the Rio Diamante. New excavations in the Gruta del Indio (Rinc6n del Atuel) are supported by a pollen profile by T. van der Hammen and forth- coming radiocarbon dates. The oldest level, ca. 9000 B.C., has fossil bones but no evidence of man; Atuel IV, ca. 6000 B.C., has flaked stone and a hearth; Atuel III, ca. 2000 B.C., contains burials, cut human bones, netting, and matting; and in Atuel II, dating to about A.D. 1, plain pottery, textiles, leatherwork. maize, beans, squash, and quinoa appear. In the province of Neuqu6n, Marcelo B6rmida (Universidad de Buenos Aires) and his collaborators ameRican antiquity</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT RESEARCH conducted archaeological salvage along the Limay and Neuquen rivers during 1969 and 1970. This area will be under water in 1972. but excavations in stratified rock shelters near the dam have already proved pro- ductive. On the terraces of the Rfo Neuquen, a pre- ceramic sequence has been identified, beginning with the Neuquense chopper complex estimated to date to at least 10000 B.C. In 1969, Schobinger also worked in the Limay area, examining a salt mine near Chos Malal, which dates to prehispanic times, and partially excavating a large rock shelter with petroglyphs in Choc6n Chico. In southern Neuquen at Cuyfin Man- zano, Rita Ceballos (Universidad Nacional de Rosario) excavated a stratified cave dating from about 7000 B.C. until modern times. The earliest level contained flakes and unifacial scrapers but no points. CHILE. Pleistocene fauna from Tagua-Tagua con- firms the early date reported by Julio Montan6 (Museo de Historia Natural, Santiago). Use of this site by hunting and gathering people lasted from about 9000 B.C. to 4000 B.C. Montane recently initiated studies of Incaic transculturation in Central Chile, excavating graves within Santiago itself and also nearby at Nos. Lautaro Nufiez (Universidad de Chile, Antofagasta) completed a study of prehispanic traffic and popula- tion movements in northern Chile based on several years of field work. Along a profile from the coast to the altiplano in the Province of Tarapaca, he found evidence of colonizations, commercial expansion, and economic exploitation. In collaboration with D. L. True (University of California, Davis), Nnfiez has illuminated the preceramic resources of this area. Mario Orellana (Universidad de Chile) has been excavating in the Alero de Toconce, the only deep, culturally stratified site yet known in the Atacama Desert. There is a stratigraphic sequence of at least four cultural complexes, and possibly a fifth which may be defined by further excavation in the deepest layer. Hans Niemayer and Virgilio Schiapacasse (San- tiago) have reported on their collections from Miscanti Sur, and argue on stratigraphic and geomorphological grounds that the pentagonal points of Miscanti- Tambillo type are more recent than the blade industry at Tulan and other sites in the Atacama Desert. Gustavo LePaige (Universidad del Norte) has been continuing his work on the biface tradition with an exploration of sites in the now waterless nitrate pampa and in the area around Tulan southwest of the Salar de Atacama. Edward Lanning (Columbia University) spent the past year analyzing his Talabre and Aguas Verdes collections in a study of the development of north Chilean blade industries. He also completed the analy- sis of Columbia's ceramic collections from the Rio Loa and is now writing monographs on both projects. Others collaborating in the Columbia archaeological project are Bernardo Tolosa (Antofagasta), who ana- lyzed the Ayquina complex from the Vega de Ayaviri; Stanley Meltzer (Queens College) studying human use of the Salar de Talabre; Lucille Lewis (Columbia) studying Aguas Verdes and Isla Grande lithic tech- nology; Gordon Pollard (Plattsburgh State College), who completed a study of ecology, settlement pattern, and cultural evolution in the Atacama Desert during the ceramic stage; Eugene McDougle (Columbia) mapping and excavating ceremonial sites apparently associated with llama sacrifice in the Atacama Desert; Mark Druss (Columbia) excavating sites of the Chiu Chiu complex; Michael Preuilh (Universidad Nacional del Cuyo), who finished a study of the geomorphology of the Atacama Desert; and Khairul Rasheed (Colum- bia) who completed an examination of land and water use in the Atacama Desert. Robert Grove (Yale Uni- versity) spent a year in the Atacama Desert excavating Chugui sites and studying trails, including llama trails dating back at least 1,500 years. Grove has shown that the "naturefacts" common at Chugui sites (and dis- tinguishable from human artifacts) were made by burros during colonial and early republican times. THOMAS F. LYNCH LOWLAND SOUTH AMERICA EASTERN PERU. The University of Tokyo Ex- pedition to the Andes under the direction of Chiaki Kano, assisted by Yasusi Miyaki, has carried out ex- tensive excavations at the site of Shillacoto within the limits of the city of Huanuco. The 1967 and 1969 field sessions reveal a stratigraphic sequence largely paralleling that established for the nearby site of Kotosh, but showing a consistently greater elaboration in architecture and ceramic decoration. The four components so far established for Shillacoto are from earliest to latest: Shillacoto-Mito, Shillacoto-Waira- Jirca, Shillacoto-Kotosh, Shillacoto-Higueras. Among the structures cleared the most significant was a temple with architectural details identical to the Mito period temples at Kotosh, but far larger: 15 m. by 15 m. by 2.5 m. Unlike the Mito period temples at Kotosh which lacked ceramics, that at Shillacoto had sherds of Waira-Jirca style in direct association. Also of interest is a large Waira-Jirca tomb, 3 m. by 2.5 m. by 2 m., of fine masonry, covered on the interior with white plaster, painted red on the lower part. The Waira-Jirca tomb was disturbed and anciently looted, but a semicircular subterranean tomb of Kotosh period, intruded into the earlier structure, contained rich and varied grave offerings. Shillacoto is distinguished by the quantity and richness of the Waira-Jirca and Kotosh period ce- ramics. The variety of zoomorphic and anthropo- morphic effigies and adornos in the Waira-Jirca ce- ramic materials is remarkable; most of the birds and animals depicted (notably monkeys) are typical of the tropical forest to the east. Also suggesting ties with the Amazon Basin are trade sherds (specifically of Early Shakimu style) in association with the Waira-Jirca component. A proto-Chavin jaguar head adorns a Waira-Jirca style vessel, and several bone tools are incised with feline representations clearly in the Chavfn style, data which should go far to localize the earliest phases of Chavfi development. The lithic artifacts of the Waira-Jirca component include flaked axes and projectile points; polished T-shaped axes; ground and polished projectile points and knives; mace heads; stone bowls; plates with legs; manos and metates; figurines. All show advanced technology. The full study of this extremely early cultural floresence at Shillacoto, with its clear ties to cultures 243</page><page sequence="12">244 of the Amazon Basin, should go far to solve problems about the origins of the Andean Formative. The work of Scott Raymond (University of Illi- nois) is also shedding considerable light on contacts between the highlands and selva of Peru. During the spring and summer of 1970 Raymond conducted a series of excavations along the lower Rfo Apurimac below 500 m. elevation well within the zone of dense tropical forest. At least four distinct ceramic com- plexes have been recognized. A crumbly plain ware, resembling utility ware from the adjacent areas of the highlands, occurs in assoc- iation with a huge settlement of structures having masonry foundations. The all-over grid pattern of this community is strongly suggestive of such highland cities as Wari, and available evidence would suggest a Middle Horizon dating. The site thus appears to be a control center of the Wari Kingdom. Only a short distance down the river the Sivia site has produced a spectacular ceramic complex, Sivia, characterized by zoned post-fired, resin-based crusting on the outside and resist decoration on the inside. A wide range of surface texturing techniques are present along with applique, face-necked jars. To date, 80 complete vessels have been restored. These materials are clearly within the Cumancaya tradition as known from the central Ucayali. Trade materials of highland origin again suggest a Middle Horizon date. A third complex, Quinipiri, is characterized by large urns with flamboyant incised and appliqu6 de- signs. The fourth complex appears to be the unim- posing leavings of the Campa who are only just va- cating the area. Warren DeBoer (University of California, Berkeley) has completed the analysis of the archaeological ma- terials from the 1969 excavations at the Shahuaya site on the upper Ucayali and will be returning to the upper Ucayali in January, 1971, to conduct an inten- sive survey of proto-historic and historic Conibo sites. Peter Roe (University of Illinois) returned to Cumancaya, an isolated oxbow lake east of the main- stream of the Ucayali river above its confluence with the Pachitea, in the summer of 1970 to conduct fur- ther excavations at site UCA-22. A high water table forced Roe to work on the more elevated part of the site. A cemetery was discovered in the eighth century A.D. Cumancaya midden. It yielded the first extensive series of complete vessels for the complex. Six con- tiguous 2 m. by 2 m. squares produced a huge volume of ceramics, most of which was stored at Yarinacocha near Pucallpa awaiting final analysis in 1971. The restored pots have been deposited at the Museo Na- cional de Antropologia y Arqueologia, Lima. The aim of the investigation is to provide information about correlating cultures with the various river meander stages evident in the area and to define completely the cultural content of the Cumancaya complex. Juan Yangues (University of Illinois) returned to the Alto Pachitea during the summer of 1970 to continue the program of study initiated by William Allen. Excavations were confined to the Santa Isabel site (PAC-57) on the Rio Neguechi. Besides permitting a more complete definition of the earlier complexes in the long sequence developed by Allen, the recent [Vol. 36, No. 2, 1971 excavations permit the description of two relatively recent ceramic complexes, Pichis and Yanahuara. During the summer of 1970, Ronald L. Weber (University of Illinois) returned to Imarfacocha and continued his intensive excavations at the site of Shebonasi (TAM-11), obtaining sufficient ceramic material to permit a full description of the Caimito complex. He also conducted extensive site survey around Imarfacocha and up the Rio Tamaya, dis- covering 13 new sites. Several of these are further huge middens of the Caimito complex and one site pro- ducing Cumancaya materials was located. Sites far up the Rfo Tamaya have produced ceramics with very heavy cariape tempering and incised designs somewhat intermediate between Cumancaya and modern Conibo. EASTERN COLOMBIA. Charles Bolian (University of Illinois) is conducting survey and excavations during the fall and winter 1970 in the vicinity of Leticia. A large site producing a variety of complex ceramics of the Polychrome "Horizon" has now been discovered, and a site Loreto-yaci, producing fiber tempered pottery is being intensively investigated. The fiber-tempered pottery is mainly from open bowls, and crude corrugation is a typical surface finish. Sherd and cariap6 tempered ceramics are also associated. LOWLAND VENEZUELA. Mario Sanoja and Iraida Vargas are currently using the facilities of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., for the final write-up of several interrelated projects dealing with the cultural ecology and culture history of the Maracaibo Basin and the lower Orinoco. BOLIVIA. Carlos Ponce Sangines announces that a program of research on the lowlands of eastern Bolivia has been started recently. The investigations were undertaken by Sr. Maks Portugal and the first pub- lished results will appear soon. BRAZIL. Dr. Nassaro Antonio de Souza Nasser (Chief, Department of Archaeology, State University of Rio Grande do Norte) reports the following activi- ties: There has been extensive archaeological research in the Rfo Curimatau basin and in the Serra de San- tana. In the first region, a ceramic complex was iden- tified, the Curimatau phase, that appears to be a component of the painted sub-tradition of the Tupiguarani tradition, emphasizing red and/or black on white slip. The lithic artifacts are non-diagnostic. Given the disturbed nature of the middens and the lack of physical stratigraphy, the chronological posi- tion of the Curimataf phase is yet to be determined. However, given the dating for the Itapicuru phase of Bahia (ca. A.D. 1300), also a part of the painted sub-tradition, one might infer the arrival of the Curimatai phase in Rib Grande do Norte was little before the first European contacts, assuming that this population movement was, in fact, from south to north. In the Serra de Santana, at an elevation of 700 m., 12 sites were located. Though of little depth, they yielded great quantities of ceramics. Painting similar to that of the Curimataf phase is the characteristic form of decoration. Spindle whorls and stone abraders were also collected. Preliminary examination of this ma- terial suggests affiliation with the painted sub- tradition. Several sites with petroglyphs were located. During the fall of 1970, research will be intensified in ameRican antiquity</page><page sequence="13">CURRENT RESEARCH this area and extended westward into the basin of the Rio Apodi. Maria da Conceicao Beltrao (Head, Archaeological Sector, National Museum) reports on the expanded activities of her division. A reorganization of the "Specialization Courses" will permit the training of advanced graduate students and the implementation of Federal Law No. 3924 concerning the protection of Brazilian archaeological sites. For the first time in the history of Brazil a masters degree in archaeology will be granted and a program leading to the doctorate in archaeology is being developed. Two major lines of research are being carried out in conjunction with this program for the training of qualified scientific personnel. The first is a study of the Early Lithic sites, possibly predating 8000 B.C., on the Planalto Meridional. By a combination of strati- graphic excavations and geomorphological studies a sequence of stone artifacts will be developed. Also under intensive investigation are the sites associated with the mangrove of the coastal plain of the states of Rfo de Janeiro and Guanabara. These sites, less than 1500 years old, produce pottery which can be readily assigned to the Tupiguaranf tradition, and on the basis of historical evidence can be related to the Tupinamba. Of the five Tupfguarani tradition sites located on Ilha Grande three were still surrounded by mangrove while the other two were in areas where the mangrove had only recently been destroyed. Thirty similar sites have been located on the Guaratiba plain and five of the best preserved have been selected for intensive investigation. The middens are typically less than 50 cm. deep and over 50% of the volume is made up of mollusk shell. The study of the characteristics of these sites in the Tupiguaranf tradition is being done as a part of a broad interdisci- plinary investigation of all aspects of the culture his- tory of Tupf-Guaranf speaking peoples. Ondemar Farreira Dias Jor (Division of Historic and Artistic Heritage, State of Guanabara) reports four ongoing projects. (1) April-June, 1970, was spent in a survey in the southern part of the State of Minas Gerias, specifically on the left bank of the Rfo Grande and in the headwaters of the Rfo Sao Francisco. Seven ceramic sites were recorded, two of which were lo- cated within limestone caverns. (2) July-September 1970, two sites within the state of Rio de Janeiro were investigated: a cave yielding secondary burials with no grave goods; and an open site with ceramics of the Mucuri phase (pre-Tupfguaranl). (3) Registration of historical and archaeological sites in the state of Guanabara is continuing. To date more than 150 his- torical sites and 50 archaeological sites have been recorded. (4) The excavation of an 18th century house, possibly the birthplace of the Duke of Caixas, was carried out in conjunction with the Institute de Arqueologia Brasileira. URUGUAY. Tabare Flangini (Secretary, Centro de Estudios Arqueologicas de Montevideo) reports on the completion of a study of 1500 lithic projectile points from Rfo Negro, all in the collection of Sr. Antonio Taddei. He also documents the admirable recent pub- lication record of the Center in various foreign jour- nals and series. ARGENTINA. Victor A. Nufiez Regueiro (Hon- orary Research Associate. Smithsonian Institution) is continuing his long-term investigation of the proto- historic and historic period in the province of Cor- rientes. Work now completed has permitted the defin- ition of one proto-historic phase in the Tupfguarani tradition, Yaguarf, and three historic phases showing the progressive loss of indigenous material culture. Current work along the Rfo Parani and its tributaries, in the vicinity of Goya, is designed to document the route and chronology of the spread of the corrugated sub-tradition of Tupfguaranf tradition. Professor Ana Maria Lorandi (University of La Plata) reports on her continuing intensive study of human utilization of the alluvial plain which makes up most of the province of Santiago del Estero. Work has been centered in the lowlands between the middle course of the Rfo Dulce and the Rfo Salado. To date, her work has disclosed a three phase cultural chron- ology. The earliest phase, Cortaderas, is characterized by a polished gray ware with incised decoration and a dis- tinctive style of polychrome. There are strong cultural ties with the eastern slopes of the Argentine Andes. Sites are small and artificial mounds are absent. The second phase, Sunchituyoj, shows a com- pletely different settlement pattern. Sites consist of one, two, or sometimes three rows of artificial mounds along the actual or ancient courses of the meandering rivers. The mounds served to elevate the houses above the level of the annual flood. Intensive hunting of land mammals and considerable use of fish are indicated. The ceramic inventory is characterized by black slip painting on brilliant red, reddish, tan, and cream sur- faces, in which the only motif is a bird showing varying degrees of stylization. The final phase, Averias, shows many continuities from its predecessor, but with the addition of the Averias Polychrome. There is no change in settlement pattern, but, there is a suggestion of an increased importance for agriculture and a decreased depen- dence on hunting. In the Sunchituyoj and Averias phases, the groups appear to show a complete adaptation to the riverine environment. In contrast to the earliest phase, these cultures are closely related to the tropical forest cul- tures of the Amazon Basin and show Andean influence only in the form of isolated cultural elements.
