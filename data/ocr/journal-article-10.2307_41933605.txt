Furthermore, Korean monarchs were alienated from the people whose voice would only be interpreted for the interests of yangban since they were the only literati. Vox populi was displaced by vox yangban in the Confucian equation, 'the will of the people is the Mandate of Heaven."'6 The Sa elites also staged another ideological campaign in which to re-encode Confucian values and symbols in their ethico-cul turai order with a view to gaining the consensus and participation from the rest of society.7 As Martina Deuchler indicates, "the definition, exer- cise, and control of morality vested the ruling elites with a high measure of authority" ulti- 4 The notions of hierarchy and status distinction are not solely unique to Confucianism. "The fact that the extended territorial states of ancient civilizations necessarily involved an unequal division of power, hier- archy, and authority was, of course, taken for granted not only in China, but in all the ancient civilizations which came under the control of large territorial states. In China, the model of the natural and sacred hi- erarchy of the patrilinear family may have lent its own coloration to the concepts of hierarchy and author- ity, but we must again remember that even in the history of the West, with its memories of Athenian 'democracy,' the notion that democracy cannot be implemented in large territorial states requiring highly centralized power remained accepted wisdom as late as Montesquieu and Rousseau."

As Kang Chehun demonstrates, the Sa elites harnessed the symbolic power of various cultural programs, grounded on the models in the Three Dynasties, in order to visualize and concretize timeless order as moral and normal in the mind and heart of the Chosön people.9 Particularly, the Cheng-Zhuist exposition on ye i§[ (rituals and rites) capti- vated them. As the essential congregate of timeless order and the formulaic pivot of Confu- cian civilization, the rituals and rites provoked both the participatory motivation for timeless order and the normative rationale for what was supposed to be regularly performed on a daily basis.10 From the sixteenth century on, a Confucian reformist group, conventionally called Sarim ±#, played a central role in expanding the ideological campaign of Sa hegemony. As the opinion makers, social activists, and community leaders in Chosön, they tried to consoli- date Sa hegemony by way of more effectively controlling such institutional mechanisms as the local private academy, government service examinations, and public documentation bureaus.11 It thus became apparent that these systems created a more organic condition streamlining education, central politics, state rites/rituals, and official archives together into a wider ideological orbit for their sociopolitical and cultural dominance. To fulfill the ideologi- cal objective, the Sarim elites also espoused the highly moralistic tohak ÎË^, or Cheng-Zhu Learning whose coherence ties the realization of timeless order in human society with the earthly working of li S (Confucian Principle or Universal).12 The two towering Sarim lead- 8 Martina Deuchler, "Reject the False and Uphold the Straight: Attitudes Toward Heterodox Thought in Early Yi Korea," in Wm.

With these ideas in mind, I explore in the following pages how Yi I took up the Cheng- Zhuist articulation on li in order to reconstruct the coherent yet flexible mode of thinking in Chosön Confucianism. It will be argued that his elaboration on the universality of li resulted in the construction of a self-referential structure in Confucianism and the fortification of a Chosön version of Confucian civilization. The use of Confucianism can be perceived as a strategic form of intellectual engagement in the practice of Sa hegemony.21 The finding of the vigorous dialogue between theory and praxis in Yi's interpretation will touch on one primary feature of intellectual history, i.e., the relations between thought and action.22 Lion Sarim Terms Western scholars know little about Yi Ts works, although the significance of his scholarship has received attention from some scholars.23 Notwithstanding, it was argued that Yi's theo- retization of li and ki has been overly studied in the area of intellectual history. For instance, Edward Chung has pointed out that the series of literati purges against the Sarim elites from the late fifteenth to mid-sixteenth centuries ended with their victory over the established Hun'gu WjV Sa elites. According to Chung, Yi Hwang' s and Yi I's discourse on the nature of and relationship between li and ki was the landmark in Chosön Confucianism that began taking a morally-oriented and philosophically-driven path.24 JaHyun Kim Haboush discusses the Cheng-Zhuist emphasis on an ideal moral man who is expected to act "in accord with the rules of proper social behavior."25 Yet, the metaphysical and behavioral dimensions need to be contextualized more into the reality of the Sarim engagement associated immediately with Sa hegemony. rea: Hong Tae-Yong's Vision of 'Relativism' and Iconoclasm for Reform," Philosophy E¿ist and West 493 (1999), pp. 282-289. 20 Bol, Neo-Confucianism in History , p. 1 1 1 . 21 Yi Chöngch ol, "Introduction," in The Institutional Basis of Civil Governance , p. 1 0. 22 Felix Gilbert, "Intellectual History: Its Aims and Methods," Daedalus 100.1 (1971), pp. 81-82. 23 Julia Ching, "Yi Yulgok on the Tour Beginnings and the Seven Emotions'," in De Bary and Haboush, The Rise of Neo-Conjucianism in Korea ; Chung, The Korean Neo-Confucianism ofYi T'oegye and Yi Yul- gok Ro, The Korean Neo-Confucianism ofYi Yulgok. 24 Chung, The Korean Neo-Confucianism ofYi V )egye and Yi Yulgok , pp. 35-36 and pp. 1 83- 1 86. 25 JaHyun Kim Haboush, "The Education of the Yi Crown Prince: A Study in Confucian Pedagogy," in De Bary and Haboush, The Rise of Neo-Confucianism in Korea, p. 166.</page><page sequence="6">42 Joseph Jeong-il Lee Here, I pay special attention to Yi Ts discursive manipulation which shifted the Cheng- Zhuist articulation on li into a theoretical fulcrum for a flexible, comprehensive, and adjus- tive mode of thinking in Chosön Confucianism. First, Yi firmly believed A, termed often- times as li of Heaven (^S), to be the basis of timeless order in human society, or more realis- tically speaking, in the establishment of Chosõn. Then, his exposition on li went further by inquiring into a dialogical operation of li and ki in pursuance of the universal working of li in this world. Instead of any independent operation, li and ki are originally inseparable from each other, so they are like one entity. However, the reason why they are regarded as different is that li has no form whereas ki has form; li is the agency of being absent-cause whereas ki is the agency of operation. That which leads the work of ki in form and action is li. And, that which serves as the tool of the immeasur- able and invisible [leadership of] li is ki with the attribute of form and action.26 Thus, Yi I shed light on the mediatory measure of ki whose active workability manifests li as an absent-cause beyond form, norm, and value. The active force of ki goes in association with the ultimate causality of li}1 Li rides the work of ki, and only in concurrence with ki can li be manifested in this world.28 With the interdependent relationship between li and ki, Yi I reinvoked the universality of li (S~^) in relation to the vital operation of ki which carries the attribute of li into all thing? of this world in diversity (ftW). Li is meant to be universal in phenomena. Initially, li tells no difference between imparti- ality and partiality; availability and unavailability; lucidity and opaqueness; purity and im- purity. But, the work of ki [in which //] travels has an all-around operation without cessa- tion and interruption, and forms a full range of difference and diversity. This is the way this world comes into being with all things given difference vis-à-vis one another. Despite being universal, as li moves [in this world] via ki , its attribute turned into diversity. Hence, li comes to be the li of the heaven-and-earth [phenomena] in the heaven-and-earth [phe- nomena], the li of things in things, and the li of human beings in human beings.29 26 nm-w. mmmm, m J§W MGMZŽ&amp;, mtà.

It is through the transcendental yet immanent trait that li holistically and seam- lessly permeates cosmos and the earth alike in phenomena, even running throughout the human body and being the full commander of the human mind-and-heart. Yi I located the importance of human mind-and-heart as the operational directorate of li embedded inher- ently in human being. Here, I find it interesting to see how, in Yi I's redefinition, the inner nature of human be- ings could be made evaluative by a standard of the universal li. The duality of transcendence and immanence under the framework of li allowed Yi I to maintain that the li of things is what is called en bloc the presence of the li of Heaven in things themselves and, human mind- and-heart is also part of things.32 Relying on the universality of li made possible the integra- tion of the li of Heaven, the li of things (4Ž1S), and the li of human mind-and-heart M). Thinking this out, Yi repelled the way Song Hon ( 1 535-1 598) drew a definite line between the li of Heaven and the li of things.33 What should merit our attention is the logical ease with which to transvaluate the uni- versality of li into an all-embracing and all-pervasive perspective ( Ê From the [transcendental] perspective of Heaven, a statement that the mind-and-heart of humans is also one thing [under Heaven] is rigjht.

So, [this being the case, when things are discussed] only are things discussed, [then,] the human mind-and-heart is not in the midst of them [so both cannot be discussed on the same level].34 The emphasis on the holistic viewpoint/standpoint, elicited from the universal presence of//, generated a theoretical rationale for juxtaposing things and humans collaterally and opposing any compartmentalizing orientation. Utilizing this framework, Yi charged Song' s position as a divisive form of anthropomorphism that differentiated the category of human mind-heart from that of things in this world. Likewise, articulations on the universality of li offered Yi an interpretive competence filled with a comprehensive and integrative point of view. What is noticeable is that the perspective magnification did not veer to a form of self- denial in a Buddhist/Taoist vein, nor did it head toward modern positivism in the scientific search of the outer world. Instead, Yi I related the perspective extension to a proper attain- ment of do it or the Way in this world.35 Perceiving the entirety of knowledge in the Way is equivalent to grasping the complete panorama of li without any partial standpoint. Knowl- edge and perspective are to be interconnected for an adequate understanding of lu Still, grasping the comprehensive perspective and complete knowledge of li happens only when it is demonstrated to be workable in practice. Why? When learning is carried out under the guidance of other people, the learners might well fall into passivity, dependence, and superficiality.36 Pursuit of li without practice, then, ends not only in the lack of a com- prehensive epistemological and perspective ken (MM), but also the loss of an independent viewpoint ( ÉJ M). Importandy, the first has something to do with objectivity while the sec- ond with subjectivity in the learning process. Practice was perceived as a vital venue where the learners can develop both objectivity and subjectivity. Alongside this, Yi I reprehended those who simply follow the words of the others, placing their learning at the lowest level37 Those who attain the objectivity of learning are located in the medium level. Yi applauded the most desirable level of knowledge-perspective in which the learners are able to put their comprehensive perspective ken into effect and achieve genu- ine knowing (Ä£P). The truest learners at the highest level, metaphorically compared to a climber who makes an ascent up a mountain of li in person, should command both objectiv- ity and subjectivity from what they learn. Practice plays an indispensible role in a constructive response of the learners to the totality of perspective and knowledge. It is at this juncture that 34 M in Yulgok chönsö, 9:30a3-6. 35 The Way, treasured in the Confucian sages' and worthies' teaching (Mff ¿Is"), means the path of£. 36 Yulgok chönsö, 10:35a4-b3. 37 Ibid, 10:34a5-b4.</page><page sequence="9">Patterning a Chosõn-focused Discourse in Yi I's Understanding of Li 45 the learners are in a position to land the great vista of li at their own feet, taste its real scenery, and ultimately behold a self-actualizing usefulness - the core inventory of subjectivity - for themselves.38 Thus, weaving together the tapestry of perspective, knowledge, and practice aforementioned, he turned this troika into a competent and balanced framework which holds objectivity and subjectivity together. Yis account might not sound different from the typical Cheng-Zhu emphasis on actual application of learning into the real life of learners themselves.39 The justification of knowing in the Cheng-Zhu scholarship, as is widely known, is associated with a life-changing and transformative practice. Real knowledge is to be the living knowledge in action. But, what distinguishes Yi's reformulation from the conventional Cheng-Zhu scholarship is that he coalesced both perspective and knowledge into practice in order to have a total understand- ing of Confucianism (fpÄ^fefS) in a balance of objectivity and subjectivity. Handling the binary of the comprehensive, common objectivity and the self-motivated, self-accomplishing subjectivity did stimulate an eclectic, originative, and critical standpoint of the learners them- selves including the Sarim group of Chosön in the sixteenth century. The dualism is significant in the sense that reinvoking the magnitude of objectivity made Yi more confident of the Confucian frame of reference in general, whereas resuscitating the meaning of subjectivity paved the way for establishing a self-referential framework of Chosön Confucianism in particular. This orientation enabled Yi to develop a flexible viewpoint, under which other viewpoints were more smoothly incorporated into his own Confucian phraseology, and to create a Confucian selfhood of his own. I believe that adding a learner- friendly flavor to Chosön Confucianism, as discussed, became conducive to augmenting the positionality of Yi I himself in discursive practice. Moreover, Yi evaluated the ideas of several Chinese scholars with his own reinterpretation and reformulation on li. Foremost, he disqualified the Sima Qian group on the ground that they were primarily incognizant of what Ii was and ignorant of the totality of li.40 Those belonging to the Zeng Dian m SÄ group, as well as Bo Yi 10 and Liu Xiahui $P T n8, according to Yi, had a chance of experiencing the totality of li. But the first did not seek to climb to the top of a mountain - the metaphor of li - while the second stagnated with one aspect of the totality of li. Apart from the absence of an independent viewpoint (subjectivity), neither of them provided any objective standard of a comprehensive epistemologi- 38 Ibid, 10:35b3-9. 39 " [Neo-] Confucian learning came with a theory of learning, and this theory gave those who internalized it a ready means of making sense out of the everyday human experience of acquiring knowledge, thinking, feeling, and making choices."

A negative likelihood is that these groups might misguide others into confusion by dint of their partial interpretation or myopic viewpoint. What about Confucius's own disciples?41 Yi classified them into two categories. The first was composed of those who had not assumed a perfect and profound capacity. It is the sec- ond that constituted the orthodox line finalized by Zhu Xi. This second group, Yi argued, equipped a comprehensive ken as well as a self-motivated practice. The consummate state of learning in a perfect balance between objectivity and subjectivity was accomplished in their scholarship. In so doing Yi was able to uphold the legitimacy of the Cheng-Zhu line not so much by any mere purity of content as via his own criterion that associates objectivity with subjectivity. This move allowed him to recognize the Cheng-Zhu line as one central platform for the proper understanding of li and refute any essentialization of the Cheng-Zhuist inter- pretation as the single dogma. In this vein, Yi I also judged the scholarship of the contemporary Luo Qinshun (1465-1547) in Ming China as well as that of Yi Hwang and Sö Kyöngdök fàWiM (1489- 1 546). 42 The comprehensive, yet not ex parte , posture motivated Yi I to run not only against one excess of Yi Hwang s centripetal tendency towards a lopsided Cheng-Zhu orthodoxy, but also the other excess of So Kyöngdöks centrifugal tendency off the Cheng-Zhuist credo. The weakness of Yi Hwang is the overreliance on Zhu Xi whereas the flaw of So Kyöngdök was the unrestraint of individualistic attitude. In so doing Yi I showed an open respect for the comprehensive scale of Luo Qinshuns scholarship over the dogmatic fortitude of Yi Hwang for Zhu Xi and the theoretical superfluity of So Kyöngdök towards subjectivism whose scholarship was not encouraged to pursue.43 Luo Qinshuns scholarship was placed on the top, Yi Hwang' s in the middle, and Sö Kyöngdök's at the bottom. To sum up, Yi I knew how to thread the Cheng-Zhu scholarship into a general fabric of Confucianism by capitalizing on the universality of //, whence knowledge, perspective, prac- tice, objectivity and subjectivity could be redefined in his own terms. That is why Yis ap- proach to Confucianism did not take on any dogmatist posture to the Cheng-Zhuist ortho- dox.

Ming and Chosön also maintained their politico-cultural solidarity in the theme of Confucian civilization against the 'barbarous' Mongols and Manchus with the belief that the confluence of cultural order and political order in a Han Chinese hegemony corresponded to the practice of Confucian civilization.45 The uncivilized neighbors around the center of Confucian civilization were to submit them- selves to the Han-Chinese Pax Sinica. For the court and central elites of Chosön, the Chi- nese hegemony over East Asia symbolized the international working of timeless order which was also integral to erecting the legitimacy of the Chosön establishment.46 In this regard, the discourse on Confucian civilization underpinned an ideological ground for the inseparable linkage between Sa hegemony in Chosön and Ming hegemony in East Asia. Despite the close alliance, Chosön always shielded its autonomous position in the Ming- centered world system. The court and ruling Sa elites not only made strenuous efforts to create a Chosön module for Confucian civilization, especially on the basis of Civil Govern- ance of the Three Dynasties, but also kept abreast of the latest developments/trends in the continent, a survival strategy for the politico-cultural community of Chosön itself. They were also well aware of the historical fact that the authority of a Han-Chinese dynasty prior to Ming was challenged by such barbarian conquerors as Khitan Liao (907-1 125), Jurchen Jin (1 1 15-1234), and Mongolian Yuan (1271- 1368).47 The Chosön court was anxious about the expansion of Ming influence into Manchuria since the period of Emperor Yongle. For Chosön, the Ming influence in Manchuria meant a loss of a bumper zone along its north- 44 Kenneth M.

In this context, Yi I found out that the Cheng-Zhu stress on the universality of li could further envisage a Chosön version of Confucian civilization, inseparable from the enhance- ment of Sa hegemony over Chosön. This time, he molded the nature of li into an interplay between general substance ) and general use In the first place, Yi subscribed to the Confucian notion that civilization represents the everlasting order and rule from Heaven in principle and fleshes out the unchangeable constant of li in content. The primary impulse for the exercise of Confucian civilization originates in one coherent body of li that never changed nor changes.51 What stands out beyond time and space in Confucian civilization, then, is nothing less than the operation of li throughout this world. The Shang dynasty could not alter the perpetual wholeness of its operation according to (the civilizational version of) the preceding Xia dynasty. Likewise, the Zhou dynasty could not alter the perpetual whole- ness of its operation according to (the civilizational version of) the preceding Shang dynasty. Despite its supreme role, the disruption or discontinuity of a dynasty is a variable element in the construction of Confucian civilization and, finally, in the earthly operation of the univer- sal//.52 48 Pak Wönho, Myöngch o chosorigivarigyesayörigu, p. 163. 49 The aggressive Ostpolitik of Emperor Yongje in Manchuria stemmed from his sensitivity to the strong presence of Mongols in the north.

How- ever, its universality notwithstanding, general substance is to be activated in conformity with specific conditions of a human agent who unavoidably inherits temporal and spatial limit. Practically speaking, human responses occasion varied types of institutions and systems; in reality, what people demand cannot go unchangeable. It is at this juncture that general use functions as a complementary antithesis to any monolithic typecasting of general substance in understanding the earthly operation of li. Yi's juxtaposition of general substance along with general use willed a necessity of spatio-temporal contexts in the process. Yi pushed ahead with an idea that the ritual systems, brought into completion during the period of the Zhou dynasty, underwent the process of transformation and adaptation.53 Due to difference in time and in human production, the rites and rituals of the previous two dynasties before Zhou complied with the demand of each era, not grooving into a uniform system which is always applicable to each and every age. That is why the Duke of Zhou took into full account what is to be desirable and fathomed what is to be in counterpoise. To put it another way, there is a desideratum available for Xia, not for Shang, in the operation of Con- fucian civilization; there is an optimum available for Shang, not for Zhou.54 A noteworthy point to be made here is that desirability (ÍE) and optimality (iâ), rever- berated through Yis emphasis on general use, served as the effective theoretical means for defying a unilineal singularization of Confucian civilization. In fact, reliance on general sub- stance tends to wind up with a side effect that not only fossilizes Confucian civilization into a fixed structure, but also petrifies its process into a rigid configuration of operation. Alterna- tively, Yi employed general use as a countermeasure, which compensated for the excessive homogenization of general substance and as an index of diversity to the successful operation of Confucian civilization in various locales. Not allowing the diversification of Confucian civilization to be enough, Yis recourse to general use carved out the actual contribution of human agency to a successful operation of Confucian civilization in the post-Three Dynasties era. The sagacity of Confucius (tradi- tional dates BC 55 1-BC 479) is revealed through his knowledge of how to organize a proper founded by later sage-kings, when the Way was put into practice in government and correa learning was propagated. Second was the period when the Way was neither practiced in government nor understood by scholars.... Third was the new age, when the Way, although not yet practiced in government, was once again understood by scholars. This third age, which began not with the founding of the Song dynasty in 960 but in the 1060s- 1070s with scholars who lacked political power, was fundamentally different from the imperial history of the second age."

Likewise, Yi I enumerated historical examples in Tongho mundap all of which were drawn to the appropriate standard of measuring qualified rulers and ministers with respect to the construction and maintenance of Confucian civilization in imperial China.56 Yi's critical evaluation, formatted in the style of Cheng-Zhu Learning, did not merely list such noted rulers as Emperor Gaozu of Han China (r. 202 BC-195 BC), Emperor Wen of Han China (r. 180 BC-157 BC), Emperor Wu of Han China (r. 141 BC-87 BC), Emperor Guangwu of Han China (r. 5 BC - 57), Emperor Taizong of Tang China (r. 626-649), Emperor Taizu of Song China (r. 960-976) and numerous prominent historical figures in court. He also examined their deeds and achievements with great discretion and pointed out the inability of rulers and ministers after Mencius to lead the civilization project in a proper way.57 As a result, the Kingly Way (īiS) disappeared in rulership and among the true Confucian elites.58 The great Confucian civil governance of the Three Dynasties was lost, not to be restored until the rise of Cheng-Zhu Learning. The situation of Chosön was discussed on the same basis. Since the era of Kija (Ch. Qizi), the spread of the Way had been severed in the land of Chosön.59 It was the reign of King Söngjong (r. 1469-1494) that reached the level of Great Peace, a crescendo of the royal efforts, particularly made by such kings as Taejo (r. 1392-1398), Sejong (r. 1418-1450), and Munjong (r. 1450-1452), to establish the Confucian civilization of Chosön.60 The tyranny of King Yönsan (r. 1494-1506) was replaced by the court of King Chungjong (r. 1506- 1544) in which the senior Sarim elites emerged under the banner of Cho Kwangjo ( 1 482- 1 5 1 9) in central politics.6 1 55 Ibid., 6:37t&gt;5- 1 1. 56 Yulgok chõnsõ , 1 5:2a3-33b7. Tongho mundap encompasses a wider range of reform plans encompassing taxation, manners, land, central politics, military organization, status system, slavery, local administration, diplomacy, and the like. Yi's community compact also reveals a higher degree of realism and adaptability' by which his Sarim colleagues were encouraged to devise communicative and co-optive strategies for a better interaction with and leadership over their local communities.

In consequence, the Sarim engagement was entwined with the Confucian civiliza- tion of Chosön, both of which were incorporated sublimely into the larger paradigm of Confucian civilization. To be sure, deploring the post-Mencius discontinuation of the Way in governance and academic legitimacy can be said to be one of the main rhetorics of the Cheng-Zhuist scholars who utilized that rupture as the political and academic legitimation of their own.63 Yi I, nonetheless, did not simply follow the Cheng-Zhuist suit. As previously discussed, his theo- retical reliance on the theme of the universal li pinned the focal point of Confucian civiliza- tion on diversity and human agency. He illuminated the sagacious insight of Confucius into the Confucian civilization of the Zhou dynasty whose up-and-down paradigm displayed both a civilizational advance in full flourish and a dysfunctional defect amenable to deca- dence/breakdown.64 Then, the Civil Governance of the Three Dynasties was by no means blindly glorified by Yi I, nor were their achievements passively exalted either. With the combined emphasis on diversity and human agency, what came well into effect is a flexible way of thinking that respects the context and specifics of the individual paradigm extendable to the Confucian civilization of Chosön. Learning the merits and demerits of one paradigm - having existed in the pre-Ming, Ming, pre-Chosön, or Chosön era - becomes crucial to predicting an adequate performance of Confucian civilization according to varying time and space. The Kingly Way of Chosön is as important as the Kingly Way of Ming in executing a timely restoration of the Civil Governance of the Three Dynasties and, eventu- ally, a proper realization of Confucian civilization. Ming and Chosön alike are able to engen- der a Confucian civilization of their own while sharing the general substance of the universal li with each other. In this eclectic and balanced way of thinking, Yi was able to treat multiple paradigms equally by one coherent standard and make Confucian civilization more objecti- fied. 62 Ibid., 15:llal-12a7; 15:13a8-14al0; 15:31b6-32all. 63 Thomas A.

But, Yi I of sixteenth-century Chosön suggested the multiple renditions of Confucian civilization from imperial China and royal Korea alike under the framework of the universal li. Without tarnishing the lead- ing role of Ming China in Confucian civilization, I ascertain, he maximized the universality of li to boost a Chosõn-focused perspective in Confucian civilization. Ming and Chosön, if different in rank, row in the same grand boat of Confucian civilization. And, Yi I took up the universality of li to devise a method for the protection of the Con- fucian civilization of Chosön proper. One vivid example can be found in On Tributary Route (llS&amp;ffi), one of Yi's writings formatted as a policy treatise (íŘfnj).66 In the question section, the king first affirms the relationship with Ming China in the Confucian terminology of serving the great the keyword of timeless order in international relations. This idea was also bolstered by the Sarim elites who positioned the external actualization of timeless order into the Sino-centric world system of East Asia. To the extent that the status system of Chosön is also based on Confucian hierarchy, the king asserts that Ming matter is direcdy involved with the fundamental guideline of national policy and urges not to be ill-prepared in the case of sudden emergency.67 Namely, the proper orchestration of state ideology plays on the domestic order of Chosön and its diplomatic stability with China, both of which are inseparable from each other. This attitude came in step with the fact that the Sarim elites also sought the Confucian framework that links the geopolitical hierarchy between Ming and Chosön with the exercise oí Sa hegemony in Chosön.68 At the same time, Chosön arranged some practical approaches to Ming for national secu- rity. The king expected a contingence plan in regards to the current situation around Ming suffering from pirates raids along its eastern and southern coasts, and from the northern famine, after which the Mongols crossed the Great Wall to destroy many fortresses along the borderline.69 Furthermore, Chosön also recognized a more realistic challenge: It was over 65 De Bary, "Introduction," in same and Haboush, The Rise ofNeo-Confiicianism in Korea , p. 21. 66 Yulgokchõnsõ sübyu, 4:8bl0-l4b3.

Two critical points are brought to the fore- front of the future countermeasure; either waiting until the situations stabilized or dispatch- ing envoys against all odds.70 Yi I comprehended the kernel of the aforementioned question section. What was con- firmed in his answer was the premise that Confucian hierarchy, timeless order in essence, strings together the internal order of Chosön and the stability of the Sino-centric world system. Yi set the tone of his writing in tune with the intransigent and doctrinal view of the Sarim opinion, and cast foreign policy, including the Ming-Chosön comradeship, into the orthodox Cheng-Zhuist barometer.71 The relationship between imperial China and its neighbors in East Asia was equivalent to the unchanging role of ruler and subject, integral to timeless order , in itself and was associated with the right- and-wrong (tÜ#) issue in its own right; in principle, the missionary trip should in no manner be swayed by any situational calculation sailing along difficulty and interest.72 Yi demarcated the solidarity between Ming and Chosön in opposition to their previous dynasties. Liao and Yuan under the 'barbarian' Khitan and Mongolian courts were put aside. Simultaneously, Yi did not much credit the posture of the previous Korean states by dint of their conditional motif to borrow or appropriate the power of imperial China only in time of need.73 On the contrary, the presence of Ming on the continent signified the congruity be- tween the presence of a supreme Han Chinese empire and the center of Confucian civiliza- tion within the Sino-centric world system. The politico-cultural prowess of Ming, termed as Great Ming Central Court or Imperial Court symbolized the mani- festation of timeless order drawing the line between civilization and barbarism in East Asia. The unswerving righteousness and sincerity of Chosön for Ming could not be juxtaposed with the pre-Chosön dynasties at the same level.74 For the purpose of completing its missionary tasks, Yi did not neglect the significance of the most suitable figures for the mission.75 They had to be equipped with the practical capa- moved down to the environs of Peking in 1550.

They were also to be armed with the Confucian enfants perdus spirit to go to Ming irrespective of hardship and adversity. If not, Chosön would be left in a diplomatic quandary of gaining litde more than a hollow reputation for camaraderie and missing substantial outcome.76 As a representative Sarim leader, expectedly, his argument for the unconditional partnership with Ming was littered with such typical Cheng-Zhuist jargons as timeless order , righteousness, sincerity, and right &amp; wrong. What is important is the coherent connecting of human agency, domestic order, practical execution of diplomacy, and the earthly manifestation of the Principle in Confucian terms. However, Yi's seemingly rigorous Sarim attachment to an unfaltering fidelity to Ming did by no means belie the pragmatic treatment of Ming matter in terms of realpolitik , which takes another core part in answering the regal request. The civilizational commonality be- tween Ming and Chosõn never overshadowed the specificity and individuality of Chosön. He was confident of the high standard of Confucian civilization which the land of Chosõn possessed through history. It had been approximating the Confucian civilization of China owing to the teaching of Kija in ancient times while maintaining a distinctive realm as com- pared to China.77 According to Yi, the history of Chosön displayed two different layers of identity. The first pertained to the cultural compatibility with imperial China within the larger spectrum of Confucian civilization, while the second concerned the geographically and politically separate entity in the Sino-centric world system.78 With the independence of Chosön intact, Yi tried to manage the harsh situation of the continent in an objectively rational fashion. Talking about the situational calculation regard- ing the foil of Ming was not completely placed under a taboo.79 He prepared for the potential collapse of Ming which was, as described in the first half of the policy treatise, being shaken gradually by force of the Mongolian and Japanese despoilments. While urging the king to keep his unwavering respect for Ming, he calmly commented that the disorder of Ming was anything but under Chosön's control.80 At any moment, the missionaries could be precipi- tated into deadly circumstances.81 Still, the above statement on the realistic irrelevancy of Chosön to an effete Ming came to terms with Confucian idioms.

The northern overland route may be impos- sible to pass and the southern ocean route can be inaccessible as well.83 Escape from these situations depends on heavenly providence. Besides, the heavenly providence is joined with another Cheng-Zhu jargon, which depends on human agent (ÍB#), specifically referring here to the king s will and effort, attainable via righteousness and sincerity.84 Taken together, Yi's articulation on the universality of li came to unfold a composite yet integrative whole that dealt with such crucial epistemological questions as knowledge, per- spective, practice, and substance. In the process, Yi also addressed such practical matters as geopolitics, social order, realpolitik , and identity on the Confucian channels of Pax Sinica in East Asia, Pax Sa in Chosön, and a modus operandi of Confucian civilization beyond the Middle Kingdom (4*13). We should not dismiss that delving into the universality of fi, paradoxical as it may sound, sparked a self-referential perspective available for the Sarim elites in the sixteenth-century Choson, and created conditions for furthering the self-reliant dis- course on a politico-cultural community of Choson in East Asia. Far from any static tone of self-cultivation or Sinophile pastime, Yi s reformulation of Cheng-Zhu Learning begot an interpretive flexibility able to couch Confucianism in Sarim terms and endorse the estab- lishment of Chosön under Sa hegemony. To take hold of episteme and phronesis in the Cheng-Zhuist interpretation of the universal Ii was to fashion a pattern in which a Chosön- focused discourse came into prominence. Concluding Remarks A considerable number of English-language studies on Choson Confucianism "have at- tempted to understand the Choson period through Confucianism, others have attempted to address the question of Korean modernity, and yet others have sought a way to approach the study of pre-modern East Asia."85 The thematic focus of this article is on the 'use of Confu- cianism' by which means Yi I reinscribed the fundamental issues of intellect, perspective, practice, civilization, order, diversity, and unity from his own perspective. This theoretical command marked a practice-driven and user-friendly form of Confucianism and made a self- referential point of Choson Confucianism, more efficient in resolving such practical issues as national defense, social order, and central politics. 82 Ibid., 4:14a3-8. 83 Ibid., 4:l4a6-8. 84 Ibid., 4:14a4-6. 85 Yi Chöngch ol, "Introduction," in The Institutional Basis of Civil Governance , p. 1 0.</page><page sequence="20">56 Joseph Jeong-il Lee And, in the period of Chosön mainly from the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries, various Khanates of Mongolian and other Inner Asian stocks took substantial part in shaping the topology of Eurasian history that covered from Manchuria to northern China, including Peking, to Inner Asia to northern India to southern Russia up to Eastern Europe.86 The continental dynamics exhibited a great extent of historical interaction between pastoralist forces, spearheaded by Mongols and other Inner Asian nomads, and sedentary, usually agrar- ian, societies in Eurasia.87 For the Ming court, the Mongols remained as the most dangerous neighbor to be subjugated in the sixteenth century.88 Chosön championed a self-sufficient agricultural polity and promoted Confucian civilization as the basis of its cultural policy. It also had a close diplomatic and military relationship with Ming, regarded then as the super- power of East Asia and the center of universal civilization in the region. At the same time, the nomadic powers, coming from the Mongols, Khitans and Jurchens, were thought of as the potent contingents in the geopolitics of Chosön whose defense line was largely concentrated along northern borders to the end of the late sixteenth century. The Confucian debates among the Chosön elites in the period were not merely speculative or academic, but, as in the case of Yi I, involved discursive practice designed to meet the changing circumstances of the time, especially the sway of the Eurasian, or continental paradigm. Last, Yi's scholarship had an immense impact on the contemporary Sarim colleagues, specifically those who were in a position to handle statecraft in central government. Yi Is articulation on the universal li epitomized the collective and general endeavor of the Sarim 86 Details in Nicola Di Cosmo, Allen J. Frank, and Peter B.
