<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Revolving Bookstand ,,,,,,,,,,, The Dismemberment of Orpheus Reflections on Modern Culture, Language and Literature IHAB HASSAN If confusion is the sign of the times, I see at the root of this confusion a rupture between things and words, between things and the ideas and signs that are their representation. - Antonin Artaud Modern literature is the enormous dream of men haunted by the mortality of their gods. But in dreams, the poet said, begin responsibilities. The enormity of modern literature springs from the soul of men, and moves in the very life of their culture. With this knowledge begin all responsibilities. Yet most of us look upon the mangled fig- ures who possess the literary imagination of our time as if they were an alien breed. Even madmen know better than thus to elude their fate. Antonin Artaud was at times mad, and he saw the point with piti- less clarity: "What is most important ... is not so much to defend a culture whose ex- istence has never kept man from going hun- gry [he was not thinking of our bellies], as to extract, from what is called culture, ideas whose compelling force is identical with that of hunger." My general purpose in this essay is to re- flect on a strain of modern literature which, in its agonistic relation to culture, endeav- ors to extract from it the force of hunger, Ðž Born in Cairo, Egypt, IHAB HASSAN came to the United States in 1946 and is now an American citizen. A professor of English at Wesleyan University, he has written extensively on modern literature and is the author of Radical Innocence: The Contemporary Ameri- can Novel. He is currently, on his second Gug- genheim Fellowship, writing a book on litera- ture and disorder. the force of desire. My specific aim will be to comment on the strategy of that litera- ture in its labor to derive life from enforced deprivation. The strategy, it will be seen, leads literature from radical distortions of form to a parody of self-repudiation, and from the latter to a verbal equivalent of silence. Modern literature protests against the idea of culture; the ultimate protest of language is silence; the literature of silence entertains wordlessness for its future. This is the stark outline. The outline is stark and the statements excessive; our road may not lead to Blake's palace of wisdom. Yet excess is not the only risk we run. In a particular sense, the liter- ature of silence is not simply extreme; it is also subversive. For without language, his- tory and society cease to exist, and civiliza- tion reverts to aboriginal darkness. Accord- ing to the Gospel, in the Beginning was the Word, and human life became possible when the Word was made Flesh. Is the human race, then, which has come such a long and terrible way through the passages of prehistory, to be now turned back by some erratic dream? Quite to the contrary. Modern literature may be extreme and its dreams outrageous. But it is conceived in the interests of life, which always progress through contradictions. Two major trends, working now in uneasy unison and now in exuberant opposition, testify to this fact. 463</page><page sequence="2">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR The first trend reveals a growing disaffec- tion with modern civilization, a profound grumbling which expresses itself, rather su- perficially, in adolescent violence, hipster anarchy and Oriental mysticism. The sec- ond trend, intimately related to the first, reveals a growing distrust of language as a medium of expression, and a distrust of form, which has impelled certain modern writers to cultivate chance and disorder as legitimate elements of the artistic process, or to evolve patterns of non-sense that may be called antiform. The distrust of language reflects a more radical distrust of reason, history and social organization. At bottom, the revolt is directed against those insepara- ble twins: Authority and Abstraction. For authority in social life and abstraction in language are corollaries: they are com- mandments issued to the flesh, coercing pri- vate experience into objective order. The two trends, we see, are aspects of the same quenchless feud. What is that feud? Here I revert to the parable of my title. It is the death of Orpheus, first among sing- ers, that provides a focus to the story. There are, of course, many versions of the story, although all are equally gory. Orpheus is killed by the Maenads at the behest of Di- onysus or, in Ovid's version, in a fit of un- controllable jealousy; for since the death of his wife, Eurydice, Orpheus had preferred the company of young men to women. One thing is clear: Orpheus, the supreme maker, was the victim of an inexorable clash be- tween the Dionysian principle, represented by the frenzied Maenads, and the Apollo- nian ideal which he, as a poet, venerated. We do not really need a motive or excuse for the murder. The maker of songs of- fended the primal forces of life; he is over- whelmed by them. Ovid describes the scene thus: Mad fury reigned, and even so, all weapons Would have been softened by the singer's music, But there was other orchestration: flutes Shrilling, and trumpets braying loud, and drums, Beating of breasts, and howling, so the lyre Was overcome, and then at last the stones Reddened with blood, the blood of the singer, heard No more through all that outcry. Orpheus pays for his "crime" against Dio- nysus with dismemberment. But the act of dismemberment is also a crime against Apollo, patron of culture, that demands both retribution and restitution. The Mae- nads cannot wash their bloody hands in the river Helicon which dives in horror into the ground; in one account, they are turned into twisted trees. This is retribution. And the head of Orpheus continues to sing, and where his limbs are buried by the Muses, the nightingales sing sweeter than any- where else in the world. This is restitution. Retribution and restitution; meanwhile, the primordial conflict continues unresolved. I take the myth of Orpheus to be a para- ble of the artist in our time. The powers of Dionysus, which our civilization has so harshly repressed, threaten to erupt with a vengeance. In the process, energy may over- whelm order; language may turn into a howl, a cackle, a terrible silence; form may be mangled as ruthlessly as the poor body of Orpheus was. And yet the haunting ques- tion remains, now as on that wild day in the hills of Thrace: must not the head of the poet be severed in order that he may continue to sing? Let me put the question even more bluntly: is it not necessary that life overwhelm art periodically to insure the health, the prevalence, of man? I should like to suggest that an affirmative answer to this question is perhaps more needful at this time than a negative one; and I should also like to propose that we are witnessing in modern literature a movement toward disorder, an attack on form, intended to re- cover a kind of human innocence. Here I end my parable and end my preamble. We can move closer to the subject by more spe- cific cultural, historical and literary analy- sis. The voice of common sense cannot be stilled; it leads to an overwhelming ques- tion. Why should the disaffection with civi- lization, in our age, be so acute as to drive literature to such extreme measures? The implication is always that intellectuals are baroque worriers, addicted to a pessimism which they impose on their age. Possibly so, although one suspects that our asylums and penitentiaries are full of men who did not 464</page><page sequence="3">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR worry enough. The question, however, still stands, and until a black Syntopicon of our maladies is compiled, we can only answer it obliquely. Let us begin with a few scat- tered and unlikely names. What drove Henry Miller to take as his motto the in- scription: "When I hear the word Culture, I reach for my revolver?" What prompts Nikolai Berdyaev to say, in The Fate of Man in the Modern World, "What is tak- ing place in the world to-day is not a crisis of humanism . . . , but the crisis of human- ity"? And what leads Robert Ardrey, con- templating the fate of man among ancient fossils and murderous bones, to conclude thus his African Genesis: "Man is neither unique nor central nor necessarily here to stay. . . . The power of conscience, blind, anti-rational, and acting in alliance with the weapons fixation, will be the responsi- ble force if self-annihilation be the human outcome"? Such statements, like grapeshot, penetrate the flesh in many places. The malady of man is antique; it is compounded by the malady of culture; both may be working toward an unholy climax. Grapeshot scatters widely. Freud, how- ever, probes the mind with a dagger. In Civilization and Its Discontents, Freud shows that society rests on instinctual re- pression. This much we all know. What we do not always realize is that every act of re- nunciation in our lives prepares the way for further renunciations. The matter does not end there. Freud goes on to argue that civilization, in its innermost dynamic, re- quires more and more repression. The psy- chic toll of this process is compounded. The implications of this process for literature are crucial. In a shocking and important book, Life Against Death, Nor- man O. Brown begins where Freud ends. Arguing that all sublimation entails a cer- tain degree of negation of the life instincts, Brown concludes thus: "The negative mo- ment in sublimation is plain in the insepa- rable connection between symbolism (in language, science, religion, and art) and abstraction. Abstraction, as Whitehead has taught us, is a denial of the living organ of experience, the living body as a whole. . . ." The logic then - and I do not know if it is quite as relentless as both Brown and Freud make it out to be - is that repression begets civilization, civilization begets more repres- sion, more repression begets abstraction, and abstraction begets death. We are mov- ing along the road of pure intelligence which, as Ferenczi thought, is a principle of madness. Is any salvation for the race possible? Brown offers this: The human ego must face the Dionysian reality, and therefore a great work of self-trans- formation lies ahead of it. For Nietzsche was right in saying that the Apollonian preserves, the Dionysian destroys, self-consciousness. As long as the structure of the ego is Apollonian, Dionysian experience can only be bought at the price of ego-dissolution. Nor can the issue be resolved by a "synthesis" of the Apollonian and the Dionysian ego. Hence the late Nietzsche preaches Dionysus The work of construct- ing a Dionysian ego is immense; but there are signs that it is already under way. If we can dis- cern the Dionysian witches' brew in the up- heavals of modern history - in the sexology of de Sade and the politics of Hitler - we can also discern in the romantic reaction the entry of Dionysus into consciousness. For the neo-Freudians, then, the problem is repression, abstraction, and the solution is the construction of a Dionysian ego. In their view, language ultimately becomes "the natural speech of the body," a phrase adopted from Rilke. But the fact that Brown cites Nietzsche is also relevant; for Nietzsche is indeed the crucial figure in the intellectual history of our time. He is the ancestor of both Freud- ians and Existentialists, and he is the living mediator between the two movements. Nietzsche's analysis of Western civilization offers, therefore, a parallel argument to Freud's, and one that is perhaps even more compelling. For Nietzsche, the root of evil in the modern world is not simply repres- sion, which is wholly instinctual, but also nihilism, which acknowledges the conscious human drive to meaning. From the depths of the nineteenth century he proclaimed God dead, and he saw that the crisis of modern man was a crisis of values. "Why has the advent of nihilism become neces- sary?" Nietzsche asks in The Will to Power. 466</page><page sequence="4">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR And he answers: "because nihilism repre- sents the ultimate logical conclusion of our great values and ideals - because we must experience nihilism before we can find out what values these 'values' really had. We require, at some time, new values." For him, as for contemporary Existentialists, the fundamental problem is obviously one of meaning. Unlike most of them, however, Nietzsche was a Utopian. His solution rested on the affluence of life in the Superman. In that Nietzschean view, the ideal of language becomes action, becomes gesture, since the creation of meaning is less a verbal than a vital process. Obviously, then, the prophecies of Uto- pians, whether Freudian or Existentialist, minimize the role of sublimation, and therefore of language. The human Diony- sus or the Superman of the future is simply not a loquacious creature. The future, how- ever, is a long way off, and the business of men is neither to rush history nor to end it but simply to participate in it. Literature always calls our attention to the present in which we participate. It is, therefore, the response of literature to our age, an age of unusual negation, that must engage our im- mediate attention. What is the response of literature to the culture of abstraction and repression? Let me cite three modern authors who are as different in age and background as possi- ble: Thomas Mann, Albert Camus and Norman Mailer. Their common theme is danger, the danger to human life, the even graver danger to art. In two of his master- pieces, Death in Venice and Doctor Faustus, Mann portrays an artist-hero who trifles, at his peril, with total depravity. Like Or- pheus, poor Aeschenbach is destroyed by the passions he had long neglected. Yet his head sings on with the voice of Mann him- self. The voice is one of consummate irony, rising only to cancel itself in that self-par- ody which Mann, in his later years, be- lieved to be the only hope of art. The knowledge of Leverkuhn is even more de- monic; we are not surprised to discover that Doctor Faustus incarnates the theme of art on the verge of its own impossibility. Later still, Mann ventured into the chartless depths of crime. As Erich Heller put it, in The Ironic German: "Art tragically la- ments the loss of its own mystery in Doctor Faustus, and gaily reports it to the cosmic police in Felix Krull." Gaily is the word, a dreadful gaiety. Ultimately, the face of disorder is comic, and the writer who wishes to capture its lineaments finds himself in the position of the notorious Cretan, who by affirming that all Cretans were liars, denied the truth in the process of stating it, or maintained the truth in the process of denying it - no one can tell ex- actly which. This is the silence of self-irony. With Camus, self -irony raises the question of ontological doubt. In Resistance, Rebel- lion and Death Camus says, "The hatred of art, of which our society provides such fine examples, is so effective today because it is kept alive by artists themselves. The doubt felt by the artists who preceded us con- cerned their own talent. The doubt felt by artists of today concerns the necessity of their art, hence their very existence." What is the nature of this doubt that ravages the artist and subverts his art? In the same essay Camus states: "To create today is to create dangerously. Any publication is an act, and that act exposes one to the passions of an age that forgives nothing The question, for all those who cannot live without art and what it signifies, is merely to find out how, among the police forces of so many ideologies . . . the strange liberty of creation is possible." The phrase "police forces of so many ideologies" subsumes all the repres- sive forms that the human intelligence has evolved in our time. The primary aim of these police forces is to exercise their con- trol, in depth, on the instinctual impulses of man, and in breadth, on the existential freedom of his actions. Apollonian Form finally becomes Abstract Authority. We should not be surprised, therefore, to dis- cover that the doubt of the artist to which Camus refers is the doubt concerning his very being, his identity not merely as a maker but also as a man. The reaction to this ontological doubt, I have already hinted, is twofold: the man rebels, and the artist plays at repudiating his art. The close connection between these two aspects of re- 468</page><page sequence="5">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR volt - what the New Critics, may they rest in peace, call the biographical fallacy - is demonstrated by Norman Mailer. In "The White Negro" Mailer describes the "hip- ster" as "the man who knows that if our collective condition is to live with the in- stant death by atomic war, relatively quick death by the State ... or with a slow death by conformity . . . why then the only life- giving answer is to accept the terms of death, to live with death as immediate danger, to divorce oneself from society, to exist without roots, to set out on that un- charted journey into the rebellious impera- tives of the self. In short, whether the life is criminal or not, the decision is to encour- age the psychopath in oneself, to explore that domain of experience where security is boredom and therefore sickness, and one exists in the present " Creating danger- ously as an artist, the writer must also live dangerously as a man. For art, the risk is total self-repudiation; for man, it is self- annihilation. The crisis of culture as of literature is evident. Literature, in our time, confronts the abstract and chilling gaze of Apollo, a deity closer to the Newton of Blake than to the gods of the Greeks, and closer still to the image of Dostoevski's Grand Inquisitor. Literature confronts Authority, and with- ers. Should it recoil too far back into the Dionysian sources of energy, should it avoid all abstraction and escape all sublimation, it will have expunged the motive for its be- ing. For the Dionysian personality does not choose to live vicariously. Nor is it the kind of personality to escape abuse. We have lived to see the demented hope of Mari- netti's Futurism consummated by Hitler. "Come then, seize the pickaxes and ham- mers! Sap the foundations of the venerable cities. We stand upon the extreme promon- tories of the centuries . . . ," Marinetti cried, and one visualizes the sullen face of Mars rising without promise of regeneration. Di- onysus does not prophesy war. What he may prophesy is the complete wedding of Art and Life, by magic if nothing else. Per- haps this is what Pursewarden, the writer in Durrell's Alexandria Quartet, meant when he said, "The object of writing is to grow a personality which in the end enables man to transcend art." But the end is not near. We are all still very much in need of art. The best we can do, as Mailer declared, is to accept the terms of uncertainty, even of death, which are a part of our condition. This has been the strategy of literature in our time. It is a temporary strategy; it may even be temporizing. Literature recoils from the withering authority of the new Apollo; but it does not surrender itself wholly to the frenzy of Dionysus. It only feigns to do so. It employs self-irony and self-parody, as in the novels of Mann and Camus; it de- velops, as in the works of Beckett or Genet, forms that are antiforms; it cultivates a new literalism, as in the novels of Nathalie Sarraute or Robbe-Grillet; it evolves the poetic surrealism of John Hawkes and James Purdy or the coilage improvisations of William Burroughs; and it sometimes entertains a chatty silence as the later work of Salinger does. Literature, in short, pre- tends to a wordy wordlessness and partici- pates in the Dionysian denial of language not with its own flesh but with the irony of its divided intelligence. So much for the heady response of litera- ture to modern culture. Language aspires to silence and form moves toward anti- form. Still, we may find some reassurance in the recognition that the modern phe- nomenon of antiform has a long and honor- able history, and that it is not, therefore, a monstrous child of the moment. Its ante- cedent may be called the "open form," which is aptly defined by Robert Martin Adams, in Strains of Discord, as a structure of meanings that "include a major unre- solved conflict with the intent of displaying its unresolvedness." An earnest evolutionist may go so far as to claim that just as litera- ture seems to have developed from the mythical to the ironic modes, so do literary forms seem to develop from closed to open forms, and from open forms to antiforms. The distinction between closed and open forms is immediately apparent when we contrast two plays, Sophocles' Oedipus the King and Euripides' Bacchae. Adams is right in perceiving that while Oedipus manages to resolve its conflicts and to in- 47Â°</page><page sequence="6">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR duce a state of partial repose in the audi- ence, The Bacchae refuses to resolve its tensions and leaves its audience in a state of unreleased anguish. As a closed form, Oedipus expresses a conservative and re- ligious view of the world, and a collective sense of experience; as an open form, The Bacchae conveys a radical and skeptical view of the world, and an individual sense of experience. By extrapolating boldly on this curve, we can say that as an antiform, Beckett's Waiting for Godot implies an ironic and nihilistic view of the world, and a dream-like sense of experience that is en- tirely private. But we need not adhere to a strict the- ory of literary evolution in order to realize that between The Bacchae and Waiting for Godot a great number of works in Western literature have revealed a growing sense of disruption, an increasing capacity for distortion. Consider, in drama alone, the sequence suggested by the following plays: Shakespeare's Hamlet, Goethe's Faust, BÃ¼chner's Woyzeck, Kleist's Prinz Von Homburg, Maeterlinck's Blue Bird, Ibsen's Ghosts, Strindberg's A Dream Play, Jarry's Ubu Roi, Pirandello's Six Charac- ters in Search of An Author, Brecht's Man's Man, Genet's The Blacks and Ionesco's The Killer. Dramatic form seems to move from unresolved tensions to symbolic elu- siveness, from the latter to surreal or ex- pressionistic contortion, and finally comes to rest in absurdity. I limit myself to drama simply to maintain the purity of the illus- tration. But the movement of form toward antiform, despite large and irrefutable ex- ceptions throughout history, can be ob- served in Western art generally. It is probably fair to say that the three major phases of that development were marked by the emergence of Mannerism, Romanticism and Modernism. Mannerism was the formal dissolution of the Renais- sance Style. It was, as Wylie Sypher suggests in Four Stages of Renaissance Style, a sign of strain and irresolution. In Mannerist art, "the psychological effect diverges from the structural logic." Here is Sypher's defini- tion of what we mean by an open form: Behind the technical ingenuities of mannerist style there usually is a personal unrest, a com- plex psychology that agitates the form and the phrase. When we examine the strains within the mannerist structure in painting, architec- ture, and poetry, we inevitably become aware of the scourge - or the quicksand - within the mannerist temperament. Mannerism is experi- ment with the techniques of disproportion and disturbed balance; with zigzag, spiral shuttling motion; with space like a vortex or alley; with oblique or mobile points of view and strange - even abnormal - perspectives that yield approx- imations rather than certainties. Is not this precisely the feeling we have about Shakespeare's later plays, Jacobean drama and Metaphysical poetry, as well as the paintings of Titian, Tintoretto and El Greco? The Romantics, of course, went further toward unsettling literary forms, haunted as they were by that vague Stimmung, the craving for the infinite. Faust stands at the very threshold of the period, an amalgam of pagan and Christian influences which it transmuted, both in structure and theme, into a plea for life's outrageous contradic- tions - only the dazzling genius of Goethe could keep such a drama in artistic control. The dark company of Romantic heroes - Faust, Endymion, Alastor, Don Juan, Ju- lien Sorel, Manfred, Axel - were forever threatening to break out from the mold that contained them, in proud insurrection against their makers. The Self had erupted in literature, and so had the dream and the unconscious. Novalis and Nerval, Hoff- mann and Poe, Kleist and BÃ¼chner, Cole- ridge and Keats carried language into the midnight terrain of the soul, or else they cultivated that notorious romantic irony which served to incorporate in every state- ment its own negative. At other times, Ro- manticism denied itself the possibilities of harmony or resolution by the perversity of its own spirit. It explored sadism, demon- ism, cabalism, necrophily, vampirism, and lycanthropy, reaching for a definition of man where no human definition could ob- tain. It is no wonder that Goethe thought Romanticism to be a form of disease, and Hugo identified it with the grotesque. I am aware, of course, that I am emphasizing the nocturnal impulse of the movement. But 472</page><page sequence="7">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR that was precisely the impulse from which a large part of modern literature derived its energy. It was also the impulse, the agony if you wish, which helped to destroy the classic forms of literature. Mario Praz, in The Romantic Agony, says, "The essence of Romanticism comes to consist in that which cannot be described The Roman- tic exalts the artist who does not give a material form to his dreams - the poet ec- static in front of a forever blank page, the musician who listens to the prodigious con- certs of his soul without attempting to translate them into notes. It is romantic to consider concrete expression as a decadence, a contamination." Here, then, is the begin- ning of silence, a literature without words -or to be more precise, a literature that disdains all but the most primitive and magical use of language. The French Sym- bolists, who are, of course, the direct an- cestors of the modern movement, exemplify this trend clearly. MallarmÃ©'s sonnets de- vised the syntax of self-abolition; Rim- baud's Illuminations scrambled the deno- tation of language in an effort to derange the senses; and LautrÃ©amonÅ¥s Maldoror opened the way for surrealism. It may well be, as Brown claims, that in Romanticism Dionysus reentered the consciousness of literature. It is more certain that in Ro- manticism the dual retreat from language became evident: first, in the ironic and self- effacing manner of MallarmÃ©, and, second, in the indiscriminate and surrealistic man- ner of Rimbaud. In one, language aspires to Nothing; in the other it aspires to All. Both are manners of silence, formal disrup- tions of the relation between language and reality. It is these two modes, compounded in strange ratios, that account for the de- velopment of antiform in modern literature from Kafka to Beckett. With Modernism, organized chaos reigns; or as Yeats put it, "the center cannot hold; / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, / The blood-dimmed tide is loosed " It is impossible to convey in a few pages the extent of disintegration and reintegration in the major works of our century. In Ger- man literature, the frightening indetermi- nacy of Kafka's works and, in English liter- ature, the over-determinacy of Joyce's later novels seem to carry the scourge in the lan- guage of MallarmÃ© and Rimbaud into the twentieth century. I do not wish to claim that MallarmÃ© influenced Kafka, or Rim- baud influenced Joyce, although they may well have done so in the mysterious ways of the creative process. I wish to suggest that the forms of Kafka, like those of MallarmÃ©, move toward a kind of semantic absence, a total ambiguity; and that the forms of Joyce, like those of Rimbaud, reach for a semantic fullness, a kind of total statement. There is an effort, in the first, to dissolve reality, and, in the second, to reconstruct the whole of it. (In this respect, Beckett is far closer to Kafka than he is to his former employer, Joyce.) Meantime, French litera- ture was steering crazily between these two modes of antiform, veering now toward the one and now toward the other as it rushed through Dadaism, Surrealism, Existential- ism, and, most recently, the New Literal- ism, or Roman Concret, of Butor, Sarraute, Mauriac and Robbe-Grillet. It is, of course, hopeless to discriminate adequately be- tween all these movements in an article of this scope; our survey must remain a blitz through the literary history of four centu- ries. I do not think, however, that this survey will have been totally vain if we recognize that the impulse first to distort, then to in- hibit, language is a matter of long standing. It defines a strain - a single strain, to be sure, but a significant one - in Western litera- ture. This strain is now confirmed by a re- newed urge to withdraw from the word. Ironically, this urge has been sanctioned not by poetry but science, not by Dionysus but Apollo, not in the interests of the flesh but in the interests of abstraction. In an important article entitled "The Retreat from the Word," George Steiner clarifies the point. He writes: . . . until the seventeenth century, the sphere of language encompassed nearly the whole of ex- perience and reality; today, it comprises a nar- rower domain. It no longer articulates, or is relevant to, all major modes of action, thought, and sensibility. Large areas of meaning and praxis now belong to such non-verbal languages 474</page><page sequence="8">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR as mathematics, symbolic logic, and formulas of chemical or electronic relation. Other areas be- long to the sub-languages or anti-languages of non-objective art and musique concrete. The world of words has shrunk. This, of course, is largely true. The modern ideologies of men as diverse as Marx, Freud and Wittgenstein have all helped to dimin- ish the powers of language to encompass reality. But Mr. Steiner, I fear, is an Apol- lonian himself, albeit one of the classical, anthropomorphic rather than the modern, dehumanized variety. He deplores the state of language in literate society, and thus concludes: "that civilization on which Apollo looks no more shall not long en- dure." It is my feeling, in this strident era of over-communication, that we are more likely to perish by the word than by the sword, and least of all to perish by a loving silence. But I do not wish to press the point very hard; contemporary literature, far from abdicating its role as a shaper of hu- man consciousness, has accepted the chal- lenge of the enemy. It has, that is, embraced the retreat from the word in order to renew the life of the culture that nourishes it. This development is so recent that it does not yet carry the authority of a major writer. Perhaps its clearest reflection is in that remarkable international movement called the Theatre of the Absurd which in- cludes under one jaunty rubric the works of Beckett, Artaud, Genet, Adamov, Ionesco, Arrabal, Pinter, Gelber and Albee. No mat- ter what we may think of it as an art form - and I think a good deal of it - we must recognize that the movement expresses, in- directly, nothing less than the desire to re- deem Western values. Although the move- ment may not resurrect Dionysus on the stage before our astonished eyes, Martin Esslin is right when he says, "it is in this striving to communicate a basic and as yet undissolved totality of perception, and in- tuition of being, that we can find a key to the devaluation and disintegration of lan- guage in the Theatre of the Absurd." Let me end with literary examples some- what more detailed than any we have viewed so far, and also closer to our situa- tion in America. In reviewing the current literary scene, it becomes quickly obvious that the attack on form and the retreat from language take on a peculiar hue in America. The hue is essentially comic, and it colors the genres of drama, poetry and fiction. I shall focus mainly on the last. The new comic spirit in American litera- ture attends a special awareness of reality, a new sense of error and incongruity. It unites horror and slapstick, realism and surrealism, in the most antic manner. Writ- ers nowadays seem anxious to respond to the incoherence of life, to its openness and absurdity. They are relearning the old art of improvisation; they are cultivating the picaresque and the fantastic modes. Know- ing how outrageous facts can be, they do not pretend to subdue the intractable stuff of reality with a Jamesian flourish or a mythical symbol. Random operations and radical distortions are accepted in litera- ture not simply as a source of humor but also as a critique of social goals and tradi- tions. Chance, which defies the rigid pre- dictability of contemporary life, restores a measure of individual freedom; and distor- tion defies the habitual response to the world we live in. This is sometimes carried so far as to reveal an anarchic impulse masked in tomfoolery. The clownish ele- ment can be sensed in the theatre of Albee and Gelber, the poetry of Corso and Fer- linghetti, the fiction of Kerouac and Bur- roughs. But it is by no means confined to efforts of the Beats or their associates; it is equally present in such works as Thomas Berger's Reinhart in Love, Joseph Heller's Catch-22, J. P. Donleavy's The Ginger Man, John Hawkes's The Cannibal, Saul Bellow's Henderson the Rain King or James Purdy's Malcolm. The new comedy, which combines boisterousness and bitter- ness, is really an attempt to restore sanity through madness or buffoonery. Above all, the new comedy seeks to preserve the health of the community through a qualified toler- ance of disorder. Might not the dismember- ment of Orpheus prove, after all, to be a comic event? The connection between the new comedy and new antiforms can be illustrated by three recent works of fiction: Hawkes's The 476</page><page sequence="9">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR Cannibal, Salinger's Seymour: An Introduc- tion, and Burroughs's Naked Lunch. I have chosen these works because they all possess a certain originality that is not very widely or wisely recognized, and because, different as they are, each represents a par- ticular manner of tampering with form. Furthermore, I consider them all to be comic and surrealistic works: comic, in my sense of the word, because they acknowl- edge the open, indeterminate or absurd ele- ment in human experience, and surrealistic because they tilt and distort the surface of reality in order to express it. John Hawkes is a striking and until quite recently a much neglected writer. He is the author of seven novels and novelettes, of which the best may still be The Canni- bal, one of the deepest books to come out of World War Two. Like D juna Barnes or Flannery O'Connor, Hawkes is a specialist in the gothic and grotesque, and his humor is the grim humor of nightmares. He un- derstands the leering comedy of evil, and has written, "there is no pathetic fun or mournful frolic like our desire. The con- summation of the sparrow's wings." He has also said, "If the true purpose of the novel is to assume a significant shape and to ob- jectify the terrifying similarity between the unconscious desires of the solitary man and the disruptive needs of the visible world, then the satiric writer, running maliciously at the head of the mob and creating the shape of his meaningful psychic paradox as he goes, will serve best the novel's purpose." In The Cannibal, the style of Hawkes moves into the twilight region between the rational and absurd. The images are chilly and monstrous. The characters are always out-of-focus, floating vaguely through a psy- chic continuum which is neither time nor space. The action is frighteningly simple. A German called Zizendorf is intent on kill- ing the one American soldier, Leevey, who patrols on a motorcycle a third of the entire defeated nation. Both men are equally sin- gle-minded and inhuman. There is a town, "shriveled in structure and as decomposed as an oxen's tongue black with ants," and there is an insane asylum on a hill. The in- mates go berserk, and one of them stalks a child through the novel, just as Zizendorf stalks his prey below. At the end, the luna- tic literally devours the child, and Zizen- dorf kills the soldier. All men are cannibals, whether in love or in hate. A cold frenzy permeates the novel which telescopes the events of 1914 and 1945, dispelling the so- lidity of the known world with diabolic ir- relevance and implacable poetry. And yet the book remains a tangled parable, hard, ruthless and comic, of the modern world. Its form crystallizes all those distortions prefigured in the flux of man's earliest and blackest recollections. And its language re- verts to the syntax of dream or delirium, a crafty mirror of decomposed consciousness. The act of decomposition is far more whimsical in the work of Salinger. Zooey, Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction present a curious difficulty to the unwary critic. Many feel that the embarrassing manner- isms of these stories - their garrulousness, convolutions, private jokes and sly asides - betray the fumbling efforts of Salinger to render an experience he has not yet man- aged to master. I am not of that opinion; I consider the style of these novelettes to be an approximation of comic sur-realism, mo- tivated by a sacramental notion of silence. Let me explain. In his earlier work, the dramatic gestures of Salinger's fiction were defined by the poles of love and of squalor. When the gestures aspired to love, or to pure religious expression, language reached into silence. When the gestures revealed their purely squalid or satiric content, lan- guage moved toward sentimentality. In re- cent years, Salinger has been far more con- cerned with love than with squalor, and both the language and the antiforms of his stories have been conditioned by an ideal of holiness. The verbal correlative to holi- ness, in Zen, is often silence. Salinger, how- ever, is an author, not a Zen master. His task in describing Seymour, a "ringding en- lightened man," is to convey in words a life that finds its true consummation in a poetry of silence. The distrust of language is evident in all these later works. In Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters, Buddy Glass, the narra- 478</page><page sequence="10">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR tor, is comforted only by the tiny deaf-mute relative of the bride. Buddy says with dis- gust, "It was a day, God knows, not only of rampant signs and symbols but of wildly extensive communication via the written word." The profanation of language and spirit are ubiquitous - and identical. The climax of the story comes when Buddy con- fesses to the deaf-mute, that is, to unhear- ing ears, the truth about Seymour which he had withheld from all the others. Seymour's own attitude toward language is equally clear in the story: he believes that the Get- tysburg Address should have been one man silently shaking his first at the audience on the occasion of fifty thousand deaths, and he also writes, "the human voice conspires to desecrate every thing on earth." In Zooey, the same revulsion from language is manifest. Buddy says, "The old horror of being a professional writer, and the usual stench of words that goes with it, is begin- ning to drive me out of my seat." A crucial insight he receives while talking to a little girl in a supermarket escapes words en- tirely, and he can only "go through the mo- tions" of writing about it to his brother Zooey. The strange paradox of the stories is that their prolixity seems to undermine, rather than to confirm, the authority of words. This is perhaps most obvious in Seymour: An Introduction. In the two earlier stories, language was brilliantly shattered and dif- fracted: letters, diaries, footnotes, messages scrawled on bathroom mirrors and quota- tions inscribed on beaverboard, telephone conversations and endless dialogue dis- persed the power of the word, tilting and jumbling the modes of speech. The same practice is exaggerated in Seymour. Buddy, who is again the narrator, calls himself "a thesaurus of undetached prefatory re- marks." The epigraphs to the novelette testify to the inability of language to cope with love. In the quotation from Kafka, love prevents language from exercis*- ing its verbal powers, and, in the quotation from Kierkegaard, language simply revolts against the author. But the implication is that a true artist will accept the subversion of language in the name of a richer art. Cultivating, as it were, his radical insuf- ficiency, the writer, like Seymour playing marbles, must try not to aim, must try not to try. This is perhaps just what Salinger, in this loose and baggy monster of a narra- tive, seeks to dramatize. Unpretentious bou- quets of "early-blooming parentheses" are offered to the reader; witty exhortations and knowing allusions to Salinger himself, who masquerades as Buddy, follow. "Oh, you out there - " Buddy cries to the reader, "with your enviable golden silence." The novelette has no conventional structure or climax; the portrait of Seymour turns out to be a whimsical catalogue of hair, eyes, ears or nose. Vignettes follow vignettes al- most haphazardly. Language becomes in- discriminate, random, fluent beyond words. And when illumination finally comes to Buddy - one of only five such experiences in his lifetime - it comes in a purely ac- cidental fashion. Actually, illumination comes to Buddy because he had opened himself to accident. Buddy is happy; he has understood himself as a writer because he has understood, with the help of Seymour, the value of suspending purpose. Could it be that the mannered volubility of the nov- elette is intended to dramatize for us the very same insight: that the happiness of art may lie in the freedom of language to seek some purposeless and indeterminate anti- form? Indeterminacy is carried further in Naked Lunch. This shocking work is some- times considered the underground master- piece of the Beat generation. (In last year's Edinburgh Festival, writers as different as Norman Mailer and Mary McCarthy praised it highly.) It is, of course, impossi- ble to describe Burroughs's book and very hard to judge it; the mind reels under the impact of its outrageous vision, its de- mented language. The ghastly experiences of drug addiction, sexual perversion and political crime lie at its center, and they seem almost beyond the scope of the human imagination, a satirical nightmare which, like the more shattering works of Swift or Hieronymus Bosch, must be dreamt to be believed. In the terrifying metaphor of junk, "the mold of monopoly and posses- 480</page><page sequence="11">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR sion," Burroughs seems to have found an expression for solipsism as well as social an- nihilation. The fiend of narcotics devours everything in the book, devours even the diabolic sexuality that enrages the censors. The "novel" is finally a testament to the insanity of society, the wilfulness of the human spirit and the futility of language, a testament of blood and black laughter. "The title means exactly what the words say," Burroughs writes, "Naked lunch - a frozen moment when everyone sees what is on the end of every fork." But the effect of gallows surrealism de- pends as much on the subject as on the style of the work. The style is unstrung, berserk, splintered. At times, it seems a product of what Burroughs calls "The Cut Up Method" which goes back to the sur- realist antics of Tristan Tzara. Burroughs describes the method thus: Method is simple: Take a page or more or less of your own writing or from any writer liv- ing and or dead. Any written or spoken words. Cut into sections with scissors or switch blade as preferred and rearrange the sections. Looking away. Now write out the result Applications of cut up method are literally unlimited cut out from time limits. Old word lines keep you in old word slots. Cut your way out. Cut paper cut film cut tape. Scissors or switch blade as preferred. Take it to cut city. There is the method, and there the ra- tionale: "cut your way out!" Neumann's theory of games or the random spirit of Zen are equally valid in freeing man from pre- determined forms, from language itself as we have understood it for several millenia of history. Hawkes twists and distorts, reaching for the decomposed consciousness of man; Salinger plays with artistic pur- pose, and begins to rely on the silence of diffuseness and improvisation; Burroughs actually employs a random method of com- position. The purpose of indeterminacy is the same: cutting the way out. Out of what? Out of history, authority, form, abstraction. Into what? This is a matter each man, with luck, may determine alone. The story of man, we must aver on faith, is without an ending. The story of litera- ture is equally endless. We cannot gloat over the dangerous act of Orpheus' dismem- berment. More than ever, we have much to preserve in the human heritage, and much to fear from the madness incarnated in his- tory. Men of virtue cannot opt for disor- der, or choose the terrible darkness of un- consciousness over the light of courage or devotion. Without language, without form, there can be no human cognition, and without cognition of the self as of the world, there can be no light. We should not revel, therefore, as the mindless Maenads did, in the destruction of Orpheus. In his death, we all die a little. And yet is this not also the Christian, indeed the primordial, paradox of experience: that in symbolic death there is renewed life, and in pro- visional destruction there is the promise of creation? As a student of literature, I have de- scribed a trend toward formlessness and toward wordlessness. But in my view, a critic cannot hold back his moral commit- ment; he must also stand forth to testify. I therefore add to my description something more than a statement and less than a pre- scription. I add a plea: that we extend a little of our sympathy to the ordeal of mod- ern literature, that ordeal by dismember- ment which is our very own. We live in an age of organized chaos, and we have more to fear from organization than from chaos. The desire to thaw the frozen patterns of our life, to open the forms of our literature or of our society, is not merely an artistic aspiration; it is a moral necessity. There is so much that we have allowed habits and fears to exclude from our love; the human reach is shrunken. Yet life still beckons with bright surprise. We can but admire the artist - he is the composer, John Cage - who says, "Our intention is to affirm this life, not to bring order out of a chaos nor to suggest improvements in creation, but simply to wake up to the very life we're living, which is so excellent once one gets one's mind and one's desires out of its way and lets it act of its own accord." This is the statement of a man who rejects the tyrannies of art without refusing its exu- berance. The artist in Cage is commensu- rate with the man. Nor will any lesser meas- 482</page><page sequence="12">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR ure do for audiences who expect to benefit from the bounties of art. No great art can survive without great audiences, and no audiences will survive at all without more quickness, more openness. The story is really a very old one. To hear again, to see again, to feel again, and perhaps sometimes to love what is seen or heard or felt - is this not the whisper of silence in modern litera- ture? Is this not why the head of Orpheus sings on, and his sacrifice is finally justified?</page></plain_text>
