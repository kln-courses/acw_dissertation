<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Reassessment of Nabataean Lead Coinage in Light of New Discoveries1 OLIVER D. HOOVER PLATES 27-30 The coinages of the Nabataeans have long been studied, and numerous collections have examples in silver and bronze.2 However, until recently Nabataean lead coins have been extremely rare: a single such coin, formerly in the Shraga Qedar collection, Afilla, was published by Ya'akov Meshorer in 1975 (CI 3 in the catalogue, below),3 and a second (G27), not yet published, was discovered in the excavations at Mezad Rahel (Qasr 'Ein Kharuf) in 1981. 4 Numerous new examples that have appeared on the Israeli antiquities market are now greatly expanding our knowledge of this formerly rare series. The coins, which are reported to have come from a Jordanian source, appeared in two lots in the summer of 2001 and a further three lots in early 2002. Three other examples unrelated to the Jordanian pieces have also come to light on the American coin market. The known lead coins can be divided into twelve typological groups, as follows: CATALOGUE (All coins are illustrated on Plates 27-30, unless marked otherwise) Group A Obv.: Crude head of Athena wearing crested Attic helmet r.

Pichler Collection (now CNG Mailbid Sale 65, Sept. 24, 2003, lot 476). Chronology When only Meshorer's two specimens of the Nabataean lead series were known, they were generally dated to the first century BC, and specifically to the period of the kings Aretas II, Obodas I, Rabbel I and Aretas III (c. 90-62 BC). This dating was supported primarily on the grounds that the Nike reverse type, which does not otherwise feature regularly on Nabataean royal coinage, seemed to connect the lead pieces to the earliest known Nabataean issues, an anepigraphic bronze series (Pl. 30, fig. 1) imitating the gold staters of Alexander the Great depicting the head of Athena wearing a crested Corinthian helmet on the obverse and Nike holding a laurel wreath and a sty lis on the reverse (PI. 30, fig. 2). 10 The bronze imitations are normally attributed to Aretas II, 'although we have no direct proof',11 in part because of the Greek letter A or A that is often located in the reverse left field, apparently representing the initial of the king's name. Alia Kushnir-Stein and Haim Gitler have corroborated Meshorer's attribution of the imitation series through the use of finds at Tel Beer-Sheva and have posited the period 135/4- 104 BC as the beginning of its production.12 There is no compelling reason to doubt the early emission of these coins since heavily circulated examples appear in hoards alongside much better preserved issues of Aretas IV and later kings.13 Several examples are known to have been overstruck on Ptolemaic bronzes, also suggesting an early date, although it is not impossible that the overstriking could have been a late episode.14 However, just because these imitative bronze coins with Nike types were issued at an early period in the history of Nabataean minting, this does not at all prove that the lead Nike types are also early (pace Meshorer). 9 Meshorer et al., Sofaer Collection (n. 5 above). 10 Meshorer, nos 1-2. 11 Meshorer, p. 11. 12 Kushnir-Stein and Gitler, pp. 16-18. 13 The Kadman Museum hoard of 1967 contained worn Athena/Nike types as well as much better preserved coins of Aretas IV, Malichus II and Rabbel II: Meshorer, p. 12. 14 Schmitt-Korte, p. 107, nos 5-6. The undertype of no. 6 is believed to be an issue of Ptolemy II (284-247 BC).</page><page sequence="6">1 1 o OLIVER D. HOOVER The present catalogue contains an apparently unique lead version (Al) of one of these early imitative issues, which, if it were not for the evidence of the royal portraits, might suggest that the Nabataean lead series began at an earlier date than the reign of Obodas III. However, although the graceful figure of Nike with large wings on the reverse of this lead piece is very close to the Nike types of the Athena/Nike bronze coins, the obverse head of Athena lacks many of the stylistic features of the goddess portrayed on the imitative issues. On the latter, Athena is notable for her prominent corkscrew curls (taken directly from the Alexandrine prototype) and her Corinthian helmet, to which a crest is attached by means of a bulb at the top of the helmet (possibly a misinterpretation of the side crest on the helmet of the Alexandrine original).15 The image of Athena on the lead piece is far more crudely executed than on the bronze issues. Not only does she lack her characteristic curls of hair and the bulb attachment for her helmet crest, but she also seems to wear a different type of helmet. Because of these stylistic differences it is likely that the lead coin was not produced at the same time as the bronze series. Instead, it should probably be seen as a later imitation. Since the hoard evidence indicates that the imitative Athena/Nike bronzes continued to circulate into the first century AD there is no way to be certain when it was made. Nor is there any reason why it should not be connected with the general outpouring of Nabataean lead issues that seems to have taken place under Obodas III and Aretas IV (see below). What most scholars involved in the chronological debate have overlooked is the fact that the Nike depicted on the imitative bronze series is very different from her counterpart on the lead pieces other than Al, i.e. on Groups B-F. On the bronze coins, Nike is generally a slim and well-proportioned female figure with a large wing sprouting from each shoulder and a laurel wreath held in her right hand. Despite the somewhat schematic treatment of the wings and the absence of the sty lis, her appearance openly betrays the artistry of the Alexandrine model.16 However, on the lead pieces of Groups B-F, Nike is shorter and stockier, often with only one visible wing. Even when she has two wings they are much smaller than those of Nike on the bronze imitative series. She also carries what appears to be a palm branch (Groups C and D) or a sceptre (Groups E and F) in addition to the standard laurel wreath. The great difference in style makes it quite unlikely that the two series were contemporary. Indeed, the Nike of Groups B-F has a greater stylistic affinity to Nikai found on eastern Roman provincial issues of the first century BC/AD than to those of Hellenistic coinages.17 The erroneous association of the Nike of the bronze imitations with the Nike of lead Groups B-F has also coloured the dating of G27, a royal portrait/charging bull type, and the only Nabataean lead piece with a well-documented archaeological context. This coin was discovered in the course of excavations of the Nabataean fortress at Mezad Rahel. We are very grateful to Tali Erickson-Gini and Donald T. Ariel of the Israel Antiquities Authority for providing the following details of the find prior to the publication of the final report on the small finds:18 'The lead coin under discussion derives from Room 15 of Mezad Rahel, a fort next to the spring of 'En Rahel excavated in 1981 by the Israel Department of Antiquities under the direction of Y.

It measures 16 m x 16 m and contains a central courtyard surrounded by small casemate rooms. The evidence provided by 52 identified coins and other finds indicate that the fort was constructed some time in the 3rd century BCE by the Nabataeans and was abandoned around the end of 2nd century BCE, possibly as a result of the conquest of Gaza by the Hasmonaean king Alexander Jannaeus in the early years of the 1st century BCE, before 95/94.19 Following a hiatus of nearly 100 years the fort was again reoccupied by the Nabataeans until it was destroyed around the beginning of the 2nd century CE by an earthquake. The finds from Room 15 date to the end of the 2nd century BCE. They include early forms of Nabataean painted ware bowls, an alabaster bee hive shaped jar produced in Yemen and used for transporting raw incense resins, fragments of a Rhodian amphora and early Nabataean plain ware jars, an elaborately decorated leather object and 20 identified coins. Unlike the other finds which may only generally be dated, the coins are of a very restricted date. Seventeen are of the Athena/Nike type (now dated by Stein and Gitler to between 129/128 and 104 BCE).20 In addition a bronze of Aradus dating between 135 and 112 BCE (identified by Y. Meshorer) was found.21 No finds dated to the later 1st century CE phase of the fort were found in Room 15, save one intrusive Nabataean coin of the of the jugate busts/double cornucopiae type. It is also worth noting that a second lead coin was found in the room, but it was unfortunately unidentifiable.'22 Although two occupation phases were found throughout the fort, no evidence of the second and latest phase of occupation was found in Room 1 5 other than the one first century AD coin mentioned above. Pottery and small finds discovered in this room date exclusively to the third and second centuries BC.23 Nevertheless, the predominance of Hellenistic material in Room 15 does not clearly prove that G27 should also be dated to the Hellenistic period. If we agree with the assertion that the room was only occupied in the early period the coin could still be a late intrusion associated with the jugate busts/cornucopia coin, which cannot be Hellenistic and must date to the reign of Aretas IV (after AD 17) at the earliest.24 It is impossible to know whether G27 was deposited in connection with the earlier Hellenistic coins or with the Nabataean jugate busts/cornucopia type, although its portrait tends to suggest the latter (see below). The Nabataean Athena/Nike coins are not especially helpful for dating purposes in this context since they are known to have continued to circulate well into the first century AD. One might argue that support for an early first century BC date for the Nabataean lead pieces can be found in the remarkable outburst of lead issues produced by kings and cities of the Near East in the late Hellenistic period. The Hasmonaean priest-king, Alexander Jannaeus produced a lead series some time after 79 BC.25 Lead issues were struck at Damascus by Jannaeus' contemporary, the Seleucid king Demetrius III (97-87 BC), as well as by the city 19 A.

HOOVER of Gaza in 79/8 BC, and an uncertain political entity in the Beqa'a Valley.26 To this list we might also add a lead issue with the types of a Ptolemaic bronze series struck under Cleopatra IV and Ptolemy XI Alexander (107/6-101 BC) or Cleopatra VII (52-29 BC).27 However, while there can be no question that the first century BC saw the production of a variety of lead pieces in the Near East, this is hardly conclusive dating evidence, since lead issues were also struck and used in the region before and after this time. In the second century BC, lead pieces were produced under the Seleucid king Antiochus III, apparently during his Parthian campaign, while lead issues are also attributed to the Ptolemaic king Ptolemy VI Philometor (181/0-145 BC).28 Likewise, from the first to third centuries AD a wide variety of lead pieces were produced in Roman Egypt, two examples of which were said to have been found with the Nabataean lead issues of the Pichler collection.29 In short, all of the evidence that has been offered to support a date for the Nabataean lead series in the first half of the first century BC is circumstantial at best, and is ultimately trumped by Karl Schmitt-Korte's convincing reading of the obverse portrait of B2 as that of Obodas III (30-9 BC).30 Royal portraits Although Meshorer assigned nos. B2 and C13 to the early period of Nabataean minting under Aretas II, Obodas I, Rabbel I and Aretas III (c.90-62 BC), a close examination of the portrait style on these coins and on the new portrait issues of Groups B, C, G, H, I and J makes it difficult to maintain this view. All of these portraits can be linked to images of the later Nabataean kings, Obodas III and Aretas IV. As Schmitt-Korte has already shown, the portraits found on the coins of Group B are remarkably similar to those that appear on the 'mature portrait' series of Obodas III, struck from 14 to 9 BC.31 Both depict a diademed, mature Nabataean ruler with ringlets of hair descending in 'oblique, wavy lines'.32 The manner in which the hair flows down the king's neck, as if escaping the diadem which holds the hair tight on the top of the head, is virtually identical on both the royal bronze coins and on the new lead pieces. However, this exact form of the Nabataean ringlet hairstyle is not worn by any of the earlier kings from Aretas III to Malichus I. In addition to the close physiognomic similarities between the man depicted on the lead coins of Group B and the regular silver and bronze coins of Obodas III, the fact that the Nabataean character n (H) can be read behind the head of B2 and B7 makes it almost certain that the same individual is represented. A common feature of the coins of Obodas III is the frequent presence of the letter n behind the portrait head, which Meshorer took to be 26 Demetrius III: Houghton, 'Seleucid lead issues', pp. 30-1; the lead series attributed to Antiochus VIII by Houghton (ibid., pp. 26-30) is no longer believed to be Seleucid, but rather an issue of an uncertain entity in the Beqa'a Valley - see O.

However, because we believe there to be no direct connection between the anepigraphic imitative bronze coins and the lead issues with Nike types (see above), we do not endorse Schmitt- Korte's view that the portrait of Obodas III on B2 must therefore date the bronzes to his reign. 31 Schmitt-Korte already recognized that the portrait on Meshorer 's Sup. 1 (our B2) was that of Obodas III. 32 For the discussion of the portrait of Obodas III see Meshorer, p. 33.</page><page sequence="9">A REASSESSMENT OF NABATAEAN LEAD COINAGE 1 1 3 the signature of the mint master.33 It is especially notable that the epigraphy and placement of n on B2 and B7 is similar to that of a silver denarius (Meshorer no. 38) produced in year 20 (=10/1 1 BC) of Obodas' reign (PL 30, fig. 3). The poor striking of CI 3, one of the first known Nabataean lead issues, made the identification of the portrait extremely difficult. Meshorer originally ascribed it to Aretas II or III. However, the relative shortness of the hair makes it unlikely that this portrait depicts one of the early Nabataean kings, who habitually wore their hair in long rows of curls. This long hairstyle was so well recognized that it was reproduced by Roman die engravers in order to identify the Nabataean king depicted on denarii (PL 30, fig. 4) struck in 58 BC to commemorate M. Aemilius Scaurus' victory over Aretas III, four years earlier.34 The shorter hairstyle worn by the individual on C13 is very close to that worn by Aretas IV on the 'archaic style' silver issues (PI. 30, fig. 5) from the beginning of his first regnal year (9 BC).35 On the commemorative half shekels, denarii and half denarii issued in 9 BC, and on the lead piece CI 3, the figure wears a diadem and the traditional Nabataean cloak. The letter A placed behind the head on the lead issue may represent a corrupt or overly cursive form of the letter n, which often appears behind the head of Aretas IV in order to identify his portrait.36 This Nabataean character occasionally comes quite close to looking like Greek A on the early silver issues of Aretas IV, as in the case of Meshorer no. 46.37 Thanks to CI 4- 15, new examples of this type in better condition, it is clear that an early portrait of Aretas IV in the 'archaic style' was also depicted on CI 3. Unlike the more common later coins of this king in all metals, where he appears with curls falling down the back of his neck and wearing a laurel wreath, on these lead issues, as well as his commemorative silver of 9 BC, Aretas IV wears a short 'Romanizing' hairstyle and diadem, highly appropriate for an eastern client king recently confirmed in his power by Augustus. The close similarity of the portraits on CI 3- 15 to those of the silver suggest that they were all struck in 9 BC, probably to celebrate Aretas 's triumphant return from Rome with full, if reluctant, recognition as the king of the Nabataeans.38 The portraits of Groups G, H, I and J differ markedly from those of Groups B and C, in that they represent a man with hair bound tightly to the crown of his head with a laurel wreath and curls of hair falling down to the nape of his neck. The combination of the hairstyle, the wreath, and the facial features make it likely that the man depicted on these lead coins is Aretas IV, who used similar portraits for his early silver and bronze coins (Pl. 30, fig. 6). The moustached portrait used for Group H associates it with the images of Aretas IV wearing a moustache that appeared on bronze coins issued in his name alone and in conjunction with his wife, Shuqailat (Meshorer nos. 112-115). The presence of Shuqailat allows the bronze coins, and probably the new lead type, to be dated to the period AD 18-25. 39 Uncertain Portraits It is unclear who the obverse types of Groups E and F are intended to represent.

The dissimilarity of this type to the Zeus (Hadad?) obverses of Groups K and L may support the latter interpretation, but the poor engraving and preservation conspire to prevent a more secure attribution. The extremely poor preservation of El 8 makes it impossible to suggest the identity of the man or god depicted on the obverse. Nike The Nike on issues of Obodas III and Aretas IV may have served a commemorative purpose, as she often did on Hellenistic and Roman coinage. On the other hand, it is just as possible that she appears here as a generic symbol of victory. In the years after the victory of the future Augustus at Actium in 31 BC images of Nike/Victoria became especially popular on the coinages of the Mediterranean world in general. She also appears frequently as a decorative feature of architecture at Nabataean centres like Petra and Khirbet et-Tannur.40 Obodas III is not known to have been an especially warlike king, but on his issues Nike may refer to the brief military victory that he claimed over Herod the Great. According to Josephus, in 12 BC the bandits of the Trachonitis revolted against their ruler, Herod of Judaea, a longstanding enemy of the Nabataean kings. Although this uprising was soon crushed, the leaders of the rebellion fled to Nabataea where they were warmly welcomed and received royal support. For the next three years the bandits and their Nabataean allies inflicted severe losses on the Herodian domains. Their string of victorious attacks only came to an end in 9 BC when Herod invaded the Arab kingdom, supposedly killing some 25,000 Nabataeans. Obodas III died shortly thereafter, perhaps by the treachery of his chief minister, Syllaeus.41 It is also possible that the lead and bronze Nike types of Obodas III were intended to commemorate the Roman expedition against the Sabaeans of Arabia Felix in 26/5 BC. This invasion of the Arabian Peninsula aimed at claiming the vast wealth of the perfume and spice trade for the Roman Empire and relied heavily on Nabataean support. Obodas III provided about 1 ,000 auxiliary troops and Syllaeus as a guide for the prefect of Egypt and his legions.42 Ultimately poor planning and the hostile desert environment forced the Romans to return to Egypt, having accomplished little. Nevertheless, it is notable that contemporary Roman literature largely ignored the debacle of the Arabian episode, preferring to add the 'conquest' of the Sabaeans to the long list of Augustus' triumphs. The Emperor himself describes it as one of his great accomplishments in the Res Gestae and Strabo insists that the Sabaeans became Roman vassals, despite the ultimate failure of the expedition.43 Describing the power of Augustus, Virgil says, 'At that terror. . .all Arabs, all Sabaeans flee'.44 Propertius places the Sabaeans in a more explicitly triumphal context in his description of Augustus' restoration of the Parthian standards. According to him, 'even India offers her neck to your triumph, Augustus, and the house of virgin Arabia trembles before you'.45 Perhaps Obodas III also took the diplomatic route by using the Nike type to cast the imperfect Sabaean invasion (and the part his people played in it) in the light of victory. The lead Nike issues with the portrait of Aretas IV (Group C) may simply be a continuation of the Nike series of Obodas III. On the other hand, the early portrait with which Nike is 40 Glueck, pp. 430-50 and pls. 179-185, 188-189. 41 Jos. A/ 16.296. 42 For the main account of the invasion see Strab. 16.4.22-24; S.

Alternatively, there is a remote possibility that the Nike type may have been resurrected by Aretas IV to celebrate his successful campaign against Herod Antipas in AD 34, which added the Gaulanitis and adjacent regions to the Nabataean kingdom.46 However, the very early style of the obverse portrait bust and the close similarity of the Nike reverse to those issued by Obodas III seem to tell against this war as the occasion for the production of this type. Another possibility is that Nike represents some non-military triumph. The palm branch, a victorial emblem often carried by Nike, appears on the coins of Aretas IV, apparently to herald the birth of his fourth son, Phasael, in 5 BC and to celebrate the coronation of his second wife, Shuqailat, in AD 18.47 It is unclear whether the use of Nike in conjunction with the Heracles (Milcom?) obverse type might have had any special political meaning. Heracles (Milkom?) Although Heracles was an extremely popular god among the Greeks, in a Nabataean context it seems probable that he is a Hellenized version of a native Semitic god. Already at the end of the fifth century BC Herodotus had popularized the notion that the Tyrian god Melqart was a Phoenician version of Heracles.48 This view became so prevalent that by the end of the first century BC Melqart had lost almost all of his traditional iconography and replaced it with the accoutrements of his Greek counterpart. Tyrian silver and bronze coins from the late second century BC to the second century AD depict him as a youthful god wearing Heracles' lion skin and a laurel wreath, while his club is used as the city's mintmark (PL 30, fig. I).49 If a native god does lurk behind the image of Heracles on the lead issues of Group D, the most likely suspect is the old Ammonite deity Milkom, who continued to be worshipped in the Hellenistic and Roman periods at cult centres in Nabataea proper, as well as in the Decapolis. Heracles-Milkom is most notable at Adraa, Abila and Philadelphia, where he was depicted on Roman provincial coins as a youthful Heracles (Pl. 30, fig. 8).50 Statuary depicting Heracles has been found at the Nabataean capital of Petra.51 Zeus (Hadad?) and the charging bull While the obverse type of groups K and L depicts a fairly standard image of Zeus wearing a laurel wreath, in the Nabataean context it is tempting to think that he represents the syncretistic Graeco-Syrian deity, Zeus-Hadad. By the first century BC/AD this god, essentially a Hellenized version of the ancient Ba'al Hadad ('Lord of Thunder') worshipped for centuries in Syria and Palestine, had taken on many of the characteristics of Olympian Zeus. In the art of the Hellenistic and Roman periods he has the long flowing hair and beard as well as the laurel wreath familiar from depictions of the Greek supreme deity. 46 Jos. A J 18.112-118.

HOOVER It would be unsurprising for Zeus-Hadad to appear on Nabataean coins since his sculptural representation has been found at several important Nabataean sites, including Qasr el-Bint in Petra and Jebel et-Tannur. 52 Nevertheless, it has been plausibly suggested that in a Nabataean context this iconography may not have been employed to represent Zeus-Hadad qua Zeus- Hadad, but rather to provide an anthropomorphic form for Dushara ('Lord of the Sharā'),53 the principal male god of the Nabataean pantheon. In his natural Nabataean form Dushara, much like Jewish Yahweh, had no true iconic representation. Instead, he was traditionally worshipped in the form of a baetyl , a cult stone, not unlike the famous Black Stone of Emesa brought to Rome by the emperor Elagabalus. Depictions of Dushara as a baetyl survive on the Roman provincial coinage produced by Bostra and Adraa (PI. 30, fig. 9) under various second century emperors.54 Because Dushara lacked his own anthropomorphic identity, it was fitting that when an iconic depiction was deemed necessary he was cast in the guise of Zeus-Hadad, the popular supreme deity of the surrounding region. Although Dushara (Dousares in Greek) is depicted on Roman provincial coins of the second century AD as a wreathed beardless youth (PL 30, fig. 10), 55 perhaps assimilating him to Dionysus because of his powers as a vegetation deity,56 it is almost certain that in the first century BC/AD the Nabataeans identified him with Zeus. While on his way to Rome in 9 BC, Syllaeus made dedications to Zeus Dushara (All AOY[2APEI]) for the health of Obodas III in both Greek and Nabataean at Miletus and Priene.57 The identification of Dushara with Zeus appears to have been so strong that it survived into eastern Christian folklore in the person of St Zeus Dousares.58 Dushara in the guise of Zeus-Hadad would make good sense of the iconography of the lead pieces. As early as the 1 8th century BC, Ba'al Hadad, the original Semitic deity who underlies the Hellenized Zeus-Hadad, was closely associated with bulls and taurine iconography. In early Syro-Phoenician depictions he often wears a crown decorated with bull's horns and rides on the back of a bull, emblematic of his power as a weather god. His taurine associations continued into the Hellenistic and Roman periods, when he was normally depicted enthroned with bulls flanking him on either side (PI. 30, fig. II).59 The Inscriptions At the present time the full meaning of the Nabataean inscriptions found on the issues of Groups I and L still remains uncertain. Meshorer interpreted both lorn (NBT) of L52- 54 and "pN (ADR) of L57-59 as the abbreviated ethnic of the Nabataeans and the name of Adraa, one of their important cities in northern Nabataea.

The coins show that there was definitely enough room to fit the extra letters required to spell out the full names lūru (NBTW) and rrpx (ADRH). It is also less than perfectly clear why the city of Adraa and the Nabataeans as a group should both use the same Zeus (Hadad)/bull types. The single letter V (A) on 141 is especially perplexing. It may represent a mintmark, the initial letter of a name, or perhaps even a date (57=70). Because dates are normally introduced on royal Nabataean coins by the word 'year' (nnw, sometimes abbreviated as ' V), and none of the Nabataean kings ruled for seventy years, the use of y as a date seems unlikely. There is a slim possibility that the letter could represent a date reckoned by a civic era. The Pompeian Era, counting from 64/3 BC and employed by the Decapolitan and Arabian cities of Dium, Abila, Canatha, Gadara, Gerasa and Pella, would make year 70 equal to AD 6/7. Such a date would be in keeping with the view that the obverse portrait is that of Aretas IV. Nevertheless, it is difficult to be sure that a date is intended, on the basis of a single letter. It is also unlikely that the Pompeian Era would have had any importance as a dating system in the major Nabataean centres of Adraa, Bostra, Petra, and Rabbathmoba, which only issued dated civic coinages after they were reconstituted as part of the Roman provincia Arabia. In these cities an era counting from the formation of the province in AD 105/6 was used. Year 70 calculated on this provincial era would equal AD 175/6, which seems much too late in light of the portrait type. Lead Coins or Lead Tokens? One of the more vexing problems concerning the Nabataean lead issues, as with most lead series of the ancient world, is the determination of their function within the economy. When only one or two examples were known it was possible to dismiss them as Nabataean test pieces for bronze coins that were never produced,60 but the existence of 61 specimens of 12 different types now makes this view untenable. Because lead was rarely a standard metal for proper coinage in the ancient Mediterranean world, there are really only two possible explanations for the Nabataean pieces. They should either be seen as emergency coins struck in lead at a time when precious metal was unavailable for minting, or they should be considered as tokens or tesserae redeemable for various goods or services. Lead coins, thought to have been produced as stopgap replacements for regular silver and copper coinage, are known from a variety of Near Eastern cities and kingdoms, particularly in the late Hellenistic period. The lead series of Alexander Jannaeus is thought to have been struck because of a copper shortage, although it has recently been argued that these were really tokens rather than a substitute coinage.61 Similarly, as mentioned above, under the Seleucids the types of the regular silver and bronze coinages of Antiochus III and Demetrius III were struck in lead, apparently at times when, or in places where, the appropriate metals were hard to come by.62 Lead replacement issues have also been identified for the Ptolemaic and Parthian kingdoms.63 60 Schmitt-Korte, p. 107, no. 7. 61 Barag, pp. 1-3; Y. Meshorer, Ancient Jewish Coinage , vol. 1 (New York, 1982), pp. 82-3; Y. Meshorer, A Treasury of Jewish Coins (New York, 2001), p. 47-8. For the possibility that this was really a token issue see D. Hendin, 'Four new Jewish lead coins or tokens', INJ 13 (1994-99), pp. 63-5 and D. Hendin, A Gude to Biblical Coins , 4th ed. (New York, 2001), pp. 139-40. 62 Antiochus III: SC , p. 466 and no. 1282; Demetrius III: Houghton, 'Seleucid lead issues', pp. 30-1.

Parthians: SC, p. 466.</page><page sequence="14">118 OLIVER D. HOOVER It might be tempting to interpret the Nabataean lead pieces as emergency coins because the end of Obodas Ill's reign and the early years of Aretas IV saw financial difficulties for the Nabataean kingdom exacerbated by the border conflicts with Herod the Great and the magnificent gifts given to Augustus. However, it is unlikely that the lead issues were produced as replacements for silver since Aretas IV issued a special series of copper coins which explicitly indicate that they were used for this purpose. Certain bronze coins of his tenth (AD 1/2) and eleventh (AD 2/3) years are marked in Nabataean with the names of the silver denominations that they replace. Both silver ma 'ah (DOD ni7D) and silver half (DOD xn) substitute denominations are known.64 These coins apparently began to fall out of use after year sixteen (AD 7/8) when the silver shortage ended and Aretas IV resumed production of a proper silver coinage. Because it is clear that Aretas IV used bronze for his replacement coinage when silver was scarce, and because the non-portrait types of the Nabataean lead issues, with the exception of Al, are so completely unrelated to types used for the regular coinage, it seems most likely that the lead pieces were produced as a kind of token analogous to the tesserae used to distribute largesse at Rome and other cities of the Empire. According to the literary sources, tesserae , given out by emperors on festive occasions, could be redeemed by their recipients for gifts of foodstuffs or money and sometimes for luxury items like pearls or even an entire apartment block.65 Lead tesserae were also produced by private establishments and clubs as tokens redeemable for various goods and services.66 If our interpretation of the Nabataean lead pieces as tesserae is correct, they were probably distributed by the king or his officials on important triumphal or religious occasions, much as they were at Rome. The types, which emphasize victory and local deities, would tend to corroborate this view. Conclusion When Ya'akov Meshorer pioneered the modern study of Nabataean coinage in 1975, the lead issues could be interpreted only very dimly because of the great rarity of specimens and the poor preservation of those that were known. Thanks to the sudden appearance of Nabataean lead pieces in quantity at the beginning of the twenty-first century, it is now possible to better scrutinize the several series and properly attribute them to Obodas III and Aretas IV, rather than to Aretas II and III. Hopefully more specimens will appear in future with full context information, especially from controlled archaeological excavations, so that our understanding of the enigmatic Nabataean lead pieces can be brought further into focus.
