<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY By Mawy Bouchard, University of Ottawa 1. General JMEMS, 37, a special issue entitled 'Medieval/Renaissance: after periodization', ed. Jennifer Summit and David Wallace, proposes a discussion on the periodization that Fredric Jameson judges necessary for any historical discipline, for 'without borders marking off points of temporal difference, it would be impossible to conceive or express historical change.' In their introduction 'Rethinking periodization' (447-51), S. and W. suggest that periodization might also complicate and even falsify the process of understanding the past: the concept of 'modernity', being often (if not always) associated to the 'new', itself, for our modern sensibility, very close to the value judgment, becomes a selective instrument that denigrates important elements of past cultures. The issue is an invitation to open up disciplinary frontiers and to instigate collaborative initiatives that could be most fruitful to both French Medieval and Renaissance Studies. See also J. Rabasa, 'The colonial divide', ib., 511-29. Sandra Sider, Handbook to Life in Renaissance Europe, OUP, 382 pp., is much too concise to offer a firm grasp on the 12 aspects of Renai ssance life that it aims to describe, but it certainly can serve as a good introductory tool for students and teachers who are looking for an accessible reference to the history of politics, religion, visual arts, music, literature, language, science, medicine, geography, commerce, and society in general. I. Garnier-Mathez, 'Connivence et litterature: une methode d'ana lyse textuelle pour lire entre les mots', RHLF, 106:771-90, proposes some methodological tools borrowed from sociolinguistics (namely the 'ideolect') to identify ideological communities. The author dem onstrates the utility and the pertinence of this literary transposition of a sociolinguistic notion through the analysis of an evangelical corpus (Marguerite de Navarre, Marot, Farel, Rabelais, etc.). J. Ceard, 'L'Humanisme en France. Etat de la question et propo sitions', SFr, 153:516-25, in a special issue entitled 'L'Umanesimo in Europa. In ricordo di Franco Simone', proposes to purify the notion of 'humanisme', which has accumulated many extensions through the</page><page sequence="2">The Sixteenth Century 77 years that stray from its essence. Is humanism a philosophical project or a method? Are the activities of humanism concerned with the study of the human per se, or are they, as Montaigne wrote, related to the non theologian status of the participants? Anchored in a vast pan-European project on humanism, C.'s reflexion emerges from his readings of Bude, the model of humanism conceived as the necessary philologia minor which leads to the philologia maior, in other words the reading and the understanding of sacred texts. Humanism is thus defined as an original philosophy of culture based on the method of philology and on the idea of a profound unity between all knowledges. M. Bouchard, 'LAfrique de Petrarque et la bataille des lettres a la Renaissance', (Analyses (online), shows that, throughout the Africa, the preponderance of letters in general and of poetry in particular constitutes a leitmotif that was to become emblematic of Renaissance literature and humanism. Marie-Josephe Beaud-Gambier and Therese Redier, Portraits Singuliers, Les Belles Lettres, 378 pp., complements VEurope des humanistes, XlVe-XVIIe siecle (1995); it had been intended to publish both works together. This book presents a gallery of 80 portraits, engravings of various masterpieces by Holbein and Titian (among others), of many famous and less famous French humanists and poets, magistrates, merchants, navigators, and men and women, that were diffused throughout Europe. This insightful selection of portraits from a collection of over 5,600 is accompanied by the original inscription (translated into French when necessary), a concise biographical note, and a critical description of the image, which give access to the reception of diverse public figures among French contemporaries. Rebecca Ard Boone, War, Domination, and the Monarchy of France. Claude de Seyssel and the Language of Politics in the Renaissance, Leiden, Brill, 193 pp., proposes a panorama of S.'s life and achievements in the sphere of politics and translation of Ancient history. Although not conceived as an overview of French Renaissance thought on politics and humanism, this book offers many insightful developments on the influential role of S. on the evolution of the French monarchy. Wagner, Entrees, organized around the theme of the exchange' in entrees solennelles' (entrance processions of great pomposity) and in recreation, sheds light on the circular dynamics that surrounds cultural, and more specifically, political ceremonies, which are staged, throughout most essays, as a manifestation or manipulation of power that feeds on collective imagination and customs.</page><page sequence="3">78 French Studies 2 History of the Book and Philology French Vernacular Books/Livres vernaculaires francais, ed. Andrew Pettegree, Malcolm Walsby, and Alexander Wilkinson, Leiden, Brill, 2 vols, 735, 801 pp., is a colossal enterprise initiated in 1995 at the University of St Andrews: the two volumes include all known editions of works published in the French vernacular before 1601. The editors have searched through over 1800 libraries around the world, and have discovered that almost half of the largest collections are found outside France. Also included are the rich but little known French municipal libraries. The information for each book entry is meticulously compiled according to a rigorous annotation system that facilitates consultation of both volumes. It is certainly a bibliographical event to celebrate. Paris Capitale des Livres. Le monde des livres et de la presse a Paris, du Moyen Age au XXeme siecle, ed. Frederic Barbier, Perpignan U.P., 344 pp. This beautiful book with reproductions of original illustrations of a rare quality is intended for a wide audience, for it does not address the history of the book in all its depth and complexity. It has a short section entitled 'XVIe siecle: la societe parisienne s'ouvre a l'imprime' (100-39), which covers the emergence of philology and, at the same time, censorship. The story of Paris as a capital of the printing industry is recounted through a selection of books and photographs of original editions. Paul Delsalle, La Recherche historique en archives XVI ? XVII ? XVIIIe siecles, Ophrys, 214 pp., a revised edition of a manual first published in 1993 and updated by a team of new contributors, brings forth some valuable information on research methods in Early Modern archives. Aimed at a public of students or scholars who do not have extensive experience in locating archival documents, the text is divided into four sections designed to initiate the reader progressively in archival research. This practical book is a good tool, easy to consult, and very detailed. Armstrong, Book and Text, is an attempt to make meaningful the relationship between texts and books', and to re-establish the importance of the material context of the book. The following contributions all successfully do so: C. J. Brown, 'From stage to page: royal entry performances in honour of Mary Tudor (1514)' (49-72), R. Cooper, 'Picturing Marot' (117-38), T. Conley, 'An eclogue engraved: Maurice Sceve and Bernard Salomon's Saulsaye (1547)' (139-62), M. Quainton, 'The exploitation of parentheses and lunulae in Ronsard's Hynne de Calays et de Zethes (177-94). Daniel Maira, Typosine, la dixieme muse.</page><page sequence="4">The Sixteenth Century 79 Une forme editoriale des canzonieri francais (1544-1560), Geneva, Droz, 512 pp., seems to establish a dialogue with Armstrong and Quainton in this impressive endeavour. His study of the canzoniere as the genre of Petrarchan love poetry takes into account the material presentation of this type of book as a distinctive part of its poetics. Maira argues that the editors and publishers establish part of the code of reading that is particular to the canzoniere, and therefore is very attentive to what R. Chartier calls the 'mise en livre' and H.-J. Martin 'the mise en texte\ He shows that the canzoniere, despite the inexistence of a corresponding official and ancient form of poetics, succeeds in establishing its aesthetical identity through the efficient 'mise en livre' of editorialists who fashioned one of the first successes of the book market. This book offers a fruitful reading that will be most useful if combined with Alduy's study of the 'amours' (see below), for they complement each other in a very unusual manner. Legare, Livres, sheds light on women's participation in the emergence of the book industry in Europe (more precisely, in the kingdom of France, the territory of Burgundy, and the Italian states), during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Contributors have considered the role of women as book collectors or purchasers, and producers, as well as readers and writers. See R. Claerr, '"Que ma memoire Id demeure, en mes livres": Catherine de Coetivy (vers 1460-1529) et sa bibliotheque' (101-18), M. B. Winn, '"Louenges" envers Louise: un manuscrit enlumine d'Antoine Verard pour Louise de Savoie' (119-32), C. Muller, '"Monstrum inter libros": la perception de la femme lettree chez les humanistes de la Renaissance francaise (l'exemple de Camille de Morel)' (133-40), J. Verbij-Schillings, 'Les relations entre femmes et livres: essai d'une typologie a partir de la Bibliotheca Neerlandica Manuscripta' (163-74), A. S. Korteweg, 'La collection de livres d'une femme independante: Marie de Luxembourg (v. 1470-1547)' (221-32), A.-M. Legare, 'Les bibliotheques de deux princesses: Marguerite d'York et Marguerite d'Autriche' (253-64), M.-M. Fontaine, 'Des auteurs pour Marguerite d'Autriche et les dames de la cour de Malines: Olivier de La Marche et Jean Lemaire de Beiges' (265-78). Entre la ville, la noblesse et l'?tat: Philippe de Cleves (1456-1528), homme politique et bibliophile, ed. Jelle Haemers, Celine Van Hoorebeeck, and Hanno Wijsman, Turnhout, Brepols, 298 pp., includes: K. De Coene, 'The winnow and the sifted past. From the emblem to the library and back again' (161-81), A. Korteweg, 'La bibliotheque de Philippe de Cleves: inventaire et manuscrits parvenus jusqu'a nous' (183-221), C. Van Hoorebeeck, 'Les bibliotheques de Philippe de Cleves (1456</page><page sequence="5">80 French Studies 1528), Thomas de Plaine (ca. 1444-1507) et Philippe Wielant (1441-1520). Essai de mise en perspective' (223-40), all offering some very valuable data and illustrations concerning the history of the book in general and the rich collection of Philippe de Cleves in particular. Van Hoorebeeck, through a comparative analysis of three great collections, tackles some very challenging questions which emerged with the new' history of the book: how do people read throughout history, and are there any significant differences in the choice of reading from one social cast to the other? These two questions are linked, and V.H., who finds the same titles in the collections of men belonging to different social groups, seeks out new criteria for understanding the relation of specific group of readers to books in the Renaissance. Loris Petris, 'Vestiges de la bibliotheque du cardinal Jean du Bellay', BHR, 69:131-46, presents some of the jewels of du Bellay s collection and attempts to describe du Bellay's attitude towards books and reading. M. Vene, 'L'imprimeur de La Deffence et de L'Olive de 1549 et le mystere des lettrines "C E'", BHR, 69:645-58, takes on the theory held by Nina Catach in 1968, according to which Francois Girault was possibly responsible for the printing of Du Bellays two inseparable works. Ingeborg Jostock, La Censure negociee: le contrdle du livre a Geneve, 1560-162$, Geneva, Droz, 440 pp., exposes the phenomenon of Protestant censorship, which has rarely been documented in historiography. J. shows that the reasons for censorship are often the same through the centuries and differing cultures: religious orthodoxy, public morality, diplomatic concerns, and internal politics. However, she insists on the marked importance of political considerations in the case of the Protestant church, between 1560 and 1625, as it was closely related to civil power and the frequent necessity to take into consideration diplomatic situations with foreign countries. Through her analysis of archival documents, J. proposes a new way of approaching censorship as a negotiation between many institutions that require internal cohesion and cooperation in order to flourish or maintain their influence. H. Parenty, 'La philologie a moments perdus: lecture de la Bible et culture profane chez Isaac Casaubon', BSHPF, 153.1:21-31, argues that Casaubon, although very involved in the literary profession, considers his philological activity as an otium, unrelated to 'serious' work. One might wonder why P. does not address the rhetorical scope of the negligentia diligens topos.</page><page sequence="6">The Sixteenth Century 81 3. Interdisciplinarity Carla Zecher, Sounding Objects. Musical Instruments, Poetry, and Art in Renaissance France, Toronto U.P., 241 pp., proposes an historical recontextualization of the mechanics of musical production through which the reader will gain access to the whole realm of music in Renaissance culture, especially as far as poetry is concerned. She in fact exposes the strategic and figurative use (by Ronsard, among others) of musical instruments to fashion literary identity, both individual and institutional. Carlino, Litterature et medecine, emphasizes the porosity' of the literary concept and the extension of the medical notion, and shows that texts relating to medicine are also concerned with fiction. A. Carlino, 'Les fondements humanistes de la medecine: rhetorique et medecine a Padoue vers 1540' (19-47), reveals at least one of the connections between literature and medicine and recalls Benveniste's distinction between three types of therapeutic care that establishes a dialogue with Dumezil s tripartite social structure of the Indo-European civilization (knife medicine, war; herbal medicine, agriculture; speech medicine, clergy). X. Le Person, 'Dune "bonne et saincte ypocrisie": usages et discours epistolaire de la maladie dans la vie nobiliaire au XVIe siecle' (229-46), suggests that epistolary discourse on illness is often a rhetorical instrument for noble interlocutors that serves many diverse ethical functions. For example the sick body often serves as a means to suggest something else. Valerie Worth-Stylianou, Les Traites d'obstetrique en langue francaise au seuil de la modernite. Bibliographic critique des Divers travaulx d'Euchaire Rosslin (1536) a VApologie de Louyse Bourgeois sage femme (1627), Geneva, Droz, 496 pp., originally intended as an investigation of the representation of maternity in French literature of the Renaissance, supplies an exploration of French obstetrical treatises and of medical knowledge that covers various representations and their reception among their contemporaries, through a succinct presentation of the many editions of books concerned with obstetrics dating before 1650. Most of the book is dedicated to a critical bibliography of obstetrical treatises. Y. C. Croizat, '"Living dolls": Francois Ier dresses his women, RQ, 60:94-130, attempts to understand Francois Is interest in fashion dolls, miniature reproductions of courtly figures that functioned as objects of discovery in regard to foreign styles of dress.</page><page sequence="7">82 French Studies Litterature, 145, 'L'embleme litteraire: theories et pratiques', is entirely dedicated to emblems. Originally the result of a collaborative work, the emblem book requires the participation of many specialists able to address various problematic elements with the combined theoretical tools of multiple disciplines. This collection of articles offers enticing and complementary perspectives on the emblem book, from its material constitution and architecture to the pragmatic and philosophical status of the image. See S. Rollet, 'Situation et perspectives' (3-9), A. Adams, 'La conception et 1'edition des livres d'emblemes dans la France du XVIe siecle' (10-22), E. Klecker, 'Des signes muets aux emblemes chanteurs: les Emblemata d'Alciat et l'emblematique' (23-52), A. Rolet, 'Aux sources de l'embleme: blasons et devises' (53-78), P.

Russell, 'Nouvelles directions dans l'etude de l'embleme francais' (138-49). Anne Belanger, Bomarzo ou les incertitudes de la lecture: figure de la 'meraviglia dans un jardin manieriste du XVIe siecle, Champion, 324 pp., is an unusual research endeavour which explores the art of the Italian garden of Bomarzo (Lazio) which is considered as a reflection of the i6th-c.'s referential universe. The author puts forward the imaginary, the cultural codes, and the frames of mind that allow the visitor to the Bomarzo garden to place every sign and symbol in relation to one another and to 'make sense' of a mysterious place that evokes, through the understanding of meraviglia, the phenomenon of reading and of fiction. 4. Civilization and Institutions La Papaute a la Renaissance, ed. Florence Alazard and Frank La Brasca, Champion, 756 p., is concerned with the representation and theatrics of papacy during the extended Renaissance period, starting from the first crisis associated with the Great Schism to the Lutheran Reformation and its consequences for the Roman Catholic Church. Many of the articles, by historians, literary critics, philosophers, and art historians, support the model of papacy in the emergence of a modern state, as well as the central role, again, of Castiglione's Cortegiano in the codification of Roman manners. The following contributions are of broader interest for Renaissance studies: N. Lemaitre, 'La papaute de la Renaissance entre mythes et realites' (13-34), 'M.-T. Ricci, 'La cour papale et la cortegiana a travers l'oeuvre et la figure de Castiglione' (267-83), J.-P. Vanden</page><page sequence="8">The Sixteenth Century 83 Branden, 'Un pamphlet d'firasme contre Jules II: Julius exclusus a coelis (455-64). Jacqueline Boucher, Societe et mentalites autour de Henri III, Champion, 1273 pp. One might think after reading this monumental book that everything concerning the court of Henri III has been said, but B. humbly insists that there are still some avenues to be explored for scholars. B. completely re-evaluates the political role as well as the social and cultural influence of Henri Ills personality on his court, which, in her view, has been underestimated by historians who exaggerate Catherine de Medicis's importance. Henri III ? mecene des arts, des sciences et des lettres, ed. Isabelle de Conihout, Jean-Francois Maillard, and Guy Poirier, PUPS, 2006,342 pp., is admirable in many ways. It is materially impeccable, offering many reproductions of engravings, etchings, and original manuscript or printed editions. The structure of the book facilitates the discovery of Henri Ill's artistic universe, and the variety of the perspectives supplied by the collaborators fully justifies the revival of interest in Henri Ills reign. See, among others, J. Boucher, 'Realite et limites du mecenat de Henri III' (15-26), M. McGowan, 'Lessor du ballet a la cour de Henri III' (81-90), D.

Florent Quellier, La Table des Francais. Une histoire culturelle (XVe-debut XIXe siecle), Rennes U.P., 274 pp. The topics of food and eating feature since the Middle Ages, if not earlier, in diverse types of writings, from the obvious recipe books, to satirical and morality works, and to literature ? novel, theatre, and tales. Since the works of the Annales school have been published, there has been a renewal in the manner of investigating the subject of alimentation. This study proposes to make the most of the pluridisciplinarity that has been part of the historiographical revolution in addressing the topic of food from the perspectives of economics (involving both the producer and the consumer), sociology, religion, demography, dietetics, and</page><page sequence="9">84 French Studies anthropology. At the Table. Metaphorical and Material Cultures of Food in Medieval and Early Modern Europe, ed. T. J. Tomasik and }. M. Vitullo, Turnhout, Brepols, 225 pp., investigates the interrelation of food and discourse, and the manner in which food serves as a metaphor of the humanist ideal of harmony of body and soul, in two articles devoted to the French Renaissance: L. B. Ross, 'Beyond eating: political and personal significance of the entremets at the banquets of the Burgundian Court' (145-66); M. Jeanneret, "'Ma salade et ma muse": on Renaissance vegetarianism' (221-30). Jeanneret suggests that fasting is at least as frequent in the Renaissance as feasting, and goes on to show that temperance and frugality are often associated with the production of cultural artefacts in the 16th century. Patronnes et mecenes en France a la Renaissance, ed. Kathleen Wilson-Chevalier and Eugenie Pascal, Saint-Etienne U.P., 680 pp., fills a gap in the history of patronage, for it underlines the important contributions of women of the Renaissance to the enhancement of art and literature. The collection is divided into two parts, the first dedicated to verbal patronage as it appears in manuscript, prints, theatre, and correspondence, the second part composed of a series of case studies. S. Broomhall, 'Au-dela de la Cour: patronnes et mecenes du manuscrit a l'imprime' (45-58), A. Evain, 'Les reines et princesses de France, mecenes, patronnes et protectrices du theatre au XVIe siecle' (59-99), E.

Winn, 'Louise de Savoie, ses enfants et ses livres: du pouvoir familial au pouvoir d'Etat' (251-81). Pollie Bromilow, Models of Women in Sixteenth-Century French Literature: Female Exemplarity in the 'Histories tragiques7 (1559) and the 'Heptameron (1559), NY, Mellen, 207 pp., is a great study of both the representation of women and exemplarity in general in the French Renaissance, for B. explores the 'troubled relation to the universal' that is implied in a mixed gender readership, and which subsequently sheds light on the diversity of writing strategies employed by the authors. The proposed contrast between the Heptameron and the Histoires tragiques is quite convincing. C. Hampton, 'Unpicking female exemplarity, or, the usefulness of body stories: reassessing female communal identity in two Early Modern French texts', MLR, 102:381-96, chooses to study an</page><page sequence="10">The Sixteenth Century 85 anonymous text, the Epistre d'une damoiselle francoyse [...] sur la mort dexcellente et vertueuseDame, Leonor deRoye, Princesse de Conde (n.p., 1564) and Louise Bourgeois's Instruction a mafille (1626) to expose the relationship between women and their own reproductive system, which appears to them as a paradox. The fragility of women is found to be at the centre of an interrogation of female exemplarity. H. N. Parker, 'The magnificence of learned women, Viator, 38:265-89, answers convincingly the question of purposes (education for what?), agents (by and for whom?) and resources (with what?) of learned women during the Renaissance, using the concept of magnificence' as a central topos of argumentation. Joel Coste, Representations et comportements en temps d'epidemic dans la litterature imprimee depeste (1490-1723). Contribution a Vhistoire culturelle de la peste en France a Vepoque moderne, Champion, 837 pp., provides a valuable study of the representation of plague in the modern era. Through a cultural analysis that makes the most of many different sources, many of which are rarely considered (personal testimonies taken from diaries, memoirs, letters, professional observations of physicians, surgeons, religious representatives, and administrators), the author attempts to understand better how the phenomenon of the plague was addressed by populations and authorities, and how certain norms of behaviour were more readily accepted or rejected. Paul-Alexis Mellet, Les Traites Monarchomaques. Confusion des temps, resistance armee et monarchic parfaite (1560-1600), Geneva, Droz, 568 pp., is based on a doctoral thesis in history and is concerned with a corpus of texts that have a polemical scope for theology and historiography (namely Hotman's Francogallia, Le reveille matin des francais), and especially an influence on i6th-c. fiction, as M questions the status of those 'monarchomaque' narratives which use a method and a style that is certainly literary. M. also proposes a definition of the genre that attempts, as theoretically as possible, to avoid William Barclay's polemical statement. 5. Intertextuality, Influences, Imitation, and Sources O. Pedeflous, 'La lecture de Claudien dans les colleges au XVIe siecle', BHR, 69:55-82, and Id., 'Les "Lambeaux de pourpre" d'un alexandrin: Aemulatio autour de l'oeuvre de Claudien en France au XVIe siecle', BHR, 69:659-87. P. starts by demonstrating that Claudianus is present alongside other ancient authors in colleges (namely with the De raptu</page><page sequence="11">86 French Studies Proserpinae), and concludes that he is a reference and a model for some Renaissance writers. CRM, 14, offers a second volume devoted to Julius Caesar: 'La figure de Jules-Cesar au Moyen Age et a la Renaissance (n)\ ed. Bruno Meniel and Bernard Rib?mont. Articles related to the 16th c. include M. Martin, 'Les "vies paralleles" de Cesar a la fin du XVIe et au debut du XVIIe siecle' (57-72), fi. Karagiannis-Mazeaud, 'Force ou violence? Images de Jules Cesar dans loeuvre de la Pleiade* (85-110), and M.-fi. Boutroue, 'fitienne de Laigue et le commentaire de Jules Cesar a la Renaissance1 (159-74). As a figure representing reversibility (from generous to tyrannical, from audacious to usurper), and of ancient hubris (prolific in Renaissance culture from the beginning of the 16th c), Caesar was not a prudent choice for drawing beneficial parallels with authorities of the time. As Martial demonstrates, C. is more often evoked to portray adversaries, as in the Menippean satire, or to constitute paradoxical praises. The parallels between C. and Henri IV, especially after the latters death, develop into a close association that restricts the use of the Roman figure in relation to subsequent kings. H. Thomas-Campagne, 'De Thistoire tragique a la dramaturgic: lexemple de Francois de Belleforest&gt;, RHLF, 106:771-90, suggests that intertextuality and imitation effects work from one genre to another in a reciprocal manner; it is well known that tragic novellas were inspired by dramatic pieces, contemporary and ancient, but an observation of the opposite phenomenon is less frequent. This article puts forward some of the techniques of transposition from the novella to dramatic genres. T. Bruyer and J. Vanacker, '"Che dire di te, Lucrezia?" parodies italiennes et francaises du mythe de Lucrece a la Renaissance et a Page Baroque1, BHR, 69:327-50, analyses the parodied transformations of the myth of Lucretia, from its origins in Livy's History of Rome to its first modifications in Machiavellis The Mandrake and Marguerite de Navarre's Heptameron. 6. History of Ideas and Thematic Studies Michael D. Bailey, Magic and Superstition in Europe: A Concise History from Antiquity to the Present, Lanham, MD, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2006, 275 pp., attempts to describe the evolution of modern 'disenchantment' through a concise and efficient overview of magical practices and beliefs, focusing (in chapters 5 and 6) on witchcraft and witch-hunts during the Early Modern period. Gary K. Waite, Eradicating the Devil's Minions. Anabaptists and Witches in Reformation Europe, 1535-1600,</page><page sequence="12">The Sixteenth Century 87 Toronto U.P., 319 pp., aims to compare the judicial treatment of two heretical groups, Anabaptists and supposed witches, underlining the connection that existed in the cultural context between heresy and otherness', which was generally attributed to diabolical inspiration. The book thus concentrates on the acts of persecution during the reign of the Habsburg monarchs, where Anabaptism was most prevalent. T. Chesters, 'Demonology on the margins: Robert Du Triez's Les Ruses, finesses et impostures des esprits matins (1563)', RenS, 21.3:395-410, presents a text of great interest from many perspectives, be it that of the historiography of demonology or of cultural history more generally. He also constructs a convincing explanation of the surprising level of indifference the text has provoked to date. Last but not least, C. underlines the fact that Les Ruses reveals a discerning conception of the demonic phenomenon that has a lot to do with the techniques of narratives and fiction. Lavocat, Demonologie, tackles the subject of demonology from the perspective of writing and fiction. More than a study of representations of demons, this book looks at the relationship between witchcraft, as a (fictitious) topic of theological and judicial treatises, and literature, as a mean of fiction. In fact, not only does witchcraft appear increasingly fraudulent towards the end of the 16th c, but it also becomes a popular literary subject. The following articles, all written by scholars who have previously published valuable contributions on the emergence of fiction and literature, explore the literary dimension of Renaissance demonology: N. Jacques-Lefevre, 'L'ecriture demonologique: un genre defini par ses auteurs memes' (35-56), F. Lavocat, Tarcadie diabolique: la fiction poetique dans le debat sur la sorcellerie (XVIe-XVIIe siecle)' (57-84), A. Blanckaert and F. Ait-Touati, 'Le demon de la litterature ou la construction de la preuve dans des textes demonologiques des XVIe et XVIIe siecles' (85-108), T. Maus de Rolley, 'La part du diable: Jean Wier et la fabrique de l'illusion diabolique' (109-30), T. Chesters, 'Ronsard au carrefour: un nouveau regard sur Psellos et "Les Daimons'" (131-52), J. Ceard, 'Demoneries du XVIe siecle et diableries du XIXe: Collin de Plancy et les demonologues de la Renaissance' (297-312). Patrick Snyder, Trois figures du diable a la Renaissance. Uenfant, lafemme et le pretre, Montreal, Fides, 141 p., is a concise introduction to the realm of Pierre de Lancre, a famous demonologist of the Renaissance. It is also designed to introduce the reader to the culture of fear, with its topoi and figures (child, woman, priest), which characterizes the beginning of Modernity. Didier Kahn, Alchimie et paracelsisme en Frame a la fin de la Renaissance (1367-1625), Geneva, Droz, 806 pp., is a monumental</page><page sequence="13">88 French Studies endeavour composed of three distinct and complementary parts (two of which have still to be published), presenting a cultural history of alchemy and Paracelsism in France at the end of the Renaissance. This first volume presents a polemical etat present, a history of the alchemical texts of the beginning of the Renaissance, and an analysis of the reception of the alchemical phenomenon in France between 1588 and 1625. Subsequent volumes will address the life of alchemists and their cultural milieus. CIEH45 includes M.-M. Fragonnard, 'La memoire de Dieu' (371-92), who seeks to expose the means by which theatrical discourse (between 1530 and 1620) achieves the impossible, that is representing the invisible, and proposes that the figure of a 'Dieu memoire', an interiorized anthropomorphism, is instrumental in the success of this enterprise. C. Mazouer, 'La colere de Dieu dans les tragedies bibliques de la Renaissance* (393-408), begins by exposing the theme of Gods wrath in Renaissance theatre, and then explores the theological scope of the theme, which, he argues, is both tragic and religious. Reformists and Catholics alike have used the wrath of God as a tragic warning against persecution. F. Lestringant, 'Le gouffre et l'atlas, ou la cosmographie infernale de Jean-Baptiste Trento and Pierre Eskrich: La Mappe-monde Nouvelle Papistique de 1566', BHR, 69:561-88, presents an odd document that takes on the pedagogical and performative advantage of the image by exposing the universe of Catholic Rome as a hellish cosmos, from which, not unlike dAubigne s Tragiques, a prophetic new world can emerge. L. tackles an exhaustive analysis of the image that served as Calvinist propaganda. U. Langer, 'Leplaisir litteraire au XVIe siecle: jalons dune approche philosophique', pp. 173-85 of Hedonismes. Penser et dire le plaisir dans VAntiquite et a la Renaissance, ed. Laurence Boulegue and Carlos Levy, Septentrion U.P., 290 pp., addresses French Renaissance literature (mainly Ronsard).

Le peche originel au XVIe siecle, Geneva, Droz, 276 pp.; W., a specialist of the relationship between text and image, studies the iconography of Adam and Eve as the figures of changing conceptions of humanity and as the sum of various issues concerning the human condition. She reveals, among other observations, that texts and images do not offer the same content in regard to Adam and Eve in the 16th c: painters seem more interested by original sin than poets who have a general tendency to minimize the importance of the episode.</page><page sequence="14">The Sixteenth Century 89 RenRy 30.1, Xa felicite chez firasme', ed.

(1-24). Les Geants. Entre mythe et litteraturey ed. Marianne Closson and Myriam White-LeGoff, Artois U.P., 224 p., examines the figure of the giant both as an object of scientific investigation and as an element of fiction. The giant is at once marked by the divine and evil, an ambivalence that has allowed the myth to survive in modern culture. The contributions pertinent to the French 16th c. shed light on the ancient sources of the myth, on the question of alterity that is often associated with the myth, and on the metaphors it has generated. See M. Closson and M. White-Le GofPs concise Introduction' (7-22), N. Balutet, Xes geants sodomites dans les chroniques des Indes occidentals' (61-69), A.-P.

Courcelles, Naturey contains many articles concerned with i6th-c. literature, listed by author. F. Lestringant, &lt;Paysagesanthropomorphiques, (261-77), in an attempt to present a global view of the Renaissance s description of landscape, shows, through the example of Belon, Olaus Magnus, and Rabelais, that anthropomorphical landscapes reflect a hesitation between animist geography and 'ironic fancy' on the power of appearance. Paul J. Smith, 'On toucans and hornbills: readings in Early Modern ornithology from Belon to Buffon', pp. 75-120 of Early Modern Zoology: The Construction of Animals in Science, Literature and the Visual Arts, vol. 1, Leiden, Brill, ed. Karl A. E. Enenkel and Paul J. Smith, xxviii+314 pp., shows that descriptions provided by a variety of observers (from zoologist to mere travellers and collectors) were sometimes, as was the case with Thevet and Lery, more interested in the commercial or cultural value of the birds than in accurate classification of species. Professional zoologists, such as Aldrovandi, Bdon, and Buffon were dependent on very scarce and ephemeral material and had to cultivate a dynamic network of contacts interested in a diversity of activities pertaining to zoology.</page><page sequence="15">90 French Studies *Image and Imagination of the Religious Self in Late Medieval and Early Modern Europe, ed. R. L. Falkenburg, W. S. Melion, and T. M. Richardson, Turnhout, Brepols, 481 pp. J. Parsons, 'Money and merit in French Renaissance comedy', RQ, 60:852-82, explores the heritage of French Renaissance comedy (mostly Odet de Turnebe's works). He explains that Pierre Corneille s Melite (1629) aptly represents the new social conditions of the 'upwardly mobile commoners' who needed to reconcile the ideas of merit, nobility, and the purchasing of status. 7. History and Poetics of Genres (rhetoric, dialogue, narrative, epistolary, drama, poetry) Cecile Alduy, Politique des 'Amours'. Poetique et genese d'un genre francais nouveau (1544-1560), Geneva, Droz, 597 pp. The title of this substantial study of the 'Amours', the French version of the Canzoniere, is certainly misleading, for it is not obviously (the 'French annexation of Laura' is not a fundamental element of the study) the 'polities' of the genre, as Francois Lecercle put it, that interests the author, but mainly the poetics of apparent unity. A. shows with subtlety and precision that the Amours have, from their origins to their more mature stage of development, their own peritextual discourse on harmony and unity, a discourse that accompanies a specific organizational mode. La Memoire des guerres de religion. La concurrence des genres histori ques, XVIe-XVIIIe siecles, ed. Jacques Berchtold and Marie-Made leine Fragonard, Geneva, Droz, 376 pp., is the proceedings of a con ference concerned with questions of history and memory associated with various literary and historical genres. M.-M. Fragonard, 'Une memoire individualisee. Editions et renditions des acteurs et temoins de guerre' (29-66), and 'Annexe. Chronologie des parutions de memoires particuliers (67-86), observes that historians and critics are better informed on the reception of Ancient historians in the Renaissance than on the way contemporary history was written and read during the period. Fragonard's articles expose the many sources of historical writings, all the while insisting on the confrontational dynamics that exists among them, as each manifestation of memory claims a greater degree of truth or aesthetic value. See also M. Penzi, 'Les pamphlets ligueurs et la polemique anti-ligueuse: faux-texte et "vrais faux". Propagande et manipulation du recit (1576-1584)' (133-52). Marie Bouhaik-Girones, Les Clercs de la Basocheet le theatre comique (Paris, 1420-1550), Champion, 309 pp., seeks to understand and analyse</page><page sequence="16">The Sixteenth Century 91 the organization and function of the 'Basoche du Palais' in particular, and of the basoches (a sort of theatrical 'company, a term that the author prefers not to use) in general, as well as the production and influences of authors belonging to various basoches. The period of investigation covers most of the 15th c. and the first half of the 16th. Veronique Dominguez, La Scene et la Croix. Le jeu de Vacteur dans les Passions dramatiques francaises (XlVe-XVIe siecles), Turnhout, Brepols, 326 pp., addresses the representation of the human body in the Mysteries of the Passion. The author sees the play of the actor on the scene as a potential conflict between theology and scholastics, and thus analyses the issues and the consequences of the 1541 and 1548 banning of theatrical performances in France. Dauvois, Ode, includes G. Soubeille, 'La decouverte du chainon manquant. Les Carmina de Jean Salmon Macrin' (13-18). J.-C.

N. Lombart, 'L'invention de 1'ode chretienne en marge de la Brigade: Les odes penitents du moins que rien de Nicole Bargede (1550)' (153-81). This publication offers a study of the theoretical aspects of the ode as a form inherited from the Ancients and the Neo-Latins confronted with an analysis of the French production of sacred and profane poetry {odes, cantiques, psaumes) of the 1550s. Ronsard is the main interest of this collection of essays, for he is considered the most prolific and influential of composers in this practice of the ode. Greiner, Fictions, 1, is an extraordinary piece of scholarship that proposes a comprehensive list of narrative fiction from the Baroque period, between 1585 and 1643. This first volume (of three) covers the period 1585 to 1610 and provides all the information one needs on otherwise inaccessible works. Each entry gives a detailed physical description of the book. The novels (or 'romance') are classified according to pertinent subcategories (sentimental, religious, tragic, dialogues, chivalric adventures, pastoral, etc.), and are efficiently summarized by a team of competent contributors, all specialists in either narrative or fiction. Teresa Chevrolet, LTdee de fable. Theories de la fiction poetique a</page><page sequence="17">92 French Studies la Renaissance, Geneva, Droz, 765 pp., is an impressive endeavour, interested foremost in the emergence of a new theoretical approach to the fable (fiction) during the Renaissance. C. explores, with impeccable scholarship and clarity of expression, the hypothesis that the Renaissance, as a dynamic period for art in general, inverts the ancient and traditional subordination of literary art to philosophy, and gives an extraordinary value to fables and fiction in general. Through her analyses of major theories of the Renaissance, C. launches into the vast problem of hermeneutics and reading during the 16th century. Pascale Mounier, Le Roman humaniste: un genre novateur francais. 1532-1364, Champion, 506 pp., provides a fundamental study of the French narrative of the 16th c, offering a reflection on the essential aspects of the humanist novel, from the term roman itself to the reception of the genre in France and to the elaboration of the distinctive French tradition of the novel. This welcome publication arises in a context of great dynamism for the theory of the Renaissance novel, and contributes significantly to the reassessment of a genre that has been marginalized for many years. P. Mounier, 'Peut-on penser le roman du XVIe siecle?', BHR, 69:381-98, as the rhetorical question of the title clearly indicates, attempts to establish a theoretical basis to apply to the i6th-c. roman, and offers a useful synthesis of the Renaissance discussion on the poetics of narrative. O. Pedeflous, 'La traduction de VAne dor par Guillaume Michel (1517): une contribution a la poetique du roman au XVIe siecle', RHLF, 107:515-35. As many other recent articles and book-length studies have shown, Pedeflous suggests that, for Guillaume Michel, it is the allegorical potential of fables (narratives) that assures the value and the specificity of what is increasingly qualified as roman in the 16th century. Naissance du roman moderne: Rabelais, 'Tiers livre', Cervantes, 'Don Quichotte', Sterne, 'Tristram Shandy, Neuilly sur Seine, Atlande, 324 pp. is a collection of essays prepared for the agregation in comparative literature, in which authors question both the modernity and the inaugural status of these three texts that theoreticians such as Bakhtin and Kundera associate with the modern novel'.

Problematic Ordering in French Renaissance Literature, Leiden, Brill, 246 pp., develops brilliantly the problematic question of dispositio in the prose writing of Rabelais and Montaigne, as well as in the poetry of Marot, Du Bellay, and Belleau. Analysing both the macro- and the micro-structures of key Renaissance texts, S. shows that the topic of dispositio is at centre stage every time the art of rhetoric is concerned, be it to reject it or to enhance it. Katherine MacDonald, Biography in Early Modern France 1540-1630. Forms and Functions, London, MHRA, 115 pp., offers an insightful study of an emerging secular genre in the Renaissance. M. shows that biographers, who have received little scholarly attention compared to their biographical subjects, often practise this form of writing as a mean of self-promotion. M. goes on to establish a link between the self-fashioning strategies employed by biographers and the 'cultural revolution of the bourgeoisie that interested George Huppert and Gilbert Gadoffre. 8. Individual Authors and Works Anthologies and collective works. La Muse lascive: antho logie de la poesie erotique et pornographique francaise (1560-1660), ed. Michel Jeanneret, Corti, 383 pp., tackles a subject which very few scholars are willing to approach, that is the licentious compositions of famous and infamous poets, mainly from the 17th c, although he includes many compositions by Ronsard, Magny, Jodelle, and Beroalde de Verville. J. believes these texts are necessary to give a more complete picture, and to remind readers and literary historians that literature is (or was) employed on occasions as a gesture of dissidence, and that Eros is often the agent of opposition. This anthology reveals, as the editor has hoped it would, a more humane image of the grands siecles of the past. An index of authors, with (even approximate) dates, and a more exhaustive bibliography would have been helpful. La Muse sacree. Anthologie de la poesie spirituellefrancaise, ed. Terence Cave and Michel Jeanneret, Corti, 305 pp., attempts to give a full picture of literature in the Renaissance which is neither entirely profane, nor entirely ludic and joyous. This anthology, presenting poetry first published in collections from 1570 to 1630, excludes well-known authors such as dAubigne or Du Bartas to focus rather on poetry that is</page><page sequence="19">94 French Studies otherwise inaccessible, the result of which demonstrates that religious uncertainty and questioning often provoke intense spirituality. Satyre Menippee de la Vertu du Catholicon d'Espagne et de la tenue des Estats de Paris, ed. Martial Martin, Champion, crxxiii+750 pp., is a great scholarly achievement that includes all the historical explanation, comment, and indexes necessary to approach the difficult literary genre of the Menippean satire which is constituted of multiple traditions and involves many writing strategies and goals. Anonymous. La Creation. Poeme hexameral anonyme du XVIe siecle, ed. Gilles Banderier, Quebec, Laval U.P., 220 pp. In this new edition of the Creation, B. first challenges the attribution of this poem to Agrippa dAubigne, which is, as he demonstrates, most unlikely, although he does not propose a plausible alternative. The main interest of the text, according to B., concerns the reception of Du Bartass La Sepmaine, with which the Creation establishes many links. Agrippa d'Aubign?. Agrippa d'Aubigne, CEuvres. Tome 11. Ecrits politiques, ed. Jean-Raymond Fanlo, Geneva, Slatkine, 824 pp. In his introduction, Fanlo discusses at length the essential elements of this work. The corpus of these political writings is difficult to delineate, as the attribution is not always obvious nor is the definition of the political genre. The other sections of the introduction expose d'A.s political thoughts, recall the context in which the texts were elaborated, and attempt to characterize d A.'s specific rhetorical strategies. Agrippa dAubigne, Hecatombe a Diane, ed. J. Goeury, Saint-Etienne U.P., 240 pp., a new edition of Hecatombe a Diane, the central element of dA/s Printemps, not only provides a more accessible version of d A.s sonnets, but also offers a detailed analysis of the context and the constitution of this collection. *Lire V'Histoire universelW, Journee d'hommage a la me'moire d'Andre' Thierry, ed. Marie-Madeleine Fragonard, Champion, 240 pp. K. S. Maynard, 'Writing martyrdom: Agrippa d'Aubigne's reconstruction of sixteenth-century martyrologyRenR, 30.3:29-50, suggests that dA., in his Tragiques md in his Histoire universelle, is recreating, or rather actualizing, the history of martyrs written by Jean Crespin in 1554, while trying to make the most of experience and direct testimony to the benefit of an 'efficient1 poetry. Z. Zalloua, 'From Le Printemps to Les Tragiques: trauma, self-narrative and the metamorphosis of poetic identity in Agrippa dAubigne', DFS, 81:29-39. The notion of trauma is used by Z. to reassert the genetic importance of St Bartholomew to propel the poet into his mission of warrior-writer, a mission that also pertains to his religious identity. K. Long, "'Child in the water": the</page><page sequence="20">The Sixteenth Century 95 spectacle of violence in Theodore Agrippa d'Aubigne's Les Tragiques\ ib.y 155-65, applies psychoanalysis to Les Tragiques, insisting 011 d'A.'s desire to transmit the trauma to his readers, to transform a mere spectacular and indolent experience into a vivid and painful one. Jean-Antoine De Baif. Jean Vignes, 'Jean Dorat et Jean Antoine de Ban0, pp. 19^45 of Jean Dorat. Paetehumaniste de la Renaissance, ed. Christine de Buzon and Jean-Eudes Girot, Geneva, Droz, vi + 552 pp. Theodore de Beze. Theodore de Beze, Correspondance, tome xxix (1588), ed. Hippolyte Aubert, Geneva, Droz, 326 pp., includes letters from the year 1588. The concise introduction presents some of the historical events pertinent to the letters. Irena Backus, * Theodore de Bdze (1519-1605), Geneva, Droz, 600 pp. R. Hillman, 'Dieu et les dieux dans VAbraham sacrifiant de Theodore de Beze et satraduction anglaise par Arthur Golding', CIEH 45, 225-34, sees a problematic relation between the present and absent God in B.'s Abraham that points to the creation of the human (psychoanalytic) subject. Calvin. Jean Calvin, Brieve instruction pour armer tous bonsfideles contre les erreurs de la secte commune des anabaptistes, ed. Myriam van Veen, Geneva, Droz, 149 pp., the second volume of the Scripta didactica et polemica section in the Opera omnia, has been accomplished with great rigour and precision. The introduction offers some interesting leads on the genesis of the treatise itself, which has been tentatively attributed to Calvin by Farel. Symphorien Champier. Symphorien Champier, La Nef des dames vertueuses, ed, Judy Kem, Champion, 307 pp., benefits from a concise analytical introduction by the editor where she attempts to resituate the text in the context of its conception and reception. T. Hunkeler, 'Symphorien Champier: logique(s) du compilateur', Carlino, Litterature et medecine, 49-63. Hunkelers perspective on Champier supports an intelligent reading not only of the 'polygraph', but also of the cultural context of the Renaissance, which does not often coincide with the groundbreaking image historiography tends to project. H. rightly suggests that C, in his 'mediocrity, or 'uncontemporaneity' is quite useful in revealing the strata of thoughts of the period, which is fundamentally heterogeneous. With regard to C? Hunkeler addresses the notion of'compilation' and proposes an analysis, rarely put forward by other scholars, of the rhetorical techniques or argumentative strategies that are at work in the art of compilation. Gabriel Chappuys. J. Nassichuk, 'Limitation de Ronsard sous la plume de Gabriel Chappuys. L'entree lyonnaise de Henri III', Wagner,</page><page sequence="21">96 French Studies Entrees, 223-54, presents a 'songe' by Gabriel Chappuys that documents the arrival of Henri III in Lyon as the new King of France. N. shows that the poet proceeds with an 'exchange' of good will and promises that involves assuring the convergence of efforts between the king and the artisans of 'memoire eternelle'; royal generosity will inspire poetic deeds commemorating it. C. also manifests an allegiance towards the aesthetic of the Pleiade, and Ronsard in particular, who already represents, in 1574, tradition and continuity. Helisenne de Crenne. M. Thorel, 'Dun "stile poeticque" a 1'autre: la Conqueste de Trebisonde, source des Angoysses Douloureuses, BHRy 69:21-54, suggests that her addition of the Conqueste de Trebisonde (1517) to the list of important sources of H.'s primary sources is not a question of mere erudition, as it reveals the mode of composition of the Angoysses, and confirms the hypothesis of an 'artificial writing' based on a montage of borrowed texts. Dentiere. M. B. McKinley, 'Marie Dentiere: an outspoken reformer enters the French literary canon', King, Women, 113-26, casts further light on a recent article on Dentiere. Jacques-Auguste de Thou. La Vie de Jacques-Auguste de Thou, I. Aug. Thuani vita, ed. and trans. Anne Teissier-Ensminger, Champion, 1085 pp., is a welcome modern edition and French translation of I. Aug. Thuani vita, last edited in 1733. In her introduction (a book-length study), the editor insists on the interdisciplinary components of T.'s text, which are a product of the author's education and social status: juridical, historiographic, and literary. This edition is therefore a useful document for religious, political, and legal history, as well as for any literary investigation related to self-fashioning. Estelle Grouas, Aux origines de la legende noire des derniers Valois: YHistoire universelle de Jacques-Auguste de Thou', pp. 75-87 of Homme de hi etpolitique (XVJe XVIIIe siecles), ed. Hugues Daussy and Frederique Pitou, Rennes U.P., 258 pp., shows that the Histoire universelle by T. is largely responsible for the dark image that emerges from historiography of the last Valois. She points out that T. was mostly interested in presenting the new king Henri IV as a saviour of France, and thus did not hesitate to contrast his idealized qualities with the demonized characteristics of the previous kings. Jean Dorat. Jean Dorat, poete humaniste de la Renaissance, ed. Christine de Buzon and Jean-Eudes Girot, Geneva, Droz, xvi + 552 pp. These proceedings of a conference held in 2001 in Limoges offer a vast panorama of Dorat's career as a famous professor and as a humanist poet. Many contributions address the poetics, religion, and</page><page sequence="22">The Sixteenth Century 97 political allegiances of D., thus offering the possibility of reconstituting the humanist network of the 'second Renaissance'. Attention is also given to D.'s poetics of the ode, his interest in other forms of arts, and to the intertextuality of his work. The volume includes: G.

Pineau, 'Une lecon au Prince: le paysage pyreneen et ses enjeux dans les Sonnets des Neuf Muses Pyrenees de Du Bartas', BSHPF, 153.1:32-46, argues that D.'s sonnets are designed to evoke, through the anthropomorphic metaphor of the mountain-king, both the great power of King Henry of Navarre and the political boundary beyond which he should not step. Du Bell ay. N. Catellani-Dufrene, '"L'adieu aux muses": Joachim du Bellay, traducteur de George Buchanan', BHR&gt; 69:425-33, analyses the translation by D., in 1552, of one of Buchanans elegies (Quam misera sit conditio docentium liter as humaniores Lutetiae) as a testimony of D.'s theoretical reflection, concluding that this translation is emblematic of the works to come.</page><page sequence="23">98 French Studies Pernette Du Guillet. Pernette Du Guillet's Rymes, ed. Chris tian Barataud and Danielle Trudeau, Champion, 2006, 294 pp., are available in this new critical edition, based, like that of E. Rajchenbach (Droz, 2006), on the 1545 Lyon edition. The introduction is not very detailed and relies heavily on biographical notes. Duplessis-Mornay.

Hugues Daussy and Veronique Ferrer, 695 pp. Like many other humanists, D.-M. was convinced that the ability to write should be used to contribute to the Christian community as a whole. This collection of essays illustrates, in four different sections ('Theologie et controverse religieuse', 'Litterature et spiritualite', 'Le combat politique', and 'Amis, famille, activites civiques') how D.-M. s talent and dedication, with the help of his wife, served his fellow countrymen.

Frappier, 'Le spectacle des passions sur la scene humaniste: fonctions et statut de la lamentation dans les tragedies profanes de Robert Garnier', Wagner, Entrees, 319-42. How does Garnier reconcile the poetical need for pathos in tragedy and his desire to put across a stoic philosophy of ataraxy? This article suggests that the apparent contradiction in the design of G.'s works is not yet attenuated, as will be the case in the following century. F. suggests that humanist tragedy resides in the tension created between these two contrasting aims of tragic writings. J.-R. Fanlo, 'Figures de la divinite dans le theatre tragique de Robert Garnier', CIEH45, 353-70, argues that G.'s Les Juifves insists on human despair as a means to increase 'tragic doubt' and the ambiguity of the tragic hero with the addition of the human enigma to that of the divine one. F. also suggests that God is both a saviour and tyrant, and mankind is at once the chosen people and the sinful line of descendants of Adam. It is through a sort of royal sacrificial liturgy that this tragic ambivalence is resolved. Jacques Gohory. J. Brooks, 'Music as erotic magic in a Renaissance romance', RQ, 60:1207-56, exposes in a very interesting article the Renaissance philosophical basis for writing and developing the arts: nurturing the soul. To this end she examines the musical writings (additions to his French translation of Amadis de Gaule and some prefaces to printed music books) of the occult philosopher Gohory and concludes that the alchemical author was instrumental in the making of a court culture in which music and romance were considered more than an amusement. Goulart. Cecile Huchard, D'Encre et de sang. Simon Goulart et la Saint-Barthelemy, Champion, 635 pp., attempts to assemble Goulart's diverse and somewhat eclectic work as a coherent whole with its own logic and structure. She investigates the writing strategies that underlie the composition of Memories de VEstat de France in search of literary tropes and topoi, and historiographical models that inform the style of the work. See also C. Huchard, 'Des Memories de Conde aux Memories de VEstat de France de Goulart. Le role des compilations pamphletaires', Berchtold, Memoire, 87-106, where she shows how the pamphlet compilations have influenced some subsequent history and memoirs, namely G.'s Memories, in a manner that is more often than not advantageous to ideological purposes. Herberay Des Essarts. J.-P. and L. Guillerm, 'Vestiges d'Herberay des Essarts Acuerdo olvido', SFr, 151:3-31. This is a welcome prosopographic endeavour that sheds some new light on an important figure of the Amadis phenomenon in France. Exploring the first</page><page sequence="25">lOO French Studies indications established by Simonin 20 years ago, the authors qualify des Essarts as a figure who, despite having left an indelible mark on the history of literature, never received the full recognition he deserved. Antoine Heroet. Par elevation desprit. Antoine Heroet, le poete, le prelat et son temps. Actes du colloque de Cercanceaux (26-27 septembre 2003), ed. Andre Gendre and Loris Petris, Champion, 470 pp., contains articles showing that H. was an important figure in the history of ideas, literature, music, and fine arts. The detailed introduction by A. Gendre and L. Petris convincingly highlights the subtleties and complexities of Hs work. The volume is divided into four main sections exploring the life of H., his literary career, his main accomplishment (La Parfayte Amye\ and his presence in the visual arts and music. Because of the wide perspective offered on H., this volume is indispensable to any scholar looking for material dedicated to the generation between Marot and the Pleiade. See, in particular, I.

English translations of Louise Labe's sonnets', JES, 37.2:117-37, through an analysis of existing translations, argues that prose translations of L.'s poems are actually more apt to render the instability of love and passion than L.'s original verse. S. supplies some of his own prose translations of Sonnets 8, 18, and 24. C. Griffin, 'La belle cordiere en Espagne. Une decouverte dans les archives de l'lnquisition', RHLF, 107:537-40, unearths a new document related to the Inquisition in Toledo, accusing Juan Franco,</page><page sequence="26">The Sixteenth Century 101 an apprentice in a printers workshop in Lyon, of having compared the image of the Virgin Mary to 'la bel cordial'. The document is presented as a possible confirmation of both L.'s courtesan status and of the hoax status of her works, a connection that requires further reflection. F. Rigolot, 'Paratextual strategy and sexual politics: Louise Labe's Giuvres lyonnaises, Armstrong, Book and Text, 163-75, manages to discuss L.'s publishing endeavour without once mentioning Huchon's recent controversial thesis on the poetess's literary trickery. La Popeliniere. B. Lourde, 'L'avant-discours de VAmiral de France (1584) de La Popeliniere: une defense et illustration de la langue francaise', BHR, 69:103-29, looks at a little-known opuscule by L. which is valuable for its insights into the reception of Du Bellay's ideas at the end of the 16th century. Jean de la Taille. E. Buron, 'L"'art de la tragedie" humaniste comme refus de la "theologie". Saul lefurieux de Jean de la Taille', CIEH 45&gt; 409-35, offers a close reading of T.'s 'art de la tragedie', demonstrating that Saul exemplifies a type of tragedy in which providential discourse is limited to the implicit, and in which theology does not have a voice. In Sauly T. thus refuses to develop a casuistry, or comment on divine justice, preferring to explore the hero's reactions when faced with misfortune. Madeleine de Laubespine. A. Klosowska, 'Madeleine de l'Aubespine: life, works, and auto-mythography: an exchange with Ronsard, ca. 1570-80', FrFy 32:19-39, covers a number of significant aspects of L.'s life, for example as the wife of le sieur de Villeroy, secretary to three kings, and as a learned woman writer who deservedly enjoyed the respect of Ronsard, and did not feel compelled to restrict herself to the topos of feminine modesty. K. progresses one step further arguing that L. purposefully designed her ethos as heroic figure, akin to the masculine figure of the author. K. thus shares Myriam Maitre's and Chloe Hogg's view that women writers such as L'Aubespine, Gournay, and Scudery sought to penetrate the mainstream literary milieu. Francois Le Poulchre. M.-C. Lagree, 'Les avatars du discours sur soi: l'exemple de Francois Le Poulchre (ca. 1546-1597)', Tribout, Narrating the Self 41-52, addresses two rarely mentioned autobiographical texts written by an author who claimed to be a follower of Montaigne, while admitting that he is writing to gain immortality and the admiration of others. Marguerite de Navarre. Marguerite de Navarre, CEuvres completes. Tome vm. Chretiens et mondains, poemes epars, ed. Richard Cooper, Champion, 732 pp., is a volume of varia. C. has done a very good</page><page sequence="27">102 French Studies job in assembling, identifying, dating, classifying, and commenting on texts that were scattered throughout many different documents and collections (epistles, prayers, sonnets, rondeaux, epitaphs, and epigrams). The volume will be of great interest to those searching for new sources likely to shed light on the ensemble of the Queen's work. E. Ahmed, 'Guillaume Briconnet, Marguerite de Navarre and the evangelical critique of reason', BHR, 69:615-25, argues that le Cercle de Meaux organized, through their correspondence, a critique of reason, indivisible from the flesh, according to Briconnet, and thus in opposition to the spirit, a critique which in turn lead to a questioning of the Church and scholasticism. R. Cholakian, 'Marguerite de Navarre: religious reformist', King, Women, 98-109, is an introduction to the teachings of N. as an author of both secular and religious works. R. G. Camos, '"Ses monts trez haultz haulsent notre desir": Marguerite de Navarre, Peletier du Mans poetes de la montagne', Courcelles, Nature, 151-77, explores the many facets of the mountain metaphor in N.'s work (Heptameron, Prisons) and alludes very briefly to P. du Mans's La Savoye. Approaches to Teaching Marguerite de Navarre's Heptameron, ed. Colette H. Winn, NY, MLA, 247 pp., intended as a pedagogical source, is divided into two parts, one dedicated to the review of existing editions and translations, the other to essays offering varying approaches to teaching the Heptameron. Two articles, B. Stephenson, '"La protection de vostre faveur". Le patronage humaniste de Marguerite de Navarre', Wilson-Chevalier, Patronnes, 303-19, and A. Funke, 'Marguerite de Navarre et son influence spirituelle sur les vitraux de la cathedrale Sainte-Marie d'Auch', ib., 321-40, confirm the dedication of M. as a patron of humanist activities, in France and elsewhere in Europe, and as defender of artistic creations dedicated to the advancement of spirituality. O. Millet, 'Surnaturel et divinite dans le theatre "profane" de Marguerite de Navarre', CIEH 45, 271-84, argues that in M.'s profane theatre (LTnquisiteur, Trop Prou Peu Moins, and Comedie de Mont-de-Marsan), what is at stake is the conflict between spiritual life and the mundane world. M. thus dramatizes the sublime effect of the spiritual on human realities and paradoxes. Marot. En relisant VAdolescence Clementine: actes de la journee d'etude du 24 novembre 2006, ed. Marie-Madeleine Fragonard, Pascal Debailly and Jean Vignes (Cahiers Textuels, 30), 182 pp., is the proceedings of a workshop held at the University Paris-Diderot in 2006, on the subject of the 2007 i6th-c. French literature agregation. Although no real unity emerges from the collection, the contributions all aim at presenting the diversity of the poet's inspiration and techniques, and</page><page sequence="28">The Sixteenth Century 103 insist on the poets ambiguous 'simplicity* and on his more official role at the court.

Fontaine, 'Notes sur quelques poemes de VAdolescence Clementine de Marot et les avatars de ses editions de 1538', BHR, 69:157 92. These notes are a series of brief addenda addressed to the 'agregatifs' that culminate in a warning concerning the manner of editing texts of well-known authors. Commenting on Mayer's and Defaux's respective editions of Marot, F. asserts the need for exact and faithful editions that solely supply the basic tools to address linguistic problems, and therefore reduce annotation, especially 'unverifiable hypothesis', to a minimum. C. Bottineau, 'La carole des rondeaux dans VAdolescence Clementine de 1538', JL, 59.2:16-21, considers what type of order is favoured by Marot in his section dedicated to rondeau. She argues that it is a 'danced' structure that is at work, a circular framework that also allows multiple human alliances. C. Thiry, 'Jean Marot revu et corrige" par Clement', LR, 60:17-30, seeks to identify the nature of M.'s intervention on his father's works based on the presence of M.'s use of the 'coupes feminines'. F. Rouget, 'Une version inedite du "Grup" de Clement Marot (?)', SFr, 151:93-97, presents a primitive version of the verse epistle known as the 'Grup', an excerpt of MS Fr. 337 in the Houghton Library, Harvard. D. Duport, '"De pensee joyeuse" ou Le temple de Cupido de Clement Marot', Courcelles, Nature, 141-50, sheds light on the designs of the Temple de Cupido, which, in the guise of a mere literary game, necessitates a reflection on aesthetic and religious norms. M., in other words, goes beyond the topos of the allegorical landscape to suggest a renewed Christian meaning. Pierre Matthieu. Pierre Matthieu, Thedtre complet, ed.

The two-part introduction studies the genesis of the works, their sources and influences. Very little is said about the author and the context of his project and his writing. Montaigne. Philippe Desan, Portraits a Vessai, iconographie de Montaigne, Champion, 351 pp., is a catalogue of over 335 existing portraits of Montaigne. Desan has listed all iconographie representations of M. so as to create a visual 'imaginary' of the essayist. He does not comment on the authenticity of the representations (paintings, engravings, drawings, sculptures), but simply presents the images in chronological order. D.'s introduction establishes the context in which the portraits were created and attempts to interpret M.'s social posture, while evoking pertinent excerpts from M.s Essais where he discusses his appearance in particular or human physical features in general. This book is a good complement to the Album Montaigne (Bibl. de la Pleiade), Gallimard, 285 pp., whose iconographical images were selected and commented upon by Jean Lacouture. Neither a biography nor a study of M.s epoch, it follows, through historical illustrations and portraits, a journey through milestones of M.s life. Philippe Desan, Dictionnaire de Michel de Montaigne, Champion, 1261 pp., is a new edition of the dictionary first published in 2004, with new entries added and existing ones expanded or corrected. P. Desan, 'Montaigne paysagiste', Courcelles, Nature, 39-49, analyses M.s relation to the depiction of landscape and notes that it is only in the subjective appropriation of nature that perspective gains value from M.'s point of view. 'Revelations of Character: Ethos, Rhetoric and Moral Philosophy in Montaigne, ed. Corinne Noirot-Maguire and Valerie M. Dionne, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 247 pp. This collection of essays unites around a montaignian definition of ethos in regard to various definitions proposed by the Ancients, from Plato to Quintilian. Many of the contributions attempt to place M.s appreciation of Ancient authors (such as Seneca or Plutarch) in relation to his understanding of their ethos. As McKinley explains in her enlightening introduction (1-6), M.s understanding of ethos, which each section of the book tries to define from the perspective of diverse and complementary disciplines (rhetoric, politics, ethics, epistemology, philosophy), is a combination of the theories of Socrates and Aristotle, a manifestation, through 'authentic writing style', of the qualities of the soul.

Tilson, 'Vers une eucharistie de melons: 1'etre, la mort et l'ecriture dans l'essai III, 13 de Montaigne', Versants, 51:5-63, shows that, through the Essais, and especially in essay III, 13, M. develops many analogies that put political, theological, and medical discourses at the service of metaphorical statements of retention and purgation of libido. MS, 19.1-2, is entitled 'Les libertins et Montaigne', ed. Giovanni Dotoli. D. delineates, in the introduction 'Les libertins et Montaigne' (3-16), (which was preceded by a thesis on the same subject, Montaigne et les libertins, Champion, 2006), the ambitious project of defining libertine thought, in regards to its world vision. D. is convinced that M.'s Essais played a seminal role in the evolution of libertinism during the 17th c, and seeks with this collection of articles to present a vast panorama of that influence.

Banks, 'Space and light: ficinian neoplatonism and Jacques Peletier du Mans's Amour des amours', BHR, 69:83-101. In response to I. Pantin, B. argues that P.'s love poems are influenced by a particular form of Neoplatonism, one which conceives the divine and the human in terms of spatial immensity and light. Charles Paschal. K. M. MacDonald, 'Diplomacy and biography in the Wars of Religion: Charles Paschal's life of Guy du Faur de Pibrac (1584)', Tribout, Narrating the Self, 23-40. As she has shown in her Biography in Early Modern France, MacDonald states that Paschal, biographer of Pibrac, uses biography as a means of self-fashioning and networking, namely by discreetly positioning himself as a key figure alongside the object of his biographical attention. Pechon de Ruby. Pechon de Ruby, LaViegenereuse desMercelots, Gueuz, et Boesmiens, contenans leurfacon de vivre&gt; subtilitez &amp; Gergon, Mis en lumiere par Pechon de Ruby, ed. Denis Delaplace, Champion, 309 pp., is an edition of a very particular work by an author known only by what is most likely a pseudonym; it employs the 1596 text in an interesting page-setting of editorial interventions, which are neatly isolated so as to allow one to access easily the relevant information. D. also studies, in individual chapters, the title page of successive editions, from 1596 to 1627, the dictionary of French-Blesquien of 1627, and many other historical documents. Pibrac. L. Petris, 'La philosophic morale aux champs: Ethica, GEconomica et Politica dans Les plaisirs de la vie rustique de Pibrac', RHLF, 107:3-18, shows that for P. poetry (especially in the case of his rural poems in Les plaisirs de la vie rustique), is an occasion for ethical reflection, that creates an effective and pleasant context for inspiring man to do good deeds in every area of his life. Rabelais. Bernd Renner, Difficile est saturam non scribere. VHermeneutique de la satire rabelaisienne, Geneva, Droz, 384 pp., analyses the steps through which, from Pantagruel to the Quart Livre, Rabelais masters the art of satire, a difficult art that only a mature writer can bring to perfection as it requires a deep knowledge of the Ancients and an ability to adapt that knowledge to contemporary cultural situations. R. intelligently conveys the importance of the medieval</page><page sequence="32">The Sixteenth Century 107 period as a structural base for the emerging Rabelaisian satire, which establishes itself through a masterful use of parody. This is undoubtedly a fundamental contribution to Rabelaisian studies in particular and to the comprehension of the subtle evolution of satire in general. B. Renner, 'From the "bien yvres" to messere Caster, the syncretism of Rabelaisian banquets', pp. 167-85 of At the Table. Metaphorical and Material Cultures of Food in Medieval and Early Modern Europe, ed. T. J. Tomasik and J. M. Vitullo, Turnhout, Brepols, xx+228 pp., interrogates the change of tone between the early Rabelais' as opposed to the later one (Tiers Livre and Quart Livre) in regard to the carnavalesque setting of the banquet that is characteristic of Pantagruel and Gargantua. He first notes that banquet literature and satire have many elements in common (varietas, dialogism, a mixture of tones, genres, etc.), and are both ety mologically linked to the topic of food and cooking. He shows that R.'s use of the satirical and farcical models is related to his promotion of a polysemic universe. Yann R. Robert, "Tnterprete ce que voudras". Disposition silenique, obsession oculaire et *plus hault sens" dans le Gargantua de Rabelais', FrF, 31.2:1-14, challenges Defaux's interpretation of Alcofribas as a sophist and proposes that R.'s narrator is in fact very concerned by truth, and suffers, in Gargantua, the loss of direct testimony which was his in Pantagruel. E. Bruce Hayes, 'Putting the "haute" back into the "haute dame de Paris": the politics and performance of Rabelais's radical farce', FrF, 32:39-52. In dialogue with Jelle Koopmans, a pioneer in the study of the farce genre, Hayes shows how R. uses the comic techniques of farce, as well as many intertextual citations, to establish a social and religious critique. A. Steczowicz, '"Doctrine moult paradoxe et nouvelle": linguistic and medical innovation in Rabelais's Tiers Livre\ FS, 61:423 33, suggests that paradox, as a 'strange and new' mode of expression, constitutes an experiment on the part of R. employing provocative speech. It is no surprise to S. that the term 'paradox' appears four times out of five in the Tiers Livre, a book where the climate is especially fraught with confrontational views between the traditional and the new. D. A. Rudolph, 'Rereading Rabelais's sacred noise', RenR, 29.4, 2005:23-40, tackles the ever-challenging problem of hermeneutic and writing in the episode regarding the 'paroles gelees' in R.'s Quart Livre. The author suggests that Bible hermeneutics, the Menippean satire and philology are the keys to a better understanding of this episode in particular, and of R.'s works in general. Jack Dixon, *Les Noms de Rabelais. Index des noms propres dans Yozuvre de Rabelais, Geneva, Droz.</page><page sequence="33">io8 French Studies Ronsard. L. K. Donaldson-Evans, 'Ronsard's Folies Bergeres: the Livret des Folastries and Petrarch', Neophilologus, 91.1:1-17, shows insightfully that R.'s Folastries are to be read as a serious state ment of anti-Petrarchism, one that openly disdains the 'tyranny of the Petrarchan mode', and supports the expression of fol amour. I. R. Morrison, 'Ronsard, la Fortune et la Providence: deux elegies au sujet de Mary Stuart, reine d'ficosse', SFr, 151:99-106, an invitation to a close reading of two elegies concerning Mary Stuart, insists on R.s unorthodox relation to 'fortune'. C. Yandell, 'Les roses de Ronsard: humanisme et subjectivite', in Courcelles, Nature, 29-38, introduces the theory that the floral metaphor, and most specifically, the rose motif, are instrumental in the making of the poetic subject and in the constant evocation of the creative process. J. Nassichuk, 'Ronsard mythographe: Avril dans les Amours de 1552', SFr, 152:355-68, illustrates how, in Les Amours of 1552, Ronsard's metaphorical use of spring-like 'avril' converges with personal experience, and directly serves as a source of mythographic writing. E. M. Simon, The Myth of Sisyphus: Renaissance Theories of Human Perfectibility, Fairleigh Dickinson U.P., 614 pp., includes a chapter entitled 'Pierre de Ronsard's perfectibility of sensual love in Les Amours de Cassandre and Sonets [sic] pour Helene (261-90). S. shows that Ronsard's exploitation of the Sisyphus myth tends to support the theory of a therapeutic and poetic relationship with 'suffering love'. A.-P. Pouey-Mounou, 'Dorat, figure de l'experience poetique dans quelques textes de Pierre de Ronsard', pp. 279-92 of Jean Dorat. Poete humaniste de la Renaissance, ed. Christine de Buzon and Jean-Eudes Girot, Geneva, Droz, xvi + 552 pp. Starting with the establishment of a specific definition of 'experience' within the context of poetry, P.-M. explains that D. is not a mere teacher for R., but instead a substitute for the muse-transmitter, and therefore maintaining the fundamental distinction between poetry as an innate art and other forms of writing as learned skills. Jean Thenaud. Jean Thenaud, Traicte de la Cabale, ed. Ian Christie-Miller, Champion, 481 pp. Thenaud's treatise (1521), is, according to the editor, a true 'miroir du prince', a work inspired by theology and politics that confirms the legitimacy of the king's imperial endeavour, and, moreover, contains new sources of knowledge and wisdom that will assure its success. As the detailed, concise, and intelligible introduction reveals, T.'s treatise, didactical in essence, is representative of the syncretic spirit and culture that flourishes throughout the Renaissance, and informs the efforts of Pico della Mirandola and Reuchlin. *Jean</page><page sequence="34">The Sixteenth Century 109 Thenaud, Le Triumphe des vertuz.

Fragonard's introduction is dense, offering all the theoretical and historical tools necessary to appreciate the value of these texts. A section entitled 'Ethos et predication: rhumilite' gives a definition of the homilic genre as well as a reflection on the relation between sacred eloquence and sincerity. Pontus de Tyard, CEuvres completes. Tome vn. La droite imposition des noms (De recta nominum impositione), ed. and trans. Jean Ceard and Jean-Claude Margolin, Geneva, Slatkine, 560 pp., offers one of the last works of importance published by P., De Recta nominum impositione, never re-edited since its first publication in 1603. The Latin text and French translation are on facing pages. Margolin thoroughly reconstitutes all Ancient sources (Plato, Philo of Alexandria, Greek and Hebraic Bible), and undertakes an analysis of P.s nuanced linguistic and philosophical position on the question of the origins of language.</page></plain_text>
