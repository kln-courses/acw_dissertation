<plain_text><page sequence="1">RELIGION AS AN INDEPENDENT VARIABLE: REVISITING THE WEBERIAN HYPOTHESIS' Daniel H. Krymkowski Luther H. Martin Studies in the sociology of religion generally assume "religion" to be causal with little or no attention paid to the theoretical justification or basis for such a claim. We argue in this paper that most such studies fail to satisfy the conditions for causal inference. Further, Weber, whom sociologists of religion often cite when theoretical claims are made, at worse never proposes religion as an independent variable and, at best is very ambiguous on the issue. We suggest that recent directions in cognitive psychology might form the basis for further research concern ing the social significance of religion. 1. The works of Max Weber, along with those Karl Marx and Emile Durkheim, still provide the three fundamental theoretical models for the social-scientific study of religion. Whereas those operating out of the Marxist tradition have argued that religion is a dependent vari able, most contemporary sociologists of religion, especially in the United States, assume—without much theoretical reflection—that religion is an independent variable. That is to say, religious ideas and practices are postulated, especially in statistically based studies, to have a significant effect upon social relationships and material cul ture.2 If any theoretical appeal is made to the assumption of religion as cause by these researchers, it is generally to the work of Max Weber, especially as religion impacts upon economics (Weber 1958: 90). In his oft-cited 1961 study of "Religion's Impact on Politics, Economics, and Family Life", Gerhard Lenski attempted to update 1 An earlier version of this paper was presented at the November 1995 meeting of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion in St. Louis and was the subject of a panel discussion at its November 1996 meeting in Nashville. The authors contrib uted equally to this paper. Email addresses: Daniel.Krymkowski@uvm.edu; lhmartin@zoo.uvm.edu. 2 The case of Durkheim is as ambiguous as that which we will argue for Weber. One might initially associate Durkheim's view of religion as the embodiment of social structures and processes with the Marxist "reductionistic" tradition. On the other hand, Durkheim tended to see religion as a causal factor in his famous study of suicide. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 1998 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 10, 187-198</page><page sequence="2">188 DANIEL H. KRYMKOWSKI AND LUTHER H. MARTIN and confirm this Weberian hypothesis in the context of a mature capitalism (Lenski 1961: 24-26, 289-290). Our own interest in the issue of religion as cause began when we read a 1989 article by Andrew Greeley entitled "Protestant and Catholic: Is the Analogical Imagination Extinct", a paper which is offered as a "reconceptualization" of the Weberian hypotheses (Greeley 1989: 485). In his article, Greeley argued that theological differences between Protestantism and Catholicism caused the varia tion he found when comparing the responses of Protestant and Catholic parishioners on a whole range of attitudinal items. Apart from the theologically derived and unclear usage of the central cat egory of his subtitle, the "analogical imagination" (Tracy 1981), we viewed this paper as flawed, first of all, because the conditions neces sary to infer causation were far from satisfied. These requirements are: that the direction of influence runs from the independent vari able to the dependent variable, that there must be a nonspurious association between the independent and dependent variables, and, that there must be a specified theoretical link between the independ ent and dependent variables. Secondly, Greeley's "reconceptualiza tion" of the Weberian/Lenskian model was less a theoretical recon sideration than a simple reassertion of religion as cause with appeal to Weber. As Richard von Dulman has concluded, although "We ber's thesis continues to be vigorously discussed ... no new produc tive starting points have taken up his initial ideas in all their fullness" (Dulman 1988: 80). 2. Causal modeling of survey data has been very popular in social scien tific research for some three decades now. The substantive origin of this analytic technique can be traced to Blau and Duncan's (1967) pioneering work on social mobility, The American Occupational Structure. Although the difficulties with drawing causal inferences in the ab sence of a controlled experiment are well known (see, e.g., Lieberson 1985), most religion scholars who employ causal modeling have not paid sufficient attention to these difficulties.3 This is very bothersome, 3 There is one often cited study of the effects of intercessory prayer on health that did employ the double-blind controlled experimental technique (Byrd 1988). The author claims to have found that prayer had "a beneficial therapeutic effect in patients admitted to a CCU [Coronary Care Unit]" (Byrd 1988: 826). Such a con</page><page sequence="3">RELIGION AS AN INDEPENDENT VARIABLE 189 for drawing causal inferences in the study of religion is much more problematic than in other areas of social scientific inquiry. Consider for a moment the study of social mobility, which, among other things, is concerned with the effect of social class origins on educational attainment. The direction of influence issue does not loom large here, as one's social class origin obviously comes before one's educational attainment. In addition, the association between origins and education is fairly strong and remains so even after other variables are taken into account. Finally, we have strong theoretical arguments and a body of research to justify the claim that the social class you come from is a determining factor as regards the highest level of education you complete. The situation is much more complicated in the study of religion. After discussing Greeley's work, we perused the issues of the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion (JSSR) since 1986; not surprisingly, we found the causal reasoning framework quite prominent in these pages. Religion was posited to affect things such as abortion attitudes (Jelsen 1988), alcohol consumption (Perkins 1987), alienation (Petersen 1988), health (Levin and Markides 1986), gun ownership (Young 1989), the meaning of work (Davidson and Campbell 1994), opinions about nuclear weapons (Hart 1987), opinions on sexual practices (Cochran and Beeghley 1991), political views (Welch and Leege 1988), prejudice (Ponton 1988), sociability (Ellison and George 1994), socioeconomic status (Homola, Knudsen, and Marshall 1987), stance on the death penalty (Young 1992), suicide (Faupel, Kowalski, and Starr 1987), and tolerance of AIDS victims (Johnson 1987). When the criteria for causality are considered in connection with these research topics, serious difficulties immediately arise. First, the direction of influence issue is problematic. Does religion cause preju dice or does prejudice influence religion, for instance? Is it unreason able, for example, to suggest that people change places of worship in elusion is unwarranted, however. First, there is something very curious about the randomization in the study. The treatment group seems to have higher percentages of patients without clear heart problems (chest pain—cause unknown and syncope), whereas the control group seems to have higher percentages of patients with such problems (acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, supraventricular tachyar rhythmia, valvular heart disease). Taken individually these differences between the groups are not statistically significant, but they may very well be in a cumulative sense. Therefore, outcomes such as the higher rate of congestive heart failure in the control group may be due to initial differences between the groups. Second, the results of this study, to our knowledge, have never been replicated. For further criticisms of this research, see Posner (1990) and Witmer and Zimmerman (1991).</page><page sequence="4">190 DANIEL H. KRYMKOWSKI AND LUTHER H. MARTIN order to find environments more in keeping with their underlying prejudices or ideologies? Second, adequate control variables are often not introduced. Levin and Markides (1986: 31) remark that many of the studies purportedly showing an influence of religion on health utilized zero-order correlations. And, interestingly, a more recent paper on this subject, which utilized proper controls, found religion to have almost no effect on subjective health (Ferraro and Koch 1994).4 Third, the concrete mechanisms by which religion is sup posed to affect various dependent variables are often not adequately specified. Why should we expect the opinions of clergy to influence those of parishioners in the first place? Many American Catholics routinely ignore official teachings of their church; for example, 45% of American Catholics support abortion on demand according to the 1994 General Social Survey (Davis and Smith 1994). We were unable to find a single JSSR article in the ten years between 1986 and 1995 that even came close to satisfying the criteria for causal inference. In general, zero-order associations between measures of religion and various dependent variables were weak to begin with and became weaker when controls were introduced. In the few cases where meaningful associations remained after control variables were taken into account, direction of influence and the specification of mechanisms were not dealt with (see, e.g., Welch and Leege 1988). We feel that this whole line of research is lacking a very important component: theoretical competence. Although Weber and/or Lenski are often cited as justification for viewing religion as cause, this is far from sufficient, as we shall argue later. Further, we believe that this absence of theory explains why the associations uncovered are often small in magnitude, especially when factors other than religion have been taken into account. After a good deal of thought, we have come to believe that reli gion, operationalized in standard ways, is not likely to exert inde 4 Dr. Dale Matthews of Georgetown University, reporting on 212 such articles at the 1996 annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Sci ence, concluded that three-fourths showed a positive effect of religion on health, whereas seven percent indicated a negative effect (Burlington Free Press 1996). In re sponse to this, Dr. Jeffrey Levin of Eastern Virginia Medical school proclaimed that "if God heals, it's a matter of faith. We can't prove it" (Burlington Free Press 1996). However, as we indicate in the text, the jury is still very much out on whether associations between religion and health are causal (Levin 1994), and the mecha nisms linking the two are still not agreed upon (Ferraro and Koch 1994).</page><page sequence="5">RELIGION AS AN INDEPENDENT VARIABLE 191 pendent causal influence on attitudes and behavior (McGuire 1994: 191-192, 194-195). Consider some of the measures most often used: Protestant vs. CathoEc affiliation and attendance at religious services. In what respects do Protestants and Catholics significantly differ these days especially, in the United States? For the most part, Catho lic immigrants have assimilated into the Protestant-shaped American culture and are not readily distinguishable (Herberg I960; Pula 1995: 146). In a similar vein, why should we expect churchgoers to differ in significant ways from those who do not attend religious services? For Americans, going to church seems not unlike participation in any other special interest group. To put it succinctly, religious institutions are but one small part of the larger social matrix of institutions in the United States, all of which reflect and reinforce dominant cultural values. Isolated from this matrix, religion is unlikely to act as an independent variable having a major impact upon individuals. Moreover, resorting to non-traditional measures of religion is not likely to solve this problem. For instance, Welch and Leege (1988: 537) examined "religious imagery" in their study of the effect of religion on pofitical attitudes. One important independent variable in their research was a measure of whether the respondent sees God primarily as a judge (Welch and Leege 1988: 541). But why is this necessarily a religious beEef? First of all, beEeving in God seems to have more to do with being an American than with being religious, since about 95% of Americans claim to have some sort of a beEef in God (Herberg 1960; Davis and Smith 1994). Given this statistic, nearly all of us must have some conception of God, and the anthro pomorphic view of God as a judge might therefore be as much a part of a "poEtical imagination" as an aspect of Greeley's (1981) "reEgious imagination" (Guthrie 1994). Does this mean that religion can never be understood as a cause? No, but causal modeling with traditional cross-sectional data is un likely to be very profitable. Establishing reEgion as cause will require, to begin with, retrospective Efe history or longitudinal data, attention to the spuriousness issue and, perhaps most important, theoretical competence.5 What then about the Weberian model to which studies 5 Actually, the problem is potentially even more serious. We agree with the theo retical physicist and philosopher of science, Mario Bunge, who argues that scientists in general should realize that causal explanations constitute only one type of expla nation. In fact, there are a number of other ways to answer "why" questions (Bunge 1979; Chapter 11). Further, Sobel (1996: 365) has shown that this type of modeling</page><page sequence="6">192 DANIEL H. KRYMKOWSKI AND LUTHER H. MARTIN assuming religion as cause most often appeal? 3. Does Weber, in the first place, posit religion as causal? He is inter ested in the historical role of ideas generally (Weber 1958: 90) and apparently he intended a cause-and-effect relationship between Prot estant ethics and the capitalist spirit. He writes, for example, that "the principle explanation of th[e] difference [between Protestants and Catholics] must be sought in the permanent intrinsic character of their religious beliefs" (Weber 1958: 40). And, he clearly states that the "rational ethics of ascetic Protestantism" exists in a "causal rela tionship" to the spirit of capitalism (Weber 1958: 27, 31, 56). How ever, any single-factor causal theory of historical and social change was rejected by Weber (Garth and Mills 1946: 47, 376), who empha sized instead "the inexhaustible complexity of causal pluralism" (Garth and Mills 1946: 34). In his essay on "The Social Psychology of the World Religions", Weber writes that "[n]o economic ethic has ever been determined solely by religion. . . . The religious determina tion of life-conduct ... is also one—note this—only one, of the determinants of the economic life" (1946: 268). And, in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, he writes that he is: "attempting to clarify the part which religious forces have played in forming the developing web of our specifically worldly modern culture, in the complex interaction of innumerable different historical factors" (1958: 90). On the next page, however, Weber avers that: We have no intention whatever of maintaining such a foolish and doc trinaire thesis as that the spirit of capitalism . . . could only have arisen as a result of certain effects of the Reformation, or even that capitalism as an economic system is a creation of the Reformation (1958: 91). What then is the place of religion vis-a-vis economic systems for Weber? The Japanese scholar, Kanai Shinji, has noted that whereas Weber clarifies an "affinity between Protestant ethics and the spirit of involves a counter factual that is difficult to sustain. He argues that social scientists should thus be content with describing associations. And Lieberson (1985: chapter 2) notes that selectivity effects make it difficult to get an accurate measurement of associations when one is dealing with survey data, even with statistical controls. Also, we would like to point out that social scientists often sweep another problem with survey data under the rug: the reliability and validity of responses to survey ques tions. For a treatment of the problems involved with the measurement of church attendance, for example, see Smith (1997).</page><page sequence="7">RELIGION AS AN INDEPENDENT VARIABLE 193 capitalism ... he does not show corroborating evidence of a histori cal cause-and-eifect relationship between the two" (1991; cited by Makoto and Hiroshi 1993: 226). In the conclusion of Werner Cahnman, Weber was interested in "functional interrelationships" rather than in "a simple cause and effect sequence" (Cahnman 1995: 61). And most interestingly, in his recent study of Weber and politics, John Patrick Diggins characterizes the relationship of religion and economic systems as an "irony of unintended consequences" whereby these two historically independent institutions are related in that: one proceeds from the other but not necessarily by design or intent. . . . In history causes do not always resemble their effects and human motive and purposes do not always impose their character and design on things. . . . Weber [Diggins concludes] asked us to consider Puritans as agents of their own thought and actions, but his sense of irony and contingency precluded him from establishing causal relations in the form of laws that explain the emergence of capitalism as a necessary occurrence. (1996: 118-119) In Weber's analysis, the unintended consequence of American Puri tanism with its ideal of the covenanted community was a moral, if secular, individualism and voluntarism. This voluntarism places the individual in the purposive activity of the group, a commitment un known in Europe where morality is associated with community. It is this morality of voluntaristic individual commitment to the larger purpose of a given group, whether that group be a religious activity, a political rally or a football game, which Weber understood to mo tivate both religion and capitalism in America (Weber 1985, cited by Diggins 1996: 38). In his "Introduction" to the English edition of Weber's Sociology of Religion, Talcott Parsons notes that it was "the question of how to conceive the operation of religious ideas [that] became central" to Weber's problem. Like his contemporary, Emile Durkheim, Weber recognized that if sociology were to be a science in which certain factors may be held as constants, it required a methodological alter native to the experimental method, which both agreed could not be employed in the study of social life. Whereas Durkheim found this alternative in statistical analysis (Hughes et al. 1995: 177), Weber, as Parsons concludes: early became acutely aware, as many participants in the discussion still are not, that the problem of causation involved an analytical problem,</page><page sequence="8">194 DANIEL H. KRYMKOWSKI AND LUTHER H. MARTIN one of the isolation of variables and the testing of their significance in situations where they could be shown to vary independently of each other. . . . [Weber's] methodological equivalent of experimental method, in which it is possible to hold certain factors constant. . . proceeded from his realization that without comparative evidence he could not hope to progress in the solution of his original central ques tion. (Weber 1963: xxi) That is to say, Weber's hypothesis of religion as cause was one of historical analysis controlled by cross-cultural comparative data and not, as in the Durkheimian tradition, one leading to quantifiable research within a particular social context. The history of religion, for Weber, was less an explanatory datum than an indicator of what today we might term mentalités, a tradition of historical theory in which Weber might well be included. Whether logically or historiographically valid or not, the causal claim further begs the definitional question. What is required is not the explanation of some social effect by religious cause but, first, a definition of religion itself. In his Sociology of Religion, Weber seems to offer a subjectivist definition: [t]he external courses of religious behavior are so diverse that an under standing of this behavior can only be achieved from the viewpoint of the subjective experiences, ideas, and purposes of the individuals con cerned, or, in short, from the viewpoint of the religious behavior's "meaning". (1963: 2) But he precedes this typically nineteenth-century view of religion with the procedural advice that it "is not possible at the start of a presentation such as this (to say what it [religion] is). Definition can be attempted, if at all, only at the conclusion of the study (1963: 1)". In other words, "religion", according to Weber, is understood first of all as the consequence of sociological theorizing. And, it must be kept in mind that Weber's analysis of religion remains a part of his larger work on Wirtschaft und. Gesellschafi with its "comprehensive analysis of social action in the contexts of law, politics, economics, classes, status groups, large-scale organizations, and so forth" (Cahnman 1995: 62). Consequendy, any view of religion as an independent variable re mains, on appeal to Weber, somewhat questionable. 4. In addition to greater theoretical competence in the formation of the social science research project which would establish more sophisti</page><page sequence="9">RELIGION AS AN INDEPENDENT VARIABLE 195 cated controls and which would address explicitly the causal mecha nisms by which religion might affect dependent variables, we would like, in conclusion, to suggest a theoretical alternative for investigat ing the relationship between religion and its larger social context. Similar to Weber and Durkheim, exponents of cognitive psychology have recently argued that religion is a social system generated and structured by the same processes from which any social system is produced, with the sole difference that it is characteristic of religious systems to claim legitimation by superhuman powers (Lawson and McCauley 1990: 89; Boyer 1994: 36, 426). If this is the case, then religious systems are, apart from their specifically counterintuitive claims, indeed indistinguishable from the social matrix —precisely the same problematic of "religious ideas" that was central to Weber's historical project (Weber 1958: 90). Like Durkheim, Weber did con clusively demonstrate that religion is a social fact and must be ac counted for by its social nature. But the problem, identified some thirty-five years ago by Will Herberg and still unresolved in social scientific study, remains, namely, ascertaining precisely which religious ideas are, in fact, op erative in any given society. Such operative beliefs often stand in contrast to the formal beliefs of that society, that is, those beliefs that people believe they believe and, consequently, will tell you they be lieve when asked what they believe (see, e.g., Welch and Leege [1988]). For example, Justin Barrett has recently demonstrated a fundamental incompatibility between the Western "theological [con cept of a transcendent] God" as "wholly-other", and the cognitive based anthropomorphic god of everyday human discourse (Barrett and Keil 1996). It is, in other words, one thing to enumerate the nature and function of formalized beliefs and practices through social science queries and quite another to discover which religious ideas, whether formal or intuitive, make any difference at all—a difference 6 We believe that Lawson and McCauley (1990), Boyer (1994), and Guthrie (1994) are among the few truly scientific studies of religion. Unfortunately, sociologists often take the misguided approach of generating and then trying to account for variation in a dependent variable. As Lieberson (1985: Chapter 5) points out, explaining variation may not be the best way to understand the phenomenon of interest. Also, this is not the approach used by physical scientists, who seek to limit variation and thereby bracket and simplify the problem they are studying. Bunge (1979: 129) puts it well: "The best grasp of reality is not obtained by respecting fact and avoiding fiction but by vexing fact and controlling fiction". Given the remarkable accomplish ments of the physical sciences, sociologists might want to pay attention to some of its methods; very few sociologists do at present (or have ever done so).</page><page sequence="10">196 DANIEL H. KRYMKOWSKI AND LUTHER H. MARTIN hitherto most effectively pursued in historical research. Weber's ques tion concerning the historical role of religious ideas in the general social matrix might now be explored in a complementary way by asking the cognitive question of why human beings persist in making, transmitting, and even producing anew formal beliefs at all—even, by the way, those modern societies that have undergone the Weberian requisite of secular development.
