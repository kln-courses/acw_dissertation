Belated notice is hereby taken of the publication by David McKay Company of the third volume of Dietrich Von Hildebrand's Christian Ethics. The present work is entitled Graven Images: Substitutes for True Morality. Its contents have been de scribed aptly as involving "a disentan glement of morality from mores." Like its predecessors, Christian Ethics and True Morality and Its Counter feits, the present volume can be read as a comparatively independent unit, al though its significance would be en hanced if read in the light of the former volumes. Following the pattern of his previous volumes on Christian ethics, Von Hildebrand reserves the concluding chapter for a formal discussion of the unique character of Christian morality, now seen against the background of substitutes for morality, as in his sec CROSS CURRENTS ond volume it was viewed against the background of counterfeits of morality. That Christian morality is unique among moral systems and ideals, and that a Christian ethics is possible, which is neither moral theology nor a purely natural ethics, are the two general themes stressed by Von Hildebrand in each of his works on ethics. Once again the phenomenological method is employed, and again in a per sonalist context, but always in a strictly philosophical way. There is evidence of close scrutiny of the data and of ac curate psychological observation, but the results cannot be explained in terms of mere description or even of general, ab stract norms as applied to concrete cases. Instead, we have here, as elsewhere in the ethical writings of Von Hildebrand, a strictly philosophical analysis of the formal and material eide of morality and a moral typology of a personalist nature, which it is hoped will eventual ly find its way into courses in scholastic ethics, expanding their content and cor recting some of their basic approaches to certain fundamental problems. This does not imply, of course, that Von Hil debrand can be classified as a neo-scho lastic philosopher. It does mean, how ever, that he philosophizes as a Cath olic and that his thought represents a contribution to the philosophia peren nis, if the term be not understood in a narrow sense. In True Morality and Its Counter feits, Von Hildebrand dealt with dis torted interpretations of true morality, pharisaism and self-righteousness on the one hand and situational ethics and "sin mysticism" on the other. In the present volume, his concern is with ideals of conduct to which allegiance is often giv en with a sense of obligation attaching to them that is proper only to the moral sphere while the ideals in question are not as such moral ideals, although they</page><page sequence="4">NOTES ON OTHER PUBLICATIONS may be admixed with certain moral con notations. Such, for example, are the ideals of honor, tradition, self-control, the law of the state, altruism, gentleman liness. Such ideals are often in part shown to be compatible with immorali ty so long as the moral values involved in any particular situation are not di rectly concerned with the chosen ideal. As always is the case with Von Hilde brand, a seemingly endless series of dis tinctions among attitudes and types, to gether with subdivisions of these, are made, but the distinctions are not hair splitting, but illuminating. Nor are they distinctions of an abstract order, but of a concrete and personalist character. They represent disentanglements neces sary on both the theoretical and prac tical levels to make true morality com prehensible in its real essence and loved according to its true worth. A work such as this, like True Morality and Its Counterfeits, is also extremely relevant to the questions relating to the problem of psychiatry and morality and can readily be adapted to a partial exami nation of conscience on the part of the individual who would discern ungenuine motives and false ideals intermingled with his understanding and practice of true morality. (B.C.) New Jewish Theology. In the March 1958 issue of Commentary, Judd L. Teller registers a sharp criticism of the "New Jewish Theology," particularly as it is expressed in the writings of Will Herberg. Writing as a Jewish secularist, Mr. Teller maintains that the new American Jewish theology is inconsis tent with the essence of historical Juda ism as well as being a threat to "secular freedoms." Teller is especially critical of Herberg's reliance on the Christian as this has led Herberg to suggest an theologian Reinhold Niebuhr inasmuch 383 involvement of Judaism with Christian ity that is not supported by Jewish his tory and tradition. Herberg's emphasis upon "sin" and "salvation" is not an emphasis reflected in traditional Juda ism, according to Teller. Nor is the "new theology" meeting the needs of Ameri can Jews, in Mr. Teller's opinion, since "American Jewry does not require ad monition about 'sin,' but instruction in its own traditions." Mr. Teller is equally disturbed by what he describes as the "anti-liberal and anti-secular attitudes" of these Jew ish existential theologians. It is his con tention that "the great gains of the Jews in American society are the fruit of American secularism," and for this rea son he views Herberg's anti-secular the ology as a menace to those gains. Despite the intensity of his dissent, Mr. Teller concedes that "the new the ology, and Will Herberg's specifically, has contributed appreciably to the growth in self-awareness of the Ameri can Jewish community, by advancing challenging theses which compel the American Jew to study the basis and essence of his Jewish affiliation." (G.F.) Tradition. It is a pleasure to call at tention to the semi-annual Tradition whose first issue has just appeared as a vigorously Orthodox journal of Jewish thought. Rabbi Norman Lamm, the editor, calls Orthodox tradition "a commitment by the past to the future.... the cumula tive historical experience and wisdom of the people of Israel and the totality of its divinely revealed insights and mor al injunctions and ethical imperatives and religious instruction." Tradition is happily partisan in thought and tone. Rabbi Emanuel Rack man's "Arrogance or Humility in Pray</page><page sequence="5">384 er" centers on the "contrast between the attitude of the traditionalist and that of the Reformer and Reconstructionist" toward Israel's prayer book, the Siddur. The latter modernize the Siddur; the former will not let a jot or tittle pass. Rabbi Rackman ably defends prayerful reference to animal sacrifice on the ground that it unites the modern Jew with the actions of the saints and sages; locates the Law's seeming contempt for women in the notion that for men to "learn to sanctify time, the Law or dains ... many commandments which are governed by a calendar and a clock," but women " by the very nature of their physical constitution and the re quirements of the Law with regard to their menstrual periods, needed little more to make them aware of the sanc tity of time"; indicates how attempts to eradicate anthropomorphism can result in a subtler anthropocentrism; points out that the phrase "Chosen People" excludes neither the Jew's obligation to elect to be chosen, nor the possibility of another Nation's so electing; and, to those who find the millenium in the State of Israel, says that the traditional ist prayer for a return to Zion is also a prayer for a more comprehensive re turn to God that will usher in the Mes sianic Age. Rabbi Rackman's concluding sen tences are imbued with the sense of tradition described above: "Cannot one . . . pray for schools in Babylon, and thereby bring the impact of their his toric roles to bear upon the present.... Must the sins of the atomic bomb and Nazi and Communist cruelty be spelled out? Who but fools would not think of Hitler and Stalin as they read the verse of the Haggadah, 'Pour forth Thy wrath upon the nations that know Thee not!' " For those of us discomforted by the last question, which brings what we tolerate in the mist of history into the glare of the present, this new and Orthodox CROSS CURRENTS friend may have a special message.

Abb£ Orai son's recent book with this title, pub lished in Paris by Editions Spes, stresses the need for religious educators to util ize the contribution offered by modern psychology. The author insists on a dis tinction between the philosophy of a psychologist and the facts which he has brought to life: the latter must not be evaded. Although Abbe Oraison was himself a doctor and practicing psychiatrist be fore he became a theologian, his learn ing here is placed in the service of an informal survey of psychological insights for good religious education, with par ticular emphasis on the mistakes made by parents in early years. He begins by defining man not as "rational animal," but rather as "a concrete history," a "bundle of dynamisms" which is con tinually developing and integrating into a personal self. Abbe Oraison emphasizes that the emotions are obviously much stronger than the rational life in the infant and child. Because this is so, one cannot educate by inculcating principles, but must help a child establish a healthy emotional relationship to these realities of life, thereby furthering his own self integration. It is the proper task of edu cation to open the child's eyes and at the same time to ease his emotional ad justment to the new knowledge. If it is to deserve its name, religious education must be education itself, encompassing all the realities of human existence. The most important reality of which he must be made conscious—and which he must experience—is that which distin guishes him from other creatures, his</page><page sequence="6">NOTES ON OTHER PUBLICATIONS freedom. Education consists in protect ing and increasing the freedom of the future adult, for it is through the use of freedom alone that man can fully de velop his nature. Perhaps the greatest value of Oraison's book is its detailed presentation of the actual mistakes and successes of parents. The author's knowledge and experience 385 as both theologian and psychiatrist are apparent in admirable fusion, but his style is colloquial. It should be enlight ening to all parents and educators.
