<plain_text><page sequence="1">WARBURTON AND THE ENCYCLOPEDIE CLIFTON CHERPACK NE of the most vexing aspects of the systematic investigation of the Encyclopedie is the question of ultimate sources. Allusions to the problem abound; and, although much has been done in this vein since le P. Berthier had the pleasure of pointing out the eclectic redac- tion embodied in the first volume, the sources of many important articles, and, consequently, their function in the publication, are still a mystery to us.' Students of the Encyclopedie will have observed that, while a few scholarly articles have dealt directly with lists of works used by the editors,2 their borrowings are usually brought to light in the course of synthesizing studies of specific subjects or individuals as treated in scattered sections of the bulky work. The present article, however, will follow a different tack. I propose to start with a fecund source, the translations of part of the writings of William Warburton, and to describe the adaptations and modification of this material by Diderot and his colleagues according to their editorial needs and philosophic interests. The basic fact that Warburton was an indirect contributor to the Encyclopedie is, of course, not unknown. Hubert,3 Godin,4 Thiele- mann,5 and Doolittle6 have mentioned his name in connection with those articles in which specific attribution is made by the editors. What is not known is that Warburton was utilized without acknowledgement in many other articles, and that numerous ideas in them, which have been considered by scholarly analysts of the work as of capital impor- tance in the search of the philosophes for an enlightened theory of man, were actually taken from a massive defense of orthodoxy by this Anglican divine. Warburton came to literary prominence in England with his vindi- 1 For a discussion of the problem of source material in the E., see Lois S.

This defense had for the author the double result of arousing a good deal of discussion in England, and of securing Pope's firm friendship and lasting support.7 These boons were of considerable help to a man whose position as "the dictator and tyrant of literature" in the middle of the eighteenth cen- tury, to use Gibbon's words, seems to have been due more to the force of his personality and to literary politics than to the recognized merit of his writings. For, although Warburton's meaty and paradoxical Divine Legation of Moses touched off a frenzy of pamphleteering and debate, the theories adduced therein were so savagely ripped from con- text and pulled to pieces by critics that their full force and value were dissipated and their influence slight in the country of their origin.8 It was not to be so in France. Although, as in England, Warburton's name became known on the continent by virtue of the quarrel over Pope, his more important theories found favor in France thanks to three factors-the privileged position of English erudition at the time, the existence of a societe de gens de lettres whose role it was to collect interesting ideas and to effect their circulation, and, of course, the zeal of translators, the invaluable middlemen in this literary and philosophi- cal traffic. It was lgtienne de Silhouette, a young student of English political economy and author of the translation of the Essay on Man which was used by Crousaz, who introduced Warburton to French readers in 1742 with a translation of his vindication of Pope. Convinced of War- burton's genius, he followed this the same year with the Dissertations sur l'union de la religion, de la morale, et de la politique,9 closely adapt- ed from parts of the first three books of the Divine Legation and the Alliance between Church and State. Two years later, Leonard de Malpeines translated much of the fourth book of the Divine Legation as an Essai sur les hieroglyphes des Egyptiens.10 That the theories contained in these works were widely read and well thought of in France is shown by the fact that at least twenty-three articles in the Encyclopedie, written by such persons as Diderot, D'Alembert, Jau- court, Beauzee, Formey, Romilly fils, and Abbe Yvon, are drawn from these two translations. The thesis of the Divine Legation is that the divinity of the Mosaic dispensation, so insistently attacked by freethinkers, is proved by the 7 The whole affair is treated in detail by E. Audra in his L'Influc;tce fran- Caise dans l'wuvre de Pope (Paris, 1931). 8 For Warburton's life and influence in England, see A. W. Evans, Warburton and the Warburtonians (London, 1932). 9 London, 1742, 2 vols. 10 Paris, 1744, 2 vols. The second volume is a compilation by the translator of various remarks on chronology and Chinese writing, most of which substantiate Warburton's theories. 227</page><page sequence="3">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE fact that, although in all societies from the earliest the doctrine of a future state of rewards and punishments has been held essential to the well-being of society, the Jewish religion and society, ruled by Mosaic law which contains no such doctrine, subsisted. It must, there- fore, have been divinely supported, and the dispensation must have been divinely inspired. Thus, it was incumbent upon Warburton to adduce, from his vast reading, proofs of the universality and antiquity of the doctrine of punishments and rewards. This naturally led to a history of religious thought ab origine, to investigation of the beginning of so- ciety, and to a consideration of the ways in which religion and the state have been and should be allied. All these matters, of great interest to the philosophes, are treated at length in the sixteen Dissertations as translated by Silhouette. One of the articles in the Encyclopedie which draws most heavily from this translation is "Ame," edited by Abbe Yvon. Many sources have been mentioned for this widely studied article. Gaudin,ll for example, mentions the thirteenth Lettre philosophique, and remarks that the Encyclopedie itself acknowledges its debt to a treatise by Jaquelot. Verniere asserts that Yvon copied seven pages from the anonymous Sentiments des philosophes sur la nature de I'ame which appeared in the rare collection, Nouvelles libertes de penser, in 1743.12 Warburton has never been mentioned as a source, but a confrontation of texts makes it obvious that Yvon quoted from some seventy-two pages of the tenth and eleventh dissertations. The borrowings begin in the second paragraph of the article and continue for three pages.l3 Thus, the whole discussion of the opinions of the pagan philosophers concerning the multiplicity of the soul and of divine beings, of apoca- tastasis as a doctrine developed by oversubtle Greeks from the mis- understanding of an Egyptian idea, of the role of the Egyptians as originators of religious and philosophical ideas, and of the primim vivere deinde philosophari attitude of the Egyptians as compared to the Greeks, is drawn from Warburton.14 There are, of course, some modifications. Yvon omits all footnotes, several supporting citations, and a short attack on Toland, while adding an attack on Spinoza, when Warburton mentions him, and some remarks on the corruption of religion in the contemporary Orient. Further on in the article, after a discussion of Leibnitz, Spinoza, Hobbes, Locke, and Wolf, Yvon returns to the Dissertations, and, with a few added transitions, quotes from twenty-two of its pages further opinions of the ancients con- cerning the soul and immortality.15 11 Op. cit., pp. 140-141. 2 "Le Spinozisme et I'Encyclopedie," RHL, LI (1951), 350. 13 Encyclopedie, ou Dictionnaire raisonne des sciences, des arts, et des metiers (Paris, 1751-65), I, 327a-330b. 14Diss.

Beginning with the paragraph which opens, "Les athees pretendent que le culte religieux rendu a des hommes apres leur mort est la premiere source de l'idolatrie.. .," the editor borrows section after section of both volumes of the Dissertations wherein it is decided that, before heroes were worshipped, the stars, being influential natural phenomena, were the object of man's adoration.22 Here the editor adds a few remarks on Zoroastrianism and the Church Fathers' ignorance of astronomy, and reproduces a long passage from a Greek philosopher to which War- burton only refers. He then copies Warburton's explanation of the manner in which the cult of heavenly bodies was combined with that of heroes in the evolution of religious thought.23 The subsequent ref- utation of Pluche's theory, set forth in the Histoire dui ciel, that the gods were only hieroglyphic symbols for agricultural lore is derived from an entirely different section of the translation.24 Here is quoted Warburton's theory that the mysteries taught the initiates that the gods were only deified men. The supporting citations from Eusebius and Pope were also taken from Warburton, but the editor, presum- ably Diderot, has replaced Silhouette's prose paraphrase of Pope by 16 Les Sciences sociales, p. 37. 17 Ibid., pp. 50-51, 242. 18 Ibid., p. 245. 19 E., II, 69a. 20 E., XIII, 512b; Diss., II, 106. 21 E., XIII, 512b-513b; Diss., II, 108, 110-111, 124-126. 22 E., XII, 955-956; Diss., II, 201-209. 23E., XII, 957; Diss., II, 211-212. 24 E., XII, 957-958; Diss., I, 237-258. 229</page><page sequence="5">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE a verse translation. Then the editor departs from Warburton to dis- cuss the corrupting effects of mythology on society, and Bayle's views on idolatry, but returns to the Dissertations for the idea that early legislators, who had supported polytheism to encourage veneration of the laws, were forced to evolve the mysteries, in which monotheism was actually taught to the initiates.25 Again the double doctrine is stressed, along with the perspicacity of what Paul Hazard called the "Sage Egyptien"; and, although Toland is chided for wishing to un- dermine all revealed religion, his thesis that all religions have their ultimate roots in idolatry is indirectly supported. Scholars have found these borrowings important elements in the Encyclopedists' theory. The refutation of Pluche is seen by Hubert as a reflection of their "theorie naturaliste," while the description of the corruption of religion under the Greeks is held to be an inevitable concomitant of the philosophes' systematic denial of the "miracle grec."26 Hubert also feels that the statement that a belief in a first cause preceded any form of idolatry, another transcribed idea, is not a cautious concession to the theory of degenerescence. It fits, he thinks, into Diderot's philosophy, as does the refutation of the deos fecit timzor argument. He takes the assertion that the worship of natural forces preceded the cult of heroes or allegorical gods as proof that Ducros was wrong in accusing the Encyclopedists of ignoring the role of this "naturalisme utilitaire." After discussing the many arguments taken from the Dissertations in favor of the utility of religion, he says that such a view "resulte manifestement de la faqon dont les Encyclopedistes ont conqu la nature et la fonction de la religion."27 Barker thinks the article important enough to merit a summary in his book, and Gaudin supposes that the reference to Toland is illustrative of Diderot's dislike for him. What has been overlooked, then, in the Divine Legation takes on significance when copied by the Encyclopedists. Abbe Yvon, who, as we have seen, did not bother to mention War- burton in "Ame," seems anxious in "Athees" to acknowledge his debt; for in this article, one of the three involving the Dissertations which di- vulge their source, he mentions Warburton three times.28 The bor- rowings begin with the consideration of Bayle's famous proposition that idolatry is more pernicious to society than atheism. In refutation, Yvon copies most of Warburton's second dissertation.29 The bishop's three moral principles, "... le sentiment moral, la difference speci- fique des actions humaines, et la volonte de Dieu... ," are discussed, and it is decided that atheists, bereft of the last principle, cannot be 25 E., XII, 963-964; Diss., I, 188-191. 26 Les Sciences sociales, pp. 49, 66-67, 265. 27 Ibid., p. 232. 28 E., I, 802, 813, 815. 29 E., I, 804-813; Diss., I, 62-112. 230</page><page sequence="6">WARBURTON AND THE ENCYCLOP?IDIE truly virtuous. This argument is also briefly summarized by Romilly fils in the article "Vertu," where Warburton is given credit. Yvon, who follows his source in discussing the strength of passion and the weakness of unsupported virtue, abridges the argument considerably, and adds some remarks of his own on false virtue. He then interpolates an attack on Shaftesbury from the eighth dissertation30 and, to prove the universality of the doctrine of the afterlife, also uses examples from the fourth dissertation.31 After mentioning Warburton's concept of the mysteries, he returns to the second dissertation for the argument that the virtuous nonbelievers mentioned by Bayle are not fair examples of atheistic types, being either savages unexposed to the corrupting influence of society or philosophers. Again he expresses the idea that the common man should not be allowed to speculate. This opinion, along with references to the double doctrine of ancient religion, seems to have been shared by the Encyclopedists, one of whom says at the end of the article "Christianisme": "La voie des raisonnements n'est pas faite pour le peuple." In the unsigned article "Societe," Diderot again uses Warburton to stress the utility of religion to society. After the statement that men originally banded together for their mutual good, and that this act necessitated the regulation of conduct, he mentions the efficacy of the fear of God in keeping the public peace. These views follow the gen- eral order of Warburton's argument in his first dissertation; and statements that society and its laws have tended to refine vice, that they have refused to punish certain lawless acts, and that they have actually created desires which are contrary to the public good are directly quoted from Warburton. The quotations continue for three pages.32 Having argued that a coactive power such as that of religion is required to control society, Diderot turns to the problem of asso- ciating lay and religious authority in the most commodious way. Here he uses material from the fourteenth dissertation, which Silhouette adapted from Warburton's earlier Alliance between Church and State. The editor cuts many of the long passages, and a refutation of natural religion is omitted, but he faithfully transcribes Warburton's agree- ment with Locke that the civil society has no influence on intellectual and spiritual matters, and that the religious society should not inter- fere with the state, since the goals of the two societies are completely different. The conclusion is that the church has, and should have, no actual coactive power save excommunication. Similar reasoning about the desirable relation between church and state is advanced by Romilly fils in the article "Tolerance," and many analogies of exposition with the fourteenth dissertation may be noted. 30 Diss., II, 9-10. Gaudin quotes this section, op. cit., pp. 194-195. 31 E., I, 812-813; Diss., I, 127-129, 165-169, and II, 4-12. 32 E., XV, 255b-258; Diss., I, 35-39, and II, 224-259. 231</page><page sequence="7">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Again, in connection with "Societe," the opinions advanced by War- burton have been interpreted as Diderot's own. Barker says that Diderot's standard opinion of Christianity in the Encyclopedie is always based on "the usefulness of religion to society and the state."33 Hubert gives as an example of Diderot's refusal to accept wholeheartedly the theory of moral progress the opinion copied from Warburton that society, with its creation of new problems, has complicated immensely the possibility of leading an ethical life.34 Warburton's long refutation of arguments in favor of natural religion, omitted from "Societe," is found, not surprisingly, under "Religion naturelle." After a long discussion of the extent to which an inner religion fulfills our duties toward God, the editor gives two reasons why an organized religion is necessary. With the sentence, "I1 est done essentiel a l'exercice de la religion ... ," he begins quoting from the fourteenth dissertation.35 We must proclaim our faith publicly, War- burton had said, as an example of virtue, and thanks should be ren- dered in public for benefits received in common. The second reason for formal religion is also borrowed from the bishop; an inner cult would suffice if men were all spirit, but it is obvious that most men, especially the "commun du peuple," are slaves to temperament and the material side of their make-up, and therefore need the discipline of formal religion. Barker calls these "weak arguments," and says in a note: "This article is entirely foreign to the mind of Diderot, but I have not been able to discover its source."36 Another significant omission in "Societe" is of one word. Silhouette had written, in connection with the weakness of purely civil law: "il n'y a point d'Etat grand et florissant ou l'on puisse punir la forni- cation de la maniere que le meriteroient les funestes influences de ce vice." Diderot substituted the word "incontinence" for "fornication." Under the heading "Fornication" in the Encyclopedie a short article by D'Alembert seems to excoriate the arguments concerning the util- ity of religion which were so often copied by other editors. He says: En general, on peut observer... que la religion n'est pas toujours un frein assez puissant contre les crimes que les lois ne punissent pas, ou meme dont le gou- vernement ne fait pas une recherche severe... C'est donc avoir du christianisme une tres-fausse idee.. . que de le regarder par une politique toute humaine comme uniquement destine a etre une digue aux forfaits.37 He goes on to remark that the lack of immediacy of punishment in the afterlife and the church's generosity with absolution render the utility of religion almost nil, in any case. This would seem to be a "philosophic" 33 Op. cit., p. 105. 34 Les Sciences sociales, pp. 282-283. 35 E., XIV, 82; Diss., II, 242-245. 36 Op. cit., p. 30. 37 E., VII, 189; Diss., I, 35-36. 232</page><page sequence="8">WARBURTON AND THE ENCYCLOPIDIE attack, in a rather inconspicuous article, on even the instrumental value of religion. Regardless of D'Alembert's views, however, the article "Christian- isme" contains statements which indicate that Warburton's lengthy proof of the early recognition of the utility of religion has again been drawn from. Diderot's statement that the early legislators, who used the doctrine of divine punishment as a brake on society, were wrong in sacrificing the true to the useful, and that the really true and the really useful are identical, paraphrases closely observations made in the Dissertations38 which had already been copied by Yvon for "Athee." Subsequent remarks that the legislators, appalled at the corruption of the old religions, tried to rectify their error by teaching monotheism in the mysteries, are also obvious borrowings. From the third disserta- tion Diderot then draws, with a few changes, part of the refutation of the typical atheistic remark that Christianity is harmful to the state in that it attacks wealth.39 Warburton had remarked that prosperity "est la consommation de tout ce que l'art et la nature produisent qui est utile a la societe; consommation qui peut avoir lieu sans luxe. . ." The church, then, opposes only the abuse of prosperity. Another stock stricture of the atheists that Warburton helps to refute is that the church is against all forms of pleasure and happiness; this is only the opinion of "cagots et fanatiques." Diderot simply uses the term "rigo- ristes."40 Further on in the article, the statement that the highly touted tolerance of the pagans was due only to the falseness of pagan belief probably came from this observation in the Dissertations: "les bons effets de cette tolerance generale .. . ne provenoient que de la faussete et de l'absurdite du Paganisme; qu'au contraire les mauvais effets de l'intolerance sous la religion Chretienne proviennent de sa verite et de sa perfection...'41 Finally, Warburton's views on the utilitarianism of the Egyptian religion, the real teaching of the mysteries, and the corruption of religion under the Greeks are again borrowed, this time with a specific reference to the eighth dissertation, by Formey in the article "Exoteri- que." Here a thought reminiscent of Vico is emphasized: "il est evident que l'ancienne Mythologie du Paganisme naquit de la corruption de l'ancienne tradition historique."42 Thus, in eleven articles of the Encyclopedie, only three of which indicate their sources, great blocks of the Dissertatioins have been bor- rowed. As a matter of fact, only Warburton's interpretation of the sixth book of the Aeneid as a representation of initiation into the 38E., III, 382b; Diss., I, 186, and II, 180-181. 39 E., III, 383b; Diss., I, 123-125. 40 E., IlI, 384; Diss., I, 119. 41E., III, 384b; Diss., II, 382. 42 E., VI, 274; Diss., II, 24-25. 233</page><page sequence="9">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Eleusinian Mysteries has not been utilized.43 That Warburton's opin- ions concerning the origin and evolution of religion, and its usefulness to society, were significant in eighteenth-century thought may be seen in the estimate of scholars, especially Hubert, that they hold a central place in the Encyclopedists' doctrine of history, religion, and morality, and in the fact that they are sometimes attributed to such thinkers as Diderot. This indirect tribute to Warburton need not imply a denigra- tion of the originality of the societe de gens de lettres, for it is generally conceded that the philosophes' favorite doctrines were not originated by them. Hubert says that the Encyclopedists must be credited with having approached religion from a point of view independent of formal Biblical tradition, but adds: "Mais en cela encore, leur originalite n'est pas absolue, et l'histoire de l'erudition demontrerait abondamment qu'ils avaient ete devances sur la plupart des points par de savants critiques des deux siecles precedents."44 The possibility that War- burton was unthinkingly utilized as a convenient and inoffensive source is slight. Warburton the Christian apologist was probably not highly regarded by Diderot and his colleagues; but there is no reason to believe that his theories, some of them original, on society, philosophy, and religion were not adopted by them in good faith. But Warburton played another role in the Encyclopedie-that of philologist. His influence in this field, although it has been mentioned, has never been fully treated. Hubert says of the editors: "L'Essai sur les hieroglyphes leur a fourni a la fois une explication du langage et une theorie de l'ecriture."45 This is brought out by an examination of the articles drawn, in part, from the translation of the fourth book of the Divine Legation. In "Ecriture,"46 Jaucourt begins by saying: "Developpons avec M. Warburthon l'origine de cet art admirable, ses differentes sortes, et ses changemens progressifs jusqu'a a l'invention d'un alphabet." He then summarizes, with the interpolation of some of Duclos' opinions, pages 5-190 of the Essai, describing the pictograph and the more complex symbolic representation that followed. He sets forth War- burton's theory, which tended to refute Kircher and others, that the hieroglyphics were evolved specifically as a means ' communication, not to mystify or to conceal esoteric philosophy. He mentions the various types of hieroglyphics, and points out that later in their de- velopment their meaning was lost except to the priests and legislators. In Greece and Rome, however, they were once more used to convey information. While their meaning was unknown in Egypt, he adds, the hieroglyphics were the source of the worship of animals. 43 E., X, 436, seems to contain a reference by Jaucourt to Warburton's inter- pretation of Ovid's Metamorphoses in the ninth dissertation. 44 Les Sciences sociales, p. 249. 45 Ibid., p. 333. 46 E., V, 358 ff. 234</page><page sequence="10">WARBURTON AND THE ENCYCLOPtDIE Jaucourt recommends several other articles on language to the reader, and especially lauds "... le parallele ingenieux que fait War- burthon entre les figures et les metaphores d'un c6te, et les differentes especes d'ecriture de l'autre..." In the following article, "Ecriture chinoise," he cites the bishop's opinion that Chinese writing retains elements of the primitive pictograph stage of writing, while in the next article, "Ecriture des Egyptiens," he sets forth in detail the technical classifications of hieroglyphics which, he says, Warburton was the first to develop. The sole important point made here is that only one kind of hieroglyphic was secret, the others being used to satisfy the needs of written communication in society. In "Hieroglyphe,"47 Jaucourt again gives credit to Warburton's work, "ou l'erudition et la philosophie marchent d'un pas egal," for having refuted Kircher's theory of the hieroglyphics as a secret lan- guage. He quotes, in other sentences that remind one of Vico, the opinion that the emergence of this kind of writing in many countries "doit etre considere comme la voix uniforme de la nature, parlant aux concep- tions grossieres des humains."48 Then he explains once more the various classifications of hieroglyphics and the way in which they be- came a secret language, emphasizing the fact that later priests at- tributed a divine origin to them. The worship of the symbols rather than the gods they represented, he repeats, gave rise to the cult of animals.49 Three of the arguments adduced by Warburton to support his theory of the primary use of the hieroglyphic in common civil affairs appear in separate sections of the Encyclopedie. In "Obelisque" Jaucourt copies without acknowledgement the quotation from Diodorus to the effect that the hieroglyphic inscriptions on obelisks report straight- forward historical facts.50 The subsequent references to Rameses' column and comments of the ancients on historical inscriptions also come from the Dissertations. The relation of these opinions to the main thesis of the Divine Legation is never mentioned. The authoritative views of Warburton are again mentioned by Jaucourt in "Oneirocrite."51 This short discussion of dream interpre- tation states tha- interpreters used the hieroglyphics' symbolism to explain dreams, on the grounds that the gods were the authors of both. This could have happened, it is concluded, only after the hieroglyphics were deemed sacred, which was already the case at the time of Joseph. 47 E., VIII, 205-206. 48 Essai, I, 46. 49 Doolittle, op. cit., pp. 389-391, has emphasized the way in which Jaucourt brought out the "... priestly fostering of superstition among the people" in the articles "Ecriture," "Ecriture des Egyptiens," and "Hieroglyphe." 50 E., XI, 298b-299; Essai, I, 119-120. 51 E., XI, 477; Essai, I, 226-239. 235</page><page sequence="11">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE No mention is made of the importance of this idea in the proof of the great antiquity of Egyptian thought.52 The article "Isiaque, table"53 offers a general description of the table and an explanation of the clash between Shuckford and Warburton concerning its antiquity. Shuckford thought it very early, previous to the worship of an anthropomorphic god. Warburton, because of the mingling of types of hieroglyphics and the position of some of the figures, dates it much later. Jaucourt then hazards some remarks of his own on the "folie" of attempting to date such monuments and of trying to interpret the hieroglyphics. He does not tell the reader that Warburton's opinion here is part of another proof of the high antiquity of Egyptian learning.54 Obviously, the main theses of the Divine Lega- tion were of no interest to the Encyclopedists. Two articles on the origin of language, a vital subject in the eight- eenth century, reveal new dimensions of liberalism in Warburton's thought. In "Langage"55 Jaucourt paraphrases the bishop's remark that, judging simply by the nature of things, one might agree with Diodorus Siculus that men lived like beasts, originally, and only slowly and painfully learned to communicate by sounds. Gregory of Nyssa and Richard Simon believed this, although revelation explicitly says that God gave men the gift of language. Still, it is probable, Jaucourt continues, omitting a cautious qualifying remark of Warburton's, that language at first "etoit necessairement sterile et fort borne.. ."56 The editor also echoes Warburton's statement that men first communicated by mingled sound and gestures, and then leaves the Essai to speak of the influences of climate on language. As Warburton's insistence on the utility of religion was criticized by D'Alembert, his remarks on the sterility and imperfection of primitive language are righteously challenged by Beauzee in the article "Lan- gage," under the heading "Origine de la langue primitive." The editor quotes, with a specific citation, the beginning of the remark concerning primitive language paraphrased by Jaucourt and says, logically: "Mais 52 The other sources utilized in this article are indicated by Doolittle, op. cit., p. 389. 53E., VIII, 912; Essai, I, 292-300. 54 Warburton reasons that all the people knew, at first, the meaning of the hieroglyphics, so that symbolized gods were recognized as such. Then, the mean- ing of the figures lost, the hieroglyphics themselves were worshipped, and the cult of plants and animals was born. Since the cult of animals is ancient, having been widespread at the time of Moses, the earlier forms of Egyptian religion, hence writing, hence knowledge in general, must be even more remote. The opinions of Shuckford, Pluche, Vossius, and others concerning the posteriority of anthropomorphic gods to the animal cult obviously opposed this thesis, and had to be refuted. 55 E., IX, 242; Essai, 48-51. 56 Warburton said, according to Silhouette: "Le Langage, si l'on en juge par les monuments de l'Antiquite, et par la nature de la chose, a ete d'abord ex- tremement grossier, sterile, et equivoque..." (Essai, I, 48). 236</page><page sequence="12">WARBURTON AND THE ENCYCLOPi?DIE il est difficile de concevoir comment on peut admettre la revelation avec le degre de soumission qu'elle a droit d'exiger, et pretendre pourtant que la nature des choses insinue des principes opposes."57 The "philosophic" value of such a confrontation of the evidence of nature and reason on the one hand and Biblical tradition on the other is obvious. Having made a thrust for the cause, Beauzee leaves the Dis- sertations to discuss Rousseau and "cette supposition humiliante de l'homme ne sauvage." The evolutionary naturalism embodied in Warburton's ideas on religion and the origin and development of language is illustrated under still other headings. In the article "Figure, Logiq. Metaph.," after discussing Aristotle's analysis of the trope's charm as novelty, the editor heralds some ideas much more philosophical than these, and makes again the statement that the written language was, originally, "necessairement figure, sterile, et grossier..."58 Appeals, therefore, were necessarily made to all the senses in the act of communicating, resulting in tropical discourse, while the use of the hieroglyphic made style even more symbolic. He cites Warburton: "la necessite, et non pas le choix de l'art, a produit les diverses especes d'ecritures hiero- glyphiques,"59 and refers to the parallel made by him between the development of the written and the spoken language. Citing the same passage, he remarks that the spoken language was also limited in the beginning and destitute of abstractions, so that figures of all kinds were natural and essential to communication. Then what was at first a necessity became a mystery, and, in the course of time, contrived elegance.60 This explains the pleonasm and the metaphor. "Les premiers hommes etant simples, grossiers, et plonges dans les sens, ne pouvoient exprimer leur conception des idees abstraites, et les operations re- flechies de l'entendement, qu'a l'aide des images sensibles, qui... devenoient metaphores." Towards the end of the article he quotes Warburton's remark that, as in the case of clothing, language has be- come, in many cases, mere embellishment, and adds that excess in both matters makes for decadence. One is not surprised to find under "Metaphore" a repetition of these views; but this editor, Beauzee, has Warburton, to whom he al- ludes directly, share the honors with Du Marsais. Again comments by Warburton are quoted on the need of primitive man, incapable of abstract thought, to express himself with the aid of tropes of all kinds."' Again, in "Similitude," Jaucourt says: "Apres avoir parle de la similitude en rheteur, il faut bien que j'en dise un mot comme philo- 57 E., IX, 250. 58 E., VI, 765; Essai, I, 48. 59 Essai, I, 47-48. 60 E., VI, 765; Essai, I, 93-95, 184. 61 E., X, 436-437; Essai, 193-197. 237</page><page sequence="13">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE logue," and goes on to paraphrase Warburton's theory that the simile is a sophisticated shortening of the apologue and is parallel in sophistica- tion to Chinese writing. The metaphor is described, following War- burton, as a natural refinement of the simile.62 The article "Enigme" also contains elements of this primitivistic theory of figurative expression, although Warburton is not named therein. The editor says, for example: "Dans la premiere origine des langues, les hommes furent obliges de joindre le langage d'action a celui des sons articules, et de ne parler qu'avec images sensibles." The statements that the enigma later became esoteric and that the Bible and Oriental languages abound in "sentences obscures" also come from the Essai.63 Hubert has mentioned Warburton's role in the articles concerning language and the essential congruence of his opinions with the En- cyclopedists' philosophic vision of the past. For them too, language, being a social phenomenon, must have had a natural origin and evolu- tion. Again, for them as well as for Warburton, priority would have to go, in the consideration of this "langue primitive universelle, pro- duction spontanee de la nature humaine," to the languages of the old- est civilizations.64 Having ignored, however, such articles as "Meta- phore," "Similitude," and "Figure," Hubert does not point out War- burton's full influence in these matters. In his reference to the at- tempts of the Encyclopedists to establish the principles of the filiation and "l'analogue des genies. des langues,"65 he might have mentioned Warburton's ideas of the relationships of languages on the basis of their figurative elements or their use of abstractions,66 and of ways in which various civilizations have refined earlier forms of stylistic expression.67 Also ignored, in connection with the dissemination of Warburton's theories in the Encyclopedie, are those elements of his thought which parallel ideas considered of the greatest importance in Vico. Numer- ous interesting rapprochements can be made with the Scienza nuova. For example, Vico says of the Egyptians that they were particularly concerncd with "sapienza civile," and adds: "Tanto gli egizi, nel tempo ch'arricchivan il mondo de' ritruovati o necessari o utili al gener umano, furon essi filosofi e s'intendevano di universali."68 The contrast between the metaphysics of such Greeks as Plato and the "sapienza volgare degli egizi" is made elsewhere in the Scienza 62 E., XV, 202; Essai, I, 85-86. 63 E., V, 690; Essai, I, 188, 190-191. 64 Les Sciences sociales, pp. 329-330. 65 Ibid., pp. 339-340. 66 E.g., the Oriental languages reveal their relatively primitive level by their reliance on tropes. 67 E.g., the way in which the apologue, as used in the Bible, becomes a meta- phor in classical literature. 68 Scienza nuova, ed. F. Nicolini (Bari, 1928), I, 91. 238</page><page sequence="14">WARBURTON AND THE ENCYCLOPtDIE nuova.69 On primitive language we find many statements similar to Warburton's, such as the following: "Per cio si e dimostro che tutti i tropi... i quali si sono finora creduti ingegnosi ritruovati degli scrittori, son stati necessari modi de spiegarsi di tutte le prime nazioni poetiche."70 Many other similarities of opinion and expression con- cerning the hieroglyphics and primitivism could be cited.71 Such simi- larities reopen the problem of currents of "Vichian" thought in France in the eighteenth century.72 Watson, in his biography, says of Warburton: "As a scholar, he has secured for himself no reverence from scholars, nor as a critic, from critics, nor as a divine, from divines; yet he cannot but command from all classes of readers and thinkers some share of attention and regard."73 A share of attention and regard was certainly accorded him by the Encyclopedists; for, as we have seen, they drew some of the contents of twenty-three articles from two translations of his works. That this influence has done little to increase the reverence that Warburton failed to gain in the past is due in part to the vicissitudes of literary history and to the casual documentation of the Encyclopedists, who were, after all, compilers and purveyers of ideas, not press agents. They were manifestly interested in Warburton's erudition and natural- istic theories, not in an assertion of the divinity of the Mosaic dispen- sation. It was the quality of his thought that concerned them, not his reputation. Diderot writes in the article "Encyclopedie": "II y a des ouvrages si importants, si bien medites, si precis, en petit nombre, a la verite, qu'une encyclopedie doit les engloutir en entier. Ce sont ceux dont l'objet general est traite d'une maniere methodique et profonde." Such a work, evidently, was the Divine Legation in translation, even though its "objet general" was disregarded. The Johns Hopkins University 69 E.g., S.N., I, 169. 70 S.N., I, 167. 71 S.N., I, 146, 181, for example. 72 Several scholars, such as Fisch in his introduction to The Autobiography of Giambattista Vico (Ithaca, 1944), p. 82, and Nicolini, in Aretusa, II, 21, have referred to the Vichian flavor of many of Warburton's ideas, but have not pur- sued the matter. I intend to discuss related ideas in a study I am preparing of the influence of Warburton's writings on other French writers of the eighteenth century. 73 J. S. Watson, The Life of Wim.
