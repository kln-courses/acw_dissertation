<plain_text><page sequence="1">ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION Thomas A. Brindley While a number of ecologists, urban planners, and conservationists have talked about man's relationships with nature, their views have generally been ignored within philosophic circles, and their ideas are particularly absent in educational philosophy. In fact, Albert Sch- weitzer criticized general philosophy entirely in his book Out of My Life and Thought, where he pointed out that a fault with ethical phi- losophy was precisely that it dealt only with the relations of man to man.* On the other hand, the naturalists often left out anthropology in their singular concern with nature. For example, the preface to the plant geography book by the late Marion Newbigin states, "This study corresponds to. . . Ecology - that is, the study of living organ- isms in relation to their environment, the latter including questions Professor Brindley is at the University of Arkansas, Hunts ville. His field of interest is social value changes in education. He received his Ph.D. at the University of Michigan.</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF THOUGHT 153 of relief, climate and soil. It remains to add that the complex sub- ject of man is of necessity omitted. "2 The complex attitudinal relationships of man with nature - those views toward nature which translate into man's behavior in dealing with the natural environment, whether of benign or malevolent in- tent - are a proper concern of educational philosophy. While various educators have taught about nature and the environment from a prac- tical standpoint, usually in courses of science education, nature study, or environmental education, few have undertaken the philo- sophical discussion which may lie at the foundation of these practices and pedagogic methodologies. Thus, this thesis will be a review of various concerns and considerations which may define the parameters of such a theoretical basis of the complex attitudinal relationships of man with nature. However we may choose to answer metaphysical, ontological, or escha toi ogical questions about the universe and man does not impinge upon a more practical set of considerations which deal with current everyday attitudes as they are reflected in man's behavior and his effects upon the environment. "Every form of life, " as Patrick Geddes has expressed it, "is marked not merely by adjustment to the environment, but by insurgence against the environment: it is both creature and creator, both the victim of fate and the master of destiny; it lives no less by domination than by acceptance. "3 Simi- larly, Aldo Leopold stated, "When some remote ancestor of our in- vented the shovel, he became a giver: he could plant a tree. And when the axe was invented, he became a taker: he could chop it down. Whoever owns land has thus assumed, whether he knows it or not, the divine functions of creating and destroying plants. "4 Mars ton Bates stated that "Man's actions can be looked at as ef- forts to simplify the biological relationship within the ecosystem to his own advantage. "5 Man's food web is reduced to a simple producer- consumer interaction, a process that is unique to the human eco- system. Bates goes on to explain that as man altered the landscape and its biological components, he creates a vastly simplified eco- system, such as a one-crop economy, which has great liability to catastrophe. Such may be man's expression of his need for survival, which Rene Dubos in Mirage of Health said man expressed in his con- stant adaptation to changing environmental circumstances. But Dubos went further than survival, explaining how adaptation is manifest genetically, biologically, socially, and creatively as man constantly searches for fitness to the environment. 6</page><page sequence="3">154 JOURNAL OF THOUGHT If ethical or axiological philosophy should include a discussion of the environment, there are several distinct views of man's relation- ships with the natural environment which can be delineated. First is the view that man must control, direct, take care of, or exploit the earth since he is set outside and above nature's realm. In Genesis I, 26, the Judaic- Christian Bible states "Then God said let us make man in our image after our likeness. Let him have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, over the cattle, over all the earth, and every creeping thing that creeps on earth. " This is the anthropomorphic view which states that nature and man are separate, that the earth exists for the benefit of man, and that man has the free will to create his own happiness on earth in his lifetime. In this view, man is dominant and must husband or use the earth to his own advantage. Biological nature operates by its own laws, but, al- though man too is biological and follows natural patterns, he is free to act outside these laws, to manipulate them as he can, and to ex- ceed his own limits. This has led to a break away from instinct and libidinal forces, into the development of one's own ego. With sci- ence, technology, invention, democracy, and individualism, man's independence of nature was theoretically assured. However j another world view has prevailed throughout history, that is the organic view, that man and nature exist in a cooperative inter- relationship, that a spiritual and biological bond unites man with all other forms of life, and that man's integrity is intimately suffused in the natural order. Man is one with the universe. Throughout history there has been an ebb and flow of the organic ideal versus the anthropocentric view. Surely one could trace the development of these views in conjunction with each other and within the context of the historical periods which may show whether these views are cause or effect. That is to say that at any given time in history the anthropocentric view may be the dominant thesis or, on the contrary, the organic view may be in the ascendency. For in- stance, it has been established anthropologically that the Cheyenne Indians held a view of the close interrelationship of man and nature which came into direct conflict with the anthropomorphic views of the white man crossing North America in the 19th Century under the thrust of Manifest Destiny and the frontier spirit. The consequences of treatment of the land were different under the two managerial systems - the Plains Indians and the new American white. Whether nature is anthropomorphically or organically perceived, the results in practice usually take several forms. Because of his</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF THOUGHT 155 attitudes toward nature, man may feel that he has the right to ex- ploit, to take from the environment according to his needs, and to utilize resources for his own purposes. In a malignant sense man seems to have an urge to destroy, to lay waste, and to conquer na- ture. Perhaps this urge to desecrate has its source in aggression or it may represent a survival need, a defensive response to fear of not surviving. 7 War and conquest, imperialism and colonialism seem to be related to man's urge to plunder the natural environment. Such a relationship was very graphically portrayed by the American troops in Vietnam. Just before the First Cavalry Division left Indochina for the States, bulldozers scraped the earth and removed trees in a path one mile in diameter to emblazon their emblem of the "Big Red One " upon the jungle and soil. To leave one's mark on a place where one has been demonstrated a sign of conquest. Another kind of relationship of man to earth is the management or caretaker role. Man acts as the welfare agent for nature. This is the attitude of the game manager, the forester, and the gardener in which habitat and wildlife are manipulated in a controlled fashion. This is also the view of the social engineer and the behaviorist, that he can manipulate people to fit some preconceived ends. Like the missionary and pr osely tizer, he plans the fate of others, he changes nature to satisfy his design. This attitude stems from the idea that man can improve upon nature. In practice one witnesses the use of pesticides to control insects and fertilizers to build up the land. The Corps of Engineers engages in the channelization of rivers while the Department of Agriculture sponsors irrigation projects to bring in water to nearby areas and the TVA and Department of Interior build dams to store water and manage rivers. A third attitude, besides the exploitative and the manipulative, is the view that man should husband and tend the earth, as a shepherd does his flock. Stewart Udall spoke of man's need to conserve and yet use wisely. He called this a new conservation not only to pre- serve but "to restore what has been destroyed and salvage the beauty and charm of our cities. " This "stewardship" of the land is a type of management, but it' is based on a balanced conservation seeking material progress and the maintenance of a "life-giving environment" proceeding hand in hand. This is an attempt to allow man and nature to coexist in equilibrium. An eloquent spokesman for stewardship and husbandry in conserva- tion isReneDubos. Man is responsible for the environment "to dress it and keep it" as the Bible says in Genesis 2:15 about the Garden of</page><page sequence="5">156 JOURNAL OF THOUGHT Eden. Dubos rejects the Faustian dominion over earth and the Ar- cadian or Franciscan return to nature. Instead, he feels man should act like the Benedictine monks who tended their gardens or like Pro- metheus who returned fire to the earth to use it in the interest of man. But always man must exert responsibility, seek a "design with nature" and a "quality of life. "8 Another major attitudinal view is that of the purist, the preser- vationist or the Creationist. Compare the geologist's view of evo- lution with the Creationist view. The evolutionist sees earth evolv- ing as a natural process over time in movements of earth, rocks, river basins, and oceans. Man's tampering is incidental and may be a geologic process in itself. The Creationist, however, sees earth as fixed and non-changing. The beautiful scene will last forever if properly protected. In a sense to him the earth is flat. There is a permanence in the natural surroundings as God created them from the first to the sixth day of Genesis. Preservationists include those who believe that wilderness areas must be set aside and protected from any exploitation or unnecessary intrusion by man. The Sierra Club handbook states that the basic qualities and values of wilderness cannot be preserved if substantial utilization of the area is allowed to alter the landscape. 9 Implicit in the purist view is a romantic idealism that find joy, solitude, and eternal peace in the pristine beauty of nature. But the purists should not be blamed for their aesthetic and moral romanticism since ro- manticism is not confined to the so-called "tender hearted." Futur- ists, those who hold an idealized faith in progress, science, and tech- nology may also be romantic visionaries, but their romanticism is based in power and kinetic force. In some societies, especially pre- industrial and so-called "primi- tive" ones, a view toward nature that may predominate is subservi- ence to nature. Such a view holds to a stoic acceptance of life, death, and natural forces which may be propitiated through a sometimes superstitious supplication to spirits and animistic forms residing in the environment. Oftentimes, depending on the culture, such a view shows an untroubled matter-of-course dependence on the determin- istic whims of nature, or, contrarywise, shows a terrible fear of nature as in some unknown force. Whereas the Montagnard tribes- men of Vietnam may thoroughly understand natural phenomena as they occur and have learned to adapt to every nuance of weather and habitat, the Vietnamese townsmen have shown a traditional fear of entering the jungle . Not far removed from so-called primitive peoples</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL OF THOUGHT 157 in their fear of nature are many so-called modern urbanités who show horrible disgust and even nausea upon touching snakes, lizards, centi- pedes, or cockroaches. Such a rejection of other forms of biologic life is strongly reinforced by modern views of medicine and public health, especially in sanitation rules and in the germ theory. 10 Anthropologists are divided concerning the thinking of primitive- peasant societies. Robert Redfield held that the primitive-peasant orders followed an organic view of society which allowed a great re- spect for nature, if not fear, and looked at questions of society and nature from a moral rather than functional guideline. ^ Another group holds that the primitive-peasants would be as ruthless to nature as the modem-urban, except that they lacked the technology. Advo- cates claim that destruction of the forest, burning, wanton killing, and drainage occurred just as mindlessly and ferociously as with modern exploiters. While the argument might not easily be settled and even though anthropologists are aware of man's continued use and misuse of the environment, only a partisan advocate would claim that the modern urban industrial technological society has been less ruth- less and exploitative toward the environment than primitive-peasant societies. Discussions of man's relationships with the environment are con- tingent upon an analysis of modern processes of development and social change, particularly as these are seen in economic policies, technology, and the uses of energy. In fact, questions of environ- mental education and conservation are but the obverse side of ques- tions about how man uses technology and energy. By presenting in comparison two opposing views of the influence of the economy upon the environment, the proponents of a growth and development phi- losophy will be set against the no-growth, steady state view. The Governor of Arizona in 1970, Jack Williams, gave a speech in which he advocated continued progress, growth, affluence, and ad- vancement. His voice is typical of the an ti- environmental movement and of those supporting growth and material exploitation. Essentially, ex-governor Williams said man should have dominion over earth, as God wanted, and that man is doing nothing new or so tragic toward other humans or the environment than previous societies. Those opposed to modern advancement, affluence, and continued economic growth are against the good life and can be called sponsors of "dooms- day talk" or "ecological propaganda. " Basically, he said, such en- vironmentalists are against freedom in general, but free enterprise in particular. They want control over the economy, central planning,</page><page sequence="7">158 JOURNAL OF THOUGHT and a stop to economic development. The ecologists "decry what civilization has created. " We should not worry about beauty because more important are the needs of survival and of pleasing ourselves. The common good, like Communism, limits freedom, he said, but man's individual initiative and enterprise overcome the environment. "In other words, man, not earth, makes civilizations, " and "parlor ecologists" should not decry what civilization has wrought. 12 Such is the view which Joseph Wood Krutch and Erich Fromm called the consumption and marketing orientation. This is the cultural value based in secular materialism that in order to be successful man must produce and consume, strive for affluence, compete with others, and be a part of the free enterprise system. 13 At the other end of the economic continuum is the view that growth will lead to social and biological collapse and that only a limited or no-growth, steady state economy is a viable future alternative. The study by scientists at MIT for the Club of Rome, an international group of industrialists and others, which used world system models to compute various key growth factors, determined that growth is exponential and that we are approaching the limits.14 Moreover, the attempt to stop one, two, or even three factors arbitrarily, could delay disaster, but collapse was still imminent. Only by keeping all the factors from reaching threshold could the world survive. Al- though Dennis Meadows and his colleagues who completed the Club of Rome study were taken to task, their general thesis has been ac- cepted by many ecologists. The love of nature and the personification of humane, natural re- lationships of man with the environment have been expressed and witnessed in the lives of Henry David Thoreau, Albert Schweitzer, and Aldo Leopold. Schweitzer called for a living with nature and a "reverence for life, " all forms of life. Leopold asked that modern man consider a new "land ethic" which would include man's relation- ships with nature as an intimate part of his ethical philosophy. Such a conservation and land ethic is the business of education, especially those in educational philosophy who are concerned with a discussion of values and priorities. Attention has been drawn publicly to the many environmental problems, but appropriate means and ends of rational discussion and educational communication of ecology are still in their infancy. Early warnings were sounded by historians, conservationists, and other clairvoyant citizens who sensed the di- lemmas caused by the confluence of technology and nature amidst a burdgeoning population which lives partly in affluence and partly in</page><page sequence="8">JOURNAL OF THOUGHT 159 poverty. The resulting problems called for new governmental poli- cies and for changing personal attitudes and life styles. This was an obvious task for educators. Thus arose the need and the demand for environmental education. The necessity to integrate the many knowledgeable disciplines con- cerned with environmental and social problems- -and both make up the study of ecology - is the theoretical task that educators have to consider. The practical task lies in formulating and dispersing cur- ricula which would convey the environmental messages to students and laymen of all ages - a broad scoped educational requirement. The major emphasis of Environmental Education is to instill a sense of awareness and a basic understanding of the relationships of man with his environment and a respect for nature. Environmental Education attempts to provide the scope and perhaps the vision for teachers and lay citizens to find the purposes and the means to edu- cate others about man and his environment. The course objectives can be listed but are not easily taught in sequential order. They are, generally, that the students be able to understand the basic order, the life forces, and functions of nature; the values and attitudes manholds in his relationships with nature; the ways man uses or mis- uses the environment; the key problem areas and possible alternative solutions; and meaningful ways the individual can communicate and educate these views. 16 REFERENCES ■^Quoted in Mar s ton Bates, Resources and Man, National Academy of Science (San Francisco: Freeman, 1969), p. 29. ^Newbigin, Marion, Plant and Animal Geography (London: Methuen &amp; Co. , Ltd., cr. 1936, 1968), pp. 298, vi. ^Mumford, Lewis, Technics and Civilization (New York: Harcourt, Brace, and World, 1934; Harbinger, 1963), p. 399. ^Leopold, Aldo, A Sand County Almanac (New York: Oxford Uni- versity Press, 1949, 1964), p. 67. ^Bates, Ibid., p. 26. ^Dubos, Rene, Mirage of Health (New York: Harper &amp; Row Pe- rennial Library, 1959, 1971), pp. 30-61. ^Ardrey, Robert, The Territorial Imperative (New York: Athenu- em, 1966), 390 pp., and Montagu, Ashley, Man and Aggression (London: Oxford University Press, 1968), 178 pp.</page><page sequence="9">160 JOURNAL OF THOUGHT ^Dubos, Rene, A God Within (New York: Scribner's, 1972), 326 pp. , especially pp. 153-174. ^Reference in Richard Blodgett, "A Voice for the Wilderness, " The American Way (American Airlines, August 1971), pp. 13-18. l^Dubos, Rene, Mirage of Health, Ibid., pp. 95-219.
