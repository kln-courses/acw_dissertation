<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Long-Beaked Bronze Jug in Greek Lands DOROTHY KENT HILL PLATES 15-16 When Carapanos excavated Dodona he discov- ered several bronze vase handles of rare and inter- esting form, obviously belonging to narrow-beaked, long-spouted jugs. In the appendix to Carapanos' Dodone et ses ruines (1878) (pp. 224ff) Leon Heu- zey gave them the name "prochoos," a term applied in Homer to a jug for water for hand washing be- fore meals, and suggested that they were for ritual use. Subsequently, no general study has been made though the supply is greatly augmented. I have here assembled forty-one examples in a list that neces- sarily must be incomplete and that includes speci- mens which are inadequately illustrated and not accessible to me. The list is sufficient to prove that this form was of importance and persistence in lands that were Greek and, in general, mainland Greek. Few complete jugs are preserved, and of the few, all the early examples are fragmentary. They gen- erally are small, having ovoid body and separately made base. The handle has a pair of rotelles project- ing above the rim, set parallel to each other and seeming to pinch the narrow throat and force the forward projection of the lip. Interesting decorative elements may be added, the commonest of them a woman's head on the handle looking into the vase. A detached handle from such a vase can be recog- nized by the position of the rotelles, far back, close together and parallel to each other, and it can easily be distinguished from the handle of a trefoil- mouthed oinochoe on which rotelles terminate long arms which rest on the rim instead of grasping it. Occasionally substitution is made for the rotelles, as by the arms and legs of a human being or even a ram's head; then the type may be recognized by the narrowness of the neck and its fitting between barriers. This shape, recurring in Attic pottery, is Shape X of Beazley's classification. It is to be kept distinct from Shape VII with its vertical throat front, wider throat, absence of rotelles and different- ly shaped body, without base; from the Schnabel- kanne that was immortalized by Jacobsthal and Langsdorf with its trefoil mouth, long spout, and sloping top keeping to a plane; from the so-called epichysis which has a low body and very long neck, and from other forms. The shape is of such great beauty, appreciable even in spite of the generally bad preservation, and the workmanship is so uni- formly good that on grounds of artistic excellence alone this bronze ware merits detailed study. Suddenly in the middle of the sixth century a group of these jugs appeared in Greece. To imagine a source for them in earlier cultures is tempting but hardly justifiable. Quite naturally, one tends to see a connection with the spouted jugs of Mycenaean and earlier prehistoric times. Later and farther afield are the wares of Asia Minor, particularly the bronze vessels and pottery vessels excavated at Gordion. However, these are eighth century, fully two hun- dred years earlier than our examples. Therefore I think it wise not to claim any of these as ancestors for my group, acknowledging, however, the pos- sibility of a derivation being established later. The first five handles have female heads as dec- oration. Unfortunately, none is attached to a jug. Something about the body shape may be deduced from the fact that these handles are straight, slant- ing out below to reach the shoulder of a fairly broad vase. The two long points below each rotelle or, in the case of No. 3, the broad band connecting the rotelles, aided attachment. I. Athens, National Museum, from Dodona. Up- per part of handle.

The following five have pear-shaped body (two preserved), and handle of triangular cross section. The generally heavier decoration includes a handle pattern that appears on various types of the late sixth century: a stalk ending above in a bud or a snake's head, flanked on each side by a leaf. Some- times the stalk is divided into beads and usually the edges also have beads and they may reappear on the edges of the rotelles. Relief decoration on the ro- telles is characteristic. The projecting attachment plaques below the rotelles have been discontinued and so has the thumb-rest. Rotelles are close to- gether, for the throat is narrower than ever, and the main part of the handle is slightly convex or ogival, a sort of S when seen in profile; the shoulder fitting below this handle is relatively narrow. 14.

On the handle is a lovely head. It must date before 550 B.c. In Attic black- figure, Beazley listed eight examples, all belonging to the later phases, leaving a gap in time after the Corinthian.' Two of them (Wiirzburg and Naples Stg. 235) have egg-shaped bodies with narrow beaks and medium necks and lack plastic decoration; their handles are convex. These two resemble bronzes 6-13. Another group of three, with white ground, are decorated with a woman's bust with arms that rest on the rim of the vase, just like bronze i6 which they closely resemble. They have pear-shaped bodies like 14 and 17. One pottery jug, in Florence, is mentioned by Beazley as having a concave handle, putting it in a class with 14-17 (and also 6f, but not 11, 12 or 13). Nos. 6-13 could be the product of one school or factory. It is impossible to establish its place of manufacture or date; the fact that the backs of some of them are slightly concave might suggest a late archaic date. Of the others, Nos. I-5 come from the third quarter of the sixth century, Nos. 14-16 from the last quarter or even from the succeeding cen- tury. The presence of the head above the rim in so many examples, and these early ones, is a striking phenomenon, since it rarely occurs elsewhere in metalware' and in pottery.5 One might almost be- lieve that it was the maker of one of these jugs who conceived the idea of this whimsical touch. All the heads are beautiful, their loveliness increasing the temptation to wander into the maze of criticism and attribution. Stylistically the variety is sufficient to warrant the statement that no single person, school or place had a monopoly on the manufacture of the long-beaked bronze jug. To proceed further and make other claims is to engage in sport rather than scientific deduction. Attribution of utensils with anthropomorphic decoration depends upon comparison with small, portable works of sculpture, which for their own localization have been com- pared with the surviving monuments of the great schools of sculpture. Factors that work against satis- factory and convincing comparisons are the ex- treme portability of the objects, the hazards of preservation of bronze statuettes and terracottas and haphazard choices of fields for study by earlier scholars. There is the further difficulty of ancient production fluctuations, such as the discontinuance of Corinthian pottery pyxides adorned with heads in the round at the moment of increased produc- tion of figurines, Argive we believe. However, though localizations based on comparison in the sec- ond degree must remain dubious, the grouping of stylistically similar heads may eventually lead to conclusions. The following remarks are but ven- tures in this direction. No. 2 (pl. 15, fig. I) was attributed to Sparta by Bielefeld and I see no reason to question this at- tribution. Nos. I and 3 seem to me Corinthian, the latter more certainly than the former. I am basing this attribution in large part on Jenkins' collection of Argive and Corinthian terracottas; on his plate (BSA 32 [1931-32] pl. XVI) the bottom row with No. 9, called Late Corinthian III, corresponds to our No. 3, the top row, called L. C. I, to our No. I. Our 3 (pl. 15, figs. 2, 3) also resembles some bronzes that have been called Corinthian, such as a goddess in Cambridge6 and Zeus Lykaios in Athens.7 I would also compare with it a bronze sphinx in the Walters Art Gallery, having the same In my opinion, "influence of metalware" was not effective in the development of the standard shapes of Attic pottery. That a detail of decoration here and there was copied from metalware is likely. The shape which I am discussing could hardly be called a standard shape; in fact it is rare both in metal and in pottery. It is observable that of the long-beaked jugs, the contemporary bronze and pottery pieces resemble one another in their proportions and this observed fact provides a rough check on the dating of the bronze examples. For this reason I mention the pottery in this article. Just how the cross influences were exerted is beside the point. 8 Beazley, ABV 440f. Possibly earlier than the others is Villa Giulia 1204, which Beazley classifies with Shape VII, because it has a broad beak, though it has rotelles.

In the rectan- gular face I find some suggestion of early Attic work, but more than a suggestion of Ionic sculp- ture, in particular of a class of terracotta figure bot- tles that seem to be Samian.' The overelaboration of the hair decoration-a fillet, a flat cap, and on top a tongue-bordered part that appears as a sort of polos with its own supporting fillet-this elabora- tion is not out of keeping with Ionic origin. The decorative parts of the handle proper do not offer much aid. The twisted effect occurs also on some bronze amphorae from Trebenischte together with the snake and palmette ornament of the base."0 The latter motive, once considered by Neugebauer to be localized in South Italy, is now known to have been fairly common, especially on a group of trefoil- mouthed oinochoai that seem to be Greek." One might attribute handles 4 and 5 to the East Greek world, recognizing the other possibility that the source was Athens, the city which had artistic af- filiations with this area. No. 15 resembles a group of mirror supports and other pieces assembled by Charbonneaux and at- tributed by him to an Aeginetan workshopl2 (one of these mirrors was attributed by others to Sicy- on'3) and I am inclined to attribute it to Aegina, though I realize that a South Italic, specifically a Tarentine, origin may be suggested, since the work of Aegina was closely related to that of South Italy."4 No. 14 was attributed to Tarentum by Sche- fold1 but I am not convinced of this attribution and, in view of the jug's reputed finding in Greece, I would suggest a central Greek, perhaps Aegine- tan, source. No. 16 is not well enough illustrated to justify an attribution. The bands over the arms recall some hydriae of the fifth century.'6 After 500 B.c. fewer bronze jugs were made.

These seven might be classed as two groups: Nos. 22-26 having single figures, Nos. 27 and 28 having two people acrobatically posed, the upright one forming the main part of the handle. Yet so similar are the details that one may count them as a single group. They have been thoroughly studied, and by eminent authorities. Neugebauer"9 considered five (not 24 and 25) and decided that four belonged to one great factory in South Italy, perhaps at Taren- tum, as he had been organizing it, with No. 26 as a provincial copy. More recently, Mme. Picard20 has attributed all those found at Carthage to local Carthaginian workshops and to a much later date, the fourth and third centuries B.c. In favor of her thesis is the discovery of several examples in late Carthaginian cemeteries. Moreover, Mme. Picard has had the advantage of studying the material at Carthage. Nevertheless, I find it hard to disagree with Neugebauer's contention that the group is con- sistent and from one workshop and that its date range is the first two generations of the fifth cen- tury B.c.; to his group of four I would add No. 24, making a total of five (No. 26 being provincial and No. 27 unavailable to me). The localization of the group is a difficult problem. The tendency is now against Neugebauer's attribution to South Italy of a large class of which our group forms a part. That class was established chiefly on the basis of decorative details which actually were widely dis- tributed, such as the handle patterns of our Nos. I4ff and the plaque ornaments of Nos. 4 and 5 (see note 9). Yet, in the case in point, his attribution was substantiated by comparison of sculptural forms with those of other sculpture, and the comparison 19 K. A.

Compare our No. 28 (pl. 2, fig. 8) with the sculpture chosen by Ashmole to establish a Tarentine style based on the style of Sparta, of which Tarentum was a colony.21 Therefore it seems to me quite possible that the whole group (Nos. 22-28, except 26 and 27) are of one school, the school of Tarentum. As such they would be an offshoot, a product, of the simpler handles which we have found on Greek jugs. They seem to fill the gap after the sixth-century jugs and to be contemporary with Nos. 18-21. To repeat, their subsidiary patterns are the same as Nos. 14-17 which I consider their immediate predecessors.22 To the main Greek stream we now return. The last large group consists of miniature jugs. Everything is on a small scale and the rotelles are so close together as to leave only a tubular throat and a deep groove in the solid spout. The spout does not rise very high. Its tip is thickened. Only one complete vase is preserved and it is of squat form. 29. Paris, Louvre, 2772-73. Handle and spout, with top part of vase.

Pottery parallels for the miniature jugs are neither close nor many. A few Late Corinthian pieces, more than a century older,23 resemble the Amster- dam jug and there are a few-three to my knowl- edge-Attic red-figured jugs with squat body and long spout.24 This spout does not rise as high as on the afore-mentioned jugs. After the miniatures a few large jugs appear, manufactured after the passage of considerable time. The following resemble each other and are probably fourth century: 40. London, British Museum, 73.8-20.192. Handle and spout. Upper part of handle: sphinx, forepaws resting on rim. Silver inlay. Lower attachment: head of Pan. Labelled, "South Italic, about 400 B.C." 41. Carthage, Lavigerie. Handle, wrongly at- tached to a trefoil-mouthed jug, but obviously similar to the preceding. Upper attachment: sphinx. Lower attachment: head of Pan. On top of handle: Gorgon mask. Boulanger, Cat. Mus. Lavigerie, sup. I, p. 75, pl. xI, 2. In pottery there are later (fourth-third century) examples in Gnathia and Calene black-glazed ware.25 Much commoner in later times is the small epichysis which suggests one of the miniature bronze jugs poised upon a box having concave sides. This last type develops an angular form of the handle proper and is commonest in Apulian red-figure. Did production of long-beaked jugs continue into late Hellenistic times? Radnoti believed that it did and derived the Roman industry from the Hellenis- tic.26 Several beautifully decorated jugs with beauti- ful silver, or even gold, inlay have been suggested as work of this age, though possibly all are Ro- man.27 Unquestionably Roman Imperial and fair- 21 Ashmole, op.cit. 10-15, figs. 7-10, 17, 19-22. 22 I might also suggest for membership in this group a Silenus in the Louvre, No. 4260. It has been described as a dancer, yet the tiny legs seem relaxed and almost too weak to carry out a dance step under the weight of the body. The Silenus could sit on the rim of a jug, there being a groove to fit the rim; the handle proper would be attached in his back where there is a circular hole. The jug would be very large and it would date before the end of the sixth century. 23 Langlotz, Griechische Vasen in Wiirzburg pl. 0o, No. I 16. 24Leyden, No. I, 1922/4/23; Ashmolean, No. 1934-337, Beazley, ARV 754, No. 22, by the Shuvalov Painter; Brussels, Cinquantenaire R 379, Beazley, ARV 746, No. 81 and CVA (fasc.

With stock decoration on the handle (the com- monest is Medusa or other woman's head below, griffin above, stalk and leaves in relief on the han- dle), they were prevalent before the destruction of Pompeii and continued until the third century of our era. For ease and speed of manufacture they were made in four parts--base, body, neck with spout, and handle--and put together on an assem- bly line.28 Very frequently they are associated with a patera, this also of standardized type, usually hav- ing a ribbed handle terminated by a ram's head.29 This association might suggest that Heuzey's origi- nal interpretation of the long-beaked jug as a ritual vessel was correct, were it not for the fact that most jugs seem to have been so used at one time or an- other."8 Again, the rather limited dispersion of these objects suggests a specialized function. The known sources are few, though no longer limited to Dodona as when Heuzey wrote. The list as it now stands embraces the sanctuaries of Dodona and Perachora, the graves at Trebenischte, the graves around Carthage and, for remarkably few, un- known source. The conspicuous absence of this type from the other important cities and sanctuaries may be an accident, but it may reflect some special use for the objects. At the moment one cannot safely venture an opinion on the usage of these truly beautiful bronze jugs. THE WALTERS ART GALLERY cording to De Ridder, Froehner denied that the handle belonged and Radnoti, op.cit. 139, agrees that it does not.
