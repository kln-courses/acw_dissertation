<plain_text><page sequence="1">1 04 VOLUME 74, NUMBERS 3 &amp; 4 Southern Methodists and Social Reform, 1900-1940 Wayne Flynt Of all the stereotypes used to describe (or misrepresent) the South 's ordinary people, none have been more persistent than those that deal with Southern religion. Many of these stereotypes derive from Southerners themselves, people who have been alienated by the religion they criticize. Wilbur J. Cash, son of devout Baptist parents and graduate of the denomination's leading North Carolina college, Wake Forest, wrote thusly of Southern evangelicalism in his classic work The Mind of the South: What our Southerner required... was a faith as simple and emotional as him- self. A faith to draw men together in hordes, to terrify them with Apocalyptic rhetoric, to cast them into the pit, rescue them, and at last bring them shouting into the fold of Grace. A faith, not of liturgy and prayer book, but of primitive frenzy and the blood sacrifice - often of fits and jerks and barks. The God demanded was an anthropomorphic God - the Jehovah of the Old Testament: A God who might be seen, a God who had been seen. A passionate, whimsical tyrant, to be trembled before, but whose favor was the sweeter for that. A per- sonal God, a God for the individualist, a God whose representatives were not silken priests but preachers risen from the people themselves. What was demanded here, in other words, was the God and the faith of the Methodists and the Baptists, and the Presbyterians. Of new currents entering American thought in the late 19th century, Cash continued: "Darwin, Huxley, Ben Butler, Sherman, Satan - all these came to figure in Southern feeling as very nearly a single person. And 'infidel, atheistic, and Yankeeizing' would be a formula which, explicitly or implicitly, would be repeated ten thousand times in these years." Of the industrialization of the South, Cash wrote: A small group of the younger Methodist ministers who either had come under the influence of the new learning and the new spirit in the Southern schools or had been brought into contact with modern sociology at Northern universities and theological seminaries, had indeed begun to show signs of concern about the condition of labor in the South. The Baptists and Presbyterians, too, had a few men of the same stamp. But most of these were too timid to risk challenging the plainly overwhelming Southern sentiment, and I can't say that I much blame them. On the other hand, open denunciation of the strikers from the pulpit, or denunciation by innuendo was common. Men should live together as brothers - WAYNE FLYNT is University Distinguished Professor of History, Auburn University.</page><page sequence="2">INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE REVIEW 105 such was the burden of the pronouncements, with the clear implication that it was only the strikers who were to blame for the fact that they did not.1 Although the distinguished historian C. Vann Woodward disagreed with Cash about the continuity of Southern history, he did not challenge Cash's negative analysis of Southern religion. In fact, Woodward's magisterial Origins of the New South (recently voted by American historians as one of the ten most influential history books of the twen- tieth century) does not even have an index reference to religion. And when Woodward discussed the subject at all, he was dismissive of it. Arguing that the three dominant movements in early twentieth century American Christianity (ecumenism, the Social Gospel, and theological liberalism) were largely absent in the South, Woodward contrasts such liberal movements to the conservatism of the Nashville Christian Advocate, whose editor wrote that "No amount of interest in matters that are occur[r]ing in this world can be an effective substitute for an intelligent concern in matters that lie within the sphere of the world to come."2 Since Woodward's magnum opus, many notable historians of Southern religion, including Sam Hill, the dean of southern religious studies, and John Boles, editor of The Journal of Southern History, have reached similar conclusions.3 During the past thirty years, I have argued a different opinion about Southern evangeli- calism, notably about Baptists and Methodists. Beginning with an essay in The Journal of Southern History in 1969 and culminating in the publication of Alabama Baptists in September, 1998, I have depicted more diversity among Southern evangelicals than most of my colleagues have recognized.4 Although I do not dispute their fundamental premise - that Southern religion was more Biblically grounded, conversion-oriented, and individual- istic than Christianity in other regions - 1 do not necessarily interpret this as "bad" nor do I believe this conclusion sufficiently captures the diversity within Southern evangelicalism. To be sure, there is a downside to such religion, as Cash, Woodward, Hill and Boles make clear. Notably it was mobilized on behalf of slavery, segregation, the power of an unjust economic and political elite that ruled the South for decades, and of hierarchical male values that oppressed women in various ways. Unfortunately, however, we have been too willing to throw out baby with bath water. Southern evangelicalism also forged amazing ties of kinship and community that continue to resist the atomization of American society. Such religion undergirds Southern literature as demonstrated by generations of Southern novelists who have used not only the cadence of Biblical language but also the Biblical estimate of the human condition. From William Faulkner to Flannery O'Connor to Walker Percy, themes of guilt, providence, judgment, and grace permeate Southern literature. Indeed, the literary ethicist for adolescent Americans, Harper Lee (whose novel To Kill a Mockingbird was cited in a 1991 poll by the Library of Congress as second only to the Bible as the book that made the greatest difference in read- ers' lives), grew up in the loving home of Methodist laypeople in Monroeville, Alabama. Biblicism may have its downside, but it at least provided a core of classical literacy to generations of Southerners, white and black, not necessarily found elsewhere. Are we better off for such Biblically-based, no-nonsense religion? Consider an article in The New York Times that I read in early January, 1984. The story concerned the Sugar</page><page sequence="3">1 06 VOLUME 74, NUMBERS 3 &amp; 4 Bowl, where Auburn had narrowly defeated the University of Michigan to claim a share of the NCAA football championship. I could hardly wait to read the Times ' choice of national champion. Instead, the usually astute and insightful columnist Ira Berkow treated his readers to an essay on the connection between Southern religion and Southern football (yes! There is a difference between them). Observing a sign with a scriptural reference in the New Orleans Super Dome during the game, Berkow speculated about the religious fervor of Southern football fans: "Sometimes these fans.. .also bring signs, or banners, often written on bed sheets, and a few even have Biblical chapter and verse, like 'Job 3:16' -the men- tion of which, it seems, is to give the stamp of celestial approval to football."5 After rereading the paragraph to make sure I had read the name of the Old Testament book correctly, I smiled in quiet contemplation at the thought of thousands of otherwise- sophisticated New Yorkers puzzling over the mystical football wisdom contained in Job 3:16: "Or why was I not hidden in the ground like a stubborn child, like an infant who never saw the light of day?" Of course the reference on the bed sheet that day in New Orleans was to John 3:16 -as even an uneducated Southern waitress, truck driver, or janitor would have known. Furthermore, the message was designed to convert viewers by the message of God's grace, not to "give the stamp of celestial approval to football." Television viewers of the 1984 Sugar Bowl were like outraged Auburn University facul- ty members who recently were ambushed on the elevator by fervent young evangelicals in the high-rise building where I teach. They were merely targets of evangelical opportunity. How unlike Mr. Berkow's world is the familiarity of Biblical language within Southern culture, where terms that mystify outsiders ("born again," "saved by grace") are routine parts of conversation. Where Bible reading is stamped on some of our money. And where, according to a 1989 poll, Bible reading was the most popular lifestyle activity in Birmingham, Alabama, outpacing fishing, hunting, watching sports, or even entering sweepstakes.6 During the spring 1984 student government elections at Auburn University (only months before I read Berkow's essay), I was treated to an intriguing variety of religious language. The winner of the SGA presidential election, by a margin small enough to be considered a "miracle," explained his victory: "Praise God! Thanks to God! I would like to thank Jesus Christ above all by far. Next I thank the Sigma Pi fraternity. They have really been incredible." Such language, naive and unsophisticated though it be, is neither contrived nor hypo- critical within the context of Southern culture, nor do many Southerners feel particularly self-conscious using it. I doubt, however, that you would find such language recorded in the student newspapers at Berkeley or Ann Arbor or New Haven. In fact many non- Southerners probably react to such language as one of the characters does in Walker Percy's novel Lancelot: "Christ, if heaven is full of Southern Baptists, I'd rather rot in hell with Saladin and Achilles."7 Beyond the obvious role that religion plays in helping make spiritual sense out of "the reality we live in," there is a second important issue, whether the religion is individualistic or collective, conversionist or social gospel, revivalistic or cerebral. How does religion relate the believer to society? And how much Social Gospel thought moved South</page><page sequence="4">INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE REVIEW 107 between 1900 and 1940? Conventional wisdom answers none or next-to-none. Because the Social Gospel is associated with the Protestant response to industrialism and urban- ization in the North, such wisdom goes, it made no inroads into the South. Considered in one way, it is possible to resolve this debate by misdefining the term. If the Social Gospel is conceived as emphasis upon social change to the exclusion of con- version, then the South generally avoided this heresy.8 But that definition seems too constrained even for Northern advocates of social Christianity. Many of them (including the liberal New York City Baptist minister Walter Rauschenbusch) have been accused of being too individualistic, of arguing that social change was a way of making the love of God incarnate in the world, thus hastening con- version.9 Such religion was a means to an end, a method of manifesting God's grace, of following "in His steps." Whenever advocates of the Social Gospel emphasized social action as an alternative to conversion, Southern evangelicals backed away from it. But many of them perceived no theological problem with a more holistic gospel that endorsed social concern as an integral element of the gospel itself. How could conversion be made manifest, they reasoned, unless Christians gave evidence of change within their social, economic, and political lives? Nor did they rely entirely upon the doctrine of the "spirituality of the church," a belief that converted people could be counted on as individuals to extend justice by their dis- connected personal piety. Many Southern Protestants endorsed a fundamental assumption of the Social Gospel: born again Christians must act in concert, must exert political and economic power on behalf of justice within society. Although my efforts thus far have focused on the most unlikely practitioners of social Christianity, Southern Baptists, I have been collecting materials on the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, for three decades. In fact, I nearly had a brain seizure in 1982 when John Patrick McDowell published his book The Social Gospel in the South. Upon encountering McDowell's title, I had a brief glimpse of every historian's worst nightmare: to spend a third of one's life researching a topic, only to discover a book about it just as he begins to write. McDowell's book, however, focuses on a much narrower segment of the topic, the Social Gospel work of the Woman's Home Mission Movement within the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. I am still amazed that so many historians ignore McDowell's research, a fact I can only attribute to the hard-headed refusal of historians to admit they are mistaken even when contrary evidence is presented to them. Without bela- boring the subject with a detailed summary of McDowell's book, suffice it to say that he demonstrates pretty conclusively that Southern Methodist women between 1886 and 1939 augmented their traditional Christian agenda of promoting family stability, prohibi- tion, and conversion with crusades on behalf of fairer treatment of African Americans, immigrants, and women, in favor of world peace, and against child labor. No less a reformer than Will Alexander could write in 1921 that he had become convinced that "the Woman's Missionary Council of the M.E. Church, South, was the most progressive and constructive religious group in the South.'"0 What I propose to do is to enlarge upon McDowell's conclusion by examining some sources he did not utilize. I will begin in Alabama during the years between 1900 and 1930, the era that spawned the Social Gospel nationally. Alabama is correctly assumed to be a conservative state in both politics and religion. If one is searching for evidence of</page><page sequence="5">1 08 VOLUME 74, NUMBERS 3 &amp; 4 the conservatism among Methodists, it is easy to find. In 1923 the North Alabama Methodist Conference condemned theological Modernism, and six years later it adopted a memorial preventing anyone from preaching or teaching in a Methodist institution or editing a journal who did not believe in the inspiration of Scripture, the Virgin Birth as well as the death and resurrection of Christ.11 There is no doubt that Alabama Methodists considered social advocacy subsidiary to conversion. There is also no doubt that the Social Gospel penetrated their thought and actions. The influence came by way of direct contact with Northern advocates of the Social Gospel, by way of exposure of Methodist ministers and laypeople to college and seminary teach- ers, effective organizing by members of the Woman's Home Mission Movement, and as the result of urban and labor disruption in the Birmingham industrial district. In 1906, for instance, Shailer Matthews, a prominent leader of the Social Gospel movement, religious sociologist and professor at the University of Chicago, presented a series of twelve lec- tures in Birmingham on the life and teachings of Jesus. The editor of the Alabama Christian Advocate (whose circulation of 10,000 made it one of the largest papers in Alabama) praised the lectures, which helped accelerate new thinking about the applica- tion of Christianity to the state's problems.12 After speakers at the 1903 M.E. Church, South, national meeting in St. Louis called for creation of city missions to address urban problems, the editor of the Alabama Christian Advocate noted that new kinds of human problems demanded new approaches to home missions: The old order of things, simply preaching on Sundays, will have to give place to plans that embrace some earnest effort to better the conditions of living in the slums, in the tenements, in the factory settlements and wherever the blight of poverty and ignorance and vice rests upon men... The average man will take our declaration of interest in his soul with a large grain of salt, where we manifest no interest in his body - in the problems of his daily life that bear down on him and perplex him."13 The institutional expression of such changing theology was the settlement house, an agency already well developed in the urban North. A series of influential Methodist lead- ers began to lobby for creation of "open churches" containing free kindergartens, gymna- siums, and other social facilities. They argued that such efforts would convince the poor and industrial laborers that Methodists cared for them. "The most religious thing," argued one essay in the state denominational paper, "may be to teach a boy the multiplication table, or give him a place to read or rest or bathe or play, and not a 'meeting,' because "mere preaching is not doing the work."14 Methodist women implemented these ideas in Birmingham in June 1903 when two churches organized a settlement house with a free kindergarten, a sewing school for girls, a boys' club, and night school for working children. Professionally trained Methodist deaconesses staffed the facility. Called Wesley House, the building behind Avondale Mills quickly became inadequate to accommodate the crowds that made use of its facili- ties. By 1912 a second Wesley House - containing kindergarten, playground, and domes- tic science classes - had been organized at the TCI steel plant in Ensley.15</page><page sequence="6">INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE REVIEW 109 Methodist women in Mobile began similar work in 1904. Offering programs similar to Birmingham's Wesley Houses, the Mobile facility provided English courses to immi- grants, a library, a secondhand clothing store, a day nursery for working women, and a free medical clinic (staffed by five volunteer physicians). By 1912 these activities were housed in a spacious two-story structure downtown.16 In 1913 settlement house work expanded to Attalla, a mill town near Gadsden. The next year a Wesley House opened in Montgomery.17 Although settlement houses have been criticized as agents of middle class social control and of limited value to poor and working class people, these arguments seem no more applicable to Methodist settlement houses in Alabama than to similar facilities in Gary, Indiana. If they were manipulative and patronizing, they were manipulative and patronizing in both regions. Contact with working class women liberalized the attitudes of many middle class Alabama Methodist women who worked in such facilities. By 1913 Alabama Methodist women endorsed a maximum eight-hour workday, the elimination of night work for women, better sanitation and safety appliances for women, separate toilets for men and women, chairs at workplaces, pensions for working mothers, women factory inspectors, and a minimum wage law.18 By the standards of the times, this was a liberal agenda and one bitterly resisted by corporations and the state's conservative Democratic elite. Such personal contact with the poor also fueled growing rage over child labor abuses in the state. The Christian Advocate published dozens of editorials condemning child labor, many of them quite emotional. The editor in 1902 described children "of tender years... bound to the slavery of the mill in utter disregard of all humanitarian considera- tions." That the legislature allowed such conditions to continue only proved that "money talked louder than sentiment," that Alabama people were willing to swap "Southern babies for Yankee dollars..." Methodists carefully monitored reform legislation in the 1907 legislature and played a key role in its passage. The 1913 Alabama Woman's Missionary Society meeting in Huntsville featured a speaker who asked how Methodists could honor the commandment "Thou shalt not kill," yet allow "laws which permit this to happen to women and children who toil?'"9 Nor were Alabama Methodists indifferent to a series of labor disturbances that wracked Alabama early in the century. Denominational editors called for binding arbitra- tion when strikes occurred, a position often endorsed by organized labor. Methodists also championed the right of workers to organize, a right resisted by Alabama industrialists. Methodists grew increasingly critical of the barbarous system of leasing state convicts to private companies that often abused them. And individual Methodist ministers sometimes defended the demands of striking workers as morally just.20 A series of violent strikes by coal miners left Alabama Methodists deeply divided. They deplored economic anarchy and demanded the restoration of law and order. But those who worked with miners understood that new attitudes were necessary to reach them for the gospel. The state chaplain to prisoners, who made up much of the mine force, advised pastors to "have a miner's suit, cap and lamp" and go inside the mines to seek men at their work. Methodists should build their own church houses in mine camps: Under the present management of the company, furnishing so very generous- ly for the preacher, it is not the best for the church in the end. There is danger of</page><page sequence="7">1 1 0 VOLUME 74, NUMBERS 3 &amp; 4 the laboring men counting the preacher as one of the company, and it is a known fact that in many places there is not the best of feeling between the men and the company. Pastors made a mistake to oppose unions, he added. They would do well to seek advisory, non-voting membership in the United Mine Workers if they truly sought to reach miners. Another pastor to miners advised Methodists that preaching alone would not convert them because they viewed ministers with such suspicion.21 Throughout the era, reports of the state Methodist Social Service Commission tried to strike a balance between "individual salvation" and "social salvation." Social concern was required because of "syndicated sin." In 1910 the Commission of the Alabama Conference praised Virginia courts for upholding a ten-hour law for women workers, "thereby establishing the principle that working conditions are not to be regulated by cor- porate greed, but upon the ground of health and public welfare." That same year the Alabama Conference of Charities and Corrections endorsed creation of a national depart- ment of public health, establishment of a federal children's bureau, abolition of the con- vict lease system, and establishment of a state home for mentally handicapped children. Speakers attacked child labor and the neglect of convicts and the mentally ill to applause from the Methodist Social Service Commission, the editor of the Alabama Christian Advocate , and a pastor who said that he would "rather have his people attend such a con- ference than to have a series of conventional evangelistic meetings in his church."22 Although the Methodist approach to solving social problems often consisted of a sim- plistic application of the "Golden Rule" to complex social and economic problems, the denomination was slowly moving toward greater engagement in social problems during the first two decades of the century. Such interest receded during the 1920s although it did not disappear entirely. Women at denominational colleges such as Randolph Macon and Converse served on committees for student-industrial cooperation seeking to Christianize the social order. They helped staff summer institutes for factory girls that by 1927 had evolved into the Southern Summer School for Women Workers in Industry, which produced many New Deal labor organizers. Methodist women also played a major role in the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching, which at its peak enrolled some 40,000 small town and rural church women.23 The cataclysm of the Great Depression demanded even more dramatic modification of traditional theology. According to one historian, Southern Methodists demonstrated more concern for Southern workers than any other regional denomination during the 1930s. By adopting the social creed of the Federal Council of Churches in 1 934, the denomination endorsed the right of laborers to organize. And the official church journal, the Nashville Christian Advocate , pursued the most liberal policy of any Southern church publication, frequently attacking capitalism and assailing the profit motive.24 Enhanced sensitivity to social injustice is obvious in letters from Methodist clergymen written to Franklin D. Roosevelt in the fall of 1935. Clergymen wrote in response to a form letter from the president addressed to half the nation's 200,000 clergymen in September 1935. The letter asked ministers to describe conditions in their communities. Nearly a third responded, including 34 identified as ministers of the M.E. Church, South, pastoring in Florida. Some ministers praised the WPA, Social Security Act, and New</page><page sequence="8">INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE REVIEW 1 1 1 Deal programs in general. Others attacked the New Deal for destroying the work ethic, ignoring the need for national repentance, or for repealing the Eighteenth Amendment. (One angry Methodist minister wrote that FDR was dominated by bad advice from "wets, Romanticists, and the Tammany politicians" who ran New York City.)25 Responses from Florida Methodist ministers were overwhelmingly favorable, and where unfavorable they often as not criticized the New Deal from the left, for doing too little to help the poor and unemployed.26 The pastor of Morrison Memorial Methodist Church in Leesburg praised the Social Security Act as "The greatest thing in this day and time," as "Christian and democratic in spirit." The pastor of Centenary Methodist Church in Quincy considered the act in harmony with the teachings of Christ: "When private enterprise breaks down," he wrote, "and a man has no way to make a living for himself and family, then Christian Civilization must give him a job and the government is the ser- vant of Christian Civilization." The pastor of Mount Pleasant Methodist Church in Bradenton called the Social Security Act "the greatest humanitarian law ever attempted by a Congress of our great nation." "No President," he added, "ever attempted to relieve human suffering on such a far-reaching and Christlike basis, as you have consentiously [sic] done..." The pastor of Edgewood Methodist Church in Fort Myers agreed that the act was consistent with the Biblical concern for the poor and helpless.27 Some pastors added a more sweeping indictment of economic injustice. The pastor of First Methodist Church in Orlando wrote that the primary concern of both religion and government should be feeding and clothing people, not protecting markets. Some more just basis should be found for distributing the nation's goods than the daily wages of workers. He praised the New Deal's departure "from the beaten path" of politics and its concern for the common man.28 The Methodist minister at Bagdad Church in Milton praised the Civilian Conservation Corps, but complained that Roosevelt was doing too little to help tenant farmers. He also chided Milton's business community for putting profits "above personal welfare of the masses."29 Rev. D.L. Jones, pastor of Methodist churches near Madison, called himself a "100% Democrat" whose circuit consisted mainly of churches filled with poor people. His objection to the New Deal was that too much relief money went to supervisors and too little to the poor themselves.30 Ministers in Zephyrhills and Tampa praised FDR's concern for the poor but preferred more drastic legislative remedies such as the Townsend Plan for the elderly or Huey Long's "share the wealth" plan. They perceived the federal government as an employer of last resort for men over age 45. 31 The presiding elder of the Methodist church in Lakeland urged the president to raise taxes on "excessive incomes" and reduce money spent on armaments. He favored staged reductions in expenditures for arms until complete disarmament occurred. "We are not going to have peace," he wrote, "until we make some ventures for peace, and we should be willing to sacrifice as much for peace as we have been willing to sacrifice in war."32 Overall, Florida Methodist ministers challenged the economic status quo more than they affirmed it. In conclusion, let me reiterate that I do not contend that Methodists living in the South capitulated to the Social Gospel. I do not claim that the episodes I report in this essay are</page><page sequence="9">1 1 2 VOLUME 74, NUMBERS 3 &amp; 4 typical or representative of the M.E. Church, South. But I do insist that historians have traditionally ignored the significant diversity within Southern evangelicalism. While con- tinuing to affirm the centrality of evangelism and conversion, Southern Methodists between 1900 and 1940 did adopt many aspects of social Christianity. Jim Wallis, editor of Sojourner magazine, wrote recently in the Soul of Politics that the second most frequently mentioned theme in the Old Testament was justice for the poor, the oppressed, for widows and orphans. Christ identified himself with the same causes, Wallis added. And on the basis of that theology, Wallis insists that evangelicalism must recapture a commitment to social justice.33 Had Wallis written his book three-quarters- of-a-century earlier, a substantial number of Southern Methodists would have finished reading the last page, and muttered a fervent "Amen!"
