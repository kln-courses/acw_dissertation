Sanday, D.D., H. Scott Holland, D.D., Η. H. Williams, M.A., A. C. Headlam, D.D. (Longmans, 1911.) Miracles Miracles and Christianity. By Johannes Wendland, D.Theol., translated by H. R. Macintosh, D.D. (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 191!.) A book written to controvert another book is notoriously difficult to judge fairly, apart from the object of its attack, and a review of the first volume on our list must assume some previous acquaintance with Mr J. M. Thompson's Miracles in the New Testament, from which the writers of the little symposium profoundly dissent. Dr Sanday indeed applauds the transparent sincerity of the author and expresses himself not sorry that a book should have been written which aims at answering a plain י yes' or ' no' to certain plain questions. But he is too experienced a theologian to allow that all questions can be or should be thus answered, and he deprecates a too positive and peremptory tone in handling them. His unfailing generosity and largeness of mind lead him to look for points of agreement rather than for points of difference; but behind the sympathy and commendation there seems to sound the senior's grave warning to the young man in a hurry :— ' Magna petis, Phaethon, et quae non viribus istis conveniant.' Dr Sanday tells us that he wrote most of his sermon before reading Mr Thompson's book, and while he predicts with singular accuracy both the line of argument and the conclusions, he devotes a bare quarter of his remarks to the book itself. Dr Lock, again, in his brief but valuable paper on ' the literary criticism of the Gospels in relation to miracles ' only alludes indirectly to Mr Thompson. He deals with two current contentions, (a) that the miraculous element in the New Testament increases proportionately to the lateness of the documents, and (6) that on the analogy of Old Testament writings we may regard New Testament miracle stories as invented or elaborated for purposes of edification. The first of these arguments, which is the corner-stone of Mr Thompson's building, is met by the very reasonable suggestion that the movement of the later documents is not to more distant points in the periphery, but from the surface to the centre, marking an advance from incompleteness to completeness in the portraiture of the Lord. The second argument</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 613 which Mr Thompson mentions with approval though he does not develope it at length, is shewn to be unjust to the evangelists, who clearly knew the difference between fact and fiction, and to be a solvent too potent for its purpose, since under its general application all the recorded events of the Gospel might easily evaporate, works of healing with nature miracles, Crucifixion with Resurrection, and the rest. The other contributors are more pointed in their attack. Thus Dr Headlam, taking Professor Kirsopp Lake on the way, has little difficulty in demonstrating the ά priori character of Mr Thompson's critical method and appreciation of evidence. Professor Scott Holland, in his chapter ' The conditions of Gospel criticism', indicates the identity of the Gospel Christology with that of the after Creed; and Mr Williams criticizes the philosophical and scientific equipment of the book, discloses the bias of its argumentation, and sketches some results of the י unlimited supernaturalism without miracle' to which Mr Thompson looks forward with complacency. Two eloquent sermons by Professor Scott Holland go to make up the volume, which is well worth reading for their sake alone. Yet we cannot but feel that although Mr Thompson comes out of his ordeal with marks of severe usage, the root from which his book springs has hardly been reached. The late Professor John Mayor was wont to deprecate with some vehemence piecemeal resistance to opinion with which he disagreed. ' Do not give it the advertisement of an answer he would say; ' write a good constructive book on the same subject.' Any one of the writers, who in these papers and sermons have probed the joints of Mr Thompson's harness, is competent and more than competent to profit by that shrewd advice and undertake the larger task. We wish we could hope for its speedy accomplishment. Meanwhile it must be confessed that, formidable as is the artillery employed on this occasion, it has not found the range. When the smoke clears away, the flag is still seen flying bravely on the opposite fort. The truth is that whereas Miracles in the New Testament is modern of the moderns, the collective reply to it seems written, not indeed from the knowledge, but in the accents of thirty years ago, and many of the arguments are rather calculated to confirm the faith of those who resent attacks upon old-fashioned orthodoxy than to convert those who are touched with the new ideas. The Archbishop of Albi wrote the other day: ' A l'heure pr£sente et pour beaucoup d'esprits, les miracles sont plutdt un obstacle kk croire qu'un moyen de croire. L'intelligence moderne, fagonnee dans le moule soi-disant scientifique, devenue trfes exigeante en fait de d£mon stration, se trouve plutot mal k l'aise en face d'un miracle. Chez ceux lk meme que le surnaturel n'effraie pas, on devine une gene, une hesitation, une incertitude, un pourquoi, un peut-etre.' There are</page><page sequence="3">614 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES indeed hundreds of young men who after reading Miracles will still asking, 'Are we really to believe that devils spoke, and entered into swine, that loaves were actually multiplied in the hands of disciples, that the law of gravitation was suspended, etc. ?' To such enquirers we cannot too strongly recommend the volume which, under the title of Miracles Miracles and Christianity, comes to us from Bale. Professor Wendland is, as his translator Dr H. R. Macintosh says, at once modern, relevant, and positive. He has a firm grasp of essential principles, he knows what religion is, and he gives a far better idea of miracle than is conveyed by the dictionary definition upon which Mr Thompson takes his stand. 'Miracles are acts of God', writes Wendland, 'bringing a new condition of things to pass which was not implicit in the existing state of the world.' To this he adds as corollary that miracles must have a religious significance, i. e. have reference to man's salvation,' since God can only be known in religious experience.' This brings miracles within the region of reality and posits the constant and unwearied activity of God, who is at once transcendent and immanent (chapter i). Starting with this idea, Wendland proceeds to shew that the Biblical belief in miracle answers to it. According to the Scriptures of either covenant, miracles are mighty works which reveal the character of God's working in the world (chapter ii). Chapter iii deals at some length with the conception of miracle in Christian history. The use of miracle as external evidence was unknown till Augustine, who distinguished events arising from causes inherent in the world from events derivable from semina occulta, causes hidden in God. This distinction, which tends unduly to separate the acts of God immanent from those of God transcendent, paved the way for the unfortunate scholastic difference between miracula (which God alone can do) and mirabilia (which demons and magicians can do). Luther felt it impossible to frame a conceptual definition of miracle, and left it to religious feeling to decide what is and what is not miracle, outside the Bible, the literal authority of which was not yet impugned. The variations in the conception of miracle which scientific criticism has brought about, in Germany at least, are carefully followed, down to Schleiermacher, who set thought in the right path when he said, ' Miracle is only the religious name for an event.' But Schleiermacher, while tracing every thing back to God, denied the possibility of a new influx of divine life from a transcendent sphere. Wendland indicates the deistic danger (from which Schleiermacher was saved by his personal piety) of reducing the divine government of the world to a mechanical process (the chiquenaudechiquenaude of Descartes) and describes the attempts to avoid the pitfall on the part of later German theologians (chapter iii).</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 615 Then in chapters iv and ν he boldly claims that a new and original element was added to the sum of things by the advent of our Lord, whose redeeming action brings about the greatest of all miracles, viz. the spiritual, ' which is so much a fact of experience in religious life that to deny it would be equivalent to the denial of religion.' In chapter vi the relation of miracle to providence is discussed. Faith in providence, which implies that every event with power to touch us inwardly is of God's appointment, begins with personal experience and broadens out into a general view of things, for no sharp line can be drawn between the inner and the outward life of man. This leads naturally to the question of prayer, which is treated with a tenderness and patience that contrast agreeably with Mr Thompson's curt dismissal of a modern prayer story (' comment is unnecessary'). Prayer is the true differentia between Christianity and Stoicism. The Christian must believe that prayer has power to change the course of things. God's hearing of prayer is a miracle (chapter vii). In chapter viii Wendland shews that miracles as defined by him, viz. events with a religious content, defy the dogmatism of Hume and all his school. Events indeed which contradict all the analogies of possible human experience are inconceivable, and apologetic attempts to justify them are doomed to failure. Here Wendland seems to join hands with Mr Thompson. But he introduces a caveat·. (1) Religious experience must not be left out of account; (2) the unique revelation vouchsafed in Jesus Christ may be held to justify a belief in occurrences which transcend the analogies of human experience. Only, adds Wendland, the analogy of Christ's general action renders it improbable that He would on isolated occasions break through the natural order to which His life conformed. With regard to the Resurrection, ' the foundation stone on which the Christian church is fixed', Wendland says, 'the Christian must believe that the appearances of Christ represent a real intrusion of the ... living Christ risen from the dead ... the modes and ways in which it was possible for Jesus to manifest Himself... must remain dark, for what is supersensible escapes ... from the tests of scientific enquiry.' However, the idea of a bodily resurrection of the Lord is not the only possible form our faith ' may take'. The last and most difficult chapter (ix) deals with miracle in relation to causality and natural law. Various false views of cause are examined, such as that which regards cause as necessarily equivalent to effect, or that cause is the sum of all relevant conditions. Cause is rather the liberating energy in nature; everything that happens is not unequivo cally determined, nor is every process the inevitable outcome of the existing phase in the cosmos. There is a possibility of new beginnings, of a creative action of God, i. e. of miracle. God's rule is not</page><page sequence="5">616 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES mechanical; though it is orderly, it cannot be finally expressed in any law or system of laws. The laws of nature are merely surveys of the universe from particular points of view ; it is grossly anthropomorphic to conceive of them as entities governing the world. The 'coming event' is never unalterably fixed by empirical connexions or uni formities ; hence faith in providence, prayer, and free moral action are all possible. Now, whatever the reader may think of Professor Wendland's con elusions on points of detail, it will be clear from the foregoing imperfect but I hope not unfair summary, that his book is likely to have a stimulating and bracing effect on drooping spirits. His reminder that miracle does not violate immutable laws, since these are a figment born of imperfect knowledge, will correct hasty judgement; his trust in the objective power of prayer has a practical present value ; above all, his teaching that faith in miracle is faith in a living God gives help at the point where the debate begins between belief and disbelief. There is little to criticize in his presentment of his case. Perhaps some English readers will grow weary under his review of Protestant German theology; and it is certain that his zeal for Luther has allowed him to be less than just to Augustine. For Luther was not the first to put spiritual miracles in their proper place above external miracles of sense. His famous sermon for Ascensiontide is at least foreshadowed in the words: Ecce maiora fecit praedicatus a credentibus quarn locutus audientibusaudientibus . . . intelligat qui potest, iudicet qui potest', utrum maius sit iustosiustos creare quam impios iustificare (Aug. Tr. in Ioh. lxxii). The translation has been well done, although the German cast of sentence persists, and it is not always clear, as it would be in the original and as a judicious use of inverted commas would render it in English, whether the author is speaking or making a quotation.
