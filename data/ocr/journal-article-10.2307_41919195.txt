<plain_text><page sequence="1">OCCUPATIONAL CHANGES AMONG HINDU TEMPLE SERVANTS1 JAMES M. FREEMAN Under what circumstances and in what ways do people in a conserva- tive Hindu community choose to alter their life-ways ? What effects do population growth and new economic opportunities have on a community traditionally resistant to change and to outside influences? Specifically, what happens to ritual specialists in a temple complex when they are con- fronted for the first time with the chance to radically and rapidly change their lives? What do such people do when the opportunity for securing new, high paying jobs can only be realized at the expense of abandoning their centuries-old religious occupations? I propose to answer these questions by reporting about Kapileswar, a Hindu temple village in the state of Orissa in Eastern India. The data is drawn from my two field studies of this village, one in 1962-63, and the other my present follow-up study still in progress in 1970-71. Kapileswar is a multi-caste village suburb of about 2700 persons adjacent to the ancient temple town of Bhubaneshwar. In 1947 Bhubaneshwar, a stronghold of orthodox Hindu values and a well-known pilgrim centre, was selected as the site where a new state capital city was to be built. The inhabitants of the old temple town and its surrounding village-suburbs found themselves suddenly and inescapably caught between two worlds and forced to choose between them. The sudden juxtaposition of the old and the new thus created virtually unparallelled conditions for the study of the modernization of a traditional community. The Mallia - A Conservative Caste of Temple Servants This paper focuses on the Mallia, the largest caste of the village, with 1028 persons, or thirty-seven per cent of the village population. The Mallia are found only in Kapileswar. Their hereditary occupation is service to the deity of the Kapileswar temple. Although they are considered a high caste in the village, their exact status is a matter of controversy. The dispute over ritual status is similar to those described for many Indian communities.2 Some Mallia claim to be Brahmans and they point to their hereditary occupation as proof, while rival Brahmans reject their claims. There is agreement, however, that prior to Indian Independence and the founding</page><page sequence="2">2 Indian Anthropologist of the new state capital city of Bhubaneswar, the Mallia controlled the village of Kapileswar. They based their power on their position as here- ditary managers of the Shiva temple of Kapileswar, their control of most of the temple lands, their overwhelming numerical strength, and their cus- tom of village endogamy. This is an unusual custom in coastal Orissa, and it gave the Mallia greater cohesion than other castes in the village, whose relatives were thinly spread in an inter-village network. The temple dominated the economic, political, and ritual life of most of the villagers. Seventy-three per cent of the families in Kapileswar received some economic benefit from the temple. Several castes, headed by the Mallia, held tax-free paddy lands and tax-free house plots for their per- formance of specialized interdependent hereditary services in the temple.8 It was no accident that the Mallia were an unusally conservative caste. Prior to Independence there was very little disruption of their economic and political power. In many parts of Orissa British land laws established in the 19th Century led to widespread confiscation and sale of previously unalienable lands for non-payment of taxes. At the same time, however, the British preserved the lands of religious institutions such as the Kapileswar temple, and other more famous pilgrim centres such as Bhubaneswar and Puri, as non-taxable and non-salable.4 Thus, the lands of Kapileswar did not come onto the market. Consequently, until the establishment of the New Capital, the economic and political power of the Mallia and other traditionally privileged castes of Kapileswar remained almost intact, and the economic advantages of serving in the temple encouraged the Mallia to retain their hereditary occupation. The Kapileswar Temple and the Traditional Mallia Life-Style Throughout India there are temples which serve as regional and sometimes all-India pilgrim centres, provide a livelihood for many castes devoted to the care of the deities and properties of the temples, and fre- quently have many social and educational functions.5 The Kapileswar temple has fewer activities and simpler than those of the great Indian temples. It is a secondary shrine in the Bhubaneswar pilgrim complex, and it caters mostly to local patrons. Although the Mallia have no hereditary services at the Lingaraj temple, the main shrine of Bhubaneswar, they pride themselves on being part of the sacred community of Bhubaneswar. According to local reli- gious tracts such as the Ekamra Purana, Kapileswar is said to lie within the sacred space ( khetra ) of Bhubaneswar. The boundaries of this space are said to be marked by four branches of a mythical mango tree, with a trunk which reaches the heavens. Within the sacred area of Bhubaneswar a number of shrines are considered related to each other. The key temple, Lingaraj, is designated</page><page sequence="3">Occupational Changes among Hindu Temple Servants 3 the king (raja) of the area. Deities in other temples are considered his relatives and courtly advisors. The deity of Kapileswar temple is called the Dewan or chief advisor of Lingaraj. This relationship is commemorated by an annual ritual in which the deputy, or travelling image of lingaraj, visits Kapileswar. In return, Kapilanath, the diety of Kapileswar, visits his superior twice a year, and in addition visits his own "vassal" village of Sunderpada once a year. He is accompanied by representatives of several castes whose turn to per- form hereditary services in the Kapileswar temple fall on that day. On the Sunderpada trip, for example, a confectioner supplies bhog, a form of sacred food, a cultivator plays gongs, milkmen carry the palanquin, while a Brahman and a Mallia carry flat umbrellas. A second Brahman lifts the deity in and out of the palanquin and offers the sacred food. Another Mallia directs the entire proceeding. These rituals reveal the dual nature of the deity and his economic significance for the villagers of Kapileswar. In this anthropomorphic role as king, the deity is served by twelve castes, in return for which they receive remuneration in goods, cash, and paddy lands. As a sacred object the deity draws pilgrims to the temple - an additional source of income for the Mallia who serve these pilgrims. Thus the deity provides a link between a sacred cosmology and daily activities in the village. Daily services at the Kapileswar temple continue the treatment of the deity as if he were a human king. He is bathed, clothed, fed four meals a day, entertained, and is put to bed at night. Meals contain rice, lentil6, sweets, and curds. This is prasad, another form of sacred food which is later sold to pilgrims. The major duties of caring for the deity fall to the Mallia and the Brahaman cooks. The Mallia is in charge of the total daily operation, while the Brahman prepares sacred food in the temple kitchen and presents it to the deity. Other castes provide goods or perform services when their presence is required. Encroachment on the temple duties of other castes, or improper per- formance of a caste's own duties, is stopped by other castes refusing to perform their duties, thus closing down the temple. Since this hurts all castes economically, it encourages settlement of disputes. These inter- dependent multicaste services reinforce the separation of castes on the basis of the ritual purity of the tasks performed, while also preventing the alter- ation of this system. The anthropomorphism of the deity extends to annual festivals. All sixteen festivals held at Kapileswar focus on life cycle rituals and other human activities attributed to the main deity or to subordinate deities. These include birthday, ritual bathing, marriage and sacred thread cere- monies as well as festivals when Kapilnath or his subordinates receive new clothes and special foods. Unlike ordinary days, when attendance at the temple is-sparse, festival</page><page sequence="4">4 Indian Anthropologist days draw large crowds of pilgrims. The Mallia have the exclusive privilege of serving them, assisted, on occasion, by Brahman cooks. The main Mallia activity for pilgrims consists of pouring water over the deity ("cool- ing" its poison). Occasionally pilgrims from other districts and states visiting Puri and Bhubaneswar also stop at Kapileswar, but most pilgrims come from nearby villages. Certain Mallia families have the hereditary right to serve the residents of particular villages apportioned to them. Often they visit these villages to sell sacred flowers, water and food, and to remind their patrons to visit the temple. Since Kapileswar does not attract many pilgrims, some Mallia and Brahman cooks supplement their incomes by working at the Lingaraj Temple. The Brahman cooks have the hereditary right to cook sacred food there and sell it to pilgrims. The Mallia have no hereditary rights at Lingaraj, but Lingaraj priests hire them to take pilgrims on tours and find them food and lodging. Some Mallia travel throughout India recruiting pilgrims for their Lingaraj employers. Other Mallia being patients to a Mallia shamanistic curer who per- forms his treatments inside the Kapileswar temple compound. The temple is said to be a renowned faith curing centre, especially for leprosy. The present curer is the sixth in a line of Mallia curers over the past century who have helped to preserve orthodox values and activities associated with the temple. They employed their fellow Mallia as recruiters, constructed new shrines and repaired old ones, and opposed medical and occupational inno- vations in their caste. The Kapileswar temple thus is a central institution which integrates the world view, ritual behaviour, and economic activities of the Mallia as well as others in the village, and encourages the retention of orthodox ways. The New Capital The new state capital at Bhubaneswar was constructed two-and-a half miles from the old pilgrim centre. As forests were cleared and buildings erected, government officers were transferred from Cuttack, the pre-Indepen- dence capital and the cultural and commercial centre of Orissa, to the new capital eighteen miles to the south. Significantly, the new capital is per- ched atop a hill, with the old town below. The town grew rapidly, from a population of 16,512 in 1951 to 38,211 in 1961. The percentage increase of 131.4 was the highest of any Orissa town. In 1971 the preliminary estimate of the Census was that the population had reached nearly 105,000.« In part this increase resulted from extending the boundaries of the town to include an additional fourteen villages. However, the growth of the town over the past twenty years has not altered its essential character. It remains a planned community 0f strangers</page><page sequence="5">Occupational Changes among Hindu Temple Servants 5 which is nobody's ancestral home, an administrative town of elected official and government workers. There is little or do industry. While markets and shopping centres have sprung up to cater to the needs of government workers, the commercial importance of the town lags far behind Cuttack. Similarly, despite the construction of three colleges and two universities, Bhubaneswar does not begin to rival Cuttack as a cultural centre. Yet the expanding town profoundly altered the physical appearance of nearby villages included administratively in the municipal boundaries. Siripur, a community formerly of Hinduized tribal Saoras, was engulfed by the city, and there is scarcely a trace of it left today. Land prices soared as land became scarce, and the open spaces between the capital and the Old Town rapidly filled with new housing. Kapileswar, on the far edge of the Old Town, received numerous benefits including electricity, public water spigots, drains, improved roads and public health assistance. The Capital had a housing shortage through the early 1960's, and so strangers working in the Capital moved to surrounding villages and rented quarters. In Kapileswar, as in other communities, many strangers moved into or near single caste neighbourhoods, such as Bauri (Harijan Field Labourers) and Potter, which had never before housed strangers of another caste. Temple Service and Government Service What effect has the encroachment of the town had on the performance of the traditional religious occupations of the Mallia ? By 1962, as many as 101, or forty-five per cent of the 233 adult working males had abandoned temple work, and only 54, twenty-four per cent, depended mainly on temple work for their living. In 1971, the Mallia had increased their numbers fifteen per cent, and their male work force seven per cent, yet approxi- mately the same number and percentage, 56, or twenty-two per cent of the working force of 252 Mallia depend mainly on the temple. One hundred thirty-one, or fifty-two per cent, have abandoned their temple services completely, while the remaining thirty-six per cent supplement their income with occasional temple work. It appears that the temple, with its limited lands and scarce pilgrim traffic, can support only a limited number of families. By 1962, the population of the Mallia had far exceeded this limit. The importance of the Capital is that it provides employment for those who no longer can support themselves by temple work. The slight increase in the percentage of the Mallia abandoning temple work does not show how greatly Mallia occupations have changed. The change is best seen comparing the Mallia working mainly at the temple with those working as government servants. While the number of those mainly dependent on the temple remained almost unchanged from 1962 t Q 1971, increasing number of commuting</page><page sequence="6">6 Indian Anthropologist Mâllià have tàkôn government jobs in the capital city. This trend began in the early 1950's. From 1953 to 1962 the number of Mallia government servants increased from 3 to 34. This constituted fourteen per cent of the 1962 Mallia male work force. In 1962, seventy-four per cent of these jobs were Class IV or menial positions. By 1971 the number of Mallia working for the government had risen to 63, or twenty-five per cent of the Mallia male work force. More significantly, only 31, or forty-nine per cent, are in class IV positions. The increase in the number and percentage (32, or fifty-one per cent) of Mallia Class III clerks and one Class II gazetted officer testifies to the increasing educational level of Mallia males. In 1962, 32 Mallia males had attended high "school or above, while only 7 had attended and none had completed college. By 1971, 367, or eighty-three per cent of the Mallia males of school age or older were literate. Ninety-six individuals, or twenty-two per cent, had attended high school, and 15 attended college, earning six B.A.'s and one M.A. The average age of the thirty-one Class III clerks and Class II gazetted officer is 29*8 years, and their average number of years in school is 11 *4. Sixteen, or fifty per cent, are under thirty years of age, and all of them are under fifty. In contrast, the average age of the Mallia earning their main income from pilgrims at the temple is 54*0 years, and their average education is only 1*7 years. Twenty-nine, or about fifty-two per cent, are illiterate, only four have attended up to class seven, and none has gone beyond the seventh grade. Government servants and temple servants differ in another important respect : attendance at the temple. There are three types of attendance. The first, service to pilgrims, is used primarily as a source of income. The second, obligatory worship of the deity, is performed in return for the privilege of holding tax-free paddy lands and house plots. Mallia families rotate these daily services, and if they do not wish to perform them, they employ a proxy to do them. The third service, privileged voluntary worship, is performed for a person's personal benefits, and has no economic signi- ficance. This is a special form of worship open only to those Mallia who have participated in certain rituals which make them eligible to perform obligatory and pilgrim services. Since working in a government office conflicts with being able to do pilgrim work, it is not surprising that not a single government servant relies on pilgrims as an important source of income. But they do have the time to do occasional pilgrim work. However, 45, or seventy-three per cent never do any, and only 18, or twenty-seven per cent do occasional work. Similarly, no government servant performs his obligatory services all or even most of the time he is called. Fifty-nine, or ninety-four per cent never do their obligatory services, while no clerks, and only four menial Class IV government workers do occasional obligatory temple work,</page><page sequence="7">Occupational Changes among Hindu Temple Servants 7 However, government work does not interfere with voluntary privi- leged worship, yet even here, only two out of 63, or three per cent of the government workers, perform this worship most of the time. Thirty-five, or fifty-eight per cent, perform it sometimes, and 26, or forty-two per cent never perform their privileged worship. Eighteen of the 26 who never worship are in the educated clerk or gazetted officer category. The decline of obligatory and voluntary services indicates a deteriora- tion of the temple as a central institution in Kapileswar. Elsewhere I have presented additional evidence of this trend, as shown in the abandon- ment and simplification of rituals, new intercaste power struggles for control of the temple, and increased government control of the temple.7 Such changes do not necessarily mean, however, that the Mallia of Kapileswar are secularizing or abandoning religion. Rather, they appear to be turning to other forms of religious expression. Since 1962 some government servants have become followers of Sri Aurobindo, or have joined in the great upsurge of multicaste ecstatic group pujas in Kapileswar, such as the Trinath mela. Others who never visit the Kapileswar Temple, worship individually at numerous small sharines in and near the village. Another point to keep in mind is that the heyday of government service in Bhubaneswar appears to have ended. These jobs are now scarce and very difficult to secure. Between 1960 and 1965, 33 out of the 63 Mallia government workers got their jobs. But between 1966 and 1971 the number obtaining jobs dropped to 14. Although fewer Mallia have been able to get government jobs in the past five years, they probably are more successful than many other people and castes farther away from the Capital. The Mallia can easily attend interviews in the town for new government positions. Also, they have many friends and relatives in government service who help them get the positions. Migrations The deteriorating situation in Calcutta and the development of the New Capital have virtually stopped Mallia migrations. Before the cons- truction of the Capital, impoverished, uneducated Mallia sought work out- side of Orissa. Most of them went to Calcutta, where they remained for periods ranging from a few months to over twenty years. Between 1920 and 1950, forty-four Mallia emigrated. In the 1950's emigrations continued with twenty-five Mallia leaving Kapileswar. But in the decade of the 1960's, with many new economic opportunities readily available in the nearby rapidly expanding Capital and surrounding areas, only six Mallia left the village. An additional striking confirmation of the slow down in Calcutta emigrations is the extraordinary number who returned home, 57 out of 60, or ninety-five per cent.</page><page sequence="8">8 Indian Anthropologist New Businesses The turn towards new opportunities at home is seen most strikingly in the phenomenal rise of new Mallia businesses within the village. Prior to 1949 Kapileswar had eight businesses. In the following twenty-one year period (1949-70) forty additional businesses were founded in Kapil- eswar. Seventy-five percent of these forty-eight businesses were founded after 1960, and seventy per cent of the businesses existing in 1970 were owned by the Mallia, although they comprise less than forty per cent of the village population. Thirty-three per cent (10 out of 30) of these Mallia businesses have failed, usually for want of capital for extending loans. The preponderance of Mallia shops in the village rather than in the Bhubaneswar Capital or Old Town is not accidental. It costs less to establish a shop in the village - often on one's own property. Further- more, at least until recently the competition was not as keen as in the Capital. The profits in Kapileswar are not as great as in the Capital, but the villagers drawing income from the Capital now have money to spend. This is amply demonstrated by the rapid proliferation of food shops and tea stalls in Kapileswar. In 1950 there were no tea stalls and only five grocery shops. Since 1960 ten food shops and fourteen tea stalls have been built, showing a growth rate far exceeding the population growth rate of the village. Perhaps most importantly, a shop in Kapileswar enables the owner to have the best of both worlds. He benefits from the Capital without having to leave his relatives, his friends and sometimes even his own house. Outside Kapileswar, there is noticeable drop in the number of Mallia permanent shops and businesses. Only fifteen Mallia shops have been established in the Old Town and Capital. Eleven of them were found- ed since 1960. Of these three businesses failed, all from the Old Town. Similarly, few Mallia sell in the food markets of the Old Town and Capital, and in fact the number has declined in the past decade. Prior to 1960 there were only four Mallia market sellers. In a rush of enthusiasm in the early 1960's, thirteen additional Mallia became market sellers, but by 1969 five of these thirteen went bankrupt. This was such a sobering business lesson that no new Mallia sellers have ventured into the market since the mid 1 960's. Thus the Mallia business failure rates are twenty per cent for shops outside the village (3 out of 15), twenty-nine percent for market sellers (5 out of 17), and thirty-three per cent (10 out of 30) for business within the village. How does this performance compare with those of other castes? Unlike the Mallia, the traditional business castes of Kapileswar - Oilman, Confectioner and Betel Seller - have fared remarkably well in busiuç§§ enterprises. The village contains 35 families from these castes,</page><page sequence="9">Occupational Changes among Hindu Temple Servants 9 including 4 families of strangers. Twenty-eight of these families establi- shed 37 businesses, 16 of them before 1950, and 17 of them after 1960. There has been only one "failure" - a family running three businesses had to consolidate two separate rice selling ventures. Other families have changed their business or business locations, usually in the direction of the Capital. Several poor families borrowed money to start their first business and subsequently developed successful businesses earning profits of 500 Rupees or more per month. Most of the Oilmen sell in the profitable Capital central market, while the other castes rim tea and sweet or betel stalls in the Old Town. Only five families have businesses within the village, and two of these are owned by elderly men with no children. They are not physically capable of running businesses outside Kapileswar. Of the seven families which do not run businesses, two are headed by widows with small children, two are families of strangers, and one is headed by a man who is employed by a Capital market seller. Clearly, in comparison with the traditional business castes of Kapiles- war the Mallia are not good businessmen. Even the existing Mallia businesses bring in little more than small profits. Despite their present interest in business, the Mallia simply do not have the knowledge and tradi- tions of a business community. Areas of Little Change It is as important to consider the opportunities which a group misses or neglects as well as those which it selects. The Mallia, like many other castes, reject many job opportunities which other castes are cashing in on. Despite handsome profits for hauling quarry stones to Capital building projects, only three Mallia performed this job in 1962. By 1971 the opportunity for quarrying and hauling stones were on the decline. Most of the quarries in the area were exhausted, and only four Mallia were transporting stones. Similarly, the number of skilled masons among the Mallia dropped from fifteen in 1962 to seven in 1971. The number of unskilled construction workers dropped from ten to seven. Although skilled construction workers are paid a fairly high daily wage by local standards, seven rupees, daily contracts are uncertain, particularly with the present slow-down in Capital construction, the work is hard, and it is considered demeaning by the Mallia. They also have not shown interest in learning new arts or crafts which are in demand in the capital city. In 1962 there were two Mallia craftsmen, while in 1971 there was only three. No Mallia works as a mechanic. Although capital is available in the village, no one has tried to set up small industries. Another missed opportunity for the Mallia is in house rentals. Only one Mallia has tried to develop rental property. In contrast, a Potter of Kapileswar sold two acres of paddy land, built a rental house with the</page><page sequence="10">10 Indian Anthropologist money, and doubled his profit No Mallia has invested in cycle rickshaws. In Bhubaneswar, cycle rickshaw drivers pay owners a rent of two rupees per day. Within a year a rickshaw pays for itself, and thereafter it brings in about 700 rupees a year for the owner. While the Mallia acknowledge that investments such as house and rickshaw rentals are good sources of income, they prefer lower risk but usually less profitable enterprises such as moneylending and investing in paddy lands. Mallia conservatism also extends to agriculture. In 1962 fifty-one per cent of the Mallia families owned land, but only thirty-seven per cent of these families worked their own land.8&amp;9 In 1971, approximately the same percentage owned land (fifty-two per cent), but the percentage working their land dropped to thirty-one. In 1971 only 18 Mallia worked as sharecroppers, and only nine worked as agricultural day labourers.10 While this is an increase from 1962 of seven sharecroppers and eight agricultural day labourers, it is still only a small fraction of the Mallia work force. In part the low percentage of the Mallia working their own land is attributable to their traditional religious occupation. They received tax- free temple paddy lands in order to give them an income which would free them to do temple work. This was considered a ritually higher occupa- tion than cultivation. Consequently, they hired Harijan field labourers and Cultivator caste sharecroppers, and instead spent their time collecting flowers and serving pilgrims. Paradoxically, the availability of modern occupations in the Capital has also contributed to the Mallia lack of interest in cultivation. A job as a government clerk or even as a government peon, carries with it greater prestige, and often more money than that of cultivation. Even the Mallia who cultivate their own lands are indifferent to change. Although their lands are considered among the best in the Bhubaneswar area, almost all of the Mallia refuse to accept high yielding varieties of paddy requiring new techniques of paddy cultivation because they say that these new varieties do not taste good and make them ill. Moreover, unlike cultivators in neighbouring villages, the Mallia show little interest in growing two paddy crops a year, or garden vegetables in the dry season. A small river runs past Kapileswar, but the Mallia do not use it for irrigation. There is abundant water in this river the year round, and cultivators from many villages along the river irrigate their fields with this water. The only fields the Mallia use for growing vegetables are about six acres located next to the Kapileswar tank. The water from the tank drains into the surrounding fields, making them suitable for profitable saru cultivation with minimum effort and expense. In 1965 some college educated Mallia youths rented some dry lands and a water pump, grew garden vegetables and made a one hundred per cent profit on their invest-</page><page sequence="11">Occupational Changes among Hindu Temple Servants 1 1 meat; They called a meeting and tried to convince others to grow vege- tables. The response was less than enthusiastic. Their elders told them to stick to traditional paddy cultivation because, "chopa nahin, bapa nahin" (having no paddy is like having no father). Unlike the Cultivator caste, of the village, the Mallia show little interest in growing sugar-cane or in keeping goats and chickens, although both are in demand and bring in significant profits. The Mallias express their antipathy to keeping goats by saying, "Muslims keep goats, it is not our custom." Conclusion In conclusion, the growing population of the Mallia ' has far exceeded the capacity of the Kapileswer temple to provide even minimum incomes for most of those who are qualified to pursue their hereditary occupation of temple servant. At the same time, the Capital has replaced Calcutta as the economic escape hatch for the village, with the difference that the educated as well as the uneducated are flocking to take advantage of its opportunities. Yet the temple exerts a subtle economic and sentimental hold on the Mallia, even when they turn to other occupations. Many joint families allocate one man, usually an elder or an uneducated youngman, to perform temple duties. The well educated family members strive to become government clerks, and they were relatively successful in landing such jobs until these jobs became scarce. The government ser- vants often provide capital for other relatives to start small businesses, usually food shops and tea stalls. Frequently these shops do not earn enough to maintain a single family, but they can usefully contribute to the support of joint families, where shared costs reduce family expendi- tures. The present directions of Mallia occupational diversification appear to have been influenced first of all by a number of events which were beyond the control of the Mallia. These include the declining attraction of Calcutta for migrants, the exhaustion of the Bhubaneswar quarries, the slow down in Capital house construction, and the decline in government job opportunities. Many of the opportunities of the 1950's and 1960 's thus have become the dead ends of the 1970's. The Mallia also are affected by their inability to adapt to the modern world of the Capital, even when they try to do so. The prime example of this is the incomprehension of the Mallia regarding business procedures, and the subsequent inevitable business failures. Secondly, the Mallia tend to be highly selective in changing their occupations. Other castes in the village of Kapileswar are also selective in their choices, although their choices are different.</page><page sequence="12">12 Indian Anthropologist If there is a principle accounting for Mallia selectivity, it probably is exemplified by the position of Mallia government servants. They work in the Capital but live in their home village. They unhesitatingly abandon their traditional temple occupations, but not village life. Mallia business- men and others also benefit from the new while remaining rooted in the old. This pattern has helped to introduce new consumer expectations, but not new skills. In sum, the Mallia selection of new economic opportunities appears to be governed by their attempt to accommodate the new to their old life style. But as the figures on temple attend- ance show, many young Mallia have, in fact, altered their traditional life style.
