<plain_text><page sequence="1">MATEI CANDEA University of Durham "I fell in love with Carlos the meerkat": Engagement and detachment in human-animal relations ABSTRACT Relationship, connection, and engagement have emerged as key values in recent studies of human-animal relations. In this article, I call for a reexamination of the productive aspects of detachment. I trace ethnographically the management of everyday relations between biologists and the Kalahari meerkats they study, and I follow the animals' transformation as subjects of knowledge and engagement when they become the stars of an internationally popular, televised animal soap opera. I argue that treating detachment and engagement as polar opposites is unhelpful both in this ethnographic case and, more broadly, in anthropological discussions of ethics and knowledge making, [human-animal relations, science, media, ethics, engagement, detachment] ^^^ ince the early 1990s, a research project founded by Professor Tim ^^^| ^^^ Clutton-Brock, of the Department of Zoology at the University of ^^^ Cambridge, has focused on the behavior of the meerkat, a small _^^ft social mongoose living in southern Africa. Meerkats live in groups ^^r ranging from fewer than ten to as many as 50 individuals and are among a small minority of mammal societies in which one female monopolizes reproduction: In each group, a dominant female suppresses the reproduction of the other females, who are usually her daughters, in ways that range from actually killing their newborn pups to increasing their stress levels by evicting them from the group when they are pregnant (Clutton-Brock et al. 2001b; Young et al. 2006). One dominant male breeds with the dominant female, and the other males, at breeding age, abscond to visit other groups and do their best to breed with females in those groups (Young et al. 2007). Meerkats spend the night in underground burrows and most of the day foraging for food, primarily, but not exclusively, small inver- tebrates such as scorpions. Members of the group help feed pups who are not yet old enough to forage for themselves but are old enough to accom- pany the foraging group (Clutton-Brock et al. 2001a). Any pups that are too young to accompany the group are left at the burrow with one of the subor- dinate animals (Clutton-Brock et al. 2000). While the animals are foraging, one of them frequently stands guard on its hind legs, propped up by its tail, giving small chirping calls at regular intervals if all is well (Clutton-Brock et al. 1999). Meerkats' particular way of "socializing" with one another makes them a fantastic test case for biologists asking about the how and why of co- operation, a persistent topic of inquiry for students of animal behavior. For over 16 years, researchers at the Kalahari Meerkat Project (hence- forth, KMP), based at a research station in South Africa's Northern Cape province, has continually monitored the behavior, weights, and life histo- ries of somewhere between 200 and 300 individuals. Although a few Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers are present on-site for periods of three to six months at a time, each pursuing his or her own research, the central database, which includes the detailed life history of the meerkat AMERICAN ETHNOLOGIST, Vol. 37, No. 2, pp. 241-258, ISSN 0094-0496, online ISSN 1548-1425. © 2010 by the American Anthropological Association.

But the scientists are not the only ones watching. Pro- pelled to media fame in the mid-1980s by an award- winning BBC documentary presented by David Attenborough, meerkats have remained a regular presence in popular European and U.S. representations of wild animals, featur- ing, for instance, in Walt Disney's 1994 cartoon The Lion King (Allers and Minkoff 1994) in the person of Timon, the cheeky sidekick of the lion-cub hero. Banking on this popu- larity, in 2005, the Discovery Channel International started airing a program entitled Meerkat Manor, which adopted the emergent genre of the animal "docu-soap." Filmed on the grounds of the KMP, Meerkat Manor followed the adven- tures of the Whiskers, one of the project's research groups, with a particular focus on the trials and tribulations of the group's dominant female, Flower. The use of story lines and characters is an acknowl- edged feature of many animal documentaries (Pierson 2009), but the docu-soap genre pushed this use to a new level. Meerkat Manor retained some of the classic aims of the animal documentary, such as fostering popular inter- est in natural history, particularly among a younger au- dience, and imparting factual information about animals. However, the show also drew explicitly, and quite knowingly, on the style and language of the soap-opera genre, singling out heroes and villains, developing characters through time, making use of cliff-hangers both at the ends of episodes and before advertising breaks, and so on. Most striking, perhaps, in this respect was the show's temporal span: It managed to draw out the story lines of its chosen cast of meerkat char- acters over four years and 52 half-hour episodes. Initially aired in Britain and later in the United States, Meerkat Manor garnered a huge fan base and became the subject of numerous blogs and web pages. A Friends of the Kalahari Meerkat Project society was set up through which fans could receive detailed information about their favorite meerkat individuals and groups straight from the research project, in exchange for a yearly fee ranging from £25 (for information on one group) to £250 (for information on all groups): The proceeds contributed to the support of KMP researchers. Friends and fans of the show sometimes wrote directly to the KMP researchers with feedback and ques- tions. Much of this correspondence was cordial and enthu- siastic, but some of it conveyed problematic reactions. In particular, some fans, distraught at the death of particular meerkat characters, posted angry comments on the web, and some sent e-mails to the researchers, criticizing them for not intervening to save the animals in question. Following one particularly death-laden episode in se- ries 3, one blogger wrote, Meerkat Manor is one of my favorite shows. But it seems to be getting to sad for me to take lately. The Sept 8th show really did me in, I couldn't sleep the whole night just thinking about those poor little pups,Len &amp; Squiggy. And what an awful horrific /painful end be- fell upon poor innocent sweet little "Len" and then 5 days latter his poor little brother "Squiggy" was left all alone,frightened,starving, unprotected, and aban- doned,another tragic end. . I realise scientists are there to observe and not interfer with nature, but for Gods sake, you have allready given all these animals names and have shown us,they each have their own person- ality. I think when times are so tough, and there is no food, the babies are in danger, when some are sooo sick (like poor Carlos) why can't the scientists show some humnan compashion, and help out these poor little an- imals? After all isn't that what seperates the humans from the animals is we have compashion . . . Seems like you doctors of science need to take a lesson from poor Mitch, Daisy, Flower and the others [W. Wardell, September 9, 2007, 3:30 p.m.] In response to the fans' concerns, a page about meerkat welfare was added to the KMP website, on which re- searchers explained that, "while we do not interfere to pre- vent natural mortality, we do our best to ensure that our re- search on the meerkats never affects them adversely." More generally, KMP volunteers I spoke to often criticized the ex- cessive attachment of the viewers who wrote in or of the fans who visited the project's field site through the friends of the KMP society. Some of them blamed the program for giving what they felt was a distorted and overly romanti- cized image of the animals. The volunteers' sense of the viewers' excessive attachment will not have been much al- layed by the striking public memorialization that developed around the death of Meerkat Manor characters. In an on- line version of what lack Santino (2006) and others have termed "spontaneous shrines," YouTube became loaded with homemade memorial video offerings to the fallen stars of Meerkat Manor, which recounted the deaths and virtues of the meerkat heroes against images taken from the show and backed by music ranging from a cappella renderings of "Amazing Grace" to heart-rending pop ballads. By comparing and contrasting the entanglement of meerkats with researchers and filmmakers, respectively, in this article I ask about the interplay of detachment and en- gagement at the heart of interspecies relationalities. Engaging with detachment, detaching from engagement In the past decade, there has been a marked post-symbolic turn in anthropological studies of animals. By 1999, it was still arguably the case that, with a few exceptions, animals featured in anthropological accounts primarily because 242</page><page sequence="3">Engagement and detachment in human-animal relations ■ American Ethnologist they were "good to think" - featured, in other words, mainly as a symbolic resource used by humans in their social re- lations with other humans (Mullin 1999). Since then, how- ever, another approach has taken center stage, which, to quote John Knight, rejects such "symbolic reductionism" and asks anthropologists to treat "animals as parts of hu- man society rather than just symbols of it" (2005:1). The related literature is part of a broader interdisciplinary ex- plosion of interest in the topic of human-animal relations, in sociology, cultural and media studies, and philosophy and science studies (Arluke and Sanders 2009; Calarco 2008; Daston and Mitman 2005; Haraway 2008; Kalofand Fitzger- ald 2007; Milton 2002). The argument against represen- tation is also associated with what has been dubbed the "ontological turn" (Henare et al. 2006): a critique of Euro- American epistemology and, in particular, of the founda- tional distinctions between nature and culture, humans and nonhumans, associated with a call to take seriously a plu- rality of worlds and not just of worldviews (Descola 2005; Viveiros De Castro 1998, 2003). In many ways, this article is situated squarely within the concerns of this literature: It traces a complex international assemblage in which meerkats are not simply a symbolic resource for different human players but, rather, play the role of active participants in a number of different human- animal-technical social relations. The specific characteris- tics of meerkats, but also their actions and their capacity to behave in surprising or predictable ways, are as much a part of my story as the intentions and understandings of the human protagonists or, indeed, the robustness and ef- fects of the various nonliving things that complete the pic- ture (computer databases, cameras, radio collars, etc.). The central theoretical question raised by the recent fo- cus on social relations between species is, in effect, what counts as a social relation and who can participate? If one cleaves to a strict (and, for the purpose of argument, "Durkheimian") definition of social relations as relations between subjects, eventually mediated by objects (actual or symbolic), then the claim for inclusion of animals is a very strong one that takes a stand on the ongoing scien- tific debates concerning animal cognition and subjectivity: To treat animals as part of human society is to treat them as subjects and not as mere objects (actual or symbolic). By contrast, if one follows the recent expansive redefini- tions of the social as the association of different entities (Latour 2005), one can remain as agnostic about the inten- tional, cognitive, or affective properties of animals as one is concerning humans or objects and simply trace the effects these various human and nonhuman "actants" (people, ani- mals, and things) have on one another. To speak of "socializ- ing" in this latter case involves rather less extensive claims. If the former approach invites treating animals like humans, the latter invites a description that puts animals, people, and things on the same level by suspending the (anyway problematic) question of intentionality. The latter approach aims for a kind of studied and heuristic impartiality. By con- trast, the moral content of the former approach is clear. In both approaches, however, connections, relation- ships and engagement are the key matters of concern. I ar- gue that much of the literature on human-animal relations is premised on an implicit normative distinction between engagement and detachment, which itself deserves to be examined ethnographically. This examination involves lo- cating this literature (for all its theoretical novelty) within the broader set of "Euro-American" discourses about an- imals, a multiplicity of traditions that it critiques but also feeds on. Within this more general matrix, the contrast be- tween engagement and detachment often plays the role of a moral dichotomy. In some cases, detachment is viewed pos- itively as the hallmark of a truly scientific approach to ani- mals, for instance, when one suppresses the temptation for anthropomorphic projection (Kennedy 1992). More com- monly, however, the shoe is on the other foot: In the world of intensive farming and animal-rights movements, the dis- tancing of animals from humans has increasingly been get- ting a bad name; detachment (and in some discourses, "science" itself) comes to be associated with coldness and lack of caring, a Cartesian pathology for which engagement (be it political, emotional, or just intersubjective) is pre- sented as the cure. This dichotomy plays out in the debates I briefly outline above, with accusations of romanticism and cold-heartedness flying about between protagonists who increasingly make each other look like stereotypes. This normative dichotomization of detachment and engagement has fed into recent anthropological work on human-animal relations. For instance, in a critique of the concept of "anthropomorphism," to which I return below, Kay Milton argues that a distancing of nonhuman from human animals . . . serves powerful interests, at least in western cultures. It helps to sustain the myth that nonhuman animals are not "real" persons but only metaphoric ones. As a con- sequence, we can use them in many ways without be- ing impeded by moral sensibilities; we can experiment on them, eat them and use them for our entertainment, and exploit them in countless other ways that indus- trial economies, sanctioned by Cartesian science, have devised. [2005:266] The camps can be drawn in more unexpected ways, but the normative distinction between engagement and detachment remains, as when French sociologist Jocelyne Porcher critiques both animal liberationists and advocates of intensive farming for the same failing: "Animal lib and industrial animal production defenders share the desire to break with animals. Both ignore the wealth and beauty of the farming human-animal relationship" (2007:abstract). 243</page><page sequence="4">American Ethnologist ■ Volume 37 Number 2 May 2010 A normative orientation toward engagement and inter- subjectivity raises analytical problems for those of us who wish to take seriously the two forms of human-animal re- lations I have described above, namely, a scientific study of animals that is self-consciously striving for objectivity and a lighthearted soap opera-like animal documentary. Nei- ther of these projects, on the face of it, seems particularly committed to intersubjective engagement - and yet I en- gage with them nonetheless. In doing so, I am espousing the traditional anthropo- logical commitment to "taking seriously" the people one is writing about. Anthropologists working in non-Euro- American contexts have recently provided sophisticated ac- counts of people's attempts to limit or curtail relations with nonhuman animals (Fausto 2007; Kohn 2005). Eduardo Kohn, for instance, in his study of transspecies relations in an Amazonian village, depicts a careful balance of engage- ment and detachment and notes the linguistic and prag- matic firebreaks that the Runa inhabitants ofthat village es- tablish between themselves and their dogs. He notes that, in a perspectivist (cf. Viveiros De Castro 1998) universe, "entertaining the viewpoints of other beings is dangerous business. In their attempts to do so, the Runa do not, for example, want to become dogs. That is, transspecies in- tersubjectivity entails some degree of becoming other, and this carries risks. To mitigate these dangers, the Runa make strategic use of different communicative strategies" (Kohn 2007:7). In a related argument, Carlos Fausto describes across numerous Amazonian contexts the careful procedures that must be in place to ensure the objectification of prey, thereby minimizing the risk of the wrong relationships be- ing fostered: "Eating and sharing food in order to produce kinship must be kept distinct from eating as a way of iden- tifying with what is eaten. But this requires work: the game animal needs to be produced as food, since it is not 'natu- rally' an object. In other words, an animal subject needs to be reduced to the condition of an inert object" (2007:503). In such accounts, practices of detachment and the cur- tailing of relationships between humans and nonhumans are described as efficacious aspects of a coherent mode of being in the world. By contrast, and with some notable ex- ceptions (e.g., Marvin 2005), work on Euro -American in- terspecies relations has tended either to critique people's attempts at distance and detachment, as above, or to high- light the ways in which Euro -Americans (or at least some of them) are not as detached, objectivist, or dispassionate in their relations to nonhumans as anthropologists claim they are (see Degnen 2009 for a particularly convincing example). By contrast, I take my cue from recent work outside of anthropology that has acknowledged the need to suspend, for a moment, the passionate critique of objectivity and to actually consider cultivated detachment as an ethical ori- entation. Historians of science Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison (2007) have documented the assiduous pursuit of detachment as an ethical goal among late 19th-century sci- entists. They show that "objectivity" is not a unitary cate- gory but, rather, a historically contingent bundle of knowl- edge practices and forms of virtue. Literary scholar Amanda Anderson (2001) similarly urges scholars to treat on their own terms, as ethical projects and not merely as ideological projections, the qualified attempts at detachment evident in the work of 19th-century cosmopolitan authors such as Charles Dickens and George Eliot. Reconfigured as a tech- nology of the self, and not just an ideology or a straw man, detachment becomes accessible to ethnography as a partic- ular modality within Euro-American modes of interspecies relationality. My aim here is not to write an apologetics of detach- ment that would simply reverse the polarity of recent work on human-animal relations. Rather, I follow the lead of an- thropologists of human-animal relations who, like Garry Marvin (2005) writing about English foxhounds and Ben Campbell (2005) on buffalo in Nepal, have explored the complexities and ambivalences of relationships based on love and exploitation, trust and domination, or, as in my case, engagement and detachment. For once it is envisaged not as false consciousness but as a telos for people's ac- tions, and traced through everyday micropractices of the self, detachment emerges as the constant counterpart and complement of engagement, not as its radical alternative. A dichotomy between detachment and engagement is not, I argue, a particularly helpful heuristic for thinking about human-animal relations in these particular ethnographic contexts. Rather, scholars need to make some space within the concept of "relationship," to acknowledge the broad spectrum that lies between complete lack of connection, on the one hand, and actual "intersubjectivity," on the other hand. To this end, I propose the heuristic notion of "inter- patience." In my conclusion, I ask what lessons anthropolo- gists themselves might draw from this analysis, concerning the interplay of engagement and detachment in their own ethics and epistemology. Cultivating polite distance Meerkats are in many ways ideal research subjects: They are small, diurnal animals living in a fairly open and sparse en- vironment, at ground level. While foraging during the day- time, they move at a rate that may occasionally keep an ob- server on his or her toes, but they can usually be followed at a leisurely amble. Yet, if meerkats' relationships with one another are what make them interesting to researchers, it is the animals' ability to sustain relationships of a sort with their human observers that, crucially, makes them accessi- ble for research. The KMP meerkats are habituated to hu- man presence. Whereas meerkats in the wild will not let 244</page><page sequence="5">Engagement and detachment in human-animal relations ■ American Ethnologist Figure 1. The author with Alonzo Mourning, aka meerkat VWM100. (Photo: Sarah Brooks.) people approach them, the KMP meerkats happily forage within inches of human observers and, indeed, in what has become a locally iconic image, will clamber onto humans' shoulders and heads to stand guard (see Figure 1). The practice of habituation problematizes the bound- aries between the wild and the tame. In a crucial sense, ha- bituation means that, for better or for worse, the animals, and their behavior, can no longer unselfconsciously be treated as mere objects "out there." Philosophers and his- torians of science who have described the rise of habitua- tion in the behavioral field sciences (Despret 2002; Stengers 2000:145ff.) often applaud this mixing up of categories and wish that the scientists would embrace this state of affairs wholeheartedly, by coming to think of their research, rather like social anthropologists do, as a generative practice of mutual modification, not a distanced act of scientific obser- vation. Judging by these accounts, habituation might seem to fall squarely within the broad nexus of practices inves- tigated by anthropologists, archaeologists, and others un- der the heading of "domestication" (see Cassidy and Mullin 2007). And yet the scientists involved in habituation broadly reject this interpretation. Some students of animal behav- ior, particularly primatologists such as Jane Goodall, for in- stance, have explicitly embraced the radical approach ad- umbrated above, according to which habituation is akin to an ethnographic encounter; yet their accounts rarely imply that the animals are "tame," "domesticated," or, indeed, es- sentially transformed by human contact. The emphasis in these accounts is usually on the transformations undergone by the humans rather than the nonhumans involved. The reaction against equating habituation with domes- tication is even stronger among the researchers at the KMP, who, unlike the aforementioned primatologists, do not aim to transform the meaning of scientific practice: Rather than challenge the canons of the "theoretico-experimental sci- ences" by embracing the "irreducible uncertainty" of the field (Stengers 2000:140ff.), the KMP was set up to repro- duce as far as possible the truth-value of the lab in nec- essarily, but not fatally, compromised conditions. To make sure that the KMP meerkats could be made to speak, in the data, for meerkats as a whole, the pragmatic need to approach the animals had to be balanced by distancing measures to minimize human interference in the animals' behavior. Domestication was therefore not an option - either conceptually or practically. Indeed, newcomers to the world of the KMP are frequently and patiently told that the meerkats are not "tame" in the way pets might be and that their clambering on the researchers is not, for instance, a sign of affection. As I discuss below, in some accounts of ha- bituation, particularly with primates, the researcher is de- scribed as becoming involved in chimpanzee or baboon so- cial relations to get ethnographic insight into them (Smuts 2001). At the KMP, by contrast, habituation was initially ex- plained to me not in terms of building social relations with the animals but, on the contrary, in terms of disappearing, of becoming part of the scenery - the norm also presented in manuals of ethological method, in which habituation is usually described as an alternative to "hides" (Lehner 1996; Martin and Bateson 2007). Whereas the above accounts of primate habituation implicitly highlight the humanlike characteristics of ba- boons and chimps, some KMP researchers, to explain the extent to which meerkats took them for granted, often com- pared themselves to animals, such as the cattle that the meerkats also happily ignore. They noted that the meerkats would only stand guard on people's shoulders or heads if there was no higher object to climb up on: The animals, they insisted, just treated researchers as part of the scenery. Primatologists and sociologists of science have written critically about the disciplinary imperatives that force stu- dents of animal behavior to excise the intersubjective as- pects of their research from published or official accounts (Haraway 1989, 2008:375-376; Smuts 1999, 2001). But my aim here is different. I suggest that the "doublethink" (Alcayna-Stevens 2009; cf. Orwell 2000) that enables KMP researchers to conceptualize habituation as a nonrelation 245</page><page sequence="6">American Ethnologist ■ Volume 37 Number 2 May 2010 is not some sort of mask or false consciousness but, rather, one among many effective practices of repartitioning and detachment.1 Crucially, this story is not just about the re- searchers' interests, about humans mapping a unilateral imposition (symbolic or otherwise) on the meerkats. Rather, maintaining proper distance is a project that meerkats and scientists have in common. It took me a while to see this. Before I had even set foot in the Kalahari, I thought I had these accounts of habitua- tion sussed as mere rhetorical ploys to establish the objec- tivity of the scientist. Like most versions of "straight from the box" critique, this one was rather challenged by my ac- tually being in the field. Walking with habituated meerkats is a strange experience and not one that I would readily and uniformly characterize as "intersubjective." The animals re- ally do ignore you, most of the time, and the sense of being part of the furniture is very potent indeed. The most striking moments of face-to-face interaction, in fact, are precisely those that occur when this status quo is suddenly disturbed: If a meerkat pauses from digging and finds you peering down over her shoulder, she might well jump around into a coiled-up crouch, look you straight in the eye, and give a nasty hiss. The meerkats themselves, and not just the re- searchers, seem to be keen on everyone keeping a polite dis- tance (on "politeness" as a mode of research engagement, both within and across species, see Despret 2002; Haraway 2008). For an anthropologist of human-animal relations, the question habituation raises, in other words, is not "how do humans conceive of habituation?" but "how does habitu- ation fit in with meerkats' own modes of sociality?" Clues may be drawn from other interspecies contexts. Primatolo- gist Barbara Smuts, for instance, pertinently critiqued the classic model of habituation - simply "ignoring" animals and getting them to "ignore" you- by pointing out what a complex relation "ignoring" is in the baboon social world: Ignoring can contextually imply trust or tension but is cer- tainly "rarely a neutral act" (2001:297; see also Vicart 2008). Smuts (2001:296-298) argues that her initial attempts to be neutral and ignore the baboons were counterproductive, because the baboons, in fact, came to pay less attention to her once she had learned to behave and, therefore, respond in baboon-appropriate fashion. As she writes elsewhere, The baboons stubbornly resisted my feeble but sincere attempts to convince them that I was nothing more than a detached observer, a neutral object they could ignore. Right from the start, they knew better, insist- ing that I was, like them, a social subject vulnerable to the demands and rewards of relationship. Since I was in their world, they determined the rules of the game, and I was thus compelled to explore the unknown terrain of human-baboon intersubjectivity. [Smuts 1999:109- 110] But, if Smuts's account convincingly shows that ha- bituation cast as a nonrelation does not quite satisfy, her version of intersubjectivity seems to slightly overshoot the mark when one considers meerkat-human relations. Smuts describes herself entering into social relations on the ba- boons' own terms, which involves learning and reproducing the complexities of baboons' body language - in the main, acting like a baboon. In other words, like many ethnogra- phers, Smuts understands her work as an entry into an ex- isting realm of baboon sociality, which, in turn, involves learning the rules of the game, approximating baboon habi- tus. By contrast, the physiological differences between hu- mans and meerkats mean that however well they might come to understand the rules, the KMP volunteers were un- likely to be able to play the meerkat game. For them, it was not so much a case of entering into the meerkats' social world, therefore, as of finding an acceptable compromise of copresence with creatures whose size and morphology, at least, were widely divergent from theirs. Acting like a (giant) meerkat was not likely to win you points. What was needed was the elaboration of something new, "a sort of shared transspecies habitus" (Kohn 2007:7). This, in turn, made it very hard to ascertain whether one had "got it right" - or, indeed, what "getting it right" might involve. For instance, the KMP volunteers had developed one element of a "transspecies pidgin" (Kohn 2007:13): a "ha- bituation call" made up of three hummed notes, which researchers used when first approaching a habituated meerkat group and also to "calm down" a meerkat they had inadvertently startled. This particular call had been intro- duced some years previously by a project manager to re- place an older habituation call, a sort of ululation that this particular manager found he could not produce. Interest- ingly, volunteers' own accounts of the habituation call dif- fered: Some described the call as a mere soothing noise that had a calming effect on the meerkats; others, or the same volunteers at different times, described it as a mes- sage conveying peaceful intentions. The alternation be- tween these two options is telling of a constitutive uncer- tainty among the volunteers themselves about the nature of the interspecies relationship involved: Was it an inter- subjective interaction (with the vocalization constituting a message of peace) or was it a mere production of effects (through a noise that soothes)? Some wondered, did the call even "work" at all? Smuts's account of habituation as learning baboon habitus brings with it certainties: about the essential (if perhaps only partial) permeability of baboon sociality to humans, about the intersubjectivity (however uncharted) involved in interspecies relations, and therefore about ba- boon personhood - which Smuts (1999:117-118) defines as the capacity to participate in personal relationships, to rec- ognize individuals. By contrast, the KMP researchers craft provisional snippets of interspecies habitus that do not 246</page><page sequence="7">Engagement and detachment in human-animal relations ■ American Ethnologist necessarily carry any certainties about the nature of the re- lationship or of the nonhuman participants. After all, the question of whether the KMP researchers' presence consti- tutes a social relation with the animals raises the difficult question of what, for a meerkat, would constitute a social relation.2 Whereas baboon sociality has been the focus of many behavioral studies, a meerkat's-eye view of sociality remains fairly elusive. Even the basic question of the per- ceptual and cognitive mechanisms that enable meerkats to recognize others as part of their social groups is still, at the time of writing, wide open.3 Meerkats' perceptions of their environment, both social and natural, are a topic of ongo- ing research at KMP, and until further notice, the question must remain an open one. Speaking tentatively on the basis of very initial obser- vations, however, I was struck that meerkats seem to spend much of their time "ignoring" one another, just as they ig- nore the researchers. Moments of actual visible interaction, such as grooming, fighting, or feeding one another, are the exception rather than the norm, and most of the meerkats' days are spent just ranging about within a few meters of one another, each one foraging, digging, or standing guard, seemingly independently. All the while, however, a constant pattern of quiet calls produces a sort of social echolocation system, keeping individuals aware of each other's position. Crucially, this loose, relaxed form of environmental copres- ence is not unlike the kind of tolerant relationship these meerkats have with members of other species: some birds, cattle, and, indeed, human researchers. The same could be said of relations between humans at the project. They too spent much of the day either working alone in the field or simply hanging out reading in the com- mon room or watching TV as people flitted in and out. In the field, the researchers' walkie-talkie system was not un- like a scaled-up version of the patter of vocalizations that kept the meerkats aware of each other's presence: Periodi- cally, researchers would call in to announce their position, to report an unusual incident, or to ask if anyone driving by their area would offer them a lift. The overall effect coun- teracted the isolation of fieldwork (or of the empty research base) with a reassuring sense of togetherness, which yet fell short of actual interaction. Being able to alternate be- tween such moments of relaxed copresence and the much more intense, face-to-face sociality of mealtimes, games, and such, was often described by volunteers themselves as the key to maintaining the sanity and happiness of 20 peo- ple living together in a remote farmstead. Whereas the recent anthropology of nonhuman ani- mals has been primarily focused on relations that cut across species lines, comparisons between human and nonhuman socialities can be a very productive way forward - indeed, I would argue they are a sine qua non background for un- derstanding the possibility and limits of cross-species so- cialities. Analyses such as the one above are necessarily tentative, of course, but they also provide an opportunity for ethnographic observation to interface with the differ- ently situated knowledges that the people involved have garnered about the socialities of the animals they live and work with - whether they be behavioral researchers, as in this case, or, say, Siberian herders with their outstandingly complex and refined understandings of reindeer social life (Vitebski 2005, especially pp. 91ff., 175). Abstentions The effectiveness of this regime was brought home to me most forcefully in relation to my own first arrival at the KMP as an ethnographer. Although most volunteers and re- searchers were happy to chat with me at their leisure, gen- erously guided me through the volunteer training process, and taught me how to collect behavioral data, they made very clear to me on my arrival that there were desirable lim- its to anthropological engagement. Because they could not pragmatically escape the confines of the research site (few volunteers had their own cars and, apart from the daily trips to the field, occasions to leave the site were few and far between), volunteers were keen, when I arrived, to ensure that they could, if and when they chose, be "offstage," "out of the study." An added factor complicated my initial entry into the field: The producers of Meerkat Manor had mooted the possibility of a new program, which would include not only the furry critters but also the daily lives of the volun- teers themselves, in the vein of reality-TV shows such as Big Brother. Most of the volunteers were very strongly opposed to this proposal for the abovementioned reasons, and on my first evening at the site I had to consciously and explicitly mark out the difference between my own limited research interests (the scientific process, human-animal relations), and a Big Brother-style panoptic invasion of all aspects of the volunteers' lives. In this particular case, the shadow of Big Brother's extractive, prying eye added definition and some urgency to the often more fuzzy process whereby any ethnographer negotiates, in practice, what is on and off the record. In time, of course, the initial and somewhat artifi- cial drawing up of boundaries loosened, and the volunteers and I reverted to the usual give-and-take of anthropological work - but consciously giving people space and, indeed, ab- staining from being interested in certain things, remained an important part of being an ethnographer at the KMP. In interhuman as in interspecies sociality, appropriate detach- ment was a sine qua non condition of engagement. Detach- ment proved to be a key part of anthropological engage- ment in another sense. My KMP trip was only one element of my ongoing multisited research project in the world of animal behavior. And what allowed some of the tentative relations I forged at the KMP to blossom into fruitful an- thropological and interdisciplinary exchanges was precisely my objectification of my KMP experiences in the form of an 247</page><page sequence="8">American Ethnologist ■ Volume 37 Number 2 May 2010 early version of this article. This detached piece of anthro- pological exegesis became a discussion point for meerkat researchers and volunteers who, in the same process, be- came key interlocutors and friends. Once one sees detachment not just as a rhetorical de- vice but as a self-imposed practice, a new ethnographic field opens up: For these practices come in all shapes and sizes and index very different ethical-analytical modali- ties. Being a polite ethnographer meant refraining from be- ing interested in certain things. Being a good observer of meerkat behavior also involved an abstention from data collection, but it followed a very different set of principles. Researchers and volunteers at the project were very clear about their duty to excise from the data behaviors that could be seen as influenced by human presence. Princi- pally, this involved suspending the collection of behavioral data during the thrice-daily weighing session. The meerkats are enticed onto scales with the help of a small water bottle and crumbs of hard-boiled egg. At one end of the scale, the volunteer has to deal with frenzied "egg- monsters," who push other meerkats off the scales if they are not sneaking into his or her lap to steal the whole bag of egg. At the other end of the scale, one has to learn to contend with shy or utterly uninterested individuals who will just walk off, trailing behind them an increasingly frustrated volunteer, juggling scales, egg and water, record book, and so on. In the meantime, dominant male meerkats get increasingly keen to mark the scale box, the scales, and the volunteer him- or herself with their anal scent glands - much to the volunteers' chagrin (see Figure 2). At such moments, it becomes inescapably clear that the meerkats are as "interested" in the researchers as the re- searchers are "interested" in them. As one volunteer I inter- viewed put it, When you're with the meerkats, you're part of the en- vironment, they don't really notice you, they will just kind of run past you, they will forage as though you're not there. The only time that we do feel like we're, we are kind of . . . interacting with them on a sort of in- dividual basis, is when we get the scales box out to weigh them. But we don't record any of that infor- mation Because, you know, that's seen to be, kind of... It's not natural. One could also analyze as micropractices of de- tachment a number of thought practices that volunteers acquired through the training process, such as learning to disaggregate the flow of the animals' actions into units of behavior that fit into a set of predefined categories as well as policing one's language to exclude attributions of inten- tionality or feelings to the animals (although different vol- unteers did this to a greater or lesser extent). Both of these practices raise fascinating issues that I do not have space to pursue here. Maintaining an appropriately detached relationship with the animals was also a matter of physical discipline. The volunteers were taught to be extremely careful and parsimonious in their physical contacts with the meerkats. During the course of the day, although one could allow a meerkat to investigate one's shoes or climb onto one's back, Figure 2. Weighing. (Photos: Sarah Brooks and Matei Candea.) 248</page><page sequence="9">Engagement and detachment in human-animal relations ■ American Ethnologist no physical contact was supposed to be instigated by the researcher. Even at the height of the confusion around the scales, when some actual handling of the animals was, at times, unavoidable, I was often and quite sternly told that there were only two legitimate ways of effecting contact: ei- ther by pushing individuals gently out of the scale box from behind using the flat of the hand or, if absolutely neces- sary, picking individuals up by the base of the tail to place them on the scale. Petting, stroking, or other such affection- ate contact was also out of bounds - as, of course, was any kind of brusqueness, not to mention violence. Inter-patience This brief sketch of meerkat and volunteer socialities allows me to reframe my original question of habituation. Rather than ask whether humans become a part of meerkat soci- ety or whether they just blend into the landscape, this ac- count suggests a middle ground between intersubjectivity and the absence of relation. Meerkats, and meerkat-human relations in the context of habituation, can perhaps help scholars rethink what counts as "being with" and as "being together" (Vicart 2008) - and the many shades and forms of relationship between the two (cf. Smuts 2001:306-307). Much work on human-animal relations has focused on the question of the gaze - the exchanged look and the mean- ingful interaction - which raises the most obvious philo- sophical and ethical questions about intersubjectivity and "face" in the Levinasian sense. But much of the time peo- ple spend with animals, and indeed with other people, is not so much interactive as "inter-passive" or, better still, "inter-patient." I propose the term inter-patience to point to a seem- ing paradox: that of relationships based on detachment or disengagement. Here I draw on an internal tension in the concept of "patience," which, not unlike the notion of "imitation,"4 condenses a passive-active paradox. Pa- tience is the active cultivation of inaction. Whereas pas- sivity is mere negativity, a lack of action, patience is the action of allowing things to happen to one; the patient is not, like the object, definitionally incapable of action but, rather one who gives him- or herself over to a rela- tionship in which action flows one way. Like imitation- albeit for a different reason - patience is therefore a limit- ing case of action: Patience is action turned against itself, intention intent on self-suspension. Inter-patience, then, is the mutual suspension of action, a cease-fire of sorts. It extends a pact of inaction: The KMP volunteers refrain from certain active interventions, and the meerkats re- frain from doing the first thing meerkats usually do when faced with human beings, namely, run away. Heuristi- cally, inter-patience allows the extension of the meaning of relationship beyond intersubjectivity, and even beyond interaction. Measured against interspecies intersubjectivity, inter- patience seems a rather stunted, odd form of relationality. This is because recent accounts of interspecies intersubjec- tivity are usually framed against a background of Cartesian, objectivist dualism, Euro -American naturalist ontology, or a symbolic reductionism that does not recognize animals' agentive potential. The problem, in this framework, is how to establish or recognize authentic relations that cross or subvert these boundaries and dichotomies. However, a meerkat's-eye view of the problem may well be quite dif- ferent. Just as interspecies engagement emerges as a pos- itive achievement in a cold, Cartesian world of detach- ment and disconnection, inter-patience emerges as a pos- itive achievement in a world in which prédation is, more often than not, the primary "transspecific vector of social- ity" (Fausto 2007:500) .5 In a world of potential threats and predators, ignoring another living being is a contingent and revocable achievement, one in which engagement and de- tachment, action and inaction, are inextricably entwined. Ethical and analytical relations For the volunteers, the cultivation of detachment and "inter-patience" did not negate the sense of building a re- lationship with the animals. I asked the same volunteer I quoted above what he found the most rewarding part of the job: Volunteer: I found just being with the meerkats very rewarding, everyday. [If] you're habituating, so getting them used to your presence, that process is very re- warding You know it can be very, it requires a lot of patience, a lot of time, but to see them getting used to you, and you can then start working with them, that's very rewarding I had a fantastic morning this morning [Yesterday morning] was the first time I'd been able to walk with the group. And the two females, that are slightly wild still, were happy . . . foraging about twenty meters from me. This morning, they were happy at about six meters, so a huge jump, very quickly and it gives you a kind of a buzz . . . Me [with my usual eloquence]: So what's the, how does that work, what do they . . .? V: I don't know. They just seemed to come on re- ally well. I think because the rest of the group are al- ready ... a bit more used to us, that kind of helps. But each individual- that's the other thing is that you get to know. I personally think there's a lot of person- ality . . . stuff going on in meerkats, . . . you can see it, working with them every day. That some meerkats do respond differently. Some meerkats will respond to the habituation process much faster than others, whereas others will take a lot longer, they're much more cau- tious. So learning the different little ways of the differ- ent animals as well. 24B</page><page sequence="10">American Ethnologist ■ Volume 37 Number 2 May 2010 Anthropologists have sometimes contrasted the de- tached, distanced, "Western" scientific knowledge of an- imals to the engaged, relational, personal knowledge of "non-Western" Others (archetypally, hunter- gatherers - e.g., Ingold 2000:13-16). At the KMP, however, it was pre- cisely an ability to draw on both distant and personal modes of knowledge while remembering to keep them separate that led to the production both of good data and of good relations. On the one hand, the excision of interactive moments (such as weighing) from data collection spoke of a classic naturalist frame; on the other hand, the data that would later feed into analyses of meerkat behavioral biology began its life in the fine-grained knowledge of particular animals by particular people. The transition between personal and impersonal knowledge was ensured in part by the daily rota, which assigned individual volunteers to meerkat groups. Like racehorses in the United Kingdom (Cassidy 2002:125, 131), meerkats at the KMP had different "names," whose in- terplay denoted their alternative and contextual objectifi- cation and subjectification (cf. Figure 1): In the data, each animal was assigned a unique code that specified informa- tion such as its sex, litter, and group of origin. For every- day use, however, animals each had names by which they were known to the volunteers. The process of naming was an effective mnemotechnic device, but it also became the marker of a relation: Each litter was named by the volunteer who had spent most time with that group, in what effec- tively became an acknowledgment of and a reward for one's close engagement with the animals. The animals' names might thus reflect the volunteer's tastes in music, books, or film, their favorite historical characters, or in some cases, members of their family. These were often the same names that were then used for "characters" in Meerkat Manor. The rota ensured that meerkat groups were visited evenly: visit a group too seldom, and you risked loosen- ing the ties of habituation as well as underrepresenting that group in the database. Visit it too often, and you risked get- ting its members too used to human presence and perhaps affecting their vigilance levels or impacting their behavior in unforeseen ways. Conversely, the rota also ensured that volunteers were distributed evenly over the different ani- mal groups. Because volunteers had different levels of ex- perience, the data as a whole would be more reliable if they rotated around all the groups. This concern with rotating in- dividuals frequently to eliminate bias or skew was counter- balanced, however, by the thought that greater familiarity with one group would help volunteers become better, more finely tuned observers. There is more going on here, in other words, than that classic straw man, detached scientific epistemology. Rather, researchers at the KMP could be said to take the same pains to ensure a middle ground between detachment and en- gagement in nature knowing that Kohn (2005, 2007) has described for the Runa. The Runa, in Kohn's (2007:12) ac- count, strive to live in a tension between two equally un- desirable extremes: "cosmological autism," in which one loses the ability to be aware of the other selves that inhabit the multinatural cosmos, and "becoming other," which would dissolve Runa distinctive selfhood and position in this cosmos as human beings (see also Kohn 2005:192). The (impossible) figure of a perfectly cognitively detached ob- server working without any personal knowledge of individ- ual meerkats, or any insight into their agentive potential- ities, sharply recalls Kohn's "cosmological autism." At the other extreme, one might object, volunteers are unlikely to turn into meerkats - they do not live in a multinatural perspectivist universe, after all - but there are, nonetheless, dangers in excessively transformative engagement: Volun- teers must guard against losing themselves to the point that they lapse from being scientists, and they must also abstain from transforming meerkats into pets. The contrast between Western and non-Western forms of nature knowing is thus not so much dissolved as redis- tributed. In both cases, the tension between detachment and engagement, breaks and continuities, emerges as a contrast internal to particular epistemological strategies. This contrast, in turn, means that (zooming out, as it were) one can see both breaks and continuities between these epistemological strategies themselves. But the rota, as one of the local project managers explained, also ensured that volunteers retained in some measure their emotional independence from the individual meerkats with whom they worked everyday. It was impor- tant to ensure that volunteers spread their attachment all over the different meerkat groups, to keep researchers from getting possessive or competitive over the groups but per- haps also to make things easier for them if something hap- pened to the animals. Individual volunteers varied widely in their emotional attachment to meerkats, of course, and detachment came more easily to some than to others, but the project manager cast the point more generally in an id- iom of impartiality. Whereas each volunteer might have fa- vorite individuals and groups, it was important to be able to see that other animals out there had equally valid claims on one's attention and concern. Detachment in this sense was not the opposite of in- volvement, as in the usual idiom of "standing back" or retreating to a theoretical or distant perspective. Project participants might use such metaphors, of course. But the actual process mediated through the rota was exactly the opposite: the pursuit of more involvement, new at- tachments interrupting the monopolizing claim of older ones. As a result, the seasoned volunteer's detachment was the very opposite of, say, an outsider's lack of interest in meerkats or the newcomer's first perception of them as just an indistinct population. The volunteer's detachment stemmed from an empirically grounded and hard-earned 250</page><page sequence="11">Engagement and detachment in human-animal relations ■ American Ethnologist relationship to the entire meerkat population and not just meerkat individuals. This was a version of "standing back" that enabled multiplied engagements or, conversely, a mul- tiplication of engagements that allowed one to detach. The same argument could be made of meerkats and their predators and, in a sense, of the natural world at large. Remarking on Meerkat Manor viewers' reactions to meerkats being killed by, say, martial eagles, the project manager rather judiciously asked how viewers would re- act if the show were Martial Eagle Manor, with a focus on the plight of little eagle chicks clamoring for food at the nest. This wider sense of impartiality fed into the difficult question of scientific nonintervention. The explicit policy at KMP was one that distinguished between the effects of re- search and natural causes: Thus, feeding up scrawny pups or scaring away predators was unacceptable, whereas re- moving an uncomfortably tight radio collar, for instance, was both allowed and required. Volunteers often couched this difference in terms of distinguishing between artificial and natural causes. This seemingly simple rule could be- come rather difficult to interpret, however: Should roads, for instance, which had been part of the meerkat's environ- ment long before the KMP even arrived on the scene, be taken as an artificial danger? The meerkats happily foraged on and along roads, much to the volunteers' chagrin. Although the latter took care to inform one another by walkie-talkie when this was the case and often stood by with great anxiety when they saw motorcars approaching while the animals were by the side of the road, few would have agreed that it would be OK, say, to chivvy the meerkats along to get them out of dan- ger. But, then, perhaps by being quite visible by the side of the road, a volunteer might lead the driver to slow down. The complexity of deciding in practice what counted as intervention, luckily, matched the complexity of deciding in theory what counted as natural causes. Ultimately, one's ac- tion in any of these contexts involved complex, situated eth- ical decisions, which reflected individual volunteers' per- sonalities and commitments to the animals as much as their reflexive engagement with the principle of scientific detach- ment. The daily practice of inter-patience also helped to inscribe such critical moments in a longer history of negoti- ated interspecies status quo. Indeed, for the volunteer, prac- ticing inter-patience involved not simply abstaining from intentional action but also intentionally counteracting in- voluntary effects (such as making a soothing sound after a brusque movement or removing a collar that was too tight). In other words, inter-patience, as a negotiated abstention from action, could provide a tacit alternative to the tangled philosophical complexities of relating Nature, Science, the Human, and other such ontological juggernauts. It should emerge fairly clearly from the above that vol- unteers' disapproval of Meerkat Manor viewers' extreme attachment to the characters did not stem straightfor- wardly from some Cartesian rationalism, bent on suppress- ing emotion and relationality. Rather, from the volunteers' perspective, the viewers' attachment to the animals ap- peared not as a function of a relationship that they denied themselves but, on the contrary, as evidence of a lack. As one volunteer noted, I guess they view them in a very different way to how we view them. These people view them as ... maybe they think they're more like pets, and they get to know them, I mean we know them very well, we do get attached to them, we call them different names, ... we work with them every day, we see them when they're pups, ... to the day they die, basically. But we have got to remain slightly detached from it, because we've got lots of these animals to work with, [and] to get completely at- tached to one would just be, you know, . . . would de- tract from the rest of the work, I think. These aren't pets. I mean, it amazes me that some people who've never seen these animals in real life, they've only ever seen them on the TV, are so attached to them, and it worries me, a bit, that something is missing in some people's lives . . . I've heard dreadful things like . . . when [Flower] died, people were saying that they cried more when she died than when their own relatives died. And you know when that obsession becomes that much, it worries me, it really does. Many of the volunteers traced what they saw as a pathological attachment to a lack of actual knowledge about the animals, and for this some blamed the program itself, which they claimed was anthropomorphic and inac- curate. They pointed out that the program substituted indi- viduals for one another in shots: Discrepant markings jarred against their knowledge of the animals involved. They also objected to what they felt was the program's simplistic and moralized representation of the animals. The whole scientific, social, and affective economy of the KMP, as I have described it, was premised on a careful balancing act between engagement and detachment, and the program, many felt, trod roughshod over this delicate balance, mixing up facts and stories, knowledge and emo- tions, animals and people. Fostering engagement It is with these criticisms ringing in my ears that I ap- proached my interview with the producer of Meerkat Manor. And, once again, I was to be rather surprised: The filmmakers did not fit the bill of the detached symbolic re- ductionists any more than the researchers had. Here too, engagement and detachment were intertwined in the pro- duction of relations between humans and meerkats, albeit in a different way and to a different effect. Initially, I felt myself on familiar territory, as the producer highlighted the particular features that made 251</page><page sequence="12">American Ethnologist ■ Volume 37 Number 2 May 2010 meerkats so easy for people to empathize with: "I think the fact that they're bipedal, and they have that endear- ing ... look, you know, . . . it's interesting, a lot of species you couldn't do this with. Meerkats have great faces for televi- sion. The way their ears are and, the way they look, the way they behave, the fact that they're very small animals in a very tough environment." Meerkats' German name, which is Erdmännchen, "little earth people," brings home the way in which the meerkat body's scaled-down resemblance to the human form is al- ready filled with implicit moral and affective correlates. Commenting on the success of the show, the producer sug- gested, "It was just storytelling. They were just great lit- tle stories, that people could relate to, the unwanted preg- nancy, the teenage daughter, the family evictions, the fights, the internal squabbles." Highlighting such connections, Meerkat Manor pro- motional material often comes with taglines such as "The daily drama of a 12-inch family that's a lot like yours," and the script, narrated with relish by British actor Bill Nighy, dwells on these comparisons: "It's six in the morning, and like working mothers all over the world, Flower is the first up" {Meerkat Manor, episode 2, series 1). This focus on unmediated engagement, on making viewers empathize with the meerkats as, in some funda- mental ways, similar to them, was what grated with the researchers, whose day-to-day negotiations of interspecies relationality made them painfully aware of the limitations of such direct comparisons. This is precisely the kind of thing the researchers, drawing on a key scientific term of abuse, denounced as "anthropomorphism." Accordingly - and in retrospect, rather naively - I expected the producer to defend anthropomorphism as a strategy for engaging viewers, as Sarita Siegel (2005), for instance, has done in her account of making the orangutan documentary, The Disen- chanted Forest (2001).6 To my surprise, however, the producer, having outlined the various ways in which the meerkats are good to em- pathize with, proceeded - unprompted - to reject anthro- pomorphism in much the same language the volunteers had used. This topic first came up after I asked her about the practice of substituting one meerkat for another at various points in the show. She agreed that such "pickup shots" were sometimes necessary to tell the story, but, she continued, to qualify that, what we were always very careful about, was being completely scientifically accurate. So we never made up, fabricated, anthropomorphized, you know, we really trod a very careful line with that. [I tried to push her on this, suggesting that anthropomorphism was surely part of the show's appeal, but she remained firm on this point.] It's very easy for your peers to say "oh it's just anthropomorphic rubbish," and I'm very proud of the fact that it was difficult for anybody to say it was anthropomorphic, because actually what was unfolding was . . . real science, real behavior. We never said "they feel this way," or "she thinks that," or ... If you listen to the script, it's always either, the suggestion that they were feeling something, or it was just baldly factual and it was left to you to fill in the blanks. In an important sense, the producer and I were talk- ing at cross-purposes. Anthropomorphism, as Kay Milton (2005) has pointed out, is almost invariably used as a la- bel for a mistaken attribution of human characteristics to animals (so, for instance, no one would suggest it is an- thropomorphic to say ostriches have two legs). Certainly the producer did not wish to be tarred with this brush, any more than Siegel herself, who distinguishes her anthropo- morphic attempts to "hook" the audience from "making ex- plicit claims or dangerous and incorrect implications that the orangutan subjects are 'just like us'" (2005:197). But, beyond the semantics and definitional fencing, there was something more interesting going on here. Milton argues that in many situations that are commonly referred to as "anthropomorphic," no particularly good grounds ex- ist for assuming that the human who is attributing certain characteristics to an animal is doing so with any reference to humanity or animality. Such cases, Milton urges, should more properly be termed "egomorphism": "It implies that I understand my cat, or a humpback whale, or my human friends, on the basis of my perception that they are 'like me' rather than 'humanlike'" (2005:259). Milton's distinction is helpful here. Whereas the pro- ducer admitted to doing her best to foster a sense of fa- miliarity and empathy in the viewers, to give them the feel- ing that they could relate to the animals, she was keen to distinguish this from "anthropomorphism," which she as- sociated with being untruthful or counterfactual. Anthro- pomorphism makes bad science; engagement, or, as one might put it, following Milton, egomorphism, makes good TV. More profoundly, the producer was keen to show that the engagement that Meerkat Manor tried to convey to viewers was not just crudely manufactured but was rather faithfully transported from the animals themselves, which really were very engaging. After all, one might point out that it was the meerkats themselves who were, in a literal sense, "anthropomorphic" (human- shaped) and that their anthro- pomorphism elicited the egomorphism of the viewers. The filmmakers' role was not to manufacture this effect but to step back and allow this to "come across." Doing this successfully, in turn, was premised on the assiduous engagement of the production team itself both with the lives of the meerkats and with the knowledge of the scientists. With a care for detail that recalls that of the vol- unteers, the camera crew would review their footage every day, painstakingly logging every individual they had on film, 252</page><page sequence="13">Engagement and detachment in human-animal relations ■ American Ethnologist and the producers might even draw on the KMP's database for backstory on the individuals. The producer also stressed the importance of direct knowledge in ways that are remi- niscent of anthropological claims: Most of our knowledge and understanding we gained in the field, over a matter of months. It's always been a long-term project, you know as I said, we'd shoot 25 or 26 weeks to make 30 and a half hours, and so it's accumulated knowledge, so you were always finding new things, asking questions, "what's that behavior?" I think, Tim gave us a very good grounding, from the out- set, he explained the matriarchal society, . . . roving - all the basic principles, evictions, infanticide, you know, dominance battles, all those sort of key behaviors, we had mapped out. Like the volunteers, the filmmakers themselves first had to learn to see what was interesting about meerkats: You could walk around all day, and you've got, you know, ... a number of small brown animals, running around at your feet, in brown earth, and you think well how on earth could you make anything out of this? But it was all about getting into their world and under- standing what those relationships were and why they were doing certain things. This engagement, like that of the volunteers, also in- volved detachment: abstaining from projection, allowing things to appear in their own time and form. So, whereas some volunteers suspected that the show's producers sim- ply used the footage as they saw fit to make up stories, the producer stressed that all of the program's storylines origi- nated in actual events that had been recorded by the cam- eramen, who collaborated closely with the producers. The collaboration extended even further, to the animals them- selves, as the producer noted: The great thing about meerkats was their ability to deliver story after story after story. ... People were saying to me... you'll never make an hour out of meerkats, never mind 13 half-hours But come se- ries 4, even I was surprised, you know, here we were, 51 episodes Yes the behaviors were the same, but when they happened to different characters, in different en- vironments, different contexts, it actually feels new and fresh all the time. It was somewhere in between the meerkats and the producers that behavior turned into story and animals into characters. The meerkats delivered the stories, and the film- makers cherry-picked events, condensed storylines, or, on the contrary, delayed resolution until the next episode, but they also enhanced, translated, and brought these stories out through careful use of suggestive dialogue, gripping music, and powerful camera angles. In this sense, Meerkat Manor, although always striving to remain factual and scientifically accurate, was undoubt- edly also a "fiction," in the etymological sense of something made rather than something untrue: a "true fiction," in the way the literary turn has taught us to see ethnographic texts (Clifford 1986). Indeed, the producer resisted the thought of reducing the show to the simple conveying of facts almost as strongly as she resisted the accusation that the show "made things up." Some fans of the series who had become extremely knowledgeable about the lives of the KMP meerkats even- tually started to write in, complaining about what they felt were inaccuracies in the show - in terms very similar to those expressed by the volunteers: This storyline had been condensed or that genealogical tie between two animals had been misattributed. The producer's reaction to these critiques was unambiguous: They seemed to have this belief that there was a real, pure Meerkat Manor unfolding there that we weren't showing, that we were choosing to, sort of pervert it and make it into something else. And my argument's always been, if you went out there with the camera and you just filmed what happens and you put it on the tele- vision, you show me how that makes a good TV pro- gram . . . just really, there isn't a pure Meerkat Manor happening out there. Meerkat Manor was not happening out there, then, but on the TV screen. The show did not purport to be a mere representation of an independent reality but, rather, a transformation that preserved the integrity of the facts but made them directly accessible, a true fiction whose success was attributable to the robust networking of the animals' behavior and inherently engaging characteristics, of the scientists' facts and models, and of the filmmakers' creativity. Conclusion I started this article with the anthropological call to leave behind symbolic reductionism and focus on animals as par- ticipants in human society, as agents entangled in actual social relations with humans. But this raises the question, ethnographically, when does a social relation stop being a social relation? In the two cases I have examined here, peo- ple are treating animals as more than symbolic ciphers; one can trace actual relationships between the various humans and nonhumans involved - but this requires a redefinition of relationship that manages to encompass its putative op- posite: detachment. Scientific knowledge and practice are often depicted as rational, detached, and distant. Yet the KMP researchers, although striving for detachment and objectivity, did this in practice by closely managing their relationships with 2S3</page><page sequence="14">American Ethnologist ■ Volume 37 Number 2 May 2010 animals: Their studiously polite, inter-patient "being with" the meerkats was carefully set apart from the "being to- gether" of interactions with pets, but their work could hardly be reduced to a merely symbolic operation on a real- ity "out there." Animal documentaries too are often dismissed as uni- lateral impositions of human concerns on the natural world or attacked as ideological mechanisms that naturalize pa- triarchal models of gender difference and the "socioeco- nomic stratifications governing twenty-first-century mod- ern capitalism" (Pierson 2009:238). But such critiques of the finished product say very little about the ways in which its human, technical, and animal elements are assem- bled. If one forgets the way in which agency is distributed along such chains, one is left with a stereotypical image of Machiavellian producers creating spurious engagement out of brute beasts for a gullible audience. By contrast, the Meerkat Manor producer's comments highlighted the role of the meerkats themselves, who delivered story after story and were so good at eliciting human engagement; the role of the scientists, who offered facts and helped the camer- amen see; and the creative work of the filmmakers, who patiently assembled these various inputs into a show that was more than the sum of its parts. Like the volunteers, the filmmakers carefully juggled engagement and detachment, now stepping in to arrange and tweak stories, now step- ping back to allow the meerkats and the scientists to work their magic. Once detachment is treated as an aspect of relationship (not its negation), one can finally trace the chains that run all the way from the meerkats to the viewers: The hard-won, inter-patient work of habituation allows the researchers to produce accounts of meerkat behavior that inform the pro- gram, but it also lays the bases for the camera operators to get up close and personal with the furry stars, who, in turn, get a chance to captivate audiences through their own sce- narios. Audiences that, once captivated, may contribute to the funding and continued existence of the research project that made this whole assemblage possible in the first place. Along the way, relationships get multiply mediated, their nature and content change, yet at no point does that mys- terious jump from "real reality" to "mere representation" occur. But this, in turn, casts the viewers' reactions in a new light. The fans' reactions, however extreme, cannot be un- derstood independently of the show's work of elicitation (which, in turn, leads back to the meerkats, the researchers, etc.). The show's attempt to produce egomorphism, to get viewers to relate and empathize, was continued via other media, such as the show's official blog on the Discovery Channel website, where viewers were encouraged to re- spond and to emote: "Who was your favorite new char- acter? What was the most shocking moment, or the most heartbreaking? Comments on all of the blog entries will close a week from today so speak now or forever hold your peace!" This campaign may have gotten the filmmakers more than they bargained for, but such are the dangers of elic- iting relationship. As the meerkats began to drop like flies in series 3, the model of the docusoap as "true fiction" be- gan to show its inherent danger: Although the characters had become as popular as human soap stars, they remained as short-lived as meerkats. In the end, the meerkats still as- serted their control over the storyline, at the risk of send- ing the show, as one blogger put it "on a 'bummer' down- ward spiral," which slightly dented viewer numbers. Many viewers, in their comments, baldly attacked the scientists or the filmmakers for not stepping in to save their meerkat friends, whereas others just bowed to "the law of nature." Some, however, picked up on the inherent tensions of the format and mapped the ethical landscape in a more subtle way. For instance, in her blog "I fell in love with Carlos the meerkat," Nancy wrote of Carlos's death, I was heartbroken! I felt like I had come to know this little meerkat, I was charmed by his mischievous and seductive ways, he was a little cutie, and then became a brave, responsible family man. Many folks can identify with Carlos-he sowed his wild oats, but when he was ready, he settled down.Carlos was the meerkat version of many a young man. Carlos was engaging, and it was sad that he died do scientists doing research have an obligation to help the animals they are researching if the animal gets into trouble? I am asking if - the re- searchers from Oxford [sic] knew that Carlos had an infection, why couldn't they get him treated? I think their answer would be that they are there to observe, not to interfere with the outcomes and workings of the meerkat society they are studying. But doesn't the ob- serving change everything? Then why sell the tapes to a network that is going to edit them, and provide nar- ration that humanizes them and that highlights each distinctive personality of each meerkat featured? Why deal with a network that makes it seem like meerkats think like us and act like us? Why bother and then let one, actually more than one, die? Nancy's comment, although based on a mistaken model of the connection between scientists and the net- work, asks a pertinent question. Does the production of at- tachment not also produce responsibility? And if so, how far along the chains I trace in this article, between the viewers, the producers, the researchers, and the animals, should this responsibility travel? (On this problem of responsibility in a world of distributed agency, see Laidlaw in press.) I should perhaps just leave this as an open ques- tion, but I am tempted to suggest - tentatively - that the researchers were perhaps in a better position to answer it than the filmmakers. A critical sociologist of science might point to the high-handed language of authority available 2S4</page><page sequence="15">Engagement and detachment in human-animal relations ■ American Ethnologist to them: The researchers' annoyance at being tied back into the loop of viewers' criticism and their critiques of the program's "anthropomorphism" all sound like famil- iar complaints by scientists about the increasing porosity of formerly authoritative boundaries between Science and Society (cf. Nowotny et al. 2001). But, by this very token, this language of authority is increasingly failing. No, the re- searchers' real edge when faced with these questions of re- sponsibility, comes from their daily experience as practi- tioners of relational detachment, as people who explicitly built their inter-patient relationships with the animals on, to quote Anderson, "a dialectic between detachment and engagement, between a cultivated distance and a newly in- formed partiality" (2001:18). As a result, the problem of re- lationship and responsibility is built into the fabric of their everyday practice. The filmmakers, by contrast, privilege direct experi- ence and the fostering of engagement - detachment, al- though it is part of the process, should not be visible in the finished product. Crucially, for instance, there is no at- tempt in the show to flag gray areas in scientific under- standings of meerkats. Whereas the volunteers knew and acknowledged that many aspects of meerkats' lives are still very much open questions, the producer explained that ref- erencing this in the show would interpose a film of distance between the viewers and the animals. Science had to fea- ture in the form of stable facts, not of hypotheses, doubts, or inquiries, to present an immediately accessible, seemingly unmediated account of meerkat behavior. In this context of seemingly direct, unmediated engagement and under- standing, justifying detachment might become something of a problem. There is a lesson here for anthropology too, I think. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, given our commitment to ethnog- raphy and the skeletons in our imperial cupboard, anthro- pology has in the main enthusiastically embraced what Anderson, following Paul Ricoeur (1970), calls "a hermeneu- tics of suspicion [which] considers investments in criti- cal distance as self-damning, interpreting them as masked forms of power rather than as emergent practices that might themselves be the subject of an ongoing critique" (2001:8). Anthropologists have so soundly excoriated objectivism, imagined as a blind belief in one's own impartiality (or worse, a politically motivated pretense at impartiality), that they have had comparatively little to say about the situ- ated, self-critical ways in which researchers try (internally) to separate themselves from themselves and (externally) to cultivate distance within relationship. As a result, debates over anthropological ethics too often gravitate toward an epic battle between engagement and detachment as sui generis forms. To question this perspective is emphatically not to sug- gest that anthropologists should blindly map their analytics or their ethics onto those of scientists (or indeed filmmakers or anyone else, for that matter). Rather, my aim in this arti- cle has been to argue that, as Anderson points out in a dif- ferent context, once we separate the concrete, tentative, and situated cultivation of detachment from claims to absolute or pure objectivity, we can see that detachment comes in all shapes and sizes. There is a Habermasian version of detach- ment to which perhaps few anthropologists will find them- selves drawn, but there is also a Butlerian version, which, although it does not in any sense aspire to objectivity or the universal, in practice proceeds through ironic distance, par- odie evasion, a restless critique of all forms of essentialism, a constant separation of the self from the self. As the KMP volunteers know, there is even a way of getting to some kind of detachment just by multiplying engagements, by refusing to be attached to just one. If one is consistent about taking meerkats but also scientists, filmmakers, and viewers seri- ously on their own terms, then being partial to each of these groups in turn means one can only ever be partially par- tial to any of them. Being polite, as Despret (2002:173-174) nicely puts it, means engaging with others in the coproduc- tion of knowledge, rather than merely extracting data from them, but it also means carefully negotiating detachment within relationships too. In other words, although forms of engagement and de- tachment can curtail or truncate one another, they also extend one another and make one another possible. In- ter subjectivity is probably a sine qua non of properly an- thropological knowledge production (some may even see it as the distinctive hallmark of the discipline), but where would intersubjectivity be without inter-patience? We may find a more productive model for the ethics of anthropol- ogy if we approach engagement and detachment, not as a dichotomy but, rather, as a symbiosis: the vital, neces- sary, ever- changing, and often microscopic co- implication of two profoundly different forms. Notes Acknowledgments. My first thanks go to Tim Clutton-Brock and all the volunteers and researchers at the Kalahari Meerkat Project who allowed me to get an insight into the fascinating world of field- based behavioral biology. This piece has benefitted from comments by the audiences of the senior seminar at the Department of So- cial Anthropology, Cambridge University, and the Public Culture in Theory and Practice Seminar at Durham University's anthropology department. For their close reading of and helpful advice on vari- ous iterations of this article I am very grateful to the following peo- ple: Andrew Bateman, David Bell, Christophe Bousquet, Rebecca Cassidy, Stefan Helmreich, Ann Kelly, James Laidlaw, Piers Locke, Erin Love, Jon Mair, Maryon McDonald, Morten Pedersen, Piers Vitebski, Tom Yarrow, and two anonymous reviewers for American Ethnologist. 1. As L. Alcayna- Stevens notes, Orwell describes "doublethink" as (2000:35); "the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind 2SS</page><page sequence="16">American Ethnologist ■ Volume 37 Number 2 May 2010 simultaneously, and accepting both of them ... to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies." My usage has none of the dystopian overtones and none of the diametric opposition of reality and illusion. It is not about the Marxian unveiling of hidden ideology but about the contradictions present throughout discussions at the sanctuary. [2009:19] I later came to appreciate the need for such rhetorical firebreaks (and indeed to reproduce them) when I returned from my stint at the KMP with photos such as those I show in this article. Friends and colleagues who saw the photos, after having listened with se- rious application to my description of KMP research, would often crack a smile and exclaim, in the tone of someone who had seen through a trick in a magician's show, Oh, right! So they're not re- ally wild animals." Habituation was undoubtedly a "contact zone" (Haraway 2008:205ff.), but the validity of field research, its power to convince within a "naturalist" frame of reference, crucially hung on researchers' ability to show they had repartitioned this zone. 2. This question, in turn, points to a key difficulty in the recent turn to more substantive anthropologies of human-animal rela- tions. As Marion Vicart (2008) has observed, a truly "symmetri- cal" anthropology of human-animal relations still eludes most an- thropologists, who, for all their attempts to move "beyond repre- sentation," in practice rarely have much access to the specificity of nonhuman animals' engagement with humans- other than, once again, through what their human interlocutors say about the animals. 3. For instance, I have witnessed meerkats who returned to for- age with the group, after straying momentarily behind a clump of grass, being attacked and chased off. Volunteers confirmed that this was quite a common occurrence, as was the opposite case of a "rover" (a young male from "outside," seeking to mate with one of the group's females) managing to "sneak in" temporarily and for- age with the group. That meerkats, who spend every waking and sleeping moment in close proximity with ten or so closely related animals, could so easily be "fooled" by outsiders or fail to recog- nize one of "their own" raises a host of fascinating questions about the perceptual importance to them of individuality, and therefore about the nature of a social relation under their given conditions. By extension, the question of what human-meerkat relations look like to a meerkat can hardly be considered evident. 4. Whereas Emile Durkheim and others criticized Gabriel Tarde for his use of the commonplace term imitation as a key to social relations, Bruno Karsenti has pointed out that the word perfectly captures the constitutive paradox of social action: Strictly speaking, imitation is cast as an activity - the verb "to imitate" describes the activity of he who imitates - while we simultaneously recognise that the imitating subject is repeat- ing an action of which he is not the author, an action re- sulting from the imprint, or even the influence of another action - An imitative relation involves an extension, a "pre- hension," an appropriation, even: one subject appropriates the gestures, the thoughts of another. It is in other words one single subject who thinks and acts inside another. And the real activity of imitation is that of being imitated. The grammat- ical passive is the true active ... the abovementioned gram- matical difficulty - the mutual exchange and communication between passive and active - is the very heart of imitation. Rather than attempt to resolve this paradox, one should ac- cept it. Therein lies the difficulty but also the heuristic value of the concept of imitation as a figure of social relations. [2010] 5. Fausto gives an account of prédation in an animist universe in which "all persons in the cosmos, in degrees proper to their species and conditions, have a positive potential to occupy the agent po- sition and a negative potential to occupy the patient position in a predatory relation" (2007:513). The distinction between cannibal- ism and cuisine, here, is not based on the species of one's prey but on the fact of consuming its active or its passive part (Fausto 2007:512). Inter-patience, then, is the opposite of Fausto 's canni- balism: not predating a predator, but being patient to a patient. 6. Siegel explains, I had to "hook" audiences by appealing to universal human experiences - Anthropomorphic metaphors, anecdotes and analogies are extremely useful when combining image and narration as a means of portraying complex orangutan "per- sonalities," who might otherwise be seen as unremarkable when viewed by an audience untrained in observing such complex creatures - Because these images of orangutans suffering like human refugees affected me so deeply, I imag- ined that anthropomorphic association would be a useful dramatic tool in conveying their story to a wider audience.
