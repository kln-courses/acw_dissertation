And he says that the SM, against the Pharisees, requires "a renuncia- tion of merely external observance," that Pharisaic "praxis was not capable of producing that 'qualitative surplus' which is alone acceptable to God," and that righteousness "cannot simply be produced by the external observance of regu- lations, as practiced by the scribes and Pharisees" (p. 53). What is wrong here is that he seems to take it to be a fact that Pharisaism was merely external and not capable of producing the higher righteousness. Thus he misses the chance of explaining the nature of the polemic that, like most religious polemics, focuses on motives: attributing to the enemies bad motives, hypocrisy, and the like. This leads, in turn, to missing a major issue. If we doubted the accuracy of the polemic, if we supposed that the Christian group represented here did not break with Pharisaism because all Pharisees were hypocrites, we would have to ask what led to the split. Betz has denied that it was christology or soteriology. As always, accepting the view that Judaism, especially Pharisaism, had become a debased religion means that one does not look hard to see what really was at issue in the debate. The chapter concludes simply by saying that "the commands of Jesus in the SM cannot simply be regarded as legal provisions, subject to outward fulfillment" (p. 53). This is a facile and unpersuasive distinction from Pharisaism. Many of the commandments in the SM, for one thing, require outer fulfillment (anointing one's head, fasting, and the like). And the Pharisees urged themselves to concentrate on inner commitment and intention. Betz seems simply to have bought the polemic of the SM as repre- senting the actual difference between this wing of the church and the Pharisees. My guess is that finding the actual point of departure would mean reintro- ducing a bit of christology. Even granting that the SM is an enclosed docu- ment and that it intended to present a comprehensive epitome of the teaching of Jesus, there is no reason to think that it therefore contains every idea important to its community. Why would an epitome ofJesus' teaching need to include discussion of his atoning death? That christological topic would not fit the genre and would be left out for that reason, rather than because it was not believed in. We have here a stimulating and helpful work, studies on the way to a major commentary. I think that some of the points have not yet been fully thought out, but it is clear that Betz is engaged in an important and fruitful study. E. P. SANDERS, Oxford University. FRETHEIM, TERENCE E. The Suffering of God: An Old Testament Perspective. Edited by WALTER BRUEGGEMAN. Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1984. 203 pp. $10.95 (paper). Classically, the idea of a suffering God was abhorrent, fit only for heretics and writers of devotional hymns and prayers. Now, voices theological, exegetical, and sociological vie for pride of place in subverting classical understandings in favor of a vision in which divine passibility is central. Terence Fretheim joins this chorus in The Suffering of God. Working unapologetically with the Bible's anthropomorphic metaphors and taking his cue from the "metaphoric shift" in God-talk among feminist, black, 89</page><page sequence="2">The Journal of Religion liberation, and process theologians, he offers a patient, careful, and largely cogent reading of a large but select group of biblical texts. Identifying in the Old Testament two metaphors for the God-world relation, the monarchic and the organic, he devotes his study to the organic metaphor in order to overcome the dichotomy between the judgmental, wrathful monarch of the Old Testament and the God known in Jesus. God emerges as open and internally related to the world, freely and compassionately suffering because of, with, and for the world, changing with it to share its history yet unchanging in com- mitment to redeem it and bring it to its fulfillment in God (p. 35). Confessedly influenced by current theologies, Fretheim largely avoids clamping alien models on ancient materials. He simply explores dimensions of the text formerly under a theological veto. Thereby, he elucidates an attractive vision of God without forcing the texts he has chosen to deal with. Two related matters call for critique. First, Fretheim misuses the notion of internal relations. While elsewhere he can say, "The world of the people has been internalized by God" (p. 123), under the heading "God Is Internally Related to the World" (pp. 37-44), he analyzes passages in which God is immanent in space and time, that is, in which the world is internally related to God, something classical theology never doubted. More care with the cate- gories of systematic thought would have prevented confusion on this central issue. Second, Fretheim presents monarchic and organic metaphors of God in such a way as to imply that we must choose between them. Is God internally or externally related to the world, the Unmoved Mover or the Unmoving Moved One? In Science and the Modern World (1925; reprint, New York, 1967), Alfred North Whitehead wrote, "Sensitiveness without impulse spells decadence, and impulse without sensitiveness spells brutality" (p. 200). Sensitiveness and impulse, passive and active power (Locke) surely must enter into our vision of God. The solution to brutality is not decadence. What is desired is not a "metaphoric shift," exchanging one partial view for another, but metaphoric transformation, wherein components of the tradition are not simply abandoned but carried forward through transformation. Some current studies claim to find in the Old Testament the emergence of a theology of nonviolence, of "prophetic pacifism" rooted in transformed imagery of Holy War, wherein the Divine Warrior-Monarch comes to be seen as redeeming through suffering love. Attentive readers of such transformed metaphors may find their own initially aggressive and violent energies engaged and then trans- formed into unflagging initiatives-and suffering- for peace. Deemphasis of the monarchic imagery, however, deprives them of the metaphoric point of engagement toward such transformation. Simply put, monarchic imagery, subject to transformation, is a component in fully organic theological metaphor. J. GERALD JANZEN, Christian Theological Seminary, Indianapolis. BECKER, JOACHIM. Messianic Expectation in the Old Testament. Edinburgh: T &amp; T Clark; Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1980. 96 pp. $7.95 (cloth). Joachim Becker attempts to pursue two quite different objectives. One is to present a critical analysis of Old Testament messianic expectation; the other, in his first and last chapters, is to show Christian readers that while one must differentiate between a critical understanding of the Old Testament text and 90</page></plain_text>
