Jean Wirth offers a bold new synthesis of the history of Romanesque art. Although he leaves in place traditional formalist parameters of the period style, he seeks to update Emile Mile's iconographic decoding by taking into account the formal syntax as well as the theory of images. Evoking Hans Belting's history of the icon as a model, Wirth proposes</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 299 to show how the theology, function, form, and content of the image were transformed in the West in response to the Gregorian Reform in the last decades of the eleventh century. In part 1 Wirth traces the concept of the image in Romanesque art to the transformation of image theory between the reign of Charlemagne and the early eleventh century. The Libri Carolini, in contrast to contemporaneous Byzantine image theory, had denied that the artificial image could represent a likeness of the spiritual in the physical body; and since the image shared no identity with its model, it likewise prohibited any honor being offered to the image. Wirth traces the subsequent sanctification of the image to the cult of relics. Anthropomorphic reliquaries in precious metal, which first appeared at the end of the ninth century, came to be venerated independently from the relics they contained during the early eleventh century. At the same time, as the acts of the Synod of Arras testify, images began to be valued as likenesses and means of access to the spiritual. Wirth further argues that artists, far from being simple craftsmen, were generally literate men like Adh6mar of Cha- bannes or Berward of Hildesheim, who were capable of exploiting art's potential to depart from the realm of physical appearances, to incorporate deliberate ambiguity for typological purposes, or to visualize the invisible. In keeping with changes in content, artists also developed a new pictorial syntax at the end of the Carolingian period. Images became more frequently diagrammatic in form and dwelt less on narrative than on hieratic visions of the Godhead. In part 2 Wirth traces the transformation of European art in the eleventh century. He contends in chapter 1 that there was a crisis of figural imagery at the beginning of the eleventh century, evidenced by a tendency toward decorative symmetry, a predilection for stylized animals, and a decline in narrativity in favor of triumphant eschatological themes or iconic images of adoration. Simultaneously, he sees a shift in favor of greater formal abstraction, including the imposition of a geometrical framework on individual figures as well as entire compositions. Symptomatic is the adoption of "split representation." Com- mon in early historiated capitals (e.g., St. B6nigne, Dijon, pre-1018), this process entails the projection of two different views of a single human or animal figure on a single plane or two intersecting planes. Wirth suggests in chapter 2 that the formal changes in religious art were caused by an increasing asceticism within monasticism and a parallel attack on the secular and the pagan. He proposes that the cult of Mary was promoted as a counter- balance to the still-popular pagan lunar and astral deities. Thus the particular fertility rites associated with the eclipse of the moon found a Christian response in the Mariological interpretation of the woman and child standing over the moon in Rev. 12. At the same time, Mary was cast as a new Eve who tramples upon the serpent to fulfill the prophecy of Gen. 3.15. In early-eleventh-century exegesis and in key monuments such as the bronze doors of Hildesheim, Mary's victory over the serpent of Eden is interpreted as a victory of virginity over concupiscence. Jumping to the late eleventh century, Wirth discusses the proliferation of sexually charged pagan images. He associates the double-tailed fish siren, which either reveals or implies the vagina by its pose, with Sheelanagig figures and assumes that in both instances they have a dual function suggesting both fecundity and protection. In the context of the Gregorian Reform, these figures acquired new meaning as monstrous images of feminine sexuality. In dealing with the abundance of male nudes and tritons in monastic churches of Auvergne (e.g., Mozat), Wirth provocatively proposes that the carvers were catering to the homo- sexual sentiments of the monks. Citing contemporaneous writers such as St. Anselm, who expressed admiration for the beauty of boys, he contends that such images were made possible by a tolerant attitude toward pagan antiquity. Once the impact of the Gregorian Reform was felt, however, he suggests that figures of male nudes and tritons were trans- formed: no longer rendered as objects for appreciation, they were caricatured and moral- ized to become objects of censure.</page><page sequence="3">300 Reviews Wirth also argues that the formal language of the image was transformed at this time (chap. 3). Dismissing Meyer Schapiro's critique, he reaffirms Henri Focillon's "law of the frame" and Jurgis Baltrusaitis's notion of an "ornamental style." Wirth insists that figures were bent to the architectural frame and integrated into stylized interlace and acanthus patterns. In historiated capitals, "split representation" facilitated the symmetrical ordering of figural and animal imagery within the framework of the sculpted capital. Finally, the field was no longer considered a mimetic device to represent space but served instead dif- ferent symbolic functions. Part 3 brings us to the primary focus of the book: the Gregorian Reform. In chapter 1 Wirth underlines the key elements of the reform program, designed to reinforce the distinct status of the priesthood and its separation from the laity. He argues that a primary rationale behind the reforms was the literal identification of the Eucharist with the sacrificial body of Christ. This required in turn that the priest, as mediator of Christ's body, should lead a celibate life and should also enjoy freedom from lay interference in the investiture and conduct of his office. Wirth traces the impact of the reform on the visual arts in terms of two major themes: the glorification of the church (chap. 2) and lust and contempt for the world (chap. 3). Although the first theme has often been considered in the past, especially in terms of renovatio and the promotion of papal authority, Wirth focuses on new sacra- mental and allegorical themes. He interprets the apse mosaic of S. Clemente in Rome primarily as a eucharistic image, literally identifying the crucified Christ with the sacrament. Similarly, in narrative programs he notes a sacramental emphasis in the predilection for depicting the Last Supper and the Passion. Among the allegorical images of the church, he highlights the revival of the Traditio Legis as an image of institutional authority (e.g., Berz6- la-Ville) and the personification of Ecclesia as the Bride of Christ, based on a typological interpretation of the Song of Songs. Turning to the reformers' attack on the vices of the flesh in chapter 3, Wirth notes that nudity is generally understood as a negative moral sign, demonstrating the loss of divine resemblance after the Fall. Thus physical beauty is deval- ued, and the nude is represented in degraded forms such as the personification of Lust (e.g., Moissac) as a female nude whose breasts are attacked by serpents. Man's lower, carnal nature is also represented by hybridity, both by ancient monsters such as the siren and centaur and by figures who are encircled by or enmeshed in foliate motifs. Vegetal motifs are transformed by the reformers from positive images of fecundity into negative images of metamorphosis and decay-the opposite of corporeal immutability in the theology of Resurrection. Wirth also interprets the common theme of the devouring mouth as another instance of reversal. The insatiable hell mouth, which consumes the resurrected bodies of the damned, is also associated with the vagina, which gives birth to man's carnal nature and fosters lust. Part 4, "Incarnation and the Image," is devoted to a second phase of Romanesque art, when the influence of the reform was declining. In chapter 1 Wirth considers a work that he believes demonstrates a resistance to the reform agenda: the painted ceiling of St. Martin at Zillis. Drawing on dendrochronology, he attributes this program to the patronage of Bishop Wido (1106-22), who held to a conciliatory position between pope and emperor. Wirth argues that the program, despite its inclusion of both royal and priestly figures in biblical narrative, deliberately avoids any explicit favoring of royal or episcopal authority. Wirth further seeks to demonstrate the waning influence of the Gregorian Reform by trac- ing the increasing importance of Incarnation theology and the more positive evaluation of the carnal image of God in Christ and in humankind. Early in the twelfth century, the Western church arrived at a new understanding of the image in which likeness played a constitutive role. Not only man's soul, but also his physical body was understood to have been created in God's image and likeness. By extension, artificial images came to be seen</page><page sequence="4">Reviews 301 as incorporating an essential likeness of God and thus as the beneficial means of passing from the visible to the invisible. In chapter 2 Wirth argues that the new theological under- standing of the image influenced art after 1120, just as the reform ideology itself was in decline. In contrast to the previous phase, Romanesque art now reflected a more positive valorization of all aspects of the created world. Wirth demonstrates the new faith in visual images as guides to spiritual truth by discussing the visionary texts and-images of Hugh of Saint-Victor's treatise on Noah's ark and Hildegard of Bingen's Liber Scivias. A second trend in this post-Gregorian phase of Romanesque entails a new emphasis on continuities between the Old and New Testaments. In an increasingly popular formulation of the Tree of Jesse, for example, Christ's carnal genealogy is presented in the form of a family tree. Wirth sees the ultimate triumph of Incarnation theology in the "feminization" of iconog- raphy. Christ himself is shown as more vulnerable in Last Judgment scenes by revealing the wounds in his flesh. In the newly invented image of the Coronation and Assumption of the Virgin, exemplified by the apse mosaic of Santa Maria in Trastevere in Rome, Mary replaces the symbol of Ecclesia to suggest a tangible human relationship of the sexes as metaphor for the relationship between Christ and his Church. Mary becomes a particularly poignant image of the community because she stands for Christ's own humanity. As both mother and symbolic bride she tempers the stern nature of the Judge and becomes the most powerful intercessor and representative of the community. From this point onward, Wirth argues, the Marian intercessor becomes an essential complement to Christ himself. Wirth is to be lauded for tracing crucial shifts in Romanesque image theory and practice. One wonders, however, if he overestimates the impact of the Gregorian Reform and yet defines its iconography too narrowly. By insisting on the reformers' devaluation of the natural world, he ignores the important function of the organic imagery of renewal in Gregorian literature and art (e.g., S. Clemente in Rome). In affirming the progressive re- habilitation of Old Testament narrative in the post-Gregorian phase, he curiously disre- gards such a key reform monument as S. Angelo in Formis. In placing so much emphasis on the Gregorian contempt of the flesh, he pays too little attention to the positive role of the physical body in human identity, especially in the context of Resurrection theology. He thus marginalizes the nude bodies rising from their tombs in Last Judgment compositions (e.g., Autun) and omits altogether a discussion of tomb effigies, including the crucial early example of a champion of the reform movement, Rudolf von Schwaben (d. 1080) in Merse- burg. As far as method is concerned, it is a pity that the author fails to address the question of audience. What were the purpose and impact of visualizing the negative imagery of the monstrous in the church? Even though the Gregorian Reform was primarily directed at the regular clergy and their relations with secular society, most of the monuments that Wirth considers are monastic. It would be instructive to examine differences between cathedral and monastic programs and their diverse viewers. In a book of such scope, it is not surprising that there are bibliographic lapses. A few examples may suffice. On anthropomorphic reliquaries (pp. 53-56), Wirth fails to mention Ellert Dahl's 1978 article, which anticipates his theory that the cult of relics paved the way for the veneration of sculptural images. The connection between the nude Luxuria in French Romanesque sculpture and the reform agenda was established by Joel Saugnieux in Cul- tures populaires et savantes en Espagne du moyen dge aux lumieres (Paris, 1982). Finally, on the apse of Santa Maria in Trastevere in Rome and its connection to the Assumption liturgy, Wirth should have taken into account the work of Ernst Kitzinger (Art Bulletin 62/ 1 [1980]) and William Tronzo (Studies in Church Decoration of the Middle Ages and Early Renaissance [Bologna, 1989]). Those reservations aside, Jean Wirth deserves high praise for reintegrating the form and</page><page sequence="5">302 Reviews content of Romanesque images within the history of image theory and practice.
