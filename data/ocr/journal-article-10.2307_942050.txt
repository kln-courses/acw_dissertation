ISBN 0-88946-449-9. $69.95.] With different though somewhat over- lapping emphases, all three of the books under review here address various aspects of aesthetics, historical context, and tech- nical matters related to twelve-tone serial- ism and the post-World War II avant garde. Structure and Sorcery by Roger Savage and From Chords to Simultaneities by Nachum Schoffman focus on aesthetic and analytical questions. Studies in the Schoenbergian Move- ment in Vienna and the United States is a col- lection of personal tributes, historical es- says, and analyses dedicated to Marcel Dick, composer, performer, theorist, teacher, and the youngest member of Ar- nold Schoenberg's inner circle in Vienna. Structure and Sorcery approaches the aes- thetic ground of the post-World War II avant garde by means of a philosophical paradigm. By following the so-called tenets of Enlightenment (thesis, antithesis, syn- thesis), especially as set forth in the writings of Theodor Adorno, Savage develops a model for systematic aesthetic study of the post-Webern serialist school and the inde- terminacy of John Cage. He suggests that the perceived aesthetic of a musical work is actually a synthesis of rational and my- thologizing (irrational) processes, regard- less of how carefully determinate (or in- determinate) the materials of that work may appear to be. "Just as primitve people attribute anthropomorphic characteristics to natural phenomena, and remain un- aware of the fact that the powers they at- tribute to these phenomena are powers they themselves have conferred, every ra- tional, technological, social and cultural de- velopment exists in tension with the prac- tice of magic. The individual in modern society falls prey to such practices in his thinking if he similarly attributes to rational thought an objectivity which it does not have" (pp. 20-21). Savage then applies this aesthetic model to analysis of several highly determinate works by Pierre Boulez (Struc- tures, Le marteau sans maitre), Karlheinz Stockhausen (Gruppenfiir drei Orchester) and Gyorgy Ligeti (Apparitions). As a result, the author concludes that an irrational side to the aesthetic emerges from works whose material structures are tightly controlled and highly determinate (an intentional ra- tionality). Further, he argues that "overt control of musical functions in total serial works appears to approach the level of in- determinacy John Cage intentionally achieves" (p. 7). Later in his study, the author applies the same aesthetic model to several indetermi- nate works by Cage (Sonatas and Interludes, Music of Changes, Music for Piano, 4' 33", and 0' 00"). Savage asserts that the opposite aesthetic reaction takes place in indetermi- nate works, as compared to highly deter- minate works; that is, a rational side to the aesthetic emerges from musical materials that were selected and juxtaposed by means of chance (an intentional irrationality). The author contends that "Cage's indetermi- nate processes are a mirror image of se- rialist innovations" (p. 113). Structure and Sorcery is certainly not for the casual reader. Its content is based on fascinating but complex ideas (as one might expect in a study that draws heavily on the work of Adorno, Milton Babbitt, Boulez, Cage, Ligeti, Stockhausen, and Iannis Xe- nakis). Furthermore, the prose style is er- udite and laced with philosophical jargon that requires a focused, long-term attention span (and for this reader, at least, a col- legiate dictionary and a half-forgotten glos- sary from an undergraduate introduction to philosophy). The format-long typewrit- 497</page><page sequence="2">NOTES, December 1991 ten double-spaced lines-also contributes to a ponderous pace of reading. The book is beautifully bound and printed on acid- free archival paper, but it is most unfor- tunate that the manuscript was neither pro- fessionally typeset nor specially re-edited for publication in book form. It seems to have been printed by the publisher nearly intact in its original dissertation format. Savage's book is the most challenging of the three under review. The use of a di- alectical paradigm to offer explanation of complex and seemingly contradictory aes- thetics in the post-war avant garde is both captivating and heavy-going. Like that principle of Newtonian mechanics that states: "for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction," a moral axiom seems to spring from this study: when peo- ple do not choose to incorporate balance between extremes in their endeavors (ar- tistic or otherwise), the basic nature of things tends to create and sustain a balance of its own. In From Chords to Simultaneities, Schoff- man argues that the "harmonic dimension is the unique contribution of Western cul- ture to the art of music," and that "all West- ern music, including serial music, is subject to judgement of its chordal behavior" (p. xvi). After comparing and contrasting how individual sonorities behave and how they connect to each other in both tonal and atonal idioms, Schoffman postulates that serialism failed aesthetically because of its inability to provide a clear and cohesive system of harmony. He argues that vertical sonorities generated by serial procedures are too indeterminate to provide a coher- ent basis for harmonic progression. This study is divided into four parts. In the first three sections-"Indeterminacy of Progression"; "Indeterminacy of Members of Chords"; "Chords in Serial Music"- Schoffman establishes and illustrates his thesis with many musical examples from both traditional literature and serial works. The fourth and final section, "Destructive Aspects of Indeterminacy," contains broader aesthetic conclusions that Schoff- man extrapolates from the previous ana- lytical sections. It is here that he most strongly denounces the aesthetics of serial music. In a judgment comparable to that of Savage, Schoffman concludes that "serial music does not sound like the result of the rational ordering of the elements of music" (p. 135). Unlike Savage, however, Schoff- man does not regard the aesthetic of atonal music to be a synthesis of rational and my- thologizing forces. Instead, he considers the aesthetic content of serialism to be a total abandonment of spiritual values and an abdication of artistic responsibility in fa- vor of mathematical-scientific precision. In other words, he views the rise of serial mu- sic to be the result of a progressive moral decline. "The composer first repudiated ac- countability for the tonic; then for the next chord; then for the tonality; then for the chords; then for the simultaneities; then for anything that happened in the music; and finally for the very existence of the music itself. Indeterminacy of chords, where it has been given free rein, has a destructive effect, not only on the chordal aspect of music, but on music itself" (p. 139). On one hand, Schoffman's observations, examples from music literature, and strong technical arguments concerning harmonic indeterminacy are most illuminating and convincing. On the other hand, there is a nagging uneasiness that hangs over the one-sided conclusions he reaches. It is es- pecially troubling that the author is unable (or unwilling) to cite even a single serial work that communicates powerfully in hu- man terms. Schoenberg's Moses und Aron, to name but one example, clearly expresses a tragic human dilemma. In this serial com- position the human soul is caught between an unutterable ideal (Moses) and the ver- bose and irrational exigencies of practical existence (Aron). The musical materials employed in Moses und Aron seem alto- gether fitting and expressive of this di- lemma. The ultirpate tragedy of this work (even in its incomplete form) is that there can be no perfect resolution between the two sides, but only compromise. Perhaps Schoffman's denunciation of the cold and calculated aesthetic associated with serialism is best applied to the post- war avant garde (Marcel Dick seems to think so; see Studies in the Schoenbergian Movement, 261), but even here we can see the forces of dialectic balance (described by Savage) coming into play. After two un- thinkable and totally irrational world wars, why should artists not turn to the scien- tifically rational in an attempt to balance 498</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews the aesthetic scales? According to Hans Stuckenschmidt, Paul Pisk defined Schoen- berg's atonal style as one in which "truth took the place of beauty" (Stuckenschmidt, Arnold Schoenberg, trans. Edith Roberts and Humphrey Searle [New York: Grove Press, 1959], 134). Schoffman states, following upon ideas expressed in Thomas Mann's Doktor Fau- stus, that "serialism and Nazism were both components of a crisis of Western culture" (p. 152). This might be partially true if we consider serialism to be a rational but over- driven artistic attempt to balance political irrationality. In another way, however, this remark seems incredibly overstated. Serial music of the post-war avant garde generally was composed by (and for) a relatively elite group of intellectuals, who were anything but Nazis. Furthermore, this music has probably affected the broad outlines of Western musical culture in the twentieth century much less dramatically than certain popular-music idioms. (At least, in the presence of serial music, one still has a choice whether or not to listen or agree aesthetically. This is undoubtedly more of an option than was afforded those who suf- fered under the Nazis.) From Chords to Simultaneities is also attrac- tively bound and printed, but the mechan- ics of the layout are even more flawed than those in Structure and Sorcery. Again the reader must negotiate a typescript, but this time it is not even a letter-quality daisy- wheel print, but the product of a low- resolution dot-matrix printer. Though the publisher might argue that traditional type- setting and line-art production would have pushed the cost of an already expensive scholarly book even higher, there is no rea- son in 1990 why the author's computer typescript should not have been repro- duced on a standard laser printer. The mu- sical examples were also electronically cre- ated and, unfortunately, were reproduced on what appears to be the same printer. It is also disconcerting that the musical ex- amples are not integrated into the text, but appear only at the end of the chapters to which they refer. Schoffman's book is an unabashedly ro- mantic study of the demise of serial music and its aesthetic. It is intended to coun- terbalance many studies of serial music where "implicit acceptance of the premises of serial theory makes the validation of se- rialism a foregone conclusion" (p. xv). The author's observations and controversial statements deserve to be read and openly debated by the community of musical scholars. Studies in the Schoenbergian Movement in Vienna and the United States is a publication containing articles by some of the most prominent colleagues, associates, and former students of Marcel Dick (Professor Emeritus, Cleveland Institute of Music). This collection also includes edited tran- scripts of several of Dick's own lectures. Contributors to this volume are Linda M. Allen, Donald Erb, Robert Finn, Susan Hanson, Wendy Williams Keyes, Michael Nott, John K. Ogasapian, Jody D. Rock- maker, Klaus G. Roy, Hale Smith, Joan Allen Smith, Walter Strauss, John G. Suess, and Anne Trenkamp. Trenkamp explains the concept behind this festschrift as "that of a party to which the friends of the honored one arrive bringing a gift of his or her own choosing. Some have written scholarly essays, some analyses of Dick's compositions; one has collected what Marcel Dick has said while another has collected what has been said about Marcel Dick" (preface). It is hard to imagine, given the fascinating and well- crafted articles included in this collection, a more affectionate and fitting tribute to a master musician, teacher, and friend. The volume is divided into five sections (Essays, Analysis and Music, Essays by Marcel Dick, "Les Homages" [sic], and Appendixes). The first two of the six essays (by Strauss and Smith) are investigations of the cross- pollination that occurred between early- twentieth-century poet-writers (Stefan George, Rainer Maria Rilke, Georg Trakl, and Christian Morgenstern) and the com- posers of the Second Viennese School. These two articles are followed by a lively history of the Wiener Streichquartett, later known as the Kolisch Quartet (by Keyes), and two essays (by Nott and Trenkamp) concerning the life of emigre composers in the United States and the American music scene in the thirties and forties. The essay section is brought to a close with insightful analyses (by Suess) of the seven solo con- certi by Donald Erb, the renowned com- poser and former student of Marcel Dick. The analysis and music section features 499</page><page sequence="4">NOTES, December 1991 two previously unpublished compositions by Marcel Dick, Choral, Passacaglia and Fugue for organ (1976) and Suite for Piano (1959). These two works are accompanied by analytical articles (by Ogasapian and Rockmaker), which not only examine the formal and serial *structures of the two works, but also provide stimulating per- spectives on Dick's technical and philosoph- ical approach to composition. Most signif- icant is the section containing selected pre- performance lectures by Dick, superbly edited into essays by Trenkamp. In these essays, Dick shares with the reader first- hand knowledge about the origins and de- velopment of atonality, sensitive insights into early atonal works by Schoenberg, an analysis of the marriage of words and mu- sic, and thoughts on the significance of the composer Max Reger. All these essays have merit, but of special consequence to this reviewer is the one titled "The Revolution of the Twenties." In this article, Dick cites World War I as a vital factor in the more or less universal "disintegration of the dia- tonic system and of the forms it generated" and the subsequent search for a systematic atonality (p. 227; cf. Jeffrey L. Prater, "The Great War's Effect on Schonberg's Devel- opment of the Twelve-Tone System," Col- lege Music Symposium 26 [1986]: 106-11). The homage section contains warm per- sonal tributes, recollections by students and friends, excerpts from Cleveland Orchestra program notes (to which Dick occasionally contributed), and the clever bilingual "Up- gemixtes Birthday-Sonett (So Nett!)" by Klaus Roy (long-time program annotator for the Cleveland Orchestra and a personal friend of Dick). Among the appendixes is a report on the holdings of the Marcel Dick Collection at Case Western Reserve Uni- versity Libraries, Dick's curriculum vitae, and biographical sketches of the contrib- utors. Studies in the Schoenbergian Movement-it seems worth emphasizing in the present context-is handsomely typeset and bound; furthermore, the two musical works it contains are beautifully engraved and easy to read. Although a scholarly book in every other respect, it is surprising that such an important academic resource has no index. The articles in this collection are all sig- nificant in their own right, but are espe- cially so because Marcel Dick is significant, not only as a musician and educator, but also because he belonged to that close fel- lowship of musical pioneers known as the Second Viennese School. He both contrib- uted to and drew from his association with the members of that school; to his great credit, he was able to transplant his musical career and intellectual expertise success- fully to the New World.

New York: Henry Holt, 1990. [vi, 282 p. ISBN 0-8050- 0974-4. $24.95.] The turmoil of two world wars, revolu- tion in Russia, and the rise of Nazism in Germany displaced many European musi- cians in the second quarter of this century. As this period corresponded with an era of rapid changes and experimentation in mu- sic, the migrations of this generation of musicians should be of great interest to musicologists and students of twentieth- century music. Two recent books docu- ment the lives of emigrant musicians. Diane Peacock Jezic's study of Austrian- born composer Ernst Toch is intended as both an individual biography and a col- lective study of the emigrant musicians who fled Hitler and came to the United States. "By examining Toch's life and times," Jezic writes, "and his musical compositions and writings, in both their European and American settings, an attempt can be made to assess the strength, depth, and character of the impact of the migration on twentieth-century America" (p. 15). Unfor- tunately the book succeeds in neither aim. The two chapters that give a more or less chronological account of Toch's life and 500</page></plain_text>
