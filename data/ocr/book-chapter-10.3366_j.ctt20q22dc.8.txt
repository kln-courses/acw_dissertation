<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Chapter 3 Female Infants and the Engendering  of Humanity On the early modern public stage two types of characters were literally  inhuman: infants and live animals. What they had in common was that  no actors performed their parts. Infants were represented by bundles  of blankets or dolls rather than live children, and in the absence of a  body beneath the bearing cloth, the only markers of the fi ctional infant’s  human status were the actions and words of the players. Without  them, the infants would have remained in a thing-like state, suspended   somewhere between prop and character. Infants on stage had to be personifi ed and imagined as human beings  because the absence of infants, like the absence of women, was one  of the material conditions of Shakespeare’s stage. Infants then as now  could not be relied upon to remain silent as needed, and they could easily  have disrupted a performance, as we know from several Victorian-era  productions that were spoiled by the untimely crying of their smallest  cast members.1 Given the non-realist mode of the early modern theatre,2  audiences would have been less likely than Victorian viewers to regard  the substitution of dolls for ‘real live’ infants as ‘absurdities’, making  the necessity of taking the risk less worthwhile.3 Moreover, live babies  would have required a caretaker, since the Victorian practice of using  one of the actress’s children would not have been an option with an all- male cast.4 They could theoretically have used one of the shareholder’s  children, but they apparently did not. I have found no records of such  payments for the public stage,5 and it is hard to imagine a company  being given the use of a child without having to compensate its guardian.  Instead, evidence suggests that early modern professional acting troupes  followed medieval religious drama in using various forms of ‘counterfeit  children’.6 Stage infants thus crystallised in material form the prevailing early  modern perception of children as at once human and not-quite- human. To borrow Erica Fudge’s formulation, children were frequently  HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   104 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="2"> Female Infants and the Engendering of Humanity     105 described as ‘creatures’ in early modern scientifi c literature and edu- cational manuals because rationality marked the theoretical divide  between the human and the animal.7 Women and children, as Fudge’s  work has shown, occupied a conceptual space in between these two cat- egories and were only partially admitted into the category of the human.  To be fully human required the dual possession of an ingrained capac- ity for reason and an education to cultivate that reason. As such, the  status of the fully human was restricted to adults, and, importantly, to  adult men. Women and children, on the other hand, were seen as ‘more  fragile, and as such somehow closer to – although always different from  – animals’.8 The stage infant’s inanimate nature would have echoed the  ideology that perceived children, and especially female children, as only  problematically human. In life and on stage, infant girls would have  occupied the doubly liminal position of being both young and female in  a system that privileged maturity and maleness. How, then, were female infants on stage personifi ed and imagined  as human beings? Using three of Shakespeare’s late plays and two of  Thomas Middleton’s city comedies that feature female infants, I argue  that one way of encouraging the audience’s sympathetic engagement  with these mute dolls was to imagine them as male or female. By  identifying the fi ctional infant thus, an actor automatically imbued the  child-prop with a certain level of humanity. To create the dramatic  illusion that these inanimate bundles were human characters, early  modern playwrights had their characters describe these neuter objects  as gendered subjects. Shakespeare in particular took advantage of this  performative act in his late romances Pericles, The Winter’s Tale and  Henry VIII as part of a larger project of reimagining monarchical  succession via daughters rather than sons. Using the staging of female  infancy as a dramatic mechanism for replacing the story of boyhood  with the story of girlhood, Shakespeare rewrites the dynastic family  narrative as an affective family romance. Female infants likewise  get marked as human via gender in Middleton’s A Fair Quarrel and  A Chaste Maid in Cheapside, but whereas Shakespeare focused on  princesses, Middleton depicted middle-class girls as the affective locus  of kinship networks. Middleton deprioritises legitimacy in favour of  social recognition and communal support as the factors that determine  the infant’s humanity, but for infants of both classes in both dramatic  genres, to be spoken of as human, they fi rst had to be spoken of as  male or female.

It was not until a decade later,  however, that Shakespeare, Thomas Heywood, Thomas Middleton  and others made the staging of infancy into a theatrical convention,  and then it was female babes-in-arms that served as the focal point for  Shakespeare’s explorations of childhood and gender. While Aaron’s  son raises issues about miscegenation and illegitimacy, Shakespeare’s  female infants query the relationship between the body, gender and  human identity. Among the playwrights who participated in the minor seventeenth- century vogue for using infants as stage props, Shakespeare stands apart  due to his marked interest in girls. Infants were carried on stage in nearly  forty extant plays from the pre-Civil War period, including works clas- sifi able as comedies, tragedies, histories and romances, from Robert  Wilson’s morality play The Cobbler’s Prophecy (published 1594) to  John Fletcher’s comedy The Chances (c. 1617) to Philip Massinger’s  tragedy The Unnatural Combat (c. 1624). (See Appendix at page 135  for complete chart.) Of the thirty-eight plays that I have identifi ed,  twenty-fi ve included boys, ten included girls, and fi ve included children  of indeterminate gender.10 The representation of female infants spikes  slightly in the Jacobean period, predominantly because of Shakespeare. Why female infants, especially royal female infants, should have taken  centre stage is a diffi cult question to answer. Critics have traditionally  looked to Shakespeare’s life and his connections to Jacobean politics for  an explanation. The events in Shakespeare’s family life between the years  1607 and 1613 resonate strikingly with his late plays.11 The 1607 death  of Shakespeare’s two-year-old niece, the daughter of his sister Joan Hart,  offers a tantalising suggestion that dramatising the recovery of Marina  imagines the possibility of undoing his sister’s loss. Perhaps even more  tempting is reading Pericles in light of the knowledge that in February  1608 Shakespeare’s daughter Susanna Hall gave birth to a child named  Elizabeth, making Shakespeare a grandfather for the fi rst time. Reading  Shakespeare’s interest in female infants as sparked by these children is  complicated by the fact that not all the births in the Shakespeare family  in 1608 were girls. His nephew Michael Hart was also born that year.  Although it would be hard to deny that these events had an impact on  HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   106 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="4"> Female Infants and the Engendering of Humanity     107 his work, especially with regard to the material he chose to refashion,  it would be reductive to attribute the complex negotiations of child- hood and gender in these plays entirely to personal experience. I do not  mean to suggest all biographical critics have done so,12 but to read the  plays fi rst and foremost as refl ections of Shakespeare’s life seems to me  ultimately unsatisfying. Without a corresponding interpretation of the  play itself, it is unclear to me what we get out of aligning Marina with  Shakespeare’s granddaughter, or, as has sometimes been suggested,  seeing Mamillius’s death as fi guring the irrecoverable loss of his son  Hamnet fourteen years before he wrote The Winter’s Tale.13 Even if  these experiences fi ltered into the plays, the questions that emerged from  Shakespeare’s own life would have been refracted through the lens of the  world in which he lived. Rather than seeing Shakespeare’s infants as referring to emotional  attachments in his own family, this chapter seeks to position them within  the larger framework of early modern constructions of girlhood. In order  to do so, I will be drawing on existing political readings of the romances  that offer promising, though partial, explanations of Shakespeare’s  interest in royal girls.14 At the beginning of the seventeenth century,  the English court had a royal family at its centre for the fi rst time since  Henry VIII, an historical development that accounts to some extent for  the focus on affective family relations and succession in Shakespeare’s  Jacobean plays.15 Like Joan Hart, Anne of Denmark lost two daughters  around the time Shakespeare would have been writing Pericles, newborn  Sophia in June 1606 and two-year-old Mary in summer 1607. Just  as importantly, 1608 was the year that Princess Elizabeth, the future  Winter Queen, took her place in the court in London. It was surely  no coincidence that Shakespeare’s Henry VIII celebrated the infant  Queen Elizabeth in the same year as Elizabeth’s marriage to Frederick  of Bohemia. Protestant propaganda had come to fi gure the princess as a  second Elizabeth, especially after Prince Henry’s death in 1612 made her  their best hope for a royal champion against Catholicism.16 But even if  we take the Protestant championing of Princess Elizabeth into account,  it still does not explain why Shakespeare would have chosen to focus on  her rather than her brother before his death. David Bergeron has offered  a beautiful reading of the way that the romances confront the prob- lems inherent in the Stuart family’s confl ation of domestic and political  concerns, but the politics of the royal family cannot fully explain why  Shakespeare would turn to girls rather than boys as the royal heirs who  can ‘redeem their kingdoms by providing much-desired stability’.17 As  the aforementioned tragicomedies from the turn of the century dem- onstrate, Shakespeare could easily have found examples of lost princes  HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   107 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="5">  108    The Girlhood of Shakespeare’s Sisters and male heirs in the literary tradition. He chose instead to look to  John Gower’s Confessio Amantis, The Patterne of Painful Adventures,  Robert Greene’s Pandosto, and historical accounts of the life of Henry  VIII, all texts that feature lost princesses. By portraying female infants, Shakespeare takes advantage of an  unusual situation on the early modern stage – the representation of  female characters without male actors. Early modern drama gestured  frequently to the boy actor’s covert male presence behind the woman  he personated, as Peter Stallybrass, Stephen Orgel and Phyllis Rackin  among others have ably explored.18 For Juliet Dusinberre, the absence  of female bodies from the stage actually made it less sexist than it would  otherwise have been, since female impersonation by defi nition de- essentialises the connection between body and gender identity.19 Others,  most notably Stephen Greenblatt, have cast doubt on whether the early  modern stage represents female identity at all.20 Since the publication of Thomas Laqueur’s infl uential Making Sex  in 1990, it has become commonplace to note that both biologically  and socially adult men were imagined to pass through a feminised  state before arriving at adulthood, especially after Stephen Greenblatt  brought Laqueur’s work on the one-sex model to bear on literary  studies.21 Under the Galenic model, male and female sexual organs were  seen as homologous. The difference was believed to be the result of dif- ferences in body heat, such that foetuses that lacked the heat to thrust  out sexual organs would not fully develop and would become female.  As a result, the state of being female appears as a stage on the way to  maleness. Drawing on the one-sex model, Greenblatt’s infl uential essay  ‘Fiction and Friction’ reads Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night as an exten- sion of the Galenic one-sex model. He argues that since Renaissance  notions of the body held all human beings to contain both male and  female elements, the fi gure of the cross-dressed female page brought  male and female elements into erotic friction. The underlying ‘reality’  of the ‘identifi ably male’ body beneath the actors’ clothes secures male  identity while the fi ction of sexual difference keeps desire in the realm of  heterosexuality.22 According to Greenblatt, ‘Nature is an unbalancing act’, and het- erosexual couplings are ‘natural’ in the Renaissance.23 Yet despite  Greenblatt’s insistence on the need for masculinity and femininity to  create erotic friction, he reinforces the presence of a universal male  subjectivity. Rather than seeing Viola’s use of disguise as part of con- structing a female identity, Greenblatt sees Shakespeare’s women as  refl ections of male identity: HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   108 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="6"> Female Infants and the Engendering of Humanity     109 Though Shakespeare characteristically represents his women charac- ters—Rosalind, Portia, Viola—as realizing their identities through cross-  dressing, this whole conception of individuation seems to me bound up with  Renaissance conceptions of male identity . . . If a crucial step in male indi- viduation is separation from the female, this separation is enacted inversely  in the rites of cross-dressing; characters like Rosalind and Viola pass through  the state of being men in order to become women. Shakespearean women are  in this sense the representation of Shakespearean men, the projected mirror  images of masculine self differentiation.24 Echoing Freudian accounts of male sexual development, Greenblatt  writes out women from Shakespeare’s plays except in so far as they  refl ect the development of men. The problem, of course, is that  Shakespeare’s women do not pass through the state of being men; they  pass, as Mark Johnston has pointed out, through the state of being boys  – a crucial distinction.25 Moreover, Greenblatt’s analysis inscribes what  Luce Irigaray calls ‘sexual (in)difference’, whereby women only exist as  mirrors for male identity.26 Janet Adelman has criticised the one-sex model, pointing out that  many of Laqueur’s examples derive from Continental sources, and that  a competing two-sex model existed in English medical discourse. She  also questions whether medical texts can serve as an accurate gauge  for the general public’s understanding of their bodies, and points out  that the one-sex model makes ‘certain traditional feminist concerns  irrelevant’ by evacuating the threat posed by female difference.27  Dympna Callahan, on the other hand, takes the absence of women from  Shakespeare’s stage as the departure point for a feminist interrogation  of the difference between presence and representation.28 Like Callahan,  I focus on an absence to interrogate the political uses to which the rep- resentations of female infants as gendered subjects could be put. Where  Callahan’s work aims to pay attention to the way roles in early modern  drama were written for white men, my aim is to pay attention to the  way the roles of female infants weren’t written for human beings at all. To identify an infant as female is to explore the process through which  biological sex becomes socially legible, staging the speech act that imag- ines infants as gendered human beings. ‘Gender’, in the words of Judith  Butler, ‘fi gures as a precondition for the production and maintenance of  legible humanity.’29 What I fi nd striking about Butler’s recent work on  the category of the human is the extent to which the defi nition of what  constitutes a distinctively human life depends so heavily upon language  and speech. When Butler raises the question of what and who counts  as human, she cannot help but raise the issue of the speaking ‘I’. ‘One  speaks,’ she writes, ‘and one speaks for another, to another.’30 Through  HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   109 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="7">  110    The Girlhood of Shakespeare’s Sisters the technologies of the early modern theatre, Shakespeare tackled the  question of how to account for one who does not speak but has to be  spoken of and for, using the stage as ‘a site of power in which the human  [was] produced and reproduced – not just the humanness of the child  but also the humanness of those who [bore] and those who raise[d]   children, parents and nonparents alike’.31 A signifi cant difference exists between plays that use infants pre- dominantly for their symbolic import and Shakespeare’s late plays,  which sought to humanise the infants Marina, Perdita and Elizabeth I.  We should not let the familiarity of Shakespeare’s plays naturalise the  emotional role that his female infants occupy. Although Shakespeare  draws from a long dramatic tradition of staging infancy, his gender- ing and humanising of infants have a distinctive force to them. The use  of counterfeit infants in drama had roots in medieval religious plays,  particularly those that present Herod’s slaughter of the innocents, such  as the Towneley and Coventry cycles. In these plays, women have their  babes-in-arms taken from them and murdered, and the early modern  plays that continue the tradition of staging infanticide evoke pathos  through the display of the children’s vulnerability. Thomas Hughes’s  Inns of Court play The Misfortunes of Arthur (1588) features a dumb  show in which a soldier tears a ‘counterfeit child’ from the arms of a  courtly lady and dashes it against a wall, an act that the script allegorises  as ‘the fruit of Warre, which spareth neither man woman nor chil[d]’  (4.1).32 A similar moment in Alphonsus, Emperor of Germany (c. 1594;  published 1654) sees the Duke of Saxon unknowingly dashing his own  son’s brains out because he misguidedly believes the boy to be the son of  his rival.33 The play uses the scene to illustrate the destructive effects  of tyrannous behaviour. The Tragedie of Nero (1624) returns to the use  of the dead infant as symbol but in a less obviously allegorical mode  than The Misfortunes of Arthur. The lamentations of a woman who  enters carrying her ‘burnt child’ serve, along with a subsequent appear- ance of a man who has lost his wife, to express the general human cost  of Rome’s wrack and ruin.34 The difference between these tragic devices  and the deployment of infancy in Shakespeare’s late plays lies in the lat- ter’s use of infants as characters-to-be rather than emblems. If infants in  tragedy exist to be killed, infants in Shakespeare exist to grow up. That is not to say that infants do not occasionally reappear as children  or adults in plays not written by Shakespeare, but they tend to remain  ancillary to their parents’ narratives. The infant son and daughter in  both early modern versions of Patient Grissill reappear on stage as part  of a family reconciliation that faintly echoes the end of The Winter’s  Tale, but the children themselves play little role in the story.35 In general,  HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   110 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="8"> Female Infants and the Engendering of Humanity     111 infants in non-Shakespearean comedies function predominantly as  material evidence of sexual activity. Martia’s baby in The Blind Beggar  of Alexandria (1598), for example, acts as a visual sign of her affair with  Cleanthes.36 The same is true of Thomas Heywood’s A Maidenhead  Well Lost (1634), where the son of Julia and the Prince of Parma proves  their marriage and prevents her from being married to the Prince of  Florence.37 Having initially rejected the pregnant Julia due to the Iago- like machinations of the Duke’s secretary Stroza, Parma realises that  he has been misled about Juliet’s faithfulness when he witnesses the  resemblance of the infant to himself. He rescues the child from death  by exposure, to which Julia’s father the Duke of Milan has committed  it, and produces the infant on a covered dish at the banquet attending  Julia’s nuptials with Florence. The child-prop offers dramatic proof that  Julia is no longer a virgin and becomes the grounds upon which Parma  can reclaim her as his wife. More akin to Shakespeare’s late plays were The Thracian Wonder  (c. 1600; published 1661), Tom a Lincoln (c. 1600) and The Weakest  Goeth to the Wall (1600). In The Thracian Wonder, the princess Ariadne  fl ees with her infant son Eusanius, having incurred her father’s anger by  secretly marrying Radagon, a prince of Sicily. After being separated from  her child, she takes refuge amongst a group of shepherds, where Eusanius  reappears at the age of twenty.38 Likewise, Tom a Lincoln (c. 1600),  based on the popular romance of the same name, features two boys,  the illegitimate offspring of King Arthur and the Mayor of London’s  daughter. The play stages the abduction of the infant children from  their mother, and then follows their adventures before reuniting them.39  Although we do not know who performed The Thracian Wonder or Tom  a Lincoln, the title page of The Weakest Goeth to the Wall claims it was  performed by the Lord Chamberlain’s men, so it is likely that Shakespeare  would have come into contact with this play.40 Telling the story of a war  between Lodwicke, Duke of Bullen, and Mercury, Duke of Anjou, the  play opens with a dumb show that mimics the discovery of Moses in  the bulrushes. Fleeing the troops of Anjou, the Duchess of Burgundy  leaves Lodwicke’s infant son Fredericke on the river bank before she  herself leaps into the river and drowns. Discovered by his uncle Philip,  the Duke of Brabant, Fredericke eventually reunites with his father and  resumes his proper social position. Drawing on the same romance tropes  as Shakespeare’s Pericles and The Winter’s Tale, The Weakest Goeth to  the Wall has Lodwicke, like Leontes and Pericles, falsely believe his wife  and child have died, and, like Shakespeare’s romances, the anonymous  play’s resolution rests upon the reunifi cation of the family. The simi- larities end there, however, as Shakespeare turns the political and gender  HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   111 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="9">  112    The Girlhood of Shakespeare’s Sisters roles upside down. The Weakest tells a largely political and dynastic  tale, focusing on the confl ict between the dukes, the ensuing battles and  Lodwicke’s eventual triumph over Mercury. In Pericles and The Winter’s  Tale, on the other hand, Shakespeare raises familial and domestic con- fl icts to the realm of the political, and he reverses the gender roles. Where  Lodwicke recovers his son, Pericles and Leontes recover their daughters;  where Fredericke’s marriage gives Lodwicke a daughter-in-law, Perdita’s  and Marina’s marriages provide their fathers with sons-in-law. Instead  of political triumph in war and politics, victory in Shakespeare is the  reunion and regeneration of the royal family. II To understand the stakes of identifying infants as both royal and female  in Shakespeare’s plays, we need to understand the complexities of  infancy as a life stage in early modern England. Presenting the biologi- cal sex of infants on stage would have been a complicated performative  act because sexual differences between them were in many ways not yet  socially legible. We can see this most clearly if we return to the woodcut  from John Amos Comenius’s Orbis Sensualium Pictus that I discussed in  Chapter 1 (see Figure 1).41 By representing women’s lives as also divisible  into stages, Comenius divides children into ‘boys and girls’ and ‘damsels  and youths’, just as adults were divided into ‘men and women’. Like the  ‘maid, wife, widow’ schema, this particular progression makes life into  a progress through mutually exclusive stages, with age rather than mar- riage enabling the transition from one to the next. Interestingly, infancy  is the only stage for which the woodcut does not include separate male  and female representatives. Even as seventeenth-century taxonomies  were dividing childhood into the distinguishable categories of boyhood  and girlhood, infancy remained unique in that future sexual differences  had not become socially (and in this case visually) legible because the  clothing of infants was gender neutral. If sexual distinctions between  children in early modern England were less marked than in adulthood,  infancy was a time when sexual differences had not yet manifested as  easily distinguishable gender differences.42 Parents were often interested  in the biological sex of their children, but the social and bodily processes  through which male and female children were differentiated had not yet  taken place. The diffi culty of telling unbreeched boys from girls in early  modern paintings is well known;43 imagine how much more diffi cult it  would have been to tell a male infant from a female one, given that the  swaddling bands and blankets of infancy had no gender markers. HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   112 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="10"> Female Infants and the Engendering of Humanity     113 Moreover, infants, like preadolescent children, have not yet mani- fested secondary sex characteristics, making it harder to determine their  gender. In the process of criticising midwives for claiming to be able  to divine the sex of a child in the womb, Jacques Guillemeau reveals  how indistinct sexual differences between infants can be. In his medical  tract, Child-birth, or The Happy Deliverie of Women, translated into  English in 1612, Guillemeau points out that knowing whether a woman  had conceived a child could be diffi cult early in her pregnancy and that  discovering the sex of the child before birth was even more challenging.  Though he admits that ‘there are some that boast they can certainely do  it’, Guillemeau suggests that they do so ‘rather by chance than through  either arte or skill’.44 To prove that midwives cannot really be sure of the  child’s sex in advance, Guillemeau shifts the emphasis from the herme- neutic challenges of reading biological sex through the mother’s body  to the inherent diffi culty of interpreting the child’s body. He relates a  story demonstrating that it is diffi cult to know the sex of a child whose  genitals are covered even after birth: I haue shewed [midwives] a child newly come from the mothers wombe,  onely laying my hand vpon the priuie parts, yet durst they not be so bold as  giue their opinion thereof, saying, that it were more easie to iudge of it when  it was in the wombe, seeing that from thence might be gathered many euident  signes: but wee must account the greatest part of them to be vncertain, as we  haue formerly said.45 Guillemeau’s main goal here is to disparage the skill of midwives, but  in the process he provides a valuable reminder that before the bodies of  children are marked with the social signs of gender, it can in fact be dif- fi cult to tell boys and girls apart. Even today, with the excessive gender- ing of mass-marketed baby clothing and toys, it is not uncommon for  strangers to mistake the sex of an infant. The phenomenon of attaching  hair bows to the hairless heads of little girls to make sure that their  gender is obvious attests to the anxiety that can be caused by the visual  indeterminacy of the infant body. Shakespeare’s plays work against this traditional construction of  infants as pre-gender. In the context of the tripartite division between  men, women and boys that I discussed in my introduction, the presence  of girls on Shakespeare’s stage would have struck a potentially jarring  note since it posited the same kind of developmental trajectory between  girls and women as between boys and men. The tripartite model  produces an asymmetrical construction of childhood that recognises  boyhood, but not girlhood, as a separate phase of life. By representing  female infants as inhabiting a specifi cally gendered space, Shakespeare  HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   113 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="11">  114    The Girlhood of Shakespeare’s Sisters imagines his girls as having childhoods akin to Ariès’s specialised boys,  thereby participating in a cultural reimagining of girlhood. III Pericles (c. 1607–8) was Shakespeare’s earliest experiment with staging  female infancy, and the presentation of the child Marina during the  storm at sea provides an example of both the emotional power evoked  by infants as props and the crucial role that language played in establish- ing female infants as characters rather than objects. By humanising and  gendering Marina, Shakespeare sets her apart from the general run of  pre-gender, quasi-human infants. The nurse Lychorida carries the infant  on stage at the same moment that she announces the mother Thaisa’s  death, providing Pericles with the dramatic opportunity to convey his  sorrow to the audience via the represented infant. In addition to his own  grief at the loss of his wife, Pericles calls attention to the hardship of  coming into the world under such circumstances. The bundle of blan- kets, like the infant it represents, is a ‘thing’ that gets reconstituted as a  future human being. Lychorida’s language makes this duplicity explicit.  ‘Here’, she laments, ‘is a thing too young for such a place . . . Take in  your arms this piece / Of your dead queen’ (11.15–18, my emphasis).  As yet unseen by her father, the unnamed infant is merely a ‘piece’ of its  mother, a ‘thing’ that does not yet have the status of the fully human.  In a moment that is extremely moving in performance, Lychorida hands  the child to its father, and Pericles initiates the process of transforming  the ‘thing’ from a stage prop to a female character, his ‘little daughter’  (11.21). His language anthropomorphises the bundle of blankets by  crediting it with human needs, such as ‘careful nursing’ and protection  from the elements. Despite the poignancy of Pericles’s speech, however, the infant  Marina in Scene 11 functions predominantly as an object for the projec- tion of adults’ emotions rather than as a character to whom emotions  are ascribed. Pericles emphasises Marina’s smallness and vulnerability  rather than her gender, perhaps because the script focuses on Pericles’s  palpable grief for his dead wife Thaisa more than his newly formed  relationship with the child. Lychorida immediately identifi es the infant  as a daughter, but she remains tellingly unnamed. Where the play truly  establishes the child as a future human character is in Scene 13, at which  point Pericles has had time to bond with her. The infant as prop is once  again carried on stage, but this time Pericles emphasises her plight as a  female child. Pericles has already taken care of the scene’s expositional  HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   114 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="12"> Female Infants and the Engendering of Humanity     115 function at the end of Scene 11, where he has announced his intention  of leaving Marina in the care of Cleon and Dionyza. The purpose of  Scene 13, therefore, appears to be twofold: fi rst, to take advantage of  the emotional charge of Pericles’s love for his daughter, and second, to  further establish the infant daughter as a female character who will later  appear on stage. Pericles does this by giving the ‘gentle babe’ the name  of ‘Marina’ in honour of her birth at sea, by talking about the child  as ‘she’ and by imagining her in the future as having grown up into a  woman. Whereas Pericles has previously referred to ‘this poor infant’ as  ‘it’, he begins in this scene to talk about her as a future adult woman.  Pericles requests that the king and queen of Tarsus ‘give her princely  training, that she may be / Mannered as she is born’ (13.16–17); he then  vows not to cut his hair until ‘she be married’ (13.27, my emphasis). I  will return again to the signifi cance of referring to a child as ‘it’ rather  than as ‘she’ or ‘he’ in my section on The Winter’s Tale; the important  point to note with regard to Pericles is the way that the father’s projec- tion of a future for his daughter establishes Lychorida’s ‘little mistress’  as a future human being – one who will occupy a gender and class posi- tion (13.40). The oral scripting of Marina’s forthcoming life produces  her as an extraordinary infant by initiating her into girlhood during her  infancy. What we see in Shakespeare’s staging of female infancy is a rework- ing of Comenius’s woodcut. The gendering of Marina imagines female  infancy as a separate stage of childhood. Pericles produces his daughter  as a girl, isolating her temporarily from danger and providing a space  for her to be ‘mannered’ as she was born; in effect, he makes Marina  into an example of a specialised child. Except for Clarence’s daugher in  Richard III, Shakespeare does not seem to have staged the transitional  period between female infancy and womanhood – a period we might  describe today as girlhood – but Gower’s speech at the opening of Scene  15 gives us a glimpse into how that transition might have been imag- ined. Marina’s emergence as a young woman or maid gets set up via a  narrative of education and training. She has been ‘by Cleon trained’ in  music and letters and has ‘gained / Of education all the grace, / Which  makes her both the heart and place / Of gen’ral wonder’ (15.7–11).  Even as Gower contrasts the skilful and beautiful Marina to Cleon and  Dionyza’s daughter Philoten, he uses the connection between the two to  establish Marina as having been transformed from the infant of Scenes  11 and 13 into the young woman of the last part of the play. Because we  know the two friends have been raised together, we know that Marina,  like Philoten, has grown up. When Gower calls Philoten a ‘maid’ and  ‘full-grown lass’, he likewise constructs Marina as a maid who is ripe for  HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   115 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="13">  116    The Girlhood of Shakespeare’s Sisters marriage and ready to have adventures of her own. Gower thus p repares  the audience for her entrance on stage as a speaking character. She goes  from being spoken of as a ‘poor infant’ by her father to speaking of  herself as a ‘poor maid, / Born in a tempest’ (15.69–70). Having passed  through the relatively sheltered stage of girlhood, Marina emerges as a  full-grown lass who has gained the skills necessary to function in the  adult world. The dangers to which she is exposed do not threaten her  until she emerges from the space of childhood. In Pericles, more so than in the other two plays I discuss, the royal  girl’s gender fulfi ls a symbolic function within the play. Ultimately,  Marina transforms from being a piece of her mother to being a mother  fi gure herself. When Pericles arrives senseless and unable to speak in  Mytilene, Marina recalls him to his senses by telling him her life story.  Deanne Williams offers a brilliant reading of the way this scene undoes  the patriarchal logic that underpins and in many ways rationalises the  incest with which the play begins. In a patriarchal system that treats  women as objects of exchange between men, daughters are the property  of their fathers, making them logically their fathers’ sexual property.46  Pericles imagines a different basis for the parent-child relationship, one  based on mutual affection and recognition. The play enacts this pos- sibility by having Pericles reverse his paternal role as the begetter of  Marina and make himself into her child: ‘O, come hither, / Thou that  beget’st him that did thee beget’ (5.1.194–5). This line refl ects both  the immediate context of the play in which Marina’s tale serves as a  regenerative treatment for the ailing king and the larger theory through  which parents’ children enable them to continue living through the con- tinuation of their seed. The restorative power of Marina’s discourse lies  not only in her identifi cation with her father’s sufferings, but also in his  ability to identify with her. Pericles tells Marina that if her grief proves  a ‘thousandth part’ of his, ‘thou art a man, and I / Have suffered like  a girl’ (5.1.131–2). Given the correspondence between the father and  daughter’s sorrows, it would appear that Pericles has suffered like a girl  – like his own daughter, whose hardships he foresaw when he imagined  her future as an adult woman. IV Having previously experimented with the presentation of a female  infant on stage in Pericles, Shakespeare once again returns to the issue  of daughters as royal heirs in The Winter’s Tale, a play that even more  explicitly establishes the stakes of identifying an infant as a girl. In  HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   116 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="14"> Female Infants and the Engendering of Humanity     117 Shakespeare’s time, as today, the question of whether a child was male  or female was often one of the fi rst asked, and on stage, the answer  functioned as a verbal alternative to viewing the child’s body. When  the Old Shepherd encounters the abandoned Perdita on the Bohemian  seacoast, his immediate response is to wonder about the child’s biologi- cal sex. His phrasing of the question has given rise to a textual crux. He  exclaims, ‘Mercy on’s, a bairn! A very pretty bairn. A boy or a child,  I wonder?’ (3.3.67–8). Editors disagree about this line, most glossing  ‘child’ as ‘girl’ with little other explanation. For some, the enigmatic line  is taken as a display of the Shepherd’s rustic ignorance, since a boy is a  child.47 However, more recent editors have acknowledged that ‘child’  was a synonym for ‘girl’ in some English dialects, a fact that reinforces  the sense in which childhood was by defi nition girlish.48 Whether or not the Old Shepherd provides an example of a user of  dialect or a misuser of language, he dramatises the moment through  which ‘the mark of gender appears to “qualify” bodies as human  bodies’.49 Identifying the sex of children provides a verbal performance  of their interpellation into a gendered subject position long before the  infant enters into discourse as a speaking ‘I’. In the case of Perdita, the  Old Shepherd’s question matters precisely because the infant as prop  has to emerge later as an embodied female character, a theatrical sub- stitution predicated on an already established gender identity. When  the Shepherd poses his question, the audience would already know the  answer because Emilia establishes the child’s biological sex in Act 2,  Scene 2. When Paulina asks if Hermione has been delivered of ‘A boy?’  Emilia replies, ‘A daughter, and a goodly babe, / Lusty, and like to live’  (2.2.29–30). Establishing Perdita not only as female but also as ‘like  to live’ provides a stark contrast to the failing health of Mamillius and  sets Perdita up to replace Mamillius as the play’s central child. Staging  the rediscovery of Perdita’s girlhood in Act 3 plays a critical role in  her translation from Sicilian princess to Bohemian country shepherd- ess, from the royal ‘girl’ to the rustic ‘child’. This substitution follows  a similar one, of the human ‘bairn’ for the Old Shepherd’s lost sheep,  which he has been seeking when he fi nds the child. It is almost as if the  Shepherd’s identifi cation of the bundle as representing a human being  rather than a lost animal depends upon his ability to ask whether it   represents a ‘boy or a child’. That said, Shakespeare’s contemporaries were apparently much more  comfortable than we are with prolonging the time in which infants  remained suspended within the position of the unspeaking ‘it’. Language  registered the gender ambiguities of infancy through the commonplace  practice of referring to infants as ‘it’, regardless of sex. Barbara Traister’s  HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   117 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="15">  118    The Girlhood of Shakespeare’s Sisters work with Simon Forman’s medical manuscripts has shown that  Forman always used the neuter pronoun ‘it’ to refer to patients under  the age of ten. Traister writes, ‘He apparently did not think of children  as gendered until they approached puberty, when the pronoun by which  he referred to them became “he” or “she”.’50 Although not all writers  were as consistent as Forman in his linguistic practice, his use of ‘it’ to  refer to infants and very young children was hardly unique. An interest- ing parallel occurs in Pandosto, when the infant Fawnia’s acquisition of  human identity is registered in a linguistic shift from ‘it’ to the gendered  pronoun ‘she’. Fawnia, Perdita’s literary predecessor, enters the narra- tive through her identifi cation as a ‘daughter’, and yet Greene’s narrator  proceeds to refer to ‘the child’ as ‘it’ while ‘it’ remains an infant. When  Greene’s Shepherd fi rst hears Fawnia crying, he mistakes her sounds for  the bleating of a sheep. Like the Old Shepherd in Shakespeare’s play,  he soon discovers that what he initially thinks is an animal is instead a  child dressed in a rich mantle. Greene’s character considers carrying ‘it’  to the king to have ‘it’ brought up according to ‘its’ birth (in the manner  in which Pericles hopes to have Marina raised), but instead he takes  ‘it’ home to his wife so that they can keep the treasure packaged with  the infant. Not until after the Shepherd and his wife have adopted and  nourished the child so ‘cleanly and carefully as it began to be a jolly girl’  does the text switch and begin to refer to Fawnia as ‘she’. Like Marina  in Pericles, Fawnia’s entry into gender marks her entrance into the nar- rative as a human character, and she becomes, rather than is born, a  ‘girl’. This transformative moment, when the infant goes from being  ‘it’ to ‘she’, from a creature to a human being, is symptomatic of the  way early modern notions of humanity depended upon constructions of  gender. Shakespeare locates Perdita’s transformation from ‘it’ to ‘she’ at  a much younger age than Greene does for Fawnia; Emilia and Paulina  engender Perdita with humanity even before she re-emerges on stage as  a sixteen-year-old girl. Whereas the thematic centrality of daughters in Pericles does not  explore gender differences between children, the staging of female  infancy in The Winter’s Tale consciously supersedes the story of  boyhood with the story of girlhood. At the beginning of the play, the  dialogue focuses on the importance of male childhood friendship before  becoming, like Pericles, about the restoration of a wife and daughter.  The opening conversation between Camillo and Archidamus empha- sises the childhood connection between Leontes and Polixenes, and at  the outset, the play appears to be about royal boys. Camillo even calls  attention to Leontes’s son Mamillius as ‘a gallant child; one that, indeed,  physics the subject, makes old hearts fresh’ (1.1.33). It is not, however,  HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   118 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="16"> Female Infants and the Engendering of Humanity     119 Mamillius who will make old hearts fresh; it is Perdita who reintroduces  order, health and happiness into the royal family and, by extension, the  nation. The substitution of Perdita for Mamillius may well have been quite  literal if the same boy played both roles,51 but even without such a  staging, the play nonetheless dramatises his displacement. In the scene  featuring Mamillius and Hermione’s waiting women, Mamillius saucily  refuses to play with them. The First Lady tells him, ‘The Queen your  mother rounds apace. We shall / Present our services to a fi ne new prince  / One of these days, and then you’d wanton with us, / If we would have  you’ (2.1.17–20). Teasing Mamillius about the possibility that a new  ‘prince’ – a word that could designate a male or female ruler – could  replace him, the First Lady jestingly evokes the anxieties of an older  child about the birth of a younger one. That replacement is exactly what  the play enacts. Perdita’s name means ‘lost’, but she is ultimately recov- ered, whereas Mamillius’s death leads to his permanent loss. His erasure  begins with Perdita’s birth and becomes complete with the Oracle’s  pronouncement during Hermione’s trial. The prophecy from Delphos  makes no mention of Mamillius. It reads, ‘Hermione is chaste, Polixenes  blameless, Camillo a true subject, Leontes a jealous tyrant, his innocent  babe truly begotten; and the king shall live without an heir if that which  is lost be not found’ (3.2.131–4). As the ‘truly begotten babe’, Perdita  is that which has been lost and that which must be found; in the last  acts she becomes a ‘princess’, writing out the gender-ambiguous term  ‘prince’ and becoming a gender-specifi c royal heir. As Susan Snyder has discussed, Leontes’s relationship with his son  disintegrates with the father’s conviction that Mamillius is not his own,  leading the disturbed king to wrench him away from his mother and  female caretakers in Act 2, Scene 1. That is the last time Mamillius  appears on stage, and when we next hear of him, he has given way to the  illness that kills him. ‘It is almost as if’, says Snyder, ‘removing him from  motherly care takes away his palpable physical reality.’52 Mamillius’s  name, of course, derives from mamilla, the breast, indicating the child’s  bodily dependence on his mother. Although he is fi ve years old and no  longer nursing, he remains unbreeched and visibly still under the care of  women. Snyder describes the forcible separation of mother and son as  an act that helps initiate a gender polarisation in the play, spatially as  well as thematically.53 By relegating Hermione and her female attend- ants to prison, Leontes sets up a division between men and women of  the court, culminating in a clash between the two sexes at the trial. The  effect on Mamillius of this radical breech between the sexes is immediate  and, unlike Hermione’s death, irreversible. Not yet ready to leave the  HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   119 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="17">  120    The Girlhood of Shakespeare’s Sisters world of female caretaking, he perishes, and is resurrected only in so far  as Perdita takes his place. Whereas traditional readings of the play attribute Leontes’s disaffec- tion with Mamillius to anxiety over the impossibility of proving pater- nity, Robert Reeder has read this resentment as part of a desire to return  to childhood. As Mary Ellen Lamb has argued, the scene where Leontes  separates mother and son recapitulates the violent rupture in the lives of  early modern boys when they were taken from the care of their mother  and nurse and thrust into the masculine sphere of education and martial  training.54 In Reeder’s view, Leontes’s obsessive need to see himself in  his son stems from his jealousy of his son’s ability to frisk in the sun and  plead ‘not guilty’ at judgement day. Similar to Reeder’s emphasis on  patriarchal jealousy of the unbreeched boy is Diane Purkiss’s analysis of  the compensatory fi ction of childhood that little girls offer in Andrew  Marvell’s poetry. For girls, no absolute break with female caretakers  had to take place. She argues that young girls take on a prominent role  in Marvell’s poetry because they offer a utopian vision of innocence  for adult men who have been disillusioned by the violence of the Civil  War.55 In The Winter’s Tale, as in Pericles, a rupture between female  child and female caretakers does take place, which complicates the pos- sibility of seeing girlhood as an idealised space of innocence. In fact,  Pericles and The Winter’s Tale reveal the necessity of rupture to push  girls, like boys, into a specialised realm of childhood. It is my contention that Perdita’s role as royal heir facilitates a vision  of dynastic descent that can mend patrilineal failure. At a time when  James’s ascension to the throne promised the restoration of primo- geniture to the English monarchy, Shakespeare and his contemporaries  would have continued to be aware that an unbroken line of succession  from father to son was a monarchical ideal rather than an absolute  requirement. Since Henry VIII’s death, the country had seen a series of  royal daughters in the role of queen, and for all of James’s patriarchal  propaganda, he claimed his descent from Henry VII through the female  line. Like the founding king of the Tudor dynasty, contenders for the  throne frequently shored up their claims by marrying royal women,  making women in the line of succession one of the ways in which family  dynasties could be reshaped to produce the illusion of an unbroken  family lineage. It is an often overlooked detail of the Gunpowder Plot  that the conspirators supposedly aimed not only to depose James, but  to set up his daughter Elizabeth in his stead as a Catholic queen. This  seems odd in light of what we know about her Protestant convictions,  but it demonstrates the extent to which royal women could open up  alternatives to the existing monarchical arrangement. To be clear, I do  HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   120 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="18"> Female Infants and the Engendering of Humanity     121 not mean to suggest that The Winter’s Tale directly mirrors actual politi- cal events; what I mean is that it represents an attempt to come to grips  with the reality of patrilineal failure and to imagine an alternative that  maintained the possibility of dynastic succession. V The Winter’s Tale anticipates the even more unlikely replacement of the  story of boyhood with the story of girlhood in Shakespeare and Fletcher’s  Henry VIII, or All Is True (1613). In this play we have the full fl owering  of the political connection between royal succession and female children  that we see in Pericles and The Winter’s Tale. As the story of Henry  VIII’s quest for a male heir, Shakespeare and Fletcher’s play anticipates  popular historiography’s fascination with the Tudor king’s reproductive  failures. What differentiates Shakespeare and Fletcher’s Henry VIII from  his historical model, however, is that the birth of Elizabeth I rather than  Edward VI satisfi es the king’s dynastic ambitions. Instead of dramatis- ing Henry’s disappointment that Elizabeth is a girl, the play gives us one  of the most curious moments in the Shakespearean corpus. Entering to  inform the king of Elizabeth’s birth, the Old Lady fi rst announces that  the queen has given birth to a boy. The exchange begins with Henry  asking: Is the Queen delivered? Say, ‘Ay, and of a boy.’ The Old Lady replies: Ay, ay, my liege, And of a lovely boy. The God of heaven Both now and ever bless her! ’Tis a girl Promises boys hereafter. (5.1.164–7) The Old Lady’s fi guration of the infant Elizabeth as a girl who promises  boys hereafter comes from an early modern adage suggesting that the  birth of a girl, while potentially disappointing to parents who wanted a  boy, could be encouraging as a sign of the mother’s future fertility.56 In  this particular case, however, the Old Lady’s statement would have been  powerfully ironic; the Jacobean audience would have known all too well  that Elizabeth’s birth did not presage the birth of future sons for her  mother Anne Bullen. Moreover, this enigmatic moment marks a turning  point within the framework of the play. The Old Lady’s r hetorical  HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   121 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="19">  122    The Girlhood of Shakespeare’s Sisters  doublespeak effectively erases the futurity implied by the promise of boys  and suggests that Elizabeth herself is the desired ‘lovely boy’. Enacting  a substitution that turns the audience’s expectations upside down, the  Old Lady verbally presents the infant as male and then regenders the boy  as a girl, fi rst referring to ‘her’ and then positively identifying ‘her’ as a  ‘girl’. The effect is to fi gure Elizabeth as the ideal infant in and of herself.  Remarkably, the Old Lady’s explanation satisfi es Henry, who goes on in  the fi nal christening scene to proclaim, ‘Never before / This happy child  did I get any thing’ (5.4.64–5). Explicitly rejecting Mary, Henry might  as well add, ‘Never again will I get anything’, since the play completely  eclipses the historical male heir Edward VI. The Old Lady initiates a shift in the play’s focus that culminates in  the presentation of the infant Elizabeth on stage during her christening  in Act 5 Scene 4. Using the language of nature, Cranmer prophesies that  Elizabeth will be the infant-mother whose birth signals the onset of an  English golden age: This royal infant—heaven still move about her— Though in her cradle, yet now promises Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings, Which time shall bring to ripeness . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Her foes shake like a fi eld of beaten corn, And hang their heads with sorrow. Good grows with her. In her days every man shall eat in safety Under his own vine what he plants and sing The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours. (5.4.18–35) This passage celebrates Elizabeth’s fertility, not her mother’s. Elizabeth  will ripen blessings and render the land so fertile that the yield will feed  all the English. Her fertility will make all of England fertile, and as she  grows, so too will goodness. Although Elizabeth’s status as the virgin  queen complicates Cranmer’s representation – she will, as Cranmer says,  die ‘yet a virgin’ (5.4.60) – he reconciles Elizabeth’s virginity with her  reproductive capacity by calling her ‘the maiden phoenix’ out of whose  ashes an heir will rise. That heir, of course, is James I, and Cranmer  suggests that Elizabeth’s legacy gives birth to James as well: ‘He shall  fl ourish / And like a mountain cedar reach his braches / To all the plains  about him’ (5.4.52–4). Like the land that Elizabeth makes fertile and  the vines she helps to grow, James is a tree whose growth Elizabeth  makes possible. Elizabeth, like Perdita, becomes a symbolic mother, a   matriarch who will beget a grand patriarchal future. From a contemporary perspective, it might be tempting to see the  HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   122 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="20"> Female Infants and the Engendering of Humanity     123 development of girlhood as empowering, but as we see with Marina,  Perdita and Elizabeth, girlhood resonates in complex ways that cannot  be seen as wholly positive or negative. As with the idea of childhood, or  what Hugh Cunningham has more accurately called ‘the middle-class  ideology of childhood’, the idea of girlhood came with the isolation of  girls into a special category.57 When Ariès claimed that the seventeenth  century invented the sentiment of childhood, the violent reaction against  his argument took as its starting point the assumption that not having  a sentiment of childhood necessarily indicated backwardness. But  Ariès did not see the development of modern childhood as unequivo- cally benefi cial. The nuclear family, built around the special category  of the child, comes at the expense of sociability. The construction of  girlhood as a distinct stage of childhood, I would suggest, produced  similarly complex results that cannot be boiled down to a teleological  historical narrative. Shakespeare’s royal girls can play crucial roles in  the form of succession, but they do so in the service of re-establishing  patrilineal descent. Not only can their reproductive powers be harnessed  in the service of the dynasty, so too can their marriages enable a form  of royal power sharing, where the father-king and mother-queen can  remain the sovereign rulers of one country, while the daughter and her  husband take over another. Even as the emphasis shifts, as it does in  Cranmer’s speech, from biological generation to spiritual engendering,  the goal is to pass on the patrilineal right to any potential male heirs,  thus making Shakespeare’s royal female infants into girls ‘who promise  boys hereafter’. Shakespeare’s girls may join boys in the realm of child- hood, but their legitimacy prevents them from challenging the system  that accepts them as heirs against its will. As mute, ungendered props,  the bundles of blankets that represented infants on stage paradoxically  offered the ideal vehicle for imagining a future articulate voice for royal  girls. Middleton’s middle-class female infants, on the other hand, do not  go on to become older female characters, nor do his other characters  imagine them as future speaking subjects. Instead, I argue in the rest  of this chapter that Middleton stages female infancy to redefi ne legiti- macy not as being born within wedlock but as being integrated into the   affective kinship network of the London social community. VI In late January 1613, the Countess of Salisbury, wife of William Cecil,  the second Earl of Salisbury and son of Robert Cecil, gave birth to a  daughter whose nativity was to become the talk of London society. So  HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   123 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="21">  124    The Girlhood of Shakespeare’s Sisters sumptuous was the Countess’s post-partum lying-in that on 4 February  1613 John Chamberlain estimated the value of the goods used to   decorate her chamber at 14,000 pounds: About this day sevenit the Countesse of Salisburie was brought abed of a  daughter, and lies in very richly, for the hanging of her chamber, being white  satin, embroidered with gold (or silver) and perle is valued at fowreteen   thousand pounds.58 For the Countess, these rich items of embroidered satin would have been  used to make her room into a consecrated space, thus producing an all- female enclosure that both isolated and elevated her until her churching  forty days later. To be able to afford a comfortable, luxurious lying-in  was a sign of class status, and editors have traditionally considered  the Countess of Salisbury’s real-life extravagance to be parodied in the  upstart pretentions of Mrs Allwit’s expensive confi nement in Thomas  Middleton’s A Chaste Maid in Cheapside.59 In contrast to the lying-in,  the christening of the infant was a moment at which the mother was  absent, taking place as it did within a few days of birth, well before  the mother’s churching and reintroduction to the community at large.  Appointing godparents was the responsibility of the father, a process  that is vulgarised in Middleton’s play because the wittol Master Allwit  seeks out gossips for his wife’s bastard child by Sir Walter Whorehound.  The christening scene, however, makes an important comment about the  way the play constructs infancy, gender and class. As the central rite of initiation of children into the Church, baptism  was a crucial fi rst step in a child’s integration into early modern religious  and social existence, and it communally staged the infant as a future  speaking subject. Godparents promised on behalf of their godchildren  that they would forsake the devil and serve God, and when they did so,  they spoke in the projected voice of the infant. Like the Catholic liturgy,  the English Protestant liturgy was specifi cally adapted to emphasise the  importance of coming to religion as a child. But unlike the Catholic  liturgy, the offi cial Protestant baptismal ceremony did not differenti- ate between the spiritual positions of girls and boys, and it did not  include separate prayers for children of different sexes. With the Book  of Common Prayer, the long-standing Catholic practice of repeating   different prayers for boys and girls was abolished.60 At a time when other early modern English cultural sites were register- ing an increased differentiation between boys and girls (as in Comenius’s  book), baptism went the other way. In the last version of the Catholic  ‘Sarum Rite’ published before the fi rst Book of Common Prayer, we can  see a striking contrast to what would become the English liturgy. As  HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   124 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="22"> Female Infants and the Engendering of Humanity     125 E. C. Whitaker suggests, Thomas Cranmer and other English reform- ers would most likely have worked from the 1543 Rouen edition of  Manuale ad usum percelebris ecclesiae Sarisburiensis, translated in  1960 by A. J. Collins.61 The Latin Manuale’s ‘Order for the Making of  a Catechumen’ begins with the order that the infant should be brought  to the church door where the priest should ask the midwife if it is male  or female, whether it has been baptised at home, and what name the  child is to be called. The 1549 and subsequent editions of the Book  of Common Prayer kept the practice of asking the child’s name, but it  did not include a formal question about the child’s biological sex. The  Protestant ceremony also did away with the Sarum Rite’s specifi cation  that male infants be placed on the right side of the priest and female  infants on the left. Unlike offi cial English Protestant baptismal ceremo- nies, theatrical representations of female infants brought questions of  gender to the forefront. When characters in early modern drama asked  if a child were a boy or a girl, they were in many ways re-establishing a  public ritual that no longer had a place at the church door. Before I turn directly to Middleton’s christening scene, I fi rst want to  put it into the context of an earlier mock christening scene from Robert  Wilson’s The Cobbler’s Prophecy (printed 1594) that explicitly uses  a parody of the baptismal liturgy to pose the question ‘Is it a boy or  a girl?’. Wilson’s allegorical morality play condemns illegitimacy and  illustrates the negative consequences of illicit lust on the divine and  human worlds. At the centre of the trouble lies the character Contempt,  disguised as Content, who wreaks havoc among the gods as well as a  set of humans defi ned by their professions, and Venus, who fi rst betrays  Vulcan with Mars and then betrays Mars with Contempt. In retalia- tion for Venus’s wanton behavior, Mercury revokes her title as goddess  and curses the child in a parodic inversion of the baptismal blessing.  The infant Ruina becomes the allegorical embodiment of the upheaval  caused when Mars gets distracted from his divine and moral duties by  his affair with Venus. In Mars’s absence, the false god Contempt, also  Venus’s lover, lures characters like Enmius the Courtier into treason- ous behaviour, threatening the Duke’s realm of Boethia with ruin. The  allegorical incarnation of that threat comes in the form of the bastard  daughter of Venus and Contempt, carried on stage by two of Venus’s  maidens, Ru and Ina. The female infant’s birth provides the council of  the gods with proof of Venus’s doubly adulterous behaviour, cuckolding  Vulcan with Mars and then cuckolding Mars with Contempt. Mercury,  who serves as the play’s principal voice of morality, announces that  Venus has been stripped of the title of Goddess and renamed Lust or  ‘the strumpet Venus’. He then derisively assumes the role of a priest,  HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   125 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="23">  126    The Girlhood of Shakespeare’s Sisters  performing a mock baptismal ceremony. Like the priest at the church  door, Mercury demands to know the child’s sex, her name, and the  names of her godmothers and godfather: Mercury: Whose child is that you beare so tenderly? Ru: My Ladies child, begotten by contempt. Mercury: O is it so, and whether beare you it? Ina: To nurse. Mercury: To whom? Ru: Vnto securitie. Mercury: Is it a boy or girle, I praie ye tell? Ina: A girle it is. Mercury: Who were the godmothers? Ru: We two are they. Mercury: Your names I craue. Ru: Mine Ru and hers is Ina. Mercury: And whether name I praie yee beares the girle? Ina: Both hers and mine. Mercury: And who is godfather? Ru: Ingratitude that is likewise the grandfather. Mercury: Ruina otherwise called Ruine the child,  Contempt the father, Venus alias lust the mother,  Ru and Ina the godmother,  Ingratitude the Godfather and grandfather,  And Securitie the nurse,  Heeres a brood that all Booetia shall curse.  Well damsels hie you hence, for one is comming nigh  Will treade your yong one vnder foot.62 Although the play’s didactic function makes it a foil for Middleton’s  amoral city comedies, its humanisation of the infant Ruina in a scene  following Venus’s denunciation reveals how powerfully resonant the  Catholic ceremony still was in the 1590s and why the social dramati- sation and recognition of the biological sex of infants on stage would  still have carried so much symbolic weight. By imitating what usually  functioned as an incorporation of an infant into the community,  Mercury calls attention to the need for Boethia to curse rather than  bless the product of adultery in order to avoid the ruin threatened by  the child’s name. Mercury has previously put the wheels in motion for  Ruina’s birth to provoke reform among the gods as well as the citizens  of Boethia. He chooses Raph the Cobbler to be his prophetic instrument  and sends him on a quest to convey a riddle revealing Venus’s betrayal  to Mars. Tipped off by Raph, Mars becomes enraged and vows revenge  upon Venus and all her kind, including the offspring of her liaison with  Contempt. Ru and Ina fl ee with their goddaughter to protect the ‘yong  one’ from Mars’s wrath.

For all that Ruina  acts as a material incarnation of Venus’s sin, Ru and Ina’s description  of the ‘poore babe’ fi rmly establishes her as more than mere allegory,  though her allegorical status makes her anthropomorphism more com- plicated. Ina calls attention to the hardship on the child of being sepa- rated from her mother, tapping into sympathies for her vulnerability,  just as Pericles does in Shakespeare’s play. The baptismal scene may be  tinged with contempt, but in performance, it is hard to imagine that the  represented infant would not have elicited a certain amount of pathos.  Whatever sins Ruina embodies, the actual exercise of Mars’s infanticidal  rage would most likely work against the audience’s sympathy for the  play’s moral lesson. Instead of punishing Venus via Mars’s revenge, the play defl ects the  killing of Venus and her servants, substituting instead a war against  the invading troops of Thessaly. With Mars and masculinity restored, the  Duke, with the help of Sateros the Soldier, successfully defends Boethia  against an attack. Sateros, unlike the other allegorical characters, has  seen through Contempt and rejected his offer of patronage, and the war  provides him with employment. In the end, Contempt rather than Mars  punishes Venus by abandoning her and leaving her alone and miserable,  though alive. The allegorisation of the consequences of adultery in the  form of a female infant refl ects the very real way in which pregnancy  could prove that an unmarried woman was no longer a virgin. Giving  birth to a child was a tangible way that virginity could be disproved,  and the maid whose illegitimate infant cannot be concealed is a common  fi gure in early modern ballads, pamphlets, conduct literature and drama. Jacobean city comedies, particularly those by Middleton, also fre- quently take women’s chastity as a central theme, and in A Chaste  Maid in Cheapside, as well as his play A Fair Quarrel (co-written with  William Rowley), Middleton uses the births of female infants to work  though questions of adultery in a very different way from Wilson. The  staging of female infancy in Middleton actually deprivileges legitimacy  as a determining factor of a child’s identity. Instead, gender identity  signals integration into an affective kinship network and enables inte- gration into the larger social community, enabling the infant on stage to  achieve the status of a human. At the beginning of A Fair Quarrel, Master Russell’s speech actually  reverses the emotional impulses of primogeniture, which steers parental  desire toward sons for economic reasons. Rather than seeing a son as the  ideal heir, Russell suggests that the opposite is true. A daughter needs a  dowry, whereas a son could be expected to fend for himself: HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   127 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="25">  128    The Girlhood of Shakespeare’s Sisters . . . Had I been left In a son behind me, while I had been here He should have shifted as I did before him, Lived on the freeborn portion of his wit; But a daughter, and that an only one—Oh! We cannot be too careful o’her, too tender; ’Tis such a brittle niceness, a mere cupboard of glasses, The least shake breaks or cracks ’em. All my aim is To cast her upon riches: (1.1.2–10)63 Having made his fortune on his own merit, Russell would have expected  a son to do as he ‘did before him’. ‘But a daughter’, he suggests, has no  such recourse. For her, he feels the responsibility to ensure her fi nancial  security. His attitude, though solidly merchant class in its relation to  men, refl ects the viewpoint of the gentry and aristocracy, where mar- riage becomes a young woman’s livelihood; Russell does not consider  that his daughter Jane might also make her way via service or appren- ticeship, as many middling- and lower-class women did. With Russell’s  wealth, he has acquired a certain level of blindness about the extent to  which women in his own social class participated in the economic realm.  Nonetheless, he illustrates a form of fatherly affection that rejects the  aristocratic and royal emphasis on producing sons. Primogeniture might favour sons, but when property was not at stake,  there was no material advantage to having a boy rather than a girl.  Although demographic statistics about the relative costs of apprentic- ing a boy and a girl have varied, one source from the late seventeenth  century suggests that the cost of raising and training up poor children  was the same for both sexes. In 1682, the parish of St Paul’s in Covent  Garden petitioned the gentry for charitable contributions to supplement  a gift from William, Earl of Bedford, so that ten poor children from the  parishes of St Martin’s, St Giles and St Clement Danes ‘shall always have  their Breeding, Habit, and placing forth’ through the establishment of  a charity hospital at High Gate.64 Their long-term goal was to establish  a hospital of their own, like the one at Christ Church, through which  they would be able to maintain a number of poor children, the cost of  which they estimated at three pounds yearly per child, ‘Boy or Girl’, at  which rate they estimated that three hundred pounds would maintain a  hundred children per year. The petition posited this equality of cost for  boys and girls despite openly acknowledging that they would be trained  and educated differently: The Boys shall all be taught to Read, Write, Cast Accounts, some the  Rudiments of Navigation, or Learning, if apt unto it, common Painting,  HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   128 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="26"> Female Infants and the Engendering of Humanity     129 Planting and Gardening, and other for Drawing, which very many Children  are much inclinable to with Pen or Chalk, or else put forth to Handicraft  Trades. The Girls, which are the weaker Sex, and have been always less pro- vided for, to Read, Write, Sew, Raise Paste, Still, Dress, and what else may  qualifi e them for Services. The historical research of Amy Louise Erickson has likewise called  into question the cross-class applicability of the preference for boys, sug- gesting that procuring a male heir was primarily a concern of aristocrats  worried about passing down landed property and titles to male descend- ants. Erickson’s work has shown that for the lower and middling classes,  where titles and large amounts of landed property were not at stake, the  preference for boys, like arranged marriages, would have been signifi - cantly less prominent.65 Demographically, she has found that ‘prosecu- tions for infanticide yield no difference in the rate of girls and boys killed  at birth, perhaps because the reason for killing an infant was usually  illegitimacy’.66 Outside of the landed classes, an illegitimate boy was  just as much a problem for parents and parishes as an illegitimate girl.  In vestry minutes and other parish registers, whether children under the  parish’s wardship were boys or girls was of little material consequence.  The records rarely noted the biological sex of foundling children or the  orphans of deceased parishioners except for a few cases in which their  names were given. One reason for this omission was that abandoned  children were relatively anonymous unless the parents could be discov- ered. In one exceptional case, a mother who left her child on the Stepney  church porch left a note on ‘the breast of it, that it was a Christian sole  named Jane’, in consequence of which the clerk movingly records that  the parishioners ‘call her Jane’. The Stepney council agreed to provide  Jane with a nurse ‘for as small a charg as maybe’ and to provide her  with clothing, but what happened to the infant whose mother wanted to  give her a Christian name does not get recorded in the vestry minutes.67  Her fate was not uncommon; most foundlings appeared briefl y only to   disappear into historical obscurity. Middleton’s construction of legitimacy and infancy helps reinsert the  Janes of the world into the social fabric. Not infrequently, city comedies  rescue female characters by having them marry the fathers of their chil- dren, and Middleton uses this device in A Fair Quarrel, actually pushing  back the marriage ceremony to before the conception. As previously  noted, Master Russell’s greatest desire is to match his daughter Jane to  a wealthy suitor, to the exclusion of all other factors. He values neither  titles nor social position, and as a result favours a marriage between  Jane and the wealthy Cornish wrestler Chough. His thwarting of the  match between Jane and the socially superior but impoverished Fitzallen  HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   129 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="27">  130    The Girlhood of Shakespeare’s Sisters provokes a crisis because Jane and Fitzallen have secretly been married  and conceived a child, whom Jane bears and conceals with the help of a  physician and his sister Anne. Like many children in the early modern archives, the sex of the  character Jane’s baby is relatively inconsequential. The Dutch Nurse  carries the child on stage twice. In its fi rst appearance in Act 3, Scene 2,  the Physician and Jane give the child into the care of the Dutch Nurse,  passing the child off as the Physician’s and pretending that Jane is the  godmother. Then in Act 5, Scene 1, the Physician brings the child and  Nurse forward to disrupt the marriage ceremony between Jane and  Chough. He does so as revenge for Jane refusing his sexual advances  after he has helped conceal her pregnancy, and he produces the infant  as evidence that Jane is no longer a virgin. Chough and Jane’s father  interpret the child as absolute proof of Jane’s sexual activity, but at no  point do any of the characters ask the child’s sex; at stake are her sexual  continence and the child’s legitimacy, not its gender. That said, the Dutch Nurse, with her accent and foreign vocabulary,  reveals that the ‘bastard’ child (who turns out not to be a bastard) is a  girl. Noting with approval the child’s beloved status, the Nurse speaks  affectionately to her charge, calling it ‘my pretty frokin’ (3.2.14). From  the Dutch vrouwken, a diminutive of frow (woman) created by adding  ‘kin’, ‘frokin’ surreptitiously identifi es the babe-in-arms as female.68  Although a minor detail, her presence echoes the emphasis on father- daughter attachment in the larger play and helps shift the emphasis  away from kinship ties formed through legal and biological ties and  those formed through affection. As a tyrannical father, Russell hardly compares to other Jacobean  characters like Sir Alexander Wengrave in The Roaring Girl or Hermia’s  father in A Midsummer Night’s Dream. When the Physician interrupts  Jane’s marriage to Chough to confront her with her ‘bastard’ child,  Russell immediately overlooks her defi ance and takes steps to ensure  her marriage to Fitzallen, even before he knows the child is actually  Fitzallen’s daughter. Indeed, Jane and the other characters seem to fear  fatherly retribution (like that of Mercury in The Cobbler’s Prophecy),  but fi nd instead tender care and understanding (like that of Ru and Ina).  When Jane admits to her father, ‘it’s true, sir, I have a child’ (5.1.236),  his response sounds absolutely nothing like what Jane seems to have  expected. ‘Hast thou,’ he asks, ‘Well, wipe thine eyes, I’m a grandfather  then; / If all bastards were banished, the city would be thin / In the thick- est term-time’ (5.1.236–9). His general affection for his daughter and  desire to see her happy take precedence over his sense of fatherly rights;  even his earlier greed has been on her behalf rather than part of a plot  HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   130 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="28"> Female Infants and the Engendering of Humanity     131 to advance his own interests. Conveniently, the play has it both ways;  Fitzallen welcomes the child as his own because it is his own, mitigating  the threat that bastardy poses to the social order. However, the fact that  Russell’s consent was obtained before he learns the truth only heightens  the sense that the rigid moral precepts of Wilson’s play have no real  force in Middleton and Rowley’s fi ctional world. If A Fair Quarrel works against the sentiments expressed about  adultery and illegitimacy in The Cobbler’s Prophecy, Middleton goes  even further in A Chaste Maid in Cheapside, a play in which bastards  are not only beloved but desired. As the last of Middleton’s great city  comedies, Chaste Maid is the culmination of an authorial project aimed  at representing the urban middling class in all its grit and glory. Setting  the action in Cheapside, a London space associated with brothels and  thievery, Middleton dramatises a world in which chastity, marital fi del- ity and genealogical legitimacy are the exception rather than the rule.  Chaste Maid features no fewer than three on-stage infants, all of which  are illegitimate: the child of Touchwood Senior and a character identi- fi ed only as ‘Wench’, an infant abandoned in a basket of mutton, and  the child of Sir Walter Whorehound and Mistress Allwit. Within the  play’s framework, infants are the objects that knit together and disrupt  the sexual and social kinship networks of the characters. The level of  acceptance represented in Chaste Maid may be a little over the top and  at times farcical, but the play clearly imagines an early modern world in  which legitimacy and gender were valued differently in practice from in  theory. The three infants suggest that the biological sex of an infant was  important in securing its status as human, but even more important was  its social acceptance. With the exception of the courtship of Moll Yellowhammer by  Touchwood Junior, all of the other plots revolve around a crisis of repro- duction. In one, Master Allwit serves as a willing cuckold to Sir Walter  Whorehound because Sir Walter not only fathers the Allwit children  but fi nancially supports the Allwit household. In the other two plots,  one couple, Lord Oliver and Lady Kix, face a crisis of infertility, and  the other, Touchwood Senior and his wife, face a crisis of over-fertility.  The Kixes desperately want an heir, whereas the Touchwoods have been  driven into poverty through Touchwood Senior’s super-fertility. In both  cases, children are aligned with the family’s economic prosperity, either  via inheritance networks or through the using up of resources. The play  mirrors the overabundance of infants in the Touchwood household via  the overabundance of infants carried on the stage. For the most part, children in this play are not quite fully human;  they’re either conduits for land and money, like the Allwit children,  HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   131 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="29">  132    The Girlhood of Shakespeare’s Sisters or they’re animalistic and inhuman. In a scene that makes explicit the  close connection between children and animals, two promoters seek to  enforce the statutes forbidding the consumption of animal fl esh during  Lent. They do so selectively, depending on whose masters and mistresses  have offered them bribes. The corrupt promoters patrol the streets of  London in search of illicit meat-laden packages that they can confi scate  and consume themselves, in defi ance of the very statute they are charged  with upholding. Their corruption comes back to haunt them when they  take a basket from a woman who has concealed her illegitimate child  under a loin of mutton.69 Using the promoters’ greed to trick them  into commandeering the basket from her while she supposedly goes to  get proof that her mistress is sick and has a dispensation to enjoy the  mutton, she secures their promise to keep the basket until she returns.  Enthusiastically feeling what he initially believes to be a lamb’s head,  the second promoter is struck with rage upon discovering that the meat  he has promised to keep is in fact the woman’s baby. As in historical  records concerning abandoned children, which rarely noted the sex of  foundling children, the biological sex of the infant is not mentioned.  As an animal-like thing that circulates across the stage, the infant lies  outside both the legal boundaries of marriage and the affective ties of  kinship. Its biological sex is consequently left unspecifi ed. Keeping a boy  would be no less onerous to the promoters than keeping a girl. A similar incident, probably inspired by or inspiring of Middleton’s  scene with the promoters, occurs in John Fletcher’s The Chances.  Although it involves a boy child, the scene reveals the close association  between infants and objects and refl ects the general view of children as  fi nancial burdens that we see in Chaste Maid. When a woman mistakes  Don John for a man named Fabrizio with whom she has an appoint- ment, Don John seizes the opportunity to take control of the package  she seeks to hand off. When he re-enters a few scenes later, he reveals  that he has accepted not a valuable package, but a costly abandoned  child. In Act 1, Scene 5, Don John is crucially uninterested in the infant’s  biological sex. The child’s presentation as a child rather than a package  does not include the presentation of its gender. Not until Act 3, Scene 3  does the play reveal the infant to be a ‘brave Boy’ (3.3.53), a detail that  makes very little material difference within the play’s fi ctional narrative.  The child’s status as a boy enables his mother Constantia to identify him  as hers, but neither she nor any of the other characters are concerned  about the child’s biological sex per se. No sense of the child as a future  male emerges, probably because the play ends before he grows up.  The play neither stages him as a character in himself nor imagines his   transition from boy to man.

It is ‘a  lumpe got out of lazinesse’ that he addresses as ‘good white bread’ and a  ‘Ginger-bread’, one of a ‘beavy of these Butter prints’, one of ‘other mens  adulteries’ who will now cost Don John a good deal in charity (1.6.11,  26, 23, 29).70 In contrast to the promoters, however, he does not plan  to abandon the child and instead acknowledges his r esponsibility for it: . . . to leave it here were barbarous, And ten to one would kill it: a more sin Then his that got it: well, I will dispose on’t, And keep it, as they keep deaths heads in rings, To cry, memento to me; no more peeping. Now all the danger is to qualifi e The good old gentlewoman, at whose house we live, For she will fall upon me with a Catechisme Of foure houres long: I must endure all; For I will know this mother: —Come good wonder, Let you and I be jogging: your starv’d treble Will waken the rude watch else: (1.5.36–46) As I will show with the Allwit child in Chaste Maid, what enables the  food-like infant to go from being a mere object to a child (though not a  full character) is the willingness of the community to care for it. Unlike  the unfortunate foundling in Chaste Maid, this child will be taken in,  raised and eventually given a social and gender identity. It does not  happen within the play, but the eventual reconciliation of Constantia  with the Duke and their marriage point towards a future integration into  and participation in human relations. Until endowed with an individual identity and marked as human,  infants circulate on the stage either as objects of projected emotions or  as objects of exchange. The baby in the basket in Chaste Maid is in many  ways interchangeable with the other unsexed infant in the play, the child  whose mother describes it as the ‘workmanship’ of Touchwood Senior  (2.1.65).71 The same blankets could be used for both, and, as with the  promoters, the central focus is not on the child as a child but on the child  as an expensive piece of fl esh. Touchwood buys his way out of the situ- ation by offering the woman, identifi ed in the speech prefi x as ‘Wench’,  a lump sum to discharge his responsibility. In the process, he casts doubt  over whether the woman’s infant can be seen as fully human: ‘Do but in  courtesy, faith, wench, excuse me / Of this half yard of fl esh, in which I  think it wants / A nail or two’ (2.1.83–5). By intimating that the infant  has a bodily deformity, Touchwood Senior refuses initially to recognise  HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   133 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="31">  134    The Girlhood of Shakespeare’s Sisters the child as his because he refuses to recognise it as human. The irate  mother, however, insists that ‘it hath right shape, and all the nails it  should have’, but the infant never becomes unproblematically human.  The Wench reveals before she leaves the stage that Touchwood Senior is  the fi fth man who has paid her money to support the child, casting the  infant as a device that facilitates the circulation of money rather than as  a future human being. The only child in the play referred to as ‘she’ rather than ‘it’ is the  daughter of Sir Walter and Mistress Allwit, an infant whose place (albeit  illegitimate) within the play’s kinship network enables her to be imag- ined as a future human being. Whereas the other two infants could have  appeared identical on stage, the Allwit baby would probably have been  materially differentiated. Given the lavish nature of the christening, this  infant would most likely have been presented as wrapped in an expensive  bearing cloth. Although every bit as illegitimate as the other two infants,  this one occupies a legitimate space within the affective relationships  of the characters. Sir Walter seems genuinely proud of his offspring, so  much so that the willing cuckold Allwit congratulates him on having ‘a  goodly girl’, one that the wet nurse describes as superior to her older  brothers: ‘They’re pretty children both,’ she says, ‘but here’s a wench  / Will be a knocker’ (2.2.25–6). Tellingly, Allwit talks about this well- cared-for child as ‘she’: ‘She looks as if she had two thousand pound to  her portion / And run away with a tailor’ (2.2.13–14). Imagining the girl  as a future woman, Allwit invests her if not with humanity, at least with  the potential to become human. The lying-in scene featuring Mistress Allwit with her gossips in Chaste  Maid explicitly stages the conceptual difference between conceiving of  a child as ‘it’ and conceiving of a child as ‘she’, illustrating the peculiar  ability of infants to move back and forth between the two: 2 Gossip: Bring the child hither Nurse; how say you now Gossip, is’t not a chopping girl, so like the father? 3 Gossip: As if it had been spit out of his mouth, Eyed, nosed and browed as like a girl can be, Only indeed it has the mother’s mouth. (2.2.11–15) Although clearly identifying the infant as female by calling her a ‘girl’,  the two gossips resolutely fi gure the child as ‘it’. A moment later,  however, during a disagreement about whether the infant is large or  small, their rhetoric shifts and they begin to refer to the child as ‘her’,  a shift signalling that they are imagining the child as a ‘woman’ rather  than an infant: HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   134 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="32"> Female Infants and the Engendering of Humanity     135 3 Gossip: ’Tis a large child, she’s but a little woman. 1 Puritan: No believe me, a very spiny creature, but all heart, Well mettled, like the faithful to endure Her tribulation here, and raise up seed. (2.2.16–19) Not until the gossips begin to project a future adulthood for the infant do  their pronouns shift; they switch from ‘it’ to ‘she’ to represent the child as  a ‘little woman’ who will go on to become a big woman. In the process,  they manage to gender and anthropomorphise the female infant, even as  they simultaneously see her as a ‘creature’. Just as in Shakespeare and  Fletcher’s Henry VIII when the Old Lady takes advantage of the gender  ambiguity of infancy to label Elizabeth ‘a lovely boy’, the gossips reveal  the capacity for infants to move across the borders that mark off the  male from the female and the human from the not-yet human. We need further demographic and historical studies to know more  about early modern attitudes and practices, but in the imaginative space  of the Jacobean theatre, there is no question that a project was under  way to construct female infants as both desirable and, in some cases,  preferable to male infants. These plays counteract any tendency to  assume that the default sex of newborn children would have been imag- ined as male, and they also challenge our existing assumptions about the  relative values placed on girls and boys in early modern culture. These  plays offer alternatives to the kinship networks privileged under primo- geniture. Nonetheless, if achieving humanity depended upon having a  gender identity, gender was far from being a guarantor of humanity.  Given that women, like children, were often excluded from the status of  the fully human and associated with silence and animality, the acquisi- tion of gender placed these female infants in a complicated position; it  enabled them to occupy the space of the future speaking ‘I’, but that  space was one that required them to continue to negotiate their identities  as girls, damsels, wenches and women.

Anne Varty relates the story of a crying infant actor disrupting an 1867  performance of The Double Marriage. The child’s ill-timed screams ruined  Ellen Terry’s most dramatic moment in the play. See Varty, ‘The Rise  and Fall of the Victorian Stage Baby’, New Theatre Quarterly (2005),  pp. 218–19.  2. On the difference between early modern and realist theatres, see Alan  C. Dessen, Elizabethan Stage Conventions and Modern Interpreters  (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984) and Recovering  Shakespeare’s Theatrical Vocabulary (Cambridge: Cambridge University  Press, 1995).  3. Early modern audiences would also have been less likely to worry about  the ethics of child labour. Theatre historian Thomas Edgar Pemberton  has described the Victorian conundrum over staging infancy as follows:  ‘Babies are always dangerous elements in plays, and are far more likely to  provoke laughter than sympathy from the curiously mixed audiences that  will always be found within the walls of a theatre. If they are “real live”  babies, they are (poor little things) apt to cry at the wrong moments; if they  are dolls, they are absurdities.’ Quoted in Varty, ‘Rise and Fall’, p. 218. The  success with which many contemporary productions stage Shakespeare’s  plays without ‘real live’ babies suggests that the effi cacy of dolls depends  upon the skill of the performers.  4. See Varty for an account of the way these challenges, particularly concerns  over child labour, eventually led to ‘real live’ babies being replaced by  parodic adult impersonations of infancy on the Victorian stage.  5. The only exception that I have discovered in which a live infant was used  in early modern drama is a January 1565 performance at court of Sixtus  Birck’s Sapientia Solomonis that was put on for Queen Elizabeth and  the visiting Princess Cecelia of Sweden. The production was notable for  its lavish expense, including a payment to the woman who looked after  the child. See Elizabeth Rogers Payne (ed.), Sapientia Solomonis, Acted  Before the Queen by the Boys of Westminster School (New Haven: Yale  University Press, 1938). The performers were likely inspired to bring in the  live child because the play features the biblical episode where Solomon is  called upon to judge the true mother of an infant who has been exchanged  HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   137 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="35">  138    The Girlhood of Shakespeare’s Sisters for the dead child of another woman. For a critical discussion of the play,  see Michael Shapiro, ‘The Westminster Scholars’ Sapientia Solomonis as  Royal Gift Offering’, in Paul Menzer (ed.), Inside Shakespeare: Essays on  the Blackfriars Stage (Susquehanna: Susquehanna University Press, 2006),  pp. 118–31.  6. Sophie Oosterwijk explores the multiple kinds of props that the drama of  the Middle Ages may have used in ‘Of Mops and Muppets: The Ambiguous  Use of the Word “Mop” in the Towneley Shepherds Plays’, Notes and  Queries 44 (1997), pp. 169–71. W. L. Hildburgh recognises that dolls of  some kind must have had to be substituted for children and suggests that  the players used alabaster carvings. See his ‘English Alabaster Carvings  as Records of Medieval Religious Drama’, Archaologia 93 (1949), pp.  51–102. M. D. Anderson, on the other hand, points out that some form  of stuffed dummy must have been used in dramas featuring Herod, where  children were pierced with spears as part of the massacre of the innocents:  Drama and Imagery in English Medieval Churches (Cambridge: Cambridge  University Press, 1968), p. 18. One further indication of the options avail- able comes from the Livre du Régisseur from Mons, where a wooden  child was used to represent Herod’s infant son. See Oosterwijk, p. 170;  Hildburgh, p. 61; Anderson, p. 133. Early modern evidence is likewise  fairly scarce, but a translation by Barnabe Googe includes the detail that on  Christmas Day in Italy, ‘a woodden childe in clowtes is on the aultar set’  to represent the Christ Child.

Marjorie Garber offers an  important psychoanalytical account in Coming of Age in Shakespeare  (New York: Routledge, 1997), particularly for Marina and Perdita. 10. I am reluctant to draw any defi nitive conclusions from these statistics  because the sample is small enough that infants in lost plays could signifi - cantly change the picture. Moreover, in some cases the biological sex of the  represented infants was determined by historical personages, as in George  Peele’s Edward I, John Webster’s The Duchess of Malfi  and Thomas Drue’s  The Life of the Duchess of Suffolk. 11. I take my details about the correspondence between Shakespeare’s life and  the late plays, as well as between those and the Stuart royal family, from  David Bergeron, Shakespeare’s Romances and the Royal Family (Lawrence:  University of Kansas Press, 1985), pp. 5–6, p. 8, p. 10, pp. 38–9, p. 160. 12. Richard Wheeler offers a sophisticated refl ection on the possibilities for  including Shakespeare’s biographies in ‘Deaths in the Family: The Loss of  HIGGINBOTHAM 9780748655908 PRINT.indd   138 06/12/2012   16:18 </page> <page sequence="36"> Female Infants and the Engendering of Humanity     139 a Son and the Rise of Shakespearean Comedy’, Shakespeare Quarterly 51  (2000), pp. 127–53. What makes Wheeler’s integration of biography and  textual interpretation impressive is that he incorporates his knowledge of  Shakespeare’s life into sustained readings of Shakespeare’s comedies rather  than simply pointing out correspondences. 13. Both Wheeler and Stephen Greenblatt briefl y point to the possibility that  Mamillius refl ects Shakespeare’s lost son. See Wheeler, ‘Deaths in the  Family’, p. 153, and Greenblatt, Will in the World (New York: Norton,  2004), pp. 290–1. 14. Glynne Wickham offers one of the most sustained readings of the romances  as refl ective of contemporary politics, identifying various characters with  historical fi gures from the Stuart family.

By sexual differences, I mean to indicate bodily differences as they were  mediated through social and cultural representations. By gender differ- ences, I mean traits and behaviours constructed as belonging to girls and  boys and women and men. Although I am aware that recent theorists have  raised questions about whether a strict separation between sex and gender  can be maintained, I fi nd this separation to be useful for the discussion of  early modern infants because the social markers of gender that we have  come to take for granted were not then legible in infants. 43. Anne Buck argues that our impression of the widespread indeterminacy  of children’s sex in early modern paintings has been exaggerated by our  unfamiliarity with some of the more subtle gender markers of children’s  costume.

J. H. P. Pafford and Stephen Orgel, the editors of the Oxford and Arden  editions, cite as evidence the following line from Robert Greene’s James IV  (1598): ‘Whilst Hob your son, and Sib your nutbrowne childe’ (5.4.103).  As Pafford writes, ‘childe’ here ‘certainly means daughter’, and he further  points out, following C. T. Onions, that Shakespeare always uses ‘my child’  to refer to daughters rather than sons. As the author of Pandosto (1588),  on which Shakespeare’s play is based, Greene offers a particularly instruc- tive source. That Shakespeare’s ‘child’ appears closely with ‘bairn’, another  term from a regional dialect, makes it all the more likely that he is using  ‘child’ to mean ‘girl’. See The Winter’s Tale, ed. Stephen Orgel (Oxford:  Oxford University Press, 1996), n. 69, and The Winter’s Tale, ed. J. H.  P. Pafford (London: Thomas Nelson and Sons, 1999), n. 70. Orgel is fol- lowing the notes to Pafford’s 1963 edition. Pafford locates the dialect as  belonging to the Midlands and southwest of England. 49.

Sara Mendelson and Patricia Crawford have found examples of   seventeenth-century parents expressing similar sentiments. Thomas  Chichely, for example, wrote to his daughter upon the birth of a girl in  1671, ‘Although it be a girl that God hath sent . . . I remember a saying  of your Grandfather Russell who said in time it would [turn?] to a boy.’  Mendelson and Crawford cite two other examples of parents consoling  themselves for not having a boy by seeing the girl as evidence of fertil- ity: Hannah Brograve and Anne D’Ewes. See Mendelson and Crawford,  Women in Early Modern England, 1550–1720 (Oxford: Oxford University  Press, 1998), p. 81. 57. See Hugh Cunningham, Children and Childhood in Western Society since  1500 (New York: Longman, 1995), p. 41. As discussed in my introduction,  Cunningham’s defi nition of a middle-class ideology of childhood consists of  ‘a fi rm commitment to the view that children should be reared in families,  a conviction that the way childhood was spent was crucial in determining  the kind of adult that the child would become, and an increasing awareness  that childhood had rights and privileges of its own’. 58. Quoted in Thomas Middleton, A Chaste Maid in Cheapside, ed. Alan  Brissenden (London: A &amp; C Black, [1630] 2002), p. xiii. 59.

My attention was fi rst called to this fact by Sara Mendelson and Patricia  Crawford’s Women in Early Modern England. They suggest that the  institution of a single baptismal ceremony affi rmed the doctrine that the  soul had no biological sex, citing C. Peters, ‘Women and the English  Reformation’, unpublished paper, ‘Women, Text and History’ seminar,  Oxford, 15 May 1990. See their chapter on ‘Childhood and Adolescence’,  p. 81, n. 17.

For another example, see Thomas Dekker’s reference to ‘a little Frokin (one  of my Dutch runnawayes children)’ in his 1603 Wonderfull Yeare. The  editor of the New Mermaids edition claims that ‘frokin’ could be applied to  children of either sex, but Grzegorz Kleparski, who has made an extensive  study of early modern synonyms for ‘girl’, classifi es the term as defi nitively  gendered female. See his Theory and Practice of Historical Semantics: The  Case of Middle English and Early Modern English Synonyms of Girl/ Young Woman (Lublin: University Press of the Catholic University of  Lublin, 1997). My own opinion concurs with Kleparski’s. 69. This scene has obvious connections to The Second Shepherds’ Play from  the Towneley cycle, where Mak and his wife Gill attempt to disguise a  stolen sheep as their infant and, when discovered, claim he is a changeling  misshapen by fairies. Whereas Middleton’s promoters mistake a child for  a lamb (albeit a dead one), the shepherds in the medieval play initially  mistake a lamb for a child. As a point of interest, the Second Shepherd,  despite his distress over his lost sheep, takes the time to ask Mak if his child  is a boy (‘knave’). 70. This and all other references to this play are from John Beaumont and  John Fletcher, The Chances, in Fredson Bowers (ed.), The Dramatic Works  in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon, Vol. IV (Cambridge: Cambridge  University Press, 1979), pp. 541–645. 71.
