<plain_text><page sequence="1">A REVIEW OF THE ONTOLOGICAL ARGUMENT WILLIAM T. PAULLIN, JR., PH.D. Chicago In the present stage of speculative thought the traditional a priori arguments for the existence of God stand in more or less suspicion. That, for the most part, they have brought their disrepute upon themselves there can be no question. The exigencies of contro- versy, and especially the onslaught of Deism in the eighteenth cen- tury, have called forth from the defenders of the faith a wealth of proofs whose chief virtue at present lies in the oblivion which has overtaken them. We shall not disturb their repose; they were born in strife; let them now enjoy their peace. It is desirable, rather, to review from a historical and somewhat critical point of view only that a priori argument par excellence to which, in the course of a long tradition, the term "ontological" has fastened itself. Arising in the thought of Anselm, it exerted a positive influence upon subsequent philosophy until it was seriously discredited by Kant. By this argu- ment is understood the endeavor to reason immediately from God as concept to God as being. Rightly estimated, it belongs to a special province of that larger question of the relation of thought to being in general. Someone may wonder why, since the argument is indeed at present discredited, there should be any interest in the investigation of its history. It has gone the way of earthborn things. What is the use of attempting to free it from the limbo of shades ? Yet even a casual acquaintance with the history of philosophy suggests that no school of thought which long obtains among men is wholly in error. Truth, at best, is relative. There never was, nor can there be, absolute error. The superstructure of a thought may be unable to stand the test of time; it may have been shown even that the logical foundation upon which it stands has been defective and unsafe; but the builders of the thought nevertheless may have been swayed by motives that ought to endure despite the failure of their work. As the architect learns 53</page><page sequence="2">54 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY from the ruins of the past, so we may glean some meaning from the relics of a bygone proof. Instead, then, of attempting the thankless task of establishing the validity of the ontological argument, ask yourself its meaning. Reasoning which swayed such men as Des- cartes, Spinoza, Leibnitz, Wolff, Mendelssohn, to say nothing of minor minds, must at least have had some meaning. In the light of the history of the argument, it is well to ask what are the motives worthy of consideration which are conserved by it. Is the proof not merely invalid, but does it represent also an utter perversion of reason ? To this query you must give some answer. It has been questioned whether Anselm was in fact the originator of the argument with which his name is so closely interwoven. It is not necessary to show in detail that Plato had attained to his God in the realm of ideas in a not dissimilar way. Cleanthes, the Stoic, had reasoned from the mere ability to compare goods to the existence of a superlative good which could be described as an absolutely good and perfect being. Similar arguments were later employed by both Augustine and Boethius. For Augustine the knowledge of the existence of God is not in any sense dependent upon human reasoning. "Let it never seem to thee that God is known by reason, or that by reasoning he is to be brought into being."' The problem for Augus- tine was not whether God is, but what God is. Yet he urges that either truth is the highest good, and therefore God, or else there is a higher something which must be God. In any case, the concept of the highest good is one with the recognition of God's existence.2 Boethius held practically the same view. God is either the most complete good presupposed by all incomplete goods, or else there is a good beyond God. Reason demands a less than infinite series. A good beyond God, however, is unthinkable; therefore God as the highest good exists.3 In these arguments God is the universal in certain categories, and by reason of that fact exists. The thought is evidently Platonistic. Yet, since the arguments are not put forward as special pleas, they are to be regarded merely as casual outcroppings of Platonic doctrine.

His world, too, is a Platonic world, embracing not merely the world of sense-objects, but also a realm of ideas-i. e., universals-certainly no less real than objects of sense, but known through thought alone. This being so, the Monologium presents essentially the same kind of argument that is found in Augustine and Boethius. God is, because he is the highest good.4 To our modern way of thinking this savors of assertion rather than logic, and we rightfully demand a more formal proof. This Anselm presents in the Proslogium.s The argument is as follows: Declaring his belief that God is good, and that greater.good than God cannot be thought, he proceeds to ask whether the fool's assertion that there is no God brings about his nonexistence. No, says Anselm, for the fool understands what he hears, and it exists in his understanding even though he does not understand that it actually exists. There is here in Anselm's mind a clear distinction between existence in intellectu and existence in re, between the artist's concept and the finished painting. At any rate, the fool understands what is meant by "a good greater than which cannot be thought;" that at least exists in his understanding. But such a good cannot exist merely in the understanding, for there is also a good existent in fact, and the latter is surely "greater " than the former. Hence, the good greater than which cannot be thought exists in fact. Such a good cannot be thought of as nonexistent, for existence is a mark of excellence, which turns out to be the kind of greatness that Anselm has in mind. Therefore, such a good exists, but by definition this is God. Therefore, God exists. Estimates of the Anselmic argument sometimes assume that its author was naive enough to confuse existence in thought with existence in fact. The question is not at this moment the true meaning of either term. In face, however, of Anselm's explicit dis- tinction, it is not easy to see why such a critique should have become historic. The logical defect of the argument actually arises from the ambiguity of the word "greater." The historic objection was first given form by the monk Gaunilo in his Liber pro insipiente. He contended that there were conceptions of the imagination to which reality in no wise pertained; that experience made known certain 4 Chaps. 1-4. s Chaps. 2-4.</page><page sequence="4">56 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY false conceptions which could not be said even to represent reality; that the existence of God is beyond our capacity to understand, so that our conception of him is never adequate. There was none of these things that Anselm could not have granted. Let the objection take the form that by such an argument could be proved the actual existence of an imaginary object, such as an island "more excellent than all others," then Anselm becomes interested. He points out that he is concerned, not with a "more excellent," but with "that than which a more excellent cannot be conceived." The former is one among particulars; the latter is the universal which embraces all particulars. For this reason, Gaunilo's idea of an island does not involve existence. Particulars are known through the senses. The idea of God does involve existence, because the universal is per se real. God being the summum bonum, he who thinks this universal must therefore know God's existence.6 The validity of Anselm's position rests upon the acceptance of his Platonic theory of knowledge. Granted that, he may easily say: "I believe that this argument cannot be invalidated by the validity of any objection."' Even Ueberweg, though denying any necessary connection between realism and Anselm's argument, concedes that the defect which he discovers in the argument "was peculiarly natural in connection with the form of realism held by Anselm."' The case may be stated more strongly. "When one makes it clear that this demonstration is a veritable sophistry, he will have jeopardized the entire system of the doctor."9 This by no means exempts Anselm's thought from criticism, but it does imply that Anselm had at least a justification for his method of attack upon the problem. If one can think of God, meaning by God the highest universal good, that thought must involve existence of its subject on the basis of the Anselmic realism. A change in the theory of knowledge would demand a restatement of the argument and involve the ultimate realization of its futility. This would hold true even for realism of the Aristotelian type. 6 Cf. Liber apologeticus adversus respondentem pro insipiente. 7 Ibid., chap.

The Aristotelians Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas, the critic Duns Scotus, and the nominalist William of Occam, are among those who naturally rejected the argument. Of them Thomas may be taken as a type. His objectionslo follow in spirit those of Gaunilo. He recognizes as true that some proposi- tions do involve the attribute, or predicate, as part of the nature of the subject, and are consequently known per se to all. Evidently this is characteristic of identical propositions. It is also true of such propositions as, "Man is an animal." Here both the terms are empirically known. Is this the case with the proposition, "God exists" ? Does the notion " God" include "exists" ? Only, Thomas says, on condition that we know what God is. This is never a matter of immediate knowledge, but a matter of demonstration from physical effects. As to the name "God," it is evident that it can be under- stood in various senses. Even were it understood in one sense, that understanding of it need not involve its existence. To say that one cannot think the nonexistence of God is untrue; the fool does think it. More specifically Thomas objects: (i) that it is not necessary to accept Anselm's definition of God; some make their God material and equivalent to the world; (2) that, granting the concept, one can- not reason to God's existence in the realm of reality; all that one can consistently affirm is that God exists in the understanding, which is no more than the atheist would grant; (3) that the proposition that that which cannot be thought not to be is greater than that which can be so thought, is invalid; for the latter may be thought not to be, not because of a deficiency in the being, but because of some defect in our faculties. Aquinas concludes that God may be reasoned to only on a posteriori grounds; he may not be known by cognition, but as the cause of cognition, the one "in whom all things are known."" The most telling of these objections is the first. Anselm did fail to show that God must be thought in his terms. Leibnitz urged the same objection against the Cartesian definition. Anselm would have replied, no doubt, that a merely mechanical God is no God, 1o Summa theologica, Pars I, quaes. 2, art. i. I' Cf. with the Summa his Summae de veritate catholicae fidei contra gentiles, Book I, chaps. io, 1.</page><page sequence="6">58 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY because he is not a moral being essentially; that the marks of his own definition were alone adequate to define the One in whom we ought to believe; that whoever had understanding could not fail to catch the import of such a definition, and that he asked no more to be granted to establish his position. It is worthy of passing note that Aquinas is not unwilling to regard the knowledge of God's existence as a first truth, if it be considered so merely in relation to ourselves." This is in accord with his general contention for the lack of finality in our rational knowledge of God. Meanwhile the argument did not lack defenders. There is some evidence to show that it was still taught in some of the Jesuit schools five centuries after Anselm. It was in this way, doubtless, that Descartes first became acquainted with it and was led to incorporate it into his own system. Recall the completeness of the Cartesian doubt; everything was called into question except the doubt itself. Now, there never was a skeptic who had less actual desire to doubt than had Descartes. Above all, he was no moral hero; he had no desire to be enrolled among the martyrs. When his former teachers did not accept his doctrines, he was grieved. In 1624 Parliament forbade, under penalty of death, the declaration of any principles which clashed with the old and tried authors, or the institution of any disputation other than those sanctioned by the theological faculty. Descartes, a few years later, found a foreign climate more congenial than that of Paris. Even then he actually suppressed one of his manuscripts, De mundo, lest it might bring him into conflict with the church.'3 Descartes, then, was anxious not to doubt. Of this anxiety was begotten his famous maxim: "Cogito, ergo sum." Now, apparently this bases his system upon the certitude of mere thought; but one need not read far into the system to find that this supposed basis was abandoned by him for another. This other basis was the cer- titude of the existence of God. Since, however, Descartes had already concluded that the only certitude he could have must be in thought, it was inevitable that he should come to regard the ontological argu- 12 Summa theologica, Pars I, quaes. 2, art. I, ad tertium. 13 Letter to R. P. Mersenne, (Euvres de Descartes, Vol. VI, pp. 236 if. (Cousin's edition.)</page><page sequence="7">THE ONTOLOGICAL ARGUMENT 59 ment as of great worth. If God could be shown to be a proved fact, doubt would be dispelled more quickly than a morning mist. In this situation germinated the dogmatic tradition which culminated in Leibnitz and Wolff. Descartes assumes that the test of reality in an idea is clarity and vividness. Modern psychological analysis would not fully admit this; witness the facts of dream-life. Yet, accepting this criterion, Descartes finds in himself as an "innate" idea a very clear and distinct notion of a being supremely perfect and infinite. Hence this being exists. Someone, he realizes, will object- that existence and essence are distinct from each other. By "essence" Descartes here means practically what we understand by "concept." But, he continues, just as in a triangle you cannot separate the equality of the angles to two right angles from the concept of a triangle, so exist- ence belongs to the concept of God. I cannot think a nonexistent God; it is the very existence of God that affords my idea of God.'4 Of course, it is quite clear that Descartes has here shifted his ground. The question of the origin of the idea is not at all a part of the onto- logical argument. Descartes denied the identity of his argument with that of Anselm. Anselm's proof, he said, turned merely upon the definition of the word "God," while his own rested upon the analysis of a clear and distinct idea.'5 That analysis shows that existence necessarily belongs to the very nature of God as such, so that he is not dealing with a mere "essence" -i. e., a concept-or a mere "form"--i. e., an idea of the imagination. Into Descartes' reasoning the question of the validity of his idea of God does not enter. Yet behind his whole argument lies a theory of the causation of ideas.'6 The mere presence of a clear and distinct idea is held to imply the existence of an objective cause. At bottom, Descartes' theory of the cognition of God does not differ from his theory of the cognition of any objective reality. His psychology has become antiquated, and, through its rejection, the whole argument has been impaired. The situation is akin to that which we discovered in the case of Anselm. If you accept their epistemologies, you cannot attack their conclusions. 14 Meditations, V; Principles, I, pp. Part I, sec. 14 ff. 's (Euvres, Vol. I, p. 389- z6 Meditations, III.</page><page sequence="8">60 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY Spinoza accepts the Cartesian argument with such modifications as are necessitated by his monistic point of view. God is a "sub- stance consisting of infinite attributes,""7 an attribute being "that which the intellect perceives of substance."'8 A substance is "that which is in itself, and is conceived through itself;"19 and can, there- fore, be immediately conceived without the aid of a syllogism. Hence, it pertains to the nature of substances to exist,20 the criterion of exist- ence, as with Descartes, being the clarity and vividness of the idea. To doubt existence in such a case is to say that one has a true idea of which he does not know whether it be true or false."2 Since attributes are proportioned to reality, God, being the substance consisting of infinite attributes each expressing eternal and infinite essence, necessarily exists." He bases this conclusion in part upon the inconceivability of God's nonexistence; otherwise there would be a nonexistent substance, a contradiction in terms. Inability to exist is impotence, but to suppose such impotence in God is to involve oneself in an absurdity which exalts the finite above God. Either nothing exists, or else God necessarily exists. Experience shows the former to be untrue; but, if anything exists, God must exist, for all existence must have its ground. God is the most real; hence he has the most power to exist and must exist per se. A connected statement of Spinoza's position is to be found in his Korte Verhand- eling van God.23 Everything of which we know clearly and dis- tinctly that it belongs to the nature of a thing (by "nature" is meant that through which a thing is what it is), that can truly be maintained of the thing. Now, existence belongs to the nature of God, as we clearly and plainly recognize. Therefore, God exists. In this treatise Spinoza also insists that an idea and a thing are distinct, and that his argument does not confuse the two. The note in which he brings this out, however, is very obscure and in its details unin- telligible. There is one thing connected with Spinoza's argument that comes out more clearly than in either that of Anselm or that of Descartes. That is the important part played by definition. All three of these x7 Ethices, Pars I, Def. VI. x8 Ibid., Def. IV. io Ibid., Def. III. 20 Ibid., Prop. VII. 21 Ibid., Prop. VIII. 22 Ibid., Prop.

Their general form of syllogism is: If I have an idea of a God of which existence is a mark, then that God exists. But I do have such an idea. Therefore, God exists. Spinoza does not seem absolutely sure of his grounds, for he fears that "many persons will, perhaps, not be able to see the force of this demonstration.''24 If, however, one accepts the canon that per- fection establishes the existence of a thing, then, to quote Spinoza, it is true that "of no existence can we be more sure than of the exist- ence of the being absolutely infinite or perfect, i. e., God." The question remains unanswered as to whether one must accept the presupposed definition. Spinoza does look toward it in his endeavor to cast his whole argument into mathematical form, vainly hoping to secure thereby mathematical validity and necessity. To Leibnitz this lack of mathematical precision proved to be especially deplorable. He would admit the validity of the proof upon one condition; namely, that the possibility of the idea of God could be established.25 Mathematical definitions, upon Leibnitz's theory, must be shown to correspond to reality. Hence, he urged that "we cannot safely use definitions before knowing that they are real," the test of reality being a particular kind of clearness, freedom from contradictions. He regarded the argument as incomplete, merely hypothetical in form. For its completion there was required a demonstration that God is possible, but granted that a necessary being is possible, it necessarily exists, and "if necessary being does not exist, there is no being possible.'"26 Anselm had felt no obligation to prove the existence of God as possible, because by his theory of knowledge the denial of the pos- sibility of a universal would be absurd. The mere fact of particulars existing made his universal a possibility. Neither did Descartes raise the question; for the idea of God being, in his view, innate, it would be idle to inquire as to its possibility. Leibnitz, it is true, 24 Ethices, Part I, Prop. XI, schol. 25 Werke (Gerhardt's edition), Vol. IV, p. 358. 26 Werke, Vol. IV, p.p 405, 406.</page><page sequence="10">62 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY also regarded the idea of God as innate, but he was confronted with the necessity of overcoming a cleft between his physics and his theology. A consistent monadology would have been materialistic, excluding God. Yet Leibnitz felt the press of theological need. Consequently, he made use of the tried arguments, and even invented a new and now abandoned argument for the existence of God. Since his physics seemingly tended toward a suspicion that there was no need for God, he was compelled to lay stress upon the category of possibility in order to establish his theology. Now, if the idea of God is not contradictory, God is possible.27 If it is contradictory, it must be so because God's perfections are incompatible with each other; i. e., that the perfections A and B cannot be found in one subject. Leibnitz defines a perfection as incapable of analysis. A and B as perfections are ultimate and, being incapable of analysis, cannot be shown to be incompatible. But A and B are any perfections. There- fore, all perfections are compatible. God, having all perfections, consequently exists.28 The above proof may be supplemented by a "proof of the existence of God from his essence."29 Having defined possible existence as the possibility of a thing, he claims that this possibility is inseparable from the essence of a thing. It is true of God, as of all things, that if one can think him, it is possible that he exists. But, in the case of God, the essence and actual existence are inseparable. Therefore, if God may exist, he does exist. It remains only to show that God's essence is such that existence actually belongs to him. It is admitted, by definition, that the essence of God and the highest perfection are inseparable. But the highest perfection can exclude no perfection, and existence is certainly a perfection. Hence, God's essence does include actual existence. Leibnitz comes to the same goal in another way. If God be defined as a necessary being, then it is self-evident that his essence involves the necessity of existing. The idea of God, therefore, involves existence, if the idea contains no contradiction; i. e., if it is possible. But its possibility has already been shown. The ordinary man has a just suspicion of all such arguments, 27 Ibid., Vol. VI, p. 614 ("Monadology," sec. 45). 28 Ibid., Vol. VII, pp. 261, 262. 20 Cf. Stein, Leibnitz und Spinoza, Beilage VII.</page><page sequence="11">THE ONTOLOGICAL ARGUMENT 63 because, as Leibnitz urged against Descartes' proof, they cover the ground too quickly. In fact Leibnitz only buried the difficulty a little deeper under the ambiguity of "possibility." Yet the Leib- nitzian-Wolffian school showed a keener appreciation of the part to be played by definitions. They uncovered the fact that their predecessors had treated existence as a perfection among the perfec- tions of a most perfect being. If their notion of God be accepted, then analysis of that concept is bound to establish existence. This is the nervus probandi. Does analysis of any concept point to exist- ence as a necessary element of the concept ? If it does not do so in other cases, why should it do so in the given case, God ? Are not the ideas of our dream-life of the same sort as those of our moments of conscious perception ? What is the distinction between the realm of fancy and the realm of the real, between the true and the false ? In some sense, "real" means a reference to an objective world. Hence, the reality of any concept seems to be attained by adding something to a concept rather than by mere dissection of the concept, by synthesis instead of by analysis. This was the position taken by Kant in his famous critique of the ontological argument, a result that had been foreshadowed in his Einzig migliche Beweisgrund zu einer Demonstration des Daseins Gottes,30 which had been published eighteen years before the Kritik der reinen Vernunft. He had then denied that the existence of a thing is to be regarded as a predicate of the thing. At that time, still dreaming his dogmatic dreams, he believed in the possibility of an a priori proof of the existence of God, but in his master-work he denied the possibility of any logical proof for God. The essence of this denial rests in the reduction of all proofs to some form of the ontological, and, then, denying in toto the validity of the latter. Now, if the final test of reality is to be absolute data of sensations, for the idea of God there can be no data; it is a construction in thought. This may not mean that God does not exist, but if he does exist, it can only be as out of relation to human intellect. You may have an idea of God, but you can have no concept of him, since concepts pre- suppose a sensualistic basis. Yet without concepts there is no knowl- edge. When, then, one speaks of the necessity of such an idea, 30 Op. cit., Part III, 2.</page><page sequence="12">64 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY the necessity must be always a subjective necessity. In this idea, it is true, you cannot refuse to think the predicate without affecting the subject, but you are not at all obliged to think the subject; e. g., in the judgment, "God as a necessary being exists," you may refuse absolutely to entertain the thought. Even were this not possible, the argument is in no wise improved, for existence is a synthetic principle, to find which one must always go outside of his concept. Hence, even if one denies the existence of God, that does not affeet the idea of God. "Logical" predicates are to be distinguished from "real" predicates, according to Kant's argument. Yet among these real predicates he does not include being. The only method he knows whereby one can learn of being is a posteriori, not a priori; through data of the senses, and not through the mere activities of thought. Hence, the idea of "absolute being" does not give us any knowledge of existence.3~ Kant would grant that it is scientifically possible for God to exist, but it would be as a Ding an sich, of whose actual existence we neither know nor can know. For him, as for Leibnitz, possibility is evidenced by the lack of contradictory elements. Yet, unlike Leibnitz, this lack of contradiction must be found, not merely within the concept or notion, but within the sphere of experience as well. Nor does he regard the possibility of God's existence as establishing that existence. Nor can possibility be established by a priori arguments; somewhere there must be an appeal to experience. Kant, further, would deny the applicability of Spinoza's mathematical method for the discovery of transcendent truth; i. e., truth in an extra-empirical realm. Mathe- matics is a priori in method, while the question of existence is decided only through reference to empirical data. The Cartesian argument Kant would regard as lost labor. He compares the Cartesian logic to a merchant who thinks to enrich himself by adding ciphers to the left of the sum-totals of his accounts. As for Anselm, his argument was too obsolete in its form for Kant's notice. It may be added, too, that Kant's philosophical instinct did not sharpen his historic interest. His knowledge of the history of philosophy was, at best, restricted. It could be shown that Kant's so-called moral argument for God, which enables the postulation of a God whose business it is to pro- 3' Kritik der reinen Vernunft, B, pp. 595-670.</page><page sequence="13">THE ONTOLOGICAL ARGUMENT 65 portion reward to desert, in fact involves ontology just as much as does the cosmological or the teleological argument. On a Kantiah basis consistency would afford no avenue of escape from the eternal treadmill of subjectivism. No Ding an sich can remain in any system, if by a Ding an sich we mean, as Kant often does mean, an extra- empirical something, or somewhat, within the field of experience. Evidently this is a contradiction in terms. Our sphere of discourse is never anything but the field of experience, so that in the Kantian doctrine contradiction is unavoidable. The outcome is clear: either no God, or else a rejection of the system in whole or in part, or else a contradiction in thought. The last stultifies reason; the first does not satisfy human experience; the possibility of modifying the system alone remains. We will not now follow the post-Kantian develop- ment, but it is of interest to recall that Hegel, rejecting the Ding an sich, found God, not outside of nature, but in nature; not transcendent, but immanent. Returning in spirit to Anselm, he once more makes God the highest universal-i. e., the Absolute-and on a priori grounds reaffirms the existence of God. Consciously he rejected Kant's criticism, and shrewdly observed that Kant had said nothing more than Gaunilo had said seven centuries before, nothing that Anselm had not fully anticipated. To Hegel, then, God is implied a priorily in all existence as the reconciler of all contradictory elements in our thinking. He is not identical with the contradictions, because he is the Absolute. He is existent, for he is ever overcoming his sub- jectivity and realizing himself.32 Thus, in a sense, the argument has completed its cycle. As modestly held by some of its present-day advocates, the washing of the grime of ages from its face has so far altered it as to make its connection with the past difficult of recognition. No one, at least, would be bold enough to present it in any pre-Kantian sense. Yet even today the argument abides with us as an alluring problem. Perhaps Kant's objections are influencing the wider circle, so that the very name "ontological" remains in disgrace. What is to be our own estimate of the situation ? Ought one to follow Kant, or Hegel, or shall he be independent of both ? Cer- 32 Hegel, Philosophy of Religion,Vol. III, pp. 360 ff. (translated in the "Foreign Philosophical Library").</page><page sequence="14">66 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY tainly we cannot accept Kant's Ding an sich; but with the rejection of it his critique of the ontological argument fails, because there is then left no reality per se to act as a touchstone of the existent. There are, however, many reasons why we should concur in his dis- trust of the argument. The proof in question does lack a certain reference to sensuous data that in some wise ordinarily constitutes our criterion of existence. "Is this a dagger which I see before me ?" cries the frenzied Macbeth. The sane man need not long seek a satisfying answer. This present experience would be referred to a whole of experience, and the prob- lem would be solved under the guidance of the law of contradiction. It must be admitted that in the case of God we cannot see, we cannot hear, we cannot handle. He does not come into the field of sensuous experience. The problem seems complicated because there can be no appeal to the ordinary data of knowledge. But long experience has taught us the indefiniteness of merely subjective criteria. Logical error is always a possibility and complicates the ordinary illusions of the senses. Assuming a subjective criterion, it is true, as Descartes said, that we cannot prove that at this given moment we are awake and not dreaming. Our criterion must be found outside of the present experience, not in the mental content of the moment, but in a life-history. Were the argument valid, the most it could prove would be a universal as existent being. Such a universal, whatever it might be, would not be the most perfect, but the most insignificant, of beings, possessing all qualities only because it possesses none of them. As we have widened the extension of the concept, we have tended to rob it of intension. Humanity is less significant than men. Imagination is active in the most prosaic minds. Modern psy- chology is proving this in manifold ways. We perceive what we apperceive. Where does perception begin, and where does it end ? The fact of apperception, call it what you will, is established; but who will define the meaning of the fact ? There is lacking a clear and definite distinction between the real and the imaginary. How, then, shall we assure ourselves that a given concept, however plausible, really does exist? The case may be comparatively simple with mere figments of the imagination, but is it so simple as one approaches</page><page sequence="15">THE ONTOLOGICAL ARGUMENT 67 the border-line between fact and fancy ? Is God a fact, or a fancy ? Who, upon the mere testimony of speculative thought, would venture to say? We know that there is always a tendency to hypostatize the unclear thought. Thus, "matter"-e. g., Locke's "I-know-not- what"- or "soul" as immaterial substance have, in the past, played an important r61le in philosophical thinking. Before keen criticism such concepts have been unmasked. May not the ontological argu- ment be merely another example of this hypostatizing tendency? Even though the logic seem valid, the ground must be re-examined to make sure that at some unexpected point error has not found a weak place in reason's armor. In general, it is only too apparent that the argument urges us to grant beforehand all that it is worth while to prove, and then we are expected to wonder at its dazzling success in proving the unexpected so easily. One is reminded of that automaton exhibited before wondering audiences. The audience is permitted to examine it; behold, its skin is waxen, and the figure bears every mark of a mechani- cal construction. Yet its movements are wondrously lifelike for an automaton. The audience marvels until, at the proper point in the program, it is discovered that the automaton is a living person skil- fully disguised; it never was an automaton. More than this, the futility of so-called theistic arguments is being borne in upon us with increasing force. We are ready to confess that speculation can never tell us what God per se is. Nor does the confession disturb us. To borrow Clifford's simile, there may be a wonderful peacock on the other side of the moon, but of what interest is that to me ? In a word, we are coming more and more to ask, not what God per se is, but what does he mean for us. How shall we estimate him in our lives ? That is, the practical interest is overshadowing the merely speculative. Shall we then say that the argument has no interest for us ? Per se it may have none; but may there not be motives involved in it that are worthy of conservation ? In the first place, the argument sug- gests that if there be a God, he must be definable. One may borrow Kant's own thought and say that reason must be able to answer the questions that it propounds. God is a problem for which there must be some answer, even though that answer be found to involve an</page><page sequence="16">68 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY imaginary quantity. One is tempted immediately to object to the possibility of knowing the infinite. In a given experience, or in a finite series of experiences, it is true that knowledge can never trans- gress limitations; but with that we are not now concerned. To say that God is, when we do not know what God is, can mean nothing for human life. By no just logic can we assume that God is, and then reason to what God is. The process must be reversed. In the last analysis, our existential judgments will prove to be value-judgments. If God has no meaning for us, then for us God does not exist and must be excluded from our universe of discourse. But if God does mean something to us, then he is definable, and, being definable, he exists. In what sense this is true remains to be shown. By "definition" we do not mean a mere formula of words divorced from experience. Definition is possible only in terms of experience, and, strictly speaking, is applicable only to things in experience. But that which in this sense is definable must exist. Gaunilo touched the nerve of the whole issue when, distinguishing the conceivable from the intelligible, he declared that "unreal objects are unintel- ligible."33 Other test of existence we have none; if God exists, even he cannot escape it. Positively, then, what is meant by "definition" ? A definition marks out the limits of a concept; but to mark out the limits of a concept is to relate it to other and known concepts. In other words, a definition gives to a concept its locus in the field of experience. The formula of words is the accident and not the essence of definition. When we speak of defining God, we simply mean that to our notion of God we are able to assign a place in experience. This is the corollary to the demand that our God must have a meaning for us. Unless God can be given such a locus in experience, there is no God. If God must be definable, and if definition is to mean, not a formula of words, but the locating of a concept in experience, it is evident that much will depend upon the point of view from which experience is oriented. It is not possible that this point of view should be absolute. It is, in fact, relative to ourselves; God is to have meaning for us. We are the judges of significance. That is to say that we alone are competent to say what that point of view shall be. The exact point 33Liber pro insipiente, chap. 7.</page><page sequence="17">THE ONTOLOGICAL ARGUMENT 69 of view will be a matter of personal choice, but the choice, once made, will be determinant of the entire structure of one's thinking. Just as one may arbitrarily make his geometrical world Euclidian or non- Euclidian, so one is at liberty to orient his thinking as he will, pro- vided that he does not seek his point of orientation outside of the general field of experience. To do that he must grant the validity of the extra-empirical. We conclude that definition is not some- thing forced upon us from without, but is the product of our own activities. The place of God in the field of experience, therefore, is to be determined by us and not jor us. In this sense, every definition of God must be a priori and not a posteriori. If, then, God be definable, and if this definition is a priori, again we are face to face with the question of the relation of this definition to existence. Already you are saying that a definition, even in the present sense of it, cannot be divorced from experience. This must be granted. Experience, however, is used in a twofold sense. It may mean the sum-total of the ever-changing phenomena of con- sciousness as they are being worked out into an organic whole, or it may mean some sensuous element of this broad experience. Now, it is clear to everyone that God cannot be an object of experience in this latter sense. Hence he is not real as such objects are real. Yet no one would pretend that that broader sense of experience is identical with the sum-total of cognitions. Volitions, emotions, are also factors in experience. Viewed genetically, this field of experience is inchoate, undefined, and lacking organization. All of that is a logically later accretion. Closer psychological analysis leads to the recognition that we are the organizers of our own experience. Our psychological processes are forever classifying the data which they discover at hand. In the method of classifying we are bound by no law save our own choice. Two persons developing, seemingly, in the same environment do not live in the same world. Each one, classifying his data, constructs his own world, and determines by his choice the kind of a world it is to be. From a speculative point of view, one classification is as good as another, the Ptolemaic world as good as the Copernican; it is only practical interests that can decide. Whether, then, our classification of data-that is to say, our world</page><page sequence="18">70 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY -be true-i. e., real-can be ascertained only by a reference to how this world of experience behaves toward us, and how we may behave toward it. Meaning, the value for us, in the case of any content of experience, or even of the whole of experience, is accordingly to be understood as practical rather than as theoretical. Our world can have no other sort of significance, but it is precisely this meaning that gives us warrant in reasoning to an existent. With respect to the problem of God, it has been pointed out that if God be a reality, he must have some locus in experience; otherwise he has no meaning. The fact that God is in no wise a datum of sensuous experience seemed to widen the breach between any notion of God that we may have and his reality. It would seem that there are only two avenues open. Either, so far as we know, there is no God, or, at best, he is merely an hypothetical being. Neither horn of the dilemma affords the theist consolation. God's existence cannot be demonstrated. Yet this truth needs supplementation. Existence is not to be established theoretically, but practically. From a theoretical point of view, we are justified in constructing for ourselves either of two types of a universe. In our world there may be a God, or that world may be completely atheistic. Either theory can explain the facts. If in our own world there is a God, it is because we have put him in it, and the kind of God he will be depends upon the kind of men we are. Inevitably our conception of him will be, in some wise, anthropomorphic. It is partly true that such a God is a God in our thought, but an extra-mental God can have no place in the field of discourse universal. The criterion of the existence of such a God will be found in the sphere of practice: how may we behave toward our theistic universe and how will it behave toward us ? Practicality is, consequently, the final test of our theory. Apart from empirical confirmation our a priori reasoning is of no value. Suppose, however, that we do so assure ourselves of the actual existence of the world we have constructed. By the same reasoning, you say, the materialist becomes satisfied of the existence of his godless world. To him it has meaning; he may look upon its behavior with complacency and behave toward it benignly. More no man can desire. This is an illustration merely of how each man's</page><page sequence="19">THE ONTOLOGICAL ARGUMENT 71 world reflects his own character. Between these apparently equally true and real worlds, between an existent and a nonexistent God, who shall decide? There is no final arbiter but experience. True, the individual may err in his interpretation of experiences; yet we do not move in an egoistic realm. A man may claim the right to maintain that the ego is the All, but he who acts upon that premise commits not merely intellectual but practical suicide. Man is a social being, and not only may but must call upon the experience of his neighbors, of the race, of humanity. In the collective force of human choices, expressing themselves as the experience of humanity, experience approaches apodicticity. Yet until humanity shall have lived through the last of infinite generations, no one dare say that beyond a peradventure God must exist, nor will he be able to silence the voice of the atheist. When, however, one turns to his own indi- vidual experiences, and notes what God means to him, not in his mere life-fancies, but in his everyday practice, he finds nothing in the field of experience more real than him. The true value, therefore, of the ontological argument rests in the attention that it invites to the a priori, definitive element in our knowledge of God; but the argument fails of validity in so far as it wholly divorces reason from experience. There is no need to regard the a priori element just mentioned as something antecedent to experience. Both it and the sensuous, a posteriori element in our knowledge of God are abstractions from the whole of experience. While, therefore, we reject the ontological argument, we answer our original query by affirming that the reasoning has in it some motives worthy of appreciation.</page></plain_text>
