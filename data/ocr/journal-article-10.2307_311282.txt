They play an especially significant role in the Iliad where, I shall show, they illuminate major themes of the poem as a whole. In the passage from the Poetics quoted above we see that Aristotle recognizes two distinct forms of comedy: (1) 6 "y6o;, a primitive level of comic insult or abuse and (2) the dramatic representation of rbr ye- ,oifov, a more mature and significant type of comedy.2 Aristotle defines -ro yekXoov (Poetics 1449a34-35) as a d~pZT1d t g'Ka a oao; which is &amp;dw'i6tvov Kai o' Upaprto6v. While examples of 6 N6dyo; abound throughout the Iliad in confrontation among human heroes and in disputes among the gods, the more complex and mature form of comedy involving the dramatic representation of rbo yEXoiov is found principally in two subplots. one of these involves Hera's crafty seduc- tion of Zeus in Book 14, and the other relates to the idiosyncratic behavior of Paris who ostentatiously appears in front of the Trojan army but immediately flees in stark terror at the sight of Menelaos, who laughs merrily after superficially wounding Diomedes in the foot, and who turns, with adolescent fervor, to making love to Helen after escap- ing from the explosive wrath of her aggrieved husband. In this paper I plan to analyze these examples of -ro yeXoiov and determine the contri- bution they make to the overall theme of the Iliad. The central episode of Book 14 (153-351) is an anthropomorphic escapade in seduction in which Hera craftily, but only temporarily, removes Zeus from the control of the war. We find to yEkoitov in abundance in this passage for there is a significant amount of divine aoaxo; and ai'gprTga in the way in which Hera manipulates Aphro- dite and Sleep and enticingly offers her body to an increasingly lecherous Zeus. Moreover, both the a&amp;pprTgia and the aaXoo; of the 2 For the difference between 6 0v6yo; and t6 yEoitov see the comments of I. Bywater, Aristotle on the Art of Poetry (Oxford 1909) and D. W. Lucas, Aristotle: Poetics (Oxford 1968) at 1448b37. I. M. Hohendahl-Zoetelief (above, n. 1) 37-74 provides a very detailed survey of "verbal abuse" in Homer. See also G. Nagy (above, n. 1) for an impor- tant connection between the category of blame poetry and comic abuse. He makes expli- cit application of Aristotelian comic doctrine to Homer at 253-255 and at 256 comments: "Again we may restate: blame poetry has a potential for the comic element, and comedy formalizes this element of blame poetry. But blame poetry itself is more inclusive and thus cannot be equated with comedy. Blame poetry can be serious as well as comic; it can condemn as well as ridicule."</page><page sequence="3">T6 yeXoiov in the Iliad 49 gods in this scene result in no pain or destruction on the divine level although the consequences for human beings are quite different. In this scene Hera moves effectively to isolate Zeus, at least tem- porarily, from the war by arousing his strong sexual desires. She accomplishes this, first, by adorning herself with the most alluring clothing and jewelry she possesses; and, next, by obtaining, on false pretenses, the KEOTbV ltiVTa rnotuKov of Aphrodite so that she can control the cptMh6TrI iai i'itEpov by which the goddess of love exer- cises mastery over both mortals and immortals. She then further insures the success of her maneuver by bribing Sleep to intervene after the seduction and disable Zeus for an extended period of time. All of this leads to the climactic encounter between Hera and Zeus at 292-351. As Hera appears on Mt. Ida, seductively attired and in possession of the potent igla of Aphrodite, Zeus catches sight of her and experiences emotions that he had not felt since that time when npot6v iep 4ltayea I Uiv cptX6trlrt, ei; Eviv cpotv v-E ?piXo,; Xi- Oovte Tocifa; (295-296). Craftily sensing Zeus's heightened passion, Hera coyly spins a false story for him about her need to go on a long trip to help Okeanos and Tethys overcome some marital difficulties. The story has its intended effect as Zeus's sexual attraction for Hera intensifies. He announces that his desire for no woman or goddess has ever been aroused as fully as at this moment, and he ardently suggests v&amp;i 8' ~y' v cptX6tirt TpanreiogLev evri0vTFve (314). As evidence of the depth of his feelings he catalogues a rather lengthy list of prior sex- ual conquests (317-328), all of which pale in comparison with the pleasure he anticipates from the present encounter with his unexpect- edly attractive wife.3 Hera now skillfully completes her plan as she resorts to her final deception. She pretends that Zeus's proposition has shocked and shamed her and that she could not risk the threat to her reputation if one of the gods saw them in a compromising situation. She archly sug- gests that they return to her bedroom if his desire is so great, and he makes a counteroffer that he will hide the two of them in an impenetr- able cloud that will protect them even from the powerful rays of Helios. Hera then submits and triumphs. 3 Kirk (above, n. 1) 328-329 compares Zeus's response to Hera with Paris's eager invitation to Helen to go to bed with him in Book 3.441. He comments that Zeus "regales her with divine insouciance, with a list of mistresses who have not excited him so much."</page><page sequence="4">50 Leon Golden Here Homer provides us with a miniature comic drama as he represents t6 yeXoiov in the context of a carefully structured interaction among four highly anthropomorphic divinities: Hera, Aphrodite, Sleep, and Zeus. He depicts a scene that has a recognizable beginning, mid- dle, and end governed by psychological necessity and probability and one which reveals nuances of &amp;ptrla and alaxo; that are realistic on the human plane and joyously whimsical on the divine level. The compact drama begins with Hera's frustration over Zeus's intervention in the war and her discovery of the means to counter his efforts. Her decision to enhance her sexual attractions and thus exploit the well- known lechery of her husband involves an element of a'axoo on both their parts. We watch her carefully select the clothes and jewelry she will wear, skillfully formulate the lies she will tell Aphrodite and Zeus, craftily proffer the one bribe that will break down Sleep's fearful resis- tance, and then brilliantly achieve the sexual arousal in Zeus that is the key to her plan. In all of these situations Hera has made a shrewdly correct assessment of the character and goals of the divinities she wishes to manipulate. Homer does not depict the other characters in this comic drama as fully as Hera, but his gullible Aphrodite, his frightened, yet vulnerable Sleep and his arrogantly libidinous Zeus are also finely sketched anthropomorphic portraits that complement the portrayal of a shrewdly designing goddess who knows exactly what she wants and how to get it and who will stop at nothing including the use of lies, bribes, and her own body to achieve her goal. This is a very clear illustration of what Aristotle meant when he described Homer as the poet who developed comedy to maturity by offering dramatic representations of t6 yeXhoov in place of invective (Poetics 1448b34-38).4 In Book 3 we have the introduction of the second form of "dramatic representation of the ridiculous," the comic and tragicomic actions involving Paris.5 Our first description of Paris is extremely informative 4 Hawley (above, n. 1) does not do justice to this scene when he states that its comic effect arises simply and merely from the fact that the seduced Zeus "is the victim of a delusion." (82) For a perceptive and comprehensive study of the way in which this scene articulates with the larger narrative scheme of the Iliad see Erbse (above, n. 1) 93-112. 5 Hess (above, n. 1) recognized very early the ambivalent character of Paris in the Iliad (38): Unter den Troern ist hier Held Paris nicht zu vergessen, einer der meisterhaften Charaktere des Dichters, der verkijrperte Leichtsinn. Priichtig stolzirt er in seinem Pardelfell mit zwei Speeren in langen Schritten einher (F. 17 ff.), reisst aber nachher aus, woffir ihm Hektor mehrere den Unmuth recht drastisch verrathende, fast drollige Ehren-</page><page sequence="5">c6 yEXo'ov in the Iliad 51 (15-20): oi 6' -Z 8i oax68v iAav V iR' &amp;xxiXitotv i6vze, Tpooxv giv rtpoal dXtEv 'AX~av6po; OEOEtio ;, rtap6av q O)ROltOtV EXOV iKaCi CaCtLxrUaa t6a Kai ~(ipo0" alctp 06 0o)pe 6 o 0)KEKopUORvaa XaXKiP Irca0,ov 'Apyeio)v rpoKaliEo rtIv'ra; &amp;piotomS &amp;vzitPov laxFxoaaoat alv aiva 6rqtOitit. Here we see Paris in the front of the Trojan army, engaging our atten- tion by the splendid leopard skin he is wearing which Homer, not accidentally, mentions first of all his accoutrement. Then we see him weighed down with an assortment of weapons: a bent bow, a sword, and two spears crested with bronze. Jauntily leading his troops, extremely well dressed, and armed to the teeth, Paris makes a splendid picture as he challenges the Greeks to fight face to face with him.6 But moments later when Menelaos eagerly races from the Greek ranks to answer the challenge, a radical transformation takes place in Paris. We titel ertheilt und ihm seine Weichlichkeit vorwirft. Gleich nach dem Kampf mit Menelaos hat er nur fiir seine Liebe zur Helena Gedanken und vergisst um ihretwillen Troja und den Krieg. Gegen sein Gegner in Troja is er heftig und fibermiithig (I. 360 ff.) und wird daher auch von Allen, selbst dem humanen Idaios und Hektor gehasst oder ver- achtet (F. 319, 453 f., Z. 282, H. 390). Seine Ausdrucksweise ist zum Theil eben so auf- fallend sprunghaft, als sein Wesen (N. 775 ff.). Dennoch ist gerade er es, der bedeutende Erfolge erzielt, der den Diomed, Machaon, und Eurypylos verwundet (A. 369 ff., 505, 581), und selbst Hektor kann ihm, wenn er in vers6hnlicher Stimmung ist, die Achtung nicht versagen (Z. 521 ff.). Kirk (above, n. 1) 274 observes that Paris "will behave badly again, but then he can be truly heroic on occasions, also." 6 Kirk (above, n. 1) 267 comments that "Paris' costume and equipment are a surprise." He notes that archers "would not be prancing ahead of the rest, for archers operated from cover nor did they normally wear leopard-skins as here ... nor, above all, did they clutter themselves with pairs of spears as at 18." Kirk speculates that "either the poet is making him out to be quite eccentric, which is unlikely; or the poet is being a little careless ..." Hess (above, n. 1) 38 also comments on Paris's unusual uniform and equipment: "Priichtig stolzirt er in seinem Pardelfell mit zwei Speeren in langen Schritten einher." I will argue that it is actually Homer's intention here to attribute to Paris certain comic eccentricities just as it is his intention at other times to give him heroic qualities so that in the end an overall tragicomic effect is achieved. Hess correctly notes in this same pas- sage that "Dennoch ist gerade er es, der bedeutende Erfolg erzielt, der den Diomed, Machaon und Eurypylus verwundet ... und selbst Hektor kann ihm, wenn er in versohn- licher Stimmung ist, die Achtung nicht versagen."</page><page sequence="6">52 Leon Golden are told that when he saw Menelaos charging at him, "caterynr q(ikov i}jop" (31), and he rapidly retired into the ranks of his own army to avoid death. The swift transition from swashbuckling bravado to hasty flight reflects behavior that is inappropriate within the terms of the heroic code which guides the actions of the best of the Greek heroes. Since the immediate consequences of his flight are happy rather than painful ones for Paris, there is a humorous tone to this scene. For when a pretense at heroics turns into a frightened (but suc- cessful) run for one's life, we have an example of spiritual ugliness without pain, ro6 yEXo'ov, which precisely meets the Aristotelian cri- terion for comedy. While the reader and other neutral observers can see Aristotelian comedy at work here, Hektor does not. As an involved participant in the war, he is annoyed and exasperated with Paris's conduct and so addresses him after his escape with vituperation (39): "Aoartapt, Eo60; oipt(ztE, yuvai0tavE;, 7rtREportEut(d . Here we see that actions that are taken lightly by Paris have extremely painful consequences to others. In the concluding scene of Book 3, where Paris has again escaped with his life from hand-to-hand combat with Menelaos, Helen continues the bitter humor of invective by denouncing Paris as a coward (428-436). His response to her admonitions is (441): &amp;,XX' yE 6i1 ptX6trItt tpa- tEioplEV E1v1OiVtE. In the context of the lethal dimensions of the war he has caused, this answer is a flippantly inappropriate one. Paris trivi- alizes the war by subordinating it to his personal relationship to Helen. On one level he creates a comic action here because he is able to remove himself from the real world anguish of the orthodox heroes to enjoy to the fullest a romantic dream. He seduces Helen while tem- porarily ignoring the reality of the bloody war that is going on outside of his bedroom. His behavior is deemed inappropriate by Hektor and other Trojan leaders, but he is impervious to their anger and suffers no painful consequences for it. When we focus on his escape from the fields of slaughter to the arms of Helen and on his own egoistical for- mulation of the "make love not war" axiom, we find a comic dimension to the scene. But when we note the impact of his conduct on others and on the insults hurled at him by Hektor and Helen, we observe that there is another level on which Paris's actions evoke deep pain. Homer tells us at 3.454 that after Paris fled from Menelaos, his own Trojan com- rades would not have hidden him from the vengeance seeking Greeks Ioov ydp optyv &amp;aotv &amp;lri XOEct o lcpi ClXEaivr. When the same inap-</page><page sequence="7">r6 yeXo^tov in the Iliad 53 propriate conduct generates simultaneously both painless and painful responses, we have the necessary conditions for tragicomedy, and the Paris theme in the Iliad, I argue, is an important tragicomic narrative which is intimately connected with one of the central heroic themes of the poem.7 In 6 (312-341) we have the scene in which Hektor returns to his palace to visit his wife but stops first to urge Paris to return to battle. He finds him 'v Oadlip irEptcKacXxa TEZE' Enrovra (321) and chides him for not taking part in the war. Paris accepts the rebuke and remarks that Helen has also been trying to get him to return to the struggle against the Greeks. Clader perceptively notes8 that: the tone of [Achilles'] anger and refusal to fight is quite serious, while the tone of this scene is close to comic-tragicomic, perhaps, if one considers the enormity of the battle outside con- trasted with the folly within the house. Alexandros himself 7 The comic aspects of this Paris/Helen scene have been noted by others (see Clarke, above, n. 1, 247). Viewing Paris simply as comic character does not, I believe, do justice to the complex and varied evidence we are given about him. Some do not note comic or tragicomic nuances in the scene. See P. Vivante, The Homeric Imagination (Bloomington-London 1970) 148-150 for a romantic reading of the episode and John A. Scott, The Unity of Homer (repr. New York 1965 [originally Berkeley 1921]) 227-230 for an evaluation of Paris as a legitimate hero. C. M. Bowra, Tradition and Design in the Iliad (Oxford 1963) 24 and W. Bergold, Der Zweikampf des Paris und Menelaos (Bonn 1977) 130 suggest that Paris as well as Helen are under the literal control of Aphrodite. Johannes Th. Kakridis, Homeric Researches (Lund 1949) 45-46 accurately pictures the real nature of Paris when he comments as follows on the encounter between Hektor and Paris in Book VI in Helen's chamber: "Paris is tarrying inside Helen's neptucaXhXa chamber, surrounded by women and toying with his weapons-not his spear, but his shield, his breastplate and his bow-while the town outside is in danger of being lost. He is not in the least concerned about the calamity threatening the town and brought about by himself. See also Hess's description of Paris quoted in note 6 and Clader (above, n. 1) 15-16. Paris fits well into the lucid description of the tragicomic given by B. Seiden- sticker, Palintonos Harmonia: Studien zu komischen Elementen in der griechischen Tragidie (GOttingen 1982 [Hypomnemata 72]) 27-37. Seidensticker intelligently modifies Karl Guthke's insightful definition of tragicomedy as "die synthetische Ver- einigung dieser Elemente, die beide miteinander identisch werden lisst, so dass das Kom- ische das Tragische und das Tragische das Komische ist." Seidensticker correctly allows for varying degrees of tragedy and comedy to coexist and for them to stand in juxta- position to each other as well as to exist simultaneously. With Paris the tragicomedy arises from juxtaposed scenes of comedy and tragedy. 8 (above, n. 1) 15-16.</page><page sequence="8">54 Leon Golden extends the parody by declaring that he was not moved by anger, but rather wanted to give himself over to grief (Z 336). The pic- ture that Paris helps paint of himself is that of a spoiled child, inca- pable of understanding where duty lies or what honest emotion may be. In Book 11 two levels of comedy appear in the scene in which Paris shoots an arrow at Diomedes and wounds that great warrior in the foot. We are told that after striking Diomedes Paris gaXa t181 yE1cacxa; a &amp; X6Xot &amp;uagni6rlj8E (378-379). His great amusement at the fact he has inflicted a superficial wound on Diomedes parallels his adolescent behavior in subordinating military responsibilities to his attraction to Helen. Acting more like a child than a seasoned soldier he cries out with delight and wonder, "P3~IXrlat, o'68' aktov P3Xo; E"cpuyEv" (380). Diomedes recognizes the immaturity of this remark as he scornfully abuses Paris as a to'6ta, Xco3rl7'ip, c pat &amp;ayxa, rtapOEvonirta (385) and then gives him a lesson in the authentic heroic attitude toward war when he states that the person who is struck by him is one who aila'xt yaiav ApezOov incxOat, oicovoi &amp;8 nep nrE ";i yuvaiice; (394-395). For Diomedes and the other great heroes, war is never an amusement but, rather, a deadly serious affair in which killing and being killed is the central theme. Diomedes disdains Paris's unheroic laughter over a meaningless accomplishment and, by hurling sarcastic epithets at him, provides us with another example of the comedy of insult. For Paris the encounter with Diomedes is, indeed, something amusing, and he has no interest in pressing it to the heroic level of killing and being killed. His laughter makes the wounding of Diomedes seem to be more a childish prank that inconveniences his opponent rather than a serious military feat and offers us an example of comic action in which a potentially heroic struggle between two enemies is reduced, as Diomedes so clearly recognizes, to a trivial event. This is, however, another example of tragicomedy in that the trivial victory which so amuses Paris is a source of outrage and betrayal to those who take the heroic code seriously.9 In the two examples of the dramatic representation of the ridiculous 9 Hewitt (1) (above, n. 1) 438 suggests that Paris's laughter is motivated by the "dis- comfiture of an opponent." I think that is true as far as it goes but that Paris's laughter is a more complex phenomenon.</page><page sequence="9">x6 yEXoi'ov in the Iliad 55 which we have discussed we see that potentially anoov6a'ot characters, gods or heroes, play out cpalXot roles in circumstances which are pain- less for themselves although they may have deleterious consequences for others. Hera's strategem in exploiting Zeus's lechery and her artful manipulation of Aphrodite and Sleep with lies and bribes derive their obvious charm from their all too human characteristics. Seduction, lies, and bribery are, even more for gods than humans, ignoble rather than noble activities, and since they lead to a painless outcome for Hera, they are appropriate themes for the comic treatment which they actually receive in this passage. In regard to Paris we observe him, on the one hand, prancing in front of his own army with a majestic uniform and provoking the enemy but, then, running for his life when Menelaos bears down upon him; next we see him trivializing heroic, face-to-face combat by his jocular attitude toward the superficial wound he has inflicted on Diomedes. On the other hand, we have him fighting with bravery and effectiveness as Hektor, himself, acknowledges when he occasionally accepts the role of a hero in war. Yet, we must note, his flight from battle takes him back to Helen where lust overwhelms the demands of the military heroic code. Running from battle to the arms of one's mis- tress is clearly, in the context of the values of the Iliad, the activity of a (pa)Xo and not a orot&amp;6ao; human being, and much contempt is directed against Paris for his diminished commitment to the war by both Helen and by his fellow Trojans. Nevertheless, Paris's behavior leads to no painful consequences for himself although it troubles others considerably. Thus there is a component of his actions which, in Aris- totelian terms, is comic and another component which is painful. The same point can also be made in regard to the seduction scene of Book 14. There are no serious consequences for Hera and Zeus, but the same cannot be said for the human beings whose fates are sealed because of this mountain top tryst.10 We see then that Homer's use of the dramatic representation of r6 yEoitov is in no sense incidental to the central themes of the Iliad; rather it is an effective technique for underscoring those themes. The seduction scene in Book 14 is an eloquent evocation of the vast 10 For a discussion of the tragicomic dimensions of this scene see B. Seidensticker (above, n. 7) 58 and my article "Ato; r~rlad and the Unity of Iliad 14," Mnemosyne 42 (1989) 1-11.</page><page sequence="10">56 Leon Golden separation which exists between the lives of the gods and the lives of humans in this work. We note this schism between the divine and human worlds especially clearly in two other important scenes in the Iliad. At 20.19-32 Zeus rejoices in his heart at the spectacle of men killing and being killed, urges the other gods to support, in any way they wish, each of the warring parties, and then personally elevates the intensity of the lethal struggle going on before him. At 21.461-467 Apollo advises Poseidon that it makes no sense for them to fight on behalf of worthless mortals who resemble the leaves in the fragility and triviality of their lives. Walter Burkert has clearly explained the nature and importance of this schism as follows:11 Fiir die Welt der Ilias ist der Gegensatz des heiteren G6tterlebens und des t6dlich ernsten menschlichen Schicksals konstitutiv; man konnte dieses Nebeneinander geradezu die "innere, notwendige Form der Ilias" nennen. Der "erhabene Unernst" (Reinhardt) der G6tter ist die Gegenwelt zum menschlichen Leid, die ironische Spiegelung menschlicher Tragik ... Spitere Theologie sah im Lachen der G6tter eine Minderung ihrer Wiirde; in Wahrheit ist es eher Ausdruck einer ungeheuren, unheimlichen Uberlegenheit, einer wahrhaft g6ttlichen Freiheit und Sicherheit, aller nachrech- nenden Menschenvernunft weit entrtickt. The scenes involving Paris are, in their turn, a potent critique of the heroic code of the orthodox warriors of the Iliad. The attraction of Paris to the pleasures of life is a pointed contrast to the "kill or be killed" goal of Hektor, Diomedes, and Achilles. This theme, affirming life over death, plays a significant role elsewhere in the poem: in Hek- tor and Andromache's protective love for Astyanax in Book 6, in a number of the scenes of joy and tranquility depicted on the shield of Achilles,12 and most especially in the poignant triumph of compassion over wrath which takes place in Achilles's psyche in Book 24. 11 W. Burkert, "Das Lied von Ares und Aphrodite," Rheinisches Museum fiir Philolo- gie 103 (1960) 140. 12 For an especially perceptive judgment about the message of Achilles's shield see O. Taplin, "The Shield of Achilles," Greece &amp; Rome 27 (1980) 15. He notes that the shield functions, on a larger scale than the similes in the poem, to "make us see war as wasteful and destructive, the blight of peace and pleasure" and that it "makes us think about war and see it in relation to peace" (italics Taplin's).</page><page sequence="11">x6 ytXoiov in the Iliad 57 Thus, through the medium of tb yeXolov, Paris affirms other significant evidence in the Iliad which indicates that there are meaning- ful alternatives to the bloody grace bestowed on heroes by war; just as the comic dimension of Hera's seduction of Zeus recognizes, along with other gloomier lines of evidence, the unbridgeable alienation of the gods from human beings in this poem.
