Van Woudenberg's response on p. 183 is to invoke a Fregean revival of what he calls Platonic objects, including states of affairs, to which apriori knowledge can correspond. But it is not at all clear that Reid would have, or could coher- ently have, endorsed such a position.

Continuum Press: London, 2004. Pp. 222. H/b ?14.99. This characteristically gracious and gracefully written book is a record of hon- est perplexity. Sir Anthony Kenny cannot see how to make any sort of good philosophical sense of religious (i.e. Christian, mostly) belief, utterance, and practice; but he cannot simply wash his hands of religion, either. In the twelve essays that constitute this book-some of them dating from the mid-eighties, and six of them previously unpublished-he continues the meditations on religious themes that have characterized a number of his other books over the years, such as The Five Ways (Routledge, 1969), The God of the Philosophers (Oxford, 1978), and What is Faith? (Oxford, 1992; essays 6, 7 and 8 in that vol- ume = essays 6, 9 and 2 in this volume). Central to nearly all of Kenny's essays is the theme I shall focus on here, the ancient theme of the ineffability and unknowability of God: in the words of Isaiah 45.16, often quoted by Luther, vere tu es Deus absconditus, Deus Israhel salvator. Hardly any serious religious thinker would deny that the sentence 'God is ineffable' expresses some truth or other. On this even A. J. Ayer and St. Thomas Aquinas agree: 'No sentence which purports to describe the nature of a transcendent God can possess any literal significance' (Language, Truth and Logic, p. 152); 'It is impossible for any predicate to be applied univocally both to God and to his creatures' (Summa Theologiae, la.13.5). The differences come, of course, over exactly what truth it is that 'God is ineffable' expresses, and what response this truth calls for. As Ayer sees, one obvious response to the acknowledged impossibility of speaking about God directly, literally, or non-analogically (pick your terminology) is to take it as justifying a refusal or reluctance to say anything about God at all. This tends to be how Kenny takes it, though usually his attitude is a reluctance to talk about God like Kant's or Wittgenstein's, rather than an outright refusal like Ayer's. Mind, Vol. 115 . 458 . April 2006 ? Mind Association 2006</page><page sequence="2">422 Book Reviews However, there is another possible response to the admission of God's inef- fability. That admission might also be thought to help explain why religious language is bound to be imprecise and impressionistic, but without stripping religious discourse of all rational discipline (or in the vocabulary that Kenny usually prefers, making it a language game with no rules). Let me show what I have in mind here by looking fairly closely at a problem that Kenny discusses at length in his essay 'The Limits of Anthropomorphism', the question of what it might mean to describe God as a person (pp. 79-80): It is perhaps barely possible to conceive of a disembodied spirit which is individuat- ed not by having a body but by having an individual locus or viewpoint on the world ... [But] even if such a spirit is conceivable it will not help us in giving content to the notion of a God who is a non-embodied mind. For it was precisely the limitations in space and time that we imagined for such a being which made it possible to individ- uate it without a body ... Reflection on what is involved in the attribution of men- talistic predicates to human beings ... has brought out the enormous difficulty in applying such predicates meaningfully to [God]. Philosophy in this area leads to the same conclusion as that of those theologians who have said that when we speak of God we do not know what we are talking about. Kenny begins here with the notion of a typical human person as a mind-body composite existing in space and time. He then moves from that notion, to the notion of God as a person, as it were by a process of subtraction. First we sub- tract the 'body' side of the mind-body composite, and try to imagine what a mind could be like in the absence of a correlated body. Then we subtract the spatiotemporal context of typical personhood, and try to think about what a person or a mind could be outside that context: what it would be like for there to be a mind that is not a mind in space-time. The result of this process is, unsurprisingly, bewilderment. As we follow Kenny's careful discussion of the conceivability of a God who is, in his phrase, a 'disembodied spirit', 'a mind without a history' (p. 79), we are bound to end up feeling as if we have been asked to imagine a handleless knife from which the blade has been lost. Kenny's use of this subtractive process evidently presupposes that God can be sorted onto one side or the other of the mind/body distinction that applies to us. His idea, apparently, is that God is a person who is like us in one of the aspects that constitutes our personhood, the mental, but who simply does not have the other aspect, the physical. (In this sense disembodiment, the divest- ment or stripping away of a body from a mind, is exactly the motjuste for what Kenny wants us to imagine.) Similarly, Kenny's subtractive process also seems to presuppose that God can be sorted onto one side or the other of the distinc- tion that applies when contrasting, say, myself with the number six: the dis- tinction between those things that exist in space-time and those that do not. We are to imagine God as a person like us, except that, like the number six, he falls on the other side of the distinction between the spatiotemporal and the non-spatiotemporal. This presupposition that God can be thus neatly classified by our human categories-as mental rather than physical, as non-spatiotemporal rather than Mind,Vol. 115 . 458 . April2006 ? Mind Association 2006</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 423 spatiotemporal-seems a very dubious one. It would certainly not have been accepted by the canonical scholastics, whose consistent view is that 'God is not in a genus'-in Bonaventure's words, that Deus nec est in aliquo determinato genere, nec in pluribus (Commentary on the Sentences 1.2.4; cp. Aquinas, Summa Theologiae la.3.5). The scholastic doctrine that God non est in genere means that the God of the scholastics is a transcendent reality that simply overwhelms or overrides such classifications of ours as 'mental rather than physical'. And one point of refusing to use such classifications as the subtrac- tive method uses them is, of course, that so classifying God means speaking too literally of God. Freedom from this sort of literalism may actually make our concept of God clearer (which is not to say clear). I have no more idea than Kenny has what it might mean to suppose that God has a mind in literally the same sense as I have, except that God lacks a body, and again that God is literally a person in the same sense as I am, except that God is outside time and space. Once these subtractions are made, I really do find myself struggling with handleless-knife- with-lost-blade sort of thoughts. What I do not find so unintelligible is the idea that there might be a being who is neither mental nor physical in the same sense as I am, nor even a person in the same sense that I am, but of whom some of the kinds of terms that we apply to persons-good, wise, perceptive, loving, merciful, inventive-are, to borrow a phrase from Aquinas, true in a pre-eminent degree. An analogy to spell out the italicized phrase: If there were some race of aliens vastly superior to humans in intelligence and goodness, we would of course struggle to understand those aliens. But we would not, I think, struggle with the idea that our terms 'intelligent' and 'good' might be pre-eminently applicable to those aliens-more applicable to them than to anything that we had invented the terms to apply to. Nor would we struggle with the idea that these hyper-intelligent and ultra-virtuous aliens might themselves propose to us that we extend or revise our use of such terms in ways that we, for our part, would be quite unable to make full sense of, even where we dimly grasped their point. Just this, it seems to me, is the kind of speculation about how our concep- tual resources might be outrun that talk about God invites us to engage in. It is, no doubt, only speculation, or at least that is all it is until there is good evi- dence, in experience or history or both, that something exists that actually does outrun our concepts in this sort of way. On the other hand, this sort of speculation is not in the least unintelligible. And it shows something else that is surely important too: namely that there is nothing 'self-refuting' in the idea of an inconceivable being (see Kenny, p. 15). There is not even anything incon- ceivable in that idea. To come back to my hyper-intelligent aliens, it is perfectly easy to conceive that their thoughts might not be my thoughts, and their ways not my ways: that both might be celestially elevated above my own level. In that case, the detail of the aliens' thoughts and ways would of course be quite Mind, Vol. 115 . 458 . April 2006 ? Mind Association 2006</page><page sequence="4">424 Book Reviews inconceivable to me. But what would not be inconceivable to me would be the simpler thought that the aliens have thoughts and ways that are way above my own. In this sense, then, we can have a perfectly good concept of the inconceiv- able. And so we can apply this concept to our discourse about God. The ques- tion of what might justify us in engaging in such discourse is another matter. But at any rate it can be shown, I think, that such discourse, while certainly mysterious, is nonetheless not as hopelessly dark and confused as Kenny takes it to be. There is plenty else to like in this stimulating and engaging little book-I particularly enjoyed Kenny's essay on 'Leslie Stephen and the Mountains of Truth', not to mention the quotations from the Arthur Hugh Clough poem with the refrain 'Ting-ting, there is no God, dong'-but space prevents me from close comment on any more of it. You will just have to go out and read it for yourself. You will not, I should think, regret it.

Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2004. Pp. x + 341. H/b ?47.00, $74.00. The book offers a comprehensive, accurate, and textually supported descrip- tion of the philosophical views of emotion from the fifth century BC to the fif- teenth century AD. The wealth of references to primary sources, coupled with the conciseness in the presentation of numerous theoretical accounts, makes the monograph an ideal point of reference for the study of ancient and medi- eval approaches to emotion. The treatise begins with Plato's views on human psychology, followed by a reconstruction of the main claims about emotions in Aristotle's work. The description of the alternative approaches flourishing in the Hellenistic period is well structured, and the presentation of Plotinus's remarks on the subject is refreshingly clear. Exploring the passage from the Classical Greek to the Christian conception of emotions, the chapter on the early Church Fathers is one of the nicest in the book, placing their analysis of emotions in its ethical Mind, Vol. 115 . 458 .
