HEWES ROM MANTLES CAVE, in Dinosaur National Monument, in the northwestern corner of Colorado, Burgh and Scoggin (1948) report a buckskin pouch which contained a remarkably well preserved flicker-quill head- band turned up with miniver. The similarity of this ancient ceremonial headdress, apart from its fur trimming, to the ethnographic flicker-quill headbands of California, raises a challenging culture-historical problem. The evidence suggests that the similarity may rest on cultural connections and that the flicker- quill headband may be an important key for the understanding of Californian-Great Basin relationships during the first millennium of this era. Burgh and Scoggin (1948, pp. 38-41) have described the archaeological circumstances of the Colorado find in detail. Mantles cave is one of several non-residential caves in Yampa Canyon, containing small chambers dug into the silt or sand of their floors. The culture represented in the caves and open sites has been identified in part with the Fremont cul- ture of east-central Utah, a basically Basket- maker manifestation extending along the Green River and its tributaries, and dating from about 400 to 800 A.D. (Morss, 1931; Lister, 1951). The Mantles cave headband and other Yampa Canyon specimens are now in the Henderson Museum, University of Colorado, Boulder. The Colorado headband merits a detailed description. Fundamentally, the technique of manufacture is the same as that employed in the making of the California specimens: the central tail feathers of the Red-shafted Flicker, Colaptes cafer collaris, have been trimmed of their vanes so as to leave the red-orange shaft or quill bare for about 8 cm. of the total feather length of about 12.5 cm. The remain- ing untrimmed 4.5 cm. of the feather at the distal end forms a roughly diamond-shaped tuft. The trimmed feathers, placed side by side, form a continuous elongated mat of quills. The Mantles cave band is 58.5 cm. long, and contains 370 or more feathers, which would have required some 60 birds. The quills are arranged so that their ventral or under- surface portions face the front of the head- dress-i.e., the surface not in contact with the wearer's head. The quills are held together by two horizontal threads of sinew, which pass through perforations which pierce each quill at two points below the diamond-shaped tuft. The uppermost of these threads stops 14 cm. from the right end, and 12 cm. from the left end of the band, in terms of the wearer's right and left. The lower thread runs the whole length of the band. The quills are also anchored by the basal binding strips. Along the front edge of the band this consists of a trimming of ermine, made from the pelts of three weasels (Mustela frenata, probably neva- densis) in winter pelage, averaging 2.25 to 2.50 cm. in width. Along the back edge is a buck- skin backing strip, of the same width as the ermine band, which would be in contact with the wearer's forehead. These strips hold the bases of the row of quills between them, and they are firmly united by stout sinew lashings at about 1 cm. intervals, both along the lower edge of the headdress and along the upper 147 HEWES]</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY margins of the ermine and buckskin strips. At each end the ermine widens out, extending nearly the width of the quill band on the rear or inner surface, around which it has been folded, and to about 7.5 cm. on the end por- tions of the front surface, covering the quills for about 6 cm. inward from each end. Just to the left of the center of the band are six quills from the Yellow-shafted Flicker, Colaptes auratus luteus, identical to the other quills except for their color. Close inspection of the headband discloses no evidence that these yellow quills were inserted at a later time, by way of repair; they seem to have formed part of the band from its beginning. At each end of the band is a single primary wing feather, 22 cm. long, extending 11.5 cm. beyond the tips of the flicker-feather tufts. These two end-feathers match, and are almost certainly from the left and right wings of a single bird, probably a crow. The concave undersurfaces of these feathers face forward, and shafts and barbs alike are brownish-black. Along the front of the band, at fairly even intervals, their tips reaching almost to the level of the upper horizontal thread, are eight additional flicker tail feathers, of which only the distal tufts are exposed. Their shafts, hid- den behind the ermine trimming, have been shortened about 6.5 cm. Three of these are to the right of the center of the band, four to the left, with one in the center. The manner of wearing the band is clearly indicated by the presence of two buckskin FIG. 72. Distribution of flicker-quill headbands in western North America. See p. 149 for explanation of symbols. 148 [2, 1952</page><page sequence="3">FLICKER-QUILL HEADBANDS thongs, about 2 mm. thick, and about 9.5 cm. long, arising from the buckskin basal strip at points 11.5 cm. in from the ends. If the band were worn snugly against the forehead and temples, these thongs would run from above each ear to be tied together at the back of the head. The ethnographic Californian speci- mens were held on the wearers' heads in simi- lar fashion (Kroeber, 1925, pl. 59). The bands were not meant to encircle the head, but were worn so that the ends flapped out free at the sides. Burgh and Scoggin (1948, p. 40) have com- mented on the identification of the bird species from which the quills were obtained. The flicker, also called yellowhammer in the eth- nographic literature, is a very widespread and common bird of North America, belonging to the order of woodpeckers (Pici), divided into several closely related species distinguishable mainly on the basis of plumage colors. The Red-shafted Flicker, from which all but 6 quills were obtained, has a range extending from southeastern British Columbia eastward into the western Plains from southern Alberta to west Texas, and covering nearly all the eco- logically suitable portions of the Pacific slope as far south as southern California, and in Mexico into Zacatecas and Durango. The spe- cies winters throughout most of this range, but may extend casually farther east; on the Pacific Coast, its winter range also includes northern Baja California (American Ornithological Un- ion, 1931, p. 188; Peterson, 1941, pp. 103-4). The bird from which the yellow quills were taken, Colaptes auratus luteus, is distributed generally east of the Rockies, though the ranges of the eastern and western flickers overlap somewhat, so that hybrid individuals are not uncommon. The yellow-shafted species also occurs in the state of Washington. Still an- other yellow-shafted species, Colaptes chrys- oides mearnsi, occurs in the sahuaro belt along the lower Colorado River and its tributaries in southeastern California and Arizona. On ornithological grounds, it is entirely reasonable to locate the place of manufacture of the Mantles cave headband in the vicinity of Yampa Canyon, Colorado. Certainly the possi- bility that the specimen could have been a tradepiece originating in central California is diminished by the presence in it of quills from a species distributed chiefly east of the Rockies, occasional in the mountain area, but certainly not in California. Flicker feathers have been found often in Basketmaker sites in the greater Southwest, and were encountered by Morss in six of the Fremont River sites which formed the basis for his definition of the Fremont culture (Morss, 1931, p. 76). At site 27, for instance, Morss found a strip of buckskin which had at one end a tiny fragment of red flicker feather, bound on with sinew; a bit of white down was secured with sinew at the other. It is barely possible that a large petroglyph near Fruita, Utah, attributed to the Fremont cul- ture, may represent an anthropomorphic figure wearing a headdress similar to the Mantles cave type (Morss, 1931, pl. 16). Figure 72 shows the location of Mantles cave in relation to the distribution in ethno- graphic times of the flicker-quill headband. The dashed line surrounds the region from Yampa Canyon to the Fremont River to indi- cate the approximate area of the Fremont culture, 400 to 800 A.D. The solid black circles represent positive ethnographic occur- rences of flicker-quill headbands, reported by native informants interviewed in the course of the University of California Culture Ele- ment Survey. The hollow circles with center dots are locations of explicit negative reports, where informants denied the use of such head- bands in aboriginal times. The solid black triangles represent groups where flicker-quill bands were known, but not used as headgear in ceremonies. The Southern Californian groups thus indicated used such quill bands to decorate open-air dance enclosures, or were uncertain about their use-scarcely surprising in view of the 180 years which have passed since the beginning of Spanish mission con- tact. The one Nevada occurrence marked with a triangle is where such bands were worn on the chest by the dancer, rather than on the forehead. The central Californians did not limit their use of flicker-quill bands to head- gear worn across the forehead, though this was the commonest fashion. Long bands of flicker-quills were worn down the back as streamers or pendants, and very short segments of quill bands were suspended from pompom- like devices to be used in dancing. We can be fairly sure that flicker-quill head- bands were not used in recent times in the Southwest, nor among the historic Ute, South- ern Paiute, and Northern Shoshone. It is extremely unlikely that headbands of this type HEWES ] 149</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY were used by any of the historic western Plains tribes either. Notes on the ethnographic distribution: Plateau: whole woodpecker feathers worn in hair as shamanistic insignia on Lower Columbia R, with ab- sences checked for middle Fraser R. and elsewhere (Ray, 1942). Oregon Coast: wearing of headbands of whole wood- pecker scalps from the Acorn or California Woodpecker, Balanosphyra formicivora (?), as in Northwestern Cali- fornia;: not to be confused with flicker-quill bands (Bar- nett, 1937). Northwestern California: Yurok, Karok, Hupa, and their neighbors used ceremonial headbands of whole woodpecker scalps, glued on to buckskin bands. These were worn in the Jumping Dance, and, like the flicker- quill bands worn farther south, across the forehead, with ends flapping loose at sides. These woodpecker scalp bands were trimmed with white deer-belly fur, a trait reminiscent of the Mantles cave specimen. The Chilula had the northwesternmost use of flicker- quill headbands in California, and, like the Mantles cave specimen (but unlike the typical Central Californ- ian band) had the diamond-shaped tufts along the up- per border of the band only (Kroeber, 1925, Fig. 20, d). The Chilula variant, along with some others, provides a sufficiently wide range of variability in California to accommodate, typologically speaking, the divergent fea- tures of the Mantles cave band. The Sinkyone not only had typical flicker-quill head- bands but little banner-like tablets of conjoined flicker- quills, - in essence short segments of the longer fore- head bands-, hung from sticks placed in a twisted forehead fillet of fur, something like the Pomo and Miwok pompoms. That a connection exists between these bannerettes and the regular quill headbands can- not be doubted; their relatively restricted distribution suggests that they are a local specialization of the basic quill headband trait. Northern and Northeastern California: Yurok of Weitchpec to E. Achomawi, a transitional belt for feath- er-work headgear, in which there are bands composed of whole flicker-feathers with tips all in the same direc- tion, the feathers themselves being "notched" at the sides. Central California: Pomo Guksu impersonator seems to have worn a flicker-quill band in former times; per- formance included wearer's approach to sick patients, prodding of afflicted parts with staff during dance. Patwin valued flicker headbands highly, according to length (some were 120 cm. long); aboriginally priced in clamshell disk beads, they brought $4.00 in post- contact times (Kroeber, 1932, p. 292). Patwin used such bands in several ceremonials: Hesi-cult dancer known as chelitu; wit'ili character in Kuksu cycle (two long bands trailing down back) (Kroeber, 1925, pl. 77); Kuksu impersonator accompanied by two assistants wear- ing headbands of flicker-quills, plus down-filled head-net, occipital headdress of long magpie tail-feathers sur- rounded by shorter crow feathers; lole ceremony, con- nected with girl's adolescence, women dancers wore flicker-quill headbands with magpie and hawk-feather coronets. Valley Maidu and Nisenan performers in re- lated dance cycles used similar regalia (Kroeber, 1932, pp. 327, 342, 385-8). Maidu word for flicker-quill head- band: wo'loloka; Patwin word, tsiak (from name of the bird) or Lupi (for shorter bands). Artist Louis Choris of the Russian round-the-world expedition which visited Presidio and Mission of San Francisco in 1816 depicted Indians with flicker-quill headbands as well as with tablets or bannerettes of quills. His models may have been Costanoan, Coast Miwok, or even Pomo. Heizer, in his analysis of Fletch- er's account of Drake's 16th Century visit to New Albion (prestumably Coast Miwok territory), has suggested that the crown worn by the "king" or Hioh was a flicker-quill headband (Heizer, 1947, p. 268, pl. 18a). Data for the Valley Miwok are unusually full with respect to the headbands, including the snaring of the flickers themselves. A hunter might snare "a basketful of birds" in a day, not all of them flickers (Barrett and Gifford, 1933, p. 185, Fig. 24). Miwok wore their bands either across forehead, two ends free, or fastened to crown of head, to pass down back as streamer. Bands were called tama'kkili. Miwok specimens resemble Mantles cave band in that feather tufts form solid border in contrast to Wintun, Yuki, Pomo, Chilula, and Patwin bands where tufts are spaced between tuftless quills. Miwok bands also resemble Koso and Panamint speci- mens in this respect, suggesting a distinction between southern and northern flicker-quill headband types in California (Barrett and Gifford, 1933, pl. lxxiii, 2-3). Significantly, Miwok bannerettes of flicker-quills used to adorn pompoms show spacing of tufts as in the northern headbands. All Miwok feather regalia were inherently sacred (Gifford, 1926, p. 405). Before donning flicker- quill headband, the wearer had to have it swung around him four times by dance-manager; all dancers were care- ful to keep bands from "injurious" contact with specta- tors. Manufacture of feather dance ornaments required special songs, food-offerings, etc. Flicker feathers in themselves not dangerous, could be stored around dwell- ing, but once made up into headband, became unsafe. Miwok did not dispose of such articles along with other effects of deceased, but placed them under stones in running streams. A comparable sanctity may well have invested the Mantles cave specimen, which had certainly been cached in a fashion suggesting its magical power. Yokuts men dancers wore flicker-quill headbands. Among Bankalachi-Tiibatulabal such headbands were known but rare; they were called paiya'men. Shamans could wear them in dance after mourning ceremony, not in ordinary curing seances. Yokuts wore bands not only horizontally across forehead, but hanging down back, and sometimes as belts or bandoliers. Use of flicker-quill bannerettes for pompoms was limited to [2, 1952 150</page><page sequence="5">FLICKER-QUILL HEADBANDS W. Mono and Choinimni Yokuts in S. part of Great Valley. Costanoan, Salinan, Chumash, and Gabrielino appar- ently made flicker-quill headbands, resembling existing Luisefo museum specimens, - that is, with continuous, poorly trimmed tufts instead of neatly trimmed tufts and tuftless quills (Harrington, J. P., 1942, p. 17). A cave cache in Gabrielino territory is reported to have yielded a fragmentary flicker-quill band of Luisefno type (Kroe- ber, 1925, p. 665). Southern California: Luiseiio flicker-quill bands - tu- minut, poorly trimmed and of "darker feathers" were used to decorate outdoor dance enclosures for toloache or jimsonweed initiation rites, but not worn on forehead as part of dance costume. The Mountain Cahuilla and Cupe?io did the same. Serrano did employ them as veritable headbands, as well as for belts and bandoliers. Western and Desert Dieguefio toloache initiation direc- tors wore flicker-quill belts or bandoliers (Drucker, 1937, pp. 19, 35). Great Basin: Koso or Panamint of Owens Valley south of the lake made flicker-quill bands like those of Luisefio and other S. Californians; existing specimens are of me- diocre workmanship, with only small section of each quill stripped of vanes. Two bands neatly sewn with two sinew threads running length of each, and both about 1.5 meters long, attributed to Death Valley Shoshone, are preserved at Stovepipe Wells and Furnace Creek Inn (Steward, 1933, p. 321; Kroeber, 1925, p. 591, pl. 58). Steward's Owens Valley Paiute informants did not clearly report flicker-quill headbands, but "a band of orange flicker feathers across the forehead hanging on each side to the knees, the head part including a row of sage hen tail feathers and behind this a row of eagle tail feathers, projecting upward like a Plains feather bonnet," (Steward, 1933, p. 321). Driver's later trait- list makes it clear that bands were made of quills, with tufts solid, not spaced at intervals; at Big Pine such bands were worn across forehead, at Independence, only as belts or bandoliers. The bands were worn in the men's "war dance," totsohoidu. Flicker-quill bands had a continuous distribution from Kawaiisu, Koso, Panamint of Saline V., Panamint of Death V., and Owens V. Paiute (Driver, 1937, p. 75). The traditional origin of the dance in which such headbands were worn is signifi- cant in determining the possibility of connection be- tween their recent occurrence in the Basin and the ancient Yampa Canyon, Colorado occurrence. The Owens Valley people ascribe the dance to the south,- specifically to introduction by a visitor (presumably Tiibatulabal) from the S. Fork of Kings R., west of the Sierra Nevada crest. One of Steward's informants stated that the dance had come with its feather regalia into Owens Valley in 1850. Farther north and east in the western Basin, the dance in which the headband was worn was known as the "South" or "Exhibition Dance," a performance usually put on by visitors from another locality who were paid for the affair by their hosts. Among those with the "South Dance" were the Lida Valley Shoshone, who wore the bands on their chests (see Fig. 72). The dance seems to have spread more widely into Southern Nevada Shoshone territory than the associated flicker-quill headband. The "South Dance" and quill headband occur among the N. Paiute of Smith and Mason Valleys, upper Walker R., Carson R. south of the Sink, and as far as the lower Humboldt R. valley, but significantly, not among the Washo (Steward, 1933, pp. 266, 324; Stewart, 1941, pp. 416-17). The dance and the headband reached the Owens Valley about 1850, and spread slowly, the dance reaching Carson Sink and Winnemucca about 1900. The ethnographic occurrences of the flicker-quill headband east of the Sierra Nevada thus fail to bridge the gap between central California and Yampa Canyon, Colorado, unless we choose to date the Mantles cave specimen post-1850. The foregoing review of the ethnographic data shows that the ceremonial associations of the flicker-quill headband are not specific. In the Pomo-Patwin area, the headbands form part of the paraphernalia of the Kuksu and Hesi cults; in Southern California they are used in connection with the toloache initiation, and in the western Basin in what seems to be a fairly modern, social rather than religious dance. Such evidence sheds little direct light on the problem of the antiquity of the trait, but does suggest that it may have had a long history. Here we might repeat that the differences between the archaeological specimen from Mantles cave and the various ethnographic examples do not seem to be of first-order importance. Hypotheses concerning the interrupted dis- tribution of flicker-quill headbands in western North America must be able to account satis- factorily for a discontinuity of over 500 miles in space, and probably of more than 1000 years in time. Fortunately, previous ethno- graphic theory can be brought into the prob- lem. Klimek, working with ethnographic data available before the systematic collection of the culture element distribution lists (which he in fact stimulated) was able to extract thirteen "culture strata" from the Californian material; his statistical procedure resembled what is now called factor analysis (Klimek, 1935, p. 40, Table 3). Klimek included lin- guistic and anthropometric data, which, though they do not bulk large in his quantitative studies, provided a framework for the geo- graphical and temporal placement of the "culture strata." Klimek dealt only with 151 HEWES]</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [, groups within the modern state borders of California, but, happily for our purposes, one of the elements figuring in his analysis is the flicker-quill headband. The thirteen "culture strata" are reduced to six broad time periods, for which Klimek (wisely) did not set specific dates. His "strata" were not all state-wide, so that more than one could be allocated to the same general epoch. The flicker-quill headband-Klimek's "yellow- hammer quill headband," belongs in stratum Z, where it accompanies splitstick dice, the bullroarer, coiled basketry, cocoon rattle, man's hair net, feather forks and darts for headdress, splitstick rattle, magnesite cylinder used for treasure, footdrum, feather rope, widow pitches head or does not wash, various Kuksu-cult items, earth-covered ceremonial house, and parent-in-law avoidance (Klimek, 1945, pp. 40, 42, 46). In passing it is worth noting that archaeology would be unlikely to yield infor- mation on most of these items, at least not in central California where there are few dry caves. The Z-stratum elements were wide- spread in ethnographic north-central Cali- fornia, San Joaqiin Valley, and to some extent in southern California and the northwest. Klimek identified stratum Z with the Penutian language stock, even though the Pomo and Hokan groups, as well as the Yuki and the Kato showed a high degree of participation in its elements. He further remarked that whereas coiled basketry, the bullroarer, and parent-in-law avoidance are widespread in North America, and hence of low diagnostic value, the flicker-quill headband, cocoon rattle, feather rope, and the Kuksu Cult traits are limited to California (Klimek, 1935, p. 57). In terms of his sequence of strata, Z, reflect- ing the expansion of the Penutian stock before its later differentiation, follows the Urkultur which Klimek identifies with the Hokan and Yuki language families. The Penutian ex- pansion is described as a migration from out- side central California which absorbed or shattered the Hokan continuity, and resulted in the conversion of the Central Valley into a Penutian province, with its constituent languages radiating from a focus in the Sacra- mento-San Joaquin delta in spokewise fashion. On the basis of the culture-elements he found to be closely associated with Penutian affilia- tion, Klimek rejected Sapir's idea of an orig- inally northern origin for the Californian Penutians, advanced mainly to explain the occurrence of the same stock in the Columbia Basin, but for which Sapir never published detailed evidence (Hoijer, 1946, p. 16). Klimek accepts one of Kroeber's suggestions of an eastern origin of the Californian Penutians. While such speculation may seem wholly in- substantial, Klimek felt enough assurance from his statistical correlations to state that the im- migrant Penutians "obviously already had a highly developed ceremonial life because we find among them the universality of cocoon rattle, splitstick rattle, yellowhammer [i.e. flicker] headband, and feather rope." Whether or not Kuksu elements were developed in the earliest phase of Penutian occupancy of central California, Klimek was unable to state, but he did guess that the Yokuts, who preserved the ritual elements involved in it-the cocoon rattle and flicker-quill headband-had been led to abandon specific Kuksu patterns because of later Shoshonean influences. The Shosho- nean expansion into southern California, which reached the coast and offshore islands, falls into Klimek's Period III, his stratum C,, and is attributed "to some sort of tension on the peripheral zone of Mexican civilization" (Klimek, 1935, pp. 65-66). It is regrettable that these brilliant hypothe- ses have never received adequate evaluation; Klimek greatly stimulated interest in statisti- cal approaches to ethnographic data while his tantalizing historical reconstructions were ig- nored. Lacking any comparably detailed reconstruc- tion of Californian pre-history, we may fol- low Klimek's lead at least so far as tentative acceptance of his suggestion that the flicker- quill headband is extremely ancient. Against this background we must devise one or more conceptual schemes into which the puzzling Colorado archaeological specimen can be fitted with the least revision of existing hypotheses concerning Great Basin and Southwestern culture history. If it is permissible to assume that linguistic continuities imply original cultural connections beyond the sharing of purely linguistic features, we may go further with Klimek's speculations. Klimek related stratum Z to the Penutian stock. Now Sapir, another formulator of broad hypotheses, postulated a Macro-Penutian lan- guage phylum, which, since it includes Uto- Aztekan, provides us with a continuous belt 152 [2, 1952</page><page sequence="7">FLICKER-QUILL HEADBANDS of related languages stretching from California to the Rio Grande drainage. If we may attri- bute to these hypothetical ancient Macro-Penu- tians the "highly developed ceremonial life" which Klimek has credited to their early cen- tral Californian representatives, we have the cultural bridge which might have linked Mantles cave, Colorado, to the Central Valley of California. It must be emphasized that we deal here not with evidence, but with tenuous hypotheses to fill an historical vacuum. The question, "Why, then, have the recent Basin groups not preserved the flicker-quill headband as have the Central Californians?" might be answered with Steward's theory that recent Basin Shoshonean culture does not rep- resent cultural fossil, a survival from an an- cient Uto-Aztekan sub-stratum, as some have claimed (Steward, 1940, pp. 476-479). The Basketmaker culture of the dry cave deposits of the eastern Basin and the Southwest deviates more from recent Shoshonean culture than from the ethnographic cultures of central Cali- fornia, at least in some particulars. The Basin Shoshoneans expanded eastward and north- ward, absorbing or replacing not only the people of the Promontory culture of the Salt Lake Basin, but the Puebloid cultures of the Northern Periphery, in relatively late times. Still more recently the Ute surged eastward into areas formerly held by the Fremont people and their successors (Stewart, 1942, p. 237). These speculations are offered in support of the notion that an old cultural continuum may have extended from central California to the Green River drainage, which contained a cere- monial complex made up in part of elements assigned by Klimek to his Californian stratum Z. Among possible factors which may have been involved in the ultimate rupture of this continuum and the disappearance of most of its elements east of the Sierras may have been the eastward and northward spread of the Shoshoneans, beginning at some time more than a thousand years ago; the oceanward expansion of the Shoshoneans into southern California took place still earlier. That these date-guesses are very modest can be seen by the radiocarbon datings of archaeological mate- rials from the Basin recently summarized by Heizer (1951, pp. 23-25). Instead of the foregoing house of cards, some may prefer the simple suggestion that the Mantles cave flicker-quill headband is a trade piece, indicative of sporadic contacts across the Basin from central California, 1000 or more years ago. Certain objections to this explana- tion have been mentioned above. On the other hand, stimulus diffusion could have accounted for the Colorado occurrence. This would pre- suppose nothing more than the transmission of the general idea of a flicker-quill headband, plus a few specific pointers on how to join the quills, and how to fasten the completed band to the wearer's head. One might con- ceive of a round trip journey of some people from the Fremont culture area across the Basin to the Californian flicker-quill headband area, who, upon their return, made some flashy headbands of their own, on the basis of what they could recall of the western trait. Finally, some might prefer to account for the Mantles cave headband by independent invention. Militating against this notion are the several specific technical features unlikely to have arisen spontaneously from the nature of the materials used. Admittedly, were we faced with the problem of the relationship between two equally similar headdresses from two widely separated continents, such as Australia and North America, we might be a little more willing to entertain the idea of independent invention. If a cultural connection of some kind is admitted between the ethnographic Californian headbands and the Mantles cave archaeologi- cal specimen, we may at least claim to have established a minimal dating for the appear- ance of this trait in central California. Of course, such a conclusion would be unwar- ranted if the dating of the Colorado specimen is incorrect, or if we prefer to consider the Colorado specimen as a prototype from which the Californian trait can be derived. The latter caveat is contradicted by every canon of the distributional method in ethnology and archae- ology, according to which the center of gravity for the flicker-quill headband trait must lie in central California. The dependence of our speculations on Klimek's constructs has not been a matter of preference for airy speculation, but has been forced by the lack of any other syntheses of western North American culture history suf- ficiently detailed to include the object on which we have focused attention. 153 HEWES]</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY BIBLIOGRAPHY Explanation of abbreviations used in Bibliography: UC-AR University of California, Anthropological Records, Berkeley.
