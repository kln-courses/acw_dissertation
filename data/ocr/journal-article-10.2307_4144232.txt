Trans.Vaughn Hart and Peter Hicks. New Haven:Yale University Press, 2001. 416 pp. $80.00. ISBN 0300085036. With this volume editorsVaughn Hart and Peter Hicks complete the first English trans- lation of Sebastiano Serlio's entire corpus, initiated by their Sebastiano Serlio on Architecture, Volume 1: Books I- V published in 1996. Unlike more widely read architectural treatises by Alberti and Palladio, Serlio's is an architectural tract aimed at the education of the architect rather than the patron, and for that reason one of the first to be written in the vernacular language and accompanied by large, scaled illustrations. Serlio shifted the aim of the archi- tectural treatise from theory to practice; centuries later these priorities tend to relegate Serlio to the idiosyncratic margins of traditional disciplinary narratives of art and architectural his- tory. Serlio himself seems to have anticipated criticism of his work from the contemporary intelligentsia, as the introduction essay to this volume explains. Serlio warned that his treatise might not satisfy the reader who desires to "know things in great detail and get to the bottom of every issue" (book 2, fol. 27r), a quality guaranteed not to endear him to academics. Indeed, the reception of Serlio among modern scholars has been divided between those who find his work original and novel, and those for whom it is unbearably prosaic. Against this backdrop, the material contained in Hart and Hicks's Sebastiano Serlio on Architecture, Volume 2, especially their provocative introduction, begins the process of repositioning Serlio in dis- courses of architectural history and ultimately in Europeanizing the Italian Renaissance. The contents of volume 2 comprise the most inventive books in Serlio's oeuvre. With book 4 "On Habitations," Serlio provided for the first time a complete range of architectural models for houses suited to persons of every rank of society for both rural and urban living. Book 7 "On Situations" (frequently translated as "On Accidents") addresses contemporary</page><page sequence="2">1242 Sixteenth CenturyJournal XXXIII/4 (2002) architectural difficulties that did not have antique precedents and provides models for recon- ciling practical problems, such as irregular topography, with the regularity demanded of clas- sical "worthy architecture." Serlio's "Castramentation of the Romans," tagged "Book VIII" by Serlio's publisher, consists of a commentary on Polybius's temporary Roman camp and the development of this camp into a walled city. These three books have occasionally been published, together and separately, in facsimile form from the manuscripts, most recently by Francesco Paolo Fiore as Sebasatiano Serlio:Architettura civile (1994), but this is the first time Serlio's texts have been annotated and translated into English. The final work, Serlio's "Extraordinary Book of Doors," extraordinary because it was outside the original seven- book project, is a collection of mannerist models for city gates first published simultaneously in Italy and France in 1551. Hart and Hicks's introductory essay is essential reading for future studies attempting to come to terms with Serlio's work in the complex cultural context of pre-Counter-Refor- mation Europe. Certainly, part of the frustration with Serlio rests in how little impact his experience in Rome with Bramante, Raphael, Michelangelo et al. in the first two decades of the sixteenth century seems to have had on this theoretical writing. Serlio was, after all, an eyewitness to this tremendously brief but revolutionary period that transfigured the his- tory of architecture but produced no written architectural theory of his own. Not only does Serlio's treatise not advance our understanding of this period; it is, by Hart and Hicks's own account, practically nonhumnanistic: anthropomorphic analogies, aesthetic purity, and divine theories of proportion are lacking. Serlio's approach to design is that of a problem solving engineer rather than architect shaping space as an organic whole.Among the more intriguing discussions concerns the absence of ideal urban plans in a treatise that surpasses all others in its promotion of appropriate housing for all circles of society inhabiting a city. In the final analysis, Hart and Hicks reposition Serlio as a "first modern" without ide- alizing him, portraying him as more than an adaptable pragmatist in a world previously enthralled by the abstract ideals of giants such as Alberti. Through the contextualization of his work politically and intellectually, Serlio emerges as an apolitical architect in a factional- ized world, a Catholic with reforming Evangelical leanings, someone more comfortable with Machiavelli than Moore. It is argued that Serlio is modernly relativist, mixing modern with ancient, Egyptian with Roman; exploring the "harmonious discord" of opposites; extending classical ideals to humble vernacular dwellings; accepting stylistic impurities (not without reservations). Hart and Hicks redirect the reader from the greater metanarrative of architec- tural history to an alternate history of ideas, one in which Serlio's work, as practical a "man- ual" as he intended it to be, becomes a sophisticated "treatise." Thanks to their two-volume set, more scholars and students have gained access to the debate. Kim Sexton ............................... University of Arkansas</page></plain_text>
