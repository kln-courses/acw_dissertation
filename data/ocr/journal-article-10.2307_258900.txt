<plain_text><page sequence="1">CALL FOR BOOK NOTES The Editor of the Academy of Management Review's Book Re- view Section has developed a "Readers Are Reading" section. The objective of this section is to cover more books and high- light books that the Academy of Management members are reading. The section consists of brief notes on recent management books that are not reviewed in the Book Review Section. In the AMR Book Review Section we are able to publish detailed reviews of only 20 books per year (out of nearly 500 received). This section is one way to bring more books to the attention of our read- ers. I invite members of the Academy to send me their contributions for this section. A contribution should be in the form of a 75-word note describing the book's content or key arguments. The notes should be descriptive, accurate, and not evaluative. The book should be of academic interest and make contributions to manage- ment theory. It should be published in 1994 or forthcoming (but with an ISBN assigned). Notes from authors (and publishers) on their own books are not acceptable. Please provide a complete citation for the book in the following format: Title, by Author(s)/Editor(s). Place; Publisher, Publication Date. The Book Review Editor will select the notes that will be in- cluded in the section based on the appropriateness of the book, bal- anced coverage of Academy Divisions/Interest Groups, and the qual- ity of the notes. Please send two copies of your contribution to: Professor Paul Shrivastava Book Review Editor, Academy of Management Review Department of Management, Bucknell University Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA.

Manuscripts pub- lished in a Special Topic Forum are subjected to the same review procedures and evaluation standards as any other article pub- lished in the journal, with two exceptions: (a) authors who wish to have a manuscript considered for a Special Topic Forum must indicate this when they submit manuscripts for review and (b) manuscripts must be received on or before the date specified in the Call for Papers. Topic: Management History. The scientific analysis of man- agement is less than 100 years old. Indeed, the vast majority of management journals have been in print for less than 50 years. Yet management practice has defined human history for thou- sands of years. For this Special Topic Forum, we seek papers that examine the development of the scientific record on management thinking, as well as the principles and practices of management revealed throughout the course of human history. Have we been inadvertently rediscovering well-established principles of orga- nizing during the past 100 years? Have we uncritically woven many now out-of-date ideas into our contemporary thinking? Our intent for this Special Topic Forum is to place our con- temporary understanding of management in its proper historical context. The scope of possible relevant topics is broad. We wel- come papers that consider the influence of particular individuals (both theorists and practitioners), companies, technologies (e.g., unions, consulting firms), events (e.g., wars, trade agreements), and/or institutions (e.g., church, military, banking) on contempo- rary management thinking and practice worldwide. Papers that examine the reciprocal influences of the classical arts, music, literature, and science on management would be welcomed. We also welcome discussions of how an understanding of manage- ment history might improve management teaching, research, and consulting. Papers that discuss historical research methodology 246</page><page sequence="3">and its application to the field of management would be appro- priate, also. Procedures for Submitting Manuscripts: To be considered for publication in this Special Topic Forum, manuscripts must be re- ceived by April 1, 1995. Details concerning AMR's submission pro- cedures and evaluation criteria are printed in all issues of the journal in a section titled, Information for Contributors. Instruc- tions for manuscript preparation are provided in the Academy of Management Review Style Guide for Authors, printed in the Jan- uary 1995 issue of the journal. Authors should consult both docu- ments and follow them closely when submitting manuscripts. Request for Volunteer Reviewers: If you are interested in serv- ing as an ad hoc reviewer for this Special Topic Forum, please send the Editor a letter describing your areas of expertise and reviewing experience. 247</page><page sequence="4">c Academy of Management Review 1995, Vol. 20, No. 1, 248-254. STYLE GUIDE FOR AUTHORS ARTICLES Submit six copies of the manuscript; be sure that they are good, clear copies and that all pages are included in each copy. The manuscript should be typed on standard size (81/2" x 11") paper, double-spaced throughout (including footnotes, references, quotations, and appendixes), and with wide margins (one inch or more) at top, bottom, and both sides of each page. Double-sided copies are acceptable for the initial review process. For accepted manuscripts, the final copies must be single-sided. Manuscripts prepared on computers should be printed on letter quality printers or, if other printers are used, in double-strike or enhanced print. Footnotes, references, appendixes, tables, and figures should be on sep- arate sheets of paper and should be arranged at the end of the manuscript in the order listed in this sentence. The length of articles should not exceed 45 manuscript pages, including references, appendixes, tables, and figures. Title Page and Abstract The first page of the manuscript should include the title of the article (typed in all capital letters), the authors' names (typed in all capitals), and their affiliations, addresses, and phone numbers (typed with initial caps only). Example: AUTHORITY AT WORK: INTERNAL MODELS AND THEIR ORGANIZATIONAL CONSEQUENCES WILLIAM A. KAHN KATHY E. KRAM Boston University Department of Organizational Behavior 621 Commonwealth Avenue Boston, MA 02215 USA (419) 354-1920 No mention of authors' names should be made in the body of the paper, except where appropriate in citations and references. The second page, numbered page 2, should repeat the title and in- clude an abstract of 75 or fewer words. The text of the article should begin on page 3. Page numbering should continue through all pages of the manuscript, including those with footnotes, references, appendixes, ta- bles, and figures. 248</page><page sequence="5">1995 Volume 20, Number 1 249 Acknowledgments An unnumbered footnote can be used to acknowledge financial sup- port and/or assistance of others in preparing the manuscript. In the manu- script, the text for this footnote should appear at the bottom of the same page as the title (page 1). Footnotes Other footnotes should be used sparingly. Minimize their use for par- enthetical discussion; material that is pertinent can often be integrated into the text. They should not be used for citing references (see Refer- ences, which follows). The text for all footnotes should appear on a sep- arate page or pages at the end of the body of the article. Headings Main headings should be used to designate the major sections of the article; three or four main headings should be sufficient for most articles. Initial headings, such as "Introduction," are unnecessary. Main headings should be centered on the page and typed in all capitals. They should not be underlined. Example: INTERNAL MODELS OF AUTHORITY Secondary headings should be typed flush with the left margin and in small letters, with major words beginning with capitals. Secondary head- ings should not be underlined. Example: Dependent Model of Authority Third-order or paragraph headings should begin with a standard paragraph indention and be typed in capital and small letters, with only the initial word capitalized. Paragraph headings should be followed by a period; they should not be underlined. Example: Task performance. How hard organization members work on assigned tasks is traditionally understood.... The text should follow on the same line. Tables and Figures Useful tables and figures do not duplicate the text; they supplement and clarify it. Because tables and figures are considerably more expen- sive to prepare for publication than text, the degree to which they add to the impact of the manuscript should be considered carefully. Tables should be typed, double-spaced, on separate pages (one page for each table) from the text. They should be grouped together following the appendixes. If there is no appendix, tables should follow the refer- ences. In AMR, tables are often used to efficiently summarize the works of other authors or to present a list of propositions or implications that follow from the author's arguments. Each table should have the word TABLE</page><page sequence="6">250 Academy of Management Review January (typed in all caps) and its number (arabic numerals) centered at the top. The table title should be in capital and small letters and centered on the page directly under the table number; it should not be underlined. Example: TABLE 1 Financial Impact of Profit Sharing Tables should be numbered consecutively from the beginning to the end of the article. The position of the table in the manuscript should be indicated in the text as follows: Insert Table 1 about here Footnotes to tables are of two types: (1) General footnotes that explain the table as a whole, the designa- tions of table columns or rows, or an individual item. All of these should be designated by superscript small letters (a b c) with the footnotes for each separate table beginning with a. (2) Footnotes used to indicate the level of significance should follow any other footnotes and be designated by one or more asterisks: * for p &lt; .05, ** for p &lt; .01, and *** for p &lt; .001. Use a dagger symbol (t) for p &lt; .10. Figures are any illustrations other than tables. Authors should be prepared to supply finished camera-ready artwork for all figures at the time the manuscript is accepted for publication. Unless the authors are highly skilled in graphics, a professional drafting service should be em- ployed to prepare figures. The spacing and lettering used in figures should allow for subse- quent reduction in size by as much as 50 percent so that the figure will fit the size of the Review's page. The original artwork for figures should not be submitted until after the manuscript has been accepted for publica- tion. Figures should be numbered consecutively with arabic numerals and their position in the text indicated as for tables (see above). Example: Insert Figure 1 about here Each figure should be presented on a separate page with FIGURE (typed in all caps) and its number centered above it and a short identify- ing title in capital and small letters centered underneath the figure num- ber. Example: FIGURE 1 Relationship Between Expected Return and Risk Factor References An alphabetically ordered list of references cited in the text should be included at the end of the article. References should begin on a separate page headed REFERENCES. Continue the pagination.</page><page sequence="7">1995 Volume 20, Number 1 251 Entries in the list of References should be alphabetized by the last name of the author (first author if more than one) or editor, or by the corporate author (U.S. Census Bureau) or periodical name (Wall Street Journal) if there is no indication of individual authors or editors. Several references by an identical author (or group of authors) are ordered by year of publication, with the earliest listed first. Multiple references to works by one author or group of authors with the same year of publication should be differentiated with the addition of small letters (a, b, etc.) after the year. Authors' names are repeated for each entry. Citations to references should be designated throughout the text by enclosing the authors' names and the year of the reference in parenthe- ses. Example: Several studies (Adams, 1974; Brown &amp; Hales, 1975, 1980; Collins, 1976a,b) support this conclusion. Note the use of alphabetical order and an ampersand in citations. Page numbers must be included in a citation to provide the exact source of a direct quotation. Page numbers follow the date of publication given in parentheses and are separated from it by a colon. Example: Adams has said that writing a book is "a long and arduous task" (1974: 3). They should also be used when specific arguments or findings of authors are paraphrased or summarized. As indicated in the example, if the name of the author occurs in the body of the sentence, only the year of publi- cation is cited in parentheses. Otherwise, both name and date appear in parentheses, separated by a comma. If a work has two authors, always cite both names every time the work is cited in the text. If the work has more than two authors, cite all authors the first time the reference occurs; in subsequent citations of the same work, include only the surname of the first author followed by "et al." (not underlined) and the year. Examples: Few field studies use random assignment (Franz, Johnson, &amp; Schmidt, 1976). (first citation) ... even when random assignment is not possible" (Franz et al., 1976: 23). (subsequent citation) However, for works with six or more authors, use only the surname of the first author followed by et al. whenever the work is cited. Book entries in the list of references follow this form: Authors' or Editors' Last Names, Initials. Year. Title of book. (Book titles are under- lined and typed in lower case letters except for the first word and the first word after a colon.) City Where Published, State or Country (only if nec- essary to identify the city; U.S. Postal Service abbreviations should be used for state identification): Name of Publisher. Examples: Boulding, K.

If necessary, such explanations can be presented in one or more appendixes at the end of the article. This material should be pre- sented in as condensed a form as possible; full sentences are not neces- sary. No tables should be included in the appendixes. A single appendix</page><page sequence="10">254 Academy of Management Review January should be titled APPENDIX in all caps. If more than one appendix is needed, they should be titled and ordered alphabetically: APPENDIX A, APPENDIX B, etc. Biographical Sketches At the time an article is accepted for publication, a brief biographical sketch of 50 or fewer words should be submitted for each author. It should include where highest degree was earned, present position, affiliation, and current research interests. For example: Andrea Barber received her Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin. She is an associate pro- fessor of management and Director of the Management Improvement Center at Famous University, Oxbridge, Ohio. Her current research interests include dual-career families and sociotechnical systems in organizations. Avoidance of Sexist and Other Biased Language Authors must avoid terms or usages that are or may be interpreted as denigrating to ethnic or other groups. Authors should be particularly care- ful in dealing with gender, where long-established customs (e.g., "usu- ally if the employee is given an opportunity, he will make the right choice") can imply the acceptance of inequality where none exists. Using plural pronouns (e.g., changing the "client . .. he" to "clients . .. they") is preferred by Academy publications. If this is not possible, the phrase "he or she" can and should be used. Use of First Person Vigorous, direct, clear, and concise communication should be the objective of all articles in Academy journals. Although third-person style traditionally has been used, authors can use the first person and active voice if they do not dominate the communication. Anthropomorphism In the field of management, authors often use phrases like "organi- zational theory (OT) says," "OT suggests," or "OT proposes." Technically, it is wrong to attribute human functions to nonhuman sources. However, authors accept the fact that OT doesn't literally act, sug- gest, think, and so forth. The convention is used as a cryptic form for stating conclusions from a body of knowledge. Reference to the authors of this material is implied. Thus, an occasional usage is fine, but if this convention is sloppily or excessively used, AMR will definitely change it.</page><page sequence="11">Statement of Ownership, Management, and Circulation 1.

Ulmer, Jr. Applied Research Award The Center for Creative Leadership is launching this new award to stimulate outstanding field research and its creative applica- tion to the practice of leadership. The award is named in honor of Walter F. Ulmer, Jr., recently retired President and CEO, Center for Creative Leadership. Focus is on action research in applied settings. The research should be in the domain of leadership and should be innovative, with an emphasis on field research and application. The descrip- tion of the creative application will be as important as the re- search itself, and this will be reflected in the judging of submis- sions. Research must have been conducted within the last two years, and must not have been previously published. Center staff and submissions to other Center awards are ineligible. Judging Criteria: (1) Appropriateness of topic (fit with research award focus, relevance to needs faced by practitioners) (2) Qual- ity of research (consideration of relevant literature; soundness of method and analysis; innovativeness of research) (3) Application value (clarity and significance of research application and con- clusions; implications to practice in terms of "So what?", and "Who cares?"). First prize will include $1,500 and a trip to the Center to present research in a colloquium. The Center also will provide editorial assistance for finding appropriate publication outlets. Addition- ally, a prize of $750 will be awarded for a paper judged as deserv- ing honorable mention status. Four copies of an article-length paper should be submitted. The full papers are limited to 30 double-spaced pages (including title page, abstract, tables, notes and references) and should be pre- pared according to the third edition of the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association. Entries must be received by March 31, 1995. The winning papers will be announced by May 31, 1995. Entries should be submitted to Dr. David Noer, Vice Pres- ident, Training and Education or Dr. Walter Tornow, Vice Presi- dent, Research and Publication, Center for Creative Leadership, One Leadership Place, P.O.
