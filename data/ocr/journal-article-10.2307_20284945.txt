<plain_text><page sequence="1">CIRCUMCISION AND CLITORIDECTOMY AS PRACTISED BY THE NATIVES OP BRITISH EAST AFRICA. The interesting review in the iseue of the British Medical Journal for December 24th, 1904, of Dr. J. G. Frazer's article on the origin of circumcision, published in the Inde pendent Revie?o for November, bas tempted me to hunt up some notes made in my diary when on a shooting trip in 1902 in the Uganda Protectorate. The following description of the operations of circumcision and clitoridectomy, as performed by the natives of British East Africa, is culled partly from these notes, but to a greater extent from data which I have obtained from some descriptive articles upon the customs and habits of certain tribes of British East Africa, published by Messrs. C. W. Hobley, A.M.I.C.E., Geologist to the I.B.E.A. Company; H. R. T?te, Acting Subcommissioner, Kenya District, B.E. A. ; and S. Bagge, Subcommissioner, B.E.A.1 Amongst the Kikuyu.an uncircumcised boy is called a Jcah?y after circumcision the youth is known as a mwanake. A girl, prior to removal of the clitoris, is called a karegu ; after the operation ?he is eligible for marriage and is known as a mwiretu. A married woman goes by the name of muhiki, and is entitled to wear a "tail" or "mkia"(at least amongst the Nilotic and Bantu tribes). A mutumia is a primiparous woman. Similar appellations are made use of by neighbour ing tribes. Circumcision and clitoridectomy, amongst the Masai and Kavirondos, are great ceremonial events extending over a period of many months and occurring but once every six to eight years. Circumcision. The boy, who has for several days been smeared all over with a mixture of white clay and fat, is, on the night previous to the operation, shaved over the whole body, excepting the eyelashes, and his finger nails are cut short. Just before dawn, on the following morning, he bathes in a pool and returns to the kraal, outside of which he awaits events. When the sun rises, the boy's mother spreads a skin on the ground inside the kraal. The operator, who is known as the andorobo, as well as all those about to assist at the operation, are anointed upon the nose and forehead with a streak of white clay. The boy is then made to sit upon the skin, the legs apart and the arms held behind him by one of the assistants. The operator takes up a position between the boy's legs and marks a white line with the clay upon the external surface of the prepuce at the level of the corona glandis. The foreskin is pulled back and the fraenum preputii scarified with the point of the knife so as to give free play to the parts. The operator's finger is then passed between the prepuce and the dorsal surface of theglans penis and a trans verse incision is made just below the white line of clay. Through the opening thus formed in the prepuce is forced tbe glans penis, and the latter is retained in position by means of the long thorn of the ol-oimorouyai tree. The redundant prepuce is then cut off. The wound is cleansed with milk and water. The foreskin is carefully preserved, as it is believed, that anyone stealing it can cause the boy's death. During con valescence the boy is kept at rest and fed on a mixture of milk and bullock's blood. Next day he is washed all,over with a decoction.of the ol-oimorouyai tree; Only males ate allowed to witness the operation. An uncircumcised youth is not permitted to have con nexion with an unclitbridectomized girl, though he is allowed free intercourse with a girl that has been operated upon.

The ceremony is invariably carried out at sunrise during full moon. The girl's head is shaved and oiled the night before the operation, and she is solemnly warned by all the young male warriors that if she winces or cries out during the operation she will be disgraced amongst women and expelled the settlement. At dawn the girl is laid out on a skin in a reclining position, her head and shoulders resting in the lap of an old woman, while two other attendants seize each knee. The young and old of both sexes are allowed to witness the opera tion, and stand around in a circle. The pudenda are sprinkled with powdered wood ashes, and the operator, an old woman, taking a sickle-shaped knife with a blade about 1.5 in. in length, removes the labia minora and clitoris, while all the old women run round crying out, in order to drown any noise the patient may unavoidably make. Milk is then poured over the wound. Amongst the Nandi and Masai, the clitoris is removed, but not the labia minora, and women only are allowed actually to witness the operation, the men standing around in a circle some little distance away from the women. Recovery is complete in about a month, and ill effects are the exception. After this operation the woman is eligible for marriage. A child born to an unclitoridectomized Nandi girl is killed. A married woman wears the "tail" or "mkia" just over the cleft of the buttocks, and this is a most important article of drees. C. W. Hobley says that if a married woman runs out of her house in a hurry?say because she has been beaten? and goes into another house without the tail, the house she enters is considered unclean, and the husband has to give a goat, which is killed on the doorstep of that house, before it is considered to be puri fied ;-the meat is divided between the aggressor and the owner of the house. It is interesting to note that? as in the case of the male, the portion excised is carefully guarded, and mischief to the individual is believed to be certain to follow the loss or theft of the part. Remarks. I have not heard of any tribes in the British Protectorate of East Africa who hang the excised foreskins on trees and bushes, or conceal them in holes, as Dr. Frazer says is the custom among the Warramunga and Unmatjera tribes of Australia. I am informed, however, by an officer who accom panied the Brass River expedition on the west coast of Africa, that he saw just outside one of the native villages a tree from whijh were suspended numerous recently-amputated foreskins. It is highly probable that the ultimate OTigih of circum cision and clitorideetomy rites, as practised by these African tribes, was sacrifice to the local god or gods. In prehistoric times the ape-like ancestors of man lived in families or small communities. A member of the primitive tribe who proved unruly or d angerous, or who, through carelessness or impru dence, brought trouble to the home, would be set upon and severely punished, sometimes with death. Even at the present day, the leader of a tribe of baboons bent on a marauding expedition will cuff the head of a noisy incautious youngster to enforce care and silence. As the centuries rolled by, and intelligence slowly increased, a cause for the various catastrophes and disasters would be sought. Some being, like unto themselves, only very terrible, fercer, and invisible, would be thought to be the cause of the thunder and lightning, the.earthquake, storm and flood. The death of the natural victims of these phe nomena would be thought to have appeased the wrathful god. The next step in the evolution o? the religion of man would be that of anticipating )he anger of the god, and so averting disaster by sacrificing Certain individuals to him? note that the primitive god was generally of the male persuasion. Thus arose, in all likelihood, the custom of sac rificing living men to an angry and jealous divinity, and it i? significant that, in biblical times, *' males without blemish " were the chosen victims. As the value of human life came to ' b? better recognized, and the rights of the individual became asserted, and simultaneously the ferocity of the primitive god decreased, a part instead of the whole of the individual would be sacrificed. In this way arose, I think, the custom of ablating certain portions of the male and female anatomy. The excised nymphae, clitoris, and preputium were the humble propitiatory offerings of primitive man to a terror striking anthropomorphic deity. -' C; Ma?sh Beadnell, " * * ^._;; .-..-? * Fleet Surgeon, RN. * \</page></plain_text>
