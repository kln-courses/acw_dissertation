It's not every day that I get a chance to converse with such a distinguished interlocutor in public, and I hope to do justice to the impor tant issues Ann raised in her comment. Since space is limited, I will focus on a few points of clarification, and then respond as well as I can to Ann's challenge to improve my formulation. First, I want to reiterate that I don't see the "Skinnerian" label applying to any single author. The term refers to the much broader situa tionalist, "moments and their men" Zeitgeist in sociology that Colin Campbell and others have analyzed so incisively. Talk of Love {TofL) may indeed go beyond this view, for example, in its treatment of identity. But while the idea that people act based on "who they already think they are" (Swidler, 2001:87) seems promising, I am not sure how to understand this in light of the additional claim that "one of the cultural tools [people] may pick up or put down is precisely the kind of self they inhabit" (Swidler, 2001:24). In any case, the major focus in TofL, and in Ann's comment, is on how "people are cued to frame or recognize what sort of situation they are in." I agree with this, with only one caveat: different kinds of people, even in the same society, can respond quite differently to the same cues and this, too, can be cultural. Evangelical conservative parents and nonreligious liberal parents?even assuming they are alike in every other respect?would likely frame the situation quite differently if, for instance, their 16-year-old daughter became pregnant. Even within the institutional constraints shared by both families, these different framings would likely lead to the pursuit of different cultural equipment and thus 1 Department of Sociology, University of California, Berkeley, 410 Barrows Hall, Berkeley, California 94720-1980; e-mail: vaiseys@gmail.com. 619 0884-8971/08/0300-0031/0 ? 2008 Eastern Sociological Society</page><page sequence="2">620 Vaisey toward different strategies of action. In this regard, attending to the person-context dyad seems a more promising explanatory approach than considering contexts?or persons?alone. Second, I want to clarify the meaning of "moral intuitions." I follow Jonathan Haidt (2007:998), who defines them as "fast, automatic, and (usually) affect-laden processes in which an evaluative feeling of good-bad or like-dislike (about the actions or character of a person) appears in con sciousness without any awareness of having gone through steps of search, weighing evidence, or inferring a conclusion." I don't claim that all intu itions are moral. Ann doesn't like worm snacks, but she probably doesn't mind that other people do. Yet when we hear about someone committing a gratuitous act of violence, cheating on their spouse, or marrying some one they don't love for money, most of us don't think "to each his own" or even "that's weird"; we think "that's not right." And though it may be difficult for some of us to believe, there are cultures?and subcultures within U.S. culture?in which these types of intuitions apply to obeying one's parents, to the "proper" roles of men and women, to treating one's body as a temple, and to many other domains. My concern is not whether such intuitions are "really moral" (they clearly are for some) but, rather, with the origins and consequences of a particular class of judgments. Third, I argued in my essay that moral intuitions don't come out of thin air but, like aesthetic tastes, are grounded in experiences internalized in different kinds of institutional settings. In my research, differences in family practices, religion, and media consumption seem most responsible for "training the elephant." More research is certainly needed to figure out how, in Bourdieu's (1990:54) words, "experiences [are] deposited in each organism in the form of schemes of perception, thought and action." But watching Disney movies with my daughter has given me some idea about the role of cultural products in shaping moral biases. If Ariel in The Little Mermaid needs to leave her family and community to go "wanderin' free" on land in order to find true love, might I not need to defy my family and leave my ethnic or religious community to find my authentic self? (The burden of "transposition" here is pretty light.) Per haps, as advertisers seem to know, intense, emotional music and cute anthropomorphic animals enhance the ability of media to train feelings and intuitions directly, bypassing conscious reasoning. All this is specula tive for now, but my larger point is that institutions are saturated with implicit cultural messages about the "good life," right and wrong, and so on, and that these are most likely internalized in a process similar to the development of aesthetic tastes. Fourth, I attempted (unsuccessfully?) to show that I think the reper toire model is a model of culture's influence on action in at least two</page><page sequence="3">Reply to Ann Swidler 621 ways: first, if I don't possess the cultural skills to justify an action to my interlocutors, I will be unlikely to do it; and second, if I don't have the cultural equipment to undertake a particular action, I will be unable to do it. I therefore agree that what people are "good at" is an important deter minant of what they do. This last point leads me to attempt to reformulate my argument using Ann's preferred terms?values and skills. I think there is actually a straightforward (albeit highly simplified) way to put these two together in a way that preserves the strengths of both: 1. The mastery of specific cultural skills is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for generating specific lines of action. 2. Culturally meaningful contexts tend to evoke the deployment of some skills and make others less useable, but 3. One's "values" (primarily in the form of moral intuitions) interact with contexts to modify the probability that some skills rather than others will be deployed from the repertoire. 4. Within the limits imposed by (a) one's existing repertoire and (b) one's current context, moral intuitions influence (c) selection into future con texts and (d) the pursuit of new skills available within those contexts. This formulation is not perfect, but it has a few advantages. It acknowledges that people know more culture than they use and offers hypotheses about why they use what they do. It also respects that values without skills cannot lead to action. Perhaps most important, it may be able to handle something that repertoire theory cannot?what one might call "upstream" lines of action. These are trajectories that actively aban don the use of mastered skills to develop new ones. The decision to "come out" is a good example. Why would someone who has "trained" their whole life to acquire the cultural skills needed to enact a heterosexual identity choose to reject them in order to acquire new skills? I don't know the answer, but one good starting point might be the modern ethic of self expression and authenticity. "Following your heart" and "being who you really are" are powerful cultural ideals in our society, though they are not uniformly internalized and?especially in some subcultures?are moder ated by other, possibly contrary, ideals. Of course, no ideal by itself would be sufficient to produce an "upstream" line of action (that would violate Proposition 1!), but this formulation suggests that moral ideals are impor tant elements in explaining them. It also offers insight into why people do what they do when there are institutional "cross-currents" of comparable strength. Divorce, for instance, is just as institutionalized today as marriage. Is there a way that culture might help explain why some divorce and others don't? Given a</page><page sequence="4">622 Vaisey dual-process twist, I think the notion of identity?who people think they are?can be quite useful here. My hypothesis is that while most Americans can and do rely alternately on TofUs utilitarian, disciplined, and attuned scripts for articulating their moral identities, one of these will provide a more "comfortable fit" with how each person's intuitions about himself or herself have been shaped over a lifetime. This will lead to the preferred script's disproportionate deployment and thus?over time?toward differ ent strategies for dealing with a troubled marriage. So where does all this leave the dual-process model of culture in action? Hopefully, in better shape than it was a few pages ago. Is it possi ble that Ann and I could agree that the repertoire model provides an excellent account of the necessary conditions enabling action (both institu tional and individual), while the dual-process model provides a needed account of why people use (and pursue) some skills and not others when there is more than one possibility? I really hope so. If nothing else, how ever, I am excited that we and others are working toward a common goal: an empirically grounded, explanatory sociology of culture.
