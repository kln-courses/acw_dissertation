<plain_text><page sequence="1">( 20 ) REPORT ON THE ETHNOLOGY OF THE SICIATL OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, A COAST DIVISION OF THE SALISH STOCK. By CHARLES HILL TOUT, Local Correspondent of the Anthropological Institute. [WlTH PLATE J.] THE following notes are a summary of my studies among the Sfciatl. I have been enabled to coinplete them earlier, and in a more exhaustive manner than I could otherwise have done, by a timely grant of ?40 from the Royal Society. By means of this help I was able to spend the greater portion of a month among them in the summer of 1902, visiting their different settlemenits and gathering all information now available from the most reliable and authentic sources. With the exception perhaps of a few folk-tales, I believe these notes record all that may now be gathered of the past concerning this tribe. Of all the niative races of this province, they are probably the most modified by white influenlces. They are now, outwardly at least, a civilized people, and their lives and conditiou compare favourably with those of the better class of peasants of Western Europe. Their permanent tribal home, or headquarters, contains about a htindred well-built cottages,-many of them two-storied, anid some of them having as many as six rooms. Each house has its own garden-plot attached to it, in which are grown European fruits and vegetables. In the centre of the villacre, and dominiating the whole, stands an imposing church, which cost the tribe nearly $8,000 a few years ago. Near by, they have also a commnodious and well-built meeting-room, or puLblic hall, capable of holding 500 persons or more, and a handsotmie pavilion or band-stand fronts the bay. They possess also a convenient and effective waterworks system of their own. The water has been brought in iron pipes from a mountain stream some three miles off, and every street has its hydrants at intervals of 40 or 50 yards. From these, the water is easily carried into the houses in pails. As a body, the Siciatl are, without doubt, the mnost industrious and prosperous of all the native peoples of this province. The men engage either in fishing or lumbering the whole year round. Some of them are also expert hunters, and during the season ship a great number of deer to the Vancouver market, their territory abounding in game of that kind. Respecting their improved condition, their tribal and individual prosperity, highly moral character, and orderly conduct, it is only right to say that they owe it mainly, if not entirely, to the Fathers of the Oblate Mission, and particularly to the late Bishop Durieu, who more than forty years ago went first among them and</page><page sequence="2">C. HILL ToUT.-BReport on the Ethnology of the S'ciatl of British Columbia, etc. 21 won them to the Roman Catholic faith. And most devout and reverent converts have they become, cheerfully and generously sustaining the Mission in their midst, and supplying all the wants of the Mission Fathers when amongst them. ETHNOGRAPHY AND SOCIOLOGY. The tribe, as at present constituted, numbers some three hundred and twenty- five souls, between sixty and seventy of whom are adult males. It is a very difficult matter to get the exact number of aniy Indian settlement. Census-taking is something entirely foreign to the native mind, and no inhabitant of a native village, even when it contains less than a score of souls, can tell one offhand the number of adult males living in it. Wheii questioned upon the point, they have to count them off by name upon their fingers, and are then as likely to overlook some as to give an accurate total. The Sfciatl are obviously a mixed people. The facial types amolng them would make this quite clear, even if we had no evidence of the fact in their traditions and genealogies. At the time when the late Bishop Durieu first came among them in the early sixties of the last century, they were divided into four septs or sub-tribes, each having its own settlement and fishing and huntina grounds. These were in the neighbourhood of Sechelt peninsula, the neck of which commences about twenty or thirty miles above the entrance to Howe Sound, the waters of the neighbouring Sk-qomic. The present Mission, or headquarters of the united tribe, situated on Trail Bay on the outer side of the neck of the peninsula, is of modern origin, dating only fromn Bishop Durieu's time. Prior to that, though a most desirable and sheltered spot, fear of the blood-lhirsty, marauding YuikEltds (a Kwakiutl subdivision) prevented them from making a permanent settlement here. Kniown to them by the iiame of -TcatElItc (= " outside water ") it formed a temporary halting place and general rendezvous for the tribe, Here the different septs sometimes met for a common hunt. The neck at this poinlt formed also a portage to the divisions living on the inner waters, and made a short, cut for them to the Gulf, being only eleven hundred yards wide at this point. The following are the names and settlements of the old divisions of the tribe:- QI'NETCIN, at the head. of Queen's Reach. TsONAI, at Deserted Bay, the junction of Queen's Reach and Princess Royal Reach. TUJWANEKQ, at head of Narrow's Arm. SQAIAQOS with many settlements, but no fixed abode. Of the above four subdivisions, the two foriner are said to be of extraneous origin, being founded by men of Kwakiutl lineage. The two latter represent the true Sfciatl. Etegarding these septs separately, the Tsonai now number about forty souls. I gathered from the chief and his brother all that is now known of their ancestry and past. They have a genealogical table, extending back to the sixth generation, that is, to their TOPIYUK. The genealogical lists of all the Sfciatl</page><page sequence="3">22 C. HILL ToUT.-J?eport on the 1thnology of the Siciatl of divisions stop at this point. They have no memories or traditions of aniything beyond. The T6PIYUK is always with them the " first-nman." The followinig is the genealogical table of the Tsonai chiefs:- Q6lalin I. Qalalin II. eldest son of Qo1lalin I. Tcauk-st I. eldest son of Qo5lalin IL Unakwatcl, husband of Tselapolt, eldest danghter of Tcauk-st L' TcAuk-st II. eldest son of Unakwatci. Otlken, second son of Unakwatci and present chief of the Tsonai. It would appear from the family traditions that Q6laliii I. was not originally a chief of the Tsonai. It is related that he acquired the chieftaincy by excelling all others in " potlatching"; and he is said to come from Fort Rupert.' His name bears witness to his greatness in this line, the term being derived froin the root Q6tsot, " to hold in a bundle," or " press down," i.e., all other competitors. He was a man of great wealth. He possessed a kind of Fortunatus' p urse in the form of a teteletc ="increasing." This was described to me as a kind of baby that he found in the forest one day and took home and placed in a box, which immediately became filled with potlatch treasures of all kinds. Hence his ability to excel in potlatches, and hence his name. He possessed also a large house called Kw6sen-autQ=' star house," so named because the roof was constructed in such a manner that the stars could be seen through numerous small holes in it. No rain ever came in through these star-holes. Adorning the structure were many squtk', that is, carvings and paintings of animals. I was assured that these squtku were in no way totemnistic in character, nothing corresponding to the totem crests or symbols of the northern tribes being known among the old Sf ciatl according to all my informants. They were simnply symbolical of the social status of the owner. The figures were such as in the native mind typified greatness, loftiness, strength, power, wisdom, anld so on; such as the eagle, the raven, the bear, the whale, and the beaver; and their number and variety on a man's house or belongings marked the measure of his ability to excel in potlatching. Only men of acknowledged position in the tribe ever ventured to decorate their houses with such carvings or paintings. The ridicule of their fellows effectually prevented any mnan from undeservedly acquiring these distinictions. When Qollin was advanced in years, he became desirouis of securinig his eldest son's succession to the chieftaincy; and to ensure this he gave a great feast, publicly resigned the chieftaincy, and nominated his sonL as chief in his stead, giving him at the same time his namne and all his wealth. As no one could now I A Kwakiulk settlement.</page><page sequence="4">British Columbia, a Coast Division of the Salish Stock. 23 dispute his claims to the office, Qolalin II. was acknowledged chief of the tribe. He took to himnself nine wives, by whom he had 6pedall tu-lkwEls, " ten offspring." When he became aged, he followed his father's example, gave a great feast, and distributed many presents. At the close of the feast, he led forward his sons and daughters, anid declared his eldest son chief in his stead. His name was Tcauk st which signifies of clean or lionourable descent; implying by this that his parentage was above reproach, that he had no slave blood, or dog-blood, or other animal blood in his veins. He was regarded by all as " planted " firmly or deeply in the headship of the tribe. Tcaukst had one wife only, by whom he had s6latsalI tu-ikwEls, two sons and three daughters. His sons both dying, when he reached a ripe old age, he gave a great feast and named his eldest daughter Tselapolt as his successor and chieftainess of the tribe. Later she married Unakwvatci, and he, taking his wife's rank and privileges, became a chief. By the help of his father-in-law, he gave many potlatches, and was acknowledged as supreme chief. It was during the chieftaincy of UnakwatcT that Bishop Durieu came first among the Slciatl. He was welcomed by this chief, and in return, it is reported, the bishop gave UnakwatcI a bell, and made him and his successors hereditary chiefs of the Church which he established in their midst. Unakwatcl had seven children, two boys and five girls. When he was advanced in years, the bishop made him " sit dowin," and ntamed his son Teauk st as chief in his stead. But Tcauk-st's mind becoming unbalanced later, he was set aside, and UnakwatcI was reinstated in the office, which he held to the time of his death. As his successor, the bishop appointed his second son Otlken, the present occupant of the office. I have thought it worth while to give the family history of the Tsonai chiefs as they gave it to me, because of the sidelight it thr6ws upon important practices and customs. In addition to the above genealogical table of the Tsonai chiefs, I obtained the pedigrees of the chiefs of the SqalaQos and Tfiwa'nokQ. It is worthy of remark as showing how deeply their modern enlvironment has modified their lines, that only one person, an aged woman, knew or remembered the genealogical tables of the chieftains of these septs. Concerning the family history of the chiefs of the Qunetcin division, I could obtain no account whatever, no one apparently possessing any knowledge thereof. The following is the genealogical table and history of the SqafaQos. According to the belief of the natives, the founder of the SqafaQos was te spElamuttl, " a heaven-born man" named S'onkEtl. He had a brother named Sukal, who became a secondary chief, and a wife named Yalqomolt. He is said to have first appeared at a place called Smet, which is at the head of Hotham Sound. This meagre account is all that can now be gathered concerning the past of 'this subdivision of the Sfciatl. The pedigrees of S'onkEtl and his brother Suk'al as given to me are as follows :-</page><page sequence="5">24 C.

The founder of the TuiwanEkQ division was also tE spIlEmutl. His name was TlEntekenEm. His successors were TlEntCke'nEM II., III., IV., V. and VI., who is now a small boy. We learn from these Family Tables that the chieftaincy was practically hereditary, although theoretically within the grasp of any miember of the tribe who could outdo the ruling chief in potlatching or feast-giving; and it is not without interest to observe that the same anxiety and ambition to found and perpetuate a family, displayed in mnodern society, are equally factors in the life of savage races, Socially, the Sfciatl people were divided into three castes or classes, as in the other Salish tribes examiinied, viz., chiefs, nobles, and base folk. We have seen how the first are constituted; the second were composed of the heads of families of standing, and, generally, of the wealthy. The last were made up of the thriftless, the indolent, and the slaves of the tribe. I miade special and repeated inquiries with regard to secret societies and brotherhoods, and induced my infornmants and helpers to question in my presence the old men and women on these points; but all were unanimous ill declaring that nothing resembling the modern secret societies of the Kwakiutl, of which they have some knowleddge, had any place among the old-time Sfciatl. The nearest approaclh to anything of the kind was the initiation of the pupils, or disciples of the SiyaikwEtl (medicine-man) or the Swlfn (seer), who were accustomed to attach a few followers to themselves after the manner of apprentices. My own conclusions respecting the social life of the old Sfciatl, formed after careful study and inquiry, are that it was of a very simple nature, and similar to that of the interior Salish tribes. The war-like division of the Kwakiutl stock which ruled the waters of the Strait, and kept the Sfciatl isolated from other influences, effectually hindered the acquisition of foreign ideas or conceptions from those quarters; and the large influx of Lillooet blood in the present Sfciatl suggests close relations with that tribe, if not original descent from it. Of the two dozen photographs which I obtained among the Slciatl, a preponderating number are those of individuals with Lillooet blood in them. Aniother thing which points to relationship, or at, any rate close contact, with the interior Salish, is the fact that they formerly practised that peculiar custom of secluding certain of their children; a custom which my collection of Thoinpson folklore shows to have been at one time prevalent among the N'tlakdpamuQ, the neighbours of the Lillooet tribes. A propos of this practice, I learned from Charlie Roberts that the object of this seclusion was, in the case of male children, to make great hunters of them; great, that is, in the sense of securing by some occult means large quantities of game. They are said to have been quite white in appearance, much lighter than the average settler, from their long seclusion. They were shut up in box-like receptacles, and never allowed out of them, or the house, save at night, when they could not be seen. Another peculiarity was that their hair must nlever be cut. These individuals aroused much curiosity in the other members of the tribe, alnd all kinds of schemes were resorted to in order to</page><page sequence="7">26 C. HILL TOUT.-Peport on the Ethnology of the Stcicatl of get a sight of then. In the case of youths, when it becamie known that one was about to set out on a hunting expedition, the young women would do their best to get a glimpse of him, and if possible, would waylay him, and induce him to break his celibacy in the hope of securing him for a husband. For, if a young man lay with a maid, she became ipso facto his wife. Oln leaving the house, they were always covered up with blankets, and were conducted by some near relative into the forest, until beyond the gaze of the curious and prying. They were supposed to possess supernatural powers of some sort. It is recorded of one that he went out fishing with his brother, and while they were engaged in their work, a young female seal popped up its head at a little distance from the canoe. When the youth saw it he cried out: " Oh what a nice young woman; how I should like her for a wife." The seal dived down, and his brother warned him to beware of uttering such wishes when so near a seal colony. But the youth took no notice of the advice, and made the remark again when the seal came up a second time near the canoe. Again it dived, but presently came up close to the canoe and assuming the form of a maiden, invited him to descend with her to the seal village below. He readily accepted the invitation, and dived down with her. After a little while he returned to the surface and bade his brother go home without him, saying that he intended to stay with the seal people. His bfother urged him to change his mind, and accompany him, but was in the end obliged to return home without him; and his people never saw himii again. Shamanisn?. The Shamans, among the old-time Sfciatl, were of three classes: the S&amp;yaikw'tl or doctor, the Siwin or seer, and the Seiiwa or witch. The last-named were generally women, the other two invariably men. Their practices did not differ in any essential point from those of their class among the other Salish tribes treated of heretofore. The Siyafkw'tl corresponded to the SQunam of the Halk6melEm, the Swiwn to the Olia, and, like him, possessed clairvoyant powers, and could discover lost persons or things. One hears mlany stories of the supernormal powers of these Siwin, and they undoubtedly possessed the faculty of perceiving distant and hiddein objects in some degree. Not every one who desired could become a Siwin. Only those whose psychical make-up fitted them for the office ever became Siwln. Su'nliaisni. I inquired very particularly among the Sfciatl concerning Sulia. In this tribe, as in the Sk-q0mic, suliaism seems to have playe(d a less prominent part than in the up-river and interior tribes. Not every one, it would appear, among these two tribes acquired sulia (called by them s'f1yi,) or supernatural helpers. Those who possessed them were, according to all my informants, mostly shamans, or distinguished hunters, or fishers, or warriors, or runners, or those generally who exceeded in any particular thing; the attendant bodily exercises and the protracted fasts incidental to the acquisition of sulia apparently not being to the</page><page sequence="8">Bitish Columnbial, a Coast Div'sion of the Salish Stock. 27 liking of the ordinary individual. But as it was of the very essence of the sulia that its acquisitioii by the seeker should be kept secret fromn his fellows, at any rate among the Sk-qomic and Siciatl, it is not improbable that this fact, and the long time that has elapsed since these tribes gave up their pagan habits and beliefs, hide from uts the true extent to which suliaism permeated the lives of the old-time Sk-qomic and S1ciatl. Regarding the practice, however, merely from the point of view of my informants, we may yet perceive the significance which suliaism had in the mind of the natives, aiid the potent influence it exercised upon their lives. The importance of the psychical factor of this cult in the development of these races can hardly be over-estimated. Among the Slciatl there seems never to have been any painted or sculptured representations of the sulia on the houses or other belongings 6f the individual. Such sculptures and paintings as were displayed being, as I have already stated, honorific, and not totemistic in character. The import of this calls for consideration, for we have in these figures apparently another source or origin of personal and family crests. The son inheriting his father's house and rank, inherited with these all his carvings and paintings; and it becomes important ill our studies of the social customs of the tribes of this region, and particularly of their crests and emblems, to determine which are honorific, which totemistic, and which merely commemorative in character; also to what extent the first were formerly employed, and what part they have played in the giving of animal names to individuals, families, and clans. For it seems impossible to doubt that figures of animals were used by other of the north-west tribes to symbolise the social status of their notabilities. Indeed, Father Morice has shown that the Dene tvibes of the interior employed a like symbolism for that purpose,' and signs of it are not wanting in the heraldic columns of the northern coast Indians. It is quite likely that we have sometimes confused the honorific symbols with those of totemic import. Certainly, students of these races have customarily regarded house sculptures and paintings as being totemistic in character and significance; and while this view may be right in some cases, or even in the main, it is clear from my present studies of the S1ciatl and Sklq6onic, that it cannot be in all. It will be important then, in future researches, to distinguish clearly between the different classes of symbolism employed by our Indialls. Another point of some importance has been raised by my studies of the Slciatl. According to them, the acquisition of such a magic treasure or supernatural helper as the Teteletc of the ancestor of the Tsonai chiefs, did not result in the founding of a new crest or totem as - was invariably the case among their northern neighbours. No carvings, paintings, or other marks were eniployed to symbolise such objects or possessions, or to com- memorate their acquisition. While this is possibly true, and is certaiinly in keepinlg with what we have learned of the Salish of the interior, too much stress 1 "Notes on the Western Den6s" by the Rev. A. G.

It is open to question whether the present Slciatl are at all times trustworthy informants upon the practices and beliefs of their pagan ancestors, two generations separating them from the primitive order of things. That the forest, the air, and the sea were full of mysteries to them is clear from their folk-tales; and their anthropomorphic conceptions of the animal and vegetable worlds coloured all their lives and thoughts, as among their neighbours. Even to-day, among the most advanced and intelligent of them, there is still a strong belief in the human or man-like side of animals, plaints, and other objects and forces. This universal concept of primitive man seems to be one of the mnost persistent of his early beliefs. There is also one other point to which I would like to draw attention. The Tsonai sept clain, as I have before stated, a -Kwakiutl origin. If this be true, and I know no reason why we should doubt it, the entire absence among the S3fciatl of all those peculiar observances and customs, so characteristic of the Kwakiutl when they first came under our observation, would seem to indicate one of two things: either that the Slciatl mind was uncongenial to Kwakiutl institutions, which is very unlikely, judging by their adoption more or less fully by other Salish tribes; or, which is more probable, that the present social organisation of the Kwakiutl, with its strange societies, clan divisions, and elaborate winter cereinonials, is of modern origin. This is the view which Dr. Boas' studies of this people led him to adopt, and the absence of anything resembling these practices anmong the Slciatl, who claim relationship through one of their divisions with the Kwakiutl, certainly brings additional and independent support to that view. Dress. In dress the Sfciatl did not differ materially from the other Salish tribes already described. Dressed skins, blankets, woven from the hair of the mountaini goat and from a species of long-lhaired dog bred for the purpose, and capes and skirts from the inner bark of the cedar (Tlhn6ya gigantea) formed the ordinary covering of the people. In mentioning the cedar as a source of clothing, it will not be out of place if I call attention here to the unique value of this tree to the old-time native, and the many uses to which he put it, and for which it was so eminently adaptable. It was to him much what the cocoanut-palm was to the South Sea Islander. Frorn its outer bark he constructed ropes and lines, coverings for his dwelling, his slow matches, or " travelling fire," and many other things. Fromn its inner bark his wife wove garments for herself and children, made their beds and pillows, padded her children's cradles, and fashioned the compressing bands and pads for deforming their heads, and also the insignia of their secret societies, their headdresses and other ceremonial decorations, besides applying it in a multitude of other ways. From its wood he built the famiily and comimunal dwellings, made such furniture as he used-tubs, pots, kettles,</page><page sequence="10">British Columbia, a Coast Division of the Salish Stock. 29 bowls, dishes, and platters, fashionied his graceful aild buoyant fishing and war canoes, hiis coffinl, his treasure chests, his ceremonial rnasks, his heraldic emblems, his commemorative columns, his totem poles, and a host of other objects. From its branches he made his most enduring withes and ties, and from its split roots his wife constructed the beauitiful basketry of this region. There was practically no part of this remarkable tree which he did not apply to some useful purpose or other. He even resorted to it for food in times of scarcity and famine: his wives and daughters robbing the squirrels and chipmunks of their stores of its cones for the nuitriment they containred. One can hardly imagine what the condition of the natives of this region would have been without this tree, no other of the country lending itself to such a variety of useful purposes. That it has had a profound influence upon their condition, and has helped to shape the lines of their culture, there can be no doubt. Dwellings, The dwelling,s of the old-time Siciatl were of the communial kind. They appear, however, not to have been so long generally as among somie of the coast Salish; the nature of the grouind at these villages not being so convenient for this purpose. Tn height they ranged from twenty-five feet to forty or even fifty feet, according to Charlie Roberts, but I think these latter heights doubtfuil. Usually each house was occupied only by persons connected by famnily ties. Fanlilies with niumerous ramifications would always possess a building of their own, but somietimes two or more small families would share the same building between them. Isolated individuals, or those having few connections, would find accommodation in some family, whose dwelling was larger than their needs required. The internal structure and arrangement differed somewhat from that of the other tribes. For example, at the building of the house a permanent platform about two feet high and five or six feet broad was erected all round the inlterior walls. This served as seats or lounges for the occupants during the day, and during the night as beds. Somie ten or twelve feet above this platformi small isolated cubicles or sleeping rooms were constructed. These were for pubescent boys and girls, who were confined separately in them for the space of ten days upon their reaching puberty. Each fainily partitioned off its allotment from the rest by means of hanging mats. There were no haniging shelves for storing food, as in the Sk-qomic and HalkomelEm houses, for the reason that their supplies were kept elsewhere. Food. The staple food of the Slciatl consisted of about equal proportions of venison and fish, suppleinented by various roots and berries. Their territory abounded in game, and their- waters teemed with fish. As I have said, they did not store their winter supplies in their dwellings, buit "cached " them in the woods. Only a few days' supply was ever carried home. This peculiar custoin was due to</page><page sequence="11">30 C. HILL ToUT.-Peport on the Ethnology of the Stciatl of the marauding proclivities of the neighbouring YVkEltMs, who made periodical forays upon their settlement and carried off all they could lay hands upon. It was unsafe, therefore, to keep a large store of food by theim. In the matter of preserving the berries of their district for winter use, they had, and still practise, a most ingenious method of treating thenm. On one of my visits among them I was present when some of the women were makinlg their winter "jam" from the salal berry, and I was thus able to observe the whole process. The fruit is first boiled for an hour or so, after which it is poured into a- bowl and carefully mashed into a uniform jelly with a wooden pestle. A layer of large leaves is now spread over a kind of tray, made of narrow strips of wood fastened together by cross pieces. Upon the leaves is spread out a thin continuous layer of the jelly. The tray is then placed in the sun to dry, and when the upper side of the jelly has hardened into a cake, the whole is turned over on to another tray, and the other side of the layer is also left to dry out. When both sides are properly dried, the jam has the appearance of a piece of coarse felt, and can be rolled up like a mat and stored away for use. Now-a-days they use sugar in the boiling; formerly, of course, they had to dispense with this. When they wish to make use of this preserved fruit, they break off a piece, steep it in water for awhile and then reboil it, just as we do the evaporated fruits of commerce. Cured and preserved in this way, they say fruit will keep in good condition from season to season, or even longer, if kept dry and free from mildew. Household Utensils. The Sfciatl made uise of utensils similar to those employed by their congeners. Some of the women were very skilful in making the cedar-root basketry of this region. Even now, they make large numnbers of them for sale to tourists, receiving from five to fifteen dollars a basket, according to size and quality. They had received an order just before my last visit to them, and many of the women and girls were busy in carrying it out. They employ only the small trailing roots of the bigger cedar for this kind of basketry. I was fortunate enough to be able to observe closely the whole process from beginning to end, and, indeed, I may say that I received instruction enough to be able, in a clumiisy way, to put a basket together myself. The actual process of making is simpler than the appearance of the finished product would lead one to suppose. The most difficult anld tedious part of the work is the preparation of the material. This, as 1 have said, is the root, or rather rootlets, of the cedar. These are dug up by the women with their skulq, or root-diggers, and brought home in bundles. The longer the roots the better, but the thickness of them should not exceed a thumb's width. The roots are first peeled or scraped, and, if not wanted at once, are placed in a stream or buried in. wet ground to keep them moist and pliable. If required at once, they are halved anid quartered longitudinally. This is done by means of a knife, and the hands and teeth, the latter playing a prominent part in the operation. The quarters are then split in the same manner into thin strands or splints of uniform</page><page sequence="12">British Columbia, a Coast Division of the Salish Stock. 31 thickness. Those that are not of uniform thickness are pared down to the required condition with a knife; but if too irregular for this purpose, they are set aside with the short lengths and broken pieces, to be used in the construction of the cores or coils of the basket. The strands are next tied separately iiito loose knots, just as one ties a bootlace or a piece of string, and thrown into a pail or pan of water ready for use. When a sufficient quantity of strands has been prepared, the woman sets about making her basket. She begins by putting together a core of the required length of the basket. This is made up of pieces of the cedar rootlets rejected in the process of making the strands, and varies from a quarter to half an inch in thickness. Round this core she next winds in close contact one of the strands, beginning at one end anid finishing at the other. To both sides of this she then stitches, by over-casting other cores, until the bottom is of the desired dimensions. Upon this groundwork the sides are built up, coil by coil, in the same way. The stitching is done by meanis of an awl, now usually of steel, but formiierly of pointed bone. Each stitch of the lower coil is pierced in turn, the strand carried over the new coil, which is built uip as the work proceeds, passed back through the hole and pulled tight. This is repeated all round the basket, until the coil is comnplete. The coils are thus built up separately, one upon another, and when the desired height has been reached, fiinished off with a crown of doubled or trebled coils. The basket is made sometimes with a close-fitting lid or cover and sometimes without, according to the patternl or the use to which it is intended to be put. Usually these baskets- are more or less ornamented with variously tinted grasses and barks. The bark most commonly em-ployed for this purpose is that of the wild cherry and of the birch. Either strips of this, or the straws, or both combined, are hooked in on the outer surface of the basket during the process of making in the following manner .-One end is inserted under a stitch at some particular spot, and thus firmly secured. The strip of straw is then drawn over the face of the next stitch, and carried a little beyond it, then doubled back, and the doubled end fastened under the succeeding stitch, and the process is continued in the same manner as far as the design requires it. Sometimes this ornamentation is exceedingly tasteful, and the colours soft and harmonious. In somie instances, the strips of bark are entirely dispensed with, and only a glossy yellow straw is employed. In such cases the whole outer surface of the basket is usually thus covered, giving to it a shining silvery appearance, and hiding entirely the underlying cedar strands. In the old days, besides these cedar-root baskets, they also made baskets from the bark of the birch, from water grasses, and from netted cords, spun from the bark of the cedar tree. These las.t they still make and employ, but I saw no specimen of the birchbark kind among them. The Sfciatl had two kinds of bottles for storing their fish-oils, called respectively kwop:t tE ladi and pEAltcis. The former was constructed from the air-bladder or sounds of fish, the latter from the bulbous kelp or sea- weed (Macrocystis pyrifera) peculiar to the Pacific Coast. For domestic purposes they used a very singular detergent. It was a kind of tree-fungus, called by</page><page sequence="13">32 C.

In appearance it looks like a lump of dirty- white under-baked dough; but its strong saponaceous qualities make it an excellent substitute for soap.' Putberty CUstorns. In puberty rites and observances no two of our Salish tribes seem to follow the same custonms. Among the Slciatl the puibescent boy or girl was secluded from the rest of the household for the space of ten days in a cubicle (kowitl), built over the family bed in the interior of the dwelling. The period of a girl's seclusion was always coincident with her first inenses; that of the boy was determined by the breaking of his voice, by the appearanice of hair on the pubes, and by the disappearance of the hard, pellet-like substance at the base of the nipple of the mammary gland. If, at any time, the boy or girl desired to leave the cubicle for any purpose, the former was always accompanied by three old men, and the latter by the same number of old women. The occasion of their seclusion was taken advantage of by the elders to instruct them in the several duties and responsibilities of man and womanhood. They were made to eat and drink very sparingly throughout the whole period of their seclusion; the object of this on the part of the boy being to fit him for the privations of the hunter's life, and to prevent him from developing a lustful ternperament and interfering with other men's wives. On the part of the girl, it was to prevent her from becoming a greedy and gluttonous woman, who would seek to rob her husband of the choicest portions of their food. To teach them industrious habits the girl was employed in plucking the needles from a fir branch oiie at a time, or in picking yarn and in spinning; the boy in making arrows and other masculine objects. In order to make sure that the girl drank but little she was supplied with only a shell of water at a meal, and frequently this had a hole pierced through it for the purpose of letting the water leak away. Nor mnust she put even this small receptacle to her mouth, but must suck the water- up through a small tube or hollow bone. A girl's first period is called qal'Eqa, the succeediilg ones sqal'Eqa. It was customary for the father or uncle of the boy or girl to give a s1lImatEs, or puberty feast, at this time to inark the occasion. If no feast were given, their friends and 1 Since the above was Written, a paper " On the Anatomical Characters of the substance 'Indian Soap'," written by Miss M. Dawson, B.Sc. (Lond. and Wales), and published in the Transactions of the Canadian Institute, has come into my hands. According to Professor Macoun the substance is a Polyporus allied to P. betulinus, which had become changed by its own mycelium into punk. Miss Dawson in summing up her paper remarks, " As regards the nature of this substance, ' Indian soap,' the general arrangement and character of the large colourless hyphke seem to support Professor Macoun's conclusion that it consists of a fructification of a Polyporus. . . The whole structure has obviouslv beenl much changed by the action of parasitic hyphe, so that we may perhaps, with justice, conclude that it conisists of some large fungus, probably of the Polyporui type, which has been destroyed by two parasitic fungi. . . . As a result, degeneration of some of the interwoven hyphae seems to have takeu place, giving rise to a resinous substance to whose presence the characteristic saponaceous feeling is due."</page><page sequence="14">British Columbia, a Coast Division of the Salish Stock. 33 relatives would be much ashamed, and feel lowered in the eyes of the rest of the tribe. After the period of seclusion of the girl was over, she was thenceforward treated as a woman. Her parents presented her with a comb and a pair of fire- tongs, and stones for heating water, and other household utensils, oiled her hair and painted her eyebrows and cheeks after the matnner of women. Mortuary Customs. These customiis among the Sfciatl differed somewhat from those practised by the Halk6me'lEm tribes. Dread of the dead was apparently not so strong among them as among the River tribes. The corpse was not taken out of the house, for instanice, until the time of burial, usually the day following the death. It was prepared for burial by four or five old men, friends of the relatives. This unusual delay in the disposal of the corpse was due to the fact that these old men had to go apart by theinselves, and undergo some ceremonial preparation, before they handled the body. The treatment of the corpse among the Slciatl was similar to that among the tribes already treated of. When ready for disposal, it was usually placed on the open ground on some island set apart for this purpose. Since their conversion to Christianity the Sfciatl have gathered up all these old corpses and their remains and buried them in their consecrated grave-yards; somatological material is therefore difficult to secure among this tribe. Beliefs and Customs. The Sfciatl believe that the raven foretells the death of anyolne. When they see him sitting on the branch of a tree, ruffling his feathers and croaking dismally, they believe that someone among them will shortly die. The old people also say that he gives notice of the approach of a carloe long before they know of it. When a girl is undergoing her puberty rites she must not eat salmon, or there will be a scarcity of this fish at the next run. Survivors of dead relatives must never eat salmon in the early stages of the run, nor enter a creek where salmon are found, or the salmon will be harmed. A dead body, or anything in connection with the dead, is inimical to the salmon. When the women clean the first salmon of the season they must avoid wrenching off the neck. They are permitted to do this only with the later salynon. Times and Seasons. The Sfciatl divided their year into twelve portions, which correspond approxinmately to our twelve months. The moon seems to have held a very subordinate part in these divisions. The year (Silamin) as a whole was reckoned either by surmimers or by winters, that is by so nmany tEm eryos, " fine seasons," or by so many skwomai, " snows." The seasons (tEm) are Spring, tEm paifya, Sunmmer, tEmn ey6s, Autumn (vacat), Winter, tEm tcim, " cold season " or tEm sotEte. VOL. XXXIV. D</page><page sequence="15">34 C. HILL TOUT.-Report on the Ethnology of the Scciatl of Past seasonis, or years, were thus expressed:-" last year," spl nEwtl; last summer, tEm ey6s-5tl; last winter, tEm tcim-otl, etc. The divisions of the year are:- - January, tEm kaikQ, "eagle" time, so called because the eagle, they say, hatches its eggs about this time. February, tEmr nEm, "time when the big fish lay their eggs." March, tEm s'atskai, "budding time." April, tEni slem, (from lem, name of a large migratory bird with a red breast, and long neck and legs (not identified), which stays about a month in these parts.)

October, tEm palka'l'nuH, " time when the leaves fade." Novem,ber, tEm QAsRtcin, " timne when the fish leave the streams." December, tEm kwito, " time when the raven lays his eggs." The Sfciatl seem to have no special terms for the quarters as such, but specialize the winds coming from them, thus: North wind, tolumEla; south wind, k-aiwaluk; west wind, tlalic'aluk; east wind, kecaluk. ARCH,EOLOGY. The archaeological remains within the Siciatl boundaries differ in soniie interestino features from those already described in other celntres. Speaking broadly, they may be divided into three classes, viz., midden-heaps, cairns, and fishing works. With respect to the first, they are to be found throughout the whole territory, wherever a suitable camping ground is found. Some of them are comparatively modern, and of no great extenlt, and are clearly old camips of the present tribes. Others belong no less clearly to a more remote period, and were formed, here as elsewhere, by races antecedenit to the Salish. Some of the largest and oldest trees of the district are found growinig over them, their roots gripping the midden-mass, and extending throughout it, thus plainly showing that they have sprung up there since the camip was abandoned, which, in sortme cases, must have been at least half a millenniunm ago. These midden-heaps do not differ in any essential features from those already described by mie, except that I found none so large aiid extensive as those on the banks of the Lower Fraser and the shores of Puget Sound; and as far as my necessarily restricted examination went, they appear to be rather poor in relics. I secured a few arrow and spear-heads, somne broken slate knives of the crescentic pattern, characteristic of this region, an imiiperfect pestle-hammer, and a few other specimens. The means at my disposal did not permit of extensive investigations.</page><page sequence="16">British Columbia, a Coast Division of the Salish Stock. 35 Concerning the second class of remains, the cairns, I ain unable to speak positively of the number and extent of these. The natives appear to kniow nothing of them, or where they are to be found. Those that came under my observation are situated on the summit of a mountaini overlooking Pender Harbour and the waters of the Strait. This mountain is about twelve hundred feet above sea level. Its summit is open and terrace-like and almiost devoid of soil. From the top ani extensive outlook may be had of the waters of the Strait. It is very probable that other mountain-tops or slopes in the Siciatl territories contain similar remains. These structures differ from those found in the HalkomelEm territory, chiefly in-the fact that they are composed wholly of stone, and in this respect are sitnilar to some of those found on the southern half of Vancouver Island. The preliminary steps in the formation of these sepulchres were the samie as those enmployed in the formation of the burial mounds or tumuli. An enclosure of varying dimensions was first forined by means of a wall of stones or boulders, set sometimes close together, at others at some distance apart. This boundary in the HalkomelEm area was invariably rectangular in form. On this mountain, on the contrary, it varies from a proximrately true circle to an oval. Within the enclosure thus formed the corpse was set down in the middle and covered over with a huge pile of rocks and thus left. It is not easy to estimate the age of these mountain tombs. All one can say is that they are not modern. Such as were examined contained no visible remains of any kind. That they belong to a comparatively distant past is clear from the fact that the modern Indians declare that they know nothing of them, and that their method of disposing of their dead before the advent of the missionary was to place them on certain of the islets in the inlets and arms of the Strait. This we know they did; for the remains of bodies so disposed of have been found on the islands. Personally I am disposed to regard these mountain tombs or cairns, as I do the tumuli of the HalkomelEm area, as the remains of a prae-Salishan people. With respect to the third class of remains, the fishing works or stations, Siciatl traditions make the Salish culture-hero or demi-god, QEqEls, the author of themi. I am unable to say how many of these fishing-stations may be found il the Slciatl territory; I have knowledge only of that at the mouth of a small stream near Pelnder Harbour. This stream drains a chain of small lakes which were a favourite spawniiig-ground of the salmon, and its mouth lends itself admirably to the fornmation of the kind of traps we find here. It is not the ordinary barrier or weir stretching across the mouth of the river which impedes the ascent of the salmon and causes them to congregate in great numbers at the foot, but a series of lateral pockets or traps made of stone walls at one side of the streami, into which, by a series of channels or flumes, the fish are forced by the tide in their endeavours to ascend the stream to their spawning-grounds. At the ebb of the tide these pockets are practically drained, and the capture of the fish i.s an easy inatter. These traps are interesting in themselves as well as from the fact that they D 2</page><page sequence="17">36 C.

The builder of this fishing station was demonstrably a man of resources and ability, but whether of the Salish stock or of some other, it is now impossible to determine. TRADITIONS. TE SkImEtf.

He was unmarried and very much desired a wife. Upon a certaini day he went out for a walk near the river. He walked on for some time and presently he saw some smoke ascending aDd went forward to investigate. On getting nearer he perceived a house, inside of which was a young snake woman. She was a very fine woman, exceedingly beautiful was that snake woman. He accosted her thus: "What do you think of the idea of becoming my wife?" The young woman answered, "I couldn't think of marrying you. I don't like squint-eyed, broad-bellied men, with short arms and feet. Go away, I dislike you." Thus dismissed, the young man went out and started homewards for his own house. When he got there he threw himnself on his bed and cried bitterly. His grandmother, seeing him, asked what was the matter, and why he was crying. " Oh, grandmother," he sobbed out, "she called mie cross-eyed and big-bellied, and taunted me with my short arms and legs." The grandrnother wept in sympathy, and said, " If I had been there, my grandson, when she called you these ill names I would have killed her. But don't cry any more, I will punish her." Thereupon she calls upon the invisible rain-clouds. Soon they appeared and a heavy rain-storm arose. The river rose rapidly, and in a short time washed away the house of the snake woman and also the snake herself, who was only saved from immediate drowning by clinging to the roots of a small tree. In her peril she cries out to the beaver, " Oh, Beaver, I love you." Beaver replies, "But I don't love you," and left her to her fate. The water continuing to rise, she was presently drowned.

He approached it, and clambered up on one side, and searched</page><page sequence="20">British Columbia, a Coast Division of the Salish Stock. 39 for his knife to cut it up. Not finding it, he sings to himself, "(I wish that I could find my knife; I wish, I wish, I wish that I could find my knife, so that I might cut up this whale." Now it happened that there were a great many people on the other side of the water, and they heard Wren singing his song. Thereupon they take their canoes and cross over to his side. In the meantimne Wren goes home to look for his knife. When the people arrived on the beachl, they saw the whale anld set to work at once to cut it up. They took away every bit of it. leaving none for Wren. When he got back with his knife, he' found the whale gone and nothing left but a tiny morsel of bone. This he picked up, and when he had made a fire, he roasted it. When it was cooked, he put it into his mouth with one end of it sticking out. Taking his knife, he sought to cut it off close to his nose, and in doing so, cut the point of his nose off so that it hung down. Greatly distressed at his mishap, he threw away the bone and started off into the woods with his nose danglilng before himtl. When he had gone a little way, he perceived a fire, and, on approachinig it, saw a man lying lnear. When the man saw Wren, he cried out, "Come forward, my friend, comne forward." Now the man was suffering very much from toothache, and said to Wren, " Oh, my friend, my tooth is very sore." Wren examined the man's tooth and said, "Oh, my friend, you are not very ill. Your tooth is nothing to my nose." But the inan replies, "Your case is not very hard, my friend, I will soon heal your nose." Wren then took his knife, went over to the man and quickly wrenched out the achiing tooth with his knife. The inan was greatly relieved, got up, and went over to Wren, and taking his nose in his hand, set it in its place, and immediately it became whole. They then separated, each going off in the oppositb direction. TE Siaiyak SQaQiam. The Sun Myth.

The final s marks its pronominal character. When employed as a simple demonstrative it lacks this inflective element so characteristic of the third person. t15nm takes several prefixes, the commonest of which are te, ta and kwo. 5 kwo-tcin. This particle kwo is very interesting in its function. It is the same as the kwo above in the preceding paragraph. When compounded with the pronoun it has a temporal-locative signification, It refers to something that has taken place elsewhere and</page><page sequence="24">British Columbia, a Coast Division of the Salish Stock. 43 earlier.

Here we see another and independent usage of this particle kwo-Em. Here it takes the verbal suffix. I tat-kops. I have here traiislated this term as "companion," but this is scarcely the signification of the compound, kops is the compound term for " are," while tat signifies rather " across," "on the other side." In the Sifciatl tat-kops conveys the idea of each one sitting on the opposite side of the fire.

Cf. sos ci tE katca (below), " went out-of-sight the basket." 13 kwo-kwuti.. Kwo, as employed in this compound, implies that the father and husband was looked upon as being "lost." He had vanished from his wife's and child's sight entirely. te kwO-kwutL might perhaps be better rendered by " the lost one is returning." The Sun Myth. There was once an old man who had a son. The youth had two wives. He was a fine hunter, and often went hunting with his companions. One day, when they were all out hunting together, they got very cold. In order to warm them, he went up to a tree and kicked it. Immediately the tree began to burn, and they all gathered round to warm themselves. When they were well warmed, they set off again on their hunting. Presently they came upon some mountain-goats and deer. The young man killed them all. They then cut up the game and each taking his pack started homewards. When they came to the river, the youth, whose name was TlEyEkockin, left his pack on the bank and went on home without it. When he arrived, he informed his father of what he had done, and bade him go to the bank of the river and fetch the pack. The old man set out, and, reaching the spot, proceeded to pack home the meat. As he was crossing the river his pack strap broke, and the pack fell into the water. He made a clutch for it, but failed to secure it; again he tried, and yet a third time, but failed to secure it. By this time he had got into deep water, and the current carried him off his legs and he was drowned. He floats off down the river, and as he goes he is changed into a piece of wood. In course of time the piece of wood is carried into a strange country. There are a great number of people about there, and a woman, seeing the piece of wood took a fancy to it, drew it out of the water, and took it home with her, saying as she did so: "-I will use it for a dish when I eat." At supper-time she took the piece of wood and placed her food upon it; but she had scarcely begun to eat when all the food suddenly vanished. Thereupon she took up the piece of wood and threw it fromn her. When it fell it began to cry like a baby, and, in a moment, was changed into a little child. She went to it,</page><page sequence="25">44 C. HlLL TOUT.-Report on thte, Ethnology of the Siciatl of and took it up and nourished it; and in four days the child became a young man. Soon after he set out for his own home. When he arrived, and saw his son, he determined to take revenge upon him. So he went to the side of a tree and defecated, and gave instructions to his excrement in this wise, "When my son comes, I desire that you shall be changed into little birds." The old man then went home, and said to his son: " Son, I saw just now in yonder tree some very pretty birds." "Yes," said the son, "I will go and get them." So he took his bow and arrows, and went over to the tree. He shot all his arrows at the birds, but was not able to kill them. He then climbed the tree, and as he climbed the tree stretched upwards into the sky. He presently reached the birds and as he sought to seize them, they turned to excrement in his hand. Shaking his hands to cleanse them, he sought to descend the tree, but was no longer able to see down below. He wept at his predicament, and proceeds to the top of the tree and arrives in the Sun-land. It appears to him to be a very fine country, and he sets off walking. Presently he hears a strange knocking sound, and on approaching the spot from whence it came, perceives two old womien who were both blind. The noise is caused by one of the old women preparing their food. He sits down beside them, and when the old woman passes the food she has crushed to her companion, he intercepts it and eats it himself. The one who had been thus robbed cried out for her share. "Did you not get what I just passed you ? " questioned the other. "No, I have had none." Again the other passes her food, and again it is intercepted by the young man. Three times this is done, and then the old woman who was passing the food suspected the presence of someone among them, and called out: "Are you my grandson?" The young man replied in the affirmative, and, taking some mediciine leaves, puts them in water and sprinkles the old women with the liquid, and thus restores their sight. He then left them, and went on walking. Presently he came to a large river, in which were mnany salmon. Pulling a hair from his leg, he threw it on the ground and immediately it became a strong line. Taking the line, he returns to the old women, and told them that the river beyond them contained lots of salmon, and bade them make the material he had brought into a net. The old women thank the youth, and one of them says to him: " Oh, grandson, don't disturb your mind about your going home; you shall get back all right by-and-bye to youir wife and son." The young man curbs his impatience, and abides in the house of the old women. Some few days later, the old women said to him, " Get ready, grandson, now you shall go home." Thereupon they opened up a hole close to the fireplace, and, taking a large basket, bade the young man lie down in it. They then attach a long line to the basket, and instruct the youth in this wise: "When you are going down, if the basket should stop, don't uncover yourself; just shake it, and then it will go on descending again." They then let down the basket, which continues to descend without any trouble for a considerable distance, but presently it stops. Forgetful of the old women's instructions, he uncovers himself to learn what is the matter, but no sooner has he done so, than the basket immediately returns to the upper</page><page sequence="26">British Columbia, a Coast Division of the Salish Stock. 45 land. The old people scold him for his disobedience, and further instruct him saying: " Only when you hear a crow calling, then uncover yourself and get out; that will be your couintry." This time lhe did as they told him, and after a while got to the bottom and heard the cry of the crow. He thereupon uncovered himself, and got out, and taking hold of the basket, rain round with it in a great circle till presently it was drawn up again to the upper regions. When the basket had gone out of his sight he set off walking and presently perceives before him his wife carrying his son. The little one recognizes him and cries out: " Oh, mother, here is my lost father coming back." The mother chides hiin, and bids hini be quiet, but the boy cried out again: "My father is coming." The mother now turns round, and perceives her husband. She sits down, and he comes and sits down by her side and takes the little boy in his arms. They all shed tears of gladness at their reunion. Presently the man questions the woman and asks where his other wife is. She tells him that his father had taken her soon after his mysterious disappearance. Those familiar with the folklore of the Thompson Indians will at onlce perceive that this story is a somewhat imperfect version of Snikiap and his son N'tlikcumtEm. Throughout the whole story there is a lack of local detail. This, and the several omissions, mark it as a borrowed form. It reached the Sfciatl very probably through the Lillooets.

He was taken down into the lower depths and saw the bottom of the sea. There was no water there, everything was quite dry. This salmon was not a common salmon, but a person who could assume salmon form. He took the boy home with him, and made him his slave. For a whole year he lived with the salmon. When the year had passed, the salmon got ready to start for their spawning-grounds. All the little salmon began to cry to go too, but the old people remonstrated with them, and told them they could not go till they were four years old. The little boy observed all that the salmon did, and took note of their lives and doings. When they were ready to start, they all took their canoes and made for a small stream. They were a very glad and merry party, and sang and jumped in the water. When the salmon went up the stream into shallow water, the little boy got out and went home and instructed all the people how they should treat the salmon. They were on no account to break the neck of the salmon they caught in the early days of the run, he told them, or the salmon would never return. It is believed that the salmon always know when anyonie is dead. They will never go near where a corpse lies.</page><page sequence="28">-British Colqtmbia, a Coast Division of the Salish Stock. 47 TE KaikQ eE tE SkafakEnek. The Eagle and the Owl.

This is a synthetic term of relationship very difficult to render into English. KaiEq is a word used to designate a younger brother, sister, or cousin. NEq appears in terms which express relationship to one's wife's people as: nEq-tcfumaictEn - wife's brothers and sisters, nEq-wj-nEM-tEn = wife's relations generally, and the latter elements of the compound are seen in the term for " youths." 2 SQEndm. The use of this term in Sfciatl is very interesting. It is the term for " Doctor" in the Halkomelem and Sk-qomic. 3 KwF-t6mIfq, cf. with this ta-temiiaq below. These prefixes are locative particles with meaning similar to the cis- and trans- of the Latin. 4 There is no equivaleint for this term in English.

Once upon a time Eagle and Owl lived together in the same house. They were great hunters, and always had a goodly supply -of meat on hand; but there was one thino that they both lacked and that was the possession of wives. They were both wifeless. Now it happened one day when they were off hunting, two young women, sisters, in one of their walks came by where Eagle and Owl lived, and seeing their house went into it. On entering they perceived that it contained two beds, and the elder sister straightway appropriated one of these, and the younger the other. A little after sunset, Eagle and Owl returned from their hunting and found the yourng womnen there. They were delighted to see them and each took one to wife; Eagle choosing" the younger and Owl the elder sister. In due course of time each woman gave birth to a son. To the younger was born a fine male child, but the offspring of the elder was a frog, which the mother placed in the lake as soon as it was born. Eagle and Owl continued their hunting and went off day by day into the woods as before. One day they failed to return when night set in. The sisters waited day after day for them, but they came not. Said one to the other," I fear sorne dreadful monster has killed our husbands, and they will never return to us more." At last they determined to wait no longer for their coming but go and search for them. So they set out together, each taking her child with her. When they had been walking for some time they came to a very broad lake, and the younger said to the elder, "How shall we ever get across ?" "Oh, don't you worry about that," was the response, we shall get across all right presently." And as she spoke she took a long line and fastened it in the mouth of her frog-child like a bit, and instructed him to swim before them across the lake, while they would follow after walking on the line. When they had gone some way in this manner the frog-boy grew restive and stopped and turned round; but his mother and aunt soothed and encouraged him and he set off again, and in course of time they all reached the other side in safety. Here the women left the frog at the edge of the lake and set off walking again. When they had been travelling for some time they heard a strange noise and perceived before them a house. They enter this, ancd find their husbands there at the point of death. Presently the witch-monster, whose house it was, camne home and found them there. Her name was Yaneqemekwon. She grins when she sees the women; and, in order to destroy them, proposes that they shall play at sliding down the mountain. Now this moiintain, after a short declivity, falls abruptly, and precipitates the venturesomrle slider into a yawning chasm, hundreds of feet below. Thus the witch-monster thought to rid herself of the wives of her victims. But the elder sister took the magic line she had used in crossing the lake, and, fastening one end about herself, gave the other to the little boy to hold. She also, the better to deceive Yaneqemekwon, put into her mouth some red and white paint. After that, she started to slide down the mountain side, and as she vanished over the edge of the chasm, she spat out the paint which VOL. XXXIV, 13</page><page sequence="31">50 C. HILL TOUT.-Report on the Ethnology of the Stciatl of she had in her mouth. The witch-woman, perceiving this, believed it to be her brains, which had been dashed out in her fall. Thereupon she laughed a hideous laugh, but even while she laughed the woman returns, brought back by the elastic strain of the magic rope, and touches her on her shoulder, and she perceives that her scheme has failed. It is now the younger one's turn to slide. But she does the same as her sister; and when the witch is laughing in glee over her supposed death, she in like manner is drawn back, and to the witch's astonishment, stands by her side unhurt. Yaneqemekwon is now struck with the long glossy hair of the two women, and openly admires it, asking thenm how they make it grow so luxuriantly. It is now the sisters' turn to deceive. So they reply that the abundance of their tresses is the result of their putting pitch and hot stones on their heads. Yaneqemekwon requests them to treat her hair in like manner for her. They consenlt, and set about doing it, the one standing behind, and the other in front to hold her down. They cover her head with pitch, and then place burning stones upon it; and the woman behind brings forward her own hair and lets the ends hang down over the witch's face in order to induce her to believe it was her own hair growing. The pain of the burning pitch and stones niakes Yaneqemekwon struggle and cry out, btut the sisters hold her down, bid her keep quiet, and declare that her hair is beginning to grow. The increasing pain makes her struggle and cry out again, and she would fain have rid herself af the cauLse of her agony, but it is too late now, and she presently expires. TE AsQ eE tE Skwato.

Raven, who lived in one part of the country, had a sister named Seal, who lived with her large family in another part. One day, Raven determined to visit his sister; so taking his canoe he set out. Upon his arrival, Seal set about preparing a meal for him. She did this by roasting her hands before the fire and catching the oil from them as it dropped into a dish. When Raven had satisfied his appetite, he told her that he desired to adopt and take home with him one of her children. " Very good," replied Seal, " you shall have my youngest daughter." In a little while Raven set out for his home, taking his youngest niece with him. When they were about half-way there, Raven asked his niece if she were not thirsty. She replying in the affirmative, he pulled ashore. She got out of the canoe and stooped down to drink. As she was stooping, PRaven struck her on the head and killed her. He then places the dead body in the canoe, and makes straight for his home. When he arrives, he holds a feast and devours the body of his niece. In like manner, he got possession of all his nieces, twelve in number, and devoured them in the same way. When all his nieces had thus been disposed of, he makes up his mind to kill and devour his sister Seal; but she is too clever for him. When he attempts to kill her, she jumps into the water and gets away. Thus- defeated in his purpose, he has perforce to return home empty-handed. His many crimes and wickednesses shortly after so incensed the Sky God QEqals that, to punish him, he turned both him and his many wives into stone. A Sfciatl Prophecy.

There once lived an old man who was able to foretell everything that was going to happen. He was not a shaman but a true prophet. He was always speaking to the people about the other world. He taught them that it was the unseen Power above who made the ancients and that He had made everything they saw. He foretold of the coming of the unknown white men to this country. The people did niot believe him; they regarded his statements as great lies. He also foretold of the com^ing of their enemies in battle. NOTE. My informants told me that this person lived some generations ago before the coming of the priests. Tradlition of a Great Snowstorm. The old people of long ago tell a story of a severe snowstorm. So deep was the snow and so lonig did the storm continue that the people died in great numbers from lack of food. Only the very wealthy were able to procure food at all. To such a pass were the poorer people driven that they niot only ate their dogs and everythin-g else they could lay their hand8 on, in some instances their very children. This story would appear to be based on actual facts. The tradition of a fearful and prolonged snowstorm is common to most, if not to all, the tribes of this region; and a similar story is recorded with much graphic detail by the old people among the Squamish. The Thresher Myth. Te Sta4lacin SQaQ!am. Once upon a time some of the people of the village perceived a sea-otter (KEltetc). They hastened to take their bows and arrows and shoot it. The otter was struck in the tail with an arrow anld captured. It is given to the man who shot it, and he kills anid skins it. As there was much blood on the hair, he left the skin soaking in the water and told his wife to go and wash it. When the woman had cleansed the skin, and was washing the blood from her hands, it floated a little way out from the shore. Uponi seeing this the woman pulled up her skirts and went in after it; and just as she put her hand upon it, the skin jumped up and caught the woman in its arms, beino changed at the same moment into a thresher (St'alacin). Immediately the surroundingt water was full of threshers. When the husband learns what has happened, he becomes very angry. He paints his face with black, white, and red paints, and puts a large quantity of eagle down upon his head. He then takes his spear and harpoon, gets into his</page><page sequence="34">Britisha Coast -Division of the Salish Stock. 53 canoe, and goes after the threshers. When he approaches they all dive. He waits for them to come up again, but they do not come. He goes out a little further on the water and drops his anchor. He thein takes off all the down on his head, and dives into the water after the threshers. When he gets to the bottom he finds a very fine country down there. Perceiving a road he set out to follow it, and presently comes to a house. When he gets close lhe sees a crane. It flies away crying, " ka, ka, ka ! ' as it goes. "Shut up, grandmother," said the man, " I want to talk with you." The crane then stopped, and the inan asked her if she had seen a woman pass that way with the people. "Yes," replied the crane, " I saw a woman just now with some people going by here." The man proceeded on his journey, and presently sees in the distance the smoke of another dwelling in the centre of a fine valley. When he camie to the house, he saw a wild goose there. The goose was crying out after its kind, and the man bade it be quiet. " Shtut up, grandmother," says he, " and tell me have you seen a womian pass this way ? " " Yes," said the goose, " she passed by here just now." The man goes on here agcain, and, in a little while, perceives before him the smoke of another dwelling. Upon reaching it, lhe sees that it is inhabited by a s1in (aquatic bird not identified). It also was making the noise peculiar to its kind. "Shut up, grandmother," said the man to it, "' and tell me have you seen a woman pass this way ? " " Yes," said the slem, " she passed by here just now." The man goes on a little further, aind then, by his magic power, compels the slave of the Thresher to go out and gather firewood. As the slave approaches the spot where he is, he chooses a good tree, and gets inside of it. Thus hidden, he draws the slave to him. When the slave came to the tree, in which he was hidden, he took his stone chisel and hammer, and began to cut it down. When the slave drove the chisel into the trunk, the man inside opened his mouth, cauglht the chisel in his teeth, and broke it. When the slave perceives that he has broken his chisel, he sheds tears at its loss. The man now comes out of the tree, and, revealing himself, said to the slave, " Give me your broken chisel, anid I will make it whole for you." The slave gave him the piece of chisel, and the man put it in his rmouth, and by his magic joined it to the other piece, wvhich he still retained in his inouth, and made it perfect as before. The slave is very grateful to the man. The latter now asks the slave to help him get his wife back from his master. This the slave consents to do, and they plan together how they may outwit the Thresher. The slave chops down the tree, and the man, taking a piece of the wood, hides himself within it by his magic power, and instructs the slave to- carry it home, and put it down just inside the door. It is arranged between them that after the slave has made a big fire to enable the manl to see all over the house and where his wife has been placed, he shall go to get water, and when he passes by the fire, shall pretend to fall down and spill it all over the fire. Upon arriving at the Thresher's dwelling, the slave set down the piece of wood containing the man just inside the door, as had been arranged between them, started a large fire, and then went out to fetch some water. In passing by the fire on his return he stumbled and fell, casting</page><page sequence="35">54 0. HILL TOUT.-- Report on the Ethnology of the Steiat/ of the water on the fire, and leaving the room in darkness. The man thereupon jumped out froin his hiding place, cauLght up his wife and ran away with her, while the slave busied himself in starting the fire anew. When the light of the fire is cast over the dwelling the Thresher and his friends perceive that the woman has got away. They all start off to pursue her, the slave goinig with them. Now the slave was by far the swiftest runner of them all, and, coming first to the runaways and wishing to aid them, he pretends to fall down, and where he fell there immediately sprang up a lofty mountain between the man and his wife and their pursuers. By the time the latter have climbed the mountain, the former are well on their way, but before the man can get to the spot over which his canoe is moored they are upon hinm again. The grateful slave again came to their lescue, and raised a second barrier between them and the pursuers by casting himself on the ground as before. Before the Thresher people could cross this second mountain the man reached the line hanging from his canoe and jerking it violently is pulled up to the surface with his wife in his arms by his brother who is waiting in the canoe for him. They immediately pull for the shore and only just reach it in time to escape the angry threshers, who, as soon as the fugitives got tci land, gave up the chase and troubled them no more. The Eagle People. There was once a ehief who had many wives. In his tribe there was a great number of young men. Now one of these youths fell in love with one of the chief's wives. She was the most beautiful of them all. At first she would take no notice of him, but, in the end, she yielded and spent nmost of her time with the yotung man. When the chief learnt of his wife's infidelity, he sought to find who her lover was. To do this, he laid a trap for him. He sent out a lnumber of men to collect pitch. This he spread over his unfaithful wife's bed, and the following night when the young luan went to visit her he laid down o1i the pitch, which- adhered to his back. When he essayed to get up in the morning, he found himself held back by the pitch; and, in order to get up at all, was obliged to go away with the bed-board sticking to his back. The chief was looking for this, and had the young man seized and thrown into the water. When the youth found himself in the water, he prayed to QEqals to save him. The sky-god heard his prayer, and calmed the water all around hiM-. For ten days he floated with the tide, with the board still fastened by the pitch to his back. By the tenth day, the heat of the sun had so melted the pitch that he was able to rid himself of the board. A little while after, he found himself on the other side of the sea and drew himself ashore. He felt very sad and cried very much at the thought of his lonely colidition. He threw himself on the beach, and covered his face with his blanket. Thus he reimained for a long time. When the sun was well up, and he was feeling a little better, he felt something touch his feet and looked up quickly to see what it was. Seeing nothing, he-covered up his face again. He had no sooner donle so than he felt the touch repeated. He raised his head a second time and looked</page><page sequence="36">I3itish (Yol'ambia, a Coast Division of the SaUsh o0tock. 55 round, but nothing was visible, and he covered himself a third time. This occurred many times; at last, feeling sure that somebody was playing him a trick, he set about discoverinig who it was. Inistead of wholly covering his face, he so wrapped the blanket about him that he could peep out all the time. Presently he perceived a mouse come out of a hole near his feet. " I see you, Mouse," he cries, " you needn't hide any more." Mouse now stays and, sitting down by the young nman's side, asks where he had come from. The youth replies, "I caime from the other side of the water; Ka- threw me into the sea and I floated here. But where do you live ? " Mouse replies, " We have a house over yonder. Many young womeni live there. I am their slave." Now the young women had seen the youth, and bad sent Mouse to him; and, although he could not see themn or their dwelling, they were at that very moment peeping at and discussing him. One said, " I will take him for a husband." Another said, "No, you sha'n't, I will have him; " and so said all of them. Mouse now brings the youth to the house. When they got in, he perceived a numilber of girls sitting down in a line. Being a fine-looking young man, the women all admired him greatly and each desired to possess him for herself. He sits down before them, and the first woman asks him, " Will you take miie for your wife ?" Before he had time to reply, each of the others made the same request. The young man would have been greatly enmbarrass6d if Mouse had not forewarined him of what would happen. " Refuse them all," he had told him, " except the last one. Take her for your wife; her father is a very rich man." Acting on Mouse's advice, he chose her for his wife. As they talked together, she said, " My father will come to-morrow and offer you your choice of two eagles, one the black, the other the bald-beaded eagole. Choose the black one. I will take the white-headed one for myself." Next day the old man came, and did as his daughter had said. His wife now instructed him to put on his eagle's skin. She did the same with hers. " Now, I will teach you how to fly and catch fish," said she; "sonly be careful to follow my instructions. There is a monster who floats on the water. Don't be tempted to catch him, or he will lead you to your death." He becomes a very suiccessful fisher, and secures all kinds of marine game such as salmon, porpoises, seals, and whales. So excited is he with his sport that he forgets all about the monster. Lyirng on the surface of the water, he sees in the distance what looks like a large fish. He flies towards it, and fastens his talons in its flesh. Just as he does so, his wife perceives what he has done and the great danger he is in, and flies to his rescue. He was in the power of the monster. The creature now endeavours to drag him under the water, and when his wife reaches himn, only his head is visible. She seizes him by the hair and calls to her father and brothers and other relatives to comiie and lhelp. They hurry to her aid and marny other eagles also rush to assist. They struggle together for a long time, but, in the end, the eagles win. The niionster is torn asunder, and the youth carries the portion he held ashore. They all rejoice at their success, and talk of his wonderful escape. When a year had passed by, a son was born to him. As soon as the child began to speak, he cried</page><page sequence="37">56 C. :HILL TOUT.-Report on the Ethnology of the Siciatl of incessantly for his paternal grandparents. This makes the father desire greatly to get back to his own home, but knowing how far away across the water it was, he saw no hope of ever reaching it and became very sad in consequeuce. When his father-in-law (SwenEm) perceived his sorrow, he said to him, " Son-in-law (Stceuitas), don't be downcast: you shall go back to your home by-and-bye." The next day his father-in-law took a small canoe, and, placiing a carved figure at each end, placed his son-in-law and his daughter and her child in the centre of it. He then pushed the canoe into the water, and said, "Go, carry them home." The canoe thereupon went of itself. There was no lack of food for the journey, for the old man had given them a magic glove full of choice imieat which never got empty. In course of time, they crossed the sea and reachecd the village of the young man. It, was -night and very dark when he arrived, and no one knew that he had come. But niext day, it soon became noised abroad, and everybody came to see him; above all, the young women of the village. They all desire to have him for their husband, but he declines all their offers. Next day he gave a great feast. His wife opened the glove in which their food was stored and took out what was left. It filled two houses. He now cooks it, and by his father-in-law's magic, is able to boil this vast quantity in one small kettle, He now invites all the people of his village to share the food-with him. When they are assembled, one of the guests, whose name was Raven, makes fuln of the small pot in which the food was cooking. " Somebody will go short," said he, " if that is all you have to offer us. I could put all that pot holds in my own spoon." The young man and his wife say nothing, but take three small dishes and pour the meat into them and a1sk the people to help themselves. This, with much scrambling, they did, and to their surprise the dishes ever remained full. Raven tried hard to empty them, but found it beyond his power. However much was taken out, more remained behind, until everybody was satisfied. When all were filled, then the pot was empty. When their guests had all gone, the wife says to her husband, " Now you must 'be very careful and not go with any other women. If you are unifaithful to me I shall go away and leave you." On the following day, his wife wanting some water, he took a bucket and went to the creek to fetch her some. Wheni he got to the creek, all the girls in the village were there on the lookout for him. One of them enticed him to go into the woods with her, and he, forgetful of his wife's warning,. accepted her invitation, and went with her. Some time later, he returned to his home with the water. When he sets the water down, his wife takes an eagle quill anid, dipping it in the water, holds it up and examines it. By this means she learns of his infidelity. She throws away the water, and will have none of it. Said she to him, "You have brokeni your promise to me. Now I must leave you.' So saying she took her child, and went down to the beach. He follows her, and beseeches, her to turn back. She does not stop, but bids him go home and leave her, saying as she went, " If I turn my face towards you, youi will die." When she got to the water, she did not seek her canoe, but walks straiglht on, and the water supported her. He follows close behind her, in like manner the water also</page><page sequence="38">British Columbia, a Coast Division of the Salish Stock. 57 supporting him. Againi he begs her to return with him, but she answers, "Nay, I can return no more; but go you home." He replies, " I will never leave you," and continues to walk after her, beseeching her, every few steps, to stop and turn back with him. Thus they continue for a long way; and she, at last weary of his importuning, turns round towards him. Immediately the waters cease to hold hin up and he sinks beneath them and is drowned. The Mink and the Wolf Young Wolf one day went out hunting. When several days had passed, his friends thought he must be lost, and went to look for him. In the meantime, Mink went down to the water to fish. As he sat in his canoe fishing, he saw Young Wolf on the beach. Wolf calls to him to come ashore, but Mink pays no attention to him; Wolf, however, continues to importune him, and Mink presently pulls ashore and takes him into his canoe. When he is seated, Mink asks him if he likes sea-urchins' eggs: Wolf replies that he does. Mink then bids him help himself, saying, " Eat as many as you like, but eat only the white ones, don't eat the red ones."' Wolf falls to and devours a great many. When he had finished, Mink says, " If you wanit to go to sleep now, lie downi in the bottom of the canoe and rest your neck on the thwarts." Wolf does so, and is soon fast asleep. Presently, Mink takes his knife, and cuts Wolf's throat with it so that he dies. He now pulls ashore, skins Wolf, and takes the pelt home with him, and hangs it by the fire to dry. A little while after, Wolf's grandmother came to Mink's house to buy sea-urchins' eggs. Mink tells her to look at what was hanging before the fire. She looked up, and saw her grandson's skin, at sight of which she cries bitterly. Said Mink to her, " If you want to make that noise you had better go outside, I don't want you blubbering here." The old woman thereupon left the house, and went home. "What are you crying for?" said Old Wolf and the others. She answered them, "I am crying because I shall never see my lost grandson any more; Minik has killed himii." When they hear this, they become very angry, and declare they will go and kill Mink; but one says, " Don't let us kill him in his own house, but let us get him here and kill him." In order to entice Mink to their house, Old Wolf gave a great potlatch, and invited everybody to attend, Minlk among them. Now the Mink suspects sonme trick will be played upon him, and that the Wolf people will try to take revenge for the murder of Young Wolf; so he takes steps to outwit them. Now Knothole was his grandmother, likewise Mouse, anid he gives them instructions in this wise. To the fornmer he, says, " If the Wolves spring at me, you grow big and let me through." To the latter he says, "You gnaw all the bows and paddles of the Wolf people so they cannot use them without breaking." They promise to do as he bids them. When Mink reached the Wolves' house, and was fairly inside, they all sprang upon him with the intention of tearing him to pieces, but Mink, being on the lookout for this kind of welcome, sprang through the Knothole, and ran down to his canoe. The Wolves seized their bows and arrows, and essayed to shoot him; but as Mouse had</page><page sequence="39">58 0. HILL ToU.-Peport on t/e lthnology of the Si-ciatl of bitten each bow almost in two, their weapons broke in their hands. Seeing this, they threw them aside and rushed to their canoes to follow after Mink on the water. No sooner are they fairly started than their paddles snap in two, and Mink gets away from them. But the Wolves are determined to take him, and get new paddles and return to the chase. After a long pull, they overtake and capture him, and would have bound him with cedar withes, but Mink said to them, ' It is no good tying ne with cedar I can easily break that. You had better take a kelp line and tie me with that." This they did; then Mink said, " Let me dance before you kill me." "(Very good," they answered, "you shall have your dance." So they bring the canoes together, side by side, and Mink begins his dance. He dances first in one canoe, and then in another. Then he puts one leg in one canoe, and the other in another, anld bids them separate the canoes a little. " Now close up again," he says, " now open wider." When the canoes are well apart, he suddenly jumps into the water and dives down between them. The Wolves search everywhere for him, but cannot find him. Presently Mink pops his head up out of the water, near the shore, and cries out, "Hullo, you people, what are you doing there ?" The Wolves pull ashore after him, determined yet to kill himi. Mink now enters a hole, and the Wolves comie and thrust their spears in, hoping to kill him; but again Mink outwits them. When they thrust the spears in, he takes some of his grandmother's guts and put them on the spears. The Wolves seeing this believe that they have killed him, and go out in their canoes again. As soon as they are on the water, Mink comes out of his hole and shouts out, " Hullo, you people, what are you doing out there?" The Wolves hurry back, and Mink hides in his hole a second time. Again they thrust their spears in, and again he puts the entrails upon them and deceives them. After awhile, the Wolves go away believing Mink to be dead. Whenl they had gone but a few steps, Mink calls them back with a jeer saying, " Why don't you come and take me? " Time and again he thus deceives the Wolves, who, at last despairing of capturing him, go away for good and leave him. LINGUISTIC. As far as I am aware, rno attempt has been made to set forth the structure and grammar of the Sfciatl dialect, or collect a glossary of its terms. The following notes and texts will therefore be the more welcome. The Sfciatl differs considerably from the speech of the contiguous Salish tribes; and by the Indians themselves it is considered a difficult dialect to acquire. They tell me that most Siciatl can converse in the neighbouring Slaiainon, Sk-qomic and Halk6melEm, but that few, if any, members of these tribes ever acquire a speaking knowledge of Sfciatl. One reason of this is that its vocables are mostly foreign to those dialects. In the compilation of these notes, another illustration was afforded of the need there is to employ more than one individual in our studies of the native speech. The differences in the enunciationi of the same words by Jack Isidore and Charlie Roberts were often so considerable, that I had on several occasions to call upon a third person to determilne the, form to</page><page sequence="40">l3ritish Colunmbia, a Coast DPrisi'on of the Salish Stock. 59 adopt and record. The personal differences in the speakers of barbarous and unlettered languages would appear to be considerably greater than those displayed by the speakers of cultivated tonigues. This, in the case of the speech of the tribes under consideration, is due mainly to the undeveloped state of their phonology and the consequent indetermillate quality of many of their sounds, the result of which is a strong tendency to permutation in. vowels as well as in consonants. This tendency is very strong in Siciatl where n and d; ni and b; e, i, ai, are everywhere interchangeable in the mouth of the same person and in the same words; and it is uitterly futile to attempt to get the natives to distinguish between them, particularly the colnsonants. To them n and d are absolutely alike in sound even when uttered by a European. The same may be said of m and b, d and t, and all other distinctions of surd and sonant. This confusion of n with d, m with b, was at first a cause of much trouble to me; for sometimes I secured the one sound and sometimes the other in the same word in different connections; but on account of the difference failed to recognize it as the same; the sound for example of tcedis-tcedo, my dog, not suggesting readily to the ear the more correct formn tcin's-tc&amp;n6, Many of the differences in the vocabulary will be found to arise from this perilmutation, and possibly some of the difficulty which the other tribes find in acquiring this dialect is due to the same cause. My chief helpers in my linguistic studies were Charlie Roberts and Jack Isidore. Others of the tribe gave nle occasional help and assisted me in the determination of doubtful constructions and sounds. An examination of my grammatical notes will show that the Sfciatl differs in maniy interesting features from the dialects I have previously examined. Thus far, all examined have shown the employment of a different root for marking the future in verbs. The Siciatl is no exception to this. The radix employed by them is totally unlike that in any other dialect. Considerable difference is also seen in their prolnominial forms; and the temporal affix nE or IE of the HalkomelErn dialects is changed to te in Siciatl. PHONOLOGY.

I have called attention in formner reports to the indeterminate character of the vowel in the Salish dialects of this region. This quality characterizes the</page><page sequence="41">60 C. HILL TOUT.-Report on the Ethnology of the Siciatl of Siciatl vowels in a marked degree, particularly the long vowels. There are also many obscure vowel sounds in Siciatl as in the other Salish dialects; but I have refrained from multiplying the symbols for these on account of the "personal equation" in the speech of tlle natives; no two as a rule, as far as my ear could detect, using quite the same sound in the samiie phrases. And for this reason I hold that any attempt at over-refinemuent of sounds in setting forth the phonology of native speech defeats the end in view; the more particularly when the sounds have been gathered as is frequently the case, from one person only. For all practical purposes the symbol E as here used serves the purpose of indicating the obscure character of tlle vowel very well. Consonants. b, as in English. This sound is lnever used in Siciatl as the complemenlt of p, but is a permutation of mf. d, as in English. This sound is always a -permutation of n in Siciatl and is never the sonant of t. h, as in English. k, k, a strongly palatized k. 1, as in English. tl, an explosive palatized 1.

' written over a consonant indicates that it is uttered explosively with stress, as: t'paos, " blind."</page><page sequence="42">British Columbia, a Coast Division of the Salish Stock. 61 Accent. Accentuation in the Salish tongtie is as marked as in English. But it has a wider syntactic and grarnmatic use than in our language. I have nlot yet satisfactorily determined in my own mind the basic principle of the accent in Salish. The fact that the position of the accent in the samyie word frequeitly varies in the different dialects tends to make the subject more difficult. But speaking broadly two main principles reveal themselves, viz., radix accentuation and quantity accentuation. Both these rules are frequently disreg,arded and the accent is shifted to some other syllable in the word for syntactic and rhetoric purposes. It is a common principle in tlle Salish dialects to distinguish homonymous terms by a shifting of the accent, more particularly when the words have an etymological identity. Thus: sk-omai, hair, aind sk-onral, dog'; niEtcln, lice; and mftcin, testicles. N'umber. Number is distinguished in Siciatl in a variety of ways, as in the other Salish dialects. There appears to be no true plural, the same form being used for the singular as well as for the plural; but wherever the idea of severalty or distribution enters the distinction is effected by a modification of the stem. This is done by reduplicatio-n, by epenthesis, diaeresis, apheresis, epitliesis and by vocalic mutation. Ideas of greatness, abundance or plentitude are expressed by means of separate particles. The following words offer examples of these methods, thus SwawEl6s, boy. sw5wewElo-, boys. stomic, man. stEimtornic, men. qafEls, stone. qEqaiEls, stones. siya'kp, hat. sislyak6p, hats. stEkall, horse. stEkteakai-, horses. hopit, deer. hEphopit, deer. tcltwon, bear. tciteitwon, bears. tlumstan, house. tlatlumstan, houses. sfya, log. sfyayn, logs. (This is a very unusual form.) klakatl, old. klakawatl, old (several). QamemanEs, old. QaMEmemanEs, old (several). stWtElEmit, old. statotElEmit, old (several). Gender. Gender is distinguished in Sfciatl by the use of demonstrative particles, which alone possess a formal gender; by the use of separate words, or by placing the terms for " man" and " woman " before or after the class word, thus: tE, masculine. tlE, or SE, feminine. man, father. tan, mother. stomic, man. tlanai, woman. swawElos, boy. tlitlanai, girl. I These dogs were reared for the sake of their hair, hence the term,</page><page sequence="43">62 C. HILL ToUT.-Report on the Ethnology of the SMciatl oj In Seciatl there appears to be no modification of the terms for " mlail " and "wonman " when applied to mark gender in aninials as in the Halk6melEm and Sk qomic dialects, thus: stomic-tcedo, dog; tlanai-tc6d6, bitch. Case. In the Salish tongue case distinctions are wholly wanting. The relations expressed by case-endings are in this language supplied by particles; the Salish being ani analytical tongue like the English, with which it has many other points in common. Reduplication. Reduplication plays an important r6le in Salish and has deeply affected the developmenit of its grammatical and lexical forms. It subserves a variety of purposes. Primarily its function is to express severalty or distributioii. It seems also at times to denote the idea of plurality; but on this point I am not yet certain, for in many instances where it seems at first sight to mark the plural, a closer examination shows that the predominant idea is really severalty. The ideas of augmentation and its opposite, dimiinutioni, are also expressed by reduplication. It also expresses intensity, repetition, frequency and prolongation of verbal action, collectively, totality, superiority and its opposite, inferiority, and several other categories. The expression of these several ideas is effected by phonetic changes in the radix or by a shifting of the accent. In words of one syllable the whole word is usually duplicated. In words of more than one syllable the radical syllable only is duplicated. This appears to be the general rule, but exceptions are not infrequent. Diminutives. Exainples of diminutive reduplication in Siciatl are as follows:- tlAmstan, homse. tletlumstan, little house. stolo, river. StotEl1, rivulet. qaiEls, stone. qaiqaiEls, pebble. tcedo, d og. cetcedo, pUPpy. h6opt, deer. hoh6pit, fcawn. kwodot, porpoise. kwokwodototl, young poipoise. kwinis, wlhale. kwe(a)kwiniso6tl, young whale. N.B.-The suffix -6tl seen in the last two is added to distinguish the words from homonymous forms in the language: kwatlt, dish; kwakwEtlt, platter. Other examples of reduplication will be found in the vocabularies and native texts given below. Au6gment ativres. Augmentatives in Sfciatl are commonly formed by prefixing the particle t or te to the term, thus: te-tlumstan, a large house; ti-y6flo'6t, a greact huinter; ti-stol6, a large river.</page><page sequence="44">British Colunmbia, a Coast Division -of the Salish Stock. 63 Stubstantivutm Instrumentale. The instrumental suffix -tEn so characteristic of the Salish dialects finds a place equally in Siciatl, thus:- halyai-tEn, arrowv. k ulk6-tEn, a wall. po-tEn, a sail. kwaI-tEn, speech, language. tEklEsot-tEn, ladder, steps. peQuiHe-tEn, a br,?ush. 'kupaiakw6iya-tEn, finger-nail. kw6l-tEn, a stocking. s10osE-tEn, food-mat or tablecloth. tlatc-tEn, knife. kwil-tEn, a hiding-place. kw6kwin6s-tEn, a mirror. It is interesting to note that no two dialects apply this suffix to the sanme category of terms. It is one of the mnost interesting of the Salish formative elements. S,ubstantiva oftcialia. These are formed in several ways, chiefly by the prefix nilks-, secondly by reduplication of the stem, and occasionally by the prefix of abstraction, s, thus nuiks-atcetc, a stuttterer; from atcetc, to stutter. nutks-stelim, or stEltelim or stEltEl, from telem, to sing. nuiks-et6t, or sEtetot, a sleeper; from et6t, to sleep. sutetot, a dreamer; from utetot, to dream. nuks-y6il0o4t, or y6y611o6gt, a hunter; from y6llo&amp;%t, to hunt. stciltcilotl, a robber; from tcilotl, to rob. kw6kw6yfluk, a murder of one person; from kw0oyiluk, to murder or kill. kw6waiyiluk, or kw6kwalmaq, many times a murderer, from same root. so6mat, a lazy person; from 06mat, lazy. nfiks-kwekw6tlkEn, an interpreter; from the reduplicated root kwekwWtlkEn. S'tcatcalEtEn, afisher; from s'tcaltEn, tofish. Synthetic Nouns. The Siciatl usually employ synthetic or incorporative nouns when speakinig of the body or its parts, and in a few other constructions such as class numeerals, tree and house compounds, etc., thus:- tsuq-os-Em, to wash the fctee. tsuq-o1y-Em, to wash the hands. tsuq-clfn-Em, to wash the feet. tsuq-enas-Em, to wash the chest. tsuq-6akwad-Em, to wash the head. also k ak abFisEm etla-walos, I hurt 'ny eye. etla-cin, I hurt my foot. 1 This formation is different from that of any of the other dialects previously examined. It signifies " thing for scratching or digging."</page><page sequence="45">64 C. HILL ToUT.- Report on the Ethnology of the S'ciatl of etla-wa{ada, I hurt my ear. etla-w4iya, I hurt my hand. t6-tcin-sipai-yuk-, I struck my nose. te-tcin-suk alaIok-, I hurt mny head (from something falling upon it). suk Emaltk-, I hurt my head (by passing through a low doorway, etc.). lEsalik--tcin, I h7it my head (by strikinig the floor with it in lying down). The incorporative forms for house are, -autQ or -tQ, for tree -ai, thus: na tc-autQ, one house; sam.tQ, two houses, etc.; kwzsEn-autQ, star-house; spal-ai, one tree; tEmcid-ai, two trees, etc.; cedar-tree, tUqEm-ai; fir-tree, pElad-ai; maple-tree, kYimol-ai, etc. For numeral compound forms see under Class Numerals below (p. 69). All these synthetic forms may be rendered by the independent forms and frequently are. Speaking generally these forms are derived from the older elements of the langutage, and are found with slight modification in all the Salish dialects. Compound Nouns. The compound nouns in Sfciatl are formed as in the other Salish dialects examined, by simple juxtaposition, by agglutination, and by formative elements. Abstract nouns are formed directly from the verb steni by prefixing s to them, thus: eftltEn, to eat; setltEn, food; kait, to shout; skait, a shout; kwut, to see; skwut, sight; utetot, to dream?,; sutet6t, a dream; teucam, or tette`ucam, to learn; stekicam, or stete4-ucam, learning, instruction. Personal Pronouns. Of these there are in Slciatl three classes, the independent, the copulative and the incorporative. The independent pronouns are:- I, me, sallyfi. we, tlnern6tl, or nemotl. thou, nuiwll. you, nufElap. he or shze, te, te-tlors, ta, ta-tlnms. they, te, t`-tloms, ta, tatloms. The forms for the third person are really demonstratives, and are usually employed without distinction of sex, the context marking this. In constructions where it is necessary to distinctly mark the sex se or tle is used for the feminine. The distinction between te and ta, or t1-tl6ms and ta-tlms, is just that between hic and ille of the Latin. A clear idea of the function of these demonstrative forms may best be gathered from a study of the native texts given below. In the plural the compound forms are sometimes reduplicated, thus: tAtEtl6ms, they. A selective significance is given to the pronouns by placing the demonstrative particles tE or tlE before them, according to the gender, thus tE sAaliyf, 1. tE tlnemMtl1 we. tE nuiwil, thou. tE n-allap, you.</page><page sequence="46">British Columbia, a Coast Divisiont of the Salish Stock. 65 Copulative Pronouns. I, -tcin, tcin-, -tcan, tcan-, -an. We, -c't, -teat, -at. thou6,-tculq, tcuiq-, -tcauq, -auq. Yot, -tcallEpz, -ap, -4lap. he, she, -as, -s, -tas. Tlhey, -as, -aswet, -tas, -6t. The function of these will best be seen in the niative texts given above. It will be seen that they are sometimes prefixed and sometimes suffixed. Incorporative Pronouns. These forms present considerable differences from the corresponding ones in the dialects previously examined. qatl-nom!-tcin, 1 like thee. qatl-nom1-tcil-Elap, [ like yout. qatl-nomi-c't, we like thee. qatl-n5m!-c't-Elap, we li/ce you. qatl-n5m-tc-tc-dq (tE sallyfl), thoat likest qatl-nomotl-tciiq (tE tlnem6tl), thout me. likest us. qatl-nuq-Tia-tcTiq, thou likest hMin, her. qatl-tlau-nfiq-fla-tcTiq, thou likest them. qatl-nuct' (tE), you like him. qatl-n6mtc-as, he likes me. qatl-nim6tl-as, 7he likes us. qatl-nomtc-aset, they like ne. qatl-n6m6tl-as6t, they like uts. qatl-nnmiin, he likes thee. qatl-n6nmim-Elap, he likes you. qatl-nomim (aiyawft), they like thee. qatl-n6MiMElap (aiyawet), thbey like you. There is a certain interesting uniformity about these forms which is wanting in the other dialects examined; througlhout tlhey have the reflexive pronoominal stem nomout, self, in comlmiiion. The forms for the third person are also interesting. The particle nuiq seen in thern is not a pronomninal element proper. It is the same determinative particle which plays so iniportauit a part in Sk qomic constructions to which I have previously called attentionl. From the following there would appear to be another method of pronominal incorporation; but this is an irregular form. kwedem or kwenem=to see. kwenqe`tcin, I see yo?t. kweneu6tcfTq, you see Jie. kwen6eetcinElap, I see you (plural). kweneqEtcalap, you see me (plural). kwenUtcin t'e, I see him?. kwevkwenetcin, 1 see themn. kwenesaset, they saw me. kwenRt6mo?(Es, 7te sawv me. kwenesim tE nITiwfi, they swv tltee. kwen6qus, he sCawV thee. kwenesihn tE niiTwilap, theq saw you (plural). Possessive or, Adjectival- Pronouns. Of these the Sfciatl employ several distinct forms; they also make distinction between the thing present ancd the thing absent, the commonest form is as follows:- VoL. XXXIV. F</page><page sequence="47">66 C. HILL TOUT.-Report oni the Ethnology of the Sf ciatl of Singular. Plural. tE-n' man (object present), myfather. tE-ms' man (object present), ou,r father. tcE-na man (object absent), myfather. tcE-ms' man (object absent), our father. tE man (object present), thy father. tE man-Elap (object present), your fcather. tCE man (object absent), thyfather. tcE man-Elap (object absenlt), your father. tE man-s (object present), his, her, tE man-et (object present), their father. father. tcE man-s (object absent), his, hber, tcE man-et (object absent), their father. father. The above are used exclusively with masculine objects. With femninine objects the following are enmployed:- Singular.

Plural. nE-tAn, my mother. inusnana-tan, our m1other. u-tain, thy mother. u-tdn-Elap, your mother. tan-s, his, her mother. tan-et, their mother. This form is employed wheni the object is close to the possessQr of it. Examples of its use will be found in the native texts below. As the demonstrative elements are wanting to it there is of course no distinction of gender with this form. It is the form most commonly used in answer to the question " Whose is this ? " The emphatic forms equivalent to the nE-swai or tUnswa forms of the Halk6mllEm are as follows:</page><page sequence="48">British Columbia, a Coast Division of the Salish Stock. 67 Singmalar.

This word stcedo may also be written stceno, the d being a perniutation of n. I have, however, invariably employed the d because this sound so strongly predominates. The particle kwa which plays so important a part in the Halk6mdlEnc dialects is also seen in Sfciatl. It fills a subordinate place, however, in this tongue. It is found in pronominal forms and marks absence as in Halk6mAlErn, but is not used in quite the same way. I have not found any distinction between present and visible, and present but invisible, pronominal forms in the Sfciatl, as in the Halk6melErn. In the expression, is your father dead ? kwa must always be used, thus: kwa kw&amp;o tCE man ? Its function here is the sanme as in the other dialects. It marks the absence of the object, or rather, as the tCE form does this, the absence of knowledge of the locale of the object spoken of. In Siciatl the particle kw6 is used in a temporal sense in a manner peculiar to that dialect, thus we say: kwo kukElhselEmn, he is sic/c, if the person referred to is in some other place. It is employed also in the following constructions: kwo-tcin kwatan tlE siacin a tE tAtkwat tlE stol1, I left the pack on thIe ban/c of the river; kuim kwo aukQ tE s6tltEns, then "c(away" or " disappeared " all the food. Te kwo kutL tE ma, "Fatherq is coming." It is found also as a compound of tl6m, thus: kw1&amp;tlm in contra- distinction to te-to1m. Smtbstantive Possessive Pronouns. Singular.

It is interesting to observe the reduplication of na to mark the plural in these and the other forms. There is no distinction between " inclusive " and " exclusive " forms in Sfcia,tl. A prepositional form is also used of the third person when the owner's name is mentioned. It is identical with that in the HalkmelEm; thus: s'na tla John stced6, tais is Joln's dog. Possession is also thus expressed in Sfciatl: " I 7have a horse," stekaiui tcinslna; you 7bave a 7horse," st6kaid tcEsAna; " he has a horse," stekaiTi tcEslnas, etc. Interrogative Pronouns. wat ? zvho ? wat-tcfiq ? who are you ? wat ci-ti nEat tU ? who made this? tfu-wat ? uhose ? wat ? whose ? n6tl wat ti ? whose is that ? stam ? what ? staim te-tl6m ? what is this ? stam tCE sqatLs ? what do you want? stami fya tCE sqatLs ? what does he want ? kwl'ntca ? where ? kwl'ntca tCE stekaiu ? where is your hog-se? n1tca ? which ? nPtca tCE tlumstan ? which is your, house ? Reflexive Pronouns. nomot, self. te-tcin-SEpE-nomot, I struck myself. This form is identical with that in the Sk qomic. In Sfciatl it is an essential constituent of passive verb formis and incorporative personal pronouns. Indefinite Pronouns. au-wat, anybody, watdsyE, somebody. Denonstratives. tE, t6, tetl6m, tdtloim, he, this, thatt; tiE, se, setlom, tlatlrnm, she, this, that. The above are used principally with the third person, but liot exclusively so. When the object is other than a person the following forms are usually employed: ti, this; ta, that (object little distance only from speaker). a ta, that (object farther off). a ta tefik, that (object very distant). There are no distinct forms to mark the plural. When it is desired to use theni in this sense the object suffers miodification, thus: ti tlAtlumstani, these houses; td tlatlumstan, those houtses.</page><page sequence="50">British Columitbia, a Coast -Division of the Salish Stock. 69 Articles. tE (nasculine), tIE (feminine), the, a; kwa, a.

Positive. Superlative. ei, good. t6qal't eI, best. Strictly speaking there are but two degrees of comparison of the adjective in Siciatl as given above, btut a kind of comparative is formed by using the superlative form with little stress. In other words the degree of excellence or its opposite is expressed rather by the voice than by the term. The loniger the expression is drawn out the more superlative it becomes. Verbs. The inflection of the verb in Sfciatl is effected as in the other Salish dialects examined by means of affixes and auxiliary verbs. The aorist or indefinite past is formed by prefixing the particle te. This corresponds to the e of the Sk qomic and Halk6melEmn dialects. The regular past is formed by affixing to the verb stem the particle 6tl; the etl of the other dialects. The future is expressed by the addition of the particle skwa. These are the principal tense signs in Siciatl. Intransitive Verb. Present Tense. Singular.
