Brother The history of the Discourse you are about to read is very simple. A little company of the Lay Brethren of Christ Church is wont to assemble every Sabbath even¬ ing in my cloister, because it is the lightest and airiest of the sacred establishment to which we belong, being right over the gateway, and having a skylight. Then and there, the statelier ser¬ vices of the day over, one or other of our com¬ pany delivers some digested word of his own to the rest. Finding ourselves placed midway between the Church and the World, the two great ends, we constantly hold in view, are the vindication of the one and the conversion of the other. We would vindicate the former by telling the modern world what the Church really believes ; and do our best towards the consummation of the latter, by showing how conformable that belief is with all that can be known about the Universe of God. Now, although our quiet proceedings have ar¬ rested the attention of some few familiars of our b 2</page><page sequence="6">own, who like to lounge a good deal about our gates and shady pleasure grounds, and are allowed to listen on the leads of the archway; and although we have incurred the censure of our ecclesiastical superiors, some of whose tale-bearers have been eaves-drop¬ ping, and not heard all, but run away with a phrase here and there; it has for some time been our con¬ viction that, true as it is that nothing is ever lost, it cannot be very useful to be preaching our gospel views only to each other, since we all believe the same thing in the same way. Accordingly, we have thought to try if our analytico-fidian Sermons, as one of the brethren likes to call them, meet and in any degree supply the wants of any the smallest section of the reading public, either in the Church or out of it. This is our first experiment; Brother Analysis' discourse having been chosen, not because it is a very favourable specimen of either himself or us ; but because it was our introductory address, and the theme was fallen on by lot. Reader, we com¬ mit it to thy charity. If the experiment be anywise successful, it will be repeated from time to time, till it cease to be so. If not, forgive us.

I have been determined to this by a multitude of external and inward forces, and if I did not believe that it is the very thing that is wanted, I should never have come before cither my brethren or thee as a Lay preacher. Alas the task is too great for my strength; but, if no one will rise and essay to do it, may I not provoke some giant to come forth by my insuffi¬ ciency Brother! God bless thy thoughts and mine! V.

Books are the strongest of all the embodiments of the power of man, for good or evil, over humanity; and the Bible is the divinest of all books, living and working, indeed, in one sense, alone in its divinity, as the specially inspired voice of God in the world. The Older Testament guided the lives of the wild- hearted and almost unmanageable Israelites through many a century, and was long their hardly violable bond as a people worshipping the invisible God of faith, in the midst of a thousand fears without, and fightings within. So did it continue, holding them up, checking, restraining, and otherwise teaching them the only rule of life, till their belief in it became adulterous, and produced Pharisees, Sad- ducees, and whatever else might be engendered by a loose faith, become false to her Lord, and turned to sundry of his creatures. There it stood, and moved before them like their old pillar, gather-</page><page sequence="10">ing ever new accessions of fire and brightness from the exspirations of its successive historians or epic poets, priests and prophets; leading them on to valiant conquests, self-defences, and endurances of conquest; and empowering them, more valiant still, to hold fast the profession of their faith, for at that inextinguishable flame, they lighted and lighted again the national eye of insight, which flashed its renovated fire on the gods of the nations by which they were beset, and showed them only wood and stone, or at the best only gold, which might be burnt to ashes, strawed upon the water, and drunk.* This would have been a great thing to have done, even for a wandering, fighting, and long victorious family of children of the desert like the Jews, and only during a few hundred years : a very great achievement for a growing book, and worthy of special notice in the history of the world, perhaps of the universe itself. The Old, however, was only the fore-runner of the New Testament; and the life which is told in the latter could not have been produced till the national life, which had been sustained by the Old, had died and gone to corruption, having latterly fed out of platters clean only outside, and, at length, buried * Exodus xxxii. 19. And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto tho camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cabt the tahles out of his hands, and brako them beneath the mount. And he took the call' which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawodit upon the water, and made the children of Isiael drink.</page><page sequence="11">9 itself alive in a whitcd sepulchre, full of dead men's bones. Aye and, if there is any sacred meaning in the history of mankind at all, that ever-blessed life could not have been led, or rather say under¬ gone, but among the half-believing, trampled, and sycophant remains of the Old Hebrews, with its formulism, scepticism, and meanness of every kind. Yet the ancient spirit was not wholly out; that would not have done either. There was even yet an Anna here and there; a Simeon, a Zachary, a Carpenter, in whom the ancestral ardour of pro¬ phetic intuition into the transcending majesty of Jehovah, and the all important and boundless nature of their allegiance to Him as their fathers' God and theirs, still burned inextinguishably. There was still sustenance and room enough for an Evan* gelist, in the wilderness of whose reserved and solitary heart that same perpetual fire had become pent up, till it burst out in flaming indignation against all who would not repent; quite change their flimsy way of looking on Godhood, God's universal system of things, and themselves, as little but altogether momentous and indispensable par¬ ticles of that system, and consequently of acting in relation to these ; and ' be saved,' as the phrase has come down big with eternal, unutterable, and every way infinite meaning. John the Baptist preached, baptized, and gathered many true disci¬ ples round him in the wilderness; for the Kingdom of Heaven was at hand : and it came.</page><page sequence="12">10 This is the right view for us, who live now, to take of the Old Hebrews, and the Old Hebrew Bible : the people, and worded system of belief and form of belief, the apotheosis and crumbling down of which was the political and spiritual ruin in which the Christ was born, and by his birth filled the one great vacuum which the earnest spirit of prophecy had long, or always, felt to be void; lived, and by living taught how to live aright; and suffered, to atone for all mankind by such suffering as His alone could be. The New Testament is the narra¬ tive of that Divine life in four Gospels, by two apostles and two early disciples, with some compara¬ tively unimportant, but yet invaluable, commentaries and illustrations by other hands, approved by their opportunities, and the Spirit of God which moved them, to be very well fitted for their several parts. That story of a life has, as you and all men know, revolutionized the world in the only good sense of the phrase, and, from a chaos which was almost wholly dark and downward in its rush, brought out another chaos indeed as yet, but at the very least an illumi¬ nated one, which can look up from many a bright spot in its darkling sphere, and see to arrange itself by slow but sure degrees into a heavenlike temple of universal faith, universal hope, and universal charity: but the greatest of these is charity. The beautiful vision is being realized around us even now, although we cannot understand the process 4</page><page sequence="13">11 wholly, nor count how many long years, or epochs, of transition, with its working; and counterworking of a thousand forces, have yet to make out the nonage of the world, and bring in the millennial con¬ summation. Such, however, in the meantime, is the resistless fashioning power, and its infolded destiny, which has been incorporated in the book of books, well called the Testaments, the gracious legacy of the Emmanuel, Jesus of Nazareth, and all the godly recorders, seers, and analysts who ushered the Prince of Peace into this life of time, and bore His train as He passed away again into eternity; of which we know nothing certainly, save that God is just and good. Seers and analysts, I say; and you wonder at the latter name. Analysts! Are there any scientific writers in the Bible is there human science there Is not Christianity a religion of faith, eclipsing all science, falsely so called, by its peerless glory, as the sun of day puts out the gleaming stars of night Have Christians anything to do with your ' Victori¬ ous Analysis ?' Yes, Brothers Christianity is a religion of faith, and of hope too, be it remembered, and charity; charity, which thinketh no evil; and hope, which is not ashamed to look forward to a more blessed time in eternity, when it shall see God face to face, and know Him as He is. It is a reli¬ gion of faith : poor inadequate Analysis would have toiled on to all eternity, and not made out the dis-</page><page sequence="14">12 covery of the being of God, the existence of the very world without, even of the ground of its own selfconfidence ; but a thousand thousandfold less, if there be degrees of sheer impotency, could it ever, ever have found out the mystery of the Divine Man, and his infinite secret of salvation. No man that ever sinned, and bled sweat and tears of blood for sinning, knew this more deeply than the inspired analyst, Saint Paul, of whom and whose way of writing about religion we are now to speak for a little ; and, I tell you once for all, not a childlike sage of the clearest telescopic vision, nor lowly Christian peasant, with well-thumbed Bible and healthy natural eyesight, can more thankfully appre¬ hend the same, than the uninspired analyst who now addresses you; for if he sees anything, from the sun to the paper lying before him, it is the blind and paralytic powcrlessness of analytical research in the sphere of faith. But then the sphere of faith would not be known to us as the sphere of faith at all, but for analysis, which, in a negative manner, as we will find, discovers that faith is faith, and nothing else: otherwise, it is an altogether unconscious faith, potential enough, blessed be God! potential to all purposes of time and time in eternity, but still not known, even by the most faithful, to be as dif¬ ferent from analysis as the sword or the scalpel from the hand that holds it. To illustrate this by an analogy. We believe</page><page sequence="15">13 in the existence of the material world by faith, believing we unquestioningly do, and in some measure refrain from doing, whatsoever is neces¬ sary to our salvation or safety in it, and thus we are physically saved by faith, and such works as that living faith produces. From the instant of Adam's creation it has always been so; faith in the contingent reality of things seen, heard, and otherwise perceived, saving men from physical ruin, everlasting in its way, in all ages: but it required a Thomas Brown to descry that faith is in this way the very foundation of even this physical life of ours. Having turned analysis outside in, and found it void of proof, or even presumptive evidence, of the existence of the visible universe, the analyst was forced to refer his immovable belief to a ' law of our nature,' as he calls it in the language of his school. Even at this time of day, very few know this first tenet of universal faith; and Lammenais and others absolutely need proclaim it in so many words yet. But suppose it universally recognized, would the belief itself become less powerful as a principle of action because analysis has discovered its deep foundation Nay! it has enhanced the incomprehensible sacredness of even physical duty. Avoid that raging torrent, do not walk into these curling flames, come out from beneath that toppling crag ; or else it will hurry thee away to death, they will consume thee irretrievably, it will crush thee to dust: How God animates every movement of the</page><page sequence="16">14 unconscious subject, Man, by the unheard, but effec¬ tive whisper of faith Is it nothing to give that still small voice a body, and make it audible Is it not rather a magical achievement to change all the studded canopy of heaven into one vast whispering gallery, resounding the call to faith in low melodious tone, by a word Analysis does this. To say the truth, however, analysis can do very little for us; for a short way beyond every point of the im¬ mense periphery of universal nature, it is resisted by impenetrable darkness, as of pitchblack marble, which will not be analyzed. Faith is very strong, and can remove mountains ; but it is not almighty even in the little domain of the human spirit, though it is nearly so. In fine, in order to make any ob¬ ject as intelligible as it is capable of being rendered, faith and analysis must work together, as the sun and moon combine to illuminate the earth; the moon meanwhile modestly acknow¬ ledging her dowery of radiance to the sun himself, the only independent source of light, whose celestial ray it is that kindles all the smaller orbs which revolve and sparkle round his central blaze. Hence Saint Paul tried to give a reason for the faith that was in him, and would have others do the same. Hence Victor Cousin, and others before and after him, have been busy maintaining, these latter years, that the mysteries of Christianity are given us under forms, quite adequate to the wants of the many as they are, which it is both right and dutiful for the</page><page sequence="17">15 few to approach with reverence and strive to unveil. I say nothing of the manner in which he, whom I have particularized by name, has striven, and its results; but his principle is surely good, and if analysts will only approach the sublime theme from the centre, and not from the circumference ; from the side of the internal objects of faith, and not the outward objects of analysis; they will do more towards the general spread of a catholic Christianity than has ever been endeavoured since the days of the apostles. They must likewise always remember the difference between Christianity the life, and Christianity the theory of life; else their efforts cannot be blessed. Heaven speed the work! St. Paul is the first analyst, or scientific author on Christian theory ; and of his work in that capacity we have a splendid instance in the chapter from which our golden text has been taken.* Throw your eye over it, and see how he unfolds his thought. The elders, the conquering men of the old time, become venerable by their very antiquity, and ever me¬ morable for their unflinching manhood in the hour of sore trial, had obtained a good report by gladly hoping for things not seen, eternal in the heavens. The apostle of the Gentiles, forced by the nature of * Ileb. xi. Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it tho elders obtained a good report. Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by God, &amp;c.</page><page sequence="18">16 his mission to ponder how his doctrines could be best grafted on whatever of good and true there might be found in men's preconceived systems, reflected on the secret of the faithful old life; sought far and wide, higher and deeper, for the ' substance,' or ground, on which their hopes re¬ posed, and, after spending his aquiline strength of wing in vain, discovered that there was none ; no comprehensible foundation for their deathless confi¬ dence. There is no intelligible, measurable, pon¬ derable evidence, not even presumptive court-of-law evidence to be found by searching : faith is the only substance of things hoped for, the only evi¬ dence of things not seen. But is that * only' little God forbid it is the very greatest of all 'ground' and * evidence ;' deepest rooted, immova¬ ble, and impenetrable rock. Again, the ancient recorders, who wrote the narra¬ tives of the Creation, which Moses afterwards put together, one after another, at the beginning of his own book of Genesis, did not investigate : they simply and solemnly announced that in the begin¬ ning God created the heaven and the earth, having seen so far into the mystery of material objects and phenomena which a Christian poet* of our own day has sung as " The silent magnanimity of nature and her God." All following historians, prophets, and poets in the sacred line, had taken the relation of the visible * Thomas Aird, Esq., Othuriel and other poems.</page><page sequence="19">17 universe to the unseen Jehovah as a thing which needed and brooked no proof: How manifold, O Lord, are all thy works!—nor ever knew, in the truth of their believing loyalty, that they had done what the faithless mechanical philosophy of the eighteenth century of a Christendom was to thiuk it had discovered to have been done amiss. Then, not to speak of the Divine utterances of the Christ himself, Saint John speaks from the living heart of inspiration, without either doubt or scientific ques¬ tion, In the beginning was the Word. Who knows but this unconscious, but irresistible belief, was the better? But for Saint Paul, and his vocation in the world, this was not enough. No sceptic was he ; tempered and impenetrable as a sheething of triple steel was his faith ; well as he knew anything, did he know that God is the beginning and end of all things; but how did he come to know and believe it so immovably that was the question for him. He flew abroad everywhere, dived deep and soared high, looked and listened everywhere for some sign or sound of the mystery; but none was to be seen or heard. Yet, that one theorem solved, a hundred others would be clear as day; but, alas! there was no solution ; pretentious solutions, a priori demonstrations and arguments of design, vanished in air before his keen analytic glance; there was no evidence, it would appear. His weary eye turns in upon himself; and there it is, lucid as light: It is through faith that we understand that the worlds B</page><page sequence="20">MMMBI 18 were made by God Oar fathers, of whom we cry, where are they had the same ground for their duty producing hope of things unseen as they had, as we have, as any man ever shall have, for the being of God and his creative attribute: Was it not stronger than adamant A seraphic proclamation this to every succeeding age, which has been sadly neglected and insulted in this of ours, with its arguments a pos- teriore and Bridgewater treatises. This is Saint Paul's great discovery about faith, the greatest of a merely scientific kind that ever was made. All the faithful before him had known the subduing power of faith ; the great Teacher had spoken much about it; but it was this greatly gifted man's commission to discover it, as we say, to unfold its far and near analogies, to show it in relation to all its different objects, from the contingently real world of outward appearances up to eternal God¬ head and Emmanuel themselves, and to assign it its fundamental place in the microcosm of the human mind. A noble mission, too, it was ; for mark he stands like a good soldier of the cross on that rock of ages, and throws down the gauntlet of an earnest pitying defiance to all deniers of the Christ and his Gospel in time to come, saying, You cast away our message of truth for want of evidence, forsooth, and trample our pearl under foot; tell me, tell the world, tell yourselves, what feasible evidence you can produce for the being of God ; or if you deny that too, for the existence of the very</page><page sequence="21">19 universe of stars which you hug to your bosoms so fondly Is it, too, a superstition Nay! you cannot live without one reality ; and I beseech you, by your hold of that one, to see to the others ; they may not be shadows, after all. And, O what speechless solace and courage does the *manly challenge, sounding through eighteen hundred years, impart to the half fledged honest thinker, who had else quit his faith in God, and gone wandering about the dreadful universe in despair, weeping aloud. Such is the analytical process by which the apostle arrived at the sight of the function of faith, the power of which he knew far otherwise than by investigation. Faith itself cannot be analyzed; it can only be seen after everything else has been thoroughly sifted by analysis, and blown out of the way; objectively considered, it can only be known by negation; that it is belief, not founded on ' ground' and * evidence,' in the common meaning of these words, is all that can be said. Experimen¬ tally, on the other hand, faith is clung to by all men in respect of one object at the very least, and its foundation is broader and deeper than space itself. Who ever wholly disbelieved that there is a world without him ; or, at least, that there is reality neither without nor within him ; or, rather, who ever believed absolutely nothing And on what ' ground' does this last refuge of a solitary belief rest Surely on nothing, or an immensity The Gospel of the Christ is built on the same foundation. b 2</page><page sequence="22">20 We need not follow our apostolic correspondent through the remainder of the chapter. Suffice it, he proceeds to display a number of the practical analogies of the faith he came to preach, and espe¬ cially exhibits it as the soul of heroic acts of valour by the worthies of Old Testament history and poetry. At the seventeenth verse he will seem to most of you to have reached a climax, from which he has only to go down on the other side, By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: so that it is perhaps just as well as could have been that the lot fell on this eleventh chapter and seventeenth verse of the Epistle to Hebrews. It is the guiding and nobilita- ting power of faith that is both the test and the glory of every true Gospel, and the apostle passes at once to the contemplation of the blessed union of the light of intuition with the strength of endeavour in the lives of the patriarchs, as manifested by some of their bravest doings and most willing endurances. Paul addressed all kinds of men ; for the super¬ stitious he had the dignity of so-called reason to assert; on the narrow, the suasion of Divine charity to inculcate; for the sceptic, an analysis, as we have found, so searching and inevitable, that, after con¬ fessing its own insufficiency, it magnified the might of faith ; but he never forgot the grand end of his vocation, and always wrote for all when he seemed to write for one. We have all to lead a life ; the superstitious, the sectarian, the sceptic, the fidianist, have all need to be saved ; there is no</page><page sequence="23">21 difference there, but such a momentous similarity, that it swallows up all the trivial distinctions of society. Our gifted analyst, as we call him in this discourse, knew this well, if not better than perhaps any other man ever did. Oh wretched man that I am he cried. He found a law in his members warring against the law of his mind. Brother, is this common, and often commonplace enough, con¬ tentiousness of our double nature, a fierce fight in thy breast It was horrid war in Paul's ; and he groaned aloud to the universe in his extremity, Who will deliver me from the body of this death Who? Is not the atonement of these asundertearing forces the very greatest achievement for us all, and infinite in its greatness Every one of us, who does not feelingly know that this is the pro¬ blem he was sent hither from the abysm of infinitude to solve in the sight of the whole creation, only shows that he is no longer a man at all, and needs be raised again to the manhood he has fallen from, before he can become Godlike by the renewing of his will. To know our duty, on the right ' ground' and 'evidence,' is the first part of Christianity; to do it with all our might, is the unavoidable consequence of such knowledge of it. As for the rationaU of Christianity the life, we can never understand it; but if we succeed in any measure in the practice of it, shall be glad to bless God, who worketh in us to will and do according to his good pleasure : Shall we not</page><page sequence="24">22 Let us now see how Abraham knew that it was his duty to offer up Isaac, and observe how man¬ fully he lacerates his heart and flesh to do it; and, in that way, both sec a little farther into the apostle's theory of faith, and learn a lesson of rough, but true, and invincible goodness. There are few stories more princely in them¬ selves, or more beautifully told, than the life of Abraham by Moses. The social, moral, and intel¬ lectual, or in one word, the spiritual horizon, how¬ ever, in which the liver and the narrator lived and told, was so entirely different from that on which we look round nowadays, that it demands an effort so to sympathize with the history, as to understand its real import in relation to the theory of life. In the book itself, too, we have the minds of Abraham and Moses combined, as it were, and the product is the Mosaic ideal of Abraham's way of living; a model full of instruction. In youth, he takes his sister Sarai to wife ; a fair woman to look upon, but she is barren, and has ' no child,' it is said. Their native land of Ur cannot hold everybody ; so old Terah, their father, goes forth with them into the land of Canaan, new settlers in a strange country, having to make their way as they best can with their herds and flocks. Terah dies at Haran. Abraham is now the pa¬ triarch of a growing household of kindred and dependents, and the master of great possessions. It</page><page sequence="25">23 behoves him to be up and doing now. He meditates what he will do. The new patriarch is a man of energic individuality of character. His strong heart is fit to be the first strong heart of a people. Stirred by his inward consciousness of strength, he even dreams of coming glory as the fountain of a great nation, destined to flow out with blessings on the green face of the free world that is all before him. Ah how can that be, since his fair wife has no child But it behoves him to go forth; such going forth is the law of the time and scene, in which he must live and let live ; and he is strong and fit to try the world, fitter than any; it is his duty, and he will do it. Shall he not go forth full of hope Shall he alone, of all men, address him¬ self to the task of life without any cherished ideal of earthly bliss laid to heart and there was no other than this of originating nations, and branching out into futurity, for heroic men to cherish thenadays ; and is not such ideal, to all men, only the image of eternity flickering in the troubled waters of time Shall he not rather trust in God Does he, weak man, know anything of Heaven's will concerning his Sarai and himself? Who knows, save that God is good Yea what has he to believe, if not that He must, and will believe it; it is the voice of the Lord; so Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken to him.* Strong as death is the gentle patriarch's * Genesis xi. 27. Terah begat Abram and Abram and Nahor took them wives : the name of Abram's wife was</page><page sequence="26">24 faith in the benignant purposes of God from the very first. This is a picture of his whole inward life. In all his wanderings, he knows God to be no idol crea¬ ture, but great and good, the greatest and the best, the infinitely great and good ; and he goes every¬ where unto the place of the altar, and calls upon the name of the Lord. In every juncture of his affairs his question is, What is right to be done a question of duty, which is all in all to him, being of incalculable significance ; and he essays to do what God tells him is right, like a man, and never shrinks ; for it is his errand to do the will of God, and the image of duty which lies clear in his heart of hearts is that will of God, which he must enact, or be lost. The unfathomably deep earnestness of this lordly man, and others, his peers, written down in this book of books, and so long preserved by the wondrous providence of God, tells us, and all the world, a Sarai but Sarai was barren and had no child. And Terali took Abram his son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees to go into the land of Canaan. And Terah died in Haran. Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee : And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing : And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee ; and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him.</page><page sequence="27">25 lesson, which it is at our peril if we neglect. What¬ soever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no device nor work in the grave, whither thou hastenest. Is there nothing puerile in this conception of the patriarchs, that their own prayerful, ineradicable sense of duty was the will, or living voice, of God Far from it; it was the height of manhood, if you will only think of it. Conscience is not a balance to weigh good against evil: understanding, memory, perception, sensation, have nothing to do with it; nor can it be proved, in any logical way, that duty must be the infinitely best thing for a man to do. The line of duty cannot be described a priori; cannot be discovered by the induction of particular instances ; and there is no other way than these two for the human mind to discover, and tell itself the truth. What, then, is conscience, which bids us do this good thing, and withhold from that ill, and do or not do at our own endless risk Is it not the living voice of God Besides, you must always bear in mind that Moses wrote for a people living under a visible form of Divine government, or theocracy, and for all the people in many ages to come. He likewise composed his noble books in the light of the past, and, knowing all that had come out of Abraham and his doings, and how signally he had been approved by the ensuing providence of God, he speaks with the confidence and predisposition of a historian of the good man's faith in the future. In</page><page sequence="28">26 truth, before any of us can really change hearts in imagination with these elders of the world, we must change heads too, and unlearn all that is either useful or useless, or worse than useless, of what we now know; for the latter centuries of Europe have shown that, according as analysis with all its conquests has waxed, faith with its priceless heritage has waned; although, now that the elo¬ quence of the apostolic analyst has found an echo here and there in the modern world, there is at length some distant prospect of the glorious union of faith and thought. Meanwhile, think of the entire absence of anything like analysis, and of anything like a consciousness of faith, in a very strong and faithful man like the Patriarchal Abraham, with his ebullient oriental blood, and quaint but impassioned soul. What a spectacle for the like of us to look upon So went the good man on his way, journeying always, increasing wealth, building altars and plant¬ ing groves, fathering Ishmael, entertaining angels unawares, reaping the reward of his faithfulness in the person of Isaac at last, conferring with Melchi- sedec, dealing with princes, and alas! burying his dead out of his sight, then producing sons and daughters from Keturah and his concubines ; till at length he is gathered to his people. Through all his unresting but dignified life, he approved himself endowed with a true eye for the path of all holy duty and a resolute will, for the most part,</page><page sequence="29">27 to walk in it; but, above all, a passionate unparal¬ leled faith in the Divine origin of his own dutiful impulsions, whenever they could not be traced to any intelligible source, and accorded with the gene¬ ral theory of religion in which he lived and moved ; a possession the last, of which, to be acceptable in the sight of God, unconsciousness is an essential element, so that no analyst can ever acquire it. These three things, or rather the one of which they are the constituents, make up the whole religious character of Abraham, being the gospel which he preached by his life. It grew up by natural pro¬ cess, aided by the changing circumstances of its outward relations, to be the law and the pro¬ phets ; till it culminated at last, and was expanded into the glorious universal gospel of the life and death of Our Lord and Saviour. By the life of Jesus, we mean all He taught by word or deed; and by His death, all He suffered so to teach; for cling you to what scientific hypothesis of the facts of Christianity you will, Romanism, Lutheranism, Calvinism, or which you will, although they cer¬ tainly cannot all be wholly true, there is no doubt that they are all true enough for the one main thing, a pious life, and the practical meaning of them all is that the Christ is continually teaching us how to live and die. This threefold principle, which we recognize in the piety of the venerable patriarch of the Jews, is indeed the very kernel of both Judaism and Christianity, although the expression of it has</page><page sequence="30">28 to be altered to circumstances, and will always have to be so; and hence it is with singular propriety that Paul adduces the faith which empowered Abra¬ ham to stretch forth his hand, and take the knife to slay his son, as the fit analogon and mirror of that fuller faith, which he came to preach. It is a strange episode in the story of Abraham that which the apostle instances. Think of it. More than a hundred years old, a good deal more. Deeply conscious of a thousand short-comings, as how could a prayerful soul of large experience like him, and an eye of faith so susceptive that God spake to him face to face, fail to be An old man now, full of sins ; a long life, in which he could see little that was good, however he might shine before men; a long life behind, a sepulchre before him. Does he not need throw himself upon the lovingkindness of the Everlasting God, and be saved by sovereign grace Sacrifice has been all his days the language of prayer for him ; burnt-offerings on memorable occa¬ sions. Ah, me is not this a memorable time A dim-lit life's vista to look back upon ; a dark sepul¬ chral cave, and whatever that might mean, to anti¬ cipate in wildering alternation of hope and fear. But what sacrifice, what Has he not offered a hundred thousand times, and yet found no ' assu¬ rance of salvation,' as too arrogant men are to find so easily sometime O, what shall he render saiS£aai</page><page sequence="31">29 What word utter in sacrificial deed, any more than a Paul with his groanings that cannot be uttered Light dawns on his dark inward conflict, one ray of hope: what does he love the most of all his great possessions; for is not that the same question Round which have his heart-strings been the most idola- trously bound And he will give it; that is his duty, and he must do it. He bethinks him, what Woe is me it is his young Isaac, the only son of beautiful Sarai, who. long ago became the wife of his youth in their birth-land of Ur, but had no child till God gave her this : and his old frame cracks, and rocks again to its rooted centre of faith, in the fell struggle; but shall he shrink when he is called the cup that is given him shall he not drink Father glorify thy name. Surely it is not wonderful that a truehearted man like this, on Mount Moriah should discover, like a sun flash, in the moment of worshipful anguish when he was a thrusting the knife into the side of his only son whom he loved, that God, who judgeth the heart and loveth a cheerful giver even as an Abraham loves an only son, no longer required such a sacrifice at his paternal hand. The imperial sense of duty, with its eternal dependencies, known and willed into act by faith in God and his own conscience, was appeased; and, by faith Abraham, when he was</page><page sequence="32">30 tried, offered up Isaac. About his great emo¬ tions when he lifted up his eyes and, behold, behind him a ram caught by the horns, we can only be silent: My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt- offering. In truth, I would have been ashamed to have said so much, but for the purpose in hand. The Mosaic narrative needs no paraphrase, and can¬ not be bettered in any way.* A word more on this subject. Suppose Abraham to have related this passage of his inward life to the gentle Isaac, what phraseology would he use? Isaac many a time dwells fondly on it with Rebecca • Genesis xxii. And it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham : and he said, Behold, here I am. And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you. And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together. And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering? And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt-offering;</page><page sequence="33">31 and their sons; as we remember to have seen our own beloved fathers hang, with what seemed to us a most ideal love, though very beautiful, over oft repeated stories about our grandsires: and so it is handed down through all varieties of fortune, till it assumes its present graceful form in the Genesis of the quiet, and eminently conceptive, lawgiver of the great patriarch's descendants. Ask yourselves, how could it have been preserved otherwise than as it is, say as an analyzed spiritual phenomenon, such as I have shown you And if it, and all the world- old ark of faith of which it is only one beautiful gem, had not been transmitted from age to age, where had Moses and the Prophets been with their indig¬ nant defiance of idolatry ; where, with reverent ad¬ miration of the good providence of God be it asked, the ever blessed Christ and his crowning gospel; Paul and his adaptation of that gospel to the human mind grown analytical; the partial regeneration of so they went both of them together. And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abra¬ ham, Abraham : and he said, Here am I. And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him : for now I know thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me. And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught by the horns, &amp;c.</page><page sequence="34">32 the Roman empire for the wisest of purposes; the impregnation of Europe with an inextinguishable germ of Christianism before the roaring torrent of barbaric hosts could come, and sweep it away for ever ; and the Genesis of our growing Christendom, with its restless energies unconsciously struggling towards repose, like a giant in troubled sleep, who will awake, wonder at his garish agonies, and walk forth in indomitable strength? Moreover, but for this riverlike spiritual history of our marvellous age, (for every age is its own greatest miracle, as every man is his,) there had been no need of trans¬ lating the language of unconscious faith, employed thirty centuries ago by a desert legislator, in telling his wandering people how their valiant ancestry had stood to the fight of life, into the phraseology of analytical fidianism, in order to fill the aching void, which now yawns in many an earnest heart between the scepticism of the last century and the ultra- fidianism just opening on the present. Such man¬ ner of translation is the next thing theologians have to do, to meet the hungry necessities of an army of inquirers, fearfully dead to the irrefragable reality of religious duty, though it has given over infidelity, and wanders about in dreadful uncertainty, not knowing what to believe and do, as well it may in the midst of such spiritless interpretations almost everywhere. Let the example of Saint Paul be strenuously imitated by the leaders of the host, whose high and bounden duty it is, like him, to</page><page sequence="35">33 adapt the doctrine of the gospel to the accumulat¬ ing results of general investigation in the successive times in which they teach ; and that not by any kind of trimming of the everlasting word, but by so producing it as to satisfy every ear that it is in the divinest harmony with every other true word that has been spoken. The apostolic leader did this for Jerusalem and Rome in his day ; let them try to do -it for Europe in theirs. He has shown the way, having gone as far as there was any need for when he lived ; but they must not ignobly stop where he has left them, seeing everything else has advanced so far, and so many new spiritural appetencies have sprung up to be appeased. No cased in his in¬ vincible breast-plate of faith, and armed with his two-edged sword of spiritual discernment, let them bravely stand to every danger, and grapple with every difficulty like the ministers of salvation : So accoutred it is not in man to dare enough. Alas cowardice in this task was the proximate cause of the withering unbelief which even yet broods over the face of British society, though it has unques¬ tionably begun to pass away : And I tremble to see the same cowardice now becoming the source of a diluted universal fidianism ; a new misbelief, which is almost as different from the specific faith of Christianity, and the clear faith philosophy of Saint Paul, as infidelity itself. Aye and it has produced a more fatal curse than even these ; a kind of mole- eyed half belief among the multitude, who have not</page><page sequence="36">34 strength enough to fling themselves off the rock on which they were born, clung to by them not in fear or empyrean hope, but solely because they cannot venture away. This is the worst state of all. Why, Infidelity and universal fidianism both meet Chris¬ tianity half way; the former asserting the right of analysis which Christianity admits, and its failure in discovering either God or salvation, which Saint Paul pointed out long ago, though with a very different conclusion ; and the latter proclaiming the su¬ premacy of faith, which is the foundation of the universe, on which Christianity is reared. Take even poor thirsty Materialism, spite of all the con¬ tempt which has been heaped upon it by half believers of every grade, and I will say it is better than such religion. Does it not ennoble matter more than it degrades spirit, and deify the visible uni¬ verse more than it solidifies God Reply charitably. What is matter An aggregation of atoms: and what is an atom A centralized force of repulsion : and what is force Can you see, any more than poor Materialism with its one eye But, be that unfa¬ thomable mystery as it may, Materialism has, at least, thought about things; and the spiritual and physical phenomena of the universe are the same to him as to you ; so that if he feelingly assign them all to matter, what a Divine seeming power must matter be to him and how superior to the drivel of com¬ placent half belief, which has never thought at all, but assigns them to a name. Yes, Brothers!</page><page sequence="37">35 half belief in the blessed Bible, especially when mistaken for full faith, is worse than either infi¬ delity or general fidianism ; and, from a somewhat copious experience in different countries as well as in many different classes of society, I infer, and believe, that among the younger men there is almost no other than such sleek half belief now extant in Great Britain. Catechize them about God's dealings with the Jews, prophecy, miracles, salvation by faith, or the incarnation ; and you will see. They neither believe nor misbelieve in the very devil: But how can it be otherwise, if no one will tell them what the book of books wholly means, that they may know what they are to believe and do with all their might This is the urgent problem for the Church to try. For the sake of the glory of the Everlasting, and the well-being of man, let it be solved. We must always deduce some useful rule of life for the hour of trial from our Sabbath evening themes. Such instruction is not far to seek tonight. It is a serious thing to die: aye, but it is more serious still to live. This world of ours is no opera house for lightsome plays of many-coloured life, or battle field for crowns, or hunting ground for wild sports, or warehouse for merchandize, or arena for shows and games of competition, or university in the commonwealth of stars for all kinds of study,</page><page sequence="38">36 or even a pleasant land of homes for' domestic quietude ; nor yet is it a sink in the galaxy of sun and planets for loathsome frolic, nor a hospital for the diseases of the universe, nor a treadmill to grind poor man in : nay it may be all these together by sufferance of the Creator, but it is a myriadfold more by His grace. Here we are : but whence have we hastened hither and whither are we hurrying away so fast Analysis cannot tell. Faith can only say, From God to God again. How shall we best return to Him from whom we have come forth? By the path of duty, according to the universal faith of mankind : but where is that narrow way, that we may know to enter? That the specific faith of Christianity alone can teach, few and simple though the details be; but the subject in hand relates to only one of these. The re¬ ligion of Abraham was the religion of boundless allegiance to infinite Godhood as revealed by in¬ dwelling conscience; the written law having not yet arrived. Believe in God, not by mock evidences and dead demonstrations, but by faith; believe in the infini¬ tude of duty, and that too by living faith ; and I defy you not to strive with agonies as great as Abra¬ ham's to discharge the obligation, even as you fly from devouring fires in the existence of which, and their destructive power over your shrinking flesh, you believe by faith too, as we have seen already, and shall illustrate at length some other evening. All</page><page sequence="39">- 37 the difference between Abraham and you, on the one hand, and between yourselves as conscious crea¬ tures living in an inward world, and yourselves as sentient inhabitants of a solid external world, is one of faith. Believe in the incomputable obligation of moral duty, say the duty of doing justice, as earnestly as the shipwrecked mariner believes the raving sea around him to be a hungry grave; and you will either struggle to do justly, or give it over in de¬ spair, and be lost. It is not enough that, upon occa¬ sional reflection or in transient moments of insight, you say, I believe in God and duty: you must be¬ lieve without reflection, and as instinctively, unfail¬ ingly, and irresistibly as you believe in the thirst by which you are consumed, and in the healing waters by which alone your thirst can be assuaged. This is living faith. This threefold object of faith, God, conscience, and duty which unites them, is the first stone of our most holy religion : we shall afterwards see how the second and third were successively added; till the chief corner stone itself was laid. Nor is it ever superseded, but shall be at the bottom of every Chris¬ tian life till the end of time. Whatsoever a man KNOWS TO BE HIS DUTY AND YET REFRAINS FROM DOING, BE THE THING EVER SO LITTLE OR THE TEMPTATION EVER SO GREAT, IS A DEADLY SIN, AND THAT INDEPENDENTLY OF ALL WRITTEN LAWS WHATEVER ; DEADLY, FOR EITHER DUTY HAS NO MEANING AT ALL, OR ITS SIGNIFICANCE IS IMMENSE</page><page sequence="40">38 and eternal. This is the great common law of all religions, whereby, according to Saint Paul, the heathen are a law unto themselves : it is the begin¬ ning and end of Christianity as a code of practica¬ ble principles : towards this have we all to strive, honestly to be and do all we believe we ought to do and be. O, let us be brave in this fell conflict of conscience and rebellious passion : there-is no other war field to try it in, no fiercer enemy to cope with, no more glorious victory to win; and defeat will be irretrievably terrible to the dree. Sinner it is to no purpose that thou dost not feel it to be a fight at all; it is the worse for thee; the foe has thrown thee into a false slumber by some deadly stratagem: awake, buckle on thine armour, stand to thy post, heed not thy gaping wounds. Ah me! thou groanest aloud in pain, bleedest too much, madly staggerest in the unequal contest, reelest to the ground a hundred times : who is sufficient for these things Is there no help — Yes, poor struggler! endure a little longer: there is an ever welling foun¬ tain of grace to refresh thy broken spirit, a helmet of safety to wear, a breastplate of faith to put on, a sword of subtlest edge which even thou mayst wield, and a rock of promise for thee to stand upon invincible. Such, my brothers, is the maddening rout, of light battling with victorious darkness, on which the Sun of righteousness has arisen with healing on his beams: a consummation memorable in the annals of eternity.</page><page sequence="41">LAY SERMONS THEORY OF CHRISTIANITY, No. II.</page><page sequence="42">wpp mm</page><page sequence="43">LAY SERMONS THEORY OF CHRISTIANITY, BY A COMPANY OF BRETHREN.

The fact that I come before you once more is holh the proof and the result of your generosity; for, if you had not deigned to read my former discourse, 1 would not have produced another. The success, which attended the ' Fidianism of Saint Paul,' has emboldened our Brotherhood to send forth a some¬ what systematic series of sermons, which I have already delivered before them, upon the universal generic faith of Humanity, and the specific faith of Christianity, as engrafted on that imperishable old stock. You will be pleased to consider what I have said about the Patriarch Abraham and his way of living, and Saint Paul with his secret of the Abrahamic life, rather as a specimen of the manner in which my brethren are wont to speak of the theory of Christianity, than as any part of the theory itself. a 2</page><page sequence="46">The very nature of it, you observe, rendered it impossible that it should be wholly intelligible to any but the brotherhood ; and you cannot have been so ungenerous as to have condemned it for a quality, which is thus inseparable from its character as an incidental address to a company of initiates. The text itself was taken by lot; and the dis¬ course will be at least quite comprehensible, I will venture to say wholly free of everything like mist at any rate, after the systematic series, which is now to proceed, shall have been perused. Never¬ theless, as the overture in music is a swift and fitful prelude of the kinds of melody which are to follow in the statelier procession of the whole piece; so the abrupt, but I trust not immethodical blast, which has already been sounded, must have prepared you, in some degree, for our full charge. We are now acquainted with each other; you with our de¬ sign, and we with your expectation. If we do not edify and please, you will fall away from us, and we shall be fain to retire into the sanctuary of our own hearts; whence I, for one, would never have come out, but for the sublime attraction of human sym¬ pathy. Generous Reader! now that I am fairly afield, I beg you to believe that every word I shall say about the mysteries of the most holy Religion of Christen¬ dom, shall have been ground out of me by the forces of that universe of sensation, consciousness, and conscience, athwart the conflicting light and</page><page sequence="47">darkness of which we are both wending our rapid way towards the true immensity, with its everlasting alternatives of good or ill. That is my part of our mutual task ; and, let me remind you, it is yours, either to make sure that your companion is one of a company of men who have no eye for the beauty of truth at all, or give earnest heed to our sincerity. —»«®»&lt;«~- One other word or two; and altogether in my own name now. Since the publication of our first number, a curious circumstance has occurred—nay, I would not have your curiosity too much excited, for, after all, it is a very trifling thing, and may annoy rather than instruct, or even amuse you. Everything, however, has its significance, and this may have its meaning too, both for myself and my reader ; so it had better be mentioned and dismissed. Besides, the particular and the special are always true types of the general and the universal; so that what I have to record about my private life will stand for some part of the great history of mankind, if it be told aright. Well! you must know that Christopher Analysis, my reverend father, was essentially a man of faith, but was not aware of it. I would describe him as a thin, dark, yearning man, who worked hard and humbly all his days in the ' service of Christ,' and was sustained under the load of his meek labours by the incessant</page><page sequence="48">6 pulse of a strong heart of faith, without ever knowing he had such a heart at all: like an old Hebrew man of God in this respect. There was this essential dis¬ tinction between the Abrahamic kind of faith, how¬ ever, and his: both unconscious, the former was quite unaccompanied by anything like analysis, as we have seen and admired already; while the latter was absolutely hidden from its possessor, though not from Him who ' seeth in secret,' by the overgrowth of modern science. Standing before the altar, he loved to pursue the planets in their invisible pathways round the sun; to track the flow¬ ing blood of life, from heart to heart again, through the myriad smooth channels and emunctories of the alembic circulation in his own surpassing frame ; and thence to think that he inferred the existence and attributes of a God, to the great corroboration of the truth of Revelation. I remember how he would lead me away, yet a child, to some expanse of seaside sand, when the tide had ebbed ; draw a threefeet sun with his staff; put on all the planets, satellites, and comets at their right distances, and of their proportional sizes ; trace their manifold interweaving orbits ; and then, with glistening eye now upturned to the blaz¬ ing sun on high, and now bent down on the radiated sand at our feet, set them all a-swimming in their appointed courses among the blue ether of Heaven : and bid me conclude that such stupendous mechan¬ ism and exquisite design implied Divinity. Then those big, tortuous, and purpled veins on the back</page><page sequence="49">of his aged hand, how many a lesson -about the Great Designer did he read from them, blessed characters that they were, as I sat upon his knee, with the clustering group of sisters and brothers about us, when the Sabbath days came round Our orreries upon the beach were swept away almost as soon as they were made; and the substance of those distended bloodvessels, which used to be our dia¬ grams of physiology, has long ago gone down dust to dust, melted away into the common ocean of organific matter, and sprung up anew in, God only knows how many, beautiful forms of life ; but there shall cease to be any unity in my successive days, when I forget these paternal instructions. Heaven forbid it! for what can we bo without sim¬ plicity of progress from year to year, but suicidal rebels against the deepest and widest of the laws of the very world in which we have been appointed to dwell The truth is that the beauty and magnificence of the mere external machinery of the universe, and the power of the intellectual instrumentality by which these have been expounded with such signal success in our centuries, lay too heavy on my ho¬ noured father's mind; and that combined with his immovable faith in Christianity to produce a character, which is very nearly universal among the religious men of the present day in Britain. For example, he thought that he believed the word, and consequently the divinity, of the Christ, because the</page><page sequence="50">man Jesus had given irresistible ' evidence,' in his miracles, of the divinity of his mission ; and that the proof accumulated to infinitude by the addition of the ' evidence' of prophecy, the 'evidence' of the general fitness of thegospel of peace to the constitution of man, and the like. Accordingly his conception of the mys¬ teries proper, such as the Holy Trinity, was that they resemble the solar system before the rise of Coper¬ nicus, Kepler, and Newton; and that they may all become comprehensible in God's own good time, if not on earth, at least in heaven. I say he thought that such was the foundation of his belief, or rather perhaps that such might be the foundation of a right Christian belief to others; for, after all, this was only his scientific statement of the theorem of Christianity, which is a very different thing, for every man, from the reality of the Christian life. Abraham's religion was that of unconscious faith without any analysis, and necessarily assumed no spoken form, but could neither be heard nor seen, being his very self. My father's was the product of unconscious faith and conscious analysis, and it has been that of most reflective pious Britons since the philosophy of Locke was infused into our theology. That which my brethren have become minded to preach, with such power as may be given them, is the religion of conscious faith discovered, and then aided by, conscious analysis; and that by no means as originators, for it is as old as Paul, who was the first analytical writer on</page><page sequence="51">Christianity. Not as originators of any novelty, but as men who have themselves passed through every form of scientific doubt and dismay, and yearn to clear the much obstructed passage towards the one true religion of charity, for the sake of such as may stand in jeopardy, and need their aid ; believing that if they prove unequal to the task of doing any good in this sphere of endeavour, they shall only fail in the best of causes. Nay 1 although they may at first seem to differ from every one of the many statements of Christian doctrine, which appear to the sceptic and the denier to be so many different systems of belief altogether, they feel well assured that they in reality agree with them all, in a certain high sense. Having no right to speak as theologians, they will never presume to do so. They only stand forward with the Bible on one hand and the Universe on the other, and, as the humble readers of both these public manuscripts of the Most High, burn with the desire of doing all they can to symphonize the general theory of the latter with the most orthodox Christianity. Only have patience. To return to my allegorical biography. You will not wonder when I tell you that, on the occasion of my birth in France, Christopher resolved to call his son Victorious, in spite of the humorous remon¬ strances of Old Fidian, the paternal, almost brotherly and inseparable friend of his youth. Moreover, I am sure you must applaud the patience with which I have borne about with me the hateful</page><page sequence="52">10 epithet, and never complained nor given it up, even since I abandoned universal scepticism. Indeed my long suffering is at length rewarded in the due course of Providence; and this ought to serve for an example to both of us, of God's way being ever the best: for, since last November, my Christian name has been changed by a formal process of law; and this is what I wish to speak about. It happened thus. The good, very trustful, and consequently happy friend of my father's youth chanced to love me so dearly as to make me free of his home and cheer, when left an orphan boy in this wide inquiring world, where I had no other to care for me. In truth he loved me like a son; and little wonder, for I had been affianced from the very cradle to his favourite child, Kind Charity with her tremulous blue eye of hope. Ah me the maid told her whispered message of gentlest amity, told it very gracefully, and then hasted away again, full of pitying love, to the bosom of God who sent her hither for a time: and I await her return to this sunlit vale of tears, at the second coming of our Lord with all the rest of his holy angels. Little wonder, then, that Old Fidian pitied and loved young Analysis, presumptuous scapegrace though he was, and wept tears of joy when he heard from a far country that his ward had, by favour of Heaven, wholly changed the theory and practice, or in one word the meaning of his life, and become like</page><page sequence="53">11 a 'little child.' Less wonder still that, since I had already lost so much, he should resolve to constitute me the heir of his possessions; for he was rich, and had laid up great treasures in heaven, especially one goodliest pearl, as you may understand. Well! the faithful man has just at length been gathered to his fathers, and has willed me the priceless in¬ heritance, burdened with the sole condition that I assume his name, and assimilate his nature to my own. Gentle Reader! this is why I now sign myself, Your loving Brother, Fidian Analysis Christ Cnuncir, Tullus, January 1, A D. 184 2.</page><page sequence="54">For the worthy Knight could answer all the objections of the Devil and reason " with the odd resolution he had learnt of Ter- tullian : Cerium est quia impossibile est. It is certainly true, be¬ cause it is quite impossible!" Now this I call Ultra-fidianism. Again, there is a scheme constructed on the principle of retain¬ ing the social sympathies, that attend on the name of a believer, at the least possible expenditure of belief; a scheme of picking and choosing Scripture texts for the support of doctrines, that had been learned beforehand from the higher oracle of common sense; which, as applied to the truths of religion, means the popular part of the philosophy in fashion. Of course, the scheme differs at dif¬ ferent times and in different individuals in the number of articles excluded; but, it may always be recognized by this permanent character, that its object is to draw religion down to the believer's intellect, instead of raising his intellect up to religion. And this extreme I call Minimi-fidianism.

You were nursed among alternate tears and smiles, now nestling in a mother's bosom with the clear eye of love upon you, and then sprawling in some spasm of infancy refusing to be soothed. Your childhood was a sunbright chain of merry ringing days and sleepful nights, yet many a</page><page sequence="56">14 one of the golden links was soiled by the stain of early suffering and sorrow. Lightsome boyhood may have been a joyous time of every kind of growth with you ; swelling limbs, expanding affec¬ tions, aspiring hopes, and even ambitious thoughts: but you perhaps remember how you were brought down almost to corruption by the usurping tyranny of fever; or how your heart was like to break when you heard some experienced matron say that sister was too good to live long; or how your half knit frame was riven by the rightful accusation of having partly forged some problem, to which a glittering honour was attached; or how your poor boy's soul sickened within you when your own living sire, with his hand of love and voice of counsel, became a mere dead body, and was buried out of sight. Then came the glorious prime of youth, with its generous pulse and bounding step ; with its burning heart of tenderest love, and manly purposes of honour; its swift power of thought and plenteous treasury of overflowing utterance; and its deep and passionate love of truth, with that unquenchable thirst of glory which derives its principal significance from being the unconscious tending of the spirit towards an un¬ known glory, honour, and immortality in the life ever young which is to come. Had not it too its weary days of malady; temples aching with the toil of ambitious strife, the languor of sensuous indul¬ gence, or even the mad delirium of an altogether mismanaged life finding its feverous vent as best it could Was there no ruination of highbuilt hopes,</page><page sequence="57">mm 15 your young love dying, your friend falling away in the hour of need Had winged thought and flow¬ ing words no equivalent in the rashness of speech and action into which they continually hurried you Did that love of the universe, such as it seemed to your inexperienced eye, (material, immaterial, or both; one God made manifest, or a godless whirl;) and that love of glory, which was the polestar of your life's new voyage, did they never lead you wrong to your peril Or, if you have been better fated than the most of us, did they not inflict the penalties of ceaseless moil, and impose heavier cares than you were strong enough to bear with impunity Such has been your way to manhood : and what are you now ?—You have your more or less honour¬ able position in the world ; but does the world see your carking fears Your domestic joys perhaps; and your domestic griefs. Your manly conscious¬ ness of individuality, as the centre of your sphere of loving and admiring ones ; and the frequent sense of the ease with which some outward power, or combination of forces, (call my living God with His countless rays of instrumentality what you will,) may strip you of them all, and leave you alone. Your self, too, has altered now. In childhood you often did amiss, and often knew you did ; boyhood was full enough of errors, but vivacity wiped them out of memory; in youth tempestuous passion drove everything before it; but now it is different. You are too old to be easily cheated by the fair shows of vice ; you have become wiser at last, and</page><page sequence="58">16 bow before the public conscience if not your own ; your responsibilities are increased, and you feel the weight of them ; you have hard struggles now; in fine, the mystery of human life thickens and thickens about you, and you cannot always be at ease for the multitude of your thoughts. The mystery of human life! can I know anything about it? How came I hither? I see infants born every day, but never was an infant to my own con¬ sciousness. 1 found myself here, sometimes it feels like an eternity ago and sometimes like yesterday, fearing and hoping, loving and hating, thinking and in one pregnant word living ; but the beginning of my true self is clouded in the thickest darkness behind me, which, for all I know, may be immense in space, and infinite in duration. And where is my end to be Death is all I can see before me : say slow or quick consumption is to come with its remorseless harpies, gnawing down tissue after tissue; hot, grinding hectic, the first and the last in the greedy train; life must soon give way, and agonizing weak¬ ness follow; no strength then to relieve the bur¬ dened lungs ; the blood stagnates in the delicate brain ; filmy darkness and groping hands; insensi¬ bility ; convulsive struggle of breast and throat; one gasp ; and—death. If that be all, let me eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow I die, and there is neither use nor pleasure in knowing more about the giddy carnival in which I dance my drunken way from the cradle to the grave. But if birth, life,</page><page sequence="59">ir and death be only a part; whence have I been commissioned, and O whither am I bound What is this tumultuous universe of oppressive, farstretch- ing sensation, multitudinous consciousness, and con¬ science now gently wooing and anon tremendous in its power to torture, through which I hurry like a dubious angel struggling in a storm betwixt the perennial abodes of light and darkness May I trust my senses, and believe that sun and stars; earth, sea, and air ; my dwelling place, the wife of my bosom, and those little ones; my own seething brain, distracted ear, and broken voice are not unreal mockeries Do I really live, a Will here on an errand of some unspeakable moment to myself, or am I not an individual soul at all, but only a morbid function of some great Unseen, with nothing to do but rack myself with these unanswerable questionings as He lists Is God, and am I These two questions infold the whole of that Universal Fidianism which apprehends God, Spirit, and Matter by faith ; reveres all that is godlike ; is full of hope for all that is human; and is the very stock to imbud the altogether specific faith of our beloved Christianity upon. Can they BE KNOWN Yes, inquiring Brother! God is ; in one sense is alone; the one reality. In another sense, you too are a reality; all things are real, and known (2)</page><page sequence="60">18 aright only when known as such. My next dis¬ courses are to satisfy you, if I can, that all these, God, Spirit, Matter, and thereby true self-consciousness with its myriad capacities and faculties, are all alike to be apprehended only by Faith ; and, inasmuch as no man but believes at least one of them, to show by the mere array of the three facts themselves that it is inhuman, that is irrational, not to believe them all. They stand, in relation to you, on the same everlasting foundation, namely the generic faith of mankind. This fundamental proposition will be placed before you so as both to leave room for the addition of the doctrine of the specific faith of Christianity, and to display the necessity for such specific faith before you can do anything with what you know for peace here, and endless peace hereafter. After the very meekest reception of the great threefold faith of humanity, and prac¬ tice of that universal hope and love, which naturally grows out of such humanizing faith, ' one thing' else 'is needful:' and the second set of the sermons which you have bid me prepare will be wholly taken up with the generalities, and especially the analogies of that one thing. -*«©««*&gt;- All men believe at least one thing, we say, but it may be anything; matter the materialists, spirit the immaterialists, God the transcendental theists,</page><page sequence="61">19 self the egoists, and so on if there be more. There is thus nowhere to begin this work of analysis in answer to the question, What is true It is neces¬ sary to follow an artificial arrangement, and we begin with God. Objectively, however, this is genuine method, for Jehovah is the beginning and end of all to the believer. Our inquiries, then, for a few months are three: Is God ; what; and how known to be very God of very God Is spirit; what; how known to be Is matter; what; and how known These, as preparatory to the consideration of the one thing else that is needful, are the most momentous ques¬ tions which living men can ask at one another; and have been unhappily complicated by the roundabout devices of successive questioners. There was never any need for perplexity, the replies having been ready in the heart of man from the beginning ; but it shall have served its good end in the economy of Provi¬ dence. All righthearted men have known them in the unconscious way when left to themselves: and in very modern times the strong reaction of the all denying infidelity has raised up several prophetic men, especially in Germany, to proclaim them to the world with greater emphasis than was ever ne¬ cessary or possible before. Even France, where my Victorious days were spent in tutelage, has pro¬ duced Lamcnnais the synthetist, with his New Philosophy,* which at least professes to be grounded * Esquisse d'une Philosophic Nouvelle. b2</page><page sequence="62">20 on faith. So that I might briefly set our inquisition at rest by quoting the very words of some of them, with such modifications as I hold to be necessary. This would not do however, because the British pub¬ lic, even the literary and especially the scientific, are behind their continental neighbours in this advance : they never went so far in disbelief, having for the most part kept ' afraid of scepticism, though desti¬ tute of faith,' and are correspondingly slow to pen¬ dulate. Doubtless Thomas Brown was the first to take the right method with both the followers of Berkeley and the materialists; and our own Cole¬ ridge, Wordsworth, Carlyle, and whomsoever these may stand for, have been second to none in seeing through the unnatural demonstrations in which the conception, say of godhood, has been hidden in these days. But the latter have rather torn away those envelopes with the strong hand of power, than stripped them methodically off with the safe care of analysis ; and have, in that high act of theirs, either not been regarded even by their professed admirers, or given sore offence to some; their true disciples meanwhile rendering them continual incense of love and thanks, for having ministered between them and the universe. The consequence is that Butler and Paley, the twin stars of British and American rationalism, still dominate over the christianized and half christianized portion of the thinking commu¬ nity ; while the rest are yet either in the dim light</page><page sequence="63">21 of materialism, which is at least good and true so far as it reaches, or the false light of scientific theism, which is only idolatry of a better kind than fireworship and the like. It is to meet this threefold necessity that I wish to inculcate universal fidianism as an analyst, before going on to the theory of Christianity; not without the dear hope of finding that such analytical procedure, though the more tedious and technical, will also better prepare us for the advocacy and reception of Christianity itself, 'pure and undefiled.' Be it observed, however, that I am not to be blamed for such technical forms and expression of thought as may be employed, for it is they, the sceptics, the partial recusants, and the universal deniers, who have rendered them neces¬ sary ; as those, who are versant in the history of freethinking in modern Europe, will be aware. Blame me only for the tedium. Proceeding to open out the threefold propo¬ sition of the object of man's generic faith, let us first explain how the being of God is not to be known; and that in two discourses, containing an analytical exhibition of the true way of believing in the ineffable and incomprehensible Being in ques¬ tion, and ending with a short formal statement of that way ; the way of faith. Let us begin by sifting the far-famed argument of design, leaving the more philosophical schemes of scientific theism till an¬ other opportunity.</page><page sequence="64">22 That conception of divinity to which it is too common, in these days of superannuated rationalism in religion, to think that the cumulative evidence of design enables the mind to ascend is a scientific guess, or proposition assumed in order to render the mechanism of the world intelligible. Those who hold by it, or suppose they do, seek refuge from what would else appear an inextricable com¬ plexity of wonderful harmonies, and unintelligible adaptations in the play of multitudinous nature, in the supposition of an intelligent First Cause; a Designer like themselves in kind, but infinitely above them in degree, of faculty ; an Almighty Man. The exposition and inculcation of this argument has not been confined to the theists. On the contrary the best authors arc to be found among such as have devoted themselves to the honourable task of bring¬ ing science to the aid of revelation. The more is the pity, for, apart from a previous or simultaneous act of faith, the so called argument proves either nothing, or so infinitely less than the infinitude that is sought after, as to be, in comparison of truth, equal to nothing. Pity at least for the present interests of religion; for we cannot but believe that even this has tended and tends toward the consummation of that great good, which we all hope for, and love to think about. I wish to convince you that the illustrious argument of Palcy and the Bridgewater treatises is inconclusive ; that it is now fraught with danger to the success of that gospel of faith, which its promulgators profess their anxious readiness to</page><page sequence="65">23 defend ; and, lastly, that, though thus impotent and insidious in itself, yet after the reception of Jehovah by our common human faith, it gloriously illustrates his &lt; goodness, wisdom, and power.' This is our threefold topic. It is desirable first to state the argument in the form in which it has been urged by its advocates; and, for that purpose, it may be well to hold up a single instance of design before proceeding. I select one of the most exquisite in the whole com¬ pass of the sciences: the law of the mutual inter- diffusion of air and other bodies which resemble it in elasticity and lightness. Look down the steep of history, and you ob¬ serve that it is long till man knows the atmo¬ sphere he breathes to be a substance essentially like the sea and the earth : and little wonder ; it is so thin, pellucid and evanescent. The result of his earliest thoughts, as embodied in the young languages of the world, seems to imply a supposed analogy between the invisible air and the inscrutable spirit of God. The winds are aeolian powers passing through the airy and omnipresent fount of vitality; now driving in demoniac hurry athwart the scene, and now gently stirring like the breath of angels. Even they are divine or godlike, or come from nearer God; and are deemed an appropriate type of the Holy Spirit himself, long after the still air has been</page><page sequence="66">24 recognized as a genuine element. Thou canst not tell whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth : how Jesus sympathizes with the heavenborn beauty of nature, and speaks the soft clear language of her heart! Some four hundred years before the Christ, Aristotle discovers that the aerial form is as material as the liquid and the solid, and is substantiated in the varieties of the latter. He burns a chip of wood; observes that there arise flame or fire, and smoke or air, while moisture or water is deposited on the cool bodies around, and ashes or earth remains: the four ingredients of wood. This is the first methodical reflection on facts brought to light by disturbing the repose of natural form, and is thus the true salient point of the great and subtle science of chimistry.* Fire, air, earth, and water are still the factors of dry wood, as they may be called; only later examiners find that they too have their elements. After two thousand years, Cavendish of England discovers the elemental water of the Gre¬ cian observer to be composed of two simpler bodies still; and so on. The Stagyrite is correct however, so long as he keeps by his facts, but he submits to the dogma of Demetrius of Abelaea, that all kinds of * The theory which I have adopted of the origin of alchimy has determined me to follow Webster, and all the southern nations of Europe, in the orthography of this word. ' Chymistry' was an affectation of Greek learning and high Aristotelianism on the part of the German and British adepts. ' Chemistry' was a re¬ finement on the same by Bocrhaave.</page><page sequence="67">25 sensible form are alike in essence, concludes that the ingredients of his chip are the principles of all things, and is once and for ever at fault. This is the doc¬ trine of the four elements, which is to live so long, and even linger in the literature of a future Europe. The Greeks have no chimistry but this ; and it is enough to stifle further investigation, not to speak of the excessive tendency of their mind towards rapid and lofty generalization. We may yet climb to their 'highest heaven of invention,' and stand there, not upon beautiful clouds like them, but on the top of the 'everlasting hills' themselves, if we will only toil in faith. I speak of their whole philosophy. To return: Aristotle reigns many a century su¬ preme over a kingdom that is not his own ; and the schoolmen, who follow him, do not understand his method, and perplex instead of clearing up his sha¬ dowy views of nature. They think fire and air quite different from water and earth, and indue them with the anomalous qualities of levity and omnipresence Liquids rise in the pump when the piston is drawn up, and they explain the appearance by saying Nature abhors a vacuum At last, Galileo strikes out a truer conception of the physical character of the air, but it is the work of a disciple to elaborate and establish his conjecture. The habile Torricelli sees that the atmosphere is heavy in its degree ; shows that its pressure forces water up the pump from below; and proves that a one inch column of air, upwards from the surface of the earth, weighs fifteen pounds. Pascal modifies his experiments, and confirms his</page><page sequence="68">26 results. Then Boyle in Ireland, and Mariotte in France, observe that air is clastic like caoutchouc; and that according to a calculable law. In the mean time the crusades bring the cabalistic lore of the Arabian physicians to the west, and its union in the minds of the practical with the Aristotelian physics produces a new school of inquirers, destined to be memorable in the histoiy of the earth. The alchimists at once separate from the mathematical physicists, pursue another line of research, work out the experimental result of their common master, and sooner emanci¬ pate themselves from his thraldom altogether. Raymond Lully begins to speculate about a fifth element, the quintessence, or predestined form; and Paracelsus gives the vague conception that practical turn, which is to end in the extraction of the active principles of compound medicines, by the chimists of the nineteenth century. Basil Valentine adopts sulphur, salt, and mercury as simple princi¬ ples from Geber and the eastern polypharmists, but homologates them with three of the old ones : brim¬ stone is a concrete fire, salt another earth, and quicksilver a form of water, for specific qualities were never attached to the mystical quaternion. The distinction, however, gradually becomes greater than the analogy; and there begins to be seven elements in spite of the schoolmen. At last the academies for the division of scientific labour are founded, Homberg teaches the adepts to publish their results without receive, and early in the</page><page sequence="69">27 seventeenth century Nicholas le Fevre decomposes wood in a new way. He burns it in a close vessel, collects the oil and spirit which distil, consumes the charwood in the air, and infers that there are six elements at the very least ; fire, air, earth, and water, with the spirit and oil. How much depends on this experiment! The yoke is broken off, and they begin analyzing and analyzing everything, tor¬ turing everything, and believing nothing till they see it. The current is changed; there are at least nine elements now ; nay, everything is equally elementary for all they can see ; and all is confusion. On they hurry, many of them still pursuing a high ideal by a way that cannot lead to it, the best of them seeking nothing but attainable truth, and all of them hunting out new forms of protean matter. At length, by the influence of the positive philosophy of Descartes and Bacon, they are completely delivered from their great misunderstanding, and all they wish is to know the composition of whatever is within their reach, and discover the general rules whereby everything has been made. Becher and Stahl think for the rest. Physicists and alchimists are now at one. Boyle is satisfied that some solid bodies in certain cir¬ cumstances, throw off artificial airs, resembling the common atmosphere in elasticity and attenua¬ tion, but differing from it he cannot tell how. German miners are harassed by suffocations of chokedamp, and explosions of firedamp : Van Helmont cannot make out the nature of the destroy- mmmm</page><page sequence="70">28 ing angels, and calls them gases ; ghosts ; invisible genii of evil. Young Black of Edinburgh ponders over an old wonder at the feet of Cullen, discovers that limestone, when burnt in the kilns, gives away a kind of air which cannot be breathed, and names it ' fixed air,' as if it were imprisoned in the rock, and the furnace set it free. The restless Priestley invents a simple way of gathering and handling aerial bodies, and finds out nine kinds of gas in a few busy years. Scheele, too, has been conquering in Sweden with his phials and bladders, and added two or three more to the number. All Europe follows these skilful leaders; Rutherford, Caven¬ dish, Lavoisier, Davy, and the host; until every¬ body knows that there are as many forms of air, as of water and earth. To crown all, Doctor Faraday, with Thilorier of Paris as his assistant, is now proving that the gases may be changed by cold and pressure into liquids, and these liquids into solid ices. You have seen the bubbles, which sparkle in the creaming champagne and flit away, fall from the potent hand of the experimenter in flakes of frostbound snow. Heat a solid metal, and it shall swell out and out, till it fall down liquid: heat the molten substance higher if you can, and it shall be resolved away into thin air. Gases, liquids, and solids are all the same, and the terms only relative. Air is not the spirit of life, but a physical reality ; and life is a far other thing than air. How full of inference is the history of these two simple truths in the world, if design be big with proof!</page><page sequence="71">29 Let us now address ourselves to the special question to which this glimpse is meant to be introductory. What shall take place when two or more kinds of air shall have been brought together Shall the heavier subside, and the lighter ascend, like oil floating on water? The analogy of gases to liquids in this respect was tacitly assumed a good many years, but the infer¬ ence was false, for the matter is reversed in the instance of aerial substances. It was Dalton who saw, from the vantage ground of his great atomic theory, that it is otherwise ; and, with the inexorable practicality of a true chimist, he put his speculative conclusion to the test of successful trial. A vessel filled half with hydrogen, the lightest of airs, and half with carbonic acid, one of the heaviest, shall not be per¬ manently occupied above by the lighter, and below by the heavier form, but shall very soon contain both carbonic acid and hydrogen in every apprecia¬ ble point of its capacity. Moreover, such mutual infusion shall proceed through long tubes of small bore, and even through the pores of stucco and membrane. Suppose there were a jar of fixed air in one chamber, a second of the same size full of inflammable gas in another, and the two connected by a long enough thermometer tube ; the latter should insinuate itself away through into the vessel originally containing only fixed air, and the reverse, till there should at length be an equable mixture of the two in both. Two kinds of air cannot be in contact without melting away into each other, at a rate proportioned to ktheir own densities, and the</page><page sequence="72">30 extent of surface at which they touch. Each of us is continually inhaling the sustaining principle of the air, and expiring the poisonous carbonic acid; but, while we are breathing in security, the fixed air which we discharge silently soaks away by every crevice, and for each proportion that is thus imbibed by the body of the atmosphere without, a ratio of pure air finds its noiseless way within! The city defiles the breath of heaven by the natural functions of its teeming population, sets corruption free from the churming sewers of all its common filth, despoils the air by every fire and furnace within its compass, and breathes out the deadliest vapours from a thou¬ sand factories. Well, it is in virtue of the same slow but ceaseless interchange, that it is not speedily en¬ veloped and stifled by its own noxious exhalations The whole atmosphere is made up of three simpler kinds of air, nitrogen, which is harmless at the worst, oxygen, which is indispensable to life, and carbonic acid, which is rank poison, unless it be very diluted; and the last is the heaviest: so that, but for this perfect mechanism of the aerial form, which makes them dissolve each other irresistibly, like snow upon the waters, the face of this beauteous globe had been still swathed in the robes of unend¬ ing sleep: and Time had never awaked! The odour of springing flowers, and the stench of decay; the wholesome expirations of the grove, and the sul¬ phureous belching of the volcano ; the balmy zephyrs of the Spicy isles, and the noisome breath of the 5</page><page sequence="73">31 Pontine marsh, flow quietly out into the charitable atmosphere, and all baleful emanations are so diluted as to become for ever innocent, while every pleasant influence is shed abroad to sweeten the air, and swell the common good Then what an effect this diffusion is! There is no limit to the extensive expansion of a single inch of any gas which may be formed or liberated in the air; but a part of what is here today may be the other side the world tomorrow. This is no vulgar exaggeration: for if no chimical attraction of sea or land arrest its flight, such is indeed its destiny. Consider it a little; and trace a lowly incident which happens every summer day. A bubble rises from the bottom of a solitary pool, basking in the sun among the hills: clothed about with a slender film of rainbow hue, the bonny bell floats like a thing of light over the mantling ripple of its little sea, till the tiny craft is broken on the flowerbud of a waterlily; and away fly its crew of dancing atoms hither, thither, and everywhither A timid breath at first, a transient touch ; How soon it swells from little into much What a wondrous combination of means and ends; how remote the instrumentality employed from the effects produced; and how worthy of a God! Suppose, then, a million instances like this; recall to mind the curious cases you have read in Paley and the Bridgewaters; find many more in the records</page><page sequence="74">32 of science, for every page is full of them ; search out the undiscovered multitudes of similar examples in the open book of nature, which is a written strain of the loftiest music from beginning to end: and you have the data which the natural theologians endeavour to generalize. The survey of these crowding facts, like that of every other class of observations, suggests the inexhaustible inquiry of research, How are they to be understood? What is their meaning Where is the theory The method of inquisition is the same here as elsewhere: Is there any similar class of facts of which we know the explanation Yes there is one. In the works of human art, the mechanism of a watch, the con¬ struction of a steam engine; in every product of art, there are adaptations of one result to another completely resembling those which are found in the world which art attempts to imitate and control. In truth all art consists in the institution of such mutual relations, and such production of effects by fitly chosen means. Now the explanation of this set of facts is ready beforehand — Art is the product of a designing mind, and the designer is man. Accord¬ ingly the substance of the Paleyan argument is this : The facts of adaptation discovered in nature are radically like the facts of adaptation instituted in art, and the inference is that they resemble them in origin as well as resulting character — Nature is the product of a designing mind, and the designer is God. This is the argument of design, and it is</page><page sequence="75">33 essentially cumulative in its power, for the greater the number, and more striking the kind, of evidences of design that can be gathered around it, the stronger does it appear to become. I have some strictures to make upon it, with the sincere hope of convincing you that, without a previous or simulta¬ neous act of faith or intuitive belief, conscious or unconscious, it is wholly inadequate to the purposes for which it was constructed. The first is this. If there be any genuine analogy between man, the designer of the works of art, and the inferred designer of the works of nature, it must be complete and extensible in the inference to all the essential characteristics of the known de¬ signer, man. How, then, does man design By reducing discovered truth to his own uses, and making combinations of natural forms and qualities : He knows the expansive force of steam, as well as the law of latent heat, and makes a steam engine: He creates nothing. So that the Deity, inferred from evidences of design, does, for all that the argument of analogy makes out, discover truth, apply it to his own uses, and make combinations of forms and qualities: He knows the repulsive force of matter, as well as the law of gravitation, and makes a solar system : He creates nothing. This is Hume's analysis, though otherwise expressed, and very differently intentioned; and its force is irre¬ sistible. Hume is the best analyst, as a mere analyst, that Britain has been able to produce. A sincere (2)</page><page sequence="76">34 and not uncharitable man, he detested the plausible, and never rested till he stripped it bare, and hooted it out of his presence. If he had believed in God by faith, I had only need have reiterated his voice : as it is, you see how searching and indisputable his analysis is, so far as it extends. All that the boasted argument a posteriori, as it is called, for the existence of a God even tends to esta¬ blish is the existence of a designer, not that that de¬ signer is the Supreme, whom science 'falsely so called' is thus ambitious of demonstrating like any other theorem. I find a watch on a solitary moor, ex¬ amine its parts and their relationships, and infer a designer ; but I go farther : I know that watch¬ makers construct similar combinations of mechani¬ cal power, and infer a watchmaker. Again, I am born into a world, full of peerless contrivance and stupendous mechanism ; I discover that it is only a little part of the system of the glorious sun, and that, in its turn, of the vast looming firmament in which it burns a bright point, which again is only one complicated particle in an indefinite universe of firmaments on firmaments, growing ever on and on athwart the bournless abysm of immensity throughout the year of erernity ; and, finding power and goodness everywhere, only goodness and power, I may infer a designer, if that will satisfy my heart; but I can¬ not take another step: I never beheld or heard of a universe maker, and I dare not infer God. I might, indeed, surmise that this designer may in reality be</page><page sequence="77">35 that Jehovah, who is represented in the Bible of the Hebrews, even in the Koran of Mahomet, and abovp all in 'the Gospel of Christ, as the Creator and Pre¬ server of all things, Himself being the only absolute and underived Being : but that is all, and it is not discovery ; it is not proof: it is only one conjecture based upon another. Once more : grant the natural theologian leave to pass from the conception of a mere maker to that of a true Creator. The creative attribute is not human, indeed, but is it therefore divine? Brutes are incapable of reason ; it is man's prero" gative, but man is not therefore divine in relation to the irrational creation. So that, for all that design can prove, in combination even with the granted conception of creative power, there may be more creators than one. But allow that the inferred designer really spoke the worlds into existence, and He alone. Still that creative designer may not be God after all, for Divinity, if proved at all, must be proved to be almighty in power, inexhaustible in wisdom, and boundless in love; but the universe cannot be proved to be anywise infinite in the literal sense of infinitude; it is only indefinitely vast, its magnitude compared with true immensity being a trifle for all our telescopes can disclose, and the attributes of its inferred creator may be less than infinite in kind and degree. Whatever is less than infinitude is infinitely less; and whatever is infinitely less than anything is nothing. This is not God.</page><page sequence="78">mmmmt 36 Are evidences of goodness, wisdom, and power of no worth then, and manifestations only an un¬ meaning pageantry Is it to no purpose that we see ' all things with each other blending ?* All on each in turn depending : Heavenly ministers descending : And again to Heaven uptending ; Floating, mingling, interweaving; Rising, sinking, and receiving Each from each, while each is giving On to each, and each relieving Each, the pails of gold, the living Current through the air is heaving: Breathing blessings, see them bending, Balanced worlds from change defending, While everywhere diffused is harmony xxnending.* Has this mazy universe of melody no signifi¬ cance beyond its own unfathomable beauty Heaven forbid! Once know God otherwise than by dis¬ covery ; once believe his Being upon the same foundation as you believe the existence of the world without, your own personality, and the truth of self- evident propositions, all of which are incapable alike of proof and refutation. Once apprehend Him as the Incomprehensible One, ' in whom you live, move, and have your being ;' and then the world, and all the worlds, are the sublimest com¬ mentary and illustration of his transcending attri¬ butes, being in truth his uttered word, still vibrating • The Faust ; translated by Doctor Anster.</page><page sequence="79">37 under the concave of immensity ; and the science of final causes becomes the noblest of man's ter¬ restrial'pursuits. This is the method of the Book of Job, and the Psalms of David, in both of which the Divine Majesty is tacitly understood as being of course the Jehovah, or one independent reality, and his attributes are only illumminated by the contempla¬ tion of his handiworks. Praise ye the Lord from the heavens. Praise ye Him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light. Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters above the heavens. Let them praise the name of the Lord : for he commanded, and they were created. Cicero followed the same rational plan in his treatise on the Nature of the Gods, only he veiled the concep¬ tion of the one living and true God under the popular form of his time and country, which represented Divi¬ nity as multiform. To come down at once to our own time, so did Ray and Derham in some degree. In reality, this is the history of every man's process of thought, with whom the argument a posteriori has seemed to himself to have been potential. Not the 'argument of design, but the argument of design together with unconscious faith in Godhood, has taught men in all ages to behold the Creator' in his works. In fine the same must be said of the natu¬ ral theologians themselves. They have failed to analyze their own process of conviction for one thing; they have been unable to see through their</page><page sequence="80">38 false argument, considered as a mere analytical argu¬ ment, for another ; and then they have always taken the existence of the world without for granted, while they have tried to prove the Being of God forsooth, although the two propositions are alike insusceptible both of faithless demonstration and sincere denial. The first writer of note, who stated the argument of design as a formal proof was the Dutch Mathe¬ matician Nieuentytt, in whose Religious Philoso¬ pher is to be found the original of that classical analogy of a watch, which was afterwards expounded by Howe, and then illustrated and enforced with so much perspicacity and elegance by Doctor Paley. The last was the first to urge it with such effect as to .secure it a standing in the world. His Natural Theology is read by everybody, and is a text book at the Universities. It has gone through many editions, even a cheap one for the people, and is a standard work. It has been lately presented anew under the united auspices of Lord Brougham and Sir Charles Bell. Lastly, the late Earl of Bridgewater has bequeathed the world eight well paid treatises, all emulous of demonstrating him, ' who is past finding out.' I would not drive counter to such high authorities, if I were not convinced that the cause of Christianity has suffered from these attempts to afford it external aid. Their direct tendency is to rob the religion of faith of its essential character: and this of ' design ' encou¬ rages those who reject our most holy faith in the</page><page sequence="81">39 implied conclusion that either God must be to be found in nature by research, or not exist at all. Hence come insincere atheism, idolatrous scientific theism, and worthless half belief in God. These are my motives and defence. In conclusion : It may strike you that all this is at variance with the strain of invective pursued by Saint Paul in his letter to the young Roman church. ' For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man.' Here, however, the Apostle blames the insincere idolators with pity, not for disbelieving in the Being of God, but for not glorifying him aright, know Him though they did, and for ' holding the truth in unrighteousness.' Our common faith in conscience told them that God was, else why were they idolators Analysis would have told them much about his ' eternal power and Godhead ' if they had only looked from the immovable rock of their faith with the eye of common sense upon the ' things that are made.' Faith and analysis have to work together on this momentous theme as on every other; the former to give assurance of divinity; and the latter to show what Godhead cannot be, and even, in some little</page><page sequence="82">40 degree, what Jehovah must at least be. All idola¬ try, from the rudest worship of impersonated physi¬ cal powers among our Saxon forefathers to the christianized anthropomorphism (or way of thinking about Deity as a mere somewhat infinite human being,) and the scientific theism of the present day, is the product of a lifeless faith in Godhood, and an inadequate analysis of his works. This is what is inveighed against by the fidian analyst, Saint Paul. Nay so far from being inconsistent with the Scrip¬ ture, the sole aim of this sermon is to inculcate the inspired declaration of the gifted apostle to the nations, that it is through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by God. David Hume is right, but so is Saint Paul: and the pauline, or rather the divine, truth is incalculably the greater, containing the other together with as much more as the way of God transcends the thought of man. That truth we have glanced at already, and will study some future day. Suffice it, at present, that if you blame me for having laboured to destroy an illusion you may have fondly cherished, I can only plead that I have always looked upon the face of universal nature with a lover's eye, but never gazed with half so true emotion, until I learned to look in faith. That the worlds were framed by God is a sur¬ passing mystery.

Or are they, in some billion of cycles, say thousands of years, perhaps a few short centuries, or another month from today, or even one fleeting hour from this last look upon their solemn splendour; are they to pass away at the silent and unutterable hest of the eternal King of Glory? And the King of Glory who is this?—Ah! they have toyed too lightly with the Creative Attribute, who have thought to climb up to its awful sanctuary, where it dwelleth evermore in the omnific word of Godhood, by piling stone upon stone in endless erection of a faithless science of final causation and a Great first Cause. Why, Jehovah is not the infinite source but the source of the infinite source, not the first cause but the cause of the first cause of all things; and even that in an altogether metaphori¬ cal mode. In fine, raised up on a basis of un¬ conscious scepticism, this kind of natural theology (2) D</page><page sequence="84">42 !M V is a seemly superstructure ; but it hangs on the air, wavers uncertainly in every wind of doctrine, and is ready to vanish at the first sound of a bolder infidelity, leaving no trace behind. But the same phantasmagorial temple of design, with its magnificent proportions, shapely co¬ lumns, rare devices, and choicest orna¬ ments, becomes a grand reality the in¬ stant that man, as its anointed priest, proclaims through the resounding aisles that faith, only faith, is the evidence of things UNSEEN. \i r«\</page></plain_text>
