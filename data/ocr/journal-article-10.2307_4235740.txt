<plain_text><page sequence="1">164 Peacemaking among Primates Frans de Waal Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1989 Pr?cis. Intended for the general reader, this volume is the result of a research orientation which began in 1975 when de Waal first observed and understood the impli- cations of a reconciliation between two chimpanzees who had previously been involved in a fight. In this book, de Waal looks at five primate groups, chimpan- zees, rhesus monkeys, stump-tailed monkeys, bonobos and humans. He is concerned with the fact that conflict is inevitable among primates and also with the ways in which these social animals mitigate the effects of con- flict through what he calls "the natural mechanisms of conflict resolution" (p. 5). De Waal's primary goal is "to correct biology's bleak orientation on the human condi- tion" introducing "the accumulated evidence that, for humans, making peace is as natural as making war" (p. 7). The book contains six chapters. The first chapter con- tains an extended discussion of what de Waal calls "three unrelated dichotomies [which] have dominated research on aggression" (p. 9): (1) the categorization of behaviors as desirable and undesirable; (2) a biological emphasis on the individual "at the expense of the social group" (p. 9); and (3) "the distinction between studies on animals in their natural habitat and on those in captivity" (p. 9). He challenges these as "false dichoto- mies" and emphasizes the "complementarity of differ- ent concepts and approaches" (p. 9). The subsequent five chapters are each devoted to one of the primate groups listed above, the final one being humans. De Waal concludes that reconciliation techniques evolved along with aggressive behavior, and that both humans and other primates have developed great skill in peace- making. Thus, "reconciliation behavior must be seen as a shared heritage of the primate order" (p. 270). This does not solve the problem of social violence, but it does imply a change in perspective. De Waal expresses the hope that this realization will lead to a more rational approach to the issue of peace. -Carol Barner-Barry Monkeys to the Rescue of Mankind Richard W. Byrne Scottish Primate Research Group Psychological Laboratory University of St Andrews St Andrews FifeKY16 9JU UNITED KINGDOM Ethology has often had bad press in the social sciences. Those who popularized ethological ideas (whether they were themselves ethologists like Konrad Lorenz, or were just applying the subject's findings like Robert Ardrey) strongly emphasised the genetically- driven nature of ani- mal behavior. Instincts were the heart of it, and the human instinct for aggression was the root of many of society's evils. More recently, some sociobiologists have become even more unpopular with social scientists by suggesting that most of the data of social psychology, sociology, and social anthropology can be better understood within the framework of kin selection. Even human culture is a result of our having a complement of genes which tend to repli- cate themselves into the next generation, or (equivalently) our having been selected to favor ourselves first and our kin (devalued by their degree and certainty of relatedness to ourselves) second. The first to incorporate humans into a major sociobiological framework, E. O. Wilson, is an expert on social insects whose dramatically complex socie- ties are certainly a result of their genetic makeup. Lorenz, and the other founders of ethology, also worked mainly on animals rather distantly related to humans, such as birds, fish, or insects. Many ethologists now believe that, while there is a level at which termites and humans can be treated in the same way, to draw direct parallels between human behavior and the social behavior of animals separated from us by hundreds of millions of years of evolution is often unwise, and that ethology's bad press in social science was deserved. De Waal is aim ing to "correct biology's bleak orientation on the human condition." (p.7) If the problem has indeed been the generalization from animals too distantly related to us, de Waal is in an ideal position to achieve his aims. His research career has focused on two species of monkey and two species of chimpanzee, animals that shared common ancestors with ourselves around 30 and 8 million years ago respectively, and detailed experience of both monkeys and apes is unusual even for a primatologist to have. De Waal's work with well-housed and composed captive groups of these animals has naturally emphasised social processes radier than the ultimate forces of natural selection, but this makes his results of greater, not less, interest to social scientists, since in studying modern human behavior we</page><page sequence="2">165 have a similar difficulty in seeing natural selection at work and tend to focus on proximate social mechanisms. De Waal wants to rehabilitate ethology, and he does it very well. I would like to see this book read by all social scientists, and my concern is that the title implies a much narrower canvas than is really the case. De Waal misses no opportunities of parallels with human behavior, and he does not flinch from drawing parallels which may offend some. He uses rhesus monkey behavior to help understand the delicate maneuvers between two women that lead to their eventual private rapprochement after a public row. He compares the public display of conciliation at the first visit made by a Pope to a synagogue, with behavior patterns typical of stump-tailed monkeys. He even uses the term "social class" to describe the patterning in his monkey groups. This is deliberate: rather than avoid so-called dangerous words, thereby leaving us with a depleted and meaningless vocabu- lary , biologists need to expose the error of simplistic political use of their findings. (126-127) Reading his lucid and fascinating accounts of the primate societies that he has studied, it would be hard to accuse de Waal of simplistic political interpretations. The lessons of powerful socio/political concern are drawn with care and consideration, and, although in this book he uses descrip- tion and anecdote rather than tables of data (these are available in published academic papers), the case he makes is a strong one. After studying the social lives of some of our closest relatives, he finds it impossible to view aggression as a destructive instinct that has become uncontrollable in humans. Rather, he sees aggression as a necessary and useful part of the repertoire of human behavior, checked and balanced by a range of tactics of reconciliation and compromise. This throws a very different light on the problems of violence in modern human society, and it deserves to be widely read and seriously considered. The descriptions de Waal presents are ethnographic, and animals are seen as parts of a complex mechanistic society. Generally this works well, although occasionally it seems to have resulted in missing an obvious sociobiological point. For instance, he does not link the striking differences in behavior between the sexes in adult chimpanzees, and perhaps also humans, to the very different degrees of relatedness within each sex in groups of wild chimpanzees. More disturbing to some biologists will be de Waal's open espousal of a cognitive stance towards his subjects. If an animal seems to want something, de Waal assumes that it does want it. Although an anathema to some behaviorists, this stance is bound to be both popular with and helpful to the lay reader. Most people find it very hard not to see purpose in apparently teleological sequences of behavior. It seems that we humans are adapted to find intention and motive in everything possible, even if that sometimes means that we are sure our PC hates us. Among behavioral scientists, this stance is controversial and rather unpopular. To see why, think about a machine like a windmill, that (thanks to a clever little extra wheel on the back) seems to want to face the wind. Should we allow a windmill pur- poses, or would it be better to try to account for all animal and human behavior as mechanistically driven, without using concepts like purpose? These questions may lead to fierce arguments between philosophers, behaviorists, and social psychologists, but simply taking a cognitive stance, as de Waal does, does not necessarily make a treatment any less scientific. Just because de Waal chooses to talk as if monkeys and apes have thoughts, it does not appear to make it any harder to put forward testable alternatives for what drives their behavior. Indeed in some cases it seems to make it rather easier. I suspect that many scientists who study animal behavior already take just such a cognitive stance to their subjects, as a sort of "secret calculus," with which to locate and sharpen hypotheses to test, but then they re- phrase the hypotheses without using mentalistic terms in their publications. It is therefore rather a refreshing change to see the approach adopted so openly. Instead of being a snare, it may well be that taking acognitive stance will even turn out to be useful in helping us to avoid the very real pitfall of anthropomorphism, that is, making implicit as- sumptions about animal minds based only upon external appearances and then not testing them objectively. Technically, the book is hard to fault. The writing style is superbly clear, the many photographs are all useful, and, while the book is undoubtedly a tour de force of de Waal's own work, when other researchers' ideas and data are mentioned they are treated scrupulously fairly. Peacemak- ing among Primates is a pleasure to read. Its message is an important one for anyone with a concern for humanity.</page></plain_text>
