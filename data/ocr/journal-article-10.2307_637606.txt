<plain_text><page sequence="1">THREE PRESOCRATIC COSMOLOGIES I. ALCMAN A PAPYRUS commentary on Alcman published in 1957' brings us news of a poem in which Alcman 'physiologized'. The lemmata and commentary to- gether witness to a semi-philosophical cosmogony unlike any other hitherto known from Greece. The evidence is meagre, but it seems worth while to see what can be made of it; for it is perhaps possible to go a little farther than has so far been done.2 The text of the third column of the papyrus (the second in Page's edition), where the cosmogony is discussed, begins to be intelligible at line 3: TCLS. EIK 8' 4)7[ KALWP EyEVETro -r[ In the next lines the commentator discusses the coming into being of rdpos and -dKtLwp, and the sense of the lemma, or the verse from which it is taken, must clearly have been 'and from him' (or 'after that') 'Poros and Tekmor were born' (or 'appeared'). 'After that' is the more likely translation, for it appears from lines 15-1 7, T99  oinsos yEoLE l pX Ka7 7Y [A]o[S J]a T,-W9 5y, EVE[7~]O, that Poros and Tekmor were preceded by a female deity. It is probable that ]-LS, in line 3 is to be supplemented OE]-t-S ('a long shot'-Lobel), whether it belongs to the lemma or to the commentary on the preceding lemma: the latter seems more probable. At the end of the comment on this lemma, in lines 20-21, we find the note 7rpday[vs] 8~ 8v'- to 70 prpEaflVr`s. The 8E shows that this is a further note on the same portion of text. The masculine grpdayvs cannot have referred to Thetis or Tekmor; it must have qualified Poros, and this agrees well with the mention in the Louvre Partheneion, fr. I. 13 ff., of Aisa and Poros as yEpaLrrdroL crv. We can now supplement line 3: EK 8% 7-r 7r[prCayvs HIdpos TEKLw'p 7rE' rE]Kpwp etc. We cannot tell whether Thetis was the first deity to appear, though the commentary certainly suggests that she was. She seems to play the part of a demiurge: ,ca'l - pd v rdTvra [cdJo]lav i XEa "7rv ay -r- -ro 0o xaAKo ,A,7KO 'i ~ % O'TrL 7[-] 70"r - TEXvIrov (lines 17-19). It looks as if this likening of Thetis to a bronze-worker was suggested by something in the poem: Alcman may for example have referred to her as XaAKEv7pLa rav-rwv, or in the invocation of the Muse he may have said 'sing how heaven and earth E'XcAKEVOEVO TO rp-rov' (cf. Homer's XaAKE0 o' pavds). The introduction of a female demiurge is best paralleled, perhaps, by Parmenides' 8al/wv 41q 7Tdva- KVUEpvc, (fr. 12. 3), identified as Aphrodite by Plutarch and as Dike-Ananke by Aetius, and Empedocles' Aphrodite (fr. 73, 75, 95, al.).3 The Nereid Thetis is the last goddess we should have expected to find fulfilling this role. Lloyd-Jones's suggestion (ap. Bowra) that it is attributed to her because of an association I Edited by E. Lobel in Oxyrhynchus Papyri, xxiv, no. 2390 fr. 2; now fr. 5 of Alcman in Page's Poetae Melici Graeci. 2 Cf. Lobel, ad loc.; Page, C.R. N.S. ix (I959), 20-21 ; Barrett, Gnomon xxxiii (1961), 689; Bowra, Greek Lyric Poetry, 2nd ed. (1961), pp. 25-26. A discussion has also been promised by W. Peek (Philologus civ [1960], I80). 3 In later literature compare Ananke in Simmias' Pteryges, Natura in Claud. de raptu Proserp. I. 248 (cf. Ov. M. I. 21).</page><page sequence="2">THREE PRESOCRATIC COSMOLOGIES 155 between her name and the verb G-rl0qtL is certainly right; but it can be taken further. The suffix --ts (gen. --L-oS) often denoted a female agent; *dE'It is the legitimate female equivalent of Ohrq-, and occurs as such in the compounds OEctoOGTLs, voLoOG'LS. Besides this there is another suffix -~-s, gen. --ros-, which gen- erally developed to -ats, and was used extensively for forming abstract nouns. This too occasionally has an agent-signification, as in olv-4pvacs 'ladle', and in the names of goddesses such as Lachesis, Nemesis, Bubrostis, Melobosis.' It is possible that in Alcman's dialect this suffix survived in the form --ts, just as 7- has resisted the change to ac in the verb forms E~VI-, qar-, etc. It is true that at fr. I. 36 the papyrus gives -r-ais, but here Alcman may have used a non-Laconian (literary) form for the sake of euphony, just as he used ad besides 7-E and -E- (fr. 70). We may say, therefore, that Alcman could certainly have interpreted the name Thetis as 'she who sets'; and that the association might have been suggested by the actual existence of a *O-E' (gen. * -OTos) for O'daU. Incidentally, he did not have to take her from poetic mythology. Thetis had a shrine at Sparta in Alcman's time: it was founded at the time of the second Messenian War by Laiandris, the wife of king Anaxander (Paus. 3- 14. 4). Poros and Tekmor seem to be quasi-allegorical figures. Poros' close conjunc- tion with Aisa in fr. I. 14 suggests that he represents 'provision' with the accessory idea of 'apportionment'. Why Alcman chose him is obscure; possibly Poros, like Thetis, was an etymologizing reinterpretation of an old (Laconian) god. Plato's reference to Poros as the father of Eros (Smp. 203 b) throws no light on the problem. The commentator identifies Poros as the JpXq which he assumed that any cosmological theory must disclose to analysis; he probably reasoned that -EdKLOp must be the -EAOS, as the word itself implied, and there was nothing else but Poros that could be the adpX'. It is because of this identifica- tion that the scholiast A on fr. I. 14 equates Poros with Hesiod's Chaos. These interpretations of Poros and Tekmor are of course to be disregarded. -rEKioWp is a form otherwise known only from epic for the more usual -E' iLap. The basic meaning of the word is 'boundary-mark'; hence it developed the two senses of 'boundary, end' and 'mark, sign'. Here it is apparently associated with Poros as a principle of differentiation. There is a remarkable parallel in a Vedic hymn, R. V. 10. 129. 2-3: Death was not then, nor was there aught immortal: no sign was there, the day's and night's divider.... Darkness there was: at first concealed in darkness this all was undiscriminated chaos.2 This concept of a 'sign' appears in a more familiar text too, Gen. i. 14: And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years. Similarly in the Babylonian creation poem Enuma Elis, 5. 12-13: The Moon he caused to shine, the night (to him) entrusting. He appointed him a creature of the night to signify the days.3 I On the development of abstracta from nomina agentis and other adjectival forma- tions cf. H. Usener, G6tternamen, pp. 364-75; P.

In the 32nd Homeric hymn, verse 13, we are told of the Moon reiK`Wp Uporo7 S Kat'i c 7ia TrTVKTaL. Cf. also A. P. V. 454-8; A.R. I. 496-500. Now Alcman's Tekmor is neither a concrete and visible sign such as the Moon, nor a criterion available to men. It is a hypostasis from these things, it exists independently of them; and if we wish to classify it, we shall have to say that it represents a principle or a potentiality rather than a specific event. The next lemma is Kat 7rp'ros UKdOTos.I The commentator explains that there was darkness because neither sun nor moon had yet come into being, matter being still undifferentiated. Then there is another lemma: a&amp;Iap 7Er Kat aUEAcva Ka 7prov aKdO70 (Q's add. Page) 7as (read voil) pap/,apvyas. The commentator, taking azap to include the sun, says again that to begin with there was only darkness, and afterwards, as it separated out, [there appeared light.] (The end of the sentence has to be supplemented, but the sense is certain). The phrase 'and with them Darkness' is obviously to be excised in one of the two places where it is written. Lobel 'can offer no cogent argument for preferring it in the one rather than the other'. Barrett and Page think it belongs with the Day and Moon, and has been wrongly transferred to the company of Poros and Tekmor. I can see nothing in favour of this view. Firstly it contradicts the commentary, which consistently presupposes that the darkness preceded Day and Moon, and explicitly says in lines 24-25 'yEvovro oYv 7T rTawr~d rodpos Kal IrKoLWP Kat UKdO70. Secondly it goes against the usual priority of darkness over light in early Greek cosmogonies (cf. Kirk-Raven, Presocratic Philosophers, pp. 19-24). Thirdly the text is in any case corrupt in the &amp;aup TE Ka' ahEAava lemma, and it is economical to regard the interpolation as part of the same corruption. Kal 7rp7ro UKdO70 certainly belongs with the earlier pair Poros and Tekmor. In the text of the poem it may have followed directly upon the preceding lemma: &amp;K U r rTP&amp;TayvS HodpoS TEIKIpwp -E Kati 7p'70o UCK 70o. What Darkness has to do with Poros, I cannot say. But its association with Tekmor has an obvious cosmogonical significance. The very coexistence of the two, or rather the action of the principle Tekmor upon the object Skotos, leads at once to the appearance of the luminaries of heaven. That these are actually named in the next lemma is a welcome confirmation of our inter- pretation of Tekmor. Professor Lloyd-Jones suggests that fr. 20, copas 3' EorUKE 7pEL, 60pOSI Kal XE?ua K6Trropav 7rp&amp;av etc., may have come from the same poem. The metre of the fragment, iambic dimeters Ka7r aurXov, is similar to that suggested by some of our lemmata. If this conjecture is right, dacp 7E Kal uEAcava is a catalectic line. The occurrence of the word paplpapvyds or -gis is a difficulty, but we might assume that Alcman scanned it ?,apLapigyas (cf. apapvly), or even that it is a corruption of, e.g., Kaipapvyag. In the initial words of the poem, col. ii (i) 22 f. [oC M]o'a loroop at 7T[... ]wv , ALto7a, Lobel's suggested supplement 7ravTr5v would have to be discarded in favour of an iambic word; for example, Barrett's Alotal -r[E might be continued with a ]r.v (monosyllabic, cf. fr. 56. 2).2 J.

PHERECYDES Some nine square inches of Pherecydes' fascinating cosmic history were delivered up by the illimitable sands of Egypt nearly seventy years ago; and unless they should achieve a second such parturition, it is unlikely that opinions about the basic outlines of its contents will be radically revised.' But many of its details remain puzzling and unsatisfactory, and it is in the hope of making some of them less so, and of setting the whole structure on a firmer basis, that I offer the following discussion. First the title of Pherecydes' book. This is given in the Suda notice of Pherecydes as follows: " JrLvxos 77ro&amp; OEoKpaora 3 1Eoyovia. Ev7L - U EohoyI'a EV fltfAlo' C Exovua OEW V yE'VETLV Kai ataaoXa-g (-ovU codd., corr. Preller). The general interpretation of this is that there are three alternative titles: Hepta- mychos, Theokrasia, and Theogonia. But nJ-dTLvxos- is an adjective in form, and as a book-title we expect a noun. More probably there are two alternatives, TTdcrdt[VXSZ2 OEOKpaclka and E-dktvxoS OEotovla.3 The following OEoAoyla is merely descriptive; the further addition Xovara OEWOv YEVELV Ka' 8aSoXxCs- suggests that &amp;EoKpaata meant or was taken to mean not 'mixing of the gods' but 'reigns of the gods', with -Kpaala equivalent to -KpaTrla as in dKpaata, dXhoKparaa, XELpoKpaala etc. But these titles are certainly Alexandrian inven- tions; Pherecydes will have been content to sign his name at the beginning of the work, e.g. EPEKU8139~ iSptOLo 7C-8E AEE~ BcUvoS Uv~d.4 It is generally agreed that the Suda's statement on the length of the work is erroneously taken over from a notice concerning the Athenian Pherecydes; and it is generally assumed that it actually occupied only one volume. This is quite likely to be correct, though it should be observed that the expression of Diogenes Laertius I. I19 a ' 3- atUoi , vptov -d TE ~flMov 3 Uvvyp' aEv, o' 4q aPXq etc. does not necessarily imply a single volume. When Callimachus said /dya ftflAlov d'kya KaKdv, he must have been thinking of works occupying many volumes (pace Birt), and Livius Andronicus' translation of the Odyssey could be referred to as a liber.s Mc6]aa. C seems not to be used in invocations of the Muse in the early period. The most sensible account is that by G. S. Kirk in Kirk-Raven, Presocratic Philo- sophers, pp. 48-72. 2 The 'seven nooks' of the Suda title are notoriously discrepant from the five nooks in which, in Pherecydes' cosmogony, Chronos' seed was distributed so as to pro- duce the 'five-nook generation of gods' (Damasc. Pr. 124 b = Diels-Kranz 7 A 8). I find it hard to believe that these five nooks were somehow augmented by two further nooks in a separate category, and the most reasonable course is surely to alter l7rd'vLUXOS to 7TEvr'lvQxoS with Preller (Rh. Mus. iv [1846], 378), or better to 7TEvrda1LvXos (see below). 3 e-rdj4wvos seems to have been taken in the way I advocate by Wilamowitz, KI. Schr. v (2), p. 129, since he prints it with a small initial and OEoKpaa'a and O9oyovIa with capitals. 4 Cf. Alcmaion of Croton fr. I. As the name of Pherecydes' father was known and not disputed in antiquity, he probably named him, as do Alcmaion and Antiochus in their sphragides. Hecataeus, Herodotus, and Thucydides only give their city. Against the assumption that Pherecydes began with a sphragis of this kind is the fact that Dio- genes Laertius, obviously following a library catalogue, quotes fr. I as the beginning of the work. But it may be that the sphragis was ignored in the pinax entry; to include it might have led to confusion where there were two works by the same author. There is reason to think that this has been done in the case of the Triagmoi of Ion of Chios, of which Harpocration cites from a catalogue pX1 3dE /ot 70ro A'dyov 7Tdra 7pla etc. It is probably the same with fr. I of Heraclitus, which Aristotle and Sextus mention as the beginning of his book, though they are not following a catalogue. s Gell. i8. 9. 5; T.

Zas and Chronos have something in common with the traditional Zeus and Kronos, but the new forms of the names suggest that the gods themselves represent something partly new and untraditional. In the same way, Chthonie is related to Earth,2 but she is not Earth, not yet. We know that it is not yet, for the event is certainly connected with the wedding of Zas and Chthonie: and this is the subject of our papyrus fragment, where one of the lines is numbered 6oo. XOov7 8o 8vol a dyEvETro Q7I is an anticipation, designed to give us from the beginning more understanding of Chthonie's identity. Did Pherecydes go on to say that Zas and Chronos eventually became Zeus and Kronos? Probably not. Chthonie's change into Ge corresponds to the genesis of something that belongs to our present-day world, the familiar Earth. A change of Chronos into Kronos would be the reverse: the universal and eternal god Time reduced to a figure of mythology who plays no part in the world's affairs, but rules in the Isles of the Blest, or else sits huddled in misty Tartarus. Zas has nothing to lose or gain by becoming Zeus, and it is best to assume that he stays as he is in the absence of evidence to the contrary.3 The first stage in the cosmogony was probably Chronos' production of the 'five-nook generation'.4 This is at any rate suggested by Damasc.

The meaning of notijat E'K TOO YdVOU Uav-rof is correctly explained by Kirk, who aptly compares the creative masturbation of Atum-Re in an Egyptian cos- mogonic myth (A.N.E. T.2, p. 6, cf. p. 5) and the story of Typhon's birth as told by ZC B 783 (Kirk-Raven, pp. 57-58). As the motif is not very common, it may be worth mentioning another parallel from Greek mythology, the story of the birth of Orion. Zeus, Poseidon, and Hermes were hospitably entertained at Tanagra by Hyrieus, a son of Poseidon, and in return they offered him any- thing he wanted. Being childless, he asked for a son. So the gods emitted their semen into the hide of the ox on which they had feasted, and told Hyrieus to bury it in the earth for ten months; and at the end of that time Orion was born.s Two points may be noticed: firstly, the oxhide which serves as a womb corresponds to the [zvxot which receive Chronos' seed; and secondly, wesen (1882), pp. 482-4, and Kritik und Hermeneutik (Handb. d.

In cult the epithet is more often borne by Zeus and Demeter. Ge is called Chthonie by 'Musaeus' fr.

Roscher, iii. 1030.</page><page sequence="6">THREE PRESOCRATIC COSMOLOGIES 159 the discretion with which the story is told, rather than the frank gusto with which Re recalls his achievement in the Egyptian text, is likely to have been the characteristic tone of Pherecydes' narrative. He may have used some such expression as we have in Damascius. We are told that Chronos made fire, breath, and water from his seed; that these were divided among five nooks; and that more gods arose from them. As the reader may have observed, I assume that it was the seed which was distributed among the nooks, and that it was in the nooks that it became the different elements (cf. Kirk-Raven, p. 58). All the mythological parallels demand that the seed be sown in some definite place, received by some sort of womb, before anything grows from it: the births of Typhon and Orion; the birth of the Giants, Erinyes and Meliai from the blood of Uranos' genitals, and of Aphrodite from the genitals themselves (Hes. Th. 183-206) ; the parallel to this in the Hurrian-Hittite Kumarbi myth, where the god Tasmisu and the River Tigris are born after Kumarbi spits Anu's genitals out on to the earth; the birth of Erichthonios from the seed which Hephaestus shed upon the earth in his pursuit of Athena (Apollod. 3. 14. 6, with Frazer's note); the birth of the second Aphrodite from Zeus' seed, which fell in the sea (Orph. fr. 183). This is what Pherecydes' nooks are for. How and where he imagined them, it is impossible to say. Robert Eisler conjectured that Pherecydes represented this stage of his cosmogony in the form of a pentagram.I This is a bare possibility; but there need be no such mystical significance in the choice of the number five. Presumably there are five nooks because five gods (if gods they are) are to be born. The product of the seed is the important thing, the nooks are merely accessories, and it may be that Pherecydes gave no special thought to their arrangement. Damascius names only three products of Chronos' seed; no doubt the infor- mation is abridged or lacunose. Kirk believes that it is actually false, and based on later, perhaps Stoic, interpretation of the seed itself. This seems to me un- likely in itself, and also unnecessary. It is certainly not very probable that Pherecydes named the products as 7rrp, 7rvE jia, i owp and whatever the other two were (e.g. Y- and Jjp): this is a doxographer's simplification expressed in doxographer's terminology. Pherecydes will have dressed them up as gods, just as Empedocles does with his four elements, calling them Hephaestus, Hera, Zeus, Nestis, etc. That this was possible in the sixth century is shown by the fact that Theagenes of Rhegium, in the time of Cambyses, interpreted the Homeric gods in just this way, as physical allegories.2 Even in Homer 'Hephaestus' sometimes means simply 'fire', Scamander is at once a god and a river, Uranos and Gaia themselves are at once gods and physical entities; the principle was easily extended. The seed ofTime in five wombs develops into five different physical elements. This is an intelligible cosmogonical doctrine, and there is no reason why it should not be attributed to Pherecydes, provided that we can accommodate in our reconstruction of his history what is obviously the necessary sequel: the mixture of the elements into a composite whole. Fortunately this presents no difficulty. It exactly fits what we are told by Proclus in Tim. 32 c (fr. 3 Diels) : ' Weltenmantel und Himmelszelt (I91o) i. 322 ff. A considerable part of this book bears on the interpretation of Pherecydes; it contains vast learning, which is however often injudiciously used. His attempt to find psephological symbolisms in the words and names used by Pherecydes (pp. 334 ff.) has found no followers. 2 See ZB Y 67-</page><page sequence="7">16o M. L.

The demiurge Love is a familiar figure. He (Eros, Pothos) or she (Philotes, Aphrodite) plays an even more important part in the cosmologies ofParmenides and Empedocles; but even in Hesiod the position of Eros among the first group of created beings (Th. 120) implies a cosmological significance, and there is nothing especially sophisticated or advanced in the idea. We find it in the Phoenician cosmogony reported by Eudemus ap. Damasc. Pr. 125 ter, and that of Sanchuniathon ap. Eus. P.E. i. io. I (F.G.H. 790 F 2). We find it also in the Vedic cosmogony already mentioned in connexion with Alcman, vv. 3-4: All that existed then was void and formless: by the great power of warmth was born that Unit. Thereafter rose Desire (Kama) in the beginning, Desire, the primal seed and germ of spirit. The identification of this Eros with Zas gives the latter a demiurgic impor- tance that the Greek Zeus had never had. Now Lydus, De Mens. 4- 3, tells us that Zeus (sc. Zas) was 'HALos ahd'-T Ka- aJEpEKdV8Yv. A composite primeval Zas-Eros-Helios is a figure not unlike the Orphic Phanes, with whom Proclus, loc. cit., actually compares him. Phanes is a god of light, with shining golden wings (Orph. fr. 78, hymn. 6. 2). He is identified with Eros (frr. 83, 168.9), he is called Phaethon (fr. 73), and he becomes united with Zeus as a result of being swallowed by him (fr. 167); while Zeus is identified with Helios (fr. 47, 236, 239, hymn. 8. 13).I The identification of Zeus and the Sun is common from the Hellenistic period on (see A. B. Cook, Zeus i. 186 ff.). The earliest certain instance apart from Pherecydes is Orph. fr. 47 (iv-iii B.C.); but no better restoration than the obvious one has been suggested for I.G. xii (7). 87 (Amorgos, vi-v B.C.) ZEYZ HA[. . ]Z. For the identification of Sun and demiurge we may also compare the Egyptian Re with whom we have already had to compare Pherecydes' Chronos. It is clear that the activity of Zas-Eros belongs at this stage of the cosmogony: this is where it is most obviously needed (so K. von Fritz, R.-E. xix. 2031-2). Chronos produces the materials, and Zas brings them into order. The five elemental gods mate among themselves, and many new gods are born. By now, presumably, some sort of world exists. It is not the present-day world, which only comes into being after the wedding of Zas and Chthonie; there are no men in it, only a host of strange and unfamiliar gods; but they have a stage on which they can act out their destined history, where they can build houses and make war. We cannot be sure that the war of the gods was the next event to be recorded, but the hypothesis has analogy in its favour. In Hesiod the Titanomachy comes as soon as the Titan families are complete, and it is only after this and the battle with Typhoeus that Zeus undertakes the series of marriages which establish the present world order. Similarly in the Babylonian creation poem, the theomachy comes before the establishment of the present world order under the rule of Marduk. He actually creates heaven and earth from the body of the defeated Tiamat (En. El. 4- I35ff., A.N.E.T.2, p. 67). So the most likely I In frr. 236 and 239 Zeus-Helios is equated with Dionysus, and in fr. 237 Dionysus with Phanes.</page><page sequence="8">THREE PRESOCRATIC COSMOLOGIES 161 sequence of events in Pherecydes is first the theomachy, and afterwards the wedding of Zas and Chthonie. The analogy is not perfect, because Zas does not play the decisive part in the theomachy, as Zeus and Marduk do in the parallel histories; so far as we can tell, he took no part in it at all. But the order suggested is still the most likely. The battle was between forces led by Chronos and Ophioneus (Origen c. Cels. 6. 42). The name of Ophioneus, or Ophion as later authors usually call him, suggests a serpentiform creature. This is nowhere explicitly attested, but it is further indicated by Dionysius, Bassarica or Gigantias fr. 18 recto 9 Heitsch, ]ae " aLEv 'O0lowv,' and by the fact that Ophion's consort, according to A.R. I. 503 and others, was Eurynome, a goddess who was worshipped at Phigalia in the form of a mermaid.2 We do not know for sure that she came in Pherecydes; but Ophioneus seems to have had a wife, for Philo of Byblos (F.G.H. 790 F 4) says that Pherecydes told about Ophioneus and the Ophio- nidai. It must be judged likely that these Ophionidai were the force which opposed Chronos, and that they were of a monstrous nature like their father and putative mother. A battle between the gods and a band of monsters has no parallel in Greek mythology; Typhoeus is alone in his combat with Zeus. But in Enuma Elis' Marduk has to face not only Tiamat, the dragon of the deeps, but a host of monstrous beings created by her: the Viper, the Dragon, and the Sphinx, the Great-Lion, the Mad-Dog, and the Scorpion-Man, mighty Lion-Demons, the Dragon-Fly, the Centaur.3 Now the monsters who make up this fixed tradi- tional catalogue4 bear a remarkable resemblance to those which meet us singly in the exploits of Heracles, Perseus, and Bellerophon, but which appear in Hesiod's Theogony (306 ff.) as a united family, the progeny of Typhaon and Echidna: the fearful hounds Orthos and Cerberus, the Hydra, the Chimaera, the Sphinx, and the Nemean Lion. Typhaon and Echidna as a pair are curiously like Ophioneus and Eurynome. Three of the four, and perhaps Ophioneus too, are anthropomorphic above the waist and fish or snake below. So there is real point in Kirk's comparison (p. 68) of the Ophionidai with Typhaon's brood; but the Babylonian myth makes an indispensable connecting link.s As further parallels we may mention the Norse myth of Ragnar6k, when there will be war between the gods and the sons of Muspell, who include monsters such as the wolf Fenrir, the Mi6gar6-Serpent, etc., and the Iranian myth of the battle between Ormuzd and the followers of the serpent Ahriman, who include the poisonous snake, the scorpion, the frog, the lizard, and the demon of death Azi Dahaka.6 This division of words, which I have proposed in Gitt. Gel. Anz. 1963, 170, is preferable on purely metrical grounds to the usual division ]dELS aLev, besides being easier to supplement: Svaad'&amp; or t6r~pa i'. 2 Paus. 8. 41. 4. The locals for some reason regarded her as a form of Artemis. Cf. Wilamowitz, Glaube der Hellenen i. 221. 3 En. El. I. 140-2, 2. 27-29, 3. 31-33, 89-91. The translation 'Sphinx' is marked as uncertain by Speiser. In the case of the Viper, Dragon, Great-Lion, and Mad-Dog, a variant has the plural in one or other place where the list occurs. 4 Besides their several appearances in Enuma Elil, no extant text of which is earlier than 000ooo B.C., these monsters were depicted on door-panels of sanctuaries of Marduk and his consort Sarpanitu, accord- ing to an inscription of Agum II, who re- stored them in the fifteenth century B.C. (A. Heidel, The Babylonian Genesis, 2nd ed. [1951], p. 13). s It was first compared with Pherecydes by P. Jensen, Kosmologie der Babylonier (1890), PP. 303 f. 6 For a full account of the Norse myth see Axel Olrik, Ragnariik (1922).

We do not know who his parents were. Kirk's guess (p. 70) that they were Chronos and Chthonie is not implausible; Chronos is himself represented as a serpent in later mythology (Orph. fr. 54, cf. Critias fr. I8 Diels, Claud. Laud. Stil. 2. 424 ff., Myth. Vat. 3. I. i and 6; Kirk-Raven, p. 39); but Ophioneus need not have had a father at all. Once born, he presumably becomes very strong, and either threatens to become king in heaven (like Typhoeus in Hes. Th. 836 ff.) or actually does so for a period. Ophion is usually said to have been king before Kronos (A. R. I. 503 ff., Lyc. ii9I with sch., Nonn. D. 2. 573, 12. 44, sch. A. P.V. 988, sch. Ar. Nub. 247), and although this is not attested for Pherecydes, he is most likely to have been the source for the myth, and it would give some substance to the Suda's statement that his book contained OEov StaSoxds. There is a parallel in the Iranian myth mentioned above. At the beginning of time it was agreed between Ormuzd and Ahriman that the latter might remain in the world for nine thousand years. By the end of that time Iran had fallen completely into Ahriman's power. Ormuzd joined battle with him in order to save his country from ruin, and Ahriman fled into the depths of Hell. At all events, war is declared between the forces of Chronos and Ophioneus. It is conducted according to agreed rules: Origen, loc. cit., says irpoKA UELs 8E Kal c 4Aeas a.i3rc tev LTOpEt, uvvO4Kas -E a a'otS YlYvEuCaL, LIV o7oTEpOLt awrcov EtyS 3v'yvj 1 _kV7T&amp;TEoUCt, ror'rovS gV ELVaL VEVLK7lkEVOVg, ToS V E uav7a5 Kal vLKrlaav7ra, rotrov; XELt 7rV ovpavov. The reference to irpOKX4uELS suggests formal speeches such as we find in the account of Zas' wedding. There is something here of Hesiod's narrative style; compare the quaint formality of Zeus' exchanges with Kottos before battle is joined with the Titans (Th. 634 ff.) and with Prometheus at Mekone (542 ff.). The arrangement that whichever side falls into Ogenos shall be held the losers is very remarkable. One would suspect that it was a reflection of ritual, even if no similar ritual were actually recorded. In fact we do know of such a procedure: the battle of the epheboi at Sparta, described by Lucian, Anacharsis 38 and Paus. 3. 14. 8-io. The epheboi were divided into two parties. The night before the battle they sacrificed a puppy to Enyalios at the Ephebaion near Therapne, and drew lots. Accord- ing to the result of the lot, one party became the party of Heracles, the other that of Lycurgus. Then they made two boars fight, and the party whose boar was victorious generally won the contest on the following day. The battle took place at a place called Platanistas, which was entirely surrounded by a circular moat. Two bridges led on to it, one bearing the image of Heracles, the other of Lycurgus. Shortly before midday the epheboi entered Platanistas by the appropriate bridges, and a fierce free-for-all ensued; it continued until one party was pressed back into the moat. It is curious that what appears to be an early legend associates Pherecydes with Sparta (see E. N. Tigerstedt, Eranos li [1953], 8-13) ; and it is conceivable that he actually knew the custom described by Lucian and Pausanias, and based his theomachy on it, though of course it is quite possible that similar rituals existed elsewhere. Wherever he met it, he Succession Myth, and may be an actual off- shoot of it carried north by the Goths from the shores of the Black Sea. The Iranian myth is related in the Bundahish, translated by E. W. West in volume v of Sacred Books of the East, ed. F. Max Muiller, Oxford, 1879-1910.</page><page sequence="10">THREE PRESOCRATIC COSMOLOGIES 163 is not likely to have been the first to see in it the representation of a theo- machy: this will have been the official interpretation of the proceedings in his time. Ophioneus is pushed back into Ogenos, and the struggle is over. This corresponds to the pressing of the defeated party back into the moat at Sparta. But it must also have had some significance at the mythical level. The Titans play no part in the world's affairs, because they are bound in Tartarus: their defeat in the Titanomachy explains why they are there. Etna quakes and burns because Typhon is imprisoned under it: his defeat by Zeus explains how he came to be there. If Ophioneus and the Ophionidai were cast into the stream that girdles the earth, then that is where they are now. There are in fact traces of this view in later literature. In Myth. Vat. I. 204 Ophion is actually identified with Oceanus-at least by 'philosophers': Ophion et secundum philo- sophos Oceanus, qui et Nereus, de maiore Thetide genuit Caelum.

It is hardly coincidence that Eurynome is a daughter of Oceanus in Hesiod (Th. 358). There she becomes a wife of Zeus (907), which implies that she was a figure of some importance even then. Cf. IR. 18. 398, and Zenodotus' reading at Od. 4. 366. It would be easy to imagine, at the bed of a river that goes round in a circle and flows back into itsel Hymi. a serpent also going round in a circle and biting its own tail. Serpents and rivers are not infrequently compared with each other in poetic simile (e.g. Hes. fr. 38 Rz., Arat. 45, Virg. G. i.-245), and river-gods are represented in art as long, undulating 'sea-serpents' with human trunk and head. Here again non-Greek parallels force themselves upon our attention. Tiamat, although heaven and earth are made out of her carcass, is still the personification of the deeps; she is etymologically related to the tehom of Gen. 19. 25 and Deut. 33. 13. Leviathan, whose headsJahweh brake, is the serpent in the waters (Ps. 74. 13-14, Isa. 27. I).

The serpent in the waters also appears in central Asian cosmography; cf. U. Holmberg, 'Der Baum des Lebens' (Annales Acad. Scient. Fenn. xvi), Helsinki, 1922-3, pp. 67, 79, 94. Even Typhon, according to one version, is not under a mountain but in the depths of the waters, in Lake Serbonis on the border of Egypt (Hdt. 3. 5. 3, cf. Herodorus, F.G.H. 31 F 6I, A.R. 2. 1215, Eust. in D.P. 248).2 Others say that when Zeus' bolts set him on fire, he plunged into the sea, but was imprisoned there when Zeus planted Sicily on top of him (Nic. fr. 59 ap. Ant. Lib. 28; cf. Val. F1. 2. 26). Chronos has vanquished the usurper, wears the victor's crown,s and is now established on the throne of heaven. What happens next? Is Chronos in his turn supplanted by Zas ? That would be a difficult hypothesis, for Chronos is not, like Kronos, a power that has been banished from the world; and Zas is not, like Zeus, a new-born god who claims power as soon as he reaches maturity, but a god who has existed from the beginning beside Chronos.4 It is easier to suppose that there is simply a shift of emphasis in the narrative: Zas instead of Chronos becomes the centre of attention. Chronos is not cast out, he merely withdraws into the background. The only remaining event that we know of in Pherecydes' history is Zas' wedding, and as has been intimated above, this makes a fitting sequel to the theomachy. The gods have established their power, and they must now put their empire in order. It will be as well, before discussing Zas' wedding, to give the text of the papyrus fragment.s TWL tOLEVuLv o ra o[L]Kta yap UEO TO s ycLop[s r7oAAa 7-E KaL /LEya'Aa E"vaL, ovctWL UE tIL[EW.

The marriage of Zas and Chthonie resembles those of Uranos and Gaia, Zeus and Hera, and other lEpol y'CLou of mythology and cult. At the mytho- logical level, as we find it in Pherecydes, its symbolism is easily understood. The fructifying influence of the celestial power Zas-Helios turned the primeval Chthonie into the earth we know, clothing her with earth's visible surface features as with a garment.' When he gives her a robe embroidered with y^ , dy'vds etc., and says Todvy T E Tqt w, this is the same act that is referred to in fr. I, X~ovldy q ovoya EyEEvTO Ii, ErTEL&amp; at T Zas ygv yqpaS o60o.2 Whether the marriage produced further offspring, we cannot be sure. Perhaps mankind was one of its fruits; Zeus is father of gods and men, Earth is our mother, and if Pherecydes explained the origin of man at all, this is the most likely place. Let us now examine fr. 2 in more detail. The palace, provisions, and servants are in keeping with the fairly advanced stage of creation that has now been reached. The gift of the robe takes place on the third day of the wedding, be- cause that was the day of the anakalypteria in mortal weddings, for which Pherecydes is supplying an aition: Hesych. s.v. avavKaAv7TT-'-pLOV 7E 7j~V V4 qIv 7Tp(J0ov dyownV y T7pl'r 475pxpa". It need not, I think, worry us overmuch that in making the robe Zas undertakes an 'unmasculine task' (Kirk-Raven, p. 61) ; Eisler (op. cit., p. 199) has pointed out that weaving was men's work in Egypt (Hdt. 2. 35, S. O.C. 337 if.), but one can hardly argue that this is an oriental motif in Pherecydes.3 The decoration of the robe comprises the earth and its surroundings. What Tr 'Q2yr-voiY &amp;uaLra are is a mystery. Parallels of a kind I Compare Orph. fr. 238, where Zeus- Dionysus puts on a robe in the likeness of the sun, above it a deerskin dappled to re- present the stars, and round his waist a belt representing Oceanus. In a Sumerian poem (Falkenstein-Soden, Sumerische u. Akkadische Hymnen u. Gebete [1953], pp. 67-68) the goddess Inanna says of her father Enlil, 'The heavens he has put upon my head as a crown, The earth as sandals upon my feet.' 2 ydpas and -qttL- can be near-synonyms, e.g. Hes. Th. 393-6, 426-7, 449- 3 There were male weavers and em- broiderers in Greece by the fourth century, cf. P1. Phd. 87 b, Rep. 369 d, Aeschin. I. 97.</page><page sequence="13">166 M. L. WEST have been adduced by O. Kern, De Orphei Epimenidis Pherecydis theogoniis quaestiones criticae (1888), pp. 10o3 f., and Diels, S.P.A. W. 1897, 154 n. I. In II. 14. 202 Hera recalls that Oceanus and Tethys once received her in their house (Sdopot). In Aeschylus' P. V. (133, 300, cf. 396) Oceanus lives in a cave, and a cave can be described as 8;4pa-cra (Hes. Th. 303, 777; or &amp;d4ion, h. Herm. 27, 248, or pLyapa, Od. 4- 557). Other rivers too are said to live in houses or caves: Styx (Hes. Th. 777), Tiber (Virg. A. 8. 65, Ov. F. 5. 661), Achelous (Ov. M. 8. 56o). But if the 3OSpa-a 'S2y-vovo were of this kind, it is hard to see how they deserve special mention in the summary account of the robe. Some scholars have thought that &amp;tOa-ra in Clement's citation was corrupt; Preller, Rh. Mus. iv (1846), 388, proposed vcta-ra, Weil, R.E.G. x (1897), 3, &amp;8UaXra, both taking the reference to be to the rivers and streams that flow from Oceanus.' On the whole it seems safer to assume that 8~4para is sound.z Eisler (pp. 204-9) takes Ogenos as the Semitic and Egyptian type of world-ocean, above and below the world as well as round it, and &amp;OLpara in the astrological sense of zodiacal houses. But this bold interpretation is disproved by the theomachy, where Ogenos must be something like the traditional Oceanus. Conceivably 'houses' is used in a sense analogous to the astrological, of temporary habitations occupied by something constantly moving, sc. the network of river channels through which Ogenos, representing the whole body of the world's fresh water, passes. Another, perhaps more attractive, possibility is that the houses of Ogenos are not places where Ogenos himself dwells, but dwelling-places in or beside Ogenos, whether occupied by cosmic monsters such as Ophioneus (cf. Nonn. D. 8. 16I cited above) or by the blessed among men after their life on earth. The rest of col. i must have contained: the remaining items, if any, in the list of things represented on the robe; statements that Zas gave it to his bride, and that he spoke; and at least one sentence in his speech before the sentence containing yap (ii. I). How many lines are missing cannot be determined. ii. 3 is numbered line 6oo, on which reckoning the bottom line of col. i would be 597. This might represent, e.g., 23 columns of 26 lines each (23 x 26 = 598). But stichometry in papyri is notoriously unreliable; columns of 30 or 40 lines (both factors of 6oo) are just as likely, and these are not the only possibilities. The column-length need not even have been a fixed quantity, though the lines in the fragment we have are level in the two columns. Before ydp a participle is evidently required. Weil's /ovAodt'vos is generally accepted, with the meaning 'wishing marriages to be yours', i.e. under your patronage. This is unacceptable for two reasons. Firstly, marriages belong to Hera, not Ge, and the assumption that Pherecydes thought of Chthonie as becoming Hera as well as Ge is unsupported by evidence; secondly, and more conclusively, there is no logical connexion between the patronage of marriages and the gift of the robe. ado 0ot)s ycdpLovs Elva surely means 'that it is your wedding'-yd"pot of a single wedding as in Men. fr. 384, Dysc. 852, Dem. 30. 2 I, et saepe-and the participle to be supplied is 'making known' or something of the sort. The anakalypteria was the public unveiling of the bride not only 1 II. 21. 195-7, Pind. fr. 326, etc. Rivers might be mentioned apart from earth, cf. Hes. Th. I09, Wilamowitz on Eur.

Cf. Hesych., loc. cit. From this day forth Zas' bride will be seen in her new guise, as Ge. A gift from the husband was customary on this occasion, and the word JvaKaAv7r1-Tp~a was actually used of such gifts (Harpocr., s.v., Pollux 3. 36). There are other myths in which they are given by gods to their brides. Sicily was so given by Zeus to Kore (Diod. 5. 2. 3, Plut. Tim. 8); so was Thebes, according to another story (Euphorion fr. 107). For the gift of a robe Diels and others have compared Cadmus' gift to Harmonia (Apollod. 3. 4. 2). A rather more striking parallel has been adduced by K. Gantar in the Yugoslav periodical Ziva Antika vii. 2 (I957), 236 ff. According to a Babylonian myth, the gods persuaded Anu, Heaven, to marry IJtar and make her queen of the world. He does so, and clothes her with a richly decorated robe, the robe of sovereignty, the glory of shining Sin (god of night and the moon).' Having received her gift, Chthonie apparently makes a speech in reply. What does she do with the robe? The natural and obvious answer is that she puts it on. That is what robes are for, and the act would symbolize her transformation into Ge excellently. Yet Kirk and others think that she does something quite different and really rather strange: that she spreads it over a tree, the tree and robe together being Pherecydes' allegorical picture of the world. This view is based on Isidorus ap. Clem. Strom. 6. 53. 5 L va xLdOc~w ri EUTLV 1 r VqT7TTrEpOS sP Ka Sp7  VT' a7 rrE7TOKtALEVOV PSo (Ka) rra 0aa OEpEKUvIS c dAAryop ras EOEOArdyr7EV, and on the looser conjunction of robe and tree in the passage of Maximus cited above, p. 243. The embroidered robe of Isidorus must be the one given by Zas to Chthonie, and if it is 'on' a winged tree, then (it is argued) she must have put it there. But this conclusion involves serious difficulties. Firstly, while it is common enough in mythical cosmology for the world to be represented by a tree,2 and common enough for the heavens to be represented as a mantle,3 there is no parallel for a tree covered by a mantle; and even if we allowed that such a contamination of alternative concepts might occur, we should certainly expect the mantle to symbolize the sky and the tree its support,4 whereas in Pherecydes we know that the mantle sym- bolized the surface of the earth. Secondly, it is impossible to imagine how such behaviour on Chthonie's part could have been motivated in the myth. The act of covering a tree with a mantle has no parallel in real life.s It is common enough for a garment to be hung on the branch of a holy tree as dedication or decoration. But nobody could have used this as a picture of the world, and anyway, why should the bride be dedicating her bridal gifts ? There are also examples of dress being put on an image made out of a tree (cf. Kern, R.-E. iii. 160-2); but the dress is for the image, not for the tree. Eisler (pp. 590 ff.) brings forward three further kinds of parallel in support of his elaborate inter- pretation, but none of them will bear examination. He refers to a holy oak in Prussia, which was covered with a cloth except when a pilgrim wanted to see it; this may be admitted as evidence of the habits of Prussian museum-custodians, but hardly of anything else. He connects Pherecydes' winged tree with the For the robe of sovereignty cf. Enuma Eli&amp; 4. 29, Nonn. D. I. 480, 2. 571, 3- 197. 2 Cf. U. Holmberg, op. cit. 3 Cf. Eisler, op. cit. passim; Gantar, loc. cit. 4 The world tree usually rises above the earth, its branches supporting or represent- ing the sky. There are however cases where it supports the earth, see Eisler, pp. 765 f., Holmberg, pp. 53 f. s We must assume that the tree is a tree, and not a loom or the mast of a ship; see Kirk-Raven, p. 63.</page><page sequence="15">I68 M. L. WEST cult scenes depicted on certain Assyrian seals and reliefs,I where a stylized tree is topped with the solar symbol of the winged disk. Priests stand on either side holding things which hang down from the disk, and which Eisler takes to be the edges of a cloth with which the tree has just been or is just going to be covered. Pherecydes' veiled tree, he thinks, constitutes a tent in which Zas and Chthonie can lie together. In the ancient Orient, he maintains, tent-cloths were spread over small trees which had been stripped of all but their principal branches; and the erection of a tent for a new wife was an important part of some Hebrew and Arab marriage rituals. This construction is ingenious and pretty, but unfortunately it can be refuted at every point. The interpretation of the Assyrian cult scenes cannot be main- tained when all the relevant material is taken into account. From the evidence collected and described by Danthine, op. cit. i. 94-97, it is clear that the ap- pendages of the winged disk are separate tassels of some sort. The Assyrian representations of tents, on which is based the assertion that trees were used as framework, do not show trees at all, but manufactured tent-poles with arms, perfectly straight and each forked at the end, jointed to the central pole. This is particularly clear on the relief from Nineveh in the British Museum (no. 124927) showing the burning of an Arab encampment.z The whole structure of each tent appears to be toppling over, which a rooted tree could not do. Another relief, which survives only in a drawing, appears to show the erection of a royal tent, with the framework in a half-collapsed position.3 In any case, these tent props do not in the least resemble the sacred trees in the cult scenes, which have close branches down to the ground, and could not possibly serve as tents even if veiled. And there is no reason why Pherecydes should have put his L yEp c yadoS inside a tent; there is no Greek analogy for the Semitic tent- marriage. We have not yet exhausted the improbabilities of the view that the robe was spread over the tree. For if the tree and robe together represent the world, what becomes of Chthonie-Ge ? Admittedly it is possible to counter this ques- tion with another: if, as I have suggested is more probable, Chthonie-Ge puts the robe on, and the clothed goddess represents the world, where does the tree fit in ? Two solutions of the dilemma present themselves. One is that Chthonie is the tree, or rather (since Zas obviously does not marry a tree), she becomes a tree, as Daphne did when Apollo chased her, and lives on as a sort of cosmic Hamadryad. It is hard to see, however, why Pherecydes should introduce such a development into the story, how he could have supplied a cause for it, and above all what would be gained by it, if the robe remains a robe after the transformation. We have still not escaped from the unsatisfying image of the clothed tree, and we have created new problems besides. Once Zas has married Chthonie and she has put on the robe, the world is complete, the creation is accomplished. The allegory requires no further metamorphoses, and we postulate them at our peril.

The robe is not on the tree at all, it is on Chthonie and stays on her, representing the world. If the tree also represents the world, as still remains likely, it is an alternative allegory to that of the clothed goddess, and had no place in the wedding narrative. I can suggest a way in which it may have been introduced. There is at least one fragment that appears to come from a description of the world, or at any rate part of the world, as it now is: fr. 5 Diels KElvrJS 8S JOPS EVE~/Jp 'VEp UTEL 7 I apTapr ipotpa- qvAduaovat 8' at'r)v OvyarE'pE BopE'w, 1Ap-TvLal TE Kat OvEAAa. vOa Zdsg EK9cLAAEcL GEW 7av 7 -r tvfEptr?., There are other fragments which are most easily accounted for by the assumption that this description was not limited to nether regions of the universe, but embraced the whole of it. Let us attempt to reconstruct it. 'Below that division is the division of Tartarus.' What is 'that division' likely to be ? The most probable hypothesis is that it corresponds to Hades.

The Styx in Hesiod (Th. 793 ff.) has the power of depriving a god who falsely swears upon it of breath and speech for a year, and of the company and board of the gods for nine years more; a similar doctrine is attested for 'Orpheus' (fr. 295). This banishment must have been interpreted as condemnation to a term of life in a mortal body, as in Empedocles fr. I a5.

If the EKpOr- in Pherecydes was interpreted in the same way by the same people, we are bound to infer that it too was a stream or fountain somehow connected with the souls of the dead.' We shall be able to guess a little more about it presently. Above the world of the dead must be the world of the living; and above this the home of the gods.

It may mean that ambrosia grew, or issued forth from a spring, for the gods' nourishment. For this idea cf. Eur. Hipp. 748 ff. Kpa7vaU ' L/dtrpOaYtL XE'OVTra Z7v8 tzEMadOpwV rapd KOlT'a, Moero fr.

Such a speculation concerning habitation of the moon would not be isolated. Epimenides (fr. 2) said that the Nemean Lion was thrown down from the moon (cf. Euphorion fr. 84, Herodorus F.G.H. 31 F 4, sch. A.R. I. 498). According to Orph. fr. 91 the moon is another earth, n 7To'AA' ovipE' E`Xa5OV E XEL, TO) aLTTEc, jroAX' apa. Anaxagoras and Democritus taught that the moon was a solid world like our own, with plains, mountains, and ravines (Aet. 2. 25. 9, 30. 3, Hippol. Ref. I. 8. Io), and if we believe Diog. Laert. 2. 8, Anaxagoras also spoke of lunar dwellings or settlements (oCK710ES).3 So it is quite possible that Pherecydes made it the home or table of the gods.4 If his book contained a systematic description of the divisions of the universe, from top to bottom, we must consider how it could have been introduced. The nearest parallel is Hesiod's account of the underworld in Th. 720-8 10. This too consists of a series of self-contained items, mostly introduced by IvOa or ivOa d'. -Vrv 7rpoTOE in 746 (cf. 767), which seems to mean 'as you go farther', resembles Pherecydes' KELV77S T-77 IOp q EVEpOE. The whole. section is brought in at the point where Tartarus comes into the narrative, viz. when the Titans are banished there. In Pherecydes likewise a description of the whole world is likely to have been introduced at the most appropriate place in the narrative; and that is, when the world is brought to completion by the wedding of Zas the Lake of Memory, from which the initiate is bidden to drink when he arrives in Hades, in the gold plates from Petelia and Eleu- thernae in Crete, Orph. fr. 32 (a) and (b). SA very similar method of interpretation is seen in the passage of Porphyry cited above. Those who think that the d~po may have been an actual emission of semen, sc. that of Chronos (Kirk-Raven, p. 59, Schwabl, R.-E. Supp. ix.

The description may have concluded the book. Now the transi- tion from mythical to physical cosmology at this point is an excellent reason for the introduction of the new physical symbol of the winged tree. One might envisage a transition on these lines: 'In this way, then, the world came into being. And it is like a great tree, with wings ... .' The tree is the physical struc- ture that is described in what follows, though the metaphor need not have been maintained in detail. The division of the world-tree, or rather of the tree- world, into layers or stories is paralleled by a practice of the Altai shamans reported by Radlov and Verbitsky (cited by Holmberg, op. cit., pp. 28, 135)- It involves a birch-tree, in the trunk of which nine notches are made, each big enough to serve as a step. These steps represent the stages of the shaman's journey from the earth to the dwelling of the highest god at the top of the tree. For an actual description of the parts of a world-tree, we may compare that in the Norse poem Grimnismdl (97 ff.), where Odin, sitting disguised in the hall of king Geirr66, describes (among many other things) the ash-tree Yggdrasil and the habitations that lie beneath its three roots: Hel, the home of the dead; the home of the Frost Giants; and the home of mankind. Under this tree was the prophetic spring of Ur6 (Viiluspd 52); and this brings us back to Pherecydes' EKpo~. A perennial spring is often associated with the world-tree of mythical cosmology: see Holmberg, op. cit., pp. 56 f., 60o f., fi9 ff., 94.' In many cases its water is the Water of Life; and when we remember what we have already concluded about Pherecydes' EKpo on quite other grounds, it is difficult to avoid the inference that it corresponded closely to the Orphics' Spring of Memory: that those souls which drank from it entered upon a new life. This would agree admirably with the interpretation men- tioned by ps.-Galen, and it would account for the constant association of Pherecydes with Pythagoras in the biographical tradition. We must now inquire into the significance of the wings on Pherecydes' tree. It is remotely possible that the motif was suggested to him by some specimen of Assyrian art, but even if it was, he must have given the wings some new meaning of his own. Wings would clearly be absurd on a normal tree rooted in the earth. But the world-tree is not rooted in the earth, for it contains the earth in itself. Therefore it flies or glides through space, and for this it needs wings, just as sandals or chariots need wings if they are to dispense with the earth's accustomed support and fly.2 A closer parallel for the winged world- tree is Hippol. Ref. 4- 49 H EpUE3s SE EUrV 7 0V7T7dTrEpos iawv rrpalvwv KaTEEpOUS T70OV dAovS SLa EC9lor9S 7 [Y KLaE 'u7p'wv TOV K&amp;fLOV, where the wings cor- respond to those with which Perseus was represented. Perhaps the winged wheel of Ixion also belongs here. Interpreters of the Ixion myth usually identify the wheel with the sun (cf. Cook, Zeus i. 198-211). But there is a I In Hesiod's cosmology, where are the roots of earth and sea, there also are their 'springs', Th. 728, 736 ff. The oak of Zeus at Dodona, at the foot of which the oracular spring of Zeus Naios issued forth, would be another Greek parallel if it were true that it was thought of as a type of the world-tree; but the statement in Eisler, repeated by Holmberg, that its roots were said to reach down into Tartarus, has no ancient founda- tion. It derives from a misunderstanding (which a little checking of references would have corrected) of C. Boetticher, Baumkultus der Hellenen (1856), p. I112. 2 For the addition of wings to unexpected things compare also the winged bed which conveys the sun round Oceanus at night in Mimn. Io. 5 ff.; and on the popularity of wings in archaic art cf. Nilsson, Minoan- Mycenaean Religion2, pp. 507 f.; Eitrem, R.-E. vi A. 886 f.</page><page sequence="19">172 M. L. WEST parallel Armenian myth which suggests that originally it was rather the wheel that turns the whole universe. In a cave in the mountains a great wheel turns ceaselessly, day and night. Beside it (not on it) a giant is bound. He will remain bound until the end of the world. He never takes his eyes from the turn- ing wheel; for when it stops, he will be freed (A. Olrik, op. cit., pp. 201 f.). This myth is probably of Caucasian origin; and it is highly significant that the torments of several other sinners in Greek mythology-Prometheus, Tityos, Tantalos, Otos and Ephialtes-can also be traced back to an ancient, well- established and apparently indigenous Caucasian myth, as Olrik showed (op. cit., pp. 133-290). Pherecydes lived at a time when the problem of how the world is supported had to be faced; the infinite regress of primitive speculation was intolerable, and it had been realized that the world must somehow swing free in space. Anaximander considered that the earth hung in the middle of the world be- cause there was no reason for it to move in one direction more than any other; but he was in advance of his time. Anaximenes' doctrine of thin flaky worlds, buoyed up on the all-encompassing air, is closer to what we seem to have in Pherecydes: a world-tree that flies, buoyed up perhaps on those winds that blow about its lowest roots, where the daughters of Boreas, the Harpies and Thyella, guard the division of Tartarus. I will conclude with a further conjecture. Pherecydes is known to have used the term Chaos (fr. Ia); and I would suggest that it is through Chaos that the world-tree flies. This assumption would make it easier to understand how Xdos, which in Hesiod denotes the space between earth and Tartarus (Th. 814, no doubt also 116, 123, 700), could come to be used in the century after Pherecydes of the air through which Zeus' eagle flies (Bacch. 5. 27, cf. Eur. fr. 448, Ar. Nub. 423, 628, Av. 1218, Simm. Pter. 7). If we also suppose that Pherecydes sought for a choice epithet to convey the idea that the Chaos was fathomless, and chose the epic d'rpVyEro, which is mostly applied to the sea, but also to aWO'p in the formula St' al'pos 'TpvyETroo (II. I7. 425, Hes. pap. K2. 34, h. Dem. 67, 457), we can see how later interpreters could be misled into thinking that by Xdos Pherecydes meant water (Achill. Isag. in Arat. p. 3I1 30 Maass, cf. sch. Hes. Th. I 16, Tz. in Lyc. 145), a Stoic doctrine hardly conceivable in the sixth century (cf. Wilamowitz, K1. Schr. v (2), p. 167 n. I). An alternative explanation of the misunderstanding might be that Pherecydes described the tree's progress through Chaos by some swimming or rowing metaphor. III. THALES We have been swimming through Chaos long enough, and the name of Thales might seem to afford a prospect of calmer waters. Next to nothing is recorded of his cosmological doctrines, and disagreement on its interpretation is neither wide nor bitter. The earth is supported by water; all things come from water. Few would dissent from this as a statement of Thales' cosmology, or care to add to it. Yet it can hardly be doubted that there was originally very much more to it than that. Thales was a sixth-century Ionian; he was, moreover, famous in his time and among his people for his practical and theoretical resource- fulness. Subsequently he was renowned as the founder of the Ionian school of philosophy. He was the older contemporary, fellow citizen and reputedly</page><page sequence="20">THREE PRESOCRATIC COSMOLOGIES 173 friend and teacher ofAnaximander, whose cosmology has a maturity and simple grandeur that astonishes the student and was never surpassed in antiquity. Such was Thales; and what we are told about his cosmology belongs to the level of primitive myth. The water-cosmogony is the commonest type of crea- tion myth all over the world: the primeval waste of waters, in the middle of which a small islet appears, growing in size until it reaches the dimensions of the whole earth. (See H. Schwabl, R.-E. Supp. ix. 1510, with literature.) The conception of the earth floating on water had been familiar to the Egyptians for hundred or thousands of years; and if Thales' achievement was to introduce this view to Greece, as is often supposed, what was gained by it ? What did it explain that was not as well or better accounted for by the Hesiodic conception of tangled roots of earth and water, dissolving ultimately into a dark, misty, inflammable element called chaos? If the obscure personage Anaximander is ahead of his time, the celebrated Thales appears to be centuries behind it. We expect from him a theory much more imaginative and original, deduced from the evidence of the senses, giving unity to the world, and providing a point of departure for his successor. Granted all this, it might seem useless to speculate further. Aristotle has told us all he knows, and no one in antiquity seems to have known substantially more. Thales' opinions were evidently forgotten at so early a date that there can be no hope of reconstructing them from any ancient testimonia that we possess or can ever expect to find. Yet if I am not mistaken, the central fact about his lost cosmology can be recovered by simple inference. For we have in our hands, if we will only see it, a clue at once so important as to lead us straight to the heart of the matter, and so obvious that one can only wonder that it has not been used before. But first it is necessary to consider Anaximander's system. He postulates as the basic state of the universe an amorphous and undifferentiated infinity of matter, in constant and probably random motion. In it worlds come into being from time to time. There is no limit to their number, because the continuum in which they are formed is infinite in extent. None of them lasts for ever; they pass away as they came into being. Only the Infinite that encompasses them is immortal and ageless.' What is a world ? It is a system formed by a process of separation from the surrounding Infinite. It consists for the most part of empty air. At the centre is a solid body suspended in equipoise, in our world the earth. This is encircled by a number of concentric rings of fire and mist, which all revolve in one direc- tion but at different speeds. So if we would see the world as a whole, we should imagine a small, probably spherical space hollowed out from the Infinite, with the peculiarity that objects at the edges of the space tend to be carried round in circles, while at the centre they remain stationary. Such a system patently resembles a vortex, and the common assumption It is far-fetched to interpret the testi- monia as referring to worlds successive in time and not coexistent, and quite in- admissible to reject them altogether as Kirk does (C.Q. N.s. v [I955], 28-32 and Presoc. Phil., pp. I22 f.) from inability to imagine what empirical considerations could have led Anaximander to the idea of innumerable worlds. He wished to explain the world in terms of universal natural processes. What- ever process caused this world to form out of the Infinite would naturally be likely to form other worlds elsewhere and at different times. They are not visible to us, but their existence can be inferred from that of our world, although they are quite unconnected with it. That Anaximander reasoned like this ought not to strain our credulity.</page><page sequence="21">174 M. L. WEST that Anaximander thought of it as such is almost certainly correct.' The vortex principle explains not only the present structure of the world, but also its origin. We are told that it is the eternal motion in the Infinite that causes the formation and dissolution of worlds (Hippol. Ref. I. 6. 2, Hermias Irris. io). This motion probably consists of random currents running in no fixed direction. From time to time they result in a vortex, which lasts for a while and then slows down and disappears. A vortex is not attested for Anaximenes either. But it is likely enough that he made use of this very convenient principle, just as he retained many other features of his predecessor's system: an infinite primary substance in everlasting motion (Simpl. Phys. 24. 26), innumerable worlds (Aet. 2. I. 3), a flat earth, -poral of celestial bodies caused by air pressure, etc. It is not recorded that he had any new explanation of the formation of revolving world-systems, and indeed, since his whole universe was of air, he could hardly help seeing such systems as based on whirlwinds. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the whole development of Ionian cosmology, leaving aside the quixotic Xenophanes and the enigmatic Hera- clitus, is dominated by the concept of the 1iv-q. We can trace it from Anaxi- mander through Anaximenes, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and Archelaus down to Leucippus and Democritus; their systems are all variations on one basic pattern. Now a vortex is a phenomenon observed primarily in water. The tradition represented by these philosophers was reputedly initiated by Thales: and Thales' cosmology, alone of the whole series, was based on water. That the Blvq-concept originated in that cosmology must appear extremely probably as soon as these facts are juxtaposed. A very welcome probability it is too; for it enables us at last to credit Thales with a cosmology worthy of his name and era. With the central principle in our hands, we can now proceed to a tentative reconstruction of the way in which Thales arrived at it and of the details connected with it. It has long been inferred from his recorded belief in a floating earth that he was indebted to Egyptian or Semitic conceptions; cf. Kirk-Raven, pp. 90go ff. Tannery went further, and assumed that as in the near eastern cosmolo- gies the waters lay not only below but also above and all round the earth, so for Thales the world was a kind of bubble enclosed in water.2 This is likely enough; Thales would have accepted the idea of an ocean enclosing the whole world, provided that it corresponded to observation and reason. Observation confirms that there is water beneath the earth, for it springs up through the earth in many places; and that there is water above the earth, for it frequently descends from the sky. Reason persuades that the upper and lower waters are connected: the alternative would be a shelf of air extending indefinitely be- tween them. The world, then, is a cavity somehow hollowed out in the infinite waters. Thales was faced with the problem of how such a cavity could occur. The answer of the Semitic peoples, that it was simply created by God, was not the sort of answer he was looking for. He might have made something I The fact that none of the doxographers speak of a vortex in connexion with Anaxi- mander's cosmology certainly indicates that this detail was unknown to Theophrastus; but it is likely enough that Theophrastus' information was second-hand and incom- plete. I am not convinced by H61scher's argument (Hermes lxxxi [i953], 266) that a vortex is excluded by the spontaneous, non- mechanical way in which the shell of fire at first surrounds the earth 'like the bark round a tree' (ps.-Plut. Strom. 2). 2 P. Tannery, Pour l'histoire de la science hellenez (1930), P. 74-</page><page sequence="22">THREE PRESOCRATIC COSMOLOGIES 175 out of the Egyptian view that the god was Shu, the air. But he had a better idea--one that accounted both for the cavity and for the observed rotary motion of its outer parts. The world was a vortex, formed naturally by the currents of the cosmic ocean. He may have explained the concretion of the earth either by separation, the heaviest elements in the water tending to congregate at the centre of the vortex, or by condensation as in Anaximenes' air-cosmology, the water at the centre being compressed, thickened, and eventually solidified by the action of the SLrV. The former seems to me the more likely; Thales' successors made much both of centripetal force (cf. Arist. De caelo 2. 13. 295a10 iff.) and of the possibilities of analytical separation. Vapour can visibly be separated off water, and if water contains vapour, it might be argued, it must also contain heavier and more solid ingredients to compensate. Thales may perhaps have reasoned, like Anaximander, that this vortex is unlikely to persist for ever, and that there should be other similar vortices elsewhere. But these thoughts may not have occurred to him. The cosmology that we have attributed to him distinguishes itself from its mythological antecedents by its adherence to physical principles and processes. But it retains signs of its ancestry. Thales may have got his world-ocean from the east, but one of the things that led him to it must have been his desire to derive all things from a single physical element. In myth it is water above all else, and the gods of water, that can change into other things; see M. Ninck, 'Die Bedeutung des Wassers im Kult und Leben der Alten' (Philologus Suppl. xiv [1921], Heft 2), pp. 138-8o. Often in the primitive water-cosmogonies the land that appears in the waters, or the primeval being who is to create the land, does not simply appear as it were ex nihilo, but grows from some natural disturbance in the water: a bubble, a patch of foam, or the like; cf. A. O. Diihnhardt, Natursagen i (I9o7), pp. I8 f., 43, 46, 54, 56, 66 f., cited by H. Schwabl, R.-E. Supp. ix. 1442. Thales has different aims and a different logic; but his mind still tends to run on the same lines.' The link with myth is still discernible; with Anaximander it is broken. It may be asked why, if Thales' cosmology was such as we have limned, the only details of it to be preserved were that everything comes from water and that the earth rests on water: why the vortex itself, the central feature of the system, was forgotten. To answer this question we must inquire into the means by which any of Thales' views were preserved at all. He did not set them down in a book, or if he did, it soon disappeared. It is unlikely that they were preserved by oral tradition, which traffics in anecdotes and aphorisms, not in cosmological systems. Tannery (op. cit., p. 92 n. I) has put forward the only plausible hypothesis, viz. that Thales' views were known from Anaxi- mander's contradictions of them. Anaximander is the one writer who certainly knew what Thales thought. He lived in the same town, and was interested in the same things; he must have heard the older man expound his cosmology. When he came to develop his own system, and set it forth in a book, he naturally His explanation of the annual Nile flood (Aet. 4. i. I, cf. Hdt. 2. 20) might be seen as a translation into physical theory of the Egyptian myth according to which the flood represented Osiris' victory over Seth. Seth manifested himself in the drought and the hot south wind from the desert (cf. G. Seippel, Der Typhonmythos, Diss. Greifswald 1939, p. I09), Osiris in the new water. The essence of Thales' theory too was that the flood was delayed by wind (and so built up its strength) : but of course it had to be the north winds, the Etesians, that held back the northward- flowing Nile.</page><page sequence="23">176 M. L. WEST referred to the views of his famous predecessor, and in the usual manner of Greek writers, he referred to him when he disagreed with him. That was not very often. He took over the basic pattern of the natural vortex in the primeval continuum, and possibly other details that can no longer be discovered. Now it is remarkable that the two facts about Thales' system known to Aristotle are both features with which Anaximander strikingly disagreed. He rejected water as the continuum; and he rejected the earth supported from beneath. We may confidently assume that it was from Anaximander that Hippias, who seems to have been Aristotle's source (Snell, Philol. xcvi [1944], I70-82), gleaned his information about Thales. Anaximander did not mention Thales in connexion with the vortex because he followed the same view himself. Anaximander's achievement remains an impressive one, and we have reduced it to credible proportions. It now appears that his system and those of his successors down to the late fifth century are all modifications of the basic pattern created by Thales. It is a pattern that could have been created by few men and at few periods of history. But the sixth century in Ionia was such a period. For a short time the boundaries of man's imagination receded at the speed of thought. It was then, perhaps, that a rhapsode interpolated in Hesiod's Theogony an estimate of the time it would take a man to fall from here to Tar- tarus: not nine days, nor thrice nine days, but over ayear (740 ff.). It was at the end of the century that a Greek (a Milesian) first conceived the grand project of going and conquering the Persian Empire. It was in this century, perhaps, that Greeks first conceived and executed mammoth epics, lasting not three hours but at least three days; and not content with that, arranged eight complete epics (some pre-existing, others apparently composed for the purpose; two of them by a Milesian) into a vast continuous series covering the whole of the Trojan War in 77 books., It was then that a man could look into an eddy of the Maeander-and see the universe.
