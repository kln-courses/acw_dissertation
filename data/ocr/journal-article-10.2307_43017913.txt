Sometimes it happens that the expert is not the famous professional at all, but the ardent amateur. And so it seems in Jack Schaefer' s latest and perhaps most unusual work. Schaefer, writer of western fiction, along with Budd Schulberg, writer of life's seamier side, has temporarily defected from the camp of mankind to explore that of other animals. And, they follow a prestigious line of writers, famous in other areas, who became well-known bestiarists . . . among them Pliny the Elder, Plutarch and Aristotle. Schaefer describes himself as a late-blooming amateur zoologist, in awe of his animal evolution. He is obviously fascinated unto obsession with research and patient observation of the wildlife near his New Mexico home. And even though those with more letters before and after their names may call his work anthropomorphic, he does a most creditable job bridging that gap between reality and human's perception of reality. As the enthusiastic amateur he doesn't overlook interesting and often endearing traits, which so often happens in the pursuit of science and Degrees. Nevertheless, all the necessary documented and inferred facts are included in palatable form. He is at once a preservationist, justly naming T. Roosevelt "that archpredator" ; a conservationist, blaming pesticides on dwindling bat populations; and most of all, a chronicler of everything a layman would want to know . . . and sometimes more ... of certain common and some uncommon desert inhabitants ; a written apology for past attitudes toward his fellow creatures previously treated as mere props for human drama. One hopes that perhaps popular writers can do more toward shaping or re-shaping readers' ideas of wildlife than can others with lesser influence. My own particular bias says the peccary was an unfortunate and dull choice with which to begin the book. I was more fond of his other creatures : the friendly kangaroo rat who, in fact, started Schaefer's fascination with wild animals; the lowly gopher whose incisors grow an incredible fourteen inches a year; the odious bat, a mammal which grew membrane between its "fingers," then learned to fly! Also included in his unusual selection are the shrew, porcupine, puma, armadillo, mole, ringtail cat, pronghorn, 'possum and rabbit. The manuscript is full of how and why and if the animals hunt or are hunted, their symbiotic relationships, myths surrounding them, and all aspects of behavior from birth to death. If fault is to be found it would be the quixotic choice of animals studied, and the occasional belabouring of certain aspects such as the evolution of hoofs. Enhancing the word studies are the absolutely superb pen and ink studies by noted wildlife artist, Linda K. Powell, which are reminiscent of the 16th Century renderings of A. DÃ¼rer.

So obvious is the exclusion of the southwest' s most infamous denizen, trickster coyote, one immediately and hopefully assumes this bestiary to be only the first in a continuing and charming succession of zoographies to come.
