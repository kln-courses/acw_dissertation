<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shiva Nataraja: Shifting Meanings of an Icon Padma Kaimal To outsiders and to many Indians as well, sculptures of Shiva Nataraja are among the best-known objects of Indic art.' In survey texts of world and Asian art history, in India's handi- craft shops, even on travel brochures and concert programs, images of this Hindu god dancing in a ring of flame have come to denote India itself. And yet this is only one among many forms in which Indian artisans have over centuries portrayed Shiva's dance. Why did this form, which was specific to the Tamil region in southeastern India and which was only formulated in the ninth or tenth century C.E., gain such prominence? How did this image type gain the power to signify so much? Certainly the form itself of this sculptural type is visually compelling in the dramatic transverse line of the lifted leg, the radial spray of arms, legs, and locks of hair, the thrilling tension between dynamic action and balanced stillness (Figs. 1-3). And yet artists in India have produced other equally wonderful objects that have not enjoyed such fame. The ambitious Chola dynasty's interest in Nataraja from the tenth to the thirteenth centuries may once have lent prestige to the icon type. As the record of that patronage is now, however, familiar only to specialists in Chola history, that association cannot explain the breadth of Nataraja sculptures' modern reputation. I suspect that Ananda K. Coomaraswamy's essay "The Dance of Shiva" written early in the twentieth century has had much to do with their present fame. A formative influence on the new field of Indian art history from his appointment as curator of Indian art at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in 1917 until his death in 1947, Coomaraswamy made Indic art (( 1 i ? ?-~ ~' ? -u-. 7 ( ~ ? ?~ ~CE~i~~ ~ i? r~ ~'~?:: ~2 ?? qB 1 "~ .' rU-~,, ?r?. ~ r~r ?

So satisfying does his iconographic analysis seem to have been that it foreclosed further debate on the subject. Unchallenged for over eighty years, Coomaraswamy's reading still underpins scholarly writing on the Nataraja icon type.3 My purpose in the present essay is to challenge Coomaraswa- my's reading of Nataraja images and thereby to extricate them from the limits of the interpretative frame he imposed on them. I differ with Coomaraswamy's interpretation on three counts. The first is that I question whether anyone can recover fully these objects' original meaning, particularly given the fragmentary nature of the evidence surviving from medieval South India. Second, I reject the assumption that the meaning of Nataraja icons was uniform or static. We will comprehend the pieces more richly if we take Richard Davis's approach by studying the varied meanings art objects have taken on over the different "lives" they have endured.4 The third count on which I challenge Coomaraswamy's explanation of Nataraja images is that I find his use of textual evidence unconvincing. My strongest objection is that he interpreted the sculptures through texts written several centu- ries after sculptors first represented this deity in bronze and stone, a disjuncture he did not acknowledge or account for in his essay. I also object in more general terms to Coomaraswa- my's assumption (albeit common among intellectuals of his time) of a simple equivalence between verbal texts and visual images. As Brendan Cassidy has recently pointed out, each medium has its own spheres of eloquence; neither is a mere translation of the other.5 Interactions between verbal and visual media are likely to have been complicated, multivalent. Even poems based on the direct contemplation of Nataraja sculptures would have operated at a semiotic distance from those sculptures; their words would have introduced their author's personal responses, insights, and perhaps reactions to contemporary events into their interpretations of these objects. Nor do I believe that the written word reports the past with greater authority than visual forms do, or that its voice somehow carries better across the centuries. Rather, I see texts as offering glimpses of this past that are just as partial, mobile, and difficult to read as visual material. I maintain that sculptural representations of Shiva Nataraja signified a variety of things to viewers over the centuries; that those associations are likely to have shifted over time and with different audiences; and that we may not recover any of those meanings with absolute confidence. The textual evidence Coomaraswamy cited reveals an interpretation that operated for some devotees at the Nataraja temple in Chidambaram in and after the thirteenth century. The ideas in these texts may have been in circulation before that, and they may have been associated with the Nataraja sculptures made in the preceding centuries, but those early Nataraja images are likely to have carried other connotations for many of their earliest viewers. Drawing on visual and inscriptional evidence, I would like to propose two quite different meanings viewers could have received from representations of Nataraja in the tenth cen- $; i , c.

The iconographic markers in this image type open up the possibility that it first connoted Shiva's wild dance with emblems of death, celebrating his destructive role in the cycle of existence. I also suspect that Shiva Nataraja came to function as an emblem of the Chola dynasty as early as the fourth quarter of the tenth century. The same centuries intervening between the first Nataraja images and the texts Coomaraswamy used, roughly the tenth to thirteenth centu- ries, were also the centuries during which the Chola dynasty flourished, exercising political and martial authority across South India and beyond. As Chola fame increased over the course of the tenth century, sculptures of Nataraja were rendered with increasing frequency in the Kaveri delta, which the Cholas aspired to control, particularly on temples spon- sored by the Chola queen Sembiyan Mahadevi. Nataraja's visual form may even have played a role in encouraging Chola patronage and strengthening the alliance between these kings and the priestly community that maintained the temple at Chidambaram.6 Both groups cherished expansionist ambi-</page><page sequence="3">392 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 1999 VOLUME LXXXI NUMBER 3 ?F . or A.A- 141# ioi trig, AND t? pm~lp . 3 Shiva Nataraja, cire perdue bronze, funded by Rajaraja I Chola for the inner sanctum of his Rajarajeshvara temple in Tanjavur, ca. 1010 (photo: courtesy of Lalit Kala Akademi) tions and strove to establish their own niches of the Tamil landscape as centers of a vast realm. The radial composition that I perceive underlying this form of Nataraja images could have embodied these shared agendas nicely. My argument begins with summaries of Nataraja's iconogra- phy and Coomaraswamy's analysis of it. I then locate the icon type historically and geographically, summarizing its early history, noting how it differed from previous renderings of Shiva's dance, and describing the temple complex at Chidam- baram where the worship of Nataraja has been focused since the inception of his cult (Fig. 4). I next reexamine the iconographic components of the Nataraja type, noting their emphasis on Shiva's destructive aspect. Before arguing the icon's likely function as a royal emblem of the early Cholas, I discuss the nature of Chola kingship and some transforma- tions at Chidambaram that suggest Chola involvement there. I explore Sembiyan Mahadevi's deployment of Chidambaram Nataraja as a Chola emblem and the possibility that she may have been inspired in this by Parantaka I Chola (r. 907-54). In pursuing these alternative meanings, I rely especially on Kamil Zvelebil's synthetic essay on Shiva's dance; Hermann Kulke's and David Shulman's innovative approaches to myth and history;7 Douglas Barrett's chronology of early Nataraja sculptures;8 and David Smith's and Paul Younger's interpreta- tions of Chidambaram. The present essay synthesizes their ideas with my reexamination of Nataraja's form and my study of tenth-century temples that bear Nataraja relief images. The Form of Nataraja Icons By the term Nataraja I mean representations of Shiva perform- ing his "dance of furious bliss" (ananda-tandava).

Parallel to the dramatic transverse line of the lifted leg, one of his four arms crosses the body, its relaxed "elephant hand" (gajahasta) suspended above an equally relaxed ankle. Shiva places one of his right hands just above that loose wrist in the open-palm gesture (abhayamudra). Behind these boldly dis- posed limbs, the hips twist slightly to Shiva's right, but the torso remains erect. Long, matted tresses alternating with flower garlands stream outward from Shiva's head. On his right and among these locks sits a diminutive personification of the river Ganga (the Ganges), her body human above the waist and piscine below. She presses her palms together in the gesture of respectful address (anjalimudra). A crescent moon, a flower sacred to Shiva (the datura), and a cluster of spiky kondrai leaves crown Shiva's topknot. Shiva stands on a rotund dwarf. During the reign of the Chola dynasty, artists rendered Nataraja in freestanding bronze, in stone relief, and in mural painting. The sculptures could serve as objects of worship, sites into which the divine himself would become manifest when properly invoked. The bronze sculpture of Nataraja in his temple at Chidambaram remains under worship at the temple's center as the most sacred of his representations, even as the god himself. As such it receives the honors one would bestow on the body of a king: it is awakened each morning, bathed, offered meals, delighted with music and dance, and put to sleep in the evening. Here, as at other Hindu temples, the icon at the temple's center embodies the deity's living presence. It must not be photographed. Although in the present essay I use the Sanskrit term Nataraja (meaning "Lord of the Dance") for this image type, Chola sources refer to these images and the deity they represent in Tamil, the language of southeastern India. There he is Adavallan or Kuttaperumanadigal, which also mean "Lord of the Dance." Modern authors also refer to him as Anandatandavamurti, meaning in Sanskrit "he who performs the dance of furious bliss." Coomaraswamy's Interpretation of Nataraja Icons Coomaraswamy attached to this sculptural form ideas in a variety of texts and songs about Shiva's dance. He deduced that the fire in one of Nataraja's hands signifies cosmic destruction while the drum in his opposite hand beats the rhythm of creation. The open palm offers protection. The drooping hand points to the raised foot, which signifies release, offering devotees enlightenment, release from illu- sion. Shiva's planted foot offers shelter to the soul.

His dance destroys the universe, but also the bonds on every soul. He frees these souls from their deeds and egos. Shiva dances in the heart of every devotee, and at the center of the universe that is his home, the South Indian city of Chidam- baram. Shiva's dance of simultaneous joy and fury thus represents his mastery over the cosmic cycle and his promise to enlighten the faithful. Coomaraswamy identified the verbal sources for his read- ing as "copious contemporary literature [emphasis added], which enables us to fully explain not only the general significance of the dance, but equally, the details of its concrete symbolism."' And yet these could only be consid- ered contemporary in the loosest sense. Coomaraswamy based much of his argument on the Tamil Unmaivilakkam, which was written in 1255/6, and the Citampara Mummani Kovai, a seventeenth-century Tamil hymn of praise.'0 He cited passages from three other Tamil sources, the Shivajnana Siddhiyar, the Tiruarutpayan, the TiruvatavurarPuranam, and a Bengali hymn to Kali, but he did not attach their philosophi- cal concepts to the specific dance form Nataraja articulates. These last four sources, then, could not be claimed as contemporary anchors for his reading of Nataraja. Coomara- swamy did refer to Tirumular's Tirumantiram, which may be of the eleventh century, but its date is much debated." Several scholars have returned to this as an important text for interpreting early concepts of Nataraja, and Smith points out that it already incorporated concepts central to later devo- tional poetry about Nataraja.12 And yet the Tirumantiram may have followed the first Nataraja sculptures by a good century. If, on the other hand, this text was contemporary with them, significant differences between its descriptions and the Nata- raja form of our study still preclude a simple equation between these sculptures and the philosophical concepts in this text. I will discuss those differences below. That Coomaraswamy did not mention in his essay a chrono- logical distance between these texts and the earliest Nataraja sculptures probably had much to do with the different standards of evidence operating in early twentieth-century art history, as well as with the paucity of scholarship then available on these texts and their historical contexts. The omission may also have resulted from Coomaraswamy's own distance from these texts. Coomaraswamy appears to have turned over the archival work to a Tamil colleague, T. A. Gopinatha Rao. Rao claimed responsibility for that research when he republished Coomaraswamy's essay in his own book, The Elements of Hindu Iconography, noting that Coomaraswamy granted permission for this in exchange for Rao's research.13 Rao worked directly with Tamil iconographic texts and was therefore an excellent choice for thisjob, but such subcontract- ing reflects in Coomaraswamy an attitude toward textual evidence at once too casual and too confident to bind a reader of the late twentieth century to his analysis. The Chronology of Early Nataraja Images Nataraja was not the first sculptural form to represent Shiva dancing. That subject had been carved in many parts of the Indian subcontinent since at least the early sixth century.14 Zvelebil maintains that some of the early southern forms may have served as iconographic precedents for Nataraja im- ages,15 but their emblems and postures distinguish them consistently from this form. On most dancing forms of Shiva made before the tenth century, the lifted leg does not cross in front of the hips (Figs. 5, 6). Such figures may have as many as sixteen arms instead of four. The drum and the flame are usually absent from their hands. Many of these early figures dance on a platform instead of on a dwarf. In Tamil literature as in sculpture, Shiva's dance figures before the tenth century in forms significantly distinct from Nataraja's. One finds evidence of Nataraja's full form only with the tenth century.'6 Zvelebil and Younger perceive correspondences to the Nataraja form in several seventh- and eighth-century bhakti hymns,"7 but none of these yet mentions the circle of flame, the flying sashes, the leg lifted across the body, or locks of hair that fly or fan out. The trampled dwarf is seldom mentioned; when discussed in the Tirumantiram, the dwarf is a terrifying creature with eight arms, whereas Nata- raja sculptures consistently give him only two arms, an unthreatening facial expression, and a toddler's body.'" These songs also include as the god's attributes features that are not part of the Nataraja form but of some of Shiva's other manifestations: a trumpet, a fawn, or a skull bowl in his hand, a beggar's water jug, and the throat gleaming with half-</page><page sequence="6">SIIVA NATARAJA: SIIIFTING MEANINGS OF AN ICON 395 swallowed poison. These sources do not, in other words, describe the Nataraja form. From a welter of variant renderings for Shiva's dance, then, Nataraja himself emerges in textual and visual form about the beginning of the tenth century. The earliest surviving ex- amples I have found that can be dated with reasonable confidence are four reliefs carved on the exterior stone surfaces of the Sadaiyar temple at Tiruchchenampundi, ca. 920 (Fig. 7), the Naltunai Ishvara temple at Punjai, ca. 940 (Fig. 8), the Gomuktishvara temple at Tiruvaduturai, 932-45 (Fig. 9), and the Pipileshvara temple at Tiruverumbur, ca. 952 (Fig. 10).19 These reliefs possess the basic components of Nataraja iconography, but something tentative about them suggests an image type new to architectural ornament. For one thing, they are relatively uncommon, as only four reliefs were carved in the more than one hundred small, granite temples built in the Kaveri region during the tenth century. And these four reliefs differ in small details from the features that become canonical in Nataraja images by the late tenth century. The Ganga figure is missing from Shiva's hair in all four reliefs. No dwarf lies under Shiva's foot at Tiruvaduturai or Punjai (Figs. 8, 9). All four reliefs, furthermore, received the treatment of minor figures, set high on the temple wall where their diminutive scale and in most cases shallow relief make them difficult to see. Located in elaborate floriated arches (makara- torana) that crown niches for larger sculptures of other gods, these four reliefs function exegetically rather than indepen- dently, their identities and postures elaborating on the deities featured in the niches below.20 These small reliefs do not yet present Nataraja as a deity well known or well established in the Kaveri region. The aerial perspective from which the dwarf is rendered at Tiruchchenampundi (Fig. 7) implies that this relief was an early experiment in translating a freestanding icon into a shallow relief. Here, in the earliest known surviving represen- tation of Nataraja, traces of such a model's three-dimensional- ity seem still fresh. The prone dwarf lies circumscribed by a rectangle, the dance platform tipped forward to parallel the relief plane. In the other three reliefs, the dwarf and the platform appear in profile. In those later reliefs, Nataraja is flanked by figures playing percussion on a drum or clay pot (ghatam) and, at Tiruverumbur only, by saluting celestial attendants-all characters who seem part of the same time and space as the dancing god-whereas symmetrical arrange- ments of foliage and fantastic crocodilian creatures (makaras) isolate the Tiruchchenampundi figure in a timeless vacuum of ornament. Note that none of these flanking figures is yet identifiable as the characters who attend Nataraja's dance by about 971 at Konerirajapuram (Fig. 11): Bhringi, the danc- ing, emaciated, and sometimes three-legged male devotee; Karaikal Ammaiyar, the fanged female devotee who plays the finger cymbals and who is also emaciated; or Tillai Amman, the fleshier, multiarmed goddess who also dances. The three-dimensional model that inspired the flatter stone rendering at Tiruchchenampundi would almost cer- tainly have been made of bronze. The shapes of all Nataraja figures strongly imply that this sculptural form was originally conceived for the lost-wax method of bronze casting and copied into stone only later, and with limited success.

That the Nataraja type reached its full form in bronze before doing so in stone may be further supported by a surviving sculptural example if the bronze image of Nataraja from Karaiviram in the Tanjavur District (Fig. 1) was cast as early as 917, as some scholars maintain. That date would place this bronze before the four earliest examples of Nataraja in stone. The dating of this piece, however, is the subject of some controversy since it displays iconographic details scholars would attribute to the eleventh century.22 The strikingly beautiful Karaiviram bronze was discovered with a standing bronze image of the Goddess (Devi) that is inscribed with a date corresponding to 917 C.E. The piece stands 44 inches (114 centimeters) tall, a monument to technical confidence. The clean lines and soft flesh of Shiva Nataraja's limbs capture the sublime dancer's balance between strength and relaxation. R. Nagaswamy sees the Nataraja and consort as stylistically contemporary,23 and I see in the male figure the relaxed surfaces and fluid contours that also characterize stone sculpture from the ninth and early tenth centuries at, for example, Kodumbalur, Kumbakonam, and Tiruvedikudi.24 And yet I do not regard style as an ironclad argument: I would credit an eleventh-century artist with the skill to match the style of an earlier piece if he chose to do so. On these grounds, I think it possible that the Karaiviram Nataraja is later than its companion piece. I do not, however, find the iconographic argument compelling evidence for a later date, inconvenient though this bronze may be to the developmental chronolo- gies scholars have hypothesized so far. As those chronologies are pegged on much speculation and only a small sample of firmly datable pieces, they are no more convincing than the evidence of an inscribed companion figure. Without stronger evidence against an early date for the Karaiviram Nataraja, I am reluctant to trust any chronology for the evolution of this image type that does not at least allow for the possibility that this fully evolved Nataraja was cast in the second decade of the tenth century. Even if the Karaiviram Nataraja is a later piece, another bronze is likely to have preceded the earliest stone reliefs.</page><page sequence="8">SHIVA NATARAJA: SHIFTING MEANINGS OF AN ICON 397 I k` , ..

No such figure of that age survives in Chidambaram, and the Nataraja bronze currently under worship there, by Barrett's estima- tion, is no older than the thirteenth century.25 But Chidam- baram has been famous since the seventh-century poems of Appar for enshrining a dancing figure of Shiva instead of the abstract, cylindrical stone symbols of Shiva (linga) that serve as the central object of worship in most Shiva temples. As its earliest known stone "copy" was carved at Tiruchche- nampundi about 920, the original Chidambaram Nataraja would have been in place by then, but perhaps not for long, given the unfamiliarity with details of Nataraja's iconography registered in the early stone reliefs. At any rate, the form seems to have been new to stone. Bronze "copies," such as perhaps the Karaiviram bronze, probably reprised the Chidam- baram icon more precisely and slightly earlier, being of the same material as the original icon. The songs of traveling hymnists like Appar would have acquainted audiences outside Chidambaram with its anthropomorphic, dancing god, allow- ing such copies in bronze and stone to evoke his cultic home explicitly for such viewers. I am suggesting, then, that Nata- raja images throughout the Tamil country were intended to function as deliberate recapitulations of the original cult icon at Chidambaram. Locating Nataraja: Chidambaram Since his genesis around the year 900 in sculpture and song, Nataraja has been associated with Chidambaram, now a large town 152 miles (244 kilometers) south of Chennai (formerly called Madras) near India's east coast (Fig. 4). The faithful understand Nataraja as a living entity and Chidambaram as the home in which he physically resides.26 Chidambaram's temple complex (Fig. 13) now covers some fifty-five acres. The specific structure in which Nataraja dwells, in his bronze sculptural form, lies within the innermost enclosure wall of this complex and is called the Hall of Consciousness, the chid-sabha (Fig. 14). By the seventh century the hymnists Appar, Sambandar, Sundarar, and Manikkavasagar had sung of Chidambaram's already ancient sanctity.27 They called the site Tillai and Puliyur ("Town of the Tiger" in Tamil), for the legendary hazards of the place, a forest of poison-sapped tillai trees and a fierce tiger that roamed the precinct. These devotional poems also indicate that multiple deities were worshiped there. Some songs mention a hall to Vishnu there by the eighth century.28 Legends about a goddess of Tillai and a sacred pond may also be quite old.29 The structures of the Chidambaram complex also indicate that this place has served as home to other deities for at least as long as it has for Nataraja.30 Sharing the most sacred space of the inner compound with Nataraja's chid-sabha is a shrine for Vishnu as the cowherd Krishna (also called Vishnu-</page><page sequence="9">398 ART BUll.ETIN SEPTEMBER 1999 VOIUME LXXXI NUMBER 3 ?? ..+~ !~tlp? j i ~` .J r% -~C?r~ -?U4~~ --I~ ~`?~;~ 3 L 10 Shiva Nataraja with Musicians and Celestial Attendants, granite, in a roundel above the lintel of an ornamental crowning arch, south wall of the Pipileshvara temple, Tiruverumbur, ca. 952 Govindaraja) and a shrine beside the chid-sabha's west wall that some associate with the god Brahma or with Shiva's deified follower Chandesha (Fig. 15).31 Nataraja even shares the space inside the chid-sabha with his "lovely wife" (the goddess Shivakamasundari) and with a composite image of Shiva's linga and face (mukhalinga), through which present- day ritual invokes Brahma's fifth head, which Shiva cut off when he took the form of Bhairava.32 A sculpture of Bhairava is also housed in the chid-sabha. A second structure called the kanaka-sabha, in which Shiva is worshiped as a crystal linga, mirrors the chid-sabha, standing just south of it, facing its doorway, sharing its basic shape and stone platform, and enfolding its lower steps.33 Just outside the innermost pre- cinct wall (prakara) is the "dance hall" (nritta-sabha). This houses an image of the Goddess and one of Shiva dancing with his leg raised straight in the air (the pose is called urdhva-janu, "erect leg"). In this second enclosure is another shrine where Shiva is worshiped in his linga form. North of the second enclosure wall is a large, stepped tank named Shivaganga after the heavenly river Ganga and Shiva, who helped bring her to earth (Fig. 13).34 Facing this tank from the west is a large structure dedicated to the goddess in her form as Shiva's lovely wife (Shivakamasundari). The temple's history of housing multiple cults and its series of expansion and renovation projects have produced a complicated ground plan in which many structures now lie among four rectangular and roughly concentric enclosure walls. The temple compound awaits a comprehensive art historical study,35 but research to date suggests that the temple was originally approached from the south; that the earliest structures once stood at what is now the center of the complex; and that renovation projects in the late eleventh and thirteenth centuries expanded the campus to at least half its present size.36 Patrons added further to the complex during the Vijayanagara period (1370-1660), probably includ- ing a precursor of the Govindaraja shrine in the innermost courtyard. The outermost enclosure wall may have been added as well;37 the space between this and the third enclo- sure wall has remained a green, cultivated area, in contrast with the inner three courtyards, which are crowded with buildings. Most of those buildings have been substantially renovated, particularly since 1660. None of those now extant is older than 1070, but some of them probably replicate features of earlier buildings they have replaced. The chid-sabha's distinc- tive shape, materials, and southern orientation suggest that its design has been informed by much older structures.38 Most temples built in the Tamil region during the ninth and tenth centuries open to the east, or in a few cases to the west, and almost all house the central image in a cubical shrine approached along an east-west axis through a sequence of connected rooms. At those temples a tiered, pyramidal structure of stone or brick rises above the central shrine and is crowned by a single vase-shaped finial. Chidambaram's chid- sabha, by contrast, opens to the south, and appears always to have done so." 3The shrine is oblong in plan, with nine finials</page><page sequence="10">SII\'VA NATARAJA: SIIIFTING MEANINGS OF AN ICON 399 ?t~l 7?? ;k ~t?r, t .. ~.-? rS' 't:?;'y .. ? q ii r !'r .,i ?-? ?-; '? ~ A ~ Il '1 ~d~ef?rO ; L d ?r ?' s\ ~ -C~d? ?r 'r '?

With this wooden skeleton and its humped roof (which imitates thatch), the chid-sabha would already have looked distinctly archaic by the ninth century. Its ancient appearance would have comple- mented nicely its reputation as an ancient site for the worship of Shiva. A mural in King Rajaraja I Chola's temple, the Rajarajesh- vara in Tanjavur, demonstrates that by 1010, when that temple was consecrated, the chid-sabha at Chidambaram already had its unusual shape (Figs. 18, 19). This dry fresco, which is the earliest painting I know depicting Shiva as Nataraja, portrays him under the Chidambaram temple's distinctive humped and golden roof (compare Figs. 18 and 14). The mural even captures the slightly flared eaves and the roof's fine vertical striations. The mural includes a man and three women worshiping Nataraja from under a similar though slightly lower roof (Fig. 19), indicating that the subordinate kanaka-</page><page sequence="11">400 ART BUIILLETIN SEPTEMBER 1999 VOLUME LXXXI NUMBER 3 fourth enclosure wall = j I third enclosure wall North Gopura Shivaganga Tank Shivakamasundari Temple d~ East Gopura chid-sabhha West Gopura nritta-sabha =outh Gopura Sout~h Gopura 13 Ground plan of all four enclosures at Shiva Nataraja's temple complex in Chidambaram (graphic design:Julia Meyerson) sabha existed by 1010, facing as it does now the chid-sabha's entrance and serving as the ideal point from which to view Nataraja's dance. In addition, the Tanjavur mural shows that by 1010 these two structures were already oriented as they are now and that the chid-sabha already opened to the south. In the painting, the kanaka-sabha is to the right of the chid-sabha, which is how they would now appear if one were to see them from the west. Tanjavur lies mostly to the west of Chidambaram, and the mural is on an east-facing wall.43 The mural thus psychologi- cally transports viewers in Tanjavur eastward along the direc- tion of their gaze, across the intervening 60-odd miles (100 kilometers), and into the presence of Nataraja's Chidam- baram home.44 The mural was, then, a visual formulation of a psychic proximity between this Chola capital and Nataraja's home. The priests of Nataraja's home, Chidambaram, claim an ancient and distinctive tradition.

Among these practices is the study of the Vedas, exalted sacred Sanskrit texts denied at other temples to priests who perform temple rituals, a practice that is perceived to degrade the priest. Elsewhere, such priests study instead the Tamil Agama texts. The Chidambaram priests' study of the Vedas thus can be viewed as a claim for special authority based in part on their ancient presence in that place.47 Shiva as the Lord of Destruction One of the best reasons for reconsidering Coomaraswamy's reading of Nataraja images is that other options for reading these sculptures existed in the semiotic environment in which those images were first produced. The iconographic compo- nents of Nataraja images need not have borne the lofty philosophical meanings Coomaraswamy assigned to them because alternative associations were common and perhaps more obvious to the designers of this image type. By the tenth century a number of Nataraja's signs were already present on other sculptures of Shiva, and there these signs suggest Shiva's associations with death, cremation, and the destructive part of the cosmic cycle. Shiva's powers to create and enlighten, which balance his destructive (or tamasic) aspect in Coomaraswamy's interpretation, are not so apparent in these earlier representations. They seem to have more in common with the Tamil and Sanskrit texts of approximately the same period, which describe Shiva wander- ing through cremation grounds like a madman, laughing, weeping, and dancing in ecstasy, surrounded by goblins, his body smeared with ashes from the funeral pyre and orna- mented with the bones of the dead.48 Take, for example, the cobras that adorn Nataraja's body and the skull in his hair. 49Though these items may also mark forms of Shiva that are salvific, such as those breaking the fall of the heavenly river Ganga (Gangadhara, Fig. 20), they appear to receive special emphasis on wrathful forms of Shiva and the Goddess. On the colossal, three-faced bust of Shiva in his cave-temple at Elephanta, for example, prominent cobras and a skull distinguish the enraged face of Shiva as Aghora at the left from the tranquil faces of Shiva's other natures.50 At Elephanta and elsewhere, skulls joined with other human bones in long garlands adorn Shiva's torso when he destroys the demon Andhaka or cuts off the god Brahma's fifth head.51 Similar garlands ornament the cadaverous goddess Chamunda as she hungers for sacrifice52 and the goddess Nishumbhasu- dani as she crushes two demons beneath her loins.53 Caught up in the frenzy of punishing evil, these avenging figures often pose with one leg bent deeply and their multiple</page><page sequence="13">402 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 1999 VOLUME I XXXI NUMBER 3 .. I t .Ae.RK, WM R 16 Draupadi Ratha, rock-cut granite monolith, shrine to Durga in Mamallapuram, 7th century arms fanning out in an explosion of energy. The same features are part of Nataraja's visual form. In the language of Indic dance both then and now, deep flexions of the joints realize the somatic ideals of supple dynamism and perfect control. Through radiating arms, these bodies articulate a clean circle, one of the orderly geometries into which Indic dance shapes the human body. Deities can realize these ideals with a mighty grace far beyond human capabilities. Nataraja's lifted leg may also have reinvoked the tamasic theme of snakes. The Sanskrit name for this position, in which the foot rises from the ground but not above the knee of the same leg, is bhujangatrasita, which means "frightened by a snake.""54 In the earliest known depiction of this posture, a seventh-century relief at Siyamangalam, Shiva lifts his leg thus above a cobra coiled to strike him.55 Although no snake is visible on the ground in most later representations of Nata- raja, the lifted leg may be a remnant of the serpentine presence in earlier icons. Taken together, these elements could have evoked Shiva's wild dance at the cremation ground. The drum Nataraja holds in his upper right hand could beat the rhythm of that horrific dance.56 The cobras encircling Nataraja's arms and waist as livingjewelry, and perhaps also suggested by his lifted leg, are lethal vermin that haunt deserted places. The flames embracing the entire composition and the smaller flame in his upper left hand could allude to the funeral pyre. The skull in his matted locks of hair could be a bony remnant from that pyre. (Larger bones can survive the crematory fire.) Another reason to suspect that Nataraja's shape once spoke of death, cremation, and torn bodies lies in the early history of the Chidambaram temple's layout. Younger mentions a local legend of that place identifying the area just south of Nataraja's chid-sabha as a cremation ground. Looking out of that shrine, then, Chidambaram's Shiva would have presided over that realm of death.57 Coomaraswamy himself had sensed a "historical connec- tion between Shiva's gracious dance (ananda-tandava), and his wild dance as the demon of the cemetery,"58 which he perceived in dancing forms of Shiva carved at Ellora, Ele- phanta, and Bhubaneshwar, composed two or three centuries before the genesis of the Nataraja icon. He overstated the sculptural evidence for this, however, in asserting that these reliefs set Shiva's dance "in cemeteries and burning grounds," where he is "accompanied by troops of capering imps.""' Much as I would like to find early sculptural evidence linking Shiva's dance so clearly to the charnel ground, I can find in these and other early scenes of Shiva's dance little such evidence beyond the inferences I draw above from Shiva's snakes and drum.60 The dwarfs (gana), the Goddess, and the '.r r?':J iPj~bf :';?? tlil~?? ~J? ~fc: ~~D~jr a 6: I ?" r.:t u;P: `!ii tA ?c, ?c~ ii: ?~ '~? ~? !cr .e ~i h. ?51 iiB ?Z'c' Sk: i h?, '"" c, 1~ ii. ~Fc".?, ,, .u I , II ??' ;1&amp;)0; 17 Lintel and pilaster motif and the triple niches of an ardhamandapa funded by Sembiyan Mahadevi, south wall, Apatsahayeshvara temple, Aduturai, ca. 985</page><page sequence="14">SHIVA NATARAJA: SHIFTIN(; MEANINGS OF AN I(()ON 403 L4 ?~-~s C PL~-~ii~~ d '~ ~ Lr I ~F i??vc!:e 1? c?

The seated musicians in these early reliefs fix only the associations with dance. A small, emaciated dancing figure is present at some of these early reliefs, and Coomaraswamy may have taken him for one of the starving demons (pishacha) who accompany Shiva's wrathful Bhairava manifestation and who haunt the cremation ground in search of human flesh. Such demons accompany Bhairava and Chamunda, wrathful manifestations of Shiva and the Goddess.61' When this emaciated figure appears beneath Nataraja's raised foot in reliefs at Koneriraja- puram about 970 and Gangaikondacholapuram in the mid- eleventh century (Fig. 12), he has been understood as Bhringi, a passionate devotee whose exclusive attentions to Shiva earned him the Goddess's jealousy and her curse that he lose his flesh."2 Perhaps such figures were intended to represent starving ghosts at Sirpur, Ellora, Elephanta, Mukhalingam, and Kundaveli,63 and thus inspired the story of Bhringi and later the story of Karaikal Ammaiyar, the emaci- ated female devotee who accompanies Nataraja's dance on her finger cymbals.64 But this possibility is slim evidence on</page><page sequence="15">404 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 1999 VOLUME LXXXI NUMBER 3 Ir' .3 r- s cr i; ~C I; :e i. ?l?iz~Y ' ' C I )? ,*? i ?

Other scholars have remarked on the traces of a fierce, destructive, and ancient deity lingering in sculpted forms of Shiva's dance. The most convincing is David Smith, who perceives the mystic dancer Nataraja to be strongly associated with Bhairava, a tamasic aspect of Shiva, and speculates that the former somehow evolved from the latter.65 At the same time, Smith offers a compelling rereading of the dwarf under Nataraja's foot, arguing that early viewers may have understood this figure not as the vanquished foe Apasmara (the demon personifying ignorance, according to Coomaraswamy) but as an assistant to Shiva's dance. Smith notes that the Chidambaramahatmya, the legend book com- posed by temple priests at Nataraja's cultic home between the tenth and twelfth centuries, refers to Apasmara as a dwarf (bhuta) rather than a demon. At the center of Nataraja's cult, in other words, and during the first centuries of the icon's existence, the deity's guardians appear to have construed the dwarf as benign. The notion that Shiva is instead trampling the dwarf may have entered the understanding of Nataraja imagery sometime after the icon's genesis, Smith suggests, perhaps as this icon became conflated with representations of Shiva overcoming the fiercely demonic Ravana by pressing down on him with his foot. The latter theme was already present in the poetry of the seventh and eighth centuries.66 The dwarf fits easily into a long visual tradition as well. Stubby, plump, even antic dwarfs, or Shiva-gana, attend Shiva on many monuments and serve as visual foils to the tall, lean, and majestic god (Fig. 21). Sculptures of Nataraja contrast them further through their postures: the dwarf's horizontal and sprawling, Shiva's vertical and elegant. That dwarfs supported Shiva by sitting or lying beneath him was a well-established motif in the Tamil region, specifically, before 900. In a seventh-century relief in Tiruchirapalli (Fig. 20), a fat gana sits beneath the foot of Shiva Gangadhara, which he raises up with his own short arms. At Kalugumalai, an eighth-century stone figure of Shiva as the teacher Dakshina- murti rests his pendant foot on the back of a dwarf who is clearly crouching helpfully and not sprawling in defeat. The dwarf again seems to act the ally rather than the enemy on the facade of an eighth- or ninth-century rock-cut temple at Vilinjam. Here, while destroying the three aerial cities of the demons (as Shiva Tripurantaka), Shiva rests his toe lightly on the head of a seated dwarf. And beneath dancing figures of Shiva in north India as well as in the Tamil region, the attendant who embodies faithful devotion, Shiva's bull Nandi, appears in similarly supportive postures.67 That several components of Nataraja's form were present on earlier reliefs suggests that the new form may have initially carried old meanings. Since the icon's new shape was capable of participating in an existing conversation, as it were, it did not immediately require new myths. That a number of those redeployed components carried connotations of Shiva's dance in his tamasic state suggests that the artisans and perhaps priests who first designed this icon meant it to represent an aspect for which Shiva was already famous at Chidambaram: the Dancing Lord of the Charnel Ground. The Cholas The Chola dynasty's roots may be as old as the triple kingship (muvendar) of the Sangam age in the early centuries of the common era. The early Chola kings, by whom I mean those descended from Vijayalaya Chola (r. ca. 850-71) and preced- ing Rajaraja I Chola (r. 985-1014), valued this ancient genealogical connection highly.68 Their earliest homes and the centers of Chola authority lay around their capitals along the Kaveri River at Tanjavur, Uraiyur (now in Tiruchirapalli), and Palaiyarai (near modern Kumbakonam). From the late ninth century, the Cholas persistently extended their influ- ence beyond that core region, seeking plunder, seeking to prove themselves as universal rulers, and seeking to control the lucrative maritime trade between southeast Asia and points west of India.69 The Cholas played an increasingly dominant role in south Indian politics by the eleventh century, the height of their dynasty's power, when Chola kings claimed hegemony from the southern tip of the subcontinent</page><page sequence="16">SIIVA NATARAJA: SHIF'TIN(; MEANINGS OF AN ICON 405 ~r .~ JT -~~L~~1JI~-.: A :dr~.L.r: Ii 'r ~+L-~u `~~ .L1 c~ r-, ~t~ Yt ~.~i ~??r-?i; IIIIL-SC~l~~i.~;Llc~-? -"' U C ~5;~*) L? :3 ~' c c.

They even professed, rhetorically it seems, to have conquered as far north as the Ganges River and as far east as Sumatra.70 During the eleventh and twelfth centuries, Chola kings may have managed their expanding kingdom through a system of "incorporative" kingship, in which they shared sovereignty with subregional leaders they assimilated as subordinate chieftains.71 Even the most powerful Chola kings experienced limits on their authority.72 Their influence lay more in their ability to secure the allegiances of populations than in their outright ownership of the land or its fruits. Negotiations with temples, brahmins, and others popularly recognized as guardians of the sacred were essential to the kings' legitimacy, as were public ceremonies and royal rhetoric. The early Cholas were particularly restricted in their options for dominating the web of ancient networks that had for centuries structured affairs throughout the Kaveri region's relatively autonomous locali- ties called nadu. Before the end of the tenth century, authority in the Kaveri region appears to have been exercised largely at the local level. Especially during the early years of the Chola dynasty, local governments exercised principal control over taxation, arbitration, irrigation, and cultivation rights and temple affairs.73 Early Chola kings expanded their domain through military aggression against neighboring rulers, practicing a style of kingship that emphasized martial heroism and genealogical descent from illustrious warriors more than it stressed acts of conspicuous generosity.74 The few temple projects early Chola kings undertook reflect those martial values and scarce resources cannily invested to yield maximum publicity.75 Affiliating with Chidambaram provided an opportunity for such targeted giving, because even modest gifts to that ancient temple north of the Kaveri delta could carry the Chola name beyond the dynastic homeland, as it put the weight of Chidambaram's ancient sacredness behind the Cholas' legitimacy. Chidambaram had a prior reputation for affiliation with royalty, which may have further encouraged the support of Chola kings. Well before the tenth century, myths had stressed the authority of kings and the sacredness of this place by associating them with each other. In Chidambaram's stories about Pallava kings (who ruled the northern Tamil plain from the sixth to ninth centuries) and ancient Chola kings, the temple's ancient sanctity affirmed the king's legiti- macy and guaranteed his financial base; the king reinvested some of his wealth in the temple and his military power protected the temple.76 As the Dancing Lord of the Charnel Ground, Chidam- baram's original icon could have played a role in enticing Chola kings into affiliation. Though art historians debate whether Nataraja's form depicts a flexed pirouette or a sustained lift,77 the figure is clearly dancing, and in the Tamil region the theme of dance had ancient associations with war and victory. Zvelebil notes that in the earliest Tamil literature Kotravai, the Tamil goddess of war, dances exultantly amid the carnage of the battlefield; he suggests that Nataraja's lifted leg derives from the victorious leaping dances ancient Tamil warrior chieftains would perform to Kotravai and Mayon, god of the cowherds, over the bodies of their enemies slain on the field of battle.78 In the Cilappatikaram, a Tamil epic poem composed about 450 C.E., Shiva dances to celebrate his destruction of the three cities of the demons.79 Nataraja's dancing posture could thus have evoked the successful warrior, and as that role remained one of the highest ideals of early Chola kingship, the evocation cast Nataraja as an inviting emblem for Chola aspirations. Genesis of the Nataraja Cult at Chidambaram During the tenth century, according to Kulke, the priests of Chidambaram (then still known as Tillai) began to reframe the religious identity of this long-sacred place with the intention of transforming an isolated local religious tradition into a pan-Indic one that could draw pilgrims from distant places, award its deity more extensive fame, and bring the town spiritual prestige, commercial wealth, and broader regional impact. Kulke finds that similar transformations, or "Sanskritization," occurred at temples across medieval India. Among the transformations at Tillai were the genesis of new Sanskrit names for the town itself and a mythic identity for the Nataraja icon that simultaneously linked him to other forms</page><page sequence="17">406 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 1999 VOLUME LXXXI NUMBER 3 of Shiva known across India through Sanskrit texts (puranas) and distanced him from local, wrathful deities. Kulke suggests that the Chola kings' selection of Tillai's dancing god for their emblem catalyzed these revisions.80 A major vehicle for these revisions was the Chidambaramahat- mya, a priestly redaction of old and new stories designed to present Chidambaram as a worthy destination for pilgrims.81 Many South Indian temples had mahatmyas, in oral and sometimes written form, which constructed a temple's history and traditions out of local legends, historical events, and appropriated myths, edited and reframed to serve the contem- porary interests of its compilers. Much of the Chidambarama- hatmya was written down about the twelfth century, but portions of it had been composed over the preceding two centuries or more.82 The Chidambaramahatmya adapted the older and more widely known Myth of the Pine Forest to suit the chid-sabha's Nataraja icon. This story entered the Patanjali section of the text probably during the tenth century and, in Kulke's view, is the earliest textual reference to Nataraja's dance in its fully canonic form.83 According to the Chidambaramahatmya's recen- sion of this myth, Shiva visited sages, or rishis, living in a pine forest to punish them for the inadequacies of their devotions. He came as the naked, handsome beggar Bhikshatana, dancing, laughing, and making himself sexually irresistible to the sages' wives. He brought with him Vishnu in his seductive female form, Mohini, who drove the sages to distraction. Perceiving that Bhikshatana had thus humiliated them, the sages pelted him with weapons: a tiger, a skull, a drum, snakes, fire, and Apasmara, the demon of ignorance. Shiva easily overcame all these threats, turning them into trophies to adorn his body or to dance over in fierce joy. His dance took on cosmic dimensions, drawing into itself all of creation. The sight of his beautiful, awesome dance enlightened the sages. At Shiva's urging, the sages worshiped him in his aniconic (or abstract) columnar form, the linga.84 The Chidambaramahatmya thus attaches a mythological explanation, as it were, to Nataraja images, adapting them both to a narrative of conquest, supremacy, and absorption. The Myth of the Pine Forest rationalizes Nataraja's icono- graphic markers as the sages' futile threats: the skull in his hair, the snakes around his arm and in his hair, and the dwarf under his foot. Fine stripes incised in the little garment around Shiva's hips depict the remnants of the attacking tiger. Shiva catches the fire calmly in his hand and permits it to envelop his entire body as the aureole. He uses the drum to beat the rhythm of his victory dance. In all these ways, he safely absorbs their weapons into his body and meets the sages' challenges in unruffled triumph. This new story could distance Shiva's dance from the cremation ground, transmuting what may have been a dance about death into a dance about triumph. And yet Shiva remained energetic and aggressive, still not quite the tranquil deliverer to be found in thirteenth-century texts. Perhaps the sharpness of that contrast was what deflected Coomaraswa- my's attention from the significance of the Pine Forest legend, which, he concluded, had "after all, no very close connection with the real meaning of the dance."85 I would agree instead with Zvelebil and Kulke that this myth played a significant part in transforming the meaning of the Nataraja icon. This myth made that icon an emblem worthy of kings, with greater emphasis on his royal qualities than Tillai's earlier literary versions of Shiva had displayed. The objects surrounding Nataraja became potential threats, triumphantly overcome. By dancing with these trophies, he exhibited an easy confidence in his ability to meet the angry sages and their weapons, which Zvelebil reads as emblems of rival Tillai deities.86 In this way, Nataraja's achievements paralleled the tasks that lay before early kings of the Chola dynasty: the subjugation of rival kings and the establishment of a geo- graphic and psychic center for the vast dominion they aspired to claim. In royal as well as cultic terms, Nataraja could serve as a god of conquest, brandishing his challengers' failed weapons much as kings would exhibit regalia they had looted from their defeated rivals.87 Kulke identifies other transformations effected in the Chidambaramahatmya that would have enhanced this temple's attractiveness to pilgrims and royal patrons. Sanskritization of local place names made them easier for outsiders to recognize and approach. This text presents Chidambaram as a new name for Tillai-Puliyur. Chidambaram, a Sanskrit term mean- ing "the heavenly abode of the Spirit," replaced the similar- sounding Tamil word citrambalam, meaning "little hall," a term that had for some time labeled one of the early structures in that complex.88 That text gave Tillai yet another Sanskritizing name by interpolating the character Vyaghrapada into Nataraja's story. A minor character from the Sanskrit Mahabharata epic, Vyaghrapada enters the Chidambaramahatmya when he comes to the tillai forest to practice asceticism. He prays for tigers' feet so that he may climb trees and harvest their best flowers for Shiva. Those feet give him his name, Vyaghrapada, which means "tiger foot" in Sanskrit; his name gives the place a new name, Vyaghrapura, Sanskrit for "town of the tiger." Vyagh- rapura was, then, a Sanskrit translation of the Tamil name Puliyur. The name Vyaghrapura also integrated the town into the sacred geography of the Mahabharata, through its associa- tions with a character from that epic. A descriptive local term thus became a link to a pan-Indic legend.89 The prominence of tigers in Tillai's reputation-as an ancient totem, as a weapon of the sages, and as the garment around Nataraja's hips-may have enhanced Chola interest in this place. The tiger had been a Chola emblem for as long as anyone could remember. It adorned the flags, coins, and the royal seal of the Chola kings.90 The Chidambaramahatmya further described the ancient temple town as a center for widespread pilgrimage by defin- ing Chidambaram as the center of the universe and of every human heart, and as the only site at which Nataraja would perform his beatific ananda-tandava dance. Vyaghrapada and another sage, Patanjali, resided in Tillai yearning to see this dance, which would fulfill the spirit of all who witnessed it. Nataraja agreed to perform the dance there and only there for eternity. This story constructed Tillai-Chidambaram as the center of all devout concentration, the core of the psychically perceived universe, integral to the world around it. This devotional philosophy asserted a universal significance for the town and its new god, as well as for the priests and kings who protected his temple. When Shiva answered Vyaghrapada's request to perform</page><page sequence="18">SHIVA NATARAJA: SHIFTING MEANINGS OF AN ICON 407 the ananda-tandava dance in Tillai, the goddess who already reigned there, Tillai Amman, resented the encroachment on her precincts and challenged Shiva to compete through dance for spiritual hegemony over that place. Shiva defeated her by taking up the raised leg (urdhva-janu) pose that embarrassed the virginal goddess and that modesty forbade her to take up herself. In defeat, she was bifurcated. In her fierce, virginal aspect she ceded the Tillai grove to Shiva, withdrawing to a shrine outside the walls of her former temple, while her benign aspect was domesticated to the role of Shiva's wife and housed in the chid-sabha, where she still watches in adoration his performance of the ananda-tandava dance. This segment of the Chidambaramahatmya narrative exposes the theme of competition among deities, a recurrent theme at Chidambaram and one surely stimulated by the long tradition at that site of multiple deities in worship side by side.91 Shulman notes that the Chidambaram version of the Dance Contest story subjugated the goddess with special force. Shulman argues that the narrative fate of Tillai Amman articulated a broader tension between Tamil religious ideals and those of the Sanskritic tradition of the Upanishad texts. Tillai Amman represented Tamil mythology's preference for highly localized, distinctive deities and for mythic action that tied them to particular places in the Tamil countryside. In opposition to this stood an Upanishadic search for universal truths, for cosmic rather than local geography, and for an all-encompassing deity who could embody multiple selves within a unified, supreme whole. Shiva could embody Upani- shadic ideals more readily once the marginality and violence with which he was associated transferred to Tillai Amman; in defeating her, he exiled those "primitive" characteristics beyond the sacred precinct.92 This literary transformation of Tillai's deity may have mirrored a comparable shift in the reception of the temple's bronze icon as well. That icon's wild dance and fire may have suggested the marginality and violence of older Tamil deities. The Chidambaram versions of the myths of the Pine Forest and the Dance Contest could then have neutralized these associations. The Myth of the Pine Forest cast the fire and the dance as part of Shiva's calm response to the threats of foolish sages, and it identified Chidambaram's god as a later form of the more widely known Bhikshatana. The story of the Dance Contest then aligned Bhikshatana/Nataraja against the an- cient Tamil goddess of the locality and credited him with exiling her from the sacred precinct. The incorporation of Tillai Amman into Nataraja's story could also have strengthened Chola identification with Nata- raja. As a fierce goddess of local and ancient fame, Tillai Amman shared several features with the goddess Nishumbha- sudani, possibly the favored deity of Vijayalaya Chola, the earliest known king of his line who ruled during the third quarter of the ninth century. If Nagaswamy's identification of Vijayalaya's goddess is correct, both goddesses were powerful and wild, and aspects of their appearance were horrific. Both goddesses had eight arms and in one of these wielded the trident.93 Vijayalaya's descendants' ambitions to expand be- yond the geographic confines of his small kingdom may have encouraged them to identify with a god-Nataraja-who had domesticated and overcome a goddess much like the one associated with his still-localized scope of kingship. The placement of structures at Chidambaram implies that an interaction between a dancing male god and a goddess may have been an early part of religious practice there. A goddess shrine, the nritta-sabha, stands just south of Nataraja's chid-sabha and kanaka-sabha and opens toward them. Younger argues that in eleventh-century inscriptions the Tamil name for the nritta-sabha was "the opposite hall" (etirampalam), stressing the significance of its juxtaposition with the chid- sabha.94 This would suggest that the innermost precinct wall, which now cuts between the nritta-sabha and the chid-sabha, was introduced deliberately to establish Nataraja's indepen- dent significance by disguising an earlier architectural dia- logue between his shrine and this goddess shrine. Spatial relations at the temple also imply the bifurcation of a defeated goddess. Shivakamasundari, the adoring, pretty wife, appears inside the chid-sabha with Nataraja, while an eight-armed goddess bearing a trident stands in the nritta- sabha beside an image of Shiva who dances in the raised-leg posture through which he defeated Tillai Amman in the dance contest. These divergent halves of the goddess also appear to have been later manifest through larger structures: the Shivakamasundari temple, which lies within the walls of the temple complex (Fig. 13), and the Kali temple, which lies outside the temple walls at the city's northern edge.95 Thus, Nataraja is in Chidambaram's literature embedded in myths that transform him, Tillai, and its legends, and set him atop a hierarchy among its multiple deities. Those revisions displaced or transformed local deities, or integrated them into pan-Indic mythologies. Traces of those revisions may be still visible in the Chidambaram temple complex. In their redesigned forms, these deities constructed Nataraja as a more appropriate emblem for royal patrons. Nataraja as a Chola Emblem This strategy may have played a role in forging the strong bonds that would connect Chidambaram and the Cholas from the eleventh to thirteenth centuries. Whatever the causes, those bonds clearly existed by the reign of Rajaraja I Chola (r. 985-1014), and images of Nataraja constituted one language through which Rajaraja expressed that affiliation. I propose that the Chola queen Sembiyan Mahadevi was Rajaraja's predecessor in deploying the Nataraja image as a Chola emblem. The dozen temples she had built between 970 and the early eleventh century were the first to feature Nataraja in full-scale wall niches. Their geographic distribu- tion across the deltaic region the Cholas aspired to dominate suggests that one important function of her temples was to expand the fame of the Chola dynasty in the localities. I see the prominent Nataraja sculptures on their walls as playing a role in that expansion and in the innovative iconographic programs her temples introduce.96 In proposing a political role for this group of Nataraja images, I share the theoretical orientations of Kulke, Nicholas Dirks, and Arjun Appadurai, as well as their conviction that kings and temples were closely connected during much of India's history.97 As those two institutions produced much of the art surviving from medieval times, interconnections</page><page sequence="19">408 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 1999 VOLUME LXXXI NUMBER 3 r r rcl ~j~.~ t :? ?F ?:~a +: ~ y? y ~~ ~~L~GC,~ .I'S"? 1? r W~~ .? *1, d-L ryh ~~ i~T~-~ ?~. -?- ?- ?-?1 -? ?. ,: ;, bhS ( ?; rK?~ ?c- r ~ r;? ?P ?u + ~1M~~CrC~s7s~-c, ?

The deity is thus ensconced close to the temple's sacred center, against the very wall that encloses the stone linga in which rituals would incarnate Shiva himself. The distinctive humped, golden roof over him and the similar but slightly lower roof over his royal devotees locate the scene unambiguously at Chidambaram. If, as most scholars suspect, the male figure represents Rajaraja himself,1'0 the painting fixes him in eternal worship of Nataraja and demonstrates that Rajaraja had chosen Nataraja as his favored, personal deity.'102 According to inscriptions at this temple that refer to him as Adavallan, Nataraja seems also to have been represented as a large, four-foot-high bronze (Fig. 3) inside the temple where he reigned as chief deity.10s The temple's inscriptions further reveal that Rajaraja adopted Adavallan as the name for the weight unit by which gifts to the temple were measured, another gesture from which several scholars infer Rajaraja's intense devotion to that god.104 A stone rendering of Nataraja appears in a niche on the south wall of the vimana, the cubic section of the temple that houses the temple's central icon (Fig. 22). Then there is the widespread emphasis on dance throughout the temple: the sculptural enumeration of most of the 108 dance positions in the ambulatory of the vimana's upper story; the dedication of 400 dancing girls to serve at this temple; and the image of Shiva dancing with both feet planted at the center of the vimana's west wall, a location in which earlier temples of the region placed Vishnu or forms of Shiva that are not dancing.105 Rajaraja's declarations of devotion to Nataraja were unprec- edented in their scale, but earlier Cholas had acknowledged this deity. Gandaraditya Chola (r. 949-58) had composed a hymn to the dancing god of Tillai.o06 I would argue that his wife's prodigious sponsorship of temple construction also participated in the Cholas' pronouncements of loyalty to Nataraja. Queen Sembiyan Mahadevi became the first Chola to invest heavily in the construction of temples, and on each of the twelve temples attributable to her patronage, Nataraja appeared for the first time as a full-scale sculpted image, carved essentially in the round and housed in his own framed niche (Figs. 11, 2). In her 981 temple in Sembiyan Mahadevi village, he dominated that wall by occupying its central niche. In the same year, the iconography of these sculptures achieved the form that would persist for Nataraja images: the mermaid- like figure of Ganga, which at her earlier temples (built in the 970s) was missing or on Shiva's left side, consistently took up her standard place on his right side.107 Sembiyan Mahadevi's inscriptions on these temples, the rituals they prescribed, and the many gifts she continued to lavish on the enshrined deities guaranteed that residents in the localities where she built her temples would associate her temples with the Cholas.s 08Nadu residents would also have recognized the Nataraja figures as references to Chidam- baram thanks to the poets Appar, Sundarar, and Sambandar, who had sung of Tillai's dancing god and whose wanderings through the Kaveri region these towns still celebrated. Nataraja's unprecedented prominence on Sembiyan Maha- devi's temples could then have signaled to these nadu resi- dents an association between himself, Chidambaram, and the Cholas. His presence could declare the Cholas' alliance with Chidambaram, and his sculpted image could function as an emblem of the Cholas. The prominence and consistency with which Sembiyan Mahadevi's temples incorporate full-scale stone Natarajas set them apart from temples built around the same time by other patrons. Twelve of her thirteen temples (Fig. 23) 109 present Nataraja as a large figure set in its own niche on the south wall of the small vestibule (ardhamandapa) that leads to the inner shrine (vimana). (The thirteenth temple is well north, in the Tondaimandalam region, where Nataraja is absent from temples built during the second half of the tenth century by Cholas and non-Chola patrons alike.)

Five such temples retain the older pattern of having no figure of Nataraja at all and only two ardhamandapa niches. Three other temples include Nataraja as a minor figure carved into peripheral locations, continuing the practice found at Tiruverumbur, Tiruchchenampundi, Tiruvaduturai, and Punjai early in the century. At five other temples, patrons renovated older ardhamandapa by inserting new niches for Nataraja into walls that originally had only one niche each (Figs. 24, 25).110 It is tempting to see these renovations as a response to the newer paradigm Sembiyan Mahadevi was asserting. Among the temples built in the Kaveri region between 970 and 1000 by patrons other than Sembiyan Mahadevi, I know of only four that house a large figure of Nataraja in an original niche on the ardhamandapa. Of these, Tirurameshvaram and Kuhur were contemporary or later than Sembiyan Mahadevi's temples"'I and may have imitated them. Udaiyargudi, which seems also to be contemporary with Sembiyan Mahadevi's early temples,"2 is quite close to Chidambaram and could have received Nataraja imagery directly from that source. Barrett ascribes Kamarasavalli to 960,113 and thus to several years before Sembiyan Mahadevi's earliest commission. If Nataraja first appeared as a full-scale figure in its own niche at Kamarasavalli, Nataraja images would be among the many features that this queen's designers borrowed from temples built by various nadu residents, where such features had appeared sporadically over the preceding century, as they forged for Sembiyan Mahadevi's temples a newly consistent architectural canon.

A- SO- 25 Shiva Nataraja, granite, perhaps a later insertion, central niche of the ardhamandapa's south wall, Gangajatadhara temple Her temples' use of three niches on each wall of the ardhamandapa (Fig. 17), in contrast to the single niche favored at most Kaveri-region temples built before 970, recalled Chidambaram's multishrined compound with its atmosphere of interacting gods, competing through myth to forge hierarchies. The niches on Kaveri-area temples are miniature temples rendered in relief on the exterior walls. Each niche, framed by pilasters, a projecting floor platform, a crowning lintel, and ornamental superstructure, houses a representation of a deity posed frontally to receive worship. On Sembiyan Mahadevi's temples, Nataraja's niche always faces south, recalling the peculiar southward orientation of Nataraja's chid-sabha in Chidambaram. His placement is not so consistent among the earlier temples bearing small Nataraja reliefs. At Punjai Nataraja stands on the north wall over the Durga niche. On Sembiyan Mahadevi's temples, Nataraja takes up his southern position by displacing Ganesha as the dominant figure of that ardhamandapa wall, recalling Chidam- baram's dynamic of competition and displacement among juxtaposed deities. I see Bhikshatana's and Lingodbhava's prominence on Sembiyan Mahadevi's temples as deriving from their mytho- logical ties to Nataraja. Bhikshatana is Shiva's form in the Pine Forest just before he performs the ananda-tandava dance; Lingodbhava, in which Shiva manifests himself as a flaming pillar, or linga, is the form the enlightened sages worship after that dance."114 On earlier Kaveri-area temples, Lingodbhava is one of several deities that might occupy the west niche of the vimana, and Bhikshatana appears only rarely. Sembiyan Maha- devi's temples present only Lingodbhava in the western niche (Fig. 26). Bhikshatana, like Nataraja, consistently gains the status of a large, niched figure only with Sembiyan Mahadevi's buildings, where he regularly occupies one of the flanking niches of the north ardhamandapa wall (Fig. 27)."5 Youthful, handsome, and shod in the thick sandals of the wanderer, he smiles invitingly, his stance seductive in its ease.

Diminutive figures carved beside his niche represent these smitten wives, who loosen their clothing as they gaze upward at the beautiful mendicant (Figs. 27, 28). At some temples, water pots abandoned at their feet evoke the domestic responsibilities lust has driven from their minds."116 While Bhikshatana is the narrative precursor of Shiva's dance of furious bliss in Chidambaram's myths, that sequence is inverted on the walls of Sembiyan Mahadevi's temples, where worshipers encounter Nataraja near the beginning of circumambulation and Bhikshatana on the last wall they meet. One reason for that inversion may lie in a desire to engineer the viewer's experience of the temple. Whereas Nataraja's aspect is distant and awesome, absorbed in blissful frenzy, Bhikshatana reveals an irresistibly personal face. Such a progression from the remote to the enticing could draw the worshiper into a state of emotional and psychological receptiv- ity ideal for one who is about to enter the temple and experience the charged intimacy of the god's home.117 The spatial opposition between Nataraja and Bhikshatana on Sembiyan Mahadevi's temples invites one to recognize contrasts between their characters. In his languid posture and nude beauty, Bhikshatana embodies a charged sexuality outside marriage. Nataraja, who is enshrined at Chidam- baram beside his wife, turns his back on Bhikshatana at these Kaveri temples as he inspires the devotion of the ascetics Bhringi and Karaikal Ammaiyar. David Smith notes that a tension between Shiva's married and unmarried forms also permeates Chidambaram's temple complex and myth. Shiva's ananda-tandava dance celebrates the ascetic's victory over married sages, and yet Shiva receives worship in the chid-sabha as a married man."8 Smith also observes that the north and south gopura (towered gateways) at Chidambaram establish a counterpoint between Shiva's married forms (Kalyana- sundara and Somaskanda), which face north, and his unmar- ried forms (Bhikshatana and Kankala), which face south. The precise orientation of Shiva's various manifestations vary among these examples, but the opposition of north and south remains a consistent device for articulating the domesticated or independent nature of Shiva's sexuality. Nataraja, Bhikshatana, and Lingodbhava evoke Chidam- baram in yet another way on Sembiyan Mahadevi's temples. While Nataraja and Bhikshatana radiate from the temple core toward the south and north, Shiva as Lingodbhava faces to the west, and the Shiva-linga within the temple sanctum emanates toward the east through the temple entrance."19 Through this arrangement, Shiva recalls the Nataraja of the Chidambarama- hatmya, who radiates in all directions from the sacred center. Sembiyan Mahadevi's many temples propagated Nataraja's cult with an intensity that was new to the Kaveri region, but even they may not have been the first to use Nataraja icons as Chola emblems. Before 945, her father-in-law, Parantaka I Chola (r. 907-54), funded completion of the Gomuktishvara temple in Tiruvaduturai, where he may have been responsible for the small Nataraja relief discussed above (Fig. 9).120 This figure is cut in much higher relief than are the early Nataraja reliefs at Tiruchchenampundi, Tiruverumbur, and Punjai, suggesting that the god was especially important to Tiruvadu- turai's patron. It is also the only relief of the four to depict an umbrella over Nataraja's head, frequently a marker of royal status in Indian art.121 In having Nataraja carved in deep relief and on a vimana wall, Parantaka would have publicized that new god where that deity had not yet become a com-</page><page sequence="23">412 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 1999 VOLUME IXXXI NUMBER 3 w y~*e ?? 1?

Further evidence of Parantaka's commitment to Chidam- baram lies in his gilding the roof of the chid-sabha, donating gold from booty obtained from military campaigns late in his reign.'22 This especially visible act of patronage spread the Chola king's reputation for generosity to a place of ancient sanctity and of some political independence.'23 The gift played into several local traditions as well, implying that Parantaka understood the identity myth had constructed for Chidambaram. Gilding the chid-sabha roof was already an established practice: Appar's songs describe the roof as gilt by the seventh century.'24 The theme of gold recurs in the Chidambaramahatmya's story of Hiranyavarman, whose dis- eased skin was said to have turned golden after he bathed at the Chidambaram temple tank, as if the very earth of the place were permeated with gold.'25 Parantaka's gift also participated in Chidambaram's tradition of celebrating its own singularity126 by highlighting the chid-sabha's peculiarly humped roof. The decision to refurbish the chid-sabha in its ancient form was, then, also a decision to reaffirm Chidam- baram's unique and ancient visual signature. Kulke has noted that emphasis on the peculiarities of local cults was a strategy commonly practiced by Indian kings for widening their support among new populations.127 These gestures indicate that sometime after his accession to the throne in 907 and before 945, Parantaka (or perhaps his father)128 had already revived the affiliation with Chidam- baram that had been nurtured by ancient kings he claimed as ancestors. That act of restoration may also have been a commencement of sorts. The dormancy of the dynasty's power before the ninth century may have made necessary the gesture of a conscious rededication to Chidambaram.129 Parantaka's gift implies that shortly after Nataraja imagery acquired a visual form, Nataraja had become the god of a Chola king, supported by a newly acquired armature of myths embodying royal ideals. The Nataraja cult then probably continued to evolve, transforming a Tamil deity of specific, local scope into a Sanskritic god of broader significance who more precisely suited an ambitious dynasty and religious community. With mutually accommodating gestures such as Parantaka's gifts and Chidambaram's reinvention of its danc- ing god, Chidambaram and the Cholas developed a compel- ling reciprocity that would operate for the duration of that dynasty, as the temple town's ancient sanctity and new god enhanced the Cholas' royal legitimacy and Chidambaram benefited from the ambitious Cholas' donations and growing fame. The Cholas also stood to gain from the spread of Chidambaram's fame, as this in turn could spread the fame of Nataraja's royal protectors across the increasingly large re- gion over which the Cholas claimed political authority. Nataraja would thereby have exemplified what Kulke calls a "royalizing" deity, one whose identity and worship contrib- uted directly to the reputation and authority of the affiliated king.130 Over the course of the tenth century, Sembiyan Mahadevi and perhaps Parantaka I preceded Rajaraja I Chola in deploying Nataraja as a Chola emblem with increasing promi- nence on temples they had constructed. As Chola patronage expanded, Nataraja's image appeared in new places. Thus, the cult at Chidambaram spread visually through the Kaveri region over the course of the tenth century, presumably as a result of Chola patronage of that cult and of temple construc- tion. Their deployment of Nataraja continued to emphasize Chidambaram's idiosyncrasies as a place and as a cult, thus keeping Nataraja embedded in his ancient home even as his fame extended across the Kaveri delta. Whether Nataraja was unique as a visual emblem of the Cholas' expanding power, and whether Chidambaram was unique in its relationship with the Cholas are intriguing questions worthy of future research. Nataraja's Radial Composition One further observation I would make about Nataraja im- ages--which, to my knowledge, has not been made in earlier scholarship-is that their forms exhibit a more or less radial composition in the disposition of their limbs and attributes. This radial pattern supports scholarly speculation that Indian artisans have long used such underlying geometric patterns, called yantras, in designing and learning to make sculptural (and architectural) objects.'3' I am also interested in Natara- jas' radial compositions for the role they may have played in the success of these images as Chola emblems. Like spokes in a wheel,'32 Shiva's limbs, hair, and sashes fan outward from the quiet center of his torso toward the encircling ring of fire. The locks of hair spread out from his head, the topmost locks often lifting upward while the lower</page><page sequence="24">SHIVA NATARAJA: SHIFTING MEANINGS OF AN ICON 413 locks echo the horizontal lines of the outstretched arms. The crest of kondrai leaves completes the radial arc across the top of the composition. Long sashes flutter toward his lower left from a cord tied just above the waist, and the suspended leg angles toward his lower right. The aureole around Nataraja ties these radials together, often anchoring the flying sashes, the outstretched hands, and the kondrai ornament. Small clusters of flame stud the circle, projecting the composition's radial lines infinitely beyond the encircling frame. These expansive lines signal overtly a compositional pat- tern that is realized more subtly through a wheel-shaped diagram, centered on Shiva's navel, and this diagram seems to underlie the placement of the god's limbs and attributes (Fig. 29 gives a hypothetical reconstruction of such a diagram mapped onto the Karaiviram Nataraja)." The aureole articu- lates the rim of the wheel, and the hand raised in abhayamudra (the open-palm gesture) highlights the radial delineated by the drum-bearing arm. The loose sashes also trace the spokes of this wheel, either horizontally or along a diagonal to the lower left. The upper body and neck may tilt to one side, but they tend to do so along a radial axis. Flexion of the arms and the standing leg could be rationalized as a means for fitting this body into a circle radiating from the navel: these elegantly long limbs are thus shortened as the knot of matted hair and the cluster of kondrai leaves extend the radial defined by the head and upper body.134 Though I have mapped a wheel-shaped diagram onto only one Nataraja sculpture, I perceive a similar structure underly- ing every Nataraja image I have studied, as long as I allow for reasonable flexibility within that pattern. I suspect that then as now artisans would have had room to extemporize, using their judgment and adjusting to the demands of materials. Yantras would have served as guides, not as legislation. The bends in the arms and the raised leg may then align the forearms and the shin along other radials extending from the navel. Sashes may be absent; they may articulate radials that are not symmetrical with the raised leg; or they may articulate radials with only some of their undulating lines. Some aureoles are oval or almond-shaped instead of round. They stretch downward to encompass the prostrate dwarf, a portion of the platform, or a longer or less deeply flexed leg on Shiva. But even in these cases, the aureole's upper section usually remains circular and focused on the navel.135 This wheel-shaped structure is, furthermore, generally absent from representations of Shiva's dance before the tenth century (for example, Figs. 5, 6).136 Few of these lift the leg across the hips (bhujangatrasita pose), depriving those compo- sitions of the radial defined by that suspended shin. Torsos lean away from the weight-bearing legs rather than toward them. The arms, when they do bend, rarely align the forearm with the navel; neither are fluttering scarves thus aligned. Few such figures display flying locks or the fiery aureole. The radial composition may be one of the innovations that distinguish Nataraja from preceding forms for depicting Shiva in dance. The radial composition might even have been one factor that made the Nataraja icon work well as an emblem of the Cholas, of the Chidambaram priestly community, and of the alliance between them. The expansive force of its lines could express ambitions of both groups simultaneously, just as the 4:Z _ -N.

The expanding ring of fire, the limbs pivoting around the axis of the navel, the eternally tranquil body at the composition's core, the spreading arms and hair and the whirling motion they imply could have portrayed a king, dynasty, or temple as the powerful center and the permeating radiance of a domain. The centrifugal force with which these shapes reach outward could have suggested the energy of geographic expansionism for which Parantaka and his father, Aditya I Chola, campaigned energetically. The radial emblem paral- leled the deity to early Chola kings in their aspiration to become the somatic center of a vast geographic and psycho- logical dominion. The same radials could also read as centrifu- gal vectors articulating Nataraja's presence radiating outward through the cosmos to every human heart from the center of that cosmos, Chidambaram. These lines may also have read as drawing inward to symbolize the centripetal pull that Chidam- baram aimed to have on pilgrims. Rereading the Nataraja Form Sembiyan Mahadevi's deployment of Nataraja on her temples across the Kaveri delta implies that he had become emblem- atic of the Chola dynasty by the later tenth century. The capacity of the sculpture's lines to embody the very objectives the Cholas and Chidambaram held in common could have made Nataraja icons particularly effective as emblems of the alliance between these parties. As Nataraja's presence ex- panded throughout the cosmos along the lines of his body, so the king's presence permeated the Tamil plain, and the reputation of a holy city reached beyond the Tillai forest. This radial shape may have initially encouraged the Cholas' inter-</page><page sequence="25">414 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 1999 VOLUME LXXXI NUMBER 3 est in Chidambaram, or it may have evolved over the course of the tenth century as a response to the Cholas' increasing commitment to Chidambaram's dancing god. This political meaning could have come to function for an icon that had previously signified a very different aspect of Shiva's nature. The bronze icon may have at first continued to represent the frenzied, destructive god whose worship at Tillai was already ancient. The first such Nataraja image- surely the original cult image enshrined in an ancient precursor of the chid-sabha in Chidambaram-may have carried these associations when it was made about 900 C.E. That sculptural form may have continued to mean this for some viewers, even as members of the Chola family began to read it as their own. Then, in another semiotic shift, the meaning with which modern audiences are most familiar accrued to this sculptural form by the thirteenth century, and the elegant abstractions of that reading gradually displaced the icon's earlier associations with gruesome rampage. As Coomaraswamy's appealing reading of the Nataraja image type has probably had much to do with these images' present fame and abundance, it becomes especially important to understand the ways in which his essay oversimplifies and even distorts the evidence available. We gain little by faulting Coomaraswamy for the state of scholarship he had to work with, and there is after all much that is profound and useful in the interpretation he offers. But we need not let the limits of Coomaraswamy's interpretation continue to restrict our read- ing of the Nataraja form. By granting that those images signified more fluidly, we can restore some of the complexity that would have characterized their significance for early viewers. As the preceding -speculations demonstrate, the image type lends itself to a variety of other readings, and these readings are linked more closely than Coomaraswamy's to the historical environment in which these sculptures first functioned.

To make this essay legible to readers who do not know Sanskrit and Tamil, I have chosen to omit diacritical marks on words from these languages and to transcribe those words into English spellings that capture the proper pronun- ciations as closely as possible. 2. My understanding of Coomaraswamy and of his contribution to South Asian art history owes much to papers and comments given by Mary F. Linda, Daniel Enbohm, Janice Leoshko, Sonia Y. M. Rhie, Jeremy Caslin, and Allan Antliffe at the session entitled "Coomaraswamy Reconsidered" in the 83rd Annual Conference of the College Art Association, San Antonio, 1995. 3. Coomaraswamy, 83-95. The first publication of this essay in the United States appears to have been in 1918 (by Sunwise Turn, New York), but Rao, 231, notes that it had been previously published in India in Siddhdnta-Dipikd 12 (1912). Among the many who have accepted his reading are J. N. Banerjea, The Development of Hindu Iconography (Calcutta: University of Calcutta Press, 1941), 472-73; P. R. Srinivasan; Douglas Barrett, Early Cola Bronzes (Bombay: Bhulabai Memorial Institute, 1965); Sivaramamurti; Barrett, 1976; R.

See also Unmai Vilakkam: The Exposition of Truth, Tamil text, trans. with notes and index by C. N. Singaravelu (Tellipazhi: Singaravelu, 1981). 11. See Smith, 17; W. Graefe, "Legends as Mile-Stones in the History of Tamil Literature," in Professor P K. Gode: Commemoration Volume, vol. 2 (Poona: Oriental Book Agency, 1960), 145; Zvelebil, 46-47. For the text itself, see Tirumantiram by Tirumular, trans. and notes B. Natarajan, gen. ed. N. Mahalingam (Madras: Sri Ramakrishna Math, 1991). 12. That is, the Tirumantiram incorporates Shaiva Siddhanta notions of god's fivefold acts, a principle central to Umapati Shivacarya's Kunchitangh- ristava of ca. 1300, which describes Nataraja's dancing form in precise detail; Smith, 17. 13. Rao, 231. 14. Gupta examples of early forms of Shiva's dance appear at Nachna and Bhumara. Later examples are found in East Bengal and Ellora. Further south, early examples appear in Aihole, Badami, Mogalrajapuram, Pattadakkal, Hemavati, Siyamangalam, and the Kailasanath temple in Kanchipuram. On these early examples, see Sivaramamurti, 168-222; Srinivasan, 4-12; and Zvelebil, 13-22. 15. On earlier dance forms as iconographic predecessors, see Zvelebil, 12-13. 16. Smith, 9, identifies the earliest such text as the Suta Samhita, soon before the Chidambaramahatmya, in which the ananda-tandava dance is also present. Suta Samhitd 111.8 describes a dancing form of Shiva that is quite close to the ananda-tandava form; Suta Samhitd, ed. S. Ramachandra Sastri and K. Kup- puswamy Sastri (Madras: K. R. Sastry, 1916), 313-22. But Kulke, 1970, 132, notes that in it the left leg position is not yet established, and he considers this poem to reflect an earlier icon at Chidambaram very close in form though not yet identical to the ananda-tandava. 17. Zvelebil (46-54) draws examples from Manikkavasagar (Tiruvdcakam IX, X, XXXV, Mdnikkavdcaka Cuvdmikal. Aruliya Tiruvdcakam, ed. Mu. Kanapatippillai [Chennai: Kantalakam, 1992]) and Tirumular (Tirumantiram IX, 2674-758), sections of which he retranslates as a corrective to Kulke and Narayana Ayyar. For the Tamil text and another English translation, see Natarajan (as in n. 11), 413-25. Younger, 202-14, presents his own English paraphrases of the Tamil poets Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar. Peterson's selections from these poets (118-22, 243-44) demonstrate the same limited conformity to the Nataraja icon that Younger's selections show: Appar IV.2.6, IV.80.1, IV.81.4, IV.92.9, IV.121.1; Sambandar 1.39.1,1.46,1.134.5; and Sundarar VII.90. See Tevdram, vol. 1, 41, 48-49, 142; vol. 2, 3-4, 79-81, 90-91, 492-93. Balasubrahmanyam argues that this Nataraja form was present in literature by the 7th century; S. R. Balasubrahmanyam, Early Chola Temples (New Delhi: Orient Longman, 1971), 287-99. Note, however, that he does not distinguish between Nataraja and other forms of Shiva's dance. 18. Tirumantiram 2799; for the Tamil text and English translation, see Natarajan (as in n. 11), 430. In other words, even if Zvelebil (46-52) is correct in the very early date-7th or 8th century--he proposes for this text, I do not see the Tirumantiram demonstrating the presence of the complete Nataraja image type that early. 19. Barrett, 1976, noted the last three. The Tiruchchenampundi example is mentioned by Lippe, 236. On the construction dates of these temples, see Barrett, 1974. R. Nagaswamy also identifies an inscription of the year 893 that commemorates a donor's gift of two lamps to "Kuttaperumal"; he interprets this as evidence that Nataraja images were already in worship in the late 9th century; Nagaswamy, "On Dating South Indian Bronzes," in Indian Art and Connoisseurship, Essays in Honour of Douglas Barrett, ed. John Guy (Middletown, N.J.: Grantha, 1995), 110-13. The inscription is in SII 13, no. 302 (1952), 160-61. Without the surviving sculpture itself, however, we cannot verify that "Kuttaperumal" bore the same iconographic connotations in the 9th century. Note that the figure on the 7th-century monolithic shrine, the Dharmaraja Ratha, in Mamallapuram, which Sivaramamurti, 192-93, classifies as a Nata- raja, is instead a representation of Shiva Kalarimurti, who lifts his leg to kick Kala; Rao, 156-64; Sivaramamurti also illustrates a 7th-century fresco of Shiva dancing from Panamalai (fig. 49), but the remaining fragments indicate that the pose there differs from Nataraja's; one arm is raised straight up in the air. Barrett (1974, 79-80) described a second "four-armed Nataraja" at Tiruvadu- turai above the Durga niche on the north wall of the ardhamandapa (the small hall before the inner sanctum). There, the postures of the arms and legs denote the dance posture called chatura-tandava rather than ananda-tandava. Kulke, 1970, 119, proposed Tiruvalishvaram as the site of the earliest surviving Nataraja figure. For illustrations, see Sivaramamurti, figs. 83, 84. The Tiruval- ishvaram is in ananda-tandava, but the temple seems not to have been constructed until the end of the 10th century; see Sastri, 706; Sivaramamurti, 1974, 232; Meister, 122-23, pl. 116; and K. D. Swaminathan, Early South Indian Temple Architecture: Study of TiruvdlWivaram Inscriptions (Trivandrum: CBH, 1990). Their assessments are based on the absence of inscriptions older than 996 on the temple and the richness of the iconographic program. Note that this site is also far to the south of the Kaveri delta, and thus not at the hub of Chola influence during the 10th century. David T. Sanford proposes examples at Tirumeyjnanam and Karuntattan- gudi as early Natarajas; Sanford, "Early Temples Bearing lRmayana Relief Cycles in the Chola Area: A Comparative Study," Ph.D. diss., University of California, Los Angeles, 1975, 239-42. My own examination of these temples, however, leads me to place them in the third quarter of the 10th century. 20. The Tiruchchenampundi figure stands over a niche containing Shiva Vinadhara-Dakshinamurti; the Punjai figure stands over a Durga niche; and the Tiruvaduturai and Tiruverumbur Natarajas stand over niches for seated forms of Shiva Dakshinamurti. Nagaswamy (as in n. 3), 241-48, notes that the location of Nataraja over Dakshinamurti conforms to Urdhva Shaiva philoso- phy and deduces that Urdhva Shaiva philosophy contributed to the genesis of the Nataraja form. In that philosophical system, Nataraja is seen as supreme over other forms of Shiva, such as Sadashiva, Ishana, and Dakshinamurti. I would suggest that this philosophical interpretation may equally well have arisen to explain preexisting sculptural realities. 21.John Irwin, as cited by Lippe, 272. In my view, the technical logic of this argument carries more weight than do the accidents of preservation on which some scholars have deduced that the first stone representations of this deity preceded or coincided with bronze representations. For example, Barrett, 1976, 201, relies on surviving examples when he hypothesizes that bronze and stone figures appeared simultaneously. Kulke, 1970, 119, argues that the earliest stone form to which he can assign a date (Tiruvalishvaram) was the prototype for later Natarajas. And Dehejia's evidence (40) for deducing that bronzes of Nataraja began to be cast under Sembiyan Mahadevi seems to be that this is the period from which the earliest datable objects survive. 22. See, for example, the objections of Dehejia, 131 n. 32, who points out that the inscription does not identify the female figure as a consort of Nataraja specifically. Barrett, 1981, has worked out a chronology of three types of Nataraja images in which only the last type, which he believes to have been initiated by Sembiyan Mahadevi, depicts all the locks of hair long and flying outward. Dehejia, 46, attributes such formally arranged locks to iconographic revisions of the 11th century. She also hypothesizes that the aureole's shape evolved from ovoid to circular at the beginning of the 11th century; cf. Dehejia, 43. 23. R. Nagaswamy, "A Nataraja Bronze and an Inscribed Uma from Karaiviram Village," Lalit Kald, no. 19 (1979): 17-19. 24.

Dhaky, "Cola Sculpture," in Chhavi: Golden Jubilee Volume (Varanasi: Bharat Kala Bhavan, 1971), figs. 422, 426, 433. 25. Barrett, 1981, 17, assesses this date for the Nataraja currently under worship at Chidambaram. Nagaswamy has since located three Nataraja bronzes at Chidambaram, but he finds them to be no earlier than the late 10th century; R. Nagaswamy, "Chidambaram Bronzes," Lalit Kald, no. 19 (1979): 14. 26. For further discussion of Hindu understandings of the living divine, see Davis (as in n. 4), 15-50. 27.

For discussion and partial English translations, see also Zvelebil, 53-54; and Younger, 197-214. Chidambaram's sanctity may be yet more ancient than the 7th century. Kulke, 1970, 221, alludes to an earlier folklore. Younger, 82-83, finds this place mentioned in stories of the Kalabhra kings who ruled the Tamil region ca. 4th-5th centuries. 28. Tirumangai praises the 8th-century king Nandivarman II Pallavamalla for donating to a Vaishnava shrine at Chidambaram; Tirumangai Alwar, Periyatirumoli 3.2.2b, 3.2.8b; for the Tamil text, see Balasubrahmanyam, 1944,</page><page sequence="27">416 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 1999 VOLUME LXXXI NUMBER 3 56. Kulashekhara also mentions a Vishnu shrine at Chidambaram in Tirumdli; for the Tamil texts of this and Tirumangai in transliteration, see Younger, 118 n. 16. 29. Though these legends survive only in the Chidambaramahatmya, Younger, 84, 90, suspects they are older. 30. I have derived the following description of the Chidambaram temple complex and its history from Smith; Younger, 81-124; Nagaswamy, 179-85; David Smith, "Chidambaram," in Temple Towns of Tamil Nadu, ed. George Michell (Bombay: Marg, 1993), 58-75; Harle; Natarajan (as in n. 3); Meister, 298-99; Balasubrahmanyam, 1979, 23-213 passim; T. Satyamurti, The Nataraja Temple, History, Art and Architecture (New Delhi: Classical Publications, 1978); Swamy; J. M. Somasundaram Pillai, Siva-Nataraja--The Cosmic Dance in Chid- Ambaram (Annamalainagar: Annamalai University Press, 1970); Balasubrahman- yam, 1944; and my own observations of the temple in 1985, although neither Harle nor I had access to the interior of the chid-sabha. 31. This shrine's dedication to Brahma or Chandesha is discussed by Harle (36-37); and indicated on the site plans of B.V.N. Naidu et al., Tdndava Laksaniam; or, The Fundamentals ofAncient Hindu Dancing; Being a Translation into English of the Fourth Chapter of the Natya Sdstra of Bhdrata, 3d ed. (New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal, 1971), fig. 1; and Younger, 95. 32. On this as the current understanding of the mukhalinga here, see Smith, 89. 33. For a plan and elevation of the chid-sabha and kanaka-sabha, see Swamy, 30-31. 34. These diagrams are derived from the sketches proposing the various phases of construction at Chidambaram by Swamy, 56-64; Younger, 83-110; andJ. M. Somasundaram Pillai, as reproduced in Harle, 33. 35. Studies published so far are partial or focused on the temple's religious or literary identity rather than its architectural history. The most recent and useful text is Satyamurti (as in n. 30). Harle focuses on the gopura (gateways) and admits reluctance to sorting out a history of the entire complex. Natarajan (as in n. 3), Swamy, and Pillai (as in n. 30) disagree on key points and are often speculative. Plans contradict each other and published photographic documen- tation is sparse. The monument appears briefly in such surveys as Meister, 298-99; and Balasubrahmanyam, 1979. Smith presents many useful points of information but does not address the temple's structural history. Younger proposes a sequence of construction and renovation but does not employ art historical data or standards of evidence. 36. Speculation about the 11th-century project is based on an inscription crediting Naralokaviran, a general during the reign of the Chola king Kulottunga I (1070-1118), with many construction projects. The entire inscription is published in SII 4, no. 225 (1923), 31-34; Swamy, 123-34 (English and transliterated Sanskrit); and Balasubrahmanyam, 1979, 23-26 (English only). See esp. verses 8-11 and 30. The language of the inscription, however, is vague in identifying the structures involved. Younger (98-103) interprets it to say that Naralokaviran had built the third enclosure wall, two of its massive gateways (gopura) and the innermost enclosure wall, the steps and porches that transformed a pond into the formal tank, and that he expanded the Shivakamasundari shrine. To another wave of building activity in the later 13th century Younger (104-9) assigns the linga shrine, the second enclosure wall, and construction on the seven-story gopura of the third enclosure wall. Harle (63-69) sees the west and east gopura as having been finished by 1250, the south gopura by 1272, and the north gopura perhaps begun at that time and finished during the Vijayanagara period, or fully rebuilt during the Vijayanagara period in the style of the earlier gopura. 37. Inscriptions credit the Govindaraja shrine to the Vijayanagar king Achyutadevaraya in 1539; see Rangacharya, vol. 1, 132-33, no. 64 (ARSIE, no. 272 of 1913), 149, no. 169 (ARSIE, no. 1 of 1915); and S. R. Balasubrahman- yam, "Chidambaram Inscription of Acyutadeva Raya," Journal of Oriental Research (Madras) 12 (1938): 168-78. Satyamurti (as in n. 30), 24, points out that some shrine was already in place before Kulottunga II removed it in the mid-12th century. 38. Nagaswamy, 179-85, also believes that the present chid-sabha structure, though rebuilt in 1648, adheres in many respects to the shrine that had stood there since perhaps the 7th century. 39. Smith observes that of the temple's four large gopura, only the south- facing one bears saffron flags and, in addition, is aligned with a shrine within, and that is the chid-sabha: Smith (as in n. 30), 65. Further indications of the shrine's original southward orientation lie in the processional directions used in local festivals; Younger, 97. Glenn Yocum notes one other example of a south-facing temple, that at Avadayarkoil, which is associated with yogis, teachers, and, thus, Dakshi- namurti, another south-facing deity; Yocum, "Brahmin, King, Sanny~si and the Goddess in a Cage: Reflections on the Conceptual Order of Hinduism at a Tamil Saiva Temple," Contributions to Indian Sociology, n.s., 20 (1986): 24. 40. Smith, 1996, 66, 87, suggests also that the chid-sabha and kanaka-sabha are, unlike the more typical sealed inner shrine, designed to display imagery as a stage would display a dancer. 41. Nagaswamy, 181-82, draws the parallel to Kerala. 42. According to Smith, 85; but Satyamurti (as in n. 30), 15, maintains the columns of the chid-sabha are of polished stone. For more on the materials of this shrine, see Smith, 85-89; and Harle, 37-38. 43. Smith, 86, alludes to the shared orientation. Smith, 87, notes as well that these murals also demonstrate that the chid-sabha was originally designed to display the dancing god as an open stage displays performers, with the gilt roofs acting as a gleaming beacon to attract the eye. 44. Compare Gerd Mevissen's discovery of an analogous use of visual arts to embody political geography. He finds that Cholas and their contemporaries oriented representations of Shiva Tripurantaka to face the direction of their enemies' kingdoms; Gerd J. R. Mevissen, "Political Geography as a Determi- nant in South Indian Temple Art? A Case Study of Tripurantakamfirti," South Asian Archaeology 1993 (Helsinki: Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia, 1994), 483-95. 45. According to the Chidambaramahatmya; see Kulke, 1970, 166-70. 46. Younger, 13-15, paraphrases a number of verses from Appar, Samban- dar, Sundarar, and Manikkavasagar that attest to the early presence of the Three Thousand, or Antanar, at Tillai. 47. On this community and the issue of Vedic study, see Smith, 1996, 58-79. See also Younger's research on this strictly endogamous group of some one thousand people and on the priests themselves, who call themselves di-ksitar and who own the temple as its collective trustees (11-45). 48.

For Tamil examples from before 900, see the poems of Appar (IV.2.6, IV.92.9); Sambandar (1.46,1.134.5), and Sundarar (VII.72). For the Tamil texts, see T-evdram, vol. 1, 48-49; vol. 2, 3, 90, 472-73.

Smith, 148, 226-27, comments that throughout the Tevdram Shiva is essentially a fierce goblin, and the cremation ground is the only site for his dance. While the Sanskrit texts were part of an elite world of thought, the Tamil songs of the Tevdram were widely popular and accessible. 49. Snakes are a primary attribute of Bhairava in the Vishnudharmottarapu- rana, which mentions them in three verses: 59.2, 59.3, 59.6. For the English as well as the Sanskrit text of this treatise on painting, see Pratimrdlaksana of the Visnudharmottara, trans. D. C. Bhattacharyya (New Delhi: Harman Publishing House, 1991), 89-90. Marguerite Adiceam also finds snakes identified as Bhairava's sign in the Silparatna, I and III; Adiceam, "Les Images de Siva dans l'Inde du Sud," pt. 2, "Bhairava," Arts Asiatiques 11, no. 2 (1965): 26. The text, however, is of the 16th century and may have little direct bearing on 9th-century perceptions; The Silparatna by Sre Kumdra, ed. Mah-mahopndhyaya T. Ganapati Sastri, pt. 1, Trivandrum Sanskrit Series, no. 75 (Trivandrum: Government Press, 1922), 2. 50. For an illustration, see Carmel Berkson and Wendy Doniger et al., Elephanta, the Cave of Shiva (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1983), pls. 40, 44. 51.

The Kurma Purdna associates the skull with the head of Brahma that Bhairava cut off; Kurma Purdna, 11.31.23-108, trans. G. V. Tagare, 2 vols. (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1983), 514-21. For further discussion of Shiva's expiation of that sin as Kankalamurti, see Adiceam, 83-112. A bell, a skull, cobras, and a long garland of bones and skulls are appropriate to this violent story. See, for example, the "Bhairava Adored" from the collection of Thakur Sahib of Sohagpur, Shahdol, in Goswamy, no. 150. 52. See the fragmentary image from Hingajgarh, now in the Central Museum, Indore, no. 2 (195), in Goswamy, no. 161. A similar image remains under worship at the Vaital Deul in Bhubaneshwar, Orissa; Vidya Dehejia, Early Stone Temples of Orissa (New Delhi: Vikas Publishing House, 1979), 24. 53. Nagaswamy has identified as Nishumbhasudani the emaciated form of the goddess at Tanjavur who sits on the crumpled forms of two demons. On her associations with violent death, see R. Nagaswamy, "A Note on Ni'umbha- sudani Installed by VijayTlaya Chola in Tanjore," Lalit Kal, no. 18 (1977), 39-40. 54. Zvelebil, 17-18, notes that Shiva's posture is actually a conflation of two postures delineated in the ancient dance manual the Na.tya Sdstra: the arms of bhujangatrasita (Karana 24) and the legs of bhujanganchita (Karana 40). Understanding of the posture's name in the 10th century may not, however, have been as multifaceted, as the term "frightened by a snake" more readily describes what the legs might be doing. For the textual passages, accompanied by illustrations from the Chidambaram temple, see Naidu (as in n. 31), 27, 31. Rao , 227-28, also finds these postures in the Amshumedbhedagama, which includes a third variant, bhujangalalita. 55. For an illustration, see Sivaramamurti, figs. 37, 38. Zvelebil, 17-19, argues the importance of this relief as an iconographic precursor to Nataraja. 56. Many earlier figures of Shiva's dance hold the drum. See, for example, Ellora, Badami, Kanchi, and the Nallur bronze, in Rao, pls. LXIII, LXVI, LXFII, LXX. Rao, 177-78, finds the drum also listed as one of Bhairava's attributes in the Rupamandana and the Vatuka-Bhairavakalpa. 57. Younger, 90, understands that legend to describe the present site of the nritta-sabha, the area south of the chid-sabha, which was a cremation ground and the home of the local goddess. 58. Coomaraswamy, 89-90. Coomaraswamy did not pursue this point since his concern lay with similes generated later by this history, similes that picture the burning ground as the hearts of Shiva's devotees from which he burns</page><page sequence="28">SHIVA NATARAJA: SHIFTING MEANINGS OF AN ICON 417 away illusions and deeds. Note also that Coomaraswamy (84-85) identifies the tandava dance as Bhairava's dance in cemeteries and as the dance performed by the Shiva figures at Ellora, Elephanta, and Bhubaneshwar, rather than the ananda-tandava dance that is the focus of this essay and that he terms the "Nadanta" dance. Smith, 100, points out that Coomaraswamy does not define the connotations of the Nadanta dance, but that Dorai Rangaswamy identifies the Nadanta as the dance in the crematorium. 59. Coomaraswamy, 84-85. 60. For illustrations of Coomaraswamy's examples as well as others like them, see Sivaramamurti, 172-79, and 292-96. 61. See, for example, the skeletal figures drinking blood in a sculptural fragment from a Chamunda image, now in the State Museum, Bhopal (no. 817), in Goswamy, no. 164. Bhairava himself may be emaciated. See Rao, 178, pl. XLII.1, 3; and Stella Kramrisch, Manifestations of Shiva (Philadelphia: Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1981), 34. 62. On Bhringi, see Smith, 22-24. 63. See Sivaramamurti, 172-75, 189, 293-94. 64. Karaikal Ammaiyar prays for "the form of a demoness (pey) who could stand by god ever in prayer"; Periya Puranam, 1765-66. For a recent English translation, see St. Sekkizhar's Periya Purdnam (Part I), trans. T. N. Ramachan- dran (Thanjavur: Tamil University, 1990), 358. Karaikal originates in the Tiruvalangadu recension of the dance contest myth, a recension that probably precedes the Chidambaram recension. Shulman, 1980, 213-328. 65. Smith, 3, 186. He also cites D.H.H.

Smith, 222-27. Ren6 Grousset proposed that the dwarf is underfoot because "this dance is danced upon the bodies of the dead," and that the dwarf's gesture then teaches that destruction leads to generation; Grousset, quoted in Sastri, 730-31. 67. These are found at Melakkadambur in Tamil Nadu (ca. 1100), and in Assam, Malhar, and the Pala kingdom (from the 10th-12th centuries); see Sivaramamurti, figs. 171-74, 179, 181-82, 236. On Kalugumalai and Vilinjam, see ibid., figs. 60, 63. 68. This was true despite profound differences in their systems of kingship as well as despite the intervention of some five centuries of dynastic obscurity (the 4th-9th centuries). On the history of the Cholas of the Sangam age, see Sastri, 30-106. On the early Cholas' uses of that past, see Stein, 1984, 42; and Stein, 1980, 45-46. Stein, 1984, describes three distinct kingship systems evolving over the first millennium c.E.:, the heroic, the moral, and the ritual. 69. Kulke and Rothermund, 122-23; Sastri, 110-284.

I would compare early Chola kingship to the modes of kingship perceived by Dirks, Stein, and Kulke to have been practiced before the 8th century; Nicholas Dirks, "Political Authority and Structural Change in Early South Indian History," Indian Economic and Social History Review 13, no. 2 (1976): 143; Stein, 1984, 3-11; and Kulke and Rothermund, 130-34. Accord- ing to Kulke's model, kings in the process of expansion--extending cultiva- tion, defeating neighbors and treating them as tributaries--had not yet established a centralized administration. 75. Kaimal. 76. The parents of Kochchenganan (Krccenkanan), a Chola king of the Sangam era, finally conceive him after praying at Chidambaram. Chidam- baram was also the site of Kochchenganan's birth. Periya Purn.am 4203-6. For the Tamil texts of these verses, see S. R. Balasubrahmanyam, "The Oldest Chidambaram Inscriptions: Chapter I," Journal of Annamalai University 12 (1943): 114-15. Sekkilar's Periya Purdnam is a work of the 12th century. The Periya Purdnaam reports Chidambaram priests refusing to invest the royal diadem on a local chieftain, saying, "Only the ancient family of the Cholas was entitled to this high privilege"; Periya Purdn.am 3933. Tirumangai reports that the Pallava king Nandivarman II Pallavamalla gave gold, pearls, and precious stones to Govindaraja, whose worship the dikshitars conduct, i.e., the form of Vishnu housed at Chidambaram. For the Tamil texts, see Balasubrahmanyam, 1944, 56. The temple was also reported to defend the Pallava kings' right to tax revenues. The poet Sundarar (ca. 780-820) declares, "The god of Puliyur Citrampalam will cause trouble to kings who refuse to pay tribute to the Pallavas who guard the world" Tevdram VII.90.4. For the Tamil, see Tevdram, vol. 2, 493; translated by Shulman, 1990, 569. 77. Barrett, 1981, 15, perceives the limbs to have just stopped moving, with the hair not yet come to rest. Zvelebil, 34, reads the flying locks as dance in full swing. The play of light across bronze can enhance the impression of figural motion. Kapila Vatsyayan argues forcefully that all sculptural renderings distort the postures of Indian dance since sculpture is necessarily static and the postures allude to flowing movements; Vatsyayan, "Siva-Natega: Cadence and Form," in Discourses on Siva, ed. Michael Meister (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1984), 193-200. 78. Zvelebil, 43-45. He does not, however, cite primary sources for these propositions. Zvelebil dates the Sangam age from ca. 200 B.C.E.-C.E. 300 Shulman, 1980, 213 nn. 7, 8, also notes the tradition in Tamil literature of Kotravai's and Murugan's battlefield dances. 79.

Srinivas, "A Note on Sanskritization and Western- ization," Far Eastern Quarterly 15, no. 4 (1956). On the strategies implied by such transformations and for other cults (the Minakshi cult of Madurai, the Jagannath cult of Puri, and the Krishna cult of Mathura) similarly transformed by royal involvement into legends that reified kingship, see Kulke, 1978, 132-33; and Dennis Hudson, "Siva, Minaksi and Vishnu-Reflections on a Popular Myth in Madurai," in South Indian Temples, ed. Burton Stein (New Delhi: Vikas Publishing House, 1978), 107-18. 81. Kulke, 1970, lays out the case for reading the Chidambaramahatmya this way. For the Tamil text, see Cidambara Mdhdtmya, ed. Somasekhara Dikshitar (Kadavasal: Sri Meenakshi Press, 1971). For a translation into English, see E. A. Sivaraman, Chidambara Mahatmya (Bombay: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1993). 82. According to Kulke, 1970, 221. 83. Kulke, 1970, 46-50. Zvelebil, 72, points out that the Myth of the Pine Forest must have been in place in the Chidambaramahatmya before the year 1000, because it is told in the Skanda Purdna, which is redacted by that date, with its earliest material deriving from the 8th century. 84. For summaries of this story as it is rendered in the Chidambaramahatmya, see Kulke, 1970, 10-12; Younger, 170; and Zvelebil, 68. On other texts that narrate this tale and for a summary of his sculptural representations in South India, see Adiceam, 83-112; and Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty, Siva, the Erotic Ascetic (New York: Oxford University Press, 1973), 178-84. 85. Coomaraswamy, 85. 86. Zvelebil, 30-35, reads Nataraja's feminine earring as an allusion to the goddess whom Nataraja, as resolver of oppositions, embraces within his male self. The tiger Shiva flays for a loincloth suggests the ancient totem that gave this place its early name, "Town of the Tiger." The pose Shiva strikes to win a narrative, could also have strengthened the associations between Nataraja and the linga's early phallic connotations. Referred to as urdhva-janu or "erect leg," this pose may imply the erect phallus (urdhva-linga) that is also Shiva's emblem. On the erotic nature of this dance, see Zvelebil, 31; and Kulke, 1970, 110. Nataraja's association with Bhikshatana, who is ithyphallic in the pine forest, could incorporate an early cult of the linga at Tillai. Younger, 104-9, proposes that linga worship was only introduced late to Chidambaram with the construction of the still-standing linga shrine in the 13th century. Kulke and Zvelebil, however, see in local myth and in the use of the term mulasthana ("original place") indications that the linga may have been worshiped here before the Nataraja icon developed; Kulke and Rothermund, 142; Zvelebil, 30-31, 67. Zvelebil, 34-36, would see yet more deities absorbed into Nataraja's form, though note that his evidence for the presence of Krishna, Murugan, and Kiratamurti rests on his unusual reading of the crest of kondrai leaves as peacock feathers. 87. On the role of loot and the display of loot in the reification of medieval Indian kingship, see Davis (as in n. 4), 53-85. 88. On Kulke's analysis of this name change, see Kulke and Rothermund, 143. He understands the "little hall" as the shrine of Murugan.

Kulke, 1970, perceives a competitive atmosphere among deities of this place. Zvelebil, 68-71, expands on Kulke's picture.

The Kali temple appears to have been built during the 13th century, while Kopperunjingan, a leader of the Kadava feudatory family, had authority over this area. Twenty-two inscriptions on a prakara of the Chidambaram complex give the date in terms of his regnal years; Rangacharya, vol. 1, 127-29, nos. 30-51 (ARSIE, nos. 459-68 of 1902, nos. 390-401 of 1903). One of these records a sale of land for the construction of a temple to Pidariyar (Kali); see ibid., 129, no. 51 (ARSIE, no. 401 of 1903). 96. On the basis of her use of Nataraja figures on her many temples, Zvelebil, 24-25, sees Sembiyan Mahadevi as instrumental in the spread of the Nataraja cult and in "pressing for its acceptance as the state-cult of the Cholas." 97. On the productive interactions between the political and the sacred in medieval India, see Kulke, 1970; Kulke, 1978; idem, "Legitimation and Town-Planning in the Feudatory States of Central Orissa," AARP (Art and Archaeology Research Papers), no. 17 (1980): 30-40; Dirks (as in n. 71); and Appadurai, chap. 2. 98. On the importance of such interactions to the study of art, see, for example, Susan Huntington, "Kings as Gods, Gods as Kings: Temporality and Eternity in the Art of India," Ars Orientalis 24 (1994): 30-39; and Michael D. Willis, "Religions and Royal Patronage in North India," in Gods, Guardians and Lovers: Temple Sculptures from North India AD 700-1200, ed. Vishaka N. Desai and Darielle Mason (New York: Asia Society Galleries, 1993), 48-65. 99. On these dates, see N. Sethuraman, "Date of Birth, Date of Coronation and the Last Day of Rja Rja C61a," in Rdjardja the Great: Seminar Proceedings (Bombay: Ananthacharya Indological Research Institute, 1987), 17-32. 100. Stein, 1980, 830-34, argues that the Rajarajeshvara was unprecedent- edly political in nature, in that earlier temples in the area were built on sites already sanctified by divine miracles or saintly song, whereas Tanjavur's historical associations were only with the Chola family. 101. No inscriptions or other labels confirm this identification, and K. R. Srinivasan (in Meister, 238) identifies them instead as an earlier Kerala king Cheraman and his queens. The painted figures, however, are given much emphasis through their large scale and eye-level placement, and most other scholars interpret the figure as Rajaraja, including the first author to publish the murals, S. K. Govindaswamy, "Cola Painting," Journal of the Indian Society of Oriental Art 1 (1933): 73-80. See also Sastri, 741; S. R. Balasubrahmanyam, Middle Chola Temples (Faridabad: Thomson Press [India], 1975), 33-34; and B. Venkataraman, Rdjardjeivaram: The Pinnacle of Chola Art (Madras: Mudgala Trust, 1985), 119, 130. 102. That is, his ishtadevata; Kulke, 1978, 199. Nataraja's repeated presence in this Tanjavur temple and the mural that probably represents Rajaraja worshiping him at Chidambaram lead me to disagree with Younger's view (136-37) that Rajaraja turned his religious attentions away from Chidam- baram. 103. These inscriptions note gifts made to the image of his consort by Rajaraja's chief queen, Cholamahadevi, and his sister in 1010: SII, vol. 2, pt. 1, no. 2 (1892), verse 1, 14; and SII, vol. 2, pt. 1, no. 6 (1892), verses 1-2, 68-69. A number of scholars agree that Rajaraja himself donated this dancing figure and that it survives as the large bronze still housed at the Rajarajeshvara; Barrett, 1976, 188-89; Dehejia, 46; Sivaramamurti, 1974, 229; and R. Naga- swamy, "Iconography and Significance of the Brihadigvara Temple, Tafijaviir," in Discourses on Siva, ed. M. Meister (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1984), 177.

See, for example, SII, vol. 2, pt. 1, no. 1, in which most verses give the weight of the gift in terms of "the stone called Adavallan." Nagaswamy also finds inscriptions describing the temple's largest annual festival, the Brahmotsava, in which this Adavallan bronze was taken out in processions over three consecutive days. R.

On renovations at Tiruvelvikkudi, see Lippe, 237; and Gary Schwindler, review of Early Cola Architecture and Sculpture, by Douglas Barrett, Artibus Asiae 39, no. 1 (1977): 98. 111. The oldest inscription at Tirurameshvaram is from 974; Meister, 181. Also on the basis of inscriptions, Barrett, 1974, 100, attributes the Kuhur temple to ca. 970; ARSIE of 1918, nos. 286, 287, 292 of 1917, 25-26. 112. Barrett, 1974, 113-14, assigns the Udaiyargudi temple to the beginning of his Third Phase in his classification system, that is, shortly after 969. Note that no Nataraja sculpture survives at Udaiyargudi, but inscriptions there indicate that an "Araiyan Geyavidangan" funded the Nataraja niche and the other two niches of the south ardhamandapa wall; ARSIE, no. 555 of 1920. 113. Barrett, 1974, 107-8. 114. Note, however, that Lingodbhava's narrative links with Bhikshatana are weaker in the Chidambaram version of this myth than they are in other versions. Zvelebil, 71, points out that the Chidambaramahatmya suppresses the episode in which the angry sages curse Shiva's linga to fall to the ground, where it grows infinitely (thus leading into Lingodbhava's manifestation). Instead, the Chidambaramahatmya integrates the linga theme by having Shiva urge the sages to worship the linga at Tillai. For a survey of this deity's iconography, see T. Chandrakumar, "Iconography of Lingodbhavamurti in South India," East and West 41 (1991): 153-72. 115. The first case is the Umamaheshvara temple at Konerirajapuram, Sembiyan Mahadevi's earliest known commission. Bhikshatana figures are present at Srinivasanallur, Kumbakonam, and Tirukandiyur, but Barrett, 1974, 75, perceives the Tirukandiyur figure to be a later addition. 116. For further discussion on the iconography of Bhikshatana images in South Indian sculpture, see Adiceam, 83-112. 117. Compare, for example, the sculptural sequence of Ganesha to Durga aiding the transformation of the viewer as Huntington hypothesizes at Udayagiri; Susan Huntington, with contributions byJohn C. Huntington, Art of Ancient India (New York: Weatherhill, 1985), 191. Note also that the Tamil text, the Vaikhanasa Agama, recommends the same sequence; see Gary Michael Tartakov and Vidya Dehejia, "Sharing, Intrusion and Influence: The Mahisasuramardini Imagery of the Chalukyas and the Pallavas," Artibus Asiae 45, no. 4 (1984): 330. 118. Smith (as in n. 30), 65-66. 119. My thanks to Dennis Hudson for helping me see this pattern. 120. An inscription of the year 945 on this temple credits Parantaka with funding the completion of the building's upper layers; ARSIE, no. 143 of 1925. Since the Nataraja is high on the vimana wall, it may have been created under Parantaka's patronage. Note, however, that the inscription describing the extent of construction Parantaka funded uses a term (kht.appatai) whose exact meaning is no longer known. The precise upper layer with which Parantaka's contribution began remains, therefore, a matter of speculation. 121. See Kaimal, 57-58, fig. 6, for an illustration. For a nearby comparison, see the umbrella over the portrait of King Uttama Chola at the Umamahesh- vara temple at Konerirajapuram, illustrated in Balasubrahmanyam (as in n. 101), pl. 167. 122. On inscriptional evidence and the date of the gift, see Kaimal, 58. 123. Chidambaram's political independence is suggested by its identifica- tion as a taniyur, a self-governing region; see Rangacharya, vol. 1, 125, no. 4 (ARSIE, no. 118 of 1888). Here the name used for Chidambaram is Perumbatra Puliyur. On this and the nature of taniyurs as more independent than the nadus composing the majority of the deltaic region, see Subbarayalu (as in n. 73), 92-94. 124. For the Tamil text, see Balasubrahmanyam, 1944, 55 n. 1. Note also that the act of gilding was repeated after the early 10th century, as, for example, by Kulottunga I Chola's sister Kundavai; Venkataraman, 108-9. 125. On this myth, see Kulke, 1970, 156-58, adhyaya 22; Sivaraman (as in n. 81), 63 (chap. 21); and Younger, 173-76. Though this story enters the Chidambaramahatmya in the 12th or 13th century, its roots may be much older. On the Tamil notion that identity inheres within the earth of a place, see Samuel K. Parker, "Contemporary Temple Construction in South India: The Srirangam Rajagopuram," Res 21 (1992): 112; and E. Valentine Daniel, Fluid Signs: Being a Person the Tamil Way (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984).</page><page sequence="30">SHIVA NATARAJA: SHIFTING MEANINGS OF AN ICON 419 126. On the singularity of Chidambaram's chid-sabha, see Smith, 87; and on its unusual rituals and management, see also Younger, 13-45, 85. 127. Kulke, 1978, 130-31. 128. Nambi Andar Nambi and Sekkilar claim that Parantaka's father, Aditya I Chola, roofed the Chidambaram hall in gold; for the Tamil verse, see Balasubrahmanyam, 1944, 59 n. 5. There are, however, two copperplate inscriptions that assign the gilding of the chid-sabha to Parantaka alone. These are the Larger Leyden grant; Epigraphia Indica 20, no. 34, 256, verse 17; and the Tiruvalangadu grant; SII, vol. 3, no. 205 (1920), 419, verse 53. The Larger Leyden grant claims that Parantaka won this gold in his victories over Pandya and Sri Lanka kings. In addition, Gandaraditya's Tiruvicaippa credits Paran- taka with gilding the chid-sabha. For the Tamil verse, see Balasubrahmanyam, 1944, 59 n. 4; for an English translation, see Younger, 216. 129. In such matters, each medieval South Indian kingship may have undergone the evolutionary process separately instead of inheriting achieve- ments from preceding dynasties; Kaimal, 37. 130. For his definition of "royalizing," see Kulke, 1978, 133. 131. See, for example, John F. Mosteller, "Texts and Craftsmen at Work," in Making Things in South Asia: The Role of Artist and Craftsman, ed. Michael W. Meister, Proceedings of the South Asia Seminar, 4, 1985-86 (Philadelphia: Department of South Asia Regional Studies, 1988), 24-33; and Kapila Vatsyayan, The Square and the Circle of the Indian Arts (New Delhi: Roli Books, 1983), 73-99. Given the importance of yantras as auspicious structures on which to organize images, deducing them from finished pieces has absorbed the attention of other historians of Indian art as well. Rao, 571-78, has proposed that an equilateral triangle underlies the composition of Shiva Nataraja, with apices beneath the standing foot and at the palms of the outstretched hands. He deduces this from the kamikagama and karanagama texts, which give measurements but do not actually delineate a triangle. Note that many rules advocated in agama texts were descriptive as well as prescrip- tive, their "principles" derived from already long-established practices. 132. A wheel literally articulates the radial composition of two 8th-9th- century figures of Shiva's dance (in catura and urdhva-janu modes) from Bihar, published by Raju Kalidos, "New Dimensions of the Cosmic Dancer," East and West 40 (1990): 335-39. Note that in these figures, the center of the wheel is aligned with the navel. 133. Vatsyayan (as in n. 77), 192, 200, also perceives the compositions of Nataraja images to be focused on the navel, from which all energies emanate and on which they focus. 134. I turn to geometric logic because the half flexion of the elbows contradicts the principles of classical Tamil dance, which call for smoothly extended or more sharply bent elbows when the arms are held out to the side. 135. See, for example, the elongated aureoles on the bronzes from Kilakattur, Seynalur, and Tarangambadi, illustrated in C. Sivaramamurti, South Indian Bronzes (Bombay: Lalit Kala Akademi, 1963), figs. 100, 103, 105. 136. See also the wider range of such figures illustrated in Sivaramamurti, 168-222; Srinivasan, 4-12; and Zvelebil, 13-22. The Bihari example cited by Kalidos (as in n.132) is a noteworthy exception.</page></plain_text>
