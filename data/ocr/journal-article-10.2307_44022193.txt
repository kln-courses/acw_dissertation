<plain_text><page sequence="1">KANT, HAMANN-JACOBI AND SCHELLING ON HUME* To the extent that contemporary philosophy deals with traditional problems in the traditional manner, Hume's influence in epistemology is still of paramount importance l. In fact, with some stylization and simplification an important segment of the history of Western philosophy can be presented in the following manner: According to Hume, all legitimate knowledge is derived from experience. But experience never yields universal, necessary propositions - it can only tell us "this and this happened", but it can never tell us "this and this happened by necessity"; and therefore it never can tell us "this and this will happen in the future". Kant admitted that experience never results in universal, necessary propositions. But, he insisted, we are in possession of at least one science consisting of universal, necessary propositions - a science the legitimate character of which nobody could deny, viz. mathematics2. Therefore, Kant concluded, not all legitimate knowledge was based on experience. Hume, so Kant said in his Prolegomena , did not realize the true character of mathematics 3. 1 For a succinct presentation of the relation between Hume and analytical philosophy see S. N. Hampshire, "Hume's Place in Philosophy", in D. F. Pears (ed.), David Hume : A Symposium , London 1963, pp. 1-10, esp. 4 f. 2 I take it that Hume's doctrines concerning the character of mathematical knowledge, which he expressed in the Treatise , do not essentially differ from those expressed in his Enquiry with one exception, irrelevant to the present context, viz. that in the Treatise (III 1) he rather sharply differentiates geometry from arithme- tic and algebra, whereas in the Enquiry (IV 1) he speaks simply of geometry as merely another branch of mathematics. In the Abstract , Hume makes no differen- tiation between geometry and arithmetic on p. 13, but he does it on p. 24. He obviously was not interested in making up his mind in this respect. 3 In Kant's language: Hume considered all mathematical (or at least arithmetic- al) knowledge to be analytical, i.e., not knowledge in the ufll sense of the word. In Hume's language: Mathematics (or at least arithmetics) expressed only relations of ideas, not any matters of fact. This is said by W. A. Suchting, Hume and Ne- 8</page><page sequence="2">482 PHILIP MERLAN If Kant was right as to the nature of mathematics, he would clearly have refuted Hume. It was only Russell who undertook to destroy Kant's argument: he asserted that mathematics indeed consists of univ- ersal and necessary propositions but that all these propositions were merely analytical (tautological) in character and thus no knowledge in any true sense of the word. Thus Russell restored Hume's empiricism {all true knowledge is based on experience), fully aware of its skeptical consequences (no universal, necessary truths; no true predication pos- sible)4, though unwilling to accept them5. Hegel is interested in Hume almost exclusively because of the latter's skepticism also in the field of moral philosophy6. He finds him remarkable almost solely because his philosophy became the starting point of that of Kant. Now it is well known that skepticism is by no means Hume's last word. Implicitly or explicitly, both in the field of action and that of theory, man has always claimed to be in possession of necessary and universal truths. This claim, Hume said, can not be justified, if by justification we mean something like reasonable proof. The basis of that claim is not reason; it is something quite non-rational - call it cessary Truth , "Dialogue", 5 (1966), pp. 47-65. Suchting denies that, according to Hume, all necessary propositions are analytic. It seems to me that the main weakness of Suchting's paper is his treatment of Hume's occasional dicta on equal footing with the passages in which Hume deals with this problem ex professo (esp. in Enquiry IV 1). The clearest exposition of Kant's attitude to Hume's skepticism is contained in his Prolegomena par. 2 (in its original form as restored by Vaihin- ger by transferring to it parts of par. 4). That Hume's relation of ideas should be equated with Kant's analytical propositions has been denied by P. Linke, Hume's Lehre vom Wissen , "Philosophische Studien", 17 (1901), pp. 624-673, esp. 649-651. 4 See, e.g., A. History of Western Philosophy (1945), p. 831 f. (on the nature of mathematics); p. 673 (« it must be hoped that there is some way of escaping the consequences of radical empiricism »). Russell later in Human Knowledge , New York, 1948, asserted that he indeed found such an escape. The validity of this clam cannot be discussed here; I must limit myself to quoting H. J. McLendon, Has Russell Answered Hume?, "Journal of Philosophy", 49 (1952), pp. 145-159, esp. p. 158 f., and state that I agree with his denial of the validity. 5 Thus I bypassed the question of what Hume's reasoning was concerning causality. Within the framework of what I said above it could be put this way: To assert that A is the cause of B is implicitly to assert that A must in the past have been followed by B and will therefore by necessity be followed by B in the future. However, all that experience, the only source of legitimate knowledge, can tell us is that in the past A has always been followed by B. In other words, Hume's reasoning is not affected by admission or by negation of the principle of causality. Even if A were actually the cause of B, we would never have the right to assert this. 6 The passages can easily be found with the help of Glockner's Hegel Lexikon (G. W. F. Hegel, Sämtliche Werke , Vol. XXIV, Stuttgart 1937).</page><page sequence="3">KANT, HAMANN- JACOBI AND SCHELLING ON HUME 488 instinct, nature, custom, etc., or, to use a general term, belief. While we imagine we know, we actually (only!) believe whatever some non- rational factor forces us to believe. However, it is precisely this (mere!) belief which enables us to live. We can not know that if we left our room on the third floor by the window, we would break our neck; but we believe that this would happen to us and therefore leave the room by the door, thus staying alive. The correctness or truth of our beliefs can not be supported by rational evidence and justified in this sense of the word . They can, however, be justified in the sense of pointing out their beneficial character7. It is this post-skeptical Hume who is of prime importance to Hamann and to Jacobi. Helped by the fact that " belief " can mean faith and can be translated by " Glaube ", both treat Hume's post-skeptical consequences as justification of faith and thus of religion. They know, of course, that this is not what Hume wanted to do; but they (especially Hamann) 7 For some, it seems easy to turn this idea into something like an unlimited eulogy of custom, as Belgion does at present (M. Belgion, David Humey London 1965). This is turning Hume into another Burke. 7 A clear account of the two strands, the skeptical and the non-skeptical in Hume can be found, e.g. in R. Popkin, David Hume: His Pyrrhonism and his Critique of Pyrrhonism , "The Philosophical Quarterly", 1 (1951), pp. 385-407, esp. pp. 399 f. R. Kemp Smith tried to prove that even within Hume's doctrine of belief (i.e. the assertion that what is generally taken to be cognition is nothing but mere belief) it is for Hume of prime importance to distinguish unwarranted beliefs from what according to Hume are non-warranted ones. This would mean that there would be a strand of non-skepticism even within the field of beliefs (The Philosophy of David Hume [1941], e.g., pp. 131 f.). Now, it is true that there is a tendency in Hume to make such a difference; and it would indeed be almost inconceivable that he would have never tried to establish the difference between superstition and belief. But precisely in the passage in which Hume tries to assert the difference between warranted and unwarranted beliefs, viz. Treatise I 4 (pp. 225 f. Selby- Bigge), he succeeds merely to the extent of applying the concept "natural" to some beliefs, naturalness then being the mark of warrantability, while refusing to apply it to others, unwarranted beliefs thus being marked as unnatural - but only to add: in a sense, all beliefs are natural. And a few lines later he says in substance that warranted and unwarranted beliefs are related to each other like health and malady (which seems to admit a pretty radical difference between the two) but feels compelled to add: even malady can be said to be natural - only that health is "most natural" (p. 226, lines 4 f. Selby-Bigge). Indeed, if the concept of "natural" admits of degrees, Kemp Smith would be correct in attributing to Hume a radical distinction between warranted and unwarranted beliefs; but does it? Don't we have before us a clear case of the misuse of the word "natural", here as so often chatoyant between its descriptive and its normative connotations. Cfr. the treatment of the whole problem especially in J. Laporte, Le scepticisme de Humey "Revue philosophique", 58 (1933), pp. 61-127; 59 (1934), pp. 161-225, esp. p. 221.</page><page sequence="4">484 PHILIP MERLAN treat him as unwilling and unconscious witness to truth. They know that Hume is an adversary of religion - be it positive, be it natural. But they obviously assume that they can refute Hume, the professed infidel, by Hume, the unconscious believer8. The pattern of their reasoning is very well expressed by a famous sentence of Pascal, used by Jacobi for the motto of his David Hume9. Reason, says Pascal, refutes the dogmatist; nature refutes the skeptic. Brilliant as Pascal's dictum is, when quoted by Jacobi it conceals behind its brilliancy a fundamental falsity. The way in which reason refutes the dogmatic differs toto cáelo from the way in which nature refutes the skeptic. Nature's "refutation" consists in preventing man from following reason. To say "dogmatic is false" (or: "doubt is always in order") and to say "you can't live as a skeptic" - these two sen- tences belong to different realms of discourse. Truth may be destructive to life - but it remains truth. Falsity may be useful (or: the belief in falsity may be forced on us despite all objections of reason) - yet it remains falsity. But Hamann and Jacobi speak as if Hume's acceptance of belief implied the recognition of its truth. As we noticed above, even today there are interpreters of Hume who read him in a spirit somewhat similar to that of Hamann and Jacobi. They interpret him as defender of nature, instinct, custom, tra- dition, etc. - all of which can be subsumed under the title of non- rational motivations of convictions (explicit and theoretical or implicit and practical). Now, if by "defense" is meant recognition of either util- ity of these motivations (or their effects on form of convictions), there is nothing to object to in such an interpretation. But very often a false note creeps in: the recognition of utility or irresistibility of certain convictions turns into recognition of their verity 10. To answer Hamann's « Hume needs faith to eat an egg or to drink a glass of water; why then doesn't he recognize the validity of faith in matters transcending eating and drinking? » we should say: Why he doesn't may be an interesting problem - but the fact is that he does not. And even if he did, defen- ders of faith in the traditional sense of the word would (or should) derive little comfort from it, because what Hume legitimately could grant * Cfr. my paper, From Hume to Hamann, "The Personalist 32 (1951), pp. 11-18. 9 David Hume über den Glauben ..., F. H. Jacobi, Werke , Vol. II, Leipzig 1815, pp. 1-310, esp. pp. 127 ff. Jacobi quotes from Hume's Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (edition London 1770). But he mentions the fact (p. 292) that Hamann was familiar with the Treatise of Human Nature , London 1739/40. Cfr. A. Henkel (ed.), Jobann Georg Hamann , Briefwechsel , Vol V, Frankfurt 1965, p. 210. 10 Sometimes a "liberal* interpretation of verity is suggested - verity not meeting the rigorous standards of knowledge.</page><page sequence="5">KANT, HAMANN- JACOBI AND SCHELLING ON HUME 485 to religious convictions would be only that they are useful or forced on us by some non-rational motives; what he would not grant is that these convictions were entitled to claim verity in the traditional sense of the word. Hamann and Jacobi made use of Hume's epistemological skepticism to elicit from it the recognition of the cognitive claims of religion. But it is well known that Hume dealt also directly with religion, regardless of his skepticism. His interest was directed partly toward natural religion, partly toward positive religions (including Christianity especially). The main document of the former is his Dialogues Concerning Natural Rel- igion, published posthumously in 1779. It was Hamann who immediately started translating it; and it is virtually certain that Kant studied this excerpt-translation just when he was writing his Critique of Pure Rea- son n. In fact, much in it can be interpreted as an adaptation of Hume's arguments. But it is again in the Prolegomena that we find the clearest expres- sion of Kant's attitude to Hume's Dialogues. Kant grants to Hume that he destroyed any kind of theism by showing that theism is necessarily connected with anthropomorphism, wich Kant - so less than Hume - utterly rejects. It is especially impossible, says Kant, to attribute to the Supreme Being human reason- ing or human will. But, so Kant continues, Hume did not succeed in refuting deism, i.e., according to Kant, a doctrine which assumes the existence of a Supreme Being but does not endow it with human qualit- ies. And in this context Kant defends the argument from design, after having reinterpreted its meaning in accordance with the main principles of his philosophy. These principles distinguish sharply between the realm of appearances, which can be experienced and therefore made an object of genuine knowledge, and the realm of noumena (things-in- themselves) which can not be experienced and known. Now, these two realms are divided by a boundary - but, as Kant says, a boundary equally belongs to both realms of which it happens to be the boundary. In other words, by indicating that the realm of phe- nomena has a boundary separating it from the realm of the noumena, we in some way understand (are able to think) the realm beyond the boundary - this boundary belonging to the realm of the experienceable 11 Cfr. D. J. Löwisch, Kants Kritik der reinen Vernunft und Hume's Dialo- gues Concerning Natural Religion, "Kantstudien", 56 (1966), pp. 170-207, and my own paper, Hamann et les Dialogues de Hume , "Revue de Métaphysique et de Morale", Vol. LIX (1954), pp. 285-289, which seems to have remained unknown to Löwisch. In this paper I tried to prove that two sections of the Critique of Pure Reason , viz. Von der Unmöglichkeit eines physikotheologischen Beweises and Vom Keinen, Wissen und Glauben , bear distinct traces of Hume's influence on Kant, probably via Hamann's precis of the Dialogues.</page><page sequence="6">486 PHILIP MERLAN but also to that of the unexperienceable. Therefore, we are permitted to speak of the Deity belonging to the realm of the -noumena - and even in anthropomorphic terms as long as we remain aware of the fact that the anthropomorphism in this case is, as Kant says, symbolic. Thus Kant defends the watch: watchmaker-universe: Supreme Being proportion - he only explains that by this proportion we do not undertake to describe the nature of God as He is in Himself (i.e., as a noumenon), but only in His relation to the world of experience of which man himself is part. We therefore are permitted to interpret the world as if (Kant's italics) it were the work of a Supreme Being and thus satisfy "Vernunft" , which is never satisfied with mere experience. Kant sums up his objections to Hume: he forgot that the field of experience does not bound itself in the eyes of our reason. In other words, Kant is convinced that by denying the knowability of things in themselves he at the same time established - shall we call it quasi-knowledge? And he is convinced that only by treating the universe as if it were the work of a Supreme Being, quasi-intelligent and quasi-possessing a quasi-will, can we satisfy the le- gitimate demands of our reason ( Vernunft ), which otherwise would find the universe inexplicable. The noumenal is not, as Kant says, an object of experience, but it the ground of all experience 12. As Kant sees it, this is the way to refute materialism which is dogmatic in its denial of the existence of a noumenal world. We see that Kant overcame the epistemological skepticism of Hume by limiting our knowledge to the realm of experience, within which dogmatic certainty is indeed possible - this certainty bought at the price that it gives us a knowledge of phenomena only. And as the ex- istence of phenomena presupposes, in the eyes of Kant, the existence of noumena, Hume's skepticism is limited again by admitting that nou- mena can not be known in the same way in which phenomena are, but that a quasi-knowledge of them and their use as regulative ideas is permissible. So much about the response to Hume as critic of natural religion. As to Hume's attitude toward positive religions (including Christian- ity) we can safely say that Hume simply rejects them without giving them the benefit of recognizing their utility, irresistibility, etc. And why should he? Whoever reads the Abstract realizes that Hume was intensely proud to prove that what has always been considered a matter of reason was nothing but a matter of custom, instinct, habit, etc. 13. But in ap- proaching the field of positive religion he found the recognition of non- 12 Prolegomena, par. 57-59. 13 See esp. p. 24 (with its repeated "nothing but"). Here also the Pascalian sentence: Philosophy would render us entirely Pyrrhonian, were not nature too strong for it.</page><page sequence="7">KANT, HAMANN- JACOBI AND SCHELLING ON HUME 487 rational motivation of convictions (faith, acceptance of revelation, etc.) built in, if we may say so, into the very foundation of religious con- victions. What could interest him was only the claim to verity which these convictions raised. Having rejected it, there was no reason for him to go any further. More on Hume's History will be said later. Schelling's attitude towards Hume differs from either that of Hegel or that of Hamann-Jacobi. Before proceeding with this let us say a few words on Schelling's attitude toward England and English philosophy in general. Very early in his life Schelling exhibited his (or his preceptor's) profound admiration of England. It expressed itself in a Latin poem, Ad Angliam , written c. 1788, when Schelling, a precocious genius if there ever was one, was twelve 14. Here, among the names of other great men produced by England (Milton, Thomson, Shakespeare, Franklin, Cook) that of Hume also appears. Thus, his name was familiar to Schel- ling from his earliest years. But, of course, Schelling retained his interest in English philosophy and in Hume also in his later years. As many other had, so he also interpreted the history of English philosophy in terms of its turning away from Cartesian rationalism towards empiricism. But he felt entitled to express the hope that this would change and that England would open herself to idealism 15, espe- cially of his own brand. This hope was quite obviously based on the fact that his ideas had been appropriated by Coleridge 16 - as is gener- ally known - , appropriated to the point of plagiarism. The classic and well known documents of this plagiarism are contained in Coleridge's Biographia Literaria (1817) 17 . 14 Only a handful of disticha from the poem has been published in G. L. Plitt, Aus Sckellings Leben in Briefen , Vol. II, Leipzig 1869/70, pp. 16-18. They attracted the attention of, and were translated by, the well known Hegelian J. H. Stirling ( Schelling on England , "The Journal of Speculative Philosophy", 19 [1885], pp. 103-106). An additional poem by Schelling, in Greek hexameters and on the same topic, is just mentioned by Plitt. 15 Philosophie der Mythologie , 2. Buch, Zwölfte Vorlesung (V 459 Schröter = XI 227 f. Schelling). 16 It is significant that in the passage quoted above Schelling approvingly mentions Coleridge's criticism of British empiricism. 17 I am sorry that I was unable to avail myself of G. Marcel's thesis dealing with the influence of Schelling on Coleridge. And unfortunately, the full history of Schelling's influence on English intellectual life is still unwritten. As far as his aesthetic ideas are concerned, H. Read, The True Voice of Feeling (containing a new translation of Schelling's Über das Verhältnis der bildenden Künste zur Natur) gives Schelling full credit for authoring the concept of organic form, central to</page><page sequence="8">488 PHILIP MERLAN Schelling's reaction was very characteristic. It is expressed in his Philosophie der Mythologie (VI 198 = XI 196, note). Schelling excuses Coleridge in most generous terms ( einem wirklich con genialen Mann sollte man dergleichen nicht anrechnen) 18. After all, Coleridge, so says Schel- ling, is the first Englishman to understand and make full use of German (read: my) philosophy. But Schelling is fully aware (as most English interpreters of Cole- ridge don't seem to be) that Coleridge's indebtedness to him is not limited to the Biographia Literaria. In 1818 Schelling published his U eher die Gottheiten von Samothrake , a writing which, he complains, was not understood in Germany. However, in Coleridge's On the Pro- metheus of Aeschylus (1825) he found himself fully understood (read probably: once more copied). And on the occasion of this writing, Schel- ling says that if Coleridge ever contracted some debt towards him, he fully repaid it by coining the term "tautegoric" which he used to assert that myths are indeed tautegoric and should not be explained as allego- ries - a point which indeed was one of Schelling's main points in his philosophy of mythology 19. But in the same work in which Schelling obviously tried to keep Coleridge - if I may use a wild metaphor - as a bridgehead for himself he also paid full attention to Hume. However, it is not Hume's skepticism which attracted his attention this time. It was rather Hume, outright critic of positive religions, who became of interest to Schelling. Not that Schelling was ever unaware of Hume's epistemological skepticism and its importance. In his Zur Geschichte der neueren Philo- sophie he presents it (V 145-148 = X 75-78) 20 and criticizes it by the immanent argument: wenn Gewohnheit nötig ist, damit wir ein post hoc für ein propter hoc halten, sollte es denkbar sein, dass es eine Zeit im Leben des Einzelnen oder der Menschheit gegeben hat, worin was wir für Kausal halten, für bloss aufeinanderfolgend gehalten haben? Dreht sich nicht das neugeborene Kind um, um die Ursache eines Geräusches zu erspähen? But Schelling, the theologian, is interested in another aspect of Hume's English literary criticism in the romantic age. E. D. Hirsch, Wordsworth and Schelling , New Haven 1960, is interested in problems completely different from those treated here. 18 One wonders whether Schelling would have been equally generous, had Cole- ridge plagiarized somebody else. 19 Werkey vol. VI 198 Schröter - XI 196 Schelling. On Coleridge's highly ambiguous attitude towards Schelling see R. Wellek, Immanuel Kant in England , Princeton 1931, esp. pp. 95-102. 20 Cfr. 2te Abt. Bd. I, 278. I am quoting the text as it appears in the edition by H. E. Root, Stanford 1957.</page><page sequence="9">KANT, HAMANN-JACOBI AND SCHELLING ON HUME 489 philosophy, as it expressed itself in the latter's Natural History of Religion. Let us review Hume's History briefly. The fundamental idea underlying Hume's book is this: Whoever is able to perceive the order, the design, and the finality pervading the universe will infer the existence of one deity - omnipotent, benevolent, creator of the universe, perfectly good and just21. But primitive minds are unable to perceive that order. What attracts their attention are irregularities, monsters, catastrophies, etc. 71 . The only explanation of all these kinds of disorders is the assumption of a plurality of divinities. One can easily see that in his History Hume speaks like a convinced deist, and that he unhesitatingly accepts the argument from design - the same argument which, in the Dialogues , Philo (or perhaps Hume himself) will devastatingly criticize22*. Being the result of a primitive mind, polytheism is in fact no religion in the proper sense of the world. It should be called superstitious atheism or a species of daemonism23. And even some traces of mono- theism, if arrived at not by the kind of reasoning which is the foun- dation of natural religion (rational worship), are in truth products of most vulgar superstition24. It is obvious that Hume's criticism is directed also against Christian- ity to the extent that Christianity added something to the tenets of natural religion. His examples of such additions Hume preferably takes from Catholicism 25 , and in one passage he pays tribute to Christianity without any qualification26. But it is obvious that he here simply equates "true" Christianity with natural religion - as did other English deists before him. 21 Introduction, p. 1 Root ("the whole frame of nature bespeaks an intelligent author*); ch. I, p. 24 Root (belief in such an author is a "magnificent opinion"); p. 26 ("one single being ... bestowed existence and order on this vast machine"); the idea that "several independent beings" could be responsible for this - preci- sely what Philo suggests in the Dialogues - would be an entirely "arbitrary sup- position" (ibid.); ch.

One is reminded of Kant, a deist if there ever was any (in the most succinct form in Zum ewigen Frieden , Erster Zusatz, § 2, note: there is only one religion just as there is only one morality), who delivers a spirited defense of "true" Christianity and equates the corruption of Christianity (by becom-</page><page sequence="10">400 PHILIP MERLAN Why should a book with this content be of interest to the author of Philosophie der Mythologie? Let us make a brief examination of the relevant passages in Schel- ling 21 . The theme of the first eight chapters of Philosophie der Mythologie can succintly be stated thus: mythology - far from being simply the product of man's mind, an invention of the poet or the philosopher, of an individual or of a nation {Volk) - is essentially theogony28. In this sense of the word, mythology is true - true not in the sense of ideas agreeing with facts, but true in the sense of being a real event29. In and through mythology God becomes what He is (or, as Schelling trans- lates Exodus 3: 14: God says of Himself: « I shall be He who will be »J30. Nevertheless Schelling tries to show that in some way God is, at the same time, exempt from any (théogonie) process. Whether he suc- ceds in reconciling these two points of view need not detain us here31. We concentrate, rather, on the théogonie aspects. The first phase of this théogonie process is monotheism - but a monotheism which precedes history. Its two successive variants are mo- notheism as belief in one God who, however, is not even known as the true and only God. The second phase is the belief in one God who, however, could become the first in a series of successive gods, i.e. a God who contains the potentiality of polytheism within himself. He is believed as one God and not many , i.e. a God who is relatively one, whereas in the former variant of monotheism he was the absolutely one32. ing authoritarian instead of remaining liebenswürdig) with the coming of Anti- Christ (Das Ende aller Dinge , concluding paragraph). 27 What follows is based on: Einleitung in die Philosophie der Mythologie, Erstes Buch , Historisch-kritische Einleitung in die Philosophie der Mythologie , Wer- ke, vol. VI, pp. 1-229 Schröter = vol. XI, pp. 1-227 Schelling, i.e. the first nine lectures (chapters). The Arabic numbers in the footnotes will refer to the pages of these two editions; reference to the volumes will be omitted. 28 87 = 85; 124 f. = 122 f. 29 69 = 67; 195-197 = 193-195; 216 = 214. 30 79 = 77. 173 - 171 f. 31 83 = 81. Here Schelling speaks of the event or revelation in such a man- ner that we are led to believe that God remains unaffected by this event (cfr. also 214 = 212). But a number of passages clearly proves the opposite, so espe- cially 200 = 198. Cfr. 106 f. = 104 f. (...Gott... sich selbst ungleich und wan- delbar geworden); 126 f. = 124 f. (die auf einander folgenden Götter haben sich des Bewusstseins wirklich nacheinander bemächtigt); 132 = 130 (Gott muss von Gestalt zu Gestalt fortgehen); 191 = 189 (Gott ist ebenso mehrere wie Einer); 200 = 198 (Mythologie ist wirkliches Werden Gottes im Bewusstsein). 32 85 = 83. He often refers to one of its phases as relative monotheism (129 f. = 127 f.). This relative monotheism is "preceded" by absolute monotheism:</page><page sequence="11">KANT, HAMANN- JACOBI AND SCHELLING ON HUME 491 Both these variants of monotheism which, as we said, belong to the prehistoric time, are followed by actual polytheism, especially successive polytheism, i.e. polytheism which assumes a sequence of divine "dyna- sties"33 - an idea most familiar to us from Hesiod's Theo gony, but occurring also in non-Greek mythologies. And it is by professing this or that kind of mythology that mankind, which in its prehistoric stage form- ed one undifferentiated unity, becomes divided into peoples (Völker)*. Only after this event has taken place history and historic time begins. Therefore, in history polytheism is the first and original religion of man - though this polytheism is destined to develop into true mono- theism of the future. Obviously Schelling considers Christianity with its concept of a trinitarian God to be the synthesis of prehistoric monotheism with polytheism. Therefore, polytheism is not simply a false religion; it is rather a necessary moment of and in the complete théogonie process - false only in the sense of being onesided35. The original monotheism, whether absolute or relative is, however, "preceded" by another phase, viz. the relation between God and the original, archetypal, non-empirical man, in which relation the preempir- ical man posits God in the sense that he is not conscius of God but rather is God's consciousness: it is his nature to be God-positing. Thus, from historic time we ascend to prehistoric time, and have now arrived at the transhistoric "time" or a- temporal time (a non- temporal prius). The monotheism of this transhistoric phase Schelling sometimes calls blind monotheism, sometimes simply theism, this last term to indicate that it "precedes" (in a non-temporal sense) both monotheism and poly- theism36. Only now we have described all the moments of the théogonie process. And as we have seen, Schelling on one hand asserts the relative truth of polytheism and blames only polytheists who embrace some par- ticular brand of polytheism, thus constituting themselves as a people (Volk) to the exclusion of everything else and thus commit the error of onesidedness 37, an idea familiar to us as Hegelian, but here expressed by Schelling as if it were entirely his38. On the other hand, Schelling insists that precisely because the origin of polytheism (or rather: poly- the true God (Urgott) is worshipped, but he is not yet known as the true one. See 142 f. = 141 f.; 146 f. = 144 f.; 157 = 155; 175 = 173. See also 92 f. = 90 f.; 106= 104. 33 122 f. = 120 f. 34 64-68 = 62-66; 94 f. = 92 f.; 96-120 = 94-118. 35 183 f. = 181 f.; 138 = 137 (cfr. also note 37); 214 = 212 (monotheism of the future or esoteric monotheism: 76 = 74). 36 186 f. = 184. 37 213 f. = 211 f. 38 Another Hegelianism: 76 = 74 (error is not complete lack of truth). There- fore Schelling disagrees with Hume, who interprets polytheism as atheism instead of seeing in it an erroneous kind of theism (76 f. = 74 f.; 80 f. = 78 f.; 85 = 83).</page><page sequence="12">492 PHILIP MERLAN theism) and the origin of history coincide, in history polytheism is not preceded by monotheism39. And it is mainly because of Hume's assertion that we find polytheism professed by all nations - no matter how far back we go in history - that Schelling quotes him40. It is false, according to Hume, to interpret polytheism as corruption of mankind's original monotheism. With the whole optimism of the enlightened era Hume declares that it is next to impossible to assume that mankind should have fallen into error after having once discovered truth, i.e., monotheism41. And Schelling celebrates Hume as having been the first to assert the priority of polytheism over monotheism42. Now, it is obvious that Schelling's concepts of a transhistorical and a prehistorical time are entirely foreign to Hume. It is furthermore obvious that Hume is by no means willing to assume two periods of polytheism, only the second of which would be "superstitious atheism "43. All he says is that it is in the nature of polytheism to divinize human beings; but Schelling speaks as if Hume had seen in this divinization something like a turning point in polytheism44. In his way, Schelling does to Hume's ideas almost as much violence as Hamann does in his way; which is perhaps not surprising if we remember that Schelling was a great admirer of Hamann. By attributing to Hume the doctrine of a "better" and a "worse" kind of polytheism Schelling obviously tries to elicit from Hume the admission that polytheism is not simply and un- conditionally an error and a false religion. We have already mentioned that, according to Schelling, nations (Völker) originate by adopting a peculiar kind of mythology. But before the division of mankind into nations has taken place there is no history at all; it is only after the "disintegration" of mankind into nations that history begins. But are there no "nations" ( Völker ) which have no mythology (or, as we would say, no religion) at all? Schelling admits the possibility; but he refuses to call these entities "nations", i.e., societies, the honorific designation of nations45. Cfr. also 141 = 139 (...ein Gericht ergeht überall... über das Relativ-wahre und das Einseitige, das für allseitig genommen wird) and 211 f. = 209 f. 39 183 f. = 181 f. 40 184 f. = 182 f. 41 For which he is criticized by Schelling: 81-83 = 79-81. 42 85 = 83. 43 75 f. = 73 i 44 71 = 69. The turn is supposed to be from polytheism to mythology. All Hume says is however that hero-worship is one of the forms of polytheism (ch. V, p. 39 Root). 45 65 f. = 63 f.; 74 = 72; 114 f. = 112 f.</page><page sequence="13">KANT, HAMANN- JACOBI AND SCHELLING ON HUME 493 Now, strangely enough, towards the end of Hume's Natural History we find this sentence: « Look out for a people [obviously the equivalent of Volk], entirely destitute of religion: If you find them at all, be assured, that they are but a few degrees removed from the brutes ». What an unexpected recognition of religion in a writing devoted to the most vitriolic criticism of all positive religions! Could it be, however, that Schelling's attention was attracted to precisely this passage because it introduced the concept of a people destitute of all religion, i.e., in Schelling's terms, of all mythology which, precisely for this lack of mythology, should really not be honored by the designation of a people? Such a people, according to Schelling, would not belong to the course of history. They would still live in the prehistoric phase - because there is no history previous to the origin of peoples (Völker), but, as we have seen, a Volk comes into existence only by embracing a certain religion (-mythology). Thus, the range of German responses to Hume was varied and wide. On the whole, they represent several attempts to modify and as- similate rather than to refute his doctrines.
