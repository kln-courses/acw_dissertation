<plain_text><page sequence="1">235 SOME OCCURRENCES OF THE CORN-'aruseh IN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN TOMB PAINTINGS BY WINIFRED S. BLACKMAN (RESEARCH STUDENT IN ANTHROPOLOGY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD) In the magnificent volume in the Tytus Memorial Series on the Tomb of Nakht at Thebes, recently published by Mr. N. DE G. DAVIES for the Metropolitan Museum of Artl, there is included among the various harvesting scenes one depicting the grain being winnowed2 (P1. XXVI, fig. b). The chief point of interest in this last mentioned scene is the inverted crescent-shaped object at the top of the brown semicircle, which represents the edge of the winnowing floor. Mr. DAVIES is the first archaeologist to draw attention to this object, and the importance of his discovery leads me to quote in full his remarks on the subject. I am also indebted to Mr. DAVIES for kindly permitting me to make use of his illustrations for this paper. Mr. DAVIES comments at some ler ngto on this particular object ad pts forward various suggestions as to its significance. Under the inverted crescent is a red vase, the crescent itself, so Mr. DAVIES maintains, having been black in colour and in shape most resembling the hieroglyphic form of the crescent moon (-)3. Mr. DAVIES here adds a footnote stating that the moon itself is generally depicted with the concave side of the crescent uppermost and is colored yellow. The black tint here used might indicate the shadowed orb out of which the new moon is born as an invisible streak of light; but it might also be due to a confusion with the similar word-sign for the black cob of the carob4." Mr. DAVIES suggests that the cup contains offerings laid before a deity, and that "'the texts in the other tombs leave little doubt that the picture depicts the harvest festival at the turn of the month when Ernutet was specially worshipped. As the object of worship bears no possible resemblance to Ernutet, the conclusion is that the offerings are laid before either the waxing or waning moon5." In another footnote6 Mr. DAVIES puts forward suggestions based on evidence obtained from parallel scenes in other New Kingdom tombs at Thebes. He says: "The original design may be lost to us, but the Tomnb of Nakht seems to be nearest the source. In Tomb 38 a whole wall is dedicated to the harvest. In the lowest register the agricultural scenes on P1. XXI are repeated with some variations. In the top register men are measuring the standing corn. In the middle register men are bringing produce to their master, who sits in a kiosk. At the other end Joserkerasonb makes a burnt offering (1) to Amon New York, 1917. 2 Tomb of Nalcht, PI.

The accompanying inscription is as follows: The scribe of the corn [of Amon] Joserkere, offering all manner of good and pure food [to Amon] in every shrine of his on this day of the measurement of the sek grain of tlhe twenty- seventh day of the fourth month of springtimne (the eighth of the year) in the island (ma . ut) of Ernutet?, whose x is on the threshing floor (? kah),' x being a sign consisting of a crescent over a solid triangle A and thus closely resembling the mysterious group, which is again depicted here. Either deliberately, or because it was misunderstood, t.he ends of the crescent are fringed, as if they were wings, and a row of red spots is painted on the blackish body' (P1. XXVII, fig. a). The swelling in the center has become a protuberance into which the ears of corn have been talen up from the dish. The whole in short, seems treated as a winged thing too swiftly swooping to have defined shape or color, and it is conceivable that the first crow that carried off the offeringT was transformed by popular superstition into a gratified divinity." " Similarly in the sculptured Tomb no. 57 (Khaemhet), two scenes come into con- sideration. In one (PRISsE, Mlontunents, P1. XLII), a burnt offering is made by Khaemhet to Ernutet, who is pictured as a snake-headed goddess seated on a throne and suckling a boy. The inscription is ' Khaemhet offering all things good and pure to Ernutet, lady of the granary, on the first day of the first month of summer (the ninth month of the year), this day of the birth of Nepy.' Here again we have that somewhat rare thing in tomb-scenes, a date, and the fixing of the festival depicted to the appearance of the new month or the new moon in the arms of the old. (In the contemporary Tomb 48 a similar figure of Ernutet is associated with the twenty-seventh day of the eighth month, harvest day according to Tomb 38.) The festival thus seems to have lasted four or five days. On the first of them the standing corn was measured by the officials that the yield might be estimated and the tithes assessed. Then the corn was cut and trodden out, and at the winnowing on the first of the new month offerings were made to the divinities concerned." "A second scene in this tomb shows the harvest field, and here many of the incidents are obviously taken from the same source as those of Nakht (PEISSE, L'Art Eyptien, II, P1. 20); among them the winnowing scene. The offering to the divinity of harvest is set at the side of the floor, there being no room above it2. The gifts are more generous, but the strange object of veneration is almost exactly the same as in Tomb 38, save that it is set upright and that the protuberance seems to be more definitely conceived as two grasping hands, which have seized the ears of corn and removed them from the dishes3. The spots are also more pronounced. For a later association of the snake-goddess with the harvest and also with the moon see WEBER, Agyptischi-griechiscie Terrakotten, pp. 42-44, 177." Mr. DAVIES suggests4 as the only other alternative explanation which he can give that the mysterious object in Tomb 38 and 57 is "the rude form of a bird or man, whether intended as a scarecrow or a god of harvest, or both in one, formed out of a sheaf of corn or straw and daubed with clay to give stiffening and admit of hands being affixed. As Nepy is sometimes depicted with a sheaf on his head, it would have a rude See Tomb of Nakht, fig.. 11, p. 63. 2 See fig. b, P1. XXVIIT. 3 See Tomb of Nakht, p. 63, fig. 12 and fig. b, P1.

In certain rites of the sed festival1 at Soleb the muffled figure of the king is seen receivi ears of corn in his shands in exactly the same way as here. I have seen a rude male figure, made as I have suggested, set up on the edge of the cornfield in modern Thebes, apparently as a guardian spirit, since I saw at the same time a mannikin nailed over the door of the village grinding mill. But we should have to assume that either the artist of Nakht or the other copyists misinterpreted the original design, since in our tomb it is obviously not the representation of such a figure'." Mr. DAVIES finishes his discussion of this obscure point as follows: " It only now remains to add that these two detailed representations of harvest, and of a vulgar act of worship which the owners of the tombs were perhaps half ashamed to depict, are due to the professional interest of these men in the subject, one being a registrar of corn and the other a superintendent of granaries. Perhaps Nakht, too, had close official connection with the corn supply, since he was concerned as a serving-priest with the supply of loaves to the private altars2." I had the opportunity of seeing Mr. DAVIEs' publication on the Tomb of Nakht before my return to Egypt last autumn. It immediately occurred to me that this, to him, mysterious representation, was probably nothing more nor less than the " corn-maiden " so well known all over Europe. I thought it prudent, however, before bringing forward my suggestion in print, to see if any such form of corn-maiden still existed in modern Egypt. For several months I made my head quarters in the little village of El-Lahun in the Fayum. I lived in my servant's house, and hanging up in the room which was used as the store-room I saw what appears to me to be a similar object to that represented in the Tomb of Nalkht at Thebes and in the New Kingdom Tombs, nos. 38 and 57. In modern Egypt this object is called the 'ariuseh (bride), and the particular form which I saw at El-Lahuin is also to be found in other parts of Egypt3. In outline it bears a strong resemblance to the objects discussed by MIr. DAVIES. It is made out of the finest ears of corn which are plucked before the corn is cut and plaited into this form. The airuseh is often hung up in the house, usually in the room in which the stores of food are kept, to bring prosperity in general to the house and to ensure a plentiful supply of food. The grain is sometimes taken from the 'aruseh and mixed with the seed sown in the following year to secure a good harvest. Again, the 'artseh may be kept in the house till it drops to pieces, when it is replaced by a new one at harvest time. A shop-keeper, if he does not own a field, will purchase an 'arliseh to hang in his shop as a charm to bring him plenty of customers and thereby ensure him prosperity. P1. XXVIII shows a shop entrance with the 'aratseh hanging in the centre4. This shop in question is at Hawara, a village adjoining that of El-Lahun. An owner of land will sometimes go to the tomb of a sheikh and offer up prayers for a plentiful harvest, promising him that if his petition is granted he will present a corn-'aruaseh to him as a votive offering. I have seen such an object hanging up in the tomb of a sheikh at Dimishkin in Fayuim province. The following information I obtained from Meir in Asyut province, and I was told that such beliefs are prevalent all over that district. Here the owner of cornfields will 1 Op. cit., p. 65. 2 Op. cit., pp. 65-66. 3 See fig. a, P1. XXVI. 4 The 'ar-2seh in this photograph looks as if it were of a different shape to the other modern examples; this is merely due to the fact that the wind twisted it round just as I took the snap-shot. 237</page><page sequence="6">WINIFRED S. BLACKMAN place the 'aruseh in the centre of heaps of corn to ensure a further plentiful supply. The ancient pictures showing the 'aritseh on the winnowing floor suggests that such an idea was prevalent in those times. In this province, as in the Favuim, it is hung up by people in their houses as a charm for prosperity. On the day of Shemm-e -nasim, the Coptic Easter Monday, the 'artseh hanging in the house is sometimes decorated with roses. I was told that it is also occasionally decorated with ribbons, though, I gather, not necessarily on the day of Shemm-en-nastm. In view of the very conservative character of the Egyptians and the number of survivals which still exist in the country it seems to be quite possible that the mystery surrounding the figures b, P1. XXVI and a and b, PI. XXVII, taken from the harvest scenes in the New Kingdom tombs at Thebes can be solved by comparison with modern custom. The outline of these forms, as I have pointed out before, is very similar to that of the modern corn-'aruiseh in fig. a, P1. XXVI. The frayed ends in fig. a and b, P1. XXVII probably represent the stalks of the corn, the heads of the wheat also standing out horizontally on either side of the central projection, instead of hanging vertically as in the modern examples. The projection is possibly a conventionalised form of the ears of corn seen in the specimens I collected, fig. b, PI. XXVI. P1. XVIII in Thle Tomb of UNakht shows a still more conventionalised treatment, no details of the ears of corn being represented. The ears of corn in fig. a and b, P1. XXVII, which Mr. DAVIES says hiave been taken up from the dish, are, I suggest, merely part and parcel of the corn-'ariuseh, the so-called ' hand " in fig. b, P1. XXVII, being a conventionalised drawing of the ears of corn, which roughly are in he f t he form of the protuberance, in the modern examples. The dish which Mr. DAVIES suggests may contain offerings, possibly holds water as a charm to ensure a plentiful supply of that commodity, thereby preserving the life of the crops. In fig. b, P1. XXVII there is a water bottle and also offerings of bread. In modern Egypt the winnowing is always done out of doors, and when the process is completed the heaps of grain are left on the winnowing floor for one night. The owner of the grain will then take some of the usual flat, round loaves of bread and stick them at intervals in among the grain, where they are left till the morning when they become the perquisite of the man who carries the grain to the owner's granaries. I have found this to be the custom in the Fayum, aid it may also exist in other parts of Egypt. Possibly it is a survival from early times when definite offerings of bread were made to a corn-goddess, or to the ancient corn-'arKuseh as in fig. b, P1. XXVII. I may mention further that it is considered a meritorious act for the owner of a cornfield to present some of the first-fruits to the nmueddin? of the village mosque, to the mtzeyyiin (barber) and to a few very poor men who are known to be of high character; some may also be presented to the village zummareh-player (piper). This custom can be parallelled in ancient Egypt. In the second of the famous Contracts of Defaihapl engraved on the walls of his tomb chapel at Asynut the following passage occurs: ' T7iat which he (IDefaihap) gave to thenm (the staff of the temple of Upwawet at Asyut) in return (i. e. for bread presented to his statue) wtas one heka'et of northern barley for everyfield of the endozvment (pr-dt), from the first-fruits of the harvest of the nomarch's estate, just as (or, 'in the measure which ') every common man of Siut gives of the first-fruits of his harvest, for he wvas the first to cautse every one of his peasaints to give it to this temple from the first-fruits of his field." 1 See RETSNER, The Tomh of Helpsefa, Nomlarch of Si,,t in Journal V, 83. 238</page><page sequence="7">Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, Vol. VIII SHOP IN HAWARA WITH CORN-'aruseh HUNG FROM THE LINTEL Plate XXVIII</page><page sequence="8">SOME OCCURRENCES OF THE CORN-'araseh The offering of first-fruits to the mueddin is perhaps a survival of the custom referred to in the above quotation, the mueddin and the mosque taking the place of priests and temple. The custom of presenting- the first-fruits in the form of a corn-'ariseh to a dead sheikh, also alluded to above, may likewise be a survival of a custom practised in ancient Egypt. Fig. c, P1. XXVII shows the mueddin of one of the mosques at el-Lahun returning home on his donkey with some of the first-fruits which have been presented to him. Since writing the above Mr. HENRY BALFOUR has drawn my attention to harvest trophies of very similar form to the Egyptian corn-'arauseh from South-Eastern Europe. He also informs me that this type of " corn-maiden " (as it is often called in Europe), is characteristic of the whole Mediterranean area. Mr. BALFOUR has kindly permitted me to have two of the specimens, now in the Pitt-Rivers Museum, photographed to illustrate this paper. P1. XXIX, fig. a shows a " harvest trophy " from Larnaca in Cyprus, presented to the Pitt-Rivers Museum in 1898 by Mr. E. T. ELWORTHY according to the label. It hung in the entrance to a house of the landowner and was given to Mr. ELWORTHY because the harvest was nearly ripe, when another would be brought from the fields and hung up in the same place; it was " considered a porta fortuna, Cyprus people considered it a first-fruit." Apparently the virtue attached to the "harvest trophy" in Cyprus is very similar to one of those claimed by the Egyptians for their "corn-'aruse " -i. e. that it brings good luck to its possessor. Here also in Cyprus as in Egypt, it is made out of the first-fruits of the field. P1. XXTX, fig. b represents a " corn-sheaf trophy " from Dulcigno district, Monte- negro. This specimen was purchased by the Museum in 1907. I have not been able to find any further information on the corn-maidens from these two countries, in spite of diligent search through a vast amount of literature. However, the chief interest lies in the fact that the form of the two objects illustrated is strikingly similar to those found in Egypt in the present day, and also, presumably, to those in use in that country in ancient times. I may mention that, as in Cyprus, the corn-'araseh in Egypt is sometimes hung above the entrance of a private house. I have seen the doors of two or three houses thus decorated in a village street, but lack of sunlight made it impossible to get a satisfactory photograph. In view of the fact that this particular form of harvest trophy was in use in Egypt in very early times (always provided that I am right in my explanation of the " mysterious object" depicted in the Tomb of Nakht), it would seen possible that a similar type of "corn-maiden" was imposed on the Mediterranean area by Egypt. I am not aware if it is possible to trace back the use of such a trophy to an early date in the former area. The harvest trophies preserved from the first or last sheaf of corn in most European countries, are, sd far as I know, of an entirely different form to those described in this paper. Thus the Egyptian type of corn-'ariseh appears to be confined to Egypt and the Mediterranean countries. 'aruseh in Egyptian Arabic has several meanings. Primarily it means a bride; it is also the usual word for a doll. The same name, 'aruseh, is also applied to ornaments, such an ornament, for example, as is attached to a door to decorate it. I have been told that the reason why this term is applied to such ornaments is that they are beautiful, like a bride. 239</page><page sequence="9">240 WINIFRED S. BLACKMAN Professor J. L. MYRES has suggested to me that the Egyptian corn-'ariuseh shows signs of an anthropomorphic origin. It may therefore represent a girl, as is the care with our own "corn-maiden." Hence the name 'aruseh min el-.kam. "the bride from the corn," probably meaning " made out of the corn." DESCRIPTION OF PLATES Plate 2XrVI F-ig. a. Two modern corn-'ariis from Egypt.
