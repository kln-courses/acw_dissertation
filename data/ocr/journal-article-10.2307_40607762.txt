<plain_text><page sequence="1">Thomas Hobbes's Influence on David Hume: The Emergence of a Public Choice Tradition By Laurence S. Moss* In an article that appeared in this journal more than a decade ago, I named the seventeenth-century philosopher Thomas Hobbes a pioneer-founder of "public choice economics."1 Both Hobbes and contemporary public-choice theorists are interested in finding institu- tional methods for overcoming the free-rider problem which makes collective action often difficult and sometimes impossible to accom- plish. I suggested that Hobbes's interest in decision making in large group situations colored many of his specific ideas about political and social organization. The purpose of this new article is to extend that research by tracing Hobbes's influence on David Hume and documenting that Hume also analyzed the prospects for social cooperation in terms of group size. Hobbes's influence is especially apparent in book 3 of Hume's Treatise of Human Nature, where the basic organizing principles of commercial society are analyzed.2 There we find that the problem of enforcing rules about property, contract performance, and collective action requires government involvement and, indeed, that it is the intervention of ministers and politicians that transforms rules first adopted for convenience and expediency into rules that promote both prosperity and moral virtue in large prospering societies.3 It is not usual to consult Hobbes for insights about the structure and content of Hume's thought. Among historians of philosophical thought it is more common to contrast Hobbes, "the egoist," with Hume, a proponent of the "moral sense school," thereby suggesting that the two philosophers had little in common.4 I shall not overturn This article was first published in History of Political Economy, Vol. 13, ps. 587-612.

Here Hobbes's influence on Hume is quite unmistakable.5 I build on Paul Russell's work. In 1985 Russell established that Hobbes was one of the most important influences on Hume.6 Inasmuch as some of Hume's strongest admirers seldom mention Hobbes at all, Russell's argument now opens a new chapter in Hume scholarship. Perhaps the boldest of Russell's claims is that Hume consciously patterned his Treatise of Human Nature after Hobbes's Elements of Law and that an "important and unique" relationship exists between the two masterworks.7 Indeed the parallels between the two are both significant and obvious enough to raise the puzzling question why other Hume scholars have missed the Hobbes link so completely.8 Russell attributes the oversight to Hume himself, who was not writing at the most tolerant of times in history and probably thought it prudent not to flaunt the Hobbes connection too openly among his contemporaries.9 Hume did, however, openly declare his debt to Bernard Mande ville, and by this a link to Hobbes was no doubt suspected.10 In discussion below I identify the closeness of reasoning that exists between Hobbes's and Hume's respective accounts of (1) the origin of property-rights structures, (2) the strategic problems inherent in con- tracting and the salutory role played by government in promoting contracting, and (3) the positive role that collective action backed by the coercive power of the state can play in promoting material welfare. At the outset, let me distinguish my thesis from the one Milton Myers developed in his stimulating study The Soul of Modern Eco- nomic Man}1 Myers describes late seventeenth- and eighteenth- century intellectual thought as a reaction to the extreme reductionist view of human nature advanced by Hobbes. As is typical among political scientists, he treats the writers of the "moral school" as adversaries of Hobbes. Hume is mentioned only incidentally, but Smith is accused of backsliding toward Hobbes and the "jaundiced view" of human nature. An earlier study by the economist William Allen also contrasts Hobbes with Hume. Allen argues that Hobbes raised certain problems that Hume, using alternative methods of reasoning, was better able to solve.12 Allen's thesis has been</page><page sequence="3">400 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology developed further in a remarkable monograph by Michael Taylor.13 My thesis is closer to Allen's and Taylor's than to Myers's. I maintain that Hobbes raised basic problems about social and economic organization and, at the same time, provided many of the principal analytic tools that Hume and later "anti-Hobbesian" thinkers came to employ. I do not deny that to the extent that later writers such as Richard Cumber- land, Lord Shaftesbury, Francis Hutcheson, David Hume, and Adam Smith interpreted Hobbes as stating that only self-interest motivates man, they sharply disagreed and pioneered alternative approaches.14 What I argue here is that with regard to Hume's ideas about the creation and enforcement of the rules by which modern commercial society operates, Hobbes's influence is positive and unmistakable. One point I wish to establish is that Hume's distinction between what is possible in small, populated societies and what is possible in large commercial settings owes directly to the analysis pioneered by Hobbes. Property-Rights Structures Hobbes's State of Nature on the Origin of Property Against Aristotle and the long train of scholastic writers Hobbes maintained that man is not a naturally social animal. Unlike many animal and insect species, men do not instinctively arrange themselves so as to promote their mutual advantage.15 Man's fitness for social life must be artificially engineered. For Hobbes the social engineering needed to come from government intervention, or what Hobbes called a sovereign power that keeps all men in awe. In the absence of government, "the natural condition of man," there exists a terrible "warre ... of every man against every man."16 Small groupings of individuals in families and villages may exist for a time. Hobbes pointed to social life in America among the Indians, where small families existed in close relationships based on "naturall lust."17 He maintained that even admitting private bondings as exceptions to the solitary existence of man in his natural state, there is no civil law, no justice or injustice, and certainly nothing resembling modern property- rights structures to protect individuals:</page><page sequence="4">Hobbes's Influence on Hume 401 Where there is no common Power, there is no Law: where no Law, no Injustice. Force and Fraud, are in warre the two Cardinall vertues. Justice and Injustice are none of the Faculties neither of the Body, nor Mind. ... It is consequent also to the same condition, that there be no Propriety, no Dominion, no Mine and Thine distinct; but [only] that to be every mans that he can get; and for so long, as he can keep it.18 In the state of nature Hobbesian man might succeed in obtaining dominion over some object, say, a small parcel of land. Unfortunately this moment of "private possession" is likely to be short-lived and end when another man overpowers the first and claims dominion for himself. For as amongst masterless men, there is perpetuali war, of every man against his neighbour; no inheritance, to transmit to the Son, nor to expect from the Father; no propriety of Goods, or Lands; no security; but a full and absolute Libertie in every Particular man.19 Hobbes is clear and unhesitating in his conclusion that it is the sovereign power that both assigns property and determines rights and duties and then establishes the rules by which these rights are to be transferred both among contemporaries and along successive generations. Property-rights structures do not evolve out of custom, habit, and usage; on the contrary, they are created by government, the "sovereign power." These property-rights structures are needed to promote peace and stability and generate higher living standards.20 The sovereign power assigns exclusive rights to particular individu- als after making a determination that alternative property-rights arrangements, such as common-property arrangements, are less sat- isfactory. In other words, the civil law is created by the sovereign.21 Who should get the right to a certain coveted, fertile parcel of land? According to Hobbes, objects such as this "ought to be adjudged to the First Possessor; and in some cases to the First-Borne, as acquired by Lot."22 These principles will give rise to a coherent and predictable property-rights structure for society and introduce conditions favor- able to a prosperous commerce. While Hobbes often speaks of the "safety of the people" as the main objective of the Sovereign Power, he explains that the term "safety" does not mean bare minimum survival.23 It is broader than that and includes "all other Contentments</page><page sequence="5">402 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology of life, which every man by lawfull Industry, without danger, or hurt to the Commonwealth, shall acquire to himselfe."24 As Hobbes explains, what is not prohibited by the sovereign is allowed, and presumably what is allowed includes wide spaces of economic liberty. Now let us turn our attention to Hume's writings. Hume agreed with Hobbes that there was absolutely nothing in man's nature that predisposed him toward one particular property- rights structure over another. He pointed out that the existing property-rights structures which offer rules about ownership and descent are really more the results of compromise and convention than of any deep understanding of the natural order of things. For example, the rule of primogeniture (Hobbes's preferred rule) is not something that is required at all times and at all places. Real prop- erty, say, in the form of a landed estate, could just as well descend in equal shares rather than to the oldest legitimate son. Often what seems so natural to one generation is only a result of convention and repetition, which have etched a certain regular vision onto the human mind.25 Hume explained that some rules capture the imagi- nation and seem very logical, even natural; but this is all a mental illusion. There is nothing, absolutely nothing, inherent in man's breast that automatically guarantees one particular property-rights structure over another. The rules about property are "artificial," that is, invented by man and maintained by man because they make possible a peaceful, prosperous society. These rules evolve for all sorts of curious reasons, but they derive their obligatory force by attention to the favorable consequences which they bring about.26 In Hobbes's writings the rules about property acquire their obligatory force as a derivative duty from the necessity each man faces to "obey" the sovereign power. That obligation, in turn, is justified (at least in part) by an analysis of how obedience makes social life possible. This brings me to a major difference between Hobbes and Hume on the issue of the relationship between government and the institution of private property. To appreciate that difference and, at the same time, gain a clearer understanding of how Hume's analysis is indebted to Hobbes's, let us take a detour and compare Hume's description of the state of nature with Hobbes's.</page><page sequence="6">Hobbes's Influence on Hume 403 Hume's State of Nature In the "useful fiction" of the state of nature Hume found man com- pelled toward family life, not by mere lust but by a basic biological drive to cohabit and rear children in a kind, loving way.27 Natural man can be both generous and sympathetic toward his family and friends. Even in small group situations Hobbesian man is self-seeking and dangerous, but Humean man is entirely different.28 Humean man is born fit for social life because he is born with natural benevolence. This is often pointed out by those who draw a large and thick line of demarcation between Hobbes, "the egoist," and Hume, the adherent of the "moral sense" school.29 However, Hume goes on to point out, with much emphasis, that whatever generosity is contained in man's nature is "strictly confined" in its operation to small group settings.30 Benevolence can operate within a family and perhaps within a village, but, Hume insisted, man's natural affections have their limits. In a large commercial society benevolence will not be enough to keep the peace. As the number of individuals increases, the harmony of the state of nature gives way to many of the horrible insecurities that Hobbes described. In numbers, Hume explained, man becomes selfish, rapacious, and outright savage. Hobbes attributed the quarreling to man's vainglori- ous nature and to scarcity, which he found equally troublesome in both large group and small group settings.31 In Hume's view the quarreling occurs between individuals from remote villages, who fight wars with each other: "[the] first rudiments of government . . . arise from quarrels, not among men of the same society, but among those of different societies."32 In what Hume termed "large and polish'd societies," government is needed to make men observe the rule of justice and especially rules about property and contracting.33 At another place Hume suggested that the breakdown of harmoni- ous social life owes as much as to the degree of prosperity as it does to mere numbers. Prosperity can unsettle things and lead to social conflict: "the state of society without government is one of the most natural states of men, and may subsist with the conjunction of many families, and long after the first generation. Nothing but an encrease of riches and possessions cou'd oblige men to quit it."34 Stability of</page><page sequence="7">404 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology property is absolutely necessary for a commodious social life: "Prop- erty must be stable and must be fix'd by general rules [because if property were not stable] society must immediately dissolve, and everyone must fall into that savage and solitary condition, which is infinitely worse than the worst situation that can possibly be suppos'd in society."35 Hume's attempt to carve out an exception to Hobbes's rule that life in the natural state is "nasty, brutish and short" led him to a qualified account of how men living in a small family or village community can do without government. As I explain below, men appreciate and adopt rudimentary property-rights structures on a voluntary basis without the need for government. But as the size of the community increases, government is needed to establish and maintain such structures. Let us compare Hobbes and Hume on the question of the origin of property rights. The Origin of Property Rights in Hume What we have seen is that in Hobbes's natural state there is no generally shared belief about "mine and thine." Individuals have possessions, but only until another person grabs them away. It is only after the creation of the sovereign power that property-rights struc- tures come into existence. Against Hobbes, Hume argued that in the state of nature rudimentary property-rights structures will emerge spontaneously, even without the presence of a sovereign power, to keep "all men in awe." He insisted that in the state of nature, when possessions are few and numbers are small, the idea of property will arise as a matter of convention.36 Each village member reasons as follows: "it will be for my interest to leave another in the possession of his goods, provided he will act in the same manner with regard to me."37 Unlike Hobbes's, Hume's sovereign power does not invent property. Government only complements, aids, and helps extend its otherwise automatic development.38 Consider two men in a boat adrift at sea. Isn't it reasonable to suppose that both individuals could start to pull the oars in concert and row to shore without a formal, contractual agreement and cer- tainly without being ordered to do so? Surely they could adopt a</page><page sequence="8">Hobbes's Influence on Hume 405 convention and coordinate their behavior to their mutual advantage, without even a single word of conversation. Property-rights structures arise incrementally from such conventions: two men, who pull the oars of a boat, do it by an agreement or con- vention, tho' they have never given promises to each other. Nor is the rule concerning the stability of possession the less deriv'd from human conventions, that is, it arises gradually, and acquires force by a slow progression, and by our repeated experience of the inconveniences of transgressing it. On the contrary, this experience assures us still more, that the sense of interest has become common to all our fellows, and gives us a confidence of the future regularity of their conduct: And 'tis only on the expectation of this, that our moderation and abstinence are founded.39 In my view Hume added to Hobbes the idea that patterns of behavior that contribute to human welfare can emerge spontane- ously by what are dubbed "invisible hand processes." He explained, probably following Mandeville, that the evolution of language and the adoption of gold and silver as money commodities proceed from exactly analogous trial-and-error processes.40 This pattern of reasoning has been identified by Hayek and others as a basic theme among the "Scottish Enlightenment school," to which Hume was an outstanding contributor.41 Unfortunately, as Hume explained, the full development of a property-rights system cannot proceed spontaneously when large numbers of people must live and work together. Benevolence is "strictly confined," and rules sanctioned by a sovereign power are needed to establish supplementary rules about property, such as its transfer from one person to the next. The peaceful transfer of property is, of course, an absolute prerequisite for a large and prosperous commercial society. The Transfer of Property by Consent and the Need for Government Intervention Hume offered two reasons for the transfer of property by consent. First, while the stability of possessions and the origin of property emerge spontaneously from human convention and ingenuity, the particular allocation of resources that emerges may depend on</page><page sequence="9">406 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology "chance" and may prove to be "ill adjusted" to men's "wants and desires."42 Second, Hume repeated the well-established and often- repeated reason for commerce, that different parts of the world are, by nature, suitable for entirely different production activities.43 To this he added the observation that men also are suited, by nature, for different employments.44 This means that an individual may acquire through the well-known laws of succession an apple-tree farm for himself but instead wish to study music at the university hundreds of miles away. To rectify such mismatches, Hume explained, men will adopt the custom of allowing mutual exchange. The general rule will be that "possession and property shou'd always be stable except when the [present owner] agrees to bestow them on some other person."45 Rules facilitating the voluntary transfer of property from one individual to the next are needed for the evolution of a complex commercial order. We are no longer speaking of the problem of the stability of property, but rather of the myriad of rules that facilitate the transfer of property between neighbors within a village and between strangers from adjacent villages and nations. According to Hume's psychology the human mind cannot conceive of the transfer of property except by way of analogy to more familiar, commonplace experiences.46 One experience familiar even to the youngest child is the "swap" or baiter exchange. Thus, when I exchange my corn for Harry's fish, I deliver the corn to Harry, and Harry reciprocates by delivering the fish to me. But how can the ownership of corn stocks in a warehouse be transferred without removing the corn from the warehouse? Alternatively, how can an acre of land far out in the country be conveyed between two Lon- doners without ever leaving the city? And so the elaborate lawyers' rituals in which "legal title passes" and "interests vest" evolve partly in response to the human mind's need to visualize property relationships in existential terms.47 There is nothing innate or instinctual about property-rights structures; they proceed from the imagination, which itself is stimulated by experience. Unlike Hobbes, Hume saw the idea of property as evolving slowly out of the ordinary customs of village life. Government supported and strengthened these developments but did not create them in the first place.48 Thus we can identify a major difference between Hobbes and</page><page sequence="10">Hobbes's Influence on Hume 407 Hume on the question of the role of the state in the creation of property. Once created, however, the rudimentary idea of property must be shaped into a fully functioning property-rights structure, and here (according to both Hobbes and Hume) the role of government is indispensable. Both Hobbes and Hume saw the specific content of these property-rights structures as man-made and artificial.49 To Hob- bes's analysis of the relation between property rights and peace, Hume added the importance of rules governing the voluntary transfer of property and the effect of such rules on economic activity: "Where possession has no stability, there must be perpetual war. Where property is not transferr'd by consent, there can be no commerce."50 A commercial society was something to be valued. In this respect Hume and Hobbes agreed. Whatever biological disadvantages lonely man faces compared to lions and bees, who socialize by instinct, he more than overcomes by his participation in society. The division of labor makes a satisfactory standard of living possible, and this in turn depends on a clear, defined property-rights structure. As Hume explained it, 'Tis by society alone he is able to supply his defects, and raise himself up to an equality with his fellow-creatures, and even acquire a superiority above them. By society all his infirmities are compensated; and tho' in that situation his wants multiply every moment upon him, yet his abilities are still more augmented, and leave him in every respect more satisfied and happy, than 'tis possible for him, in his savage and solitary condition, ever to become. When every individual person labours a-part, and only for himself, his force is too small to execute any considerable work; his labour being employ 'd in supplying all his different necessities, he never attains perfection in any particular art; and as his force and success are not at all times equal, the least failure in either of these particulars must be attended with inevitable ruin and misery. Society provides a remedy for these three inconveniences. By the conjunction of forces, our power is augmented: By the partition of employments, our ability encreases: And by mutual succour we are less expos'd to fortune and accidents. 'Tis by this additional force, ability and security, that society becomes advantageous.51 What sort of situations impede the division of labor and the progress of modern commercial society? Hume does not produce a systematic list but does tell us in the Treatise that "the principal disturbance in society arises from those goods, which we call external [goods] and from their</page><page sequence="11">408 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology looseness and easy transition from one person to another."52 1 take this to mean that a major source of discord in a modern commercial society is movable goods, whose mere possession may or may not signify legal ownership. While immovable property such as land is also subject to the same ambiguities, the need to transport movables in commerce and the numerous carriers and middlemen that are involved in that process must create a wide range of disputes and quarrels that would be unheard of in a rural village setting.53 A variety of new rules about property and its transfer are needed to accommodate the transfer of property in the context of modern town life. I conclude that there is a closeness of reasoning between Hobbes and Hume about the relationship between property-rights structures and the emergence of commercial society. Both believed that property-rights structures must be artificially engineered. Both hypoth- esized about the origin of property rights in a state of nature. Hobbes looked to the sovereign power to invent both the structure and its individual parts. Hume looked toward men's experiences in a small society and especially to the role of custom and convention. Ulti- mately, government-created rules about property would be needed to help facilitate commerce among strangers, especially as society grew in size. Both Hobbes and Hume especially qualified Aristotle's claim that social life emerged spontaneously out of man's instinctive nature. A modern, complex, commercial order had to be "artificially" engi- neered by analysis and human ingenuity. Strategic Problems of Contracting The "prisoner dilemma problem" of social organization is another of Hobbes's insights that played an important part in Hume's Treatise.54 The problem is central to Hobbes's state of nature, and overcoming that problem required the creation of a central authority "to keep all men in awe." Voluntary self-help coalitions are of limited use. They spring up spontaneously in the state of nature when a group of individuals is attacked by an enemy. Unfortunately, when the threat subsides, the coalition quickly degenerates again into a collection of quarreling individuals. For multitude, though in their persons they run together, yet they concur not always in their designs. For even at that time when men are in tumult,</page><page sequence="12">Hobbes's Influence on Hume 409 though they agree a number of them to one mischief, and a number of them to another; yet, in the whole, they are amongst themselves in the state of hostility, and not of peace; like the seditious Jews besieged in Jerusalem, that could join against their enemies, and yet fight amongst themselves, . . . though thus assembled with intention to unite themselves, they are yet in that estate in which every man hath right to everything, and consequently, ... in an estate of enjoying nothing: and therefore meum and tuum hath no place amongst them.55 In the state of nature spontaneous social formations are fragile and of short duration. Without a clearly defined property-rights structure life in the state of nature is intolerable. According to Hobbes, natural man is fearful of sudden, violent death and, trusting no one, looks for a way out of the state of nature. A government with its centralization of the use of legitimate force could bottle up the warlike propensities of man and make social life tolerable, if not. advantageous. It occurs to man that everyone could be better off if everyone would renounce absolute individual liberty and submit to authority. Such an authority would establish the rules necessary for commercial society to exist. The Hobbesian problem is how a multitude of distrustful, noncooperative, quarreling agents can metamorphose themselves into a community of productive col- leagues.56 If everyone were to understand natural law, would the transition from the state of nature to society be difficult to achieve? Hobbes believed it would. To institute a commonwealth, each potential member of society must renounce his rights to all things and hope that others also do the same. The absolute liberty that each individual shared in the state of nature produced severe conflicts and awful disappointments. It is far better to renounce all claims and instead create a sovereign power to redistribute property and reallocate franchises. With stability, the basis exists for a new and more pros- perous social order.57 Hobbes realized that it was difficult if not suicidal for separate agents simultaneously to renounce their respective rights. The state of nature is a state of war, and in war it is recommended that no soldier be so careless as to throw down his sword without being assured that his adversary had done the same. To see what is involved here,</page><page sequence="13">410 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology imagine this example. Suppose Jones is standing at the helm of "his" strawberry patch, spears and clubs in hand, protecting these posses- sions from a feared invasion by Smith. Smith, in turn, is protecting his trout pond from poachers. Both Jones and Smith are obviously unhappy, spending most of their waking day protecting their posses- sions from surprise attack from each other as well as from third parties. Hobbes argued that property rights are created in two ways. First, if Jones and Smith are attacked by Harris, who spares their lives in exchange for obedience, Harris will establish the property-rights struc- ture and other rules as well. Harris will become the sovereign power and Jones and Smith his two subjects. Hobbes called this "sovereignty by dominion."58 Second, if Jones and Smith voluntarily renounce their rights to all things and agree to establish a sovereign power who is not a party to the contract (perhaps they name Harris their leader), the sovereign power will now, as before, assign property rights and establish other rules as well. Hobbes called this "sovereignty by institution."59 In The Elements of Law and also again in Leviathan Hobbes empha- sized how strategic self-interest can interfere with spontaneous social formations. Sovereignty by institution might prove to be impossible to implement. For example, if Smith were to renounce his right to all things (including his trout pond) and put down his weapons, offering a handshake to Jones, what is to prevent Jones (or anyone else) from seizing the moment and waging a successful attack against Smith? In other words, each warrior reasons as follows: "Let the other lay down his means of waging war first and when he has done so I shall attack and establish hegemony." This sort of strategic distrust creates a situation where no one finds it reasonable to lay down his right at all. The dominant strategy in this prisoner dilemma situation leads to an outcome that everyone finds inferior.60 In Leviathan Hobbes describes his second law of nature as follows: "That a man be willing, when others are so too ... to lay down his right to all things [and when others are not willing to do this, then the individual should not lay down his natural rights or else he would] expose himselfe to Prey."61 The existence of a central author- ity, what Hobbes termed "some mutual and common fear to rule</page><page sequence="14">Hobbes's Influence on Hume 411 them," makes the simultaneous renouncing of rights possible, and therefore the transition to society out of a state of nature also pos- sible.62 The actual transition requires a covenant between all natural men to lay down their claims to all objects and principles with the understanding that a "sovereign power" (who is not a party to the contract) will, at the moment of agreement, emerge powerful enough to keep all contracting parties to their word. Again let us return to the situation where all individuals, armed with spears and axes, face each other in a stand-off equilibrium. They are to throw down their weapons but only on condition that others do the same. This contract is conditioned on the simultaneous renouncing of rights by all - a contract that becomes binding when that contingency is finally removed. Who can be trusted to collect the arms before announcing the contingency removed? Perhaps, in the end, Hobbes's account of the social contract was not intended to be a literal descrip- tion of how society comes into existence. As a matter of historical fact, sovereignty is often resurrected on the ashes of war and conquest.63 The vanquished swear allegiance to their victor or else are executed. The defeated party makes his promise in the shadow of the execu- tioner's sword. Sovereignty by dominion is the rule and sovereignty by institution the exception. However, the covenant between the van- quished and victor is suspicious by today's legal standards. Hobbes argued that contracts (or promises) extracted under duress are every bit as much a contract as those entered into out of self- interest or out of fear of violent death in the state of nature.64 This is a peculiar position and one that does not set well with the voluntarist tradition. Hobbes's argument here is not entirely convincing.65 It does, however, allow him to use the voluntary-contract model as essentially similar to what occurs when conquered people submit to authority out of fear. A related question is whether Hobbes believed that contracts can exist in the state of nature without a sovereign power. This is difficult to answer. On the one hand, it seems that without a sovereign power to punish promise-breakers, no one would risk trading a present good or service for a future promise, because to do so invites disappoint- ment and conflict later.66 The level of distrust is simply too great for voluntary contracting. On the other hand, the social contract that</page><page sequence="15">412 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology permits a multitude of quarreling agents to metamorphose into a regular society is a contract (albeit a conditional one) entered into, in the state of nature, that paradoxically ends that state of nature once and for all. Perhaps the most guarded answer to the question is that only one particular type of contract is possible in the state of nature: the super-contract that makes all other types of contracts possible. Unlike Hobbes, Hume believed that rudimentary forms of contract- ing could emerge in the state of nature even before government is formed and a sovereign power is created to keep men to their word. He agreed with Hobbes that the mental act of promising corresponds to no inner drive or human automatic instinct.67 Promising to keep an agreement is purely a human artifact or invention.68 Smith delivers a trout to Jones, and Jones promises to deliver a bushel of berries one week later. According to Hume, there is nothing in Jones's nature that compels him to keep his promises. Jones might even calculate that he can be better off by keeping the trout and then not delivering the berries to Smith. Smith, upon imagining that Jones might do this, may refuse to deliver the trout in the first place, making contracting an infrequent occurrence in the state of nature. Hume offers his own example of how distrust between farmers can interfere with what could otherwise have been a mutually advantageous trade. Two adjacent corn farmers see an opportunity for mutual gain, but their mutual distrust prevents them from entering into a mutually advantageous exchange - in fact it leads to loss on both sides: Your corn is ripe today; mine will be so tomorrow. 'Tis profitable for us both, and I shou'd labour with you to-day, and that you shou'd aid me to-morrow. I have no kindness for you, and know you have as little for me. I will not, therefore, take any pains upon your account; and should I labour with you upon my own account, in the expectation of a return, I know I shou'd be disappointed, and that I shou'd in vain depend upon your gratitude. Here then I leave you to labour alone: You treat me in the same manner. The seasons change; and both of us lose our harvests for want of mutual confidence and security.69 This is a sad result. It poses the question whether, in the absence of Hobbes's contract-enforcement authority, there is any self-interested motive why individuals would keep their promises. Hume pointed to one such motive. In a commercial society those who break their promises (or breach their contracts) will suffer a loss</page><page sequence="16">Hobbes's Influence on Hume 413 in reputation and possibly a loss in future revenue.70 It is not necessary that individuals feel "any real kindness" toward another.71 All that is necessary is that they consult their long-run interests. If they do that, they will find a self-interested reason why it is prudent not to break promises.72 Unfortunately, Hume continued,, promises are often broken. The corn farmers' distrust may be rationally based on experience. Though individuals should consult their long-run interests, often they do not. By preferring contiguous to remote events, they make decisions at variance with their long-run interests.73 Here Hume followed Hobbes, who described men as wearing "multiplying glasses" and therefore, lacking "prospective glasses," discounting the future consequences of their decisions too highly.74 Hume apparently appreciated the phe- nomenon of "time preference" and considered it a veritable defect in human nature: "There is no quality in human nature, which causes more fatal errors in our conduct, than that which leads us to prefer whatever is present to the distant and remote, and makes us desire objects more according to their situation than their intrinsic value."75 Try as they might, men cannot easily free themselves from this infirmity. Some go to great lengths to keep their long-term interests in view. The fact remains that after a promise has been made and benefits have been received, they find it difficult to "adhere inflexibly to [their] first purpose and resolution."76 In short, they often break their promises. This brings us to the role that collective action plays in enforcing contracts and keeping men to their word. For Hobbes, the sovereign power threatens to punish promise-breakers, and this reassures the promisees that they can rely on the promise because it will be enforced.77 For Hume, the sovereign power and the bureaucracy do more than that. Following Mandeville, Hume argued that politicians, along with the "civil magistrates, kings and their ministers, [the] governors and rulers . . . have no interest, or but a remote one, in any act of injustice. . . . [but they] have an immediate interest in every execution of justice, which is so necessary to the upholding of society."78 One way in which they promote justice is by encouraging citizens to keep their promises and obey the sovereign power. Human nature, with its myopic vision and confined generosity,</page><page sequence="17">414 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology interferes with justice, and so the government must educate. Govern- ment does not change human nature, and government does not bottle up passions. Instead, by educating the public about the characteristics of good men and women, government redirects the passions in order to produce socially acceptable results.79 Here then is the origin of civil government and allegiance. Men are not able radically to cure, either in themselves or others, that narrowness of soul, which makes them prefer the present to the remote. They cannot change their natures. All they can do is to change their situation, and render the observance of justice the immediate interest of some particular persons, and its violation their more remote.80 The particular persons who go about encouraging people to keep to their promises and make private contracting a viable and trusted institution are largely the magistrates and other low-level government officials. Hence the important role that government plays in a com- mercial society of encouraging men to overcome the impasse created by the distrust inherent in the prisoner dilemma problem. Both Hobbes and Hume emphasized the fragility of private con- tracting in the absence of a central authority to induce promisors to keep their word. With both, the inducement is partly but not entirely a negative one: the fear of punishment. Politicians and magistrates do more than threaten and convict. They persuade, flatter, and educate until the rule that one should keep his promises becomes a matter of moral and civic pride.81 Hobbes and Hume agreed that promise-keeping is not part of human nature. Promise-keeping is an artificial invention, made viable by government, that when widely practiced in a commercial setting, promotes peace and prosperity. Hume's Fundamental Laws of Nature We now come to Hume's account of what he considered to be the three fundamental laws of nature. Each consists of a rule or con- vention that emerges spontaneously in the hypothetical state of nature in response to man's efforts to better his economic condition. In the course of time, the government (which itself arises from human convention) embellishes the rules and through education</page><page sequence="18">Hobbes's Influence on Hume 415 and positive reinforcement converts what started out as a set of prudential maxims into a series of moral obligations. Hume offers a utilitarian argument for these moral obligations. The individual is morally obliged to follow these rules since the prosperity of the community depends on no individual's by his own actions weak- ening these rules. We have now run over the three fundamental laws of nature, that of the stability of possession, of its transference by consent, and of the performance of promises. 'Tis on the strict observance of those three laws, that the peace and security of human society entirely depend; nor is there any possibility of establishing a good correspondence among men, where these are neglected. Society is absolutely necessary for the well-being of men; and these are as necessary to the support of Society.82 Hume's three fundamental laws of nature are about property-rights structures and the law of contracts. These laws are among the nec- essary conditions for a modern commercial society. Hobbes's account of the laws of nature is entirely consistent with Hume's. Hobbes's natural laws are more aptly described as "prudential maxims," instruct- ing individuals about how to escape the horrors of the state of nature. Following the rules becomes a way of avoiding an existence that is intolerable. Nevertheless the practical and, perhaps, unintended benefit from searching for and instructing others about these natural laws is the possibility of a commodious social life.83 This is also what Hume understood to be the great practical benefit of the evolution of the rule of law. His writings in the eighteenth century, with their broader and in some ways more compelling cosmopolitan vision of a world increasingly united by trade and commerce, travel pathways pioneered by Hobbes.84 Hobbes provided both the questions and the "tools of analysis." Government Public Works I have spoken of government as an architect of property-rights struc- tures and as an educational institution that can turn customs and conventions into rules of moral obligation. In this section we consider government as going beyond its role as law-giver and law-enforcer to function as an actual entrepreneurial organization. Government now</page><page sequence="19">4l6 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology directs individuals toward achieving mutually advantageous objectives when private action fails. Hume refers to government as law-giver and entrepreneur as follows: in the execution and decision of justice, men acquire a security against each others weakness and passion, as well as against their own, and under the shelter of their governors, begin to taste at ease the sweets of society and mutual assistance. But government extends farther its beneficial influ- ence; and not contented to protect men in those conventions they make for their mutual interest, it often obliges them to make such conventions, and forces them to seek their own advantage, by a concurrence in some common end or purpose.85 According to Hume, there are times when a group of individuals may simply not be able to work together to achieve a common purpose or end. Two individuals may not find it difficult at all to coordinate their actions and drain a meadow. If, however, a large multitude of individu- als live around a meadow, it might be difficult, if not impossible, to get them voluntarily to work together. Certain individuals may act oppor- tunistically and reason that "if I show no interest in the project, then the others will do all the work (or contribute all the monies) and I will enjoy the benefits." This is the prisoner dilemma problem identified by Hobbes, but now applied in a new direction. In such cases, Hume believed, the case for collective action is very strong. The following passage has become well known to students of public-choice econom- ics and contains, in a few short sentences, a number of themes that are now largely identified with the field: Two neighbors may agree to drain a meadow, which they possess in common; because 'tis easy for them to know each others mind; and each must perceive, that the immediate consequence of his failing in his part, is, the abandoning [of] the whole project. But 'tis very difficult, and indeed impossible, that a thousand persons shou'd agree in any such action; it being difficult for them to concert so complicated a design, and still more difficult to execute it; while each seeks a pretext to free himself of the trouble and expence, and wou'd lay the whole burden on others. Political society easily remedies both these inconveniences. Magistrates find an immediate interest in the interest of any considerable part of their subjects. They need consult no body but themselves to form any scheme for the promoting of that interest. And as the failure of any one piece in the execution is connected, tho' not immediately, with the failure of the whole, they prevent that failure, because they find no interest in it, either</page><page sequence="20">Hobbes's Influence on Hume All immediate or remote. Thus bridges are built; harbours open'd; ramparts rais'd; canals form'd; fleets equip'd; and armies disciplin'd; every where, by the care of government, which, tho' compos'd of men subject to all human infirmities, becomes, by one of the finest and most subtle inventions imaginable, a composition that is, in some measure, exempted from all these infirmities.86 The coordination of men's wills and egos by government in order to bring about practical results is, of course, one of the main themes of Hobbes's Leviathan. The institution of government metamorphoses the separate, discrete designs of individuals into a powerful engine of collective action. Thus meadow-draining and other public goods are provided through government intervention. Collective action replaces private action when transactions costs to private individuals become prohibi- tive. Transactions costs to individuals will be large when the behavior of large numbers of individuals must be managed and coordinated.87 Hume's friend and confidant Adam Smith extended these ideas one step further in the Wealth of Nations: The third and last duty of the sovereign or commonwealth is that of erecting and maintaining those public institutions and those public works, which, though they may be in the highest degree advantageous to a great society, are, however, of such a nature, that the profit could never repay the expence to any individual or small number of individuals, and which it therefore cannot be expected that any individual or small number of individuals should erect or maintain.88 Smith's emphasis on the high transactions costs associated with achieving agreement among large numbers of individuals is in direct line of descent from Hume. Thus Hobbes bequeathed to Hume and, through him, to the entire classical school of economics a view of government as an artificial device that supplements human conven- tion and augments whatever meager amounts of natural benevolence God implanted in men's hearts. Conclusion In this paper I have explored the closeness of reasoning that exists between Hobbes's ideas about social and economic organization in</page><page sequence="21">418 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology his Elements of Law and in Leviathan and those presented by Hume in his Treatise. What Hobbes and Hume shared was a recognition that man, by nature, was not automatically fit for modern commercial society. Man's passions needed to be molded, shaped, and redirected so that a whole community could enjoy a commodious life. This was done by constructing rules or civil laws (in Hobbes's case) or by institutionalizing and encouraging certain conventions (in Hume's case), all the time trying to overcome certain disruptive elements in human nature. Hume had the good fortune of living and writing in the heyday of the "Scottish Enlightenment school" founded by Hutcheson, which enjoyed an expansive influence on eighteenth-century thought as far away as the United States.89 As a general rule the Scottish Enlightenment thinkers were "anti-Hobbes" and insisted that man's nature made him automatically fit for society.90 Hume himself was more eclectic. He grafted Hobbes onto Hutcheson by distinguishing what is possible in small groups, such as the family and the village, from what is possible in larger group situations. In my opinion Hume extracted from Hobbes's writings those insights that were directly relevant to the issue of collective action among large numbers of individuals. The Hobbes link is especially apparent in Hume's Treatise, which we know (on Russell's authority) was consciously arranged along the lines of Hobbes's analysis, espe- cially what Hobbes presented in The Elements of Law.91 Thus if I am correct about the historical originality of Hobbes as a "public choice theorist,"92 I can now establish a definite route by which several of Hobbes's original ideas about the necessity of collective action entered the mainstream of nineteenth-century economic thought. That route is through Hume's writings. Hobbes and Hume agreed that the state is needed to make property rights effective and a commercial order possible. They both recognized that "keeping prom- ises" is not something that flows naturally or readily out of human nature, but rather requires the active presence of a central authority to make private contracting a viable institution. Finally, both recognized the difficulties that prisoner dilemma situations present for collective decision making. Hume went on to recognize the necessity of public works projects in his meadow example, especially identifying the problems involved in eliciting cooperation when the beneficiaries are</page><page sequence="22">Hobbes's Influence on Hume 419 numerous and the tendency to shirk responsibility is great. Adam Smith added public works projects to his short list of government functions - a list that carried the genes of the Hobbes-Hume hybrid well into nineteenth-century classical economics. The Hobbes-Hume link is an important one that can help us understand the early history and origins of public-choice reasoning in the history of economic thought. This is a revised and expanded version of an earlier paper that I presented before the History of Economics Society Meeting held in New York City in 1986. I thank Richard Gonce, Eugene Rotwein, Malcolm Rutherford, and two anonymous referees for reading and commenting on an earlier draft of this paper. I also thank the Babson College Board of Research for a course release in the fall of 1988, which provided time for revision. Any remaining errors are entirely my own responsibility. Notes 1. Cf. Moss 1977. That paper builds on J. W. N. Watkins's claim (1965) that Hobbes's adherence to the philosophical and scientific foundations of Galilean science explains both the character of Hobbes's arguments and the reasons why they presage the "methodological individualist" approach toward explaining political and economic organization. My paper also draws from the A. P. Taylor-Howard Warrender literature which examines the ethical foun- dations of Hobbes's prudential rules of social organization. For "prisoner dilemma" interpretations of Hobbes's political theory see, in addition to my 1977 paper, Gauthier 1969; Kavka 1986; Hampton 1986; Taylor 1987. Hobbes's central theory was first circulated in manuscript form in 1640 under the title The Elements of Law and later published (probably without his permission) in 1650; see Tonnies 1928. (References here to The Elements cite the part and the chapter, followed by the page numbers in the Tonnies edition.) Meanwhile Hobbes had published a revised version of his ideas under the title De Cive in Latin in 1642 and a larger, expanded version under the same title in 1647. In 1651 he translated De Cive into English as "Philo- sophical Rudiments Concerning Government and Society," which was subse- quently included in Sir William Molesworth, The English Works of Thomas Hobbes, vol. 2. A more accessible version of "Philosophical Rudiments" is reprinted in Hobbes 1972, 89-386). Finally, in 1651, Hobbes published his Leviathan - a most distinguished monument to the English language. I have used the accessible Penguin edition (Hobbes 1968). References to Leviathan cite the chapter and the page number in that edition. There is still one more version of that part of Hobbes's theory which is concerned with human nature, written in Latin (in 1658) under the title De Homine. An English</page><page sequence="23">420 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology translation by B. Gert is included in Hobbes 1972, 1-89. I am mostly concerned here with the arguments presented in The Elements of the Law and Leviathan, as these texts were most readily available to Hume and, as I shall argue here, influenced his thought. 2. Below I compare the arguments Hobbes employed in The Elements and Leviathan to those presented in Hume's Treatise of Human Nature, especially book 3, which is subtitled "An Attempt to Introduce the Experi- mental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects." References to Hume's Treatise cite the part, the section, and the page in the Selby-Bigge edition (Hume [1739-1740] 1985). I have not undertaken a detailed comparison of the Treatise with Hume's Enquiries Concerning Human Understanding ([1777] 1985). Suffice it to say that the Treatise is considerably more detailed on the issues that concern us here. 3. In chapter 23 of Leviathan Hobbes discussed the role of public ministers who are given specific jobs "employed in any affaires" (1968, 289) that allow them to represent the sovereign. Among their responsibilities, public ministers have the "authority to teach, or to enable others to teach the people their duty to the Sovereign Power, and instruct them in the knowledge of what is just, and unjust, thereby to render them more apt to live in godlinesse, and in peace amongst themselves, and resist the publique enemy" (291). Public ministers "resembleth the Nerves and Tendons that move the severall limbs of the body naturali" (290). This theme, that government magistrates educate the multitude and help shape it for social life, is devel- oped further in the writings of Bernard Mandeville, who may have elaborated on Hobbes's description when he described how "Private Vices [are] by the dextrous Management of a skilful Politician . . . turned into Publick Benefits" ([1714] 1988, 1:369). On Hume's view of the magistrates see below. 4. The secondary literature is filled with many accounts of Hobbes's alleged egoistic view of human nature. Gert (1972, 5) considers this a "most serious misinterpretation." He insists that "Hobbes did not maintain psycho- logical egoism (PE)" but admits that Hobbes may have been a "tautological egoist (TE)." A TE holds that all human action is motivated by "personally held desires." PE goes beyond TE and holds that these personally held desires never include purely benevolent motives. Hobbes was not a PE because to him man is capable of a great variety of benevolent motives, including the care and love of family members such as children. For citations see Gert 1967, 107-108. As the label "moral sense school" implies, a number of writers attacked Hobbes for describing man as morally base and for arguing instead that the human animal is naturally inclined toward virtuous acts regardless of their impact on his interests. These include Richard Cumberland, Lord Shaftesbury, Francis Hutcheson, David Hume, and Adam Smith. See, e.g., Bourke 1968, 131-151; Mackie 1980, 7-13.</page><page sequence="24">Hobbes's Influence on Hume All 5. The modern trend is to identify similarities between Hobbes's manner of reasoning and Hume's. See, e.g., Russell 1985; Raphael 1962; Mackie 1980; Flew 1986. This is partly due to the better understanding philosophers now have of Hobbes's ethical theories and the heightened interest in interpreting interrelationships among books 1, 2, and 3, respectively, of Hume's Treatise. For many years philosophers analyzed book 1, mentioned book 2, and completely ignored book 3! (See, e.g., Smith 1941.) Owing to the labors of Capaldi and others, our understanding of Hume is now much richer; see, e.g., Capaldi 1976. A most comprehensive account of the connection between Hobbes's and Hume's respective works is in Taylor 1987. 6. Russell notes (1985, 86) that Hume covers such topics as property, promises (i.e., "contracts"), the origin of government, the source of allegiance, the right of rebellions, etc.), thereby following the general plan of Hobbes's works. 7. Hayek was one of the earliest to appreciate Hume's contribution to the social sciences, but he denies the Hobbes-Hume link completely; see Hayek 1967. Hobbes is a "constructive rationalist," whereas Hume is an "antiration- alist" and proponent of spontaneous social formations; see Hamowy 1987. 8. E.g., Hamowy 1987. 9. "While [Hume] no doubt sought 'literary fame' he had no desire for 'controversy, notoriety, nor martyrdom' " (1985, 58). Any acknowledged link between the Treatise and Hobbes's philosophy would certainly have spelled trouble for Hume (58). 10. Russell 1985, 60. Ironically, Hayek and his students recognize Mandev- ille's contribution to the Scottish tradition but fail to recognize Hobbes's influence on both Mandeville and Hume, see Hayek 1967; Hamowy 1987; Haakonssen 1981. 11. Myers 1983, 28-34. 12. Allen 1976. 13. Taylor 1987 (first published in 1976). 14. According to Selby-Bigge, "It is hard therefore to be fair to the 'benevolent' theory which figures so largely in this period unless we appre- ciate the irritation and alarm caused to sober moralists by the cynicism of Hobbes and the satire of Rochefoucauld, Mandeville, and the tribe of dull imitators, such as James Esprit, and Sir Richard Blackmore" (1897, l:xiv). 15. As Hobbes explained it, "certain living creatures, as Bees, and Ants, live sociably one with another, (which are therefore by Aristotle numbered amongst Politicali creatures;) [but unlike man] . . . the agreement of these creatures is Naturall; that of men, is by Covenant only, which is Artificiali: and therefore it is no wonder if there be somewhat else required (besides Covenant) to make their Agreement constant and lasting; which is a Common Power, to keep them in awe, and to direct their actions to the Common Benefit" {Leviathan 17, pp. 225-226). Cf. Hobbes, Elements 2.1, p. 86. In short,</page><page sequence="25">422 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology Hobbes's position is that man is made social by contract, not by instinct, and it is in this sense that social behavior is artificially contrived. Hume, as I shall explain below, also described social order as "artificially" contrived but formed by custom and habit operating through human reasoning and pro- pelled along by human passions; cf. Treatise 3.6, p. 526. 16. For references to the state of nature consisting of a terrible "war of all against all," see, e.g., Leviathan 13, pp. 185-186; 14. p. 190; 15. p. 214; 19, p. 242; 19, p. 249; 20, p. 260; 21, p. 266; 24, pp. 296-297; 28, p. 354; 30, p. 376; 46, p. 683. See also; Elements 1.14, p. 55, 1.15, p. 58; 2.5, p. 110; For Hume's references to the state of nature, etc., see below. 17. Leviathan 17, p. 187; Elements 1.19, pp. 3, 4. At another place in Leviathan (20, p. 253) he casually mentions "the natural inclination of the sexes, one to another and to their children"; but without matrimonial laws "it cannot be known who is the Father, unlesse it be declared by the Mother," and so the care and custody of the child becomes the responsi- bility of the mother. Hobbes points to the history of the Amazon Indians for evidence of a society in which the women had complete dominion. Feudal institutions are different. There, since the father (husband) has dominion over the mother (wife), he has dominion over the children also (see Ele- ments 2.4). Hume takes up a related theme about the informational asym- metries between the sexes regarding conception and its implications for social customs and offers a "sociological" account of modesty in woman {Treatise 3.12, pp. 570-573. See also his "Of Polygamy and Divorces" (in Hume 1985, 181-191). 18. Leviathan 13, p. 188. 19. Leviathan 21, p. 266. 20. In Leviathan (24, p. 294) he speaks of the "nutrition" of a common- wealth consisting in the "Plenty, and Distribution of Materials conducing to Life." He paraphrases Cicero to the effect that without the "Civili Law" there could be no human rights, including property rights. Without property rights there would be only temporary dominion amid the awful war of all against all (296). In a well-governed society property rights in land permit the exclusion of "all other subjects" but not the exclusion of the sovereign (297). With security of property (subject only to occasional interference by the sovereign power, say, in the form of tax assessments and collections), the institution of money comes in to aid the mobility of "men from place to place" and to "measure . . . the value of all things else between Nations" (300). (We are also told that a tax on consumption expenditure is the best tax to finance the state, because it discourages luxury consumption and does not discourage saving and investment (300).) In The Elements (2.5, p. 110) Hobbes tells us that it is a natural law to permit men to follow their various trades and callings by permitting interregional trade; taxation is discussed at several places (2.9, pp. 143-144).</page><page sequence="26">Hobbes's Influence on Hume 423 21. Leviathan 26 is devoted to a discussion of civil law. Civil laws are the commands of the sovereign [power], who itself is noi bound by the law. Laws can be "Humane" or "Divine" and among the "Humane" are distributive laws "that determine the Rights of the Subjects, declaring to every man what it is, by which he acquireth and holdeth a propriety on lands, or goods, and a right or liberty of action: and these speak to all the Subjects" (pp. 330-331)- See also Leviathan 15, p. 212. 22.

Hume justified the existing rules in terms of their "publick utility," which he determined to be quite significant. However, it was impossible to explain why the rules are one way rather than another way, since alternative arrangements are also possible and will also provide "publick utility." He insisted that certain rules appeal to the "more frivolous properties of our thought and conception." This anticipates a modern line of investigation that documents the heuristics of decision making, especially under uncertainty. See, e.g., Tversky and Kahneman 1978; cf. Home 1990, 94-96. Hume distinguished the problem of the formation of rules, which can include historical, psychological, and anthropomorphic information (and in our day even sociobiological data), from the separate problem of how these rules are justified and discovered to be worth preserving. In principle it is possible to find rules that have evolved for all sorts of understandable reasons and perhaps from the purest of human motives but which have now become completely unacceptable and worth discarding. 27. Treatise 3.2, p. 486. 28. Treatise 2.7, pp. 368-371. 29. Cf. Bourke 1968. 30. See above, note 4. He wrote: "Men being naturally selfish, or endow'd only with a confin'd generosity, they are not easily induc'd to perform any action for the interest of strangers, except with a view to some reciprocal advantage" {Treatise 3.5, p. 519). 31. "[I]n the nature of man, we find three principali causes of quarrell. First, Competition; Secondly, Diffidence; Thirdly, Glory" {Leviathan 13, p. 185). Elsewhere in Leviathan he defines the great variety of passions that effect human behavior. One passion consists of vainglory, "the feigning or suppos- ing of abilities in our selves, which we know are not [there]" (6, p. 125). We have already seen (note 15 above) that man, unlike bees and ants, must be rendered suitable for social life. Unlike bees and ants, "men are continually in competition for Honour and Dignity . . . and consequently amongst men there ariseth on that ground, Envy and Hatred, and finally Warre" (17, pp. 225-226). Finally, Hobbes explained that of all the passions, the one that "most</page><page sequence="27">424 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology frequently" caused crime is vainglory, "or a foolish over-rating of their own worth; as if difference of worth, were an effect of their wit, or riches, or bloud, or some other natural quality, not depending on the Will of those that have the Sovereign Authority" (27, p. 341). See also Elements, e.g., 1.14, p. 54. 32. Treatise 3.8, p. 540. 33. Treatise 3.8, p. 543. 34. Treatise 3.8, p. 541. 35. Compare Hobbes as follows: "For as amongst masterlesse men, there is perpetuali war, of every man against his neighbour; no inheritance, to transmit to the son, nor to expect from the father; no propriety of Goods, or Lands; no security; but a full and absolute Libertie in every Particular man" (Leviathan 21, p. 266). See also 24, p. 299. 36. Treatise 3.2, p. 490. 37. Treatise 3.2, p. 490. 38. Haakonssen (1981, 3-44) argues that when Hume used the word "artificial" he meant "evolutionary" only. Thus the nurturing role of Hume's government magistrates is hardly mentioned at all, and Hobbes 's approach, which emphasizes the role of the sovereign power, is erroneously made out to be an alternative approach. See also my remarks in note 41 below. 39. Treatise 3.2, p. 490. 40. Hayek 1967. See also Hamowy 1987. 41. "Nor is the rule concerning the stability of possession the less deriv'd from human conventions, that it arises gradually, and acquires force by a slow progression, and by our repeated experience of the inconveniences of trans- gressing it. On the contrary, this experience assures us still more, that the sense of interest has become common to all our fellows, and gives us a confidence of the future regularity of their conduct: And 'tis only on the expectation of this, that our moderation and abstinence are founded. In like manner are languages gradually establish'd by human conventions without any promise (i.e., without formal contract]. In like manner do gold and silver become the common measures of exchange, and are esteem'd sufficient payment for what is of a hundred times their value" (Treatise 3.2, p. 490). There is sizable and significant literature about the importance of "spon- taneous social orders" and Hume's pioneering contributions. See, e.g., Hayek 1969, Haakonssen 1981. This aspect of Hume's thought has, quite naturally, become the basis for the claim that Hobbes's mighty, law-giving, sovereign power is at odds with Hume's evolutionary "invisible hand" approach. I emphasize that Hume said that both the concept of property (the idea itself) and certain rudimentary property-rights structures emerged gradually over generations. However, without government involvement the property-rights structures will begin to shrink and decay in large developing economies. Suppose hypothetically they decay completely, and we return to the awful state of nature. The experience now gone by will have left an image on our</page><page sequence="28">Hobbes's Influence on Hume 425 minds of property and the possibility of a genuine property-rights structure. Perhaps this mental image can motivate individuals to recreate those property- rights structures again in the future. Government is needed to establish and stabilize those structures. 42. Treatise 3.4, p. 514. 43- Treatise 3.4, p. 514. Libanius, a pagan teacher at Antioch in the fourth century, offered a classic and compact rationale for commerce: it provided men with the "common enjoyment of the fruits of earth" to offset the fact that "God did not bestow all products upon all parts of the earth [evenly]." This meant that one man would "need the help of another" (cited in Viner 1978, 37). Libanius' insight was repeated over and over again in the medieval literature and, I suppose, was taken for granted by Hume as obviously true. 44. Treatise 3.4, p. 514. 45. Treatise 3.4, p. 514. 46.

[M]en have invented a symbolical delivery, to satisfy the fancy, where the real one is impracticable.

Hume follows Hobbes when he refers to property-rights structures and contract law as human "inventions." In response to the objection to my thesis that there is a world of difference between Hobbes's "sovereign-created-law" and Hume's "custom-created-law," let me narrow the differences as follows. (1) When Hobbes spoke of a "sovereign power," he did not mean necessarily a single monarch or dictator. The sovereign power could be found in a voting body, such as a legislature, where customary practices may play a part. (2) Hume repeatedly emphasized (after Mandeville) the role magistrates and politicians play in shaping the common man's attitudes and understanding of the legal rules {Treatise 3-5, pp. 520, 523-525). Also, consider this (typical) remark by Hume: "Those rules, by which property, right, and obligation are determin'd, have in them no marks of a natural origin, but many of artifice and contriv- ance" (3.6, 526-528). To the extent government magistrates learn how to alter public opinion. Hume's position moves closer to Hobbes's! At another place Hume wrote: "These rules, then, are artificially invented for a certain purpose, and are contrary to the common principles of human nature, which accom- modate themselves to circumstances, and have no stated invariable method of operation" (3.6, 532-533).</page><page sequence="29">426 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology 50.

An employee comes into lawful possession of, say, funds and converts them to his own use, never intending to return them. Prior to the eighteenth century this was not a recognized crime, and it had to be made unlawful by legislative enactment. Under the common law there was no "trespass" and thus no larceny. Obvi- ously the shift toward a bustling, commercial economy was associated with new sorts of quarrels and disputes that were much less common in an agricultural setting. Most of these probably do involve movable commodities of one sort or another, as Hume contends. Cf. LaFave and Scott 1972, 618-22. 54. Moss 1977, 26ln. Taylor (1987) anticipates my position by modeling Hobbes and Hume in a broader framework. 55. Elements 2.1, p. 84; cf. Leviathan 17, pp. 224-225. 56. Elements 1.19, pp. 77-82; 2.1, pp. 83-92. The "transition problem" in Hobbes, from separate, individual families - the multitude - into a nation or "commonwealth" (to use Hobbes's term), has been the subject of intensive academic scrutiny. See, e.g., Gauthier 1969; Moss 1977; Kavka 1986; Hampton 1986. 57. See Leviathan 17, p. 227; 21, pp. 264-265; 22, pp. 281-86; 24, pp. 294-300; 27, pp. 338-39, see Elements 2.8, pp. 143-144. 58.

Certainly it has not been convincing to members of the legal profes- sion, who list "duress" as a defense to any lawsuit for breach of contract. This would permit the victim to void the contract should he decide it is in his interest to do so; see Farnsworth 1982, 267. A necessary condition for the enforcement of any contract under modern law is that the essential terms of the contract be freely "bargained for" (66-79). 66. Cf. his discussion of "the fool" (Leviathan 15, pp. 203-205). 67. Treatise 3.5, pp. 516-525. 68. "Here, therefore, we feign a new act of the mind, which we call the willing an obligation; and on this we suppose the morality to depend. But we have prov'd already, that there is no such act of the mind, and consequently that promises impose no natural obligation" (Treatise 3.5, p. 523).</page><page sequence="30">Hobbes's Influence on Hume All 69. Treatise 3.5, pp. 520-521. 70. "When a man says he promises any thing, he in effect expresses a resolution of performing it; and along with that, by making use of this form of words, subjects himself to the penalty of never being trusted again in case of failure" (3-5, p. 522). His suggestions that prisoner-dilemma problems might best be analyzed in the context of "repetitious plays" and that the knowledge that the situation will reoccur may affect the outcome, directly anticipates the modern thesis that cooperation will emerge in repeated plays. See Alexrod 1984. 71. Treatise 3.5, pp. 521-522. 72. See Axelrod 1984. For a contrasting view see Frank (1988, 43-70), who argues that certain members of society keep their promises even when it is profitable not to keep them, because they deeply believe that this is the right thing to do. 73.

See also Hobbes, Leviathan 23; Mandeville 1732. 79. Hume appears to move away from an earlier argument that men keep their promises because of a long-run interest in not gaining a reputation for promise-breaking, now that professional administrators (that is, the magis- trates) "constrain others" and "inforce the debates of equity thro' the whole society" {Treatise Ã²l , p. 537). This line of argument supplants the "reputation" argument in the Treatise and brings Hume's text closer to Hobbes's. 80. Treatise 3.5, p. 537. 81. See, e.g., "Government and superiority can only be cstablish'd by consent: The consent of men, in establishing government, imposes on them a new obligation, unknown to the laws of nature. Men, therefore, are bound to obey their magistrates, only because they promise it; and if they had not given their word, either expressly or tacitly, to preserve allegiance, it would never have become a part of their moral duty" (3.8, p. 542). A number of writers have submitted the moral-duty argument to careful scrutiny. See, e.g., Harrison 1981. Cf. Hobbes, Leviathan 23; Mandeville 1732. Unfortunately, in his pioneering work on Hume, Hayek (1967) did not emphasize this connection. 82. Treatise 3.6, p. 526. 83. Hobbes emphasized self-preservation. Surely it is a motive for action but cannot be by itself sufficient grounds for "moral duty" or obligation. On the tension between prudence and obligation in Hobbes's work see Warren- der 1957, 200-221. 84. See Hume 1985.</page><page sequence="31">428 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology 85.
