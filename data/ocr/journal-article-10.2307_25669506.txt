<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHAPTER FOUR: UPPER REPUBLICAN MATERIAL REMAINS FROM MEDICINE CREEK Of the 39,969 total specimens recovered in the Medicine Creek Reservoir, there were 2820 Upper Republican rim sherds and 4554 classifiable Up per Republican artifacts (whole or fragmentary) made of stone, bone, antler, and shell. Appendix II supplies distributions of ceramics and Appendix III gives distributions of stone, bone, ander, and shell artifacts. Considerable amounts of unworked stone and unidentifiable animal bone were discarded in the field and thus are not represented in the total specimen count. Other specimens, particularly body sherds and charred vegetable materials, often were cataloged as single "lots." Therefore, al though the total specimen count is sizable, it un derestimates the materials retrieved in the field. As of 1997, the specimens collected by NSHS remain at the Museum of Nebraska History in Lincoln, Nebraska. The bulk of the collections made by the RBS was deposited in the Smith sonian Institution, Washington, D.C. Minor distri butions of the RBS collection have been made in past years. The unworked animal bones are stored at the University of Nebraska State Museum (UNSM), Lincoln. Portions of the unworked mus sel shell collection also have been transferred to UNSM. The National Park Service in Lincoln (succes sor to the Missouri Basin Project of the RBS) has loaned portions of the pottery collection to the University of Michigan, the University of Kansas, the W. H. Over Museum in South Dakota, the University of South Dakota, and the Joslyn Art Museum in Omaha, Nebraska. POTTERY Most of the pottery analysis was carried out by the authors during the winters of 1947, 1948, and 1949. Accepted 1940s pottery terminology for the Central Plains area was used for description and is retained in this study. Rim forms were described as either Wedel's (1934:188) Class I or Class II. During analysis, we developed a third rim form that we called Class HI. Sherds believed to represent restorable ves sels and identified as such in the field were sacked separately. After cataloging (in some cases prior to this process), all sherds from a particular site and/or feature were laid out on tables. The goal was to consolidate rim sherds into individual ves sels. We first sorted out all similar rim sherds, then attempted to fit them together. This process re duced the number of sherd isolates by about 10 to 20% percent at some sites. The second step con sidered details of individual body sherds and matched them with other body sherds. Although this usually involved a judgement call, we believe it generally provided accurate results. It was not enough to consider only sherds from a single house floor when consolidating the pottery remains, since often sherds from house floors matched sherds from trash-filled storage pits. In a few cases, sherds from house floors matched sherds from middens. These synchro nisms are important when considering the size of communities and the overall settlement patterns of Upper Republican people. Our sorting process was successful. For example, 936 rim sherds from 25FT17 were reduced to 445 identifiable vessels. Sample Size Upper Republican sites in the Medicine Creek project produced 2820 rim sherds that were trans posed into 1502 vessels, of which 24 were nearly completely restored (see Appendix II). Two com plete miniature vessels were present. This is prob ably the largest collection presently available from a hmited geographical area in Nebraska and pro vides greater statistical detail than most Upper Republican collections. The number of rim sherds representing a sin gle vessel varied widely among the sites. For ex ample, the 158 rim sherds from Area 1 at 25FT70 represented only 36 vessels, for an average of 4.4 rim sherds per vessel. In contrast, the 106 rim sherds from 25FT30 represented 85 vessels, for an average of 1.2 rim sherds per vessel. The signifi cance of such variation is difficult to ascertain. 94</page><page sequence="2">Kivett &amp; Metcalf Medicine Creek Reservoir Sites with greater numbers of rim sherds reducible to complete vessels may have had shorter occupa tions or may have burned while still occupied, leaving vessels in situ on the floors. Site 25FT14 had an average of 3.4 rim sherds per restored vessel. Houses in Area 1 of 25FT70 and in 25FT14 evidently burned while still in use. Area 2 of 25FT70, with its longer occupation, had an aver age of only two rim sherds per restored vessel. Number of rims per restorable vessel also can be correlated with the techniques used to excavate a site. Some sites, such as 25FT13, with an average of 1.7 rim sherds per restored vessel, were exca vated almost completely with the use of power equipment. Another mechanized excavation was at 25FT17, where an average of 2.1 rim sherds per restored vessel was observed. On the other hand, sites 25FT22 (1.4 rims per vessel), 25FT30 (1.2 rims pervessel), and 25FT36 (1.5 rims pervessel) were all excavated substantially with hand labor. Method of Manufacture All the Upper Republican vessels appear to have been "lump modeled" with no evidence of coiling. Cross sections of sherds appear laminated. Final shaping was done with a cord-wrapped pad dle applied to the exterior. Finger impressions appear on some sherd interiors, suggesting the use of the hand as an anvil. Extra clay may have been smoothed with small stones or removed with other tools. Miniatures may have been fashioned from single lumps of clay. Surface Treatment The descriptive terminology for exterior body treatment was largely restricted to "cord-im pressed" and "smoothed" (i.e., obliterated cord impressions). We were unable to detect any sherds that might be described as "fabric impressed." Evans (1955:36-37) described the cord-impressed technique of vessel surface treatment using a pad dle or dowel wrapped with a series of cords, closely or widely spaced. Vessel surfaces shaped with such tools have vertical or overlapping series of impressions. A cord-wrapped dowel, rather than a paddle, likely was used by Medicine Creek potters on the constricted neck area of several vessels. Hill and Kivett (1940:175-176) suggested the use of a cord wrapped dowel or stick that could be rotated to produce extended and continuous cord impres sions on certain sherds from the Woodland site 25VY1. These impressions extended in a vertical or spiral pattern over the body exterior. The terms "smoothed" or "partially smoothed" in this report refer to a process done after the application of cord impressions. A cord wrapped stick or paddle would have been used to compact the paste during vessel construction. The corded surface of the tool also would have permit ted air to escape and allowed a hand tool to be lifted without distorting the vessel surface. The use of the fingers as an anvil on the inside would have provided support for the cord-impressing action. Butter paddles used in the recent past provide a model of a similar action Butter paddles usually were made of wood grooved or decorated with incised designs. This would keep the implement from sticking to the butter. The cord wrapping may have acted in a similar fashion in the manufacture of ceramics. Exterior surface treatment during the early stage of manufacture was cord impression with a cord-wrapped paddle applied over most of the surface. Final treatment stages often ehminated or smoothed the distinct cord roughening on certain vessels. Cord impressions were placed at various angles, extending both vertically and horizontally and often crisscrossing, particularly at the vessel base. The rim and neck areas usually were smoothed before firing, eliminating any visible evidence of tempering materials. Two to seven impressions per centimeter are observable on sherds where cord impressions remain distinct. Four impressions per centimeter are most com mon. Two-ply cordage, generally twisted clock wise, was used. Cord impressions range from 1 to 2.5 mm in diameter and are up to 1.2 mm deep. Interior surfaces are smooth and tend to have more irregularities than exterior surfaces; often they have shallow finger impressions. Thickness A sample of 414 sherds show extremes from 2.5 to 12 mm in thickness. Only six sherds (-1%) measure less than 3 mm, while 21 sherds (-5%) measure more than 8 mm. The thickness group of 4 to 6 mm contains 258 sherds (62%). Thickness 95</page><page sequence="3">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Memoir 30, VoL 42, No. 162 on a single sherd ranged from 1.5 to 6.5 mm. Rims Class I. This rim form is characterized as either "collared, thickened, or braced" with over hangs that accentuate the constricted neck (Wedel 1934:188; Strong 1935:245). Champe (1936:270 272) and Cooper (1936:35-38) supported this gen eral tenninology. Sigstad (1969:18) accepted the Class I descriptions, but preferred the designation "Frontier Ware." Class H. This rim form lacks the collar de scribed for Class I. Often, the Class II profile ranges from nearly vertical to outwardly flaring. Sigstad (1969:18-19) designated this form as "Cambridge Ware" based on eight rim sherds representing five vessels. Class III. While all nonthickened rims were originally classified as Class II forms, we later separated a minor mug-shaped form designated as Class IH. The Class HI form appears valid and was useful in area comparisons. Previous reports typi cally included all rims lacking a collar or brace in Class II (Wedel 1934:188); therefore, the Class II categories in earlier pottery analyses will include our Class in form. Class III vessels often are called "bowls," but height of these vessels is 80 to 90% of the diameter, producing a form closer in shape to a cup or mug. Occasionally, these forms are described as coconut shaped. Miniatures. The specific size criteria for de fining a miniature vessel are not clear in the litera ture. A somewhat arbitrary size was used for measurable miniatures at Medicine Creek. If the body diameter appeared to have been 100 mm or less, the vessel was classified as a miniature. Lip The term "Up" is used here to designate the uppermost portion of the vessel, the area separat ing the interior from the exterior. Lip treatment varies depending on the form of the vessel. Lip design or decoration consists of parallel diagonal impressions or, less commonly, impressed marks across the narrowed, rounded, or flattened portion of the hp. Roughly 15% (148/998) of all Class I vessels and 23% (100/427) of all Class H vessels have parallel diagonal impressed lips. Overall, 17% (248/1502) of the vessels recovered are decorated on the lip with some form of a diagonal pattern. Only at 25FT19, from which nine vessels were recovered, is there no evidence of diagonal lip treatment. Frequencies of the parallel diagonal impressed lip design at other sites are: 5% (9/180) at 25FT13; 16% (71/445) at 25FT17; 27% (50/183) at 25FT39; 25% (9/36) at 25FT70 Area 1; and 6% (7/117) at 25FT70 Area 2. Lip diagonals are found at a higher ratio on Class I vessels than on any other vessel form. Shape Vessel shape varies notably, with a fair amount of blending between designated shapes. The larger vessels tend to have pronounced shoul ders near the midpoint of the upper third of the vessel. The shoulder surface is slightly sloping, sometimes slightly flattened or almost horizontal. Occasionally, vessels appear to have slumped slightly before or during firing. The underbody is typically globular, rarely slightly elongated. Smaller vessels tend to have less pronounced shoulders with the entire body appearing globular. The constricted necks generally have a nar row line of junction between the rim and body. Mostly, it is at this point where the inwardly slop ing upper body turns up or out to form the rim. This point is generally the narrowest diameter of the vessel above the shoulder. Temper Sigstad (1969:19) reported grog or cmshed sherds as 5 to 10% of the tempering material for 33 body sherds from 25FT35, Mowry Bluff. We did not detect sherds with such tempering in the Medicine Creek collection, but do not doubt grog tempering was present. Since specimens generally were not subjected to binocular microscopic ex amination during laboratory analysis in the 1940s, we did not collect this type of data. Based on macroscopic observations, sand is the most obvi ous tempering material. Fine river sand (including quartz and feldspar) was used in more than 87% of the Upper Republican sherds; angular grit was used rarely. Approximately 10% of the sherds have medium-sized sand tempering. Shell temper ing is noted (e.g., in House 2 at 25FT13), but is rare. Tempering materials are well distributed 96</page><page sequence="4">Kivett &amp; Metcalf Medicine Creek Reservoir through the paste, suggesting the clay was well worked Hairline cracks are occasionally present. Miniature vessels show little or no tempering ma terial. Texture The clay paste is fine to medium-coarse in texture. The latter is typical for sherds containing a greater amount of tempering. Less than 7% of the sherds are granular, with some sherds exhibiting a flaky texture. Breaks tend to be straight or curved rather than jagged. Surfaces appear scaly on a few sherds. Grains of tempering material project through the surface of most sherds, particularly on the interior. Hardness The exterior hardness of the sherds ranges from 3.5 to 4.5 for larger vessels. For miniatures and smaller vessels with minimal tempering, it ranges from 2.5 to 3.5. Color The exterior color of individual sherds and restored vessels varies from black to gray to buff with many sherds showing varying degrees of fire clouding. Gray to black shades (85%) are the most common colors. Approximately 13% of the sherds are buff in color, while less than 3% are red or reddish buff. The buff to red exterior on a limited number of sherds may result from oxidation. Sherd interiors are often carbon coated. Some sherds and one bowl (from 25FT39) show evi dence of a bright red color treatment on the interior surface. This appears to be a hematite stain, per haps from Dakota Sandstone that may have been applied and baked into the surface. Function There is no evidence that highly decorated and undecorated vessels differed in use. The in tended use of certain large vessels may have been for food storage, while medium-sized vessels may have served as cookware. A random, casual ex amination of the restored vessels indicated that larger vessels generally lack the carbon-encrusted body present on many of the medium-sized ves sels. It seems likely that smaller Class III vessels served a purpose different than that of larger vessel forms. The larger Class HI vessels may have had a utilitarian function, perhaps for seed or paint storage. Smaller Class III vessels may represent children's attempts to duplicate the efforts of adult pottery makers. Evaluation of Class I Vessels Class I rims represent 1006 vessels. Of these, eight are Class I miniatures and will be discussed in a later sectioa Calculations in this section are based on the remaining 998 Class I vessels. These represent 66% of the 1502 vessels recovered from the Medicine Creek Upper Republican sites (see Appendix II).11 Class I neck thickness ranges from 3 to 10 mm, with an average thickness of 7 mm. Rims. Overall, Class I rims are straight or slightly everted and are thickened on the exterior lower section to form an overhanging collar. They are modeled from the upper rim and collar area. Rarely, a straight to slightly flaring rim that was folded down is present. The interior surface is either vertical or concave with a slightly con stricted orifice. Most of the Class I rims are decorated with various patterns produced by incised lines in the rim panel. The decorations are completed with a cutting edge; in a few cases, a dull tool was used to drag and depress the surface rather than to cut or incise. Three distinct surface design patterns are discernible in the Upper Republican sites: Parallel Horizontal Incised, Opposed Diagonal Incised, and Parallel Diagonal Incised. Another design category, Miscellaneous Incised, contains rim forms that did not fit into the three distinct incised categories. Some Class I vessels lack any surface design and are discussed at the end of this section under the heading "Smoothed." Parallel Horizontal Incised. The most com mon design pattern observed on Class I vessels (45%; 452/998) is parallel horizontal lines encir cling the rim area just below the outer lip (Fig. 73). These vessels have two to ten parallel lines, the most common being a four-line incised collar, at 27%. Sigstad (1969:21) reported 66% of the Mowry Bluff (25FT35) Class I rims decorated with parallel horizontal incised design. He also stated that three-line incised collars predominated at the site, while Strong (1935:84) found four-line 97</page><page sequence="5">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Memoir 30, VoL 42, No. 162 incised collars were most common. Opposed Diagonal Incised. The second most popular design (12%; 124/998) on the Class I vessels is the opposed diagonal design (Fig. 74). This form of decoration consists of a double series of opposed-V forms filled in with diagonal lines at approximately right angles to the lines in the op posite triangle. A single horizontal line extends around the rim, usually at the top or the bottom of the diagonal pattern. Short diagonals at the base of the lower horizontal line are present, and some times "pie crusting" to produce low nodes. Rarely found is a series of single triangles with the inter vening equal space smoothed and blank. The dis tribution of opposed diagonal rim designs varies among the Medicine Creek Upper Republican sites. Parallel Diagonal Incised The third most common incised design (6%; 59/998) on the Class I rims is composed of parallel diagonal lines. At individual sites, the occurrence of this design ranges between zero and 33%. The lines generally extend right (rarely left) from the outer lower edge of the lip to the bottom of the panel formed by the thickened rim (Fig. 75.10, 11, 12). Variations of this design include a single horizontal line at the top and base of the panel (Fig. 75.3). The top and base of the panel were sometimes further deco rated with short diagonals or punctates above or below the horizontal lines (Fig. 75.4). Miscellaneous Incised A variety of non distinct designs make up the remaining 7% (70/998) of Class I incised rims (Fig. 75). These include a series of parallel horizontal incised lines set apart by smoothed rim segments (Fig. 75.1), diamond-shaped incised panels, V-shaped incised lines set upright (Fig. 75 .5), V-shaped incised lines seton their side (Fig. 75.4), and "puneh-and-drag" designs. A small nipple-like protuberance along the lower portion of the collar (Fig. 75.13, 14) was found on vessel rims from 25FT17, 25FT39, and 25FT70. Wedel (1933:160) reported similar de signs from other Medicine Creek sites located above the reservoir area. Smoothed Some Class I vessel rims are un derrated. These have been smoothed to remove the cord impressions (Fig. 76). This pattern ranges in frequency from none at 25FT14 to 16% at 25FT17.12 Lip. Class I lips vary from flattened to rounded, with 83% of vessels identified as rounded. Lip thickness ranges from 4 to 15 mm, and height from 5 to 37 mm. Evaluation of Class n Vessels Class II rims represent 465 vessels of which 38 are Class II miniatures, discussed below. This section includes miniatures in the calculations (see Appendix II).13 Overall, Class II vessels are globular in shape with sloping shoulders. Neck thickness ranges from 4 to 8 mm with the majority between 5 and 6 mm. Rims. The prime characteristic of the Class II rim is its straight to flaring, unthickened profile. Most rims are everted to varying degrees. Infre quendy, the rim is almost vertical. The rims are less frequently decorated than Class I vessel rims. Class II rims are divided into the following cate gories: Parallel Horizontal Incised, Smoothed, and Cord Impressed. Parallel Horizontal Incised. Incised decora tions on Class II rims are in the form of parallel horizontal incised lines (Fig. 77.11). Seven of the Medicine Creek Upper Republican sites yielded one to 11 vessels with this decoratioa On average this design accounts for 6% (25/397) of Class II vessels at the seven sites where they occur, or 5% (25/465) for all Medicine Creek Upper Republican sites. The greatest number of parallel horizontal incised Class II rims come from 25FT13 (13% or 11/82) and from 25FT17 (7% or 7/105). Smoothed The Medicine Creek Upper Re publican sites as a group contained approximately 48% (225/465) of Class II vessels with rims smoothed from the neck area to the lip area, par tially or totally removing any cord impressions (Fig. 77). Smoothed rims range in frequency from 25% (1/4) at 25FT70 Area 1 to 80% (20/25) at 25FT22. Two sites at the northern Umits of the study area have particularly high occurrences of smoothed rims: 25FT22 with 80% and 25FT30 with 88%. Cord Impressed About half of Class II rims retain distinct, unaltered cord impressions (Fig. 77). These impressions typically extend vertically from the rim toward the Up area. This type of Class II rim was present at all sites except 25FT20. In 98</page><page sequence="6">Kivett &amp; Metcalf Medicine Creek Reservoir Figure 73. Parallel Horizontal Incised rim sherds.

Class II lips range from slightly flattened to rounded with the rounded form most common. Evaluation of Class III Vessels Class III rims total 31 vessels or 2% (31/1502) of all vessels. One or more Class III vessels were recovered from nine of the Medicine Creek Upper Republican sites. One restored Class III vessel from House 2 at 25FT39 (#1727) has deep cord impressions over the exterior. The exterior rim has four crudely impressed parallel horizontal incised lines encircling the vessel. The interior is stained red, probably with a hematite slip prior to firing. It is 136 mm high, has a maximum diameter of 151 mm, and an orifice diameter of 70 to 75 mm. A second restored Class III vessel from House 2 at 25FT22 has a similar shape, but lacks any decoration. The cord-marked body is nearly smooth. This vessel is 100 mm high, has a mouth diameter of 104 mm, and a maximum body diame ter (near the center of its height) of 125 mm. The orifices of both vessels are slightly con stricted. Without this trait, differentiating these vessels from some Class II vessels would have been difficult. Class III vessels typically have nar rowed and rounded lips. They have no discernible neck area. These restorable vessels are slightly wider than they are tall and are more mug shaped than bowl shaped. The form is coconut-like with one end flattened. Rims. Class III rims are vertical and nearly straight to inverted. Only one vessel has parallel horizontal incised decorations below its outer lip with well-defined cord marks on its body. Ap proximately 86% of Class III rims have smoothed cord impressions. Lip. Lips are narrowed and rounded on Class III vessels. Evaluation of Miniatures Rim sherds representing 46 miniature vessels were recovered from 10 of the Medicine Creek Upper Republican sites. Eight of the miniatures are Class I, or less than 1% (8/1006) of all Class I vessels. Thirty-eight of the miniatures are Class II, or 8.2% (38/465) of all Class II vessels. Class I 101</page><page sequence="9">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Memoir 30, VoL 42, No. 162 miniature vessels occur at four of the Medicine Creek Upper Republican sites, and Class II mini atures at only nine of the sites. Only three sites (25FT16, 25FT17, and 25FT22) had both Class 1 and Class II miniatures. A direct correlation be tween the formal assignment for rniniatures and the overall distribution of non-miniatures through out all sites was not detected The body diameters for two relatively com plete vessels range between 60 and 65 mm, and heights between 60 and 62 mm. An estimated 80 to 90% of the miniature vessels exceed 75 mm in diameter or height. Generally, the smaller the ves sel, the more crude the workmanship. Class I miniatures may have parallel incised lines on their collars, but decoration is lacking on Class II miniature vessels. The paste tends to have less tempering than larger vessels. The hps are rounded to slightly beveled, usually from 1 to 4 mm thick. Overall, the miniatures could be de scribed as having rounded shoulders and globular bodies. Some miniature vessels may have been made by children. In particular, the very small vessels reflect crude efforts. Sometimes the immature ap pears to have been modeled from a ball of clay with little or no temper added. Many lack cord impres sions. Other miniatures reflect considerable skill and artistic ability, particularly those with Class I rims. Some of the very small miniatures were probably the work of children, and the rest prob ably were made for special purposes by skilled potters. The historic Pawnee sometimes used well made miniatures as grave furnishings (Wedel 1936:64). Strong (1935:108-109), however, did not report miniature vessels at the Graham Os suary. Evaluation of Restored Vessels Twenty-four completely or partially restored vessels were recovered from nine of the Medicine Creek Upper Republican sites. See Table IIA in Appendix II for the measurements and descrip tions of these vessels. Other restorations may still be possible in the collection, since field records suggest a larger number of restorable vessels is present. All vessels showed evidence of cord impres sions. In most, the impressions are distinct and tend to be more vertical on the upper portion and base of the vessel. A smoothing or erasing of the cord marks is common in the neck area. On some vessels, the neck area lacks any evidence of the original cord impressions. Both 25FT17 and 25FT70 (Areas 1 and 2) yielded five restored vessels. The most extensive excavations were carried out at these two sites. Four restored vessels (17%) were recovered from a single house floor (House 1) at 25FT14. The largest restored vessel came from House 9 at 25FT17. This Class I vessel was recovered along with a second large vessel. The larger has a maximum body diameter of 380 mm and a height of 342 mm. As a series, the five restored vessels from 25FT17 have an average maximum diameter of 280 mm and an average vessel height of 260 mm. Four of the vessels from 25FT70 on which complete measurements can be determined have an average maximum body diameter of 216.3 mm and an average vessel height of 196.5 mm. All restored vessels but one have a body di ameter exceeding vessel height. The exception is a Class II vessel from 25FT20, for which height (60 mm) is equal to maximum body diameter. The ratio of vessel height to body diameter ranges from 80% on Class III vessels at 25FT22 to 100% on the single Class II vessel at 25FT20 just men tioned. Seven vessels (30.4%) have a ratio of ves sel height to body diameter ranging from 80 to 89.9%, and 16 vessels (69.6 %) range from 90 to 100%. The height is undetermined on one incom plete vessel restoration. Height for the 13 Class I vessels ranges from 95 to 342 mm, with the average 251 mm. The seven Class II vessels range in height from 60 to 299 mm, with the average 179 mm. Two Class IH vessels are 100 mm and 136 mm tall, for an aver age of 118 mm. Generalizations based on the restored vessels cannot be definitive, since only 24 of 1502 vessels (1.6%) are represented; however, it is possible that the average height of Class I vessels, based on this limited sample, is greater than the average for Class n vessels. Most of the restorable vessels (21, or 88%) came from house floors, two from interior storage pits, and just one from a middea Restorable ves sels recovered from house floors also are com 102</page><page sequence="10">Kivett &amp; Metcalf Medicine Creek Reservoir plete, perhaps because they were undamaged up until the moment the house was destroyed or aban doned. Their presence often is taken to indicate that a house was occupied when it burned. Comparative Analysis of Rim Form For comparative purposes, we provide the results of pottery analysis from Metcalf s (1939) study of Davis Creek, where extensive excava tions comparable to those at Medicine Creek were carried out by NSHS in Greeley, Howard, and Sherman counties in Nebraska. With the aid of WPA labor, seven Upper Republican sites (Met calf 1939) and one Woodland Valley focus site (Hill and Kivett 1940:215-217) were explored. Rim sherds from the 31 excavated house floors represented 1070 vessels, of which 28 were restor able. Class I vessels numbered 508 (47%), 99% of these (n = 502) with decorated rims. Less than 2% of Class II vessels were decorated. A single date of AD 1138?200 (M-835) is available for the Coufal site, 25HW6, one of the largest Davis Creek sites. This date suggests an occupancy roughly contemporaneous with the Medicine Creek sites. Many house floors at Davis Creek were semisubterranean, originally excavated 12 to 44 inches into subsoil. This contrasts with Medicine Creek houses, which were at or only slightly below the old surface, the latter resulting chiefly from efforts to achieve a level floor on a natural slope. The deeper excavations for house floors at Davis Creek sites is a trait shared with the Nebraska Culture. Other traits present at Davis Creek but rare or absent at Medicine Creek also suggest greater Nebraska Culture influence. For example, 11 polished stone celts, a common Nebraska Cul ture trait, were recovered from the Davis Creek sites, and only seven from Medicine Creek. Loop or strap handles and lugs occurred on pottery at Davis Creek but not at Medicine Creek. Single-cord designs were rare at Davis Creek (6 vessels or 2%) but were not recorded at all at Medicine Creek. Metcalf (1939) reports a frag ment of a small ladle from the surface of 25HW6. Three other sites at Davis Creek produced a total of 23 baked clay objects identified as "spindle whorls," some of them decorated with an incised pattern. Such objects are not represented in the inventory from Medicine Creek sites. Wedel (1934:205) has, however, listed perforated clay disks as an Upper Republican trait. Other items present at Davis Creek but not appearing in the Medicine Creek inventory include pottery effigies. The most common pottery decoration at Davis Creek sites is a series of opposed diagonals present on 204 ofthe Class I vessels (40.63%). At Medicine Creek only 122 of the Class I vessels (24.45%) carry this design. The second most popular design at Davis Creek, on 74 vessels (14.74%), consists of two to seven parallel hori zontal incised lines. In contrast, 445 Class I vessels (44.38%) at Medicine Creek have this design, making it the most common there. A cross-hatched pattern formed by a series of diamond-shaped lines occurs in 10% of the Davis Creek vessels (Metcalf 1939), but makes up a very minor percentage of the pottery at Medicine Creek and is placed in our study in the Other Design category. STONE ARTIFACTS Strong's (1935:87-94) proposed classifica tion system for stone tools (Fig. 78) was used when possible. His system was based on one advanced by Thomas Wilson in the 1899 article, "Arrow points, spearheads, and knives of prehistoric times." Regarding chipped tools, Strong (1935:87) wrote: For the purpose of describing and comparing types of chipped arrowpoints, spear heads, and knives, a classification based entirely upon form rather than assumed function has been employed. The types are shown in outline [Fig. 404] with the characteristics on which they are segregated somewhat exaggerated. These outlines are entirely irrespective of size. Although size is important in distinguishing between arrowpoints and two other types of artifacts, it does not enter into the follow ing classification, which is based entirely on form. Raw Materials The bulk of the raw material used by the Upper Republican peoples to fashion stone tools appears to have been readily available in the im mediate area. Wedel (1986:28-31) discussed the local mineral resources and Holen (1983) pre sented extensive data for a larger geographical area. Most of the stone tools were fashioned from Republican River jasper, also called Graham jas 103</page><page sequence="11">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Memoir 30, VoL 42, No. 162 m^^BBm^===so'^^^m'^^ NQT STEMHED OOOQfl MA* NAb1 MAb2 NAb3 NAb4 A. leaf shaped AAAAAAAAA NBa NBa1 NBa2 NBa3 NBa4 NBb NBb1 NBb2 NBc B. triangular shaped 00 I 00 I 0 NC NCa NO NO a NE C. diamond shaped D. straight sided E. round or ovoid STEMMED_ AA6 4A0 SAa SAb SAc SBa SBb SBc A. contracting stem B. parallel sided stem 6AAAAA0 SCal SCa2 SCa3 SCb1 SCb2 SCb3 SCc II C. expanding stem Figure 78.

This silicified chalk occurs as thin strata or nodules in the upper beds of the white or yellow Smoky Hill chalk in the Cretaceous Nio brara Formation. Wedel (1986:28-30) discussed its distribution in the Smoky Hill Republican River drainages. This type of jasper outcrops in the Medicine Creek Reservoir area, particularly along Lime Creek. Jasper in this area occurs in a variety of colors including shades of red, yellow, brown, and green. A second local raw material used in stone tool manufacture is a greenish to grayish quartzite. During construction of the dam, a quartzite quarry was opened near the west bank of Medicine Creek, a short distance southwest of site 25FT16. Quar ried materials were used as riprap for the dam. Only limited use was made of this material in antiquity. Some of the larger, more coarsely chipped chopping tools are made of quartzite. Although several quartzite outcrops probably exist in the area, we were unaware of the material's presence until the modem construction quarry was located by Reclamation Geologist, Charles Os born. A variety of other lithic materials in the region were used, including stones secured from stream gravels, petrified wood, and agate. Several specimens in the Upper Republican stone artifact assemblage come from beyond the region. The few obsidian specimens were prob ably carried into the area from the west. A buff to pinkish chert used for the more finely chipped tools probably originated in the Flat Top quarries northwest of Sterling, Colorado (Wedel 1986:111). Nehawka chert from the Pennsylva nian System and Blue Springs chert from the Per mian System in the Flint Hills were exploited very rarely. Also represented in the assemblage, in lim ited quantity, are quartzite from the Spanish Dig gings in Wyoming and alibates agatized dolomite from the Texas Panhandle. The bulk of the abrading tools are made of dark to light gray sandstone of the Pliocene Ogalalla formations that occur in the area. Dakota sandstone was used more rarely. Local geologists have reported Dakota outcrops to the south in Kansas and to the east in Nebraska. The hematite from Medicine Creek sites may have been associ ated with the Dakota sandstone. Cobblestones of quartz, sandstone, diorite, and granite are available from nearby stream beds. Considerable use was made of Cretaceous Nio brara chalk that outcrops along Medicine Creek. Some quartz crystals and pieces of amazonite may have come from the Rocky Mountain area. Arti facts of amazonite are not often reported from the Central Plains area. The local availability of raw materials, par ticularly jasper, may have been an incentive for prehistoric groups to live in the Medicine Creek area. With modes of transportation limited to dog or human power in precontact times, a readily available supply of stone could have been an im portant determining factor of village location. Similar Nebraska Culture village concentrations are in the Weeping Water Valley and in southeast ern Nebraska, where the Nehawka chert is readily available. Roper (1988:531-534) reported the recovery in Medicine Creek sites of two minerals, malachite and turquoise, rare for Upper Republican village sites. Malachite was identified at site 25FT158, which may be a duplicate numbering of site 25FT15 reported here. Turquoise also was identi fied from 1987 excavations in House 4 at 25FT22. (As discussed below, the turquoise and amazonite should be reexamined.) Chipped Stone Projectile Points. Projectile points are rela tively scarce in the Medicine Creek Upper Repub lican sites. Only 201 classifiable points and 34 unclassifiable points were recovered (Fig. 79). Overall, workmanship is good, but there are some crude examples. Using Strong's stone tool classi fication, 18 different point forms are identified at the sites (Figs. 78 and 79), divided into two general types: unstemmed (N) and stemmed (S). Overall distribution of projectile points by type is shown in Figure 80. Unstemmed Projectile Points. The most common type of point is the unstemmed variety, with 174 specimens or 87% of the classifiable total. Four different forms are found: NA (leaf shaped); NBa (triangular, straight base); NBb (tri angular, concave base); and NBc (triangular, convex base). The NB series of points range in length between 17 and 60 mm with the average 105</page><page sequence="13">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Memoir 30, VoL 42, No. 162 Figure 79.

Overall, the unstemmed points are smaller, more skillfully chipped, and made from flakes rather than cores. NA Form. These leaf-shaped points were relatively scarce (n = 4, 2%). The four specimens range in length between 33 and 48 mm and are moderately well flaked. Basal shapes vary. One point has a convex base, one point has a straight base, and two have a concave base. NBa Form These triangular points with straight bases (n = 115,57%) occur in notched and unnotched forms and represent some of the finest examples of chipping. Fifty-one of the NBa points have a straight base. As a series, NBa unnotched triangular points are somewhat larger and less carefully chipped than other triangular points. Several may have served as knives rather than as projectiles. Twenty-eight of the points have two side notches and a straight base (NBal). Twenty seven points have the two side notches and one basal notch (NBa2). Nine points have four side notches and one basal notch (NBa3). Two of the NBa3 points come from a storage pit at 25FT17. These points have two notches on one edge and only one notch on the other (Fig. 79.15,16). NBb Form These triangular points with con cave bases (n = 26, 13%) include five that are unnotched (NBb). Eleven points have two side notches (NBbl). Ten points have two side notches and one basal notch (NBb2). NBc Form These triangular points (n = 29, 14%) lack the typical syrnmetrical concave base. Stemmed Projectile Points. Stemmed points are represented by 27 specimens (13% of the total), including a wide range of sizes from 22 to 62 mm long (Fig. 79.18, 20, 26, 27). Most are somewhat heavier and cmder than the unstemmed variety and tend to be thicker in relation to their width. A greater percentage of stemmed points are fash ioned from nonlocal stones. A good many of the stemmed points are be lieved to be from Woodland or earlier occupations of the sites or of the general area. This is true particularly for points recovered at 25FT17, where both Upper Republican and Woodland artifacts are represented. (Note that seven, or 21% of the 34 unclassifiable points were recovered from 25FT17.) Some of the stemmed points from other sites also can be assigned to an earlier period. Wedel (1986:196) [Editor's note: the year citation was left blank in the manuscript; our best guess is that the 1986 publication was meant.] found that 10-12% of the projectile points from four Upper Republican sites are identified as stemmed. He described the majority as fairly heavy and roughly chipped. He further suggested that they were relatively wide, seldom exceeding 2 inches in length Klippel (1969:33) noted one such stemmed point from the Mowry Bluff Site (25FT35) where "...it is probable that the point was manufactured as a projectile at an earlier time period and was discovered much later by an in habitant ofthe Mowry Bluff Site (25FT35), who may have used it in a very different way than did the original manufacturer." The fact that most such points from the reser voir study area are fashioned of nonlocal stone probably supports Klippel's theory. As at 25FT17, where stemmed points comprise 21% of the point total, Medicine Creek Upper Republican sites may have been located on top of sites previously occu pied by earlier groups. (On the other hand, 25FT13 had 23% stemmed points without any evidence of an earlier occupation) Unclassifiable Projectile Points. Two points of unusual form came from 25FT17 and deserve special attention (Fig. 81). The first (25FT17 1345) came from a midden and is made of very fine grained gray quartzite. The raw material pos sibly originated in the Spanish Diggings in Wyo ming. The point measures 27 by 54.5 mm and does not exceed 9 mm in maximum thickness. The greatest width occurs at a distance 25 to 27 mm above the point tip. One edge is nearly straight, the other slightly convex. Toward the base, the stem narrows slightly to 22 mm across and the base itself measures 25 mm wide. The base has a shal low concavity 2 mm in depth. Flaking on the faces and edges, particularly near the base, is a little indistinct, as if ground. Thickness of this point near the tip suggests a greater original length and some reworking. In both raw material type and form, this point is unlike other known Upper Re publican aspect projectiles. It resembles a Scottsbluff point and may have originated from a Paleoindian site on nearby Lime Creek, where Davis (1962:63-64) recorded a Scottsbluff point from Zone 1 at 25FT41. Klippel (1969:33) found 107</page><page sequence="15">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Memoir 30, VoL 42, No. 162 a similar point at Mowry Bluff (25FT35), which is just south of 25FT17. Klippel suggested the Mowry Bluff point may represent an aboriginal collector's item The second unusual projectile point (25FT17 53) consists of only a basal fragment. This point, made of light gray chalcedony, was broken near its greatest width (20 mm). The fragment is 29 mm long and tapers toward a base 13.5 mm wide. A basal notch is slightly more than 1 mm deep. One face is convex and well chipped, while the oppo site has a nearly planar surface and is retouched only near the edges. In style, this point also is suggestive of an earlier horizoa Drills. Drills are represented by 13 specimens from five sites (Fig. 82.1-8). Several of the more finely shaped drills are fashioned from gray to purple chalcedony and the remaining ones are local jasper. The drills are divided into two general groups: those made from broken or modified pro jectile points and those originally made as drills. Five drills are reworked projectile points: three from 25FT17 (Fig. 82.5, 7-8), one from 25FT13, and one from 25FT16. An inspection of the unmodified bases suggests that two are of NBa form, one is SCal form, one is SCb form, and one is indeterminate (see Fig. 78). The other specimens are thought to have been made purposefully as drills. Most of these have an expanding base. The most common drill shaft form of the expanding base type is diamond shaped in cross section. These drills generally have a gradual slope from shoulder to base and are either straight or slightly concave (Fig. 82.14). They range in length between 30 and 52 mm. A typical drill from this group would have a length of 48 mm, a base width of 23 mm, and a thickness of 3 to 5.5 mm. Craftsmanship ranges from cmde to carefully worked. One very delicately chipped drill (from 25FT17) is an excellent example of a T-type drill (Fig. 82.1). It is 27 mm long with a straight base and 15 mm wide. The shaft is oval in cross section with thickness from 2 to 4 mm. Gravers. There are five gravers from five different sites (Fig. 82.9-12). All are fashioned from rectangular flakes. Only the tips and edges show secondary chipping. The tips are either straight or slightly hooked at the point. The hooked forms suggest a rather hasty manufacture. The graver tips are pointed or slightly blunted. The shafts show little or no use. One typical graver from 25FT13 (Fig. 82.10) is 51 mm long, 30 mm wide at the base, and has a narrowed point extend ing 12 mm. This specimen ranges between 2 and 7 mm thick. Scrapers. The Upper Republican scrapers (Figs. 83-85) are more carefully made than Wood land examples. They are less frequent in number than scrapers in later complexes (e.g., the Dismal River and Lower Loup aspects) and are divided into six categories. Overall, the smaller the scraper, the more likely it is fashioned of nonlocal stone. Class I. These scrapers are represented by 77 specimens, often called the "thumbnail" type be cause of their small size (Fig. 83.1-7). The primary area of retouch on this type of scraper forms a snub nose. Edges above the snub nose and dorsal sur face are shaped by the removal of long, broad flakes. The curved ventral surface remains un modified. Class I scrapers vary from an elongated subelliptical to nearly circular form. The thickest point of the scraper is usually just above the work ing end. The area above the retouched edge is usually flat, but a keel is sometimes present. Class I scrapers range from 21 to 40 mm long, with an average length not exceeding 30 mm. Class II. These scrapers are represented by 150 specimens and differ from Class I in their greater length to width ratio (Fig. 83.8-13). In addition, Class II scrapers usually have a more pronounced keel or dorsal ridge. This morphologi cal feature results when fine flakes are removed along the edges and dorsal surface. Smoothing on both sides and one end suggest that Class II scrap ers were used as end scrapers as well as side scrapers. The thickest area on these scrapers usu ally occurs just above the steep retouched end. Class II scrapers range between 35 and 85 mm long, 20 and 25 mm wide, and 5 and 10 mm thick. The longer scrapers usually have a pronounced curve along the natural fracture lines of the lithic material. Class III. These scrapers are represented by 96 specimens (Fig. 83.14-20). The category is composed of "true" side scrapers, ranging in length between 58 and 85 mm. Their width is 108</page><page sequence="16">Kivett &amp; Metcalf Medicine Creek Reservoir Figure 81.

Greatest thickness occurs near the midpoint of the scraper and ranges between 4 and 10 mm. The ends of these scrapers have been thinned with moderately coarse flaking to a narrow, somewhat rounded point. Flaking on the edges and dorsal surface is finer, giving a rounded surface or a slight ridge extending the length of the scraper. The undersur face most commonly is straight so that the working edges have little curvature. Class IV. These scrapers are represented by 87 specimens varying in shape more than airy of the other categories of scrapers (Fig. 84.1-6). Class IV scrapers are made from thick flakes worked only on one face. The edges are usually finely chipped to a steep bevel. This group usually has one chipped, but flat face. The unworked under surface follows the curvature of the flake. Class V. These scrapers are represented by 44 specimens and are semilunate in form (Fig. 84.7 11). The chipping on these scrapers is somewhat coarse and the specimens are not particularly well shaped. Typically, these scrapers are made from long, thick flakes worked only on one surface and are often slightly curved longitudinally, following the natural fracture planes of the stone. The worked face is either keeled or slightly rounded due to the removal of long, narrow flakes. The distinguishing feature of the Class V scraper is flaking on one or both edges in such a fashion that a marked concavity is produced. This concavity can be up to 30 mm deep and is usually hourglass or lunate in form. The worked edges of the con cavity are short and steep to form a scraping edge rather than a cutting edge. Class V scrapers range in length between 50 and 164 mm and in width between 26 and 61 mm. They would have made excellent tools for scraping poles or similar ob jects. Class VI. These scrapers include retouched flakes of various sizes and shapes (Fig. 85.1-13). Many could have performed cutting as well as scraping functions. Examples were found at all the sites, with a total of 417 specimens recovered. Retouched flake scrapers were particularly com mon at 25FT13, but rare at 25FT17. Knives. Chipped knife blades are well repre sented, especially at the more extensively exca Ill</page><page sequence="19">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Memoir 30, Vol 42, No. 162 vated sites (Figs. 86-89). A greater percentage of the 184 classifiable knives are made from local jasper than are projectile points, scrapers, and similarly small chipped artifacts. All knives are worked on both faces and are generally well made. Knives are divided into seven categories, Classes I through VII, several of which may represent variations of other categories. Class I. These knives are pointed to slightly rounded on the ends (Fig. 86.1-5). There are 27 specimens, or 15% of the total. They are well flaked with finer retouching along the edges. Oc casionally, one edge is chipped to a bevel. On others, one edge is straight, while the opposite edge slopes with both ends extending to an angular or rounded area from near the midpoint of the edge. When the edge is beveled and angular, the type approaches the Class II or alternately beveled (diamond-shaped) form of knife. One of the larger Class I knives is 103 mm long and 45 mm in maximum width (at its midpoint). Maximum thickness of 13 mm occurs near its center. One of the smaller Class I knives is 70 mm long, 28 mm in maximum width, and 5 mm thick. Class II. These knives belong to the NCa or "Harahey" form of the Strong (1935) classifica tion (Fig. 87.3-5). There are 25 specimens, 15% of the total. Class II knives are roughly diamond shaped with four edges beveled in alternate direc tions. Occasionally, one or two edges lack the bevel. Wedel (1934:195) suggested a special dis tribution for this type of knife and Dunlevy (1936:195) noted the form does not appear in this area until the Upper Republican period and seems to continue through time into the contact period. Class II knives range in length between 82 and 192 mm and in width between 32 and 46 mm. Thick ness varies only from 6 to 8 mm. The angle formed by the sides is quite sharp on many shorter Class II knives, suggesting that the specimens were re worked to sharpen the edge. Some Class II speci mens may have started out as Class I forms and acquired their diamond shapes from later reshar pening. Class III. This category approximates the NAM form proposed by Strong (1935) (Fig. 88.1 2). There are 40 specimens (22%) from seven sites. These knives have one end rounded and the other end pointed. Chipping is moderately well done and the range of thickness (e.g., 5 to 10 mm) is greater than occurs in Class II specimens. The length ranges between 45 and 137 mm and the greatest width, occurring just forward of the base, ranges between 16 and 44 mm. Class IV. These knives have convex to straight to slightly concave bases that approximate Strong's (1935) NAb3 or NBa forms (Fig 88.3-6). There are 34 specimens, or 18% of the total. Oc casionally, knives of this category have one edge that slopes diagonally to the point, while the other edge is nearly straight. On others, the edges narrow symmetrically toward the tip. The diagonal edge on several knife blades is thick and shows little use, while the base and the edges near the base show ample wear. This pattern of use suggests that the straight base may have been the working edge with the diagonal pointed area mounted in a han dle. Class IVknives range between 38 and 148 mm long. Their greatest width, slighdy more than one half their length, ranges between 25 and 70 mm. Greatest thickness, usually along the midline, ranges between 6 and 10 mm. Class V. This knife category resembles Strong's (1935) NAa form with both ends rounded to pointed (Fig 87.1-2). There are 31 specimens, or 17% of the total. Class V knives are well chipped, but somewhat crudely shaped. Both faces and the edges are retouched. Length ranges from 86 to 171 mm and greatest width, near the mid point, from 30 to 51 mm. There is considerable variation in thickness on individual knives, rang ing from 5 mm at the thinned edge to 8 mm near the center. Several shorter, thicker Class V knives have one beveled edge. There is no evidence of a keel or ridge on these knives. Class VI. These ovoid-shaped knives are similar to Strong's (1935) NE form (Fig. 89.1-4). Of 25 specimens (14%), 12 are from 25FT13. Most are coarsely flaked, but some well-worked specimens are present. Class VI knives range be tween 58 and 171 mm long, with greatest width between 31 and 61 mm near the midpoint. Greatest thickness is along the ridge or keel, ranging from 5 to 10 mm. Class VII. Two incomplete but distinctive specimens (1% of total knives) are obviously knife blades modified for hafting at or near the base (Fig. 89.5-6).

This knife is made from grayish banded quartzite that may be from the Spanish Diggings in Wyoming. Chipping is only moder ately well done. The blade has a slight longitudinal curve. The fragment is 50 mm long and 31 mm in maximum width across the tang. Width at the break is 21 mm and maximum thickness is 8 mm. This specimen shows no evidence of being re worked and probably represents its original form. The second incomplete specimen (#3136) is from 25FT13 and is made of local red jasper. The blade is asymmetrical with one edge beveled. Chipping is coarse over the two faces, but the edges are finely retouched. The extreme tip of the base has been broken off just below two opposed notches. Both notches are approximately 4 mm deep. Length of the fragment is 75 mm and maxi mum width near the midpoint is 41 mm. Thickness ranges from 3 mm at the edges to 6 mm on the face. The width between the two notches is 21 mm. This piece may originally have been a larger knife blade. Chipped Stone Celts. This type of artifact is well represented at all of the Upper Republican sites. In addition to 356 complete chipped celts recovered, 150 celt fragments were also cataloged. Despite the large number of specimens, attempts to create a system to classify the celts did not prove satisfactory. Shape is usually triangular, but a few are more oval (Fig. 90). The bit or butt of the celt is nearly straight or rounded. The sides typically are straight from the poll to the bit, though occa sionally they are slightly concave or convex. On those celts with concave sides, the bits are some what spud-like. The polls are either slightly pointed, rounded, or squared. No direct correlation was observed between the shape of the sides and the shape of the poll or bit. Flaking generally is coarse, but many display some fine retouched edges. Overall, the poorest flaking is on the ovoid specimens. Common to all forms is the biconvex shape in cross section. Many fragmentary bit and poll sec tions are battered and blunted from use. Most of the well-shaped celts show little evidence of use. Since celts were found in large quantities per house (up to 20 from a single house) it is possible not all celts were used as tools. Some of these artifacts may be quarry blanks that were to be w o^edimofirushoi blades or other artifacts. If so, one wonders why such intensive effort was put into shaping blanks. Celts were made almost exclusively from lo cal raw materials, either quarried or gathered from nearby natural exposures. The celts range greatly in size: from 60 to 180 mm in length and from 40 to 85 mm in greatest width, typically at the bit or slightly above it Thickness ranges between 12 and 30 mm, with the average slightly less than 20 mm. Thickness of many specimens appears to have been determined by the thickness of the quarry veia Often, a lime cortex occurs on one or both surfaces of a celt. Choppers. Choppers include a group of bifa cally chipped blades, often ovate in shape (Fig. 91.1, 4, 5), but sometimes long and narrow with straight or nearly parallel sides (Fig. 91.2, 3). A rounded end remains on one chopper. In all there are 113 complete and measurable choppers plus 104 fragmentary specimens. Flaking is usually very coarse with little re touching. The edges are often battered and blunt, as if from heavy use. Occasionally, the edges of the long, narrow choppers are worn round and smooth, as if a sawing rather than a battering motion was used by the maker. The choppers are almost without exception fashioned from local stone. One of the larger ovoid choppers (from 25FT13) is 165 mm long, with a maximum width near the center of 88 mm and a maximum thick ness of 30 mm. The width of choppers with parallel sides is less than one-half their length and the thickness somewhat less than for ovoid forms. Choppers have not been reported consistently for the Upper Republican aspect. This may be because such artifacts were discussed as elements of the "heavy stone industry" (Wedel 1934:194). Blanks and Cores. Coarsely chipped blanks, triangular to oval in shape, are well represented at several Upper Republican sites, with 137 speci mens recorded in all. Direct evidence of use, such as battering or polishing on the edges, is lacking. All blanks are made of local stone. Many weigh more than a pound and may have been brought from the quarry in this form to be later worked into 115</page><page sequence="23">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Memoir 30, VoL 42, No. 162 Figure 90.

Often they were buried in storage pits. Large flakes, spalls, and cores were frequently found in association with blanks. Similar groups of artifacts occurred in midden areas, suggesting that raw materials were in plentiful supply. Eight of the smaller circular to oval cores are battered on one or more sides. This may have resulted from a pounding activity, such as occa sional use as hammerstones. Chipped Stone Disks/Unknowns. One rather unusual chipped quartz object came from House 8 at 25FT17 (Fig. 82.14). The material may have originated in the Rocky Mountain region. The object was chipped to a near circle with a diameter between 34 and 36 mm. Rather coarse flakes were removed from both faces to make a biconvex shape. The object is 17 mm in maximum thickness near its center and 3 mm at its thinned edges. There is no evidence of use as a scraper or similar tool. It seems likely that the object served as a mounted ornament or had some other nonu tilitarian function Another unusual object?a thin, circular arti fact made of white chalcedony?came from the hearth of House 5 at 25FT13 (Fig. 82.15). One small section of the edge projects to form a slightly expanding stem 7 mm long and 10 mm wide. This object was likely used for personal adornment, with the projecting stem serving as the point of attachment. The slightly convex face shows little secondary flaking. The symmetrical edges are thinned with secondary chipping to 3 to 5 mm, while thickness near the center of the object reaches a maximum of 8 mm. Measured from the stem to the opposite edge, the longitudinal axis is 43 mm. Maximum width is 37 mm. A unique object was recovered from 25FT13. This artifact has one end that forms an SCb 1 point with a convex base and barbed shoulders (Fig. 82.13). The sides are convex, rounding to a narrow area where they again expand to a head-like form. The head-like area has a projection on one side suggestive of a bird beak. This object is made from dark red jasper, probably of a little better quality than the local material. The craftsmanship is good, with flake scars extending diagonally across the specimea Total length of the object is 46 mm. The maximum width near the midpoint is 23 mm. Maximum thickness of 6 mm is at the midline. Ground, Polished, and Cut Stone Abraders. Based on use and form, sandstone abraders are divided into four categories, Classes I through IV. There are 587 distinct abraders rep resented by numerous fragments and 27 complete specimens. Data on the abraders suggest little at tempt to secure the maximum use from a piece of stone. Many usable abraders were discarded. Ob viously, the raw material used to manufacture abraders was readily available, allowing for "wasteful" behavior. Class I. This is the most common type of abrader with 248 specimens (42%) varying con siderably in shape and size. As a group, they do not seem deliberately shaped, except from use. Some abraders are grooved, others ungrooved. The Class I abraders are either tabular, oval, or circular in form. They range in weight from two ounces to more than a pound. One or both faces show use. The edges are either smoothed, rounded, or very irregular. Specimens of this group were multipurpose, probably used in working stone, bone, and wood. A nonspecialized abrader group such as Class I can be documented in nearly every prehistoric complex in the Plains area. Class II. These abraders, represented by 86 specimens (15%) (Fig. 92.6-8), include various shapes and sizes, but most are roughly circular. The oval to rectangular abraders in this category show the most extensive use. Overall, the Class II abraders appear unworked, except for one or more grooves that could occur on any face and at various angles. Unlike the previous group, Class II abrad ers appear not to have been used as hand rubbing tools, but as awl or shaft polishers. Most of these abraders are fashioned from rough local sandstone fragments. They range up to a pound and a half in weight. Class III. These are the boat-shaped, shaft polisher abraders. There are 188 specimens (32%) (Fig. 92.1-5). Some appear to have been used in pairs, while others have a slightly convex face that may suggest they were used by themselves. Brownish Dakota sandstone was used more com monly for this type of abrader than for the other types and probably was selected because of its less friable nature. Most often, a single longitudinal groove extends diagonally or parallel to the edges of a flattened face. As far as we are aware, this type 117</page><page sequence="25">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Memoir 30, VoL 42, No. 162 Figure 92. Abraders: (1-5) Class III; (6-8) Class II. (1-3, 6-7) from 25FT17; (4, 8) from 25FT70; (5) from 25FT14. Photograph by A. E. Nixon, 1949 (neg. no. 189). of abrader has not been reported at Woodland or earlier sites in the area. Class IV. Oval to subrectangular abraders, relatively thin in proportion to their length and width, number 65 or 11% of the total. A typical specimen (25FT17-6912) is 75 mm long, 42 mm wide, and 19 mm in maximum thickness. This specimen is roughly oval with dressed and rounded edges. Three narrow but well-defined parallel grooves extend along each face. This type of groove probably served for working awls and similar bone objects. Grooved Stones. Three unusual artifacts (one from 25FT20 and two from 25FT39) are not read ily classifiable as to function, but may be placed in the grooved stone category (Fig. 93). All three are fashioned from very hard stone (i.e., quartz or quartzite) and have polished surfaces and shapes suggesting they originated as stream cobbles. The smallest of the three (25FT39-759) is made of quartz, roughly rectangular in outline, with a length of 105 mm, a maximum width near the center of 70 mm, and a thickness of 40 mm. One side of this stone is flat and the others are rounded. One end is battered and slightly blunted, as if from use as a hammerstone. On both ends a groove or notch measures 3 mm deep. These grooves begin on the flat face of the stone and cut diagonally into the edge without reaching the con vex side. They parallel the long axis of the piece, but are not quite aligned with each other. Six other notches, not as deep nor as wide as those on the ends, are present on each side of the object. A similar grooved object (#376) was recov ered from a house floor at 25FT20. This stone has a length of 138 mm, a width of 99 mm, and a thickness of 59 mm. Roughly rectangular, it is made from pinkish quartzite. One face appears to have a naturally concave contour, while the other face is somewhat convex. The edges are rounded and the entire surface shows a little grinding. Near the slightly convex face are four narrow parallel grooves. The two outer grooves are moderately deeper than the two inner grooves. One outside groove is 59 mm long, 6 mm wide, and 4 to 5 mm deep. The other outside groove is 77 mm long, 5 to 15 mm wide, and 8 mm deep. The two superfi cial inner grooves are 27 and 30 mm long, and less 118</page><page sequence="26">Kivett &amp; Metcalf Medicine Creek Reservoir Figure 93.

A third specimen (#811) from 25FT39 is roughly circular and has a deep, angular area worn at one end. Whether these three objects served as abraders or had a more specialized function cannot be detennined. This type of artifact has not been reported previously from this area.14 Ground Stone Celts. Ground stone celts are rare. Seven specimens appear to be represented, including three complete celts from two sites, and four celt fragments (Fig. 94). All are made of dark gray to greenish crystalline material, probably dio rite. The complete specimens range from sub rec tangular to oval. Polls are somewhat squared and slighdy battered. Edges are rounded and evidence of the pecking process remains above the polished bit. From bit to poll the sides converge on two of the intact celts; on the third the sides are nearly parallel. Pitting has been mostly removed from the bit area by subsequent polishing or use. A complete celt (#541) from 25FT17 House 1 (Fig. 94.2) is 100 mm long, 52 mm wide at the bit, and 33 mm thick. A second complete celt (#960) from 25FT70 Area 1 (Fig. 94.1) is 97 mm long, 25 mm wide at the poll, 62 mm wide at the bit, and has a maximum thickness near the center of 31 mm. None of the celts exhibits evidence of grooves for hafting. Ground stone celts are relatively rare in most variants of the Upper Republican aspect. Wedel (1934:199) reported one ground stone celt from Red Cloud 2 in the Republican Valley. Champe (1936:265) reported one from a site of the Sweet water focus in the Loup Valley. Cooper (1936:47) counted 17 celts from three components of the St. Helena focus in northeastern Nebraska. (Some question remains about the relationship of this latter variant to Upper Republican.) Ground stone celts occur in relatively large numbers in sites of the Nebraska Culture (Bell and Gilmore 1936:324), whereas celts made of chipped stone are relatively few. The occasional incidence of ground stone celts in Upper Republi can sites can perhaps be attributed to the influence of the Nebraska aspect; clearly, they were not commonly used by Upper Republican peoples. One factor that may have limited ground stone celt manufacture is the relative scarcity of suitable 119</page><page sequence="27">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Memoir 30, Vol 42, No. 162 Figure 94. Ground stone celts: (1) from 25FT70; (2-3, 5) from 25FT17; (4) from 25FT16. Photograph by A. E. Nixon, 1949 (neg. no. 146). stone in the area as compared with the abundance of jasper. Tools of similar function could be pro duced from jasper with less intensive labor. Hammerstones. Hammerstones are rela tively common at Medicine Creek Upper Repub lican sites, with 41 specimens recovered. Only two sites did not yield hammerstones. Most are stream cobbles unmodified except by use. One or both ends are pecked or battered, and occasionally all edges show evidence of pecking. Hammerstones are round to oval in shape, with diameters ranging between 30 and 100 mm (Fig. 95.4-6). A variety of raw materials available locally in stream beds are represented, including quartz, quartzite, gran ite, and various dioritic rocks. Chipped jasper cores may also have been used as hammerstones. Polished Stones. This type of artifact is cir cular in outline and biconvex in cross section (Fig. 95.1-3). Of the six polished stones recovered, three came from 25FT17. One of the finer specimens was from House 1, 25FT17, and measured 56 by 60 mm across with a maximum thickness of 32 mm. The material is a hard, black stone, probably a stream pebble. The edges and one face are smoothed and rounded, while the other faces ex hibit lustrous polish. Other polished stones are larger, with a sheen on one or both faces. An attempt at shaping a more circular form is suggested by the pecked edges of several specimens. These artifacts possibly served to smooth and polish pottery. Impressions on the interior surface of several pottery vessels suggest the use of such an implement. They may also have served as grinding implements; however, the non abrasive type of stone suggests a smoothing rather than grinding functioa Grinding Slabs. Three relatively complete grinding slabs and miscellaneous fragments repre senting 23 other slabs (Fig. 95.7-8 and Fig. 96) came from nine sites. These items are made of locally occurring raw materials, including several varieties of sandstone and one example of mica schist. A complete grinding slab from 25FT16 has a shallow oval trough on one side. The edges are rounded from use. Dimensions are approximately 180 by 360 mm. The slab is ovoid in outline and roughly concave-convex along both axes. It ranges 120</page><page sequence="28">Kivett &amp; Metcalf Medicine Creek Reservoir ^^^^^^^^^Hh^s^i^^ - * j^^^^^^^^^^^^^I^^^^^^ x ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^H Figure 95. Various ground stone artifacts: (1-3) stone balls; (4-6) hammerstones; (7) fragment of a grinding slab; (8) grinding stone. Photograph by A. E. Nixon, 1949 (neg. no. 166). between 12 and 28 mm in thickness along the edges. The trough is 230 mm long, about 125 mm wide, and about 15 mm deep. The bottom of the trough is relatively well polished considering the nature of the raw material. A roughly triangular fragment of another grinding slab also came from 25FT16 (Fig. 96.2), this one made from hard, fine-grained pinkish sandstone. Part of the rim is present on this speci mea It measures 155 mm and 115 mm at its two maximum dimensions. The rim is about 27 mm thick, and the trough of the slab is 10 mm thick. The slab was dressed to shape and the edges modi fied by pecking and polishing. The polished bot tom is flat to a point 30 mm from the outer edge, where it slopes upward slightly. The upper con cave surface is highly polished. Near the northwest center-post of House 1 at 25FT39 were two slabs of fine-grained local sand stone. The larger broken section, roughly rectan gular, shows considerable use. Measuring 250 mm long by 200 mm wide, one side has a deeply striated trough worn to a depth of 35 mm at one end. The trough width is 150 mm with the deepest point at the shattered edge. The edges of the slab are straight and show little evidence of shaping. Slab thickness ranges from 50 mm at the deepest portion of the trough to 70 mm at the edges. On the opposite face are fine grooves. Two of them are particularly deep and extend diagonally across the slab for 200 and 240 mm, respectively. The deepest one is 11 mm deep and 12 to 16 mm wide. This side of the slab probably was used for work ing wood or bone objects. Grange (1980:66) reported similar grinding slabs from excavations in the Red Willow Reser voir west of Medicine Creek. Calabrese (1969:37 38) also described specimens he termed milling stones from 25FT35, located just south of site 25FT17 on the west dam axis. Grinding slabs have been reported from the Lower Solomon focus of the Upper Republican aspect (Wedel 1934:229). They are reported less frequently from sites iden tified with this aspect in Nebraska. Hand Grinders. Hand grinders (i.e., manos) are not particularly common at Medicine Creek Upper Republican sites. Sixteen were recovered from six sites. Site 25FT13, which was rather 121</page><page sequence="29">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Memoir 30, Vol 42, No. 162 Figure 96. Grinding slabs: (top) from 25FT39; (lower left) from 25FT16; (lower right) from 25FT70. thoroughly excavated, yielded no complete speci mens. Seven came from 25FT17. Grinder frag ments, however, occurred at both sites. The hand grinders range in outline from circular to oval and were intended for one-handed use (Fig. 97). All specimens but one (from 25FT17) show use on only one face. Most of the grinders are fashioned from stream pebbles of granite, quartz, or sandstone. A ridge extending the length of the worked face of one hand grinder from 25FT17 separates the piece into two sloping portions of approximately equal size. The working faces on the other grinders are generally flat. The edges are usually dressed by pecking and smoothing. Some pecking, evidently to roughen the surface, is visible on the working surface of some specimens. The upper surfaces are slightly convex and have a slight polish One of the larger hand grinders (25FT17 4432) weighs slightly less than two pounds. It is oval in shape with a length of 124 mm, a width of 92 mm, and a thickness of 45 mm. A nearly circular specimen from the same site is 78 mm long, 70 mm wide, and 45 mm thick (Fig. 97.1). Pipes. Fifty-six pipes are represented in the Upper Republican collection (see Appendix in and Figs. 98-101). All pipes were manufactured from local stone except one pottery pipe fragment from 25FT20. Both complete specimens and frag ments representing only the bowl or stem were found. Fragments representing the same pipe are counted as one specimea Workmanship ranges from very crude on some pebble pipes to excellent on some more finely carved and incised pipes. The soft, local Niobrara chalk is particularly well adapted for pipe manufacture. The more crudely made pipes generally are local friable sandstone that was probably difficult to shape. Common to all pipes is a biconical bore at nearly a right angle. Based on shape, 23 pipes (including the ceramic specimen) are divided into three categories: Classes I through III. Class I. These pebble type pipes include only five specimens from four sites (Fig. 98.1-3). They were made from rough, unshaped sandstone and required careful inspection to determine their use. They are roughly circular to oval in shape with the bore of the bowl parallel to the long axis. The bore 122</page><page sequence="30">Kivett &amp; Metcalf Medicine Creek Reservoir Figure 97. Manos (hand grinders): (1,3) from 25FT17; (2) from 25FT39; (4) from 25FT70. Photograph by A. E. Nixon, 1949 (neg. no. 144). for the stem intersects the bowl at nearly a right angle at any point on the bottom half of the speci mea The lips are somewhat smoothed and flat tened, but the sides show little dressing. Two Class I bowl bores are well burned, suggesting intensive use. One of these (from 25FT22), made from a coarse local sandstone, had an exterior unshaped except for some smoothing caused by use (Fig. 100). The stem opening was a conical hole drilled at a slightly obtuse angle. The bowl bore, unlike most Class I pipes, is at a right angle to the long axis of the piece. This pipe is 49 mm high and 76 mm wide. The stem bore measures 11 mm across at the widest point. The bowl bore tapers to a junction with the stem and is 10 mm long with a maximum diameter of 16 mm (Fig. 101). Class II. Eight specimens manufactured pri marily from chalk represent Class II pipes (Fig. 99.1-3). They are biconically drilled so that the bowl and the stem meet approximately at right angles to each other. These pipes are L-shaped with the stem usually slightly lower than the bowl. The sides are smoothed and rounded and the stem is slightly flattened on the lower side. The lip of the bowl is either narrow and rounded or slightly flattened. Two Class II pipes are decorated with incised geometric lines. One of these decorated pipes (25FT22-614) is unusually well made of fine-tex tured gray chalk and very delicately incised (Fig 99.3). It is 48 mm high and the stem is 36 mm long. The bowl is oval in cross section, 27 mm across lengthwise and 23 mm wide. The bowl bore has a maximum diameter of 16 mm at the lip and tapers to the junction with the stem. The stem bore has a maximum diameter of 6 mm at the outer edge. This pipe was found shattered but was restored. The flattened lip, the front of the bowl, and the bottom of the bowl are very delicately incised, probably by a toothed object producing shallow parallel lines. Two deeply incised parallel lines extend from the lower side of the stem up the front of the bowl to the outer edge of the lip. A third line roughly divides the angle of the bowl and stem and continues diagonally up one side and across the back of the bowl, where it divides the bowl-stem angle on the other side and terminates at one of the deep parallel lines. 123</page><page sequence="31">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Memoir 30, VoL 42, No. 162 Class II contains the only ceramic pipe (from 25FT20), an L-shaped and undecorated specimen (Fig. 99.4). The lip is flattened and the bowl slightly constricted at its junction with the stem. It is 56 mm high. The stem is broken off near the back of the bowl. The bowl bore tapers from a diameter of 15 mm at the lip to a diameter of 10 mm at the junction with the stem. The black to buff clay is tempered with fine white sand and the surface is smoothed and slightly polished. Class HI. Nine chalk specimens from eight sites represent the Class in pipes. Five of these are decorated with incising or carving on the bowl or stem. This type of pipe is similar to the Class n form with stems at right angles to the bowls and biconical bores, but the stems project beyond the bowls to form a prow that is usually narrowed at its junction with the stem. One Class III pipe (25FT13-2158), made from local buff-colored chalk, has its stem broken off and reshaped nearly flush with the back of the bowl (Fig. 99.11). The lip is flattened and slopes slighdy downward to the outer edge. Incised on either side of the bowl are hawk-like birds with hooked beaks. The heads of these figures follow the tapering stem projection and the tails extend diagonally up the bowl. Incised lines, apparently the tail of a third bird, occur on the back of the bowl just below the lip, between the two side figures. The remainder of this third bird figure was lost in a previous break. The specimen is slightly pol ished on the surface, and the bowl bore is reddened from heat. The pipe is 60 mm high, and the re worked stem is 42 mm long. The outer diameter of the bowl narrows from 37 mm at the lip to 27 mm at its junction with the stem. The stem ranges in width between 28 mm at the reworked end and 3 mm at the narrow, rounded, projecting tip. The bowl bore narrows from its maximum diameter of 15 mm at the lip to approximately 5 mm at its junction with the stem. A second elaborately decorated Class IH pipe (25FT70-3452, 3453) (Fig. 99.9,10) is a reworked chalk specimen. Its original form is thought to have been the projecting stem and flaring bowl type. The projecting stem portion was carved into a form representing a bison head. The end and one side of the stem are shattered, but the other side has the features of a bison head carved in relief. One obvious horn curves up above the ear to what was originally the bowl. A horn and ear are dis cernible at a slightly lower point on the opposite side of the pipe. On the lower side of the original stem, two parallel lines marking the bison's jowls extend to the rear. The space between these lines, to the rear of the jowls, is set off in unequal segments with 12 parallel incised lines. A cone shaped bowl from the same house at 25FT70 is believed to have been originally a part of this pipe. This bowl would have been in the general area of the bison's hump. After removal of the bowl (probably by breakage), the stem appears to have been enlarged for use as a bowl. The remnant of the old bowl at the original junction with the stem was worked down and used as the new stem. A small portion of a chalk Class ILT pipe (#724) (Fig. 99.12) came from a storage pit asso ciated with two human skull fragments in House 1 at 25FT39. This fragment is well blackened and reddened from heat. The fragment probably came from the front of the bowl. It has carved and incised marks representing an animal face, per haps feline. The deeply incised eyes are slightly oval and aligned slightly diagonally. Beginning above and between the eyes are two incised lines that converge but do not meet, apparently symbol izing the nose. The mouth is represented by a deeply incised line crossing the base of the bowl and extending a short distance up the sides. Class IV. No Class IV pipes were recovered in our excavations at Medicine Creek, but a single specimen from 25FT14 in the collection of Herbert Allen deserves mention here. This pipe of local chalk is roughly oval in shape, approximating a turtle carapace. Exact measurements are not avail able, but maximum length is estimated at 150 to 200 mm. The lower surface is nearly flat, while the upper surface is rounded with two openings. One opening, for the bowl, is at the head and the open ing at the opposite end, for the stem, is near the tail. The upper surface is incised, apparendy to represent the carapace segments. Some poorly de fined incised lines are present on the underside. Though it is unlike any pipes in our collection, this specimen may be attributed to the Upper Republi can aspect. It is interesting that four pipes from four different sites each represent a different ani mal. 124</page><page sequence="32">Kivett &amp; Metcalf Medicine Creek Reservoir ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^B^^p^^^^^^^j^B Figure 98.

Artifacts circular to oval in shape and made of chalk, limestone, or sandstone were classified as stone balls (Fig. 95 .1-3 and Fig. 102). Nineteen specimens came from six Upper Repub lican sites at Medicine Creek. Considerable vari ation is observed in the shape of these objects. They possibly represent more than one artifact type. Two balls of very soft white chalk from 25FT39 range in diameter between 65 and 70 mm. They are well rounded and reasonably symmetri cal with no striations. The soft nature of the chalk makes it unlikely that these items were meant for rough use. Perhaps they were collected and stored in this form to be used later for pigment. Nine stone balls from 25FT13 include four of limestone, three of chalk, and two of sandstone, ranging in diameter between 35 and 92 mm. The two sandstone specimens show grinding on the sides, which produced the rounded shape. One limestone ball has a shallow encircling groove. This specimen may represent a pipe blank in its earlier stages of manufacture. One unusually shaped stone ball, made of consolidated chalk, came from a storage pit at 25FT70 Area 2 (Fig. 95.1). This specimen is semi circular in form. One-half of the object has two straight, nearly parallel sides with the opposing ends flattened and convex. Its surfaces are smooth and polished, showing no evidence of rough use. The ball's function remains unknown. It measures 71 mm long and 61 mm wide. One weathered stone ball from 25FT36 (Fig. 102.1) is roughly egg shaped, measuring 54 by 46 mm, and made of local gray chalk. On one face are three incised lines forming what might be a turkey track. On the opposite face, an incised arc with a chord joins two ends. Near the midpoint, two parallel incised lines intersect the arc at right an gles to the chord. Anthropomorphic Figurines. Three carved chalk anthropomorphic figurines are likenesses of the human head. Such effigies are relatively rare at Upper Republican sites. The finest specimen came from 25FT13. Made of very fine white chalk, the specimen is symmetrically oval with one sur face flat and the other convex. On the convex surface, human features are carved and incised. 127</page><page sequence="35">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Memoir 30, Vol 42, No. 162 Figure 103. Anthropomorphic figurine from 25FT22.

Nixon, 1948. Viewing the face in an upright position, the speci men is 52 mm high, measured from below the chin to the top of the head. The greatest breadth occurs in line with the eyes at 46 mm. Maximum thick ness (front to back), at the slightly projecting fore head, is 20 mm. The hair, shown by fine incised striations at various angles, extends well below the forehead. The nose, carved in relief, flares above the nostrils and constricts at the bridge to merge with the forehead. The eyes are carved in relief into oval sockets. Extending from the outer corner of each eye is a single incised horizontal line. Shal low striae continue vertically downward from the hairline on either side of the face to form points even with the mouth. The mouth is a shallow, elongated cavity measuring 3 by 10 mm, centered below the nose. The lower portion of the face, below the mouth, is well rounded with no definite indication of a chin. The back of the head is flattened and smoothed with no evidence of perfo rations for attachments. It seems likely, based on the one flattened surface, that this object had been set into wood or some other material. Collected by RBS, this specimen is curated at the Smithsonian Institution. A second stone head sculpted from buff-col ored chalk was collected by NSHS at 25FT22 (Fig. 103). Unlike the first figurine, the entire human head rather than just the face is portrayed. The frontal view reveals a moderately oval shape, while a superior view (looking down on the top of the head) reveals the back of the head to be some what flattened and the forehead narrowing toward the nose. Well-centered on the top of the head is a small circular protuberance suggestive of a top knot. A small oval perforation is near the center of the protuberance. Some material for attachment may have been fastened into it. Striae above the forehead suggest hair. The incised eyes are roughly diamond shaped, but the pupils are not shown. As with the specimen from 25FT13, this head has an incised horizontal line extending from the outer corner of each eye into the hairline on either side of the face. The mouth is a shallow oval depression centered below the nose. The lower left portion of the face and the occipital area at the base of the head are broken off and were not found. The area remaining below the mouth is rounded with no definite indication of the chia This specimen is 35 mm from the lowest point below the mouth to the top of the protuberance on the head. The greatest width occurs just below the eyes, at 36 mm. A third carving, perhaps of a human head, came from a storage pit at 25FT17. This specimen is very crude and bears little resemblance to the two described above. Made of gray chalk, it is roughly cylindrical in shape, 34 mm across at the top, where it is smoothed and rounded, and 40 mm at the bottom. The bottom end exhibits a smooth but somewhat uneven break. On one side are two shallow oval depressions, 5 to 7 mm below the smoothed top, interpreted as eyes. A gently rounded ridge 10 mm wide and 24 mm long cen 128</page><page sequence="36">Kivett &amp; Metcalf Medicine Creek Reservoir tered vertically between the eyes represents the nose and forehead. Just below the lower end of this ridge is a shallow rectangular depression inter preted as the mouth. The upper half of the mouth depression is divided by four shallow vertical lines into uneven segments, perhaps representing teeth. On the opposite side of the object near the mid point are two incised lines that converge toward the top. They enclose a space, ranging between 3 and 5 mm in width, that is divided into two sec tions. A shallow oval depression on the left side is vaguely suggestive of an eye; however, no evi dence of an eye on the right side can be found to form a pair. Whether this specimen represents a child's toy, perhaps a doll's head, or had another purpose cannot be determined. Clearly, it does not exhibit careful workmanship and is not compara ble to the skillfully made specimens. Human effigy figurines are rare in Upper Re publican sites, but more frequent in Nebraska Cul ture sites, where they often are made from clay rather than carved from stone. Strong (1935:257 258) referred to 14 ceramic human effigy heads from Nebraska Culture sites. The bulk of these human figures are on ceramic pipes. Rarely, hu man effigies appear on vessels. One example illus trated by Strong (1935) documents a human head fashioned from "pink soapstone." Effigies do occur at sites assignable to the Upper Republican complex. Grange (1980:91) de scribed a bear or owl effigy head fashioned on a strap handle from 25FT54 in the Red Willow Reservoir west of Medicine Creek. The same site also yielded vessel lugs and other handles that are suggestive of Nebraska Culture influence. One human "face pipe" fashioned from stone was re covered from the Shipman site (25WT7) (Willey 1966). Kivett and Jensen (1976:54) reported a full human head effigy from the Wolf Creek occupa tion at the Crow Creek site (39BF11). This speci men is carved from catlinite and is somewhat cruder than the Medicine Creek examples. The Wolf Creek component does not appear to have a direct cultural relationship to other occupations at the site and may date more than a century later. Stone Pendants. Only three specimens from the Upper Republican sites at Medicine Creek are classified as stone pendants (Fig. 82.16-18). Two are made from amazonite, and one from a black indurated shale that probably originated as a stream pebble. One of the amazonite specimens (#3852) was found beneath the right mastoid of Burial 1 (Feature 40) at 25FT13 (Fig. 82.17). It is roughly rectangular and bright green in color. The four faceted sides are smooth and flattened, while the ends are uneven. A biconical perforation is centered 3 mm from the narrower end (6 mm wide). The perforation constricts from 2 mm to 1 mm. Width at the opposite end is 8 mm. Thickness of this pendant ranges between 2 and 3 mm. The second amazonite pendant (#9779) was recovered from a trash-filled pit at 25FT17 (Fig. 82 .18). It is a slightly darker shade of green, some what jug-shaped, with smoothed and rounded edges. The pendant is 12 mm long. Its body ranges in width between 7 and 8 mm and in thickness from 4 mm below the neck to 3 mm at the lower tip. A narrow, slightly expanding stem centered at the top is evidently for attachment purposes. This stem is 2 mm high, 3 mm wide, and 2 mm thick, narrowing slightly where it joins with the body. The black shale pendant (#2120) also came from 25FT17. It is ovoid in shape with the edges tapering slightly toward the upper perforated end (Fig. 82.16). The edges are ground into a rounded form and both surfaces are smooth with visible striae. A biconical perforation 7 mm from the narrowed end measures 6 mm across on the exte rior surfaces and constricts to 3 mm where the two bores meet. Roper (1988:531-534) reported a turquoise pendant from House 4 at 25FT22. This pendant has a single 1.9 mm diameter perforation. The color and form of this pendant are similar to the one from Burial 1 (Feature 40) at 25FT13. It also is similar in color to the 25FT17 pendant. The raw material of the 25FT13 and 25FT17 pendants was identified by E. C. Reed (Director of the Nebraska Geological Survey) in 1948 as amazonite (or mi crocline), the nearest source of which would be the Rocky Mountains. Amazonite (or microcline) re sembles turquoise in color and hardness. The Roper specimen as well as the two pendants exca vated in the 1940s should be reexamined for a final determination of raw material. Perhaps amazonite occurs naturally in the Republican River gravel.15 129</page><page sequence="37">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Memoir 30, Vol 42, No. 162 Figure 104.

Miscellaneous Cut, Incised, and Drilled Stone Various cut, incised, or drilled stones oc curred at five of the Medicine Creek Upper Repub lican sites (Figs. 102 and 104), mostly made of local chalk or shale. Many of the items apparently are rejects of pipes and other artifacts made from similar material. Some specimens, however, rep resent complete artifacts, although their purpose is unknown. Circular Stone with Triangular Segments. One object of unknown function came from a posthole in House 6 (Feature 50) at 25FT13 (Fig. 102.3). It is shaped from local gray chalk into a rough circle with one flattened and one convex surface, and was smoothed on all surfaces prior to being incised. The convex surface is divided into 25 triangular segments by incised lines radiating outward from near the center. The lines terminate near the rounded exterior edges. The triangular segments range in width near the edge from 11 to 16 mm. The stone is 102 to 107 mm in diameter, with a thickness ranging from 41 mm near the center to 12 mm at the rounded edge. The purpose of this object is unknown. It was possibly intended to be drilled for a pipe. In the same structure (House 6 at 25FT13) were a cut human skull and a bison skull impregnated with red pigment. Bead. Half of a chalk or limestone bead was recovered from 25FT17. It appears to have been split lengthwise through the center. The edges and unbroken surface are well smoothed and rounded. The junction of the biconical bore is near the midpoint. Bore diameter constricts from 5 mm at the exterior to 2 mm at the junction. The outside diameter of the 10 mm long bead is 13 mm. Blanks. Particularly common at the Upper Republican sites are pieces of chalk, up to 143 mm long, smoothed and often grooved on one or more surfaces. These items apparently represent blanks or unused raw material. Paint Materials Chalk and hematite are thought to have been used prehistorically as pigment for paint. These materials occur at all but one of the Medicine Creek Upper Republican sites, though not in large quantities. Chalk objects thought to be associated with painting have one or more flat surfaces show 130</page><page sequence="38">Kivett &amp; Metcalf Medicine Creek Reservoir ing fine striae from grinding. These items come in various shapes and sizes. Several are deeply grooved. Breakage is common along the deep grooves. Various colors of chalk were used for painting, mostly white to gray. Chalk items that apparently had burned produced buff to red colors. Several chalk balls described above may represent pigment sources, although they show no evidence of such use. Chalk and hematite fragments were particulaiiy common at 25FT70 Area 2. Hematite occurs in varying amounts at 10 of the 12 sites, but most commonly at 25FT13 with 10 examples. The specimens are unshaped except by use, which is manifested by grinding on all surfaces to remove pigment. It seems likely that the hematite came from the Dakota Formatioa Crystals Two quartz crystals occurred at two sites. The facets on these crystals are nearly obliterated, either by grinding or by stream action. The crystal from 25FT20 is 42 mm long and the one from 25FT70 is 37 mm long. Small unworked frag ments of calcite crystals occurred at three of the sites. Such crystals also have been found in the Lime Creek drainage. The function of these crys tals is unknown, although ornamental or some other nonutilitarian purpose is likely. BONE AND TOOTH ARTIFACTS The 12 Upper Republican sites investigated in the Medicine Creek Reservoir yielded 1493 worked bones and teeth Amounts varied from site to site, as well as among comparable features within sites. Some of this variation is due to the differing extent of excavation at the sites. 25FT17, containing nine houses, three middens, and several smaller features, had the greatest number of speci mens at 454, while 25FT14, with only one house and three small features, produced eight such arti facts. Length of site occupation also undoubtedly influenced the amounts recovered. To get an idea of the representation of species in the bone artifact assemblages, 50 specimens (not including bison scapula digging tools) were identified with the following results: antelope (18), bison (8), deer (6), elk (4), dog (1), and unidentifiable (13). Bone artifacts were worked by various meth ods. Ends of long bones usually were removed by incising a groove around the shaft, then applying pressure to cause a break at the groove. Flat plates or slips of bone were obtained from scapulae by battering, or more commonly by making a deep grooved outline with a sharp pointed object, and breaking the excess material away. Metapodials and ribs were divided lengthwise by deep scoring and then wedging them apart. There is little evi dence of how bone was whittled into shape, but it appears that grinding was employed to remove rough ends and to form points and edges. Shaping by battering was largely confined to the manufac ture of scapula digging tools. Bone artifacts were divided into 22 catego ries. This is a significandy larger number than found at Woodland components of Medicine Creek sites. (There were only six classes of Wood land bone artifacts: beads, awls, cut phalanges, drilled phalanges, scapula tools, and notched tools.) Scapula Tools The bison scapula was an important raw ma terial for Upper Republican peoples Scapulae were modified into two primary tools: hoes and knives, the latter subdivided into blades and cleav ers. A variety of other items also were made from scapula sections. At least 229 scapula hoes and an additional 529 unassignable fragments of bison scapulae were present. Hoes. Whole or fragmentary bison scapula hoes came from each of the Upper Republican sites. Scapulae were initially battered to removed the acromion and postscapular process (Fig. 105.1). Except near the cutting edge, little effort was made to smooth the rough edges left after removal of these portions. The suprascapular bor der generally was removed by cutting, leaving a slighdy convex edge. Through use this edge be came straight or markedly concave. Fifty-six ver tebral margins cut off and discarded in the manufacture of scapula hoes were found. These discarded pieces range from 40 to 50 mm in width. The hoe edge was formed by a single bevel, invariably on the dorsal side. A high polish result ing from use is present on the working edge of nearly all specimens. The proximal articulation of the scapula was rarely removed during hoe manu facture. A groove up to 33 mm wide generally 131</page><page sequence="39">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Memoir 30, VoL 42, No. 162 appears on the edge of this articulation. Usually, this groove is shallow, but at times exceeds 4 mm in depth. Often, this groove is polished. It is sug gested that scapula blades were hafted for use as hoes, with the handle attached at right angles to the long axis of the bone. Opposed notches, often present on both borders of the blade near the sharpened end, probably seated the thongs that bound the blade and handle together. Of the 229 hoes, 121 specimens are sufficiently complete to determine the presence or absence of these notches. Eight hoes have none, 61 hoes have one notch per side, and the remaining 52 hoes have two notches per side. Occasionally, three notches are present on one side. Specimens with one notch per side commonly are the least worn. Perhaps, as the implements became worn, it was necessary to make new notches nearer the proximal end, thus accounting for multiple notches on the worn blades. A hoe from House 7 at 25FT70 Area 2 has a ragged surface where the neck of the articular end was broken (Fig. 106.2). About 65 mm below the break are two notches, one on each side of the neck. These appear to have been produced by battering and polished by use. The concavities are 40 to 50 mm wide and roughly 5 mm deep. The single pair of relatively narrow notches is 90 to 100 mm above the edge. A hoe from 25FT28 was made from the scap ula of an immature bison, judging by the incom plete epiphyseal fusion. The proximal end has a groove 35 mm wide and 12 mm deep to seat the haft. Specimens with cracks extending down from the bit a short distance into the blade are common. Small holes were often drilled on each side of the crack, presumably for lacing. Cracks were occa sionally checked by making one or more diagonal cuts from the inner end of the crack to the edge of the tool and removing a section of bone, leaving a notched edge. Worn scapula hoes typically meas ure 240 mm long and 125 mm wide. Little used hoes are often twice this size. Broken hoes apparently were used as raw material for other tools. Undoubtedly, many frag ments served as scrapers without further modifi cation. A specimen from House 8 at 25FT70 shows how a hoe occasionally was destroyed to obtain raw material. The center of the blade of this specimen is deeply scored longitudinally in two places (12 to 18 mm apart). The thin slip of bone between the cuts was removed without cross-scor ing, leaving a gap 160 mm long (Fig. 106.3). Knives. Many of the 116 bison scapula knives initially served as digging tools. Such knives came from all of the Upper Republican sites except 25FT14. Knives are subdivided into blades and cleavers, based on form. Blades. Forty specimens, roughly circular to subrectangular in outline, are classified as blades. Well made, highly polished, often ivory-like in appearance, these blades are 135 to 149 mm long and from 70 to 103 mm wide. They generally have one thicker side where the border or the spinous process was removed and its remnant ground smooth. Cutting edges were formed on the former central portion of the scapula (Fig. 107.1,4). Oc casionally, a blade is made entirely from the thin central area of the scapula and lacks the thickened edge. The central portion of a scapula from House 7 at 25FT17 resembles a blade in size and shape and may represent an early step in blade manufac ture. Small pieces had been broken away, without being previously grooved (Fig. 107.2). Cleavers. Cleavers typically were produced by splitting a scapula hoe lengthwise and remov ing the thin bone bordering the margin at the proximal end. The projecting border remnant forms the handle. The remaining thin portion, well polished and sharpened, forms the blade. Seventy six cleavers were recovered (Fig. 108.3-5). Meas urements range between 189 and 310 mm long and between 60 and 80 mm wide. Bone cleavers would have functioned very well for cutting soft materials. Ours are much the same as those reported by Strong (1940:370) from a contact period site in South Dakota. Wedel (1943:80) also reported these tools at the Steed Kisker site near Kansas City, Missouri and Cooper (1936:53) described similar specimens from the St. Helena focus as well as from a Nebraska aspect site in Douglas County (Hill and Cooper 1936:264). Cleaver-like tools also occur in proto historic sites in the Lower Loup area (Dunlevy 1936:198) and Dismal River aspects (Hill and Metcalf 1941:196). Other Scapula Tools.

Nixon, 1949 (neg. no. 156). 25FT16 was fashioned into a tool that departs from the usual knife form. The suprascapular border was removed by breaking. After being deeply scored, the scapula was broken lengthwise to al low removal of the spine but leaving the articular end intact. The cutting edge was then sharpened (Fig. 107.3). A scapula fragment from House 1 at 25FT16 has a slightly curved slot 55 mm long and 30 to 37 mm wide cut diagonally into the blade at one end. The object resembles a knife blade and the slot may have served as a handle after the original grip broke off (Fig. 107.5). Of unknown use are six fragmentary scapula objects. One from House 4 at 25FT17 is lanceolate in outline, 180 mm long and 48 mm wide. Cut from the border of a scapula hoe, one side retains a shallow notch typical of hoes. One face has numer ous striae parallel to the long axis and a slight polish 20 mm above the blunt point (Fig. 108.2). A paddle-shaped scapula object from an inte rior storage pit (Feature 84) of House 5 at 25FT17 has the articular surface and both side margins of the scapula removed. The edges are smoothed and polished, but not sharpened. The object is 120 mm long, with a maximum width of 38 mm, narrowing to 22 mm at the opposite end. The ragged scar where the spine was removed is ground smooth and is nearly flush with the rest of the surface. Both ends are convex (Fig. 108.6). A slip of bone cut from the center of a scapula also came from House 5 at 25FT17. The sides of this specimen are parallel for most of its 133 mm length, contracting at one end. Greatest width is 135 mm. The edges are round and dull. The entire surface exhibits a high polish. Ulna Picks Six bison ulnae broken at the distal end are classified as picks, although their actual use is not certaia A slight polish is routinely present at the unsharpened distal end, while the proximal end sometimes shows battering.

The polish extends along both sides to a point midway around the shaft and may 134</page><page sequence="42">Kivett &amp; Metcalf Medicine Creek Reservoir Figure 108.

Shaft Wrenches Arrowshaft wrenches are not abundant at Medicine Creek. Only 20 wrenches were found at seven Upper Republican sites. These tools range greatly in length, between 120 and 300 mm. Six came from 25FT16, four of these from a single house. Half the wrenches were made from sections of elk or bison ribs (e.g., Fig. 109.6), and half from metapodials. Three of the metapodials are either deer or antelope (Fig. 109.4-5). None of the wrenches is antler, although Wedel (1934:202) reported two antler wrenches from a site only a few miles upstream. The Medicine Creek shaft wrenches generally have a single perforation near one end. The perfo rations are elliptical in outline and range between 12 and 21 mm wide. The long axis is parallel to that of the tool, except in one wrench where it is diagonal. All wrenches are beveled toward the center of the perforation. The bevel is greatest at the poles of the long and short axes. The objects are well polished, although one or both ends are raggedly broken off. One wrench made from a rib has smoothly rounded ends and trimmed, smoothed sides below the perforation. Incised decorations are present on three wrenches. One wrench made from a rib displays 13 shallow transverse grooves across one edge. Another wrench (from House 2 at 25FT28), also made from a rib, has 20 shallow incisions along one edge above the perforation, and the opposite edge ground with cancellous material exposed along 70 mm of its 300 mm length (Fig. 109.6). One face of this rib is crossed by a shallow cut 45 mm above the perforation. An incomplete shaft wrench from 25FT16 measuring 140 mm long was made from the metatarsus of an immature bison (Fig. 109.1). The joint was removed and nearly all of the perforation is broken away. Three transverse incised lines, 25 mm long, begin 15 mm below the perforation. Some 11 mm below these lines are 14 slighUy shorter lines, and next to these, running diagonally downward to encircle three-quarters of the tool, is a pair of incised lines 2 to 3 mm apart. 135</page><page sequence="43">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Memoir 30, Vol 42, No. 162 Figure 109.

Beads Bone beads recovered at 10 Medicine Creek Upper Republican sites apparently are made from the leg or wing bones of birds and from the meta podials of dog and wolf or immature deer and antelope. There are 103 relatively complete tubu lar beads, ranging from 3 to 122 mm long; 48 of them measure less than 25 mm long (Fig. 110). The beads are highly polished. All stages of manu facture are represented, including specimens grooved in preparation to break the bone, those with one end removed, and the cut-off ends, dis carded joints, and other scrap material. The longest bead (122 mm long, 11 mm in diameter) came from 25FT16. Made from a bird leg bone, it has one well-finished end and the other end broken (Fig. 110.1). A second bead from 25FT16, 52 mm long and 15 mm in diameter, is encircled by four narrow, deep incisions. It is highly polished and carefully made (Fig. 110.17). Two barrel-shaped beads of a type not found at any of the other Upper Republican sites came from a midden (Feature 14) at 25FT17 (Fig. 110.5). These beads are 11 to 12 mm long. Like the more common form, these beads are made from the bones of small mammals or birds. The ends are thinned by scraping or grinding. These two beads possibly belong to one of the earlier Woodland complexes present at the site. Awls Awls are the most common bone artifact re covered from the Medicine Creek Reservoir sites. There are 237 bone awls and only three antler awls. Most awls are made from the metapodials of ante lope, less frequently of deer. Bird bones, ribs, or ulnae were rarely used. Two dog ulna awls came from an interior pit (Feature 80) at 25FT17 and from 25FT70. Bone awls were made by removing the distal or occasionally the proximal ends from the meta podials. The shaft was then grooved and split, and the halves split agaia The tool was brought to its final shape and scraped and/or ground to a sharp point (Fig. 111.6-9). Generally, the remains of the joint were retained to form the butt of the tool. Further modification of the butt occurred after the 136</page><page sequence="44">Kivett &amp; Metcalf Medicine Creek Reservoir Figure 110.

Occasionally, the condition of a specimen sug gests that the butt was broken off after manufac ture. In these cases, the pointed fragment seems to have continued in service, the broken end receiv ing only sufficient grinding to blunt the sharp edges. Following Kidder's classification, as modi fied by Wedel (1943:46), the bone awls are di vided into six categories: head intact (Fig. 111.12); head unworked except for the original split (Fig. 111.10); head partly worked (Fig. 111.11); head entirely, or almost entirely, removed (Fig. 111.4); splinters (Fig. 111.14); and fragments. A flat awl from a large midden (Feature 45) at 25FT17 has a worn broken edge at the butt, suggesting it was used after being brokea One side is sharp, as if the object had been cut from a hoe or bone knife; the other side shows traces of the cutting. This highly polished awl is well shaped, measuring 70 mm long and 10 mm wide. The splinter awls generally are made from rib sections or from irregularly shaped fragments of the central portion of a scapula (Fig. 110.19). One splinter awl from 25FT13 may be from a fragment of a scapula spine (Fig. 110.18). Another one from House 2 at 25FT16 is made from a slender splinter of bird bone and measures 75 mm long with a maximum diameter of 6.5 mm. A metapodial awl recovered from 25FT28 has a deep notch cut into the butt across the remnant of the articular surface. A similar awl from Midden 1 at 25FT22 has two incised parallel lines that extend from the base and spiral to a point 30 mm below their origin. Two antler awls came from 25FT70 Area 2, andonefrom25FT17(Fig. 111.13). All three are similar. They have a thin flat slip with a slightly rounded base and tapering sides, with the greatest width a short distance below the base.

Fishhooks Eight fishhooks came from five Upper Re publican sites, four from 25FT17 and one each from four other sites. Two other objects are be lieved to be fishhook blanks. The hooks are round in cross section and all have sharp points without barbs. The shank characteristically terminates in a slight knob (Fig. 110.7) or is encircled by a shal low groove some 2 mm below the end (Fig. 110.8). Hooks range in length between 21 and 39 mm. The shorter arm usually measures between 8 and 12 mm, and the point and the shank are between 6.5 and 10 mm apart. One hook from House 1 at 25FT17 has a perforation, not over 1 mm across, instead of a knob or groove (Fig. 110.10). This eye appears too small to carry an efficient line. Possibly sinew or a splinter of wood or bone was thrust through this hole to prevent the line slipping from the shank of the hook. A thin fragment of bone (perhaps from the center of a scapula) from 25FT20 may represent a stage of fishhook manufacture. One end shows a fresh break and the other is rounded. The sides are well smoothed and polished. Nearer to one side than the other is a longitudinal groove that extends nearly to the round, broken end. This groove al most passes completely through the bone. A medium-sized metapodial of unidentifiable species from 25FT39 was divided lengthwise and its center removed by grinding and sawing. The resulting object would have required little modifi cation to function as a fishhook (Fig. 110.9). Hide Abraders Four hide abraders, items rarely reported from prehistoric sites in Nebraska, consist of flattened hemispheres cut from the proximal joint of a bison humerus with the exterior bone trimmed from the edge, leaving the spongy, cancellous material ex posed (Fig. 112.6). A fair amount of wear can be observed on these surfaces. One hide abrader was recovered from a midden (Feature 2) at 25FT13 138</page><page sequence="46">Kivett &amp; Metcalf Medicine Creek Reservoir Figure 112.

Red pigment, probably hematite, impregnates the flat surfaces of the latter speci mea These objects perhaps were used to apply color to leather articles, rather than just for tan ning. Falk (1969c:40) described two similar speci mens from the nearby Mowry Bluff site (25FT35) as hide abraders. Gouges or Chisels Six gouges or chisels from three sites were made from the cannon bones of elk or bison (Fig. 113.2, 3). Their true function is unknowa They could have served equally well as digging tools or hide scrapers. The distal ends of the bones were removed and the shafts grooved. The resulting split exposed the porous bone, which was then removed. Following this, the distal ends were ground at a low angle on the split side and brought to a dull convex edge that is highly polished. The proximal ends occasionally are battered. These objects measure between 240 and 260 mm long. None of the blades is serrated. One example (Fig. 113.3), made from elk bone, has long striations suggesting that longitudinal grooving was neces sary to split the bone. The kerf was as much as 8 mm deep. This tool has a very dull but straight edge. Plug One item from 25FT17 was classified as a plug based on shape, but may have been a hide abrader (Fig. 112.2). It was cut from the articular surface (glenoid) of a large scapula, either bison or elk. Only the concave exterior of the bone that forms the base of the object was retained. The sides taper to a narrow end rounded in vertical cross sectioa The horizontal cross section is ovate, with maximum dimensions at the base of 37 by 40 mm. Knife Handles Four knife handles came from three sites. These artifacts are not common in Upper Repub lican assemblages. Local collections of Upper Re publican material are known to possess knife handles and similar artifacts are reported from related sites on Davis Creek in Howard County 139</page><page sequence="47">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Memoir 30, VoL 42, No. 162 and from other sites in Franklin County. A knife handle was retrieved from a subfloor feature in House 1 at 25FT28. It measures 144 mm long and was made from a section of a large rib or dorsal scapula spine. Along 43 mm of one end the bone was cut or scraped away to a depth of 5 mm to form a slot. The cancellous bone was removed from the interior. Into this slot, one of the dia mond-shaped, alternately beveled "Harahey" knives, or leaf-shaped blades, could be wedged firmly into spongy bone. The handle is pierced near the upper center edge with a straight-sided perforation 4 mm across. It is carved and incised to depict a possible bird effigy (Fig. 112.3). Another slotted handle came from House 1 at 25FT20. Made of a rib, it measures 122 mm long. Along 53 mm of its length from one end, the superior border of the rib was removed to a depth of 3 to 4 mm and the cancellous bone removed to allow insertion of a blade. Near the opposite bor der, and midway between the ends, is a biconical perforation measuring 5.5 mm in diameter. This handle has no decorations. Another undecorated knife handle was found in a midden (Feature 45) at 25FT17 (Fig. 112.4). It measures 125 mm long and was prepared to accommodate blades at either end. At one end, the border was removed to a depth of about 5 mm along 33 mm; at the other end, it was removed to a depth of 10 to 14 mm along 55 mm. Similar objects, with blades of brass or iron, have been excavated in sites of the Lower Loup aspect in Nebraska. Strong (1940:365-380, 1945:60-61) reported specimens from contact sites in both North and South Dakota. Cut Phalanges Three deer phalanges from three sites had the proximal ends cut off and the cancellous bone removed from the interior (Fig. 110.11). A deep incision across the distal end between the two lateral condyles opens into the narrow cavity. All three items closely resemble the cups of the cup and-pin game; however, they also may have served as ornaments. Punched Phalanges Four bison phalanges from three sites are unaltered except for a roughly circular to oval punched hole ineitherthe ventral or dorsal surface. The punched holes sometimes contain fragments of the outer bone surface that were driven into the spongy interior. A punched phalanx from a shal low midden area (Feature 14) at 25FT17 has a ragged edge opening into the dorsal surface that measures 12 by 24 mm (Fig. 112.1). The long axis matches that of the bone. The cancellous bone opposite the opening was removed to the ventral surface. These specimens are slightly polished, but extensive use is not evident. Punched phalanges were reported by Wedel (1934:202-203) for the Medicine Creek Upper Republican sites Lost Creek and Holdrege. Wedel suggested they were used as dice or in some other form of gambling. Hill and Kivett (1940:163) reported six similar items from 25VY1, the type site for the Woodland period Valley focus. Each of these phalanges was perforated on the ventral surface, evidently not fortuitously. Beamers Eleven beaming tools, including five made of bison vertebral spines and at least three made from fragments of scapula hoes, all show slight polish over their entire surface with more wear on one edge at the center. They are smooth with rounded edges. One beamer from House 4 at 25FT17 meas ures 246 mm long and between 40 and 50 mm wide (Fig. 114.4). A second one from 25FT17 has a marked concavity on one edge, 50 mm long and 10 mm in maximum depth A smaller depression, 20 mm long and 7 mm deep, occurs on the opposite edge (Fig. 114.1). This tool is 122 mm long and averages about 70 mm wide. A beamer from 25FT22 is 198 mm long and 70 to 80 mm wide (Fig. 114.2). The thin side is concave and the edge is dull and rounded. The concavity is about 12 mm long and 10 mm deep. Three antelope metapodials also may have served as beamers. The best example came from House 1 at 25FT20 (Fig. 114.5). Following a natu ral groove in the metapodial, a deep score was cut between the ends to open the shaft midway. The opening was then widened. It now measures 39.5 mm long and 5 mm wide. Rather sharp edges in the center of a slight concavity result from wear. A shallow groove encircles the shaft of the bone near the proximal end, as if the original intent had 140</page><page sequence="48">Kivett &amp; Metcalf Medicine Creek Reservoir " 1 sk m^m^m^m^m\'/WBrfm^m^m^m^m\' lm^M^m^m^mm\^m^m^m^m^mm^M^M^m^m^mw ^ahbBaBfl Figure 113.

Part of a similar artifact from 25FT17 is a bone fragment divided lengthwise and more worn at the center (Fig. 114.3). Wedel (1943:47-48) described simi lar metapodial beaming tools from a Hopewellian site near Kansas City, Missouri. A beamer also was identified in an Upper Republican site in Howard County, Nebraska (Metcalf 1939), and another was mentioned from a Middle Ceramic Horizon in Ottawa County, Kansas (Wedel 1943:196). Weavers Two weaving tools from Upper Republican sites very likely were used in making matts or basketry. One weaver from 25FT13 was made from a thin, flat section of bone that is slightly curved, possibly a rib (Fig. 110.21). One side is well polished. On the other a large amount of well-smoothed cancellous material is exposed. The edges also are smooth and polished. The base is rounded and the point missing. This weaver is 96 mm long with a maximum basal width of 11 mm, tapering to a minimum width of 8.5 mm at the broken end. It does not exceed 3 mm in thick ness. A biconical perforation, 4 mm across, is 8 mm from the base. A second slightly curved bone weaver from House 6 (Feature 66) at 25FT17 apparently was made from a split rib and measures 215 mm long (terminating at an old break at one end) (Fig. 113.4). The object is 20 mm wide. On one surface the porous inner material is exposed, but well smoothed. Striae are absent on the sur faces of the tool, but present on the edges, and probably result from manufacture. The point is dull and rounded, completely unlike an awl, and much too blunt for use in perforating leather. The tool is slightly polished. Flakers Four flaking tools include three rough speci mens and one that is more finely worked. A large, rough splinter, perhaps broken from the smaller end of a bison ulna, has a ground and polished point on the smaller end. The tip is missing, but the beveling suggests that it was too blunt for use as an awl (Fig. 110.22). Two other rough bone splinters are reminiscent of flakers. One, perhaps part of a bison scapula spine, has blunt, well-pol ished points and is beveled on one side (Fig. 110.18). The well-finished flaker is a polished object probably manufactured from a rib. It is 119 mm long with a maximum diameter of 8 mm. The base is rounded and the point blunt. This tool is slightly curved and the sides are nicked and scratched to about 25 mm above the point (Fig. 110.23). Bird Effigy An object resembling a stylized "thunder bird" was recovered from a midden (Feature 65) at 25FT17 (Fig. 110.14). This highly polished bone artifact was cut from the central part of a scapula hoe and incised with a deep outline to break the surrounding material away. The "wings" (only one is present; the other could have broken off during manufacture or use) are narrow and drooping, rather than spread. Maximum di mensions are 60 mm in height and 29 mm in width. The resemblance to a bird is possibly fortuitous. Pins A possible bone pin was recovered from 25FT16 (Fig. 110.20). The round, slender shaft of highly polished bone measures 4.5 mm across and 130 mm long. It is pointed at one end, and the other displays an old break. About 2.5 mm below the break, the pin is encircled by a narrow groove. The point, while sharp, lacks the needle-like sharpness of an awl. The use of this object is unknown, but it may have served as an awl or hair ornament. Two fragments of similar objects came from 25FT22, and another specimen is from 25FT17 (Fig. 110.23) [Editor's note: this object was de scribed above as a flaker]. Earlier NSHS collec tions from Medicine Creek contain two more very similar specimens, including one complete exam ple with a rounded base encircled by six parallel lines. Wedel (1934:200) described this specimen as a bodkin. Plume Holder A polished bone tube, 36 mm long and 12 mm across, from House 2 at 25FT39 has a small, neatly drilled perforation 3 mm from the end on one side. Unfortunately, the opposite side is broken off, making it impossible to know whether it had a matching perforation (Fig. 110.15). This object 142</page><page sequence="50">Kivett &amp; Metcalf Medicine Creek Reservoir ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ '^^^^^^^^^Kj^^^^^^' ^ Figure 115. Modified human skulls: (1) 25FT39, House 2; (2) 25FT13, House 6. Photograph by A. E. Nixon, 1949 (neg. no. 172). may have been a bead; however, it is reminiscent of the "plume holder" described among the his toric Pawnee (Wedel 1936:84) and is placed in that category here. Cut Human Bone A cut human skull fragment was recovered near the bottom of a pit (Feature 51) in House 6 at 25FT13 (Fig. 115.2). This item was associated with a poorly preserved bison skull, an unfinished stone pipe bowl, a 60 pound boulder, mussel shell, and red pigment. The skull section shows traces of the red pigment on its exterior surface. The frag ment consists of the squamous portion of the occipital with only the posterior portion of the foramen magnum pre sent, the right and left parietals, small parts of the squamous of the right and left temporals, and a fragment of the frontal plate. The clava is quite thick and heavy but unmineralized and is that of a middle-aged adult, possibly a male (personal com munication, Robert B. dimming). An attempt had been made to cut the skull cap from the rest of the skull. An incision, deep in places, begins 20 mm from the sagittal suture and follows the left coronal suture for about 60 mm. The incision evidently continues across the upper squamous portion of the left temporal bone close to the parietal margia The incision cuts into the temporal line close to the squamous suture and across the squamous portion of the occipital 5 mm below the posterior border of the foramen mag num. It continues across a small part of the squamous portion of the right temporal and across the squamous portion of the right parietal. This line is 10 mm above the squamous suture and ends 15 mm from the sagittal suture and some 20 mm above the right coronal suture. A 40 mm long piece between the ends of the incision was broken off without incising. Wedel (1986:108-111) dis cussed this specimen and reports a comparable one from 25HN36. One can only speculate about this unusual specimen's purpose. Polished Mandibles An antelope mandible, including the molar area and ramus, was found in House 6 at 25FT17 (Fig. 113.8). This mandible had been broken off at 143</page><page sequence="51">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Memoir 30, VoL 42, No. 162 the molars. The break edges are ragged, as is the body of the ramus. As far back as the mandibular angle is an extremely high polish. Some teeth are missing and those that remain are broken off at the crowns. Immediately behind the last molar, a shal low, well-worn groove crosses the edge of the bone. A similar specimen from a midden at 25FT13 was broken at a point 10 mm in front of the molars. All the remaining sockets contain teeth The jagged surface of the break as well as the front portion of the mandible show a high polish. This specimen lacks the groove behind the teeth Comparable mandible objects have been re ported from Upper Republican sites in north eastern Nebraska (Cooper 1936:54), from the Nebraska aspect (Hill and Cooper 1937:315, 338; Bell and Gilmore 1936:325), and at the Steed Kisker site near Kansas City, Missouri (Wedel 1943:202). Falk (1969c:40) reported one from the nearby Mowry Bluff site (25FT35). These items have been called corn-shellers; however, the de gree and location of polish on the Medicine Creek specimens suggest they served another purpose, perhaps as digging tools. Brown (1964:382-384) suggested they were used as sickles. We remain doubtful of this function. Worked Teeth Two animal teeth were modified, perhaps for use as ornaments (Fig. 110.12-13). A bison incisor from 25FT16 has the root ground to a roughly square shape, reducing its size and exposing the pulp chamber. A conical hole 3 mm across that does not perforate the tooth was drilled on one side of the root. Another bison incisor from House 3 at 25FT39 has a shallow groove cut around the entire root. Cut/Polished Fragments Cut and/or polished bone fragments comprise manufacturing debris, rejects, and broken, uniden tifiable tool fragments, as well as complete objects of unknown function. A fragment of deer or ante lope metapodial from House 6 at 25FT17 has a long splinter removed from one side. At one end of the resulting gap on this tubular object are six shallow incised lines; at the opposite end of the gap are two slightly longer, opposed diagonal lines. Two long bone fragments, perhaps elk cannon bones, from 25FT13 have polished surfaces. One of them is from a pit (Feature 7) inside House 1. The larger one measures 94 mm long and has 20 fine, transverse incisions on one wide edge and 13 such incisions on the other edge (Fig. 109.3). The two specimens might be parts of the same object, perhaps a shaft wrench. From 25FT16 came the proximal end of an elk or bison metapodial that has its articular sur face partially ground smooth (Fig. 109.2). The object is 118 mm long. The distal end and most of the posterior shaft were removed by a diagonal ragged break. The anterior section of the bone was snapped off in a nearly straight line. The sides and back of the fracture are rough and unsmoothed. The chisel-like edge, where the front terminates, is smoothed and polished. The object may have served as a scraper after it was broken. Extending up from the edge is a deeply incised line, 60 mm long, that ends in a smoothly drilled conical pit nearly 10 mm across and 5 mm deep. The sides of the bone retain portions of 10 exceedingly fine, shallow incised lines, transversely placed. These lines clearly were made prior to the bone's being broken. Although this specimen bears some re semblance to the fleshing tools found at contact sites in the Plains area, more likely it was origi nally a shaft wrench that later served as a gouge or scraper. A fragment 120 mm long and 42 mm wide from 25FT16 was broken from the working edge of a scapula hoe. A deep narrow groove paralleled by countiess fine scratches begins at the sharpened edge and runs at a slight diagonal to the long axis of the object. The inner end meets a similar but shallower groove at a right angle. An almost iden tical scapula fragment, broken at the scored lines, came from 25FT13. Several broken slips of bone, apparently from ribs, show some polish and a few have traces of incised lines that may have been decorative. A bison or elk rib from House 2 at 25FT13 shows the method used in producing these bone slips (Fig. 113.1). The distal end of the rib was removed by cutting a groove across both faces of the bone and applying pressure. The break is uneven because the grooves were not directly opposite each other. The proximal end was snapped off without groov 144</page><page sequence="52">Kivett &amp; Metcalf Medicine Creek Reservoir ing. One edge of the rib is ground flat and smooth. The other end is deeply scored by a cut following the costal groove. A short, thin plate of bone 40 mm long and 17 to 18 mm in maximum width from a midden (Feature 42) at 25FT70 Area 2 has tapering sides and rounded corners (Fig. 111.3). The piece may be scrap material, but its edges are well smoothed and it looks like a finished product. Another un usual complete and finished object came from 25FT36 (Fig. 111.2). This item is elongated, with straight sides and rounded ends. It measures 80 mm long and 15 mm wide, with a uniform thick ness of 4 mm. No thinning or sharpening is evi dent. The object is very slightly curved and a small amount of cancellous bone is present on one side. It is symmetrical and carefully finished, though not highly polished. While the original function of this specimen is unknown, its secondary function may have been as a gaming piece, more specifi cally, a die (Culin 1907:53-57). ANTLER ARTIFACTS Eighty-one antler artifacts came from the Up per Republican sites. The same methods (i.e., grinding, scraping, and drilling) for manufacturing bone tools were used in making antler tools. Fif teen of the 81 specimens are scrap items of identi fiable function. The seven distinct categories used here are based on form: awls (previously de scribed), cylinders, flakers, hammers, handles, bracelets, rods, and scraps. Cylinders The 33 cylinders make up the greatest number of antler objects (Fig. 113.5-7). They generally are cut from the basal portion of deer antler. The cut ends are ground smooth and frequently the whole surface is polished. The burr or swelling at the base of the antler is commonly polished; in some, nearly the entire surface was removed. Cylinders follow the natural curvature of the antler. Com plete specimens range between 105 mm and 165 mm long with diameters between 19 and 34 mm. A few specimens show further modification. A cylinder from 25FT17 is ovate with a cavity in one side (Fig. 113.6). It measures 19 by 44 mm. The original depth of the cavity is uncertain, but the soft inner material is now missing to a depth sufficient to expose the outer shell on the opposite side. The antler is pooriy preserved. We could not determine whether the outer shell was removed by battering, cutting, or grinding. Another cylinder from a pit (Feature 7) in House 1 at 25FT13 measures 115 mm long and 19 mm across, has marked curvature, and is well polished (Fig. 113.7). The burr is smoothed. The shaft is encir cled diagonally by an incised line about 8 to 13 mm from the distal end; this scoring may have been in preparation to break the antler or, less likely, for inserting a stone blade. A well-burned incomplete cy Under made from a large antler came from 25FT70. Immediately above the burr, the shaft is half-encircled with a shallow, highly pol ished groove not exceeding 10 mm in width. An other specimen from House 8 at 25FT70 Area 2 has a high polish on one side toward the distal end. The polish is less marked toward the base and ends before reaching the midpoint of the tool. Uses suggested for these cylinders include knife handles, flakers, drifts, and rubbing tools. Cylindrical objects are reported commonly at Woodland and earlier sites (Davis 1962:85; Kivett 1953:119). As a series, however, similar tools recovered from earlier sites tend to be shorter than those from the Upper Republican period. For ex ample, the five examples from the Woodruff Os suary (14PH4) range from 47 to 75 mm long, whereas those from Medicine Creek Upper Re publican sites range from 105 to 165 mm long. In Woodland and earlier sites, anfler cylinders are more often recovered in burials (Kivett 1952:65 66). Oothoudt (1976) reported shorter specimens from the Woodland period Gering Burial site (25SF10). Flakers Thirteen deer antler tines, well-polished at the tips, are identified as flakers. It is extremely diffi cult to distinguish natural polish on the tine from polish produced by use; therefore, only those tines with ends that appeared to be blunted or broken by use are classified as flakers. One specimen (Fig. 105.3) from 25FT17 has the tip worn off at an angle, leaving a surface between 7 and 8 mm across. Another object in this category is anoma lous: the beam of a deer antler was cut through, above and below the tine, leaving a T-shaped 145</page><page sequence="53">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Memoir 30, VoL 42, No. 162 object (Fig. 105.6). This piece came from a pit in House 5 at 25FT17. Hammers The hammers are cut from elk antler beams, leaving a tine attached. There are four specimens from three sites. Usually the beam was cut imme diately above the brow tine and the basal portion of the antler left intact to serve as the striking face. The heads are battered and generally the tip of the tine, which served as the handle, is broken. One hammer-like specimen from a midden (Feature 8) at 25FT16 has two deep, intersecting diagonal incisions on each side of the head. The point of intersection is away from the handle. This badly broken specimen bears close resemblance to a hammer from a related site in Howard County, Nebraska (Metcalf 1939). Cooper (1936:56) de scribed a similar specimen from the Schultz site, a St. Helena focus site in eastern Nebraska, as a "hammer." Handles Two measurable specimens from 25FT30 are 236 and 323 mm long and may have served as handles that were grooved to affix a stone tool (Fig. 105.4, 7). Bracelets No complete bracelets were found, but five fragments may be so classified. One, from 25FT17, is a very thin fragment of antler measur ing 20 by 25.5 mm (Fig. 110.16). Three sides have broken edges and the fourth is rounded and well polished. There is a 3 mm wide perforation 4 mm from the edge. Two small and badly broken slips of antler that fit together are probably from a similar object, also from 25FT17 (Fig. 110.6). Their combined length is 64 mm and width is 8 mm. They are slighdy curved, and their outer surface bears an incised line diagonal to the length of the object that divides this surface into two zones, one about three times the width of the other. The wider zone has incised parallel, diagonal lines between 4 and 5 mm apart. Another thin, polished slip of antler from a house floor at 25FT17 has an old break at each end. The object measures 75 mm long and 27 mm wide. Its curvature classifies it as a bracelet fragment. A particularly thin fragment of bone, or possibly antler, has one round and polished edge. The other edges are brokea One break passed through two 5 mm holes that are 22 mm apart; one is 5 mm from the unbroken edge. Another fragment of antler from 25FT70 is curved and polished, measuring 18 mm long, 4 mm wide, and 2 to 3 mm thick. Both edges are intact, but both ends are broken. Rods The six rods in Upper Republican sites are well made, slighdy curved objects of antier, round to ovoid in cross section, with basal rounding and dull, rounded points. Some have narrow edges that contract slightly to resemble the tip of a screw driver. Three rods were found near the right arm of Burial 1 (Feature 40) at 25FT13 (Fig. 116.16 18). Although not particularly well preserved, they appear highly polished and fme longitudinal striae can be seen where the original surface remains intact. The best preserved specimen is 192 mm long. Maximum diameter, at its center, is 8 mm. The object tapers very slightly towards the ends. The end with the edge has a width of 6 mm. The second specimen from 25FT13 is 196 mm long and has a 7 mm diameter. The base is round. The other end is too badly rodent damaged and decayed to allow determination of its form. The last of the three items from 25FT13 has an old break at the base. The sides taper more than on the other speci mens. It terminates in a dull, blunt point and meas ures 151 mm long and 8 mm across. Two fragments apparently from the same type of object came from House 1 at 25FT22. One fragment, broken at each end, measures 51 mm in length with a diameter of 9 mm. The other fragment has a flattened "screwdriver" tip. Scraps Small pieces of modified antler were found at most of the sites and represent scrap or manufac turing rejects. Fifteen specimens were recovered from seven Upper Republican sites. SHELL ARTIFACTS Despite the abundance of freshwater mussel shells, relatively few were altered or used as tools and ornaments. Only 64 shell artifacts were iden tified, with at least 15 (23%) of them made from 146</page><page sequence="54">Kivett &amp; Metcalf Medicine Creek Reservoir Figure 116.

Photograph by A. E. Nixon, 1949 (neg. no. 116). marine shells. Serrated-Edged Shells The most common objects of worked shell from the Upper Republican sites are 18 specimens, whole and fragmentary, with notched serrated edges, all made from freshwater mussels. The notches vary from coarse and rough to very fine. Usually, they are on the ventral margin at the widest part of the shell, opposite the hinge. An occasional shell, however, has notches along the entire hp. These shells may have served as scrap ers. A few of the broken specimens show a wear pattern of very shallow nicks (Fig. 117.1-3). One specimen, missing a small portion of the posterior end, bears scattered U-shaped serrations on its broken edge, rather than sharp, V-shaped notches. Perforated Shells Seven river mussel shells have as their only intentional modifications a broken or cut, often irregular hole through the bulging portion of the shell (Fig. 117.4-7). On some specimens, this per foration may be fortuitous. Among the reasonably complete shells, perforations range from 2.5 mm across to a ragged 14 by 19 mm or 17 by 19 mm across. Two fragments have traces of even larger perforations. One hole is 29 mm wide and of indeterminable length due to breakage. A broken shell bears a very regular, almost circular, perfo ration about 7.5 mm across at 23 mm below the dorsal margin. This hole was punched or drilled from the exterior of the shell, causing scaling of the interior surface over an area twice as large as the hole. Scrapers Seven whole or fragmentary shells served as scrapers (Fig. 117.8-10). One shell has the poste rior end ground off beyond the pallial line and the edge worn smooth. Other shells are battered or worn on the ventral margia One of the latter has several deep scratches on the interior surface. An other shell has at least a 7 mm wide hole in its margin that was either worn or ground away. 147</page><page sequence="55">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Memoir 30, Vol 42, No. 162 b^bIHbI^bHbb^bb^b^b^b^b^b^b^bHHP^P^ ? ^b^bI BB^B^^^^^S^^^^^bIb^B^B^B^B^B^B^bV .^^^ft^^' E^bb^b^b^b^bm. fl^b^bh b^Bm^^^^^^^^SB^b^b^ak ^KTSbH ^M^^^bb^b^bs ^ b^bHbIbII^^ ^.^^^H Figure 117.

Seven small shell disk beads were re ported from six sites (Fig. 118.13-16). They meas ure from 7.5 to 10 mm in diameter. All have a central perforation ranging from 3 to 5 mm across, biconical in four of the beads, straight in one bead, and of undetermined shape in two. All disk bead specimens are complete and carefully finished with a high polish. They measure 2.5 to 4 mm thick, with both extremes occasionally noted on a single specimea In two instances, the shell used appears to be of marine origin. Tubular. One tubular shell bead was recov ered from 25FT16 (Fig. 118.12). It is made from the "columella of a large marine gastropod (Busyconl)" (personal communication, J. P. E. Morrison) and measures 10 mm long, 7.5 mm at greatest diameter. The sides taper very slightly from the center to the ends. The perforation is approximately 5 mm across. The ends were reamed out to a depth not exceeding 2 mm. It also is drilled from each end. The bores are slightly offset at the point of juncture. Several similar tubular beads were recovered by Strong from the Graham Ossuary of the Upper Republican aspect (Strong 1935:111-114). Olivella. Five Olivella shell beads (personal communication, Harold A. Reher) from the Medi cine Creek Upper Republican sites have apices as well as part of their spires ground. One bead was inHouse 1 at25FT17(Fig. 118.11), another came from a storage pit in House 2 at 25FT16, and three were associated with a burial (Feature 40) at 25FT13 (Fig. 116.6-8).16 Pendants Pendants from the Upper Republican sites include 11 complete or fragmentary specimens divided into four categories: bear claw (4), circu lar/oval (2), blanks (2), and fragments (3). Bear Claw. Three complete pendants and one broken specimen from three sites are "Bear Claws" according to Wedel's (1934:204) termi nology (Fig. 118.2-4, 7). These pendants range in shape from subrectangular through lanceolate to an elongate piriform. The smallest measures 22 mm long and has a maximum width of 8 mm.

The perforations, all placed at the widest end, are biconical with diameters of 3 to 4 mm. All the bear claw pendants are highly polished. The majority are believed to be marine shell. A rectangular object, probably cut from a river mussel, with part of a perforation at one end is placed in this category, although it was pierced at the narrower end (Fig. 118.7). It is 40 mm long and well polished. Maximum width is 10 mm, tapering to 7 mm at the perforated end. The perfo ration was about 3 mm in diameter and drilled from one surface. Kivett (1953:120) wrote that bear claw pen dants in burials are diagnostic of Upper Republi caa They are absent in Keith focus Woodland sites. The bear claw pendant is reported from Nebraska aspect sites. Hill and Cooper (1937:317) described and illustrated an example from the North Plattsmouth site (25CC3). Examples also occur in the St Helena Focus (Cooper 1936:58, 77). Circular and Ovate. Two circular/ovate pen dants were recovered. A highly polished, roughly circular specimen from 25FT39 was fashioned from the umbo of a river mussel shell (Fig. 118.5). The edges are ground smooth. Measuring 36 by 40 mm, this pendant has an elongated 3.5 by 5 mm perforation toward the back of the hinge, immedi ately below the dorsal margin. The second exam ple, also from 25FT13 and also made from a river mussel, is damaged by decay (Fig. 118.8). A por tion is broken from one side at the lower end. This pendant is 55 mm long and 26 mm wide. Its perforation is 4 mm from the edge and 4 mm across. It was drilled through the thickest part of the shell. Blanks. Of the two pendant blanks, both from 25FT13, one is a highly polished subrectangular piece of shell measuring just over 25 mm long and 149</page><page sequence="57">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Memoir 30, VoL 42, No. 162 15 mm wide. A tiny pit on one surface, 5 mm from the edge of the widest end, may be the beginning of a perforation (Fig. 118.21). The second blank is a triangular piece cut or broken from a very heavy shell (Fig. 118.22). Fragments. There are three possible pendant fragments. The two larger ones, from 25FT17 and 25FT28, appear to have been cut or broken from the lip portion of freshwater mussels and are poorly preserved (Fig. 118.1,9). The broken ends and edges are smoothed. They measure between 37 and 48 mm long, and 9 to 13 mm wide. Shell Disk An unperfo rated shell disk from 25FT39 measures 22 mm across and 2.5 mm thick (Fig. 118.6). The exterior surface is ground and partially polished. The edges are smooth and rounded. This specimen may represent a stage of bead manufac ture, but differs from Woodland ossuary shell bead blanks, which were drilled through before being ground to their final shape (Strong 1935:120; Kivett 1953:123). It is also possible that it repre sents a pendant blank. Incised Shell A large, thick-walled mussel shell from 25FT17 bears three incised lines across the inner surface of its lip at the anterior end (Fig. 118.20). A straight line, 20 mm long, extends from the margin to the pallial line some 10 mm below the anterior adductor muscle. This line is flanked on either side by a diagonal line that joins it near the outer margin to form a "turkey track" design. Grooving Tool A firm, solid white shell fragment from 25FT17 is possibly marine in origin (Fig. 118.17). Elliptical in cross section at the break, it is wedge shaped in vertical cross section and in outline. It measures 16.5 mm long, 13 mm wide, and 5 mm thick. Wedel (1934:203) described a similar Medi cine Creek shell object as a graving tool. Shell Rims Two objects from 25FT17 and 25FT28 were cut or broken from the lips of freshwater mussel shells. They have smoothed ends and edges and are poorly preserved. They measure from 37 to 48 mm long, and 9 to 13 mm wide. They may have been pendant sections. Unidentified Fragments Three unassigned worked shells include a highly polished rectangular artifact fragment from 25FT17 (Fig. 118.18). It is wedge shaped in verti cal profile, 19 mm long, 6 mm wide, and 1.5 mm thick at the broken end. The complete end is 4.5 mm wide and less than 1 mm thick. This specimen may have been a graving tool or bear claw pendant fragment. The anterior end of a thick, heavy river mussel shell has a battered semicircular indenta tion 10 mm wide and about 4 mm deep in the margin (Fig. 118.23). A marine shell (Busycon?) fragment with old breaks on all edges and a high polish on both faces measures 32 by 38 mm across and 5 mm thick (Fig. 118.19). It is probably a broken ornament. 150</page></plain_text>
