<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN CYPRUS 1997-2002 This report summarizes the principal archaeological explorations in the Republic of Cyprus since 1997. The information on excav- ations has been condensed from reports submitted annually to the Bulletin de Correspondance Hellenique, Reports of the Department of Antiquities Cyprus, and from individual reports and publications forwarded to me by site directors. Abbreviations used in this article appear inside the front and back covers. The rapid pace of discoveries in Cypriot archaeology is reflected by the number of international symposia, both in Cyprus and abroad, which have tackled a variety of themes. These include: 'Chypre et la Mediterranee Oriental', at Lyon (1997); 'Scripts and Seal Use on Cyprus in the Bronze and Iron Ages', at the American Institute of Archaeology meeting in Chicago (1997); 'Cyprus: the Historicity of the Geometric Horizon', at the University of Cyprus, Nicosia (1998); 'The White Slip Ware of Late Bronze Age Cyprus', in Vienna (1998); 'Cyprus in the 19th Century AD', at the British Museum, London (1998); 'Archaeological Field Survey I, Cyprus: Past History, Future Potentials', Nicosia (2000); 'The Chronology of Base-ring Ware and Bichrome Wheel-made ware', at the Royal Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities, Stockholm (2000); 'Le Temps des royaumes de Chypre, XIIIe-IVe s. av. J.-C.', at Lyons (2002); 'From Evagoras to the Ptolemies', at the Department of Antiquities in Nicosia (2002); ' Twenty years of Metallurgy' and 'The Philia Culture and the Transition from Chalcolithic to Early Cypriote', both at the University of Cyprus, Nicosia (2002); 'Egypt and Cyprus in Antiquity', at the Cyprus American Archaeological Research Institute, Nicosia (2003); 'A Celebration of the Kyrenian Ship Excavation' at the Cyprus American Archaeological Research Institute, Nicosia (2004); and two symposia on the Neolithic of Cyprus, both held in Nicosia (2002). The proceedings of these conferences have been published or are in preparation. NICOSIA DISTRICT A team from Macquarie University, Sydney, has been conducting a multi-disciplinary project in the Adelphi Forest, comprising archaeological survey, geomorphology, botanical studies and an assessment of the impact of human activity of the forest. In 1997 they excavated furnaces at Kimitiri and Lithosouri, appar- ently used in the production of bronze, charcoal and pitch, and also pottery kilns. The initial use of the circular structure excav- ated at Lithosouri appears to be associated with Hel pitch pro- duction. (BCH 1998) Excavations have continued at Idalion-Ambeleri, directed by M. Hadjicosti, Department of Antiquities. Excavations in the CC building yielded important administrative documents: plaster plaques and sherds with Phoenician inscriptions, bringing the number of Phoenician inscriptions from the site to 130. In room 6 the floor was cut by circular pits filled with ash and charcoal. In 1998 a limestone drain for drainage of rainwater was discov- ered and an oil press was found in 2000. Five large jars excav- ated in 1995 were restored in 1997. It has also become apparent that in the area around this building, and in the levels beneath it, are the remains of an imposing fortified architectural complex, dating to the CA period. These include the remains of the interior fortifications of Idalion (the N wall of the W acropolis) and probably also the earlier palace. Between 1997 and 1999 work concentrated on uncovering and restoring the remains of these fortifications. The wall, built of limestone blocks and 2-3m thick, was reinforced by a series of partition walls perpendicular to the S face, 0.9m thick and also built of limestone blocks. These walls were later used as the foundations for the walls of rooms in the W wing of a CC administrative building. A rectangular structure, probably a tower, was identified in room 5, indicating that not all the earlier walls were reused as foundations in the CC period. A second tower, measuring 10 x 11.5m, was excavated to the N of the CC building. This tower had three phases of use: the earliest phase corresponds to a much smaller tower (6 x 6.5m) and had lower courses of cut-stone masonry while the upper walls were built of boulders and bricks. In the second phase, contemporary with the reinforcement walls, the tower was extended to the N. In the final phase of use the tower was extended to the W. Traces of burning were found on the N and W sides of the tower, belong- ing to the destruction horizon of CA II, which affected the lower town and the palace. Large quantities of CA II sherds were found in the fill between the earliest walls. Similar material was also found in a destruction level along the N side of the city wall. The finds, primarily bronze and iron slag, crucible frag- ments and stone tools, indicate metallurgical activity in this area. Other finds include CA terracotta figurines. LC remains were found 70m NE of this building, compris- ing workshops identified in previous seasons. Excavations have revealed a wall of dressed masonry, similar to the ashlar masonry uncovered at other LC urban centres. The associated pottery dates to the 12th-1 1th Ct. The head of an imported Myc figurine was also found. (BCH 1998,1999, 2000, 2001) P. Gaber (University of Arizona) continued work at Idalion in the area of the lower town. In 1995 the American team had identified a CC oil production facility, building B, in this area. Next to this building, in 1997, the team uncovered a rectangu- lar room with a ramp, a partition wall and a circular pit, appar- ently the emplacement for a storage jar. Numerous sherds belonging to large storage vessels were also uncovered. This building was used from the 4th Ct BC till the Hel period. To the E of the oil production facility was a large pit, 4m di., first iden- tified in 1992. Excavation of the pit was completed in 1997 and yielded quantities of votive material presumably from a sanctu- ary, including terracotta figurines and figured pottery, dating from the 7th Ct BC to the Hel period. A CA workshop was iden- tified in 1997 further to the E. Inside the building there was a large rectangular basin and some fragments of worked horn. A metallurgical installation was found to the W of the workshop, identified by bronze objects, fragments of iron and bronze/copper slag. Excavations also continued in the area of the temenos of Adonis on the E acropolis. This is an open-air sanctuary or sacred garden, which had three main phases of use, in the CG, CA and Hel periods. The CA altar recalls similar cultic equip- ment found at sanctuaries in Israel, at sites such as Tell Dan. (BCH 1998, 1999) An Australian team directed by David Frankel and Jennifer Webb completed the eighth and final season of excavation at Marki-Alonia in 2000 (site plan in D. Frankel and J. Webb, 'Excavations at Marki-Alonia, 2000', RDAC 2001, fig. 1.2). They have uncovered stratified sequences of buildings dating to Ph, EC I-II and EC III periods. In 1998 a large IA ditch was identified. The full extent of this trench was established in 1999-2000: 3m w., it cut NW across the site for 40m. Although the ditch destroyed some of the upper levels of the BA settlement, the earlier occupation levels survived intact. Two narrow streets were excavated in 2000. The surfaces were of densely packed, highly fragmented sherds and small stones. This street system was in use in the EC I-II settlement</page><page sequence="2">94 LOUISE STEEL and appears to continue into EC III and possibly MC I. Excavations in 2000 demonstrate that the Ph settlement was characterized by small freestanding buildings separated by open spaces - very different from the agglutinative architecture char- acteristic of the later EC-MC settlement. Traces of two separate phases of Ph occupation have been identified. A number of pits containing significant quantities of Ph pottery, an oven and a pithos burial were found in an open area in 1999. Re-used stone artefacts, including a chalk casting mould, incorporated into the Ph building material, indicate earlier activity at the site. Ph levels have also been identified in unit CXXI. Five pits were cut into the natural soil, two of which held large ceramic vessels. A three-roomed house was built over the Ph remains in the EC III/MC I period. Numerous household artefacts were found, including large quantities of rp pottery, six spindle whorls, grind- ing stones, and a finely decorated picrolite disc. In 1999/2000 a shallow circular pit tomb was cleared on the uppermost part of the Davari ridge. This had been looted but a large number of Ph rp sherds were found, together with some fragmentary human bone and a single dentalium shell bead. (RDAC 1999, 2000, 2001) Rescue excavations have continued at Agios Georgios hill (PASADY), Nicosia, the site of the new parliament building, directed by D. Pilides, Department of Antiquities (Fig. 1, after BCH 2001, fig. 43). Buildings of various periods have been located at various points on the hill. The latest, with poros and earth construction, date to the 19th Ct AD and are associated with British occupation. Hel structures have also been identified at two locations on the hill. Associated finds include stamped amphoras and a coin from Arsinoe (Marion). Below one of the Hel buildings an earlier structure with an earth floor was located at various points on the SW side of the hill. This was associated with several pits containing ash, broken female figurines and a chariot model. In 1997 three bothroi were excavated, containing animal bones, many of which were burnt, female figurines, a spearhead, astragaloi, and pottery, including cooking pots. In 1998 excavations were extended to the N and E. A Hel building with thick walls was uncovered, dated to the 3rd-st Ct BC by coins. A kiln, raw clay and ochre attest to the manufac- ture of terracottas. Metallurgical and textile production is sug- gested by the occurrence of slag and loomweights. Another bothros was excavated in this area, containing CA II pottery and two female figurines. Excavations continued on the SW side of the hill, and three main phases of architecture were identified. Traces of burning indicate that the second phase was destroyed by fire. The third phase is associated with numerous bothroi and has been dated to the late CA II or early CC periods. Traces of an earlier circular building have also been uncovered in this area, dated to the LChal period by the pottery. In front of the Philatelic Museum a Hel building was discovered. This is asso- ciated with a louterion and channels cut into the ground. The large number of loomweights suggests that these installations were associated with textile production. Excavations in 1999 uncovered coins ranging in date from the 3rd Ct BC (Ptolemy II) to the 1st Ct BC (Ptolemy IX Soter II, Ptolemy X Alexander I). Also in this area was a large bothros dating to the CA period. In it were found stone tools, pottery, a sheep jawbone and terra- cotta figurines including a male and a ram. A large area between St George's chapel and Denosthenis Severis Avenue was uncovered in 1999. The deepest levels in this area date to the LRom and Hel periods and are associated with limestone statues and terracotta figurines. An ECh church was identified in the upper levels. This had four main phases of use, the latest dating to the 16th Ct AD. In the second phase the church had three apses. The church of the third and fourth phas- es was decorated with wall paintings. Three kilns were found to the north. These contained vitrified plaster, burnt stone and brick, and appear to be associated with the construction of the church. 185 burials were excavated in the area, ranging in date from the ECh period to the 16th Ct AD. These were placed in elliptical tombs covered with broken stone or tile plaques engraved with a cross. One burial contained a coin of Constantine II that was restamped in the reign of Constantine IV (668-685) and in anoth- er grave two Lusignan coins were found, dating to the 14th-15th Ct. Canon balls from the upper levels confirm that the hill was used by the Turks during the siege of Nicosia in 1570. The sum- mit of the hill was also excavated. The remains of the early Anglican church of St Paul were completed uncovered. This was built by the British soon after their arrival in Cyprus, but was quickly abandoned, as the ground is unstable. No trace was found of Ohnefalsch-Richter's Hel sanctuary but in the lower levels there were CA deposits containing terracotta figurines, anthropo- morphic, horses and chariots, and a bird figure. In 2000 work concentrated on the Rom, Hel, CC and CA remains. A large part of area X was uncovered. The main build- ing here was Hel, but overlay earlier CA-CC remains. The building comprised rectangular rooms, several with hearths, which appear to be workshops; quantities of raw clay, unfired loomweights and waster figurines were found. There were also limestone fragments and chippings, illustrating manufacture of limestone statuettes. In the W area a cistern lined with hydraulic cement was excavated and in one room there was a sunken pithos, indicating storage activity. In area IX seven cisterns arranged in two rows were uncovered, and partially excavated to a depth of 1.5m. A hearth was found to the E, associated with slabs of unworked limestone. Further up the hill are three more cisterns, lined with hydraulic cement. This zone is interpreted as an area for clay preparation and manufacture of clay objects, such as loomweights, figurines and pottery. Areas II and III to the S side of the meteorological station were levelled, apparent- ly during the British occupation, for the construction of houses. (BCH 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001) In 2000 the Podocataro Bastion, on the Venetian ramparts of Nicosia, was excavated by D. Pilides. The earliest defences, dating to the 16th Ct AD, were covered during the Ot period by layers of unfired brick and red earth. Beneath these layers three apparent walls were uncovered, built of unfired bricks. Between the walls the whitish ground sloped down to the ramparts. At intervals a series of unfired brick structures perpendicular to the walls formed rectangular platforms with semi-circular cuts, probably for gun emplacements. Pottery from the excavations included Italian imports, lead balls, numerous coins and Turkish pipes. Also there was a large stone lion's paw. (BCH 2001) The ruins of the monastery of Panagia Elikon, in the W Troodos, were excavated by C. Philotheos, in collaboration with Kykko monastery. Written records indicate that the monastery was in use during the Venetian period and the earli- er part of the Ot period, possibly beginning to fall into decline by the 17th Ct AD and soon being abandoned and ruined. The ruins and cemetery of the monastery were badly damaged in the 20th Ct with the opening of the forest road in the 1950s. Excavations focused on the ruins of the church and a small area of the annex buildings to the S. The church was completely uncovered, and found to be a single naved building. Entrances to the W and N were added at a later date. The building meas- ures 8.6 x 4.2m and the walls were preserved to a height of around 1.5m. The initial floor was covered with clay tiles. Fresco fragments were uncovered in the lower levels. To the E of the church there were six disturbed graves. The architectural remains, fresco fragments and associated pottery date the church to the 15th Ct.

The second architectural phase re-uses material of the first but is less care- fully executed. During this phase the earlier struc- ture was repaired, in particular the W fa9ade. The third architectural phase is characterized by the use of traditional Cypriot architecture - unfired mud- brick and a wooden frame. The buildings in this technique communicate via gothic arches of sand- stone. Most of the extant structure is built in this technique and it has not been possible to identify sub-phasing. In 2000 a hoard of Med coins was found by chance during a site visit to Potamia, in front of the church of Agios Mamas. The hoard, comprising 373 silver coins minted during the reigns of the Lusignan kings between 1285 and 1369, was found in a small jug. (BCH 2001) Between 1997 and 2000 a LC metallurgical site was excavated at Politiko-Phorades (Fig. 2), under the direction of A.B. Knapp (University of Glasgow) and V. Kassianidou (University of Cyprus). The site had been identified during survey in 1996, with a large quantity of slag and furnace material eroding out from the sides of a river channel. The main anthropogenic fea- tures of the site were an artificial cobble bank where the metal- lurgical activities took place and a slag heap. Small quantities of pottery were recovered: IA-Rom from the upper strata and LC I-II, including some pws ware. Five C14 samples were taken: two of these give a calibrated date of 12th-10th Ct BC and 1680-1410 BC. Over the three excavation seasons more than 3.5 tons of plano-convex slag were recovered, together with large fragments of furnace lining, tuyeres and gossan. Analyses of the slag indicate that the site was used for small-scale pri- mary smelting and attesting to the production of around 300kg of copper. (A.B. Knapp, V. Kassianidou, M. Donnelly, 'Excava- tions at Politiko Phorades: a Bronze Age copper smelting site on Cyprus', Antiquity 76, 2002, 319-20; RDAC 1998, 1999; BCH 1998, 1999, 2001, AJA 2003) A Franco-Cypriot team from the Universit6 de Provence (Aix- Marseille I), the Ecole Francaise d'Athenes and the University of Cyprus began a multi-disciplinary project in 2000 exploring the Med landscape of Potamia-Agios Sozomenos. Initial work comprised detailed survey, using GIS to plot geomorphological features and archaeological sites onto a base map of the region. Study of the survey material indicated three main occupation phases in the region: antiquity (6th Ct BC to 7th Ct AD), Frankish period (13th to early 16th Ct) and Ot period (late 16th Ct to beginning of 19th Ct). There was a clear absence of any mate- rial that could be assigned to between the 8th and 12th Ct AD, and it is not really until the 14th Ct that there is any substantial occupation in the region. A particular concentration of Med pot- tery occurred to the NE and SW of the Alykos river. More sur- prising is the limited quantity of Ot material. Preliminary examination of the Frankish architecture was completed. A plan and elevation was made of the chapel of Saint Catherine and trial trenches were excavated at the site of the chapel of Archangel Michael. The architectural history of the manor house at Potamia (Fig. 3) was also investigated. Three main phases have been identified. The earliest surviving architectural phase was identified in the S and E walls of the building around the E court, apparently dating to the late 14th Ct. This phase is characterized by walls built from limestone blocks, associated with blocked windows with gothic arches. A barrel-vaulted room on the ground floor, lying between the two Six CA limestone statues were discovered in 1997 during main- tenance work by the Department of Antiquities at the royal tombs of Tamassos. These number four recumbent lions and two recumbent sphinxes, all apparently made in a Cypriot workshop and dating to the 6th Ct BC. Traces of red, blue and black paint are preserved on the statues. The excavator argues that the statues were originally placed in pairs at the entrances to the monumental royal tombs. They were not however found in situ, but were collected together as if dumped. Possibly the statues had been removed and buried by Ohnefalsh-Richter, during his excavations of the tombs, but he had not had the opportunity to return to retrieve the objects. (RDAC 2001) LIMASSOL DISTRICT Sophocles Hadjisawas, Department of Antiquities, has com- pleted excavations of a large LC II settlement at Alassa- Paliotaverna. The focus of the 1997 season was to completely uncover the large building II, destroyed in a massive conflagra- tion. The sewerage channels were removed and the interior court was excavated. Also a number of pits for sunken pithoi were excavated both inside and outside building II. A large number of stamped pithos sherds were uncovered, with chariot scenes and representations of lions and bulls. More unusual was the representation of a fight between griffons and humans. Building II was an imposing structure covering an area of 1410m2. The bedrock was levelled prior to construction of the building. In the N part of the building the walls were built directly onto the natural rock, but in the S there was a founda- tion of large stones. The facade of building II was completely constructed in ashlar masonry with drafted margins. A storage area with four pithoi on stone bases was excavated to the N of building II. In the NW comer there was a rock-cut drain to carry 3 Potamia: manor house 2 Politiko-Phorades: excavation site</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN CYPRUS 1997-2002 97 away rainwater. Building II is possibly also the only completely ashlar-built structure so far excavated the island and the U-shape plan is also unique. The area E of building II, where a storeroom had been identified in 1997, was further examined in 1998. Here a building (III) with three rooms was exposed. These appear to be storerooms or industrial installations, suggested by a rock-cut channel lead- ing into a semi-circular structure. Building III is not on the same orientation as the other structures at Paliotaverna and it is partially cut into the natural rock. However, given its proximity to building II and the presence of pithos sherds stamped with scenes of bulls and chariots the excavators suggest that it was probably an annex of building II. A pit, some 2.6m deep, was excavated inside building II. This contained pottery, bulls' horns and fragments of a stone basin. In 1999 work continued in building III, con- firming it to be a large storage facility and oil press, and also that this structure was in direct contact with -4 the administrative centre in building II. Building III 2f&lt; measures 25 x 16m and the external walls were x l.lm thick, possibly to support an upper storey. It . was terraced into the hill and each room excavated was on a different level. In the N part of the build- ing there was a long narrow room, typical of LBA storage magazines. In a later phase the room had been divided in two by a carelessly built wall of / rubble blocks. The lower rooms are of particular / interest. A semi-circular structure lined with pithos sherds was uncovered in the E room. This was con- nected to a channel cut into the rock, which varied in depth between 17 and 30cm, and which led to a pit, 1.2m di.. The W wing of the building comprised small rooms, in one of which there was a small terra- cotta bathtub. The excavator suggests that these were domestic habitation rooms. The final season in 2000 focused on the archi- tectural sequence of building II and the internal entrance to the S wing was examined. This leads between the W wing and the central court. The N wall of the S wing functioned as a retaining wall, illustrating the effort involved in constructing building II on two different levels. Excavations were also completed in building III. Some later pebble floors were uncovered, but also throughout much of the building the earlier hard plaster floors were excavated. A pit, 1.9m deep, was excavated just outside building III, to the N. This contained a pithos with raised wavy line decoration, which had been broken in situ. (BCH, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001) Excavations by the Ecole Franqaise d'Athenes have continued at Amathus (BCH 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001). In 1997 Thierry Petit completed excavations of the palace structure on the ter- raced southern slopes of the acropolis (Fig 4, after P. Aupert 2000, Guide to Amathus, Nicosia: Bank of Cyprus Foundation, plan 7). Fragments of alabaster vessels and a faience amulet in the form of Bes were uncovered in the area of the storerooms. The western rooms of the palace were also explored. A thick deposit of destruction debris contained local and imported amphoras, numerous broken bowls, lamps and broken lime- stone votives and terracotta votives, Astarte plaques. These were mixed with melted plaster and fragments of burnt bone. Also found in this deposit were numerous Attic bg and rf sherds. A sounding beneath the plaster floor of room V allowed the excavators to refine the chronological phasing of the con- 0 5 10m , i t I i t i i 4 Amathus: plan of palace struction and use of the palace. Most significant was the dis- covery of CG III pottery, dating the initial construction to the mid-8th Ct BC, prior to the foundation of the temple of Aphrodite. The palace was subsequently re-modified around the 6th Ct and again around 500 BC. It continued to be used with no major modifications until the end of the 4th Ct, when it was abandoned and pillaged. The storerooms were re-used during the 3rd Ct BC, but were finally abandoned during the 1st Ct BC and became filled with debris. There was further exploration of the N wall, built along a rocky crest in the low-lying area between the acropolis and the adjacent hill of Vikles (BCH 2000). A thick deposit of earth- quake collapse was removed in the area of the Rom bastion in 1997. Beneath this there was an inscribed stela dating to AD 79-80, which dates the construction of the bastion to the 1st century AD. However, the date of the later earthquake collapse could not be established. In 1999 clearance of the destruction layer behind the curtain wall was completed and was dated to the 7th Ct AD by crs and a several pw basins. Work continued on the walls in 1999 (Fig. 5, after P. Aupert and A. Hermary 2000, 'Rapport sur les travaux de l'Ecole francaise a Amathonte en 1999', BCH 2000, fig. 1). They had been robbed out and were traced along the foundation trenches. The fortifications comprise two parallel walls, the thicker external wall built of large blocks, behind which lay a narrow curtain wall. These</page><page sequence="6">98 LOUISE STEEL 5 Amathus : plan of W zone between the gate and the SW comer of structures date to the CA and CC periods. A later, overlying wall is possibly contemporary with the Rom bastion. Between these later, Rom walls the entranceway leads up to the paved area of the N gate. Wheel ruts were visible in this paved surface. A series of rooms was uncovered inside the curtain wall, separated by a series of narrow partition walls. Inside the rooms the fill is Hel and Rom. Most significant was the discovery of the marble head of a statue of Aphrodite, which might indicate the exis- tence of a sanctuary to the goddess in the vicinity. This is sup- ported by the discovery of an inscription near the N gate in 1996, which mentions the dedication by T. Bruttius Maximus of a sanctuary to Aphrodite and the emperor Titus. Inside the curtain wall there were four kilns. Fl had been identified as a limekiln in 1996 (M. Wurch-Kozelj and T. Kozelj, 'Fours a chaux et fours a poix de l'antiquit6 a nos jours', Archdomatdriaux: marbres et autres roches, Amosia V, 1999, 359-68). Three more kilns were identified in 1999. Finds were rare: slag, a limestone mould with spout, and a crucible. The date of the kilns is unclear and their associated work surface has not been identified. F2, which previously had been identified as a cistern (BCH 1993, 709), was re-examined. Its walls showed signs of burning and the fill was mixed with ash, plaster and material of the 7th Ct AD. Beneath this a fine layer of ash, plas- ter and carbonized wood was excavated in 1999, covering a floor of blackened earth. This structure has been re-identified as a kiln. Beneath it there was an intact cooking pot associated with CA material. Excavations continued in building III, interpreted as mili- tary housing, located further E inside the N wall. On the floor of room 4 the excavators found 1st Ct AD material and frag- ments of painted plaster fallen from the upper storey. This was sealed by a destruction layer and occupation debris. Plaster decoration from the upper floor was also found in room 5. The destruction level of room 5a dates to the 2nd Ct AD. Around 30 Rom lamps of the 1st-2nd Ct AD were sealed beneath this. Two portable altars were found in room 5 and a third was found in the area between building III and the N wall. These have paral- lels in the early Rom forts of the eastern desert in Egypt. Martin Schmid completed a study of the architectural remains of the temple of Aphrodite on the summit of the acropolis, where the monumental stone vase housed in the Louvre was found. The broken remains of a second stone vase is still in situ on the acropolis and a reconstruction of the Louvre vase has been erected at the site (Fig. 6). The earliest evidence Ni/ of cult activity dates to the 7th Ct BC, but most of the terracotta and limestone figurines recovered at the a site date to the 6th-3rd Ct. Much of the CA structure, however, was destroyed by the construction in the 1st Ct AD of a large prostyle temple, built of lime- stone and with Nabataean capitals. A series of soundings was opened to explore the earliest use of 4' ^ the area as a sanctuary. In the SE comer, beneath the @ "4_ Rom temple and N of the broken monumental stone / vase, they found a series of rock-cut features (post / holes, channels) of CA date. These appear to be con- temporary with a possible sacrifical area to the W, which comprises a rock-cut circular platform, chan- nels, and postholes. Nearby there was a bothros. 30 m Overlying the remains of the sanctuary is the ECh basilica. Much of the building material appears to be KO EU re-used from the earlier temple at the beginning of / the 7th Ct AD. Particularly noteworthy is the fine / ?~&amp;_ opus sectile pavement. This had been removed to allow excavation of the earlier levels but has been tower B re-laid. The Department of Antiquities has continued exca- vations at the lower town of Amathus, directed by P. Florentzos. In 1997 work concentrated on a public building. A large room on its W side had been excavated in 1996. This had a grand entrance to the N and a smaller doorway communicating with the rooms to the E. The exterior wall of the building was uncov- ered in the NE. The grand entrance belonged to the initial phase of construction of this wall, but following the earthquake in the 4th Ct AD the doorway was made smaller. By the time of the final destruction of the building it was completely blocked up. A large open space was excavated to the S of the building, prob- ably an external southern court. Finds from the structure included pottery, Byz coins, lamps, heads of stone statues, and seal- stones. One large circular seal was inscribed with a representa- tion of a standing saint, a personification of a sun-disc and a short inscription. Two passages to the NW of the public build- ing connected it with a series of smaller buildings. One of the passages was oriented N-S and led from the W entrance of this building to the agora. This passage had two phases of use: in the earlier phase it was paved but during the later phase and at the time of its destruction it had a tamped earth surface. The second passage lay on an E-W orientation and led to the S entrance of the public building. Three rooms of a small domestic structure were investigated in 1999. The central room had two H-shaped hearths and a doorway to the N, leading into a rectangular paved space meas- uring 6.5 x 8m. This last room was furnished with two lime- stone benches made from a re-used pillar and a re-used column, a built bench and a hearth. There was also a large pithos and an amphora. The complex was further explored in 2000. A bench 6 Amathus: reconstruction of stone vase from the sanctuary</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN CYPRUS 1997-2002 99 was uncovered along the E wall of the central room, and in its centre there was an arch built over the earthquake debris of the 4th Ct AD. A corridor to the S led into a square room. Beneath this there was an earlier room, furnished with steps and a paved doorway leading onto the road. Finds from the 2000 season include Rom and Byz coins, a 7th Ct stemmed glass goblet and several architectural fragments. (BCH 1998, 2000, 2001) The Department of Antiquities continued excavations of a large ECh cathedral in 1997. Four rooms along the N portico were uncovered. In three of these there was clear evidence for re-use of the building at the end of the 7th Ct AD, following its destruction at the time of the Arab invasions of AD 653-654. Architectural material from the initial construction of the basil- ica was re-used for temporary shelters and workshops. One such structure, in the NW comer of the peristyle, had a mill- stone for grinding flour and a bread trough. (BCH 1998) Since 2001 an American team from the University of Cincinnati, directed by Gisela Walberg, have been working at Episkopi-Bamboula. In 2001 the site was surveyed and eight trenches were opened in area E along the Erimi-Episkopi road. In one trench a well was uncovered, 9.5m deep. The upper fill contained mixed pottery, largely LC II and CA I, but with occa- sional EC and Rom sherds. Material recovered from the lower strata was BA: loom-weights, a wall-bracket, ground stone and a compete Myc shallow cup. Other pottery included br, ws and bu. A complete rl arm-shaped vessel was found in the lower strata (Fig. 7), together with a possible ivory fragment and a bronze hook. A number of large millstones and a stone trough were found in a disturbed area to the W, associated with a gaming stone, a wall-bracket and a large wp rim sherd. A LC tomb was excavated nearby. This had been plundered during the IA - dated by wp and bi IV sherds in the looters' pit - but rich material was still recovered, including a potter's wheel, an ivory disc, whole unworked hippopotamus tusks (Fig. 8), bronze pin and a gaming stone. Ashlar masonry - a fragmentary block and a broken-off pillar - were also found in the looters pit, evidence of a monumental building in the vicin- ity. Two other looted BA tombs contained only broken ceramics and fragmentary bones. A large Rom tomb was also explored. This had been looted, but a glass flask and a piece of an unguen- tarium were recovered. Six different areas of the site were explored in 2002. In one area a series of rock-cut pits was excavated. Two of these were connected and probably represent a production installation, possibly a wine press. The associated pottery is Rom. A second processing area was found: a pit with two channels used for the collection of liquids. Postholes and a cutting in the rock might indicate the presence of a shelter. Near the summit of the hill the excavators believe they might have identified one of the entrances to the BA town. Near to this the collapsed wall and floor of a LC building were excavated: pottery recovered from the floor includes br and ws ware. A second BA well was iden- tified on the north slope of Bamboula hill. Pottery recovered from the fill mainly comprised pithos sherds, including one with a seal impression of groups of men and bulls (Fig. 9). Dog bones from at least 36 individuals were also found. Further to the E the team excavated three tombs. One incredibly wealthy tomb was used in the LC, CG and CA periods. Finds include a gold earring, a bronze fibula, two bronze earrings, and a seal with a bull's head. Remains of an individual who had suffered from chronic osteomyelitis were found in a CA jar. Several other poorly preserved skeletons were found and a large num- ber of ceramic vessels. In 2003 work focused on two different areas: the summit of the hill and the SE area overlooking the Kouris river, where a 7 Episkopi-Bamboula: Red Lustrous arm vessel 8 Episkopi-Bamboula: hippopotamus tusks 9 Episkopi-Bamboula: impressed pithos sherd large number of stone blocks were observed in 2001. Excavations on the summit revealed two walls one of which was 0.9m w., part of a large building. Both walls were built from havara blocks and were probably robbed out at the time of the construction of a third wall in the CA period. The fill from the level of the walls and to the modem surface is mixed, LC-Rom periods. The disturbance was a result of Rom and later culti- vation as well as to the construction of the CA wall. A tomb (Fig. 10) excavated on the NE of the top of the hill contained LC, CG and CA pottery. Skeletal remains of at least two indi- viduals were found scattered across the tomb area. The tomb dates to the LBA and was clearly reused several times during the CG and CA periods. A nearby pit containing ws sherds, two complete CA jugs and a few Roman fragments, including a lamp, suggest that the tomb was looted in the Rom period. Five pits were found S of the hill summit. One pit contained an anchor, a large quer and a chert nodule. Two fragments of CA horse figurines were also found as well as LC, CA and Rom</page><page sequence="8">100 LOUISE STEEL beneath the cave. Several large blocks were aligned with the stone formation to the SE suggesting that the formation continued up to and enclosed the cave. A hearth with the rim of a large pithos of uncer- XF i5-w5' tain date was uncovered below the cave. Further to 3 the S there was a well-built wall, constructed from a , combination of relatively large blocks, interspersed - with small flat stones. The date of the ceramics asso- ciated with this wall is inconclusive. Some frag- X ^ ments are clearly Rom, while one may be identified i rn =ltllll=C] 8 as an imported Myc sherd. Another wall on a higher l- flEilflaiiw ! elevation was oriented slightly more to the NW. This M wall is later and associated with some Rom coarse S 0 0 E h ware fragments. There was no stratigraphic 5S || gs sequence in the area outside the cave. The ceramics 8, from each stratum were mixed LC, CA, CC and Hel. Four trenches were opened to the W of the stone 311 l formation. Five strata were identified in the trench by the S side of the hill. All strata were clearly dis- turbed, containing mixed material of CA, Rom and Byz date, and seven Lusignan coins were found in the uppermost layer. Architectural elements include a poorly built wall in stratum 1 and a hearth in stratum 3, mainly associ- ated with Rom pottery. Rubble and Rom architectural elements were found in stratum 5. The finds from an adjoining trench showed the same sequence. Two trenches were opened further to the N and W of the stone formation. Both were filled with rubble. A large Rom cistern lined with hydraulic mortar spanned the area of both trenches. The Department of Antiquities has continued work on the Med sugar mills at Episkopi-Kolossi and Episkopi-Serayia. At Kolossi, the vaulted refinery building has been uncovered, together with an extensive system of stone drains. Structures cut into the rock were identified to the W of the mill. These appear to be associated with the mill's water system, given their prox- imity to the aqueduct. The principal finds were fragments of vessels associated with the sugar refining process. Numerous terracotta pipes of Ot date were also uncovered. (BCH 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001) In 2001 a unique LC site was discovered at Erimi-Pitharka during construction activity, in the vicinity of the rich EC-MC necropolis of Erimi-Ka.#salla. A large opening in the soft havara bedrock was uncovered by the bulldozer7 leading into a com- plex of seven subterranean chambers ranging from 2.6 to 7m w. (Fig. 11). Survey of the complex uncovered large quantities of LC sherds, stone tools and a single gaming stone. A stepped capital was found nearby. Excavations of the complex were undertaken by the Limassol Archaeological Museum: one chamber was completely excavated, two were partially exca- vated and the rest were generally cleared of surface finds. The chambers communicate with each other by means of corridors with low walls. There are three entrances to the whole complex, two of which are recent. The original entrance was located to the SE in the form of a long sloping dromos. Individual cham- bers exhibit architectural features such as pillars, partition walls, benches, air-holes, hearths, tethering holes and small niches. The ceramic assemblage dates to the 12th and 11th Ct BC and largely comprised pithoi, pw jugs and bowls and small quantities of cookware. Other pottery includes pwp bowls, jugs and stirrup jars, and an imported pilgrim flask. There were also f1ve incised amphora handles and a pictorial Myc krater rim fragment. Other f1nds include the hindquarters of a wheel-made terracotta bull f1gurine, a wall bracket/lamp and a piece of 10 Episkopi-Bamboula: tomb pottery. Another pit contained two large tabular blocks, char- coal, some olive pits and a shell fragment. A pit further to the W contained rocks of various sizes, large burnt pithos fragments, br and ws sherds. There were also bor sherds and a CA lamp fragment. Two other pits contained ws sherds and the remains of a burial were found in one. A large number of ws I sherds were found on a surface near the area of these pits. In the SE part of Bamboula hill a stone formation 46m 1. and c.4.5m w. was cleared of vegetation. This formation begins at the vertical southern face of the hill and ends at a cave in the vertical face of the hill. The extent to which this feature was formed by the bedrock or consisted of stone blocks placed on top of the bedrock could not be determined. However, a number of very large blocks (up to 4m long) were found on both sides of the formation. The stone formation enclosed two irregular features and another one lay outside further to the E. These comprise blocks placed directly on the bedrock, surrounded by a number of large blocks, and filled with small to medium undressed stones. The distinction between bedrock and stone blocks in unclear and the date and function of these features remain elusive. According to the geologist the cave was carved out by human agency and was probably a tomb; it was cleared of debris but was not excavated. A row of relatively large stones on loose soil and at a high level across part of the opening sug- gests that the cave was recently used as a shelter for animals. A number of blocks of varying size were also found in a slope 11 Erimi-Pitharka</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN CYPRUS 1997-2002 101 copper. There were also large quantities of ground stone, such as rubbers, grinders, pestles and saddle a querns. Although the chambers are underground, A l there is no evidence to suggest that they served as s r tombs at any time. The abundant evidence of pithoi w and utilitarian pottery, large open or communal 1-w--- areas, concern for proper ventilation, hearths and .-Z- t-u numerous stone tools used in the preparation of food are all suggestive of domestic activities and the manufacture and/or storage of commodities. 11! | | A ceramic Neo site at Kantou-Kouphovounos has 2 i a3 illlh been excavated by E. Mantzourani, University of Athens. The site has the typical 'Sotira' style sub- 111 | rectangular architecture with internal installations, k i X 2 such as hearths and platforms. Much portable equip- e | X il; ment was found on the floors, in particular pottery X and stone tools. Up to six phases of occupation have g g g been identified. The large quantities of picrolite ii;E ornaments are more unusual in ceramic Neo con- texts. Other finds include an anthropomorphic lime- stone figurine, a clay figurine fragment and a deposit of unworked jasper pebbles. Adult and child burials have been found beneath the floor in one house. (AJA 1998; RDAC 2001) Work has continued at the Amathus Gate Cemetery at Kourion (Fig. 12) directed by Danielle Parks. The focus has been on reconstructing the three main phases of use of the cemetery: Hel and Rom chamber tomb burials, quarrying activ- ity in the 4th Ct AD, and LRom cist tombs. In 1998 two areas were excavated: area A, adjacent to the Amathus Gate, and area B immediately to the S. The first intact sealed tomb was discovered in area A, shut with a large lime- stone lid (Fig. 13). It held the remains of at least two disarticu- lated inhumations and had a rich burial assemblage: two gold rings, a gold hoop earring with glass bead pendants, numerous ivory bracelet fragments, seven bronze coins and a gold solidus of Constantine II (c. AD 350), glass vessels, and a terracotta lamp. A small, intact charred vase was found overlying the tomb and a libation pipe was discovered adjacent to the head of the pipe. The excavator interprets these features as integral ele- ments of funerary rituals performed at the grave. A second tomb was also excavated in area B. The mixed skeletal remains indi- cate a minimum of eleven individuals, both adults and infants. Associated grave goods include three gold earrings, one bronze and two bone pins, a bronze coin, a cooking pot and occasional terracotta lamp fragments. (RDAC 1999) Excavations in 1999 concentrated on area A, focusing on the Hel-Rom chamber tombs and the later re-use of the area as a quarry. The quarrying platform was taken down to bedrock. There were few f1nds, largely washed down from the acropolis. Pottery included Rhodian amphoras, cooking pots, and LRom lamp fragments. There were also fragments of glass and tesser- ae, several CA and Rom f1gurine fragments and two Hel coins. A large number of fresco fragments and plaster mouldings were found in trench AV. These possibly derive from an elaborately decorated Hel-Rom chamber tomb or a reception building sim- ilar to the House of Achilles by the Paphos Gate entrance to Kourion. A circular limekiln was investigated, abutting the acropolis rock. Adjacent to this there was a LRom limestone cist lid, propped against the acropolis rock, probably intended to be burned in the kiln. This suggests that the kiln post-dates the LRom mortuary phase and the excavator suggests a date later than the Arab invasions (AD 688) for its use; it is comparable to the several lime kilns that have previously been identif1ed on the 12 Kourion, Amathus Gate cemetery: site 13 Kourion, Amathus Gate cemetery: sealed tomb and lid acropolis. Excavation of the limekiln was completed in 2000. A second limestone coff1n lid was identified in the feeding area. A small stone platform with a thick plaster facing was found near the kiln and a shelf, 1.8m long, was cut into the cliff face over this platform. Their function is unclear, but one possibility is that it was a Ch votive shrine, possibly used in conjunction with the platform. Also in 2000 a stretch of the city fortification wall was uncovered (3m l.and 1.6m w.). The foundations consisted of two layers: the lower layer of packed rubble, the upper layer of large flat stones with a rubble core. The upper courses have been largely robbed out, but traces of plaster facing have sur- vived. (RDAC 2000, 2001. See also BCH 1998, 2000) In 1997 and 1998 work at Kourion, directed by Demos Christou (Department of Antiquities) concentrated on the Rom agora and the ECh basilia. A badly preserved building at the SE end of the S portico of the Rom agora, measuring 6 x 4m recalls the stone naiskoi frequently found in Rom agoras. The lower walls of a watchtower were uncovered in the NW sector, adjoin- ing the town wall, dated to the CC period by the associated finds. Four porticoes of the basilica were uncovered, as were later annex buildings located to the W of the church. Polychrome mosaics with geometric designs were uncovered in the three aisles, dating to the 5th and 6th Ct AD. Also the remains of an earlier mosaic of the late 4th Ct AD were uncovered</page><page sequence="10">102 LOUISE STEEL 14 Parekklisha-Shillourokambos: serpentine feline head serpentine feline head beneath the marble threshold of the chancel. Another building was uncovered to the W of this basilica and some 50cm lower than the foundations of the W portico of the atrium. The floor was particularly well preserved and was covered with a geomet- ric black and white mosaic. This building appears to date to the late 4th Ct AD, contemporary with the initial use of the basilica. (BCH 1998, 1999) One of the most important archaeological sites to be excavated in recent years on the island is the Neo settlement of Parekklisha-Shillourokambos, under the direction of J. Guilaine. Work at the site has pushed the Neo colonisation of Cyprus back to the late 9th millennium BC, contemporary with domestication on the Levantine mainland. There are three main phase of aceramic Neo occupation. The early phase corresponds to level 2 (early phase A) and level 1 (early phase B). This rep- resents the earliest attested Neo occupation on the island and is characterized by a series of rock-cut features (post-holes, stake holes, pits and ditches, wells and cisterns) and vestiges of wood architecture. Above this lies the middle phase, level 0, typified by stone built architecture and painted plastered floors and walls. The uppermost aceramic levels, the late phase, corresponds to the occupation of other aceramic Neo sites, such as Khirokitia. There is also a series of pits containing rich deposits of pottery, which date to the ceramic Neo. In addition, four rectilinear structures of the historic period have also been uncovered. In 1997 excavations at the site continued in sector 1. In pit 23 there was a thick layer of material (level 0) containing household debris and at the bottom a dense deposit of animal bones. Beneath this the excavators found a deposit dating to the earliest occupation of the site, containing translucent chert tools and human remains - an isolated mandible against the NW side of the pit, and a badly preserved burial in a contracted position. A cylindrical cistern or well (st. 66) was also excavated to a depth of 2.5m, at which point excavation was halted. The fill, which includes translucent chert tools, obsidian blades and a serpentine feline head (Fig. 14, after J. Guilaine et al. 1999, 'Tete sculptee en pierre dans le Neolithique Pr6-Ceramique de Shillourokambos (Parekklisia, Chypre)', RDAC 1999, figs.4-5), dates to the earliest occupation of the site. Excavation of pit 23 continued in 1998. This measured 5 x 5m and was used as a rubbish pit. The hyper-contracted burial of a mature male, identified in 1997, was completely uncov- ered. This was placed in a packing of stone, creating a shallow basin. Beneath this burial were fragmentary remains of other human burials - skulls and isolated bones. The associated lithics belong to a transitional phase in the toolkit when opaque cherts replaced the translucent cherts. Four cylindrical wells were excavated in the W zone of the site (4-5m deep, 1-1.5m di.). A series of hand-holes was cut into the walls of the wells. The fill of the wells comprised abundant cultural deposits; deb- itage and cores of translucent chert in wells 1 and 114, and opaque chert and large blades in well 117. Other finds include 68 pieces of obsidian from Cappadocia, lumps of earth (build- ing material), ground stone tools such as grinders and polished axes, two pebbles incised with a cross-hatch pattern, a large basin (c.0.7-lm di.) of polished grey stone and a plaster sculp- ture of a human head. Further excavation of pit 23 in 1999 uncovered more human remains. Fifteen individuals were deposited in the centre of the pit (thirteen adults and two infants) and other disarticulated human bones were placed around the west wall of the pit, including three skulls. Mixed in with the human bones were quantities of animal bones, including fallow deer, pig skulls and sheep/goat limbs. Also found in the pit were two small objects sculpted from picrolite, one of which appears to be the repre- sentation of a boat. More burials were uncovered in 2000. Some were in a hyper-contracted position, while others were dis- turbed by the successive interments and were incomplete. The skulls were removed and arranged carefully. Burials of two children were placed against the S wall. At the base of this deposit of burials there was a well-preserved inhumation placed against the W wall. Further down there was another layer con- taining around fifteen human burials which display traces of burning, from simple burnishing to advanced calcination. This seems to represent some form of cremation (unique for this period) as a secondary burial practice, after the bones had ini- tially been exposed and defleshed. Pit 23 was therefore a major funerary facility used for collective burials and with several phases of use. The upper levels indicated that pit 23 was subse- quently re-used as a rubbish pit. Excavations in sector 3, in 1999, identified three very dis- tinctive zones of activity. Three circular buildings of the middle phase were identified in the E area, each around 3m di. and built of stone and mud. Rubbish and habitation debris had accumu- lated in the areas next to the houses over a long period of time. Of particular note are the large quantities of animal bones, espe- cially fallow deer but also caprids, which appear to be the debris of feasting. Very little cultural material was found in the central zone. However, there were several successive floor levels. Of particular interest are circular paved areas, 0.60.8m di., formed from flat pebbles. Parallel structures at Khirokitia have been interpreted as the base of grinding installations. A small pebble layer was uncovered in the W area, covering a surface of c.35m2 and associated with abundant animal bone, stone tools and stone vessels. This layer sealed a thick deposit of greyish sedi- ment down to a stratum of red clay, where translucent chert tools characteristic of the earliest occupation of the site were found. Structures from the earliest occupation of Shillouro- kambos were identified in a sounding. In the S part of this are there was a well, the opening of which was protected by a cir- cular stone wall. Finds from sector 3 include white limestone vessels, a polished axe, incised picrolite objects and a rare picrolite figurine. The stratigraphic sequence of sector 3 was established in 2000. This follows the same pattern established for sector 1. The I</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY IN CYPRUS 1997-2002 103 earliest levels of the early phase are characterized by ephemeral architectural remains. Other remains include a series of shallow basins filled with stones, possible hearths or ovens. In early phase B (early 8th millennium BC) there is a shift in tool tech- nology from translucent to opaque chert and increasing use of blades. This is also the layer where the first stone-built curvilin- ear structures appear. The middle phase is of long duration and is characterized by successive sequences of floors. Specialized activities - food preparation and cooking - were carried out in this phase in sector 3; illustrated by the excavation of several cir- cular paved areas interpreted as grinding installations. The upper levels correspond to the latest acermaic Neo occupation of the site, and are characterized by typical 'Khirokitia' stone and pise circular buildings. Finds from sector 3 are abundant: grinding stones, polished axes, chipped stone, including some obsidian (56 pieces in 1999 and 2000, taking the total number of obsidian from the site to 404 pieces), stone vessels, circular and barrel- shaped beads of picrolite and limestone, occasional stone repre- sentations (a stone phallus and a stone quadruped in 2000). The most recent discoveries at Shillourokambos are of a human bur- ial found in the same stratigraphic unit and in close proximity to a deliberate burial of a cat. The human burial was furnished with flint tools, polished stone axes, and ochre. Nearby there was a small pit containing 24 marine shells. (BCH 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001; Science vol. 304, 2004) An important EC metallurgical workshop has been excavated at Pyrgos-Mavrorachi by the Missione Archeologica di Pyrgos- Cipro, Rome, directed by Dr Maria Rosaria Belgioro. The area of the workshop is extensive, covering some 300m2. Small channels were cut to a nearby stream to bring in water to wash the copper ore. Stone tools were used to crush the ore and sep- arate out the minerals. Bases of several circular furnaces sur- vive. These were stone built and lined with a layer of white clay. There was also one figure-of-eight furnace, made from two shallow pits, one of which was plastered with fine clay. Finds at the site include crucibles, small fragments of slag and stone tools. The excavators interpret the site as a workshop involved in all aspects of copper production, working copper sulphide ores. (BCH 2000; RDAC 2000) LARNACA DISTRICT A late Hel-Rom monumental building was discovered in 1996 at Aradippou-Panagia Ematousa in the N part of the site, dur- ing excavations by the University of Copenhagen directed by L.W. Sorensen. This was further explored in 1997 and walls belonging to an earlier construction were identified; these were larger and the associated pottery suggests a CA date. Small quantities of Hel bronze coins and a single silver coin were found in this zone, and a bronze jug. Two stone vats were found in the S part of the site in 1996. Further excavation in 1997 revealed this to be a storage and workshop area divided into small narrow rooms. Finds include numerous fragments of large stone basins. To the N of these rooms there was a well-pre- served wall running E-W, beyond which lay an open area. The 1997 season therefore confirmed that the site was occupied between the CA and the Rom periods and that it had two main architectural phases. Possibly the CA remains belong to a palace structure, although this needs to be established through further excavation. These remains are covered by a Hel and Rom period settlement. In 1998 exploration concentrated in the N part of the main excavation area and on the S slopes of the hill. Rubble walls delimiting small storage rooms were uncovered in the NW sec- tor. The associated pottery dates to the CC period. In the NE sector the archaeologists uncovered a pit divided into two by a wall some 1.5m high and containing Hel-Rom pottery. A sec- ond pit was excavated a short distance to the W. This was filled with animal bones, stones and sherds; the pottery from its lower levels dated to the 2nd Ct BC. The excavators believe that this material is related to the subterranean rooms uncovered during previous seasons, possibly storerooms. The remains on the S slopes of the hill are well preserved. These comprise ashlar walls covered with plaster and date to the Hel and early Rom period. One room had a coarse mortar floor. A large number of stone tools suggest that this room was a workshop. Ten bronze coins were also found in the 1998 season, dat- ing from CC to Byz. These illustrate commercial and political contacts with other centres on the island, most notably Kition and Idalion. There is evidence for agricultural production at the site and it appears to have achieved a certain modest level of prosperity, illustrated by the discovery of metal artefacts and ceramic imports from various places throughout the Mediterranean. (BCH 1998, 1999) Work has continued at the site of Athienou-Malloura under the direction of Michael Toumazou (Davidson College). In 1999 excavations focused on the remains of the CA-Rom rural sanc- tuary. In the E part of the sanctuary exploration continued beneath the late 4th Ct BC floor down to bedrock, however, no architectural remains associated with an earlier use of the sanc- tuary were uncovered. Notable finds include several sheep scapulae incised with cypro-syllabic signs and a terracotta female figurine. Previously the only figures recovered from the sanctuary had been male stone sculptures. In the W part of the sanctuary the foundations of a large peribolos were found were uncovered on an E-W orientation. The large number of finds from this area includes a complete CA limestone statue of a male wearing a conical cap, which dates to the 6th Ct BC. New trial trenches were opened to identify the W limits of the sanc- tuary. Although a large number of pits obscured the SW comer of the sanctuary, a compact layer of debris was uncovered. Stratified material from this layer, including coins of Alexander, dates it to the Hel period. In 1998 and 1999 a wall running NE-SW was uncovered, possibly belonging to a covered struc- ture. In 1999 the finds included fragmentary limestone statues of CA and CC date, several more terracotta figurines, pottery, lamps and six coins. (BCH 1999, 2000) A final season of excavation was completed at the LC urban centre of Kalavasos-Agios Dimitrios in 1997, directed by A. South and I. Todd. Work concentrated at the N limits of the site, in the area around building X, where a number of smaller archi- tectural units, apparently associated with agro-industrial activi- ties have been identified. Work in this area has concentrated on uncovering earlier deposits, possibly dating to LC IIB, 14th Ct BC. A number of wealthy tombs had been excavated beneath the N-S road running along the W side of building X. Most recently excavated is tomb 21. This had been emptied in antiqui- ty and pottery ranging in date from IA to Rom was found in the upper fill of a pit cut over the tomb chamber. A group of nearly intact vases was found in a heap in the depression cut in the chamber floor, together with the crumpled gold diadem and gold mouth pieces. There was also a smash of sherds by the stomion and S wall of the chamber. A large number of vessels were restored from this smash, including two pictorial Myc kraters (Fig. 15), nine large brjugs, two rl flasks and two small pithoi. Excavations continued in building XIV, to the NW of build- ing X, confirming that this building had several phases. A bowl and three bronze blades were found in a collapsed wall to the W</page><page sequence="12">104 LOUISE STEEL 15 Kalavasos-Ayios Dhimitrios: Mycenaean chariot krater of building X. Work continued on building XII, immediately to the S of building X, uncovering its SE comer. It appears that this structure measured at least 14 x 24m and its external walls were constructed from ashlar blocks, which however had been mostly robbed out in the LRom period. Soundings were also excavated in the zone between the NE area and the Limassol- Nicosia highway. Small ashlar blocks were found here, illustrat- ing that the elite administrative zone continued further south than had previously been thought. The N-S road also continues in this area, with a well-built stone drain. The extant architecture in this zone dates to the 13th Ct BC, contemporary with the lat- est occupation elsewhere on the site. (RDAC 1997; BCH 1998) In 2002 the University of East Anglia began excavations at the ceramic Neo and Chal sites of Kalavasos-Kokkinoyia and Pamboules. At Kokkinoyia excavations revealed a concentra- tion of ten subterranean features along the edge of the ridge (Fig. 16). Seven of these were pits placed no more than 2m apart. Two bell-shaped pits measured approximately 1.5-2m di.. The other pits were much smaller (no more than im di.), and were straight-sided or sloped inwards towards the base. Very little cultural material was found in the pits. In the fill of F19 there were a number of rounded river cobbles and frag- ments of Neo rmp, comprising spouted bowls and globular bot- tles. River pebbles and ground stone tools were found in the fill of F77. Two diabase hammerstones and a diabase pestle were found in F90, amongst a number of unworked river pebbles. There were other subterranean features of a completely differ- ent nature, comprising a series of interconnected underground chambers, tunnels, and subterranean pits within underground chambers. Two chambers (F66 and F70) were connected by a tunnel. A blocking stone was found by the entrance into F70. The only material found in situ in F70 was an intact cbw bottle placed in a cbw spouted bowl (Fig. 17). Beneath the bowl were levelling stones. Neither the pits nor the subterranean chambers and tunnels contained any human or animal bones, nor any palaeobotanical remains. Pottery from the site belongs to the Neo/Chal tradition. Most pits contain Neo pottery but small quantities of the gbw in F19 might suggest some overlap into EChal. At Pamboules two soundings were excavated in 2003, in an area where Stanley Price and Todd had identified pits and depressions and where the Vasilikos Valley Project had collected considerable quantities of Chal pottery and stone tools in 1976-78. In one sounding a wide cobble wall or platform was located, the first true upstanding architecture to be identified at 17 Kalavasos-Kokkinoyia: Combed ware bowl and bottle 16 Kalavasos-Kokkinoyia: site</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN CYPRUS 1997-2002 105 the site. The extension of trench exposed a complex construction (Fig. 18). Cobble-built walls enclosed a thick plaster surface. In the SE comer of the struc- ture there was a rubble platform. A thin earth surface was identified to the N of the structure. A number of objects lying on the surface included a hammer- stone, chisel, pounders and rubbing stones, and large quantities of LChal pottery. A large straight- sided pit cut into the natural havara was identified in the NW comer of the sounding. It is presently assumed that the pit predates the structure and is sealed by an outdoor, tamped surface. In the other sounding a small rectilinear stone-built feature was delineated. This appears to have been roughly con- :: - structed on field soil, some 20cm above the natural havara. A quantity of human bone was found in the ; area of this feature but not in direct association. Alain le Brun has continued work at Khirokitia- Vounoi. In 1997 excavations concentrated on the summit of the hill. The area S of the entrance into the Neo vil- lage was explored, in particular the accumulation of debris out- side the enclosure wall. A large expanse of the wall collapsed at the end of level III and was not immediately rebuilt. At the same time that the wall was breached the entrance into the village was modified. The later entrance was covered with successive lay- ers of earth to form a vast cone, the top of which coincided with the earlier entranceway into the settlement. The sides of the mound were used as ramps. To the S the layers of ashy earth sealed numerous fragments of animal bones, indicating that this area was used as a rubbish dump outside the main habitation area. In 2000 the excavations defined the later part of the strati- graphic sequence in the E sector, contemporary with the expan- sion of the settlement into the W sector. Three architectural phases were established for level A and it became apparent that the E sector was not totally abandoned in B1, but habitation continued in house S135. However, settlement in this area con- tracts and there is extensive evidence for pitting in level B1, presumably for dismantling of earlier houses and removal of building materials. An important house, S148, was excavated in the W sector. This was exceptionally large and well built. Internal features include a platform hearth, a bench and traces of badly preserved green paint (celadonite) on the walls. Finds include three stone bowls, antler and scapula of fallow deer and a sheep/goat scapula. A new area was also opened at the foot of the hill in 1997. The remains of several structures were uncovered with well- built walls. There is particularly abundant use of the readily available mud from the riverbed and large stones in these con- structions. Finds include large numbers of high quality lime- stone bowls. The stratigraphy of this area was refined in 1998. An abandonment layer separated the main architectural level from an earlier level. A cut in the riverbed illustrates early occu- pation at Khirokitia on a flood plain. (BCH 1998, 1999, 2001) Excavations by a French team directed by M. Yon have contin- ued at Kition-Bamboula. In 1997 the N part of the ship-sheds were excavated, to try to establish the existence of a seventh row of pillars for supporting the roof. Soundings uncovered a thick, homogenous deposit of Rom pottery, including Eastern Sigillata, Samian and Coan amphoras and Egyptian amphoras. Beneath this the excavations reached a Hel beach lying directly on the substrata, with no trace of earlier CC buildings. In 1998 excavations confirmed a seventh row of pillars. This is the fur- thest extent of the hangars into the port basin and the N-S length of the ship-sheds was established at around 37m. The 18 Kalavasos-Pamboules: structure ship-sheds are paralleled by those at Piraeus, suggesting that they were constructed to shelter triremes. They comprise six bays with ramps; the length of the bays has been established at around 40m. The hangars were roofed and numerous examples of CC tiles have been recovered. The chronology of the various phases of use of the building has still to be established, but three phases of use have been identified. The earliest construction appears to date to the end of the 5th Ct BC, with the main peri- od of use dating to the 4th Ct. Cistern 784, to the W of the ship sheds was completely exca- vated in 1997, to a depth of 4.35m. In the upper fill there was Rom pottery, but the lower fill was sterile, except for occasional amphora sherds. Also excavated in 1997 were some workshops to the W of the port (locus 795). These comprise a series of cir- cular and rectangular basins separated by low sandstone partition walls. The associated floor level did not survive. The fill beneath the surface layer contained mixed CG-Hel material, but the level of the workshops suggests a CC-Hel date. In 1998 remains of an earlier structure were excavated beneath the workshops. Rubble- built walls enclosed a small square room, dated by the associat- ed pottery to the CG III period. (BCH 1998, 1999, 2000) The Larnaca Hinterland Project, directed by A. Leonard Jr (University of Arizona) was set up in 1997 to examine LBA set- tlement in the region around Larnaca through field survey. Two survey seasons were completed in 1997 and 1998, in the areas around Klavdia and Arpera. One of the aims was to relocate the associated wealthy cemeteries excavated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries at the two locales. In 1997 The site of Klavdia-Tremitios was relocated and field-walking around Arpera identified a LC tomb cut into the cliff below the chapel of Agios Andronikos, from which a mix of human bone and fragmentary LBA pottery (ws, br, mono and myc) were recov- ered. A scatter of LC pottery, predominantly pithos, was found in the fields to the E, to be identified with the LC settlement of Arpera. Also a considerable quantity of copper slag was col- lected on the surface near a recently dug utility trench. A series of EC-MC tombs was visible in a bulldozer cut near the road to Tersefanou. Further work at Arpera in 1998 identified several deposits of MC pottery on the slopes of the Agios Andronikos hill, largely rp but with some wp. Nine soundings were dug to explore the possibility of a metal-working establishment at Arpera, and possible LC architecture was uncovered in site 2, although excavation did not continue as far as the activity surfaces. (RDAC 2000)</page><page sequence="14">106 LOUISE STEEL 19 Paphos: Roman theatre Two EC tombs were discovered at Maroni-Maraes in 2000. T. 1/2000 was a small oval-shaped pit and contained 18 rp vessels (bowls, jugs and two basins) lying in situ on the floor. The skeletal remains were very poorly preserved. The second tomb (T. 2/2000) hard been largely destroyed by bulldozer and only fragments from two rp vessels were recovered. (RDAC 2001) Pavlos Flourentzos (Department of Antiquities) continued exca- vating a ceramic Neo settlement at Paralimni-Nissia. The horseshoe-shaped enclosure wall was entirely uncovered in 1998, and extends for 83m. The only break in the wall was by the sea, where large rocks form a natural defence. The S seg- ment is pierced by a large central gateway, 2.2m w. in the first phase, but made smaller in a subsequent phase of use. Outside the enclosure wall are several houses, which are less well con- structed than those inside the perimeter wall. Broken vessels were found on the floors. Abundant finds includes stone and bone tools, stone vessels, antlers and two anthropomorphic stone figurines. The final campaign was in 2000. In total 28 houses have been excavated at the site. Three floor levels have been identified in house 5. (BCH 1999, 2001). A number of intact rp vessels lying on the surface were found at Psematismenos-Trelloukas in 1999. These were in situ in a tomb, the upper part of which had been removed by bulldozing. It is a small oval chamber tomb or pit grave of EC date. A small number of rp vessels and a single whetstone were recovered, along with disturbed skeletal remains. (RDAC 2000) In 1997 Maria Hadjicosti completed a second season of exca- vations at the ECh site of Pyla-Koutsopetria. Work focused on a basilica and its annex buildings, apparently destroyed in an earthquake. A deposit 70cm thick was removed from the NW comer of room 1 of the annex building. A layer of ash contain- ing bronze coins sealed large pieces of gypsum and a floor of hydraulic plaster. A circular pit contained a spouted terracotta container and strainer and several amphora necks. In front of the W entrance to room 1 a N-S corridor was excavated down to the floor. This was destroyed but had apparently been dressed with gypsum. A second corridor or courtyard was excavated to the S of room 1, which also had a floor of dressed gypsum. Large pieces of hydraulic plaster and architectural elements, including an arch, appear to have fallen down from the first storey. Finds from the annex building include bronze coins of the early 7th Ct AD and a capital with plant decoration. The basilica is located 40m to the NE. The S part of the apse of the central nave was excavated. Outside the floor was of dressed gypsum, but inside the floor had been destroyed by ploughing. Nonetheless, fragments of marble indicate that the basilica origi- nally had a floor of opus sectile. Painted plaster fragments and architectural elements attest to an important ECh basilica. (BCH 2000) PAPHOS DISTRICT In December 1999 a number of Hel rock-cut tombs were found during road works at Kato Paphos and excavated by the Department of Antiquities. Five tombs were found in the vicinity of Ammoi, fur- nished with quantities of undecorated pottery, including amphoras and unguentaria, two bronze mirrors, a bronze earring and gold leaf from a dia- dem. Two other tombs were excavated in Agios Antonios street. The first of these tombs had two niches, in one of which were found two burials in situ, each with a coin on the chest. A female burial was uncovered in the second tomb, in a wooden sarcophagus. Next to the skeleton there was a bronze mirror and a large number of glass and ceramic unguentaria. (BCH 2000) Nine Hel to early Rom tombs were excavated at Vassiliko in 2000. These were typical funerary facilities of the period and were furnished with the usual range of ceramics, unguentaria and amphoras, including Rhodian imports. A Hel-Rom rock-cut tomb was also uncovered at Kosti Palama Square. This com- prised a rectangular central atrium opening N onto a large rec- tangular room, the walls and ceilings of which were painted with plant motifs. The rocky wall of the atrium, directly oppo- site the entrance to the chamber, had a vaulted opening. Here a stairway, which was not fully excavated, led into the atrium. Two rectangular loculi were cut into the wall on either side of the stairway, as well as a small square chamber. The chamber had four loculi, the walls of which were covered with painted plaster. Several burials were found in each loculus; one in situ and the bones from earlier burials pushed into the comers. The grave goods comprise terracotta and glass unguentaria and bronze toiletry articles (strigils, mirrors etc.). A cremation bur- ial was found in a small niche in the centre of the N wall, placed in a cooking pot. (BCH 2001). Excavations have continued at the theatre of Kato Paphos, (Fig. 19) directed by J.B. Green of the University of Sydney. The theatre is oriented towards the SW in the direction of the port. From its establishment c.300 BC the plan of the orchestra was semi-circular, possibly the earliest such example. Several architectural features appear to have affinities with Alexandria. In 1996 excavations S of the theatre had uncovered later Rom and ECh remains. A massive stone wall built from re-used Hel and Rom cut stone blocks was uncovered at a depth of 1m below the modem surface. It is estimated that the wall originally stood to a height of at least 5m. These ruins covered a layer in which a carefully paved E-W road was found. The surface of the road was rather worn. A large gutter was cut carefully into the natural rock along the southern edge of this road, into which smaller channels ran. Large quantities of pottery and several coins were found above and below the surface of the road and in the channels, which should help clarify the ceramic chronol- ogy for the 3rd-4th Ct AD. Limited clearing in the E part of the cavea in 1998 uncov- ered a complex built over the destruction layer associated with the earthquake of the 4th Ct AD. The finds included a coin of</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN CYPRUS 1997-2002 107 Constantine IV (AD 668-685). There is increasing evidence for occupation at the time of the Arab invasions (AD 643-688) in the form of coins and inscribed pottery. In 1999 work concentrated on the cavea, the NW part of the orchestra, the interior and behind the building of the skene. Remains of Med installations were found in all areas, dating to between the 12th and 16th Ct AD. Excavations in the orchestra have clarified the sequence of the construction and destruction phases. The seating for the dignitaries, which had been moved during the Rom period, when the orchestra had been modified for putting on nautical spectacles, was also identified. A large wall built of rubble was uncovered behind the Rom skene, prob- ably the foundation of the Rom proskenion. It appears that the theatre, which was first built during the Hel period, was remod- elled on several occasions, possibly at the end of the Hel period and probably at the time of Augustus. The main remodelling phase, however, dates to the period of Hadrian and Antonius. The proskenion was dressed in marble, the orchestra was taken up and re-covered in slabs of polychrome marble. Behind the proskenion there were terracotta pipes, which apparently joined lead pipes (forming a sprinkling system capable of raising water to a height of at least 4 feet). At a later date a wall was built around the orchestra, possibly to protect spectators during glad- iatorial combat or displays involving animals. The orchestra was cleared of its marble revetment and instead was given a coating of hydraulic plaster. At the same time a number of piers were put up at 5m intervals. In 2002 an inscription was discov- ered on the marble threshold block at the entrance to the orches- tra. This had been placed face down when the containment wall around the orchestra was built in the mid-3rd Ct AD. It appears that this is part of an inscription that had been uncovered at Kato Paphos many years previously (SEG VI, 812; SEG XX, 252; AJA 65 1961, 105, no. 49). The theatre fell out of use following the earthquake of AD 365/370. Subsequently it began to be dismantled - tool marks from these operations are visible on displaced blocks of stone. This continued until around AD 600, when the theatre appears to have been used on a small scale until the Arab raids in AD 688, when the site was abandoned until the late 12th Ct AD. There were shops and a glass workshop behind the skene, and during the Med period the area housed a workshop for the pro- duction of glazed pottery. (BCH 1998; BCH 1999; BCH 2000; RDAC 2002; J.R. Green 'The theatre of Paphos and the theatre of Alexandria: some first thoughts', in The Library of Alexan- dria. Centre of Learning in the Ancient World, 2000, 115-26) In 1997 Claire Balandier made a small trial sounding in the W rampart of the town wall at Kato Paphos and cleaned a trench that had been accidentally cut across this wall. The cur- tain wall was uncovered down to its foundations (3.5m below the modem road surface). The upper part of the wall was built of coarsely cut stone blocks laid in roughly regular courses, with earth used to plug up the large gaps. Smaller stone blocks were used in the lower courses, and small stones and sherds were used to fill in the gaps. The pottery found in the different stone courses was remarkably homogenous. It essentially com- prises Hel material with a large number of Eastern Sigillata A sherds, indicating that the town of Paphos was protected by a city wall from the end of the 3rd or beginning of the 2nd Ct BC. It appears that the wall was subsequently abandoned and possi- bly destroyed, although the date of this episode is unclear, given the mixed stratigraphy of the upper levels. Later the wall was made larger. Although the dating is uncertain, it is noteworthy that this area continued to be protected by a wall, although it is frequently asserted that it was abandoned during the Rom peri- od and that occupation moves towards the E of the town in later antiquity. (BCH 1998; RDAC 1999) 20 Kissonerga-Mylouthkia: Neo well 116 The Instituto de Archeologica, Catania, has continued work at Kato Paphos-Toumballos, directed by Prof. Filippo Giudice, in the area of the sanctuary of Apollo and the so-called Garrion's Camp. Beneath the martyrium - an ECh building immediately W of the Hel-Rom subterranean sanctuary - excavations revealed elements of a pagan sanctuary. Several houses were excavated in the Ch quarter. A large fountain was re-used in the Med period, illustrated by a system of drains overlying the ECh levels. In the southern area of the houses some fine mosaics were uncovered. The Hel-Rom dromos leading to the sanctuary was further explored. This is oriented E-W for 72m, at which point it turns S and becomes subterranean. Two floor levels sep- arated by a destruction layer were identified in 1998. Subterranean openings leading into a large rock-cut chambers were explored in 1998 and 1999. (BCH 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001) An EC cemetery was discovered at Kissonerga-Choiromantres during levelling activity, and was excavated by the Department of Antiquities in 2000. Nineteen tombs were uncovered, which had unfortunately been partially damaged; they were small sub- circular or ellipsoidal rock-cut chambers approached by a small entrance dromos. The pottery recovered from the tombs was bp and rp and coarse ware, in a wide variety of forms. There was also a quantity of items of personal adornment, such as stone beads, picrolite amulets, bronze earrings, and a single bronze spear-head with traces of the wooden haft and two whetstones. (BCH 2001) Important early Neo remains have been excavated at Kissonerga- Mylouthkia by a team from the University of Edinburgh. Three wells dating to the earliest identified phase of the aceramic Neo were excavated between 1994 and 1996 (Fig. 20). Well 116 was notable for the large quantities of obsidian recovered, unusual in the Cypriot Neo. Human remains were found in well 133 associated with articulated goat skeletons. AMS dates from the wells place activity at the site to the mid-late 9th millennium</page><page sequence="16">108 LOUISE STEEL BC. Together with the excavations at Parekklisha-Shillouro- kambos these remains have necessitated a reassessment of the earliest Neo occupation of the island, pushing it back to a period contemporary with domestication on the mainland. Excavations also uncovered EChal buildings at Mylouthkia. AMS dating of period 2 dates it to the mid 4th millennium BC. The architectural remains are ephemeral, as is typical of this period. These are replaced in period 3 by stone-based circular structures more typical of the Cypriot Chal period. Most recent- ly some Chal burials have been identified at the site. (E. Peltenburg 2003, The Colonisation and Settlement of Cyprus: Investigations at Kissonerga Mylouthkia 1976-1996, SIMA 70.4; E. Peltenburg et al. 2000, 'Agropastoralist colonisation of Cyprus in the 10th millennium BP: initial assessments', Antiquity 74, 844-853; E. Peltenburg et al. 2001, 'Neolithic dispersals from the Levantine corridor: a Medierranean per- spective', Levant 33, 35-64.) A Med ceramic production centre has been investigated at Lemba by a Greek mission, directed by Chr. Bakirtzis. Evidence comprises abundant quantities of pottery of the 13th and 14th Ct AD and many wasters. For the most part the pottery is glazed; wares include various forms ofsgraffito and also Slip Painted pottery. Other undecorated pottery was for storage and cooking. Dense Med occupation in the area is illustrated by walls and plastered floors. A later house was also identified. The interior walls are plastered. Finds include nails from leather shoes, terracotta pipes and loomweights. (BCH 1998, 1999) The remains of a house were uncovered at Kouklia-Alonia in 2000, to the S of the sanctuary of Aphrodite. These comprise several rooms opening off an atrium. In the S there was a store- room which contained pithoi and Cypriot and Phoenician amphora. The floors were covered with a thick destruction layer and traces of burning. Material from the house dates it to the 5th-th Ct BC. (BCH 2001) The 31st excavation season at Kouklia-Palaipaphos was completed in 1997 by Franz Maier. A small excavation was con- ducted in the N room of the sanctuary of Aphrodite to clarify problems with its stratigraphy and construction. In particular the pillar generally accepted as the SW comer of the portico was in fact shown to be placed there in the 18th or 19th Ct AD. (BCH 1998) A CG-CA cemetery was discovered in 1999 at Kouklia- Plakes, 1.5km SW of Kouklia. In total seven rock-cut chamber tombs were excavated. Unusual architectural features include a low bench in the chamber of T. 145, a small court laid out in front of the entrance to the chamber of T. 146 and a rubble- blocked niche in T. 143. The orientation of the tombs appears to have been dictated by the topography of the burial ground. The tombs contained pottery dating from the 11th Ct BC (including some pwp) to the CA period (bor and free field style) and there is some evidence for continued use of the cemetery into the Hel period. Most burials are inhumations but there is one cremation placed in a bronze amphora. Grave goods include large quanti- ties of local pottery, Phoenician ceramic imports (jugs, globular flasks and storage jars), and some egyptianising scarabs. Of particular interest is the wide range of metal artefacts: bronze vases, tripods and obeloi, bronze and iron weapons, and gold jewellery, most notable being embossed gold plaques. Other finds include a faience ring inscribed with hieroglyphs, a lime- stone bathtub, and a clay bathtub sunk into the floor of T. 144. (E. Raptou, 'Nouveaux temoinages sur Palaepaphos a l'epoque geometrique, d'apres les fouilles de Kouklia-Plakes', in Cahier du Centre d'Etudes Chypriotes 32, 2002, 115-33. See also report in BCH 2000, 690-2) An IA sanctuary deposit has been identified at Kato Savanakia, in the quarries to the N of Kouklia, and was exca- vated in 2000. The sanctuary deposits are cut into the havara bedrock. To the N they are delimited by a stone wall and on the E side by the havara. Large quantities of terracotta figurines and sherds were found, ranging in date from CG to CC, but mainly dating to the CA period. The figurines are mainly hand- made and anthropomorphic, but there are some moulded figures and also rare examples of animals. The predominant type is the so-called goddess with upraised arms. (BCH 2001) A Greek team, directed by Ch. Bakirtzis, has continued excava- tions at Pegia-Agios Georgios. In 1997 a Rom building was uncovered to the W of basilica A, and adjoining a second build- ing to the N. This comprises a series of rooms built around the three sides of a court. The floor level of the court and sur- rounding rooms were raised during the ECh period, a second storey was added and two staircases were built in the courtyard. Several architectural alterations indicate a third phase of use of the building. A workshop was excavated in the S wing of the building. Four worked blocks of poros formed a bench its SE comer, on top of which there was a stone mortar. There was ash round the bench and in the SW corer there was a stone basin connected to a drainage channel. There is a series of rooms to the E, probably the episkopeion or presbyterion. Work on the episkopeion continued in 1998. In the NW comer the excavators uncovered an open passageway leading from the interior court to an open area S of the building. In this passageway they found remains of a small arch (1.75m h.) lean- ing against the N and S walls of the building, which appears to have supported the ceiling. The walls of the episkopeion were built over various earlier rock-cut structures, such as cisterns and tombs. A room was uncovered S of the passageway, with a deposit im thick sealing its collapsed N wall. The layer above the floor was therefore sealed and intact. Elsewhere, however, the habitation deposits were disturbed by later robbing trench- es. A fine layer of ash covered the collapsed stone, attesting to a later reoccupation period, presumably by the people who robbed out the stone walls. The walls were built using different construction techniques of various periods. The implication is that the ECh building simply re-used earlier structural remains as and when appropriate. The N part of Court I was also uncovered. Here a later, rein- forcement wall was built against the N wall of the episkopeion. The first three steps of two staircases leading to the first floor were also identified. It appears that the first floor of the build- ing was destroyed in an earthquake at the end of the ECh peri- od, however the settlement continued to be occupied. Rubble cleared from various rooms was deposited in the court, thereby raising its floor level. The building continued to function but without the first floor and with new roofing in places. The court remained open for a long period, but was not well drained and so the clay surface became very smooth as a result of the stag- nation of rainwater. A layer of ash was uncovered in a room in the SW comer of the building. Here the excavators found numerous glass lamps and a badly burnt lead bulla, suggesting this room to be the location of the archives. A court to the S of the building and by the E wing communicated with a series of storerooms along the W wall of basilica A. In 2000 work concentrated on the annexes of basilica F. Quantities of pottery, fragments of small lamps and various other small objects were found in a room to the E of the basili- ca, together with a marble altar. Some broken glass lamps were also found placed carefully in the N wall. Excavation continued in two workshops for pressing oil, which had been partially excavated in 1994. These were added onto the N wall of the</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN CYPRUS 1997-2002 109 basilica in the post-Justinianic period. In one room the floor was covered by carefully laid worked stones. Here the excavators noted traces of an earlier E wall, which had been destroyed to allow the extension of the room towards the E. The S wall was shown to predate the construction of the workshop and belonged to the complex of annex buildings. In the NE comer of the workshop there was a square hearth. A rubbish pit was located in an uncovered area outside the NE corer of the work- shop. This was filled with ash and rich domestic debris from the workshop and neighbouring rooms; transport amphoras, cook- ing pots (but little table ware), shells and animal bones, iron nails, bronze utensils, lead objects, glass lamps and a two coins (dedecanoummion of Heraclius, AD 613-618; follies of the house of Constantine minted in AD 641-645). (BCH 1998, 1999, 2001) A typical Hel tomb, comprising a rectangular rock-cut chamber and eight loculi, was discovered at Pegia in 2001. Skeletal remains were very fragmentary but eleven individuals have been identified: infants, immature individuals and mature adults. Grave goods include large quantities of pottery (cooking pots, jugs, bowls unguentaria, five imported Rhodian amphoras), two gilded bronze funerary wreaths, a few pieces of gold and silver jewellery and many glass beads. Three sar- cophagi were recovered. (RDAC 2002) An elaborate Hel-Rom rock-cut chamber tomb was excavated at Polis Chrysochous-Ambeli toun Englezou in 1997. This was approached via a stepped dromos and was equipped with four secondary chambers and five loculi. A loculus was cut into the dromos wall in front of the entrance to the main chamber, and partially paved with stone slabs. There was also an ossuary cut into the N wall of the main chamber, containing burnt bones. The tomb had been used for multiple inhumations. Some burials had been laid out on wooden biers, traces of which sur- vived. Grave goods typical of the Hel and Rom periods included pottery, bronze and glass object, gold and silver jewellery and coins of bronze and silver. The University of Princeton has continued work at Polis Chrysochous. A basilica used between the 6th and 14th Ct AD has been excavated. This lies over a building of the 4th Ct AD, the nature of which is unclear, but a mosaic floor has been uncovered. Along the S wall of the 6th Ct basilica there was a series of five stone-built pits, which contained coins, lamps and fibulae. The church collapsed in an earthquake in the 14th or 15th Ct. A portico building (Fig. 21, after T. Najbjerg, C. Nicklies, A. Papalexandrou, 2002 'Princeton University Excavations at Polis/Arsinoe: preliminary report on the Roman and Medieval levels', RDAC 2002, fig. 3), measuring 11 x 9m, was uncovered beneath the church. This was built in the 1St Ct BC and used until the 2nd Ct AD. It has a hydraulic cement floor and in the SW corer there was a cistern, at least 6m deep. In the layers between the Rom building and the later church there were two large structures, measuring 10 x 8m and with walls 1.8m thick. These possibly belong to the NE part of the Rom ramparts of the town of Arsinoe. CA-CC levels have also been identified, including a large N-S wall, 1.5m thick, to the W of the Rom building. Some of the stone blocks of this wall are inscribed with cypro-syllabic signs. (BCH 1998, RDAC 2002) Since 1997 the Department of Antiquities and the University of Indianapolis have been surveying the Rantidi Forest in an area that is currently under development. More than 19 sites, rang- ing in date from the Chal period to the late 19th Ct AD have been identified. Two seasons of excavations of a sanctuary at</page><page sequence="18">110 LOUISE STEEL 22 Souskiou-Laona: View of Chal cemetery Lingrin tou Diyeni (originally excavated in 1910) have been completed. Various architectural features were uncovered; a small building to the E of the site, a largefavissa 1.3m deep and a series of rock-cut chambers, possibly associated with a chthonic cult of Adonis. The pottery found in the sanctuary dates its use to between the 6th Ct BC and the Hel period. A large number of CA figurines (of the so-called snowman type) were also recovered. Excavations have added significantly to the corpus of inscriptions known from the site. A rescue excavation at Vrysi tou Rantidiou in 2000-2001 uncovered the remains of a Hel complex associated with large- scale production of olive oil. This comprises a building with several small rooms, measuring 16 x 7m in total. The stone walls were built directly onto the natural rock. The building had large cement-lined cisterns and sunken pithoi. Finds included a variety of different ceramic types: pithoi, amphoras, cooking pots and one relief decorated lamp. Some BA sherds indicate earlier occupation in the vicinity and sgraffito ware attests to Med occupation. Intact water pipes (either of Hel of Med date) were found in situ in the slopes below. Several important PR sites have been systematically sur- veyed. A chert quarry was identified at Katakomorotsos, used in the ceramic Neo or the Chal period. Two other occurrences of chipped stone appear to represent primary knapping areas. A ceramic Neo site was identified at Vrysi tou Rantidiou, to the W of the Hel site. The material collected at the site suggests that it was a temporary encampment. Chal material was also identi- fied at Asprokremnos, comprising pottery, chipped stone and ground stone. On the summit of the hill there was a series of cir- cular or oval rubble-built cairs, possibly the remains of tem- porary structures. Several cavities cut into the bedrock might be ancient quarries, from which igneous cobbles were extracted, used in the manufacture of the plentiful ground stone tools iden- tified at the site. (BCH 1999, 2001; RDAC 2000) The Lemba Archaeological Research Centre of the University of Edinburgh carried out three seasons of excavations at the MChal site of Souskiou-Laona between 2001-2003; a fourth season is planned for 2004. The site comprises a settlement, investigated in 1992 (BCH 1993, 730-2), and a cemetery located on a prominent limestone outcrop. The Laona outcrop rises above the ridge to a height of 1-3 m and measures approxi- mately 25m E-W and 40m N-S. A total of 115 tombs have been excavated to date. These are cut closely together and often encroach upon their neighbours (Fig. 22). The majority of the tombs are looted but some intact tombs and burials have been recovered. There are various tomb types but deep sub-rectangular shafts with expanded oval-shaped bases are most common; these might have an oval cut to receive arrangements of cap- stones. The majority of tombs are re-used and earlier burials (of up to five individuals) had been displaced to the northern end of the tomb, along with associated grave goods. Burials represent- ing final use of the tomb were subsequently inserted in a crouched position. In addition, several unsealed, shallow scoop- shaped features with oval apertures have yielded finds and appear to be intact. The extremely limited skeletal material recovered in this type may due to poor preservation, their use for infant inhumations, or they may have served another func- tion associated with mortuary ritual. Grave goods recovered, from tombs as well as looters' spoil heaps, include rw pottery, picrolite pendants, dentalium shell beads, a large picrolite fig- urine (Fig. 23), chipped stone tools, faience beads and a single example of a copper spiral hair ring.

Spanou, 'Contexts for cruciforms: figurines of prehistoric Cyprus', Antiquity 76, 2002, 21-2) Excavations have also been carried out at the nearby Chal cemetery of Souskiou-Vathyrkakas, directed by Demos Christou (Department of Antiquities) and Evi Baxevani. Athough the cemetery had been looted in antiquity there were a number of interesting discoveries. Finds included two cruciform 0 2?m 23 Souskiou-Laona: detail of picrolite figurine</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY IN CYPRUS 1997-2002 111 picrolite figurines, a unique terracotta figurine of a pregnant women, a vase in the form of a bunch of grapes and several other vessels in the rw ware. (BCH 1998) In 1999 a CC tomb was discovered at Trimithousa during building work and was excavated by the Department of Antiquities. It comprises a rock-cut rectangular chamber tomb with a niche and a subsidiary chamber on the south side. There were three rectangular earthen kline in the main chamber and a fourth in the side chamber, on which single adult inhumations were laid out. A fifth burial was laid out in the niche. Twelve ceramic vessels and a bronze strigil were found on the floor of the main chamber and ten ceramic vessels and a bronze strigil on the floor of the side chamber. The vessels include two Bichrome Red jugs, one with a bull protome and the other with a female figure holding a jug, a lamp, and several jugs and bowls in a variety of wares.

Three main periods of occupation have been identified, each separated by long periods of apparent abandonment. The earli- est occupation was in the EChal, and is illustrated by quantities of ground stone tools, chipped stone and pottery. The most sig- nificant period of occupation is the late Hel period, during the reign of Cleopatra VII of Egypt. The West building dates to this period of occupation (Fig. 24, after J.B. Connelly 2002, 'Excavations on Geronisos (1990-1997): first report', RDAC 2002, fig. 25). The excavator argues that the large number of decorative mouldings, the unusual (for Cyprus) tiled roof and the E-W orientation identify this as a temple structure. Distinctive finds from the site include a number of limestone amulets, which recall objects worn around the neck by the so- called 'temple-boy' statues. The SW complex is an imposing structure located by the entrance to the site. Large quantities of drinking cups and glass bowls were found in this complex, as were cooking pots and numerous animal bones, possibly the debris of feasting or sacrifice. In the W of the island there is a large quarry, dating to the Hel period. Following an earthquake in 17 BC the island was abandoned until the 6th Ct AD. This final phase of occupation is characterized by small-scale squat- ter occupation.
