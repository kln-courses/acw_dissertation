For all the art-press pub- licity it has been getting over the past decade, contemporary Realism is still a phenomenon largely unexplored in art tomes. Arthur seems intent on righting that wrong, and his two new books throw a sharp spotlight on fields of ar- tistic endeavor that have too long been in the critical shadows. Realism/ Photorealism is the catalogue to a fall 1980 exhibition organized by Arthur at the Philbrook Art Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and a highly interesting volume it is. Arthur takes up contemporary Realism with Fairfield Porter, telling us that "Porter is to Realism as Jackson Pollock is to Abstract Expressionism," and exploring Porter's work in concise prose that makes sense of the oeuvre in both critical and historical terms. An important point is raised by Arthur at the outset: that the Realism of the '50s and '60s was deeply influenced by Abstract Expressionism. Indeed, many of the Realists under discussion began as abstract painters - Alfred Leslie is a prime example, and Porter was among the first to write about de Kooning. Whatever their backgrounds, such Realists as Jane Freilicher and John But- ton were working long before the Photo- Real- ists came along in the early '70s. Here Arthur gives them their due, thus restoring to contem- porary art history artists whose work has all too often been overlooked in surveys of the past 20 years. After the discussion of Porter, Arthur moves on to take up the work of 15 Realists, among them Philip Pearlstein, George Nick, Janet Fish, Jack Beai, and Wayne Thiebaud. Then come the Photo- Realists, Richard Estes, Don Eddy, Ralph Goings, and James Valerio among them. Arthur distinguishes between "direct observation" Realism and "painting derived from photographic source material," thus creating two large, but serviceable, cate- gories of work. Although one might quibble with the inclusion of such as Lowell Nesbitt and Ben Schonzeit among the Photo-Real- ists - they seem more painterly - Arthur's dis- tinctions are generally sound, and it is certain- ly enlightening for the uninformed reader to be made aware of even these basic differences among the Realists. Probably because this catalogue includes a great many artists, Arthur has had to do fairly "short and sweet" summarizations of the lives and works of individuals. Still, he has man- aged to write a paragraph or two about each artist that is often stimulating, and almost al- ways on the critical mark. Alex Katz, we are told, "has brought to Realism the scale of ab- stract painting and the immediacy of recogni- tion typical of Pop art." Wayne Thiebaud 's works are "witty social comments, loaded with double-entendre." Stephen Posen 's art is a "collision of improbabilities," while William Beckman's landscapes "reflect transient light. ' ' As someone who has, in his own words, left "matters of polemics and aesthetics ... to other writers," Arthur has acquitted himself well of his responsibilities to individual artists and to the phenomenon of Realism in general. The designer of the catalogue - Douglas J. Butterworth - has done his bit, too, with excel- lent color reproductions and photographs (or paintings) of the artists themselves neatly ac- companying their biographies. Realism/ Photorealism is good, but Realist Drawings and Watercolors is better. Here no exhi- bition was involved, and, freed from the exi- gencies of cataloguing, Arthur's critical sensi- bilities are more on display. We may argue with his central thesis - "I believe that great art is inalienably anthropomorphic, and that the artist's visions and conceptions are per- ceived with greater strength and clarity when his or her art refers to the human situ- ation" - but this is a dynamic thesis nonethe- less, one that few art critics have dared to ex- press in the prevailing intellectual atmosphere of the past 20 years. Along these same lines, Arthur takes on formalist criticism on his first page - "Until humanist issues again dominate our critical consciousness, the basically formal- ist bent of contemporary criticism will continue to do injustice to post-modern art." Strong, even fighting words, these, but words that should be said. It is about time someone at- tempted an intelligent rationale for the Realist revival. After this provocative introduction, Arthur cites Fairfield Porter and Richard Diebenkorn as the two granddaddies of contemporary Realism, and proceeds, using drawings and watercolors as his artistic bases, to take up</page><page sequence="2">Jack Beai, Portrait of John Arthur ; charcoal on paper (25x19 in.), 1976.

This time out, more Realists are included, among them Alice Neel, David Hockney, Yvonne J acquette, Susan Shatter, and Martha Mayer Erlebacher. Although Ar- thur's reach is wider, his critical perceptions are more acute. Lowell Nesbitt is described as "one of the earliest Photo- Realists, but one who has always had more painterly inclin- ations," while Ben Schonzeit is seen as having "moved away from high-gloss, hard-core Photo- Realism. ..." Richard Haas emerges as an artist not so indebted to the Photo- Real- ists, but "closer to the anonymous graphic art- ists of the past who rendered bird's-eye views of cities, or to artists like John Taylor Arms and Samuel Chamberlain," which passage elabor- ates nicely on the rather simple "he chooses his subjects for their historic and esthetic rele- vance" of the Haas entry in Realism/ Photoreal- ism. And here Arthur once again displays his way with a critically descriptive phrase: Ann McCoy, he writes, "is like an Old Testament prophet with a proclivity for Jungian analysis." If one has any argument with these books, it is, perhaps, that Arthur has not classified and categorized his subjects enough - William Bailey as a metaphysical Realist, for instance, or Janet Fish as a Precisionist. And where are such longtime Realists as Robert Dash or Au- drey Flack? But perhaps classification and cat- egorization and all-inclusiveness were not his intentions. What we have in Realism/ Photoreal- ism and Realist Drawings and Watercolors are im- portant first efforts at drawing up compendi- ums of the recent American Realist movement in all its phases. "One can only surmise," writes Arthur in his conclusion to Realist Draw- ings and Watercolors, "that the decade to come will be extravagandy diverse and unpredicta- ble/' The decade past in Realism was pretty "diverse and unpredictable," too. John Arthur has done an admirable job of toting it all up. GERRIT HENRY</page></plain_text>
