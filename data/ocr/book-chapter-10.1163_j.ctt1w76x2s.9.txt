God Amun in a Coptic spell Whatever moment of an uttered expression one deals with, it will always  be determined by the real conditions of this act of utterance, and before  all else by the closest social situation. A verbal communication can  never be understood and explained outside of this link with the con- crete  situation. M. Bakhtin 1. God: Self and Other 1. Self The robin who thinks he owns our garden is hungry. She taps at the  window. “Listen, the robin wants to come in, he seeks our company,”  says my wife. “Yes she wants a bite of this or that” say I. And we are  happy: if even a robin loves us, this surely proves us to be nice people.  My problem, however, is that actually I know better since I read a few  books written by that terrifying race of scholars generally referred to  as behaviourists. There I learned that our interpretation of the robin’s  motives is a typical instance of ‘anthropomorphism’: “the ascription of  human mental experiences and motives to animals.”1 Even if all con- temporary students are aware these days that anthropomorphic think- ing has no place in a scientific study of animal behaviour2 and even if,  1 J. Asquith, The Inevitability and Utility of Anthropomorphism in Description of  Primate Behaviour, in: R. Harré &amp; V. Reynolds (edd.), The Meaning of Primate Signals  (Cambridge 1984) 138–176, espec. 138. 2 Nevertheless, time and again, under a more fashionable label of ‘cognitive ethol- ogy’, a new claim of conscious thinking in animals is being proposed as for instance  in the works by D.R. Griffin, including, among many others, Animal Thinking (Cam- bridge MA 1984). His new ‘evangelism’ is maliciously summarized by Kennedy 1992,  12: “if animals behaving in all those apparently intelligent ways were human, they  would probably (though not necessarily) be conscious.” N. Tinbergen, The Study of  Instinct (Oxford 1951) 5, took the view that it was idle either to claim or to deny the  </page> <page sequence="2"> 380 chapter five consequently, they are confident that their own use of anthropomor- phic language is purely metaphorical, yet as Kennedy 1992 compel- lingly argues, we could not abandon it even if we wished to. Besides, we do not wish  to. It is dinned into us culturally from earliest childhood. It has pre- sumably also been ‘pre-programmed’ into our hereditary make-up by  natural selection (. . . . . .) Hence, no matter how excellent and pure our  stated intentions may be, the words will unconsciously tend to make us  interpret animal behaviour in human terms.3 The only remaining safety valve is never to forget that “a monkey may  have abstract concepts, motives, beliefs and desires, but her mental  states are not accessible to her: she does not know what she knows.”4  And I hate the behaviourists for thus dis-romanticizing the endearing  motives of our robin. And kept it secret from my wife. Circa two thousand five hundred years ago Xenophanes (Fr. 15)  made his famous statement: If horses or oxen or lions had hands and could make drawings with their  hands and accomplish such works as men, horses would draw the figures  existence of subjective phenomena in animals, because we do not have evidence either  way. Cf. M.S. Dawkins, Animal Suffering. The Science of Animal Welfare (London  1980) 102: “No amount of measurements can tell us what animals are actually expe- riencing. Their private mental experiences, if they have them, remain inaccessible to  direct observation.” An additional complication is presented by Wittgenstein’s thesis:  “If a lion could speak, we would not be able to understand him.” 3 Kennedy 1992, 89, who himself argues: “In fact all students of animal behaviour  use our own mental processes as models to ‘explain’ the behaviour in terms of inten- tions.” At p. 24 f. he lists a number of statements by various ethologists and psycholo- gists of similar import, including the one quoted in the text above, and “Whether we  will or not we must be anthropomorphic in the notions we form of what takes place  in the mind of an animal.” Similarly, with respect to taxonomy, one might wonder:  “How could we think about how animals relate to one another except on the basis of  our own relationships?” (thus M. Douglas, The Pangolin Revisited: A New Approach  to Animal Symbolism, in: R. Willis (ed.), Signifying Animals: Human Meaning in the  Natural World (London – New York 1990) 33. Experiments described in an online  pre-publication of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 12 July 2010 show  that the tendency of ascribing anthropomorphic behaviour to animals (and robots  or gadgets) increases in proportion with their unpredictability, and hence may be  explained as satisfying the need for control.  4 D.L.

So at least one Greek, and not the least as  we have seen in Ch. III, agreed with modern behaviourists in a mag- nificent hyperbole.6 And he unconsciously provided the most decisive  illustration of the anthropomorphic trap by defining his own radically  transcendent, non-anthropomorphic god as follows: “As a whole he  sees, as a whole he thinks, and as a whole he hears.” These are all very  anthropoid qualities of an apparently male deity. In my words then: if by nature and nurture man cannot but project  anthropomorphic motives, affects and emotions onto animal behav- iour, although animals like our robin present themselves in very  unhuman appearances, how infinitely more natural, self-evident and  unavoidable is the anthropomorphization of gods, whom man created  in his own image, and who, whenever visually available, as for instance  in an epiphany, tend to corroborate rather than to falsify that image?7  5 It also can be done the other way round: Xenophon makes gods design animals;  in this way he can explain why the gods put a tuft of hair on horses’ brows and gave  donkeys long ears (Eq. 5.6). All this to support his theology based on the argument  of design. Cf. R.C.T. Parker, The Origins of Pronoia: A Mystery, in: Apodosis. Essays  Presented to Dr. W.W. Cruickshank (London 1992) 84–94, espec. 86.  6 As did Aristotle Pol.1252b26–28, arguing that mankind conceives the gods  anthropomorphically in a twofold sense: not just in terms of their forms (eide) but  also in terms of their lifestyle (bioi), while Aristotle’s own opinion differs considerably,  as in On the Universe 397b10–401b24. In Pol. 1326a32 he envisages god as a ‘divine  power’ (theia dunamis) that ‘holds everything together’ as the informing principle of  the kosmos. 7 In visions or epiphanies, gods may manifest themselves in many different forms  but as a rule they appear in human shape (Versnel 1987). What ancient Greek comedy  writers did by intentionally over-anthropomorphising gods (and thus making them  objects of ridicule as we saw in Chapter IV) is very much comparable with what  ethologists do when taking the ‘intentional stance’, i.e. pretending, for the sake of  argument, that an animal can think or feel as we do. Kennedy’s label ‘mock anthro- pomorphism’ makes the resemblance even more obvious, especially when he adds:  “The vital distinction between the (unconscious) projection of human experiences to  animals and the intentional mock anthropomorphism must always be kept in mind,  for it is rather easy to confuse them.” </page> <page sequence="4"> 382 chapter five We no longer need Feuerbach for these insights since  Christian   theologians of our time heartily agree.8 We simply are unable to con- ceive a completely non-anthropomorphic god since we cannot speak  about him/her in non-anthropomorphic terms.9 One key problem is  language.10 Religion speaks human language; so does man when he  8 E.g. J. Werbick, art. ‘Gott’, in Lexikon für Theologie und Kirche IV (1995) 868:  “Der Versuch von Gott zu sprechen, indem man ihm Eigenschaften beilegt, steht seit  Feuerbach unter Projektionsverdacht. Dieser Verdacht ist zumindenst darin im Recht,  daß Sprechen von Gott immer auch Sprechen von Menschen ist: von den Grenzen  menschlicher Seins-und Wesenverwirklichung, die negiert werden müssen, wo man  von Gott zu sprechen versucht.” The problem however is that the requirement “negi- ert werden müssen” (must be ignored) in this phrase, cannot be fulfilled in religious  practice. In current anthropology St.E. Guthrie, The origin of an Illusion, in: St.D. Gla- zier (ed.), Anthropology of Religion: A Handbook (Westport CT 1997) 489–504, force- fully argues that all religion is a result of anthropomorphism and therefore illusory.  9 So already Nägelsbach 1840, 11: “Die Forderung des Menschengeistes in Absicht  aus das Wesen seines Gottes geht weiter, als sein Vermögen, derselben durch Gebilde  seiner eigenen Phantasie zu genügen, und so finden wir denn die göttliche Persön- lichkeit, so hoch sie dem Glauben nach über der menschlichen steht, gleichwohl  der Erscheining nach mit allen Schranken und Mängeln irdischer Natur behaftet.”  Ancient experiments on their way to entirely abstract deities include Xenophanes (see  Ch. III), Empedocles and Protagoras. Th. Korteweg, The Reality of the Invisible, in:  Vermaseren 1979, espec. 66–70, hits the mark, when he considers this a “very danger- ous tendency,” arguing: “The problem is not simply that it is difficult to imagine a god  who is so utterly unlike anything we meet in the world, but rather that it is difficult to  imagine such a god at all.” He quotes G. Devereux: “another attribution of perfection  to god is another step towards atheism.” Already in antiquity the Xenophanean thesis  that god cannot be imagined in the likeness of man has been used as an argument for  atheism (Sext. Emp. adv. phys. 1.137–190). G.M. Jantzen, God’s World, Gods’ Body  (London 1984) even argues, on grounds of analogy, that the Christian God must have  a bodily existence, since “if there were no such analogy, how could we ever know any- thing of God?” Cf. below n. 167 on Kuitert. Contrarily, B. Miller, A Most Unlikely God.  A Philosophical Enquiry into the Nature of God (Notre Dame, Ind. 1996) exposes the  absurdity of attempts to describe in human language God’s perfectness and sketches  his radical unimaginable otherness. 10 And, as a good second, of course, visual imagery. On the issue of anthropomor- phic imagery of gods Cicero ND 1.77 remarks that it is not easy for an author or a  visual artist “to capture gods in imitations of different forms (then the human ones)  (non facile agentis aliquid et molientis deos in aliarum formarum imitatione servare),  adding that perhaps the opinion that in the eyes of man nothing seems to be more  beautiful than man may also have contributed. Hdt. 1.131 f., in an attempt to explain  the curious otherness of Persian sacrifice—no god’s portion, no roasting, no commu- nal meal as well as the absence of temples and statues—already made an appeal to the  principle of anthropomorphism: “This comes, so it seems to me, from not believing  the gods to be in the likeness of men (ἀνθρωποφυέας) as the Greeks do.” </page> <page sequence="5">  god: the question of divine omnipotence 383 speaks about or prays to his gods11 and so do the gods12 (mostly) when  they grant an answer.13 And so do classical scholars. One of the great- est, Arthur Darby Nock (Essays II 549) summarized it in a celebrated  expression: “The gods were larger Greeks” (kreittones would be the  preferred Greek term). However, he did not stop there but added: “yes,  but between gods and man there was a line.” So let us now cross that  line and turn from anthropomorphism to allomorphism, from “self ”  to “other.” 11 Especially in the context of prayer anthropomorphism hits home. For instance  in the epistolary style of prayers to a god, which end with ἔρρωσο (lit. “fare well/take  care,” for the secular use of which see: R. Buzón, Die Briefe der Ptolemäerzeit: Ihre  Struktur und ihre Formeln [Diss. Heidelberg 1984] 25 f., 70, 114, 173, 243, and for the  communication with a god: Versnel 1981a, 833 f. with more examples). Others may  open with the wish that the divine addressee “may be healthy and live long” (F. Jones  Bliss &amp; R.A. Stewart Macalister, Excavations in Palestine [London 1902], no. 35).  Fifth-century Greek curse tablets have comparable epistolary expressions. Even more  human are the expressions of anger and bad wishes to gods that have failed to ful- fil a prayer. See: Versnel 1981a, 37–42, and add: A.D. Nock, Review Bidez-Cumont,  Les Mages Hellénisés, JRS 30 (1940) 191–198, esp. 194 f. For the Roman period see:  F. Cumont, L’Égypte des astrologues (Bruxelles 1937) 136 f.; Veyne 1986, espec. 260 f.  Even if Scheer 2001, 53 ff. is right in discarding Xerxes’ flagellation of the Hellespont,  her attempt to save her Greeks from such improper behaviour vis-à-vis the gods by  disqualifying all other testimonies is not successful. 12 And so did animals (sometimes) in Greek and Roman ears. Th. Fögen, Antike  Zeugnisse zu Kommunikationsformen von Tieren, AuA 53 (2007) 39–75, in a very  interesting and well documented article, concludes (71): “Ein höherer affektiver Bezug  des Menschen zum Tier führt in der Regel zu einer stärkeren Anthropomorphisierung  und zugleich zu der Zuschreibung einer ‘Sprachbegabung’.” Cf. recently: M. Bettini,  Voci: Antropologia sonora del mondo antico. Saggi, 982 (Torino 2008), with a central  focus on ‘voices’ of animals.  13 Gould 1985, 16: “divinity understands Greek, even if it is another question  whether he speaks it.” Greek prayer of course is grounded on the first proposition.  To the adorant in a prayer situation this is self-evident. It does not clash with mythi- cal notions of a language of the gods, for which see below n. 26. As witness the writ- ten votive prayers and curse tablets the gods can also read (Versnel 2002). Writing,  however, is a different matter: A. Henrichs, Writing Religion: Inscribed Texts, Ritual  Authority, and the Religious Discourse of the Polis, in: H. Yunis (ed.), Written Texts  and the Rise of Literate Culture in Ancient Greece (Houston 2003) 38–58: espec. 38:  “Olympian gods do not appear to be literate, or if they are, they do not flaunt their  literacy. In fact, they hide it.” But see the important exceptions at pp. 38 f. Cf. already  M. Detienne, L’écriture d’Orphée (Paris 1989) 104: “Les dieux grecs sont de parfaits  analphabètes: ils vont rester illettrés jusqu’à l’âge hellénistique.” M. Beard, Writing and  Religion: Ancient Literacy and the Function of the Written Word in Roman Religion,  in: J. Humphrey (ed.), Literacy in the Roman World. JRA Suppl. 3 (Ann Arbor 1991)  35–58, espec. 49–53: “The written words of the gods,” refers to oracles, which were  not regarded as ‘manuscripts’ by the gods themselves. So-called Himmelsbriefe (letters  from heaven) are a different matter (J. Schneider, ‘Brief ’, par. 5 ‘Himmelsbriefe’, RAC  2 [1954] 572 f.). There is no evidence of such written messages ‘from above’ prior to  the 2nd c. AD. Paus. 10.38.13 is the earliest testimony. </page> <page sequence="6"> 384 chapter five 2. Other I am not the first to mention gods and beasts in the same breath.  One of the most celebrated notions introduced by the École de Paris,  especially by Marcel Detienne, is that according to the Greeks man’s  status was “between beasts and gods” (“entre bêtes et dieux”). He  had a predecessor in Aristotle, who, in his Ethica Nicomachaea, often  refers to gods and beasts as the two opposite extremes defining human  existence. If, then, (some) Greeks define their own status by contrast- ing it with those of beasts and gods, it is perhaps not too adventur- ous to follow their lead and see what happens. If the first part of this  chapter drew the attention to the likeness of god and man—‘god in  man’s image’—, the French expression ‘entre bêtes et dieux’ turns the  spotlight on the differences: god and man as antithesis. And with this  we have arrived at another recent hype, this time not borrowed from  zoology but from (structural) anthropology. Over the last two or three decades many students of Greek and  Roman Antiquity have become sojourners in another world, a world  in which ‘the Other’ is the focus: the eccentric has become the centre  of interest. We have briefly touched upon this new wave in the Intro- duction to this book and this is the right place to return to the topic.  In recent scholarship we have learned that Scythians, Persians, women  (Greek or non-Greek), slaves, sectarians, magicians and many other  ‘others’ turn out to have been cultural constructs in many respects,  ‘existing’ only or mainly in Greek imagination. As a cultural construct  ‘the Other’ is, so it is claimed, a reverse reflection of the self. If, then,  ethnic, social or gender stereotypes provide only very doubtful infor- mation on the groups they claim to represent, they have on the other  hand lots to say about the culture that has created them. In other  words: self-identity is essentially defined and expressed—hence can be  recovered—through the discourse of otherness. The new approach has  yielded revealing and important new insights.14 14 One of the results, as we have seen in the Introduction, is Paul Cartledge’s The  Greeks. A Portrait of Self and Others (Oxford 1993) which consistently takes its depar- ture from the image of the other to arrive at the self. I refer the reader to the bibli- ography in his book for further relevant literature. It should be noted that the notion  of ‘the other’ and its social function are a hot issue in all kinds of cultural studies. I  particularly refer to the fascinating work on ‘urban legends’ that “prey on the fears  of modern life,” as represented in such studies as P. Turner, I Heard it Through the  Grapevine: Rumor in African-American Culture (Berkeley – Los Angeles 1993); J.H.  </page> <page sequence="7">  god: the question of divine omnipotence 385 Now, if images of foreign cultures, women, slaves, though having a  visible and tangible existence, are for a large part constructs of other- ness, we may repeat the question: how much more are the gods, who  originated as, and have never attained a status beyond, pure construc- tion? Indeed, gods can be regarded as the very exponent of otherness, as,  long before the recent trend of cultural ‘otherness’, was first suggested  by Rudolf Otto with his definition of the religious mysterium tremen- dum as “das ganz Andere,”15 widely acclaimed and adopted by both  historians of religion,16 and Christian theologians, most particularly  Karl Barth, who defined the Christian god as “der ganz Andere.” Gods are ‘larger Greeks’—Gods are ‘radical others’; these contrast- ing qualifications will not come as a surprise to the reader. If so, why  then do we have so much trouble in accepting or even considering the  implications and consequences of this ambiguity? Let us turn now to  some corollaries of what everybody knows, but which, if realized at all,  are curiously undervalued. 3. Self and other Influential theories, like influential people, have their drawbacks. If  this is true in general, it is particularly true for structuralism, so much  so that the École de Paris17 itself has now definitely renounced this  once so proud sobriquet. It has been said many times, loud and clear:  the binary oppositions on which Lévi-Strauss’ dogmatic structuralism  was constructed, is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Charmed by its seduc- tive transparency the reader forgets to reflect on its implications. The  opposition nature-culture, though obvious to our eyes and brilliantly  elaborated in structuralism studies, may become a reductio ad absur- dum of the endless variety of oppositions that may be implied. So,  or even more so is the opposition other-self. The concept of ‘Other- ness’ certainly has presented us with a productive hermeneutic tool in  the study of cultural identity. But it is about time now to take a step  back for reconsideration. What we have learned is that otherness is  Brunvand, The Truth Never Stands in the Way of a Good Story (Univ. Illinois Press  2001). 15 R. Otto, Das Heilige (Breslau 19229) 28–34. 16 “Thus the first affirmation we can make about the Object of Religion is that it is  a highly exceptional and extremely impressive ‘Other’ ”: G. van der Leeuw, Religion in  Essence and Imagination (Princeton 1986 = London 1938, 19642) 23. 17 On the general use and meaning of this sobriquet see Ch. I n. 41.  </page> <page sequence="8"> 386 chapter five  inconceivable without its opposite, ‘the self ’ (and vice versa). But what,  in our enthusiasm, we may have failed to realize is that the construc- tion of the ‘Other’ cannot function, indeed cannot exist, without a gen- erous dash of ‘self’ in its imagery. Let us illustrate this with a famous  episode in the ninth book of the Odyssey: The Homeric Cyclopes, especially in the person of Polyphemos, are  portrayed as anti-Greeks and anti-human: they do not know markets,  political decision making, councils, social forms of organization, ships,  religion. They are bestial cannibals, and even when they cannot lay  hands on an occasional Greek washed ashore they still remain “eaters  of flesh and drinkers of milk.”18 Clearly, these are raw materials for the  construction of otherness. All the same it is to be borne in mind that  Cyclopes are no beasts19 but only share a number of frightening fea- tures with beasts. For the rest, they boast a fairly recognizable human- like livelihood, for which they are equipped with legs, arms, ears, all of  gigantic seize it is true, but of human form; they enjoy visual faculty— note that the traditional trademark of their otherness, namely the dra- matically reduced number of their eyes, is never mentioned explicitly  in Homer’s account and turns up only at the very moment that it is  contextually required. Though, on the one hand, Polyphemos is very  ‘other’ in not even cooking or roasting his Greek victims for dinner,  with his other hand he does debone them by carving them with a knife  (μελειστὶ ταμών, Od. 9.291). Did the Poet sleep here? If he did, he dreamt a very meaningful  dream, since it reveals that he could not think the other without laps- ing into the self from time to time. As to the Cyclopes, their most  obvious positive quality, so obvious indeed that it is not noticed at all  initially, is their excellent working knowledge of Greek. They are fluent  in that language—that is: all other Cyclopes are, whereas Polyphemos  must have cancelled his Greek course just before tackling the indefi- nite pronoun. No element of this Homeric excursus has received a  18 B. Shaw, Eaters of Flesh, Drinkers of Milk: The Ancient Mediterranean Ideology  of the Pastoral Nomad, Anc.Soc. 13/14 (1982–3) 5–31. 19 F.

If noticed at all, scholars at most assign  it a narratological inevitability: Germans in an English war film com- municate in English which they speak fluently albeit with a funny  accent. As for the Homeric epic, everybody speaks Greek: Trojans,20  Phaeacians, gods, nymphs. Is it a negligible feature for that reason?  In many respects it is, in one respect it is highly meaningful: better  than anything else it illustrates that the Other cannot be imagined nor  communicated without the aid of elements of the self. And the most  revealing thing is that as soon as otherness requires a reminder you  can use the self by corrupting it and making a pun on a pronoun.21 There is no exception to this amalgamation of self and other, sim- ply because the complete other is beyond imagination: it cannot be  thought. Herodotus, an acknowledged specialist in otherness,22 pic- tures two extremes of his extended ethnographic excursuses, one in  the far East of Northern Eurasia the other in the extreme South-West  of Northern Africa. They are very odd indeed: in the East we find  people with goat-feet and others with one eye, to the South-West dog- headed creatures or headless ones with eyes in their breasts, not to  mention “wild women and men”: all very ‘other’, yet never without  ingredients of the self. ‘The others’, including gods, are always a mixed  race boasting features that are completely different, but never devoid  of traits that are similar to ours. After all even for Herodotus’ ultimate  ‘others’ the iron law holds that in order to be able to carry your head  20 Of course, literary texts may hint at differences in language as for instance Il.  2. 867. In H.Aphrodite the goddess, in the shape of a mortal woman, tells Anchises  that she had been brought up by a Trojan nurse and so “I know your speech well  besides my own.” Cf. Aesch. Choeph. 564; Soph. fr. 176, but as Groeneboom ad Septem  166–170 remarks it is never played out as an issue on the stage until Aristophanes’  Acharnenses and Lysistrata. H. Mackie, Talking Trojan: Speech and Community in the  Iliad (New York – London 1996) discusses different issues. 21 Very comparable is a little scene in Aristophanes’ Birds 198 ff. When Peisetairos  asks Tereus who will be the one to reveal his plan to the birds, Tereus tells him that  he can do it himself, since the birds have learned Greek. Without this little intermezzo  Hellenophone birds—being nothing more than an unavoidable narrative device—would  not have attracted undue attention. By the mere fact of its mentioning—that is by its  being put into focus—, the absurdity becomes apparent and the effect is  laughter.  22 M. Rosellini &amp; S.

It is  due to its equivocality that the Other is interesting, “good to think,” to  use an expression particularly favoured by the Paris school. But is there a system in this madness? Can we descry an economy  in the application of the two opposites? Can we, if not predict, then at  least comprehend the circumstances in which the self or the other will  come to the fore respectively? In this chapter I hope to show we can— sometimes. The main thing one has to do is to check the rhetorical and  argumentative requirements of a context and see how, in accordance  with these different requirements elements of sameness and otherness  will claim their alternative positions in reflection, imagery or narrative.  Let us keep this in mind when we now return to the central theme of  the present chapter: god. 4. Gods: Self and other Gods are robins. Or worse. Robins exist without human initiative or  intervention. They form one of the numerous live screens upon which  man projects his human characteristics. Gods do not exist without  man. They are projections because they are human creations. Hence,  they are like mortals in form and behaviour. They are endowed with  senses, they see, hear, eat, speak, sleep, make love, travel, act. They  have emotions, affects, desires, including the fact that they suffer, are  angry, are clement; they have a will. And they have vices: they cheat,  lie, are jealous, and are utterly capricious. Everything exactly like their  creators.23 Greek gods, then, are “larger Greeks.” Gods are Others beyond expression. Being man’s handiwork, they  are desperate and ideal projections of hope and fear. Hence they are  man’s absolute opposites. They live ‘easily’, that is a utopian life, at  ease, without toil or effort.24 Worries do not trouble them. Not know- ing disease, sorrow or weakness, they do not suffer. Death does not  visit upon them. If they eat, it is not human food,25 if they converse it is  23 It is superfluous to adduce the evidence for all these features. Keyssner 1932,  127–135 provides an exhaustive list of the many different anthropomorphous divine  elements, both physical and psychological, that occur in Greek hymns. Cf. also Rud- hardt 1958, 56–59; 80–82; 85–90.  24 “The easy living (ῥεῖα ζώοντες) gods are a foil to the mortals” (Burkert 1985,  122).

All of these characteristics, the anthropomorphous and the allomor- phous, are too well-known to need ample documentation. Hackneyed  and worn-out, they have become banal. But this banality becomes  interesting when we notice that although both lists are true, practi- cally each item of the first is flatly contradicted by one of the second.  With a variation on an expression of Dilthey,27 we might conclude  that gods are condemned to this schizophrenic nature of being both  fundamentally different and “of the same race as man.”28 Had they  been only different, they would have been both inconceivable and  26 On language of the gods, especially in Homer: A.

I keep silent about late antique philosophical theories on divine language and  names.  27 W. Dilthey, as quoted in the Introduction to this book (above p. 15). Gould 1985,  4, compares religion with language and quotes E. Sapir: “The fact of the matter is that  the ‘real world’ is to a large extent unconsciously built up on the language habits of the  group. No two languages are ever sufficiently similar to be considered as representing  the same social reality. The world in which different societies live are distinct worlds,  not merely the same world with different labels attached.” Gould adds that for lan- guage we could read religion, but admits “that this thesis is vulnerable to reductio ad  absurdum arguments, to the effect that it makes impossible communication between  members of different cultures.” 28 Vernant, 1980, 107: “Thus, within the religious thought of the Greeks, there is  as it were a tension between two poles. Sometimes it postulates a divine world which  is relatively close to men. . . . . At other times it imagines a more clear-cut divide and  a greater gap between gods and men. . . . .”; Oudemans &amp; Lardinois 1987, 93: “Greek  gods were at an immense distance from mortals and at the same time dangerously  close.” Cf.

Burkert  1996a, 6 f., distinguishes between two principal characteristics of reli- gion in general: it is both ineffable in the sense that it deals with the  unverifiable, the nonevidential, the nonobvious, and manifest through  interaction and communication. He concludes: “In fact, religious com- munication always focuses in two directions, toward the unseen and  toward the contemporary social situation.” This determines the ambi- guity of gods. For, indeed, the truly crucial thing—to be continuously  kept in mind and yet often ignored—is that gods unite complete sets  of anthropomorphic and allomorphic characteristics, which are all  available on demand according to situation and context. The two may  alternate and shift, either of the two may suddenly emerge or vanish  even within one brief passage. They also may be confronted with each  other, as especially in comedy. The most excessively anthropomorphic account of the gods, namely  the Iliad of Homer, who, according to [Longinus], de Subl. 9.8: “as far  as he can, has made men gods and gods men,” in one and the same  passage pictures Diomedes wounding the goddess Aphrodite with  his spear, causing her divine blood (ichôr) to stream from the wound  and making her suffer (Il. 5.339 ff.),29 and receiving the warning from  Apollo: 29 In order to make this (as well as the comparable [mal]treatment of Ares later in  Book 5) possible Athena had to confer upon him the capacity of recognizing the gods  (Il. 5.127–132). Note ibid. 340–343 the significantly incoherent treatment of divine  blood and the importance of not partaking of human bread and wine in this context.  See: Nägelsbach 1840, 40–43. On the brinkmanship between mortal and immortal  aspects of Aphrodite’s bleeding, see Sineux 2006, 128 f. and the literature mentioned  there. Ø. Andersen, A Note on the ‘Mortality’ of Gods in Homer, GRBS 22 (1981)  323–328, convincingly explains the several ‘near-death’ experiences of gods (especially  in Il. 5), as paradigmatic ad hoc possibilities, similes of human acting and suffering in  the Iliad. For the special case of Ares see: N. Loraux, Le corps vulnérable d’Arès, in:  Le Corps des dieux, Le temps de la réflexion 7 (1986) 335–354. They are momentane- ous and more or less isolated mythical insertions and should not be understood as  systematic reflections on divine nature. Nor are gods always happy, especially not in  the Iliad: 7.204; 8.33; 13.352; 18.54; 20.293; 24.105. See: Nägelsbach 1840, 23 f.

Do not aspire to be the equal of the gods. Because  not of the same tribe (οȼ ποτε φ˃λον ὁμοῖον) are immortals gods and  earth-walking men (Il. 5.441 f.).30 Not by chance all three most quoted expressions bearing on difference  and resemblance between human and divine are stubbornly reluctant  to reveal their precise meaning: Hes. Erga 108: ὡς ὁμόθεν γεγάασιν  θεοὶ θνητοί τ’ ἄνθρωποι;31 Heraklitos Fr. 62. ἀθάνατοι θνητοί, θνητοὶ  ἀθάνατοι;32 Pind. Nem 6.1. ȉν ἀνδρῶν, ἓν θεῶν γένος, ἐκ μιᾶς δὲ  πνέομεν ματρὸς ἀμφότεροι.33 5. Some inferences What does all this mean? What are the implications? Perhaps first and  foremost that we should be just a bit more circumspect with respect to  devising universal markers of divinity. The standard ingredients to be  found in text books may be summarized in the following definition: a  god is a being who surpasses man in: 1) length of life: immortality, 2)  comfort and joy, 3) knowledge of what takes place behind the scenes  of life 4) power over nature and human life.34 Many Greek authors  30 Of course it is true that the two contrasting points of view are interconnected:  “Precisely because of divine anthropomorphism it was necessary to stress the immor- tal-mortal boundary” (Bremmer 1994, 12). Especially in cases of punishment of hybris  against and sex with gods, ”the message is clear: the gap between god and humans  is unbridgeable.” My point, here, is that both points of view can be (simultaneously)  valid: the idea that man can injure a god, and the notion that gods and men are  unbridgeably divided.  31 Where West replaces customary interpretations with the suggestion that men  and gods “started on the same terms. The first men lived like the gods. . .” 32 KRS 210: “very obscure: it evidently has some connection with the doctrine of  opposites, but also suggests the deification of some souls.” 33 “One is the race of men, one is the race of the gods, but from one mother (Earth)  do we both draw our breath. Yet a power wholly sundered holds us aloof, in that the  one is a thing of naught, while for the other the brazen heaven abides as a sure abode  forever. Nevertheless we have some likeness, either in power of mind (μέγαν νόον) or  in nature (φύσιν) to the immortals, though we know not to what measure day by day  in the watches of night fate has written that we should run.” 34 Thus a maximalist, inclusive, definition by P.A. Meijer, Philosophers, Intellectu- als and Religion in Hellas, in: Versnel 1981a, 216–262, espec. 224. A minimalist defini- tion can be found in Dodds 1965, 74: “In popular Greek tradition a god differed from  a man chiefly in being exempt from death and in the supernatural power which this  exemption conferred on him.” Jost 1992, 18, in a more nuanced discussion, betrays  the precariousness of defining what is a god: “Gods are persons, rarely concepts or  abstractions. Their superhuman nature is apparent from their immortality (although  they are born and exceptionally die); their appearance is human, but greater. They  are not omnipresent, they come and go. They are never ill, cannot be wounded, are  </page> <page sequence="14"> 392 chapter five agree on a fixed set of ‘deificators’, sometimes omitting one element or  adding another. Hesiod’s characteristics include “immortal and age- less, free from trouble, free from old age, for all time”35 (Th. 940 ff.)  and “with carefree heart, remote from toil and misery. Wretched old  age did not affect them either, but with hands and feet ever unchanged  they enjoyed themselves in feasting, beyond all ills” (E. 112, on heroes  who live like gods).36 This returns in Epicurus’ summary: “All men  are said to have a natural belief that the gods are immortal, sublimely  happy.”37 The problem is that this may be taken as obviously true for  the gods as a polythetic class, but that not all of these qualities apply to  each individual god. More alarming is that it may be true for an indi- vidual god at one moment or in one context and untrue in another.  Worse: it may even be true and untrue for one god in one and the same  context. This can be demonstrated for practically any divine character- istic listed in our earlier survey, but I have chosen to illustrate it here  by challenging one quality (or rather the lack of one quality) on which  there seems to be a unanimous agreement, as outspoken as it is rare in  modern scholarship. I mean the concept of omnipotence. Vernant’s definition quoted in our first chapter (p. 27) implies that  the concept of omnipotence is incompatible with Greek polytheism.  He postulates a “strict demarcation of the forces and their hierarchical  counterbalancing. This excludes the categories of omnipotence, omni- invisible.” On the relevant views of intellectuals of the imperial period see: MacMul- len 1981, 73–78. 35 The essential combination of immortality and agelessness is an issue in a number  of myths and popular stories, as for instance in H. Aphrodite 202–246, which focuses  on the problem of being immortal but not ageless. 36 All this is mirrored in Ar. Av. 688 ff. 37 Epic. Men. 123, ἄφθαρτος καὶ μακάριος; also in the first of his Kuriai Doxai,  summarized by Cic. ND I 45–6, who in accordance with the argument at stake adds:  “and of human shape.” On the precarious status of divine immortality in Stoic and  Epicurean theology see: A.A.

Scholars of such different denomina- tions as Brelich, Bremmer, Burkert, and Detienne, among many oth- ers agree with this general statement.39 Gould 1985, 7, is exemplarily  explicit in his formulation: “There is never an assumption of divine  omnipotence (nor of a divine creation of the universe, except in philo- sophical ‘theology’),40 nor any consistent belief in divine omnipres- ence.” Let us have a look. First, however, a question: what exactly do these authors mean by  ‘omnipotence’: the unrestricted faculty to achieve anything that comes  to the god’s mind or the hierarchical supremacy and unbridled domi- nance wielded by one god over the whole universe, including gods,  men and matter? It is perhaps not by chance that we do not get an  38 Vernant 1980, 102, adding at p. 103. “What we find then is neither omniscience  nor omnipotence but specific forms of knowledge and power between which certain  oppositions may arrive.”  39 A. Brelich, Der Polytheismus, Numen 7 (1960) 123–136, esp. 127, makes it his  first characteristic of a polytheistic pantheon “die Allmacht, zum Beispiel, ist mit der  göttlichen Vielzahl unvereinbar; denn mehrere Götter können nicht allmächtig sein  (. . .).” Burkert 1985, 248: “its [polytheism’s] multiplicity always implies opposition:  Hera against Zeus, Aphrodite against Artemis (. . .). Consequently order is possible  only as apportionment, moira, as departmentalization. Every god protects his domain;  he intervenes if, and only if, this domain is specifically violated. This is true at first  even of Zeus.” Detienne 1986, 51: “Il n’est pas de polythéisme qui n’implique une  limitation de pouvoirs en même temps que de compétences. Le pouvoir de chacun  reçoit sa frontière et sa délimitation des autres, et tout savoir n’existe que d’affronter  les compétences des autres.” Bruit-Schmitt 1992, 3–4: “the gods . . . did not create  the cosmos or mankind, but were themselves created (. . .) they were not omnipo- tent and omniscient, but possessed only limited powers and areas of knowledge; they  were themselves subject to fate, and they intervened constantly in the affairs of men.”  Bremmer 1994, 11: “Greek gods resembled and differed from the Christian God in  important aspects. Like Him, they were invisible, but they were not loving, almighty,  or omnipresent; moreover, they were ‘envious and disorderly’: Hdt. I.32.1” (the Hdt.  text, however, has to theion, and the two negative qualities belong to ‘the gods’ as a  comprehensive notion as discussed in our Ch. II. Besides, the notion of enviousness  is not a particularly appropriate differentiator between the Jewish-Christian god and  those of the Greeks, who may both be called “envious/jealous,” even if the objectives of  their envy may differ). On the Homeric gods: Scheer 2001, 35: “Die Götter sind nicht  allmächtig. Sie sind nicht allwissend. Sie sind nicht von vornherein gnädig und gut.  Sie sind nicht omnipräsent.” Cf. eadem 2000, 115 ff. Christian theologians writing on  Greek polytheism arrive at similar conclusions. Van den Brink 1993, 173: “The gods of  Greek mythology were too numerous to be omnipotent (. . .) the mythological deities  are clearly depicted as limiting the range of each other’s power.” 40 D. Sedley, Creationism and Its Critics in Antiquity (Berkeley 2007). </page> <page sequence="16"> 394 chapter five answer to this question, indeed that none of these authors seems to  bother about these trifles of definition. Vernant explicitly embraces  both notions in his definition, denying the Greek gods both omnipo- tence and infinite power (as well as omniscience). So does Detienne  when he speaks of “pouvoirs en même temps que de compétences.”  When Bremmer opposes Greek polytheism to the almighty god of  Jewish-Christian theology, both connotations seem to be necessarily  implied and perhaps this is also the best manner to understand oth- ers of these—ominously vague—statements. After all, in scholarly dis- course one type of omnipotence can be distinguished from, but cannot  easily be conceived without the other. Especially not in a monotheism  where God’s capacity to do all things (omnipotence) is often under- stood as a corollary of his being supreme and sole ruler of the universe  (almightiness).41 All classical scholars writing on the (non-)omnipotence of Greek  gods inevitably take the notion omnipotence (and/or almightiness) in  the sense it has acquired in the Jewish-Christian tradition. What they  rarely if ever realize is that this Christian concept is anything but a  well-defined and indisputable axiomatic notion. On the contrary, the  question whether the God of Jews and Christians is—can be—omni- potent has been the subject of fierce theological debate ever since the  early modern period, a debate which has come to an existential cul- mination after the Holocaust. Apart from the impossibility that gods  achieve things that are incompatible with their own nature, physical  law or logic, as argued by Greek thinkers (as we shall discuss later in  this chapter), there is a range of different arguments against unlimited  divine omnipotence, especially in the context of the problem of evil42  and the theodicy in connection with human free will. “God cannot  bring it about that an agent freely does one thing rather than another”  41 These two qualities are generally distinguished in theological works, the first,  ‘the power to do all things’, regarded as a philosophical concept, the second, ‘the  power over all things’, as a biblical theological concept. See e.g. P.T. Geach, Omnipo- tence, Philosophy 43 (1973) 7–20 = idem, Providence and Evil (Cambridge 1977) 3–28.  However, Van den Brink 1993, Ch. III, has convincingly argued that both can be  defined as power to do all things, although he does distinguish between philosophi- cal omnipotence and biblical almightiness. At p. 159 he defines omnipotence as “the  ability to do all things (to bring about all things, or to make a maximal difference to  the universe).”  42 For a revealing insight into the aporia of the problem evil versus divine omnipo- tence see: M.L. Peterson, God and Evil: An Introduction to the Issues (Boulder Colo- rado 1998). Cf. above Ch. II p. 236 f. </page> <page sequence="17">  god: the question of divine omnipotence 395 thus one theologian.43 Others argue that God’s omnipotence, as dem- onstrated in his creation of kosmos and world, was defined by his  task to sustain his creation.44 Yet another view is that God ties himself  down by an act of self-restraint in restricting his own omnipotence.45  In a scathingly critical and eminently clear book on such arguments  and counterarguments, N. Everitt compellingly argues that whoever  wishes to explicitly defend that God is omnipotent, omnipresent, and  omniscient, in the same breath implicitly but irrefutably argues for his  non-existence.46 Admittedly less translucent, but no less brilliant (and  relevant to our own discussion), finally, is the proposition: “What it  will make sense to say a divine being can do depends on what it makes  sense to say a divine being does.”47 In sum, if we wish to assess ancient Greek religious ideas about  divine competence, our notion ‘omnipotence’ turns out to be less reli- able a tool then one might have imagined. It is my intention to show  that things are even more complicated than that and that Greek reli- gion may boast divine omnipotence with the same right as does the  alleged monotheism of the biblical Scriptures.48 I shall focus my atten- tion on claims that the gods can do whatever they wish to, but much  of what we will discover has comparable implications for the notion  of supreme dominance over the world or kosmos in a henotheistic  sense of that word. 43 A.

Many a late antique Coptic prayer or ritual spell,49 following an ancient  Egyptian practice, makes an appeal to the omnipotence of gods, listing  their unlimited powers in long aretalogical praises, as we have dis- cussed in Ch. III, including such hyperboles as “you are the one who  is over them all, father of all; without you nothing can happen, god  who gives hope, who grants healing” (no. 66), or, better still, adunata  specifically characteristic of divine self-proclamations such as: “I can  make the iron into water, I can stop the sun in its chariot” (no. 75). In  one spell (no. 43) for “a person who is swollen” (meaning a pregnant  woman suffering from retarded dilatation) the God Amun claims in a  parallelismus membrorum belonging to the best aretalogical tradition: I make those who are pregnant give birth, I close up those who miscarry, unexpectedly adding in the next line: I make all eggs productive . . . except the infertile eggs. The reader cannot help feeling a touch of disappointment when con- fronted with such a testimonium paupertatis concerning the unman- ageability of infertile eggs in an otherwise lavish orchestration of  omnipotence.50 After all, this is both the literary genre and the very  period in which gods, demons and magicians continuously and prac- tically without exception claim a boundless and arbitrary power to  do whatever comes to their minds, often expressed in stereotyped  pairs of two polar and opposite qualities such as “I soothe the sea and  49 As they are most accessibly collected in Meyer &amp; Smith 1994, to which the num- bers of the quotes in my text refer. 50 Peter Rhodes refers me to a nice Hebrew parallel in Judges 1.19. Judah is on the  way to conquering the land of the Canaanites: “And the Lord was with Judah: and  he captured the mountains. But he could not drive out the inhabitants of the val- ley, because they had chariots of iron.” Naive singularities in praises of omnipotence  abound. The Hebrew Morning Prayer says: “Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King  of the Universe, who hast bestowed insight on the cock to tell the day from the night,”  One also finds them in utopian imagery. There it may be the ultimate test of bliss “not  to need to change your socks”, as I found out in McClintock’s celebrated 1928 song  “Big Rock Candy Mountain” (with thanks to Mary Di Lucia).  </page> <page sequence="19">  god: the question of divine omnipotence 397 make it turbulent” or “I make the navigable unnavigable whenever it  pleases me.”51 However, this concerns a text from late antique Egypt,52 far distant  from classical Greece in place and time. Let us therefore make a big  leap in time and in social-intellectual level.53 I quote a few lines from  the famous Hymn to Zeus by Kleanthes (3d century BC), in the first  17 lines of which Zeus, being the first cause of Nature and the guiding  principle of natural law, is hailed with various formulas of omnipo- tence culminating in (15–17): Nothing occurs on the earth apart from you, o God, nor in the heavenly regions nor in the sea except what evil men do in their folly. The structural correspondence with the three lines of the late antique  spell from Egypt is remarkable. And the reader’s surprise is propor- tionate. His first impression that the inconsistency is intentional is  confirmed in the subsequent four lines (18–21). They introduce an  attempt at solving the intrinsic contradiction evoked by a divine  providence that is both perfect and defective, a problem inherent in  the Stoa, which cannot really tolerate the existence of evil. How can  evil exist in a world that is ruled by God, the only single active prin- ciple in a monistic system, without making the god responsible for  its existence?54 The solution proposed in the hymn is so intricate that  specialists must be called in to explain it to the less gifted.55 And the  inconsistency remains, as it does in Christian theology. 51 Isis aretalogy from Kume, as discussed above p. 284. For more—and stronger— enunciations of this type see below pp. 422–426.  52 The restriction with regard to the infertile egg may have its origin in Egyp- tian mythology. In demotic texts on the birth houses, Amun vivifies—but does not   create—the young god. Knuhm fashions the god and Amun then brings life to him.  This may mean that Amun cannot really create life in anything that does not have the  potential to become alive (with thanks to John Baines).  53 Though, admittedly, the author of this testimony, Kleanthes, had a reputation for  being slow of wit. According to Diogenes Laertius 7.168, Kleanthes “had industry but  no natural aptitude for physics, and he was extraordinarily slow.” 54 A.A.

It is a precarious mar- riage between philosophy and religion, which, particularly in its Stoic  variant, is practically doomed to end up in conflict and divorce. So,  then, let us finally go back another few centuries. If a monkey “does  not know what she knows,”56 Apollo, contrarily, claims to know what  he does not know and to do what he cannot do, when he says “I know  the number of the sand and the measure of the sea, I understand the  speech of the dumb and hear the voiceless” (Hdt. 1.47). It is perhaps  the most pretentious expression of omnipotence in classical Greek lit- erature. Yet according to the same Herodotus the same Apollo admits  that “destiny is inescapable even for a god,” a restriction on divine  omnipotence which precluded him from delaying Croesus’ downfall  for more than a few years.57 Seven or eight centuries later, the same  (or was it another? Cf. Ch. I, p. 75.) Apollo has throttled down even  with respect to his own speciality: omniscience. In several oracles of  the third century AD we hear Apollo Kareios warning that even the  gods, including the oracle god that he is himself, do not claim to know  everything.58 to a single principle has produced a fundamental incoherence on this point.” Just  before, he had already bucked us up by labelling it an “apparent contradiction” (181).  Long’s summary (182) does not help either: “The harmony of the universe as a whole  is something which transcends any attempt to view the world from a particular part.  If we view Nature’s activities as contradictory this is due to the limitations of human  vision. Moreover, Nature does not will the actions of bad men. The harmonizing of  dissonance, not the creation of dissonance, is Nature’s work.” There is a courageous  suggestion to solve the problems in: J.C. Thom, The Problem of Evil in Cleanthes’  Hymn to Zeus, ActCl. 41 (1998) 45–57. See also idem, Cleanthes’ Hymn to Zeus. Text,  Translation, and Commentary (Tübingen 2005) 94–98. But I agree with Rüpke 2001,  68, on the Kleanthes Hymn as exemplary for the Stoic system: “das System lebt auch  von seinen Inkonsistenzen” (“The system derives energy from its inconsistencies” in  the—somewhat questionable—translation of the English edition). 56 Above p. 380. 57 In which he was surpassed by Asklepios who granted his protégé Aelios Aristides  “ten years from himself and an additional three years from Serapis” (Ael. Arist. Hieroi  Logoi II. 18). This is quite a remarkable claim since “ten years was felt to be the limit of  resisting or trifling fate”: S. Levin, Diotima’s Visit and Service to Athens, GB 3 (1975)  223–240, espec. 234–239, on this fixed term.  58 “Whichever god thinks he is cleverer than the other gods or tries to enrich him- self (?) on the strength of false claims, stable wealth will not accompany him (?),”  on which see: M. West, Oracles of Apollo Kareios: A Revised Text, ZPE 1 (1967)  183–187, espec. 187, with earlier literature. The confession that a god, even if his name  is Apollo, does not know everything may be in line with some others of these curious  theological or theosophical oracles, in which Apollo admits that he is only a messenger  of the nameless real God, but they do contrast with the generally very confident tone  of the majority of divine self-proclamations of this period. R. Merkelbach &amp; J. Stauber,  </page> <page sequence="21">  god: the question of divine omnipotence 399 The whole ambiguity is exemplarily and wittily exposed in the second  fable of Babrius. A farmer has lost his mattock and suspecting the  nearby rustics of the theft brings them into the city for the purpose  of putting them under oath before the gods. “For people suppose that  the simpletons among the gods live in the country, while those who  dwell within the city walls are unerring and observe everything that  goes on” (εȢναι τ’ ἀληθεῖς καὶ τὰ πᾶντ’ ἐποπτεύειν).59 However, even  before they can enter the temple a herald comes forth and promises a  huge reward for the one who can give information about property sto- len from the temple. So the farmer decides to return, empty-handed:  “How can this god know about other thieves, when he does not even  know who has stolen his own property?” The little fable presents two  revealing details, which will prove important to our further discus- sion: first, not every god is equally good in knowing and seeing. You  have to seek out the experts. Secondly, even those who are generally  deemed to be the best—indeed “capable of seeing everything”—may  prove deficient.60 Die Orakel des Apollon von Klaros, EA 27 (1996) 1–53 = R. Merkelbach, Philologica.  Ausgewählte kleine Schriften (Stuttgart – Leipzig 1997) 155–218; Busine 2005, passim,  espec. 427. Chaniotis 2010, 117: “For many worshippers of traditional religion it must  have been as shocking to learn from Apollo that the traditional gods were only mes- sengers and a small part of a motherless polyonymous god as it was for Julian two  centuries later to learn, again from Apollo, that his oracle was no more.”  59 Dover 1974, 257–261 gives the evidence. All-knowing, however, does not neces- sarily imply all-helpful. On the scarcity of evidence of all-knowing gods in classical  Greece see: R. Garland, Religious Authority in Archaic and Classical Athens, BSA 79  (1984) 75–123. We do find a few warnings for members of a jury to vote the correct  way in order to avoid the wrath of the gods and a few isolated expressions claiming  that the gods “oversee all human acts” (Lyc. c. Leoc. 94). Cf. ibid. 146, where the ora- tor reminds the jury that “each of you, in casting his vote now in secret, will make his  own thought apparent to the gods” or “though far off in heaven, they see all that men  do” (Eur. Bac. 393 ff.). The interesting fact, however, is not so much that they occur,  but that their occurrence is so rare. See for a discussion and further literature: Versnel  2002, 41–45. In other words: gods may be able to see everything, but do so only when  their own interest is involved. This is true in particular in the context of oath taking,  on which see: Dover l.c.  60 At any rate, in order to make double sure, a woman in a recently published  papyrus, having been robbed of three mattocks, first brings her suspect to the altar to  make him swear that he is innocent (“Are the mattocks yours as you maintain? . . . “the  mattocks are mine”) and next gives the case into the hands of King Ptolemy with the  formulaic request μὴ περιιδεῖν με ἀδικουμένην and ȡνα ἔπι σε καταφυγο˃σα τύχω το˃  δικαίου. See: G. Schwendner &amp; P. Sijpesteijn, An Enteuxis from the Zenon Archive  from a Female Plaintiff, Ancient Society 25 (1994) 141–149.

So far we have seen only few and scat- tered pieces of information, which we have no right to extrapolate into  a general inference. However, we are lucky enough to have a compre- hensive collection of records which provides a more systematic and  consistent picture of the ambiguity at stake. 3. Miracles in Double Perspective: The Case of Asklepios Greek gods can work miracles. However, the term ‘miracle’ refers to  a polythetic class covering a great variety of phenomena of a widely  divergent nature. A considerable number of the famous inscriptions  recording miraculous cures (iamata) in the sanctuary of Asklepios61  at Epidauros as well as votive reliefs representing the healing event  depict the god in the role of a physician curing patients by means of  surgery, medical prescriptions and drugs in many respects similar to  61 IG IV 12, 121–124; Syll.3 1168 f.; SGDI 3339 f. Herzog 1931, henceforth cited as  Herzog; Edelstein and Edelstein I–II (henceforth cited as Edelstein), who omit the  stelai C and D; LiDonnici 1995. See for further (epigraphical) literature: Chaniotis  1988, 19–23. The iamata are henceforth cited after the numeration of Herzog 1–70, if  necessary also by that of LiDonnici who follows the order of the four stelai A, 1 etc.  B, 1 etc. C, D. Comparable lists of miracle cures have been found at Lebena (I.Cret.  I.xvii 8, 17–19, cf. below n. 128), and are reported for Kos and Trikka (Strabo 8.6.15;  14.2.19). From other Asklepieia, for instance at Corinth, no iamata have survived, but  patients left other testimonies: votive offerings in the form of parts of the body: Lang  1977. Generally on anatomical votives see Ch. I pp. 124 f. Dillon 1994 gives a full  survey of all ritual preparations for incubation in the various Asklepieia. On the incu- bational aspects of the Asklepios cult see: G.H. Renberg, Where Dreams May Come:  A Survey of Incubation Sanctuaries in the Greco-Roman World (forthcoming 2011),  Part II: Greek Cults, Ch. 3: Therapeutic Incubation in the Greek World: Asklepios. In  Christian pilgrim sites cures are also listed, not only in ex voto’s left by the customers,  but also in official records. Many sites, such as for instance the convent of Hagia Eirini  at Athens, issue their own journals and tapes with miracles, phrased and composed  in a manner closely resembling the ones of Asklepios. M. Bax, Religieuze regimes in  ontwikkeling. Verhulde vormen van macht en afhankelijkheid (Hilversum 1988) 106,  describes the registering in Medjugorje of 200 to 500 cures per day (as noticed by  Naerebout 1997, 365 n. 853). On possible influences of epigraphically recorded mira- cle cures on comparable New Testament miracle reports see: M. Wolter, Inschriftliche  Heilungsberichte und Neutestamentliche Wundererzählungen. Überlieferungs- und  Formgeschichtliche Beobachtungen, in: Kl. Berger, F. Vouga, M. Wolter &amp; D.

Both  divine miracle and human medical treatment might prevail, simulta- neously or alternatively, thus naturally tending to mutually influence  each other.63 Clearly the faithful (. . . .) expected the god to behave in visions in ways  which were in certain respects very similar to those of the doctors rep- resented in our extant Hippocratic treatises. . . . 62 For instance nos. 19, 41 (drugs); 13, 21, 23, 25, 27 (surgery). Also in miracle  accounts from other Asklepieia: Lebena (ICret I, nos. 8–16; Edelstein nos. 439–442, cf.  below n. 128), which were grouped entirely by medical content, e.g. surgery, medicine  etc.; Chr. Habicht, Die Inschriften des Asklepieions (Berlin 1969) no. 139. Herzog gives  a full survey of medical parallels for Epidaurian miracles. Recently, B.L. Wickkiser,  Chronicles of Chronic Cases and Tools of the Trade at Asklepieia,” ARG 8 (2006)  25–40, summarized in B. Wickkiser 2008, 58–61, has shown that Asklepios’ medical  attention was generally sought by those suffering from chronic, though non-terminal,  ailments, who despaired of being cured by physicians and decided to turn instead to  that profession’s divine patron. 63 Admittedly, there are important differences as well. The Coan medical school  of the Asclepiads (M. Gamberale, Ricerche sul γένος degli Asclepiadi, RAL 33 [1978]  83–95) boasted a direct descent from the divine physician and, consequently, there is  a strong emphasis on human medical treatment. There is also evidence for medical  and divine cooperation in the Asklepieia of Athens and Troizen. In contradistinction,  Epidauros betrays a certain—sometimes undisguised—reservation concerning human  physicians and accordingly has no real scientific medical tradition. However, the Epi- daurian sanctuary boasted ample accommodations for the patients, long term cures  and protracted treatment, all sustained by a sizeable staff. See: Herzog 1931, 139–160,  concluding (157): “so finden sich in allen Asklepieien gemeinsame Züge, die nur in  den einen stärker, in den anderen schwächer entwickelt sind (. . . .), die auch wenn sie  nicht von zünftigen Ärtzten überwacht werden, doch von der medizinischen Wissen- schaft der Zeit abhängig sind, auch wenn deren Verächtung zur Schau getragen wird.”  Cf. Cox Miller 1994, 113 on Epidauros: “the equivalent of an out-patient clinic,” and  especially H. King, Hippocrates’ Woman. Reading the Female Body in Ancient Greece  (London – New York 1998) Ch. V ‘Asklepios and Women’s Healing’ (99–113) on the  question: “But how far apart were Hippocrates and Asklepios?” with the well-argued  answer: “they were not perceived as incompatible alternatives.” On Etruscan and Italic  healing centres: J. MacIntosh Turfa, Was there Room for Healing in the Healing Sanc- tuaries? ARG 8 (2006) 63–80. J. Jouanna, Hippocrate de Cos et le sacré, JS (1989) 3–22  (= Koinonia 12 [1988] 91–113), argues that a famous expression in the Regimen καὶ  τὸ μὲν εȼχεσθαι ἀγαθόν, δεῖ δὲ καὶ αὐτὸν συλλαμβάνοντα τοɞς θεοɞς ἐπικάλεῖσθαι,  refers to a co-operation between god and physician. Note, however, that expressions  such as σɞν Ǹθηνʘ καὶ χεῖρα κίνει are proverbial (above Ch. II n. 30). Nonetheless, at  Epidauros the ‘one and only’ physician is emphatically the god.  </page> <page sequence="24"> 402 chapter five thus Geoffrey Lloyd,64 one among many, ancient65 and modern,66 to  have noticed this remarkable analogy. “Der Gott hat offenbar Medizin  studiert:” thus the summary by a German scholar.67 Of course, the god’s craft is superior to human medicine and equally  naturally is often praised as infallible. The Epidaurian iamata in par- ticular testify to this belief. Yet, there is another side. In one of his  Epistulae 20 (L IX, 386) Hippokrates writes that despite his advanced  age he has not reached perfection in his art. “For even the inventor  of the medical art, Asklepios, did not achieve that, but failed in many  cases as we can read in the scholarly literature (lit. ‘books of the prose  writers’: αἱ τῶν ξυγγραφέων βίβλοι).”68 And many are the echoes in  later medical authors all varying on the theme “that not even a god  can achieve anything he wants” (ne deum quidem posse omnia: Pliny  HN 2.27).69 Now, what does this mean? First and foremost we may conclude  that Asklepios, another “most philanthropic god,”70 represents an  ideal case—and indeed the most extreme and consistent one—of the  anthropomorphisation of a god in action, so extreme indeed that in  his case even the spatial separation between men and gods is some- times completely blurred. Asklepios is often seen walking and practis- ing his healing art among mortals, not as a mirage (οὐ φάσμα), but  64 Lloyd 1979, 40 f.; ibid. 6: “The development of ‘temple medicine’ may well owe a  good deal to—certainly it often imitates—rationalistic medicine.”  65 Hippoc.

The sons managed to do  the trick but were less successful in re-attaching the head to the body.  So Asklepios was sent for, but could not come until the following  night and in the intervening day the priest saw Aristagora lying in the  enkoimeterion with her head detached from her body.74 The somewhat naive75 emphasis on the restrictions in the freedom  of action and spatial scope of the god and the necessity of travelling  if his specific expertise is required elsewhere76 is obviously inspired by  71 The two expressions in Celsus apud Origines III.24 and Philostr. VA. 1.7, respec- tively. On these aspects see Weinreich 1909, 1 ff. The expression “not in a dream and  not in a vision but clear and alive (or real)” is near formulaic. Cf. e.g.: Maxim. Tyr.  Philosoph. 9.7 Ǹσκλήπιος ἰᾶται ν˃ν (. . . . .) εȢδον καὶ τὸν Ǹσκλήπιον, ἀλλ’ οὐχὶ ὄναρ.  See: Pfister 1924, 281 f. 72 On the Asklepieion of Troizen: C. Habicht, Pausanias’ Guide to Ancient Greece  (Berkeley 1985) 31 f.  73 Treatment at Troizen should be generally advised against: in no. 48, too, the  doctors of Troizen are belittled by the Epidaurian god. 74 Interestingly, there is a variant in Aelian. NA 9.33 (Edelstein no. 422), where the  whole story is situated in Epidauros, but the god was absent, and it was his attendants  who performed the decapitation. Decapitation seems to have been a cherished man- ner to remove worms and other funny bits from a body: cf. no. 21. Attaching severed  heads was the nec plus ultra in miracle mongery, not only in Greece. In a cycle of  Egyptian miracle stories from the late second intermediate period, around 1640–1532  BC (A.M. Blackman, The Story of King Kheops and the Magicians. Transcribed from  Papyrus Westcar, Berlin Papyrus 3033 [Reading 1988]), one of the story tellers pictures  a 110-year-old magician who is able to do the most incredible tricks culminating in  “he knows how to rejoin a severed head.”  75 The whole story would not cut a poor figure in Aristophanic comedy, as in fact  we have a fairly detailed description of the ritual concerning the Asklepieion at Pei- raeus in Ar. Plut. 660–711. On which: F. Sartori, Aristofane e il culto attico di Ascle- pio, Atti e Memorie Accad. Patavina Sc. Lett Arti 85 (1972–3) 363–378; P.

Cf. below n. 89. 76 Another case in point can be found in the narrative part added to the paean of  Isyllos (late 4th c. BC, Furley &amp; Bremer 2001, no. 6.4. F, l.72 ff.), where the sick son  of Isyllos, having arrived at Epidauros calls in the aid of Asklepios. However, since  the god is on his way to Sparta he promises: “I will come in due course of time.”  For the political position and motives of the author of the stele see: Kolde 2003 (also  eadem, Les épiclèses d’Asclépios dans l’inscription d’Isyllos d’Épidaure: implications  politiques, in: Belayche e.a. 2005, 543–555) to be read with the review of P. Sineux,  </page> <page sequence="26"> 404 chapter five the human perspective in which his medical activity is being viewed.  Doctors are always engaged elsewhere when your head needs read- justment. Accordingly, Artemidorus 2.34 ranges him with Hekate,  Pan, and Ephialtes among the epigeioi (terrestrial) and aisthetoi gods  (who can be perceived with the senses as opposed to those perceiv- able through intellect only: noetoi). So again: Asklepios displays very  human traits, including human limitations.77 However, the same passage of Artemidorus discloses an ambiguity,  for there it is added: “Asklepios who is also said to be intelligible (noe- tos) at the same time.” This means that the god is the great exception  in Artemidorus’ system in simultaneously belonging to two distinctly  opposite classes: those gods whom you can perceive with the senses  (i.e. as clear, ‘real’ shapes) and those who can be only perceived by  the intelligence (meaning: not visible in real life but only in dreams,  visions, or as phasmata).78 Splendid illustrations of this double identity  can be found in our primary sources, viz the iamata inscriptions and  the votive reliefs of Asklepios (from Epidauros, Athens and elsewhere)  as well as in those of the closely related healing hero Amphiaraos,79  Kernos 18 (2005), 538–542, and the criticism by St. Schröder, Zur Stele des Isyllos in  Epidauros, ZPE 155 (2006) 55–69. 77 The fact that he began his life as a hero, not as a god, may have contributed to  this. Wilamowitz 1955, II 220: “ein neuer Gott, der nie zu den Olympiern in den Him- mel gekommen ist, aber auf Erden mit den Menschen persönlich in Verbindung tritt,  was die Olympier längst verlernt hatten;” Edelstein II 155: “Asclepius was a demi-god;  it was in accord with his nature to live on earth, to be in constant touch with men.”  But that is certainly not the end of it. See below p. 420 f. 78 A.D. Nock 1972, II 589: “Artemidorus, though late, is a good witness for popular  beliefs at a fairly unsophisticated level.” “Perceivable by intelligence” has in Artemi- dorus the same meaning as “invisible” in Albinus. Cf. Albinus Epitome 15.1. For the  distinction between gods perceivable by senses and by intelligence, characteristic of  middle Platonism see: A.J. Festugière, Artémidore. Le clef des songes (Paris 1975) ad  loc. and numerous references in Pease ad Cic. ND I.49 on the words ut primum non  sensu sed mente cernatur. 79 Van Straten 1976, 3–5, provides the evidence from visual art. Nor were they the  only healers in ancient Greece. M.E. Gorrini, Eroi salutari della Grecia continentale tra  istanze politiche ed universali, Annali di Archeologia e Storia Antica NS 9/10 (2002/03)  163–196, presents a panorama of the cult of healing heroes in Greece, based on data  from 187 cult sites: 119 of them for Asklepios, whom she includes in the category of  healing heroes, the others for heroes such as Machaon, Podaleirios, Amphiaraos, Tro- phonios, Chiron, Korythos, Hyperteleatas, and Maleatas.

An interesting case can be found in one of the iamata (no. 17)  where it is recorded that in reality a snake (generally conceived of as an  impersonation of the god)80 was seen approaching a patient and heal- ing his ulcerated toe, while the patient himself in his dreams had seen  a very handsome youth81—the god in living form—applying a drug  on his toe. The very same double perspective is beautifully illuminated  by a votive relief from the Amphiareion at Oropos set up by a certain  Archinos.82 On the left is a picture of the vision as seen by Archinos  in his dream: the heros Amphiaraos is giving medical treatment to  the right shoulder of Archinos, who is standing before him. To the  right of this scene, and more in the background, the same Archinos  is lying asleep on a couch, while a snake is licking his right shoul- der. A pillar with a pinax symbolizes the sacred environment.83 To  the extreme right, a standing person raising his hand in  adoration is  probably Archinos again rendering thanks for his recovery. A double,  iconography and function. On similarities and differences in representation between  Asklepios and Amphiaraos: Klöckner forthcoming 2011, Ch. 3. 80 As for instance in no. 33 where the snake (= Asklepios) is transported to another  city, whereupon a sanctuary for Asklepios is built. There are several of these stories, the  best-known the introduction of the Asklepios-cult to Rome, on which most recently:  A. Blommart. Le passage des dieux de l’autre vers la Rome et l’Athènes classiques (Thèse  Paris 1997). The translatio of Asklepios to Athens is of a different nature. For detailed  discussions see: Garland 1992, 116–135; K. Clinton, The Epidauria and the Arrival of  Asclepius in Athens, in: Hägg 1994, 17–34; Parker 1996, 175–187. Garland 1992, 133  speculates on “the possible existence of an extensive network of sanctuaries dedicated  to the god and his entourage throughout Attica,” not referring to the evidence for  Asklepios’ sanctuaries in Acharnai, Prospaltai, Sounion and Pentele, as noticed by A.  Chaniotis in EBGR 1992, no. 79. Recently Wickkiser 2008, argued that the Athenians  invited the god to their city both for the healing expertise that he offered where the  traditional (Hippocratic?) methods proved unable to cope with the epidemic, and due  to his status as the signature god of Epidauros, a city critical to Athenian influence in  the Peloponnese during the Peloponnesian War. Cf. eadem, A Chariot for Asklepios:  SEG 25.226, ZPE 168 (2009) 199 ff. Another type of ‘political’ interpretation of Ask- lepieia and the publication of their miracles in: P.

In no. 31 the fair  boy and the god are clearly distinguished; in no. 25 the beautiful youth seems to be the  same as Asklepios. In that iama the youth impersonating the god operates in real life.  82 As Herzog already noticed. See: Van Straten 1976, 4 with figure 10. Cf. H.

There is another interesting ambiguity in Asklepios’  nature. The same Epidaurian Asklepios who is most emphatically  defined by, as well as bound to his profession, and who, accordingly,  displays markedly human characteristics including human frailties, is  also the god in whose Epidaurian cult we perceive the earliest traces  of a cultic ‘omnipotence’, of a nature that closely resembles—if not   anticipates—the Hellenistic and later henotheistic images that we dis- cussed in our third chapter. One of its expressions, and not the least,  is the application of miracles as a token of unrestricted power, as it  reached its climax much later in Christian miracle accounts: “Their  miraculous power reveals their god as a real god” (ἡ δὲ τούτων δύναμις  τὸν τούτων Θεὸν ἀληθινὸν ἀποφαίνει Θεόν).86 I shall illustrate the dif- ferent aspects of this religiosity with a few characteristic iamata. First  let us compare two miracle stories that are closely related, yet funda- mentally different in one respect. No. 4 A woman blind of one eye laughed at some of the cures as incred- ible and impossible (ἀπίθανα καὶ ἀδύνατα), that the lame and the blind  should be healed by merely seeing a dream. The god heals her by cut- ting the diseased eyeball and pouring in some drugs, on condition that  she would dedicate a silver pig as a memorial to her stupidity (τᾶς  ἀμαθίας). No. 9 A blind man, coming as a suppliant, was derided by some for his  silliness (εὐηθίαν) to think that he could recover his sight when one of  his eyes had not even a trace of the ball, but only the socket. In his dream  the god applies surgery and a drug and cures him. While both cures are unmistakably medical and technical with respect  to their clinical procedure, the first cure may be labelled ‘super human’  84 This is not just a piece of word-play: ὕπαρ is exclusively used as a foil of ὄναρ,  to which it owes both its form and its relevance. ɂπαρ just cannot exist without  its counterpart. Together they cover the scale of forms that epiphanies and miracles  may adopt. Cf. Chariton, 5.5.6 where a servant says to Kallirhoe, who had a dream:  “your onar is really a hupar” (ὥσπερ γὰρ ὄναρ ἔδοξας οὕτως καὶ ὕπαρ). The prayer  of gratitude in the relief takes god and man back to their ‘normal’ relationship and  communication and their ‘normal’ forms of interaction.  85 This is not the only remarkable votive relief from the Amphiareion. BCH 124  (2000) 782, presents a new ‘scène d’enkoimèsis’ (4th c. BC) which displays two persons  (male and female?) lying asleep—as far as I know, unique in this therapeutic setting. 86 Theodoretos Cyrensis, Hellenikôn Therapeutike Pathematôn VII, 65.  </page> <page sequence="29">  god: the question of divine omnipotence 407 in that it evokes a miraculous but not absolutely inconceivable treat- ment. The second, on the other hand, provides elements that are  beyond comprehension and thus merit the label ‘supernatural’ rather  than ‘superhuman’: no eye in the socket, yet recovery.87 No human  doctor could ever match this creatio ex nihilo. It thus switches our  focus from the technical-medical aspect, characteristic of the majority  of the iamata (and which is not completely lacking here), to a differ- ent category. For, indeed, there is another perspective. A considerable  number of iamata, including those generally ranged among the earli- est and most remarkable of the collection, describe the cures in terms  of what we would call genuine or ‘supernatural’ miracles,88 for instance  lacking physical intervention in the form of specific medical applica- tions on the part of the god.89 Some of the miracle stories are not about  87 As in other iamata Herzog at all costs tries to save the ‘normality’ of the medi- cal event with his suggestion “Die Augenlider können so hoch geschwollen sein, dass  das Auge darunter nicht mehr sichtbar ist (scheinbarer Hohlraum).” However, this  is in conflict with the literal wording of the text. More important, possible medical,  psychological or neurological explanations of miracle cures are one thing, the way  they were recorded in the inscriptions is another. If a text says that there was no eye  in the socket, from a religio-historical point of view the correct approach is not to  conjure the eye back by explaining the story as erratic, but to value the testimony as  it stands: a confession of belief in a supernatural (= humanly impossible) miracle. Cf.  Kee 1983, 85 on Herzog: “his commentary and introduction manifest a regrettable,  almost pathetic, effort to find features of the cult that can be deemed credible or  comprehensible from the perspective of modern medical science.” Cf. also LiDonnici  1995, 20 n. 2, and, independently, Dillon 1994, 243: “flawed assumption that all of  the iamata record cures that actually took place” while he suggests a didactic func- tion instead. Here, however, Dillon is less original than he thinks, though at least  more subtle than Wilamowitz 1955, II 227, who speaks of “den Schwindel mit den  iamata.” H.J. Stam &amp; N.P. Spanos, The Asclepian Dream Healings and Hypnosis: A  Critique, The International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis 30 (1982)  9–22, already strongly challenged the no-nonsense medical interpretations of modern  scholars (“prone to anachronistic misinterpretation”, providing a full bibliography),  and argue that the cures may be better understood by considering them in their cul- tural context (although not making very clear what exactly that is supposed to mean).  For a more cautious discussion of pathological and clinical evidence in the iamata see:  Cl. Prêtre &amp; Ph. Charlier, Maladies humaines, thérapies divines: analyse épigraphique  et paléopathologique de textes de guérison grecs (Villeneuve 2009). 88 Herzog p. 60 reminds us that for the Roman Catholic church only those cures are  counted as divine miracles that cannot be explained in the frame of rules of natural  law.  89 In Ar. Plut. 696–736, Asklepios is mockingly depicted in both roles. First with  respect to Neokleides as a genuine physician (716–725), then confronting Ploutos as  miracle worker assisted by his snakes (726–737). Cures by simply touching a patient  with the hand are a special category (nos. 31, B 11). Cf. 62 = C19: An epileptic is  healed by the god pressing his ring [τˑ δακτυλίˎ]—not “with his fingers” as LiDon- nici translates—upon him. Asklepios is Ȍπιόχειρ in an inscription: SEG 50, 1086. On  </page> <page sequence="30"> 408 chapter five cures at all but record different types of miraculous intervention. It is  the category which Herzog 1931, 51, qualifies as: “den Naturgesetzen  und der Vernunft widersprechend (ἀδύνατον)” as opposed to the cat- egory that is “nur unerwartet (παράδοξον) oder gar normale Heilung.”  LiDonnici 1992, 27 calls these miracles “radical and miraculous, sug- gesting a religious exploration of the nature of the possible, rather than  a view of the god as a specifically medically-oriented figure.” I give  here a few summaries of the most telling cases: No. 1 A five years’ pregnancy coming to an end by a prompt delivery  after a healing sleep.90 As soon as it was born the new born child washed  itself at the fountain and walked about with his mother. The story— appropriately enough—ends with the eulogy: “Admirable is not the  size of the tablet (on which the miracle was published), but the divine  (power) (τὸ θεῖον).” Of a different nature are the following two punitive miracles: No. 11 Aeschines, when the suppliants were already asleep, climbed up  a tree and tried to peer over into the Abaton. He fell from the tree and  his eyes were injured. He came as a suppliant to the god, slept in the  temple and was healed. No. 36 (B16) A man laughed at the cures of Asklepios and said: “If the  god says he has healed lame people he is lying; for, [if he had the power  to do so, why has he not healed Hephaistos?].”91 But the god did not  conceal that he was inflicting a penalty for the insolence. (ὁ δὲ θεὸς τᾶς  ὕβριος ποινὰς λαμβάνω[ν οὐκ ἔλαθε]). For soon after the man fell from  his horse and was crippled. Later when he had supplicated the god ear- nestly (πολλὰ καθικετεύ[σαντα . .), the god made him well. Again different are two miracles not related to human health: No. 10 A porter went up to the temple and by a fall broke all the ves- sels in his bag, including the goblet of his master. When he tried to fit  this type see the exhaustive discussion in Weinreich 1909, 1–66; K. Sudhoff, Handan- legung des Heilgottes auf attischen Weihetafeln, Archiv f. Geschichte der Medizin 18  (1926) 235–250; K. Gross, Menschenhand und Gotteshand in Antike und Christentum  (edited by W. Speyer, Stuttgart 1985) 433; 444 ff; 494 ff.  90 Although five years is unparalleled in our evidence, the wish to make a (felici- tous) end to a pregnancy is not without parallels. M.L. Lazzarini, in: P. Radici Colace  (ed.), Atti del II seminario internazionale di studi lessici tecnici Greci e Latini (Messina- Napoli 1999) 353–363, discusses the terms παυσιτοκεῖα (thanksgiving for stopping  pregnancy and birthpains) and τελέουμα (the accomplishment of pregnancy). 91 Herzog’s brilliant but bold conjecture inspired by Aristophanes Anargyros (frs.  41–63 Kock = frs. 41–66 Kassel-Austin). </page> <page sequence="31">  god: the question of divine omnipotence 409 the pieces together a passer-by said: “Foolish fellow (ἄθλιε), why do  you put the goblet together in vain? For this one not even Asklepios of  Epidaurus could put to rights again.” The man put the pieces back in  the bag and went on to the temple and having arrived and on opening  his bag, there the goblet was entirely whole. Later the master dedicated  the goblet to the god.92 47 (C4) A fish porter promises to dedicate to the god a tithe of the  profit but fails to keep his promise. After arriving in Arcadia it appears  that alarming things have happened to his fishes.93 While a large crowd  attends the spectacle, the porter confesses his deceit (ὄχλου δὲ πολλο˃  περιστάντος ε[ἰς] τὰν θεωρίαν, (. . . .) δηλοῖ τὰν ἐξαπάταν ǵπασα[ν]).  After having earnestly supplicated the god (ἐξικετεύσαντος δ’αὐτο˃ τὸν  [θεὸν. . . .) the god performs a miracle and the man dedicates the tithe. In many of these and similar miracles the emphasis is not so much  on the nature of the miracle as a healing event- and not at all on its  technical or medical aspects—but rather on the opposition between  human frailty, in terms of thoughtlessness, lack of attention to the  god’s words, incredulity, lack of confidence94 or inappropriate fear95  92 On the continuity of this typical fairy tale miracle see: O. Weinreich, Das Mirakel  vom zerbrochenen und wieder geheilten Gefäss, Ausgewählte Schriften I. 87 f.  93 In his first edition Herzog made them bite the fish porter and stop only after  Asklepios’ intervention. In a reconsideration (R. Herzog, Zu den iamata von Epidau- ros, Eph. Arch. [1937] 522–526), the fish turn out to be in a state of decomposition  and after the divine intervention many of them are stone-dead. Not really a baffling  miracle. W. Peek, Fünf Wundergeschichten aus dem Asklepieion von Epidauros, Abh.  Sächs. Ak. Wis. 56.2 (Leipzig 1963) and L. Robert BE 1964, 36–9, suggest different  interpretations. The text is simply too corrupt to allow reasonable (let alone unreason- able) guesswork, as once more becomes apparent from the recent treatment by Dillon  1994, 253 and 260. Let us leave it at ‘the miracle of the fishy things’. 94 Stupidity, thoughtlessness, and lack of gratitude toward the god and their conse- quences: nos. A 2, 3, 7, 11, B 2, 15, 16. Cf. also Artem. 5.9. 95 Not only in Epidaurus. Cf. I.Cret I. XVII no. 18: ὁ [θε]ὸς ἐκέλευσέν με π[ροσ] καρτερεῖν κ[αὶ ἔδ]ωκεν θεραπείαν. In the Paean of Isyllos l.74, the first word of Ask- lepios appearing in an epiphany is θάρσει. On which see: Kolde 2003, 198–206. This  expression “do not fear” vel sim. is formulaic in miracle stories (especially epiphanies)  both pagan and Christian. See for instance: H. Engelmann, The Delian Aretalogy of  Sarapis (Leiden 1975) 51; TWNT s.v. θαρρέω. In a Thessalian inscription of the 2nd c.  BC (M. Lilimbaki-Akamaki, To archaiologiko ergo sti Makedonia kai Thraki 5 [1991  (1994)] 83–95; BE 1994, 414; SEG 44.546), the city of Amphipolis prays to the god  ∆άρρων, who is according to Hesychius a Macedonian healing god, most probably  Asklepios. Perhaps ∆άρρων = θάρρων, “the encourager.” However, a new honorary  inscription of the φρατρία τῶν ∆αρρωνιστῶν from Mylasa in Karia (W. Blümel, Neue  Inschriften aus Karia II: Mylasa und Umgebung, EA 37 [2004] 15 no. 20) may sug- gest a different meaning of this name. J.-M. Carbon, ∆ΑƔƔƛΝ and ∆ΑƌΜƛΝ: A New  Inscription from Mylasa, EA 38 (2005) 1–6, suggests that Darron is rather the name  of a Hero. </page> <page sequence="32"> 410 chapter five on the one hand and the absolute, unrestricted power of the god on  the other. “Great is the divine (power)” exclaims the woman in no. 1,  echoed by a woman in Ar. Plut. 748, who praises Asklepios with the  words “how immense is your power, o king, master.” (ȷσην ἔχεις τὴν  δύναμιν, Ɋναξ, δέσποτα), or, much later, in Aristides’ Oratio 42, for  Asklepios, 4 ff., where he claims that “the god possesses all powers”  (πάσας ἔχων ὁ θεὸς τὰς δυνάμεις).96 In later times the acclamation  “Great is Asklepios” in reaction to his miraculous cures becomes a  fixed ritual expression.97 In these miracle stories the god is not only  able to do healing tricks that are superior to those performed by mortal  doctors, but he accomplishes things that are naturally  inconceivable. Also in other respects we perceive notable differences as compared  to the ‘normal’ medical examples. Let us first pay attention to a formu- laic aspect that, if noticed at all,98 has been undervalued: the patients in  this category of supernatural miracles are often explicitly introduced  as “coming as a suppliant” (ἀφίκεσθαι/ἔρχεσθαι ἱκέτας/ἱκέτις).99 This  regards nos. 1, 2, 3 (with emphasis), 4 (the only mixed case: there is  surgery, but also punishment), 9 (the transitional case of the missing  96 The same address is used by Aelius Aristides Or. 30, 14 and 28: Ɋ δέσποτ’  Ǹσκληπιέ, on which see: J.-L. Vix, Les épiclèses d’Asclépios dans les Discours XXX et  XXXIII d’Aelius Aristide, in: Belayche e.a. 2005, 557–564. 97 See also below p.# with nn. 111 ff. The same is attested in the cult of other all- powerful gods in this period such as Isis. Also in the context of healing: Tibullus  1.3.27–8: Nunc, dea succurre mihi, nam posse mederi picta docet templis multa tabel- lis tuis. See for an ample discussion of Isis as an almighty goddess: Versnel 1990,  Ch. 1, and generally on the characteristics of these Hellenistic ‘supergods’ ibid. pp.  189–205, and above pp.#. Similarly the Gods of the Maeonian confession texts (col- lected with extensive commentaries by Petzl 1994) who are constantly acclaimed as  ‘great’, a greatness that is explained as being attested by their miracles, both punitive  and healing ones. Cf. above pp.#. The physician Aretaios from Cappadocia 4.1.1 tells  us that the most severe illnesses can be only healed either by luck or by the gods,  rather than by human craft (τὰ γὰρ μέζονα πάντα ἰῶνται μο˃νοι θεοί). 98 LiDonnici 1995, 20, in her linguistic analysis of course does not fail to note it,  but does not use it for semantic interpretation: “The motifs used to tell the tale are  used here specifically for the purpose of identifying compositional strands within the  corpus.” 99 Graf 1992, 191 notes that the patients come as ἱκέται (Pausanias uses the term  for Epidauros [2.27.2] and Tithoreia [10.32.12]), but views it as a reference to the total  reversal of the supplicant’s surroundings referring to J. Gould, Hiketeia, JHS 93 (1973)  74–103: A hiketes is somebody who is separated from his familiar social surroundings  and who, contrary to normal behaviour, humbles himself. </page> <page sequence="33">  god: the question of divine omnipotence 411 eyeball), 11,100 36, 47.101 There is no reference to supplication in any  of the ‘normal/natural medical’ iamata. Supplication, for that mat- ter, sometimes specified as prostration or kneeling,102 is more often  referred to in the cult of Asklepios, more so than in that of any other  Greek god. While προσκυνῆσαι—as in Edelstein no. 438 = IG XIV 966  (2 c. AD) in a context of public demonstration (paradeigmatismos cf.  iama no. 47 cited above p. 409)—is an ambiguous term,103 we have one  testimony that is both unequivocal and illuminative. In the very same  period of our iamata, the cynic Diogenes gave vent to his indignation  about the ungraceful attitude of women kneeling before the gods and  he dedicated to Asklepios a bruiser, who was to beat up people that fell  on their faces.104 This is all the more remarkable since we find similar  100 Additionally mentioning “the suppliants.” Paus. 2.27.2 referring to a building  where the “suppliants of the god (ἱκέται το˃ θεο˃) go to sleep” seems to indicate that  also in his time the term is in general use for those who seek healing in Epidauros, but  in our iamata it occurs only in a very special context. More generally, [Hippokrates]  Morb. Sacr. 4 = 1.41 (Grensemann) tells us what should have been done with those  suffering from epilepsy if the cause had been divine: εȼχεσθαι καὶ ἐς τὰ ἱρὰ φέροντας  ἱκετεύειν τοɞς θεούς. Likewise Thucydides 2.47.4 on the plague speaks of ὅσα τε πρὸς  ἱεροῖς ἱκέτευσαν.  101 If we take the sole verb ἀφίκεσθαι as a short-hand expression for ‘coming as a  suppliant’, which is arguable (Gould, o.c. [above n. 99], 84, n. 51; M. Giordano, La  supplica: Rituale, istituzione sociale e tema epico in Omero [Naples 1999], 193–210;  Pulleyn 1997, 59 n. 8), the following nos. should be included: 5, 10, 22, 25, 26, 28, 37,  45, 46. However, in the iamata the verb does also occur in the unmarked meaning of  arriving somewhere. 102 A very explicit text: Ael. Arist. Or. 50.435: καὶ ἔδει τὸ γόνυ τὸ δέξιον κλίναντα  ἱκετεύειν τε καὶ καλεῖν Λύσιον τὸν θεόν. On kneeling in Greek ritual context see: Van  Straten 1974; Aubriot 1992, 407–438; Bettinetti 2001, 161–183; Klöckner forthcoming  2011, 2.2.5.5.2, who notes that on votive reliefs kneeling is practically restricted to  women. See for (scarce) instances of prostration in Greek secular supplication: F.S.  Naiden, Ancient Supplication (Oxford 2006), Appendix 1a, pp. 301–323. Idem, Hiketai  and Theoroi at Epidauros, in: Elsner &amp; Rutherford 2005, 73–95, analyses the differ- ences between the two forms of pilgrimage in Epidauros and at pp. 80–90 discusses  the iamata mentioning hiketeia.  103 It may express a variety of different adorative gestures, including but not  restricted to kneeling.  104 Diog. Laert. 6.37–8. Cf. Arnob. Adv. Nat. 1.49, mentioning “severely ill peo- ple who went as suppliants (supplices) through all temples, although they prostrated  (prostrati) themselves before the gods and swept the very thresholds with their lips,  although with their prayers they wearied Asklepios himself.” Different because of the  Egyptian implications of the term proskunema (on which see: E. Bernand, Réflexions  sur les proscynèmes, in: D. Conso, N. Fick &amp; B. Poulle [edd.], Mélanges F. Kerlouégan  [Paris 1994] 43–60) is POxy 1381, 131 (2 AD): After a dream healing of the author  by Asklepios Imouthes the mother “did reverence to the manifestation of the god”  (τὴν μὲ[ν] το˃ θε[ο]˃ προσεκύνησε[ν] ἐπιφάνειαν). Generally, exuberant forms of  prostration were seen as tokens of superstitious behaviour. Plut. De superst. 166b ff.  </page> <page sequence="34"> 412 chapter five instances of proskunesis, “kneeling for the god,” in the same period in  votive reliefs of a few other (healing) gods, but not least in those of  Asklepios. All this is in gratifying concordance with observations we have made  previously (Ch. 3, espec. p. 290 f.) in our discussion of the emergence  of henotheistic perceptions in Greek theology. There we observed that  human need and the awareness of being totally dependent on a divine  saviour invariably entail a complex pattern of behaviour and percep- tion. The human suppliant becomes ‘smaller’, even literally making  himself smaller by prostrating, kneeling, touching the saviour’s knees,  the supplicatory attitude par excellence which can boast a rich etho- logical prehistory.105 All this is substantiated by recent research on lan- guage and contexts of supplication.106 After Aubriot 1992, Ch. V had  argued that hiketeia involves a total self-abasement of the petitioner,  λιτή on the other hand being less grovelling, Pulleyn 1997, 57 quali- fied ἱκετεύειν as “intensified language of entreaty.” The natural (and  naturally superior) reaction of a god to hiketeia is perfectly worded  in the Isis aretalogy of Kume l. 36: “I have ordained by law having  mercy on suppliants” (Ȇγὼ ἱκέτας ἐλεᾶν ἐνομοθέτησα). And indeed,  Asklepian religion is essentially a “religion of emergencies.”107 In the  ironic words of Plutarch:108 “if nobody is ill. . . . we will neither sacri- fice to Asklepios nor to the Apotropaioi” (μηδένος νοσούντος . . . οὐδ’  Ǹσκληπιˑ θύσομεν οὐδ’ Ǹποτροπαίοις). Conversely, the god undergoes a fundamental change as well. Like  other gods Asklepios becomes more majestic, more encompassing,  derides deisidaimonia as characterized by ῥίψεις ἐπὶ πρόσωπον, αἰσχρὰς προκαθίσεις,  ἀλλοκότους προσκυνήσεις (“unusual forms of proskunesis”), but only few pages later  (169d) he lists among the most agreeable things for humans: “religious festivals, feasts  belonging to sacrificial ritual, mysteries and prayers to the gods and . . . προσκυνήσεις!”  Once more it turns out that the context is entirely responsible for the meaning or  rather for the assessment of the term.  105 Burkert 1979, 43–45; 1996a, 121.

Plut. 748 “How immense is thy power,  o lord,” which we already saw above,113 exactly as in the cults of the  great Hellenistic gods. Asklepios is also the first god to whom a trag- edy bearing his name was dedicated by Aristarchos, a contemporary of  Euripides, as a charisterion for a cure and at the god’s request. While  in one of the iamata (no. 7) the patient promises that after his recovery  he will have an image inscribed and dedicate it to the god, in other  stories it is the god himself who after a miracle demands that it all be  written down (ἐκέλευσεν δὲ καὶ ἀναγράψαι τα˃τα).114 109 The verticalisation in the relationship between smaller mortals and bigger gods  in Hellenistic times is amply documented in literature, epigraphy and visual art.

The final line runs:  τα˃τα τοι, Ɋ μέγ’ ἄριστε θεῶν, ἀνέθηκεν Ȩσυλλος, τιμῶν σὴν ἀρετήν, one of the very  first instances of the term ἀρετή in the sense of miraculous power or achievement,  so common in Hellenistic and later inscriptions.

It is also at Lebena that the god himself twice  instructs a patient in a dream vision to come to his sanctuary in order to be healed  during incubation: ICret. I. xvii, 9. Cf. P.

Also in different contexts word and image could function  as tools for instruction, as for instance the girl who dedicated a pinax with pictures of  the gods: τόδε δῶρον διδασκαλίας θύεν τˑ βωλομένˎ ἐπιτελέστων ἀγαθῶν: M.

Hence, we should not be surprised to find  other concomitant ‘henotheistic’ features, as discussed in chapter III,  in the ‘supernatural’ iamata quoted and many others: hyperbolisation  of expressions of power and abilities, punishment of unbelievers115 or  of those who venture to injure the time of the great god,116 forgiveness  and healing after the confession and self-humiliation of the patient,117  as well as demonstrative and advertising behaviour (paradeigmatismos)  of god and priesthood through their epigraphical records.118 Over half  of these ‘supernatural’ miracles belong to the first ten items of stele A  and it has often been noted that the iamata of stele A, especially nos.  1–10 (and more especially 1–4), with their “clearly impossible tales”119  and their retaliatory warnings against derision have a programmatic  function. They stress the fact that there is no limit to the god’s power.  “Asklepios here operates in an unexpected, majestic way, not in the  manner of doctors but like a god.”120 Of course, several of the features  under discussion also occur in miracles lacking the language of sup- plication, but again only in miracles of the ‘supernatural’ type. dedications κατὰ κέλευσιν, iussu etc. as well as the εἷς and μέγας acclamations bear  witness to the same mentality.  115 Also in the much later confession texts a person is punished διὰ τὸ ἀπιστῖν and  another κολασθεῖσα . . .καὶ μὴ πιστεύουσα τˑ θεˑ: Petzl 1994, nos. 10 and 12.  116 Weinreich 1909, index s.v.

B 1–5 are  all concerned with “action at a distance” and the tales are more grisly.  120 LiDonnici 1992, 38. Cf. Dillon 1994, 251: “instructions concerning the power  of the god.”  </page> <page sequence="37">  god: the question of divine omnipotence 415 Particularly interesting is the ‘confession of guilt’, mentioned three  times, once in no. 47 (above p. 409, a truly ‘supernatural’ cure), twice  (nos. 54 and 58) with the explicit verb ὡμολόγησε,121 unfortunately  in sorely mutilated texts. For this reason these three texts have been  explained as the first tokens of an Oriental influence, where omnipo- tent gods and sinful and confessing mortals abound.122 This is both  unnecessary and unlikely: they should rather be regarded as the first  independent and hesitating signs of a mentality which in its institution- alized form and with much greater rigidity and harshness expressed  itself in the cults of Oriental gods and of the Lydian-Phrygian Anaeitis  and Men.123 This is substantiated by the fact that exactly in the Epi- daurian cult of Asklepios we find the first epigraphical instance of a  pseudo-sacred law prescribing that “to enter a temple one should be  pure; to be pure means having pious thoughts” (φρονεῖν ὅσια).124 But  a certain phenomenological and psychological relationship cannot be  denied, particularly in the status of the all-powerful god as opposed to  121 The verb belongs to the fixed formulas of the Maeonian confession stelai and  occurs once as a variant of the formulaic ἐξαγορεύειν in the curses from Knidos, both  belonging to the same religious atmosphere as the one we are discussing. See: Versnel  1991, 75–80; 1995; 2009.  122 F. Kudlien, Beichte und Heilung, Medizinhistorisches Journal 13 (1978) 1–14,  espec. 6: “vereinzelte Fälle die vielleicht orientalischem Einfluss, vielleicht auch ein- fach einer Dramatisierung durch die Priester zuzuschreiben sind.” He also (4/5) refers  to the comparable paradeigmatismos, “Zurschaustellung” in these oriental miracles  and in no. 47. In this sense already Herzog 1931, 57. 123 Pleket 1981, 180 n. 135. For a full discussion of these different positions see  Versnel 1990, 197–204. Moreover, there are important differences as well: even if  Asklepios may be angry, his most characteristic feature is clemency and mildness:  Pindar. Pyth. 3.48–54 = Edelstein no. 1; Arist. Or. 42.1 and 5; Nilsson GGR I. 806:  “Das Geheimnis der Popularität des Asklepios liegt nicht nur darin, dass der leidende  Mensch einen Gott fand, der ihn half, sondern auch darin, dass er einen Gott fand  der mit ihm fühlte.” These are not particularly the first qualities one would associate  with Oriental gods or the ones of Asia Minor. Anyway, the presence of ‘confession of  guilt’ in the 4th c. Epidaurean iamata hardly supports the argument of E.J. Schnabel,  Divine Tyranny and Public Humiliation: A suggestion for the Interpretation of the  Lydian and Prygian Confession Inscriptions, Novum Testamentum 45 (2003) 160–188,  that the major cause for public confession was the perceived necessity to reinforce  the control of the local god over her/his devotees as a reaction to the spreading of the  Christian faith in the area.  124 Edelstein no. 318, handed down by Porphyrios de abst. 2.19.5; Clemens Al.  Strom. 5.1.13.3, after Theophrastus. Chaniotis 1997b, 142–179, espec. 152 ff., notes  that apart from the cults of ‘Oriental’ gods, it is especially in the cult of Asklepios that  the term ὅσια φρονεῖν occurs. He also recognizes the requirement of inner—that is  moral—pureness in iamata nos. 6 and 7 and connects it with the natural imputation  of bodily afflictions to human misconduct.  </page> <page sequence="38"> 416 chapter five the insignificant human creature. In sum, these iamata, as opposed to  the more modest ‘natural’ medical ones, stress the fact that there is no  limit to the god’s power. Altogether, this leaves us with an embarrassing paradox. Edelstein’s  observation: “the god’s cures were medical cures. Asclepius was not  a wizard whose hocus pocus perplexes men, nor was he one of those  gods who nod fulfilment of the wishes of their suppliants. He acted as  a physician”, though widely adopted in subsequent studies, appears to  be a misleading simplification. In exposing the professional specializa- tion of the god, this statement reveals only part of the truth. Edelstein  II 154 n. 34, himself has to admit: “this is true only of the god of  incubations. When Asclepius was approached in prayers and granted  help, he acted like all other deities.” He is referring here to the many  private and public cult-activities, supplications and prayers outside the  medical centres of the god.125 The truth, however, is—and this is what my whole exposition aimed  to show—that Asklepios’ double identity is not only correlative with  the distinction between Epidaurian and different types of cultic ambi- ences. It appears that in the Epidaurian iamata, too, Asklepios unites  two different strands of perception in one divine persona. One is very  much determined by and restricted to his professional craft, which  inevitably attracts stereotyped characteristics of that profession: medi- cal manipulation, drugs, success and failure. If successful the god  receives a fee, which, just as in the human world, is literally referred  to as a doctor’s honorarium: ἴατρα.126 But the treatment may also fail  for the simple reason that physicians may fail. While the epigraphical  iamata in accordance with their name and function were not particu- larly eager to record failures, in reality people did die, even (or rather  especially) in the Asklepieia. A specially designated building outside  125 See: Edelstein II 182 ff. Artemidorus 2.37 seems to allude to a comparable  dichotomy when he draws a distinction between two types of dream, one in which  Asklepios figures as a ‘normal’ god, and one in which he is seen as the professional  physician: “If Asklepios is set up in a temple and stands upon a pedestal, if he is seen  and adored, it means good luck for all. But if he moves and approaches or goes into a  house, it prophesies sickness and famine. For then especially men need this god.” 126 In the iamata nos. 5, 22, 25. Further: IG IV2 126 = Syll.3 1170.

The rare word σῶστρα can take  a related meaning, as in an inscription from Rome where a doctor, who calls himself  the helper (βοηθός) of Asklepios, gives him σῶστρα καὶ [χα]ριστήρια (IG XIV 967 a1  b1).

Clarysse, ZPE 113 (1996) 214.  </page> <page sequence="39">  god: the question of divine omnipotence 417 the sacred area was reserved for the dying.127 And according to Hip- pokrates (as we saw earlier p. 402) the scholarly literature mentioned  many cases in which Asklepios’ interventions remained unsuccessful.  In this perspective, then, even Asklepios is curtailed by the laws of  nature. His medical treatment is infinitely more effective than human  therapy: the god accomplishes what according to Hippokrates (On  Joints ch. 46) is humanly impossible, arguing that “one might do this  (namely applying deep surgery) with a corpse, but definitely not with  a living patient.” But it is not different in kind. The god manifests  himself from his most anthropomorphic side, his feats belong in the  category of human actions. And viewed from this perspective he can- not do anything he wishes: he is not omnipotent.128 127 In the sanctuary itself, of course, like all sanctuaries, it was not permitted to give  birth or die: Paus. 2.27.6. Cf. Parker 1983, 33 ff.  128 The emphasis on the typically medical aspects of treatment and cures, already  present in the oldest iamata, comes more and more into prominence over the centu- ries. There is also a shift from sensationally miraculous surgery to more earthy kinds  of regimen-oriented therapy, a development which has been explained as “the sig- nificant shift in life-world from Hellenistic times in Epidaurus to the sophisticated  ambience of Smyrna and Pergamum in the Antonine period” (Kee 1982, 129. See  also: L. Cohn-Haft, The Public Physicians of Ancient Greece [1956] 28 f.). This is also  manifest in the miracles at Lebena (IIa), ICret. I, nos. 8–16, on which see: Guarducci  ad loc. p. 159; M. Melfi, Il santuario di Asclepio a Lebena (Athens 2007) Ch. 3. Sur- gery, however, seems to have gone out of fashion: Aelius Aristides, Sacred Tales 4.64,  reports that surgical dreams still occurred two generations before him, but he himself  does not record them from his own experience. On the popularity of Asklepios-reli- gion especially in the Antonine age see: G. Bowersock, Greek Sophists in the Roman  Empire (1969) 70–74; Lane Fox 1986, 151 f.; Kee 1982.

Detailed instructions  as given by Asklepios and other healing gods resounding in sources of the imperial  period were of course grist for the mill of Christian authors such as Arnobius Adv.  Nationes 1.48, who claims: indecorum deo est, non ipsum per se posse, sed externorum  adminiculis rerum sanitatem incolumitatemque praestare. The Christian God, so it  is claimed, can do miracles just by his free will and the absolute power of his word.  He does not need physical means or natural resources nor are his actions subject to  the limitations of Aristotelian principles of causation or teleology. Various different  attacks by apologists on Asklepios are collected by Edelstein I nos. 103, 233 (Tertul- lian); 128, 584 (Arnobius); 294, 298–299 (Eusebius) and cf. II, pp. 52, 62, 109.

All the more ironic, then, that Christian saints simply adopted Asklepios’ medi- cal and oneirical techniques, most noticeably in the miracles of Thecla (G. Dagron, Vie  et miracles de Sainte Thècle (Brussels 1978), especially his discussion at pp. 103–108;  S.F. Johnson, The Life and Miracles of Thekla.

Here the god does not primarily act as a  physician but as a god, a god, moreover, who boasts absolute power to  perform miracles of all sorts—including oracular ones—and without  any curative device or physical manipulation. Restrictions of what- ever kind are now out of the picture and beyond question. The focus  shifts from qualities shared by gods and men to those in which they  differ, radically differ. This perspective does not tolerate restrictions  as to type of miracle. Here the god can do anything he wants and he  knows everything: he is omnipotent and omniscient.129 Here the words  of Plutarch Vita Coriolani 38.4 are very much to the point long before  they were written: For the deity has no resemblance whatever to man, either in nature,  activity, skill, or strength; nor, if he does something that we cannot do,  or contrives something that we cannot contrive (οὐδ’ εἴ τι ποιεῖ τῶν ἡμῖν  ἀποιήτων καὶ μηχανᾶται τῶν ἀμηχάνων), is this contrary to reason. But  rather, since he differs from us in all points, in his works most of all is  he unlike us and far removed from us. But most of the deity’s powers, as  Herakleitos says, “escape our knowledge through incredulity.” Exactly in this context of ἀπίθανα καὶ ἀδύνατα, in the words of one  of the iamata that we have seen, or ἀποίητα καὶ ἀμήχανα as we read  here, we observe a very remarkable shift in the religious representation  which ‘translates’ this immense distance between god and man into  the nearly ‘oriental’ expressions mentioned above.

Christ became the great rival of Asklepios in later antiquity, an imitatio much  discussed in modern scholarship. See e.g. E. Dinkler, Christus und Asklepios. Zum  Christustypus der polychromen Platten im Mus. Naz. Romano (Sb. Heidelberg 1980);  R.J. Rüttimann, Asclepius and Jesus.

Cf. Croon 1986, 1218 on Isis and Sarapis: “Bei all dem darf  man aber nicht ausser Acht lassen, daß ihre Funktion als Heilgötter zwar bedeut- sam, aber doch nur eine Nebenfunktion war. Beide Gottheiten präsentierten sich als  Allgötter mit Allmacht.” The interesting thing is that Asklepios, starting his career as  a medical specialist ascended to the position of a superior god, but preserved both  aspects, each of which might dominate the picture according to the perspective of  the observer. </page> <page sequence="41">  god: the question of divine omnipotence 419 Asklepios, then, is the best illustration of this fundamental ambiguity in  divine nature. To this god applies an expression by Hippokrates: “they  are all divine and all human” (πᾶντα θεῖα καὶ πᾶντα ἀνθρώπινα).130  The divergent reactions to the miracles as recorded in the iamata pro- vide a splendid illustration of this ambiguity: some people accepted  Asklepios as a physician but did not believe the really incredible and  impossible tricks. Others, first of all the god himself, no doubt very  much prompted by his ground crew, argued that the god was god not  just a doctor and hence did not tolerate incredulity. Hence the corpus  of iamata opens with the most spectacular and breath-taking tales. I  am not claiming that we should always and at all costs try to draw a  distinction between superhuman and supernatural.131 A votive inscrip- tion from Asia Minor (circa 250 AD) set up as a charisterion for a  cure thanks the goddess Leto because she ἐξ ἀδυνάτων δυνατὰ πυεῖ  (= ποιεῖ).132 Some commentators take it as an ‘Oriental’ expression,  well-known from biblical literature, and translate: “who makes the  impossible possible,” others “because from things without strength she  maketh things that are strong.” The two alternatives, supernatural and  superhuman, are both available in one and the same Greek expression.  The phrasing in itself does not allow to make a choice and perhaps we  should leave it at that.133 130 [Hippokrates] Morb. Sacr 21 (Loeb) 18.2 (Grensemann), speaking on diseases  in general including epilepsy. On the vexed question of the divine status of illnesses  see fundamentally: Ph.J. van der Eijk, The Theology of the Hippocratic Treatise On  the Sacred Disease, Apeiron 23 (1990) 87–119 = idem (revised version), Medicine and  Philosophy in Classical Antiquity: Doctors and Philosophers on Nature, Soul, Health  and Disease (Cambridge 2005) 45–73. 131 Arctinus, Ilioupersis (fr. 4 Bernabé, Sch. Il. 11.515c Erbse; Eustathius 859.42 on  Il. 13.515, Loeb p. 525) neatly keeps the two types of curative abilities apart when he  attributes to Machaon the art of surgery and healing of wounds, but to Podaleirios  “full and perfect knowledge to recognize hidden diseases and cure desperate sick- nesses” (ἄσκοπά τε γνῶναι καὶ ἀναλθέα ἰήσασθαι).  132 Petzl 1994, no. 122, with the literature; Versnel 1981a, 53 n. 218.

Or. 3.30, claims that “of all men under the sun that  man is most powerful and not inferior to the gods themselves who is able τὰ ἀδύνατα  δοκο˃ντα ποιῆσαι δυνατά.”  133 Nor would I know how to classify the unique cooperation attested in a miracle  story on record at the isle Gozo near Malta where Maria Tapinu is praised for her  supernatural omniscience in prompting the doctor in attendance toward the correct  diagnosis so that he could cure the patient in accordance with the laws of nature (with  thanks to Rolf Tybout). </page> <page sequence="42"> 420 chapter five Is this ambiguity specific to Asklepios because he is one of the “newly  enrolled citizens in heaven,” belonging to “those who are made gods  out of men,” or “who are named gods”134 and hence, as we saw, was  a ‘terrestrial’ god close to mortal men? Surely, mythical origins may  have played a part in his functional history. First, however, from the  perspective of private religiosity it is unwise, often even demonstrably  unfounded, to draw an all too sharp distinction between god and hero,  as we briefly discussed in our first chapter.135 Secondly, without any  doubt Asklepios was a god, already long before the period in which  Epidauros came to flourish,136 and grew more accustomed to that role  134 Thus Cicero ND 3.15.39; Arnob. Adv. Nat. 3.39; Justin. Apol. 25.1, respectively.  These expressions closely correspond with Pausanias’ terminology: θεοɞς νομɛζειν and  θεοὶ ἐξ ἀνθρώπων in Pausanias: Pirenne-Delforge 2008, 248–258. 135 Croon 1986, 1206, summarizes a widespread (Kern, Weinreich and others) idea:  “Wie immer auch der wahre Ursprung des Asklepios gewesen sein mag, der Glaü- bige sah in ihm den Gott der Mensch gewesen war, und eben weil er selbst Mensch  gewesen war, konnte er der menschlichste und menschenfreundlichste Gott wer- den.” See on the early nature of Asklepios, Riethmüller I, 2005, “Heros oder Gott,”  51–54; of Amphiaraos: Sineux 2007, Ch. 2, “Le heros, le dieu.” Cf. more generally,  the interesting discussion between E. Kearns and F.T van Straten, in Le sanctuaire  grec (Entretiens Hardt 37 [Vandoeuvres-Genève 1992]) 103 f. On the basis of many  archaeological and epigraphical testimonies the last named shows that in private reli- gion heroes are revered in no more mean fashion than gods. The first named explains  that in private religion the emphasis is not on distinctions between god and hero but  on those between hero and man. “In the case of individual heroes it was also often no  doubt the case that their specific function guaranteed them an importance and rank- ing, in the view of either individual or group, higher than the general status of ‘hero’,  viewed in connection with that of ‘god’, would suggest.” This may explain the strange  situation at the sanctuary of Lebadeia, where the hero Trophonios boasts a higher  position than some divine beings. Van Straten also refers to the fact that ȑρως ἰατρός  in one and the same inscription (IG II2 839) is alternatively called ȑρως and θεός, and  Kearns gives some more instances of such double identities. This should be kept in  mind even if it were true that the bothros found on the terrace of the Asklepieion in  Athens marked it as heroon: J.W. Riethmüller, “Bothros” and Tetrastyle, the “Heroon”  of Asclepius in Athens, in: Hägg 1999, 123–143; idem 2005, I, 267–273. But see the  refutation by A.

A new and fascinating suggestion, not noticed by  Riethmüller I, 2005, 33 f. in his discussion of the etymology of the name, is that the  name (and figure of) Asklepios, not etymologically explainable in Greek language,  should be connected with Akkadian Azgallat&gt; Asgelatas, the great physician: Burkert  1992, 78, with more Near Eastern connections, including the dogs.

BC)  v.77 addresses him: “O greatest of the gods” (μέγ’ ἄριστε θεῶν).137  To call him a “marginal healer” is—certainly for this period—a stark  misrepresentation. Is the Epidaurian religiosity, as we analysed it, a completely new  and unique trend in fourth century Greek religion and hence not rep- resentative for other gods in earlier or contemporary cults? As far as  we may call it new, the innovation concerns the institutionalization  of confessional expressions into a more or less dogmatic theological  system. Asklepios’ omnipotence acquires a fixed array of cultic and  rhetorical forms of expression. That is why I referred to them as “the  earliest traces of a cultic omnipotence.” In the background of it all is  the eminently salvational quality of this divine doctor. For all these  reasons I deemed it worthwhile to focus our attention on this inter- esting religious tendency. However, the new cultic forms emphasized  characteristics that were of old implicitly inherent in the notion ‘god’.  The vacillation in perspective between human and divine, the alterca- tions between ‘self ’ (human aspects) and ‘other’ (‘godly’ aspects), so  eminently conspicuous in Asklepios,138 belong to the fixed and indeed  necessary equipment of any Greek god. Sometimes this has to do with  the opposition between professional specialization and unspecified  range of action. More generally, it is the result of shifts between dif- ferent layers of perception. Let us return to the gods and the expres- sions of their power. ent approach: J.N. Bremmer, Anaphe, Apollo Aiglêtês and the Origin of Asclepius, in  idem 2008, 249–265, with a discussion of Burkert’s suggestion at 254 f.  137 Already for this earlier period the words of Apuleius are true (De Deo Soc- ratis 15.153 [Edelstein I p. 116]): “Of these [good daimones] they deem gods only  those who, having guided the chariot of their lives wisely and justly, and having been  endowed afterward by men as divinities with shrines and religious ceremonies, are  commonly worshipped as Amphiaraos in Boeotia, Mopsus in Africa, Osiris in Egypt,  one in one part of the world and another in another part, Asklepios everywhere.” In  later times, his position becomes ever more elevated, as exemplified by such predi- cates and acclamations as Μέγας Ǹσκληπιός (Tyche 9 [1994] 205–212)Ÿ θεὸς σωτὴρ  πολιο˃χος (Aigeai, Cilicia: L.

God: Powerful and All-Powerful “You give destruction to whom you like, and to those that are destroyed  you give growth:” thus an Isis aretalogy.139 “I kill and I make alive; I  wound and I heal:” so speaks the Lord in Deut. 32:39. We have seen  these stereotyped polar expressions of omnipotence several times  before, and noticed that they belong to the fixed formulas of henothe- istic theology especially in Near Eastern and Egyptian context. But  they are by no means foreign to Greek hymnic idiom. Muses from Pieria, who glorify by songs, come to me, tell of Zeus your  father in your singing. Because of him mortal men are unmentioned  and mentioned, spoken and unspoken of, according to great Zeus’ will.  For easily he makes strong, and easily he oppresses the strong, easily he  diminishes the conspicuous one and magnifies the inconspicuous, and  easily he makes the crooked straight and withers the proud. So the opening lines of Hesiod’s Erga (also discussed above, p. 231, in  a different context), the first and best known Greek aretalogy in the  form of a consistent series of polar expressions. The passage is replete  with formulaic expressions. In poetry gods are frequently said to do  things ‘easily’ (ῥέα μὲν γὰρ . . .),140 which is an expression of their supe- rior and unrestricted power. At least equally common is the observa- tion that the gods, Zeus in particular, can make the great small and  the small great.141 Generally, a god’s power is often specified by saying  that he can do either of two opposite things with equal ease.142 Finally,  139 P.Oxy 1380 (Totti 1985 no. 20), ll. 175–7. Cf. above Ch. III n. 150. 140 As West in his commentary ad loc. (Op. 5 ff.; cf. Th. 447) observes, with exam- ples. So already Nägelsbach 1840, 23 f. 141 Il. 15. 490 ff.; West ad Op. 5: “Usually it is not represented as a question of what  one deserves but simply as one of God’s whim or private purposes;” Th. 442 f. Similar  polar expressions in the Iliad: Ahrens 1937, 69; Od. 23.11–13: “The gods (. . . .) can  make foolish even one who is very wise, and set the simple-minded in the paths of  understanding.” Cf. Nisbet &amp; Hubbard on Hor. C. I.34, 112. Just so about the God of  Israel: “the arrogant of heart and mind he has put to rout, he has torn imperial powers  from their thrones, but the humble have been lifted high.” Typical of Psalms as e.g.  Ps. 147.6, but prevalent throughout OT (e.g. Job 5.11; 12.19; Sm. 2.7; Ez. 21.31); and,  less frequently, in NT (e.g. Luk. 1.51 f.) 142 West 1997, 267 f., with Near Eastern parallels. Cf. Pind. Pyth.1. 41 f.: “But all this  lies beyond human calculation: a god disposes it, hurling one man upward and bring- ing another down to size.” In general on the meaning of such polarities: M. Eliade,  The Two and the One (New York 1965) 78–124; G.E.R. Lloyd, Polarity and Analogy  (Cambridge 1966) 90–94. </page> <page sequence="45">  god: the question of divine omnipotence 423  expressions such as “whenever it pleases him”, or “according to his  free will” emphasize the arbitrariness of the god’s interventions.143 Not only are these formulas quite common, they also cover a long  period of time, from early archaic poetry into classical times and  beyond, some of them, as we have seen, into modern times. One of  the earliest is the fragment of Archilochos fr. 130 W., already quoted  at p. 153: It all depends on the gods. Often enough, when men are prostrate on  the ground with woe, they set them up again; and often enough, when  men are standing proud and all seems bright, they tip them over on their  backs, and then they are in a plight. It resounds in the fourth century, in Xenophon’s dictum:144 The deity often takes pleasure in making the small great and the great  small (καὶ ὁ θεὸς δέ, ὡς ἔοικε, πολλάκις χαίρει τοɞς μὲν μικροɞς  μεγάλους ποιῶν, τοɞς δὲ μεγάλους μικρούς). And between these two authors, Solon, Herodotus and many others  shared both this view and its expression, as we saw in our second chap- ter. In these examples ‘the gods’, often summarized under the name  Zeus, may be viewed as an alias for the whims of Fate or for the rigid  mechanism of the kuklos- and the allote allos-idea.145 Accordingly they  often concern dramatic interferences in human life. This specific expres- sion of the idea of omnipotence is so proverbially associated with Zeus  that Aesopos can make a pun on it. Asked what Zeus was doing at the  moment,146 he answered: “He is busy humbling the lofty, and elevating  the humble” (τὰ μὲν ὑψηλὰ ταπεινο˃ν, τὰ δὲ ταπεινὰ ὑψο˃ν). However, this does not mean that Zeus inevitably and completely  evaporates into some abstract impersonal notion. Anthropomorphic  and more abstract notions of god or gods continuously alternate,  143 See: Keyssner 1932, 84, with more testimonia: “Die göttliche Macht wird in ihrer  Unbeschränktheit besonders deutlich, wenn betont wird, die Gottheit könne nach  freien Willen über ihre Macht verfügen.” Cf. H.Aphrodite 38: καί τε το˃, εȾτε θέλοι,  πυκινὰς φρένας ἐξαπαφο˃σα ῥηιδίως συνέμιξε. In Hes. Th. similar expressions occur  no fewer than 6 times in the hymnic glorification of Hekate (on which see below  n. 155): 429, 430, 432, 439, 443, 446. Cf. West 1997, 267 with Near Eastern parallels. 144 Hell. 6.4.23. On Xenophon’s ambivalence between arbitrary and punishing gods  see: Pownall 1998. 145 Krause 1976. 146 The question was asked by the Spartan Chilon (Diog. Laert. 1, 3, 69), but such  jokes were popular. In Ar. Av. 1501 f. there is the same question: “What is Zeus doing?”  The questioner himself suggests: “the clouds collecting or the clouds  dispersing?” </page> <page sequence="46"> 424 chapter five already in Homer: “Zeus increases and diminishes the courage in  men, according to his will. For he is the most powerful of all” (Ɖεɞς  δ’ ἄρετην ἄνδρεσσι ὀφέλλει τε μινύθει τε / ὅππως κεν ἐθέλησινż ὁ γὰρ  κάρτιστος DZπάντων (Il. 20.242 f.), says Aeneas by way of excuse for his  earlier cowardly behaviour. In these words the two notions “the capac- ity to do anything he wants” and “the most powerful of all” are closely  united, as are the implied more abstract and more personal images  of the god. Indeed, as a personal god Zeus is stronger than all other  gods, as it is elsewhere expressed in a very anthropomorphic competi- tive image: All the rest together cannot pull Zeus down from heaven  to earth: “So much stronger am I than the gods, and stronger than  mortals” (Il. 8.18 f.). He can force even the mightiest gods, Poseidon,  Hera, and Athena together, to bow to his authority.147 Nor is Zeus the only god to be associated with the conception of  omnipotence as expressed in such formulas of praise. Aphrodite, both  as an abstract force and as a personal deity, is frequently pictured as an  invincible and irresistible goddess,148 a tyrant who arbitrarily manipu- lates all living beings and is able to bring about a complete reversal of  present circumstances, as for instance in Sappho’s prayer to Aphro- dite ll. 19–24.149 Sometimes she is pictured as a great physical force,  then again in a very human shape and with human affects. Euripides’  Hippolytos provides a glaring instance of the shifting of these two   representations. A similar wavering between abstract and concrete representation in  contexts relating to divine omnipotence occurs also in more general  expressions of god and gods. When Eumaios (Od. 14. 443 ff.) says:  “for (the) god can do everything” (θεὸς . . . δύναται γὰρ ǵπαντα),150 he  himself explains this disertis verbis as referring to an anonymous law  of alternating luck and disaster: 147 Cf. Hes. Th. 49: ὅσσον φέρτατός ἐστι θεῶν κράτει τε μέγιστος. 148 Often identified or in close co-operation with Eros, in actions of superior arbi- trariness, from Homeric poetry up till the novel of the Roman period: H. Parry,  The Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite: Erotic Ananke, Phoenix 40 (1986) 253–264;  M. Alpero witz, Das Wirken und Walten der Götter im griechischen Roman (Heidel- berg 1992) 48–58; 96 ff.

God gives and god withholds,  as is his pleasure. For he can do whatever he wants (θεὸς δὲ τὸ μὲν  δώσει, τὸ δ’ ἐάσει, ὅττι κεν ʉ θύμˎ ἐθέλʤ. δύναται γὰρ ǵπαντα).151 On the other hand, the words of Odysseus (Od. 10. 306) θεοὶ δέ τε  πάντα δύνανται, refer to the god Hermes who, very much present in  his most anthropomorphic shape, digs up the root of the moly plant  for Odysseus, a feat mortals are not supposed to achieve.152 Generally, the gnomic expression ‘The gods can do everything’153  accommodates a broad scale of functions. Its meaning is dependent  on context and the speaker’s intention.154 Retrospectively, it can be  launched as a line of defence in a situation of despair, either to palliate  the ineluctability of fate (as for instance in the words of Eumaios just  quoted) or as an apologetic device to account for disgraceful, stupid,  or cowardly behaviour, as in Od. 23.11 ff.: The gods can make the most sensible man senseless and bring the feeble- minded to good sense (θεοί, οȡ τε δύνανται ἄφρονα ποιῆσαι καὶ ἐπίφρονα  περ μάλ’ ἐόντα καί τε χαλιφρονέοντα σαοφροσύνης ἐπέβησαν). Prospectively, it may be used as a vehicle to convey notions of hope  for oneself and of warning to others—to create a perspective in which  desperate circumstances become less desperate—more particularly as  an appeal to divine justice and a quest for retribution. The first 6 lines  of Hesiod’s Erga quoted above do not yet give a clue as to which of  151 Very much in the same vein, also in the context of an invitation to eat and forget  sorrow: Od. 4. 237, ἀτὰρ θεὸς ἄλλοτε ἄλλˎ Ɖεɞς ἀγαθόν τε κακόν τε διδοῖż δύναται  γὰρ ǵπαντα. 152 As in Theogn V. 14: σοὶ μὲν το˃το, θεά, σμικρόν, ἐμοὶ δὲ μέγα.  153 Besides and after Homer inter alios Epicharmos, Pindar, Kallimachos as  reported by Clem. Strom v. 100.6–101.1; Diels Doxogr. 299. Kerkidas, Meliambi (ed.  L. Lomiento, Cercidas [Rome 1993]) p. 91, Fr. 1 45 f. [P.Oxy.

Plutarch Non posse suaviter 22 quotes a  certain Hermogenes as saying that “the gods know everything and can do anything.”  For these expressions of omnipotence (δύνασθαι πάντα), both pagan and Christian,  see: W.

Kirschenblatt-Gimblett, Toward a Theory of Proverb  Meaning, in: Mieder &amp; Dundes 1981, 111–121, espec. 113, on the import of con- text shows how we need the situation to which a proverb such as “A friend in need  is a friend in deed” applies to determine if it is about someone giving or receiving   friendship. </page> <page sequence="48"> 426 chapter five these two major perspectives may be intended. Line 7 “easily he makes  the crooked straight and withers the proud” provides a first hint, but  still vague, that omnipotence here may function as a veiled reference  to the idea of divine justice, in accordance with the main theme of the  poem. However, when in the Theogony goddess Hekate is hailed with  very comparable aretalogical praises, it solely refers to her arbitrary  omnipotence.155 Generally, in this idiom of unrestricted divine power,  there is a continuous wavering between arbitrary power for the sake of  power on the one hand and benevolent omnipotence in a perspective  of divine protection and consolation on the other. We are reminded  of Isis, who was both the fearful impersonation of arbitrary Tuche and  the fair and beneficent victor over blind Fate. In sum, “omnipotence is thus a part of the traditional religion of  the poets” (Grant 1952, 127). However, consistency is the last thing we  should expect to find.156 The conflict between divine claims of omnipo- tence and human doubt in Greek literature comes into view as early as  in the dialogue between Telemachos, who cannot believe that Odys- seus will return and be able to slay on his own the assembled suitors  “even if the gods will it so” (οὐδ’ εἰ θεοὶ ɇς ἐθέλοιεν) and Athena, in  the person of Mentor, who tells him that “easily a god if he wishes can  save a man from however far away he may be” (ῥεῖα θεός γ’ ἐθέλων  καὶ τηλόθεν ἄνδρα σαώσαι). This clash between the limitations by  physical nature and logic on the one hand, and an unrestrained trust  in god’s omnipotence on the other, is conditioned by differences in  perspective, which, as the Asklepieian iamata so exemplarily showed,  may alternate within one context in an alarmingly rapid succession. 155 See above n. 143. The aretalogical nature of the Hekate passage in Hes. Th., per- haps corollary to her ‘immigrant’ nature, has been long acknowledged. See: F. Pfister,  Die Hekate-Episode in Hesiods Theogonie, Philol. 84 (1929) 1–9; Nock 1933, 22; Th.  Kraus, Hekate (Heidelberg 1960); A.M. Tupet, La magie dans la poésie latine I (Paris  1976) 131 ff.; West 1966, ad 404–452; J. Rudhardt, À propos de l’Hécate hésiodique,  MH 50 (1993) 204–213. J.S. Clay, The Hecate of the Theogony, GRBS 25 (1984) 27–38,  attractively argues for a “critical mediating rôle of the goddess . . . . by whose will prayer  is accomplished and fulfilled” (36 f.). This function explains “the arbitrary wilfulness  Hesiod assigns to her and may have influenced her later associations with magic and  crossroads” (ibid. n. 1). Note also that among about a thousand votive inscriptions  from the Archaic period Hekate is the only goddess who is addressed as Despoina,  “Mistress:” Lazzarini 1976, no. 801. 156 The tension between the concepts of divine omnipotence and limited power (as  well as omniscience and its restrictions) in Homer was already analysed by Nägelsbach  1840, 18 ff.: “Allwissendheit und beschränktes Wissen der Gottheit,” and 21 ff.: “All- macht und beschränkte Macht der Gottheit.” </page> <page sequence="49">  god: the question of divine omnipotence 427 1. Omnipotence, ancient philosophers and modern theologians The fourth-century author Palaiphatos—admittedly not the most daz- zling intellect that Greece has produced—in his comment on the myth  of Aktaion (Peri Apiston ch. 6) writes: It seems to me that Artemis can do whatever she wants. Yet it is not true  that a man became a deer or a deer a man (ἐμοὶ δὲ δοκεῖ Ἄρτεμιν μὲν  δύνασθαι ὅ τι θέλοι ποιῆσαιż οὐ μέντοι ἐστὶν ἀληθὲς ἔλαφον ἐξ ἀνδρὸς  Ȏ ἐξ ἐλάφου ἄνδρα γενέσθαι).157 His little book On Unbelievable Tales is the oldest remaining consis- tently rationalizing essay on the logical, historical or biological problems  raised by myth.158 The wavering between faith in divine omnipotence  and the critique of miraculous stories flourished in subsequent philo- sophical thought, staging inter alia arguments that gods cannot pos- sibly do things that are incompatible with their own nature, physical  law or logic: they cannot die, give mortals immortality or recall the  dead, change the past, or make twice ten unequal to twenty, nor can  they do acts of injustice or immoral things. “If the gods do anything  shameful, they are no gods” (Eur. Fr. 292.7).159 157 J. Stern, Palaephatus, On Unbelievable Tales (Wauconda 1996) 10 is cer- tainly right in rejecting Grant’s 1952, 128 suggestion that this is a case of irony. Cf.  K. Brodersen, Die Wahrheit über die griechischen Mythen. Palaiphatos’ Unglaubliche  Geschichten (Stuttgart 2002), whose pages 17–21 (in his introduction) seem to have  been copied roughly from Stern’s book, displaying numerous points made in Stern’s  introduction with language, arguments and examples in the same order (even includ- ing an identical joke about dinosaurs!) as well as emendations or explanations in the  text, without even once giving credit to his source.  158 See: K. Brodersen, Das aber ist eine Lüge! Zur rationalistischen Mythenkritik des  Palaiphatos, in: R. von Haehling (ed.), Griechische Mythologie und frühes Christentum  (Darmstadt 2005) 44–57, showing that his rationalism was adduced by some of the  Christian apologists to discredit ‘pagan’ religion. 159 Cf.

The argument of the anonymous atheist in Aetius Compendium de placitis (= Ps. Plu- tarch De placitis philosophorum) 1.73: “For not even god can do everything. If god  exists let him make snow black, fire cold, what is sedentary upright,” derives from  Aristotle Categories 12b40–41, as argued by D.T. Runia, Atheists in Aëtius, Mne- mosyne 49 (1996) 542–576, espec. 558 f. Aristoteles does not use it as an argument  against religion but elsewhere (Eth. Nic. 6.2.6) he does cite the poet Agathon in sup- port of his view that even god cannot change the past. In this tradition also belongs  the famous argument ascribed to Epicurus, as handed down by Lactantius, De ira dei  13.20 f. “Either God wants to abolish evil but cannot, or he can but does not want  to, or he neither wants nor can, or he both wants and can,” followed by the logical  inferences of each of these options. R. Glei, Et invidus et inbecillus. Das angebliche  </page> <page sequence="50"> 428 chapter five Independently, this type of argument had a long history in its applica- tion as the literary topos of the adunaton. Adunata are generally used  in a simile to exemplify the impossibility that something unforeseeable  will happen, for instance that the speaker will break his word or that  his love will ever come to an end. They are often moulded in terms  of an inconceivable violation of the normal course of nature: rivers  cannot reverse their courses, the sea cannot be made immovable, the  moon cannot be pulled down, no one can count the drops of water of  the sea or the grains of the sand of the beaches, etc.160 We have met the well-known adunaton of counting the drops of  water of the sea or the grains of the sand of the beaches earlier in the  words of the god Apollo (Hdt. 1.47, above p. 398). There, however, the  adunaton had turned dunaton, in that Apollo boasted that he could do  what proverbially and philosophically was deemed to be the ultimate  instance of impossibility. This is an ideal illustration of the paradox  that a stereotyped sample of impossibility in the ‘constative’ or ‘descrip- tive’ language of commonsense assertion or philosophical reflection is  presented as the non plus ultra of divine omnipotence161 in the ‘expres- sive’, ‘phatic’ or ‘commissive’ language162 of faith and devotion. Why,  then, should, in a discussion of religious expression, the latter type of  discourse be rated less valid, relevant or ‘true’ than the first? Epikurfragment bei Laktanz, De ira dei 13, 20–21, VChr 42 (1988) 47–58, convincingly  argues that this dictum is not Epicurean but goes back to Sextus Empiricus. 160 H.V. Canter, The Figure of Α∆ƗΝΑƖƒΝ in Greek and Latin Poetry, AJP 51 (1930)  32–41, gives a clear brief survey of the various categories. See also: E. Dutoit, Le thème  de l’adunaton dans la poésie antique (Paris 1936) 167–173; A. Manzo, L’adynaton  poetico-retorico e le sue implicazioni dottrinali (Genova 1988). 161 Not only divine omnipotence. Magicians claimed the capacity to do whatever  they wished and even perform the very same unnatural tricks that gods could. They  even boasted that they could subject gods to their will. “They have the power to bring  down the sky, to bear up the earth, render the waters solid, make hills fluid, to call up  the dead into the air, to deprive the gods of their strength, to extinguish the stars, to  illuminate Tartaros,” as Apuleius Met. 1.8, says about the Thessalian witch. The magi- cal papyri bristle with similar lists of adunata performed by magicians assisted by their  demons and spirits. See for adunata and the absurd impossibilities called “table tricks  of Demokritos” in magical papyri: J.C.B. Petropoulos, Sappho the Sorceress—Another  Look at Fr. 1 (LP), ZPE 97 (1993) 43–56, espec. 49 ff. 162 I am using here terms borrowed from the discussion of omnipotence in Chris- tian theology like that between philosophical deduction and proposition as for instance  in Anselmus and the language of biblical confessional expression of praise and worship  (Van den Brink 1993, 178).  </page> <page sequence="51">  god: the question of divine omnipotence 429 The counterarguments of the sceptics landed, safe and undiluted,  in Christian theology,163 and as a result, though happily unaware of  Palaiphatos at the time, it was with deep satisfaction that, at the age of  fifteen, I learned that God was all-mighty, all-powerful and omniscient  but that He could not make a stone that was so heavy that he could  not lift it up Himself.164 Indeed, even if they accept Anselmus’ famous definition of god as  id quo maius nihil cogitari potest, Christians to the present day keep  pondering—and quarrelling—about the issue of God’s omnipotence:  is it restricted by natural law or is it not?165 Many believers are in seri- ous doubt and do not make a secret of their disbelief, sometimes with  tragic consequences. During a pastoral program for the Dutch radio I  heard a mother, prostrate with grief, beseech the attending minister to  at least grant her the consolation of attributing the death of her son to  the providence of an almighty God. The devout clergyman regretted  not being able to concede her this: he belonged to that modern theolo- gian stream that stresses God’s vulnerability, weakness and even pow- erlessness rather than his power (the so-called “patricompassionism”).166  163 Thomas Aquinas, Summa contra Gentiles 1.2.25, gives a list of illustrations of  his thesis quamvis Deus sit omnipotens, aliqua tamen dicitur non posse (“even if God  is omnipotent, there are some things that he is said not to be able to do”), including  that God cannot make the same thing be and not be at the same time; he cannot  make opposites exist at the same time in the same thing, and he cannot make the  past not be. On the same issue in William Ockam, a generation after Thomas, see:  H. Schröcker, Das Verhältnis der Allmacht Gottes zum Kontradiktionsprinzip nach  Wilhelm von Ockham (Berlin 2002). And the discussion went on well into the sev- enteenth century: F. Oakly, Omnipotence, Covenant, and Order: An Excursion in the  History of Ideas from Abelard to Leibniz (Ithaca 1984) 84–90, and, in fact, never ended  as we shall see shortly. 164 Recently I found in Van den Brink 1993, 181, that the question is just a bit more  complicated than I thought at the time: “If God made such a stone, He would thereby  give up part of his power. But as long as He does not make such a stone because he  does not want to, He continues to be omnipotent”!  165 The fact that modern astrophysics no longer comply with what earlier genera- tions of scientists had assumed to be ironclad physical laws, instead of complicating  the dilemma rather seems to offer a way out: (some) physicists and theologians, after  centuries of open war, are heading for an armistice. See e.g. P. Davies, God and the  New Physics (Harmondsworth 1984). 166 D. Sölle, Leiden (Stuttgart 1973); H.R. Burke, God, Suffering and Belief (Nashville  1977) 118–121; H.

But at least this tenet enables its believers to solve  another burning problem: that of eternal burning in hell. Since eter- nal torment of this sort is obviously a physical/biological impossibility  St Augustine helpfully argued that the ability of bodies to withstand  the punishment of ‘fire and worm’ forever is “a miracle of the most  omnipotent Creator.”168 This little excursus into modern efforts and failures to come to terms  with the complications of the notion omnipotence, was intended as a  reminder not to impose on our Greeks constraints of consistency that  modern believers are unable to live up to. Religious expression, espe- cially of the type that we have been discussing, is mostly unreflective,  very much gnomic, and with no deep interest in logical consistency.  Religious language is of a rhetorical,169 (self-)persuasive and (self-)assur- ing nature and cannot but produce contradictions with other types of  discourse, producing as a result gods that are omnipotent—yet cannot  do all things. Greeks—at least most Greeks—could not care less.170 167 The Dutch queen Wilhelmina refused to have her body embalmed after her  death for fear of thus jeopardizing her chance of bodily resurrection. The same with  divine omniscience: During a church service a Dutch reformed vicar once could be  heard praying to God: “Almighty Father, we are praying to you from our church  in Woudschoten . . . in the vicinity of Utrecht.” He was censured for this ludicrous  geographic clue to an almighty and omniscient god by H.M. Kuitert, a professor in  theology, who, in his turn wrote many books in which he ardently defended the idea  that God must have eyes to see and ears to hear, since, if he does not, he cannot be a  god. Cf. also G.M. Jantzen o.c. (above n. 9). 168 CD 21.9.47–48. Cf. A.

Thus, it turns out again that the context in which our talk of God’s  omnipotence takes place is of crucial importance.” So, very correctly, Van den Brink  180, in the wake of U. Bach, Schüttet das Kind nicht mit dem Bade aus!, Evangelische  Kommentare 24 (1991) 289–292, who underpins this with a sketch of the differences  between deductive philosophical “necessary” definitions of omnipotence and biblical  cognitive experience of God’s power in history, which he calls almightiness.  </page> <page sequence="53">  god: the question of divine omnipotence 431 2. Inconsistency in religious expression It is inconsistency, then—and nothing to be worried or ashamed of.  The Zeus of Hesiod’s Erga 1–10 can do everything, see everything  and know everything. The Zeus of Il. 14 does not know everything:  he is deceived by Aphrodite.171 Yet she in turn is outmatched by him  in the Hymn to Aphrodite with counter-deception. The Zeus of the  Iliad generally can do everything, since Moira, one’s ‘portion’, often  is depicted as being in the last resort identical with his will. Yet at the  same time, his power is restricted: Hera reminds him that he cannot  save his son Sarpedon (Il. 16.439 f.)172 At one place Hesiod can tell how  Zeus was deceived by Prometheus, at another he can say that Zeus can  never be deceived.173 The Zeus of Solon’s Hymn to the Muses (Fr. 13,  for which see above pp. 201 ff.) foresees and controls everything, even- tually always punishing every sin. The Zeus of Solon’s fourth fragment  cannot do everything he wishes: even if his aisa plus the will of the  immortal gods would decide to ruin Athens, Athena keeps her saving  hand over that city. The Zeus of Aeschylus’ Oresteia is the all-powerful  supreme principle of justice,174 the Zeus of the Prometheus Vinctus is a  pitiless and arbitrary tyrant. Are they all the same Zeus? That is a type  of question that has emerged several times before in the present book,  but one, as I have argued, that Greeks themselves are not particu- larly prone to consider. The central inference is that omnipotence and  restriction of power oscillate depending on context. For it is always the  context—the agenda of the speaker, the type of discourse, the nature  of the literary genre—that decides what should be tolerated and what  not, what is supposed to be caught as a marker of significance, and  what should be temporarily ignored as background noise. 171 Actually by Hera, but using equipment deceptively borrowed from Aphrodite.  Here as elsewhere Aphrodite may outrival the supreme god. Cf. Chariton, 6.3.2: The  Great Persian King has heard that Eros is master of all the gods, even of Zeus, . . . Cf.  above n. 148. 172 “She is only warning him that he cannot sacrifice to a sudden whim his own  settled policy,” thus Lloyd-Jones 1971, 4/5, in an attempt to smooth over this incon- sistency in accordance with the main objective of his study. But, in fact, this does not  make him less restricted as to power. 173 Op. 48. Contrast Op. 105; Th. 613. As noted by Lloyd-Jones 1971, 82, with more  striking instances of contrasting qualities ascribed to Zeus and the important infer- ence: “It is rather that the early Greek conception of Zeus attributed to him many  human actions and qualities together with others beyond human range, and that in  early times the ‘apparent’ contradiction was only beginning to cause perplexity.” For  my own, very related but more specific, interpretation see below.  174 No doubt because here in particular Aeschylus’ ‘monotheistic’ stance comes to  the fore: Zajcev 1996, 206 f.  </page> <page sequence="54"> 432 chapter five We have seen that gods on their way toward omnipotence may take  their departure from their own specialization. This is most naturally  true for Zeus whose mythical sovereignty over the gods was a conve- nient springboard for his rise towards omnipotence. It is no less, albeit  in a different way, true for gods such as Asklepios and Aphrodite.  Hymnic strategies illustrate how, once gaining impetus, the rampant  language of power and excellence tends to hide their modest origins  from view.175 As soon as a hymn176 to a god introduces terms with  the element ‘all’—(pan)177 or starts flattering the god in that he is the  ‘only one’ (monos)178 to be able (dunatos/dunasai) to do something (or  everything),179 or resorts to the use of superlatives, which by their very  nature waver between elative ‘very’ and all-surpassing ‘the most’—as  soon as these topoi emerge, and usually this is very soon, the addressee  of the hymn irresistibly obtains a henotheistic quality,180 including  omnipotent features.181 175 Keyssner 1932, 31: “Die wichtigste Vorstellung ist dass der Gott gewisse Fähig- keiten besitzt, die sich auf alle Dinge erstrecken, dass er alle Teile der Welt innehat,  dass er alles beherrscht, über alles Macht hat und überall in Ehren steht.” With many  examples. See for this phenomenon also: Ch. I, p. 140; Ch. III pp. 283 ff. Different from  what especially the French structuralists so emphatically assert (see Vernant’s defini- tion above p. 27), divine trespassing on another’s field of competence is a quite com- mon phenomenon. Ɖεɞς πάντων αὐτὸς φάρμακα μο˃νος ἔχει (Stob. Ecl. I.6 p. 24 W.)  is an extreme expression of the general phenomenon that all gods may function as  medical specialists and that every god can be invoked for any conceivable case of  emergency. Generally on hymnic praise as a strategy of persuasion: W.D. Furley,  Praise and Persuasion in Greek Hymns, JHS 115 (1995) 29–46. 176 See for all this: Keyssner 1932, especially Ch. 2, “Der hyperbolische Stil.” 177 W. Pöhlmann, Die hymnischen All-Prädikationen in Kol. 1, 15–20, ZNW 64  (1973) 53–74, offers a good collection of pan-predicates in later hymnic formulas.  Generally on the element pan- in words and names: Usener 1896, 56–66. 178 “Im Hymnus wird der Gott als allein-mächtiger bezeichnet,” so Keyssner 1932,  35–39, with ample evidence on the monos predicate. Cf. Norden 1923, 243–250; cf.  above Ch. III pp. 296 ff. 179 For this and similar expressions “For you (alone) are able to do this” see: West  ad Hes. Th. 420. Above Ch. III p. 297.  180 Keyssner 1932, 35: “Wir haben darin den stilistischen Ausdruck dessen vor uns,  was man nach dem Vorgang Max Müllers . . . mit Henotheismus bezeichnet: der Gott,  an den der Mensch im Augenblick sein Gebet richtet, gilt ihm als Repräsentant alles  Göttlichen überhaupt.” 181 Keyssner 1932, 30: “in dem Gefühl das erfühlt ist von der Grösse und Macht,  von der Herrlichkeit und Ewigkeit der Gottheit, vergißt der Dichter über den einen  Gott, den er besingt, alle übrigen Götter und schreibt dem einen alle Macht zu.” Ibid.  35: “vielmehr wird ihm im Augenblick der dichterischen Vision das Bild der besun- genen vorschweben, unbeschränkt durch die Macht irgendwelcher anderer Götter, so  dass er in ihr den gesamten Ausdruck aller Göttlichkeit sieht.” And cf. above Ch. III  p. 300. </page> <page sequence="55">  god: the question of divine omnipotence 433 Indeed, in matters of omnipotence and miracle, the language of exulta- tion is the ultimate authority. People who feel the urge to give expres- sion to the ultimately ultimate, twist their tongues and choke on their  words: the rhetoric of praise and supplication often resorts to a viola- tion of grammar and language rules. What we politely call an acclam- atory hyperbole may be rather circumscribed as a verbal explosion  with linguistically calamitous effects: ὁ μεγιστότατος șλιος (lit. the  most greatest Helios) we read in a magical text,182 which it would be  erroneous to simply dismiss as an erroneous double superlative. Dizzy  Byzantine titles such as πρωτοπανσεβαστουπέρτατος emerge. The nor- mal Graecicized Egyptian superlative expression μέγας καὶ μέγας καὶ  μέγας may become μέγιστος καὶ μέγιστος καὶ μέγιστος.183 Here the  extremes meet: baffling cumulative excrescences connote exactly the  same as the three-letter word heis: ‘one’. In such elative language even  the word theos may become inadequate. Hence we learn that Aphro- dite “surely is no goddess, but, if it may be, something more than god”  (ἀλλ’ εἴ τι μεῖζον ἄλλο γίγνεται θεο˃), as the nurse exclaims in Eur.  Hippol. 359 f., in her reaction to the horror of Phaedra’s illicit love  (Cf. Ch. III p. 274). Exaltation may easily transcend logic. In Aesch. Fr. 70 (TrGf ): a  character says: “Zeus is the universe—and what is still higher than  this.”184 At moments of ultimate desperation, need or hope, words can  182 In B. Müller, Megas Theos (Diss.

My daughter, when very young,  called her father “de liefste van de allemaalste” which in translation would be some- thing like: “the dearest of the allest” in which, though conceptually correct, she was  grammatically wrong. However, in Petjo, the language of an Indian Dutch speaking  section of the Suriname people, these double superlatives have become normal usage  (Kousbroek NRC 4-12-87). Especially in the language of praise or blame predicates  tend to suffer from rapid inflation. Being awarded the predicate ‘good’ does not make  an author very happy. ‘Excellent’ is the least one would hope for and in Belgium or  Germany one can descry tears in the eyes of a candidate who got only the grade cum  laude (instead of magna, or summa cum laude) for his/her doctorate.  184 The universe is expressed as τὰ πάντα being the all encompassing superlative of  preceding αἰθήρ, γῆ, οὐρανός. Cf. Burkert 1996a, 91 f. This unreflected allusion to the  infiniteness shows in an exemplary way how this notion cannot but lead to paradoxes,  as argued at length by A.W. Moore, The Infinite (London 1991).  </page> <page sequence="56"> 434 chapter five say what they cannot say185 and gods indeed can do what they can- not do. Not only gods: Aesopos’ 10th fable tells us how an Athenian  debtor in dire need for cash offered his only sow for sale. At the ques- tion whether she was fertile he answered: “O yes, very fertile. During  the time of the Eleusininan Mysteries she gives birth to females, and  during the Panathenaic Festival she gives birth to males.” The buyer  looked stunned, but the creditor said: “I should not be so surprised if  I were you. Why, it is quite clear that this sow would also doubtless  give birth to baby goats for the god Dionysos.” This fable shows— thus the envoy—“that people do not hesitate to pledge the impossible  when they are desperate.” Aesopos knew, his commentator knew, and  the Greeks knew. So why do we fancy to know better? Why stub- bornly impose our own dogmatics by denying the gods of the Greeks  omnipotence in “making the impossible possible”? Time and again we have seen themes of the present chapter inter- secting with those of earlier ones, most notably the second and more  particularly the third with its focus on henotheistic religion. Our  observations on the rhetoric of prayer and hymn once more revealed  the close relationship of the notions of omnipotence and henotheism.  This observation may help us tackle the fallacy hidden in the thesis  that Greek polytheism is incompatible with omnipotence. A Greek who is in dire trouble—desires the restoration of an eye,  wishes to be rescued from a seething sea, is starving and craves food,  cries out to save a child that is mortally ill—may and usually does  pray to a god of his or her preference. To a large extent that choice  is arbitrary and the addressee may just as well be a great soter-god as  the unpretentious hero round the corner. However, from now on the  adorant’s full attention is focused on this god in whom he puts all his  hopes and upon whom he makes himself entirely dependent. At this  moment that god is the only one who can help while other gods tem- porarily disappear from sight. Such a prayer of a high grade of inten- sity, then, is a henotheistic moment in a polytheistic religion. And the  near formulaic phrase: “you can do everything you want, (so help me)”  is the appropriate expression of that. We are here confronted with a  185 In another context even words are not what they are: voces magicae, which accord- ing to Patricia Cox Miller, In Praise of Nonsense, in: A.H. Armstrong (ed.), Classical  Mediterranean Spirituality: Egyptian, Greek, Roman (New York 1986) 481–505, not  only transcend writing but also transcend speech itself.

But omnipotence it  is: no god is restricted to only one particular service. Hymns to one god generally are expressions of a lower grade of  intensity, but share the henotheistic signature of prayers for help. We  have seen that formulas expressing omnipotence are typical of hymns  and that every god can be hailed as omnipotent in a hymn devoted to  his or her divinity. In this literary genre expressions of praise tend to  become more elaborate and formulaic. The difference from the later  great henotheistic movements is that in that context acclamations and  aretalogies acquire structural and exclusivist features. Our treatment  of Epidaurian Asklepios led to the discovery of the earliest traces of a  development from transitory, more or less spontaneous, henotheistic  moments of piety to a more structuralized, near dogmatic theology, as  we see it in full flow in Hellenistic/Roman henotheism. There the wor- shipped god is considered to be so great and superior, that he is called  heis, which as we have seen shifts easily from ‘uniquely great’ towards  ‘the only one’. Competition between cult communities abounds and  totalitarian claims may culminate in global and cosmic expressions  of power. No doubt, in this respect, political claims of contemporary  kings and emperors have served as a model, just as Near Eastern forms  of kingship have influenced the forms and predicates of almightiness  in the cult of the God of Israel. It is in these contexts that terms such as pantokrator186 and kosmokra- tor187 or omnipotens188 come to bloom. The latter two emerged only in  186 The notion pantokrator is rare (and late) in pagan texts.

The epigraphical evi- dence mainly of the imperial period: Pleket 1981, 171 ff.; Chaniotis 2010, n. 115. The  term is frequent in LXX and early Jewish authors, less so in NT (mainly in Revelation).  See: Ten Kate 2001, 25–46. Both in Revelation and in early Jewish texts the term as  designation of God occurs above all in the context of resistance against enemy power:  DDD s.v.

They all cover  the ideas of cosmic or terrestrial power and the possibility of coming  to the rescue in any situation.189 However, in less explicit terms already  the earliest stratum of Greek hymnody and poetry extols the great or  greatest kratos of a god, side by side with his capacity to do whatever he  wants. And even in the supposed monotheism of Israel praises of divine  almightiness and omnipotence are very situation-bound, hence expres- sive and phatic rather than constative and reflective. They are far closer  to comparable Greek ideas and idiom than is generally acknowledged. 5. Conclusions Our first conclusion may be that if the Greeks should be ‘desperately  alien’ they are not so in that having so many gods they must do without  the notion of theological omnipotence, but in that they have so many  omnipotent gods. Or rather—to sugarcoat the pill for the sceptics— because any of their many gods may have his/her share in omnipo- tence whenever the occasion requires it. One amazing testimony is  that even in a marginal private cult in a grotto on the isle of Crete the  very humble local variant of the least godly of all gods, Hermes, can  be addressed as pantokrator.190 If this seems paradoxical to us, that is  our problem. We try to smooth over the problem by ignoring, denying  or eliminating unwelcome Greek expressions, for instance by classify- ing them as rhetorical, hence refusing them access to the debate on  Greek theology. Greeks, on the other hand, elegantly coped with the  apparent paradoxes by means of that virtuoso winking process that  enabled them to deftly keep apart the various types of discourse with  their often contradictory expressions but which all shared one quality,  namely a common rhetorical nature. This whole argument can be extended to other divine characteristics  as we have quickly listed them above, especially to omnipresence and  omniscience, including all-seeing. It was impossible to deal with all of  these faculties, closely related to the central one of omnipotence. In  189 On the use of these notions (which both can be translated in Latin omnipotens)  in Greek and Early Christian theology: Van den Brink 1993, 43–67. 190 Kaibel, EG 815; SEG 33.736; IC II, XXVIII, 2.

AD, but no less testifies to  the incredible flexibility of an (ongoing) polytheistic culture.  </page> <page sequence="59">  god: the question of divine omnipotence 437 our first chapter (pp. 89 ff.) we were confronted with the complica- tions inherent in the notion of (omni)presence. I argued that gods  may be either viewed as being omnipresent or as dwelling in heaven,  which may—but does not need to—be equated with Olympus, from  where it may be helpful to summon them. They may also temporarily  sojourn in another part of the human world with other mortals, from  where as the case may be they may be either able191 or unable192 to hear  (and help) the adorant. Finally, they also may be imagined as continu- ously present ‘here’ in ‘our’ temple.193 The different images may peace- fully co-exist in the mind of the believer, ready for service whenever  required in a particular circumstance. Each of them may also receive  narrative emphasis whenever the focus of a story requires it.194 Omniscience and all-seeing capacities share the same complexities.  Generally they are specifically attributed to great Sky gods, especially  the Sun and in ancient Greece again to ‘the gods’ summarized as Zeus.195  But any god may be taken to see everything that one wishes whenever  it suits the adorant.196 This does not interfere at all with the custom  of opening the doors of temples during festivals in order that the god  (represented by his/her statue) could watch the performances.197 191 Very beautifully illustrated by Glaukos (Il. 16.514 ff.), who prays to Apollo: “Lis- ten to me Apollo, whether thou art in the luxuriant land of Lycia or in Troia: for thou  art able to hear to all sides” (δύνασαι δὲ σɞ πάντοσ’ ἀκούειν). See also Aubriot 1992,  96, n. 246; 149, n. 88. To be or to hear ‘everywhere’ becomes a predicate in later times.  Cf. a votive inscription from Sarmizegetusa, 3d c. AD, to Ɔράννˎ Ǹπόλλωνι αἰεὶ καὶ  πανταχο˃ ἐπηκόˎ (SEG 33 [1983] 589), and an inscription from Pergamon θεοῖς τοῖς  πανταχο˃ (Habicht 1969 no. 133).  192 The numerous hymnic invocations to a god inviting him to approach are just as  many reminders that from this perspective gods are not supposed to work from a dis- tance. As noticed by West ad Hes. Op. 2, who adds that this does not apply to all gods.  Zeus, for example, is never invited to approach; he sees and acts from where he is. 193 See Ch 1, p. 90 ff. In the latter case divine statues in temples tend to humanize  and anthropomorphicize the gods. On cult statues being cared for like living beings  with bathing, combing, dressing, kissing and walking: Gladigow 1986/7; 1990a.  194 A good example is that if gods wish to avoid Olympus or heavenly abodes for  a time they may seek refuge in their temples, which then are conceived as alternative  dwellings opposed to the world of the gods.

For the last time we have put  an element of Vernant’s rigid definition to the test. It was the one that  enjoyed almost universal approval. But again it appeared necessary  to modify it with a question mark. The second, and general, conclu- sion of this chapter, then, is that no single universal and consistently  valid statement can be made about any god, except that he or she is a  god (and even that one may occasionally be disputed). Gods alternate  between unimaginable sublimity and the basest human behaviour,  between supernatural capabilities and occasional frailties, and swiftly  they bridge the distance.198 The only thing they need to do is cross over  to a different kind of discourse, a different representation or a different  perspective. If ‘monotheistic’ Christians cannot unequivocally grant  their omnipotent God the ability to do everything he wants, let us  conversely grant the polytheistic Greeks the privilege of having many  gods who are all—occasionally—able to do everything they want, in  other words are omnipotent. Let us stop dehumanizing our Greeks  and, since “the historian’s task is to complicate” let us, for a start, stop  simplifying their gods. But are we at least allowed to preserve the ultimate certitude that  gods consistently differ from mortals in not being mortal? Even this  is not (always) true. Greek regions might boast the grave of a god and  myths told about their deaths.199 The final chapter of this book will be  devoted to a specific type of mortal gods. when the altar fire was kindled. See: O. Weinreich, Türöffnung (etc.) in: idem, 1968,  407–410.  198 Homer perhaps offers the most conspicuous and often alarming examples. J.M.  Redfield, Nature and Culture in the Iliad: The Tragedy of Hector (expanded edition,  Durham-London 1994) in the added chapter ‘The gods of the Iliad, Amplification’  (225–247), offers the in my view most helpful brief discussion of how to understand  this (225): “The heroes have their ups and downs, but the gods range all the way from  the sublime to the ridiculous. I would suggest that this mutability is a consequence of  the artistic problem set by the poet: that of maintaining the divinity of these creatures  and at the same time including them as characters inside the story.” Mutatis mutandis  this might serve as a summary of the present chapter.  199 D.
