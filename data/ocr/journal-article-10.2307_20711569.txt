Catherine Wood The fallen human soul, at its best, must be as a diminishing glass, and that a broken one, to the mighty truths of the universe round it; and the wider the scope of its glance, and the vaster the truths into which it obtains an insight, the more fantastic their distortion is ffltely to be. ? Ruskin on 'The Symbolical Grotesque', the Stones of Venice1 Rachel Harrison's sculptural concoctions butt into one's field of vision as literal and perceptual obstacles. Their awkwardness is symptomatic of Harrison's apparent anxiety about the status of sculpture in an excessively object-filled world. A knobbly blue piece titled What would it be Wee to be Imelda Marcos? (1996) is a wall-mounted form ? or, more correctly, a form bulging-from-the-wall ? made from styrofoam, papier-mache and paint, with a photograph embedded in it. Installed at Greene Naftali, New York, the lumpiness of its sculptural matter made sharp contrast with the pristine gallery walls. The implications of these two contrasting surfaces as supports for a photographic image could not be more different: the latter dissolving physical space to present the image as window-view; the former drawing attention to the photo and its support as assertively present matter. Absurd-looking, inelegant, Harrison's works are mostly composed in this way: as curious conglomerate shapes that both foreground and overwhelm the display of found objects or images. Writing in Artforum, Saul Anton asserts that Harrison's work 'confounds attempts to understand it dialectically as commodity fetishism critique' and that it often ? productively ? disappoints conventional art criticism in this sense.2 The Imelda Marcos title is both typical and indicative of the complex way in which Harrison negotiates the relation ship between fine art and consumer culture. The question posed by this piece, referring to a woman whose iconic anti-status as a corrupt decadent was made visible by her acquired hoard of one thousand plus pairs of shoes, enquires after some form of identification rather than straight critique. Her work mines the point of obstinate contradiction between a love of surface, with permission from Warhol, and an irrepressible, critical haunting by consumer excess. Harrison's thick slabs and lumpy blobs of plaster-coated foam, painted in chalky pastel shades, speak a slurred jumble of twentieth-century sculptural languages. The scale and mid-tones of the painted forms have something in common with the phenomenological experiments intended by Robert Morris's L~Beams (1967), yet the lurid syntheses of putrefying candy colours and fake materials are very much indebted to Paul McCarthy's cartoon figures and Santas. Amorphous fleshly forms recall Louise Bourgeois's latex casts such as Soft Landscape (1963), while occasionally a constructivist underpinning to her structures nods to Anthony Caro, if his work had been dunked into a vat of gloopy plaster and paint. Harrison gleefully cooks up a stew of different formal and conceptual positions and revels in its impurity. 'Truth to materials' this is not. Except that there is a kind of truth to the weird mix of synthetic stuff and the plethora of historical and pop-cultural referents available to the post-post-modern sculptor. 1 George P.

Writing on the work of Thomas Hirschhorn, Benjamin Buchloh has described contemporary sculpture as being 'in an abandoned zone' outside of legibility, to do with 'remnant objects and leftover spaces'.3 Buchloh writes: 'There are of course numerous reasons for the demise, temporary or permanent, of sculptural production. The first would appear to be the incessant overproduction of objects of consumption and their accelerated obsolescence, which have generated a vernacular of violence in the spaces of everyday life that regulates every spatio-temporal order and devalorises all object relations.'4 Embracing remnant objects, conversely, filmmaker and performance artist Jack Smith declared trash to be 'the material of creators'.5 Writing in the 1960s, Smith proposed a creative use for the excess of New York's trash, envisaging a giant junkyard in the centre of the city where 'there could be exchange that would start to develop. You could take anything you didn't want and didn't want to throw out, leave it and look for something you need.'6 Whilst Hirschhorn and Smith both use trash, foil or plaster and cheap DIY building materials to transform dead matter into habitable environments cum-shrines, Harrison makes discrete hieroglyphic forms which sit uncomfort ably, and remain isolated, in the gallery space. Her works carry an awareness of the problem of 'incessant overproduction' and the impossibility or falseness of economical, truth-to materials modernism in such a context. It is as though the artist's attempts to do 'pure form' or make photographic images reluctantly drag a mass of obsolescent matter with them. Harrison's installation at the Venice Biennale 2003, Indigenous Parts III, brought a number of sculptures together with video pieces on a makeshift scaffold structure. Like the flea-market video embedded in the piece, the precariously balanced arrangement of piled sculptural 'blobjects' and monitor screens gave an impression of the artist 'sorting through' a mass of stuff. In juxtaposing the trashy ready-made and generic sculptural language, Harrison begins a process of sifting through the excess of material form in the world and distinguishing between the instances where it is marked-out with meaning ? where itappears as a sign ? and where it appears just as unformed, label-less matter. Even the cheapest mass-produced objects ? the pale green porcelain ornament in Utopia (2,002) or the squeezable honey-bear bottles in The Honey Collector (also 2002) ? have an assured place in this system based on ownership and acquisition: on the mantelpiece or the larder shelf. 3 Benjamin Buchloh, 'Cargo and Cult: the displays of Thomas Hirschhorn', Artforum, November 2001, p.109 4 Ibid., 5 Wait for me at the bottom of the pool: The writings of Jack Smith.

Doubling back, her visualisation of sculptural stuff threatens the object's coherence and identity by representing a dimension outside of ordinary visual perception and linguistic meaning. The stuff of Harrison's work masquerades in the pretty pastel colours of cake-icing or interior domestic paint ? the falsi fying 'cement, pie crust, pastry-icing' of the modern world that Jack Smith described ? but it represents, more darkly, a visualisation of perceptual form lessness that oozes between the structures of language. What is at stake in this representation is a problematisation of the split: ready-made vs. fine art sculpture; nameable object vs stuff.7 Harrison makes an unsettling proposition in pointing to the equivalence between these two kinds of form ? between, for example, the greyish-green peas pictured on the tin and the deadness of bubbling pink plaster in Should be Home Windows... (1996). Useful matter is represented alongside its unprocessed form, or its own excess and waste. Not only are sculptural languages mixed in Harrison's work to make a bluntly compromised 'medium', but the very stuff itself resembles processed matter of no identifiable origin ? melted down, reconstituted trash which has been thickly painted over to hide the irregularities and cracks. Harrison's work is all about display, whether it is the display of art objects like framed pictures or of objects, as in a shop window. But, radically, her work does not advertise these goods or itself as things one might like to own. Similar to the blancmange-like food substance which was the subject of Larry Cohen's 1985 horror film The Stuff (first you consumed it, then it began to consume you), Harrison recognises and represents a repressed terror regarding the true nature of those overpro duced things we obsessively acquire and surround ourselves with, a recognition from which the art object is not excluded. Paul Thek and Andy Warhol's collaborative work from 1965, Meat Piece with Warhol Brillo Box, is an appropriate precedent for Harrison's combination of the discrete, branded ready-made with form that seeps outside of its register of meaning. The piece contrasts Thek's waxy lump of'meat' with the sleek colour-printed cardboard container. The flesh placed within a generic minimal form (Mike Kelley has described Warhol's boxes as 'formalism in populist drag' makes visible the violence of abstracted commodity culture.8 The Brillo box is haunted by this organic presence which seems ugly and out of place in its bright and cheerful blue-and-red logo-ed world. In her work, Harrison pushes this relationship further, binding the two kinds of matter into singular pieces in 7 Saul Anton, op. cit., p.163. In this essay Anton describes Harrison's 'strategy of delay' as one which deals with 'the aesthetic lodestars of today ... the ready made and the minimal object'. 'Should be home windows or shutters...', mixed media, dimensions variable, 1996 8 Mike Kelley, Foul Perfection: Essays and Criticism. Cambridge: MIT press, 2003, p.142. 42 I Afterall</page><page sequence="8">which the 'stuff' appears as fleshed-out shadows attached to the object-sign. Harrison presents the sign- or image-nature of photographs and consumer objects alike as though they drag ghostly apparitions of conscience with them: as bulked-out negative rather than positive space. In her installation at Camden Arts Centre, London, Posh Floored as Ali G Tackles Becks (2004), Harrison presented a group of floor-based works with an anthropomorphic quality, albeit a curiously amputated one. The limping group of pink, green and blue forms bound together with this trashy tabloid headline had something in common with the ghoulish risen dead in Michael Jackson's Thriller video. As with Jackson's werewolf transformation, there are often two faces to Harrison's work. In Sphinx (2002) the presentable 'gallery' side of the piece shows TV art-lover and nun Sister Wendy looking at ancient sculpture, framed on a plain white wall. The other side reveals the wall's construction and houses a shapeless sculptural blob. Harrison juxtaposes the safe media image of'high art' with a flipside that is both comical and frighteningly disorientating. Mike Kelley has written about Sigmund Freud's theories of the uncanny in relation to the work of Paul Thek, in describing Thek's mannequin sculpture Death of a Hippie as 'a stinking hippie in permanent fixed decay ... a pink raspberry shitsicle in answer to Walt [Disney]'s porcelain white vanilla bar'.9 Kelley, like John Landis's narrative for the Jackson video, puts his finger on the contradictory nature of the 'contrary prettiness' of American culture. In the 3 exhibition programme for his T?te Liverpool show on the same theme, Kelley traced his feeling of the 'uncanny' back to his childhood, where the provocation of a confrontation between 'me' and 'it' was so highly charged that it led to 'me' and 'it' becoming confused. A similar confusion is what is uncomfortably at play in the ugly, unassimilable shapes of Harrison's sculptures. With their display function, pastel colours and scale ? not to mention occasional tricks such as the wig hung on top of her lime-green piece titled Cindy (2004) ? they bear some resemblance to mannequins. Moreover, the lumpy, painted-over quality suggests an interior that has been choked or mummified. Overloaded with reference points, Harrison's sculptures have a ghost-like quality that haunts and disrupts aesthetic categories. The artist's juxtaposition of ugliness and ornament, and the work's humour and irreverence give it ghoulish corpulence that makes the works appear as contemporary grotesques reflecting upon the absurd extravagances of their own existence. 9 Ibid.
