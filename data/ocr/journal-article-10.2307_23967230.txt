Vincent Brummer has made a notable contribution to the philo sophy of religion, not only by his own writings, but also by his stimulation of discussion of the subject in a wider European con text, and particularly with British scholars. It is fitting therefore</page><page sequence="2">SHORT NOTICES 501 that this collection of nineteen essays in his honour should include five from authors working in Britain, and one from Sweden, as well as those of his Dutch friends and colleagues. All the essays are in English. They deal mainly with basic questions of theistic belief and of morality. The impression of randomness, which is difficult to avoid with a Festschrift, could have been much reduced if the essays had been arranged topically rather than in alphabetical order of authors; they are in fact a reasonably coherent assembly of useful essays in current philosophy of religion. Keith Ward's brief piece, entitled 'Is God a Person?' and giving a firm but carefully qualified negative answer, offers an interesting critique of the more anthropomorphic assumptions which appear to under lie some of the other more precise discussions of theistic concepts.
