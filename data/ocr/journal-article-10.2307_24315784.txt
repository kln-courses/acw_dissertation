<plain_text><page sequence="1">Praise I CUOw of the Mesoamerican Body</page><page sequence="2">Editorial Time for Another Aesthetic Experience Alberto Ruy Sánchez When a culture runs as deeply and strongly as ours does, new ways to appreciate it are inevitably discovered. And the pre Hispanic world has been in need of some exposure, of being denuded at least momentarily, so that we might appreciate the forms of its bodies from another angle. 23 We do not presume to suggest that they do not belong to their own time, to the mentality of their time. The idea here is to stimulate our senses, our sensibility, to take those bodies that were sculpted or molded by ancient Mexicans and surrender them naturally to our eyes, even for an in stant. We want to show that they be long to our time in many different ways. This does not mean disregarding the importance of learning about the past era when they were molded or carved. We are attempting to multiply our per spective. to shift and broaden our sen sibilities. To use new eyes to touch our most ancient bodies of stone and clay as a way of renewing their lives, their meanings. And to demonstrate that we can now lay claim to a new experimen tal knowledge, without belittling what is already known about them. 23 So, as he himself explains on these pages. Sergio Raúl Arroyo had the idea of giv ing an opportunity to the aesthetic ex perience that these marvelous figures have to offer. In finding a new way of displaying them, whether in an exhibi tion or on the pages of this publica tion, we place our bodies in direct con tact with the bodies that ancient Mex icans represented in stone and clay over a period of several centuries. And allow wonderment to come as quick ly as erudition in order to form a more complete wisdom from the two. This can no doubt be translated into a new kind of tribute to the mPJ Mesoamerican body. 23 Other voices offer their own tribute here. The artist Felipe Ehrenberg states that it is precisely in "the 'jd opening we call art [...] where we can stop a moment to under- ¿jflli' stand, among other mysteries, the mWM meaning of the body." David Huer- jr-apt/ ta adds a poetic vision of this aes- Ba thetic decipherment, taken from a Kl number of cultural and historic per- «•'; spectives. Christian Duverger reflects on how eroticism was sanctioned in the symbolic economy of the ancient world. And Alfredo López Austin pro vides the cornerstone, with vital infor mation on the Mesoamerican con ception of the body in this indispen sable, appealing and rich synthesis of ideas. 23 Many of the selected art works—whether spectacular, touching or humorous—break with the orthodox view of pre-Hispanic aesthetics. Some are frankly troubling, and their authen ticity has even been questioned. But they are presented here to skeptics of all kinds with the assumption that they are still open for discussion, and well worth the risk. To doubt is healthy, and invites us to expand our s knowledge. Hiding such BS pieces does not achieve ^ anything. 23 This proj- jjt ect of praising and de- 0 nuding art is basic to b the editorial vision of Artes de México, where * we have always offered delight together with in sight, where our readers are invited to take part in the adventure of under standing with wonderment.

Cosmos of Clay and Stone in Praise _ of the Body Sergio Raúl Arroyo The paths of language run across the territory of the body. This is where the powerful truth of trag ic ceremonies and celebratory rites, of epiphany and grief, of Dionysian feasts and the mitote dance have unfurled their powerful truth. The body—altar or sack of bones, home or exile—exists in the redoubts of intimacy as well as in the public space of the town square. Corporeality is what has defined hu man groups and has been the ideal setting for expressing each civilization's world image. It has either permitted a comprehension of the universe or filled it with mystery. 23 Perhaps one of mo dernity's greatest adventures has been its determination to understand the creations of antiquity and the cultures that fall outside the sphere of techni cal reason deriving from encyclopedic rationalism and the industrial revolu tion. This approach was one of the ex perimental tendencies in avant-garde art and artistic and anthropological theory that permeated the latter part of the nineteenth century and practi cally all of the twentieth. Clearly, much of modern art may be seen as testi mony to a non-Western blood transfu sion in the ideas and structures of the ater, painting, literature and the domi nant aesthetic disciplines in both Euro pean and American cities, disciplines in which multiple peripheral perceptions made the body malleable material, converting it into the axis mundi of many formal quests. 23 At the dawn of the twenty-first century, is it possible for such longstanding artworks to dia logue with present-day cares and con cerns and respond to our preferences and affinities, not only due to the for mal fascination they hold for us, but because in their profane light, we see them as a challenge to our vision of reality? 23 In Mexico and elsewhere, many modern intellectuals exempt from univocal interpretations believed in the promiscuity of thought, seeing it as a vaccination against Orthodoxy. They felt that the Mesoamerican world's transit through the present had not yet drawn to an end and that it could be seen as an alternative, opposed to the idea of man as a universal subject. 23 In essence, this publication, illustrated with pieces from every region of Mex ico's pre-Hispanic geography, propos es to recognize different signs and readings of the universe that ancient peoples made through the body, and how, in every body part, they expressed and articulated relationships and ten sions with the cosmos, thus forming a kind of organic knowledge. But on the other hand, the publication also at tempts to use these works created somewhere between the first millen nium before our era and the sixteenth century to situate us on the threshold of a manner of seeing and understand ing human nature, which possessed an integrity that the Christian tradition would eventually break or weaken. This will provide a glimpse of the dif ferent ideas and impulses regarding the body that marked many ancestral cultures. This is.a particularly valuable lesson today, when the body is widely trivialized or demonized in the planet's ideological panorama. The Body as Frontier It would seem that at crucial times, when certainties and paradigms lose all meaning, new ways of thinking con stantly depend on reflection regarding the statute of the body. This has al ways been the Western tendency, its standard for describing a mobile fron tier whence the imprint and achieve ments of scientific, political and philo sophical knowledge may be observed: Platonic and neo-Platonic thinkers sup porting the separation between body and soul; Cartesians defining the hu man physis with an epistemological sequence that involves medicine, biol ogy and legal science, disciplines that placed their utilitarian spirit above all else; certain contemporary philosoph ical and anthropological tendencies which have suggested deciphering the body as a sum total of fragments that have as much to do with economic practice as they do with physiology and psychology. 23 However, it is pos sible to discover certain codes in the realm of art that express the relation ship between the body and language as a key to understanding the past and present beyond scientific-conceptual parameters. 23 Based on an atypical affinity between different indigenous pieces from antiquity that until now had kept a certain chronological and spatial distance, this tribute to the body suggests possible connections be tween differentiated formal traditions to take the risk of seeking an escape route from historicizing stereotypes. 23 Here we are pointed in a direction that has scarcely been explored: si multaneously classing a group of an cient pieces together with artworks and archaeological materials, thus partially dismantling their traditional historic condition which camouflaged or hid from view certain essential ele ments of their human dimension to turn them into pure hard facts. This operation shows how each piece can develop its physical power and stop be ing a mere fragmentary reference of time to reveal itself as an aesthetic ex perience, which will cause the specta tor to wonder about what establishes and regulates his or her own notions of the body's design. 23 There are cer tain constants in this tribute to the body: sexuality, fertility, the nude, and Opposite page: Huastec teenager.

Wide hips as a focal point is a characteristic that is symptomatically repeated a thousand years later, in the mythic tale of Huémac and his demand for a woman several spans wide, which was the beginning of the end for the Toltecs. Elsewhere, but no less obses sively, this feature was common in fu nerary offerings in the West, whose in habitants were, however, given to de picting extremities and facial features in an abbreviated form, barely suggest ing their presence with a few lines. Bellies ripe for bearing children and round, sensual volumes were not un usual in Olmec sculptures and Mayan bas-reliefs, where the body prefigures the anthropomorphic profile of the in visible world. 25 This is why such "fab ulous" bodies as the bird-men or the jaguar-men did not seem impossible to them: this blend of two different na tures that had been closely observed and studied in great detail, the fantas tic cross of man and animal that cele brated theophanies and divine forces, perhaps with the same kind of harmo ny with which centaurs and sphinxes were imagined in other parts of the world. 25 The artists contemplated and rigorously reproduced the biological extremes: children and old men and women, the two poles of a voyage from birth to death, visual constants of all pre-Hispanic cultures. An infinity of examples create the lines of this pub lication. The Olmec sculptures with childlike features are particularly strik ing. Children and elders act as snap shots of daily life in Western Mexico, as do the old gods. 25 These represen tations were closely connected to reli gious and ideological modes of thought, the central scaffolding of any cosmogony. The body was an energy node, and not just for each individual: it was exalted when it understood itself to be food for the gods themselves, a personal and community obligation that demanded bodies for sacrifice. Aparicios Tombstone is a piece from the Gulf Coast featuring an emblem that became common in all Meso american cultures: a decapitated per son's blood nourishing the cosmos and permitting its movement. This was a the all-encompassing theme of beauty. Within these four aspects, the body's reality is inexorably pierced by nature, divinity and humanity, frequently com ing close to the enigmatic view that the ancient inhabitants of Mexico's coasts, mountain ranges, valleys and jungles seemed to take of the human figure. 25 The works were selected to demon strate the many different materials the artists used with such symbolic and practical efficiency for 3000 years, and which are now true witnesses to the passage of entire societies. The idea is to represent that world's expressive plurality—almost in the form of an in ventory—and insofar as is possible, to articulate the symbolism surrounding the possible status of everything hav ing to do with the body. Archetype and Sensibility The image of the human body in pre Hispanic societies is revealed to be quite profound, based on precise phys ical knowledge, gained through the meticulous scrutiny of the organism and its functions. Some impressive ex amples of the detailed dissection of the body's topography include a Zapotee pedestal in the form of a spinal column; figures of women who have died in childbirth, with fixed gazes and flaccid bellies; the simpler but realistic lines of a toy-like Toltec piece portraying a woman carrying a child in her belly; or, with functions leading to a semantic explosion, a stone that, using the effect of its natural form, with no need for any kind of metamorphosis, bears the lines of a heart ripped out of a human chest, the heart being the center and sign of the beginning and end of uni versal movement. 25 This is art made with a keen eye, useful for rites of pas sage but also perhaps for an unknown therapeutic discourse that may have combined ecstasy, pain and pleasure: just think of the polychrome Mayan pot with a figure giving itself an enema, where the organic interior is seen as an invisible mechanism, like the inner workings of souls or tona and their incantations, potions and prayers to balance cold, wet qualities with warm, dry ones. 25 Sometimes the pre-His panic taste—or archetype—tended toward voluptuousness: the wide hips of the female figures from pre-Classic cultures of the Alti</page><page sequence="5">condition for the existence of time. Sometimes represented in torrents that take the form of serpents, or transmut ed into bouquets of flowers, blood liquid flesh—is used in all its states, from the fluidity that impregnates punches, paper and textiles in self sacrifice or in the smearing of pieces associated with the imagery, to clotting as one of the irrefutable expressions of divine acceptance. 2 Thus, birth and death are two sides of the same coin: sacredness bursts through, rein tegrating the lost unity between the vis ible world and the divine world with blood. It also mythically explains the subsidiary place of humans since their origin: in the Náhuatl tale, Quetzalcóatl soaked the ancestors' "precious bones" with the blood from his self-sacrifice. The first men were created from the bones and they were given the cosmic significance of macehuales, or the de serving by penitence, according to Mi guel León-Portilla's translation. 2 For centuries, disturbing creations that bore a certain resemblance to the Ars moriendi of medieval and Renaissance Europe—for example, representations of the gods of the underworld, chilling images of animate skeletons—led to stereotyped ideas regarding pre-His panic societies. In ancient indigenous cultures, the body and death had a deeper and more constant relationship. In fact, that relationship permeated much of their artistic production, includ ing those works that interpretative tra dition has qualified as exclusively deal ing with events in political history, such as images of captives in extreme con ditions of submission prior to sacrifice. In this case, the order of the universe was associated with the need to feed the gods with the forces stored in bod ies and their blood in order to ensure the culture's own existence and the fulfillment of destiny. 23 The body was treated in both a solemn and playful manner, both hieratically and dynam ically. This perhaps explains the sense of containment, that stasis seen in the sculptural bodies of most stone gods— the Chac Mools, for instance, or some Mayan, Zapotee and Teotihuacano rit ual braziers modeled from clay, and, of course, in the Mexica warriors who hold such impossible postures, useful for transmitting the message of power and dignity with which the rites were anointed. The rigidity of those bodies contrasts with those of smiling female figures and the kinetic figures of con tortionists and ballgame players. The skill at portraiture may be seen as a counterpoint to that rigidity, as in the case of the figures from Jaina, in par ticular. All these examples emphasize a knowledge of human nature but also the desire to use the forms demanded by the cosmos. Movement is at times merely a suggestion, as in the repre sentation of Xipe Totee, which forces us to imagine the process of skinning someone to dress the god. Here—as we have seen occur with blood and viscera in other examples—the skin is a frag ment of the body whose death brings new life. 23 The face's expressiveness has its own canons. It is possible to ex plore a vast territory that accounts for the use of heads and faces, from the abstraction that produces facial fea tures which refer more to styles than to specific individual details—as in the case of the colossal Olmec heads, as well as certain masks from Mezcala and Teotihuacan—to profiles with rec ognizable identities and attributes that would be more properly interpreted ac cording to their iconography. In the lat ter instance we can point to the Mayan headstones for dignitaries and their families, as well as representations of divinities with the specific traits that endowed them with an identity. In the midst of this thematic multiplicity there are stylistic traditions in which the fa cial expression itself remits us to a synesthesia: bodies in ecstasy, pain as an altered state of consciousness, as seen in the images of self-sacrifice in Palenque. With the pieces from Las Remojadas, Veracruz, the features take on a regional stereotype in the fig ures' joyful smiles. 23 Religion and art sublimated basic functions and drive. Their manifestations survived in ritu als and tales commemorating the ori gin of humanity, as well as in mythic and artistic references to the birth of each culture. Food and excretion, sen suality and reproduction were repre sented pictographically in the codices of the Altiplano, the Mayan region and the Puebla Mixtee group, not to men tion in totemic sculptures such as a Fluastec phallus from Yahualica, and in parietal paintings such as the Olmec paintings in the Oxtotitlán caverns in the mountains of Guerrero. 2 The task of showing the endless ways in which the body was represented in Mexican antiquity can be an enjoyable antidote to orthodoxy, cutting through genres and traditional views of what an exhib it of pre-Hispanic pieces should be, and transcending the common and er roneous distinction between art and knowledge. 2 The disconcerting artis tic and spiritual imagination that fills these pieces with meaning calls for a progressive adjustment of our sensi bility. The continuity of the theme of the body in those cultures acts as a guide through that society, and a prodigious bridge between reality and a dream world, making the invisible visible and incubating the infinite in the finite. The body's doors open to a cosmic experi ence and human immediacy. 23 The creations shown here were slowly dis tilled by old traditions that laid out their fears and desires in representations of men, women, animals and gods whose interlacing lives gave their civilization a unique sign. To contemplate the body's territory this way, to take note of its forms and possibilities, is to actively witness the vast spectacle of nature. 2 Translated by Michelle Suderman Living Cosmos The Mesoamerican Conception of the Body Alfredo López Austin The Kaleidoscope Two wondrous things: first, the human body's astonishing system; second, the imposing construction of its multiple meanings.

In doing so we split ourselves into two, arriving at an insoluble dichotomy— "this is me and that is my body"—that confronts an implausible self with an equally implausible Other: the body. We thus turn our body into an interlocutor, playing a game in which a fictional mir ror reflects two virtual images of noth ing real. By demarcating the body's out line, we transform it into something alien—a temporary dwelling that is sometimes inhabited, sometimes va cant. But on the contrary, we also iden tify our body with our people, our fellow men, our ancestors and our descen dents, and then the self becomes an ephemeral being, a mere link in a long genealogical chain. 23 In any case, the body lies at the center—a mediator be tween the macrocosm and the micro cosm. It is the point of convergence of universal shapes and laws. It is an ar chetype and a measuring rod. It pro jects itself into infinity and is the focus of external projections. It reflects with in itself the lights of the night sky and the underground fire of volcanoes, and it resonates with the vibrations of ani mals, plants, stones, lightning. It is the subject of metaphors. And the body's tongue is the organ that pronounces any and all truths. 23 Every cosmovi sion includes its own conception of the body. In spite of the human organism's manifest uniqueness, diverse cultures have created multiple images of it, per ceiving it through countless lenses that lend different shapes and colors to rep resentations of the universe. There is no limit to the number of cosmovisions because they are made from little shreds of history; their plurality derives from the human adventure's complexi ty—the countless roads our species has walked along on the earth's rugged surface. Today as perhaps never before, in our current state of historical tur moil, we need to be deeply aware of ourselves, and our self-awareness and modes of thought confront us with a new dimension of universal history, sit uating us as an Other in a community of Others. Today, we must step outside our individualistic cloisters and rid our t selves of our unhealthy obsession with being the sole possessors of truth in order to get a clearer idea of our real ity. We cannot remain indifferent to the thinking of others: it lets us see our selves in a new light; the Other shows us that we are part of a complex di versity. 23 We can perceive much of the Other's way of thinking in non-Western conceptions of the body; likewise, we will have a great deal to reflect upon after examining the Other's perspec tive on our own way of thinking. An Agricultural Cosmovision Some 4500 years ago, certain Amer indian peoples settled south of the Tropic of Cancer—what is now south ern Mexico and western Central Amer ica—and underwent a transition from nomadic hunting and gathering to sed entary farming. It was a gradual and yet important change. The path had al ready been laid several centuries ear lier with the domestication and cultiva tion of useful plants: gourds, squash, beans, corn, maguey, cacti, tomatoes, avocados, amaranth, chili peppers and cotton, to name but a few. Some sources claim that corn had been domesticat ed 2500 years earlier and that nomadic growers became more and more de pendent on its cultivation until it led to an economic transformation that re quired permanent settlements. 23 The sedentary lifestyle changed early farm ers' outlook. Nomadic ancestors' be liefs were not forsaken but rather took on new meanings; their values changed and a mode of thinking evolved as pop ulation density increased and the ex change of ideas intensified. 2c Like many other cultures around the world, Mesoamerica's classification of the world was dualistic and based on com plementary opposites. We can be al most certain that Mesoamerican dual ism derived from the beliefs of hunters and gatherers, but we may also sup pose that regional inhabitants' primary interest in crops made them focus on the contrast between the rainy and dry seasons. In many tropical areas, the climatic cycle consists of six months of drought followed by six months of rain, from May to October. In the agri cultural conception of complementary opposites, the rainy season was asso ciated with the symbolic unity of the woman: femininity, pregnancy, germi nation, dampness, darkness, the stock piling of reserves, the underworld and death as the generator of life. Mean while, the dry season was tied to mas culinity, impregnation, dryness, light, the sky, expenditure and the enjoy ment of life. A new agricultural symbol filled the Mesoamerican existence with meaning: corn's life cycle became the great archetype of the universal cycle of life and death. Corn, the primary form of sustenance, was stored in the enormous vault at the heart of the sacred mountain. The mountain stood at the center of the universe: it was the axis mundi, with the cosmic tree growing upon its summit and the world of the dead buried deep within its bowels. In mythical times, the axis mundi had projected outward to the north, south, east and west to form the four pillars that separated the earth from the sky. Each replica of the mountain—distinguished by the spe cific color of the point of the compass to which it referred—had its own stockpile of corn, overseen by the gods of rain. 23 With a sedentary existence, time became a more important sign of the gods' presence than space. The calendar established when crops had to be sown and harvested, when cer tain tasks had to be performed and when the gods who changed nature's colors should be worshipped. Seden tary farmers also developed new meth ods of observing the sky. Nomads had charted the passing of stars across the celestial vault without fixed points of reference; farmers calculated astro nomical time more exactly according to the rising and setting of stars at pre cise points on a single horizon's crag gy silhouette. 23 This new vision of the universe—which was largely the result of the increased systematization of ag ricultural tasks—took root in societies that overcame ethnic and linguistic dif ferences, the distances separating them and the variety of environments to build strong ties with each other. Mesoamer ica's climatic diversity led to an early specialization in terms of food produc tion, and thus to extensive trade. It can be said that the Mesoamerican concept of the cosmos was from the outset a collaborative creation transcending its creators' social and environmental par ticularities. But we must qualify this statement: various ethnic groups' vi sions of the universe, in terms of their structures and basic principles, had a 78</page><page sequence="7">nucleus of common elements; but par ticularities, especially regional ones, are always an important aspect of a specific conception of the universe. 23 The hard core of the great Mesoamer ican tradition was the basis for its con tinuity in the face of great historical transformations. Mesoamerica sur vived for four millennia. An initially egalitarian life in villages was sup planted by the emergence of hierar chic societies, a ruling class, cities and states, the splendor of the Classic peri od and the military regimes' struggle for expansion. Many Mesoamerican peoples left an indelible mark on his tory—the Huastecs, Zapotees, Mayas, Otomíes, Olmecs, Toltecs, Mixtees, Me xicas (also known somewhat less than accurately as Aztecs), Teotihuacanos, Totonacs and Tarascans are all cul tures with powerful idiosyncrasies. However, they were also all linked by the Mesoamerican tradition's core con cepts and thus had common beliefs regarding the composition of the hu man body, health, illness, sexuality, medicine, morality, pleasure and death. 23 In the sixteenth century Me soamerica experienced its downfall before the sudden onslaught of the Eu ropeans. However, in spite of the con quest, evangelization, increased pover ty and centuries of colonial repression, indigenous peoples today still adhere to certain central concepts from this great tradition—including, of course, those concerning the human body. The Creation of the World In order to understand Mesoamerican beliefs about the creation of the world, we might begin by referring to ancient concepts of divinity. Mesoamericans attributed powers of division, projec tion, fission and fusion to the gods, by means of which the latter split or frag mented their substance, dividing their qualities between two or more entities, or merged with each other to form a composite divine being. Thus, for in stance, the god of rain was depicted as four beings: four gods equal to him, in four different colors, one in each corner of the world. His power thus extended over the earth's entire surface as he built a reservoir beside each cosmic « pillar so the whole world would have rain. The opposite process occurs with the nine lords of the underworld as they fuse into a single being that, in turn, is the nemesis of the being formed by the fusion of the thirteen lords of the heavens. Continuing this process, all the gods merged into either the Fa ther God or the Mother Goddess and this dual figure finally combined to be come the Single God, the source of everything divine. 23 Mesoamerican mythology refers to a primeval time of adventures and exploits when the gods who were the offspring of the divine couple prepared for the moment of cre ation. This period began when the sun rose for the very first time. The sun god exemplified the fate of his siblings with his own sacrifice. His death at dusk followed by his resurrection at dawn the next day had transformed him into the ruler of the future kingdom of living things; but at the same time his daily journey through the heavens and the underworld had made him part of the cycle of life and death. The gods had to follow the sun's example, and each one made the sacrifice of forming part of the cycle of life and death. The process determined the birth of creatures, as each god, through his (or her) sacri fice, gave of his own substance for cre ation. projecting a part of himself into a worldly being in his image, who was his offspring and protégé. This is how creators and their creations became consubstantial and inseparable. 23 Each god created a specific type of be ing: animals, plants, minerals, stars, elements. The world consisted of mor tal beings who carried within them selves a differentiated portion of divine substance—the indestructible recep tacle of their essential characteristics. Individuals died but their essential di vine part traveled unharmed to the world of the dead and was stored in an enormous vault inside the sacred mountain, so the gods could use it once again to make another living creature of the same type. Man's Idiosyncrasy The Popol Vuh, the sacred book of the Mayan people of the Guatemalan high lands, is the colonial work that best al lows us to understand ancient Meso american myths. It describes the cre ation of human beings and which char acteristics were given them by the gods. 23 The gods had already created animals, but these had not lived up to their creators' expectations: their voic es lacked the power to invoke them, praise them and make them offerings. 23 The next proposal was to create more gifted beings. The gods decided to make their bodies out of earth, but they turned out to be limp of limb, did not have the strength to move, and could not see clearly. They possessed the power of speech from the outset but lacked discernment. Moreover, they were unable to reproduce. The disappointed gods decided to destroy their imperfect creation. 23 In a second attempt, the gods made two figures, a man and a woman. They made the man's body out of colorín wood and the woman's out of bulrushes. These crea tures talked, multiplied and were able to move their bodies. However, they were clumsy and wandered aimlessly on all fours; they had no soul or power of understanding; they did not wor ship their creators; their faces were gaunt, their hands and feet were ill shaped and they did not have blood, moisture or fat. The gods destroyed this creation as well and the few wood-and rush beings that survived were turned into monkeys. 23 The gods made yet another attempt. This time they man aged to aptly choose the substances they would use to make human beings' bodies: white and yellow corn. These creations became the definitive human beings—those who were able to carry Urn with the image of Mictlantecuhtli. Mexica culture. Alabaster. 16.5 cm high x 11 cm in diameter.

Human beings are differentiated from all other creatures by their ability to establish a reciprocal relationship with the gods. Their ideal faculties for such a purpose are under standing, language and their species' ability to multiply, thus allowing them to transcend death so the worship of their creators may continue. As a re ward, the people of corn were allowed to reap the earth's precious fruits and live far from the wild regions. They were granted the ability to sustain them selves and make use of other creatures without suffering the fate (at least as a rule) of being governed or eaten by other worldly beings—unlike animals and the two types of failed protohumans. 23 However, human beings seemed a lit tle too gifted. They possessed wisdom. Their eyesight was far-reaching and they could thus observe the entire celes tial vault and survey the whole of the earth's surface, what lay hidden or dis tant, the world's most remote corners. The gods feared that their creations would become equal to them and then cease worshipping them and breeding. They then limited the perfection of their creations: Heart of Heaven breathed into their eyes so they became steamed up and only able to see nearby objects clearly. This became human beings' definitive corporeal condition. Generic and Specific Myths about the Creation of Humans Analyzing myths allows us to discover some of their inherent contradictions and how the latter were resolved. Me soamericans had a creationist view of the world. According to this concep tion, the world remained unchanged from the point in time when divine will had crystallized its original shape. As a result, species held on to their essen tial characteristics over generations, in such a way that terrestrial beings from any period subsequent to creation were identical to those of primeval times. 23 Creationism presents serious prob lems, above all in the way it attempts to justify its organization into classes and subclasses. In the case of human beings, for instance, speech was considered one of the species' great original gifts; but if language was essential, then so were different forms of it. The fact that different ethnic groups displayed a di versity of physical features in spite of human bodies' alleged sameness was another similar problem. Forms of wor ship were also thought to have been re vealed at the beginning of the world, both generally and specifically with re gard to distinct groups' particular ritu als. The same held true for different trades which were seen as character istic of specific groups, bequeathed to them by patron deities. This was also the case of traditions, institutions, and so forth. 23 The cosmic principle of the fusion and fission of the gods, trans lated to the realm of creation, provid ed the logical answer to this problem. The god who had created human be ings in his image and likeness from his own substance and become their pa tron deity was a single being; but the god's power of subdivision was de ployed in repeated acts of creation. This is why there are two different kinds of narrative concerning the origin of hu man beings in Mesoamerican mythol ogy. On the one hand, there are gener al narratives, like the Mexica myth de scribing the god Quetzalcóatl's descent into the underworld where Mictlante cuhtli, the god of the dead, gave him human bones and ashes which he then took to Tamoanchan—the site of the great creation—to mix them with the blood that he drew from his own penis after piercing it. On the other hand, there are creation myths that imply or clearly refer to the specific formation of. different human groups. One myth from this second category indeed par allels the tale of Quetzalcóatl: it is the god Xólotl's descent to the world of the dead. Xólotl extracts inert matter and many gods bleed onto it. This plu ral act of creation takes place in Chi comóztoc, the mountain of the seven caves. This is quite significant, as many other myths that refer to the emer gence of different ethnic groups men tion Chicomóztoc. They describe how groups emerge in series of seven, each one of them from the depths of one of the mother-caves. There is also an interesting middle ground between myths of a general origin and those of differentiated origins: the tale of the wondrous city (Tollan. Tulán, Zuyuá] lo cated in the world of the gods where all human beings lived before the dawn of the world. There they spoke a single tongue and they all carried out the same, simple act of worship. Quiché and Cakchiquel myths say that humans were driven out of this original city in groups and that as they left, the god Nacxit (the Mayan equivalent of the Mexica god Quetzalcóatl) gave each group a statue of their patron deity, a particular language and other char acteristics that would remain intrinsic to them upon the earth. 23 The pro jection of the act of creation of human beings was also expressed in the belief in creator-gods of different hierarchic levels. Therefore, Quetzalcóatl was the patron-creator of humanity; but there were also creator-deities of ethnic groups—Mixtécatl, patron deity of the Mixtees; Otómitl, patron of the Otomies; and Cuextécatl, patron of the Huastecs. Gods at a lower level of the hierarchy represented the members of groups related by kinship or living in a given area who saw themselves as linked by a common ancestry harkening back to a mythical origin. The Nahuas called this deity calputéotl, i.e. the god of the calpulli or parental group. 23 In this way. human beings, though essential 80 Cradle and baby. Apachital, Veracruz. Clay.

The Origin of Gender, Work and the Gender-Based Division of Labor According to Fray Gerónimo de Men dieta, the myth concerning the origin of humans mentions the creation of two beings, one male and the other female, out of the combination of an inert sub stance with the gods' life-giving blood. The male child was born on the fourth day and the female child four days after him. 2&gt; The distinction between male and female had a divine model. Two elderly gods called Oxomoco and Cipactónal in Náhuatl were the arche types of human beings' sexual differ entiation. Their exemplary nature was so obvious that the Spaniards com pared them to the biblical Adam and Eve. There is little documentary evi dence in terms of either image or text regarding these two gods; but it is clear which characteristics the human race inherits from them. Their most impor tant bequest is doubtless gender dif ferentiation. Another is the innateness of work: an activity seen as part of the human essence because the gods decided that the two senior archetypes should not "be idle, but rather always working." This explains why the dead continue to work in the other world in the Mesoamerican cosmovision. Com bining these two elements leads to the division of labor on the basis of gen der. In the documentary source that mentions this, it is not totally clear whether farming is an exclusively male activity. Indeed, the text seems to sug gest that it belongs to both elderly gods, though it does state that spin ning yarn and weaving pertain to the goddess, as do some magical process es of healing and divination which she handed down to women. In addition to the above, both Oxomoco and Cipactó nal are the inventors of the calendar based order of things, the reckoning of fate, the Book of Dreams, the picto graphic codices and the use of medic inal plants. They are usually depicted carrying a priest's censer and satchel, a bone needle that was used for draw ing glyphs and the knotted strings and corn kernels used in divination. In short, human work consists of knowledge able actions that are tied to commu nication with the other world and that enrich ancestral tradition. What Human Beings Are Made Of Like many other cultures, Mesoamer icans thought that human beings pos sessed two types of substance; howev er. we cannot say that they conceived of these as material and spiritual in the strict sense. Rather, we can speak of two kinds of matter: one heavy, dense, opaque, tangible, and the other light, subtle, invisible, intangible. Heavy mat ter corresponds to the individual's worldly, mortal side. i.e. the vessel that contains the intangible. Light matter, on the other hand, is divine, and hence indestructible. The first is bound to this world while the latter, once unbound from heavy matter, can travel to the world of the gods—sometimes even during an individual's life. 2&gt; It would be absurd to think that the true nature of the individual resides in only one of these two types of matter. The relation ship between the two must be harmo nious. Though the light substance is dis tributed throughout the body, it settles mostly in certain organs which allow it to function. The heart, for instance, is the seat of thought; the gall-bladder con tains the "angerer" (bile); passions in general are located in the liver, while the kidneys are associated with bodily pleasures, presumably alluding specif ically to sexual pleasure. S The body as a whole is on the same level as the great cosmic figures or exceptional worldly creatures. As a cosmic image, the body was compared to Chicomóztoc —the mountain that was the origin of all peoples, depicted with seven ori fices: two eye sockets, two nostrils, a mouth, an anus and a navel. In a differ ent version, the sacred number of ori fices is thirteen, adding the two exteri or ear ducts, two armpits, the urinary tract and the fontanel. S Similar con cepts continue to exist among indige nous peoples to this day. According to Alfonso Villa Rojas, Mayas of the Yucatán peninsula still believe that the organ ism is a replica of the universe, a struc ture divided into four sectors and a cen tral point which regulates the entire system. A kind of small, tomato-shaped organ located behind the navel and called the tipté occupies this central place. Its beating regulates the rhythm of the other organs and all the body's veins issue from it. Mayas today believe that if the tipté moves out of its prop er place, one becomes pale and thin after losing one's appetite, sexual desire and sleep. E&gt; Human beings are mod eled on the corn plant. Mexicas com pared newborns to the plant: "[Now] you emerge into this world. Here you grow and bloom." If the newborn did not thrive, they thought of it as a blighted cob. However, some rituals—which are still practiced—were meant to foster the parallel growth of corn and human beings. For instance, among present day Tzotzils, the child's umbilical cord is cut over a corn cob. The grains, cov ered in blood, are sown in a field known as "the blood of the child" and the plants that grow in this field are tied to the individual's destiny. The Complex Spiritual Nature of Humans The light substance within human beings was not formed by a single spir itual being, but rather by a series of con stantly shifting beings, each one with a different nature, origin and function. 2&gt; The most important spiritual entity resided in the heart. It was the consub stantial part of the patron deity, and thus lent the individual his or her human character and identification with dif ferent groups. This entity was insepa rable from the living body. Though the ability to think resided in various organs, the heart's spiritual entity was the main seat of reason and feelings. This entity could be injured by sexual transgres sions, phlegm secreted inside the organ ism and magic spells. In the first case, the sinner had to confess in order to be healed. The entity was often possessed by gods who induced thoughts and pos itive as well as negative actions, from artistic inspiration to lust to frankly anti social acts. Mexicas referred to it as the soul that traveled to an otherworld ly existence. G Other spiritual entities whose nature is also divine are of a dif ferent, non-human origin. The heart's soul connects an individual to his or her fellow creatures, while the others tend to individuate a person, shape his or her character and personal fate, and determine his or her position in the social context. This is the case of the tonalli among ancient Náhuatl-speak ing peoples, including the Mexicas. 81</page><page sequence="10">in character, remembering and for getting were all caused by this plural ity of souls and were manifestations of an ongoing inner dialogue. An indi vidual did not have a definite nature: the accidents in one's personal histo ry profoundly transformed it. 23 To make this picture even more complex, we must add that the human body was not a discrete whole due to the fact that its spiritual entities had strong bonds with the outer world: with the sacred mountain, with the super-natu ral being who lived inside the moun tain, with ancestors, stars, companion animals or with the land one cultivated, since the vital force of a farmer's fam ily was tied to his crops. The Heavy Part of a Human Being Early documentary sources do not pro vide a wealth of detail about ancient ideas concerning the human organism. However, the information that does exist may provide us with an enlighten ing panorama. 23 The navel was an image of the cosmos, marking the cen ter of the body as the distribution cen ter for ducts that ran through the rest of the organism. The navel also bound the individual to the place associated with his primary social functions, since a male child's afterbirth was buried on the battlefield and a female child's next to the hearth. 23 Body parts or organs were linked by nerves, ligaments and tendons—undifferentiated matter re garded as simply binding the organ ism together. Articulations were con sidered to be loaded with life energy, and as such ran the risk of being in vaded by cold supernatural beings— among them the rain gods—who pro duced arthrosis. The skeleton was not only the body's structural framework, but the source of life's regeneration; semen was produced in the bone mar row which was also thought to restore physical energy. 23 Muscles were all irrigated by blood, thanks to which they acquired life, strength and were able to grow. Blood vessels allowed blood to be uniformly distributed throughout the body; but it is hard to know whether Mesoamericans believed in its perma nent circulation. The pulse was consid ered an intermittent movement of the nerves, produced by a spiritual entity. Fat was also thought of as restorative One rite that ancient Nahuas practiced during the first days of a child's life was to gather the divine powers radiated by the sun on a propitious day and then introduce the light into the child's body. It was the newborn's "second birth." Rays of sun were collected in a bowl of water and the liquid was poured over the child's head. This is how the child acquired his or her life force, a secret name [corresponding to a specific day in a 260-day cycle) and a destiny. Given that days were considered to be gods who invaded the world on a daily basis, the tonalli's introduction was indeed a form of divine possession. The individ ual was supposed to protect his tonal li by behaving properly, since one's con duct could exacerbate the positive or negative aspects of one's destiny.

Nayarit Regional Museum. frightened. A fright was considered very dangerous since the tonalli could then be captured by earth deities, and this had grievous consequences in terms of the scared person's health. 23 Nowadays, the spiritual entity that one shares with another being (fre quently an animal) is called the tona. Once the bond has been established between the child and his or her com panion, their fates and characters are also intertwined. If the animal is a ja guar, the person will be important; if it is a deer, he or she will be easily scared; if it is a mouse, his or her posi tion in the community will be insignifi cant. That the human's and the ani mal's destinies are conjoined implies that if one becomes ill or dies, so does the other. Contemporary ethnography documents the fact that many indi genous peoples believe that a single individual possesses several tonas ruled over by the most powerful one. 23 There are other spiritual entities as well: one that is introduced into the child during a special ceremony and gives him or her physical strength and the ability to breed and grow; the units of time (days, months, years)—gods who came into the world according to the order of the calendar—that pene trated all worldly beings, transforming and aging them; the deities that con stantly possessed individuals and that could be either sources of inspiratio nion or else pathogenic, or those residing in hallucinogenic sub stances; those linked to the powers that rulers acquired during initiation rites, etc. 23 All this—i.e. a body composed of both heavy matter and an inner spir itual self—made humans extraordinarily heteroge neous beings. They were shaped by the dynamic re lationship between several divine entities that formed part of them either temporarily or per manently. Their various constitu ent wills would converse, play or fight with one another inside each person. The individual was a changeable, complex being in a precarious state of equilibrium who had to control and harmonize his or her components.

Breath was a manifestation of one's vital force, and one's exhalation could exert either a good or bad influ ence, depending on the person's emo tional state. S3 It seems the function of the digestive organs was not alto gether clear, though their fluids were thought to intercommunicate freely. Food entered a receptacle that puri fied it thanks to heat emitted by the spleen—this is how useful substances were separated from the impurities forming excrement. Today many still believe that if the gallbladder becomes overfull and bile spills out, the organ ism is poisoned and the blood begins to overheat. 23 The main centers of thought were the heart, head and liver; working in harmony, they allowed one to reason correctly. The heart regu lated the other centers' functions. The main organs of perception were locat ed in the head, and understanding was attributed to one of these—the ear. The liver produced joy, hunger, cowardice, courage, anger, hate, desire, avarice, pleasure and if it was unified, it pro duced good feelings and positive pas sions. 23 It was thought that the com bination of two fluids—the father's and the mother's—was needed for procre ation. The paternal fluid was consid ered necessary not only for conception, but for feeding the fetus in its initial period of formation. The male and fe male reproductive systems each had very significant specific names: female organs were called "mother" or "doll," and male organs "bird" or "priest" or "servant." The kidneys were also con sidered part of the reproductive system. Balance and Imbalance Mesoamericans equated health with balance, and often referred to harmony in terms of the paired opposites heat and cold. The heat-cold dyad had more to do with the nature of things than with their temperature. The human body underwent a natural process of change as it aged, from the cold, damp state of the newborn to the heat and dryness of the elderly—a consequence of the accumulation of the fire of time in the heart. At the age of fifty-two (one cen tury: a quantity derived from the com bination of the sacred numbers thir teen and four], one acquired the hon orable condition of elderliness. Given the respective qualities of heat and cold, children and old people alike had to be careful not to allow their condi tion to become exaggerated: children were at risk in cold environments while elders were harmed by heat and were thus permitted to cool themselves with pulque, the alcoholic beverage ob tained from fermented maguey juice. Imbalances, moreover, were constant: physiological changes caused by men struation, pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal syndrome; as well as exces sive physical exertion, ingesting the wrong kinds of food, nighttime expo sure, carrying out public duties or be ing near sacred places. It goes without saying that sinful thoughts, uncon trolled moods or antisocial actions also seriously unbalanced people, putting not only the transgressor, sinful thinker or uncontrolled person at risk but also those who happened to be near him or her during the crisis. 23 Many of the thoughts and actions that were consid ered immoral were of a sexual nature. However, sex itself was seen as one of the great divine gifts, thanks to which human beings could stand the suffer ing characteristic of life on earth. It should be made clear that all of these gifts were supposed to be enjoyed in moderation. 23 The Mesoamerican concept of imbalance linked morality, health and divine judgment. One did not wait until the next world to receive one's just rewards or punishment; they were meted out in this life, and very often in the form of health or illness. However, the association between mo rality and one's physical state occasion ally led to equating sinners with the unwary and those who were the vic tims of circumstance or of some divine or human aggression. The threefold source of imbalance implied a plural procedure of healing where the doctor was at once confessor, moral and reli gious counselor, caretaker, dispenser of medicine, conjurer and one offering prayer. Obviously, an important aspect of Mesoamerican medicine dealt with prescribing foods and medicines of a contrary nature—in terms of heat or cold—to the sick person's illness. Death Sent by the Gods, Death Devoted to the Gods Human beings were great debtors. Their creditors were the gods, and above all the Mother Goddess of the earth. Humans fed off her fruit; their excre tions fell on the face of Mother Earth. This debt they paid with their lives, 23 The Nahuas believed that death was the definitive disintegration and disper sion of an individual's components. The main element—the one residing in the heart—traveled to the other world, to the place ruled by the god who had decided the individual's death. Each god had his or her own weapons. If the death was a normal one, the spiritual entity traveled to the depths of the world of the dead; if it was due to an "aquatic" disease, lightning or immer sion in water, it went to the water god's paradise; if one died a glorious death men during war, and women during the birth of their first child—one was trans ported to the daytime sky to accompa ny the sun on its course. In all three otherworldly realms, the spiritual enti ty had to work, helping the gods in their task of keeping the world alive. 23 The long road to the place of the dead gave each individual time in the hereafter to understand the meaning of one's short life. The spiritual entity descended through the underworld's nine levels, undergoing the torments and suffering that would cleanse it and release it from its bonds to life on earth. When it reached the last level after four years of travel, the entity lost any remaining shred of individuality. Like the corn plant's "heart," like the "hearts" of all living creatures, the human being's "heart" went to the great underground storehouse after being cleansed of its history. The clean "heart" was elevated again to the highest heaven, and there the gods recycled it by creating anoth er human being. 23 Human beings died by the will of the gods in order to pay their debt and continue their species. But one could also die for the gods. One of the most ancient rituals in Me soamerica—practiced with greater intensity during periods of military ex pansionism—was human sacrifice. With ritual murder, man helped the world to continue existing. Not all forms of ritual murder had the same meaning. One of them was a veritable form of payment, giving blood and hearts to the gods in exchange for wa ter, health, life, crops and an enduring world. Another was the use of the hu 83</page><page sequence="12">man body as a vessel for gods who had to end their own Life cycles. In this sec ond form of ritual murder, victims were considered living images of the gods: they were dressed like the latter and singled out for a ritual that celebrated the sacrifice to which the gods them selves had been subjected in the last period of mythical time. 23 The body— the complex and changeable totality of a human being—acquired its full meaning by experiencing pleasure and suffering, rewards and punishment in a world that was the temporal arena of the gods. Immersed in the whirl wind cycle of life and death, the body warmed its face in the sun, talked with its kindred creatures, ate, drank, en joyed sexual pleasure and reproduc tion, breathed in the earth's scents—a god-creature among a multitude of god-creatures that filled the world. 23 Translated by Richard Moszka Cosmos of Skin Sexual Energy and its Dangers Christian Duverger What could be more useless than our games of love when divested of all demographic purpose? For the Aztecs, all that count ed was procreation, which was sup posed to increase population. 23 Civil law severely punished all sexual licen tiousness. In ancient Mexico, adultery in particular was punishable with death by stoning. In a number of codices such as the Mendoza and the Telleria no Remensis—we find images of cou ples whose heads have been crushed with stones, apparently because they were caught in flagrant disobedience of the laws on carnal relations. The first order emitted by Nezahualcóyotl, king of Tezcoco—a city allied with Te nochtitlan at the heart of the Triple Al liance—established the sentence of hanging for persons convicted of infi delity, according to Alba Ixtlilxóchitl's account. 23 In practice, things were probably a lot more flexible. For exam ple, while Aztec men never had more than one "official" wife, they could eas ily live with a number of concubines. In t reality, there was a compromise be tween the northern tradition of abso lute monogamy and the customs of the sedentary tribes of the Valley of Mexico, who had practiced polygamy before the arrival of the Nahuas. In the latter case, the marriage ritual could not be held more than once, but the husband could receive other second ary wives in his home, and their status was not in the least ambiguous. 23 At any rate, licentiousness was officially condemned. Speeches invariably at tacked the sexual disorder metaphori cally referred to as in teuhtli, in tlazolli, "the dust, the filth." According to the Florentine Codex, a father gave his son the following advice: "In your youth, shun all carnal delights. Corruption will ruin you, destroy you, kill you.... Wait until you are mature to experience the carnal life. Avoid impetuous behav ior that will use you up. Because you are like a maguey plant: if it is opened too soon, it will quickly stop producing sap and die. That is how you are con sumed by the act of love." 23 Here we come face to face with the uniquely Aztec conception of energy as some thing in limited supply. Sexual energy is like capital: once squandered, the holder is left ruined and impotent. As such, it is best to save up, to hoard that treasure that is only given once, and to reserve any expenditures for marriage, when they will have some social use and, as such, bear fruit. 23 At least, that is the philosophy, as the commu nity ideal that the "planners" in power had been seeking since the fifteenth century came into conflict with ancient erotic traditions on that very point. For instance, before the Náhuatl invasion, autochthonous peoples of the Valley of Mexico held orgiastic parties that the Aztecs would have had a hard time accepting. They made great efforts in toning down such cultural practices which, as prisoners of their zeal for codification, would soon become mere relics. But could the new strict regime wipe out all traces of an ancient tra dition? 23 The Aztecs were likewise in fluenced—under conditions that remain otherwise unclear—by the Huastec and Totonac populations. These tribes from the torrid zones of the Mexican Gulf Coast were widely known for their sex ual tendencies. The men went naked, without loincloths. The women wore sumptuous clothes woven from bright ly colored cotton. They also used make up and tattoos, and cultivated their body's beauty. Something very unusual in Mesoamerica was the fact that they observed a cult to the phallus. And the main female deity was not the moth er-goddess but the goddess of sexual pleasure. In Aztec times in Mexico, Tlazoltéotl, "goddess of filth"—that is, physical pleasure—earned full right to citizenship; the important ceremonies of the month of Ochpaniztli were dedi cated to her. Tlazoltéotl's growing suc cess and her "admission" into the six teenth-century pantheon were, it seems, indications of a rift between decreed principles of sexual ethics and actual practice. 23 But conversely, Aztec soci ety always tolerated prostitutes and procurers, and accepted fairly licen tious behavior among young warriors. Young men educated in the telpochcal li, or military colleges, would often take ahuianime or "women of pleasure" as their companions. At night, these women would sing and dance with the soldiers in the intimacy of the "house of song." But they also occupied an important place in official ceremonies: at the huey tecuiuluitl feast, the "great feast of the lords," they would dance, their hair hanging loose, with military officers, sons of dignitaries and the bravest soldiers. Evidently, not even the emperor would refuse to take part in one of these dances. 23 In reality, the reasoning behind this celebration reveals the limits on the integration of sexual freedom. Clearly, the ahuianime participated in dances that were quite ambiguous. In this society, the image of loose hair falling over a woman's shoulders was taken to be an erotic symbol—there is no mistaking it for anything else. As for the dancers' ges tures, they are also not exempt from a certain lasciviousness. As the Florentine Codex relates, "they were lined up, and thus they danced one against the other, hip to hip." So it appears that warriors were permitted a bit of a romp in pleasant company. But far from being an invitation to general li centiousness. these stimulating danc es actually constituted a test, an exer cise in self-control. Because it was for bidden to succumb to such feminine wiles! Any kind of familiarity was mo tive for corporal punishment, and if a young soldier was aroused to euphoria 84 man body as a vessel for gods who had to end their own Life cycles.

True, the golden rule of Aztec civilization con sisted of systematically integrating al logenic cultural components, as well as practices typical to caste systems and corporations. £5 But recovery, whether through myth or ritual, had its limits, and if I have dwelled on the topic of sexual morality, it is only be cause social risk is very important in these circumstances: the useless ex penditure involved in the dissolution of customs, licentiousness or homosexu ality, was experienced as a wound, as a dangerous "energorrhage" or a factor in the weakening of the social fabric. 23 Let us summarize the Aztec ethical vision in a few words: immorality is a game, because in the final analysis, playful activities are the very essence of entropic behavior. A game is a game, and it is played above all for the sake of playing it. How did Mexicans cease to see games purely as an occasion for expenditure, gratuitous waste, an activ ity done in vain, even when disguised as the voluptuous vertigo of games of chance? Undoubtedly, the idea of the game inspired fear among Aztec lead ers. Only they knew that it is largely transgression that creates the condi tions for games, and that, in any case, prohibition only adds to the intensity of their enjoyment. So, instead of resort ing to traditional repressive measures, they used an indirect weapon—that of moral prohibition—to defend society against the dangers represented by gaming, in their view. 23 Translated by Michelle Suderman.

There are veins, marrow, bones, hands, genitals, torso, feet, hair. It has no clothing, nor tools, nor weapons, nor altars. There are no rituals and no ceremonies: other bodies like this one, when they cease palpitating, are simply abandoned on the inclement earth's surface. 23 It is still not even possible to say what will be said several millennia later about the seven consistencies of the first man, of Adam Kadmon, the original man made of red clay: "One, his flesh from the earth; two, his blood from the dew; three, his eyes from the sun; four, his bones from stone; five, his intelligence from the swiftness of the angels and from cloud; six, his veins and his hair from the grass of the earth; seven, his soul from my [i.e. God's] breath and from the wind" [The Book of the Secrets of Enoch). 2p Through the mists of time, however, that figure becomes laboriously clear er, not entirely undifferentiated from the rough rocky landscape and the brushwood that surrounds it, threat ening: the figure of a human body; a naked body, helpless, exposed to the thorns and mutations of the elements. 23 It is of no matter if it is a man or a woman, if it is the body of an infant, a child, or if it is mature or elderly; all that matters is that it is alive.

There are veins, marrow, bones, hands, genitals, torso, feet, hair. It has no clothing, nor tools, nor weapons, nor altars. There are no rituals and no ceremonies: other bodies like this one, when they cease palpitating, are simply abandoned on the inclement earth's surface. 23 It is still not even possible to say what will be said several millennia later about the seven consistencies of the first man, of Adam Kadmon. the original man made of red clay: "One. his flesh from the earth; two, his blood from the dew; three, his eyes from the sun; four, his bones from stone; five, his intelligence from the swiftness of the angels and from cloud; six, his veins and his hair from the grass of the earth; seven, his soul from my [i.e. God's] breath and from the wind" [The Book of the Secrets of Enoch). 23 Through the mists of time, however, that figure becomes laboriously clear er, not entirely undifferentiated from the rough rocky landscape and the brushwood that surrounds it, threat ening: the figure of a human body; a naked body, helpless, exposed to the thorns and mutations of the elements. 23 It is of no matter if it is a man or a woman, if it is the body of an infant, a child, or if it is mature or elderly; all that matters is that it is alive. The bilat eral symmetry that defines its internal and external structures is barely af fected by the activity of its heart, locat ed on the left side, or by the other or gans, invisible and bubbling. 23 The body is standing still, legs slightly apart and arms hanging tensely, in an alert posture. The dark eyes are open and within the thick-lipped mouth shines the uneasy wetness of saliva. The fog forms drops that fall on the skin insis tently, rhythmically. 23 Nor does it matter if this simple scene—this stat ic condition—takes place by day or by night. But it does perhaps matter that the ground's firmness stands in fierce opposition to the ethereal and intangi ble immensity of the arch of heaven, whether dark or luminous. For the body is sensitive to light and dark. Hid ing ominously in the shadows is a vio lent creation that takes the fluid form of a cat seen from the corner of one's eye—a terrible demon whose majesty has not yet been codified.

Theirs are the temples and the altars, the sacrificial niches and the dark chambers. 23 The body's naked ness is transformed into a demon. An Aestheticizing Vision of the Past Before the artistic, instrumental or rit ual representation of human bodies in ancient societies, a visitor to an archae ological museum may assume a num ber of different intellectual postures. For example, he or she might wonder if each of these figures corresponds to a particular type, or if they should be seen as portraits of unique individuals. 23 Such an inquiry will not necessarily produce a meaningful answer, though that does not mean it would be lacking in interest. In any case, this is sympto matic of our behavior when faced with the essential aspect of culture that is art, surrounded on all sides by preju dice. This is an example of the aetheti cization that, based on our own ideas and convictions, we impose on magi cal, ceremonial and utilitarian objects from other eras, when we often know very little about the period. This oper ation consists in attributing objects with a necessarily aesthetic intent, for the delight of the senses and the spir it. 23 Indeed, we tend to admire sacred statuary and ceramics from ancient civilizations and cultures as works in which the desire for beauty and sensi tivity was not only determinative but imperative. But this is not always the case. In fact, it is almost never the case. On the contrary, the things we see and at times touch in those fasci nating treasure troves that the archae ologists have gathered for us. and which—exultant in their secret, cryptic life—await us within the museum walls, express complex visions of the physical world and the spirit world that are far broader and more profound than those which the artistic drive gen erally communicates. 23 These works speak of life and death; social rela tions; nature and its codes that are so arduously deciphered; the omnipres ent heavens and earth; crops and bat tles; demographic phenomena; and economic and commercial transac tions. In a sense, they contain every thing, woven into the significant ma terial of these works, and they express themselves continually, with admirable energy, before our eyes, our senses, our intellect. 23 The mode, manner, style and form in which the totality of things is found in this multiplicity of objects open up the panorama to defi nitions of each culture, each civiliza tion. From an intellectual viewpoint, the best thing is to try and learn how the societies that created and fashioned these objects thought, in terms of a mythical, religious, cosmogonic think ing, of course. 23 An essential aspect of this totality of existence can natu rally be found in the microcosm that is the human body, just as it is described in The Book of the Secrets of Enoch. The human body is similar to a mag netic field or a theater: it summons the forces of the cosmos because they are represented and active in it at one and the same time—acting in all the dynamic senses of the word, the verb to act. The body is an actor, an irre ducible force; it is a testing ground and frequently, the place of apparitions. This is what it is in sacrifice, in sex. in war; this is what it is in the aesthetic representations made of it. 23 What we need is a more diverse perspective. In museums and at archaeological sites, our perception is confined by our aesthetic predisposition, which limits and often impoverishes our full understanding of objects. We need to continually reeducate ourselves in terms of what we call "art of the past." when in fact this art is an invaluable fragment of an authentic cosmovision. 23 Furthermore, it is inevitable that we try to aestheticize these objects. Take for example the visual sense and color with which the ancient Mexicans repre sented life and the afterlife. In the words of Miguel León-Portilla, "To them, the East was the region of light, fertility and life, symbolized by the color white. North was the black sector, where the dead are buried. The West was the house of the sun. the land of women and the color red. And finally, the South was the place of sown fields, associated with the color blue-green". How can anyone remain indifferent and unmoved before this symbolism or allegorism of unde niable poetic and perceptive qualities, with all the complex flood of concomi tances in the artistic expression— whether in ceramics or sculpture—that accompanies it and articulates it in a thousand different ways? The Body in Poetry Systematic, scientific investigations in to the modes of thought and cultural and life achievements of those who lived in what is now Mexican territory com menced a relatively short time ago—in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Hundreds of experts from many different countries participated, including historians, archaeologists, ethnologists, anthropologists and lin guists. To them we owe the discovery and re-evaluation of those distant worlds—findings that have produced surprised reactions among all those who have had some contact with the fruits of everything people did, imag ined, thought and created here so many centuries ago. 23 One of the most im portant branches of this area of study —the close analysis of Náhuatl poetic forms—was initiated in the first half of the twentieth century by a priest, Ángel María Garibay Quintana, and by his il lustrious disciple, Miguel León-Porti lla. These two scholars were respon sible for publishing the best-known anthologies of "flower and song," which was the term ancient Mexicans gave to symbolic or poetic expression in words. Naturally, Garibay's and León-Portillo's research would not have been possible without the work of thousands of anonymous scribes and prior ethno logical investigations realized by six teenth-century evangelizers, including the missionary Bernardino de Saha gún. Through this scholastic labor, an cient Mexico's "forgers of song" (cuica picque) began to have names and biog raphies, or as the Nahuas themselves put it, "faces that had flesh and color." 23 One of those poets was Tlaltecatzin of Cuauhchinanco. productive during the sixteenth century. In León-Porti lla's words in his invaluable anthology. Quince poetas de mundo náhuatl (Fif teen Poets of the Náhuatl World), he was a devoted "balladeer of pleasure, women and death." One of Tlaltecat zin's themes of choice was that of the "merry-makers" or women of pleasure (ahuianime), about whom an anony mous poet composed the following simple verses which we can read in the Codex Matritense: "The merry 87</page><page sequence="16">maker/ with her body gives pleasure,/ she sells her body [...]/ She stands like the flowers [...]/ She turns her eyes away, arching her brow,/ she laughs, she walks away laughing,/ she shows off her many charms 23 The bal ladeer of Cuauhchinanco describes the merry-maker as a "lovely brown corn flower": "Sweet, luscious woman,/ love ly brown corn flower,/ you only lend yourself,/ you will be abandoned,/ you will have to leave,/ you will lose flesh [...]/ On the mat of blue and yellow feathers/ Here you stand 23 As we see here, in the black and red ink of the pictoglyphic books where these verses were recorded, the complex emotions and ideas of a forgotten world remain intact. That world's ma terial remains have been salvaged and preserved thanks to the admirable la bor of many modern archaeologists. 23 Another poet whose work Miguel León-Portilla brought to light was Aqui auhtzin, born in 1430 in Amecameca. This was not far from the birthplace of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, Hieronymite nun and paradigm of baroque poetry in Spanish. (In fact, she was born in the village of Nepantla, a word meaning "in the middle," as it lay between the cen tral Mexico's two great volcanoes: the Popocatépetl and the Iztaccihuatl.) The "forger of song" Aquiauhtzin of Aya panco is the author of an extraordinary work entitled "Song of the Warrior Wo men of Chalco," in honor of the Mexica conqueror Axayácatl. To sing the prais es of this man—son of Moctezuma llhuicamina, the sixth Aztec emperor and father of Moctezuma Xocoyotzin— Aquiauhtzin composed a poem in which he is challenged by the Chalco wars in both a military and a sexual sense: "If you are in truth a man,/ this is where you must make every effort./ Will you not continue, and forcefully?// Do it in my warm vessel,/ then make sure it is well and truly ignited,/ Come and join in, come and join in:/ it is my pleasure [...]// How is the shield im pregnated/ deep in the plain?/ I will of fer myself, offer myself up,/ my little boy, you run away from me [...]// Stir me up like corn dough,/You, my lord, little Axayácatl [...]." 23 The bodies of t the "merry-makers" and the bodies of warrior women are both transparent ly and forcefully present in these ex amples of "flower and song." 23 The contrast between such a view of the body and the one expressed by Europe an Renaissance lyrical poetry is quite clear if we compare these examples of ancient Mexican poetry with a single line from Garcilaso de la Vega, fif teenth-century poet and member of the court of Emperor Charles V. When, in his Third Eclogue, Garcilaso speaks of his own death, he describes his af terlife thus: "my soul freed from its cramped rock," where rock means sim ply "jail" and is used as a metaphor for the body. 23 The black and red of the pictoglyphic books clearly and simply refers to the central ideas of a cosmo gony that is at once terrible and deli cate. These are the colors of gran deur: the English writer G. K. Chester ton once said that "red is the most joyful and dreadful thing in the physi cal universe." Black is easily and trag ically identified with the gloomy, omi nous night, with the depths, with the primordial darkness, with the genetic slime of the uterus. The internal river of human blood bursts like a scarlet sun into the labyrinths of physiology. 23 The colors have faded in most of ancient Mexico's visual testimony, but it only takes a milligram of imagina tion to be able to re-present them—to present them again, by which I mean under a new light—in all their hypnotic and fascinating splendor. A Victorian Aside: John Ruskin's Predicament In 1854, when the Victorian era was in full swing, the marriage celebrated six years prior between John Ruskin, the art critic and historian, and Effie Gray was annulled. Effie Gray confessed to her father that Ruskin "did not make me his Wife," meaning that he had not initiated any sexual contact, or in other words, he had never complied with his conjugal duties. 23 In a declaration that John Ruskin wrote for his attorney, he stipulated the following "It may be thought strange that I could abstain from a woman who to most people was so attractive. But though her face was beautiful, her person was not formed to excite passion. On the contrary, there were certain circumstances in her per son which completely checked it." 23 Researcher Mary Lutyens (Millais and the Ruskins, Young Mrs. Ruskin in Ven ice, as quoted by Janet Malcolm in "Nudes without Desire" in The New York Review of Books, April 11, 2002) offered an explanation of what Ruskin may have meant by that disturbing term "circum stances"—the fact that his wife had pu bic hair—and she goes on to say that on the wedding night, he suffered a trau matic shock on seeing his wife's geni tals , as "nothing had prepared him for that." 23 Ruskin had never seen nude models at art school. The paintings and statues at the galleries and museums he frequented due to the demands of his profession and his intellectual inter ests did not help him to acquire any familiarity with the female body given that in the art world, female nudes did not have hair on any part of their anato my. So on his wedding night, Ruskin concluded that his wife suffered from a strange and disconcerting deformity or some grotesque abnormality. 23 That highly educated Englishman, whose in telligence and sensitivity were admired and respected throughout Europe and much of the world, simply had no idea of the existence of pubic hair on wom en's bodies. His Victorian notions of the female body—of which he had seen countless examples over the years in museums and galleries—had impris oned him in a frightening ignorance of real life. 2&gt; Nudity and sexuality con tinued to be widely demonized in nine teenth-century Europe. Prodigious Sculptors and Ceramicists Did the hands of destiny ignite the fire of my body? Carlos Pelticer, "Esquemas para una oda tropical" During the reign of the Aztec emperor Axayácatl (the latter half of the fif teenth century ad), ancient Mexicans adopted the Tonalámatl calendar. The most striking evidence of this change in the form of measuring time was the immense carved stone known as the Aztec Calendar on which are inscribed the cyclical rhythms of time. The Aztecs were skilled sculptors and clear proof of that are pieces such as the formi dable Coatlicue—Our Lady of the Skirt of Snakes—and the abovementioned Aztec Calendar or Sun Stone (Piedra del Sot) that Axayácatl had ordered made. 23 Alongside the sacred mon 88</page><page sequence="17">umental nature of these objects, Me soamerica also saw a proliferation of works, from toys and musical instru ments to vessels and images of less er or greater deities, that represented human bodies. The Mayan Chac Mool and the Mexica Eagle Warriors figure among the most widely known exam ples of this tendency. But the variety in these representations is astounding. 23 There are some little-known images in stone or clay that exhibit a very direct sexuality: couples having intercourse, female figures blatantly displaying their genitals, phallic sculptures. They come from very different regions, but they are inspired by the same chthonic force. 23 Whether in past societies or tradition al regions of today, fertility has always been associated with the earth. [The medieval poet Gonzalo de Berceo once praised the Virgin Mary as "Queen of the Heavens, mother of wheat bread.") And it was the igneous magma arising from the bowels of the earth that pro vided the material for magical and pro pitiatory fertility images. 23 The earth's fertility accompanies, ensures and pro vokes that of human bodies. As such, it is linked to the continuation and sur vival of the species. This intimate and organic relationship between the sub stratum of chthonic power and human ity's generative force has its ideal vehi cle in the clay and stone that are extract ed from the earth's crust. Stone and clay are the materials used to carve or mold propitiatory images. 23 The seed sown in the fields is reflected, like a mir ror or an echo, in the fertilized implan tation of the semen in the "limbo of the matrix"—which is French writer Michel Tournier's term for the human uterus. The breeding ground is the earthly uterus and this represents the female body's planetary nature, divine or semi divine, but always transcendent. 23 Woman made of earth, woman-earth: goddess of fertility, alcove of fertility, adored icon, sacred body. Modern Devastations Unlike ancient visions of life and death, fertility and sexuality, secularized worldviews constitute a true catalogue of devastations. There are countless examples of this lyric expression of the desolation of the modern world. But there is one that stands out from the rest. One of the most important poems in modern literature—not just in the English language—is entitled The Waste Land, and was published in New York in 1922. Its author, T. S. Eliot (1888-1965), received the Nobel prize for literature in 1948. 23 When writing this poem, Eliot took into account the ancient world, in particular myths about the earth's fertility. It is clear that the Great War (19U-1918) cast its shadow over the work, marking Eliot's verses with blood and grime, the mud of the trenches that, once dry and abandoned, left behind a barren landscape in many regions of Europe. 23 Embellished with aptly chosen quotes from different cul tural and literary traditions, The Waste Land is one of the most stirring testi monies written of the modern secular ized and deconsecrated world where the bodies are statistics of loss, fodder for death without meaning. 23 Few times has Western culture left such bitter testimony to the decline of tradi tional values, of those worlds where the body and the earth were still unit ed with places of propitiatory sacred ness, with their vast wealth of symbols, myths and fertility rituals. The Indians' Genius Not only does the curious gaze of a vis itor at an archaeological exhibition aes theticize what it sees: it also tends to disregard the present, relegating it to oblivion. In this sense, it is a gaze pro foundly colored by forgetfulness, whether deliberate orvoluntary. It admires what has been created and those who creat ed it in those magical, unattainable cen turies, but it rarely takes into account the fact that some form of the same apparently extinct spirituality—the spir ituality of those who formulated those cosmovisions, erected those cities and sculpted those monuments—has sur vived to this day. 23 In Latin America, this phenomenon was influenced by all the nation-building projects that pros pered in the nineteenth century, in par ticular. Indians simply did not have a place in these projects. The indigenous idiosyncrasy and omnipresence were seen as a problem, and had to be treat ed as such, with policies that ranged from forced assimilation to extermina tion, including every possible form of discrimination and subjugation, iniqui tous exploitation and internal coloniza tion. 23 A repulsive expression of this conquering, ethnocidal mindset is the saying, "the only good Indian is a dead Indian." A gentler, more aesthetic ver sion of this way of thinking is, to our shame, our admiration of the pre Columbian treasures when we forget more easily than we would like or would like to admit—that the creative genius of the past still lives among us in a thousand different ways, in Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guatemala and the different regions of Mexico. The artists are still alive and active, despite their subjection and the unjust conditions that have been imposed on them by mod ern "ideals," barely allowing for their survival. 23 Sadly, the flipside of that sanctimonious admiration forthe mag nificent works of the indigenous past is generally racism toward Indians today. 23 And so, we have only to understand the religiosity and mythic nature of ancient cultures in order to properly frame our admiration for all they be queathed us in the form of these in credibly expressive objects. We must also understand that the direct descen dents of those artists and thinkers of pre-Hispanic societies—Mestizos, Cri ollos, Indians—are still among us. They are our contemporaries. 23 In a book entitled La aparición. Ensayo sobre el ser y et aparecer (Apparition: An Essay on Being and Appearing, 1950), the Peruvi an philosopher Mariano Ibérico (1882 1974) wrote the following about stones and Indians: "Just as stones are the dominant note in the Indian's land scape, the image of the stone also con stitutes the main theme of mythic fan tasy. This means that between the Indi an's deeper psychology and the stone there exists a fundamental and un known affinity. And perhaps in this pri mary deification of the stone, in this mystic giving of life to the inanimate, the taciturn Indian can teach us a meta physical lesson: life is universal and omnipresent, and everything is germi nal. Within everything—even in derelict and apparently inert stones—a soul is throbbing and dark powers are sleep ing. The most significant metamorpho ses in indigenous myths consist of men being transformed into stone or stones into men. [...] And that is why, in a sense, the stone is the beginning and end of man. Man is made of stone and is turned to stone through the will of 89</page><page sequence="18">the gods. Clearly, for that reason, the Indian's soul contains a geological con cretion, a relic from the past or the proclamation of future reintegration into primitive matter." 23 Mariano Ibe rico's comments on stones could also be applied to clay and the other geo logical materials that were patiently carved, sculpted and molded into art works by those ancient Indian crafts men who were "taciturn" or impas sioned, joyful or contemplative, or all those at the same time. It could and perhaps should be said in particular of the clay used to make anthropomor phic objects and countless bodily rep resentations. 23 Stone and clay from the dialogue with the divinities, with to tality, with the fluid world, with natu ral phenomena, with their fellow crea tures in the bosom of those societies that were distant yet so very near, so much so that they are here among us and with us in Peru and in Mexico, within the museum walls and in every place in every country where they have escaped extermination. The Body as a Character The characters of a novel are made up of words: their bodies are descriptive phrases. The body of a poem is lan guage itself in a state of extreme fluid ity and tension. Lines, colors, volumes and perspectives form a painting's pro tagonists. The vehicle of dance is bod ily expression. In these pieces, which focus on the human figure, the protag onist, the main character, vehicle and space of art is the human body. 23 From head to foot, from the face and torso to the genitals, presented in part or in whole, and stylized by the craftsman's hands, the body offers itself up to the gaze with its own comprehensive view of the world and of life. We see these objects and they see us at the same time, in a dialogue made of pure inter mediary light, whose points of origin are primarily clay and stone. 23 In their disquieting immobility, solely for the miracle of their being-there, these ex traordinary objects compel us to move around them, to find the angles which will best reveal their uniqueness and splendor. S In this there is a kind of dance: in their hieratism, and with their static presence, the pieces unleash the movement of our observing bodies. A dialogue ensues: we ask them "who are you?" and "how did you live?" And they respond silently. Thus is written this ephemeral novel of two gazes and two voices that communicate across the density of centuries. In the end, the poem is ignited in the emotion of won der: a rock-hardness of millenary per manence, fragile diuturnal and enig matic clay, words sunk into the stone that, at a glance, begins to vibrate be fore our eyes with the strange anima tion imprinted on it by that immateri al contact. 23 Miguel Manriquez is a contemporary Mexican poet whose work "El cuerpo" (The Body, pub lished in El aroma de la tribu, The Tribe's Scent) is an admirably vigorous account of the physiological experi ence: "Sometimes the body is an altar, strung together, that comes apart in the heat/ until it is nothing but ruins, lumps and leaven,/ sometimes the body is crumbled over other bodies/ with the softness of a lamb whose throat has been cut,/ sometimes it arches with the long pulsation of death,/ sometimes it is a handful of ashes that are extinguished with the sound of my footsteps,/ sometimes it is a lake dwelling for itself [...]." 23 The body-character. The silent body that nevertheless engages in dialogue. The body that plays the lead in its silent presence. The body of our fellows from the pre-Hispanic past.... The inert opacity of the centuries becomes bod ily transparence. Mexican Geographies Any foreigner traveling through Mex ico—if he or she is observant and recep tive enough—would be surprised by the country's natural and cultural wealth. Few nations possess the climatic vari ety of this one: a true horn of plenty. And in truth, Mexico is brimming with things to inspire the imagination orthe fancy. All that is required is to open one's eyes and free up the senses in order to revel in the profusion of imag es, sensations, ideas, rituals, celebra tions and ceremonies, some of which date back thousands of years. 23 The Mexican seas, jungles, rivers, deserts, plateaus and plains have a rendezvous with the bodies that inhabited them centuries ago, and they are expressed through those bodies and their forms. There are slaves, priests, gods, lovers, dwarfs, deformed figures; there are seated, contemplative and active bod ies. The pieces form a kind of earthly constellation in which we can make out the dynamisms and meanings of ancient ways of thinking and of life whose abundance and variety are infi nitely surprising. 23 The bodily repre sentations shown here are a map and a treasure. They are the material testi mony of a creative and propitiatory fev er that is unique in the world. Divini ties, all-powerful deities, men, elders, people copulating, laborers, authori ties, merchants, gamblers, people at leisure, all appear here to speak to us with silent eloquence about an age that is practically unknown to modern humanity. 23 As we discover and ad mire these treasures of the pre-His panic world, we feel a need to shout out—as did the French-speaking Car ibbean poet St-John Perse, in one of his better-known compositions, Ana basis— "Ha! all conditions of men in their ways and manners" (in T. S. Eliot's translation). Diorama of Bodies Examples of pre-Columbian art have been gathered from every region of Mexico in this issue. Each and every one of them manifests diverse attitudes toward anatomy, physiology and its functions, organs and skin, viscera and postures, not to mention a few curious and very interesting representations of physical anomalies. This is a ritualistic expression; the multiple meanings of adornments; the objects' economic and social importance; the celebration of pleasure and even the sense of hu mor that is conveyed in so many ways, laughter, pain, contemplation and util itarianism converge in these pieces with a force that Western civilization and culture have not been able to fully understand. 23 The Mayan Chac Mool is one of the most emblematic figures here; it is also one of the best known, even outside of Mexico. This is a seat ed figure from the so-called Early Postclassic period. The name Chac Mool—meaning "red claw"—was cho sen by the archaeologist Le Plongeon in 1875, for one of the first sculptures of this kind to be discovered in the Temple of Jaguars in Chichén Itza, a magnifi cent Mayan city on the Yucatán Penin sula. The Chac Mool figures generally had a vessel of some kind on their bet 90</page><page sequence="19">lies, where propitiatory offerings for the gods were placed. The bent legs and the head turned to one side gave these sculptures a peculiarly attractive dynamism, despite their stony immo bility. S In a sense, the Chac Mool's hieratism is marked by a very human attitude—in fact, all too human, to par aphrase Friedrich Nietzsche. Its justly warranted fame is owed to this poetic combination of transcendental energy and a direct, almost everyday vision of the body, as seen in the figure's pos ture. 23 It is a curious and very signif icant fact that in order to understand the piece—or to see it, one might say— the Italian writer Italo Calvino felt he had to resort to comparing the Chac Mool to something from earliest Med iterranean antiquity. In a magnificent story entitled "Under the Jaguar Sun," Calvino wrote that the Chac Mool is seated "almost Etruscan-style." This traveler and writer had to "Westernize" the piece, to make it enter—even if by force—into his own system of cultural references, in order to describe it to his readers. 23 The Eagle Knight's statue displays an aggressive dynamism in his costume bristling with feathers. In this piece, the eternal desire to fly is combined with the vocation of the cer emonial warrior. The Flowery Wars were the setting for these apparitions and the sacrificial rites that followed their bloody finale. £5 Along with the Eagle Knight's edgily powerful and bel licose presence, a number of musical, domestic, ornamental and sacred ob jects round out the visual concert. 23 These ancient Mexican artworks offer a surprisingly comprehensive record of emotions, activities and ideas. Wittgensteiniana In his implacable analysis of Sir James Frazer's book The Golden Bough, the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein of fers his extraordinarily keen insight into the origins of myth. 23 He begins by discussing the seductive possibility of being able to choose the body one is born with: for example, the body of a tree in the forest may be that of a tall, beautiful tree or a common, run-of the-mill tree. To consider that possi bility leads us to speculate on the tex ture of such prenatal desires: that is where Wittgenstein locates the origin of myth. 23 The philosopher writes that, "The idea that our feelings for our life are comparable to those felt by one of those beings who can choose its place in life is, in my view, the origin of myth or of the belief that before birth, we chose our own body." 23 There is one feeling that comes to life in the origin of myth: our desire would thus be our fate, the inexorability of our prenatal choices. The body of a tree, the body of a man or a woman, the body of a war rior or a priest... or perhaps the body of a jaguar, a stone or a fragile handful of clay. 23 Before they were born, these pieces dictated their wishes to the demiurgic artisans that made them. The Body and the Spirits Our civilization's unfortunate theology emphatically divides body from spirit, as is made clear in Garcilaso de la Vega's poem cited above. The body is formed from unyielding darkness, and the soul is a weightless brilliance cap tive in the prison of physiology. This is the Christian, Platonic or Neoplatonic notion that has been passed down to us. At the end of life, the body perish es and "liberates" the soul, allowing it to escape... but to where? 23 Emperor Adriano, one of the erudite governors of the Roman Empire, composed a celebrated epigram to his own soul [Animula vagula, blandula...) with that very immemorial theme. Throughout Western cultural and artistic history, tens of thousands of poets have ex pressed the same idea with very little variation. However, one of them, the great seventeenth-century Spanish ba roque poet Francisco de Quevedo, en dowed our physical remains with an ultraearthly soul. In his famous son net beginning "Closed, my eyes could be," an enamored spirit lives on in the bones, marrow and veins of a corpse. 23 Pre-Hispanic art presents us with other ideas and conceptions regarding the eternal duality of body and spirit. There are different myths—not the Pla tonic myth, nor that of the resurrection of the body—that lie behind the bod ies represented here. 23 It is up to us to imagine those fables and legends surrounded by bloody suns, the quet zal's gleaming feathers, obsidian dag gers, pyramids and Flowery Wars, the scorched terrain of the Yucatán sa vannah, flowers and song.

They are here among us. with us, for ever breathing life into the pieces. And alongside them, like an equally phys ical watermark, are the living Indians, our brothers and our teachers. But the Indians of the twenty-first century are not museum pieces. Gold and Bone Though they may be few in number, those pieces made of bone or gold are truly stunning. 23 According to the Book of the Secrets of Enoch, bones are made of stone; they are the stone that hold the skeleton together. Stones are within the earth and on it. The hu man body is a microcosm made in the image of the immense exterior world. 23 The sun, high in the enigma that is the sky, shines with a golden light. From the bowels of the earthly magma emerges the glittering material used to manufacture pectorals for digni taries, among other objects. 23 Gold and bone have distinct origins and also differ in the intention of their artistic, religious and ornamental uses. Gold symbolizes the sun's brilliance, while bone represents the terrestrial nature of the body, and resembles volcanic rock. 23 Glittering round coins are minted in the image of the sun. Objects made of bone represent the human and animal microcosm: they are a de piction of the stony multitude. Memory and Forgetting Anyone who has the opportunity to see these pieces will not easily forget them. Mexicans are aware that our vast pro tean geography is brimming with sim ilar objects. This is an incalculable treasure, and the majority of it is buried underground, still hidden in the earth's matrix. 23 For many decades, archae ologists and historians, epigraphists and engineers, linguists and masons, anthropologists and ethnologists have devoted themselves body and soul to discovering and deciphering the im mense heritage left us by ancient Mex ico. Their work has often been carried out under adverse conditions. A lack of understanding, ignorance and historic insensitivity—which daily reach more extreme levels—are their worst enemy. 23 Those of us who have been fortu nate enough to watch these individuals in their ongoing efforts at salvaging and studying such artifacts can attest to their passionate and often visionary spirit. 23 They can sometimes be spot ted with a piece of stone in one hand, gazing at it. trying its weight, with a look of intense concentration and in quisitiveness. To anyone who is not knowledgeable, that piece of stone is hardly important. But in the eyes of the archaeologists, it is evidence—smolder ing, animate, dense with possible meanings—of those worlds that con stantly occupy their thoughts. 25 Dust-covered, overworked, but coura geous, their lives are devoted to cen turies that have long since been extin guished, though not entirely. They toil at the very point where the bodies, minds and cosmogonies of the past meet the present. 23 We must give these individuals due credit for their knowledge and exemplary efforts which have allowed us to preserve a considerable portion of that artistic and religious heritage. 23 They have all worked in memory's favor and against forgetfulness. Therefore, to forget them would be a great injustice and an error, both intellectual and moral. We must remember them as if we could see them there, standing beside the very pieces they have dug up, cleaned, stud ied and begun to comprehend. 23 It has not only been the Mexicans who have taken part in this grand enterprise. Ex perts and scholars have come from all over the world to work alongside our compatriots in the ruins of all those ancient cities. 23 We are indebted to them. To remember them as we admire these works of art is the least we can do to repay that debt. 23 Translated by Michelle Suderman. The Meaning of the Body Felipe Ehrenberg Creators may be called artists, or if desired, artisans—it makes no difference. They were and continue to be those who rifle through the imaginations of their fellows to define the communal dream and return it reciphered in designs, forms, con cepts, couriers who will continue their voyage through our imaginary. Whether it be in churches or in museums, in homes or out of doors, the delivery is never accidental because it is con trolled by ritual and tradition. Tradition is comforting, ritual enfolds, and at times inhibits—why bother denying it? —but there will always be something mysterious about the space in which the creator is suspended, the gap that opens up between the demands and the restrictions [constrictions) of myth, and the wild fearlessness of the cre ative person. This is the opening we call art; it is the space where we can stop a moment to understand, among other mysteries, the meaning of the body. 23 Translated by Michelle Suderman. 92 The Meaning of the Body Felipe Ehrenberg Creators may be called artists, or if desired, artisans—it makes no difference.
