<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANTHROPOLOGICAL NOTES THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, Department of Anthropology, has recently had a party of five investigators at work in the mounds between Tulare Lake and Buena Vista Lake, in the southern San Joaquin Valley. The expedition amplified the results of the Depart- ment's earlier investigators, Philip Mills Jones in 1899 and Nels C. Nelson in 1909, and prosecuted the investigations to a point which warrants the publication of a comprehensive paper on the archaeology of the region. The Department hopes to incorporate in this paper the r~esults of study of several fine private collections in the region in question. The party recently returned from the field was composed of E. W. Gifford, W. Egbert Schenck, Mrs. Schenck, Eugene Golom- shtok, and W. D. Strong. Dr. TRUMAN MICHELSON, ethnologist in the Bureau of American Ethnology and Professor of Ethnology at George Washington Uni- versity, has been appointed as Instructor in Anthropology at Colum- bia University for the summer session of 1924. MR. OWEN CATTELL assisted by Mr. Donald A. Cadzow of the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation, and by Lor- enzo Chaves, a Zufii Indian, took motion pictures of some of the Zufii ceremonies. All the important arts and industries as well as some ceremonies are illustrated. AMERICAN SCHOOL OF PREHISTORIC RESEARCH IN EUROPE Under the joint auspices of the Archaeological Institute of America and the American Anthropological Association the School of Prehistoric Research was founded in 1920. Students of both sexes are admitted from both North and South America; enrollment may be for the summer term, or for the entire year. There is no tuition fee. The work of the summer term consists of excavations sufficient to give the students first-hand knowledge of methods and culture sequence; excursions to the most important Paleolithic, Neolithic, Bronze, and Iron-Age sites; the study of Museum collections; and lectures given not only by the Director of the School, but also (at vari- ous places) by distinguished European anthropologists. After consultation with the Director, students may choose for the winter term the center of learning which may offer them the best 131</page><page sequence="2">132 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 26, 1924 facilities for the working out of the problems, in which they are in- terested. The fourth year will open on July 1st, '1924. Applications for admission to the School should be sent to the Chairman of the Govern- ing Board, Dr. George Grant MacCurdy, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut. FIELD MUSEUM LEAFLETS In the beginning of 1922 the Field Museum of Natural History inaugurated a new series of publications known as Leaflets. This is a popular series in distinction from the scientific series of publications in which new material or new results are made known in the interest of science, and makes a direct appeal to the general public. The leaflets are intended to distribute accurate knowledge with reference to the Museum collections, and are illustrated by photogravures. The Department of Anthropology has so far issued twelve such leaflets. A series of four deals with the religious life of the North Ameri- can Indians, and contains an account of the religious beliefs and prin- cipal ceremonies of the Pawnee. It will correct many current popular errors in regard to the religious notions of the Indians. The first (No. 5 of the series) contains a description of the Pawnee pantheon and of the ceremony of welcome to the returning gods which was per- formed when the first thunder was heard in the spring. The second (No. 6 of the series) describes the sacrifice of a captive maiden to the Morning Star and explains the beliefs responsible for this cruel prac- tice. The third (No. 7 of the series) gives an account of the important ceremonies by which the tribe was purified, and the fourth (No. 8 of the series) describes the spectacular rites by which the medicine-men of the tribe renewed their powers and initiated new members into their order. Two leaflets have been published illustrating material in the Joseph N. Field Hall; one on New Guinea masks, the other on the use of sago in New Guinea. The former describes briefly some of the more common types of masks, many of which are on exhibition in the hall. Probably the most striking masks used anywhere in the island are the tall feather masks occupying the case in the center of the hall. As many villages in the low part of the island depend on the sago palm, their principal food supply, an account of its preparation and methods of cooking and serving gives some idea of the simple life of</page><page sequence="3">ANTHROPOLOGICAL NOTES 133 these native peoples. Both leaflets are illustrated by photographs showing the natives actually using the various objects described. Three leaflets are devoted to the culture of Japan. The first of these (No. 3 of the series) is a general description illustrated by 6 plates of the Japanese collections installed in Gunsaulu's Hall, and including prints, sword mounts, armor,. costumes, wood-carvings, paintings, and tapestry. The two others (Nos. 11-12 of the series) have reference to four exhibitions of color prints known as surimono, each of which is on view for three months during the year. These prints illustrate various phases of Japanese life and thought. The New Year's festival described in detail in Leaflet No. 11 is one of the most interesting celebrations in the yearly calendar. No. 12 con- tains a full account of the costumes worn by peasants, civilians, and nobles. Each of these is illustrated by four plates. Two other leaflets of this series dealing with Gods and Heroes and Temples and Houses are soon to come out. A Chinese monumental gateway exhibited in Stanley field Hall is figured and described in the first number, while No. 2 gives a brief account of a Phillippine Forge Group. Use of Human Skulls and Bones in Tibet (No. 10) is written with reference to a unique cere- monial bone apron from Tibet composed of 41 plaques carved from human femora and elaborately decorated with figures and designs. The essay gives a great deal of information on the sacred use of hu- man skulls in ancient and modern times and in all parts of the world. The Department has also issued the first part of its Guide which gives a description of the new Hall of Oriental Theatricals containing exhibits from China, Tibet, Java, and Ceylon. AN ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF SOCIAL SCIENCE At the recent meeting of American social science associations, held in Washington, a project for the publication of an encyclopedia of the social sciences was offered for consideration. The Sociological Society appointed a committee to confer with representatives of other groups. The Economic Association approved discussion of the enterprise will presently announce its conferees. The Political Science Association will act upon the proposition, through its Council, at their first meeting. Members of other bodies have ex- pressed their interest in promoting such cooperation. It is significant that scholars in various branches of social science feel the need of an authoritative summary of results in related fields.</page><page sequence="4">134 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST IN. s., 26, 1924 It is timely that social investigators undertake an inventory of their collective work when the world is asking for proven material with which to build sound economy and government. It is encouraging that social engineers perceive the necessity of defining more accurately their several problems. This gesture may stimulate greater prog- ress in the science of society, as the French Encyclop die, by con- solidating the best information of its day, turned men's thought to more careful study of the world of nature. The social sciences have outgrown the stage of schools of philosophy. They are now ready to begin organizing many scattering items of knowledge into a cogent body of principles. The general plan suggested contemplates bringing together with- in the compass of a few volumes an analysis of the more important aspects of social life. This would probably include in part findings from adjacent fields of anthropology, history, sociology, economics and politics, comparative philology and aesthetics, religion, law and ethics. An example of even wider coordination is presented by the Encyclop5die Scientifique, now being published with the aid of the principal learned bodies in France. Whether or not the American work contemplated shall take the form of a dictionary of terms, a sequence of general articles, or a condensed series of outlines remains to be decided, In any event, it is agreed that each section shall pre- sent within the space allowed, the most thorough treatment available. Details of scope and method must obviously be placed in the hands of responsible editors. To develop the scheme indicated, it is proposed that learned societies dealing with human relations each appoint a commit'tee of three to collect and compare the opinions of their co-workers con- cerning the project. These committees can then exchange notes through a joint secretary. By May first a combined committee should be organized to consider general aspects of the work, such as scope and method, finance and editorial management. A conference of the whole committee during the summer may be arranged later. Re- sults of such deliberation should be ready by next October to be put into the form of definite recommendations for discussion at the Holi- day meeting of the constituent societies. If endorsed or modified at that time, the project will be ready for active promotion under com- petent direction. Meanwhile, to bring this matter to the attention of American</page><page sequence="5">ANTHROPOLOGICAL NOTES 135 students of the social sciences, and to obtain their prompt response, the following proposals are offered: 1. That every society interested print a copy of this notice in the next issue of its official journal. 2. That all executive officers of these societies be and are hereby urged to secure immediate appointment of three representatives from their body, whose names and addresses should be forwarded at once to the undersigned. 3. That these committees proceed forthwith to obtain from members of their societies expressions of opinion upon four points, viz.: a. Is an encyclopedia of the social sciences desired? b. Suggestions concerning general scope and method of such work- subject matter, treatment and form. c. Plans for financing the undertaking. d. Names of competent persons for i. Advisory Board ii. Editorial Staff iii. Contributors of special articles. Pending organization of the joint committee to handle corre- spondence, communications and inquiries may be addressed to the undersigned: HOWARD WOOLSTON, University of Washington, Seattle, Wash. WM. F. OGBURN, Columbia University, New York City. ALEXANDER GOLDENWEISER, New School for Social Research, New York, N. Y. Members of the Sociological Society are urged to assist their committeemen by sending suggestions at once to one of the above. RUSSIAN ANTHROPOLOGISTS Since 1914 the constant succession of the Great War, revolution, and recent famine has undermined all branches of science in Russia. Anthropology has suffered the loss of four of her students. F. K. VOLKOV, Professor of Anthropology at Petrograd Univer- sity; President of the Anthropological Society and Curator of the Ethnological section of the Russian Museum of Alexander III, died in July, 1918 A. D. ELKIND, Editor of the Russian Anthropological Journal and Secretary of the Society of Natural History, Anthropology, and Ethnography in Moscow, died in November, 1920.</page><page sequence="6">136 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 26, 1924 N. A. YANSIK, Russian ethnologist, died in December, 1921. DIMITRII NICOLAIVITCH ANUCHIN, Russian anthropologist, died in the summer of 1923. He was born in Petrograd on August 27, 1843. His career began as a student of history at the University of Petrograd in 1860, but owing to illness he was compelled to discon- tinue his studies and go abroad. Three years later he resumed work at Moscow University, this time specializing in zoology. In 1867 he graduated and in 1873 obtained his Master's degree in zoology. Though he had been interested during this time in anthropology, his real work in this field did not commence until 1875, when, under the direction of A. P. Bogdanov, he published his work on the physical anthropology of the Ainu. A year later he was sent by Moscow University to England, France, Germany, and Italy, where he studied museum collections and anthropology. In 1880, Anuchin became the first professor of physical anthro- pology at Moscow University, and lecturer on archaeology at the Moscow Archaeological Institute. He also served as President of the Society of Natural History, Anthropology, and Ethnography, and was a Fellow of the Academy of Science. Several foreign universities made him Doctor honoris causa. Dr. Anuchin is the author of numerous scientific works in zoology, anthropology, and archaeology, the most important of which are the following: Anthropomorphic Apes and Lower Races of Humanity. Ethnology of the Balkan Peninsula. Notes on the Ethnology of Siberia. Paleolithic Age in Russia. Dr. Anuchin was not only a scholar of the first rank in Russia; he is also known as the father of modern anthropology in that country, occupying a position comparable to that of Boas in America. His work as a professor, lecturer, field-worker, and adviser in practically all investigations makes him a prominent figure in the anthropology not only of Russia but of the world. EUGENE A. GOLOMSHTOK ANTHROPOLOGY AT TIHE TORONTO MEETING OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE, AUGUST, 1924 The ninety-second meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science it to be held at Toronto, Ont., from August</page><page sequence="7">ANTHRIIOPOLOGICAL NOTES 137 6th to 13th, 1924. The University of Toronto is in charge of the local arrangements. A number of distinguished British anthropolo- gists have signified their intention to be present at the meeting of Section H (Anthropology) and it is hoped that many American and Canadian anthropologists will be able to attend as well. One of the interesting features of the program will be a discussion on "Mental Character and Race," in which the psychologists will participate. There will probably also be a discussion on cultural diffusion, intro- duced by Prof. Elliot Smith. Those wishing to take part in the proceedings may do so on a payment of $7.50, made before or at the Annual Meeting; such members are also entitled to receive the Report of the Meeting. Those wishing either to attend the meeting without receiving the Report or to receive the Report without attending the meeting will be required to pay a fee of $5.00. For information relative to the meeting of the Association, inquiries should be addressed to Major John Mood, Local Secretary, B.A.A.S., Physics Building, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ont.; on matters referring specifically to Section H, information may be obtained from Dr. E. Sapir, Local Secretary of Section H, B.A.A.S., Victoria Memorial Museum, Ottawa, Ont.</page></plain_text>
