<plain_text><page sequence="1">Interpreting 'Institutions' in Veblen's Evolutionary Theory By FRANK J. WEED * ABSTRACT. The form and basic properties of Thorstein Veblen's evolutionary theory are analyzed as an interpretative strategy for understanding the social institutions of modern industrial society. By formulating hypothetical historical reconstructions based on his prin- ciples of social action and institutional transformation, Veblen creates an heuristic construction that serves as a formula for observation and analysis of what he finds to be the essential meaning of existing be- havior. This gives to his work a critical style, but also a depth of analysis that has a degree of predictive validity. THE FORMULATION of theories of social institutions have often em- ployed some sort of heuristic device that plays the role in the theory of pointing, by analytic comparison, to the underlying properties of social change. These heuristic devices represent abstract analytic de- scriptions where certain processes or principles of social relations can be represented in an unambiguous way. Some of the best known of these devices are the ideal type and the cybernetic model. The purpose of these devices is not so much to account for the relationships found in a particular body of data, but rather to provide us with analogies and metaphors which serve as a framework for comparative description and analysis. Thorstein Veblen uses one of these formulations, the hypothetical historical reconstruction, in his evolutionary theory. Veblen's formulation is evolutionary, and takes the form of genetic principles which show a cumulative development of society from some appropriate zero-point in time (1). As one might guess, the most problematic point in the construction of evolutionary theories lies in and around the formulation of that zero-point. The reconstruction of history at this zero-point for Veblen was his discussion of the charac- teristics of the 'savage' state of man. The 'savage' state serves the role of a hypothetical reconstruction or model which contains Veblen's basic methodological assumptions about social action and society at some natural "pure" stage. About this stage, Veblen attempts to make statements that fit some of the facts known in his time about primitive * [Frank J.

Veblen's purpose is not to study the 'savage' state of man, but to study modern man; therefore, as he moves closer to the present in his analysis, he demonstrates, by comparative expla- nation of successive stages in development, how the modern society emerged into its present distinctive state. At the same time he relies more and more on historical facts to support his analysis as he moves closer and closer to the present. Some of the confusion about Veblen's analysis seems to stem from a misunderstanding of the purpose and application of his method of analysis. One might well find Veblen's presentation of a hypothetical reconstruction of history to be both "bad" anthropology and "bad" history as critics like Lev E. Dobriansky do (3). This is to impose an inappropriate test of factual validity on them because they serve the role of a framework for the description of underlying institutional process and do not serve as factual descriptions. It will be my con- cern here to clarify how the method of hypothetical historical recon- struction is used by Veblen as an interpretative strategy. I THEORY OF ACTION AND 'INSTITUTIONS' VEBLEN'S CONCEPTION of social action can be traced from his earliest published work, "Kant's Critique of Judgment" (1884), which laid down many of the assumptions basic to his later work. His concern here and throughout his work is with a fundamental problem of agency: The action of the person must be capable of falling in with the line of activity of the causes among which it comes; otherwise, it will act blindly and to no purpose. The agent must know what will be the effect of this or that action, if his activity is not to be nugatory, or worse than nugatory. And, in order to [have] such a knowledge of the results of a contemplated action, the knowledge furnished by sim- ple experience is not sufficient. Simple experience . . . cannot forecast the future. Experience can, at the best, give what is or what has been, but cannot say what is to be (4). Man, according to this view, must act in a purposeful manner but at the same time cannot act with certainty on the basis of experience. Man desires a sense of certainty about the outcome of his actions so by using preconceived sets of concepts about the outcome of social action he subjectively feels that he acts with certainty. Veblen argues that it is on the basis of reflective judgment (or inductive reasoning)</page><page sequence="3">Evolutionary Theory 69 that man finds unity in multiplicity, and the act of reflective judgment produces a synthetic synthesis which reaches beyond, and includes more than, what is given in simple experience. In short, man constructs mental "theories" of reality which are adapted to his situation and give his experience order and form. To Veblen man is "dissatisfied with a conception of reality which makes it only a congeries of things, without connection, system, or order beyond juxtaposition in space and succession and duration in time,' (5). It is for man's mind to give order and "causation" to objective realities which then allow him to act in a purposeful manner. These mental constructions are not without influence from experience, how- ever, because at best they are guesses and always will be guesses about the given data. Man's mind then leaves it to experience to credit or discredit his guesses. Veblen incorporates this quasi-Kantian epistemology into his at- tempt to deal with many of the questions raised by Spencer, Marx, and Edward Bellamy. In 1898 Veblen makes a major statement on his methodolgy in an essay entitled "Why Is Economics Not an Evo- lutionary Science." He begins his discussion with a critique of existing schools of economic thought before presenting his process analysis based on generic psychology. Human nature, for Veblen, is based on the characteristic of man to do something, for man is a "coherent structure of propensities and habits which seek realization and expression in an unfolding activity" (6). The structure of propensities refers to "ultimate and definitive" heredi- tary traits (instincts), whereas the habits refer to an individual's "past experience, cumulatively wrought out under a given body of traditions, conventionalities, and material circumstances . . ." (7). The "habits" are the individual's "theory," his super-empirical "synthetic synthesis." The entire process of social action is seen as the interaction between man's natural proclivities in the form of instincts, and the role of institutions in the form of habits which may represent the expression of these proclivities or thwart them. Social action is teleological, in the sense that man always seeks to do something. Veblen's psychology, therefore, contains two "structural" elements, instincts and habits, and a "problem" created by the end-seeking or instinct satisfying actions of men who act in terms of a set of "habits of mind." XWhat gives Veblen his amazing durability as a social theo- rist is his handling of the question: What does man seek? He eschews</page><page sequence="4">70 American Journal of Economics and Sociology formal or a priori answers to this question. "What, in specific detail, they seek, is not to be answered except by a scrutiny of the details of their activity" (8). This suggests that the common error of previous social scientsits was to impose normative concepts like causation, he- donistic formulations, or natural law, on what man may or may not seek. II 'INSTINCTS,' 'HABITS OF MIND' AND 'INSTITUTIONS' WHAT MAN SEEKS is influenced by the kind of knowledge presented in his institutions (9). There are, for Veblen, two forms of knowledge emerging out of man's cultural evolution which are shaped by and continue to shape the dominant thought patterns of society. The first and earliest primitive form of knowledge has an anthropomorphic or animistic quality. To Veblen, primitive man ". . . stands in imme- diate personal contact with the material facts of the environment; and the force and discretion of the individual in shaping the facts of the environment count obviously, and to all appearances solely, in working out the conditions of life. There is little of impersonal or mechanical sequences visible to primitive men in their everyday life . . . " (10). Man is an active agent in his environment and by experience comes to see other natural events as occurring because of some personal or like-human forces. "The inscrutable movements of the seasons and of the natural forces are apprehended as actions guided by discretion, will power, or propensity looking to an end, as much as human actions are" (11). Animistic knowledge is not simply a case of psychological projection of human motives onto natural processes; it is also a form of knowl- edge that is only understandable in the context of a particular form of society. The habits of thought that rule in the working-out of a system of knowledge are such as are fostered by the more impressive affairs of life, by the institutional structure under which the [small] community lives. So long as the ruling institutions are those of blood relationship, descent, and clannish discrimination, so long the canons of knowledge are of the same complexion (12). Man interprets his experience of natural phenomena and social or- ganization in terms of animistic concepts so that his knowledge about the world appears to him as an extension of his own human nature. The second form of knowledge Veblen calls "matter-of-fact" knowl-</page><page sequence="5">Evolutionary Theory 71 edge or impersonal knowledge and is the knowledge of science and technology. This form of knowledge comes about when "social life forces upon men's attention the ruthless impersonal sweep of events that no man can withstand or deflect, such as becomes visible in the complex and comprehensive life process of the large community of a later day" (13). Thus, the rise of civilization has ushered in more and more impersonal elements into man's thoughts and this becomes an historical force in changing man's way of life even further from the "archaic" pattern. Veblen argues his case carefully on this point: As time goes on and as the situation departs from this archaic charac- ter-where it does depart from it-the circumstances which condition man's systematization of facts changes in such a way as to throw the impersonal character of the sequence of events more and more into the foreground. The penalties for failure to apprehend facts in dispas- sionate terms fall surer and swifter. The sweep of events is forced home more consistently on men's minds (14). This evolutionary process is what is shaping the institutions of the modern world although- the process is far from complete. Veblen's comparison of science and technology is revealing on this point, for what science and technology have in common is not their goals but rather the impersonal canons of validity which become "habits of thought imposed on man by the scheme of life current in the com- munity in which he lives" (15). Some analysts of Veblen's work have interpreted the role of tech- nology or the "machine process" as allowing man to know reality more accurately and be more objective about his economic actions, thereby disregarding animistic concepts of the world. With this interpretation Veblen becomes a technological determinist in his evolutionary theory. This interpretation reflects a misplaced emphasis. As Stanley Daugert states, "It appears that the question turns rather on man's response to what he can see are the products of the machine. It is from these in their marvelous abundance that man (and Veblen) came to appre- ciate technology and the machine, that he is profoundly influenced by its working processes" (16). Veblen seems to remain consistent with the early Kantian influence on his thought by focusing his concern on man's response to technology, not technology itself. The basic elements of Veblen's social theory are "instincts," "habits of mind" and institutions. In many places Veblen spends considerable time discussing instincts like the "instinct of workmanship" or "idle curiosity." As in many other concepts, Veblen uses other terms for</page><page sequence="6">72 American Journal of Economics and Sociology instincts such as tempers, bents, propensities, proclivities, drives, or tendencies (17). This collective terminology has plagued readers of Veblen and caused endless problems of interpretation (18). Social scientists today have tended to interpret Veblen's concept of instinct as either an irreducible trait of human nature, or as ethical norms or social values which are used as criteria for criticizing institutions (19). The basic conception to which the instincts are associated is man's "proclivity for purposeful action." The expression of these instincts is shaped by rational thought and intelligence. In this way man is not totally a product of culture but is capable of "turning the forces of the environment to account" (20). Man's instincts are constantly reformed into new rationalizations which become new institutions, thus the institutions of society tend to cluster around man's instincts but the instincts do not determine the character of the institutions. The notion of instinct is then one of the building blocks of his theory of teleological action and cumulative causation. The other core concepts of "habits of mind" and "institutions" are similar concepts: they have meaning only in the context of a specific explanatory usage. For example, 'institutions' may refer to widely prevalent habits of thought in a given community, such that they are analogous to cultural themes or a Weltanschaung. However, Veblen may also use the concept to refer to the end products of these habits of mind or principles being applied to man's environment like when he discusses the "machine process." Finally, Veblen sometimes uses the concept to distinguish a type of character or personality whose thinking will be typical of the institutional pattern as when he uses the concept of "trained incapacity" (21). Veblen tends to merge historical process and individual action in the concept of institutions. In this respect man passes a judgment on the value of human conduct and approves or esteems the person who emulates the dominant institutions. He states for example, "Sensitive- ness to rebuke or approval is a matter of selective necessity under the circumstances of associated life. Without it no group of men could carry on a collective life in a material environment that requires shap- ing to the ends of man" (22). In Veblen's formulation, man's social action is dependent on his institutions and a sensitivity to approval and rebuke so that the prob- lem of understanding social action shifts from the problem of under- standing behavior, to a problem of understanding the essential meaning of the concepts, i.e., habits of mind, that man uses for his behavior.</page><page sequence="7">Evolutionary Theory 73 Veblen attempts to solve this problem by the use of a literary device consisting of creating a hypothetical historical reconstruction of the major institutions of a society and then positing an analysis of their transformation (23). III EVOLUTIONARY TRANSFORMATION OF 'INSTITUTIONS' ONCE WE HAVE GRASPED his framework for social action, and identi- fied various ends historically sought by man, then we are faced with the problem of understanding the pervasiveness and variation in these social modes. Veblen does not present his analysis as the final defini- tive formulation of the meaning of history as Comte or Marx presented in their formulations. For Veblen the historical framework is a means by which certain distinctive problems in the social realm can be identified. Veblen begins by sketching a hypothetical prehistoric culture which was small, peaceable, sedentary, and industrious. This hypothetical 'savage' society serves as his point of origin in constructing his evolu- tionary framework. The "fall" of savagery leads to a second stage, 'barbarism,' which is characterized by predatory institutions. The transformation from sedentary to predatory institution rests in a sequence of steps. First, man in his early history had a basic propensity to seek out and value "efficiency" and "serviceability" in economic conduct and see inefficiency and futility as odious. This is a necessary trait for the human race's early survival so that man values the manifestation of this "instinct of workmanship" in himself and others. In his early stage man's institutions are simply representations of the necessities of life. Social judgment may be made on the intentions of the social actor or on the serviceability of the act. In the former instance it is a moral judgment dealing with the potential to act, in the latter instance it is a judgment of efficency based on observed outcomes. Second, Veblen now turns his argument to the formulation of the institution based upon the imputation of esteem. "The visible achievement of one man is, therefore, compared with that of another, and the award of esteem comes habitually to rest on an invidious com- parison of persons instead of on the immediate bearing of the given line of conduct upon the approved end of action" (24). Finally, the basis of granting esteem shifts from its instinctive mani- festation in appraising efficiency to a comparison of the abilities of</page><page sequence="8">74 American Journal of Economics and Sociology different actors. What comes to be compared is the force which the actor is able to put forth. So, it becomes the goal of social action to put forth evidence of power or to emulate power. This is the major institutional feature of a predatory culture that values personal power more than useful activity (25). The transition in which objective judgments of action become per- sonalized status judgments of power occurs when archaic society grows larger, develops a more effective technology such that the "habits of life" of the savage group change to more aggressive barbarian schemes and become predatory institutions. Thus, a method of living becomes assimilated into thought, works into the scheme of life, and becomes a norm of conduct. It becomes a habitual line of thought and gives the basic perspective from which facts are apprehended and reduced to a body of cultural knowledge. Veblen's true interest was in understanding modern society. So the appropriate question is "How does he use this framework to illumi- nate modern society?" The answer seems to be that Veblen wished to demonstrate that institutions are fetishistic and that indeed their very power and pervasiveness is to be found not in their useful quali- ties but in their fetishistic qualities. Thus, when man's attention shifts from the evaluation of the ends of social action to an evaluation of the believed potential (or power) for social action, then this evalua- tion is fetishistic because it tends to preserve old institutional forms that may be maladapted to a new environment. This fundamental theme is basic to his analysis of the conservatism and "conspicuous waste" in the leisure class, and also the basis for his argument that business interests are in conflict with the development of technology in The Theory of the Business Enterprise (26). His strategy of social criticism is to show the fetishistic quality of institutions by placing them alongside the emergence of new institu- tional forms to create anomalies. By doing so he gives his analysis the critical view of seeing established institutions as anachronisms. This critical posture is given an even greater biting irony when Veblen analyzes what happens to new institutional forms in a society. For example, in his book The Higher Learning in America, Veblen shows that the development of large scale, secular higher education takes the form dictated by the principles of business management rather than a form dictated by the needs of scholarship. In this case the more culturally dominant institution of business enterprise dictates the direc- tion of changes in the institution of higher education.</page><page sequence="9">Evolutionary Theory 75 Nowhere is this analysis more maturely developed than in his books Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution and The Nature of Peace and the Terms of Its Perpetuation. Veblen begins by deducing the nature of the imperial State of Germany from his hypothetical reconstruction of the historical evolution of German political institu- tions. The earliest period, prior to Christianity, is characterized by peaceful anarchy centered around neighborhood autonomy and personal informal contact within the group. This order is destined to break down under the cumulative changes of the advance of the "industrial arts." Those changes that entail changes in the scale of social organi- zation effectively exceed the working limits of that undifferentiated anarchistic society (29). The group begins to value the economic exploits of its members so that great value is placed on the successful aggrandizement of a given individual member at the cost of outsiders who are exploited. "The predisposition of group solidarity coalesced with the bias of approval for the aggrandizement of their accredited spokesman [the kingj" (28). The dynastic institution is born out of a sense of loyalty and subordination to a powerful authority figure who wishes to expand territory and hold it by commanding loyalty. Veblen then takes up his analysis of history in the 19th century with a description of the German national government as being a ter- ritorial State: The territorial State is in effect a territorial aggregate with its popula- tion conceived as an estate belonging in usufruct to a given prince; the concept is visibly of feudal derivation, and the habit of mind which makes it a practicable form of political organization is the feudal habit of personal subservience to a personal master. In such a polity sub- ordination, personal allegiance, is the prime virtue, the chief condition precedent to its carrying on; while insubordination is the fatal vice, incompatible with such a coercive system (29). To Veblen this is most clearly recognized in the patriotic sense of "duty" found in the German people. Veblen then shows in his comparison of the case of Britain and the case of Germany how Germany "borrowed" an advanced industrial technology from the British without "borrowing" the old handicraft institutional forms that have retarded further technical growth of British industry. Veblen's observation about 'borrowing" technology by a culture is often cited as a helpful contribution to the sociology of development. But what is often ignored by contemporary sociolo- gists is the crucial point of Veblen's argument: for Veblen it is not technology itself that is important but the uses it is put to, and in the</page><page sequence="10">76 American Journal of Economics and Sociology case of Germany it was put to the ends of the dynastic State. The economic policy controlling commerce took on a distinct territorial form so that the empire through economic policy attempted to become a self-sufficient economic community dependent on no other foreign countries. The German trade policy was of a singularly mercantilistic kind, aiming at the ideal of a onesided trade in export. In addition, Germany acquired colonies in the hope of having a secure supply of raw material (30). Veblen also analyzes the fact that a great deal of capital was sunk into military hardware which supported the de- velopment of heavy industry like ship-building and railroads; that is to say, the commercial development followed from the military development. In general, then, one can say that Veblen leaves us with the eerie hypothesis that innovation in social change may simply allow archaic institutions to pursue archaic ends and because man tends to assume that his institutions are the proper realization of his desired ends they will remain the basis for future social action. IV CONCLUSION VEBLEN'S CRITICAL STYLE has often detracted from an examination of the method of his analysis. Veblen's idea that man is duped by his own institutions has often been attributed to Veblen's moody and cynical personality and not to his interpretative strategy. By con- structing hypothetical historical reconstructions Veblen is able to char- acterize man as being involved in purposeful action and desiring to know with "certainty" the outcomes of his actions. The desire for certainty is satisfied by following the familiar symbols of older suc- cessful lines of action. This forms a framework for his interpretative strategy that serves as a structure for observation of what is deemed to be the essential meaning of existing behaviors. What is observed is seen as coming out of some earlier pattern of useful action. In this way mundane cultural elements which have very little elaboration in the culture can be related to more significant patterns of institu- tional behavior; for example, Veblen's analysis of women's clothing styles. Other social practices which have elaborate rationalizations justifying them in our culture can be analyzed by showing that the elements are really mutually exclusive elements, such as Veblen's ob- servation that the inner logic of business practices are at odds with the needs of technical development and efficiency (31).</page><page sequence="11">Evolutionary Theory 77 The goal of any interpretative strategy is to allow us to understand the phenomena and direct our observations so that we are able to "read" the meaning of the cultural symbols. Yet the problem of the validity of our understanding is still with us, and Veblen poses no new solutions. Veblen's analyses often "ring true." However, social sci- ence is reluctant to accept an intuitive sense of correctness as valida- tion. One possible way to resolve this problem of validity is to see, where possible, if the conclusions drawn from such an analysis will allow us to predict man's actions. Veblen's analysis does not always lend itself to prediction, but Gould's study, The Technical Elite, based on current data on scientists and engineers in business, indicates that it is not impossible to evaluate Veblen's analysis empirically (32). In addition there is Veblen's own example of prediction in his essay on Japan, written in 1915, where he predicts that Japan will have to go to war within a generation (33). Yet prediction is a limited way of evaluating an interpretative strategy like Veblen's, and many aspects of man's actions can only be understood by analyzing the use of concepts in certain situations, i.e., a "test" of the intellectual coherence of social action. An interpreta- tive strategy must be evaluated in terms of its capacity to recognize the context, unexamined assumptions, and accepted concepts that are a part of man's mise en scene. This is what represents the real value of any interpretative strategy, and in these terms Veblen is still one of the great masters of the method. 1.

Some attention must always be given to Veblen's concepts because he makes some distinctions which most readers are not accustomed to making in reading social theory. Veblen's comments on his use of concepts are best pre- sented in his rejoinder to John Cummings' criticism of The Theory of the Leisure Class. (See "Mr. Cummings's Strictures on The Theory of the Leisure Class," Veblen, op. cit., 1934, pp. 16-31). The first point to be considered is a distinc- tion between "real" and "analytic" categories or concepts. A "real" category is one which social actors might use themselves and whose meaning is a part of the "community of men's" notions of legitimate ends of life. Veblen uses many of his concepts in this fashion, such as the concept of "wasteful" used in his dis- cussion of the leisure class. The "analytic" categories Veblen uses are seen as the technical terms of the theory itself whose meaning is confined to their use in the theory. Here Veblen is often purposefully vague using a number of synonyms for terms like "instinct" or "institution." Veblen does not make this distinction in his writing which causes a great deal of confusion about the nature of his argument. A second aspect which is troublesome in Veblen's work is nevertheless an almost inevitable one. Veblen's theory might be considered an open-system theory in that as an evolutionary theory which has no utopian historical end to it there is a constant interchange of man's institutions and the environment. This means that, for Veblen, the use of a concept does not necessarily imply the logical exclusion of other concepts. So Veblen might refer to something as waste- ful which does not mean that it does not have an economic use; it simply means that in his analysis its wastefulness is its most characteristic feature. 19.
