<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS reflexes, types of rebound, quantitative adjustment of reflex contraction, reciprocal innervation, speed of movement, etc. In concluding remarks the authors present a general principle which seems to emerge from their analysis of simple reflexes. It is that "the quantity of contraction presents itself as the resultant commonly of two interacting antagonistic central processes, excitation and inhibition." There are two appendices, a very complete bibliography of 209 references, and an index. University of California C. W. BROWN A Field Study of the Chimpanzee: Observations of Chimpanzee Behavior and Environment in Western French Guinea. By 'HENRY W. NISSEN. Foreword by Robert M. Yerkes. Comparative Psychology Monographs, 8, 1931, (no. 1). Pp. vi, 122, 41 pl. This account of chimpanzees in their natural habitat, the first study of its kind to be made by a psychobiologist, should prove almost as valuable to psychologists generally as to those interested primarily in animal behavior. Of necessity de- scriptive in emphasis, and admittedly an informational survey, the monograph nev- ertheless challenges many existing interpretations of anthropoid learning and social organization. It would appear, for example, that adaptation to the Umwege situ- ation is not as detached from previous experience as is assumed by those who postulate the concept of insight. The author, happily for his readers, has presented quotations from original notes and summaries of observations under the following broad but logically de- termined categories: social organization and physical appearance; nomadism, loco- motion, and activity distribution; nests and nesting; food and feeding; and so- cial behavior. Under the last mentioned category are included discussions of group leadership, play responses, contacts with other animals, reactions of chimpanzees to human behavior, and discussions of sound production and communication. Sup- plementing these observations and summaries, the reader will find interpretations which carry weight because they give resumes of the facts available and because they enjoy freedom from dogmatic assertion and anthropomorphic bias. Since the investigator has recognized frankly the limitations of his study, he qualifies as the best critic. Undoubtedly future field studies will profit from this pioneer research and will in turn modify certain of its hypotheses. Be that as it may, for the present Nissen has presented to his colleagues an excellent account of the chimpanzee in non-laboratory situations. University of Minnesota CHARLES BIRD Psychiatry and Mental Health. By JOHN RATHBONE OLIVER. New York, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1932. Pp. 330. The substance of this book was presented in the Hale Lectures in 1932 at the Western Theological Seminary with the purpose of orienting religious and social workers to the nature and peculiarities of abnormal people. The author has succeeded in producing a readable book, which may prove valuable to workers lacking psychiatric preparation. The appeal of the book as a whole is limited by the religious presuppositions of the author. The cases appended to each chapter are clearly illustrative and not typical. The bibliography is surprisingly inadequate so far as psychiatry is concerned. Trinity College ROBT. B. W. HUTT 781</page></plain_text>
