Philadelphia: Uni- versity of Pennsylvania Press, 2000. 283 pp. LERov MCDERMOTT Central Missouri State University The chapters of this wide-ranging anthology began as papers presented at the Fourth Gender and Archaeology Conference held at Michigan State University in October 1996. One wishes that the original conference theme of gender in ancient societies, as studied by both classical and anthropological archaeologists, had been retained as the integrating focus for this volume, for, with the exception of a cogent introductory chapter by Lynn M. Meskell, the effort to retrofit these papers into the currently fash- ionable rubric of the "body" only complicates an already hetero- geneous medley of topics. Both the strengths and the weaknesses of this anthology re- side alike in the diversity of topics it attempts to cover. On the one hand, the assumption that a common denominator underlies such disparate studies because they all involve the human "body" appears to depend as much on postmodernist wordplay and the willful conflation of homonyms as any demonstrated thematic logic. Certainly the physical existence of the biological human "body" is the beginning point for both skeletal remains and representational images of the human figure, but the mortu- ary practices and occupational stresses associated with the "body" in the grave and the creation of an image of the "body" in art are the result of such radically different cultural and material processes, and involve such specialized methodologies in their study, as to create a sense of almost surrealistic wonderment by their juxtapositioning. Those interested in the disparate ways in which gender can be culturally constructed, including possible alternative or third gender roles, will find this multidisciplinary melange of research papers far more focused than those looking for what skeletal remains, mortuary practices, and varying tradi- tions of representational image making can tell us about the cul- tural context of the "body." Whatever the theme, one would have liked to have seen more effort to extract common conclu- sions of method and theory. On the other hand, the sheer diver- sity of material evidence, cultures, funerary practices, and sty- listic traditions of image making found in these well-written and edited chapters, especially when combined with an absolutely superb bibliography collected at the end of the book, has much to offer the persevering reader interested in going beyond tradi- tional disciplinary boundaries and areas of expertise. Among the diverse contents of this volume, Meskell's brief interdisciplinary prospectus of recent "body" literature de- serves to be noted. She ranges widely through Cartesian dual- ism, corporeal philosophy, and Foucauldian concepts of power and provides an unusually succinct introduction to an often tur- gid subject. Part 1 is devoted to the study of the skeleton and mortuary ritual. Sandra Hollimon compares the ethnographic record of the Arikara on the North American Plains with proto- historic osteological evidence to examine the health conse- quences of gender roles in this society. Using the frequency of activity-induced pathologies such as degenerative joint dis- eases, she challenges Eurocentric assumptions about gender- based divisions of labor between Arikara men and women. Jane Peterson uses similar skeletal evidence in the form of muscu- loskeletal stress markers to reconstruct sexual labor patterns in the Levant of southwest Asia during the Natufian and Early Bronze Age transition from foraging to farming. Cluster analy- sis reveals increased activity levels for females relative to males during the Early Bronze Age. A conspicuous example of the va- riety found in this anthology is Marshall Becker's exploration of dental devices found in the graves of South Etruscan women. He concludes that these dental pontics represent decorative re- placements for deliberately removed teeth worn by high-status women. Barbara Crass turns to the mortuary ritual of Arctic Inuit hunt- ers to illustrate how the requirements of survival in a hostile en- vironment can impact cultural definitions of gender. The Arctic climate seems to foster interdependence and to account for the general lack of distinctive differences in the burials of males and females. In "The Status of Women in Predynastic Egypt," Stephen Savage considers burials of women relative to the emergence of the territorial state. The lack of differentiation be- tween male and female burials contrasts sharply with later dy- nastic practices and the development of patriarchy. Part 2 studies the interpretation of anthropomorphic images. Human representations on seals from Late Bronze Age Myce- naean and Minoan sites in the Aegean are examined by Senta German. Gendered biases of overt sexual symbols appear asso- ciated with the empowerment of the male in an increasingly complex society. Mireille Lee further evaluates the symbolism of dress in ancient Aegean society and argues that Minoan cloth- ing both communicated gender constructions to the viewer and reinforced social expectations in the wearer. Timothy McNiven uses images to focus on how gender identity was maintained in classical Greece and finds the privileged position of freeborn males being reinforced in the way "manliness" is contrasted with the cowardice of "womanly" behavior. Alice Kehoe's reinterpretation of female figurines from the Mississippian center of Cahokia (Missouri) as representing the cultural and economic importance ascribed to women's weav- ing and hide-preparation activities takes a similar symbolic ap- proach to images, albeit from the probable viewpoint of matri- archs. Brian Shaffer, Karen Gardner, and Joseph Powell identify specific gendered divisions of labor in the painted ce- ramic vessels from the Mimbres region of the Native American Southwest, while the complementarity of male and female im- ages in the rock art of the Puebloan region is investigated by Kelly Hays-Gilpin in relation to historic oral accounts. Male, fe- male, and gender-neutral figures on ancient Mesopotamian seals suggest to Susan Pollock and Reinhard Bernbeck that an established gender ideology operated to disparage the economic and political contributions made by women while exalting those of men. Ann Macy Roth examines ancient Egyptian beliefs about Father Earth and Mother Sky and suggests that they located the source of creative fertility in the male, rather than in the female, because of the unique Nile environment, with its annual life-giving floods. Finally, in the last chapter of this book, Margaret Beck looks at some recent analyses of European Upper Paleolithic "Venus" figurines and argues that selective sampling and re- searcher bias have affected interpretations of these figurines.</page></plain_text>
