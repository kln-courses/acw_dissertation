<plain_text><page sequence="1">'How does one become a good European?': the British press and European integration Gerlinde Hardt-Mautner VIENNA UNIVERSITY OF ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION abstract. European integration is far from being only a political and economic problem but has also led to social and cultural challenges, such as the definition of national identity vs European identity and the relationship between member states. There is also a growing sense that, for the non- expert citizen, the increasing complexity of the EU's institutions and policies means a de facto denial of access to information and policy- making. This paper investigates how the British daily press has been reflecting and responding to these challenges. National stereotyping, for example, is shown to play a key role in the portrayal of France and Germany. Also, data from the Sun are used to illustrate strategies employed to make elite discourse more accessible to the lay reader. key words: elite discourse, European integration, national identity, preju- diced discourse. - Ten or 20 years from now we'll all be good Europeans. - Oh? And how are we going to do that, William? How does one become a good European? Eat spaghetti vongole twice a week? Watch more Conti- nental films? Develop a passion for sauerkraut? ('Euro Bertha' by William Davis, Guardian , 23 October 1971: 11) 1. SETTING THE SCENE: NATIONAL IDENTITY IN THE EUROPEAN CONTEXT On 28 October 1971, emotions ran high in the debating chamber at West- minster. Prior to the crucial vote on whether Britain should join what was then the 'Common Market', the Home Secretary, Reginald Maudling, ended his speech with a snide comment on the 'anti-Marketeers' in the House by saying: (1) Those who vote against tonight are voting because they wish to remain the littlest of little Englanders' (Sun, 29 October 1971: 2) 1 The MPs thus derided turned out to be a minority. The result of the vote, discourse &amp; society © 1995 sage (London, Thousand Oaks, ca and New Delhi), vol. 6(2): 177-205.</page><page sequence="2">178 DISCOURSE &amp; SOCIETY greeted with a happy tumult ( Guardian , 29 October 1971: 1), was over- whelmingly in favour of Britain's entry. The Leader of the House, the Guardian reports, slapped his knee until it must have hurt. Four years later, a similar vote - this time on Britain's remaining within the EC - was put to the electorate in a referendum and produced a similar, about two-thirds, majority in favour. It was in the 1980s, however, that Britain's EC agenda was beginning to be dominated by increasing antagonism which first centred on Britain's contributions to the Community budget, and later, when the 1986 Single European Act had paved the way for political union, extended to such vexed questions as national sovereignty. Margaret Thatcher was to become notorious for her scepticism towards European integration. Her Bruges speech, made in 1988, is interesting not only as a manifesto of her approach, but also for the emphasis it puts on customs , traditions and identity 2 rather than merely on technicalities of unification. Using a vividly anthropomorphic phrase, she rejected the idea of trying to fit the European nations into some sort of identikit European personality ? The phrase lent itself to punchy headlines, such as that of the Daily Mirror , for example, which read: (2) THATCHER SCORNS IDENTIKIT EUROPE ( Daily Mirror, 21 September 1988: 2; capitalization in the original) In the early 1990s, with Maastricht looming, Britain continued to be an outsider in the European arena, in spite of John Major's protestations that he wanted Britain to be where we belong. At the very heart of Europe ( Daily Telegraph , 12 March 1991: 1). Anti-EC polemics in newspapers such as the Sun started taking the shape of crude prejudice against other European nations, notably the French - witness, for example, the following extract from the article starting off a campaign against the Commission President, Jacques Delors: (3) The Sun today calls on its patriotic family of readers to tell the feelthy French to frog off! {Sun, 1 November 1990: 1; capitalization in the original) At the same time, the idea was gaining currency that European inte- gration was a difficult matter that only a small elite of experts fully under- stood. It was felt that without some knowledge of politics, law, economics and finance, one could no longer hope to fathom the complexity of political concepts such as subsidiarity, or of events such as the withdrawal of sterling from the European Monetary System in September 1992. It is against this background that people polled by the Sun are 'quoted' as complaining, (4a) I don't think anyone properly understands what the Treaty means for us. The government should have explained in simple terms. (4b) No one has bothered to explain this and I don't think anyone really knows what it's about. (Sun, 24 September 1992: 2)</page><page sequence="3">hardt-mautner: Becoming a good European 179 This motif is by no means restricted to the tabloids. In the up-market Guardian with its predominantly AB-readership4 a similar note is struck when two characters in the Eurocats cartoon series are shown to be engaged in the following dialogue: (5) - If things get much worse it'll mean the end of the ERM. - Sounds good to me. - Why's that? - I'll be able to give up trying to understand it! ( Guardian , cartoon, 21 September 1992: 10) The passages quoted as Examples 1, 2, 3, 4a, 4b and 5 are representative of important thematic landmarks within the public debate on European inte- gration. There is, first of all, the question of national identity, which comprises (i) the definition of 'self' ('little Englander' vs 'European'), (ii) the perception of 'Europe' ('unity' vs 'separation', 'sameness' vs 'differ- ence', 'superstate' vs 'economic cooperation', etc.) and (iii) perceptions of Britain's fellow EC members. National identity emerges very much as a relational concept, the construction of 'self' being heavily dependent on the construction of 'other'. Furthermore, the EC/EU poses a problem of com- prehension which the media respond to by adopting the role of mediators between the elites shaping European politics about their reading public. In linguistic terms, this leads to the media's "colonization of commonsense language" which "serves to 'translate'-the sayings and doings of these [elite] people and institutions into a familiar idiom" (Hartley, 1982: 99). This process of 'translation' will be dealt with in greater detail in Section 4. At this stage, I want to stay with the problem of national identity for a moment and ask why it is that the EC/EU has been creating a problem of identity for the British. If the Treaty of Rome and the amendment nego- tiated at Maastricht were only about trading agreements between a number of countries, it is unlikely that a public debate of similar intensity and duration would have been sparked. However, European integration is about a lot more than trade, touching as it does upon issues such as the introduction of a common currency, the permeability of national borders and the powers of national parliaments. All of these are traditionally controlled by the nation state. In fact, the ability to exercise such control is often taken to be a defining criterion for the nation state, as opposed to a province, or a county, for example. At the same time, currencies, borders and parliaments are far more than economic and political technicalities. In the public domain they are symbols of nationhood, and for the individual they function as symbols of national identity. All over Europe, Picht (1993: 81) reminds us, a "fevered search for identity" can be observed; and for Britain in particular, geographically on the periphery and not one of the EC's founding nations, identification with Europe does not come naturally. Policy-makers in many European coun- tries have had a tendency to ignore problems of a sociopsychological, rather than merely a political or economic nature. That they do so at their peril is</page><page sequence="4">180 DISCOURSE &amp; SOCIETY shown, for example, by the narrow results of the recent referenda on the Maastricht Treaty. European integration provides a double challenge to people's sense of identity. On the one hand, it creates contact, on a variety of levels, between the individual European nations, making different identities meet - or clash, as the case may be - and forcing intercultural negotiation. On the other hand, the concept of Europe' itself includes a proposal for an alterna- tive, supra-national identity. There is a European Parliament, a European flag, currency and even anthem - symbols that demand acceptance and, ideally, the allegiance of EC/EU citizens. These symbols, together, of course, with the very real regulative powers of the EC/EU, are perceived as threats to individual national identities: As with the presence of aliens, the process of European Union generates a real fear of losing territory, personality and the power to control one's own affairs; in a word, there arises a crisis of identity which expresses itself in a reactive nationalism, often accompanied by chauvinistic and jingoistic manifestations. (Llobera, 1993: 77) In British newspapers, we find evidence of this trend at a fairly early stage of the EC's development. As early as 1971, a columnist for the Sun , though basically pro-EC at the time, complained: (6) We are joining a Europe of the clerks. [. . .] I am convinced that Britain ought to join Europe, if only as a gamble, yet I find all these European technocrats strangely repugnant. There is an atrocious sameness about them which sticks in my gullet. [. . .] I suppose that if we all have to become a shade ordinary, a bit average, a little identical, then this is a small thing compared with the vision of a united and peaceful Europe. (Sun, 24 January 1971: 6) More than 20 years later political integration is on the agenda and the Sun's editorial line has changed from cautious optimism to aggressive opposition. The vision of a united Europe is now said to be left to Euro idiots and dreamers , to 'federalists' and the boring Brussels bureaucrat Jacques Delors (Sun, 30 October 1990). Boring is a key adjective in this context. It is used as an epithet for Jacques Delors, for EC bureaucrats in general, and for the European currency unit, the ECU, which is also referred to as faceless , and as some meaningless hybrid that is poised to oust the cherished pound sterling (Sun, 30 October 1990); the latter is also described as the dear old pound (Sun, 1 November 1990) and as our quid (Sun, 1 November 1990). The spectre of European unification appears not only in the areas of politics and finance. On a more mundane level, EC/EU food legislation is thought to be tampering with foodstuffs and beverages as diverse as cucumbers, beer and prawn crisps. Sausages seem to be another problem case. The fear that EC/EU food laws may mean the end of the traditional sausage seems to have haunted the British public for over 20 years. In 1971, the Sun quotes Mr Oakes, a Labour MP, as saying (or 4storm[ing]' as the paper puts it):</page><page sequence="5">hardt-mautner: Becoming a good European 181 (7) 'It's a national disgrace. I don't want a great, white, insipid-looking saus- age. I want the traditional British banger.' (Sun, 22 October 1971: 4) In this short piece Mr Oakes/the Sun 5 runs the whole gammut of argumenta- tive devices typical of assertations of national identity. He talks, explicitly, of a national disgrace ; activates the cliché of the boring uniformity imposed by the EC (cf. Example 6 above); refers explicitly to 'tradition' and does so implicitly by using the familiar, regionally marked term banger. Nearly 20 years later, Mr Oakes' concern is shared by the then Agricul- ture Minister, who declares: I like British sausages and / am damned if I am going to have anyone else's sausages ( Daily Telegraph , 31 October 1990:9). Note the vague anyone else's , a clever ploy to avoid being seen as overtly anti-European. In 1992, the issue is taken up again in a satirical piece by Richard Littlejohn in the Sun , in which a Corporal Jones (the butcher in the popular TV sitcom, Dad's Army) says in a mock interview: (B). 'I did not fight two wars to have some foreigner tell me what kind of sausages I can sell [. . .] (Sun, 14 September 1992: 6) It is not only the EC, collectively, which is thought to be spelling trouble for the British. France and Germany, two larger and economically more powerful countries, are also seen to be threatening Britain's interests within Europe. Both challenges, the national and the supra-national one, have been leaving traces in media discourse, and it is the aim of this paper to investigate them. Sections 2 and 3 look at ways in which the print media construct British national identity in the context of the EC/EU debate. Section 2 is concerned with Britain's position relative to the EC, and Section 3 examines anti-French and anti-German prejudice, which plays a key role in newspapers' anti-European polemics. In Section 4, two articles from the Sun on the Maastricht Treaty are analysed in some detail, highlighting the strategies the paper employs to popularize the Treaty but also to denounce it as a threat to British interests. The data for this paper are drawn from selected periods between 1971 and 19926 and from four British daily papers, two qualities and two populars from two opposite ends of the political spectrum: the Guardian , the Daily Telegraph , the Daily Mirror and the Sun. 2. BRITAIN'S POSITION VIS-A-VIS THE EC: CONSTRUCTIONS OF SEPARATION AND DISTANCE Perhaps one of the most salient topoi of EC discourse is Britain's isolation from the rest of the EC. The physical correlative is the geographical separ- ation of the British Isles from mainland Europe, and this is then extended to refer to other, non-material forms of separation and distance, such as economic or political isolation. Argumentative patterns in this connection frequently rest on clusters of dichotomous relationships grouped around a juxtaposition of 'inside' vs</page><page sequence="6">182 DISCOURSE &amp; SOCIETY 'outside'. This pattern was particularly prominent in the 1970s, when the question was whether 'to go in' or 'stay out', but it also pops up now and again in the 1990s, when membership as such is hardly an issue anymore.7 Examples 9, 10 and 1 1 show how the 'inside '/'outside' dichotomy is linked to other pairs, such as us vs them (Example 9), yes vs no in the context of the referendum campaign, alone vs together , united vs divided (Example 10) as well as isolation and penury vs 'prosperity' (Example 11): (9) From today, the Common Market means not them, but us [. . .] the only fact that matters today is that at last we are in. (Sun, leader, 1 January 1973: 1) (10) You can vote yes - for a future together. Or no - for a future alone. [. . .] United we stand. Divided we fall. (Sun, leader, 4 June 1975: 14-15). (11) The only way Britain could be dominated is if we lived in isolation and penury outside, instead of playing a full, equal and prosperous part inside a federal Europe. (Daily Mirror , leader, 11 March 1991: 2) The 'inside'/'outside' pattern also forms the basis of a variety of meta- phors which replace the insuperable distance between island and mainland with less permanent physical barriers: a doorstep may be crossed (Example 12), a garden may be entered (Example 13), a spectator at the feast may eventually join in (Example 14), and a gate may be pushed open (Example 15): (12) [. . .] we have been waiting so long on Europe's chilly doorstep. (Daily Mirror , leader, 1 January 1973: 1) (13) [. . .] what the businessman has to realise is that we are no longer looking over the garden fence - we're in the garden (Daily Mirror , 1 January 1973: 12) (14) [. . .] from today Britain will have considerable influence from the inside of what is already one of the world's super-powers. For too long she has been an almost helpless spectator at the feast of the Six's growing economic wealth and political power. (Daily Telegraph , leader, 1 January 1973: 14) (15) He [John Major] signalled that he was a friendly insider for the new Europe, not an outsider snarling at the gate. ( Guardian , leader, 12 March 1991:22) It is interesting to note that in non-verbal representations such as draw- ings or cartoons newspapers pursue essentially the same line of argumen- tation. In the visual mode, the idea of Britain's 'moving closer to Europe' may be conveyed simply by superimposing the outline of the British Isles on mainland Europe, as was done in the Daily Express in the first week of January 1973; or by drawing a big arrow across from Britain to the Conti- nent, as in the Daily Mail of the same period.8</page><page sequence="7">hardt-mautner: Becoming a good European 183 In the 1990s, we find that the focus has shifted from the 'inside'/'outside' theme to the closely related dichotomy of 'centre' vs 'periphery' (Examples 16 to 19), with metaphorical extensions such as the heart of Europe. (16) T want us to be where we belong. At the very heart of Europe. Working with our partners in building the future.' [. . .] It was emphasised that the Prime Minister wanted to be in the centre of EC negotiations with the key players, France and Germany, rather than be seen as an unwilling, critical partner on the sidelines. ( Daily Telegraph, 12 March 1991: 1) (17) Given our exposed position on the fringe, the only honest and sensible policy is to continue patiently and forcefully arguing our case [. . .]. ( Daily Telegraph , leader, 9 December 1991: 16) (18) He [John Major] deeply desires, as does Douglas Hurd, to open a new era in which Britain gets closer to the heart of Europe on something like its own terms: which means keeping governments and not the Community in charge of both foreign policy and policing policy. ( Guardian , Commentary by Hugo Young, 10 December 1991: 24) (19) [. . .] after Maastricht, Britain remains firmly at the centre of the Com- munity, in a position to wield real influence during the ongoing debate on the future of Europe. [. . .] our semi-detached position, especially on EC social legislation, could make Britain seem notably attractive to foreign investors [. . .]. ( Daily Telegraph , 12 December 1991: 20) It is symptomatic of the European question that the term Europe itself is notoriously vague. Although it is frequently used as a synonym of 'the EC', it can still also refer to mainland Europe only, excluding the British Isles. Furthermore the semantic fuzziness characteristic of Europe , also extends to the adjective and the noun European. In Example 20 we find it used to refer to 'supporters of the European Community'; in 21, dating from 1991, European means 'belonging to Continental Europe': (20) Labour's Europeans know that, whether Mr Heath personally survives or not, it is a myth that their votes could push the Tories out of office. ( Sun , The Shrimsley Column', 28 October 1,971: 6) (21) The European taste for indulging in grand visions is all very fine but, from the British consumer's point of view, the vision is of high interest rates, a cold economic winter and a very late spring. ( Daily Telegraph , 'City Comment', 11 December 1991: 23) In addition, European can carry associations of a commitment to European culture and traditions. Used in this way, the adjective European is gradable, and the noun can take modifiers. You can be 'more' or 'less' .European or a 'true' European; the meaning of the term is negotiable, and has become malleable enough to be adapted to the rhetorical strategies of individual politicians, parties or newspapers. Example 22, a statement by Margaret Thatcher, quoted in the Daily Telegraph (as well as in the other four papers investigated), is a case in point:</page><page sequence="8">184 DISCOURSE &amp; SOCIETY (22) 'We should not let those who support a federal Europe pretend that they are somehow more European than the rest of us. They are not. They are just more federal. There is nothing specifically European about a federal structure: the opposite. It is the nation State which is European. [. . .] The true Europeans are those who base themselves on Europe's history and traditions rather than on constitutional blueprints.1 (Margaret Thatcher quoted in the Daily Telegraph , 27 June 1991: 11) The ambiguity of European is most striking when several shades of mean- ings co-occur within one and the same text, as is the case in a columnist's piece in the Daily Mirror dating from 5 June 1975 (Example 23). The consistent ambiguity of Europe and European is a tell-tale sign that there is an unresolved and undisclosed conflict between alternative views which are reflected in the discourse: (23) (a) [Europeans = supporters of the EC]: [. . .] all those faceless, memo-writing organisation men dreaming of cen- tralised data banks [. . .] - to a man, they are fervent Europeans. (b) [ Europe - Continental Europe; Europeans = Continental Euro- peans]: [. . .] the quality of life as it is lived in Europe [. . .] The Europeans enjoy themselves more than we do because they are better equipped for it. (c) [Europe = the EC; more European = more devoted to European lifestyle] I may be naive in hoping that remaining in Europe will make us more European. But after a thousand years of insularity, from which have evolved the bingo parlour, carbonated beer and 'Crossroads', I am inclined to give it a whirl. ( Daily Mirror , 'Keith Waterhouse on Thursday1, 5 June 1975: 12) In the examples quoted in this section, Europe/the EC is not conceptual- ized as an assembly of individual nations,, but is seen as a whole, defined both geographically (as mainland Europe) and politically (as the EC). However, as we shall see in the following section, Britain's position in Europe is also defined in relation to individual European nations, particu- larly the two largest and economically most powerful ones, France and Germany. 3. THE EC DEBATE AND NATIONAL STEREOTYPING At first sight, the French and the Germans seem unlikely victims of negative stereotyping. As far as demographic and social criteria are concerned they differ markedly from the 'classic' targets of prejudice. France and Germany are highly developed, industrialized economies offering high standards of living to large sections of the population. There are no mass emigration movements from these countries and in terms of history, culture, traditions and lifestyle France and Germany are comparatively closely related to Britain.</page><page sequence="9">hardt-mautner: Becoming a good European 185 Much as the socio-economic background may differ from that of the more 'typical' victims of prejudice, anti-French and anti-German discourse makes use of essentially the same argumentative patterns. As far as pre- ferred topics are concerned, for example, we find striking similarities with the topic classes that van Dijk has identified for racist discourse: (A) They are different (in culture, mentality, norms). (B) They do not adapt. (C) They are involved in negative acts (nuisance, crime). (D) They threaten our socioeconomic interests. (van Dijk, 1987: 58) Within the EC debate, this basic pattern is of course modified due to the different political, economic and social context. Topic Class B on the whole does not apply because the nations/cultures in question have no permanent direct contact and questions of assimilation thus do not arise. By the same token, one might expect that Class A, concerning 'difference', would also apply to a lesser extent than in mainstream racist data. After all, the differences between the nations/cultures involved in this particular case are comparatively small and there is a great deal of common ground in 'culture, mentality, and norms'. Also, it must be stressed that the inter-European conflict is not a racial or ethnic conflict. Danes, Italians and Britons argue about 'nation', but they do so as racially and ethnically homogeneous groups, regardless of the multicultural diversity within their societies. EC discourse is essentially elite discourse and those perceived as 'non-indigen- ous' only ever appear in the role of actual or potential immigrants, even if, like Eastern Europeans, they share the European cultural heritage. In spite of the cultural proximity of the French and the Germans, state- ments of 'difference' do occur, however. Three topic areas can be identi- fied. (1) Stereotyping draws on the symbolic force of national dress and national diet. In cartoons one can identify the (invariably male) German by his Bavarian Lederhosen and his shaving brush hat, with the beer mug an optional accessory. Frenchmen wear berets and, occasionally, striped sailors' T-shirts. The British themselves are no exception here, routinely sporting a bowler hat and umbrella. This is true of cartoons in the up- market press as well the tabloids, and continues unchanged during the whole period included in the corpus (early 1970s to early 1990s). At the level of caricature, differences are maintained which at least in urban Europe have ceased to exist - evidence, once more, of the fact that media discourse does not mirror differences in the real world, but constructs them. Because there are no reliable physical indicators to tell Frenchmen, Ger- mans and Britons apart, a stereotypical dress code is used as a surrogate. Similarly, food and drink regarded as 'typical' of a nation contribute to constructing the respective national stereotype. The following passage taken from a leader in the Sun , is a case in point. Sauerkraut is used predictably, in connection with the Germans (just as pizza is associated with the Italians and soupçon with the French - presumably playing on 'soup'.</page><page sequence="10">186 DISCOURSE &amp; SOCIETY The interesting innovation here consists in grammaticalizing these elements and using them as modifiers: (24) They [the members of the EC] have gained in wealth. In jobs. In social benefits. In freedom. And what have they lost? Sovereignty? Rubbish! • Are the French a soupçon less French? • Are the Germans a sauerkraut less German? • Are the Italians a pizza less Italian? OF COURSE THEY ARE NOT! And neither would Britain be any less British. (Sun, leader, 4 June 1975: 14; capitalization as in the original) What this passage also illustrates is how thin the dividing line is between ostensibly 'neutral' and downright negative stereotypes. Although Example 24 makes no explicitly negative statements about the Germans and Italians, the clichéd association with sauerkraut and pizza respectively is sufficient to activate a stereotypical view of these nations. After all, a common term of abuse for Germans is, precisely, krauts. (2) Another stock ingredient of stereotyping is the imitation of foreign accents through deviant spelling. The tabloids, predictably, are particularly fond of this technique and they use it mainly in cartoon captions whose fictional speech easily allows such manipulation. The Daily Mirror , for example, quotes Helmut Kohl as saying to John Major, Come back John. It vos only a joke (6 December 1991). In the Sun , two French gendarmes exclaim, Mon Dieu! Ze British vandals 'ave struck again ! (2 November 1990), and in another cartoon Delors says to Major, 'ello, wot you doing up ' ere ? (17 October 1992). (3) The third area in which constructions of 'difference' occur is that of political culture. In the 1990s, with European integration acquiring an increasingly political dimension, the papers construct a contrast between the British approach, which is described as pragmatic and down-to-earth, and the European approach, spearheaded by the French and the Germans, which is supposedly inspired by 'grand visions' of a united Europe. One of the Telegraph's leaders published during the Maastricht summit (9 December 1991) talks about Britain's task in strapping the visionaries into their seats, and about limiting the injury that could be suffered by others if the Europe of the philosophers runs so far ahead of itself down the federalist road that it falls over its own peoples. A contrast is set up between our limited view of the EC's future, and the grand schemes of some of our partners. Britain, the author argues, ought to be enabled to check the extremists and put the EC on a sane and realistic path for the future. The same point is made repeatedly by the Sun in its notoriously aggress- ive tone. Also at the time of the Maastricht summit, the paper prints a picture of Jacques Delors, then president of the EC Commission, and adds a caption that reads Delors . . . federal EC dream. Three out of these four words are in fact negatively charged within the universe of the Sun's</page><page sequence="11">hardt-mautner: Becoming a good European 187 European discourse: dream , Delors and federal. Delors has been positioned as a scapegoat for British anxieties about Europe and as such is the target of repeated personal, often below-the-belt, attacks. (One of these, starting with an article headed Up Yours Delors , of 1 November 1990, will be discussed in greater detail below.) Second, the adjective federal is stigma- tized, because in Britain it is associated with more central control, not less, as is the case in Germany. Extracts 25 and 26 below are further examples of dream having acquired a negative value in this particular discursive environment. The European dream, originally associated with peace and prosperity, is now seen as a threat to British interests: (25) But history will be less than kind to him [John Major] if Britain is sacrificed for a European dream. {Sun, leader, 14 September 1992: 6) (26) Even Mr Major must accept one unpalatable truth: The European dream is in tatters. [. . .] Let's hear no more nonsense about going back into the ERM or trying to salvage the Maastricht treaty. (Sun, leader, 21 Sep- tember 1992: 6) Also in September 1992, the Sun runs a special leader in its business section (Sun Money Says), which is headed The Euro Idiots and continues: (27) ex-premier Edward Heath and Euro danger man Jacques Delors have gone deaf, Sun Money can reveal today. Either that or the two are idiots and dreamers - and that can't possibly be the case. Can it? (Sun, 22 September 1992: 24; capitalization in the original) All this berating of philosophers, dreams and visions reeks suspiciously of anti-intellectualism that is perhaps less British than 'British and Conserva- tive'. Certainly the evidence from the corpus suggests that the Labour- oriented Guardian and the Daily Mirror do not cultivate this topos. The following quote from the Mirror , for example, shows that it uses vision in a positive sense: (28) There can be no grander vision for a European leader than that of ever closer unity in Europe - a Europe in which war carinot be imagined but lasting peace and prosperity can. (Daily Mirror, leader, 21 September 1992: 2) Praise of British pragmatism from Conservative quarters also occurs in an article in the Daily Telegraph by Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, who declares with presumably unintentional ambiguity and irony that Tories believe in taking decisions at the lowest practical level (27 June 1991: 16). So much for van Dijk's Topic Class A, assertions of difference. Topic Class C, "They are involved in negative acts", is obviously closely related to it. Explicit, negative other-presentation is the crassest form of prejudiced</page><page sequence="12">188 DISCOURSE &amp; SOCIETY discourse, and it is most prominent in the Sun , the most jingoistic of the four papers investigated. The main targets, as mentioned before, are the French and the Germans, and I shall deal with them in turn. The French For a fairly comprehensive survey of anti-French clichés one need only turn to the article which opens the Sun's 1990 campaign against Jacques Delors: (29) 1 UP YOURS DELORS 2 At midday tomorrow Sun readers are urged to tell the French fool where 3 to stuff his ECU 4 The Sun today calls on its patriotic family of readers to tell the feelthy 5 French to frog off! 6 They insult us, burn our lambs, flood our country with 7 dodgy food and plot to abolish the dear old pound. 8 Now it's your turn to kick them in the Gauls. 9 We want you to tell Froggie Common Market chief Jacques Delors 10 exactly what you think of him and his countrymen. 11 At the stroke of noon tomorrow, we invite all true-blue Brits to face 12 France and yell 'Up Yours, Delors.' 13 The ear-bashing from our millions of readers will wake the EC 14 President up to the fact that he will never run our country. 15 His bid to replace the £ with the faceless ECU is the last straw after 16 centuries of Froggy Brit-baiting.

(Sun, 1 November 1990: 1; capitalization, italics, underlining and paragraph indentation as in the original) The headline, Up Yours Delors , as indeed the whole campaign, exemplifies the strategy of personalization. Instead of directing its attack at an amor- phous mass, 'the French', the paper singles out a prominent scapegoat and</page><page sequence="13">hardt-mautner: Becoming a good European 189 combines personal with general abuse. Negative news actor labels are used for the individual scapegoat as well as for the collective target. Delors is the French fool (I. 2) and Froggie Common Market Chief ( 1. 9). The French are given the epithet 'filthy' (1. 4), spelt feelthy in imitation of the French accent (see Item [2] above, on foreign accents). Elsewhere in the same issue of the paper, they are referred to as the Frogs and those Froggies. Negative 'other'- presentation goes hand in hand with positive 'self -presentation. In 1. 11 the British are described as true-blue (i.e. patriotic and Conservative); they are, it is implied, strong and brave like the symbolic British lion: let 'em hear the British lion roar. (LI. 31f.: note how h-dropping is used here to convey the familiarity of colloquial speech.) The label Brits (1. 11) also sounds chummy, jovial and is therefore suited to create in-group feelings. Lines 6 and 7 as well as 16-28 specify a series of 'negative acts', first as general truths in the present tense simple (11. 6f.), and then as 'reports' in the past tense (11. 16-28). French aggression is shown to be directed at important national symbols, such as the currency ( the dear old pound [1. 7], contrasted with the faceless ECU [1. 15]), as well as food ( flood our country with dodgy food [11. 6f], banned British beef [1. 22], their foul soft cheese [. . .] riddled with listeria bugs [11. 23f.]). The syntactic parallelism of the sentences in 11. 19-28 presents the various 'negative acts' as being of the same order of magnitude, no matter whether they are contemporary or historical, petty or momentous. The historical flashback works in reverse chronological order, starting with events earlier this year (1. 17), then proceeding to last year (1. 20), the Second World War (11. 25f.) and 1815 (11. 27f.) before returning to the present with a reminder of the most immediate 'threat', the predicted invasion of the garlic-breathed bastilles9 through the Channel Tunnel (11. 29f.). A climax is built up through the joint effect of the chronological sequence, syntactic parallelism (involving a thematized main verb) and typographical consistency (block capitals for the fronted verbs). The Sun's outspokenness in disseminating anti-French prejudice is quite unique, but this should not blind us to the fact that the quality papers, too, can occasionally be caught red-handed. The following passage from the Daily Telegraph , for example, seems to echo the Sun's garlic-breathed bastilles : (30) Britain's 10,000-year-old physical isolation from the Continent ended at 7.30 last night with 'the first whiffs of garlic' through the Channel tunnel via a 100-metre-long probe linking the teams burrowing towards each other, 130ft. below the seabed, write John Petty, Transport Correspondent, and Suzanne Lowry in Paris. ( Daily Telegraph , 31 October 1990: 1) The quotation marks are only used for distancing purposes, because in fact no-one is being quoted here (least of all the Sun , whose article on Delors did not appear until the following day and which would in any event hardly be considered worth quoting by the Telegraph). It is through the use of the quotation marks that the cliché of garlic smell can be admitted to the sophisticated world of the Daily Telegraph.</page><page sequence="14">190 DISCOURSE &amp; SOCIETY The Germans The Germans are the second major target of national prejudice. The two main sources of conflict between Germany and Britain, as described in the media, are Germany's economic prowess, on the one hand, and its commit- ment to further European integration, on the other. Both are potentially threatening to the British; to their socio-economic interests - witness van Dijk's Topic Class D - but also to their sense of identity, because German influence within the EC/EU and the move towards federalism are perceived as a loss of control, and the ability to control one's own destiny is regarded as a defining criterion of national identity. In September 1992, the sterling crisis and its subsequent withdrawal from the ERM brought anti-German sentiment to a head. Why, asks the colum- nist Ken Livingstone (left-wing Labour MP) in the Sun, are we letting German politicians dictate to us? [. . .] And why is our government letting discredited German politicians dictate our policies? (9 September 1992: 6). Dennis Skinner (another left-wing Labour MP) is quoted as saying, I'm fed up with the British economy being crushed by German jackboots (Sun, 11 September 1992: 2). The subheadline of the same article reads, It's sabo- tage, say Treasury bosses, and further down it says, Britain and its EC partners believe the Bundesbank is waging a ' dirty war ' to protect its role as the Community's powerhouse. A feature on 19 September 1992 is headed How Germans lord it over us. The article in fact describes the superior standard of living of Hans and Silvia Huschka, a typical German working- class couple from Munich. There is no direct link between the headline and the text. The reader is not told how Hans and Silvia Huschka's eating out once a week or their saving up for a holiday home should be an instance of 'lording it' over Britain. In the course of September 1992, metaphors of aggression and war abound. On the 25th one of the Sun's headlines runs Germans ' are killing ERM', and on the 29th it is even Germans declare war on Britain. It is only a slanging war, though, we are told in the lead sentence, and it broke out as the Germans responded to 'Nazi' jibes by Tory tough guy Norman Tebbit : (31) Outspoken Lord Tebbit had claimed the Bundesbank was trying to achieve what Hitler failed to do - total domination of Europe. [. . .] Lord Tebbit last night denied he had ever accused the Bundesbank of being governed by Nazis. He added: i may have said that the mark could be doing what the panzers failed to do and establish power across Europe, but that is differ- ent.' (Sun, 29 September 1992: 2) On the 30th, the Norman Tebbit affair has a sequel. Apparently Norman Lamont (the Chancellor) has apologized to the Germans, to which the Sun1 s cartoonist responds by showing a V2 rocket aiming at Downing Street. The message of the cartoon is clear: Lamonťs apology notwithstanding, the Germans are war-mongering Nazis after all. The up-market dailies, while eschewing the sensationalist tone of the Sun and its ilk, also have their share in perpetuating anti-German prejudice.</page><page sequence="15">hardt-mautner: Becoming a good European 191 The following piece from the Daily Telegraph , an extract from a commen- tary by Robert Harvey, is remarkable not only for its crudeness but also as an example of how a quality paper provides a floor for an extreme view that editorial discretion would probably not allow to be published in the paper's own voice: (32) Germany's performance in the last few weeks seems most reminiscent of that of the bloated Bürgermeister of some small provincial town, wallowing in sausages-and-sauerkraut prosperity and uninterested in the wider world beyond. 'I think the Germans have become selfish, cowardly and emotion- ally lazy', says a prominent German academic. ( Daily Telegraph , commen- tary by Robert Harvey, 13 March 1991: 18) It is interesting to note that the author himself, Robert Harvey, resorts to a distancing device, quoting and thus hiding behind an unnamed 'authority', a prominent German academic , to whom the generalizing description of the Germans as selfish , cowardly and emotionally lazy can be safely ascribed. In another instance, we find the Guardian retreating behind the fictional and humorous genre of the cartoon to convey an image of German ag- gression. On the day before the Sun published its V2-rocket cartoon, the Guardian featured a front-page cartoon showing a Bundesbank official who says, Tve a good mind to put Werner [sic] von Braun on the 100DM note. In essence, this is an educated version of the Sun1 s cartoon, simply requiring different background knowledge to be decoded. National stereotyping is thus an important thematic strand running through newspapers' coverage of 'European' issues. Another, equally im- portant strand consists in papers' treatment of the more narrowly economic and political aspects of European integration. An account of EC/EU dis- course would be incomplete if it did not consider the media's role in disseminating 'hard' facts to the public. This will be the concern of the next section. 4. THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE: TWO CASE STUDIES FROM THE SUN In the context of the EC/EU debate, newspapers position themselves not only as chroniclers and opinion-leaders, but also as educators setting out to simplify and explain the complexities of European integration. Whether it is the European publishing a glossy supplement entitled Maastricht Made Simple (1992) or the Sun entitling an article in question-and-answer format What the hell is Maastricht about? (22 September 1992: 6): these are cases of the media assuming a didactic role as mediator between the elite discourse of politicians and technocrats on the one hand and the (presumed) lay discourse of its readers on the other. Like any didactic transformation process, the papers' mediation, too, holds considerable potential for man- ipulating the instructed. To illustrate how this works in practice, I want to begin by analysing the Sun's question-and-answer sequence on Maastricht mentioned above. The second half of this section then proceeds to discuss</page><page sequence="16">192 DISCOURSE &amp; SOCIETY an article which appeared in the same paper two days later. Its headline reads You say : Tear up the Treaty and it picks up a number of points made in What the hell is Maastricht about? The two articles are prime examples of the tabloids' practice of amalgamating news and views, and they shed an interesting light on populist EC discourse. Let us discuss each of them in turn. A. What the hell is Maastricht about?10 On 22 September 1992, the Sun started a telephone poll on the Maastricht Treaty, calling it the Euro referendum , and declaring on the title page: John Major won't give you a referendum on Europe - but The Sun will. Two telephone numbers are given, one for no and one for yes (in that order!), but before deciding , readers are reminded, turn to Page Six and read our guide to what Maastricht will mean. Given the slant of the article, as well as the Sun's previous anti-EC record, the result of the poll was, of course, a foregone conclusion.11 The article consists of 14 simple answers to your questions . It is printed on the lower half of Page Six, in a box next to the leading article. The questions range from the very general (e.g. What is the Maastricht Treaty about?) to specific issues such as the single currency, employment, European citizen- ship, defence and immigration.12 The process of transformation from a complex legal document to a pseudo-dialogue of instruction involves a change from the written into the (pseudo-)spoken mode and from monolo- gic into dialogic discourse. The imaginary persona of the questioner serves as a figure of identification for the reader, and the fake interactivity suggests that what is going on is not so much top-down indoctrination as enlighten- ment responding to grass-roots initiative. The questioner indeed has the first 'turn', but then remains locked in the position of a passive interviewer who does not engage in the 'interaction'. In this rigid question-and-answer pattern the answers are never contradicted but are left to stand as authori- tative and definitive statements right up to the last 'turn'. The 250-page treaty is covered in less than half a page, and only a handful of issues are selected for discussion. Provisions that might throw a more positive light on the treaty are simply ignored. One notable omission is the concept of subsidiarity, for example (which was, incidentally, already part of the Treaty of Rome of 1957). Nor do we learn anything about the treaty's general objectives other than the initial claim (11. 9-11) that it aims to tie the 12 European Community countries closer together politically by 1999 and [i]n effect [. . .] creates a United States of Europe (anathema to Sun readers) which will be run from Brussels (another negatively loaded catchphrase). The equivalent passage from the Treaty, Articles A and B of its Common Provisions, reads quite differently. Featuring clusters of optimistic (and, arguably, rather vague) expressions - none of which appears in the Sun - the Treaty portrays European integration as an undisputedly desirable undertaking that one cannot but wholeheartedly support. After all, who could object to an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe in which</page><page sequence="17">hardt-mautner: Becoming a good European 193 decisions are taken as closely as possible to the citizen ; who would not want to see relations between the Member States organized in a manner demon- strating consistency and solidarity? And what objective could there be more laudable than to promote economic and social progress which is balanced and sustainable ( Treaty on European Union , 1992: 7)? The Sun's argument would obviously crumble if it were to repeat any of this, just as the paper would risk jeopardizing its self-appointed role as the arbiter of British national pride if it quoted Article F from the Treaty, which in fact declares: (33) The Union shall respect the national identities of its Member States, whose systems of government are founded on the principles of democracy. {Treaty on European Union , 1992: 9) It is quite evident that the comparison between the Treaty and the Sun's rendering of it does not allow one to pigeonhole the former as a somehow 'neutral' text and the latter as a biased re-interpretation. If we are interested in mediated discourse, the Treaty is simply the point of reference against which the newspaper text is measured. As a curious by-product of the analysis, however, it emerges that the Treaty, for all its official status as a document of international law, is itself rich in emotional, vague and persua- sive language. Though this insight clearly runs counter to the popular notion of 'objective' legal language, it is entirely in keeping with one of the axioms of critical discourse analysis, the concept of structured representation (cf. Fowler, 1991: 208). Examining the content of the article in greater detail, one finds that the statements made in the answers range from conjectures and inaccuracies to blatant untruths. The declared aim of the article, simplification and clarifi- cation, is abused for misrepresentation and obfuscation. On two occasions, this is done by replacing the specific lexical item used in the Treaty with a more general lexical item which means, or at least strongly implies, the exact opposite. While the Treaty refers to indirect taxation (Art. 99), the Sun claims Britain would lose a lot of control over raising taxes (1. 38). Without the qualifying adjective, however, taxes is commonly taken to refer to direct taxes, that is, the kind of tax that is collected on a pay-as-you-earn basis and thus tends to be most obvious and most objectionable to the general public. Furthermore, it says in one of the answers that Under Maastricht , people would be able to vote in elections in whichever member country they chose to live in (11. 57f.). Elections , though strictly speaking a superordinate term covering all kinds of elections, is normally understood to be a synonym of general elections, which decide on the composition of national parliaments and governments. What the Maastricht Treaty actually says about 'elections' is this, however: &lt;34&gt; Every citizen of the Union residing in a Member State of which he is not a national shall have the right to vote and to stand as a candidate at municipal elections in the Member State in which he resides, under the same con- ditions as nationals of that State. [. . .] [. . .] every citizen of the Union residing in a Member State of which he is</page><page sequence="18">194 DISCOURSE &amp; SOCIETY not a national shall have the right to vote and to stand as a candidate in elections to the European Parliament in the Member State in which he resides, under the same conditions as nationals of that State. (Article 8b, Treaty on European Union , 1992: 15f.) The replacement of a hyponym ( indirect taxation , municipal elections , elec- tions to the European Parliament) with a hypernym ( taxation , elections) allows the journalist to commit misrepresentation while guaranteeing im- munity from prosecution (legal or rhetorical). There is always the possi- bility of hiding behind the argument that indirect taxes are, after all, a special kind of taxes, just as municipal elections can legitimately be called elections. In the answer on immigration, the Sun is more specific than the Treaty. Article K.l of the Treaty's Title VI includes asylum policy among the matters of common interest . Although, according to Article K.3, The Council may [. . ./ decide that measures implementing joint action are to be adopted by a qualified majority , it is doubtful whether in practice anything but a unanimous decision could be carried through. Yet the Sun talks about Brussels 'dictating' policies (11. 66f.) and translates the rather general and abstract wording of the Treaty into the very concrete Bosnian refugees (11. 68f.), with the mention of 50,000 being a clear instance of the "rhetoric of numbers" (Roeh and Feldmann, 1984: 347ff). In another case the Sun simply makes a wrong claim about the Treaty. The European Central Bank, it says in 11. 48f., would squeeze inflation out of countries like Britain by imposing higher taxes and creating more unemploy- ment. However, the purview of the ECB, as detailed in the Maastricht Treaty (Art. 105, 105a and 108a) does not include taxation, and, paradoxi- cally, even if it did, higher taxes could even increase inflation and need not necessarily squeeze it out. Furthermore, the allegation is left unsubstan- tiated as to how the ECB (rather than economic policy as a whole) should create more unemployment. Comparing the original treaty and the Sun's popularized version, the account given so far has concentrated on divergences in discourse structure and content. But clearly other factors are involved, too. First, the article uses colloquial language stripped of the technical lexis and syntactic pat- terns characteristic of legal discourse. There is none of the over-explicitness and syntactic complexity that makes the Treaty difficult to read (cf. Example 34). The vocabulary is colloquial, too, drawing on the standard range of experience of the lay reader. The EU budget becomes the kitty (1. 52); the Single European Act is said to chop down trade barriers (1. 29), the Treaty is described as having been thrashed out in Maastricht (1. 13), and countries will be forced to stick to common targets for inflation (1. 19), to mention but a few examples. Second, the change in register involves the elimination of shall, which the treaty uses consistently with third-person subjects in the meaning of must , in accordance with the conventions of legal discourse. Third, the two texts use radically different systems of point of view. The Treaty, as an official document, is to publicize an agreement among the High Contracting Parties , and it does not acknowledge the</page><page sequence="19">hardt-mautner: Becoming a good European 195 presence of an individual reader. Nor does it adopt a national point of view, British or otherwise. In the Sun , by contrast, the use of we shows that the imaginary questioner and the answerer are placed in the same deictic frame of reference. Both use we and our to refer to Britain. The we not only establishes solidarity between the knowledgeable journalist and the mock reader-interviewer, but is also designed to instil in the reader a sense of personal empowerment. Remote though the idea may be to the individual that he or she actually 'controls the economy' and 'passes laws', using we to refer to the state does suggest direct personal influence on these matters. We is thrown into sharp relief by its juxtaposition with them , that is, countries, institutions and personalities that could supposedly exert power over Britain under the Maastricht Treaty. These include unelected Brussels bu- reaucrats (1. 24), also referred to as the penpushers (1. 46), France, Germany and Italy (11. 9, 47, 51, 75f.), Brussels (11. 11, 66f.), Jacques Delors (11. 16, 53), the European Central Bank (11. 19, 38, 48), poorer EC countries (11. 51f.) 13 and the Council of Ministers (1. 69). That the questioner is also positioned as an individual, 'rather than as a mere spokesperson of the nation, becomes clear through the use of me in 1. 41. The ultimate test of the Treaty is whether it leads to immediate personal gain, rather than a more general economic upturn: would Maastricht make me better off ? By way of summarizing, let us examine another passage from the Treaty and the Sun respectively to see how the various strategies discussed so far interact to transform official, legal discourse into the pseudo-private dis- course of a popular medium. The following extract from the Treaty (Art. 8) deals with European citizenship, a sensitive issue that has alerted national sensibilities. &lt;35&gt;. . 1. Citizenship . of the Union is hereby established. Every person holding the nationality of a Member State shall be a citizen of the Union. ( Treaty on European Union , 1992: 15) In the Sun's question-and-answer format this reads as follows: (36) Q Will we still be British citizens? A You'll still be British but you'll really be a European citizen. We've already got those new red EC passports. (11. 55-7) In the newspaper, the issue is approached from a British and a personal vantage point. We is used in the question, and though the answer begins with you (probably the personal rather than the generic type) it then also switches to we , claiming membership of the same group for both reader and journalist. The stylistically marked, genre-specific performative is hereby established only occurs in the Treaty, and so does shall. By referring to those new red EC passports the paper replaces the abstract notion of citizenship with a tangible and familiar object associated with it. Note also the use of those , a demonstrative implying "dislike or disapproval" (Quirk et al., 1985: 374) while at the same time 44 'pointing] back' in a vague way to some shared experience" (Quirk et al., 1985: 375). The semantics of those thus also contributes to establishing common ground between the lay 'inter-</page><page sequence="20">196 DISCOURSE &amp; SOCIETY viewer' and the expert 'interviewee'. As with the other topics, the Sun's version of Article 8 also constitutes a reinterpretation rather than only a simplified rewording. While the Treaty establishes an additional citizen- ship, namely that of the Union, the Sun implies that citizenship of the Union is an alternative citizenship which cancels out national ones: but you'll really be a European citizen . B. You say : Tear up the Treaty14 While the lines were still open for the Sun's telephone 'referendum' on the Maastricht Treaty, the paper claimed to have taken another poll, this time interviewing passers-by personally and publishing some of their 'comments' in an article entitled You say : Tear up the Treaty. Eleven people are represented there, all of them 'ordinary' people whose name, age and occupation are given. Considering the Sun's polemics against the Treaty, it is hardly surprising that of the 11 statements quoted only two are in favour. Nor is it likely to be a coincidence that both Yes statements come from women, who, we may suspect, are regarded as less authoritative sources. Considerable effort is made to establish the interviewees as 'real' people and their comments as genuine. The photographs, personal details and the use of direct speech work together to create an impression of authenticity. That so much news space is devoted to non-elite persons is in itself remarkable, diverging as it does from newspapers' normal quoting prac- tices. If cabbie Brian Byrne and jobless Bob Marchman are allowed to have a say on a 'hard' political subject, this contravenes a general trend in the selection of news sources. As Bell (1991: 192) points out: "The more elite the source, the more newsworthy the story." If a paper - most likely one from the tabloid end of the range - departs from this ground rule, we may assume that it does so for a very good reason. The answer lies in a persuasive strategy which the analysis in Section A also found to have been applied in the question-and-answer piece on Maastricht. The basic principle is to introduce a persona into the discourse that authenticates the news coverage and that the reader can identify with (cf. Hartley, 1982: 90). In Text B identification is based on socio- psychological congruence between the personae and the readers (similar social and educational background, interests and value systems). In Text A 'discursive' solidarity is displayed through the use of colloquialisms, pro- nouns and other deictic elements. The persona for identification is partly vested in the lay 'questioner' and partly in the expert 'answerer'; after all, the latter, too, places himself in one group with his interlocutor by using we, us and our (11. 22f., 27, 29, 39, 56, 69, 73f.). The range of named individuals introduced in Text B ensures that there is 'something for everyone' (allow- ing for the social composition of the Sun's readership, of course). Yet three of the interviewees, identified somewhat vaguely as a director and two managers , are higher on the social scale than the Sun's average C2, D and E reader.15 Their role, presumably, is to couple the possibility of identifi- cation with the credibility attached to a more elite source.</page><page sequence="21">hardt-mautner: Becoming a good European 197 Another consequence of (and probably reason for) extensive 'verbatim' quoting is that it allows the editorial voice of the paper to step back behind the voice of the quoted persona. By yielding the floor completely to the man and woman in the street, the paper positions itself as a public forum of discussion rather than as a disseminator of editorial wisdom. In the case of Text B, the boundaries between representing and represented discourse are explicit and very clearly drawn (cf. Fairclough, 1992: 1 19). The introductory comments explaining and summarizing the poll are printed against a black background and are thus set off typographically from the eight direct quotations which follow and which are not embedded separately. The only editorial interference here is the summarizing Yes/No label to the left of the name and the personal details. The remaining three comments at the bottom, without photographs of those interviewed, are also quite clearly delineated through the use of quotation marks, though there is some "ambivalence of voice" (Fairclough, 1992: 108) in the subheadlines, which cannot be attributed unequivocally to the interviewees. Referring to the quotations as examples of 'direct' discourse represen- tation should only be taken to refer to their linguistic surface form, rather than as a statement on their faithfulness to the exact words used in the original speech event. There is abundant evidence that "no form of dis- course representation (including all forms of direct speech) can be said to reproduce or re-enact the anterior discourse" (Slembrouck, 1992b: 103). In the case of the Sun's street poll, the transformation from original statement to published quotation probably involved more than just a superficial editing process. Indeed we may want to go so far as to doubt whether any proper interviewing ever took place at all, and if so, whether any serious attempt was made to faithfully reproduce the anterior discourse. As Table 1 shows, there are certainly a number of suspicious parallels between these 11 people's comments and the journalist's answers in Text A, in some cases not just in terms of content, but even down to the actual choice of words. Note that the complaints about the lack of comprehension (11. 9f., 36f.) have been put into the mouths of a director and a manager respectively, presumably to assure the semi-skilled and unskilled workers making up most of the Sun's readership that their confusion over Maastricht is shared by their social betters. The specific advantage of direct quotation, from the paper's perspective, is that it allows further popularization of the issues covered by the Maas- tricht Treaty. Text A went some way to translating the Treaty into everyday language but the journalist's answers retained the authoritative voice of the well-informed expert (albeit from a reader-centred point of view). In Text B, the strategic pose of direct discourse representation harnesses the vox populi to the paper's ideological goals. Taken together, Texts A and B as well as the telephone referendum form a closed circuit of persuasion. Readers are encouraged to give their opinion, but not until the paper has supplied them with one (Text A); and in a second argumentative thrust two days later, confirmation from peer-groups is provided (Text B).

Such was William Davies's prediction, made with blithe (and of course satirical) optimism in 1971 , in 'conversation' with Aunt Bertha, who, judging by her reaction, was not convinced ( Guardian , 23 October 1971: 11). And even now that more than 20 years have elapsed, the British public, like Aunt Bertha, apparently still needs a lot of convincing. Taking a discourse analytic approach, the present paper has shown that</page><page sequence="23">hardt-mautner: Becoming a good European 199 major national newspapers, in particular the mass-circulation tabloid the Sun , have been increasing rather than reducing anti-European sentiment. It emerges that the development of a European identity in Britain is being hampered by three factors: (1) by a sense of distance and isolation from Continental Europe; (2) by fears that British national identity is under threat from continuing European integration; and (3) by prejudice against other European nations, particularly the French and the Germans. A further factor contributing to scepticism about Europe is the growing chasm between the discourse of elites actively shaping European politics and the lay discourse of the electorate. The Maastricht Treaty is a prime example. While arcane in content and language, it has been recognized even by the non-initiated as eventually having an impact on their lives. Banking on the public's bewilderment, the Sun has adopted the role of mediator, simplify- ing, reinterpreting and in fact grossly distorting the Treaty (a document which, incidentally, is itself full of the rhetoric of persuasion). The discursive practices of the press in the context of European inte- gration are no doubt a challenging object of study for the linguist but they would also be well worth some consideration on the part of policy-makers, who often seem so preoccupied with political and economic technicalities that they lose sight of the sociopsychological, and hence also linguistic, issues involved. From their perspective, too, a case can be made for taking Aunt Bertha's doubts seriously. APPENDIX i Text A: Transcript 1 What the hell is Maastricht about? 2 the Maastricht Treaty is too complex for most of us to understand, some 3 pompous MPs claim. That is one of the reasons the Government won't let you 4 vote on it in a referendum. 5 But is the treaty so difficult? The Sun has studied the 250-page document with 6 its 1,000-plus clauses. Here, chris davis presents the simple answers to 7 your questions . . . 8 Q what is the Maastricht Treaty about? 9 A It's a plan devised by France and Germany to tie the 12 European 10 Community countries closer together politically by 1999. In effect, it creates a 11 United States of Europe run from Brussels. 12 Q why is it called the Maastricht Treaty? 13 A Talks at which it was thrashed out were held in the Dutch town of 14 Maastricht last December. 15 Q whose idea was it? 16 A Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission - the officials who 17 do all the paperwork. His brainchild is a single European currency to make 18 trading easier. 19 A central bank would force countries to stick to common targets for 20 inflation, interest rates and public spending. 21 Q does it really matter if the treaty gets the go-ahead?</page><page sequence="24">200 DISCOURSE &amp; SOCIETY ^ J w -SP O o* m 3 w îi ì MÏ ?«J £ lyiipi *• s-= M u -¡'y ;s4| ?«J :3ti?|f¡rS|! tfí'P *• » ihi'û u JiffUM f sfli,«!! sfilt« ^Î!ijt3 S iíi"8 ^ g»sl^^|s5_!: 5{¡jhCMC«&gt;« o Ni!|*j §í 5 ® ®2 2 ¿5 != ^ 5{¡jhCMC«&gt;« o §í 5 ® P ®2 2 ¿5 o « ř 55 a ■ ® a -S *]&gt; ^ !» J^i»^ 5{¡jhCMC«&gt;« - o §í 5 ® P ®2 2 ¿5 o « töüfji ř 55 a ■ ® a Ž NN ftrf 3ÎS8®?&lt;&amp;S5S MM'tëi S ¿®&lt;e*á Lůhi - S» öSSötSSSü lil NN 3ÎS8®?&lt;&amp;S5S S ¿®&lt;e*á öSSötSSSü OKŽSssšJ.* ■5 I SSS8 **« lil 2 ÉŠ£? ì%n li !|£|í|ll S ||Õá LS iiž» SSS8 ř|li **« iL* «M ligi i ïsB:3»is: « i l LS ' C IS iiž» sîî" ř|li Hi «M ^l-ř%I? ligi s i ïsB:3»is: nHês" ■ « ffeí i i C sí'í ¡tú . li!

It would change the way our country is run. We would have less 23 control over our economy, less say in what laws we can pass and we would 24 hand more power to unelected Brussels bureaucrats. 25 Q if Maastricht is a dead duck, does that mean the end of the Common 26 Market? 27 A Not at all. We will still be able to trade freely with other European 28 countries. From January next year a new law called the Single European Act 29 comes into force to chop down trade barriers and make it easier for us to sell 30 our goods abroad. 31 Customs formalities between EC countries will end and you won't need a 32 passport to travel within Europe. 33 Q what would happen to the Pound under Maastricht? 34 A It would be replaced by a single currency that could be spent in every 35 country in Europe - although Britain has won the right to wait until 1996 36 until it makes up its mind on this issue. 37 Q how would it affect our economy? 38 A We would lose a lot of control over raising taxes. A central European bank 39 would make most decisions for us, setting interest rates and imposing credit 40 squeezes to try to creat [sic] an efficient, low-inflation economy. 41 Q would Maastricht make me better off? 42 A Not unless you live in a powerhouse economy like Germany or France. They 43 would flourish while second-division countries like Britain, Italy and Spain 44 struggled. 45 Q would it mean more jobs? 46 A Yes ... if you live in Brussels, where all the penpushers would be based. In 47 reality, most new jobs would be created in Germany. 48 The central bank would squeeze inflation out of countries like Britain by 49 imposing higher taxes and creating more unemployment. 50 Q who pays for all the changes Maastricht would bring about? 51 A Britain would, along with Germany, France and Holland. Poorer countries 52 like Ireland, Spain and Greece take billions more out of the kitty than they put 53 in. Delors wants to set up a fund to channel rich countries' money to the 54 poorer nations. 55 Q will we still be British citizens? 56 A You'll still be British but you'll really be a European citizen. We've already 57 got those new red EC passports. Under Maastricht, people would be able to 58 vote in elections in whichever member country they chose to live in. 59 Q How would Maastricht affect Britain's foreign and defence policies? 60 A It aims to bring in a common foreign and security policy so that Europe 61 would act together over issues like the war in Yugoslavia and sanctions 62 against Iraq. 63 It could mean Britain would not be able to stage another Falklands-style 64 campaign. 65 Q What about immigration? 66 A The Germans are worried about that. The treaty means Brussels would 67 dictate who is allowed into the 12 European countries. 68 If Britain decided, for example, it did not want to take in 50,000 Bosnian 69 refugees we could be over-ruled by the Council of Ministers. Once foreigners 70 were given visas to stay in an EC country, they would be free to move to 71 another without that country being able to stop them.</page><page sequence="26">202 DISCOURSE &amp; SOCIETY ■* NO ' NO 41. dina« "U'&lt; British inT _ Ytj inunoa d*k ■* , manf I AM pro-Europe but °' British and PTOUd _ I think If you're problems ÏL J.*. , J?"1.!!?- than m¡5Í It*» the way this has °' ^ ^ going Into Europe problems than It*» been handled Is an against handing you've got to go all worth.

(Sun, 22 September 1992: 6; capitalization as in the original) Text B: Transcript 1 You say: Tear up the Treaty16 2 Britain should tear up the Maastricht Treaty and go it alone, according to a 3 Sun poll taken yesterday. We questioned a cross-section of people from street 4 traders to managing directors. In our sample of passers-by 90 per cent were 5 against the Treaty. They wanted to ditch it and start again. Here are some of 6 the comments. 7 no David Thomas, 41, director 8 i am pro-Europe but the way this has been handled is an insult to the British 9 public. I don't think anyone properly understands what the Treaty means for 10 us. The government should have explained in simple terms. 11 no Jason Gingell, 24, driver 12 i'm British and proud of it - and I'm dead set against handing over power to 13 the bureaucrats in Brussels. I am also against giving up sterling. I don't think 14 I could ever get used to this new, single currency. 15 yes Sue Butler, 20, insurance clerk 16 I think if you're going into Europe you've got to go all the way. We should stop 17 chickening out and go for it. It will mean that if this country gets into trouble 18 there will always be someone there to help us out. 19 no Les Dunbar, 52, manager 20 it is causing more problems than it's worth. You cannot force countries 21 together artificially. We have different culture, language and currency. I'm not 22 opposed to economic union but Maastricht goes beyond that. 23 yes Derbra Webb, 26, bar maid 24 i think we should become involved. The more we are part of a large 25 community, the better it will be. We are scared someone will take our British 26 culture but instead we should be learning from other countries. 27 no Tony Allen, 27, RAF supplier 28 we've always been with America and we've always been independent. We 29 should stay that way. Germany is already dictating monetary policy, and that 30 bothers me - especially as we are in the second division. 31 no Diana Cottrell, 25, recruiter 32 the economy would be my main worry if we stuck with Maastricht. I think 33 we will lose our identity and power to choose if we are too closely linked to 34 other countries. Britain will be pulled into things it does not want to do. 35 no Robin Stainer, 43, manager 36 no one has bothered to explain this and I don't think anyone really knows 37 what it's about. I think there should be a national vote. But you cannot expect 38 people to make a decision without being properly informed. 39 Let's stay in control 40 jobless Bob Marchman, 43, is against Maastricht.

Britain has struggled before and pulled herself back up. But we 43 will have no control over a single currency". 44 HERITAGE IS SACRED 45 street trader Clinton Johnson, 24, sells souvenirs by the Tower of London. 46 He is against the Treaty "because this country's heritage is sacred. If we have 47 a load of laws coming in from Brussels that heritage will be whittled away. 48 We'll be told the Union Jack is anti-European". 49 We're not European 50 cabbie Brian Byrne, 45, of Moston, Manchester, is a No. He said: "I don't 51 regard myself as European and I am against handing power to bureaucrats. 52 The Treaty would create jobs for continentals, not us.
