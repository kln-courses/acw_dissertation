Both Baudelaire's "A une passante" and Roland Barthes's Camera Lucida are motivated by an impossible address to a female figure who has, as we say, "passed away." Baudelaire's sonnet "A une passante" is a lyric poem addressed to the figure of a woman who, having already "passed," cannot be present to receive the poem's address. Camera Lucida, Barthes's "note" on the ontology of photography, is centered and decentered by his attempt to speak about the death of his mother through a reflection on a photograph of her and on photography more generally. In both texts, the attempt to be present to a passing through the activity of mourning opens up the problem of how to represent history. The deaths that precede these two works are figured not by a passage, but rather by a ghostly, perpetually repeated and even mechanical "passing": the activity of passing is repeated to the point of immobility, and history is represented as "cliche." But before we look at these two works directly, we shall begin by looking at how Walter Benjamin sees the representation of history in "A une passante." By examining the traces of a "hidden figure" in Benjamin's reading of "A une passante," read through a series of relayed looks, we shall find that Benjamin uncovers a figure of history buried in this poem. The Widow One should not read Walter Benjamin's writings on Baudelaire without being startled by his reading of the sonnet "A une passante." His presentation of the poem occupies a pivotal position in the 1938 essay "The Paris of the Second Empire" as well as in the 1939 revision "Some Motifs in Baudelaire." In both essays, "A une passante" is the only poem from Lesfleurs du mal that Benjamin quotes in its entirety. But although he reproduces the entire poem in both texts, his discussion of it concentrates primarily on a figure that the poem never directly names or represents. In order to understand what is at stake in his reading of this poem, as well as why it remains the cornerstone of all of his work on Baudelaire, we must begin by understanding that Benjamin's reading strategy is inextri- cable from the conclusions it enables him to reach. As Benjamin insists incessantly, "A une passante" must be read as a negative image, in relief, as it were, through the absence of its central figure-the crowd. In "Some Motifs in Baudelaire" he introduces the poem by claiming that "the masses had become so much a part of Baudelaire that it is rare to find a description of them in his works. His most important subjects are hardly ever encountered in descriptive form" [122]. To say that Benjamin reads the poem "as a negative image" is to claim that his specificity as both reader and thinker must be traced through this peculiar insistence on traces of absent figures. As the example of the crowd illustrates, Benjamin often bases his exegesis of Baudelaire by pointing out, with I would like to thank Tom Keenanfor his generous 'first reading " of this essay. diacritics 22.3-4: 128-44 128</page><page sequence="3">remarkable precision, the importance of specific details that Baudelaire leaves out of his poems.' Like the ancient prophets who attempted to read the future in the entrails of certain animals, Benjamin reads "modernity" in the traces of poetic history that Baudelaire leaves in his wake. In the "Motifs" essay he writes: "This crowd, of whose existence Baudelaire is always aware, has not served as the model for any of his works, but is imprinted on his creativity as a hidden figure [als verborgene Figur eingeprdgt]" [120]. By tracking the imprints of a "hidden figure" in Benjamin's reading of "A une passante," we shall be able to read traces of a conception of the relationship among allegory, modernity and history that Benjamin might have made more explicit had he lived to complete the Passagen-Werk project. Why, we might begin by asking, does Benjamin insist on reading this particular poem as a medium for his presentation of the motif of the crowd? As he himself points out, "In the sonnet 'A une passante' the crowd is nowhere named in either word or phrase. And yet the whole happening hinges on it, just as the progress of a sailing-boat depends on the wind" ["Motifs" 124]. Through his analogy, Benjamin implies that the action depicted in the poem, like the progress of the ship to which he compares it, is primarily a medium for rendering visible an ineffable force that motivates it. Without a ship's sail, one can neither see the wind nor measure its velocity. For Benjamin, the action of the poem, like the sailboat's "progress," is read in its resistance to the force of the crowd through which the passing figure passes. Instead of focusing on the figure of the passing woman, he looks at the force (the mass of the crowd) through which her passage can be marked. By looking past her to the crowd, Benjamin turns our attention to what must have been passing around her and hence "present" to the eyes of the one who watches her. He goes on to discuss how the erotic encounter between the passing woman and the one who watches her is facilitated, rather than hindered, by the force of the crowd. It is the presence of the crowd itself that engenders this experience of moder love. In "Motifs" he writes: "The delight of the urban poet is love-not at first sight, but at last sight. It is a farewell forever which coincides in the poem with the moment of enchantment. Thus the sonnet supplies the figure of shock, even of catastrophe... like the kind of sexual shock that can beset a lonely man" [125]. Throughout his reading, Benjamin is consistently less concerned with the figure of the passing woman than with the impact that her passage produces on the one who watches her. For him, the force of the erotic encounter, as well as the poem it produces, can be read only in the aftershock of that encounter. His reading relies upon a dual structure of delayed action and relayed looks-Benjamin looks at the imprint of the wake of her passage reflected in the eyes of the one who watched her pass. But it is curious that Benjamin appears to bypass the description of the passing woman almost altogether. While he does point out that she is in mourning (and we will return to this point in some detail later), he never refers to the poem's descriptions of her movement "Agile et noble, avec sajambe de statue,"2 or, even more surprisingly, to the fact that the final two tercets of the poem are, however impossibly, addressed to her. In his belated address to her (she is gone before he starts to speak), the poet calls out to the 1. In Passagen-Werk, for example, he notes that "Just as in 'A une passante, 'the crowd was neither named nor described, in 'Le jeu,' the instruments of the gambling don't come up" ["J" 87a.6], and "In relation to the 'la rue assourdissante' and related formulations, one should not forget that the road surface at that time was, most frequently, cobblestones" ["J" 82a.8]. All references to Passagen-Werk comefrom GS, vol. 1, and, except where indicated, allfragments have been translated by me with the help of Eric Marder. 2. The phrase "sa jambe de statue, " read along with the phrase 'fugitive beaute," clearly evokes a relationship between the 'fleeting beauty " in "A une passante " and the allegoricalfigure of Beauty in the poem "La beaute": "Je suis belle, 6 mortels, comme un reve de pierre...." For the purposes of this essay, however, Ipropose to demonstrate that Benjamin has a very precise stake in choosing not to acknowledge the relationship between these two poems. diacritics / fall-winter 1992 129</page><page sequence="4">woman by calling her by the name of "fugitive beaute." Why does Benjamin choose not to comment on the obvious echoes between the invocation of a "fleeting beauty" in the poem and Baudelaire's definition of modernity as "fleeting beauty" in "The Painter of Modem Life"? Not only does Benjamin know the essay extremely well (he quotes from it constantly), but he uses that very essay as the foundation for his discussions of the flaneur, the crowd, and Poe's story "The Man of the Crowd" in both of his own essays on Baudelaire. We can only assume (and this assumption will be borne out by what follows) that Benjamin's silence concerning the figure of the "fleeting beauty" in the poem marks the site of a trace of a reading of Baudelaire's definition of modernity. By choosing to focus on this particular poem and by refusing to present it according to the paradigms that would be familiar to any reader of Baudelaire's discussion of modernity, Benjamin effectively preempts a reading that would claim that "A une passante" should be read as a poetic incarnation of Baudelaire's definition of modernity. The hidden figures embedded in Benjamin's reading of "A une passante" will allow us to read how, instead of relying on this poem in order to demonstrate Baudelaire's definition of modernity, Benjamin uses this poem precisely in order to challenge it. In the 1938 essay "The Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire," Benjamin launches a direct attack on Baudelaire's definition of modernity in "The Painter of Modem Life." But the precise logic of this attack is so opaque that it provokes a critic as astute as Hans Robert Jauss to accuse Benjamin of a "violent" misreading of Baudelaire. Jauss begins his essay "Reflections on the Chapter 'Modernity' in Benjamin's Baudelaire Fragments" with the bold assertion that "It is paradoxical that Baudelaire's theory of modernity should have been misunderstood by the very critic whose work has done the most to propel us toward a new understanding of that poet" [176]. While it would be impossible to enter into the specifics of Jauss' s argument without presenting a systematic analysis of the Baudelaire essay in relation to both Jauss and Benjamin, and while I believe that Jauss is wrong in his assessment that Benjamin "misunderstood" Baudelaire' s theory of modernity, I point to Jauss's claim in order to stress the fact that Benjamin's argument is anything but self-evident. In the section entitled "Modernism" in "The Paris of the Second Empire," Benjamin quotes and glosses Baudelaire's definition of modernity: And in thefinal passage of his essay on Guys he says: "Everywhere he sought the transitory, fleeting beauty of our present life, the character of what the reader has permitted us to call modernism." In summary form, his doctrine reads asfollows: "A constant, unchangeable element... and a relative, limited element cooperates to produce beauty.... The latter element is supplied by the epoch, by fashion, by morality and the passions. Without this second element. .. the first would not be assimilable. " One can hardly say that this is a profound analysis [Man kann nicht sagen, dass das in die Tiefe geht]. In Baudelaire's view of modernism, the theory of modern art is the weakest point.... None of the aesthetic reflections in Baudelaire's theory of art presented modernism in its interpenetration [Durchdringung] with classical antiquity, something that was done in certain poems of the Fleurs du mal. [82] It is rare, to say the least, to find Benjamin passing judgment on Baudelaire' s thinking with a one-line verdict like "this is not a profound analysis." It is equally rare to find Benjamin abdicating the position of Baudelaire' s ideal reader; when Baudelaire invokes the reader' s permission to call the "transitory, fleeting beauty of our present life . . . modernism," Benjamin refuses to accord him that permission. In short, it would seem that Benjamin accuses Baudelaire-the-theorist of having a superficial appreciation of Baudelaire-the- poet's articulation of modernity. Benjamin's dissatisfaction would seem to lie in the way in which Baudelaire isolates the "constant, unchangeable element" from the "transitory, 130</page><page sequence="5">fleeting...element supplied by the epoch." For Benjamin, these two elements can never be understood as discrete entities-each element exists only in relation to the other-in the structure of what he calls here Durchdringung. By understanding Durchdringung as a forceful permeation, we understand that modernism exists for Benjamin only to the degree that it is thoroughly stamped with the marks of classical antiquity. In the next paragraph, Benjamin explains that the more precise name for this penetrating process is allegory. He writes: Among these the poem "Le Cygne" ["The Swan"] is paramount. It is no accident that it is an allegory. The city which is in constant flux grows rigid. It becomes as brittle and as transparent as glass-that is, as far as its meaning is concerned-"The form of a city, alas, changes more quickly than a mortal's heart. " ... The stature of Paris is fragile; it is surrounded by symbols of fragility-living creatures (the negress and the swan) and historical figures (Andromache, "widow of Hector and wife ofHelenus "). Their common feature is sadness about what was and lack of hope for what is to come. In the final analysis, this decrepitude [Hinfalligkeit] constitutes the closest connection between modernism and antiquity. Whenever Paris occurs in the Fleurs du mal, it bears the signs of this decrepitude. [82-83] In the 1935 "expose," "Paris-Capital of the Nineteenth Century," in letters to Horkheimer, Scholem, and Adorno, and in numerous fragments of Passagen-Werk, Benjamin reiter- ates that his interest in Baudelaire is first and foremost motivated by Baudelaire's distinctive use of classical allegory in his depiction of modernity. In the 1935 expose, the chapter on Baudelaire bears the epigraph "Tout pour moi devient allegorie" ("Everything for me becomes allegory") from "Le cygne," and in the first sentence of the expose, Benjamin writes: "Baudelaire's genius, which drew its nourishment from melancholy, was an allegorical one" [170]. In a letter to Horkheimer dated 16 April 1938, he describes his project on Baudelaire: The work should have three parts. Their projected titles are: idea and image; antique and modern; the new and the always same. Thefirst part will show the determining significance of allegory in the Fleurs du mal.... The second part develops the blinding over-exposure of the allegorical way of seeing [der allegorischen Anschauung die Uberblendung] as a formal element, by virtue of which the antique appears in the modern and the modern in the antique. [Briefe 751] Moreover, it was precisely in relation to the question of allegory that Benjamin claimed that Baudelaire had been consistently misread. In Passagen-Werk he notes: "Baudelaire' s allegorical way of looking at things was not understood by any of his contemporaries and, consequently, ultimately failed to be noticed altogether" ["J" 61.3; GS 1: 426]. Keeping these examples in mind, we can now understand that Benjamin's critique of Baudelaire's definition of modernity in "The Painter of Moder Life" is primarily concerned with the absence of an articulation of the role of allegory. Benjamin's systematic invocation of the poem "Le cygne" as the privileged example of allegory in Baudelaire is not based, as one might expect, on the fact that the word allegory appears in the poem. For Benjamin, the allegorical quality of the poem resides in the poem's depiction of the city. As he remarks in his discussion of "Le cygne," the city "becomes as brittle and as transparent as glass.... The stature of Paris is fragile; it is surrounded by symbols of fragility-living creatures (the negress and the swan) and historical figures (Andromache, 'widow of Hector and wife of Helenus')." The invisible diacritics / fall-winter 1992 131</page><page sequence="6">but overpowering presence of the ruins of Troy in the poem shatters the newly built city of Paris at the level of its mythic foundation.3 The image of the modem city is superimposed on the rubble of the ancient one-thus the modernity of the new city must be read through the figure of its past and future decrepitude. In a fragment from Passagen- Werk, Benjamin revises Baudelaire's definition of modernity by invoking the figure of "ruins" to collapse Baudelaire's distinction between a "constant, unchanging element" and a "fleeting, transitory" element. He writes: "The experience of allegory, which holds onto ruins, is, actually, that of the eternally transitory" ["J" 67.4; GS 1: 439]. Benjamin reads Baudelaire's allegory to show that history is the site not of solid foundations but of ruins-it is no less fleeting than modernity. History is as fleeting as a bad dream that never fails to recur, and allegory is the form that the bad dream takes. In Passagen-Werk he writes: "Modernity has antiquity like one has a demon, which came over it in sleep" ["J" 82a.4; GS 1: 470]. While we have shown how Benjamin invokes "Le cygne" to prove that Baudelaire's poetic use of allegory challenges his own definition of modernity in "The Painter of Moder Life," how does Benjamin's discussion of allegory and modernity in "Le cygne" relate to our initial question concerning the "hidden figure" in Benjamin's reading of "A une passante" in "Motifs"? Moreover, given Benjamin's repeated claims (in the 1935 expose, in Passagen-Werk, in the letters, and in the 1938 essay "The Paris of the Second Empire") that Baudelaire' s use of allegory is the determining factor in his poetic depiction of modernity, why, in "Motifs," does Benjamin make no explicit reference either to allegory or to the poem that can be read as its insignia-"Le cygne?" The most obvious explanation for this omission is, of course, that the 1939 "Motifs" essay was conceived as a revision of only the "Flaneur" portion of the 1938 "Second Empire" essay: the passages we examined from the "Modernity" portion of the earlier essay were never intended to be part of the "Motifs" revision. There is, nonetheless, one tiny but significant trace of Benjamin's discussion of allegory, modernity, and history that emerges in his presentation of the "passante" poem in "Motifs." As I stated at the outset, "A une passante" is the only poem from Lesfleurs du mal that Benjamin quotes in its entirety in both "Second Empire" and "Motifs." In both essays, Benjamin presents the poem in order to introduce a discussion of the hidden figure of the crowd. By adding one significant detail to his reading of the poem in "Motifs," Benjamin directs us to read "A une passante" through his reading of"Le cygne." In the opening lines of his analysis of "A une passante" in "Second Empire," he writes: "This sonnet presents the crowd not as the refuge of a criminal but as that of love which eludes the poet. One may say that it deals with the function of the crowd not in the life of the citizen, but in the life of the erotic person" [45]. But in "Motifs," he adds: In a widow's veil, mysteriously and mutely borne along by the crowd, an unknown woman comes into the poet's field of vision. What the sonnet communicates is simply this: far from experiencing the crowd as an opposed, 3. Iam glossing some of the issues that Susan Buck-Morss discusses in her chapter "Historical Nature: Ruin" in The Dialectics of Seeing [159-201]. Although I certainly agree with her statement that "In the Arcades project Benjamin himselfpracticed allegory against myth, " I am not entirely convinced by her conclusion that "he was aware of its 'regressive tendency'" [201]. Or, to be more precise, I am not sure that Buck-Morss and I would agree about how to read the status of the "regression " to which she alludes. In any case, the passages she cites about the relationship between allegory and ruins, as well as her own discussion of the status of the ruins in "Le cygne, " are both useful and illuminating. Among the importantfragments that she translates in this chapter is one in which Benjamin writes: "If Baudelaire did notfall into the abyss of myth that constantly accompanied his path, it was thanks to the genius of allegory" [ "J" 22.5; qtd. in Buck-Morss 182]. Fragments from Passagen-Werk taken from Buck-Morss are her translations. 132</page><page sequence="7">antagonistic element, this very crowd brings to the city dweller thefigure that fascinates. [125; my emphasis] Benjamin' s invocation of the word widow is surprising because while the poem does refer to the fact that the passing woman is in mourning ("en grand deuil"), there is nothing in the poem to indicate that the mourning woman is a widow. In fact, one of the most compelling aspects of the poem lies in the fact that the passing woman mourns a death that is itself shrouded in mystery. Why does Benjamin, who is the very epitome of the meticulous reader and who had previously referred to the "passante" as "a female apparition in mourning" ["Second Empire" 46], now decide to give a name to the source of her mourning? There are at least two ways of explaining why Benjamin might have wanted to force us to read the mourning woman as a widow. The more simple explanation would be to recall that Benjamin reads the erotic encounter depicted in the poem as an encounter characterized by loss. He argues that the poem speaks not of love at first sight but rather of "love at last sight." For Benjamin, "A une passante" is not merely a poem about love, but rather a poem about looking for love in all the wrong places (the street) and about losing it in the very moment it has been found. In Passagen-Werk, he repeatedly comments on the fact that Baudelaire modernizes the lyric by suffusing the love poem with images of sexual perversion.4 By claiming that the mourning woman is a widow, he suggests that the erotic loss narrated in the poem was already figured in the widow' s prior loss of her husband. The figure of the "lost husband" would thus stand as a synecdoche for the specifically erotic nature of the loss, as opposed to the loss of a noneroticized figure. But another explanation for Benjamin's decision to cast the mourning woman in the role of a widow brings us back to our discussion of the relationship between antiquity and modernity in "Le cygne." Because while there is no explicit mention of a widow in "A une passante," in "Le cygne," the apostrophe to the widow, Andromache, constitutes the poetic source of the poem.5 The entire poem emerges out of reflections cast in the stream of the widow's tears: Andromaque, je pense a vous! Ce petit fleuve, Pauvre et triste miroir ou jadis resplendit L'immense majeste de vos douleurs de veuve, Ce Simois menteur qui par vos pleurs grandit, Afeconde soudain ma memoire fertile ... [85] [Andromache, I think of you! This small river, Sad and meager mirror where long ago, The boundless majesty of your widow's grief glittered, This lying Simois, which swelled with your tears, Has quickened my memory .. .] [my translation] 4. As in thefollowingfragment: "Baudelaire introduces thefigure of sexualperversion, which looks for its objects in the street, into the lyric. But what is characteristic is that he does so in a line like 'crispe comme un extravagant' fromone of his most successful love poems, 'A une passante'" ["J" 21a.4]. It might be useful to remember, however, that the enormous importance Benjamin accords to the figure of the lesbian in Baudelaire does not fall under the rubric of "sexual perversion, " but rather the lesbian incarnates the figure of the "heroine of modernism " [90]. For Benjamin's discussion of the lesbian in Baudelaire, see "Second Empire" [90-94]. 5. One might want to read the poetic "source" ("ce petit fleuve") depicted in "Le cygne" in relation to Samuel Weber's discussion of the "source" ("Quellpunkt") of poetry in his essay "Mediauras. " diacritics / fall-winter 1992 133</page><page sequence="8">Read through the widow's veil, Benjamin encourages us to read "A une passante" as a palimpsest superimposed upon the ancient ruins of "Le cygne." The bustling streets depicted in the first poem are haunted by the rubble of Troy invoked in the second one. Seen in this light, "A une passante" presents a vision of modernity that is permeated by the decay of history. In both poems, the city becomes visible only when it is seen through the veil of a mourning woman. Through the widow's veil, Benjamin invites us to read the stasis of modernity across the transitory flight of history. In Passagen-Werk, Benjamin defines the figure of the crowd as an allegory of modernity and the figure of the city as an allegory of antiquity: "In Baudelaire, Paris stands as an emblem of antiquity, in contrast to his crowd, as emblem of the modern" ["J" 66a.2; GS 1: 437]. But, as our reading of Benjamin's reading of "A une passante" demonstrates, there is no simple historical progressionfrom antiquity to modernity-they are frozen together in the form of a kind of static repetition. Instead of presenting history in terms of a fluid passage, Benjamin conceives of Baudelaire's depiction of history in architectural terms: history is seen as the rigid scaffold which binds allegorical antiquity to modernity. In one of the most opaque fragments of Passagen-Werk, Benjamin suggests that this construction of history can be understood only nondialectically: The correspondence between antiquity and modernity is the only constructive conception of history in Baudelaire. Through its rigid armature, it excluded every dialectical one [Die Korrespondenz zwischen Antike und Modere ist die einzige konstruktive Geschichtkonzeption bei Baudelaire. Durch ihre starre Armatur schloss sie jede dialektische aus]. ["J" 59a.5; GS 1: 423] If we recall Benjamin' s discussion of the function of allegory in "Le cygne," we remember that, for Benjamin, history becomes visible when modernity is petrified by antiquity: "The city which is in constant flux grows rigid. It becomes as brittle and as transparent as glass." The very rigidity of this structure renders it both brittle and fragile. If history cannot be conceived of in dialectical terms here, it is because the petrification process cancels out the possibility of movement. Rather than appearing as the movement through which progress can be marked, this historical construction recalls the ossification of ruins. And it is no accident that the widow is the privileged witness to this model of history. The death that she mourns is, as Barthes will later say of the photograph, nondialectical; it is as irrevocable and static as the image of history that appears refracted through her veil. The Widow's Veil and the Photographic Cliche In a letter dated 2 August 1935, written in response to the 1935 draft of the expose for the Arcades Project, Theodor Adorno writes to Walter Benjamin: "I find the passage about the crowd as a veil wonderful." In that early text (which makes no mention of "A une Passante"), Benjamin had written: "The crowd was the veil from behind which the familiar city as phantasmagoria beckoned to the flaneur " [170]. Given his later reproach that Benjamin's "Second Empire" suffered from an excess of "immediate... material- ism" compounded by the absence of a mediating theory,6 it is not surprising that Adorno should have particularly appreciated the figure of the crowd as veil. In "Motifs," Benjamin introduces Baudelaire's view of the crowd through the figure of the veil. He writes: "The mass was the agitated veil; through it Baudelaire saw Paris" [123]. In attributing the figure of the veil to Baudelaire, instead of to the flaneur, Benjamin links 6. See the infamous letter dated 10 November 1938, reprinted in Aesthetics and Politics [New York: Verso, 1977] 126-33. 134</page><page sequence="9">this veiled vision to the experience of shock. At the end of "Motifs," he argues that while the flaneur is seduced and "bedazzled" by the "luster of the crowd," Baudelaire "was no flaneur"; he "singled out his having been jostled by the crowd as the decisive, unique experience. . . . This is the nature of something lived through [Erlebnis] to which Baudelaire has given the weight of an experience [Erfahrung]" [154]. Paradoxically, the figure of the veil illuminates rather than filters the shock of experience. But the figure of the veil also serves as the medium through which Benjamin links the structure of repetition and relayed looks in "A une passante" to Baudelaire's place in literary history. In "A une passante," the veil-the mark of death that separates the face of the woman from the look of the other-becomes the bearer of a relayed reflection of everything that passes around it. The mourner' s veil functions like a mechanical mirror- or photographic apparatus-that turns our gaze away from the (perhaps nonexistent) face of the woman and back onto the amorphous crowd which is "present" all around her. It is by gazing at the veil that the "present" is represented. Through her veil, which is itself the mark of a prior passage, we can see that which could never otherwise be seen: the experience of the present. Benjamin addresses the historical figure of Baudelaire in terms that recall those employed by the narrator of "A une passante" in his address to the figure of the passing woman. "Motifs" attempts to speak about the historical passing of lyric poetry by staging an encounter with Baudelaire, whom Benjamin calls the last lyric poet. In the final section of the essay, Benjamin enumerates the factors that contribute to Baudelaire's privileged position in relation to both lyric poetry and history. He writes: Les Fleurs du mal was the last lyric work that had a European repercussion; no later work penetrated beyond a more or less limited linguistic area ..., it cannot be denied that some of his lyric motifs-and the present study has dealt with them-render the possibility of lyric poetry questionable. These .. facts define Baudelaire historically. They show that he imperturbably stuck to his cause and single-mindedly concentrated on his mission. He went so far as to proclaim his goal "the creation of a cliche. " [152] Benjamin's essay both begins and ends with this reiteration, that Baudelaire was the "last lyric poet." But because Baudelaire is the last lyric poet, he is not merely historicized within the context of lyric poetry; he speaks of and to the problem of history in a different light. One might even say that Benjamin's essay is nothing other than an attempt to develop (like one develops a photograph) an image of history that he finds reflected in the relayed gaze of the figure of its last lyric poet.7 Benjamin reads the passing of lyric poetry by looking through the veil of Baudelaire' s experience of the city and the crowd. But to be the "last lyric poet" is precisely to be the first lyric poet after the last lyric poet: Baudelaire cannot simply be the "last lyric poet," because that position would imply the possibility that lyric poetry is still "present" in Baudelaire, a claim that Benjamin disputes when he writes that "some of his lyric motifs . . . render the possibility of lyric poetry questionable." Instead of being the last lyric poet, Baudelaire becomes lyric poetry's first simulacrum-its first stuttering ghost. It is at this juncture that we can begin to understand why Benjamin ends his essay by insisting that Baudelaire proclaimed his goal to be the "creation of a clichd." But what does cliche literally mean, and where does it come from? The word that is translated in 7. One fragment is particularly evocative: "The past has left images of itself in literary texts that are comparable to those which light imprints on a photosensitive plate. Only the future possesses developers active enough to bring these plates outperfectly " [ "N" 15a. 1; GS 5: 603; qtd. in Buck-Morss 250]. diacritics / fall-winter 1992 135</page><page sequence="10">j::: :: ::r:::- ::::ii - j i i: : II ib t- i`::;:: ::: i i! x2: t :::: :::: - ::-:( :::-i::::-::ii ::::::?:::I:- _ _--::. --:-- ::iiii- i : :::: i?i-i:i,iiiii-i::li""""""""" -::::::::-:- ::::: :':':;::'::: ::?-:::::::: ::I:I-:?::::::::::: ::::-::::::i': : i::i:::: i:iii-ii,iili:i'i:ii::i:i-li:i iii:i:i:;i:i-i:ili:iiiiirii.i--:-:</page><page sequence="11">English as cliche appears as the wordponcifin Baudelaire's original French text.8 While the connotations of poncif are almost identical to those of the English word cliche, poncif has a very long history (Le petit Robert gives it the date 1551), whereas cliche (imported from French into English) relates directly to the technological advances (the printing press) and inventions (photography) of the nineteenth century.9 But unlike the English word stencil (which is what a poncif is), poncif carries the connotation of a piece of work that lacks all originality. That Benjamin should have placed so great an emphasis on Baudelaire's characteristically perverse desire to "create a cliche" is a testimony to Benjamin's insight into Baudelaire's position in literary history. The implications of Benjamin's claim that Baudelaire "went so far as to proclaim his goal 'the creation of a cliche"' are further complicated by a look at this passage in the German text. The German text reads: "Unbeirrbar war Baudelaire im Bewusstsein seiner Aufgabe. Das geht so weit, dass er als sein Ziel 'eine Schablone zu kreieren' bezeichnet hat" ["Motive," GS 1: 651 ]. There are two remarks to be made here. It is interesting that the word Benjamin uses to express mission isAufgabe: Aufgabe immediately invokes the task of "Task of the Translator." And, more important for this analysis, Benjamin uses the word Schablone as a translation of poncif. In a letter dated 2 August 1935, Adorno writes: "Incidentally, the idea of an early history of the feuilleton, about which so much is contained in your essay on Kraus, is most fascinating.... In this connection an old journalistic term occurs to me: (Schablonstil) [cliche style], whose origin ought to be investigated" [116]. Paradoxically, the history of the English word cliche may tell us more about Benjamin's understanding of history than the history of either poncif or Schablone. The English word has itself become a clich--meaning that it has been reproduced and reiterated (keeping its French voice as it passes into English) to the point where the traces of its material history have been effaced. But embedded in the history of this word is a condensed history of the evolution of mechanical reproduction. The word cliche first emerges at the outset of the nineteenth century, and its meaning evolves throughout the nineteenth century and into the beginning of the twentieth century. Le petit Robert informs us that cliche first appeared around 1809 and was initially used in the context of typography.'? In 1865 (eight years after the first publication of Les fleurs du mal and corresponding with the growth and emergence of photography) a new definition ap- peared: "negative image. See negative." The word negative presumably denotes a photographic negative-the inverted image through which we are able to make endless "positive" copies. Finally, in 1869 (according to the dubious chronology of the dictionary) we find that cliche finally assumed the definition through which we know it today: "Figurative and pejorative. An idea or expression that is used too often. A banality, a lieu commun." What we find buried in the history of cliche is a certain passage from the mechanical reproduction of letters to that of photographs coupled with an emphasis upon an image that is cast in relief-what I have previously referred to as a "negative image." It is this model of cliche, in which we find the notion of mechanical reproduction linked to that of a negative image, that determines both Benjamin's reading of Baudelaire and his articulation of history. Like the frozen passage between modernity and antiquity 8. In "Fusees " Baudelaire writes: "creer un poncif c'est le genie. Je dois creer un poncif" [662]. 9. Le petit Robert defines poncif as a "Feuille de papier a dessin pique ... pour reproduire le contour du dessin [A piece ofpaperperforated with a design... for the purposes of reproducing the contours of the design]." 10. The original meaning of the word cliche related to the mechanical reproduction of letters on a page. Le petit Robert gives its definition as a "plaque portant en relief la reproduction d'une page de composition, d'une image, etpermettant le tirage de nombruex exemplaires. " To simplify matters, I have translated all further French definitions from Le petit Robert into English. diacritics / fall-winter 1992 137</page><page sequence="12">that we found embedded in Benjamin's reading of "A une passante," cliche condenses the history of the development of mechanical reproduction and freezes the representation of that history into the rigid scaffold of a single imprinted word. Furthermore, the activity of that freezing process is precisely that of the photographic "click." As Benjamin writes in "Motifs": "Of the countless movements of switching, inserting, pressing, and the like, the "snapping" of the photographer has had the greatest consequences. A touch of the finger now sufficed to fix an event for an unlimited period of time. The camera gave the moment a posthumous shock, as it were" [ 132]. Benjamin claims not only that Baudelaire wanted to "create a cliche," but supports that claim by focusing his reading of Baudelaire on images presented in cliche: he reads the lieu commun, or the common space (the street), that is presented in Baudelaire through its negative images. Only by reading "A une passante" as a negative image, one presented in relief, can Benjamin read the crowd as the primary (albeit negative) figure of the poem. In addition, it is only by reading Benjamin's reading of "A une passante" as a "cliche" that we understand how the modernity of "A une passante" is imprinted with the traces of the allegorical antiquity of "Le cygne." If we retain the memory of the notion of the "negative image" in the word cliche, we can begin to see how Benjamin reads history, through the figure of Baudelaire, as cliche. In the most complex and enigmatic lines of "Motifs," Benjamin attempts to describe how to read a change in the structure of experience. In an attempt to describe how history is represented in the passage from Bergson' s supposedly ahistorical account of the structure of memory to Baudelaire's poetic "cliche" of history, Benjamin writes: It is, however, not at all Bergson's intention to attach any specific historical label to memory. On the contrary, he rejects any historical determination of memory. He thus manages to stay clear of that experience from which his own philosophy evolved or, rather, in reaction to which it arose. It was the inhospitable, blinding age of big-scale industrialism. In shutting out this experience the eye perceives an experience of a complementary nature in the form of its spontaneous after-image, as it were [Dem Auge, das sich vor dieser Erfahrung schliesst, stellt sich eine Erfahrung komplementarer Art als deren gleichsam spontanes Nachbild ein]. Bergson's philosophy represents an attempt to give details of this after-image and tofix it as a permanent record. His philosophy thus indirectly furnishes a clue to the experience which presented itself to Baudelaire's eyes in its undistorted version in the figure of his reader [Sie gibt derart mittelbar einen Hinweis auf die Erfahrung, die Baudelaire unverstellt, in der Gestalt seines Lesers, vor Augen tritt]. [111; GS 2: 609] Benjamin' s reading of the view of history that can be developed in the passage between Bergson's philosophy and Baudelaire's reader mirrors the structure of a photographic apparatus and recalls his reading of the negative image of history in "A une passante." Benjamin locates the imprint of history on Bergson's philosophy in the very gesture through which Bergson attempted to blot it out. It is "the blinding age" that forces Bergson to shut his eyes to the historical dimension of memory. But because he shuts his eyes in response to the blinding flash of history, his shut eyes perform the role of a photographic shutter: they retain the blotted image and allow it to be recorded (negatively) despite the fact that the recorded image was never seen directly. The trace of history that Bergson' s philosophy records can be seen only when it is "developed" through the gaze of the figure of Baudelaire's reader. In order to read the trace of this photographic cliche of history, we shall return, once again, to "A une passante." If we have not yet looked directly at "A une passante," it is because it is not clear what one can see by looking directly at it. The central event in the poem occurs in the ellipsis 138</page><page sequence="13">of a blinding flash: "Un eclair... puis la nuit! [A flash... then night!]" But by following Benjamin's attempt to develop the negative image of history that is represented in it, we shall read this poem as Baudelaire's written photograph of history as cliche. La rue assourdissante autour de moi hurlait. Longue, mince, en grand deuil, douleur majestueuse, Unefemme passa, d'une main fastueuse Soulevant, balanfant lefeston et l'ourlet. Agile et noble, avec sa jambe de statue. Moi, je buvais, crispe comme un extravagant, Dans son oeil, ciel livide ou germe l'ouragon, La douceur quifascine et le plaisir qui tue. Un eclair . . puis la nuit!-Fugitive beaute Dont le regard m'a fait soudainement renaitre, Ne te verrai-je plus que dans l'eternitd? Ailleurs, bien loin d'ici! Trop tard! Jamais peut-etre! Carj'ignore ou tufuis, tu ne sais ouije vais, 0 toi quej'eusse aimee, 6 toi qui le savais! [92-93] [The deafening street around me was screaming. Long, slim, in deep mourning, majestic grief, A woman passed, raising, with a delicate hand, The trim and hem of the flounces of her gown; Graceful and noble, with her statue's leg. And I drank, frozen like a madman, In her eye, livid sky where the storm breeds, The softness that fascinates and the pleasure that kills. A flash... then night!-O fleeting beauty Whose look made me suddenly be reborn Shall I not see you again but in eternity? Elsewhere, far from here! Too late! Never, perhaps! I know not where you flee, you don't know where I go, You, whom I would have loved, you who knew it was so.] [my translation] The structure of the sonnet (which divides the poem into two quatrains followed by two tercets) also divides the action depicted in the poem. In the first half of the poem, the narrator makes a desperate attempt to represent the presence of the passing figure. The tercets in the second half of the poem reiterate the event represented in the quatrains- but they take the form of an impossible address relayed through a kind of photographic after-image. The pathos of the apostrophe resides in the fact that the poet's futile address to the woman coincides with and collapses into an equally futile attempt at recollecting the encounter. The fulguration or "lightning flash" that separates the two halves of the poem is, as Benjamin has indicated, precisely not the "coup de foudre" of love at first sight but rather like the flash of a camera, which explodes after the moment has vanished and through which the image of that moment is retained: "Un 6clair ... puis la nuit!" The lightning flash-the very mark of instantaneity-occurs long after the figure has presumably passed. What produces this flash? What is reiterated in it? diacritics / fall-winter 1992 139</page><page sequence="14">One of the greatest difficulties this poem presents depends on how we read the various grammatical tenses of the verb passer that appear in the poem. Passer is intransitive here and cannot have a simple present: how does one think the present tense of the verb that means to pass? The title of the poem, "A une passante," transforms the present active participle of passer into a name (almost a proper name) that is given to the feminine figure. In the designation "passante," the figure of the woman clings to the present tense ofpasser and vice versa. In the poem' s title, the woman and the verb cannot be construed as separate entities: hence it would be an error to read "passante" synony- mously with a phrase like "celle qui passe" or "she who passes." The present tense of the verb adheres to the figure of the woman in the same way that, as Barthes will later claim, the photographic referent adheres to the photograph.12 It is only through their incarnation in the woman's body thatpasser can be represented in the present tense and that a moment of "passing" can appear as presence. The moment that the poem attempts to arrest can be read in the decalage between the time when the woman's body clings to the verb in the present active participle and the separation between the body of the woman and the action of the verb that occurs in the line "Une femme passa" ("a woman passed"). Before she is called a woman, this embodied feminine present is named passante, and as passante she is always perpetually passing. She is calledfemme ("woman") only in her absence, after she has already passed away. The poem attempts to arrest, photographically, the impossible temporal disjunction evoked by her passage. So, let us ask naively, exactly when, in the poem, does the passante pass? The first line of the poem situates the narrator in the deafening presence of a noisy street. It would seem that it is the passante's silence, in contrast to the noisy street, that first catches the narrator's attention. He does not notice her by chance-she stands out from the crowd. And it is not her beauty that draws the poet' s attention to her: the poem does not refer to her beauty until after she has passed away. It is the fact that she is "en grand deuil," dressed in mourning, that catches the poet's eye. But if he notices her because she is in mourning, in the very moment he looks at her, he has already looked past her-to the death that preceded her presence and marks her passage. This poem presents a vertiginous relay of deaths: the first death precedes the poem, the woman's veil is a figure of its passage, and then she, in turn, passes away. It is this relay of perpetual passings, layered upon one another, that the poem mourns repeatedly. When does she pass? In the moment of her "arrival" she is hardly distinguishable from the description of the street itself. The figure for the street and for the woman converge in the adjectives through which she is introduced: "longue, mince." The figure for the woman detaches itself from the passing crowd only through the invocation of her mourning: "en grand deuil, douleur majestueuse." The third line presents us with the poem's central paradox: "Une femme passa, d'une main fastueuse / soulevant, balanqant le feston et l'ourlet." Unefemme passa. A woman passed. The verb tense that recounts her passage is thepasse simple, the simple past. But in this poem this past tense is anything but simple. It is immediately followed and contested by the reemergence of two verbs in the present active participle: soulevant and balancant. The continuous repetition of this passage, as an immobilized and even petrified "present," characterizes the remainder of the poem. The figure of the passante becomes literally petrified; she is a walking tombstone with "sajambe de statue." It would seem to be this image of a petrified present that shocks and freezes the narrator: "Moi,je buvais, crispe comme un extravagant." It is only after this reciprocal petrification that the narrator 11. For a reading of the question of "feminine presence " in Baudelaire, in relation to "A une passante " and "La beaut, " see Peggy Kamuf's "Baudelaire's Modern Woman. " 12. In Camera Lucida, Barthes writes: "In short, the referent adheres. And this singular adherence makes it very difficult to focus on Photography" [6]. 140</page><page sequence="15">looks directly in her eye: "Dans son oeil, ciel livide oi germe l'ouragon / La douceur qui fascine et le plaisir qui tue." But the look that they presumably exchange is reconstructed only after the event-after she has already passed. And it is doubly impossible: not only is she gone before he gazes in her eye, but if she is "en grand deuil" she is veiled. Although she can see through her veil, her "eye" is precisely what cannot be seen through it. The veil becomes like a one-way mirror, a screen onto which the narrator projects a hallucination of the reciprocated gaze that can never take place but which he is eternally condemned to repeat. Furthermore, in the act of looking her "in the eye," he has the revelation (and this revelation is already figured by the notion that he "lifts her veil" to look her in the eye) that the eros "in her eye" is, like the veil it bypasses, imprinted by the mark of death. "In her eye," he reads the trace of a "pleasure that kills." The mark of a past death that was imprinted in the veil returns through the mark of a future death impaled "in the eye" of the hallucinated look. Although it is bizarre enough that this hallucinated look takes place at all, it is even odder that the lightning flash which should logically precede or coincide with the look follows it, thereby transforming the flash into a posthumous shock of the event rather than as the sign of the event itself. The flash marks the aftermath of the encounter: it repeats the exchanged look in a cliche: "Un eclair... puis la nuit-fugitive beaute / Dont le regard m'a fait soudainement renaitre, ne te verrai-je plus que dans l'eternite?" It would seem that the narrator is "reborn" in the flash of the mechanical reproduction of a look that is repeated without ever having actually occurred. In the final tercet of the poem, the narrator's desperate attempt to conjure up the experience of this passage as "presence" terminates in cliche. The temporal disjunction that the poem has already set in motion returns in spatial terms: "Ailleurs, bien loin d'ici." Although in the previous stanza the word eternite' invoked the cliched hope that there might be an "eternal" temporal and spatial utopia in which the poet could recover his lost object, in the final stanza all hope of restitution is abandoned. In apparent despair, the poet calls out to the lost woman by invoking more and more negative images of time and space: "Ailleurs, bien loin d'ici! Trop tard! Jamais peut-etre ! [Elsewhere, far from here, too late, never perhaps!]." As Benjamin remarks in "Second Empire," "The never marks the high point of the encounter, when the poet' s passion seems to be frustrated but in reality bursts out of him like a flame. He burs in this flame, but no Phoenix arises from it" [45]. Although, as Benjamin indicates, there can be no future rebirth from the passion ignited by and in this never, we are reminded once again that the stuttering repetition of loss recounted in "A une passante" is itself a vertiginous replay of the losses depicted in "Le cygne." The emphasized wordjamais in "A une passante" functions like a citation of the stuttering repetition of the wordjamais in "Le cygne." In "Le cygne" Baudelaire writes: "A Quiconque a perdu ce qui ne se retrouve / Jamais, Jamais! [To whoever has lost that which is not re-found / Never, Never!]." This depiction of an empty repetition of a death that can never be assimilated, transcended, or put to work is reminiscent of what Roland Barthes calls photographic death. Barthes's reflections on "his" photograph recall the crisis experienced by the narrator of "A une passante." Barthes writes: ... the photograph-my photograph-is without culture: When it is painful, nothing in it can transform grief into mourning. And if dialectic is that thought which masters the corruptible and converts the negation of death into the power to work, then the photograph is undialectical: it is a denatured theater where death cannot "be contemplated" reflected and interiorized.... [90] Through its attempt to capture the movement from "passing" to "past" which is figured by repeated images of frozen movement, "A une passante" becomes a photograph in the diacritics / fall-winter 1992 141</page><page sequence="16">Barthesian sense. This poem cannot get past the passing of its central figure: the symbolic pathos of the mourning figure collapses into a disarticulated repetition. The dead are neither buried nor put to rest; ghosts of history return in the form of stuttering cliches.13 "A une passante" stages a strangely embodied, immobilized, and undialectical death where private mourning meets the banality, the lieu commun, of the public space. The passing woman never quite dies, but rather becomes a figure for death's immobile movement. In the opening lines of Camera Lucida, Roland Barthes narrates an anecdote through which (and he later says so explicitly) we understand that he sees himself, historically, as the last witness to an amazement provoked by the sheer ontological fact of the photo- graphic image. He writes: One day, quite some time ago, I happened upon a photograph of Napoleon's youngest brother, Jerome, taken in 1852. And I realized then, with an amazementI have not been able to lessen since: "Iam looking at eyes that looked at the Emperor. " Sometimes I would mention this amazement, but since no one seemed to share it, or even understand it (life consists of these little touches of solitude) I forgot about it. My interest in photography took a more cultural turn. [3] By recalling that, in "Motifs," Benjamin situates the shock of photography in the context of a study devoted to "the last lyric poet," we can begin to appreciate what might be at stake in Barthes's lonely amazement. By staring at the photographic, or cliched, face of Napoleon's brother, Barthes implies that his amazement stems from the sense that he is staring history in the face. This impression (that he is looking directly at the face of history) could not have been produced, one understands, by a photograph of the emperor himself-even if such a photograph were indeed possible. If Barthes sees "history" in the photograph of the emperor's brother, it is because he reads that photograph as a negative image and thus perceives the absent face of the emperor that is depicted, in relief, through the relayed gaze of his brother. History, once again presented as cliche, can be seen here only by looking at a photographic representation of someone for whom the face of the emperor would be something other than merely a figure for history. It is through the suggestion of an absent "familiar look" (which recalls Benjamin's discussion of Baudelaire' s use of the term regardsfamiliers) at the emperor, that Barthes perceives the trace of history. Toward the very end of Camera Lucida, Barthes gives another name to that relationship among history, death, and photography that we have been calling cliche. If, in reading Baudelaire through Benjamin, we have seen how the look of history is sent back as cliche, in Barthes's text the operative word is platitude. It is through the use of the word platitude that Barthes explains, obliquely, why he insists upon staring at the ontological fact of photography rather than addressing the question of its history directly. Barthes explicitly chooses not to write a history of photography, but instead to look at how photography both produces and reproduces our contemporary conception of the image of History. History, as Barthes understands it here, is itself a product of the nineteenth century. He writes: "A paradox: the same century invented History and Photography" [93]. The history that Barthes sees in photography is a certain history of death. The word that he uses for the history of death read through the photograph is platitude: "With the photograph, we enter intoflat death. One day, leaving one of my classes, someone said 13. My thinking in this essay was initially motivated by an attempt to understand what the word history means in Paul de Man's writings. Although I cannot address this problem here, this essay is haunted, in particular, by the concluding lines of "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric" [see 262]. 142</page><page sequence="17">to me with disdain, 'You talk about death very flatly.'-As if the horror of Death were not precisely its platitude!" [92]. It is in relation to this vision of death as platitude that photography assumes its own, historical perspective. He writes: For photography must have some historical relation with what Edgar Morin calls the "crisis of death " beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century; for my part I should prefer that instead of constantly relocating the advent of photography in its social and economic context, we should also inquire as to the anthropological place of Death and the new image.... Contemporary with the withdrawal of rites, Photography may correspond to the intrusion, in our modern society, of an asymbolic Death, outside of religion, outside of ritual, a kind of dive into literal Death. Life/Death: the paradigm is reduced to a simple click, the one separating the initial pose from the final print. [92] The photograph is the veil of this asymbolic death. Its platitude lies in the fact that this asymbolic death can never be transcended, can never be put to work. It is nothing but a cliche, a stutter, a repetition, platitude. Flat death: this inability to "go beyond" the passing of the past-the being caught in the relay of an infinite mechanical reproduction that we do not transcend-is the cliche that is contemporary history.
