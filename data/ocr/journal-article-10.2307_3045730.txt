<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Cross-Carpet Page in the Book of Durrow: The Cult of the True Cross, Adomnan, and Iona Martin Werner It has been generally assumed that fol. lv, the cross-carpet page opening the Book of Durrow, either makes vague reference to the Christian symbol or has no religious significance. After an examination of the origins, nature, and spread of the cult of the True Cross and its significant Insular manifestations, the hypothesis is presented that the double-barred cross in the Durrow miniature was meant to represent the True Cross, the instrument of the Passion. De locis sanctis, a document of late seventh-century origin by Adomnan, ninth abbot of lona, detailing a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, Constantinople, and other Eastern sites, is examined and proposed as inspiring the juxtaposition of our cross-carpet page and a folio displaying the Evangelist symbols around an interlaced cross. The two miniatures are seen to be a scholarly figuration setting out sacred areas of the Holy Sepulchre, Jerusalem. The Durrow master's proposed reliance on the De locis sanctis text is also held to strengthen a conclusion of an lona provenance of ca. 685 for the Book of Durrow. The Book of Durrow is the earliest of the extant, richly ornamented Insular Gospel books.' Its precise date, place of origin, textual and decorative sources remain elusive. We cannot yet judge when and where its Germanic com- ponent actively joined with Celtic and other elements to initiate the Hiberno-Saxon style, and thus the manuscript continues to stand at the center of a protracted debate as to whether it was Ireland or Northumbria that provided the creative impulse enabling the style to emerge and flourish. The codex is decorated with Evangelist symbols pages, large initials, and carpet pages. One way in which it may prove possible to address the issues surrounding its creation is through iconographic analysis of the last-mentioned min- iatures - pages usually considered exclusively or primarily decorative. Although attempts have been made to discover complex symbolic meanings in some of the carpet pages, the specific symbolic intent of most of these compositions may never be satisfactorily explained. There is, however, one such miniature (Fig. 1), the carpet page opening the Gospel book (fol. lv), whose design not only encourages the possibility of successful iconographic analysis, but of- fers hope of solution to many vexing questions surrounding the issue of the origin of the manuscript. In recent years, this page has achieved a certain prom- inence because of its central import to the controversy be- tween Carl Nordenfalk and Meyer Schapiro concerning the significance of a set of colophon illustrations in a sixteenth- century Persian copy of Tatian's second-century Gospel harmony, the Diatessaron, in illuminating the origins of Early Christian art.2 A striking resemblance exists between the cross-carpet page (Fig. 3) that begins the sixteenth-cen- tury set and the Durrow folio. Nordenfalk believes both miniatures depend upon a common archetype, a miniature of great antiquity and part of the sequence of illustrations lying behind the Persian colophon group. Schapiro has re- jected both the possibility that the Persian illustrations orig- inate in a single Early Christian sequential series and the idea of the same exemplar for the Persian Diatessaron and Durrow cross-carpet pages. Yet, although scholars are not of a common mind on the question of the exemplar or ex- emplars that the Durrow scribe-artist may have consulted in the course of formulating the design for fol. lv, a re- markable agreement exists in the matter of the symbolic character of the large double-barred cross that dominates the page. Two related possibilities have been put forward. The cross has been judged as making vague or general ref- erence to the Christian symbol, or it has been understood as essentially abstract ornament perhaps not meant to have any religious significance. Most important, there is general agreement that the doubling of the horizontal bar is icon- ographically meaningless. These assumptions, I believe, rest on serious misreadings and misunderstandings of the avail- able evidence. The central panel of our miniature is occupied by a large yellow cross with two horizontal bars imbedded in a con- gested field of interlaced knots. The knots set out horizon- tally are green and red; those placed vertically are green, and yellow knots occupy the corners of the rectangle. A border filled with interlace of varied type surrounds the 1 Dublin Trinity College Ms A.4.5 (57); E.Q. C.D.; Alexander, 30-32, pls. 13-22. For up-to-date bibliography, see C.

Built up of squares at crossings and terminals, the double-barred cross also features small squares which occupy the center of each of these larger connected squares. Those at the crossings are filled with black and white T shapes in swastika-like formation; checkerboard patterns fill the little squares in the six terminals. Meander-like pat- terns of the same size as the small interior squares are at- tached to each terminal, transforming these square endings into crosslets. Echoing the form of these crosslets are black and white stepped interlace crosses at the corners of the rectangular field. There are six yellow squares in the back- ground knotwork surrounding the central cross, and du- plicate squares complete the stepped interlace designs at the four corners. All these yellow squares are of the same di- mensions as the squares filled with ornament within the crossings and terminals of the central cross. Presently placed at the opening of Durrow, fol. 1v may not always have occupied that position. Over the centuries portions of the text and several of the miniatures were mis- bound and many pages cut to single leaves. This necessi- tated the difficult task of attempting to reconstruct the orig- inal sequence when the codex was rebound in 1954, and at that time, the binder Roger Powell pointed to a disturbance in the opening sequence of leaves and the possibility that fol. lv had once been adjacent to the man symbol in Mat- thew.3 However, A.A. Luce, who wrote an essay on the text for the facsimile edition of the codex, found nothing to justify the view that the cross-carpet page is not in its original position.4 Fol. 1v faces a page displaying an in- terlaced cross with an Evangelist symbol in each of the in- terspaces (Fig. 2). A review of the internal and other evi- dence emphatically supports Luce's hypothesis of the deliberate contiguity of the two folios at the beginning of the Insular codex.5 The premise of this apposition points to a further pos- sibility, namely that the two miniatures were meant to evoke complementary ideas - that is, they were planned as two halves of a single demonstration. Certainly, with its unambiguously symbolic display of cross and Evangelist symbols, fol. 2r tends to suggest a similar or related sym- bolic purpose for the folio it faces.6 This brings us to a consideration of the character of the 3R. Powell, "The Book of Kells, the Book of Durrow: Comments on the Vellum, the Makeup and Other Aspects," Scriptorium, x, 1956, 15; Powell in E. Q.C.D., 80-85. See also Bruce-Mitford in E.Q.C.L., 245, n. 1. 4 Luce in E. Q. C.D., 69-71. s The rebinding of 1954 resulted in the transference of the man symbol, which had been bound at the back of the book as fol. 248v, to the opening of Matthew, to become fol. 21v, and moving fol. 13v, a decorative page prefacing Matthew, to the end of the codex. It is now fol. 248r. As pres- ently bound, except for Matthew, a sequence of Evangelist symbol page, carpet page, and initial page opens each Gospel. There are three decorated leaves at the beginning of the manuscript, fol. lv, fol. 2r, and fol. 3v (Alexander, pl. 12), the last of which features a trumpet spirals design and faces the initial "N" of the Novum opus, fol. 4r (Henderson, fig. 6). Since there is no reason to believe fol. 3v or fol. 248r was ever intended to preface Matthew (but see Henderson, 23, who suggests the possibility for fol. 3v but offers no evidence in support), the anomaly in the ar- rangement of decorated pages remains the absence of a carpet page before fol. 22r, the Liber generationis (ibid., fig. 9). Powell suspected the cross- carpet page was intended for this position, whereas Luce proposed the Matthew carpet page was lost. The possibility of symbolic intent for fol. lv compels consideration of placement not only because the miniature as presently bound introduces the Gospel book but because it faces fol. 2r, the four Evangelist symbols page. Two blank pages, fols. 2v and 3r, separate the opening sequence from fols. 3v and 4r, and it seems possible that the Durrow master used the blank folios to create two sequences, the first, fols. lv-2r, to introduce the full Gospel codex, the second, fols. 3v-4r, to emphasize the importance of Saint Jerome's letter to Pope Damasus and perhaps to accentuate the preliminaries and canon tables. Aspects of the fol. lv composition also argue for introductory em- ployment. The page is boldly dominated by a large yellow cross whose emblematic aspect, no matter how perceived, has a directness, simplicity, isolation, and singularity at variance with the spirals, interlace, and other ornamental panels and groupings variously distributed on the remaining carpet pages. And certainly the small crosses that appear in several of these compositions (fols. 85v, 192v, 248r) (Alexander, pls. 20, 22; Hen- derson, fig. 14) are formally subordinated to the surrounding ornament. Then too, the opening initials of the Matthew text do not seem sufficiently idiosyncratic to call for a carpet page resembling fol. lv - one so mark- edly unlike the carpet pages before Mark, Luke, and John. On the var- iations between the initial pages, see Luce in E. Q. C. D., 5; Bruce-Mitford in E. Q.C.L., 120, n. 3. The intended position for the cross-carpet page may be approached from another angle: the order of the decorated recto and verso folios. Of the Evangelist symbol and carpet pages, only fols. 2r and 248r are installed as rectos. The latter is employed as a kind of unpasted end paper and therefore stands apart from the Insular system of text emphasis. Fol. 2r thus becomes the only folio bearing ornament or figuration that both conforms to this Insular practice and is bound in the recto position. Unless it was meant to face another miniature, there seems no reason for its departure from the codicological symmetry carefully maintained through- out the manuscript. Compositional aspects of the carpet pages underline this point. There are considerable variations in the dimensions and proportions of the cen- tral fields of the carpet pages before the Novum opus, Mark, Luke, and John (Alexander, pl. 21). In sharp contrast, the sketch plans for the cross carpet and four Evangelist symbols pages are very similar: the central panel of fol. lv measures 108 x 78mm, that of fol. 2r, 96 x 72mm; in each miniature the central panel is about four times as wide as the side panels of the frame, and in each the horizontal panels of the frame are more than twice as wide as those at the side. For discussion of the dimensions of the two pages, see R.D. Stevick, "The Shapes of the Book of Durrow Evangelist-Symbol Pages," Art Bulletin, LxvIII, 1986, 191-192. Finally, the single inserted leaf with the four symbols of the Evangelists on one side (p. 219) and a cross-carpet composition on the other (p. 220) in the early 8th-century Lichfield (Cath. Lib.) Gospels (Book of St. Chad); (Alexander, 48-50, pls. 77, 81; W.A. Stein, "The Lichfield Gospels," Ph.D. diss., University of California, Berkeley, 1980; Henderson, 122f), is proof that Insular illuminators created contiguous four-symbols and cross- carpet compositions at an early date. 6 Besides being the first of the surviving fully illustrated Insular Gospel Books, the Book of Durrow is the earliest employing cross-carpet and four-symbols folios. No other Insular manuscript displays facing cross- carpet and four-symbols folios. There are, however, some few instances where prefatory or colophon sequences of other figurations are employed. Full page Crucifixion and Last Judgment illustrations (pp. 226-227) close the 8th-century St. Gall Gospels (Stiftsbibl. MS 51) and stand apart from the text; Alexander, 66- 67, pls. 203, 206. The fragmentary Bobbio Gospels (Turin, Bibl. Univ. Naz. MS O.Iv.20) contains miniatures of possible early 9th-century date. There is an Ascension on fol. la and the Second Coming appears on fol. 2a. We do not know whether the miniatures were meant to preface or follow the text. That they form a pair is made apparent by the text of Acts inscribed on the Ascension page; Alexander, 80-81, pls. 279, 280. Thus, while unusual, two-part displays are not without example in Insular illumination.</page><page sequence="3">176 THE ART BULLETIN JUNE 1990 VOLUME LXXII NUMBER 2 I i;: - ?- ~ii~- l " "~a~r~;~ii?sa~'~! ::::: .... ........ i:: - -:-ii--- iii:~i 1 Book of Durrow, Cross-carpet page.

It has a long vertical shaft and two transverse arms equidistant from the center. Was it intended as a sacred symbol and, if so, was it meant to represent the True Cross? As will be seen, by the sixth cen- tury a short upper bar employed to suggest the board above Christ's head at the Crucifixion was added to the conven- tional Greek cross for certain emblems of the True Cross, the instrument of the Passion. These crosses have come to be called Byzantine or patriarchal crosses. It has been ar- gued that because of the equality of length and thickness of the upper and lower bars and their equidistance from the center of the field, the Durrow figure is not likely to be a sacred emblem, much less a patriarchal cross.7 Nor- denfalk, for example, insists on the probability of a sacred Greek cross inspiring the upper half of the Durrow cross design, but he explains the introduction of the lower trans- verse as the consequence of a desire to adjust a composition conceived for a square folio to an oblong codex format. In other words, the lower beam was a device used to lengthen the composition.8 In reality, of course, it is the square at ? i , i i l ...... ...  l !!i'ili~iiiiiii!ii'i~i~iiiiiiiiii?

Florence, Bibl. Laur. Orient. MS 81, fol. 127 (photo: Bibl. Laur.) 7 See especially Aberg, I, 103, and Meyer in E. Q. C.D., 102. Most recently this view was given more extreme thrust by Neuman de Vegvar, 106-107: The Durrow cross . . . has been amalgamated into the grid layout of the ornament. The double arms of equal length and importance balance the cross against the background patterning but are iconographically meaningless. It is even possible to argue that there is no cross at all here, that the page is purely ornamental with certain elements sug- gesting a cross and crosslets to distinguish the frontispiece from the other purely ornamental carpet pages in the manuscript. Then, too, M. Gelfer-Jorgensen, "On Insular Miniatures and Islamic Textiles," Hafnia, vi, 1979, 50f, has proposed a relation between garden designs on 17th- and 18th-century Persian carpets and the Durrow cross- carpet page. However, the similarities adduced are too slight to bear serious consideration. 8 In his study of 1968, Nordenfalk proposed the set of colophon illustra- tions in the 16th-century Persian Diatessaron in Florence (Bibl. Laur. Ms Or. 81) as preserving the essential features of a colophon cycle made for a Greek text of Tatian's manuscript in 2nd-century Rome. Noting what he believed to be significant similarities between the illustrations in the Florence codex and miniatures in the Book of Durrow, the Echternach Gospels, the Book of Kells, and other Insular books, Nordenfalk offered the hypothesis that not long after its manufacture, a 2nd-century copy of Tatian's Gospel harmony was introduced to Scotland, there to be con- sulted some five centuries later by the Durrow master. "Insular illumi- nation," he concluded, "rested mainly on one pillar: a copy of an illus- trated edition of Tatian's Diatessaron." Schapiro (see Sources) has challenged Nordenfalk on almost every point. None of the Florence miniatures, he notes, could have descended from 2nd-century archetypes, but must instead depend upon models ranging from the 5th to the 16th century. In his response, Nordenfalk, 1973, con- ceded a major point - the belief that the Florence colophon set must ultimately descend from a 2nd-century archetype. Nevertheless, he main- tained an Early Christian origin for the illustrations and continues to assert the dependence of early Hiberno-Saxon illumination on the example of the Diatessaron sequence. The latter, he speculates, may have become available during the second half of the 7th century. Nordenfalk's thesis rests largely on the striking resemblances between the cross-carpet page introducing the colophon set in the Florence codex and Durrow fol. lv. Both compositions display a central cross built up of squares with small arms at each quadrant creating stepped crosslets. Each cross has square panels centered in the crosslets. In each miniature, a grid of red, yellow, and green interlace conspicuously surrounds the central cross. Finally, a wide border frames each of the cross panels. Despite these agreements, notable differences also exist. Mindful of a number of these, Schapiro proposes each miniature to be the product of parallel developments in East and West. The Florence page, he maintains, is "a Syrian composition from the period between the thirteenth and the sixteenth century." The crosses in the Durrow and Florence cross-carpet pages are typo- logically dissimilar. In the 16th-century composition, the central cross is equal-armed, single-barred, and provided with a high, stepped base. Con- versely, the Insular cross is double-barred, taller than it is wide, and with- out a base. Nordenfalk, 1968, built his argument for a common archetype on the premise that the latter displayed an equal-armed cross minus a base - a kind of hidden or disguised cross - this because 2nd-century Chris- tians feared to display the cross openly as a Christian symbol. This em- blem, we are told, conformed to a square format characteristic of pre- Constantinian codices. Hence, the painter who added the high stepped pedestal to this Greek cross (in the 13th or 16th century) - a reference to the stepped platform erected on Golgotha after 400 - and the artist who added a second transverse beam to Durrow fol. 1v did so because they needed to modify the square format of their Diatessaron model to accommodate the post-Constantinian oblong shape of the codex. However, Schapiro has shown the square format to be atypical of 2nd- or 3rd-century books. Instead, it is characteristic of certain large codices of the 4th, 5th, and 6th centuries, and these, when illustrated, frequently employ compositions of oblong shape. Nordenfalk, 1973, is silent on this point, but given his retreat from a 2nd-century date for the colophon archetype and the consequent weakening of the hidden cross argument, we cannot but accept the probability that the model (or models) followed by the painter of the Florence cross-carpet page from the first exhibited a pedestaled Cross of Golgotha within an oblong field and is thus icon- ographically distinct from the Durrow composition, with its central "floating" double-barred cross.</page><page sequence="6">THE CROSS-CARPET PAGE IN THE BOOK OF DURROW 179 the crossing of the lower transverse and vertical bar that extends the cross vertically. The additional connected squares to right and left are not necessary for the creation of an oblong format. It must be assumed that Nordenfalk intended to suggest that the two terminals of the lower beam followed upon the elongation of the yellow cross so as to achieve a uniform effect. But this is not a strong argument, for symmetry could have been realized by preserving the square format of the central field in the hypothetical ex- emplar miniature. The Durrow master had few inhibitions regarding the size, dimensions, and proportions of the cen- tral panels of his carpet pages. Indeed, the transverse panels of the frame on fol. 192v are proportioned so as to accom- modate a square central field. Also notable is the avoidance of symmetry on fol. 2r. The Durrow master could easily have made his four symbols equal in height and thus create four compartments having the same proportions. Instead, the upper interspaces are square, those below oblong.9 The more we look at the form of the cross on Durrow fol. lv, the more improbable seems the conjecture by which Nordenfalk would explain departures from his supposed early Greek cross model. But if the arguments for format adjustment are not convincing, what of those that insist on interpreting the symmetrical yellow cross and the sur- rounding interlace crosses of our miniature as the natural consequence of the application of ornamental grid con- struction - an arrangement of crosslet squares connected vertically and horizontally in the manner of a continuous web, where even the four stepped black and white interlace crosslet units, although isolated, are aligned with the cross- let ends of the central cross? For Schapiro and others, this field-filling, regularized ornament may have been con- ceived without iconographic reference. Most important, the symmetry of the central pattern seems too complete to evoke the form of the patriarchal cross, whose upper half is usually occupied by a long beam and short titulus shape. This last argument is built on the premise of consistency of form for the patriarchal cross. However, when we look at the Early Christian and early medieval examples, we dis- cover surprising variations in the shape of the cross type. There are Early Christian versions making explicit refer- ence to the True Cross with tituli of the same length as the cross beams below, and others where the upper bar is only slightly less long.1' Also of interest are the reverses of cer- tain late sixth-century Merovingian gold coins featuring a Latin cross provided with a horizontal base of approxi- mately the same shape or length as the cross bar set on a small disc or pellet - a variant of the Byzantine globus. One such cross design, appearing on a coin of the Crondall hoard deposited ca. 650,11 approaches the form of the pa- triarchal cross and perhaps could have been interpreted as such by an Insular artist unfamiliar with the cross sym- bolism of early medieval coinage (Fig. 4). Although the alleged absence of the symmetrical patriarchal cross type on contemporaneous Insular grave stones has been held to argue against a symbolic interpretation for the Durrow de- sign, 2 there are in fact a number of simple double-barred crosses that approach perfect symmetry on Insular slabs of 9 Also instructive is a comparison between the fol. 1v cross and those in other early Insular cross-carpet compositions. In the shape of its parts, the Durrow cross resembles the cross on fol. 2v in the Lindisfarne Gospels (Alexander, pl. 37) and that on p. 220 in the Lichfield Gospels (Alexander, pl. 77). Each of the crosses is patterned on a series of interconnected squares, with four squares on the vertical axis. Yet the Lindisfarne and Lichfield painters felt no need to introduce horizontal extensions to the fourth square from the top in order to balance their cross designs. (The suggestion of close similarity is based on an understanding of the terminals of the Durrow yellow cross as squares outlined in black to which meander patterns are attached. These additions create'crosslets but do not effect a break in the outline of the squares. Furthermore, each of the In- sular crosses cited lacks a proper base, i.e., a lower terminal wider, higher, or otherwise unlike the other cross endings. Therefore each is a floating or lying cross.) 10 Although Schapiro, 534, recognizes the possibility of a "deviant" form of the double-barred cross occurring at an early date, he questions whether such a design could have inspired the Durrow cross: "It remains surprising that a cross identified with the body of Christ and his outstretched arms should be conceived with this [symmetrical] form." This is a remarkable statement in the light of the surviving Early Christian and medieval ex- amples of the patriarchal cross. Among these, "deviant" near-symmetrical and symmetrical types are not infrequent. For example, the decoration of the fortress and church of St. Catherine at Mt. Sinai includes reliefs of crosses with title boards of tabula ansata shape as long as the cross beams below - crosses emphatically symbolizing the True Cross within the con- text of the Veneration of the Cross on Calvary hill; G.H. Forsyth and K. Weitzmann, The Monastery of St. Catherine at Mt. Sinai: The Church and Fortress of Justinian, Ann Arbor, 1965, pls. vb, viiia. On fol. 2v in the 8th-century Merovingian Gregory, Commentary on Ezekiel (Lenin- grad Pub. Lib., Ms lat. Q.V.I.N [4]) is a double-barred cross, which again makes unmistakable reference to the True Cross (see n. 104). Its upper bar is actually slightly longer than the one below, and both are set out in a manner approaching complete symmetry; Zimmermann, i, pl. 63b. Mid-Byzantine patriarchal crosses are occasionally of symmetrical dis- position. Cf. a 9th-century coin of Michael III (A. Grabar, LIconoclasme byzantin, Paris, 1957, pl. 45), a bronze coin with Alexius and John II (ca. 1092-1118); Monnaies byzantines et d'autres pays contemporaines sa l'epoque byzantine, Lugano, 1930, 109, no. 2091, pl. i. 11 It is a Frisian coin of the so-called Dronrijp type, with obverse inscribed EVAIN and a reverse with the letters "LV"' beside the cross (C.H.V. Suth- erland, Anglo-Saxon Coinage in the Light of the Crondall Hoard, London, 1984, pl. v, no. 10). Another example of the type was found at Faversham, Kent, and is now in the British Museum (S.E.

The complex issue of its iconographical sig- nificance cannot be examined here, except to observe that the miniature is preceded by a full-page representation of Christ in Majesty and followed by the great Chi Rho ini- tial,14 a sequence indicative of a symbolic purpose for the Kells cross-carpet page. The arguments based on symmetry that deny a symbolic role to the Durrow yellow cross are thus not compelling. Yet this does not deny the decorative character of fol. lv. Those who suggest that the Durrow painter employed a Hiberno-Saxon system or equiponderant, space-filling or- nament constructed on a grid are surely right. Similarly, there is an impulse toward horizontal and vertical balance that is evident in the design of the miniature and in the construction of the other Durrow carpet pages. But why must the Insular system of construction be held to negate symbolic content? The evidence presented here will indi- cate otherwise. This does not mean that the patriarchal cross that may have inspired the Insular figure had arms of equal length. On the contrary, it seems likely that pre- sented with the image or idea of a traditional patriarchal cross with short titulus, the Durrow master followed the dictates of the Hiberno-Saxon koine and equalized the cross bars. Conversely, he seems not to have allowed absolute latitude to his need for balance and continuity, for he con- spicuously distinguishes and separates the four black and white interlace crosses, which are constructed on the same grid as the central golden figure, from the latter's crosslet terminals. The most compelling reason for the Durrow master to ignore the logic of his grid system, which urged him to create a pattern of twelve connected squares, would appear to be that he wished to preserve the outlines of an exalted Christian symbol. Of course, those who insist on the decorative character of fol. lv may inquire why the Durrow master, wishing to preserve the idea of a prescriptive patriarchal cross, would permit an insistence on a system of grid construction and a passion for symmetry to dilute or weaken symbolic def- inition. In response, it might be noted that, with the ex- ception of works reflective of a short-lived embrace of Mediterranean values (Codex Amiatinus, Ruthwell Cross, etc.), Hiberno-Saxon decorative inventiveness and bizarre patternization always intrude upon even the most com- pelling and complex of symbolic demonstrations. In my view, the contradictions and paradoxes of our carpet page suggest an intent to reconcile the claims of intense and ruth- less stylization with those of elaborate and subtle dogmatics.15 Yet to presuppose a conscious reference to the patriarchal cross in the painting that concerns us is to introduce ques- tions of fundamental importance: was the Durrow master aware of the complex cultic associations and doctrinal ref- erences evoked by the symbols of the True Cross cult? If so, why would he wish to employ the patriarchal cross for his introductory miniature? Finally, what can this putative Insular response to the cult of the True Cross tell us about the date and place of manufacture of the Book of Durrow? This study is an attempt to address these questions. The Cult of the True Cross First to be examined is the evidence concerning the origins, nature, and spread of the cult of the True Cross. Veneration of the Cross may have been practiced sporad- 13 For examples in Wales, see the pillar stone from Egremont Church, Carmarthenshire, with a linear cross whose transoms - although of un- equal length - are equidistant from the center; and the pillar stone of uncertain provenance with a double-barred cross approaching complete symmetry; V.E.

Thus, V.H. Elbern, "Zierseiten in Handschriften des friihen Mittelalters als Zeichen sakraler Abgrenzung," Der Begriff der Represen- tatio im Mittelalter. Stellvertretung, Symbol, Zeichen, Bild, ed. A.Z. Zim- mermann (Miscellanea mediaevalia, viII), Berlin and New York, 1971, 340-354, has compared the placement and design of the carpet pages to that of chancel screens, in which symbols of the Entry to Paradise abound. More specifically, he interprets the ornamental page before John in our codex (fol. 192v) - the so-called animal page - as meant to evoke major Christian doctrine ("Die Dreifaltigkeitsminiatur im Book of Durrow: Eine Studie zur unfigurlichen Ikonographie im friihen Mittelalter," Wallraf- Richartz-Jahrbuch, xvII, 1955, 7-42). At the center of the miniature is a small cross surrounded by a large interlaced medallion and three cloi- sonne-like designs. For Elbern, the outer circle was meant to represent the universe, and the central cross and metalwork designs were intended to symbolize the Trinity. More recently, R.B.K. Stevenson, "Aspects of Am- biguity in Crosses and Interlace," Ulster Journal of Archaeology, XLIV- XLv, 1981-82, 1-27, has proposed even those carpet pages where crosses are "negative" forms as symbolically charged. This scholarship and our findings concerning the Durrow cross-carpet prompt analysis of all the carpet pages in the manuscript for symbolic and programmatic intent - an inquiry I hope to pursue in further studies.</page><page sequence="8">THE CROSS-CARPET PAGE IN THE BOOK OF DURROW 181 4 Merovingian coin from Cron- dall hoard, Hampshire, re- verse (photo: Ashmolean Mu- seum, Oxford) ically during the period of persecution,16 but it developed compelling force through symbolic identification of the In- strument of the Passion with Constantine's imperial stan- dard (labarum).17 It was during the Constantinian age that the cult of the True Cross began. Perhaps responding to the urgings of Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea, for pilgrimage to the Holy Land, Constantine sponsored the Holy Se- pulchre complex on Mt. Golgotha.18 Beginning in 328, this complex came to include the Rotunda of the Anastasis, the Martyrium basilica, and a great jeweled cross erected on the site of the Crucifixion.19 Cyril of Jerusalem, who tells us of the emperor's vision of an awesome cross of light in the sky above Golgotha, was the first to mention the dis- covery of the Crucifixion Cross. Writing about 350, he re- marks on the already active dissemination of fragments of Christ's Cross to Christian centers.20 By the close of the fourth century, an "Invention" tradition that assigned the finding of the Cross to Helena, Constantine's mother, had begun. Jerusalem became the center of a growing Cross cult until, in the early seventh century, the Persians occupied the city, destroyed most of its churches, and carried off the True Cross in its silver casket.

But because of a new threat from the Ar- abs, the primary reliquary of the True Cross was removed to Constantinople shortly before Khalif Omar captured Je- rusalem in 638.21 16 P. Braun, "Symboles, signes et monogrammes," Acta Instituti Romani Finlandiai, I, 1963, 94f., and Dinkler, 134-178, emphasize the difficulty of discovering crosses with Christian meaning before the 4th century.

The medieval version, largely de- pendent on earlier apocryphal collections such as the Evan- gelium Nicodemi, is recounted by Jacobus da Voragine in his Golden Legend. According to Jacobus, Adam was bur- ied at the exact spot on Golgotha where Christ was cru- cified. As Adam lay dying, he proclaimed the descent of the Logos and the Crucifixion. Jacobus goes on to record the several discoveries of the Cross: by Adam's son Seth, by Solomon, by the queen of Sheba, by the Jews, and, finally, by the Augusta Helena. In substance, the legend affirms the synonymity of the Cross with the Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden.23 Mensa and altar relics, brandeae, cross reliquaries, and staurotheke are mentioned in the early literature,24 but the earliest surviving cross fragments belong to the fifth and sixth centuries.25 Few such relics survive from Rome, but Helena is said to have brought a fragment (together with the titulus or a portion thereof) for the basilica of S. Croce; segments are recorded for the pontificates of Leo I, Hilary, Symmachus, and Sergius.26 The patriarchal cross appears on coins of Justinian II.27 More problematic is the date of the first appearance of the patriarchal cross in monumental church art and on sacred reliquaries. Three famous "early" reliquaries display the cross type - the Fieschi-Morgan reliquary in the Metro- 22 The Jewish prophets regarded the Tree of Life in the center of Paradise nourished by the four rivers (Gen. 2: 9-10) as a symbol of Messianic sal- vation (Ezek. 47:12) and as God's wisdom (Prov. 3:18). The New Tes- tament, building on Ezekiel, identifies the water of life and the Tree of Life with the sacrificial and redemptive death of Jesus (Rev. 12:1f.). Gol- gotha is equated with Mt. Zion (Rev. 14:1), as the heavenly abode where the Lamb is worshipped, the mount of the future Paradise. Out of it flow the four rivers of salvation. Baptismal and eschatological references here overlap. The legend of the Cross describes the fashioning of the Crucifixion Cross from the wood of the Tree of Life in Paradise. For the Early Christian exegetes, the Cross was prefigured by this tree on which the fate of man- kind was to be determined. Every reference to the Tree in the Old Tes- tament was interpreted as exemplifying the mystery of the Cross. Erected on the spot where Adam lived and died, it was to carry the second Adam who was to die on the same day and hour as the first. It rose from Gol- gotha at the center of the world as the measure of the cosmos. For the patristic and medieval symbolism of the Cross as lignum vitae, see R.

For differing views, see T. Buddensieg, "Le Coffret en ivoire de Pola, Saint-Pierre et le Latran," Cahiers arch ologiques, x, 1959, 157-195. One of the most important of early reliquaries is the silver-gilt cross now in the Museo Sacro Vaticano, Rome. Usually understood as a gift sent to Rome between 565 and 568 by Justin II (Frolow, 1961, 180-181; Grabar [as in n. 10], 19-45), C. Belt- ing-Ihm, "Das Justinuskreuz in der Schatzkammer der Peterskirche zu Rom," Jahrbuch des Romisch-germanischen Zentralmuseums, Mainz, xii, 1965, 142-166, has argued that it is possibly a unique type, a later medieval copy, or, if made in the late 6th century, from a provincial Italian or Near Eastern center. 26 According to Paulinus of Nola (Epistoia xxxi, 3, Hartel in C.S.E.L., xxxix, 56, 269), part of the Crucifixion Cross throws off fragments with- out growing smaller, a miraculous power derived from the Savior's blood.

Some have assigned a pre- Iconoclastic date to these works, and in recent years an early date for the Vatican reliquary has attracted consid- erable support. In any event, the postwar art-historical in- vestigations at the monastery of St. Catherine on Mt. Sinai furnish evidence for sixth-century usage. A series of relief crosses of Justinianic date are carved over loopholes in the central bay of the southeast wall of the monastery.31 Slightly above those at left and center are large tituli whose ends are shaped like those of antique tabulae ansata (Fig. 9). Such tabulae ansata figure as title boards in contemporary Palestinian Crucifixion scenes.32 There can be little doubt, then, that the tituli over the Mt. Sinai relief crosses allude to the titulus of the Crucifixion Cross. Significantly, kneel- ing lambs are placed on either side of the central cross, and represent the Apostles, martyrs, and the faithful as the par- adisiacal flock who drink from the rivers of Paradise be- neath the Cross-Tree upon the hill of Golgotha-Paradise. For the historian of Christian iconography, the Mt. Sinai reliefs are very precious, for they furnish examples of a recondite True Cross iconography employing the patriar- chal cross in the time of Justinian the Great.33 It is possible to discern the impact of theological con- troversy on the evolving imagery and symbolism of the True Cross cult. Christological heresy, that is, heresy grow- 28 The Fieschi-Morgan staurotheka has a cloisonne image of Christ on the Cross with Mary and John on its face. The interior has a patriarchal cross- shaped compartment for the True Cross fragments. Frolow, 1961, 249- 250, has assigned the work to ca. 1000. Iconographic support for this view has been offered by L. Dontcheva, "Une Croix pectorale-reliquaire en or recemment trouve&amp;e a Pliska," Cahiers archeologiques, xxv, 1976, 59-66. K. Wessel, Byzantine Enamels, Shannon, 1967, 8, and E. Lucchesi-Palli, "Zurich paldistinische Darstellung-Typus der H6llenfahrt Christi," R6m- ische Quartalschrift, LVII, 1962, 250f., have used iconographic arguments to support an early date, with Lucchesi-Palli suggesting the second half of the 7th century. M.E. Frazer, in Age of Spirituality, 635-636, criticized Frolow's late dating, linked the Crucifixion imagery of the staurotheka to that of the Monza cross-reliquary (see n. 102), and assigned the first- mentioned work to early 8th-century Palestine. Recently, A.D. Kartsonis, Anastasis, Princeton, 1986, 94-123, has advocated a date in the first part of the 9th century for the work. 29 The Poitiers reliquary has a face displaying the patriarchal cross within a setting of foliate scrolls in cloisonne enamel. This square face was orig- inally the central panel of a triptych whose sides were destroyed during the French Revolution. Traditionally, the reliquary is considered as having belonged to Saint Radegund, founder of the convent, acquired from Justin II around 569. The poet Venantius Fortunatus, secretary to Radegund, and later bishop of Poitiers, welcomed the sacred relic of the Cross in 569 with hymns (Pange lingua, Vexilla regis produent, and the Crux benedicta nitet) later to become part of the liturgy (see n. 55). For Gregory of Tours's report of these events, see Historia Francorum, ix, 40, M.G.H., Script. rer. merov. I, 5, 489-90.

Painted on its inner cover are scenes from the life of Christ. On the outer cover is painted the patriarchal cross within a mandorla and raised on the hill of Paradise-Golgotha. Two staves (probably symbolizing the lance and staff held by Longinus and Stephaton respectively) are crossed over the Calvary Cross. In the upper half of the cover is the inscription "IC XC" and in the lower "A co"; H. Grisar, Die r6mische Kapelle Sancta Sanctorum und ihr Schatz, Freiburg-im-Breisgau, 1908, 116, fig. 60. The box was originally placed under the altar of the Sancta Sanctorum in the Lateran. Frolow, 1965, 102, assigned it to the 9th or 10th century. C.R. Morey, "The Painted Panels from the Sancta Sanctorum," Festschrift Paul Clemen, Diisseldorf, 1926, 151-67, suggested an early 7th-century date; and W. Volbach in Museo Sacro, Guida IV, Il Tesora della cappella Sancta Sanctorum, Vat- ican City, 1944, 51-52, argued for a date of 8th to 9th century. More recently Weitzmann, 1974, 49, pointing to iconographical parallels with Syro-Palestinian works of early date, suggested a 6th century Palestinian provenance for the box. See further Underwood, 98. 31 See n. 10 for reference. 32 See, for example, the Crucifixion on a Palestinian ampule of probable 6th-century date in Washington, D.C.; Catalogue of the Byzantine and Early Medieval Antiquities in the Dumbarton Oaks Collection, ed. M.C. Ross, Washington, D.C., 1962, no. 87, pl. XLVIIIa. A titulus of the same type appears in the Crucifixion scene on the Sancta Sanctorum pil- grim's box. 33 The patriarchal cross and lambs relief on the southwest wall is placed over a loophole opening into a chapel painted with a Crux gemmata and other cross designs; Forsyth and Weitzmann (as in n. 10), pls. viib, cxxxiv, cxxxv. Weitzmann, 33-34, has underlined the close ecclesiastic and ad- ministrative ties between Jerusalem and the Sinai, and it should be noted that the Moses mountain was one of the major Holy Land pilgrimage sites; Egeria, for example, visited it in the early 5th century; Wilkinson, 1981, 18, 29, 91-96. The chapel, which has not been closely studied, should therefore be investigated as the possible sanctum of a relic of the Cross. In the carvings in the church of St. Catherine, tree forms are employed in relation to the simple cross; Forsyth and Weitzmann (as in n. 10), pls. xxvII, LVII. The implied Cross-Tree of Life reference finds emphatic expression in a relief on a capital in the north side of the nave arcade; ibid., pl. LXIIb. Here a single-barred cross is mounted on a circular (ce- lestial globe) base. From the cross arms the alpha and omega are sus- pended. Below are two drinking lambs. Vines grow from the top of the cross and connect to an adjacent Tree of Life. One is reminded of Ve- nantius Fortunatus's references to the eucharistic symbolism of the vine and its identification with the Tree of Life. See n. 55; Frolow, 1965, 184, n. 2. There seems little reason to doubt an intended evocation of the eucharistic associations of the Cross-Tree imagery. In their main outlines, the iconography of the Sinai capital and that of the Poitiers reliquary face are quite similar. One recalls the field of rinceaux and floral designs sur- rounding the patriarchal cross used for the latter (an arrangement, it would appear, without parallel in the decoration of post-Iconoclastic staurotheke). Some significance may also belong to a relief of an orthodox patriarchal cross that is part of a carving of probable medieval date inserted between two fragments of an Early Christian lintel, with inscriptions and angels over the northwest window of the refectory: cf.

At issue was the means of asserting the true humanity of the Savior without weakening affirmation of the will of God acting in Christ. Theologians at Antioch inclined toward insisting on Christ's physical existence in the world and emphasizing his human infirmities. The more "mystical" Alexandrians tended to stress Christ's full divinity. As these positions became radicalized, the Nestorians emerged as the most extreme Antiochenes, the Monophysites the most fervent Alexandrians. The Nestorians proposed that there were two unconnected persons in the Incarnate Son - one divine, the other human. Acknowledging Christ's two natures, they seemed to reject the unity of the two in the one person and thus tended to overemphasize his humanity. Firmly op- posed to this Christology, although insisting on the unity of Christ's person, the Monophysites did not clearly or con- sistently distinguish between his divine and human nature or physis. For them Christ had a single divine nature; some presumed his body to be inseparably fused with the Logos and therefore incorruptible and incapable of physical pain. To the orthodox who believed the Incarnate Christ to be a single entity with two distinct natures, human and divine, the Nestorians and Monophysites were equally heretical, the first party unwilling to accept that Christ was com- pletely divine, the second that he was fully human.37 Orthodox theologians attempted a middle course. They were most consistent in the West, perhaps because their views were sharply and lucidly set forth by Pope Leo in his Tome of 449, a document approved at the Council of Chalcedon in 451 when the official orthodox Dyophysite doctrine was proclaimed.38 The Council of Chalcedon did not prevent continuing controversy and schism. Thus, Justinian, after first reaf- firming the definition of Chalcedon, bowed to Mono- physite pressures in 543, and condemned the Three Chap- ters, the work of three theologians accepted at Chalcedon but suspected by the Monophysites of Nestorian tenden- cies. Persuaded to support this condemnation, Pope Vigi- lius encountered mounting opposition and was compelled to call for an ecumenical council. Meeting in 553, the Coun- cil censured the Three Chapters. The East with its powerful Monophysite faction was reconciled at the expense of the West.39 In 638, intending to facilitate reunion, the emperor Her- aclius issued the Ekthesis.40 It contained a definition of the second person that came to be called the Monothelite doc- 36 In the New Testament, the Messiah is related to the royal line of David. This, his nature as Logos, and the titles identifying him as Lord and Son of God helped give form to the doctrine of Incarnation clarified at the Nicaean and Chalcedon Councils. Mary became Theotokos at the Council of Ephesus in 431, further underlining the significance of the Incarnation: the Virgin became the Mother of the Incarnate Word. God became human so as to make it possible for man to return to him. Hence salvation was seen as dependent on the Incarnation. This idea incorporated and neces- sitated the full humanity and divinity of the Son, and almost from the first the material yet imperishable wood of the Cross of Christ was viewed as proof of Incarnation; the 2nd-century Acts of Saints John and Peter directly conjoin the wood of the Cross, Christ, and the Logos (Acta Jo- hannis, xiii-xIv, in M.R. James, ed., Apocrypha anecdota, Cambridge, 1893, ii, 16f.; Martyrium Petri, viii-ix, R. Lepsius and M. Bonnet, eds., Acta apostolorum, Leipzig, 1891, I, 92, 96). See, further, Athanasius's De Incarnatione verbi, written between 316 and 318 (Pat. gr., xxv, 95-198), which asserts a contiguity of cross and Resurrection and which was influential in shaping the orthodox response to 5th- and 6th-century Christological heresy; FL. Cross, The Study of Athanasius, Oxford, 1945; Hardy, 55-110. 37 For details of the post-Nicaean controversies and the later councils, see G.H.

Camelot, Ephese et Chalcedoine, Paris, 1962. 38 In 433, a creed of union was drawn up to harmonize the Alexandrian and Antiochene positions. This compromise did not long endure, and the Alexandrians, who were profoundly displeased with what seemed to be support for the division of Christ's two natures, began to embrace the extreme Christology of Eutyches (d. 454), the doctrine that Christ pos- sessed but one single, divine nature, with the human absorbed by the divine. (It should be noted that all Monophysites were not Eutychians; the Syrian, Armenian, Coptic, and Ethiopian orthodox Churches rejected Eutyches' position. The Monophysitism of Severus, patriarch of Antioch, for example, held that the incarnate nature of Christ was one, but derived from two natures human and divine in union.) Eutyches was condemned at the Synod of Constantinople in 448, but upheld a year later at the "Robber Council." His teaching was attacked by Leo, who held the papal chair between 440 and 461, in his Tome (Epistola dogmatica; Pat. lat., LIv, 755-782; ed. and trans. H. Bettenson [as in n. 35], 49-51). The the- ology of the Tome incorporated little that was new, but because the pope there effectively established the essential orthodox position that Christ united in one person two natures or substances, it had a profound effect in the West.

The Monothelite view is that while the divine and human are quite distinct in Christ, he was subject to but one will or energy (theolos). Unfortunately, the Ekthesis succeeded in intensifying Dyophysite factionalism. In Rome, the conflict was especially acrimonious and led Pope Martin I to summon a Lateran council in 649. It denounced and rejected the Ekthesis. Seized by Imperial troops, the pontiff died in Crimean exile in 655. But the indecisiveness of his immediate successors on the Three Chapters and re- lated issues did not prevent a schism which lasted until 680, when the emperor Constantine IV summoned the sixth Ecu- menical Council to Constantinople. On 7 November the Council condemned the Monothelite formula. It declared the existence of two wills in Christ, divine and human, to be immutable orthodox doctrine. Only then was Christo- logical division resolved to the benefit of Latin orthodoxy.41 As the material yet imperishable and self-renewing wood of the Instrument of the Passion, the True Cross inevitably became the object of increasing devotion during these cen- turies of Christological dispute. Notwithstanding the dif- ficulties encountered in attempting to discern consistent and significant differences between the Monophysites, Nesto- rians, and orthodox in their treatment of True Cross sym- bolism,42 it is certain that the orthodox viewed the cult as an extension or agent of their theology. Cyril the Great and Pope Leo understood devotion to the wood of the Cross as the physical witness to the Passion, a perpetual proof of the Second Coming and of the Redemption.43 The Cruci- 41 The statement of faith of the Sixth Ecumenical Council reiterated the teaching of Chalcedon, included a recapitulation of the creeds of Nicaea and Constantinople, and emphasized the authority of the five previous ecumenical councils. For text, see Mansi, xi, 631-640. The errors of the past were addressed as follows (Hardy, 383): "We also proclaim two nat- ural willings or wills in him and two natural operations, without sepa- ration, without change, without partition, without confusion, according to the teaching of the holy fathers - and two natural wills not contrary [to each other] .. " On the Monothelite controversy, see G. Every, The Byzantine Patriar- chate, 2nd ed., London, 1962, 55-68; A. Mayer, "Monothelismo," En- cyclopedia cattolica, ed. P. Paschini, et al., viii, 1952, 1319-24. 42 It has been maintained that the Monophysite emphasis on Christ's di- vinity led to their opposition to sacred imagery and their insistence on the use of a plain cross. Recently, S. Brock, "Iconoclasm and the Mono- physites," in Iconoclasm: Papers Given at the Ninth Spring Symposium of Byzantine Studies, University of Birmingham, March 1975, ed. A. Bryer and J. Herrin, Birmingham, 1977, 53-57, has examined this question and found no actual evidence of opposition to the portrayal of Christ. He also found no opposition to the cult of relics. Instead, he discovered textual evidence for both and a number of 6th-, 7th-, and 8th-century Syriac illuminated Gospels, including the famous Rabula Gospels, which seem to be Monophysite creations. M. Mundell, "Monophysite Church Dec- oration," in ibid., 59-74, finds it difficult to distinguish between Chal- cedonian, Monophysite, and Nestorian patronage in the pre-Iconoclastic East, but suggests the possibility of a Monophysite preference for abstract or dogmatic compositions and isolated iconic images (as opposed to nar- rative cycles). It is very difficult to detect overt doctrinal distinctions in all this, except perhaps in Egypt and Armenia. Mundell proposes that the emphasis on Ascension and other theophany imagery in apse conches in areas in these countries may have been prompted by an aversion to il- lustrations of Christ's Passion. This aversion arose from the denial of the corruptibility of his flesh, as emphasized by the followers of the 6th-cen- tury Julianist Monophysite heresy. (For the Armenian response to the Cross cult, see A. Renoux, "La Croix dans le rite armenien: Histoire et sym- bolisme," Melto, v, 1969, 123-175.) The Nestorian insistence on Christ's humanity would seem to support representations of the agony of Christ on the Cross that were too literal for orthodox theologians. And the Nestorians were accused of literal Cross worship rather than worship of the Instrument of Incarnation. However, so little survives of Nestorian art that conclusions cannot be made as to dogmatic distinctions. On surviving Nestorian church decoration, see ibid., 60-61. It is important to recall that apart from a brief period of compromise (479-494), the Patriarchate of Jerusalem remained Chalcedonian, i.e., Melkite. It was the Jerusalem Church that initiated the True Cross cult and viewed the Passion relics and their symbolism as a defense against Christological heresy. 43 Cyril delivered his twenty-four Catecheses of 347 as instructions to the catechumens baptized on Saturday at the Holy Sepulchre. In them, he mentions the True Cross in the context of the material souvenirs of Christ's life on earth as proof of the reality of the Incarnation (Catecheses Iv, 10; x, 19; xiii, 4; Pat. gr., xxxiii, 469, 688, 766). For Leo I, see Epistolae, cxxxix, Pat. lat., LIv, 1108. In his defense of Chalcedonian doctrine, Pope Leo made full reference to the holy places of Palestine. Bishop Juvenal's disregard of the truth of the Incarnation, he believed, flew in the face of the reality of the holy sites. In a letter to Juvenal, he listed the places that were "unassailable proofs of the Catholic faith" - Bethlehem, the Cross, the Tomb, and the Mount of Olives. In the midst of such material evi- dence, he said, Juvenal had no recourse but to embrace orthodox faith. He expressed the same position in a letter to the princess Eudocia; and similar pleas were put forward by the monks at the holy sites.

The evolution of the cycle of Christian feasts corresponds to the increasingly complex interpretation of the life, death, and Resurrection of Christ. Easter, the most ancient of feasts, commemorates the Resurrection; more precisely, it is the feast of the Re- demption made possible by Christ's death and rebirth, the redemption that is the very essence of the mission of the Church. Easter was already being celebrated as the Chris- tian Passover by the second century. But it was not until the fourth century that the Passion and triumph over the grave became paramount. As annual observances in- creased at the historical sites in Palestine, enabling the pious to experience the events of Christ's life where they report- edly took place, dramatic-liturgical triduum services came to be conducted at the site of the Crucifixion.46 A precious witness to the Easter observances is preserved in a journal written in the late fourth or early fifth century by Egeria, most probably a consecrated virgin on a pil- grimage from Galicia, who describes the daily services and a large number of the anniversary services she attended in Jerusalem.47 Her account of the Easter festival includes a memorable record of the ancient Good Friday rite. In the morning a service of veneration of the "sacred wood" began in a chapel or church situated behind the rock of Calvary with its monumental cross: A throne was set up for the bishop on Golgotha behind the cross, which now stands there. The bishop sits on his throne, a table covered with a linen cloth is set up behind him, and the deacons stand around the table. The gilded silver casket containing the sacred wood of the cross is brought in and opened. Both the wood of the cross and the inscription are taken out and placed on the table ... The whole congregation, natives and pilgrims, baptized and catechumens, "pass by one by one: all of them bow down, 44 Before the Iconoclastic Controversy, the most conspicuous example of the doctrinal position of the church on images and symbols is the doc- ument issued by the Trullan Synod held in 692 to finish the work of the Fifth and Sixth General Councils (hence its other identification as the "Quinisext" Council). Its canon 73 refers to the "life-giving cross" as the instrument of salvation; Mansi, xi, 929-1006. From the orthodox point of view, the sacredness of the Cross was threatened by both Monophysite and Nestorian heresy. The orthodox believed both doctrines deprecated the Instruments of the Passion, and, certainly, they were always disposed to panegyrize them. The eighty-second canon of the Trullan Synod dealt with the symbolic representations of Christ as lamb. Such images, it said, were to be replaced by anthropomorphic depictions so as to increase perception of the In- carnation, Passion, and the redemption his death made possible. Although here the Synod is prescribing Christ in human form, its references to the use of such imagery apply equally to True Cross scenes and symbols: to make manifest the Incarnation of the Word. Again, it is important to emphasize the orthodox perception of such usage as a defense against heretical views. See Kitzinger (as in n. 17). 45 Undoubtedly for this reason, the True Cross came to be associated di- rectly with the sanctification of the great Christological councils: on the walls of the nave of the church of the Nativity, Bethlehem, are mosaics restored in the 12th century that may originate in the period between 680 and 787. In fragmentary fashion, the cycle - introducing texts above altars and between arcades in architectural settings separated by elaborate foliate designs - pictures twelve councils. Six ecumenical councils are depicted on the south wall; there are six provincial councils on the north wall. Together, they systematically enumerate the church councils con- cerned with the definition of the second person of the Trinity and related Christological matters - almost a setting out of the Nicene Creed. A large cross once appeared at the center of each wall. That on the north wall can still be seen, a Crux gemmata with round knobs at the top of each beam. Perhaps pomegranates, the knobs may symbolize celestial nour- ishment. Flanked by two trees, the Bethlehem cross is without doubt the "life-giving" True Cross intended to evoke associations with the Tree of Life, the relic of the Crucifixion, and the monumental jeweled cross of Golgotha. Intentionally and unmistakably, the Bethlehem cross emblems were viewed as the insignia of the orthodox Christology brought forward in the canons of the great councils. Each council at Bethlehem is represented by a schematic evocation of the church in which it took place, with the name of the city above the roof. The Gospels are displayed on an altar beneath a baldachino. Com- plex "pillars" of vases, Sassanid wings, foliage, jewels, or acanthus leaves appear between the church representations. See H. Stern, "Les Represen- tations des conciles dans l'Fglise de la Nativite a Bethlkem, i," Byzantion, xI, 1936, 101-152; idem, "II: Les Inscriptions," ibid., xiII, 1938, 415-459; idem, "Nouvelles Recherches sur les images des conciles dans l'Yglise de la Nativit ~A Bethlkem," Cahiers archeologiques, 1I1, 1948, 82-105; idem, "Encore les mosaiques de l'Yglise de la Nativit ~a Bethl~em," ibid., ix, 1957, 141-145; Grabar (as in n. 10), 48-61; Walter, 70-77. Stern argues for a 7th-century date for the six provincial synods on the north wall and a 12th-century date for the seven ecumenical councils on the south wall. Mundell (as in n. 42), 66-67, questions the earlier dating on the grounds that the inscriptions on the north wall have characteristics too late for the 7th or 8th century. In any event, the formula for representing the councils of the church employed at Bethlehem was current in pre-Iconoclastic Constantinople. In the tetrapylon known as the Milion, the vault was decorated with mo- saics of the six Ecumenical Councils and contained an image of Constan- tine and Helena holding a patriarchal cross. In 716 a related arrangement was used in the narthex of St. Peter's, Rome; and in 766-767, in the Church of St. Peter's, Naples. See R. Janin, Constantinople byzantine, Paris, 1964, 103; Grabar (as in n. 10), 48-50, 155-156; Walter, 14-16, 20-25. Also worthy of attention is a miniature in the 10th-century Menologium of Basil II (Bibl. Apost. Vatic., Gr. MS 1613, fol. 108), which depicts one of the two councils of Nicaea (most likely the Second Council of 787), with the company witnessing the obeisance of a heretic between two groups of bishops. At the center is an altar upon which stands a double-barred cross-reliquary. See Frolow, 1961, 222; Walter, 37-38, frontispiece. Then too, the sessions of the eighth Ecumenical Council of 869, which met at Hagia Sophia, Constantinople, were sanctified by the presence of frag- ments of the True Cross; Mansi, xvi, 309-321. 46 As the principal feast of the Christian liturgical year, Easter, the annual anniversary of the Resurrection - the central event in the unfolding of the Redemption - occupied a unique position. Even Christmas was seen to be preparation for Easter. Toward the end of the 4th century in Jeru- salem, Good Friday and Easter Day became kept as separate commem- orations of the Holy Week triduum, or, as Saint Augustine said, it is the sacratissimum tridum crucifixi, sepulti suscitati (Epistolarum classis, Lv. 24; Pat. lat., xxxIII, 215).

At midday they moved into the spacious courtyard between the cross and the Anastasis. The bish- op's chair was placed "Before the cross" and the readings and prayers began. Psalms and verses from Paul's Epistles and from Matthew, Mark, and Luke on Jesus's suffering were read. At the hour of Christ's death, John's description of Jesus "giving up the ghost" was declaimed.48 The synax of Good Friday can be found in documents dating to the fifth century. Oldest is an Armenian lection- ary of ca. 460, where the Jerusalem Good Friday observ- ance is given in detail.49 Closely related to this Good Friday service is the double consecration of the Dedication of the Holy Sepulchre and the Finding of the Holy Cross. The last feast described by Egeria, the Feast of Dedication,so50 appears for 14 September in the Armenian Lectionary,51 and was the foundation for the later Cross feasts, the "Exaltatio S. Crucis" and the "Inventio S. Crucis." The first of these con- tinues to fall on 14 September, though after 629 its em- phasis shifted to the recovery of the True Cross by Her- aclius; commemorated on 3 May, the second celebrates Helena's recovery of the Passion relics.52 As Egeria's circumstantial account demonstrates, the lo- cal Jerusalem Easter rite with its Good Friday Adoratio cru- cis was known in the West by the early fifth century. The Ordines Romani suggest that by 700, and perhaps earlier, probably due to the influence of pilgrims returning from Jerusalem, the Good Friday veneration ceremony had be- come part of Holy Week services in Rome.53 In the early Middle Ages, on the great festival days, and on certain other days, the pope went in procession from the Lateran Palace to one of the city basilicas for pontifical mass. The chosen basilica was designated the station for the day. The Good Friday procession began with the pontiff entering the Chapel of Sancta Sanctorum adjoining the Lateran, re- moving a True Cross reliquary from a chest beneath the altar, and solemnly proceeding on to the basilica of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem at the Palatium Sessorianum, where a fragment of the sacred wood had been deposited by Saint Helena long before. Strikingly representational elements mark the subsequent Adoratio. Two deacons stand behind the covered cross. Treating it as the original Crucifixion Cross, they introduce "reproaches" supposedly spoken by the dying Savior to the ungrateful Jews. Priest and choir respond as a sort of tragic chorus.54 The cross is uncovered and the hymn Pange lingua, written by Ven- antius Fortunatus in 569 to celebrate the arrival at Poitiers 48 Gingras, 110-113. The 6th-century pilgrim Anthony of Piacenza also makes reference to this ceremony; cf. P. Geyer, "Antonini Placentini iti- nerarium," in Itineraria, 139. 49 On the Armenian Lectionary, see A. Renoux, Le Codex arminien Je- rusalem 121; Pat. or., xxv-xxxvi, Turnhout, 1969-71; Wilkinson, 1981, 253f.; Hunt, 253-261. The most important later documents are the Gre- gorian Kanonarion of the Jerusalem liturgy of ca. 631-638 and the 9th- or 10th-century Typicon of Jerusalem for Holy Week and Easter Week; G. Kretschmar, "Die friihe Geschichte der Jerusalemer Liturgie," Jahrbuch fiir Liturgik und Hymnologie, II, 1956, 22-46. The Good Friday observance is not mentioned in the Georgian Ka- nonarion. It has been suggested that the rite came to an end in Jerusalem after the Persian attack in 614. Although it has left no trace on the official books of the Byzantine rite, it does appear in the liturgy of the Jacobites and Maronites; cf. Baumstark, 86, 142-144; Frolow, 1961, 163-164. 50 The dedication of Constantine's Golgotha complex (the Encaenia) and the Invention of the Cross were celebrated at the same time in the years of Egeria's arrival in Jerusalem. Not long after this, a formal veneration of the True Cross relics was introduced for 14 Sept. See Hunt, 39. For Egeria's reference to the Encaenia, see Gingras, 126-128. Unfortunately, it is here (chap. 49) that her text ends in incomplete fashion. 51 F.C.

Mohlberg, i, Rome, 1948, 379-406; Gingras, 157, n. 180. m The oldest document describing the ceremonial of the pope's stational mass is Ordo romanus i (containing the principal services for Holy Week and Easter), which was composed in the late 7th century. The text makes it clear that the presbyters of Rome, after assembling before noon on Good Friday at S. Croce - the inevitable station of the day and the repository of a fragment of the True Cross - and taking part in a service, returned to their own titular churches, and in the afternoon, beside repeating other of the ceremonies witnessed in the presence of the pontiff, celebrated the Veneration of the Cross; cf. Duchesne, 154-156; Andrieu, II, 65-112; idem, Le Pontifical romain au Moyen-Age, i, Rome, 1938, 234-237; Willis, 16-20. The reference to the Adoratio crucis in Ordo I is very brief. A more complete description of the ceremony is found in the famous 10th-century Regularis concordia of Saint Aethelwold: because the Roman rite does not permit the consecration of the sacred host on Good Friday itself, the host is consecrated on the previous day. On Friday, following the Passion according to Saint John and a series of special oratories, the Adoratio crucis begins. It opens with the Improperia. Two deacons carry the cross before the altar and intone the reproaches of Christ. Two subdeacons respond in Greek, the choir in Latin. After the first of the responses, the cross is placed on a cushion. Its removal signals three antiphons and Ve- nantius Fortunatus's hymn Pange lingua. The abbot and some members of the choir then prostrate themselves before the cross and sing seven penitential psalms. Finally, the cross is kissed by the participants. For text and commentary, see Dom T. Symons, Regularis concordia, London, 1953, 41-46 and passim. Also interesting is Ordo xxiii (Einsiedeln, Stiftsbibl. Ms 326), a descrip- tion of the Good Friday veneration ceremony by an 8th-century Frankish priest. He observed a procession with the cross reliquary to S. Croce, the prostration, the lections, and the kissing of the Cross; cf. Andrieu, III, 265-273; Duchesne, 501-504; Chavasse, 88-91.

The Gregorian Sacramentary of Padua (ca. 625-638) has a ceremony of cross veneration;57 and the Ex- altation feast as such is mentioned during the pontificate of Sergius (687-701).58 The Lectionary of Silos (ca. 650) has a 3 May "Inventio" feast; Gallican and Gregorian seventh- and eighth-century sacramentaries also list the festival.59 The "Inventio crucis" cited in a seventh-century Neapolitan capitulary will be of particular interest here.60 The Insular Context There is reason to believe that the True Cross cult was introduced to Britain at an early date. In a small treasure of coins discovered in the last century in the churchyard of St. Martin's, Canterbury, was found a gold medalet with a portrait and the inscription "LEVARDVS EP(ISCOPU)S" on the obverse and a patriarchal cross set on a half-circular base on the reverse (Fig. 10).61 The inscription identifies Bishop Liudhard, chaplain to Queen Bertha, the daughter of Saint Radegund's stepson Charibert, the king of Paris. The Frankish princess Bertha had married Ethelbert, king of Kent, during the second half of the sixth century and some years before Pope Gregory sent Augustine to Can- terbury in 597 to convert the pagan Saxons.62 Bede tells us that Ethelbert agreed to allow Bertha to practice her faith and that she did so in the Church of St. Martin, a church standing since Roman times.63 The presence of the Liudhard medalet in the Canterbury treasure is explained by the un- doubted use of the churchyard as a burial ground for the tiny Christian community of Canterbury. Modern scholarship suggests the medalet was made at Canterbury itself. It may have been intended for presen- tation to a supporter of Bertha's infant church or perhaps was meant as an Easter offering. In any event, although parallels have been found in Continental coinage for the obverse portrait,64 there exists no convincing numismatic precedent for the patriarchal cross design before the time of the minting of early eighth-century coins of Justinian II. In light of Bertha's family connection to Saint Radegund, the extremely rare use of the patriarchal cross in the West in the sixth century (the Canterbury medalet being the only surviving Latin example), and Liudhard's ecclesiastical sta- tus, it is very possible that the medalet may have been in- tended to refer to the patriarchal cross emblem on the re- liquary sent to Radegund from Constantinople in 569. Be that as it may, the cross on the medalet was surely meant as a Christian symbol. Given that Bishop Liudhard died several years after the arrival of the Augustinian mission (d. 602), the nascent Kentish Church must have been aware of the meaning of the double-barred cross and had some appreciation of its complex religious associations.65 Veneration of the Cross acquired wide currency during 5s Venantius Fortunatus wrote three hymns on the Cross: Crux benedicta nitet (Venanti. . . Fortunati. . . opera poetica; F. Leo, ed., M.G.H., Auct. antiq. iv [1), 27); Pange lingua gloriosi (ibid., 27-28); and Vexilla regis prodeunt (ibid., 34-35). He also wrote a poetic letter to the emperor Justin II in which the Inventio legend is mentioned: Ad Justinium et Sophiam Augustos (ibid., 211). In Crux benedicta, the cross is called the Tree of Life. In Pange lingua, the necessity of Redemption is emphasized, the Tree of Salvation in the Garden mentioned, and Incarnation-Nativity-Passion-Crucifixion brought forward as the crucial events underlying Redemption. Vexilla regis dwells on Christ's sacrifice and presents the Savior in intimate relation to his cross. See J. Sz6verffy, " 'Crux Fidelis .. .': Prolegomena to a History of the Holy Cross Hymns," Traditio, xxII, 1966, 6-12. 56 T. Klauser, A Short History of the Western Liturgy, London, 1968, 78- 81, has suggested that the addition of the veneration ceremony to the Good Friday rite of the Roman liturgy is the result of Franco-Germanic reforms introduced after the time of Pope Gregory. However, as Baum- stark, 101-02, points out, it seems probable that much Eastern influence on the stational liturgy occurred in the 6th and 7th centuries when several Eastern popes occupied the Apostolic See. Then, too, Chavasse, 90, 96, and Hardison (as in n. 54), 131, n. 120, cite evidence of 6th- or early 7th- century elements in the early Ordines as proof of the Roman employment of the Adoratio crucis before 700. 57 K.

Eastern ecclesiastics such as Theodore of Tarsus and pilgrims returning from Rome undoubtedly brought word of the cult. Important texts were introduced. For example, in 633, at Heavenfield, Oswald of Northumbria, taking as his guide the story of Constan- tine's vision, erected a great wooden cross and prayed for the assistance of God and Saint Columba before engaging the enemy. The wood of his cross was subsequently thought to work miracles." In his paraphrase of Paulinus of Nola's life of Saint Felix, Bede gives an account of an incident when Paulinus put out a fire by throwing a "splinter of the Lord's cross on the flames."67 And the legend of the Cross engaged Bede. He adopted the Pseudo-Chrysostom's idea (based on Isaiah 40) that the Passion Cross was made of cyprus, cedar, pine, and boxwood;68 he recognized the lig- num vitae as the Old Testament ancestor of the Cross,69 and noted its fragrance and apotropaic powers.70 The origin of the North English free-standing rectangular stone crosses has long been in dispute, but undoubtedly the type owes much to free-standing wooden crosses such as the Heavenfield Cross. More than a thousand of the rec- tangular stone crosses survive, most from Northumbria.n Among the earliest are the famous Ruthwell Cross, Dum- fries (Fig. 11), and the Bewcastle Cross in Cumberland.7 66 Oswald had been in exile in Iona where he had carefully studied "the teachings of the Scottish church." Later he sent to Iona for the mission Aidan was to head at Lindisfarne; Bede, H.E., III, 1-3, ed. Plummer I, 127-133; H. Moisl, "The Bernician Royal Dynasty and the Irish in the Seventh Century," Peritia, II, 1983, 103-126. There may have been a tra- dition of erected wooden crosses on Iona before the 7th century since Adomnan refers to such crosses as existing in the late 6th or early 7th century; Vita Columbae, I, 45; III, 23, ed. A.O. and M.O. Anderson, Adomnan's Life of Columba, Edinburgh and London, 1961, 307, 523. For Bede's account of the Battle of Haevenfield, see H.E., in, 2, ed. Plummer, I, 128-131. See also J.C. Winnell, "Iona and Lindisfarne," Irish Ecclesiastical Record, Lxxx, 1953, 106-114.

Lyon, "A Reappraisal of the Sceatta and Styca Coinage of Northumbria," British Numismatic Journal, xxviiin, 1955-57, 227-242. This Constantinian vision of the cross as a cosmic sign in union with sun, moon, and stars seems to have held particular interest for the Anglo-Saxons. For example, the story may be reflected in the account of one of the nuns seeing a glowing cross carried by angels in the sky following the death of Hilda of Whitby; An Old English Martyrology, ed. G. Herzfeld, London, 1900, 206-208. Moreover, at Jarrow, a 7th-century slab cross carries an inscription (In hoc singulari signo vita redditur mundo) whose first four words are identical with Ru- finus's account of the inscription on the monument commemorating Con- stantine's vision of the Cross.

Primarily on the basis of the runes, the meter, and language of The Dream of the Rood, a con- sensus has developed supporting the creation of the crosses in the half century between 700 and 750.

Fenwick, Hexham) These and related examples employ vine-scroll and vine- tree panels (sometimes with animals), which almost cer- tainly allude to the Tree of Life.73 Specific reference to the "wood of life" is inscribed on the Ruthwell Cross. Engraved in runes in the margins of the narrow side panels displaying inhabited vine scrolls is a portion of the Anglo-Saxon poem, The Dream of the Rood, in which the Cross of Christ, "the sacred tree," speaks as witness to the Crucifixion. The broad principal faces of the shaft are carved with figural subjects surrounded by Latin inscriptions. It is generally accepted that the runes are part of the original scheme, a program of remarkable iconographic complexity,74 in which eremetic ideals, among others, of the solitude of the desert and of the contempla- tive life are emphasized.75 In The Dream Christ reigns from a treow of gold covered with gems. It is the Tree of Life of Eden and the "tree" of Golgotha.76 Recent scholarship has connected this imagery with cultic practice. B.C. Raw interprets the opening vision as describing a scene in which the Cross is watched by the whole of creation, a scene inspired by Palestinian True Cross iconography; and A.E. Mahler suggests that the vi- sion is an evocation of a cross-shaped reliquary containing a fragment of the sacred wood.77 E.6 Carrigiiin also asserts that the erection of the Ruthwell Cross was in part inspired by a response to the importance attached to the Feast of 73Cf. D.H. Wright, The Vespasian Psalter, Copenhagen, 1967, 66, n. 4; K.P. Maxwell-Hyslop, "The Assyrian Tree of Life," in To Illustrate the Monuments: Essays on Archaeology Presented to Stuart Piggott on the Occasion of His Sixty-fifth Birthday, London, 1976, 264-275. Variants of the basic vine-tree design of two running scrolls growing out of a base frequently appear in 7th- and 8th-century Northumbrian art. John identifies Christ with the vine (John 15: 1-5), and in patristic literature the vine became equated with or closely related to the Tree of Life. On this, see J. Danielou, Primitive Christian Symbols, Baltimore, 1964, 25-40; Underwood, 43-138; Frolow, 1965, 178-186. 74 The Dream of the Rood exists in two versions: a long rendition of about 150 lines preserved in the 10th-century Vercelli Book, and the brief pas- sages on the Ruthwell Cross (corresponding to lines 39-41, 44-45, 48-49, and 62-64 in Vercelli). For the Vercelli text, see Swanton (as in n. 72), 89-97; for the manuscript, see G.P. Krapp, The Vercelli Book, New York, 1932. 75 Cf. F. Saxl, "The Ruthwell Cross," Journal of the Warburg and Cour- tauld Institutes, vi, 1943, 1-19; M. Schapiro, "The Religious Meaning of the Ruthwell Cross," Art Bulletin, xxvi, 1944, 232-245; R.J. Cramp, "The Evangelist Symbols and Their Parallels in Anglo-Saxon Sculpture," in Bede and Anglo-Saxon England [see Sources], 118-30; Farrell (as in n. 72), 97-117. 76 The latter sections of the poem bring forward the idea of the Tree of Life in Eden. The Tree in The Dream acquires the healing and life-giving powers that the Bible gives to the tree that grows from the river of life (Swanton Dream [as in n. 72], 83-91). The central sections of the poem where the tree recounts the story of the Crucifixion emphasize the idea of the Tree of Life as the Golgotha Cross (ibid., 28-77). The Ruthwell inscription comes from section two, that is, from the central account of the death of Christ, and is often described as the core poem. 77 Raw, 239-253. A.E. Mahler, "Lignum Domini and the Opening Vision of The Dream of the Rood: A Viable Hypothesis?" Speculum, LIII, 1978, 441-459, proposes the poem was possibly composed to celebrate King Alfred's acquisition of a fragment of the True Cross in 885, and thus he dates both the poem and the Ruthwell Cross more than a hundred years later than most other scholars.</page><page sequence="20">THE CROSS-CARPET PAGE IN THE BOOK OF DURROW 193 Exaltation following upon Pope Sergius's miraculous dis- covery of a relic of the Cross of Crucifixion in the basilica of St. Peter's in 70178 - the very year Ceolfrid sent a mis- sion to the pontiff to secure the privileges for Wearmouth- Jarrow that Pope Agatho had earlier granted to Benedict Biscop.79 Developments in contemporary Christology have also been considered especially relevant.80 Rosemary Woolf ar- gues for an interpretation of the core poem of The Dream (essentially the Crucifixion episode minus later additions) as a judiciously orthodox delineation of Christ's divided nature, balancing the image of Christ as transcendentally triumphant against that of a sentient being in agony on the Cross. The poem, Woolf suggests, was composed with an awareness of heresy as a burning issue. It was, in part, a response to Nestorian and Monophysite ideas.81 The English clergy was in an unusually good position to follow the Christological debates closely. Wilfrid and Ben- edict Biscop, the first English pilgrims to Rome, probably arrived in 654 at the height of the Monothelite troubles.82 Pope Eugenius was consecrated that year, not long after Emperor Constans II used the exarch of Ravenna to capture Pope Martin and send him into Crimean exile." Benedict soon returned to England, but Wilfrid remained for many months in Rome absorbed in biblical exegesis and un- doubtedly exposed to intense Dyophysite argumentation. On his fourth journey to Rome in 678 (accompanied by Ceolfrid, who was to become abbot of Jarrow and teacher of Bede), Benedict received Pope Agatho's permission to return to his homeland with John, archcantor of St. Peter's and abbot of St. Martin's, with the purpose of having John teach Gregorian music and the Roman monastic office to 78 0 Carrigain, 131-147, believes the iconographic plan of the Ruthwell Cross is best understood in relation to the liturgy of the Feast of Annun- ciation on 25 March, a date that marks the anniversary of the Crucifixion, and separate from the celebration of the movable Feast of Good Friday. The erection of the Cross itself he suggests as dependent upon the liturgical consequences of Sergius's discovery. Recently, 0 Carrigain, "The Ruth- well Cross and Irish High Crosses: Some Points of Comparison and Con- trast," in M. Ryan, ed., Ireland and Insular Art A.D. 500-1200, Dublin, 1987, 118, proposed both the second half of the Ruthwell poem and the iconography of the west face of the Cross as containing "clear references to the liturgical ceremony at the ninth hour on Good Friday, the moment of Christ's death." 79 Bede, H.A., viI, viII, xv, xxI-xxIII, ed. Plummer, I, 307, 379, 385-386. Bede paraphrased the Liber pontificalis account of Sergius's find in the chronicle attached to De temporum ratione under the year 701 (Pat. lat., xc, 569). Besides The Dream, there are two Old English poems in which ven- eration of the Cross is clearly exhibited: Cynewulf's Elene, a narrative of Helena's discovery of the True Cross (Elene, ed. P.O.E. Gradon, London, 1958) and The Last Judgment, one of three parts (Advent, Ascension, Last Judgment) of Christ, in which the Crucifixion plays a prominent role (The Christ of Cynewulf, ed. A.S. Cook, Boston, 1900; repr. with prefatory note by J.C. Pope, Hamden, CT, 1964). See also J.H. Wilson, Christian Theology and Old English Poetry, The Hague and Paris, 1974, 141-180. The theme of the Elene narrative is the discovery of the True Cross, and it has long been recognized that the poem depends on the Vita Qui-- ricci, a version of which appears in the Acta sanctorum for 4 March; cf. Gradon, ed. (as above), 15-22; C.A. Regan, "Evangelicalism as the In- forming Principle of Cynewulf's 'Elene,' " Traditio, xxix, 1973, 27-52. 80 It is necessary to point out that early debates over heretical doctrines and issues not strictly Christological may have had an impact on Chris- tological discussion. Arianism and Pelagianism may have made some con- verts among early British Christians; cf. Gildas, De excidio et conquesta Brittaniae, xII, ed. J.A. Giles, Six Old English Chronicles, London, 1848; F.C. Conybeare, "The Character of the Heresy of the Early British Church," Transactions of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion, 1897-98, 84- 177. The Easter Controversy was probably even more relevant. In the 6th and 7th centuries the Celtic churches of Britain and Ireland discovered that they were not completely in accord with Roman practice. Especially troublesome was the question of the date of Easter, the Romans cele- brating the date by one system, the Celts by another, so that Easter did not fall on the same day for each group. Some within the Roman Church viewed compliance as a matter of faith and charged the Celts with being schismatics and heretics. The Roman position depended upon the rulings of the Council of Nicaea, and although the Easter date in itself was not a Christological issue, some of the Romani began to associate orthodox calculation with Nicaean orthodoxy. Bede (H.E., III, 25, ed. Plummer, i, 181-189) in his account of the Synod of Whitby emphasizes the extent to which the Roman party regarded conformity as a matter of belief. See C.W. Jones, Bedae opera de temporibus, Cambridge, Mass., 1943, 6-104; K. Hughes, "The English Church and the Papacy," in The English Church and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages, ed. C.H. Lawrence, London, 1965, 1-28; idem, The Church in Early Irish Society, Ithaca, 1966, 103- 110; L. Hardinge, The Celtic Church in Britain, London, 1972, 17-28. Computatio was not the only issue dividing the two churches. There was a sharp difference in the appearance of the clerical tonsure - a var- iance of great significance to this study. The exact appearance of the Celtic tonsure (the "tonsure of Saint John") is not absolutely certain, but its form seems to have permitted long hair from the top of the head down the back, while the front of the head from a line drawn from ear to ear was partially shaved, that is, allowed to grow short or kept as stubble. For the Romans, tonsure meant shaving a round area at the crown of the head; cf. J. Dowden, "An Examination of Original Documents on the Question of the Form of the Celtic Tonsure," Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, xxx, 1895, 325-327; M. Joynt, "Tonsure," Eriu, x, 1928, 130-134. See, further, "Excursus on the Paschal Controversy and Tonsure," in Bede, H.E., ed. Plummer, I, 348-354; and n. 218 below. It has also been suggested that the Celtic foundations may have con- ducted Mass only on Sundays and festival days, in contrast to the Romani who had daily Mass; cf. Mayr-Harting, 103-105, 161-164. 81 R. Woolf, "Doctrinal Influences on The Dream of the Rood," Medium Aevum, xxviii, 1958, 37-53. 82 Bede, H.E., v, 19, ed. Plummer, I, 321-332. 83 The Monothelite threat at mid-century coincides with an increased in- terest displayed by the Roman Church in the relic of the True Cross - probably as a result of the tragic events surrounding the Persian attack on Jerusalem in 614, and the theft, recovery, and removal to Constan- tinople of the principal relic of the Cross, followed by the Arab conquest of Palestine. These events may be reflected in the iconography of the eastern apse mosaic in S. Stefano Rotondo, Rome, most probably com- missioned by Pope Theodore I (642-649), a native of Jerusalem. A jeweled cross surmounted by an imago clipeata of Christ, set in the meadow of Paradise and flanked by the martyrs, Saints Primus and Felicianus, is pictured. Called to mind is both the jeweled cross that for centuries stood on Calvary and the Cross and busts of Christ in the Crucifixion scenes of the Palestinian ampules. The martyrs - two victims of Diocletian's persecutions - may have been intended to symbolize the Christians who died for the Cross and certainly recall the pilgrims adoring the Cross on the ampules. The architect of S. Stefano used the Anastasis of the Holy Sepulchre as a model (cf. R.

Significantly, John was also to report to the Holy See on the orthodoxy of the Church in Britain with regard to the Monothelite heresy."4 In 679, in preparation for the Ecumenical Council to be convened in Constantinople the following year and wishing to dispel any doubts concerning the strength of Western orthodoxy, the pope called for a synod of Western bishops to prepare a resolution against the Monothelites. Wilfrid and the archbishop of Canterbury, Theodore, were to at- tend. The former was able to represent the English Church at the synod but Theodore found it impossible to come to Rome. It is noteworthy that the pontiff, in a letter to the Council, expressed deep regret at Theodore's absence, for he wished to employ the archbishop, who had grown up in the Greek East, the center of Christological controversy, as his representative in Constantinople.85 Nevertheless, Theodore was able to declare Chalcedon- ian orthodoxy by summoning a pan-national assembly to Hatfield in 680. John the Archcantor, who had spent the previous year at Wearmouth instructing the monks in Ro- man practice and in preparing a copy of Pope Martin's Lat- eran Council documents of 649, was present as the papal legate. The delegates condemned the Monophysite and Nestorian doctrines and declared themselves in support of the papal documents clarifying Dyophysite Christology.86 Later, in 685, Theodore once again convoked a council, the Synod of Canterbury, to affirm British orthodoxy.87 With- out doubt, Theodore, the representative chosen to lead the papal delegation to Constantinople in 680, and John the Archcantor, the papal guardian of adherence to Chalce- donian views, must have expressed their views on Chris- tology. Echoes of these concerns appear in Bede's writings, where arguments and explications based on the antiher- etical discourses of the Church fathers are enumerated.A In late seventh-century Britain, the level of emotion roused by thought of Christological heresy must have been high. Thus, seventh-century Britain witnessed a growth of the cult of the Cross and a concomitant effort to declare Chris- tological orthodoxy. The Irish, of course, had no Bede to record a similar history, but we must suppose that some knowledge of the cult and of doctrinal conflict came to them through early contact with the British Church. The schools of Theodore and Hadrian were in touch with Wearmouth-Jarrow and the northern renaissance. After Lindisfarne was founded in 635, the Irish contributed to and drew upon Northumbrian achievements. There was much scholarly interaction.89 Aldhelm, for example, the most brilliant of the pupils trained at Canterbury, com- plained of the large numbers of Englishmen who preferred Irish monastic schools to their own.90 The Irish may also have learned of the Cross cult and of Christological heresy in Rome, for there is evidence, albeit tenuous, of Irish pil- grims in Rome from the sixth century onward.91 Perhaps the most reliable witness to the knowledge the Irish may have acquired of the True Cross cult before the mid-seventh century is provided by the story of Saint Col- umbanus. The saint had made his way to the Frankish king- dom by ca. 590. In 612 he was in Milan in the Lombard duchy, where Duke Agilulf offered him the solitary site of Bobbio in the Apennines. Here Columbanus founded the monastery of St. Columba. Abbot for only three years, he died in 615.92 Bobbio's remote mountain location and the great distance that separated it from its founder's native country did not prevent contact with Irish centers. Col- umbanus had come from the monastery of Bangor, and two ancient Bangor manuscripts, the famous Antiphonary and 84 Cf. Eddius, Vita Wilfridi, ed. B.

Specifically documented is the embassy sent to Rome in connection with the Easter Controversy, which arrived in time for the Easter celebration of 631. The delegation was sent to the Holy See following a letter from Pope Honorius exhorting the Irish to change their system of calculation (ca. 629), and the subse- quent Irish synod on the issue. Upon the return of the delegation from Rome, the southern half of Ireland accepted the Roman system for cal- culating the Easter date. See J.

In several instances, these ampules are re- plicas of those from the treasure of St. John the Baptist at Monza.94 Tradition identifies the sixteen tin-lead and twenty-six glass ampules and a number of earthenware medallions at Monza as the gift of Pope Gregory the Great (d. 604) to Theodolinda, the wife of Agilulf, Columbanus's benefactor. Presumably the bequest was presented to the Church of St. John when Theodolinda founded and en- dowed it ca. 595. Most probably the Bobbio ampullae were similarly transferred to the St. Columba monastery in 612.95 The Monza earthenware medallions contained dust from the Holy Land and are stamped with Greek inscriptions and a variety of scenes from the life of Christ. The Monza and Bobbio ampules contained holy oil and display inscriptions that refer to "Oil of the Wood [Tree] of Life of the Holy Places of Christ." That the ampules were sanctified by con- tact with the sacred wood is demonstrated in a passage by the sixth-century Piacenza pilgrim.96 On Mt. Golgotha he witnessed an impressive ceremony: In the courtyard of the basilica is a small room where they keep the Wood of the Cross. We venerated it with a kiss. The title is also there which they placed over the Lord's head, on which they wrote "This is the king of the Jews." This I have seen, and had it in my hand and kissed it. The Wood of the Cross comes from the nut- tree. At the moment when the Cross is brought out of this small room for veneration, and arrives in the court to be venerated, a star appears in the sky, and comes over the place where they lay the Cross. It stays over- head whilst they are venerating the Cross, and they offer oil to be blessed in little flasks. When the mouth of one of the little flasks touches the Wood of the Cross, the oil instantly bubbles over, and unless it is closed very quickly it all spills out.97 Associated with the local Palestinian ceremonies of Ex- altation and Veneration, the ampules were thought to have healing powers, to confer a blessing (eulogia) on the owner, and to ensure his safe journey home.98 Though varied, the iconography of the scenes stamped on the tiny flagons is principally concerned with the pil- grims' itinerary of the landmarks of theophany: the Nativ- ity, Baptism, Crucifixion, Resurrection, and Ascension. A cross enclosed within an arch, possibly a reference to a building next to (or above) the Golgotha Cross, or to an arch above it, or to the relic itself, often decorates the necks or sides of the flasks. Most interesting is the testimony of the Crucifixion scenes. All are highly abstract images, man- ifestly intended to evoke ideas of the relic of the Cross, the great replica erected on Golgotha, and cultic rites rather than the Gospel narrative. In some instances, Christ ap- pears as a bust at the center or above the Cross. The thieves, the sun, and the moon are at the sides. Sometimes the Cross is shown as composed of palm trunks, the crux florida. A number of scenes display the Cross with a clearly marked titulus rising above Calvary hill from which issue the four rivers of Paradise. Kneeling and adoring figures surround the hill, possibly soldiers but more probably supplicants of the lignum vitae. Here the symbolism is that of the Jeru- salem ceremony of Veneration in which, as we recall from Egeria and the Piacenza pilgrim, the cross fragments and titulus figure dramatically. One of the most iconographi- cally complex of the scenes is stamped on Bobbio ampule no. 2 (Fig. 12).99 Twelve Apostles surround a central en- throned Christ in a mandorla filled with stars and sup- ported by two angels. The group is set above a crux florida with prominent titulus, which stands on Golgotha with its four rivers and four symmetrically placed adoring angels. The image maker has in this instance combined the forms of the Tree of Life and patriarchal cross and then juxta- posed this crux florida and Christ in Majesty.100 The visible relic of the True Cross is associated with an image of the invisible deity. Besides Theodolinda's gifts mentioned above, the Monza treasury contains another work of import, a pectoral cross- reliquary composed of a cross-shaped gold encolpion whose face is formed of a polished crystal plaque within a pearled 93 For the Antiphonary of Bangor (Milan, Bibl.

All references are to Grabar's num- bering of ampules. 100 In Early Christian times there were two principal ways in which the Cross was shown to be the "life-giving" Tree of Life. The first is seen on the north wall of the church of the Nativity, Bethlehem. Here, as men- tioned earlier (see n. 45), the gemmed cross with raised knobs (celestial rosettes or pomegranates) is flanked by two paradisiacal trees symbolizing the Tree of Life in the midst of the Garden (Genesis 2:9); cf. Kitzinger (as in n. 33), 8-10. The second method of representing the Cross as the Tree of Life displays the Cross as a living tree trunk, usually the trunk of a date palm (as on Bobbio ampule no. 1: Grabar, 1958, 33, pl. xxxII). See Underwood, 101; Fleming, 1969 (as in n. 22), 89f.</page><page sequence="23">196 THE ART BULLETIN JUNE 1990 VOLUME LXXII NUMBER 2 border (Fig. 13). On the reverse of both the gold case and outer plaque are foliate designs clearly symbolizing the Tree of Life, this because the crystal face is placed over a niello plaque with an image of the Crucifixion. A patriarchal cross on a base of foliate forms and steps is engraved on the reverse of the plaque and surrounds the recessed container for the sliver of the sacred wood. This is another reference to the relic cult and the monumental cross standing on Gol- gotha. Pope Gregory had a penchant for sending Holy Land souvenirs and relics to barbarian rulers, and the Monza reliquary may be such a gift.101 A cross reliquary is recorded as dispatched by the pontiff to Adaloald, Theodolinda's son, on the occasion of his baptism in 603.102 If we accept the strong possibility that the Monza pectoral reliquary was in Milan in the first decade of the seventh century, its im- agery, like that of the Holy Land ampules, would have been accessible to Saint Columbanus and the monks of Bobbio. Columbanus founded his first monastery in 590 at Lux- euil in Gaul. Controversy surrounds the products of the Luxeuil scriptorium. The earliest surviving Merovingian books do not go back beyond 669, and nothing is known of earlier Irish productions. However, certain of the late seventh- and early eighth-century manuscripts assigned to Luxeuil contain elements suggestive of Irish influence and contacts with Bobbio.103 One of these codices is the copy of Gregory's Commentary on Ezekiel in Leningrad cited earlier for its patriarchal cross page (Fig. 14). This minia- ture places the cross beneath a double arcade and surrounds it with smaller crosses and ornamental devices.04 With its flared ends and arcaded setting, the Leningrad cross resem- bles crosses on the Monza-Bobbio ampules. An interesting detail in the codex is similarly suggestive. On fol. Iv, the first of two cross pages in the Leningrad Gregory, an in- scription reads Crux alma fulgit - apparently a quotation from the second line of Venantius Fortunatus's True Cross hymn Vexilla regis.105 These textual and decorative features O 12 Ampule 2 with Christ in Majesty above crux florida. Bob- bio, Museo di S. Columbano (photo: Museo di S. Columbano) and our knowledge of Gregory's keen interest in relics of the Cross point to the likelihood that the patriarchal cross page in the Leningrad codex preserves an iconography both acquired from the seventh-century Bobbio community and centered on the celebration of the wood of the Cross.106 Might the native Irish foundations have been similarly informed? Some of the Monza-Bobbio figurations here cited invite a simultaneous contemplation of the Tree of Life of Eden prefiguring the Cross on which Christ died and (with its stars, sun, moon, and angels) the sign of the Son of Man, the Cross of the Second Coming. Symbolized are the con- 101 Cf. the gift of a cross containing a fragment of the True Cross sent to Raccaredus, king of the Visigoths; Frolow, 1961, 184. 102 Frolow (1961, 246-247; idem, 1958, 15-16) and Dontcheva (as in n. 28), 64, n. 14, assign the phylactery to ca. 1000. However, the authenticity of the letter that mentions the cross sent from Gregory the Great (Regest., Iv, 12, M.G.H. Epist., in, 431) has not been questioned, and, although there is no further reference to Gregory's gift until the 17th century, two fragments of the Monza relic are cited in an inventory of 1022 and another fragment is mentioned in a 14th-century inventory (S. Barbier de Mon- tault, "Le Tresor de Monza," Bulletin monumental, XLvI, 1880, 450f.; the phylactery is associated with Gregory and Theodolinda in a 17th-century inventory and again in an inventory of the 18th century; ibid., 24f. Some years ago Rosenberg (as in n. 29), 61f., and D. von Falke and H. Frau- berger, Deutsche Schmelzarbeiten des Mittelalters, Frankfurt a/M., 1904, 3f, attributed the Monza cross to Gregory; more recently, Lipinsky (as in n. 94), 49-51, and K. Wessel ("Friihbyzantinische Darstellung der Kreu- zigung Christi," Rivista di archeologia cristiana, xxvi, 1960, 23, 28, n. 47) have come to the same conclusion. 103 Luxeuil may have served as an important station for Irish and Anglo- Saxon ecclesiastics after 610; there is evidence of continuous relations between the monastery and the Swiss and Italian foundations of Col- umbanus. Lowe, vi, xv-xvii, and idem, "The Script of Luxeuil: A Title Vindicated," Revue binedictine, LXIII, 1953, 132-142, has pointed to some Irish influence in the approximately thirty manuscripts assigned to Lux- euil.

Putnam, "Evidence for the Origin of the 'Script of Luxeuil,' " Speculum, xxxviii, 1963, 256-266, who speculates on the possibility that Luxeuil did not produce the manuscripts assigned to it. Instead, the manuscripts may have been made at an Italian center such as Bobbio. 104 The volume may be a presentation copy of the first book of Gregory's homilies on Ezekiel created at Luxeuil and sent to Corbie; cf. D. Ganz, "The Merovingian Library of Corbie," Columbanus (as in n. 103), 156. McKitterick (as in n. 103), 187, finds the use of prickings to guide the ruling in both margins and the "diminuendo" initials to be Insular features. 105 Zimmermann, I, pl. 64a. See G.G.

Raw finds that just this vision and underlying content animates the core poem of The Dream of the Rood, and, in fact, she believes the cre- ator of the Anglo-Saxon poem was inspired by the cult scenes stamped on the Palestinian ampules.107 Given the connections between Bobbio and Ireland, her hypothesis is highly suggestive of the introduction of cult imagery to In- sular centers from the Lombard monastery. It is therefore of considerable interest that a number of early Crucifixion scenes from Ireland and North England seem to be indebted to the example of the ampullae Crucifixions. Werckmeister, for example, points to the Crucifixion miniature in the Dur- ham Gospels fragment (Cath. Lib. Ms A 11.17, fol. 38) as representing an early stage in an Insular sequence that be- gins in seventh-century Ireland (Fig. 15).108 The Christ type of this series in Early Christian Crucifixion art - frontal, dressed in a long robe, with his arms pressed to his body but with his forearms horizontally raised - is confined to the Holy Land ampules.109 Helen Roe has also called atten- tion to a succession of early Irish carved representations of the Cross surmounted by the haloed bust of Christ, again a type that closely follows the example of the scenes on the pilgrims' flasks."1 The possibility that Bobbio served as a center of trans- mission of imagery responsive to the relic cult is enhanced by Columbanus's concern with the closely related Chris- tological issues. Duke Agilulf and the majority of his sub- jects were Arian heretics, while Duchess Theodolinda and her sons were Catholics. Compounding this confused sit- uation was a growing division among the Catholics them- selves. Some supported, others angrily opposed the Three Chapters, the anti-Monophysite document condemned by the emperor and the Eastern Church in the hope of pla- cating the rebellious Monophysites. In opposition to Pope Gregory, who reluctantly acquiesced in the condemnation, Theodolinda and the court clergy refused compliance, in- itiating a dangerous rift among the Catholics of Lombardy. So serious had this become that in 613 Columbanus wrote to Pope Boniface IV accusing Pope Vigilius (d. 555) of error and even chiding Boniface himself for not finding a solution to the schism."' (Vigilius was brought to Constantinople by order of Justinian and forced to repudiate the Three Chapters, later retracted his condemnation, and after pro- test against another Imperial edict in 551 fled to Chalcedon. Following more travail concerning the Three Chapters, he 107 Raw, 242-244, 249-253. 108 Cf. Brown in Durham Gospels, 42-49, where the codex is ascribed to Lindisfarne ca. 700. D. 0 Croinin, "Pride and Prejudice," Peritia, I, 1982, 352-362, has recently put forward a contrary thesis, suggesting the man- uscript to be of Irish origin and perhaps by the scribe Ultan at Rath Madl- sigi in Ireland. See also Alexander, 40-42. O.-K. Werckmeister, Irisch-northumbrische Buchmalerei des 8. Jahr- hunderts und monastische Spiritualitiit, Berlin, 1967, 53-97, interprets the Durham fol. 38 Christ figure as conflating a type found in Crucifixion scenes of the Palestinian ampules (Grabar, 1958, pls. xxII, xxIv, XL) and a 6th-century Byzantine type of Christ of the Second Coming. For a some- what different view, see E. Coatsworth in Durham Gospels, 58-62. Also see nn. 110, 197 below. Henderson, 86-88, also points to the importance of Holy Land iconography for Durham fol. 38 - introduced by way of ampullae perhaps brought to Iona by Arculf and seen by Adomnan. Re- cently, P. Meyvaert, "The Book of Kells and Iona," Art Bulletin, LXXI, 1989, 13-17, suggested Arculf as a "channel for Near Eastern elements discernible in the Book of Kells." 109 Werckmeister's Insular chronology begins with the Crucifixion on a pillar stone at Carndonagh, Co. Donegal; F. Henry, La Sculpture irlan- daise pendant les douze premiers siecles de l'ere chritienne, Paris, 1933, 112-113, pl. 17c. The pillar stone is closely associated with the Carndo- nagh Cross and Fahan Mura slab (Henry, 1965, 128-130, pls. 52, 54, 56, fig. 16; Roth, figs. 31-34) usually assigned to the mid- or late 7th century. This early dating has been challenged by Stevenson (cf. n. 110) and more recently by P. Harbison, "A Group of Early Christian Carved Monuments in Co. Donegal," in J. Higgit, ed., Early Medieval Sculpture in Britain and Ireland, Oxford, 1986, 49-85, who dates the Carndonagh Cross to the late 8th century and the Fahan Mura slab slightly later. But see R. Lord, "Six Interlace-Decorated Early Christian Monuments in Co. Donegal, Ireland," M.A. thesis, Temple University, 1988, who puts for- ward cogent arguments favoring a ca. 700 date for both monuments. 110 This group of "face crosses" centers on a Crucifixion pillar stone from Clogher, Co. Tyrone. H. Roe, "A Stone-Cross at Clogher, Co. Tyrone," Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, xc, 1960, 190-206, pl. via, supports the generally accepted mid-7th-century date, while R.B.K. Stevenson, "The Chronology and Relationship of Some Irish and Scottish Crosses," ibid., xxcII, 1956, 93-96, and idem, "The Inchyra Stone and Some Other Unpublished Early Christian Monuments," Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, xcii, 1958-59, 53, n. 3, assigns the pillar stone and related Irish stones to the 10th or 11th century.

Not lacking in self-esteem, Columbanus regarded himself as the proud representative of the Irish Church. He had preached against Arianism during his two years in Milan;112 he had even written the Papacy on the issue of Easter dating."13 It would be surprising if his intense interest in the defense of orthodox Christology were not commu- nicated to his teachers and colleagues at Bangor. Equally unlikely would be silence on the precious gift of Holy Land ampules, with their theophanic and cultic imagery and their inscriptions, which so profoundly expressed orthodox concerns. The Insular evidence examined here contains numerous references or allusions to the liturgy. There is, for example, the supposition that the Ruthwell Cross was created in re- sponse to the papal use of the Exaltatio in 701. In addition, the lines from Venantius Fortunatus in the Leningrad Gre- gory, the imagery of Veneration on the ampullae, and the possibility that such cultic art influenced the poet of The Dream of the Rood have also been detailed. These indications of the relevance of liturgical devel- opments in the British Isles invite further analysis. Let us begin with the situation in England. By the late seventh century, Gospel books, lectionaries, and mass books from Capua and Naples had become available."14 The text of the four Gospels in the Lindisfarne Gospels copies that of a sixth-century Neapolitan Gospels, and the sumptuous Northumbrian codex also contains a list of Gospel readings and festivals from the same city (ca. 600).115 The codex pro- vides rare insight into the Early Christian Neapolitan year. That Lindisfarne employed all or part of the list for worship is unclear, but it seems certain that early eighth-century Wearmouth-Jarrow did, since Bede's fifty homilies on the Gospel extracts for the liturgical year have passages that in several instances do not depend on Roman precedent but instead follow Neapolitan example.116 Of great importance is the fact that one of the feasts in the Lindisfarne Gospels is marked by a pericope for the Invention of the Cross."7 Thus, the 3 May feast was known at Lindisfarne, and quite possibly it was celebrated there and more certainly at rF . . . . . . . . . . ;es" ?A. tw IND ?':X ve . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4; W.- No I APA A N 14 Gregory, Commentary on Ezekiel, Patriarchal Cross Page.

Durham, Cathedral Lib. Ms A.ii.17, fol. 383v (photo: Dean and Chapter of Durham) Wearmouth-Jarrow before 700.118 But what of the most important celebration honoring the True Cross, the Good Friday Adoration? If, as seems likely, some version of the Adoratio crucis had become part of the Good Friday rite in Rome by the mid-seventh century, there can be little doubt of its availability to the first Anglo- Saxon pilgrims. Wilfrid spent nearly a year studying exe- gesis during his first visit. Then, and later after the Synod of 679, he devoted many hours visiting the loca sancta of the city.119 His progress around Rome (and that of Benedict Biscop, who briefly visited the shrines in 654) undoubtedly followed one of the itineraries surviving from the mid- seventh century. One of these, Itinerarium Salisburgensis, originated at the Lateran and after many stops ended at St. Peter's basilica.120 The grouping of Early Christian churches around St. John Lateran seems to depend upon the relative position of the holy sites of Jerusalem, and, of course, one of the most important of stational churches is S. Croce.121 We can speculate that possibly Benedict and probably Wil- frid were present for the Good Friday service in the ven- erable church. Interest in the Roman liturgy was strong in late seventh-century Northumbria: witness the fact that Benedict and his biographer Eddius Stephanus taught li- turgical chant. And certainly, if he had come to know the Adoratio crucis, John the Archcantor would have made it available at Wearmouth-Jarrow. Here again The Dream of the Rood is of interest, for it happens that references to Venantius Fortunatus's hymn Vexilla Regis have been proposed as present in the poem.122 Given the liturgical developments at Wearmouth-Jarrow suggested above, this possible influence of a hymn used in the Good Friday Adoratio rite may carry special import, particularly when we consider the recent assertions of R. Cramp and others that the Ruthwell Cross was likely to have been produced within the orbit of Wearmouth- Jarrow. 123 Of course, this liturgical evidence,124 while compelling, is incomplete. The testimony of John the Archcantor, Ben- edict, and Wilfrid is circumstantial; controversy attends the dating of The Dream. It is unlikely to be earlier than the 118 A consideration of the Ruthwell Cross evidence is also in order. It has been claimed that certain lines of The Dream were inspired by the Inventio story; H.R. Patch, "Liturgical Influences in 'The Dream of the Rood,'" Proceedings of the Modem Library Association, xxxiv, 1919, 254, nn. 63- 64; Gradon (as in n. 79), 28. Also noteworthy is the hypothesis that the Ruthwell Cross was carved and inscribed in response to the introduction of the new solemnity attending the Exaltation Feast following Sergius's discovery of a fragment of the True Cross in 701. However introduced, it seems certain the Exaltatio was part of the liturgical calendar by Bede's day. He knew and used the Liber pontificalis and reported its entry on Sergius's discovery and the Feast in De temporum ratione (Pat. lat. xc, 569). Then too, Bede (H.A., ix, ed. Plummer, i, 373) tells us that among the numerous pictures brought by Benedict Biscop from the Continent were a pair, the first depicting the serpent raised up by Moses, the second show- ing Christ "in cruce exaltatum" - a phrase suggestive of the Exaltation feast. Also worthy of attention is the Pontifical bearing the name Egbert (archbishop of York, d. 766). It contains benedictions for 3 May and 14 September, that is, for the Inventio and Exaltatio feasts. Written in the 10th or 11th century, the Pontifical may contain elements preserved from the 8th century; cf. Willis, 226-229; "Pontifical d'Egbert," D.A.C.L., iv, 2211-20. 119 Eddius, Vita Wilfridi (as in n. 84), chaps. v, xxix-xxxii; Bede, H.E., v, 19, 20; H.A., ii-vii, ed.

Many years ago, J.W. Bright, "The Relation of the Caedmonian Exodus to the Lit- urgy," Modem Language Notes, xxIv, 1912, 99-103, indicated the liturgy of Easter, especially Holy Saturday, as a probable source of inspiration for the poem. More recently, P.J. Lucas, "Old English Christian Poetry: The Cross in Exodus," Famulus Christi, 202-205, suggested a connection between the conception of the pillar as cross in Exodus and the Adoratio crucis in the Good Friday liturgy.</page><page sequence="27">200 THE ART BULLETIN JUNE 1990 VOLUME LXXII NUMBER 2 second decade of the eighth century. Fortunately, the Book of Cerne furnishes more concrete textual evidence in sup- port of the seventh-century introduction of the Good Fri- day Veneration ceremony. The codex, containing a Passion narrative for the four Gospels, a collection of Latin prayers for private devotion, and Evangelist portraits, is generally assigned an early ninth-century South English provenance. Lichfield and Canterbury have been proposed as likely can- didates for the place of origin.125 Whatever the center of production and date, a model from mid-eighth-century Canterbury was probably available to the Cerne master, for elements of the Canterbury style are displayed in the codex. The iconography of its Evangelist symbols has af- finities with that of the Book of Durrow and Echternach Gospels, a connection compatible with the strong Irish con- tent that many have noted in the collection of prayers.126 There is common agreement that the prayers not only are Irish but at least decades earlier than the manuscript in which they are copied. A considerable body of evidence points to their being collected at Lindisfarne or in its orbit during the late seventh or early eighth century. They are perhaps to be associated with Aedelwald (Eathelwald) of Lindisfarne, bishop from 721 or 724 to 740,127 the sponsor of the binding of the Lindisfarne Gospels.128 One of the Cerne prayers is on the subject of the Cross.129 It is very similar to the prayer used by the priest after the Veneration of the Cross on Good Friday in the Mozarabic rite.130 In turn, this takes us back to the Jerusalem Good Friday Adoratio crucis.131 I therefore make special note of D. Dumville's conjecture of Easter employment for the original collection of prayers.132 Lindisfarne was, of course, founded from Columban Iona, which might suggest the possibility that the prayers were imported from one or more Columban foundations some time before their presumed assemblage around 721. Taken together, then, the evidence for the Good Friday Veneration rite seems to suggest it was available to Insular liturgists by 700. In sum, the textual and pictorial evidence makes it ap- parent that the cult of the wood of the Cross was of pro- found importance to Anglo-Saxon churchmen in the sev- enth and eighth centuries. Even though less direct, the evidence of the Bobbio treasure and Columbanus's letters speaks of a similar and at least partially independent in- terest on the part of Irish monks in Ireland and the paru- chia. I have not succeeded thus far in providing answers to each of the three questions raised in the first part of this study regarding the cross-carpet page in the Book of Dur- row, but surely enough has been learned to justify a partial response to the first two. If we provisionally accept the second half of the seventh-century date most often put for- ward in recent years and production in a Columban scrip- torium in Ireland, Scotland, or Northumbria, the Durrow Gospel book originated at a time and in a milieu associated with many of the events here emphasized as pertinent to the early Insular evolution of the Cross relic cult and the resolution of Christological dissension. Among others, they include the early Anglo-Saxon missions to Rome, the Synod of Hatfield, the copying of the Naples Inventio pericope into the Lindisfarne Gospels, the probable introduction of an Adoratio crucis prayer to the same foundation, and the use of Palestinian Crucifixion iconography in the Durham Gospels and related monuments. All this provides justifi- cation for a hypothesis that affirms the Durrow master's likely familiarity with the veneration of the relic of the Holy Cross, with various expressions of worship, and with some of its representations and symbolism. That his patriarchal cross-carpet page was meant to signify more than a per- vasive and generalized reverence for the relic common in Insular circles is a possibility that remains to be addressed. Adomnan's De locis sanctis It must be admitted that the evidence in support of wide- spread knowledge of the cult is far more substantial than that I have thus far examined for supposing the Durrow master's acquaintance with the form of a patriarchal cross. The cross type was rarely employed in the West before the Romanesque period. There is, of course, the testimony of the Poitiers reliquary and the Monza pectoral cross; despite arguments for late dating, those favoring sixth-century origin remain convincing. Then, too, we can point to the Liudhard medalet, the Merovingian coin in the Crondall hoard, and the patriarchal cross inscribed on Insular slabs, 125 Cambridge, Univ. Lib. MS L1.I.10; Alexander, 84-85. 126 For a discussion of the Irish features of the prayers, see Mayr-Harting, 183-184. 127 Some scholars place the codex in early 9th-century Mercia on the basis of the names Aedelvuldus and Oethelwald inscribed in the book (fols. 21, 87v). The inscriptions have been identified with Aethelwaeld, the bishop of Lichfield (818-830); cf. A. Kuypers, The Prayer Book of Aedelwald Commonly Called the Book of Cerne, Cambridge, 1902, 44, 174; W. Lev- ison, England and the Continent in the Eighth Century, Oxford and New York, 1946, repr. 1966, 295-302, and D.N. Dumville, "Liturgical Drama and Panegyric Responsory from the Eighth Century? A Reexamination of the Origin and Contents of the Ninth-Century Section of the Book of Cerne," Journal of Theological Studies, n.s. xxiii, 1972, 374-406, suggest the Cerne inscriptions refer to Aethelweald, bishop of Lindisfarne.

This assemblage, he speculates, may have had a liturgical function in the Easter festival.</page><page sequence="28">THE CROSS-CARPET PAGE IN THE BOOK OF DURROW 201 some possibly earlier than 700. Also conceivable is the availability of emblematic designs based on the crosses with tituli in the Crucifixion scenes on the Palestinian ampules presumed as introduced from Bobbio. While not unim- pressive, this documentation lacks specificity: none of these patriarchal cross designs can be definitely placed in any of the seventh-century Columban scriptoria to which the Dur- row manuscript has been assigned. Indeed, even if we set aside the issue of specific models for the patriarchal cross emblem, it is obvious that the In- sular instances of cultic practice or influence we have con- sidered have associations with more non-Columban than Columban centers: Canterbury, Wearmouth-Jarrow, and, in Ireland (because of its affiliation with Bobbio), Bangor. We are brought within the orbit of Columban monasticism only by the Inventio pericope in the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Good Friday Adoratio prayer in the collection of Irish prayers that was possibly assembled at Lindisfarne before its later appearance in the Book of Cerne. Hence, while illuminating the character and thrust of the True Cross cult in the British Isles, the evidence examined thus far can take us little further. It does not speak to the precise source for the cross type in our codex. It does little to solve the problem of place of manufacture and date. And, certainly, it is silent on the issue of the specific icon- ographic and codicological significance of the fol. Iv composition. This being so, the importance of Adomnan's De locis sanctis, a document of late seventh-century Columban or- igin detailing the events of a pilgrimage to the holy sites of the East, cannot be exaggerated.133 Ninth abbot of Iona (679- 704), Adomnan is best known as the biographer of its foun- der, Saint Columba, but his earlier De locis sanctis is in many ways as valuable a source of information for the his- torian. The text and Bede indicate that the basis of the work is the record transcribed by Adomnan of the travels of a Gallic bishop, Arculf, who, shipwrecked off the west coast of Britain, endured much hardship before finding refuge on Iona. In 686 (or 688), Adomnan himself presented a copy of the manuscript to King Aldfrith of Northumbria at the royal residence of Bamburgh. Aldfrith, who had studied in Iona before becoming ruler, made copies and donated the original or one of the copies to Jarrow.lM Bede must have seen this manuscript in the Jarrow library, for he tells us of its incorporation into his own, more concise version of De locis sanctis.135 Arculf's journey has been estimated to have taken two and a half to three years. Its details and those added by the abbot of Iona indicate 679 to 682 as the period when the Gallic bishop was in the Near East, 682 to be the year he came to Iona, and 682 to 686 the years when Adomnan completed his manuscript.136 Besides the notes and diagrams made on tabulae (Fig. 16) of Arculf's account, the Irish abbot seems to have consulted earlier pilgrim literature and one or more geographic man- uals.137 These sources he combined with comments of his own, mostly to clarify New Testament passages. The narrative begins with the Holy Land. Arculf spent nine months in and around Jerusalem, then proceeded to go to Bethlehem, Hebron, the lower valley of the Jordan, and Galilee. He journeyed to Damascus, Tyre, and Alex- andria before visiting Constantinople, where he remained from Easter to Christmas. On his homeward journey, he spent time in Sicily and possibly in Rome.138 The sacred city described in the first book is the city reconstructed by Heraclius following the widespread dam- age inflicted by the Persians. The Arabs occupied Jerusalem in 638, but seem to have left it relatively undisturbed. Con- fining himself to Arculf's recollections of the holy city, "which has the honored place of [Christ's] Holy Cross and Resurrection within its walls," Adomnan announces his ex- clusion of material on the city contained in "books of oth- ers." Arculf spent much time in the "amazing buildings in the holy places of the Cross and Resurrection." He de- scribed the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (Anastasis), the Church of the Holy Mary (perhaps the Baptistry of the Holy Sepulchre), the Church of Golgotha, and the atrium between the Anastasis and Martyrium, the oratory and rock 133 Text, study, and translation in Meehan.

For the full ver- sion, cf. Fraipont, Itineraria, 247-280. 136 Meehan, 9-12. Bede informs us that Adomnan was abbot when he wrote the manuscript and that his second visit to Aldfrith was in 688; thus, because Adomnan became abbot in 679, On the Holy Places cannot have been begun, at the earliest, before 679 and completed after 688. Meehan's dating of 682-686 fits comfortably within these limits. 137 The pilgrimages to Jerusalem after 320 are fairly well documented. Of the Itineraria compiled by Western pilgrims, the following predate Adom- nan's: a pilgrimage by a traveller from Bordeaux in 333 (Itinerarium bur- digalense, C.S.E.L., xxxIx); Saint Jerome's pilgrimage made in the com- pany of two noblewomen from Rome, Paula and Eustochium; Jerome, Epistolae, cviii; Pat. lat., xxII, 878; the pilgrimage of Egeria (see n. 47); the pilgrimage of Eucherius, bishop of Lyon (bishop 434-449 A.D.) de- scribed in Letter to Faustus (ed. Fraipont, Itineraria, 236-243); the guide- book called the Breviarius, possibly written in the early 6th century (Short Account of Jerusalem/Breviarius, ed. R. Weber, Itineraria, 852f); Theo- dosius's De situ Terrae Sanctae, of ca. 518 (ed. P. Geyer, Itineraria, 114- 125; and the pilgrimage of the Piacenza Pilgrim (as in n. 48). Translations of Jerome's letters on Jerusalem pilgrimages appear in Wilkinson, 1981, 13f.; and, along with Eucherius, the Breviarius, Theodosius, and the Pi- acenza Pilgrim, in idem, 1977, 47f. H. Leclercq, "P61erinages aux lieux saints," D.A.C.L., xxiv, 153, be- lieves such pilgrims' literature to have been widely circulated. Adomnan himself refers to material in earlier books and, as Wilkinson, 1977, 3, points out, Eucherius's Letter contains parallels with Adomnan and Bede. Some scholars believe the Letter to be much later than the mid-6th century and to copy parts from the works of the two Insular authors, but Wilk- inson finds their arguments unconvincing. As he says, some of the Bedean manuscripts cite " 'Eucherius' as the source of certain passages and in these passages the text is obviously dependent on the Letter." Then, too, while Adomnan does not acknowledge his written sources, his description of the Eleona church is in the form of a commentary on a section of Eu- cherius; and Wilkinson, 95-104, finds many words and phrases borrowed from the Letter. 138 Cf.

Adomnan goes on to report Arculf's description of the exterior and inte- rior.140 After an account of the stone that was rolled against the door of Christ's monumentum after his burial and men- tion of the Church of St. Mary,141 Adomnan writes of the church built on the site of Calvary: Toward the east, in the place that is called in Hebrew Golgotha, another very large church has been erected. In the upper regions of this a great round bronze chan- delier with lamps is suspended by ropes and underneath it is placed a large cross of silver, erected in the selfsame place where once the wooden cross stood embedded, on which suffered the Saviour of the human race. Now in this church, beneath the place of the Lord's cross, there is a grotto cut out of the rock where sacrifice is offered on an altar for the souls of certain privileged persons. .. .142 The Martyrium is described and related to the Inventio: ". .. [It is] said to be built in the spot where after the lapse of two hundred and thirty-three years, by the favour of the Lord himself the cross of the Lord, with the crosses of the two thieves, was found hidden beneath the earth."143 In a side chapel between the Anastasis and Martyrium Arculf saw important relics: the chalice that Christ used at the Last Supper, the lance that pierced his side, now en- cased in a wooded cross, and the cloth that was placed over the Savior's head when he was buried. Elsewhere in Jeru- salem the bishop was shown a mantle, woven by the Vir- gin, which pictured Christ and the Apostles.44 He was impressed by: ... a very high column which stands in the centre of the city to the north of the holy places .... It is re- markable how this column (which is situated in the place where the dead youth came to life when the cross of the Lord was placed upon him) fails to cast a shadow at mid- day during the Summer solstice when the sun reached the centre of the heavens. When the solstice is passed, however (that is the eighth day before the kalends of July), after an interval of three days, as the day gradually grows shorter it casts a brief shadow at first, then as the days pass a longer one. And so this column, which the sunlight surrounds on all sides blazing directly down on it during the midday hours (when at the Summer solstice the sun stands in the centre of the heavens), proves Je- rusalem to be situated at the centre of the world. Hence the psalmist, because of the holy places of the passion and resurrection, which are contained within Helia [Jerusalem in the time of Hadrian] itself, prophesying sings: "God our king before the ages hath wrought our salvation in the centre of the earth; that is Jerusalem, which is said to be the centre of the earth and its navel."'14 Following upon his pilgrimage to many more holy places 139 D.L.S., I, 1-11, Meehan, 41-58. 140 D.L.S., I, 2, Meehan, 44-47. 141 D.L.S., I, 2-4, Meehan, 47-49. 142 D.L.S., I, 5, Meehan, 49. 143 D.L.S., I, 6, Meehan, 50-51. 144 D.L.S., I, 7-10, Meehan, 51-57. 145 D.L.S., I, 11, Meehan, 57.</page><page sequence="30">THE CROSS-CARPET PAGE IN THE BOOK OF DURROW 203 in Palestine, Arculf traveled to Tyre, Damascus, and Al- exandria. Later, in Constantinople, he witnessed the Easter service in the Church of Hagia Sophia: In the interior in the northern part a very large and very beautiful repository is on view. It enclosed a wooden chest, and that in turn encloses a wooden reliquary, where the salutary wood of the cross is kept on which our Saviour was suspended and suffered for the salvation of the human race. Now, according to the holy Arculf, for three consecutive days after a lapse of a complete year this famous chest, together with its precious treas- ure, is set up on a golden altar. The altar is in the round church, and is two cubits in length and one in breadth. It is only on three days each year, I say, three successive days, that the cross of the Lord is set up and placed on the altar, that is the day of the Lord's supper, on which the emperor and the soldiers of the army enter the church, approach the altar and kiss the salutary cross when the holy chest is opened. First of all the emperor of the world bows down and kisses it, and then according to their various stations or ages, one after another, the rest ap- proach and kiss the gibbet of honour. So too on the mor- row, that is the sixth feria before the pasch, the royal ladies, matrons, and all the women of the people, ob- serving the order mentioned above, approach and kiss it with all veneration. On the third day, that is the pas- chal sabbath, the bishop and after him all the clergy ap- proach in procession with fear and trembling and with every reverence to kiss the victorious wood as it lies in its chest. And when these holy and joyous kissings of the holy cross are finished, the venerable chest is closed and together with its honourable treasure carried back to its receptacle. This fact, however, should be carefully observed. There are three, not two, short beams, the transverse beam that is, and the long one which is cut into two equal parts. From these three pieces of honoured wood, when the chest is opened, there arises the fragrance of a won- drous odour, as if the marvellous sweetness of all flowers were collected there. It sates and rejoices everyone who has a position in the space within the interior walls of the church, for during this period people enter and take their stand there. The knots in the three beams exude a fragrant liquid somewhat like oil which makes all the crowds inside of various nations perceive the most sweet fragrance that was mentioned. If even a small drop of the liquid be applied to sick people, whatever kind of disease or illness they be troubled with, they recover full of health. But let that description of the matter suffice.146 Despite some errors, Adomnan's account presents an ex- traordinarily vivid picture of the holy places (and some- times the ceremonies conducted in them) as they appeared in the late seventh century. Before examining this testi- mony, we should briefly consider the significance of the date of Arculf's sojourn in Constantinople. Most probably he was in the Byzantine capital during the reign of Con- stantine Pogonatus and observed the emperor participating in the Easter liturgy. It was Constantine IV who presided at the sessions of the Council of Constantinople where the Monothelite heresy was condemned. If, as seems probable, Arculf's stay in the city occurred between 680 and 681, it coincided with the final sessions of the General Council attended by the delegates of Pope Agatho, who were back at the Holy See by late 681 or early 682. Conceivably, Ar- culf, who departed Constantinople Romam appetens, may have traveled with them.147 But whether or not he did, it becomes possible to speculate that the Easter he spent in the capital was that of 681, when Easter Sunday mass was celebrated in Latin in honor of the Western delegates. Per- haps Adomnan's reference to "all the crowds inside of var- ious nations" at Easter service alludes to this. Adomnan's De locis sanctis is silent on the Council of Constantinople. Yet if we accept the evidence placing Ar- culf in the city in 680-681, it strains credulity to suppose that the Gallic pilgrim, an especially observant and effusive churchman who spent so many hours detailing the holy sites for the Iona congregation, would not have reported on the deliberations and decisions of the ecumenical council that resolved the Monothelite crisis. One of the leading scholars of the Columban paruchia, Adomnan was surely versed in many of the orthodox arguments employed to counter Christological heresy - Christology transmitted from Bobbio and other Irish foundations on the Continent, or through contact with his friend Aldfrith. Indeed, after the Council of Hatfield in 680, exchanges between Iona and Lindisfarne would assure an awareness of what had become an urgent issue. De locis sanctis is, of course, essentially a chronicle and commentary on the holy sites. Adomnan sometimes touches on doctrinal matters, but usually to illustrate some point concerning the loca sancta or clarify a scriptural pas- sage. The absence of reference to the Council of Constan- tinople may simply mean the Irish abbot chose to exclude what seemed peripheral to a record of a pilgrimage. How- ever that may be, this omission alerts us to other more troublesome lacunae. Arculf refers to relics and miraculous objects he saw, such as the cloth with images of Christ and Apostles woven by the Virgin, but he makes no mention of monumental church decoration. In this he follows the 146 D.L.S., III, 3, Meehan, 109-111. The text of the second paragraph reads: Sed et hoc non neglegenter intuendum quod non duo sed tria ibidem crucis habeantur breuia ligna, hoc est transuersum lignum et longum incisum et in duas aequas diuisum partes; e quibus tripertitis honori- ficabilibus lignis, quando illa aperitur capsa, miri odoris flagrantia ac si omnium florum inibi collectorum mirabili plena suauitate exoritur, satians et letificans omnes in propatulo intra illius eclesiae parietes in- teriores qui eodem temporis spatio intrantes stant; nam de nodis eorun- dem trinalium lignorum liquor quidam odorifer quasi in similtudinem olei expresus talem facit uniuersos intrantes ex diuersis gentibus ad- gregatos supra memoratam sentire suauissimi odoris flagrantiam.

The lack of such enumeration and the many errors and vagaries in Adom- nan's text - the latter suggestive of Arculf's departure from Iona before De locis sanctis was completed - strongly sug- gest the bishop imparted much information to Adomnan that is absent from the surviving copies of the manu- script.'48 For this reason, we must attempt to recover some idea of the imagery Arculf may have seen in the Holy Sep- ulchre complex. To this end, let us once again consider the imagery of the modest Palestinian ampules. Smirnov and Ainalov pro- posed that each of the scenes on the flasks is a condensed version of a monumental composition in one or another of the Palestinian holy sites.149 Widely held, this view was challenged by Grabar, who argued that the existence of more than one pictorial type from a site made a single mon- umental archetype unlikely.150 For him, the Cross and the Christ-bust arrangement of the "symbolic" Crucifixion scenes on the ampullae was a purely imaginary union of images of the Golgotha memorial Cross, the relic of the wood, and the idea of the unseen Deity.151 A likely source for the ampule scenes, he suggests, was Constantinopolitan goldwork. Recently, convincing evidence of the essential validity of the traditional view was introduced by Weitz- mann. He adduced specific sites for the large-scale proto- types of some of the ampule scenes and related figurations on the Sancta Sanctorum pilgrim's box, the Rabula Gos- pels, and Sinai icons.'52 It is necessary to grasp the impli- cation of Weitzmann's hypothesis as we examine the tes- timony for monumental veneration imagery in the Golgotha complex. There is some reason to believe a Constantinian fresco or mosaic decorated the apse of the Martyrium and was restored by Modestus after the Persian attack.'53 It may have been of a Crucifixion scene related to the "symbolic" types on the ampules in which the Golgotha Cross with Christ- bust above and the four rivers below is surrounded by sun and moon, the thieves, worshippers (or soldiers), and Mary and John.154 Even more important to our inquiry is the evidence con- cerning the Golgotha church and its decoration. It is dif- ficult to follow Arculf's account of the rock of Calvary and its "large church," which stood at the extreme south end of the eastern portico of the forecourt of the Rotunda. Ac- cording to C. Couisnon, Adomnan correctly recorded the existence of a church separate from Constantine's Martyr- ium. Wilkinson doubts, however, the site could have ac- commodated more than a small chapel.155 In any event, the building included or stood next to an open towerlike struc- ture set up above a ciborium over the silver Calvary Cross. Below or to one side was a chapel alternately called the Niketerion or the Tomb of Adam - undoubtedly Arculf's "grotto cut out of the rock."'56 The primary reliquary of the True Cross was kept in the Golgotha church before 635; 148 For discussion of errors in Latinity, chronology, description, etc., see Bullough, I, 120, n. 1; 11, 23; Meehan, 16-17; Wilkinson, 1977, 10, n. 89, 96, n. 9, 97, n. 7, 99, n. 28, 100, n. 31, 32, 175-177.

The ampullae feature two types of the Crucifixion. The first, the "symbolic" type, is most common and pictures the Golgotha cross with a bust of Christ at the top (the version with the bust in a disc at the crossing can be considered a variant); ibid., pls. xi-xvi, xvIII, xxvI, xxvIII, xxxiv-XXXIX, XLIX; Engemann (as in n. 94), pls. 8, 9. The second type, the "historical," is much less frequently employed. It presents Christ clad in a colobium; Grabar, pls. XXII, XXIV, XL. Weitzmann, 1974, 40f., under- stands the two Crucifixion compositions to depend on different archetypes and suggests the church of Sion as once displaying a monumental version of the "historical" Crucifixion.

Coiuasnon, 50-53; Wilkinson, 1977, 175-179; W.E. Kleinbauer, in Age of Spirituality, 650-651; Spain (as in n. 21). 156 The Jerusalem Typikon speaks of the Niketerion "behind the Holy Skull" as the place where the wood of the Cross was kept. Epiphanius the Monk's Account of the Holy City and the Holy Places of ca. 639-689 says that "beneath the Crucifixion there is a church, the Tomb of Adam"; Wil-kinson, 1977, 117, 175. All the manuscripts of Adomnan illustrate the upper story of the Golgotha church, giving the legend Golgotham ecclesia. Possibly plans in the manuscripts of Bede also show the Chapel of Adam since, instead of being rectangular, the Golgotha church appears as a D-shape with its "apse" to the east. For discussion of plans, see ibid., 193-197. There is some possibility that the Chapel of Adam and the Ni- keterion were separate structures, the latter more secret than the former and after 635 employed to house a fragment of the sacred Cross; cf. P. Verdier, "Les Staurotheques mosanes et leur iconographie du Jugement dernier," Cahiers de civilization medievale, xvI, 1973, 102; and n. 157.</page><page sequence="32">THE CROSS-CARPET PAGE IN THE BOOK OF DURROW 205 possibly a sliver of sacred wood remained there after the Arab Conquest.157 Early in the seventeenth century, a certain F. Quaresmius described a mosaic he saw in the vault of the Chapel of Adam. It depicted a jeweled Cross with an imago clipeata of Christ at its center, set on the steps of Golgotha. An angel appeared on each side and an inscription read "NICKA" [sic].158 Ihm believes the mosaic to have origi- nated in Modestus's seventh-century reconstruction of the Holy Sepulchre.159 Some scholars also suggest a represen- tation of the Golgotha Cross surmounted by a bust of the Savior - perhaps an abbreviated "symbolic" Crucifixion related to that in the Martyrium apse - on the vault of the exedra above the monumental Calvary Cross.160 Among the monuments Arculf mentioned to Adomnan is one that has great iconographic import. It is the column close to the Holy Sepulchre that "proves Jerusalem to be situated at the centre of the world." No doubt, this is the column at the north end of the cardo maximus and just inside the north gate of the city (the present Damascus Gate) on the famous sixth-century Madaba mosaic map.161 In 724- 725, the English pilgrim Willibald was in Jerusalem and saw the same column "standing in front of the city gate" crowned by a cross,162 and Verdier has submitted per- suasive evidence that the column was surmounted by a cross and an imago clipeata of Christ.163 Conjoined, the documentary and presumptive evidence make it possible to assume Arculf must have seen a number of monumental veneration of the Cross representations in and near the Holy Sepulchre complex. In these, the Gol- gotha Cross - sometimes with a bust of Christ placed at the top, sometimes at the crossing - was variously com- bined with images of angels, pilgrims, the thieves, Mary and John, and the hill and rivers of Paradise at the center of the world. Did Arculf also see the patriarchal cross emblem in Je- rusalem7 As with the figural scenes, Adomnan is mute on this question. A number of the "symbolic" Crucifixions on the ampullae display the Golgotha Cross with a titulus.64 These crosses are so abstract as to approach the appearance of the purely emblematic double-barred cross. Two as- sumptions can be made: that Arculf saw monumental ver- sions of the "symbolic" Crucifixion type described, and that he may also have seen some of the ampullae with the type, which undoubtedly remained in Jerusalem after manufac- ture ceased in the wake of the Arab Conquest. Moreover, if, as the Mt. Sinai reliefs (and Sancta Sanctorum relic box) cited earlier strongly suggest, the purely emblematic pa- triarchal cross was displayed in Jerusalem in the Justinianic Age, it seems reasonable to suppose not only its origin there but its presence in the Church of Golgotha where the pri- mary relic of the Crucifixion Cross was kept and displayed well into the seventh century. If I am correct, Arculf must have seen the symbol in this sacred shrine. Certainly, then, exposed to the loca sancta of the Cross cult and its sym- bolism, Arculf was prepared to appreciate the profound 157 Egeria and Anthony of Piacenza speak of the True Cross in the church (or chapel) of Golgotha, and there are medieval references to a fragment continuing to be kept in the Niketerion after the primary relic was sent to Constantinople (Theophanes, Pat. gr., cvIII, 692; Vincent and Abel, 239). However, Wilkinson, 1977, 175, casts doubt on this last possibility. A letter of 1109 by Anselm, chanter of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, to the Church of Paris, may be of interest in this matter. He wrote that after Heraclius's death, the Holy Sepulchre was nearly demolished by infidels who attempted to destroy the True Cross. In consequence, the relic was divided into many pieces and distributed throughout the Chris- tian world. Anselm observed that every major East Christian center had a fragment. Besides the primary relic at Hagia Sophia, Constantinople had three, Jerusalem four; cf. J. Morand, Histoire de la Ste.-Chapelle, Paris, 1790, 7-8. The possibility is attractive that this somewhat skewed account of the history of the True Cross relic contains some truth and therefore points to a fragment in the Golgotha church, but the story seems to be contradicted by Arculf's puzzling failure to mention a cross fragment or even the local Jerusalem Cross festivals. He does speak of vast crowds thronging the city for several days after 12 September, perhaps an oblique reference to the Exaltatio on 14 September (D.L.S., i, 1, Meehan, 41-42). 158 F. Quaresmius, Historica, theologica et moralis terrae sanctae elluci- datio, II, Elucidatio, Antwerp, 1639, v, 481: "Sub fornice est depicta crux Domini et in medio eius et circulo est effigies Salvatoris cum litteris graecis NIC-KA et ex reltraque parte angelus: omnia opera musaico elaborata." 159 Following K. Schmaltz, Mater Ecclesiarum: Die Grabeskirche in Je- rusalem, Strasbourg, 1918, 277, Ihm, 90-91, 194-195, concludes the mo- saic to be a product of Modestus's 7th-century restoration. Precedent for the imago clipeus at the crossing is found in the apse mosaic of S. Apol- linare in Classe, Ravenna (see n. 192 below); the theme of the angels venerating Christ on the Cross of Golgotha appears on the Bobbio am- pules (nos. 1 and 2: Grabar, pls. xxxii, xxxIII). A close connection has been proposed between the mosaic and the late 6th-century Berezoff paten in the Hermitage, Leningrad (J.L. Schrader, in Age of Spirituality, 537- 538, no. 482). This Constantinopolitan work pictures Gabriel and Michael on either side of a jeweled cross, which is supported by the starry globe of the world at the center of the earth, from which issue the four rivers of Paradise. The angels raise their hands in a gesture of adoration. Sym- bols of Sol and Luna in the sky are probably later additions. The paten lacks the imago clipeata of Christ and inscription of the Adam Chapel composition, and we can only guess whether the latter contained a ref- erence to the four rivers such as appears on the Constantinopolitan work. One should also note that Ihm, 90, n. 43, 44, suggests inspiration for the "NICKA" inscription in the vision of Constantine as recorded by Rufinus, Socrates, and Sozomen. Later Byzantine art often employs the words "IC XC NIKA" to evoke this vision in representations of the Cross as Tree of Life.

This brings me to the most important passage in De locis sanctis for the present study. It is difficult to follow the description of the fragments of the True Cross exhibited in the "celebrated round church." The surviving copies of Adomnan's and Bede's versions of De locis sanctis advise the reader to pay special attention to the fact that there are not two but three pieces of wood "of the holy cross," a crossbeam and an upright divided into two equal parts. Both Breckenridge and Frolow have proposed that here Ar- culf may be describing a double-barred cross, transuersum lignum and longum lignum becoming confused at some point in transcription.'65 Following this suggestion would mean supporting the possibility that the relic had two cross- beams of equal length, an attractive hypothesis in view of the symmetrical shape of the cross on Durrow fol. lv, but, as will be seen, one not in accord with the relevant By- zantine evidence. Furthermore, notwithstanding the com- mon errors preserved in all surviving copies of Adomnan's text,166 the existence of essentially the same description of "the holy cross" in Bede's version argues against mistran- scription.167 Bede, we recall, based his text directly on the manuscript Adomnan presented to Aldfrith or on a direct copy. This is not to say that the relic of the True Cross Arculf viewed in Hagia Sophia did not in some fashion describe the double-barred cross form, but rather that Adomnan may have recorded only a portion of the Gallic bishop's characterization of the relic. An examination of Byzantine liturgical materials may help clarify this point. The Good Friday Adoratio crucis rite disappeared from its native Pal- estine by the late seventh century, and, judging from its absence from medieval Byzantine texts, it was excluded from the Byzantine liturgy not long after the time of Ar- culf's visit to Constantinople. Conversely, the Exaltatio cel- ebrated on 14 September became one of the great feasts of the Byzantine Church. It is pictured in a number of mid- Byzantine books, including the tenth-century Menologium of Basil II, where a miniature shows the patriarch in the ambo of Hagia Sophia (Fig. 17). In his hand is the venerated relic of the Holy Cross, mounted in a patriarchal cross- shaped reliquary, which he lifts over his head four times toward the four sides of the ambo.'68 The same ceremonial scene is found in an eleventh-century Greek lectionary in the Vatican Library but now preceded by four scenes wherein the Exaltatio participants, in the presence of one or more bishops, bend over the altar to kiss the Cross or make a proskynesis (Fig. 18). The relic in these miniatures is represented as a vertical bar bound together with two cross-bars to form the patriarchal cross emblem.169 An Exaltation of the Cross ceremony on 14 September employing a relic of the true Cross was already part of the liturgy at Hagia Sophia in the sixth century.170 Doubtless its importance was enormously enhanced by the arrival of the primary relic in the seventh century171 - the relic Arculf must have seen at the Easter service. In their descriptions of the great Jerusalem relic, both Egeria and the Piacenza pilgrim refer to the title board kept and displayed with the wood of the Cross, but such references no longer appear in the literature after the recovery of the True Cross from the Persians. This fact and Arculf's silence on the titulus suggest that what he saw in Constantinople was the sur- viving fragments of the Cross minus the title board, which was kept or destroyed by the Persians (or perhaps pre- served elsewhere). Egeria describes the relic as a single entity set out next to the title; Arculf speaks of the fragments as bound or mounted together to form a cross. Eastern staurotheke inevitably have patriarchal cross-shaped compartments for the sacred wood, and cross-shaped reliquaries generally take the form of a patriarchal cross as well. The testimony of the mid-Byzantine Exaltatio miniatures and the antiquity of the Constantinopolitan Exaltatio service indicate not only that Arculf saw the True Cross fragments mounted in a reliquary but that the reliquary was in the form of a pa- triarchal cross. All this leads us to believe that the De locis sanctis description is only of the miraculous wood within the reliquary on the altar of Hagia Sophia. In other words, the three fragments of the Cross - all presumably of equal length - must have filled the vertical and longer horizontal cavities. The upper bar representing the titulus (which once accompanied the primary fragments) would have been cov- 165 Frolow, 1961, 194-195; Breckenridge (as in n. 27), 101. 16 P. Geyer, Adamnanus: ii.

He points out, 33, that all the recensions seem to retain errors from the archetype. 167 In Adomnan, the passage is as follows: "Sed et hoc non neglegenter intuendum quod non duo sed tria ibidem crucis habeantur breuia ligna, hoc est transuersum lignum et longum incisum et in duas aequas diuisum partes"; Meehan (as in n. 146).

We must assume that Adom- nan, told of the Hagia Sophia reliquary by Arculf, chose to include in his text only a description of its miraculous wooden fragments. The Iconography of the Opening Miniatures in the Book of Durrow All this must mean that Adomnan possessed knowledge not necessarily available to readers of De locis sanctis out- side Iona. At all events, the abbot was certainly in the best position to make use of the intelligence he had gained from Arculf. Given the striking affinity between the patriarchal cross-shaped reliquary proposed as described by Arculf and the cross emblem on Durrow fol. 1v and the late seventh- century Iona provenance that some have suggested for the Book of Durrow, it is not difficult to argue that the codex was created in Iona shortly after Arculf's arrival. The issues of date and place of manufacture will be examined in due course. At this point let me posit a tentative terminus a quo of 682 for the Durrow Gospels - a hypothesis that permits examination of what appears to be the direct and profound influence of Arculf's and Adomnan's De locis sanctis col- laboration on the iconography of the Insular Gospel book. That the form of the patriarchal Cross on Durrow fol. 1v depends upon more than Arculf's recollections (perhaps preserved in one or more of the wax tablet sketches men- tioned by Adomnan) is uncertain. More probable, as will be seen, is a pictorial model lying behind the cross and Evangelist symbols presentation on the facing page, fol. 2r - an exemplar modified by the Durrow master to reflect a new iconographic imperative. But more important than the origin of discrete elements or even of the separate pages is the initiative for juxtaposing the double-barred cross page and the four symbols page and introducing this grouping at the opening of the codex. Presumption of Adomnan's inspiration as reflected in De locis sanctis serves to explain both essential elements of this locution and its underlying purpose. Embedded in interlace and unconnected to the borders of the page, the golden emblem on fol. 1v has the character of a recumbent cross. Adomnan's text allows for its inter- pretation as a kind of locus sanctus image. On one level, it can be understood as referring to the reliquary on the altar of Hagia Sophia at Easter. On another, more anagogic level, it seems to evoke the idea of the primary relic of the Cross in its original setting, that is, the fragments and tit- ulus displayed for the Good Friday Adoratio crucis on the altar of the Church of Golgotha,172 this because the mini- ature gives every indication of being part of a scholarly figuration setting out sacred areas of the Holy Sepulchre. With its four small crosses in the corners arranged around the great double-barred cross, this introductory page brings to mind the ceremony of altar consecration,173 and the dis- tribution of crosses on an altar mensa where a central sym- bol and four symbols at the corners are employed.174 A display of five such crosses - of an elongated type known in seventh-century Ireland - is engraved on the wooden altar of St. Cuthbert, a work of the same general age as our Gospel book (Fig. 19).175 Its crosses are physical witness of an episcopal consecration of an altar shrine containing appropriate brandeae.176 The presence of the little crosses in the Durrow miniature may describe an attempt to link traditional mensa symbols with the patriarchal cross for 172 Arculf spoke of numerous altars in the Holy Sepulchre complex, in- cluding an "altar for the souls of certain privileged persons" in the grotto of "the church beneath the place of the Lord's cross." He noted the use of the stone that "was rolled to the door of the Lord's monumentum" as an altar in the Anastasis; D.L.S., 1, 3, Meehan, 47. Weitzmann, 1974, 41- 42, has suggested that the cube-like object in the ciborium of the Holy Sepulchre represented on Monza ampule no. 3 (Grabar, 1958, pl. ix) is an altar. Comparison with the similar depiction on the Sancta Sanctorum reliquary box indicates that the latter may display an altar covered with a purple cloth with embroidered golden cross and gammadiae. Found in loca sancta images, these Holy Sepulchre altars have a liturgical dimen- sion. They suggest the reading of the mass as the site of Christ's tomb. An interesting variant of this iconography appears on a 6th-century Syro-Palestinian pyxis in the Metropolitan Museum. The subject is the visit of the woman to Christ's tomb. However, an altar is substituted for the tomb. It stands on a platform beneath a structure probably intended as a baldachino. A Gospel book lies on the altar. It has been suggested that the altar here takes the place of Christ's tomb and appears as it would in a church apse. In this way, a symbolic identity of the Holy Sepulchre with the church altar is achieved, reflecting the Eastern belief in Christ's presence on the altar during the Eucharistic rite; cf. A. St. Clair in Age of Spirituality, 581-582, no. 520; see also ibid., no. 519. 173 At the dedication of a church, brandeae (relics of saints, etc.) were placed within the altar and capped by a slab. The slab was solemnly consecrated by the bishop with Gregorian water (a kind of holy water attributed to Gregory the Great) or holy oils and chrism applied at the middle and the four corners. See A. Craegaert, The Mass: A Liturgical Commentary, London, 1958, 8; "Dedicace des eglises," D.A.C.L., iv, 374- 404. 174 See J. Braun, Der christliche Altargeriit in seinem Sein und in seiner Entwicklung, Munich, 1932; idem, Der christliche Altar in seiner ge- schichtlichen Entwicklung, 2 vols., Munich, 1924; "Autel," D.A.C.L., i, 3155-89. 175s A small rectangle likely to have belonged to the saint, it was encased in silver perhaps at the first translatio of Saint Cuthbert in 698; cf. C.A. Ralegh Radford (as in n. 73), 326-335. Little is known of the altar types employed in Britain and Ireland before the 7th century. The only surviving portable altar of early date besides that of Saint Cuthbert was discovered near Wick in Scotland. It is of stone and displays four small crosses at the corners and a large central cross. C. Thomas, 194, fig. 94, assigns it to the 7th or early 8th century. Several small slabs of 8th-century or later creation bearing five crosses and dis- covered in Irish ecclesiastical sites are likely to be altar slabs. Of small size, they may possibly be covers for the relic boxes of stone altars or inserts for wooden altars. See P. Lionard (as in n. 13), 136-137. Adomnan, we recall, describes the golden altar of Hagia Sophia as being "two cubits in length and one in breadth." Thomas, 182, notes that this ratio of two to one is not uncommon for Early Christian altars in the British Isles.

Durham, Cathedral Library (photo: Dean and Chapter of Durham) the purpose of underlining the reference to the altar setting for the relic of the Cross.177 On first inspection, the facing page with four Evangelist symbols set around a large interlaced cross seems icono- graphically remote from a bold schematic figuration of a Palestinian locus sanctus. It is an example of the Majestas Crucis, in which the four Apocalyptic creatures symbolize the Gospel authors and the cross takes the place of an image of Christ. Introduced at the opening of the Insular codex, it makes unmistakable reference to the harmony of the four Gospels. And though it is possible to discern a connection between Arculf's recollections about the Church of Gol- gotha, the cross reliquary at Hagia Sophia, and the com- position of fol. lv, the same cannot be said for the precise combination of elements on fol. 2r: Arculf could not have painted a word picture for Adomnan of a Palestinian cross surrounded by separate zoa, since a tradition separating the four-headed cherub-tetramorph into independent Liv- ing Creatures did not exist in the Syro-Palestinian sphere.'78 Despite all this, the miniature has certain unusual fea- tures expressive of the image-maker's intent to develop and elaborate his loca sancta etiology. The Evangelist symbols are emphatically upright and the expanded terminal at the base of the vertical shaft of the interlaced cross is de- monstrably taller than the other three and filled with a bolder pattern of knotwork. Together, these elements de- fine the cross as upright - as standing on the lower border of the central compartment. No examples of a standing cross with Evangelist symbols in its interspaces earlier than the Durrow composition survive, but a related arrange- ment is to be found in the early fifth-century apse mosaic of S. Pudenziana, Rome (Fig. 20). The Golgotha hill with its monumental jeweled cross fills the upper part of the mosaic. In the streaked heavens placed two by two on either side of the crux gemmata (but not in the cross interspaces) are the Apocalyptic beasts. Most important, the cross is supported on a boxlike base.179 The S. Pudenziana-Durrow analogy is too imprecise to suggest an Early Christian Roman model for the Insular miniature. But it does suggest a reading of the upright cross on fol. 2r with its enlarged base as the Cross of Golgotha. Once again, Adomnan's Holy Places is remarkably helpful in explicating this imagery. To be recalled is Arculf's de- scription of the large silver Cross on Golgotha hill and the column nearby marking the spot where a miracle revealed to Helena which of the three crosses she had discovered was the True Cross. The relation of the column to the sun proved that Jerusalem was at the center of the world. The tradition on the miracle of the crosses is very confused, but 177 Such a reading does not preclude the influence of related ideas. For example, the five-cross arrangement recalls the five jewels (the five wounds of Christ) on the cross in The Dream of the Rood; Raw, 240-241; Mahler (as in n. 78), 444-449. And, as shown by M.H. Caviness, "Images of Divine Order and the Third Mode of Seeing," Gesta, xxmII, 1983, 99-120, there are early medieval schemata with a formal syntax for expressing divinity quite similar to our five-cross display. Also of interest is Milan, Bibl. Ambrosiana Ms. 23 sup., an early 7th-century Orosius from Bobbio; Alexander, 28; Roth, 91-93. Folio lv, sometimes described as the earliest Insular carpet page, contains a large central rosette and four smaller cor- ner marigolds. These floral forms have been related to the Chi Rho mon- ogram (Stevenson, 3; Lionard [as in n. 13], 110; and given an apotropaic function (R. Mellinkoff, "The Rosette-Motif in Syrian, Coptic and North African Early Christian Art: An Iconographic Study," M.A. thesis, Uni- versity of California, Berkeley, 1962). Finally, the Hypothesis frontis- pieces to the canon tables in Early Christian Greek Gospel books some- times have arrangements similar to the Orosius folio 1v composition. In the 6th-century Vienna Gospels (Ost. Nationalbibl. Cod. 847), the Hy- pothesis wreath has rosettes instead of the usual Evangelist portraits at the cardinal points, and a central cross; at each corner of the page is a highly stylized tree in the form of a cross; see Underwood, 112, fig. 58. 17s Cf.

Rome, S. Pudenziana (photo: C.R. Morey) Verdier has shown that Adomnan and Bede relied on a rare Syrian version of the Inventio legend for their reference.'"8 As has been noted, Verdier reconstructs the city gate col- umn as completed by a cross and an imago clipeata of Christ, an alliance found not only in the Veneration of the Cross scenes on the Palestinian ampullae but proposed for the Martyrium apse and ciborium above the silver Gol- gotha cross. This iconographic connection is in accord with an interpretation of the column as a sort of surrogate Cross of Golgotha indicated by Adomnan's text: his column ref- erences emphasize the Golgotha Cross-Tree of Life rela- tionship and meaning. In describing the column, Adomnan quotes Ezekiel and Daniel on the cosmic tree planted at the center of the earth;T81 he refers to the idea of the cross at the earth's center in Jerome and Cyril of Jerusalem.'82 Indeed, his library con- tained Jerome's In Ezechielem with this reference.1' The early chants sung in the middle of the atrium of the Holy Sepulchre - the place known as "the garden," "Paradise," and "the New Eden" where the omphalos marked the center of the world from which flowed the four rivers, emblematic of the four Gospels - incorporate these notions and are 180 Helena is not associated with the original excavation of the area around Golgotha and the site of the tomb in the contemporary literature; nor do the first chroniclers mention a discovery of fragments of the Cross. Not until the sermon on St. John's Gospel by John Chrysostom (ca. 390) is the "Inventio" mentioned. He describes three buried crosses, with the True Cross distinguished by its inscription in the middle (Homiliae in Johannis, xxc. 1, Pat. gr., LIX, 461, 932). But it was Ambrose in 395 who was the first to connect Helena with the discovery: she found three crosses; the True Cross had its titulus with "Jesus of Nazareth king of the Jews" (De obitu Theodosii, XLI f., ed. O. Faller, C.S.E.L., LXXIII, 395). In Rufinus, the pilgrimage is set at the time of the Council of Nicaea. Helena found the three crosses beneath the temple of Venus. Aided by Macarius, the bishop of Jerusalem, she had these crosses brought to the bedside of a gravely ill woman; the True Cross was revealed by restoring the woman to full health (Historia Ecclesiastica, x, 7-8; Pat. lat., xxI, 475-477). So- zomen (ca. 444) closely follows Rufinus, but adds the detail that the three crosses were found near the Tomb. Moreover, not only was a woman cured by the touch of the Cross, but "someone [else] was raised from the dead" (Historia Ecclesiastica, 11, 1; Pat. gr., LXVII, 932f.). In his letter written in 403 to accompany a gift of a fragment of the wood to Sulpicius Severus, Paulinus of Nola eliminated Macarius from the discovery ac- count and made the resurrection miracle alone the key to the identification of the True Cross (Epistola, xxxi, 3f.; Pat. lat., LXI, 325f.). Sulpicius Severus reiterated this account (Hist. Sac., 11, 34-88; Pat. lat., xx, 148f.). Although Gregory of Tours, Historia francorum, I, 34; Pat. lat., LXVII, 9f., cites the resurrection miracle in his account, it is Sulpicius Severus's version that of the early discovery stories comes closest to Adomnan. For the later Syrian texts closely similar to Adomnan and Bede, see Verdier, 24, n. 24, 25. J.G. Davies (as in n. 18) proposes that the hemisphere with twelve columns at the west end of the Martyrium defined a circle and supported a dome. This area, he suggests, was sacred to the Invention and served as chapel. See further, Frolow, 1961, 51f., esp. 155-158, 167f.; "Croix et Crucifix," D.A.C.L., III, 3045-31; Hunt, 28-49. 181 Ezekiel 17:22-24; Daniel 4:7-14. See P.

In the Syrian Book of the Cave of Treasures, associated with Ephraem the Syrian, the Cross-Tree of Life connection is expressed as follows (The Book of the Cave of Treasures, ed. and trans. E.A. Wallis Budge, London, 1927, 63): "That tree of Life which was in the midst of Paradise prefigured the Redeeming Cross, which is the veritable Tree of Life, and this is that was fixed in the middle of the earth." 183 D.L.S., ii, 29, Meehan, 98. See Bullough, I, 125.</page><page sequence="38">THE CROSS-CARPET PAGE IN THE BOOK OF DURROW 211 recorded in the Typicon of Jerusalem.84 The Fathers gave an allegorical meaning to the four tributaries issuing from the Garden, which were planted by the Lord in Eden to fill the whole world - Phison, Gihon, Tigris, and Euphrates (Genesis 2:10-14).185 A similar reading is found in the Ex- positio IV evangeliorum, an Irish treatise possibly written in the third quarter of the eighth century, in which im- portant aspects of earlier exegetical tradition are pre- served.'" In the text, the source of the four rivers that nour- ish the world (the Church) is recognized as Christ, and in complex fashion the rivers are linked to the Evangelists, who themselves are associated with the creation of the garden.187 In patristic literature both the Tree of Life and the Gol- gotha Cross are seen as types of the cosmological tree that rises from the center of the earth, supports Heaven, unites creation, and extends God's will through all things. Di- vided into four, it echoes the four divisions of the uni- verse.'" This cosmic tree reminded Early Christians of the letter Chi, the initial letter of the Greek Christos and sign of the pre-Incarnate Savior, the Logos. Borrowing from Plato's concept of the world soul revealing itself in the heavenly Chi, they created the idea of the Logos as the cross shaping the world - the cross as the hinge of the uni- verse.189 In this cosmology, Christ is identified with the Lo- gos and takes on the attributes of the Creator; for Saint John, the Logos-Incarnate embraces all creation; for Saint Paul the cosmos is embodied in the Savior.11? In conse- quence, the Cross and Christ are often undifferentiated in religious literature and in the liturgy; in art, the cross some- times takes the place of Christ.191 Here we must sharply differentiate textual from pictorial sources. As noted earlier, it seems likely that the Durrow master based much of the composition of fol. 2r on an ear- 184 John 19:41 speaks of the Tomb as a garden. Cyril of Jerusalem (Cath- echesis, xiv, 5, Pat. gr., xxxiii, 829) intimates that the atrium of the Holy Sepulchre was a garden. In the Armenian text that appears in the Synaxary of "Ter Israel" for 13 September (the feast of the Church of the Holy Resurrection at Jerusalem), the Tomb of Christ is set in Paradise and de- scribed as a new Eden and as in "the garden" (Pat. or., vi, 212f.). For the chant, sung on Good Friday, recorded in the Typicon of Jerusalem, see Underwood, 106, who translates it as follows: And Thy life-giving side, like a fountain bubbling forth from Eden, Waters Thy Church, O Christ, like a reasonable Paradise, Thence dividing into sources, into Four Gospels, Watering the universe, purifying creation, And teaching the nations faithfully to worship Thy Kingdom. See also references in Murray (as in n. 21), 321; Verdier, 28; Underwood, 97, 105. 185 For example, see Ambrose, De Paradiso, III, 16; Pat. lat., xiv, 279; Augustine, De Genesi contra Manichaeos, iii, 13-14; Pat. lat., xxxiv, 202- 204; Jerome, Commentariorum in Evangelium Matthaei Praef.; Pat. lat., xxvi, 15-22; Paulinus of Nola, Ep., xxii, 10, C.S.E.L., xxix, 286; Cyprian, Ep., LXXIII, 10), C.S.E.L., III, 785. See, especially, Irenaeus, Adversus Haereses, Iin, 11, 8; Pat. lat. vii, 885f., who links the four Gospels to the four creatures of Ezekiel's Vision, the four regions of the cosmos, and the four winds; a similar grouping is found in a treatise on the Greek alphabet by S. Saba of Jerusalem (439-531); A. Hebbelynck, Les Mysteres des lettres grecques d'apres un manuscrit copte-arabe de la Bibliotheque Bodleienne d'Oxford, Louvain, 1902, 57. 186 This work has been erroneously attributed to Jerome and Gregory, among others. Recension 1 appears in Pat. lat., xxx, 531-590, 114, 861- 916, for Jerome and Wilfrid of Strabo. For study of the text, see B. Bis- choff, "Wendpunkte in der Geschichte der lateinischen Exegese im Friihmittelalter," in idem, Mittelalterliche Studien, 240-241; R.E. Mc- Nally, "The Evangelists in the Hiberno-Saxon Tradition," in Festschrift Bernhard Bischoff, Stuttgart, 1971, 111-122. 187 Pat. lat., xxx, 533, 549: "Fison, insufflatio, significat Ionnem. Geon, uelocitas, significat Mattheum. Tigris, felicitas, significat Marcum. Eu- phrates, fertilitas, significat Lucan." Similar combinations occur in Pseudo- Isidore's Liber de numeris, an Irish compilation of biblical and other ma- terials from southeast Germany (ca. 775); R.E. McNally, "Der Irische Liber de Numeris: Eine Quellen-analyse des pseudo-isidorischen Liber de nu- meris," Ph.D. diss., Munich, 1957, 73-74. 188 The Early Christian Fathers adopted pre-Christian cosmological ideas, transferring Platonic and Pythagorean cosmology to the Cross, i.e., Jus- tin, Apologia, I, 60; Pat. gr., v, 417. For discussion of this dependence, see Rahner (as in n. 21), 369-387; J. Sieper, "Das Mysterium des Kreuzes in der Typologie der alten Kirche," Kyrios, ix, 1969, 20, 77. Even as early as the 2nd century, Irenaeus perceived the four divisions of the universe in the four divisions of the cross: Epideixis, I, 34, trans. J.A. Robinson, The Demonstration of Apostolic Preaching, London, 1920, 101-102. In the pseudo-Cyprian poem De Pascha (Cyprian, Opera, ed. Hartel in C.S.E.L., III, 305f.), the cross, conceived as a cosmic tree and identified with Christ and the Church, unites Heaven and earth, embracing all cre- ation; cf. E.S. Greenhill, "The Child in the Tree: A Study of the Cos- mological Tree in Christian Tradition," Traditio, x, 1954, 323-371, esp. 338f. Jerome (Commentariorum in Epistolam ad Ephesios, 11, 3; Pat. lat., xxvi, 522) and Augustine (Tractatus in Joannis, xix; Pat. lat., xxxv, 1949- 53) cite Paul's letter to the Ephesians (3:17-19) as a reference to the Cross, a mysterious sign existent before creation, mirroring the ampliation of God's thought through all things. And Augustine (Sermo LIV, CLXV; Pat. lat., xxxvIII, 371f.; 903f.) often speaks of the cosmic dimension of the Cross. In Gregory of Nyssa (In Christi resurrectionem oratio, I; Oratio catechetica, xxxII; Pat. gr., XLVI, 621-625; XLV, 77-81) the Cross is likened to a cosmic seal; it becomes the four main extensions of the world. Through the instrument of his Crucifixion, Christ unites and balances the universe. The idea of the Cross as an all-embracing tree with four extensions uniting Heaven and earth and identified with Christ and the Church ap- pears in Bede, In S. Joannis Evangelium Expositio, Pat. lat., xcII, 913. The Irish Expositio IV Evangeliorum (Pat. lat., xxx, 661) also makes ref- erence to the extension of the four arms of the Cross as a sign of divine kingship in the universe. See further J. D1olger's studies published in the Jahrbuch fiir Antike und Christentum, I-Ix, 1958-66. 189 A sort of accumbent Chi is formed of the intersection of the two circles of the heavens, the equator, and the elliptic. For Early Christian exegetes this became a heavenly cross. Irenaeus (Adversus haeresis, v, 18, 3, ed. W.W. Harvey, Cambridge, 1857, 11, 374-375) saw the allegorical aspect of the sacred name as bringing forward the idea of the Incarnation of the Word and the death of the Savior; Gregory of Nyssa was undoubtedly referring to the Chi when he said that Christ unites and harmonizes the universe through the form of his death (see n. 188). Also: G.B. Ladner, "St. Gregory of Nyssa and St. Augustine on the Symbolism of the Cross," in Late Classical and Medieval Studies in Honor of A.M. Friend, Princeton, 1955, 88-90; R. Grigg, 'Symphonian Aeid- tus Basileias': "An Image of Imperial Harmony on the Base of the Column of Arcadius," Art Bulletin, LIX, 1977, 477, nn. 58, 59; Chazelle, 13. 190 John, 1:1-18; cf. R. Schnackenburg, Das Johannesevangelium, Frei- burg, 1967, 197-207, 257-290; Paul, Letter to the Romans, 1:16-20. In the 2nd-century Acts of Saints John and Peter (see n. 36), the Cross is de- scribed as invisible or as formed of light, above which is the living Christ indwelling in the Cross itself. 191 See Frolow, 1965, 239-252; Dobrzyeniecki, xvIIi, 215-224.</page><page sequence="39">212 THE ART BULLETIN JUNE 1990 VOLUME LXXII NUMBER 2 lier work of art. This exemplar may have been a Coptic miniature displaying the four heavenly zoa in the quad- rants of a large central cross. Very probably, the Living Creatures in the upper compartments of the Durrow page were replaced by Evangelist symbols modeled on those in- troducing each of the separate Gospel texts; those below were modified to conform to Insular taste. Though far from certain, it is conceivable that the central cross in the model was intended to evoke the idea of the Golgotha Cross.192 For our purposes, the question of the origin of the visual sources is far less important than that of the use to which the image on fol. 2r was put. Clearly, the set of terrestrial Evangelist symbols consulted by the Durrow master for his separately pictured symbols signify he had little need of non-pictorial aid in transforming imported zoa into sym- bols of the Gospel authors. But his insistence on a prom- inent base for his central cross is quite another matter. Whatever may be the symbolism of the cross in a possible picture model, its meaning for the Durrow master would seem to reflect Adomnan's knowledge of the Cross of Gol- gotha. Most important, the placement of the page opposite fol. lv is thematically in accord with the loca sancta pre- sentation of De locis sanctis. Together, fols. lv and 2r appear to constitute a single demonstration intended to evoke two of the principal loca sancta of the Holy Sepulchre - the two closely associated with the Good Friday Adoratio crucis and related Cross festivals. Fol. lv would seem to refer to the altar in the Church of Golgotha on which the precious relic of the wood and titulus once rested. The facing miniature, fol. 2r, I sur- 192 We can take the example of the early 5th-century apse mosaic of S. Pudenziana, Rome as representing an early stage in the process leading to the substitution of the cross for Christ. Christ is enthroned between groups of Apostles before an architectural background incorporating views of the historical Jerusalem and symbolizing the Heavenly City. Above the Savior's head appears Golgotha hill and its monumental jeweled cross. As noted above, the Apocalyptic beasts-Evangelist symbols are placed on either side. Appearing directly above Christ, the Golgotha Cross becomes the "throne" around which oscillate the heavenly creatures - the at- tendants at the heavenly throne in John; E. Dinkler, Das Apismosaik von S. Apollinare in Classe, Cologne, 1964, 54f.; Y. Christe, "Les Represen- tations medievales d'Ap. IV(-V) en visions de Seconde Parousie: Origines, textes et contexte," Cahiers archbologiques, xxiiI, 1974, 53-72. Viewed alone, the cross and symbols arrangement begins to resemble the Cross- Majesty. So too does the mosaic of several years later in the cupola of Galla Placidia, Ravenna. A central cosmic crux gemmata in a setting of heavenly stars is surrounded by the four Beasts; M. van Berchem and E. Clouzot, Les Mosaiques chrktiennes du IVe au Xe siecle, Geneva, 1924, fig. 104. In the Galla Placidia composition, the four creatures are not yet in the interspaces of the central cross but are thus disposed in the Cross- Majesty decorating a codex held by a bishop in an arcosolium mosaic of probable 5th-century date, in a crypt in the catacomb adjoining the church of S. Gennaro, Naples. The symbols surround a large Latin crux gemmata. L. Nees, "A Fifth-Century Book Cover and the Origin of the Four Evan- gelist Symbols Page in the Book of Durrow," Gesta, xvii, 1978, 3-8, has proposed the iconography of Durrow fol. 2r to be dependent on this Nea- politan presentation. Although in "The Durrow Four Evangelist Page Once Again," Gesta, xx, 1981, 23-33, I rejected the possibility that the interlaced cross or Evangelist symbols type in the Durrow miniature was inspired by the S. Gennaro mosaic, I did not rule out the possible influence of an early Latin cross-quadrants design related to that of the Naples represen- tation on the Durrow composition. This now appears less likely. The agreement between the Golgotha Cross and symbols iconography in Dur- row and medieval Nubian and Ethiopic arrangements suggests that, be- sides a textual source for the idea of the Golgotha Cross, a pictorial ex- emplar may also have been available, with the latter being possibly of Coptic origin and displaying four zoa in the quadrants of the Jerusalem Cross. Some suggestion of this can be found in a 7th-century Syrian Gospel book in Wolfenbiittel (Herzog-August Bibl. Ms 3. I. 300 Aug.). On fol. 248v a cross with the apocalyptic A and w suspended from its horizontal beam is supported by a stepped base. At the crossing is an imago clipeata of Christ. Combined are the cosmic quadulatoral references cited earlier and the image of the Golgotha Cross at the center of the Earth-Universe; cf. Dobrzeniecki, xviii, 227, n. 65. Later in 10th- and 11th-century Nubian frescoes the Cross is often represented with a central codex-carrying bust of Christ. Always the four zoa occupy the cross quadrants. The head of Adam appears in the prominent stepped base of the Cross and there are details alluding to the Tree of Life. References to the Crucifixion and the Cross on Golgotha hill are here united with the Apocalyptic Living Crea- tures - of a type figuring in Early Christian liturgical Majesty scenes - to articulate a complex Majestas Crucis iconography; P. van Moorsel, "Une Theophanie nubienne," Rivista di archeologia cristiana, xLII, 1966, 297-316; idem, "Die Nubie und das glorreiche Kreuz," Bulletin Antieke Beschaving, xLvII, 1972, 125f.; Dobrzeniecki, xviii, 215-308. There are no surviving examples of Early Christian Majestas Crucis compositions from Egypt. Although the evidence in support of a de- pendence of the Nubian presentations on Coptic example is extensive, it does not lend itself to brief review. It should be pointed out, however, that Coptic precedents exist for the Golgotha Cross type itself. For ex- ample, there is an Early Christian textile in the Victoria and Albert Mu- seum on which a cross stands affixed to an orb. Small circles are on the points of the cross and small chains link the side arms and upper part of the stem. An oval medallion containing a head of a man is at the crossing; at the foot of the cross are two creatures, probably a bird and a fish. Above the cross is a vine branch, a leaf, grapes, and two large doves. Usually only Christ can be represented in an imago clipeata at the center of a cross - as, for example, on the Bobbio ampullae (Grabar, pls. xxxIv- xxxvi). K. Wessel, Coptic Art, New York, 1965, 228-229, pl. 128, inter- prets the cross and medallion as symbolizing the crucified Christ, the doves the Apostles; the vine branch and grapes stand for the relationship be- tween Christ and his church. Wessel believes this arrangement is based on a Palestinian model. Also important is a painted, bejeweled Latin cross of 8th-century date in a niche in the Kellia near Wadi Natrum. At the crossing is a bust of Christ; M. Rassart-Debergh, "La Peinture copte avant le XIIe si&amp;cle: Une Approche," Acta ad archaeologiam et artium historiam pertinentia, Miscellanea coptica, ix, 1981, 241-243, pl. via. As I attempted to demonstrate in a separate study (Werner, 1987 [as in n. 178], 1-35), Coptic theophanies with the four Living Creatures had a marked impact on the early medieval West. In some cases the zoa are part of displays not unlike the Nubian Majestas Crucis frescoes. That demonstrations combining the Golgotha Cross, Tree of Life, and four Evangelist symbols existed in early medieval Latin art is proven by the imagery of the 8th-century Lombard Sigwald relief in the Callixtus Baptistry, Cividale, and in the Harley Gospels (Brit. Lib., Harley Ms 2788), a product of the Carolingian Palace School. In the Cividale relief, an interlaced cross is flanked by candelabra, Trees of Life, and rosettes sym- bolizing sun and moon. A Tree of Life surrounded by animals appears below and both groupings are bordered by figure-8 designs containing the four symbols. In the Harley Gospels, fols. 6v and 7v display canon tables above which Evangelist symbols are placed on either side of a Tree from which emerges a cross. For the Sigwald relief, see F. Kayser, Kreuz und Rune: Langobardisch-romanische Kunst in Italien, Stuttgart, 1964, I, 100-101, pl. 54. For Harley Gospels, see W. Koehler, Die karolingischen Miniaturen, ii, Die Hofschule Karls des Grossen, 1958, pls. 42, 43.</page><page sequence="40">THE CROSS-CARPET PAGE IN THE BOOK OF DURROW 213 mise, alludes to the Tree of Life-True Cross of Golgotha- Paradise at the center of the world and the monumental Cross erected on Calvary to commemorate Christ's death and Resurrection. The De locis sanctis and Irish Expositio texts suggest that the four Evangelist symbols on the page were allegorically connected with the four rivers in the gar- den where the Tree of Life stood - the Tree guarded by cherubim (Genesis 2:22, Ezekiel 10:2) identified with the zoa - the center and pivot of the universe.193 In a recent study of the XPI incipit of the Book of Kells, Suzanne Lewis has argued that this nomen sacrum is a cos- mological symbol and she compares it with the Chi on fol. 23v in Durrow (Fig. 21). A tiny cross is inserted above the intersection of the arms of the Durrow Chi, indicating that "the patristic associations of Chi, the cross and the nomen sacrum were well known in Hiberno-Saxon scriptoria by the late seventh century."194 If, as I would suggest, fol. 2r expresses this same Platonizing cosmogony, and its Gol- gotha Cross was intended to call up the idea of the Christ- Logos-Cross-Chi shaping the universe, a like notion may also be expressed by the patriarchal cross on the facing page. There are many references to the nomen sacrum in early Irish exegetical literature,195 and if it is accepted that the upper bar of the fol. lv cross refers to the title board with its inscription lesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum (John 19:19-20) and hence to the nomen sacrum, it seems possible to discover in the cross a schematic allusion to the cos- mology of fol. 2r.196 Again, the two opening miniatures in the Book of Durrow are seen to evoke complementary ideas. Finally, the idea of the Cross of Golgotha in the Garden of Eden with its four rivers/Evangelists at the center of the world inferred from a reading of Adomnan's text is, of course, at the heart of the iconography of the Veneration of the Cross scenes on the Palestinian pilgrims flasks and the lost mosaics and frescoes of the Holy Sepulchre. My conclusions concerning the connections between De locis sanctis and the Durrow introductory miniatures must therefore allow for the possibility of the influence of un- recorded dialogue on the holy sites between Arculf and Adomnan. What of the effect of the Christological discussions that may have been a legacy of Arculf's stay on Iona? The Gallic pilgrim, it will be remembered, was in Constantinople at the time of the sixth Ecumenical Council. Can it be doubted that he would have reported its critical consequences to the scholarly Adomnan? Patristic tradition formulated a con- ception of Incarnation and Salvation within the framework of the cosmology of the Cross. The place assigned the Mes- siah in the history of Israel and the idea of the origin and nature of Christ provide the foundation of the Incarnation doctrine on which orthodox Christology rests. The True Cross figured among the major proofs of the Savior's In- carnation. Its emblem on fol. lv in our Insular manuscript must, therefore, by definition have a Christological sig- nification. But it is the iconographic definition arrived at by juxtaposing fols. 1v and 2r that takes into account the more complex themes of Christological dogma. The fig- uration of the patriarchal cross in the first miniature dem- onstrates, as it were, Christ's humanity and alludes to his suffering and death on the Cross. With its Majestas-Crucis, the facing page articulates the idea of Christ-Logos in Par- adise. He is the Second Person of the Trinity at the end of time perpetually worshipped by the heavenly creatures. In precise combination, the Durrow pages define the basic or- thodoxy of the heavenly Christ as at once fully man and fully God. As in The Dream of the Rood, a subtle balance is maintained between the vision of a suffering sentient being shedding his blood on the Cross and that of a vic- torious, transcendental, and eternal God. Christ suffers yet he is triumphantly divine.197 If the Savior's Incarnation reveals his human nature, his Resurrection eloquently proclaims that he is God. That Je- sus was buried and was raised points to an objective Res- urrection in which his human body no longer remained in the Tomb. He was "raised up" to reign at the Father's right hand (Acts 2:22-36). Consideration of the sacred numbers conceived in the Middle Ages as an expression of divine 193 What may be a similar two-part demonstration is found in the Car- olingian Gospels of St. Gauzelin at Nancy, a product of the School of Tours. Fol. 2v presents a distich referring to the Evangelists as "flowing" from one "fountain" or source, inscribed above and below images of four codices of the Gospels placed so as to form the corners of a rectangle at whose center is a Chrism. On fol. 3v the Lamb surrounded by symbols of the Evangelists appears in a lozenge. Four medallions with represen- tations of prophets complete the composition. See Underwood, 127-129, fig. 66. Koehler (as in n. 192), Die Schule von Tours, Berlin, 1938, pl. 35. 194 S. Lewis, "Sacred Calligraphy: The Chi-Rho Page in the Book of Kells," Traditio, xxxvI, 1980, 144, n. 17, describes how the Alexandrian exegetes emphasized the idea of Christ as Logos in their writings on the nomen sacrum. In Durrow a small cross appears not only above the Chi initial, but above the In principio of John on fol. 193r, highlighting, Lewis says, the reference to Christ as the Verbum. See further "Nomina sacra," D.A.C.L., xII, 1478-81. 195 Lewis (as in n. 194), 142, n. 8. 196 Bischoff (as in n. 186), 207-208, discussed the relationship between the titulus inscription and the idea of the "three sacred languages" in early Irish exegetical literature. Cf. also R.E. McNally, "The 'Tres Lingua Sacra' in Early Biblical Exegesis," Theological Studies, xix, 1958, 395-403. 197 Suggestions of Christological meaning appear elsewhere. G. Schiller, Iconography of Christian Art, ii, The Passion of Jesus Christ, Greenwich, Conn., 1972, 91-99, conjectures that the figures of Longinus and Stepha- ton in the Crucifixion scenes in the Rabula Gospels and on the Sancta Sanctorum relic box symbolize the opposition between life and death and hence the double identity of God and man in Christ: dying as a man on the Cross, the Savior becomes God and overcomes death. According to Schiller, the Syro-Palestinian Crucifixion motif depends upon contem- porary Christological thought on the death of Christ. Roe (as in n. 110) has noted the constant appearance of the two soldiers in Crucifixion scenes on the Irish high crosses. The thieves also appear in the Durham Gospels Crucifixion, in later Crucifixion miniatures, and in Insular metalwork rep- resentations. Both Roe and Werckmeister point to a source for such im- agery in the Palestinian ampules.</page><page sequence="41">214 THE ART BULLETIN JUNE 1990 VOLUME LXXII NUMBER 2 .! : -:! i - ii i . i i :-. i::: : .: :. i-,---:-i,-:-i .: : :i:.!::: .. .... ]iu .. i . :iiiii:iii~i ii: - i:i ::i _ :: .ii: i:ii-_i-i:. :";&lt;:::::iiiii !::@ :::i iii :;i:i~::i :i4 :: . :"'!iLi::Fi~~ i iii:,,: ii: i : :i? : E :: ::-iiq:i- :i'i;ii:B ,ii',i',i i@ i',iiiii !~~ @ : ::: ::g..::. : i ::; ::, : -': :::'''---iii;--~l:-::i:: ii .. . ,i ; .4?

Dublin, Trinity College MS 57 (A.iv.5), fol. 23v (photo: Trinity College)</page><page sequence="42">THE CROSS-CARPET PAGE IN THE BOOK OF DURROW 215 order suggests that Durrow fol. 1v refers not only to In- carnation but to Resurrection.198 Of major importance to Insular exegetes,199 number symbolism seems to find expres- sion in our miniature. Beyond the quaternities200 already cited, the four corner crosses on fol. lv (and the four Evan- gelist symbols on fol. 2r) may allude to an almost infinite number of applicable tetrads found in early Insular texts, including the four kinds of wood of the Cross, the four nails, and the four divisions of Christ's garment.201 But it is the numerological symbolism inherent in the squares of crossings and terminals of the central yellow cross that I would consider most relevant. Saint Augustine's Epistola LV ad inquisitiones Januarii helped shape the complex character of Christian numer- ology.202 In it, the great theologian examined the meaning of Easter by means of the symbolism of the sacred numbers six, seven, and eight. For Augustine, six designates the sixth day, Good Friday, and refers directly to the Crucifixion and the Cross. It also specifies the Incarnation. (It is noteworthy that Bede also writes of the creation of Christ as occurring on the same day [Friday] as his death.)203 Augustine states that seven is the seventh day, the Jewish Sabbath, and the day of Christ's interlude in the Tomb. Eight to him is the eighth day, the Sunday morning when the Savior disap- peared from the Tomb, the day of Resurrection.204 By the early Middle Ages, this formulation had become quite pop- ular and even found expression in the liturgy. In the Gre- gorian Sacramentary, for example, a Benediction states "ye be renewed by the resurrection of the number eight."205 The patriarchal cross in Durrow fol. 1v is, of course, composed of eight connected squares. In turn, the squares are filled with smaller squares containing checkerboard or T-shaped designs not employed elsewhere on the page. Hence, the eight squares are given an unusual prominence. The iconographic references I have already suggested for fols. lv-2r and the Insular love of numerology serve to sup- port the probability that the Durrow artist's emphasis on his eight squares is a consequence of his wish to validate the importance of the eighth day, Easter Sunday, the day of the Resurrection.206 The ideas of Christ's humanity and divinity inherent in the juxtaposition of fols. lv-2r and the Resurrection sym- bolism articulated by numerological analysis of the eight- square cross tend to confirm the strong possibility that Ar- culf brought news of the Sixth Ecumenical Council to Iona. Reference to the eighth day, Easter Sunday, also brings us back to consideration of the True Cross cult itself. Easter is the name of the day, the week, and the entire season in which the Church commemorates the Resurrec- tion. The Cross is its central theme and symbol; the Ador- 198 On medieval number symbolism, see W. Horn, "On the Selective Use of Sacred Numbers in Carolingian Architecture of a New Aesthetic Based on Modular Concepts," Viator, vi, 1975, 351-390; C. Heitz, "Symbolisme et architecture: Les Nombres et l'architecture religieuse du haut Moyen Age," in Simboli e simbologia nell' alto medioevo, Spoleto, 1976, 387f. 199 The Irish delighted in numeration. In the texts we read of three kinds of pilgrimage, seven gates of Heaven guarded by seven archangels, the four Evangelists who are related to the four zoa of Ezekiel, the four mer- cenaries who divided Christ's cloak, etc.; F.J. Byrne, "Seventh Century Documents," Irish Ecclesiastical Record, cvIii, 1967, 164-182, esp. 170- 171; Kenney, nos. 109-111. Sacred numbers were also important to the Anglo-Saxons. Bede devoted much of his theological and exegetical writ- ing to complex disquisitions on numbers; cf. De temporem ratione, i, Pat. lat., xc, 295-298; De Arithmeticis numeris, in ibid., 641-648; De Com- puto, in ibid., 647-652. See C. Jenkins, "Bede as Exegete and Theologian" in Bede, His Life, Times and Writings (as in n. 88), 173-180. Henderson, 41, notes that Bede in his Life of Saint Cuthbert mentions a copy of Saint John's Gospel owned by Boisil of Melrose, which was made up of seven quires. This, Henderson says, corresponds to the number of carpet pages in the Book of Durrow if the "missing" Saint Matthew carpet page is included. He also suggests the forty-two spirals on fol. 3v and forty-two animals on fol. 192v may refer to the number of generations of Christ in Matthew 1:1-17. 200 On the number four, see A.W. Buckland, "Four as a Sacred Number," Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, xxv, 1896, 96-112; Underwood, 71-72. 201 And besides the four zoa and four Evangelists, there are the four Gos- pels, the four chrism crosses of the ceremony of altar consecration, the four rivers of Paradise, the four axis of the cosmos, the four cardinal points, the four cardinal virtues, the four humors of the body, the four seasons, the four major prophets, the four elements, and the four principal mysteries of Christ. In De templo Solomonis (Pat. lat., XCL, 735-808), Bede cites the number four as suited to evangelical perfection, being the number of the Evangelists. 202 IX, 17; XI, 20; cxiv, 24, Pat. lat., xxxIII, 204f., trans. J.G. Cunningham in The Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, I, 303-316; cf. Underwood, 84-87. 203 De tempore ratione, xxx, 41; Pat. lat. xc, 426-430; C.W. Jones (as in n. 80), 236. See also the letter of Cyril of Alexandria to Leo the Great (Pat. lat., LIv, 605-606) for the idea that Christ's conception took place on the same day of the year as his Crucifixion. The Christian Topography of Cosmos Indicopleustes, ed. E.O. Winstedt, Cambridge, 1909, 136, lines 6-8, refers to the conception as happening in the same season as the Resurrection. 204 Significantly, Bede (De Templo Solomonis, viII; Pat. lat., xci, 752- 753) informs us that fifteen, which is seven plus eight, can signify the future life anticipated in the Sabbath rest of the faithful and attained at the end of the world in the resurrection of the dead. He notes that the two parts of the number seven (three plus four) when multiplied suggest the apostolic twelve. See Horn (as in n. 198), 356, n. 11. 205 L.A. Muratori, Liturgica romana, Venice, 1748, ii, 364; also H.A. Wil- son, The Gregorian Sacramentary, London, 1915, 304. In the Epistles of Barnabas, xxv, 8, 9; (Pat. gr. 732) we read, ". . . we also celebrate . . . the eighth day in which Jesus also rose from the dead and was made manifest and ascended to heaven." See, further, Underwood, 81-82, n. 155-156; J. Danidlou, The Bible and Liturgy, Notre Dame, 1956, 262-286; Henderson, 159. 206 Perhaps Arculf's description of the Anastasis may have had numer- ological significance for the Durrow scribe-artist. Arculf refers to three altars, twelve columns, eight doors, and the twelve lamps "according to the number of the twelve holy apostles" divided into groups of four and eight lamps. Given that the Gallic bishop was speaking of the tomb itself, it would not be unlikely that Adomnan understood the references to the number eight as indicating the Resurrection. Moreover, although Arculf speaks only of twelve columns in the Anastasis, Krautheimer (as in n. 83), 91, has demonstrated that from the 4th century the columns were separated into sets of three by pairs of piers on the major axes. The piers numbered eight.</page><page sequence="43">216 THE ART BULLETIN JUNE 1990 VOLUME LXXII NUMBER 2 atio crucis is its central Cross ritual.207 Adomnan described elaborate Easter Adoratio ceremonies at Hagia Sophia. If the foregoing analysis of the iconography of the Durrow opening miniatures is correct, the knowledge of these rites must have been instrumental in shaping the character of this locution.208 That the textual apparatus and decoration of other parts of our codex were affected by these same interests now becomes a distinct possibility. But such con- siderations are beyond the scope of this paper. Adomnan, Iona, and the Creation of the Durrow Gospels My analysis of the close relation between the text of Adomnan's De locis sanctis and the opening folios in the Book of Durrow has depended upon a provisional accep- tance of the hypothesis that the Gospel book must have been begun after Arculf's visit of 682 to Iona. Yet although a consensus of sorts has developed around a date in the third quarter of the seventh century, some scholars believe 207 The influence of the Adoratio crucis implies eschatological and soter- iological references in the Durrow program. The Evangelist symbols on fol. 2r depend on Ezekiel and John; as attendants at the Apocalyptic throne in John, they allude to the Second Coming of Christ. The cross in the miniature seems to have this same eschatological character: the Early Christians believed that those parts of the Cross that touched Christ's body miraculously ascended to Heaven to become the cross of the Second Coming, the signum Filli Dominis (Matt. 24:30); cf. Verdier (as in n. 156), n. 53; E. Kantorowicz, "The 'Kings Advent' and the Enigmatic Panels on the Doors of Santa Sabina," Art Bulletin, xxvi, 1944, 225-231. Then too, the early Latin Adoratio crucis hymns often referred to the eschatological cross of the Second Coming and Last Judgment. Leo the Great's eighth homily on the Passion (Sermo, LIX, 6; Pat. lat., LIV, 340-341) preserved in the Roman Breviary as the homily for matins of the Exaltatio, tells how in gazing upon the crucified Christ we are meant to see beyond mere physical appearance; inspired by the incarnate word, we are meant to experience the dazzling grandeur of the Cross. Leo emphatically links the power of the Cross to the glory of the Second Coming - the Cross be- comes Christ's Judgment throne; cf. Y. Christe, La Vision de Matthieu (Matth. XXIV-XXV): Origines et developpement d'une image de la sec- onde Parousie, Paris, 1973, passim, for further references. See also B. Grogan, "Eschatological Teaching in the Early Irish Church," in Biblical Studies: The Medieval Irish Contribution, ed. M. McNamara, Dublin, 1976, 46-58. Patrick (Confession, Iv, Lorica, stanza 2, ed. L. Bieler, The Works of St. Patrick, London, 1953, 22, 69), Columba (Altus prosator [see n. 219]) and later Irish and Anglo-Saxon exegetes placed great emphasis on the Second Advent. In The Dream of the Rood, the association between the Crucifixion and the Second Coming is dramatically represented (cf. Raw, 245f.; Lee [as in n. 122], 274f.; J. Canuteson in Modern Philology, LXVI, 1969, 293-297. Bede, in his Homily for the Easter Vigil, emphasizes the intimate connection between Cross and Second Coming (Homilia, xx, Pat. lat., xcIv, 104, 133-144) and takes up the idea that the Second Coming would take place during the Easter Vigil - the principal service of the Easter triduum and the principal occasion for baptism - since the im- mersion of the initiates bound them to the death, burial, and Resurrection of Christ; cf. P.J. West, "Liturgical Style and Structure in Bede's Homily for the Easter Vigil," American Benedictine Review, xxIII, 1972, 1-8. These ideas may find expression in Insular illumination: in St. Gall Stiftsbibl. Ms 51, the Crucifixion miniature is juxtaposed to a miniature of the Second Coming (pp. 266, 267; Alexander, pls. 203, 206); in Turin, Bibl. Naz. Cod. O.Iv.20, an Ascension miniature faces a miniature of the Second Coming (fols. la, 2a), their relationship emphasized by a text of Acts inscribed on the first of the two scenes (Alexander, pls. 279, 280); cf. Christe (as above), 54. Also noteworthy is that Crucifixion and Last Judgment scenes frequently appear in conjunction on Irish high crosses. Important to soteriological meaning are Venantius Fortunatus's Pange lingua for the Good Friday veneration of the Cross and that of the Abe ore verbum prolatium hymns in the Spanish rite. It has been observed that in these hymns (and in Venantius Fortunatus's Crux benedicta nitet) Redemption is the central theme. Unquestionably, for Venantius, the Cross was the Tree of Salvation. In the Pange lingua Christ's life on earth is placed within the framework of the story of mankind's salvation. Ac- cordingly, the chief elements of the composition converge on Incarnation (Nativity) and Passion (Crucifixion), seen as the essential moments of the Redemption; see Szov6rffy (as in n. 55), 6-12. Christian thought presented an intimate connection between the In- carnation and Redemption doctrines. Gregory (Moralia in Job, v, chap. Iv; Pat. lat. LXXV, 682-683), for example, viewed Christ's suffering and death as a sacrificial offering and spoke of the Crucifixion in terms of conflict and triumph; the Fathers often drew together the ideas of divine victory and sacrificial offering with the Redemption. Although in her analysis of The Dream of the Rood, Woolf (as in n. 81), 143, attributed the tension between divinity and triumph, on one hand, and humanity and suffering, on the other, to Christological impetus, she also notes the possibility of contemporary thought on the Redemption as contributing to this tension or balance. That ideas on the Second Coming and Redemption often merge or over- lap is illustrated in the Durham Gospels Crucifixion. Beside Christ's head are the letters A and c and the words initium and finis taken directly from Revelation (1:8). Around the frame of the miniature is a text which speaks of Christ as suffering for us and risen and glorified in Heaven; it seems to refer to his Second Coming and the raising up of the elect to reign with him. All this suggests that in Durrow fol. 2r with its Evangelist symbols and central cross there are allusions to the Crucifixion-Second Coming rela- tionship and that the humanity-divinity equation created by the juxta- position of fols. lv and 2r makes a soteriological as well as a Christological statement. As Woolf noted, The Dream of the Rood was written at a time when both Christology and soteriology placed a double stress on the Cru- cifixion as an event signifying triumph as well as suffering. The Easter liturgy and especially the Good Friday Adoratio encouraged a sacramen- tal participation in the mystery of the Redemption. A similar soteriology for the Durrow miniatures would not be surprising. 208 The possibility of talismanic function must also be considered. J. Leroy, Les Manuscrits syriaques a peintures conserves dans les bibliotheques d'Europe et d'Orient, 2 vols., Paris, 1964, I, 113, has pointed to the like- lihood of a talismatic use for the cross folios opening or closing Syriac Gospel books; and Bischoff, 1966-67, passim, suggests an apotropaic function for similar Latin miniatures. Nees (as in n. 192) 5-6, has inter- preted Durrow fol. 2r in the same terms (see also idem, "Two Illuminated Syriac Manuscripts in the Harvard College Library," Cahiers archBolo- giques, xxIx, 1980-81, 132-142). That fols. lv and 2r in our manuscript may have had an apotropaic function is not surprising. Gospel books were often seen as possessing magical powers by the Early Christians, and T.J. Brown, ed., The Stony- hurst Gospel of Saint John, Oxford, 1969, 30, notes the use of passages from the Gospels (especially John 1:1-5) as charms against sickness; he cites medieval crediting of the Cathach of S. Columba and Book of Dur- row with the power to cure sick men and animals. Moreover, apotropaic use does not conflict with the interpretation suggested here for the Durrow miniature: Paulinus of Nola, Epistola xxxI, 6, ed. W. Hartel, C.S.E.L., xxIx, 374, spoke of the healing powers of fragments of the True Cross; there are numerous apotropaic inscriptions in the form of prayers and poems on Byzantine staurotheke and, as mentioned earlier, from the early days of pilgrimage to Jerusalem, images associated with the holy places were valued for their miraculous power. For references in the early lit- erature to the salutary and curative powers of True Cross fragments, see A. Frolow, "The Veneration of the True Cross at the End of the Sixth and Beginning of the Seventh Centuries," St. Vladimir's Quarterly, II, 1958, 19f.; Verdier, 1973 (as in n. 207), 99, n. 19.</page><page sequence="44">THE CROSS-CARPET PAGE IN THE BOOK OF DURROW 217 that the codex belongs to the first half of the century.209 Even if a terminus a quo of 682 is allowed, arguments fa- voring creation outside Iona cannot be entirely dismissed. Indeed, when we consider the testimony of the True Cross material itself - the cross pericope in the Lindisfarne Gos- pels and the cross hymn in the Book of Cerne - as well as textual and other affiliations between Durrow and cer- tain Northumbrian Gospel books, the thesis of Northum- brian origin seems not without merit.210 Lindisfarne was one of the great houses in the Columban paruchia, but the prospect that it may have been the birth- place of our manuscript is undermined by consideration of the treatment of the man symbol on fol. 21v (Fig. 22). Both Luce and Carol Neuman de Vegvar interpret the head of the Matthew angel - shaven down to stubble at the crown and framed by long strands parted in the middle - as rep- resenting the Celtic tonsure.211 Acknowledgment of this possibility brings us closer to the solution of provenance and date. Meeting in 664, the Synod of Whitby settled the question of the date of Easter and the proper form of ton- sure to the satisfaction of the Roman party. Southern Ire- land had already capitulated in 635. Now Lindisfarne and other Celtic foundations in Northumbria were forced to comply. Northern Ireland remained defiant until 703; Iona, almost alone, continued to follow Celtic practice until 716. If Durrow were Northumbrian, its creation would almost certainly have taken place between 635, when the Irish mis- sion arrived, and 664, after which the Celtic tonsure was abandoned. Few scholars place the manuscript before 650 and most date it to 675 or later.212 The latter date discour- ages contemplation of a Lindisfarne origin since it is highly unlikely that the Celtic tonsure anathema to the Romani would have been permitted in a sacred image after 664. There are those who believe the Book of Durrow was made in Ireland, perhaps at Durrow itself.213 They point to aspects of the text and colophon, the many Celtic deco- rative elements, and the Matthew symbol's tonsure.214 Con- versely, the Anglo-Saxon character of the animal ornament on fol. 192v and the affinity between some of the Evangelist symbols and animals incised on the Pictish stones of Scot- land imply creation in a Columban center outside Ireland, that is to say, in one of the monasteries of the paruchia.215 As Carol Neuman de Vegvar has suggested, the small scale of the Durrow codex and its use of defective and patched vellum imply a foundation without great wealth or royal patronage such as Iona.216 And certainly, the manuscript has many characteristics favoring this view, including its employment of the Celtic tonsure for the Matthew symbol, presumably at a time when Iona (unlike Northumbria and much of Ireland) was still firmly opposed to the Roman form, and its remarkable variety of Celtic, Germanic, Med- iterranean, and possibly Pictish features. Its traditional as- sociation with Saint Columba also fits comfortably with Iona's role as the seat of the Columban paruchia.217 Adomnan presented De locis sanctis to Aldred in 686 at the earliest. In his report on Adomnan's visit (which was probably at Easter), Bede tells us that the Irish abbot was persuaded of the correctness of the Roman Easter calcu- lation. On the same journey he visited the monastery of Jarrow where the monks greatly admired the humility and modesty of his demeanor but were somewhat scandalized by his Irish frontal tonsure. Upon his return to Iona, Adomnan attempted to induce the monks to adopt Roman practice but could not persuade them to abandon traditions 209 See the arguments advanced by Roth, 209-214, and idem, "Early In- sular Manuscripts: Ornament and Archaeology, with Special Reference to the Dating of the Book of Durrow," in Ireland and Insular Art (as in n. 78), 23-29, for dating the codex before 650; and by G.

In other words, Durrow must have been writ- ten and decorated during the years Adomnan labored on his pilgrimage text, a time when he would still have en- couraged a depiction of the Celtic tonsure. One measure of the importance of the True Cross cult for Adomnan would be its persistence in Iona. Can this be tested? Given the anarchic history of the island once the Viking raids had begun in the eighth century, it is not sur- prising that little is known of the history of the cult after the appearance of De locis sanctis. Yet there are intimations of continuity. Let us first consider the "Columban" Altus Prosator, or more precisely its later prefaces.219 Columba left no didactic writings. Of the numerous Irish poems tra- ditionally given to him, none can be attributed with ab- solute certainty. However, the Latin hymns attributed to Columcille may be of the sixth century, and the most im- portant of these, the Altus Prosator, is most probably a product of his hand.220 The hymn, concerned with the na- ture of the Creator, Creation, and Judgment, makes but two brief references to Redemption, a fact of no little im- portance. 1 In the Irish prefaces to the hymn registering beliefs of the tenth century, we read of clerics from Rome coming to Iona to deliver to Columba the gift of a richly enshrined relic of the True Cross (Morgemm) and a book of hymns, both dispatched by Pope Gregory. In return, Columba sent his Altus Prosator to the pontiff. We are told that although the pope was impressed by the hymn, he was troubled by its limited attention to Redemption. In re- sponse, Columba wrote another hymn, Te Christi creden- tium (in reality, a later Irish work).22 The legend of the cross gift was elaborated by Manus O'Donnell in his six- teenth-century life of Columba. O'Donnell writes of Pope Gregory beholding angels of God "letting down a wooden Cross upon the altar," the relic intended for the Irish saint. Most important, he reports that he saw the relic on the island of Tory "working wonders from that day to this in the north of Erin, whither Columcille sent it westward from Iona."22 This altar cross is not known to exist, but from the description it appears to have been of metal and adorned with a central crystal magnifying the relic, in which case it would have been similar to the famous twelfth-century reliquary, the Cross of Cong.224 It may be that here O'Don- nell was attempting to imbue a medieval cross reliquary with the sanctity of Saint Columba.225 Like that in the Altus Prosator prefaces, his story of Gregory's gift is most prob- ably a pious legend - but one acknowledging in oblique fashion the continuity of the True Cross cult on Iona.226 218 Cf. Bede, H.E., v, 21, ed. Plummer, I, 333-345, for the letter of Ceolfrid to the king of the Picts of ca. 710 describing his encounter with Adomnan and relating how the latter could not persuade the monks of Iona to follow his teaching: "If he had more authority he would have made them correct their tonsure." Also H.E., v, 15, ed. Plummer, I, 315-317; The Life of St. Columba ... Written by Adomnan, ed. W. Reeves, xLIx; "MacFirbis's Fragmentary Annals," in J. Radner, ed., Fragmentary Annals of Ireland, Dublin, 1978, 166. It was left to Egbert to bring union of Iona with Rome; Bede, H.E., v, 22, ed. Plummer, I, 346-348. I cannot follow A.A.M. Duncan, "Bede, Iona and the Picts," in R.H.C. Davis and J.K. Wallace-Hadrill, eds., The Writing of History in the Mid- dle Ages: Essays Presented to Richard William Southern, Oxford, 1981, 35, in his reconstruction of Ceolfrid's letter as demonstrating Adomnan's retention of the Celtic tonsure after 686. Nor does it seem credible, as J.M. Picard, "The Purpose of Adomnan's Vita Columbae," Peritia, i, 1982, 160-177, esp. 163-165, and "Bede, Adomnin and the Writing of History," Peritia, III, 1984, 21, 50-70, esp. 59, has argued, that Bede was an un- reliable witness to the dispute between Adomnan and the monks of Iona. According to E. James, "Bede and the Tonsure Question," ibid., 98, the tonsure controversy represented a real conflict over ecclesiastical organization: . . Tonsure came to be seen . .. as a way of publicising . .. allegiance ... [In] the middle of the seventh century it may have contributed much to the bitterness of the dispute which split the newly established English church down the middle and was, on the eve of archbishop Theodore's arrival, threatening its very existence. Because, as James, ibid., 98, points out, Bede tends to underemphasize the importance of tonsure, his references to Adomnan's difficulties with the issue are probably factual.

Before becoming king of Northumbria and inviting Aidan and his monks to Lindisfarne, Oswald had been baptized on Iona and he spent time there as a student.</page><page sequence="47">220 THE ART BULLETIN JUNE 1990 VOLUME LXXII NUMBER 2 Also pertinent is a poem, A Maccucain, Sruith in Tiag, preserved in the twelfth-century Book of Leinster,227 and first edited by L. Gwynn.228 Although the poem had been ascribed to Adomnan, Gwynn concluded it to be a work of eleventh- or twelfth-century creation, which referred to events related to a shrine containing relics assembled by Adomnan.229 The relic list, Gwynn believed, was in whole or in part authentic. Recently J. Carney analyzed the poem as describing a youth whose leather satchel contains books and other objects symbolizing relics of Christ, the Virgin, and various saints, noting that some of these references are to actual relics known to have been venerated by the early Irish Church. Significantly, one of the relics is described as "the famous tree for the Paschal Lamb upon which Christ was crucified."230 Carney sees no reason to reject the tra- ditional ascription of the poem to Adomnan, a conclusion clearly pointing to Adomnan's knowledge of the True Cross cult and to the more remote possibility that the Iona com- munity possessed a fragment of the True Cross around 685. But even if we reject A Maccucain, Sruith in Tiag as evidence for the existence of a True Cross relic in Iona in Adomnan's day, like the Altus Prosator prefaces and O'Donnell's biography, it does seem to suggest a continuing celebration of the cult on the island.231 Underlining this pos- sibility is one among a number of grave slabs displaying simple incised crosses discovered on Iona and probably of seventh- to ninth-century date. Its execution shows two dis- tinct stages of carving. Two conjoined Latin crosses in false relief decorate the upper surface. That near the top has two transoms (Fig. 23). Later the slab was converted into an upright memorial and a sunken Greek cross was inscribed on each face. Thus, the slab preserves what appears to be the outlines of a patriarchal cross.232 This archaeological evidence, together with the literary material cited earlier, suggests that the memory of a tra- dition going back to Arculf's memorable visit did persist on the island well into the Middle Ages. In the end, having considered this evidence of continuity, we must ask whether Abbot Adomnan could have been responsible for inspiring the complex True Cross iconography specified for the Book of Durrow. No doubt he had the requisite intellect. Very probably, he had acquired the necessary knowledge. Rest- ing apparently on an exclusively native curriculum of study, his scholarly accomplishment was high for the seventh cen- tury and won the praise of such luminaries as Bede and Ceolfrid.233 In fact, apart from the hymn Altus Prosator, only Adomnan's De locis sanctis and Vita Columbae pro- vide a reliable picture of the texts read and produced during the first century and a half of the Columban paruchia. As Bullough has shown, the texts consulted by Adomnan in the Iona library were remarkably diverse for the time. Be- sides a large proportion (probably all) of Jerome's text of the Bible, his Onomasticon, In Ezechielem, other com- mentaries on books of the Old Testament, and some of Jerome's letters, the Irish abbot was able to study the He- gesippus (the Latin version of Josephus's Bellum ludaicum), Sulpicius Severus's Chronicon, the Vita Antonii, and the Vita Martini; he employed grammatical commentaries, in- cluding the Virgilius Grammaticus; he probably had access to the Vita Brigidae and the Historia evangelia of Juven- cus.234 To be recalled is his use of previous Itineraria (which include Eucherius's Letter to Faustus) and geographical manuals.235 The subtlety of mind and erudition displayed in De locis sanctis and Vita Columbae are clearly of an order capable of formulating the iconographic content of the Durrow double page. As revealed in these texts, the references to the cosmic tree at the center of the world in Genesis, Ezek- iel, and Daniel and the Golgotha Cross at the center of the earth in Jerome were familiar. Knowledge of the Jerusalem loca sancta was available in Eucherius even before Arculf arrived with his personal testimony. Given the widespread love of Augustine's writings, it would be difficult to imag- ine Adomnan not being familiar with pascha numerology. As the Irish Expositio makes clear, quite recondite parad- isiacal and cosmological texts were being collected by early Irish exegetes. Again, it is unlikely that the greatest of the scholars of the paruchia would not have access to such materials. The Gospel citations in Adomnan's writings tell us little 227 For the Book of Leinster (Dublin, Trinity College Library MS H 2.18 and Francise Library MS A.5), see The Book of Leinster, ed. R.I. Best, M. O'Brien and 0. Bergin, 5 vols., Dublin, 1954-67. 228 L. Gwynn, "The Reliquary of Adomnan," Archivium hibernicum, Iv-v, 1915-16, 199-214.

Dicuil was a native of Ireland who entered the Iona abbey during the lifetime of Suibne and was present when the latter received a monk who had visited the Holy Land. This took place before Suibne's death in 772. See Kenney, 545; M.

It appears Adomnan employed both linguistic and literal-historic speculation.236 Even doctrinal speculation rare for Irish exegetes can be discovered in his writings. For example, because he maintained an agnostic stance on the issue of the bodily assumption of the Virgin, he was prompted to put a series of questions with doctrinal overtones to Arculf about the Virgin's tomb. Bede speaks of Adomnan as sapiens et scientia scripturarum nobilissime instructus, implying his access to works, besides De locis sanctis, in which the abbot exposited on the Scriptures.237 These writings are unfortunately lost, but even the little that remains of Adomnan's scholarship demonstrates his cognizance of the significant intellectual and literary cur- rents of his time - and his own not inconsequential in- tellectual contributions.238 There is good reason, then, to claim the loca sancta and doctrinal references in the Durrow double-page cross de- signs for Adomnan. More circumstantial is the evidence of his knowledge of Christological debate. And most prob- lematic, perhaps, is his response to Arculf's report of the Good Friday Adoratio crucis. That is to say, his interest in Arculf's account of the Easter rites at Hagia Sophia, Con- stantinople, is abundantly clear, but the effect of this tes- timony on the local liturgy is difficult to evaluate. The Latin liturgy used by the early Irish Church is not fully recover- able, and albeit the Cross hymn in the Book of Cerne may indicate the employment of the Adoratio by ca. 700 in Col- umban centers, it is impossible to be certain of its earlier use by the Iona community. Still, liturgists in recent years have pointed to direct Irish borrowings from Eastern Easter liturgies.239 Also to be noted is the Greek text of the Pater ,iiii~i~-iiiiiiiii .X.. iiiiiiii8)iiiii-i -ci-iii;?~ii jii~iy- ii - - L ai__ ?!--_iII__ __ iur= i-iii -:ii :: io "iiii ~ blB ................................ :::': 23 Slab with patriarchal cross, Iona (from J.

He employs a kind of literal exegesis in the last chapter of the first book of De locis sanctis (i, 25). Thus, because Arculf was apparently unable to provide much information on "a church at the right- hand side of Bethany," the abbot used the Synoptic Gospels for the speech Christ gave at Bethany so as to clarify questions of time, place, and im- port. Bullough, I, 122, believes this to be one of the earliest instances of literal-historical exegesis in Irish literature. The method of the early Irish exegetes was inspired by the school of Alexandria, which emphasized mysticism and a multitude of meanings inherent in a sacred text. There is also some evidence - seen in Adomnan - of a knowledge of the literalism and historical sense found in the writing of the Antiochene school. See R.E. McNally, "The Imagination and Early Irish Biblical Exegesis," Annuale mediaevale, x, 1969, 12f. 27 Bede, H.E., v, ed. Plummer, I, 315. 238 Adomnan followed a succession of abbots (including Columba) who were renowned as scribes. He was succeeded by Dorbbene in 713, a "choice scribe" who copied the Vita Columbae; the Annals of Ulster for 802 re- ports the death of Connachtach "eminent scribe and abbot of Ia (Iona)." Quite possibly Adomnan was himself a well-trained scribe and perhaps responsible for the first presentation copies of his own Vita and De locis sanctis. Pertinent to this point is a reference to a "Gospel of the mighty son of Mary" in the "A Maccucain, Sruith in Tiag" poem cited earlier as possibly by Adomnan. This association takes on special meaning in the light of another mention of Adomnan. The Via Sancti Geraldi abbatis de Magh Eo, the Latin life of Saint Gerald (ed. C. Plummer, Vitae hiberniae, Oxford, 1909, II, 101-115) reports that Gerald, abbot of Mayo, appointed Adomnan his successor. The Vita says the latter ruled the monastery for seven years, during which time "he wrote the four Gospels with his own hand" before returning to Iona. Gerald died some time around 732, Adomnan probably in 704, confirming the confused and unhistorical na- ture of the Vita. Nevertheless, as N.K. Chadwick, "Bede, St. Colman and the Irish Abbey of Mayo," in Celt and Saxon: Studies in the Early Irish Border, Cambridge, 1963, 202, suggests, the Vita may preserve an as- sociation of Adomnan with Mayo that may have been a historical fact. Adomnan traveled extensively in Ireland in the late 7th century. On his last visit he may have brought his campaign of conversion to the Roman Order to the county of Mayo. It seems likely that the Vita preserves a misdated reminiscence of this occasion. If so, there may be some truth in its presentation of Adomnan as writing the Gospels. All this permits spec- ulation on Adomnan as scribe or sponsor of copies of the four Gospels in Iona - including the Book of Durrow. 239 On this see J.H. Crehan, "The Liturgical Trade Route: East to West," Studies, Lv, 1976, 87-99.

Conclusion It would seem that my analysis of the impact of the True Cross cult and Christology on Insular productions supports an interpretation of the Durrow double-cross composition as a highly abstract representation of the fragments and tit- ulus of the Crucifixion Cross displayed on the altar of the church of Golgotha for the Good Friday Adoratio crucis. Similarly, the facing Majestas crucis miniature was surely meant to evoke the idea of the Cross of Golgotha sur- rounded by Evangelist symbols, identified with the four rivers in the garden where stood the Tree of Life - Gol- gotha Cross - the Tree guarded by cherubim, themselves equated with the four Apocalyptic Creatures. Thus, to- gether with complementary cosmological, Christological, and associated dogmatic ideas, the fols. lv-2r pre-sentation refers to adjacent loca sancta of the Holy Sepulchre and the Easter rites they helped inspire. I have noted that Arculf's testimony on the holy sites had the most profound impact on the character of the Dur- row scheme and am tempted to credit the Gallic pilgrim with more than inspiration for Adomnan's text. Could it be that he introduced the pictorial model partially followed for the fol. 2r Majestas crucis (a miniature in a Coptic Gos- pels acquired while traveling in Egypt)? If accepted, the date and provenance of the Book of Dur- row that have been suggested here have significant impli- cations for the study of the nature, quality, and relative importance of the contributory sources of Hiberno-Saxon art. But a clarification of Iona's significance as a manuscript center and a resolution of the controversy over the re- spective claims of Celtic and Anglo-Saxon sides in the cul- tural achievements of early medieval Britain require an- other study. I would prefer to emphasize in conclusion the role of the Durrow iconographic program in shaping the imagery of later Insular books. The Durrow and Kells Gos- pels have been shown to have significant elements in com- mon. The similarities between their cross-carpet pages is not the least of these, and the likelihood that the Kells double-barred cross (Fig. 5) pays specific homage to the True Cross increases the probability that the Book of Kells is a product of the Iona scriptorium. That likelihood also promises answers to still outstanding questions of the meaning of and relationship between narrative and sym- bolic miniatures in this, the most richly illustrated of In- sular codices. Martin Werner specializes in the study of Insular and Early Christian iconography. His articles have appeared in the Art Bulletin, Gesta, and Studies in Iconography. He is the author of Insular Art: An Annotated Bibliography (Boston, 1984), and is presently working on the Book of Kells, Irish high crosses, Anglo-Saxon numismatics, and other topics [Department of Art History, Tyler School of Art, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19122].
