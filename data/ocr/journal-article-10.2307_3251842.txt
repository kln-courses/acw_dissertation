<plain_text><page sequence="1">Once Upon a Time ... Narrative Strategies in Verga's "Jeli il pastore" and "Rosso Malpelo" Piero Garofalo Cesare Pavese che molti si ostinano a considerare un testardo narratore realista, specializzato in campagne e periferie americano-piemontesi, ci scopre in questi Dialoghi un nuovo aspetto del suo temperamento. Non c'e scrittore autentico, il quale non abbia i suoi quarti di luna, il suo capriccio, la musa nascosta, che a un tratto lo inducono a farsi eremita. [...] Ha smesso per un momento di credere che il suo totem e tabu, i suoi selvaggi, gli spiriti della vegetazione, l'assassinio rituale, la sfera mitica e il culto dei morti, fossero inutili bizzarrie e ha voluto cercare in essi il segreto di qualcosa che tutti ricordano [...].' Through Dialoghi con Leuco, Pavese responds to the critical reception of his literary texts by both challenging the authorial construct and celebrating the mythical-poetic. These dialogues explicate a discur- sive strategy that was always already present in his so-called realist narratives. Giovanni Verga's most acclaimed literary texts have en- dured a similar reductive reading that also obfuscates the heterogene- ity of his poetics. Mythical language characterizes much of Verga's early narrative production-Una peccatrice, Eva, and Eros are evincive of this tendency. This articulation is a discursive strategy, which is also present in his later works. In order to discern these non-realist articulations it is first necessary Cesare Pavese, presentation, Dialoghi con Leucb, by Cesare Pavese (Torino: Einaudi, 1965) 201. Pavese wrote this presentation for the jacket cover of the first edition (1947).

I do not propose to expose the fictions lying beneath the philosophi- cal premises of verismo;' rather, I seek to explicate the formal limitations of this literary referent. By raising the realist veil en- shrouding Verga's texts, I emphasize other cultural formations cen- tral to his poetics. The sophism of realist art is that the reality the writer purports to present, via the object of the narration, also conveys assent on the morals the authorial persona desires to suggest-it naturalizes a social construct. Realism deputes the demonstration to the so-called facts, thereby relieving the authorial voice of all contingent account- ability. The realist discourse then becomes all the more compelling as the reader's potential to challenge the performative construct is limited before events and characters that are inscribed in a seemingly objective reality. In this sense, the realist discourse naturalizes both itself and its object. In a letter to Luigi Capuana dated 19 February 1881, Verga asserts the primacy of the text over the writer and the subsequent necessity of suppressing the authorial persona: Che cos'e non il tuo nome, n6 il mio, ma quel del Manzoni, o di Zola, in faccia ai Promessi Sposi e all'Assommoir? L'opera d'arte non val pii dell'autore? se e riescita ben inteso. Parmi che si deve arrivare a sopprimere il nome dell'artista dal piedistallo della sua opera, quando questa vive da s6; sai la mia vecchia fissazione di una ideale opera d'arte tanto perfetta da avere in se stessa tutto il suo organismo.3 Forma dat esse rei. This mask of fidelity to fact serves to conceal the parenthetic and demonstrative intent of the author by naturalizing the ideological. While falling short of proclaiming the death of the 2 "II 'verismo' com'e attuato nella particolare impersonalita dei Malavoglia, non e 'realismo', affatto: la referenzialita sociologica e il pretesto, o lo strato di base, per un'operazione linguistica e letteraria che, la si chiami simbolismo o decadentismo, comunque proietta Verga al di la del suo tempo e della sua scuola." Gian-Paolo Biasin, "Come si fa lo stufato" in Studi di Italianistica in onore di Giovanni Cecchetti, eds. Paolo Cherchi and Michelangelo Picone (Longo; Ravenna, 1982) 263. Biasin's conclusion is significant because the stylistic techniques employed in Vita dei campi provide the impetus for the narrative procedures enacted in I Malavoglia. Cf.

As Giorgio Barberi Squarotti argues, the reader is also implicated in this discursive strategy: La maschera della fedelta al fatto vale a coprire l'intento parenetico e dimostrativo, che e poi una forma di collaborazione all'ordine della societA com'e: non che essere una forma di letteratura di tipo "progressivo" owero rivoluzionario, il romanzo realista e verista propone una fruizione di se come lezione sui mali inevitabili che comporta ogni attentato alla norma. Ha in s6, in ultima analisi, l'esigenza di ottenere dal lettore la liberazione dall'impulso a mutare qualcosa nell'ordine sociale, indicandogli tutta la sequenza dei mali che inevitabilmente ne deriva.5 In mimetic representations, the aesthetic and the ideological are complementary referents in the formation of power relations. Verismo displaces the performative role of the author and establishes a textual site that locates its authority within its own performance. Thus, verismo's negotiation, which at first glance appears to empower the reader, in practice delineates the epistemic boundaries of interpre- tation. This discussion does nothing to challenge Verga's literary designa- tion as a Verist writer; rather, it reiterates that reality, as a textual construct, cannot be universalized. For the modern reader, the advent of relativism eliminates the possibility of an objective knowl- edge of realities independent of referents. Relativism does not negate the mimetic aspects of a writer's prose; however, it does challenge the premises that underlie and undermine that particular discursive strategy. I propose that even Verga's Verist poetics negotiate a discursive strategy imbued with the language of myth and folklore. My investiga- tion focuses on 'Jeli il pastore" and "Rosso Malpelo," two stories that occupy a liminal position in the development of Verga's experimental narrative.6 In particular, I examine three distinct textual aspects of 4 See Northrop Frye, Fables of Identity: Studies in Poetic Mythology (New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, 1963) 36. 5 Barberi Squarotti 29. 6 "Rosso Malpelo" was published in serial form in the Roman newspaper II Fanfulla on 2 and 4 August 1878. A preliminary version of "Jeli il pastore" appeared in Lafronda on 29 February 1880. The first edition of Vita dei campi was published in Milan by Treves in late August 1880. For an analysis of the "Rosso Malpelo" variants, see Carla Riccardi, 86</page><page sequence="4">M LN these stories: the dramatis personae, the temporal structure, and the style. While this is not a study in poetic mythologies, some prelimi- nary critical references will clarify my methodology in regards to the relation between myths and folk tales. Fundamental, in this respect, are Carl Gustav Jung's theories on archetypes because they provide a compelling literary model for approaching narrative tropes. Jung distinguishes archetypes as uni- versal forms in the collective unconscious: In addition to our immediate consciousness, which is of a thoroughly personal nature and which we believe to be the only empirical psyche, there exists a second psychic system of a collective, universal nature which is identical in all individuals. This collective unconscious does not develop individually but is inherited. It consists of pre-existent forms, the arche- types, which can only become conscious secondarily and which give definite form to certain psychic contents.7 Jung provides a theoretical framework for conceptualizing archetypes as literary manifestations of a collective unconscious. Vladimir Propp arrived at similar conclusions in his seminal study on the morphology of the folk tale.8 The aim of his investigation was to expose the common pattern governing narrative propositions derived from a corpus of close to two hundred Russian folk tales, in which the constant elements had to be abstracted from the variable, specific events and characters constituting the individual stories. He labeled the constant element a "function," and it represented "an act of a character, defined from the point of view of its significance for the course of the action."9 Propp argued that the functions remained constant even when the identity of the agent changed. In other words, the dramatis personae of folk tales are literary representations of archetypes. Their names may change, but they remain the same.

The latter concludes that, "the study of attributes makes possible a scientific interpretation of the tale. From a historical point of view, this signifies that the fairy tale in its morphological bases represents a myth."'lJung discerns a similar rapport: "Tribal lore is concerned with archetypes [...] they have been changed into conscious formulae taught according to tradition. [...] Another well-known expression of the archetypes is myth and fairytale."" He proceeds to develop this intuition more concretely: "The product of the collective unconscious resembles the type of structures to be met with in myth and fairytale so much so that we must regard them as related.""2 Levi-Strauss further solidifies this complementary relationship between myth and folk tale: [L]'esperienza etnologica attuale ci induce invece a pensare che, al contario, mito e favola sfruttino una sostanza comune, ma ognuno alla sua maniera. La loro relazione non e di anteriore a posteriore, di primitivo a derivato, ma &amp; piuttosto una relazione di complementarita. Le fiabe sono miti in miniatura, in cui le stesse opposizioni sono riportate in scala ridotta, ed e questo in primo luogo che le rende difficili da studiare.'3 Levi-Strauss's literary anthropological analysis implies that the dis- criminatory divide between the two narratives is permeable. These conclusions suggest that while folk tales, fairy tales, myths, and legends designate distinct narrative representations, they share ge- neric discursive strategies. I would argue that verismo assimilates these discursive strategies into its poetics thereby challenging its capacity to negotiate a mimetic representation. As a system, Verism presents elements that connote specific mythical significations."4 However, in the present context, my use of these narrative categories is not culturally specific and respects their taxonomic slippage. 10 Propp 90.

"Jeli il pastore" traces the life of a young herder from his idyllic solitary youth to his entrance into the social order. The homonymous protagonist shares traits characteristic of the Child God/puer archetype.15 Jeli tends to his horses in isolation, removed from the constraints and regulations of society. For Jung, the word "child" suggests something evolving toward independence, destined to free itself from its origins. In fact, abandonment emerges as a necessary condition for the creation of the Child God. The puer possesses a superior consciousness, which marginalizes his social position; solitude expresses the conflict between the Child and his environment.'6 Paradoxically, even though the puer possesses powers superior to those surrounding him, he is in constant peril of erasure, due to the fact that although he is divine, he is also a child. In so far as the content of archetypes is expressed through metaphors, Jeli's textual identification with the Child God emerges as a recurring motif. From Jeli's introduction into the narrative, he is presented as a mythical figure, born and raised amongst the animals: "-Vedete Jeli il pastore? e stato sempre solo pei campi come se l'avessero figliato le sue cavalle [...]" (JP, 138-39). He is also referred to as a divine gift: "&lt;Era piovuto dal cielo, e la terra l'aveva raccolto? come dice il proverbio; era proprio di quelli che non hanno n6 casa ne parenti" (JP, 139).Just as the archetype of the Child God must be abandoned in order to develop, Jeli also endures this ritualistic passage: both his parents expire.17 Jeli's textual representation emphasizes his singularity and his naturalized relation to the environment. His knowledge is presented as almost primordial: "conosceva come spira il vento quando porta il temporale, e di che colore sia il nuvolo quando sta per nevicare. Ogni 15 See C. G. Jung, 151-81. Cf. James Hillman et al., eds., Puer Papers (Irving, TX: Spring Publications, Inc., 1979); and Marie-Louise von Franz, Puer aeternus (Santa Monica: Sigo Press, 1981). 16 "This loneliness expresses the conflict between the bearer or symbol of higher consciousness and his surroundings. The conquerors of darkness go far back into primeval times, and, together with many other legends, prove that there once existed a state of original psychic distress, namely unconsciousness." C. G. Jung 169. 7Jeli's textual representation conflates the archetypes of the puer divinus, the puer aeternus, and the myth of the wild child. Regarding the myth of the wild child, cf. Claude Levi-Strauss, The Elementary Structures of Kinship (Boston: Beacon Press, 1969) 3- 12 and 84-98. 89</page><page sequence="7">PIERO GAROFALO cosa aveva il suo aspetto e il suo significato [...]" (JP, 140). Even in his social relations, Jeli privileges nature over society. He possesses an intimate rapport with the animals and communicates with them with greater facility than with humans. His inability to articulate his thoughts and the ease with which he converses with the horses are symptomatic of this tendency. For example, while driving the herd to the fair,Jeli carries on a conversation with the horses rather than with his assistant: "E senza curarsi che Alfio il ragazzo, non rispondeva nulla [...]. Cosi [Jeli] andava parlando all'uno e all'altro dei puledri" (JP, 152). Even after he enters the social orderJeli remains incapable of acclimating himself to verbal communication, a failure that contributes to the denouement: -Non andare! disse egli a Mara, come don Alfonso la chiamava perche venisse a ballare cogli altri. Non andare, Mara! -Perche? -Non voglio che tu vada. Non andare! -Lo senti che mi chiamano. Egli non profferiva piu alcuna parola intelligibile, mentre stava curvo sulle pecore che tosava. (JP, 171) Jeli's inarticulate exposition is limited to imperatives and degenerates into a maundering that adumbrates the final shearing of the capretto Don Alfonso. The story opens in an idyllic, pastoral setting in which Jeli lives contentedly. He is the indisputable ruler of this bucolic kingdom. The iterative use of bello in the diegetic description of Tebidi's seasons infuses the indeterminate memory with melancholy: Ah! le belle scappate pei campi mietuti, colle criniere al vento! i bei giorni d'aprile, quando il vento accavallava ad onde l'erba verde, e le cavalle nitrivano nei pascoli; i bei meriggi d'estate, in cui la campagna, bianchiccia, taceva, sotto il cielo fosco, e i grilli scoppiettavano fra le zolle, come se le stoppie si incendiassero! il bel cielo d'inverno attraverso i rami nudi del mandorlo, che rabbrividivano al rovajo, e il viottolo che suonava gelato sotto lo zoccolo dei cavalli, e le allodole che trillavano in alto, al caldo, nell'azzurro! le belle sere di estate che salivano adagio adagio come la nebbia [...]. (JP, 137-38, emphasis mine.) This romantic longing for a life in harmony with nature's cycle is not a projection of Jeli's desires, but rather it is that of the narrative voice's: 'Jeli, lui, non pativa di quella malinconia [...]" (JP, 138). His physical surroundings as well as his human environment are trait- connoting metaphors. As long as Jeli remains within the confines of 90</page><page sequence="8">MLN this Arcadia, he wants for nothing and no one: "Insomma, purche ci avesse la sua sacca ad armacollo, non aveva bisogno di nessuno al mondo [...]" (JP, 138). The preludial pastoral sequence is a metaphor for the boy's innocence; onceJeli leaves this symbolic space for that of social reality, he ceases to function as an archetype. In addition, when he enters society, the wondrous skills he possesses lose all symbolic and economic value. In a Bakhtinian inversion of hierarchies, his signifiers now signify with a differance. The traits that marked him as adept in the wilds mark him as inept in society. Similarly, the stability and plenitude of Jeli's subject-position cannot be inscribed into the symbolic order that he has entered. In fact, it is the inability to form a determinate subjectivity that results in Jeli's concluding expulsion from the social order. The narrative hinges on the typically romantic clash between the myths of natural innocence and social corruption that characterize the human condition. This conflict is one of binary oppositions. The mythological form produces within itself an enantiodromia, a conver- sion into its opposite. In the narrative, this process occurs when Jeli attempts to integrate himself into society. He loses his privileged position and is forced to occupy the lowest rung on the social ladder: "non l'avevano voluto nemmeno per guardare i porci [...]" (JP, 158). In the story's deterministic conclusion, the synthesis of the narrative tensions induces Jeli's self-extinguishing eruption. Another dramatis persona, the childhood friend Mara, is the catalyst forJeli's socialization. Even though they had not seen each other for several years, Jeli's first acknowledgment of his solitude occurs when he returns to Tebidi and discovers that Mara's family is moving to Marineo: Massaro Agrippino e sua moglie si erano aviati colla carretta, Mara correva loro dietro tutta allegra, portando il paniere coi piccioni.Jeli volle accompagnarla sino al ponticello, e quando Mara stava per scomparire nella vallata la chiam6:-Mara! oh! Mara! -Che vuoi? disse Mara. Egli non lo sapeva che voleva.-O tu, cosa farai qui tutto solo? gli domand6 allora la ragazza. -Io resto coi puledri. Mara se ne and6 saltellando, e lui rimase li fermo, finche pote udire il rumore della carretta che rimbalzava sui sassi. (JP, 149-50) While Mara moves on with her life, Jeli's thoughts are filled with images of her. The text appropriates a discursive strategy similar to that of the folk tale in which physical separation represents psycho- 91</page><page sequence="9">PIERO GAROFALO logical distance. Mara's absence constitutes a new awareness in Jeli's socialization: "Mara, come se ne fu andata a Marineo in mezzo alla gente nuova, e alle faccende della vendemmia, si scord6 di lui; maJeli ci pensava sempre a lei, perche non aveva altro da fare, nelle lunghe giornate che passava a guardare la coda delle sue bestie" (JP, 150). The narrative voice subsumes Mara's departure to mitigate the textual contradiction between Jeli's earlier existence when "c'era sempre che vedere e che ascoltare in tutte le ore del giorno" (JP, 140) and his current state of ennui. He cannot continue to live as he has and remain satisfied. Desire and lack have entered into his conscious- ness. Mara's representation evinces the traits characteristic of the Anima archetype. According to Jung, the Anima is the female that lives within each male: "She intensifies, exaggerates, falsifies and mytholo- gizes all emotional relations with his work and with other people."'8 The relationship between Jeli and Mara is represented as one of conflicts. Their interests, needs, and desires are completely non- complementary, as is neatly summed up in the observation: "Infatti Mara non era fatta a far la pecoraia [...]" (JP, 166). While Mara is the object of Jeli's desire, she is able to resist his interpellation because they lack mutual recognition. Her infringement as other into his self- contained environment, disrupts/corrupts his natural state. This misogynistic representation accentuates the mythologizing tendency of the narrative by inserting the text into the archetypal literary tradition of foundational narratives-specifically, that of edenic ex- pulsions. This aesthetic performance organizes the temporal structure of the text, which presents a complex relationship between chronological time and psychological time. Myths are located outside of time, in illo tempore, to adopt Mircea Eliade's felicitous phrase, and so is Jeli's world.l9 The text disregards the effective sequence of temporal periods and concentrates almost exclusively on events that have a strong emotional charge. The opening pastoral description situates the narrative in an idyllic framework in which the passage of time lacks precise chronological referents. Concomitant to the presenta- tion of this atemporal dimension is the rapid, elliptical movement of time in the description of Jeli and Mara's friendship. The first 18 C. G. Jung 70. 19 See Eliade's discussion of archetypes and repetition in Mircea Eliade, The Myth of the Eternal Return (New York: Pantheon Books, 1954) 21. 92</page><page sequence="10">M L N sentence of each paragraph, for six consecutive paragraphs, repre- sents an indefinite temporal leap: "Ma da quel giorno in poi [...]. Al tempo dei fichidindia poi [...]. Durante l'inverno [...]. Col marzo tornarono [...]. Cosi passarono tutta l'estate [...]. In quel tempo [...]" (JP, 144; 145; 145; 145; 146; 146). The temporal references are all indeterminate. The flowing of time is not anchored in the calendar, but in the flow of the seasons, an ethnological time of the eternal return juxtaposed to the linear narrative. The repetition of events produced by negotiating interchanges between narrative present, analepsis (the narrative excursion into past textual events), and prolepsis (the narrative excursion into future textual events) temporally organizes the text. Thus, the discrepancy between what the Russian Formalists referred to as the fabula (or story), the temporal-causal sequence of narrated events, and the sjuzet (or plot), the way in which these events are textually manipulated, is constantly brought into play. Mara's presentation in the narrative illustrates this technique. She is introduced in a conversation between Jeli and Don Alfonso, another childhood friend, after which the history of her character is given. The flashback is now the new temporal reference for narrative progression. Time is effectively disjointed; analepsis becomes prolepsis. The same textual mechanism is set in motion with the prolepsis of the fair followed by the expanded narrative development of the event: Egli [eli] rivide soltanto la ragazza [Mara] il di della festa di San Giovanni, come and6 alla fiera coi puledri da vendere: una festa che gli si mut6 tutta in veleno, e gli fece cascare il pan di bocca per un accidente toccato ad uno dei puledri del padrone, Dio ne scampi. I1 giorno della fiera il fattore aspettava [...]. (JP, 150) In all these instances the narrative manipulates not only chronologi- cal sequences but also duree. Prolepsis induces acceleration in the narrative, while analepsis actuates deceleration. The result is a double reading of the text in which the significant events are repeatedly embedded in the fabula thereby replicating the chronological moment. Prolepsis acts not only as an anticipatory element, but also as a mythical one in the text. This is evident in the episode describing Mara's affair with Don Alfonso andJeli's unwillingness to believe such a betrayal possible. The narrator's declaration that "Fu da quel momento che lo chiamarono per soprannome Coma d'oro, e il soprannome gli rimase, a lui e tutti i suoi, anche dopo che ei si lav6 le 93</page><page sequence="11">PIERO GAROFALO corna nel sangue" (JP, 169) is not just foreshadowing, but prophetic in tone. The propensity of prolepsis is to extend time beyond the confines of history into the temporal sphere of legends. In fact, when Jeli kills Don Alfonso, his violence is portrayed not as the result of assimilation of a social construct, but as nature naturee: "-Come!- diceva-Non dovevo ucciderlo nemmeno? ... Se mi aveva preso la Mara! .. ." (JP, 172). Jeli is incapable of articulating his sentiments and can express them only through action.20 Rather than being representative of a Sicilian vendetta, Jeli's reaction to Mara's adultery is narrated as the defacto response of human nature. The concluding suspension points situate both the reader and the narrative voice in a subordinate position with respect to the text and demarcate a textual space for them to reflect upon what has been omitted. The reader is textually coerced into assuming the narrative voice's point of view and is therefore complicit in accepting the text's ideological implica- tions. A stylistic analysis of the text reinforces these observations. The use of free indirect discourse enhances the polyvocality of the text by bringing into play numerous speakers and attitudes. The polyphonic elements increase through both chorality and the integration of intersecting discourses (other texts and proverbs). The strategic use of adages or colloquial expressions evokes an eternal past, an oral tradition through which knowledge is disseminated from generation to generation, comprising the base of present day myths and folk tales. This textual assimilation of popular aphorisms contributes toward the reader's impression that the narrative is an orally transmit- ted text. Verga's attention to and appropriation of these oral traditions during the composition of Vita dei campi and I Malavoglia is amply documented. Several letters to Luigi Capuana attest to his sustained interest in further examining these materials. In a correspondence dated 17 May 1878, Verga requests assistance in identifying suitable texts: "Potresti indicarmi una raccolta di Proverbi e Modi di dire siciliani?"2' Subsequently, on 10 April 1879, he reiterates this desire: Fammi il piacere di mandarmi per suo mezzo [Mazzoni], se tu non verrai presto, tutte quelle raccolte di proverbi e modi di dire siciliani che hai e 20 Lithi identifies this tendency to project character psychology through external action rather than through internal development as typical of folk tales.

Cio che vado cercando con desiderio e la raccolta dei proverbi del Rapisarda, stampata in Catania, e introvabile.23 Verga's familiarity with Giuseppe Pitre's research and his interest in Santo Rapisarda's text during this period is evident in the composi- tion of 'Jeli il pastore." The Verist concern Verga expressed in distancing the authorial voice from the text produces a deliberately ambiguous appropriation of popular expressions that suggest either approval/identification or derision/hostility. The slippage between direct discourse, indirect discourse, and free indirect discourse, to which this folkloric voice is central, obfuscates the distance between the narrative voice's position and that of the characters, thereby producing an ambivalent tension. The narrator situates himself at the extradiegetic level, in accord- ance with the tenets of verismo, distancing himself from the narration and impressing upon the reader his unquestionable reliability. The text constructs an atmosphere of indisputable reality, which mirrors that of folk tales and myths, in which the impersonal narrator reinforces the eternal quality implicit in these cultural forms thereby sustaining a specific field of power. In addition, the text reconstructs the social structure by verbally evoking the imaginary participation of the reader thus concealing the structure in its very form of presenta- tion to produce what Pierre Bourdieu refers to as the effet de croyance [belief effect].24 22 Verga, Lettere a Luigi Capuana, 121. 23 Verga, Lettere a Luigi Capuana, 122. Verga is referring to Santo Rapisarda's Raccolta di proverbi sciliani ridotti in canzoni di l'Abbati Santu Rapisarda, published in Catania in 4 volumes in 1824, 1827, 1828, and 1842 respectively. Subsequently, the text was reissued in a single expanded volume (Catania: Giannotta, 1881). The Pitre edition that Verga references is most likely Giuseppe Pitre, Proverbi siciliani, raccolti e confrontati con quelli degli altri dialetti da Giuseppe Pitre, con discorso preliminare, glossario, 4 vols. (Palermo: Pedone Lauriel, 1880). Cf.

The homonymous protagonist is defined by his name, which ascribes to a popular tradition whereby a certain behavior is a natural result of a person's appearance (and vice versa)-in this case, the association between obstinate meanness and red hair: Malpelo si chiamava cosi perche aveva i capelli rossi; ed aveva i capelli rossi perche era un ragazzo malizioso e cattivo, che prometteva di riescire un fior di birbone. Sicch6 tutti alla cava della rena rossa lo chiamavano Malpelo; e persino sua madre col sentirgli dir sempre a quel modo aveva quasi dimenticato il suo nome di battesimo. (RM, 173) The incipit provides an a priori assertive argumentation that organizes the narrative. As Carlo Muscetta notes, this physiognomic identification is derived from folklore: "I1 titolo e tratto dall'aforisma "russu malu pilu", ove l'ellissi del verbo vuole sancire la verita di una legge di natura (chi &amp; rosso e cattivo)."25 Gregory Lucente argues that this color imagery inscribes a chthonian mark on the body: "In terms of popular belief, his red hair is the color of Judas' and, through Judas, the sign of Cain."26 The opening predication expresses this tautology through the iterative usage of subordinating conjunctions ("perch6 [...] perch6 [...] sicche") that are more expletory than explicatory. This essentialist substantiation by which the body serves as an index to order and to explain the subject is both explicit and supra- temporal. Consequently, the frequent presence of such physiognomic associations in the text produces a rational, authoritative, and static impression. Hence, the metonymic/metaphoric relation between external appearance and character-traits becomes a tautological certainty.27 In addition, the erasure of his proper name from communal 25 Carlo Muscetta (lecture notes taken by C. Scire), in Romano Luperini, Verga (Roma-Bari: Laterza, 1988) 41. Cf. Paolo Mantegazza's physiognomic study in which he observes: "Red hair, although rare, is disliked by nearly all because it is an almost monstrous type" in Physiognomy and Expression (London: Walter Scott, 1892) 62. 26 Gregory Lucente, Beautiful Fables: Self-consciousness in Italian Narrative from Manzoni to Calvino (Baltimore and London: The Johns Hopkins UP, 1986) 83. 27 In narrative fiction external appearance has frequently implied character-connot- ing traits, however, in the nineteenth century, this organizational topos acquired a pseudo-scientific status through the Swiss philosopher and theologian Johann Caspar Lavater (1741-1801). His theory of physiognomy (Physiognomische Fragmente, zur 96</page><page sequence="14">M L N memory-not once is it mentioned-symbolically marginalizes Malpelo to an extra-baptismal state. This deterministic effacement of identity adumbrates the narrative's concluding imagery of Malpelo's "unbap- tized" spirit wandering through the limbo of subterranean passage- ways for eternity. Color imagery does not just mark Rosso Malpelo as excluded from the integrated community; it also establishes his identity-forming relation with the red-sand pit.28 Not only is his hair red, but he is always covered in red dust: "Era sempre cencioso e lordo di rena rossa, ch6 la sorella s'era fatta sposa, e aveva altro pel capo: nondimeno era conosciuto come la bettonica per tutto Monserrato e la Carvana, tanto che la cava dove lavorava la chiamavano 'la cava di Malpelo', e cotesto al padrone gli seccava assai" (RM, 173-74). His metonymic relationship to the quarry is not one of ownership, but instead is one of identity.29 Regardless of the owner's annoyance, Malpelo's pres- ence is not disruptive to the capitalist order. Despite these superficial differences, Rosso Malpelo, like Jeli, shares a similar textual representation to that of the puer divinus archetype. He appears as a mythical figure, metaphorically born of beasts. His father is more animal than man, "lo chiamavano mastro Misciu Bestia, ed era l'asino da basto di tutta la cava" (RM, 174), and Malpelo too lacks basic anthropomorphic qualities: "non aveva piu nulla di umano [...]" (RM, 176). Like Jeli, Malpelo has also been abandoned, as all Child gods must be.30 His contact with other humans is limited; he prefers the company of animals: "Il cane gli voleva bene, perch6 i cani non guardano altro che la mano la quale da loro il pane" (RM, 177). Significantly, the only human relationship that he is able to develop is with Ranocchio, a name that suggests something less than human-connoting traits. Of course, the bonding Beforderung der Menschenkenntnifi und Menschenliebe, 4 vols. Leipzig and Winterthur: Weidmann, Reich, and Steiner, 1775-78) heavily influenced European writers. The first Italian translation of Lavater's opus appeared in 1803-subsequent redactions followed in 1819, 1827, and 1863. On Lavater's influence on nineteenth-century literature see Graeme Tyler, Physiognomy in the European Novel: Faces and Fortunes (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1982). 28 The privileging of pure colors, in this instance red, is characteristic of folk tales. See Luthi, The European Folktale, 27-8. 29 Verga's usage of the referent "cava" conflates the meanings of quarry, pit, cave, and mine. 30 Malpelo's mother remarries and moves away as does his sister. All that remains of mastro Misciu after his death are his tools of the trade, which for Malpelo are nothing less than folkloric Zaubergaben. 97</page><page sequence="15">PIERO GAROFALO between a social-outcast protagonist and an animal is typical of folk tales. Rosso Malpelo's appearance distinguishes him as unique, different, and to be feared; it reveals to the world his chthonic origins, which are both diabolical and divine.3' He is described as being of the worst sort, as if possessed by the devil: "sembrava ci avesse messo la coda il diavolo" (RM, 179), "Malpelo avea il diavolo dalla sua" (RM, 176), and "sembrava che stesse ad ascoltare qualche cosa che il suo diavolo gli sussurava negli orecchi" (RM, 176). The textual comparison between the legendary tale of the lost miner's wandering ghost and the fantastic story of Malpelo's own disappearance into the darkness underscores his autochthonous nature: "Prese gli arnesi di suo padre, il piccone, la zappa, la lanterna, il sacco col pane, e il fiasco del vino, e se ne and6: ne pii si seppe nulla di lui" (RM, 189). The narrative concludes by enacting a new narrative, relegated to oral tradition, in which Rosso Malpelo becomes a legend to be spoken of in hushed voices by the children of the quarry: "Cosi si persero persin le ossa di Malpelo, e i ragazzi della cava abbassano la voce quando parlano di lui nel sotterraneo, ch6 hanno paura di vederselo comparire dinanzi, coi capelli rossi e gli occhiacci grigi" (RM, 189). The syntactic shift to the present tense is also a temporal shift to an indeterminate hic et nunc. Rather than achieving linear closure, the intratextual conclu- sion returns the cyclical narrative to the introduction: "Malpelo si chiamava cosi perche aveva i capelli rossi; ed aveva i capelli rossi perche era un ragazzo malizioso e cattivo [...]" (RM, 173). A myth of eternal return is textually reenacted through the hybridization of literary strategies. The central image of the quarry is reminiscent of another arche- type, that of the Mother. Jung associates these qualities with this ambiguous figure: [M]aternal solicitude and sympathy [...]. The place of magic transforma- tion and rebirth, together with the underworld and its inhabitants are presided over by the mother [...] the mother archetype may connote anything secret, hidden, dark, the abyss, the world of the dead, anything that devours, seduces and poisons, that is terrifying and inescapable like fate.32 31 Barberi Squarotti argues for a Christological reading of Malpelo's abuse: "Figura del Christus patiens, Rosso Malpelo, che prende le botte anche quando non e colpevole e rifiuta di discolparsi perche sa che sarebbe inutile, in quanto egli e per nascita e natura colui che prende su di se le colpe di tutti [...]" (97). 32 C. G. Jung 82. 98</page><page sequence="16">M L N These conflicting manifestations of the archetype find their textual correspondence in the representation of the mine shaft. While Ranocchio fears the cave, Malpelo embraces it. In his depiction, the red-sand pit assumes the traits characteristic of an entrance to the chthonic realm. It is the legendary locus in which spirits dwell: Ei [Malpelo] narrava [...] come degli uomini ce n'erano rimasti tanti, o schiacciati, o smarriti nel buio, e che camminano da anni e camminano ancora, senza poter scorgere lo spiraglio del pozzo pel quale sono entrati, e senza poter udire le strida disperate dei figli, i quali li cercano inutilmente. (RM, 181-82) Malpelo is intimately associated with the labyrinthine mine. As a child his father led him by hand through this maternal maze; it is his home and his family. However, the pit is also a cruel mistress who nurtures and destroys-both womb and tomb. In this sense, as the Mother archetype, the quarry is a symbolic representation of the vagina dentata. In Book VII of Plato's Republic, Socrates evokes the image of a cave in which people sit facing a wall. The cave is a negative symbol; it is a parable of ignorance. Plato's allegory examines the projection of fictions in the educational process. Socrates argues that it is necessary first to distance oneself from the images in order to perceive their phenomenological condition and then to reexamine them with this new knowledge. Rosso Malpelo performs this operation and opts for the life of the quarry. He is in constant tension between the chthonic lure, which both terrifies and fascinates him, and the world of the living, in which he finds no space for himself: Almeno sottoterra, nella cava della rena, brutto e cencioso e sbracato com'era, non lo beffavano piui, e sembrava fatto apposta per quel mestiere persin nel colore dei capelli, e in quegli occhiacci di gatto che ammiccavano se vedevano il sole. Cosi ci sono degli asini che lavorano nelle cave per anni ed anni senza uscirne mai piui, ed in quei sotterranei, dove il pozzo di ingresso e verticale, ci si calan colle funi, e ci restano finche vivono. Sono asini vecchi, e vero, comprati dodici o tredici lire, quando stanno per portarli alla Plaja, a strangolarli; ma pel lavoro che hanno da fare laggiui sono ancora buoni; e Malpelo, certo, non valeva di piu, e se veniva fuori dalla cava il sabato sera, era perch6 aveva anche le mani per aiutarsi colla fune, e doveva andare a portare a sua madre la paga della settimana. (RM, 180-81) The red-sand pit is a wasteland, a pack animal's graveyard in which Malpelo feels most at home. The textual identification between the 99</page><page sequence="17">PIERO GAROFALO protagonist and the quarry suggests that the physical landscape is also a psychological one-a standard romantic motif. A specific monetary value is affixed to the boy and reiterates his bestial representation. The donkeys used in the mine are working on borrowed time, and so, it would appear, is Rosso Malpelo.33 He has no need to leave the pit but does so only because he can and because he needs to provide for his mother. While Malpelo does engage in a poetic rumination on life outside the mine, he is resigned to his fate: "Ma quello era stato il mestiere di suo padre, e in quel mestiere era nato lui" (RM, 181). The relation- ship established amongst the protagonist, his biological mother, and his archetypal mother is both affective and economic: the cave is his comfort and his mother's means of subsistence. Instead of a loving family's embrace, Malpelo's emotive protensions are for the mine itself, which envelops him completely: Ei [Malpelo] narrava che era stato sempre la, da bambino, e aveva sempre visto quel buco nero, che si sprofondava sotterra, dove il padre soleva condurlo per mano. Allora stendeva le braccia a destra e a sinistra, e descriveva come l'intricato laberinto delle gallerie si stendesse sotto i loro piedi dappertutto, di qua e di la [...]. (RM, 181) He recognizes himself in this infernal labyrinth and takes comfort in its unsettling immensity. In fact, even when Malpelo imagines other types of existences, his fantasies are framed by similar desires for solitude and limitless space: Certamente egli avrebbe preferito di fare il manovale, come Ranocchio, e lavorare cantando sui ponti, in alto, in mezzo all'azzurro del cielo, col sole sulla schiena-o il carrettiere, come compare Gaspare che veniva a prendersi la rena della cava, dondolandosi sonnacchioso sulle stanghe, colla pipa in bocca, e andava tutto il giorno per le belle strade di campagna-o meglio ancora avrebbe voluto fare il contadino che passa la vita fra i campi, in mezzo al verde, sotto i folti carrubbi, e il mare turchino la in fondo, e il canto degli uccelli sulla testa. (RM, 181) Malpelo's concerns are not limited to his physical environment, which is a manifestation of his desire for the other, but extend to forms of social interaction and the power relations therein. He does not fantasize social integration, but instead he seeks even greater 33 The color-coding of Rosso Malpelo's "occhiacci grigi" (RM, 189) in the story's conclusion neatly reinforces the textual identification between the boy and the gray donkey known as "il grigio." 100</page><page sequence="18">M L N social isolation. His ultimate dream to be a farmer reflects his desire to achieve complete social and economic autarchy. In his conversations with Ranocchio, Malpelo's behavior is similar to Plato's philosopher: his pedagogical approach attempts to recon- cile the two worlds that he inhabits. In the end, however, he opts for the mine and what it represents to him. As Barberi Squarotti observes, the puer rejects Christianity's eschatological vision in favor of a quasi-Aenean descent into the abyss: "L'ultima discesa nella cava di Malpelo e, appunto, una cosciente discesa agli inferi a ritrovare il padre e il suo mondo di minatori sepolti, la dove sono i 'buoni' come mastro Misciu, e non in cielo, come dice a Ranocchio che gli espone le idee religiose avute dalla madre [...]."34 Malpelo overturns society's theological hierarchy in a sort of Bakhtinian carnival in which a subversive strategy of reversal and inversion challenges the organiza- tion of the hegemonic culture. However, Malpelo's resistance to the social order is rooted in neither emancipatory politics nor Christian caritas. He expounds to Ranocchio a philosophy of power relations predicated on the premise of impunity: "L'asino va picchiato, perch6 non pu6 picchiar lui; e s'ei potesse picchiare, ci pesterebbe sotto i piedi e ci strapperebbe la carne a morsi" (RM, 178). According to his logic, society regulates itself by means of a literal argumentum ad baculum that falls nothing short of anthropophagy. Of course, Malpelo's iterative textual identification with the asses of the quarry, especially il grigio, delimitates his spatial as well as his economic status in the social order. In "Jeli il pastore" many temporal transitions are lacking; neverthe- less, the reader can still perceive an underlying diachronic sequence. In "Rosso Malpelo," the syntactic treatment of time is carried even further: the narrative privileges simultaneity over progression and continuity. The text is organized around the homodiegetic analepsis of mastro Misciu's death, which impels the narrative by establishing a father-son motif that privileges psychological development at the expense of chronological progression. Barberi Squarotti argues that this discursive strategy does not abide by the poetics of verismo: I1 fatto e che questa (ma anche altre novelle verghiana) non e tanto la fedele stesura di una vicenda, condotta secondo i criteri veristi, quanto piuttosto un esempio, una dimostrazione, nella quale le coerenze temporali e 1'assoluta verosimiglianza non contano certamente piuC del messaggio 34 Barberi Squarotti 108. 101</page><page sequence="19">PIERO GAROFALO che viene affidato al personaggio che e protagonista, all'ambiente, al 'coro' che racconta la vicenda.35 The choral voice, which is both singular and plural, underscores the tensions in a displacement strategy that defers mimetic representa- tions. The frailty of the fabula is due to the scarcity of concrete, sequential actions, which is reflected linguistically in the privileged usage of the imperfect, the tense of the indefinite, at the expense of the present perfect. The paucity of autonomous narrative sequences confers an indeterminate temporal organization on the narrative. This discursive strategy challenges verismo's poetics by expunging history from the story in favor of an ahistorical tension that defies mimetic representation. It is not possible to determine the actual duree of the narrative. The transitions between episodes are distinguished by generic chronologi- cal incipit: "Tutt'a un tratto [...]. Ma una volta [...]. Due o tre giorni dopo [...]. In quel tempo [...]. Da li a poco [...]. Verso quell'epoca [...]. Una volta [...]" (RM, 175; 182; 182; 183; 186; 188; 188).36 These indeterminate in illo tempore markers situate the fabula beyond the limits of mimetic poetics and inside the ahistorical realm of the fairy tale. This temporal distancing produces hermeneutic gaps that make the narrative's concluding syntactic shift to the present tense all the more unsettling and fantastic. The same narrative strategy observed in 'Jeli il pastore" is imple- mented to similar effect in "Rosso Malpelo": an accelerated prolepsis followed by a decelerated analepsis. This technique is particularly evident in the scene relating the father's death: "Insomma lo tenevano [Malpelo] addirittura per carita e perch6 mastro Misciu, suo padre, era morto nella cava. Era morto cosi [...]" (RM, 174). Mastro Misciu's demise, in turn, serves as the catalyst for the prolepsis alluding to Malpelo's own fate: "-Va' la, che tu non ci morrai nel tuo letto, come tuo padre. Invece nemmen suo padre ci mori nel suo letto, tuttoche fosse una buona bestia" (RM, 174). The refrain is repeated toward the end of the story by the escaped convict in conversation with Rosso Malpelo: "tu ci andrai [in prigione] e ci lascerai le ossa. Invece le ossa le lasci6 nella cava, Malpelo, come suo padre, ma in modo diverso" (RM, 188). This iterative prolepsis prefigures the cyclical nature of the inter- and intra-generational relationships. While underscoring 35 Barberi Squarotti 102. 36 Luperini identifies these temporal expressions as marking the narrative sequences of the fabula. Verga e le strutture narrative del realismo, 55. 102</page><page sequence="20">MLN the presence of an extradiegetic authorial voice, the repetition also accentuates the artifice of the narrative positing it outside of history.37 Significantly, the verbal tenses shift to the present only at the end of the narrative. The present tense distances the representation of Malpelo into a legendary past, while simultaneously emphasizing his supra-temporal survival in the memories of the living. All that remains of Malpelo are the legend and the myth: Prese gli arnesi di suo padre, il piccone, la zappa, la lanterna, il sacco col pane, e il fiasco del vino, e se ne and6: ne piu si seppe nulla di lui. Cosi si persero persin le ossa di Malpelo, e i ragazzi della cava abbassano la voce quando parlano di lui nel sotterraneo, che hanno paura di vederselo comparire dinanzi, coi capelli rossi e gli occhiacci grigi. (RM, 189) With the tools of the father and the last supper, he departs on his solitary sacrificial journey and is enveloped by the earth. There is a certain romantic Titanism in Malpelo's implicit acceptance of his exclusionary status as societal scapegoat. His decision not to revolt maintains the social order, but he does not endorse it: "Quando lo mandarono per quella esplorazione si risovvenne del minatore, il quale si era smarrito, da anni ed anni, e cammina e cammina ancora al buio gridando aiuto, senza che nessuno possa udirlo; ma non disse nulla. Del resto a che sarebbe giovato?" (RM, 189). The concluding rhetorical question is not entirely extradiegetic; it also constitutes Malpelo's definitive anagnorisis immediately preceding the peripeteia of his dissolution. The repetition of the lost miner's tale and its internal verbal iterations are stylistic traces that articulate both an oral and a cyclical narrative. The story has come full circle in Malpelo's acquiescence to fulfill his nominal moira. Giacomo Debenedetti laments the presence of the concluding line of the story, which he deems unnecessary.38 Indeed, the semantic relationship between signifiers and signifieds is overdetermined because it is the nexus of negotiation between conflicting discursive strategies. Malpelo's story is not a simple tranche de vie. In the end, the 37 Luperini argues that the use of repetition rieinforces the mythologizing traits in the story: "Ma in Rosso Malpelo la tecnica della ripresa ha anche un significato originale: facendo ricorso, nei momenti cruciali del racconto (all'inizio e alla fine), a un artificio tipico della poesia epica popolare, lo scrittore accentua la tendenza alla mitizzazione: lo stile della leggenda accresce la valenza metastorica della vicenda di Rosso allontanandola ancora di pill dalla bruciante esperienza storica e sociale da cui pure nasce." Verga e le struttule narrative del realismo, 58. 38 Debenedetti 414. 103</page><page sequence="21">PIERO GAROFALO narrative abandons the historical past for the present, which is the tense of the eternal now that sustains Malpelo's representation. However, this temporal shift also transforms the boy from narrative subject to pure text-from Rosso Malpelo to "Rosso Malpelo." The concluding image of an errant specter reinforces this reading by echoing the story's introductory description of Malpelo. This intratextual iteration suggests a cyclical narrative that is not bound by temporal conventions. The polyphonic semantic density discerned in "Jeli il pastore" is even more pronounced in "Rosso Malpelo." We have already ob- served that the mine shaft assumes symbolic significance as the entrance to the chthonic domain and have argued that this represen- tation establishes textual intersections with diverse cultural traditions including Plato's Republic. Another scene that enhances the polysemous resonance of the text is the callous extradiegetic reference to Hamlet at the death of mastro Misciu. The operations manager of the quarry was called from the theater to view the disaster, but returned to his box seat when he realized there was nothing to be done: "L'ingegnere se ne torn6 a veder seppellire Ofelia [...]" (RM, 176). The narrative voice's ironic allusion aside, mastro Misciu's living interment and Ophelia's theatrical one establish a parallelism between the two texts in terms of death and spiritual unrest. The ghost of Hamlet pere wanders the battlements of Elsinore in search of his son, and the ghost of Malpelo roams the galleries of the quarry in search of his father. Although Malpelo is unable to slay his Claudius, he too must come to terms with his past and confront existential dilemmas. La rena that killed mastro Misciu is also l'arena in which Malpelo faces himself. By agreeing to explore the untested passageway-a danger- ous assignment that all the other workers refuse out of fear and common sense-Malpelo tacitly chooses not to be. Provisional Conclusions In this textual analysis of the short stories 'Jeli il pastore" and "Rosso Malpelo," verismo emerges as an involucrum that glosses the herme- neutic gaps in Verga's narratives. Underlying this superficial aesthetic are complex discursive strategies that articulate myth and folklore or, as Pavese described them, "inutili bizzarrie" within Verga's poetics. Verismo integrates the morphology of the text with the ethno- graphic observations of the narrative voice. Myths and folklore are hyperstructural; they form a metalanguage in which structure operates 104</page><page sequence="22">M LN at all textual levels. Mimetic strategies obfuscate these properties thereby instilling a tension typical of historical or romantic narratives. In folk tales and myths, vocabulary is presented as nature naturee.39 It is a semiotic code with its own laws that in turn organize the represen- tation of both the real and the mythical. Verismo plays on this linguistic code by purporting to describe reality via a mythical structure. As such, verismo negotiates a new narrative representation that is at once a new folk legend in the present. As Giacomo Debenedetti observed: "Verga non e epico, come taluno puo dire, e leggendario [...]."40 The narrative's dependence on archetypal representations emerges in the examination of the relationship between the dramatis personae and the archetypes of the collective unconscious: characters based not on their singularity, but on their universality as social types. The temporal structure is based not on a linear chronology, but on an interior, subjective chronometer without fixed physical orientations. This textual strategy recreates the atemporal and indeterminate tension of the folk tales: the past, the present, and the future. In addition, the literary style is based not on mimetic foundations, but on oral traditions. The linguistic register reinforces the reliability of the narrator, who, as an invisible, unidentifiable chorus, underscores the atemporal aspects of the text. Having posited the premise that Verga's poetics diverge from mimetic representation, one might still attribute the formal elabora- tion of his texts to realism. However, as I have argued, these texts vacillate between contextualized historical specificity and metahis- torical ambiguity. Instead of producing meaning within a social reality, the texts suggest atemporal, mythical readings decontextualized from social reality. Textually the social context is variable while the fixed figures are permanent and, as such, subject to creative manipu- lation. The narrative structures express an evasion, which in its circularity obfuscates the need to challenge realism. Ultimately, the texts naturalize a fiction in a metahistorical context in order to justify a specific social-historical condition. Thus, the context emerges as a pretext for the narrative experimentation of the scriptor as auctor-a strategy that achieves its most felicitous expression in I Malavoglia.
