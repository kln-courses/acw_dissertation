<plain_text><page sequence="1">Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona Vol. XI ] April 1930 [ Part III - ^ ^ ^ I A PEEP INTO ANCIENT INDIAN SOCIOLOGY BY Dr. R. SHAMSASTRI, B. A., Ph. D. India has no history of its own. What is now taught as its history in schools and colleges is a recent compilation bas- ed upon modern archaeological research. It gives a bare outline of the vicissitudes of a number of successive ruling dynasties that ruled over different parts of India. As it is bas- ed upon epigraphical records and biographical and literary works, the information it supplies does not go far beyond an account of the personal achievements of a few famous kings Little or nothing is known of the evolution of India's social, religious, economical and political institutions. The field of India's sociological activity, however, is no less extensive than that of any other nation on the globe. Compared with the extensiveness of the field, our knowledge of the harvest it has yielded is very scanty. There is, however, no dearth of, materials for the formation of such a history. What thwarts our attempts in this direction is the difficulty in putting the scattered materials so as to take that shape which they once had. It is quite possible that old and worn out materials may be so adjusted and fitted together as to form a new shape al- together. Fragments of old texts found here and there may be brought together and made to convey ideas never dreamt of by their framers. On the strength of a passage or verse an historian may come to the conclusion that a representative or republican from of government was a thing unknown in India and that despotism, sometimes benevolent, sometimes tyrannical has ever been its course. On the other hand, on the basis of the Atharvavedic passage ( 2-27 ) containing a prayer for power to refute an adversary's speech in an assembly, a contradictory</page><page sequence="2">202 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute conclusion may also be arrived at that A noient India had a Parliamentary form of government. Again in consideration of A V. 6-73-1, 2, 3, calling for -the unanimity of kinsmen in supporting a Rãja as their mighty guardian, it may also be thought that the people were real governors, and that the Bãjã was no more than a commander of the army. Such are the difficulties experienced in the collection of soattered materials and their correct interpretation. The best way to avoid such unfounded conclusions and hasty generalisations is to test their accuracy from various stand- points. Before accepting a solitary statement found in the liter- ary remains of a people and passing it on as an historical fact, it is possible to examine its reliability in the light furnished by philology, ethnology, anthropomorphology, contemporary history, Indo-European antiquities, and lastly additional literary records of the people themselves. With suoh means of 'verification of the results, of study and investigation, I propose to make a survey of ancient Indian Sociology and ascertain the views of the ancients on ethics, economics and politics. It may be taken as a truism that a people's social and religious institutions correspond to its politioal institutions. No people that have either voluntarily or by force yielded themselves to be slaves to time-honoured social and religious customs can be believed to be capable of exercising their right to political freedom to any appreciable degree. Nor oan political despotism find a place among people habituated to freedom of thought and action in social and relgious matters. For it is an historical fact that before the advent of the Mohamedans and the British into India, the above three aspects of social activity were inseparably connected with and acting and reacting upon each other. In the early stages of social life in India as elsewhere supervision over the three kinds of aofcivity, social, religious and political, was entrusted to a single tribunal, be it an assembly or a king. In the patriarchial stage it was the father that is believed to have exercised his authority over and guided the activities of the members of his family. In the tribal stage it was the tribal chief whose voice was supreme on questions concerning these matters. In the sweet home love seems to have softened the iron-rule of the father, while in the tribal state decision over controversial questions çeetqs to have been arrived at on</page><page sequence="3">À Peep into Ancient Indian Sociology 203 the consensus of the tribe. A nation or a state is more or less an enlargement of the tribe by conquest and addition to itself of other tribes in adjacent tracts of land. A nation claiming and practising freedom of thought and action in social and religious matters cannot be believed to have been submissive to political tyranny. So long as India was under its own rulers, it rested with the ruler of each of its several states to give a rule or decision, in cosultation with his assembly, on questions connected with any of the three kinds of activity. But no sooner had India passed under Mohamedan rule, it had to bow down before two tribunals, one exercising its authority on social and religious questions and the other on political questions.. It is admitted that during the Vedic period rules to regulate social customs and religious worship were still in a state of formation. There was no caste. The words, c Brahma, Ksatra Vis, and Südra met in the Vedas are names of classes rather than of castes. Those who qualified themselves for priest-craft were called Brähmans. Those who were fit or trained for military profession were termed Ksatriyas* The trading and agricultural people were known as Viá or Vaišyas. The servile class recruited from the conquered people received the designa- tion, Südra. Function rather than birth determined the class to which an individual belonged. This is proved by what Lätyäyana, the author of a Srautasütra belonging to the Sãma Veda, says ( X-II.-45-5-6 ) in connection with the Daáapeya, a sacrifice in which ten priests have to drink a cup of Soma juice after enumerating the names of their ten ancestral fathers and mothers. The Brähmana lays down, says Lätyäyana, that the priests should proceed ,to drink their respective Soma cups after enumerating the names of ten ancestral fathers and mothers ; if however they come across the names of one or two non-Brãkman women, they should begin with the next Brahman woman and complete the number ten by repetition. Those who do not remember the names may begin with the name they remember. From this it is clear that during the Vedic period the Brähmans used to marry wives from non-Brähman olasses, and sons begotten on such wives were free to follow the profession of their fathers, whatever might be the class to which their mother, belonged by birth. In his Dharma-Sütra ( IV-22-23-24 ) Gautama says : 4 4In the seventh generation men obtain a change of caste ( rather class )</page><page sequence="4">204 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute either by being raised to a higher one or being degraded to a lower one. The venerable teacher says that this happens in the fifth generation/*' Commenting on the above Sutras Haradatta . says as follows 44 If a S avarria female, born of a Ksatriya wife of a Brahman, is married to a Brahman, and her female descendants down to the seventh likewise, then the offspring which that seventh female descendant bears to her Brahman husband is equal in caste to that of a Brahman. In like manner if a Savarya male, the son of a Brahman, and of a Ksatriya wife, marries a Ksatriya wife and his male descendants down to the seventh generation likewise, then the offspring of that seventh male descendant is equal in caste to that of a Ksatriya." According to Gautama's teachers this kind of elevation to, or degradation from, a class is permitted even in the fifth generation. According to Lätyäna's statement quoted above, however, change of class was permitted even in the second, if not in the first, generation. That choice of a profession depended not upon birth but upon individual taste and capacity is also corroborated by the Visnu-Puräna.- " The sons of Dhrsta, " says the Visnu-Puräna, "though Ksatriyas by birth, became Brãhmans; the Rathitaras are termed Brähmans following the profession of Ksatriyas ; the sons of Agnivesya, a king of the Sola* line, became Agnivesyãyana Brãhmans ; likewise the sons of Härita, the son of Yau vanãs va, are term- ed Brahmane with the profession of Ksatriyas . Similarly the Gärgyas, the sons of Garga, though Ksatriyas by birth, became Brãhmans ; Kapi, the son of Uruksaya, became Brähman ; from Mudgala, the son of Hary aá va, descended the Maudgalya Brãhmans. The story narrated, in the Mahäbhärata ( Ädiparvan, chap. 128 ) of Svetaketu's protest against the custom of an honoured guest being allowed to lie down with the host's wife for a night oř two, goes to show tKe looseness of marriage-tie. The story of the birth of Satyakämajäbäla before his mother Jabãlã was duly married, and of his initia- tion as a Brähman student by Gautama Häridrumata ( Chãndogya IV .-00 ) is another striking instance of the absence of hard and fast rules regulating social conduct. Also such of the customs as are prohibited for the Kali age go to show that man was at liberty to do whatever his taste and pleasure dictated and the ethical notions of his time permitted. They also go to show that there was no restriction whatever to</page><page sequence="5">A Peep into Ancient Indian Sociology 205 connubium and commensalism and that it was left to the option of women either to marry or live a spiritual life as Brahma vãdinls. The customs prohibited for the Kali age are : - Admission of sea-farers back into the society ; embracing asceticism and holding a water-vessel made of dry bitter gourd ; marriage with girls other than of their own class by men of the three upper classes ; the custom of deputing a brother to beget a son on the wife of his dead brother; the slaughter of a cow on the occasion of entertaining a guest ; use of flesh in ancestral ceremonies; embracing the Vãnaprastha order or living like a hermit in forests ; the remarriage of virgin widows ; th'e observance of bachelorhood for a long time ; performance of human and horse sacrifices; the custom of making a long and difficult journey with a view to end one's life, and the slaughter of a cow in sacrifice ; sojournment of Brãhmans; smoking; admission to society of women outraged by force ; begging his food from people of all the four classes by an ascetic ; and employment of Sudras as cook in the houses of Brãhmana. 1 No less striking is the degree of freedom of thought and action enjoyed by ancient Indians in religious matters during the Vedic and Paurãnic periods. It was during what may be called the Hindu period, extending from the Vedic period down to the tenth century A. D., that India witnessed the rise and growth of different schools of thought on subjects such as grammar, logic, medicine, metaphysics, ethics, theology, and the like. There are three stages clearly discernible in the Hindu religious thought. The first is the stage of Polytheism along with Fetishism and Animism coeval with the Vedic period extending, according to the opinion of Western scholars, from B. C. 1500 to B. C. 1000 The second is that of Pantheism of the Upanisads extending from B. C. 1000 to about B. O. 300. The third is the stage of Monotheism coeval with the Ägamic and Paurãnic periods, extending from B. C. 300 to A. D. 900. when systématisation of Indian religion and philosophy was begun in right earnest by reformers and commentators like Samkaräcärya and other philosophers. The Vedic Polytheism consists in the worship of a number of gods, all being of an equal status. They are either personi- 1 Nirçayasindhu IV.</page><page sequence="6">206 Aimais of the Bhandariear Oriental Research Institute fications of natural phenomena, or deifications of animale and natural objects. Besides these, the spirits of the dead are also worshipped as gods. The worship is called Yaga or Yajña, which oonsists in making an animal or vegetable offering into the sacred fire for transmission to the gods invoked. These gods are so anthropomorphic in conception that tbey are easily mistaken for departed heroes of the Vedic people. In fact some of the Western scholars went so far as to identify them with departed heroes of the same names, and rejected the theory of the personification of natural phenomena. The individual and social life of the gods may accordingly be said to be a duplicate copy of the life of the Aryans of the period. It is usual with the Vedic poets to raise to the rank of a supreme deity any of the gods they specially woi shipped for the attain- ment of a particular object. This tendency of the poets is called Henotheism or Kathenotheism by Max Müller. Power- ful as are tbe gods they are never worshipped in any slavish spirit. Offerings are made to them in exchange for the boons and blessings they are believed to confer upon the worshippers. Like the worshipping Aryans the gods are also divided into three classes, Brahma, Ksatra, and Vis. They are as warlike as the Aryans. The classification of the gods according to their imagined rank is a characteristic of later Saivism and Vaisnavism and is unknown to the Vedas. At the close of the Vedic period the poets rise to the conception of one god in whom all other gods are merged, or who is called by various names. " The one Being they call variously." This concep- tion of unity has not however resulted in the conception of a single personal god like Siva or Visnu. It took the form of the Pantheism of the Upanisads. It is conceived as an uni- versal spirit identioal with the soul or self in man, as explained by some philosophers. With the Upanisads there have arisen in Ancient India a number of philosophic schools. Not satisfied with the cult of animal sacrifice elaborated in the Vedas and the Brãhmanas, there arise several schools of theologians and metaphysicians. With a view to conceal their apostaoy from the Vedic sacrfioial cult, they interpret the Vedas in metaphysical light. They teach that knowledge of the self is the saored fire ; the mind and the senses are the victims to be immolated ; the end to be attain, ed is Moksa or emancipation from the bondage of the world. Conquest of passions by controlling senses is the main theme</page><page sequence="7">A Peep into Ancient Indian Sociology t07 common to all the schools. The Sãmkhyas, the Yogins the Kanadas, the Vaisesikas, the Buddhists, the Jainas, and the Vedãntins come before our view vying with each other in ex- pounding their own views on the nature of matter, spirit and emancipation. They are all atheistic inasmuch aa they admit no personal god or an intelligent Being endowed with supreme power. It is on the other hand Brahman the Universal Saccidãnanda, i. e. sat, eternal, cit, consciousness, and ãnanda, perfect bliss. It is Pãrna, complete and is wanting in nothing for completion. This universal consciousness or caitanya is identical with individual self, Jivãtman. Opposed to caitanya there is matter rûpa of various forms and names. What is call- ed matter is mere appearance of the universal oaitanya whioh underlies it. Just as man regards the colourless sky as blue and the moon as being one foot ( prãdesa ) in diameter, and just as he mistakes a rope for a snake and mirage for water, so he mistakes oaitanya for matter such as stone, tree, pot, mat, and the like. The whole of the universe is nothing but a conscious- 'stuff and appears variously. Appearance is the nature of caitanya. It is unknowable in its real form, for it has no form. Mãyã is the name give d to appearance. Not knowing or realising the distinction between caitanya and its appear- anoe, man mistakes appearance for reality and is thereby involved in what is called endless samsara and its miseries. In order to get rid of this misery of life, he has to realise the real nature of his self and its identity with the universal self. One who realises this can very easily get rid of the idea of " the other. " Since all individual selves are identical with the universal self, there can be no other self. The distinction of " mine and thine " vanishes to him. Since self is wanting in nothing, and is punja or oomplete in itself, a wise man has nothing, to achieve. All that he is obliged to do is preserva- tion of the body with a view to attain the right knowledge of caitanya. The action whioh he is thus required to undertake is to be rather of an involuntary than of voluntary nature. This necessitates on his part the conquest of the senses, the will and the mind. Man's nature is to be active. Usually human activity is after external or objective pleasure as contrasted with subjective pleasure. It is objective pleasure which impels him to have his mouth wide open to swallow the whole world and to achieve what he considers his pleasure. He is not in need of liberty or freedom of the will of which nature has</page><page sequence="8">208 Annals of the Bkandarkar Oriental Research Institute endowed him with more than he requires. But he has no re- straints provided for against his reokless dissipations. The one restraint devised in the Vedãnta sastra is Nivrtti or withdrawal from all kinds of objective pursuits except those which natural and involuntary animal appetite demands from him. These animal cravings are, in the words of the Upanisads, thirteen in number. They are ( 1 ) seeing ( 2 ) hearing ( 3 ) touohing ( 4 ) smelling ( 5 ) eating ( 6 ) walking ( 7 ) sleeping ( 8 ) breathing ( 9 ) talking ( 10 ) exoretion ( 11 ) catching hold of any support and ( 12 &amp; 13 ) winking i. e„ closing and opening the eye-lids. These are all nature's own activities or involuntary actions. Such acts as are voluntary are regarded as temptations leading man astray unless his actvity is made with no motive or desire for any result thereof. "By the body, " says the Bhagavadgltä,'- by the mind, by the intellect and by mere senses also, Togins perform actions without attachment, for the purification of the self." Thus exclusive attachment to the fruits of bodily actions or intellectual and sensual activities is condemned in clear terms. Is then, it may be questioned, life worth living Î Will any one engage himself in agriculture, trade or other occupa- tions with no desire for the profits accruing from them ? Why should a man marry a wife, if it were not for domestic pleasure ? It must be noted in reply that action is not prohibited in its entirety. All kinds of activities, physical, mental and spiritual, are undertaken for pleasure and pleasure alone. It is pleasure that impels man to be active. Even Yogio practice or mystioism is learnt for pleasure in this or the other world. The Vedäntic Brahmadhyãna or oonstant contemplation on Brahman, the Universal self, is for Moksa which is eternal bliss. " Rãgãdeva pravrttih " " pleasure alone is the motive of action" is the saying of the Mlmãmsakas. But what is meant by non-attachment to fruits of action is this There are two kinds of pleasure, subjective and objective. Subjective pleasure is the nature of the self itself and cannot be avoided. But objective pleasure is neither permanent nor unavoidable. In his Vivekasära ( Mss. p. 72 ), Samkarãnanda says that pleasure is innate, and that objects appearing to give pleasure ette only stimulants. His reasons for arriving at this conclusion are marshalled as follows : - " Is pleasure a quality of the objects enjoyed ? or is it a mental phenomenon ? or is it a characteristic of</page><page sequence="9">A Peep into Ancient Indian Sociology 209 place or time ? or is it a product or result of aotion Î or is it a quality of the senses ? or is it the nature of self itself ? It is not a quality of the objects perceived ; for, the feeling of pleasure experienced at the moment of perceiving an object disappears the next moment, though there is the object still under the act of percep- tion ? If it were a property of the object perceived, the feeling of pleasure would have continued, just as a fragrant smell is continued to be experienced as long as the flower giving rise to the sensation of fragrance remains close by. Hence it follows that it is not a property of the object perceived or enjoyed. Nor is it a function of the mind, for in the absence of objects of enjoyment the mind does not experience the feeling of pleasure, as it would have done if it were its own function. Nor is it the function of the association of mind with objects for even though there is such association, the feeling of pleasure experienced in the first moment of contact disappears the next moment. Nor is it a property of the enjoyer, for, the feeling of pleasure is not constantly experienced. If it were the property of the enjoyer, there would have been no break in experiencing the enjoyer's own property by the enjoyer. Nor is it a characteristic of aotivity, for activity is invariably painful. Nor is it a result of past deeds, for, the body which is believed to be the result of past deeds is a victim of misery and pain Nor is it due to place and environments, for in the same plebee and under the same environments ex- perience of pleasure and pain varies with different men. If it were due to place and envionments, all men in the same place and under the same environ- ments would have felt pleasure or pain equally. Nor is it a property of time, for if it were so, all men would have experienced pleasure equally like heat and cold. Nor is it a property of senses, for the dumb, the deaf, the blind, and the like experience pleasure notwithstanding the deformity of their senses. Then the only remaining alternative is whether it is a property of tbe self. Here there are two issues to be considered : ( 1 ) is it a property of the self pr ( 2 ) is It 2</page><page sequence="10">210 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute the nature of the self. It cannot be said that it is a quality of the self, for, the disappearance of property causes the disappearance of that which possesses . that property or quality as its constituent. But in the case of the self even in the absence of the feeling of pleasure, there is the consciousness of self's existence. Hence it cannot be said to be a quality of the self. It follows that it is the nature of the self itself. But it may be questioned that if pleasure is the nature of Caitanya itself why it is not always felt. " The answer in Samkaränanda's own words is as follows : - "There are two forms of pleasure, subjective and objective, The former is the nature of the self and is eternal, the latter is momentary and is due to external objects whioh are only stimulants. He who has realis- ed self-pleasure does not stand in need of stimulants to experience his own self pleasure. " This is demonstrated even in the life of animals, as stated by áamkarãoãrya in his Sataálokl : With the instinctive belief that pleasure is caused by external objeots, the eagle flies high up in the sky in search of its prey on the surface of the earth. In vain it flies far and wide until at last feeling quite fatigued it perches itself on the branch of a tree, falls asleep and enjoys its own pleasure." Whatever may be the difference in other philosophical matters, there is agreement among all schools of Indian philosophical systems in the theory of pleasure explained above. The Yedãntists, the Buddhists, the Jainas, the Kän&amp;das, the Viaáesikas, the Saivites and the Vaisnavites have all acoepted the Upanisadic theory of pleasure and preaohed renunciation of the world and worldly activity for the sake of momentary pleasure as the best means of realising eternal pleasure. On this theory of pleasure are based their theory of ethics, economics and politios. Reserving eoonomios and politics for consideration in the third and fourth Lectures, I proceed to explain their theory of ethios as briefly as possible In the Vedic period their ethical theory was based upon pleasure and pain. Whatever was considered to be productive of pleasure in this or the other world was regarded</page><page sequence="11">À Peep into Ancient Indian Sociology 211 as Dharma, good and righteous, and the reverse as bad and vicious. Telling the truth, oharity and sacrificial acts are good on acoount of their leading the true, the charitable and the sacrificing to the Svarga, the abode of pleasure, after death. Lie, theft and impiety lead the guilty to hell to suffer for their wickedness. Varuna with his spies is considered to watch over the good and bad deeds of men. This theory of good as pleasure-giving and bad as pain- giving promoted the habit of seeking pleasure and avoiding pain. Since there is no action which is absolutely productive of unmixed pleasure or pain, the Mlmãmsakas or the Exegetists of the Vedas expounded a new theory of Dharma and Adharma, good and bad. Jaimini in his Mlmämsä-sötras defines Dharma as. follows : - " Codanälaksano'rtho Dharm ah. " The meaning of this aphorism according to authoritative oommentators is this : - Whatever is enjoined by a verb in imperative mood in a sentence in the Vedas, or in the common parlance, and is at the same time beneficial, but not harmful, is Dharma. In this definition is inoluded both religious and secular Dharmas. In the Vedic sentenoe, " Whoever is de- sirous of attaining to Svarga, the abode of pleasure, after death, shall perform the Jyotistoma sacrifice," the Jyotistoma sacrifice is Dharma, since it is believed to enable the performer to attain to Heaven after death. This aot is also beneficiai. In the sentence " Whoever is desirous of causing the death of an enemy, shall perform Syena saorifice, the sacrificial aot is harmful, inasmuch as it causes the death of a person and thereby involves the performer in sin. Likewise in the sent- ences oommonly used in conversation : - "Whoever is desirous of long life shall drink milk," and " whoever is desirous of long life shall not drink liquor," milk-drinking is good and liquor-drinking is bad. In the case of Vedio sacrificial acts the result is invisible, while in worldly acts the result is rea- lised sooner or later. The theory propounded in the Sutra is that the conception of good and bad, and virtue and vice is not an innate idea of man. It is aoquired through language in social intercourse; the language which supplies information as to what is good or bad or what is virtuous and vicious may be a religious text</page><page sequence="12">HZ Annoi 8 of the Bhandarkàr Oriental Research Institute traditionally handed down from generation to generation, or a secular sentence now and then heard in common parlance. Language is a social product, and whatever is known through language is social experience, acquired, tested and proved by a number of generations. It follows therefore that the conception of good and bad and virtue and vice is the result of social evolution. Whatever act receives social approbation is regarded as Dharma and whatever act meets with social condem- nation is Adharma. The Western expounders of the evolu- tionary hypothesis of ethics are of the same opinion: according to Mr. Stephen "the normal sense is a product of the social factor." ( Science of Ethics p. 372 ). Again on pages 350 and 351 he says that " the conscience is the utterance of the public spirit of the race, ordering us to obey the primary conditions of its welfare." Mr. Laird in his " Study in Moral Theory " says, agreeing with Kanťs theory of categorical imperative, that " Duties are unconditional demands, categorical imperatives, self - justifying injunctions. The " ought " of morality may very well justify itself." (page 20). Again on page 40 he says that " A categorical proposition is a statement asserted directly and without conditions or governing conjunc- tions, while a hypothetical proposition is one in which the apodosis is expressly contingent upon and governed by, a ruling protasis ( or assumption or hypothesis ). Extending this usage by analogy, Kant meant by a Categorical Imperative one that is not subject to conditions or qualifications, but on the contrary " shines lise a jewel by its own light," while a Hypothetical Imperative is borrowed and contingent. The latter class Kant subdivided into rules of skill and counsels of prudence remarking that the precepts for the physician to cure his patient and for a prisoner to kill him " are equally matters of skill, and that prudence can never yield us cer- tainty. A command of morality is subject to no governing clause. Counsels inform us that we must employ certain means if we desire certain ends." The obligatory and optional rules enjoined in the Vedas are quite similar to the duties commanded by categorical and hypothetical imperatives referred to by Mr. Laird. " Tell the truth; do not steal," " Thou shalt have no intercourse with others' wives " are assertions containing categorical imperatives enjoining, under all conditions and circumstances, the duty of telling the truth and of committing no theft or adultery. The</page><page sequence="13">A Peep into Ancient Indian Sociology 213 duty of performing a Jyotistoma sacrifice with the desire of getting into heaven is enjoined by a hypothetical imperative such as "Svargakãmo Jyotistomena Yajeta, " whoever is desirous of Svarga, pleasure, shall perform Jyotistoma sacrifice. Lekewise in all worldly and other-worldly acts it is these two kinds of imperatives that inspire the sense of obligatory or optional duties in man. There are two schools of thinkers regarding the origin of these imperatives. One school ascribes the origin to Pratibhã , intuition, and the other to sacred or secular sentences. We shall see mor6 of these theories in the second lecture. Since social experience is ever growing and therefore varying from time, to time, the conception of good and bad must also necessarily vary with time. This is confirmed by the history of morals, of all nations and admits of no doubt. The conception of good and bad, ^ right and wrong and virtue and vice varies not only with time but also with the place and evironment. In case of doubt, it is only social approbation and condemnation of a course of action that is regarded as a determinant of its goodness and badness at the time and place. This is clearly stated in the Taittirlya Bräh- mana : " if the student has doubt concerning an act or conduct, then recourse should be had to the attitude of Brahmans, com- petent to judge, apt, devoted, not harsh, lovers of virtue; as they behave themselves in such a case so should the student behave himself. " Svetaketu's protest against his fathers attempt to allow an honoured guest to lie down with his mother is an instance of customs changing according to change in sentiment due to time. In the polytheistic stage of the Vedic period, the ethical views of the invading Aryans were such as were quite suited to the time and place. Probably no other people would behave better than they did under the circumstances. Judged by their myths and anthropomorphic views about their gods, they do appear to be as indifferent to the moral qualities of their acts as the Greeks and the Romans. But it is wrong to base our judgment about the morality of a people on their myths. Jealousy, malice, treachery, gambling, plunder, and capture of women are sins and crimes from which no warlike people of ancient time were free. But we are not justified in coming to the conclusion that the attrocities committed by a people in war form the true moral code of their conduct in peace., Nor</page><page sequence="14">214 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental ÈeseOrch institute are we right in basing the moral code of a people on the an- thropomorphic features and conduct of their gods, inasmuch as we do not know exaotly what sort of natural phenomena the poets were obliged to describe in terms of their gods' immoral demeanour, which they were not slow to condemn out-right. For violating the chastity of Ahalyä, Indra is cursed to possess a body of thousand bhagas ( uvulas ). Such abnormal traits of oharacter and conduct are termed sãhasa, indiscreet acts, and are expressly condemned as bad examples never to be imitated. Henoe I presume that the remarks made by Dr. A. B. Keith on the ethics of the Brãhmanas are far from being deserved. In his religion and philosophy of the Yedas ( vol II, p. 470 ) he says that " these texts ( the Brãhmanas ) do not develop any theory of morality. Indeed they do not normally inculcate morality even on merely empiric grounds. The myths which they recount and invent have this characteristic about them, that they are indifferent to the moral qualities of the acts ; the gods are willing to commit sins freely for their own gain." As I have already stated, it is quite unreasonable to base the moral oode of a people on their myths. If we were to do so, there would be nò nation on earth free from the charge of immorality. Regarding the insolence and insult shown in asking the wife of the sacrificer, as pointed out by Dr. Keith, whether she has consorted with any other than her husband, I presume that what is emphasized here in putting such a ques- tion to the wife is the maintenance of her fidelity to her hus- band, but not her faithlessness and her hesitation or readiness to confess il The insistence on the confession about the perpetration of guilt, if any, is a preventive, and not an induce- ment to commit crime for the sake of confessing it. The Sub- rahmanya litany sung at the outset of a sacrifice, declaring that the priests engaged for the sacrifice are legitimate ohildren of Brãhman couples, faithful to each other ( Subrahmanya ), equally shows the paramount importance whioh the ancient Indians attaohed to the maintenace of chastity on the part of both man and woman. It is wrong to interpret this litany as indicating promiscuity in ancient Indian society. The marri- age of Draupadi to the five sons of Pãndu is explained by Kumärila, die oelebrated commentator on Jaimini's Mlmãmsã sütras, as a mythological story metaphorically describing the exeroise of sovereign power by the five brothers together. In answer to the question put to her whether she has consorted with any other than her five husbands, she stated that she had</page><page sequence="15">A Peep into Ancient Indian Sociology 215 a liking for a sixth husband also. This is commonly inter- preted as a reference to Karna, the eldest son of Pãndu, who would have also married Draupadl or had a share in sovereign power, if he had not been deserted or abandoned by Kunti, his mother. Ágain it is obligatory on the part of every man of the twice-born castes, the Brähmans,the Ksatriyas and the Vaisyas, to sip water by saying in the Yedic words of the morning or evening prayer, that he may be absolved of such unconscious transgressions as he might , have committed in mind, or speech, with hands or feet or in eating or in sexual intercourse, or any other sin committed during the day or night. In this connection it is wrong to represent the Hindus as being ever ready to pray for redemption from sins which they have no scruples in commit« ting. As a matter of fact this prayer is intended to remind every twice-born individual twioe a day of his sacred duty to guard himself against the usual human tendency of unconsciously going astray. The authors of the Dharma- sõtras all are unanimous in saying that there can be no redemption from sins which are deliberately committed, though there is permission in the Sästras to absolve a man of his unconsoious transgressions and grant him admission into society. " Those who unconsoiously fall into error and confess it, taking care not to repeat such errors again for a second time are termed sensible (Stmavat): those that wilfully commit sins in spite of warning are habitual criminals ( durätmans ); and those who conceal the crimes they oommit are the worst sinners. The teacher can bring round and set right the oonduct of the sensible ; the king will ohastise the criminals, while Yama, the god of death alone is the ohastiser of the worst sinners. As regards the absenoe of development of any theory of morality in the Brãhmanas, I have not dearly understood what Dr. Keith has meant thereby. I do not know whether he refers to the Hedonistio, Intuitive, and Utilitarian theories of morality which have made so muoh noise in books and papers without any benefit to society and to its moral improve- ment. It is not that the anoients were not aware of the He- donistic theory of morality. It is implied in the very example quoted in illustrating the definition of Dharma, good, by Jaimini in his Mlmämsä sütras. The illustrative sentence is " whoever is desirous of attaining to Svarga, the abode of</page><page sequence="16">2Í6 Annals of the Bhandarlmr Oriental Research Institute pleasure shall perform the Jyotistoma sacrifice". Pleasure as motive for action is made olear here. Utility as a motive for action is clearly stated in the oft quoted verse meaning ' with no end in view not even an idiot sets to work The intuitive theory is given expression to by Kälidäs.a in his Säkuntala : " Pramänamantah-karanapravrttayah authoritative are automatic or instinctive movements. Besides, the age of the Brãhmanas is too early a period in the evolution of the Aryan to expect Jjim to theorise on social, moral or political principles. In the age of the Upanisads, we have a grand theory of morality which will be dealt with presently. The Purãnic and Agamic age is noted for the elaboration of theories of morality based upon divine inspiration social consciousness, and intuitive suggestions or oommands. The treatment of this subject will be taken up again along with the development of the Ãgamio and the Dravidian oulture. But none of these theories can be demonstrated and proved. After all, whatever obtains social approbation is good, and whatever is socially condemned is bad, as implied in Jaimini's famous definition of Dharma. 1 presume that our scientific age has made no improvement on this definition; nor are we in a better position to give decisive answers to questions on the morality of a nation or of an individual, we only appeal to public opinion. Again taking the Brähmanic sentence that "gods are true," Dr. Keith remarks on it by saying that "the nature of the truth is not vitally moral : it is strictly confined to the precise carrying out of the rites and utterance of the formulae of the sacrificial ritual. Just as man's faith is not in the goodness of the gods, but in the efficacy of the sacrifice, if duly performed, so truth has no real moral content and in intellectual outlook is limit- ed to the sacrifice which, it must be admitted, is for the Brãhmanas, the reality par excellence" Here also I presume that Dr. Keith is not right in his interpretation. By the Brãhmana saying that " gods are true " is meant the regularity and the precise periodioity of their heavenly movements. In the statement made in the Bãhmanas that corresponding to the precision of the movements of the gods, the sacrifioial performance must also be preoise and exaot in all its details the Brãhmanas do not refer to any moral truth here. Like the word good, the word true means many things. A true picture means a picture exaotly corresponding to its original. A true answer means a correot answer. A true man means a</page><page sequence="17">A Peep into Ancient Indian Sociology 217 man stating facts as they are seen, heard or known to him or keeping his word. So in the context referred to by Dr. Keith, the word true ( satya ) is used to mean precision and not moral truth, and it is not fair to condemn the authors of the Brãhmanas because they do not use the word " true " in its moral sense when preoision is meant by them to be conveyed by the word. When however the Brähmana means moral truth, as in the sentence " satyam vada " it certainly means moral truth, but not preoision or exactitude there. But generally speaking the question arises what is truth after all ? The ultimate truth is really unknown and the Upanisads speak volumes in favour of the sincere and com- mendable attempts made by the ancient Indians to ascertain the nature of the ultimate truth and deduce therefrom the nature of the relative truth also. Vyãvaharika-satya is the name given to relative truth. They profess that they have succeeded in their attempt and found out that the absolute ultimate truth is Caitanya, Saccidãnanda, and nothing else. Self is true and matter is mere appearance and so false. The physical body is material and is transient as contrasted with the eternity of the spirit, the Saccidãnanda. Since the spirit is complete in itself and is wanting in nothing, no action good or bad is needed for the sake of the spirit. It is the, physical body that needs constant action to repair its wear and tear. It is this action that is susceptible of being looked upon either as good or bad, right or wrong, just or unjust according as it is done with attention to spiritual, or physical well-being. On the spiritual plane there is needed no such distinction as good or bad, for there is no action whatever- On the material side this distinction is needed more than we have aotually allowed. The ideal ever kept before the view by the Vedãntins and even by the Jainas is what is termed Naiskarmyasiddhi, realisation of the stat? of inaction, and annihilation of the will. When the will is subdued and the state of inaction is attained in Samädhi or concentration of the mind on Caitanya, there is no occasion for such a Yogi to think of good or bad, right or wrong, and just or unjust. He has nothing to do with such distinctions for he has abandoned all actions. No such thoughts as those of slaying an embryo, the murder of a father or a mother will ever dawn in his mind, for the realisation of the true nature of Caitanya or self has once for all raised him to the spiritual sphere which is beyond the world's moral sphere, 3</page><page sequence="18">218 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute Speaking of Carlyle's views on morality ; Martineau says in his Types of ethical theory, P. 35, that" according to the latter (Carlyle) there is something higher than moral life; a region in which the authority of the right and the good vanishes and ceases to be supreme : as soon as we meet the divine, we leave moral distinctions behind. It is regrettable that such a great Sanskrit scholar as Dr. A. B. Keith has misunderstood the spirit of the philosophy of the Upanisads and found no ground of morality in it. He says in his Religion and Philosophy of the Vedas ( vol 2, p. 584-5 ) " There is made no attempt to make the theoretical philosophy a ground of morality of any sort. " The possession of knowledge makes a man independent of all morality, the slaying of an embryo, the murder of a father or a mother." They have completely failed to see that morality is the most objective and essential part of philosophy. " Know- ledge in the Upanisads is essentially profitable and by no means for spiritual ends alone. He who knows the world as five-fold obtains it, he who knows Indra as without a rival has no rival ; the possessor of knowledge cannot be injured by an enemy. Knowledge obliterates evil ; one who knows may consort with even the murderer without being contaminated. " ( p. 586 ), Also he terms the philosophy of the Upanisads as " intellectual gymnastics " and Yogic practice as " wild fantasies. " The principal aim of the Upanisads is the realisation of the state of inaction. How can it then afford a ground for morality which is entirely objective ? As it has no ooncern with the world of action, good or bad, it is above the moral or immoral world, where there can be no talk of the slaying of an embryo, the murder of a father or of the mother, Prof, Keith says that " Knowledge in the Upanisads is for profitable and by no means for 'spiritual ends alone. *' Knowledge taught in the Upanisads is self-knowledge and self-knowledge alone Except spiritual ends what other ends, it may be questioned, do the Upanisads promise? It cannot be children, or money; for renunciation of wife, childern, wealth in short, • of the world itself, is the first and most saored and indispensable duty of a Self-seeker. Is it empire-making or exploiting of other nations? According to Dr. Keith himself there is no politioal theory taught or expounded in the Upanisads. The Upaniáadio sentence '* whoever knows the world five-fold obtains it " refers to the Pañclkarana process of the origin of the world and its</page><page sequence="19">À Peep irdo Ancient Indián Sociology Ž19 obtainment means the knowledge of its nature. It does not mean that the knower of the world becomes a lord or an emperor of it. The knowledge of Indra as without a rival means the knowledge oť Brahman without a second entity either similar or dissimilar to Brahman, the individual self also being the same as Brahman according to the Upanisads. Hence it follows that the knower of Brahman becomes Brahman and will have no rival and will be free from all sorts of fear, sorrow and the like. Hence there will be no evil to the knower of Brahman. As to Dr. Keith's characterisation of the philosophy of the Upanisads as intellectual gymnastics, I may say that there are now many politically minded or worldly minded Hindus who, inebriated with a strong dose of modern material sciences, have formed the same opinion no* merely of the Upanisads, but also of the Buddhistic and Jaina philosophies. But it must be noted that what appears to us as fantasies and intellectual gymnastics have come out from a mind which transformed itself into what it thought of, and which lived in it. We study that life and pass remarks and judgments upon it from the standpoint of our own life. We cannot make those thoughts our own, for we cannot live the life of those thoughts. But the authors of the Upanisads could not have given expression to those sublime thoughts unless they experienced them and lived in them. They were neither spectators nor actors of their spiritual drama, but its actual or real characters or the spiritual dramatic personae whom we can neither see nor imitate. " The true ideal therefore says Pr. Keith, ( p. 587 ) " of the seeker for truth is embodied in the practice of asceticism and the adoption of renunciation : by turning away from the things of the world and by concentrating unnaturally the mind upon the object, the vision beatific was to be obtained : the utter incompatibility of this with the purely intellectual view, that the recognition of the Brahman as the self was emancipation, is obvious, but contradictions in adjecto are the normal characteristics of the Upanisads. Hence was developed the scheme by which the old rule of life was complicated and a series of four Ãáramas, places of asceticism, was devised, through which man should pass on his way to his home in the heaven. " Like so many philosophic theories, the theory or theories of philosophy expounded in the Upanisads may be purely</page><page sequence="20">220 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute intellectual and the means devised for the attainment of the end may or may not be compatible with the view. None of us is prepared to test the truth of this or that philosophy or religion and establish it as a world religion or philosophy to the exclusion of other faiths or systems. All that I am prepar- ed to say here is that like other philosophical systems, the Indian systems have their moral and political corollaries which seem to have proved more beneficial to the world than the maxims and principals deduced from other philosophical systems of the western world. Whatever might be the other kinds of differences between the East and the West, the one that appears to me most conspicuous is that while the East is bent on translating into action as far as possible its religious and philosophical lessons, neglecting at the same time almost all the practical principles of material soiences, the West is ever keen in shaping its life to the tune of the objective sciences with only an academic interest in metaphysics and religion. This is a trait of hereditary difference between them. Consequently the West is material- ly rich and politically supreme while the East is proud of its philosophical contentment amidst the miseries of poverty and servility. With a view to act up to its philosophical lessons, the life of a Hindu is divided into four stages or Âáramas as they are called. They are ( 1 ) the stage of student life, ( 2 ) of house- holder ( 3 ) of a hermit residing in a forest, and ( 4 ) that of renunciation ( samnyãsa ). While describing the characteristic features of the life of the members of the Baghu dynasty in his Baghuvamáa ( canto 1 ), Kãlidãsa speaks of the purposes of the four stages of life as follows : - " Kings who spent their early age in learning, their youth enjoying their objective pleasure, their old age in living like forest hermits, and who breathed their last following the precepts of the Yoga system." We learn that most of the young boys of the twice-born class in ancient India spent their first stage of life in learning in the Ãéramas from their respective gurus. After going through the course of their learning in the forest Universities, they returned to their native places, - either cities or vili ages- to live as house-holders. However severe might be the rules of discipline laid down in the sütras and Dharmáãstra texts</page><page sequence="21">A Peep into Ancient Indian Sociology 221 for the guidance of house-holders, it is probable that under the temptations of city life they did not follow the ideal set for them in the Sastra texts. I presume that a majority of the Brähman house-holders deserved the censure passed on their life by the Buddha, in the dialogue between him and a Brah- man named Vasettba in the Tevigga Sutta ( II, 3 ). " Now what think you, Vasettha," asks the Buddha, " are the Brähmans versed in the Vedas in the posses- sion of wives and wealth, or are they not ?" " They are, Gotama. " " Have they anger in their hearts, or have they not?" "They have, Gotama," " Do they bear malice, or do they not ?" " They do, Gotama." " Are they pure in heart, or are they not ?" " They are not, Gotama." " Have they self-mastery, or have they not ? " " They have not, Gotama." " Very good, Vasettha, that the Brähmans versed in the Vedas, yet bearing anger and malice in their hearts, sinful and uncontrolled, should, after death when the body is dissolved, become united to Brahman who is free from anger and malice, sinless and has self-mastery such a condition of things has no existence." This censure seems to refer to the plurality of wives they married, and to the variety of occupations in whioh they engaged themselves for the sake of earning wealth. Their professions also are thus enumerated in the same work as follows. - " By predicting that there will be abundant rainfall, abundant harvest, famine disturbances, sickness or health, or by drawing deeds, making up accounts, giving pills, making verses, or arguing points or casu- istry, or by giving advice touching the taking in mar- riage, or giving in marriage, the forming of alliances, or dissolutions of connections; by teaching spells to procure prosperity or to cause adversity to others ; or by worshipping the sun, or by worshipping Brahma, by spitting fire out of their mouth, - this, too, is the kind of goodness that he ( the Brahman ) has."</page><page sequence="22">%%% Annals of the Bhandark».r Oriental Research ittslitu'é Though this seems to be a true account of the life of house-holders among the Brahmans and others, yet it cannot be denied that there were a few who by the exemplary life they lived according to the rules of tìie Dharmsãstra texts earn- ed and deserved the honour and respect shown to them by kings and wealthy men. There are records to show that there were Brãhmans of the type of the celebrated scholar Vedãntadeáika who despising even the voluntary gift of honour and wealth offered by kings and emperors and content with a handful of rice collected from house to house by way of begging alms, devoted their life to study, teaching, and writing on all the subjects then known. Vedãntadeáika sincerely believed in the teachings of the áãstras and declined to accept an honourable and economically comfortable posi- tion offered by the then emperor of Yijayanagara. The large number of works written and left by him on almost all branches of Sanskrit learning, speak volumes in favour of the vast learning he had and of the use he made of it for the good of posterity. Appaya Däksita is another luminary of learning with whose scholarly work almost all sanskrit scholors are quite familiar. Sivãnanda has given us a short sketch of his exemplary life. He is said to have made an offering into the sacred sacrificial fire of the costly presentations sent to him by the king of Tanjore. Haläuyudha in his Brähmana- sarvasva says or implies to say that amidst the luxurious favour shown to him by the king of the Käkatiya dynasty he lived a life to the very letter of the áãstras. Such examples are numerous, and are not given here for want of space. But for their selfless life and true devotion to learning, there would have been no literary monuments to speak of India's ancient civilization. What would have been the verdict of the western critics on India's ancient civilization, if there had been no Pãnini, Patañjali, Jaimini, Bãdarãyana, Sabara, Kumãrila, Prabhãkara, Samkara, Bãmãnuja, Halãyudha, Yãdavaprakãáa, Vãgbhata, Vedãntadeáika, Mãdhva, Vidyãranya, Appaya Dlksita, and a host of other true Brähman scholars. Had they but exhibited any inclination for the acquisition of wealth and a taste for pompous life of power« they would have succeeded in it and passed away, not merely themselves unknown, but making it possible and plausible for or itics to say that India is a country of savages given to sensual and immoral life. It cannot be denied that the Buddhists and the Jainas, have also made a large contribution</page><page sequence="23">A Peep into Ancient Indian Sociology 223 fco the glory of India in intellectual and spiritual fields. They are no other than Brähmans that embraced Buddhism and Jainism. As most of them lived the life of monks not dissimilar to that of Brahman Vanaprasthas or forest hermits, they can better be classed with the latter. As the influence which the Vanaprasthas and the Samnyãsins, with their experience of life acquired during the two previous stages of life and with their independent thought, had exerted not only on the social and political life of the people in cities and villages, but also on the life of kings, was most salutary and disciplinary, it is necessary that some notice of their life should be taken here. % Self-abnegation, living by sweat or by begging, and original thinking seem to have been the characteristic feature and guiding principle of their life. According to the Purãnas, the founders of Sãmkhya, Nyãya, Vaiáesika, Mïmâmsâ, Vedänta and other systems of philosophy were men of the Vãnaprastha order, living upon fruits, roots and other forest produce in forests. Regarding the dietary of the hermits, the Baudhäyana Smrti ( IV. 3 ) says as follows ; - " Then there are two kinds of hermits ; those that cook their food and those that do not cook their food, Those that cook their food are of five kinds : ( 1 ) Sarvãranyaka, ( 2 ) Vaitusika, ( 3 ) ^ Kandamülapha- labhaksa, ( 4 ) Phalabhaksa and ( 5 ) Säkäbhaksa. The Sarväranyakas are of two kinds : ( 1 ) Indrâvasikta and ( 2 ) Retovasikta, as they live upon two different kinds of forest produce- The Indrãvasiktas are those who bring edible stuffs produced by creepers, plants, shrubs, and trees and cook them ; and having offered oblations thereof into the fire both morning and even- ing and having fed ascetics, guests and other persons engaged in penance, live upon what remains thereof. The Retovasiktas are those who gather the flesh of wild animals killed by a tiger, wolf, hawk, or any other beast of prey and cook it ; and having offered obla- tions thereof into the fire both morning and evening, and having fed ascetics, guests and other persons engag- ed in penance therewith, live upon what remains there- of. The Vaitusikas are those who collecting grains with- out chaff and especially rice, cook them and having offered oblations into the fire both morning and even-</page><page sequence="24">224 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute ing and having fed ascetics, guests and other persons engaged in penance therewith, live upon what remains thereof. Those who live upon turnips, roots and fruits or upon fruits only or upon herbs only do also likewise. Those that do not cook their food are of five kinds : ( 1 ) Mumajjakas, ( 2 ) Pravrttãáins, ( 3 ) Mukhãdãyins, ( 4 ) Toyãhãras and (5) Vãyubhaksas. The Mumujjakas are those who prepare their food without making use of metalic or stone vessels. The Pravrttãáins are those that live upon morsels that can be held in their hands. Mukhãdãyins are those who oatch hold of their food by their mouth without using their hand. The Toyãhãras are those who live merely upon water and the Vãyubhaksas only upon air. Living in oompany with the antelopes and imitating their life in all respects : this is the charaoteristio of heavenly life on earth." Many are familiar with the story of Dillpa poetically described by Kãlidãsa in his Raghuvamša. The king is said to have followed the NandinI cow of Vasistha» his family priest, just like the cow's shadow* Moving when the cow mov- ed, sitting when it sat, drinking when it drank and resting when it took rest. According to the Sutra literature of the Jainas there existed in ancient India a sect of people called Govratika who took delight in following the movements of cows tended by them and imitated their life in all respeots. It is clear from the above that a Brahman's or Esatriya* s life was not as much stereotyped as it is found in the later Smrti works. In the Vedic and the Sutra periods man was free to act as he liked with necessary self-control and belief in the existence of the other world. He may follow an old sect with its ideal of life set before him or consistently with the principle of self-abnegation of the Vãnaprasthas he may expound a new philosophy of life and form a new sect. The hermitages of Rsyasriiga, Mãrkandeya and Badarlnãtha, described in the Mahäbhärata ( Vana 3 : 130; and 147. ) exemplify the freedom of thought and activity in social and religious spheres of the ancient Indians. The hermitage of Kan va described in the first and fourth aots of the Sãkuntala and that of Vasistha in the first canto of the Raghuvamsa are also typioal Vãnaprastha institutions.</page><page sequence="25">A Peep into Ancient Indian Sociology Ž25 The Devïbhâgavata ( V. 32 ) gives a vivid description of the typical hermitage of a hermit called Sumedhas arid of the self-denying life which he and other hermits in that hermitage lived " Having recognised the hermitage of the devoted sage, Sumedhas, at a distance of three yojanas, the king ( Suratha by name ) went to it. Full of a number of trees and situated in the sandy bank of river, full of tamed wild animals, pleasing with songs of cuckoo, resounding with the voice of students studying their lessons, full of hundreds of antelopes, with dishes of well-cooked wild rice, abounding in trees of sweet flowers and fruits, causing pleasant feelings to all with the sweat smelling smoke of oblations made into the fire, with the echoes of the sounds of Vedic hymns recited, and more charming than even the abode of the celestials, having come in view of such a hermitage, the king was pleased. Having renounced all fear, he made up his mind to take rest in the happy retreat of the Brahman sage. Having tied his horse to a tree close by, and having seen the sage seated on a deer skin under the shadow of a sala tree, with tranquil mind, with his body emaciated by the observance of penance, open-hearted, teaching the Vedas to a number of students, learned in the Vedas, Sastras, and their secret meaning, devoid of anger, greed, and other passions, free from the trouble of mutually opposing pair of worldly affections such as heat and cold and the like, devoid of jealousy, ever bent on attaining the knowledge of the soul, speaking the truth, and having his mind under control, the king went to him with modesty and said : - " I am a king Suratha by name ; and having been defeated by my foes, I gave up my country house, and wife, and came here seeking your protection. 99 The sage replied, " Reside here, -O king, with no fear. None of your mighty enemies will ever step here scared by the power of my penance. No animals should be slaughterd here. Following the customs of the hermits here, O best of the kings, life should be sustained with wild rice, fruits and roots."-* * Compare BhSgavata XX. IB . 4</page><page sequence="26">226 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute According to the Srlmadbhãgavata ( XI, 18 ) it is the duty of a hermit to live upon the substance procured by him and to take nothing offered by others. The Rãmayãna gives lucid descriptions of a number of hermitages visited by Rãma. A charming description of Kanva's hermitage is found in the Säkuntala of Kãlidãsa. It follows therefore that hermitages played an important part in the life of ancient Indians, and had exercised considerable influence on the intellectual and Spiritual life of the people. It is also clear from the above passages that the hermitages of anoient Indians were invariably situated in an extensive forest tract on the bank of a perennial river, congenial to the growth of flowers, fruits, roots, and wild rice. They were a sort of a University full of professors ready to teach and students eager to learn. They were an asylum for the afflioted either in body or in mind or in both, who for the alleviation of their physioal or mental infirmities, sought remedies at the hands of the sages in the hermitages. They were a safe re- treat for kings defeated on the battle fields and chased by their blood-thirsty conquerors. Once within the boundary of a her- mitage, the run-away kings were safe, as their terrible enemies dreaded the power of the penance of the hermits. The hermit- ages may be termed as cities without walls or polioe for protec- tion. In fact they needed no suoh things ; for the hermits had neither gold nor granaries in their possession. They had no worldly things to lose and had therefore no fear from worldly enemies. Their food was simple and accessible to the needy, whether man or beast, and consisted of wild rice, fruits and roots. All classes of ancient Aryans found the Ãsramas a happy retreat for their old age. That people of the Vaisya olass also spent their old age in hermitages, is corroborated by the story of Suratha narrated in the Saptaàatl. Besides, as a rule, (hermits) and monks (samnyãsins) Vãna- prasthashave to oast away caste-distinotions and also to aban- don the observance of religious rites and image worship. In his Vivekasãra, treatise on the Advaita philosophy, Samkarãnanda the teacher of Säyana Mädhava, writes, consistently with the principles of Advaita non-dualism and the teaohing of the Upanisads as follows ( p. 11, 12 and 24 ). " He who performs religious rites with a view to attain heavenly bliss cannot be credited even with a</page><page sequence="27">À Peep into Ancient Indian Sociology 227 trace of wisdom. He who looks upon images made of mud, stone or wood as gods cannot be credited even with a trace of wisdom. The worship of gods is for no good ; nor is pilgrimage to sacred places productive of any- good " Religious rites do not deserve perform- ance, because their results, if any, must necessarily be as perishable as the seeds of grains sown and. harvested ; nor can the performance of religious rites purge the mind of its impure thoughts, inasmuch as the performance itself is due to impure thought such as desire for some naturally perishable good. " 44 Appearance is misleading and false. Idols are ap- pearances like the objective world. Hence, like the world, idols are no reality. The various forms of wor- ship are all likewise appearances and cannot therefore be reality. Hence the good expected to result from wor- ship must necessarily be other than reality. No en- deavour to obtain water from mirage can succeed. Similar is the endeavour to obtain good from idol- worship. Worship is an act. But no act is a means for liberation. Those who worship idols with immense faith for the attainment of liberation endea- vour to do the impossible act of covering the sky [with a mat. A man becomes what he thinks. Hence he who worships can become the worshipped i. e. another limited being. But limitation is no emancipation." ( pp. 53-54 ). Regarding the absurdity of all caste distinctions in parti- cular, he says. " A wise man should withdraw from the world of name and form, * the thou and I' 4 This is a Brahman and that is a Südra.' For such differences are only real to a fool. But a wise man should not behave like a fool. Unity liberates man and duality involves him in bondage. " It follows therefore that the duty of the Vanaprasthas and Samnyãsins is to confine their attention to realisation of Self by constant meditation on Individual Self as Universal Self. With a view to achieve this end he has to follow the method taught in the Yoga philosophy. As a preliminary step in the</page><page sequence="28">228 Annals qf the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute practioe of Toga, the beginner bas to shun all desire and oonoentrate his mind on any single object and learn high think» ing. As a rule abstinence from injury to animals and men, veracity, abstinence from theft, continence, and avoidance of avariciousness must be strictly observed. It is a mistake to call Yoga practice mysticism. He should not shun society. It is laid down in the Yoga sütra I, 33 : " The mind becomes pure by cultivating the habit of friendliness towards those who are fond of objective pleasure, compassion towards those who are suffering from pain and indifference towards those who are vicious." Quite similar is the view of the Buddhists and the Jainas on the nature of the* world and our life within it. None of the three sohools of philosophers, the Advaitins, the Buddhists and the Jainas admit and own a personal god. Their ideal in life is to get rid of the six enemies, desire, anger, greed, delusion, pride and malice, and attain a state of inaction by shunning all action, except that which is unavoidable, to ac- quire as much food as may be necessary to keep the body and soul together with a view to attain perfection and liberation With regard to the conception of emancipation and the means of attaining it, however, not only these three schools, but also the various hermitages differed from each other. As already referred to, the conclusions of the Sämkhyas were quite different from those of other schools of thought which also differed from each other. In self denial, control over senses and contempt for worldly possessions, they were all alike. As stated by Cänakya in his Arthaéãstra, the one aim of all the ããstras is control of senses (Indriyajaya), without which man can aspire for no success in this or the other world. The same was the central theme of the Jainas and the Buddhists. In their view, for a selfish man this world is a hell and the other nill. They do not deserve the oharge of pessimism brought against them. In portraying life in this world as purely mis- erable and life in the other worlds unmixed pleasure, the aim of the ancient Indians was an indirect attaok on selfishness and commendation of self-abnegation. It was not a disappoint- ed man's despair of all hope and pleasure in life. As will be pointed out in a later lecture, Ãtmãnanda, pleasure internal, in Self, or subjective pleasure, was in their view better than ob«</page><page sequence="29">A Peep into Ancient Indian Sociology 229 jective pleasure or Visayasukha. Their constant experience of subjective pleasure banished from their mind all thoughts of suicide or of desire for early death. The experience of intellec- tual and spiritual pleasure coupled with a desire to do good to others and to reclaim the erring world from the path of sin, kindled in their breast a strong desire for long life. To this effect there is a verse attributed to the Buddha and quoted by Bhäskara in his commentary on the Vedänta sütras of Bädarä- yana : Äkäsasya sthitir yãvat Yãvadapy avaneh sthitih Tãvan mama sthifcir bhöyät Visvapäpäni nighnatah II As long as the sky lasts and as long as the globe of the earth lasts so long may my life last, desirous as I am to eradicate the world of its sins. Equally interesting are the verses which convey the same idea and which are put in the mouth of Jimütavähana in the drama of Nãgãnanda : - Sayyä sädvalam, ãsanam sucisilä, sadma drumänäm adhah Sïtam nir jharaväri pänam ašanam kandäh sahãyã mrgäh I Ity aprãrthitalabhyasarvavibhave doso'yan* eko vane Duspräpärthini yat parãrthaghatanãvandhyair vrthã sthiyateii Bed is the green grass ; a clean seat is the stone; home under the trees ; the water of water-falls is a cool drink ; roots are foodstuffs : companions are the deer ; in fche forest with such flourish of supplies of necessaries unsought for there is only one defect : namely, that man has to live in vain with no hope of benefiting the needy that are scarcely seen here. With a desire to save the life of the Väsuki snake by offer- ing his own body to Garuda, Jimütavähana is made to say again as follows. Samraksatä pannagam adya punyam Mayãrjitam yat svasarlradãnãt l Bhave bhave tena mamaiva bhüyät Paropakäräya áarlralãbhah II In virtue of the merit which I have earned just now by offering my own body inorder to save the life of the Väsuki snake, let me have in an endless series of births the profit of possession of a body for the sake of helping others.</page><page sequence="30">230 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute It is this spirit of self-abnegation with a strong desire to preserve life both for experiencing spiritual pleasure and for the good of others that formed the predominant thought of all schools of Philosophic systems. Tt is this self-luminous ray of thought that renders life charming, alike for the poor and the rich, the educated and the uneducated. It is this inner con- tentment that made India both ancient and modern submissive to law and order. It is incredible that a community of people divided into three classes on the basis of profession rather than birth, and proud of its intellectual and spiritual freedom, should be sub- missive to political slavery. There is ample evidence to prove that in their hermitages the ancient Ãryans had a sort of politico-religious form of government independent of the king of the state in which the hermitages were situated. They had no material wealth enough to tempt either criminal tribes to plunder them at dark nights, or civilized robber-like kings to carry off their wealth by day light. They were remarkable for their moral and spiritual wealth. Nevertheless the her- mitages were not free from temptations. In addition to the herds of cattle and deer, the hermits had their wives and daughters bo charming as to tempt an Indra or a Dusyanta, or some youthful students in the hermitages itself. Besides they had the necessity of guarding their gardens and fields from the ravage of wild beasts ; the hermits had also the need to protect their hermitages from the molestation of aboriginal tribes. With a view to prevent their own people from falling a prey to temptations they devised a religious oriminal code enumerat- ing sins and Prãyaácittas or punishments for them. In order to proteotthe forest from wild beasts and men, they had to call in the aid, of their king. In return for the aid, they paid the king one sixth of the grains gleaned by them from harvested fields, or in the absence of such grains they made a gift of one sixth of the merit of their penance to the protective sovereign. In consideration of the prayer and penance made by the hermits for the prosperity of the king, he had to protect them from hunger, cold and heat also, besides granting them free of tax as much land as they needed. Apart from oivil and criminal laws administered in duly constituted courts, the Brähmans had their own rligious code of laws treating of orimes and of atonements for them. The</page><page sequence="31">A Peep into Ancient Indian Sociology 231 crimes coming under the cognisance of this code are all called pâtakas or sins and classified according to the gravity of the offences. Most of the crimes coming under pâtakas have been duly noticed and dealt with in the civil and criminal codes administered in the king's court. The pâtakas are murder, adultery, theft, kidnapping of women, killing of animals and lying, defamation, and assault and hurt. Drinking of liquor, non-payment of debts, studying bad books, dancing, neglecting the daily study of the Vedas, eating forbidden food, casting off one's teacher, mother, father, and son, earning money or sub- sistence by forbidden professions, and the like, are regarded as religious crimes deserving of prayascitta or atonement. The reason for the prescription of präyas'cifctas or penances for secular crimes seems to have been two-fold. First, the intention of the Vãnaprastha seems to have been to have their own code of laws in virtue of their social, religious and politi- cal independence. Secondly they seem to have thought of making the hermitage a kind of reformatory school to reform or to reclaim juveniles from their evil courses. This view is corroborated by what Vasistha says ( XXI. 3 ) regarding the classess of criminals and their chastisers. He says : - " The teacher is the punisher of such sinners as are tractable ; the king is the punisher of the wicked ; and Vaivasvata Yama, the god of death, is the punisher of those who hide their evil deeds." Gautama lays down a peculiar form of punishment in order to reclaim juvenile offenders. In XII. 24, he says that whenever a man continues to abstain from doing what is enjoined or in pursuing what is forbidden, he is to be deprived of whatever he possesses over and above a piece of cloth and a few morsels of food necessary to sustain his life. This punish- ment is in addition to the präyascitta or atonement laid down for his sin. " If this is done, " says Maskarin, the commentator, " he will abandon his wicked proceeding. According to the propensities and wicked habits of the individual either religious punishment alone or legal punishment alone or both have to be meted out. " With a view to facilitate the determination of equivalents of religious punishments or prãyaácittas in terms of money fines, the commentator quotes under Gautama XXI. 20 from Lokäksi who says that what is oalled a Prãjãpatya Prâyaácitfca is equivalent to a fine of thirty three panas ; a sãmtapana is equal to 100? panas ; and</page><page sequence="32">232 Armais of the Shandarkar Oriento! Research Institute Atikrcchra is equal to 467 panas; a Kroohrãtikrcchra is equal to 500 panas. And a Parãka is also equivalent to a fine of 500 panas. As a general rule, the sütras and smrtis exempt Brãhmans from corporal punishment and servitude. In serious crimes, they were branded with marks indicative of the crimes committed and excommunicated. Admonition and rebuke together with money-fines were all the punishment they received from the king's court. But the prãyaácitta or penances they had to go through were not less severe. Nor can it be denied that imprisonment is preferable to the observance of Krcchras and Cãndrãyanas. Hence there is no reason to believe that among the ancient Indians the Brãhmans formed a favoured olass and that the rights and privileges they secured at the hands of ancient kings were more than they deserved. It is in honour of their highly intellectual and spiritual life that such rights and privileges were conferrd upon them. The monumental, literary, religious and phi- losophical works which they have left behind are an unfailing testimony to their high intellect and spiritual earnestness. It is in those works that the glory of ancient Indian civilization is still alive. But for them, India would have been deolared a country of savages. Considering their excellent literary, religious and philosophical works one would not hesitate to go so far as to say that the honour shown them by letting off their criminals without corporal punishment was a trifling reward for the lasting contribution they made to the glory of the country. Whether there were so many criminals and hypocrites among ancient Brãhmans is another important question that deserves consideration. The ancient Brãhmans formed not a rigid or isolated caste of themselves. By the process of elevation and degradation their class was periodically increasing or decreasing in volume. So the privileges were rather functional than a birth-right. They were open to all people irrespective of their birth. By degrad- ing their kinsman for their incapacity to exercise the duties of the olass and by elevating peopie of other classes in virtue of their fitness to live the life of a true Brahman, the class seems to have been maintained in its ideal purity. As in other nations, so in anoient India, the penal code was very severe and was therefore deterrent of crimes. No less deterrent of pätakas was the code of religious punishments, and it is more</page><page sequence="33">A Peep into Ancient Indian Sociology 233 than probable that it gave no room for miscarriage of justice. What now appears as an undue partiality shown to the Brah- man oaste was really a kind of premium paid for intellectual and spiritual life of a class which was recruiting its members from all classes. Thus the prerogative of the Brahman class to have the law of punishing its criminals in its own hands points to its being a political institution independent of the king. This is corroborated by the following passage of the Yajurveda ( 1. 8, 10 ) in which the independence of the Brãhmans is clear- ly stated : - " Esa vo Bharata räjä, somo' smäkam räjä." " This is your king, O Bharatas; Soma is the king of us, the Brãhmans." Dr. A.. B. Keith remarks on the passage as follows : - " The important feature of the whole is the fact that the king is sharply distinguished from the priests. The proclamation ( the above passage ) tells the people that so and so is their king ; but the Brãhmans add that their king is Soma. This distinction shows that for Vedic India at least the connection of royalty with priestly rank, if it ever had been a motive of the growth of the kingship, had long disappeared before the time of the Samhitäs." Whatever might be the duration of the dependence of the priestly class and its motive, it is a fact that the ancient Brãhmans formed a class of people noted for its intellectual and spiritual life and that it enjoyed in full measure its freedom of thought, speech, and action in social, religious and political matters. This is confirmed by what Gautama says in his Dharma Sutra ( XI. 1 ) : - The king is master of all except Bräimians. We shall see, in connection with Višvajit sacrifice to be discussed in our third lecture on ancient Indian Economios, how the Mlmãmsakas denied the king his right over any person whether a freeman or a slave. Thus it is clear that from the Yedio down to the Sutra period ancient Indian society was divided into two political units the Fauras (citizens ), and the Vãnaprasthas (the hermits). The latter was ever growing in its bulk by the arrival into the hermitage of old and young people from cities either for learn- 5</page><page sequence="34">234 Annoia of the Bhandarkar Oriental Ěesearch Institute ing or for preparation for the journey to the next world. Its life was intellectual and spiritual and held gold and luxury in utter contempt. The charms of this world has no attraction for it. The dialogue of Pautrayana and Baikva narrated in the Chãndogya Upanisad goes to show the utter contempt with which wealth was looked upon by the hermits. Corresponding to the Samiti or political assembly of the king the hermits had their own assembly called Parisad in which social, religious and political problems awaiting solution were discussed and decided.</page></plain_text>
