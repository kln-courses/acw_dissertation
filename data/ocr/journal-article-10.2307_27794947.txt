<plain_text><page sequence="1">Robert Giuffrida, Jr. The Philosophical Thought of Chauncey Wright: Edward Madden's Contribution to Wright Scholarship Chauncey Wright (1830-1875) was for many decades the "forgotten American philosopher." Because of his preference for the Socratic method of philosophizing over sustained written exposition, the origi nality of his ideas, his influence on other thinkers, and the high regard in which friend and foe alike held his philosophical ability failed to result in the degree or kind of scholarly attention his thought merited. The fact that we are now able to make a fair and accurate assessment of Wright's views, and of his place in the history of philosophy, is due largely to Edward Madden, whose work on Wright is the focus of this article. In the seventy-five years after Wright's death, certain broad features of his views were noted correctly - that he was an empiricist and "positivist," and held a utilitarian ethics, in all of which he was greatly influenced by John Stuart Mill; that he was a staunch defender of Darwinism both against those who denied its truth and those who sought to overextend its central ideas; and that he was a sceptic con cerning statements unsupported by empirical evidence, religious doc trines in particular, and an opponent of dogmatism of any type. Apart from these general assessments, however, more often than not his genuine contributions were overlooked, while ideas of later philoso phers were wrongly attributed to him. To understand the state of Wright scholarship before Madden's work, we must examine what various of the earlier commentators had to say about Wright. I Of Wright's contemporaries who wrote about him after his death, three were favorably disposed to central features of his views ? Charles Eliot Norton, Ephraim W. Gurney and Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.,</page><page sequence="2">34 Robert Giuffrida, Jr. while three held sharply differing philosophical outlooks - William James, John Fiske, and Bord?n Parker Bowne. Norton, a long time friend of Wright's and editor of his collected essays, stated Wright believed that "[t]he methods of all true knowl edge [were] the methods of induction from the facts of particular observation,"1 this being both the essence of his "positivism" and the basis of his denial of necessary connections between matters of fact. Norton described Wright's scepticism as a . . . temper in which the unknown remains matter of inquiry, not of dogmatism, and to which the unknowable, or that which lies plainly outside the range of human faculties, is of no concern save as a matter of sentiment.2 He added that Wright himself suspended judgment on all questions concerning which sufficient evidence was lacking, thus recognizing his distinction between "open" and "closed" questions and his position on the ethics of belief. Gurney, a friend from Wright's youth, described Wright's philosophy in a letter to James B. Thayer, editor of Wright's correspondence. Gurney wrote, Experience of phenomena gave both the content and the form of knowledge; the ground and the sanction of moral judgments; the limits of the universe in its intelligible, credible relations with man.^ Gurney qualified this in explaining Wright's distinction between the realms of faith and knowledge: Upon his chart of the Universe, the terra incognita of the not-proven that stretched between the firm ground of the proved and the void of the disproved, included some of [mankind's] chief beliefs . . . . [H]e admitted the entire rightfulness of the claim of Faith to take possession of any portion of this territory, provided she did it in her own</page><page sequence="3">Edward Madden on Chauncey Wright 35 name: there might even be much solid and goodly land there, and not mere mirage of tradition and the emotions; he denied only that it lay within the range of man's ex perience, and therefore of knowledge . . . .4 Gurney would have been more accurate had he stated that Wright regarded religious and metaphysical doctrines as not-prov#&amp;/e, but he grasped the essential features of Wright's positivism here. Holmes' remarks on Wright are scattered throughout his corre spondence. In a letter to Sir Frederick Pollock he wrote: Chauncey Wright, a nearly forgotten philosopher of real merit, taught me when young that I must not say necessary about the universe, that we don't know whether anything is necessary or not. So I describe myself as a &amp;?iabilitarian. I believe that we can bet on the behavior of the universe in its contact with us.^ Describing with assent another important aspect of Wright's thought, he wrote in a letter to Harold J. Laski: I don't know that causes produce equivalent effects ? or whether the cosmos is merely having a transitory whim of orderly sequence, but discoveries are made on the assumptions of continuity &amp;c. Chauncey Wright long ago pointed out to me the impossibility of assuming necessity as an ultimate cosmic fact.6 Holmes counted himself among those accepting Wright's sceptical, scientific approach to inquiry, and on numerous occasions acknowl edged his indebtedness to Wright for these broad features of his own philosophical outlook.7 Fiske had good reason to criticize Wright harshly, as Wright had done Fiske's mentor, Herbert Spencer, but instead tried as far as possible to reconcile Wright's and Spencer's views. He noted Wright's "harmony with Mr. Mill in methods and conclusions," while differing</page><page sequence="4">36 Robert Giuffrida, Jr. in temperament from him,8 and attributed much of Wright's philo sophical outlook to his temperament: In his freedom from . . . extra-rational solicitation, Mr. Wright realized the ideal of the positive philosopher. His positivism was an affair of temperament as well as of conviction.9 Noting Wright's acceptance of the universality of causation, and his opposition to teleology (in which he had to admit a difference with Spencer), Fiske summarized, [Wright] was born a positivist and needed no lessons from Comte .... He went as far as it was possible for a human thinker to go toward a philosophy which should take no note of anything beyond the content of observed facts.10 Bowne, a personalistic idealist, attempted to reveal as many un justified assumptions and inconsistencies in Wright's views as possible. He denigrated Wright's work as mostly critical rather than constructive, but praised him for "clearly see [ing] through and . . . justly judg[ing] Herbert Spencer."11 He cited J. S. Mill and Darwin as the main influences on Wright, but in connection with the former, claimed "Mr. Wright has done nothing for empiricism. The crucial difficulties of that philosophy are almost entirely passed by . . . ."12 He referred in particular to Wright's "assumptions," unjustified on empirical grounds, of an external world, the eternality and directionlessness of the universe, the uniformity of nature, and the basic empiricist tenet that "there are no truths not gathered from experience."1^ He thought Wright mistaken in not recognizing Spencer's idea of hereditary race-experience as the "salvation of empiricism, . . . constituting] its chief capital at present,"14 thus demonstrating his own misunder standing of Wright's criticism of Spencer, which he had nonetheless praised. James described Wright as "a worker on the path opened by Hume," and added that "a treatise on psychology written by him would have</page><page sequence="5">Edward Madden on Chauncey Wright 37 brought the work of Mill and Bain for the present to a conclusion. James noted Wright's doctrine of "cosmic weather," and Wright's extension of this idea to the totality of being: [H] e preferred to think of phenomena as the result of a sort of ontologie weather, without inward rationality, an aimless drifting to and fro, from the midst of which relatively stable and so (for us) rational combinations may emerge.16 While James intensely opposed this aspect of Wright's empiricism, he did note the one doctrinal area in which he agreed with Wright: He particularly condemned the idea of substance as a metaphysical idol . . . [arguing] that there is no need of a glue to join things unless we apprehend some reason why they should fall asunder.17 Finally, James described Wright's scepticism as a lack of emotional bias which left him contented with the mere principle of parsimony as a criterion of uni versal truth . . . [holding] it pure excess and superstition to speak of a metaphysical whence or whither, of a sub stance, a meaning or an end.18 James thus noted the same temperamental component of Wright's philosophy as had Norton and Fiske, though with much less sympathy. II Over forty years passed before Wright again received scholarly attention. Morris Cohen was Wright's first 20th century commentator, and he was also the first of many who interpreted Wright as an early pragmatist: Anticipating the instrumentalism of Dewey, as well as the pragmatism of James, Wright pointed out that the</page><page sequence="6">38 Robert Giuffrida, Jr. principles of modern mathematical and physical philosophy are rather the eyes with which nature is seen than the elements and constitution of the objects discovered, that general laws are finders, not merely summaries of truth.19 Cohen added that Wright's view . . . led Peirce to formulate the general maxim of Pragma tism that the meaning of any concept is to be found in 'all the conceivable experimental phenomena which the affirmation or denial of a concept would imply.'20 Cohen further asserted that Wright's doctrine of "cosmic weather" was similar to, and influenced, Peirce's and James' doctrine of tychism, which held that there are uncaused, and therefore truly novel events.21 He went on to note Wright's opposition to metaphysical thinking, teleology in particular, and Wright's painstaking demarcation of the realms of science (knowledge) and religion (faith), as well as his belief in the universality of causation.22 Harvey Townsend addressed Wright's philosophy in the mid-1930's, in a book and an article. He focused on Wright's long essay, "The Evolution of Self-Consciousness," and like Cohen, saw Wright as an early pragmatist, attributing to him a theory of signs similar to Peirce's and an instrumental conception of mind like Dewey's.2^ He remarked that Wright accepted the universality of causation, and was not, there fore, a nominalist on this issue.24 Gail Kennedy, also writing at this time, went into more detail concerning the relation of Wright's thought to subsequent pragmatic theories. Noting that Wright's "forward-looking" orientation with regard to the abstract principles of natural science was a departure from classical empiricism* Kennedy allied himself with Cohen, arguing that "Wright was leading toward a pragmatic conception of experi ence," and that his view was "the starting point of Peirce's pragma tism;"2^ "The Evolution of Self-Consciousness," according to Kennedy, contained "a doctrine interestingly akin to what James later called 'Pure Experience'," while Wright's hypothesis of "cosmic weather"</page><page sequence="7">Edward Madden on Chauncey Wright 39 revealed a "conception of the relation between law and accident that is reflected in the tychism of Peirce and James."26 As well, Kennedy noted Wright's opposition to metaphysics, including teleology of any kind, but cautioned that Wright intended to exclude metaphysical problems only from the realm of knowledge, and not from philo sophical discussion altogether. Ralph Barton Perry, in The Thought and Character of William James, remarked a "pervasive and lingering influence, both of thought and expression" by Wright on James.27 In particular, "The Evolution of Self-Consciousness" influenced James' view of the origin and bio logical role of thought, including as it did the notion of 'skipped intermediaries' in trains of associ ation; the notion that experience is neither physical nor mental, but 'neutral;' and a characteristic emphasis on the process of thought, with reference to intention, signs and language.28 Perry further claimed that, regarding pragmatism, "James and Peirce were no doubt both of them confirmed in this tendency by the posi tivism of Chauncey Wright."29 Sidney Ratner at this time called Wright "the foremost philosophic exponent of evolution in the U.S. and the founder of rational natural ism j pragmatism and pluralism."30 Ratner gave no explanation of which of Wright's views he believed fell under these headings, and his other remarks were equally general: that Wright "did not mytholo gize evolution," that he did not "[deny] the insights that established views had," and that he was "convinced that most if not all meta physical puzzles were based on ambiguous terms."*51 Paul Anderson, the next to assess Wright's place in American philosophy, called him a "transitional figure" who "opened the way for the development of radical empiricism and naturalism without defining their boundaries or expanding their implications."32 In this connection, Anderson cited in particular Wright's forward looking empiricism^ and his neutral monism in "The Evolution of Self-Consciousness."33 Anderson criticized Wright's positivism (which he differentiated from</page><page sequence="8">40 Robert Giuffrida, Jr. Comte's) for its lack of clarity on the relation of science to philosophy: sometimes Wright would use philosophy to criticize scientific method, while at other times he would use science to derive philosophical doctrines.34 He qualified Wright's opposition to teleology, saying it admitted Aristotelian potentiality, and noted Wright's agnosticism on religious questions, and his view of the role of linguistic confusion in metaphysical problems.3^ While asserting Wright's belief in the universality of causation, however, he called the doctrine of "cosmic weather" a "tychistic emphasis . . .[which] was perhaps the basis for the more developed tychism of Peirce and James. Philip Wiener provided the most thorough examination of Wright's philosophy prior to Madden's work, in two articles and a book pub lished between 1945 and 1950.37 Wiener's interpretation was original in arguing that "Wright's view of the neutrality of science with regard to metaphysics, religion and ethics is the key idea of his philoso phy."38 Wiener added that "Wright's neutral positivism wasn't anti metaphysical (like Mach and Stallo), but non-metaphysical . . . ," and that Wright did not hold "a scornful indifference or blanket scepticism with regard to traditional moral, theological and metaphysical ques tions."39 Although Wiener regarded Wright as a "founder of pragmatism," he was more careful than previous commentators to qualify the senses in which he meant this, and criticized the others for their looseness in this regard.40 Wiener felt that Wright was close to Peirce in defining an idea as the sum of its consequences in experience, and claimed that "Peirce and James, under the influence of Chauncey Wright, insisted that pragmatism would clarify metaphysical disputes about the meaning of ideas."41 He did state, however, that "Wright never formulated any principle as formal as Peirce's pragmatism, and he vigorously attacked James' Will to Believe."42 As well, he did not impute tychism to Wright: "His apt expression for . . . empirical diversity, 'cosmic weather,' did not imply any inherent ontological indeterminate ness. . . ."43 Wiener asserted that Wright's belief in the universality of causation, even though held in a nominalistic sense, was incom patible with tychism.44 On other issues, Wiener called Wright a "logical relativist" on truth, an associationist in psychology, and a strong opponent of teleology.4^</page><page sequence="9">Edward Madden on Chauncey Wrigh t 41 He concluded that Wright's "chief deficiency was his failure to extend his naturalism to ethics, which he left to autonomous feelings," and that Wright's current significance was in the area of methodology.46 Herbert Schneider, also writing at this time, saw a different focus to Wright's work. [Wright's] doctrine was but the reassertion of the basic principle of empiricism, with the emphasis shifted from the problem of the origin of ideas to the problem of the verification of ideas. Wright made a more substantial advance over traditional empiricism . . . when he raised the question of the concrete utility of the distinction be tween subject and object . . . Here is a new radical empiri cism? clearly formulated. . . .47 The second point in this passage referred to Wright's neutral monism in "The Evolution of Self-Consciousness," but surprisingly, Schneider never asserted a resemblance between this doctrine and James' Pure Experience. He did, however, impute an instrumental conception of mind to Wright when he described this essay as formulating "a new science of mind, a new teleology," under Darwin's influence.48 It seems clear also that Schneider intended to attribute a verificationist approach to meaning to Wright, though he claimed this to be a less significant aspect of Wright's thought than his "radical empiricism," and noted that Wright admitted the validity of metaphysical specu lation from a practical point of view.49 Joseph Blau described Wright's views in an article appearing in 1946, and in a chapter of a book appearing in 1952. In the article, Blau described Wright's articles generally as containing "a rigid empiri cism and a strict exclusion of teleology."50 He characterized Wright's "cosmic weather" as representing a "Lucretian fortuitousness in the universe,"51 thus assimilating it to tychism, but apart from this, he dealt primarily with Wright's views on religion and morality. He noted Wright's opposition to transcendentalism, particularly the concept of an "immanent, anthropomorphic deity," and that for Wright, "morality and religion were contiguous rather than identical."52</page><page sequence="10">42 Robert Giuffrida, Jr. Concerning Wright's utilitarianism, Blau wrote: The parenthetic observation that 'the test of conduct is fundamentally the warrant of it' [is] clearly Wright's statement of the 'pragmatic test' applied to morality. . . .53 In the book, Blau reiterated most of the points in the article, but gave principal attention to Wright's theory of self-consciousness, which he regarded as the most important aspect of Wright's thought. Wright believed, Blau wrote, that "the outcome can differ only in degree, not in kind, from its source," and applied this idea to the problem of the development of human consciousness by means of his concept of "new uses for old powers. "^4 Blau argued that for Wright, mental phenomena are just as much part of, and generated within, the natural order as are physical phenomena, a position making him "one of the thinkers whose activity was central to the development of evolutionary naturalism in America."55 In this connection, Blau cited Wright's view that even our most important distinctions ? between instinct and intelligence, organic and inorganic, and even between subject and object ? are merely rough classifications for some momentary or special purpose when we turn to the sort of dynamic and func tional analysis to which we are led by the evolutionary mode of thought. 5i&gt; Wright's treatment of the last distinction was of special significance, according to Blau, because it implied a novel conception of mind as an active process rather than as a substance distinct from body.57 It will be useful at this point to summarize the views on Wright expressed by the commentators just discussed. All of them correctly noted the basic features of his philosophical outlook as I described them at the beginning of this article. While there was no tendency among his contemporaries to see him as an early pragmatist, starting with Cohen this interpretation came to predominate: Cohen, Kennedy, Perry, Ratner, Anderson, Wiener, Schneider, and (to a lesser extent)</page><page sequence="11">Edward Madden on Chauncey Wright 43 Blau, all saw in Wright an undeveloped pragmatic and/or verificationist theory of meaning. Smaller groups of his commentators attributed to Wright some form of tychism (Cohen, Kennedy, Anderson, Blau), a metaphysics similar to James* Pure Experience doctrine (Kennedy, Perry, Anderson, Wiener), and/or an instrumental theory of mind (Cohen, Townsend, Perry, Schneider, Blau). Varying positions were taken concerning Wright's psychology, his ethics, and his Humean view of causation. Madden addressed all of these issues in his work on Wright, shedding considerable light on areas of confusion and dis agreement, as I shall now show. Ill Beginning in 1952, Madden published a series of articles on Wright which culminated in his book, Chauncey Wright and the Foundations of Pragmatism, published in 1963.58 All of the important interpreta tions of Wright's views contained in the articles were carried over into the book, so it is the latter to which I will refer primarily. I will have occasion to refer, also, to Madden's Chauncey Wright, which presented his views on Wright in a more popular style, to his two chapters on Wright in Civil Disobedience and Moral Law in Nineteenth Century American Philosophy,^ and to several articles Madden wrote on Wright after the appearance of Chauncey Wright and the Foundations of Pragmatism. Madden's work gave the most thorough and accurate account to date of virtually every aspect of Wright's philosophical views, as well as of his life and character. Madden's assessment of the relative central ity of the various aspects of Wright's philosophical views is of particular significance in providing a correct understanding of Wright's thought, and so I will begin with the focal point of Madden's presentation, Wright's empiricism or "positivism." At the conclusion, Wright will have emerged as a coherent thinker on a broad range of important philosophical questions, albeit with some inconsistencies that come to light from a contemporary perspective. Madden characterized Wright as "America's first technical philoso pher of science,"60 claiming that as such, he made his two most im portant contributions to philosophy. First, Wright's empiricism shifted</page><page sequence="12">44 Robert Giuffrida, Jr. away from classical empiricism's reference to the origins of ideas, or "summary" view of meaning and knowledge, toward modern empiri cism's reference to the future experiential consequences of ideas, or "verification" view.**1 Second, Wright argued with great force for the principle of the metaphysical neutrality of science, and Madden expressed approval of Wiener's judgment of the centrality of this principle to Wright's philosophy as a whole.^2 These views, and others Madden described, are closely interrelated, and I will associate them in referring to Wright's "positivism," although Madden did not apply the latter term in precisely this way to Wright. Madden emended and qualified the work of previous commentators most significantly on the important questions of whether and to what extent Wright's positivism prefigured pragmatism. He wrote: [0]ne cannot say that Wright founded any pragmatic epistemology . . . , [rather,] Wright's arguments . . . pro vide [d] the logic of scientific thought which later philoso phers did generalize into pragmatic epistemologies.63 Wright had developed his forward-looking empiricism, Madden pointed out, in the context of his analysis of the logical structure of scientific concepts. He had declared the abstract principles of science to be "finders, not merely summaries of truth," which very often have "material utility," and which must be at least indirectly verifiable by the senses to be "admitted into scientific researches."^4 Madden pointed out numerous ways in which Wright's treatment of scientific propositions differed from pragmatic theories of meaning. First, Wright spoke only of "verifying transcendental or ideal notions or theories, whereas the pragmatists . . . include [d] simple empirical sentences as well." This difference is paralleled on the issue of a mean ing criterion for single terms, with Wright accepting the "self containedness of the sensuous given" (the denotative definability of simple sensory terms), while certain pragmatists (Peirce, Dewey) denied this. Second, James and Peirce sometimes formulated the pragmatic view as a criterion of synonymity of meaning, which Wright never did. Third, pragmatism^ emphasis on the manipulation that</page><page sequence="13">Edward Madden on Chauncey Wright 45 intervenes between thought and verification was completely absent in Wright. Fourth, Wright adhered strictly to a correspondence theory of truth, regarding "utility" as merely a test or criterion of truth, avoiding the ambiguity by which the pragmatiste sometimes gave "utility" as the definition of truth, while at others treating it as Wright did. Finally, Wright was antagonistic to Peirce's entire cosmology: Evolutionary development is central in Peirce's thought; indeed, his tychism is only a vehicle for the journey to synechism . . . the notion that systematic process laws themselves are a function of time .... [This] is incompat ible entirely with Wright's ateleology; for him, any evolu tion with ultimate progress or even directionality is a perversion of biological evolution .... 65 Madden also clearly rejected the view that Wright espoused some variant of tychism, and went on to give a much more detailed discus sion of Wright's views on causality than had anyone previously. Wright believed what Peirce later denied, that the universal ity of causality is a postulate of scientific inquiry .... Wright interpret [ed] irregularity as a function of causal complexity; irregularity indicates not an abridgement of causality but only an abridgement of our knowledge of it. Peirce, on the other hand, interpreted irregularity . . . [as due to] absolute chance .... 66 Wright's concept of "cosmical weather," Madden stated, had no refer ence to causality at all, but only to phenomena's "lack of discernible tendencies on the whole, which he thought was the drift of the logic of science."67 Wright's theory of causality, Madden showed, was substantially the same as J. S. Mill's. Wright accepted Mill's definition of physical objects as "permanent possibilities of sensation," with its implication that statements about physical objects will support counterfactual inferences, which provided the basis for the distinction they both made</page><page sequence="14">46 Robert Giuffrida, Jr. between accidental and lawful correlations.68 Both men rejected entailment views of causality, and used the (supposedly) empirical notion of ?&lt;unconditionality,, to make this distinction.69 Troubled by the seeming incompatibility between Wright's desire for a purely empirical account of causality and his use of concepts of counter factual inference and potentiality, Madden left the issue open pending the resolution of the ongoing dispute between Humeans and non Humeans over the possibility of formulating a definition of "cause" within the framework of Principia Mathematica which would allow the use of these concepts. It is now clear that, given Madden's current non-Humean view of causality, he would deny that Wright could ever be successful in finding a positivistic surrogate for lawful or nomic universale.70 While holding that Wright's treatment of scientific concepts did not constitute an early version of pragmatic theories of meaning, Madden did assert that it represented an early verification criterion of meaning.71 He further argued that, while undeveloped in form, Wright's verification criterio! for scientific concepts was identical in substance with the notion of "system meaning" formulated by Albert Einstein and subsequently accepted by the verificationists. This notion allowed a concept not itself directly verifiable to be empirically mean ingful as part of a system of concepts testable as a whole in experi ence.72 Madden cautioned, however, that Wright's verification cri terion was very restricted in scope: [it] remain [ed] within a scientific framework and never extend [ed] to thought in general; he did not have a general 'theory' of mind, meaning or truth.73 All the same, Madden stated, Wright shared the general approach of 19th century positivism toward metaphysics, for example, classi fying as "closed questions" any "ontological knowledge of the super natural, ... a knowledge of anything existing by itself and independent ly of its effects on us . . . ."74 What Wright shared with the 19th century positivists - a programmatic elimination of metaphysics as meaningless - was an important component of his belief in the meta</page><page sequence="15">Edward Madden on Chauncey Wright 47 physical neutrality of science. Wright believed, as did Comte and Mill, that such concepts could be eliminated by "giv[ing] a genetic account of the occurrence of the allegedly irreducible ontological concept."75 Wright's peculiar twist to this was his use of Darwinian evolutionary explanations of the origins of metaphysical concepts. This is best illustrated by his treatment of the concept of "substance" (mental substance, in particular) in "The Evolution of Self-Consciousness." There he sought to show that the concept of powerful substances arose from the sentence structure of language, which in turn derived from the early uses to which language was put, and that self-conscious ness can be explained with reference to the development of faculties (memory, attention) already present in lower animals. Wright conclud ed from this that the subject-object distinction is no more than a classification within experience, from which thesis he was able to pass beyond Mill's phenomenalism to a neutral monism. Madden pointed out that this position was both highly original and similar in important respects to James' doctrine of "Pure Experience."76 Madden criticized Wright's use of genetic arguments in two ways. First, he concurred with Bowne that the origin of an idea has no logical bearing on its truth or falsity, a point upon which Wright had insisted with regard to scientific ideas.77 Second, after discussing another component of Wright's conception of the metaphysical neutrality of science ? the principle that natural science "is uncom mitted to any particular metaphysical or theological interpretation of its findings" - Madden criticized Wright for failing to hold that if scientific concepts and laws are true independently of any ontology, then this entails that no scientific fact in turn can establish any particular ontological contention.78 Interestingly, in the chapter "Agnosticism and the Will to Believe," Madden showed that Wright did not carry over his general elimination ist approach to metaphysics into the sphere of religion. Wright's approach to religious doctrines, Madden argued, derived from his concern that theology not limit scientific inquiry. Wright began with arguments to show that theological propositions are illegitimate as</page><page sequence="16">48 Robert Giuffrida, Jr. know ledge-claims, being indemonstrable either rationally or empiri cally, and concluded that from the theoretic point of view, suspension of judgment on these propositions is required.79 Madden wrote at some length on various aspects of Wright's phi losophy which previous commentators had treated incompletely or not at all. Most important among these was his utilitarian ethics, which, Madden explained, he embraced on the basis of the episte mologica! considerations which were central to his philosophy as a whole: Wright felt that moral judgments based on examination of consequences, unlike the deliverances of 'intuition' or 'conscience,' lend themselves to test and correction by common or 'public' experience .... 80 Wright followed J. S. Mill on the matter of qualitative distinctions among pleasures, arguing that esthetic pleasures, and some passions, have in the realm of ends-in-themselves an intrinsic dignity, a preferability in kind, distinct from other sources of pleasure.81 To prevent this position from collapsing into intuitionism, Madden showed, he made a further distinction between the intrinsic prefer ability of some pleasures and their moral ranking: [The former] are simply original or acquired preferences in experience, whereas moral value or rank is a derived property . . . reached by comparing [each pleasure] with those pleasures of one's own and others that might be sacrificed for it.82 Wright later gave his utilitarianism an evolutionary twist, and Madden acknowledged some validity to Peirce's criticism of this: Apparently Wright thought that . . . [t]he summary state ment of primary morals would be normative in form ....</page><page sequence="17">Edward Madden on Chauncey Wright 49 [However, t]he forms of human morality that actually have been naturally selected have been those producing the greatest numbers of the most prosperous individu als.... 83 This meant, ironically, that Wright implicitly equated "biologically and socially successful" with "happy" or "pleasurable," while Herbert Spencer did this explicitly. Madden took them both to task for "using scientific information for philosophical purposes, confusing the nature of what is with what ought to be . . . ,"84 This, of course, was precisely Wright's most telling criticism of Spencer's "synthetic philosophy" as a whole. Madden found unobjectionable, however, Wright's application of evolutionary ideas to the issue of traditional moral rules and habits: Wright was not only a second-order utilitarian . . . but he also stressed the great practical importance of acting from habit and instinct rather than by directly calculating the likely consequences in each specific context.85 This was Wright's defense against anti-utilitarian arguments that we lack adequate knowledge of consequences and time to weigh them when faced with moral choices, and was a departure from Bentham and both Mills. Wright did not abandon the reformist thrust of utili tarianism, Madden hastened to add, holding that utility is crucially important in practice as the standard for correcting a whole world of abuses, . . . [s] elf-sanctioned prejudices, time-sanctioned iniquities and religious ab surdities .... 86 Wright made a noteworthy contribution to the age old problem of reconciling moral responsibility with a deterministic universe, Madden claimed. Wright distinguished between external causes (heredity, early environment) and internal causes (reason, imagination), and argued, by means of his concept of novelty, that the operation of the latter represent self-determination:</page><page sequence="18">50 Robert Giuffrida, Jr. [For Wright], reasoning is emergent in respect to its causes; having been brought into existence, it allows one to con sider alternative acts unmolested by the 'must' aspect of lower causes. Reasoning, in short, once caused, is itself a new kind of cause.87 In conclusion, Madden criticized Wright for failing to defend the principle of utility itself. Although Wright's friend Thayer had made penetrating criticisms of Mill's proof of the greatest happiness principle, "Wright nowhere in his letters or essays even considers the general question of justifying the principle of utility."88 He attributed this omission to Wright's belief in the impossibility of arguing directly for any philosophical position, with explanatory power and consistency his criteria for choosing among competing theories. Wright had extended his ethical reasonings to the areas of social and political philosophy as well, though this received almost no men tion from Wright's previous commentators. Madden assimilated Wright's theoretical position to that of the Oberlinites and George William Curtis, a position midway between Mill's reformist liberalism and Emerson's passivity. Concerning social planning guided by utili tarian principles, Wright felt that any such attempts must be confined to removing known causes of unhappiness, rather than extending to providing the conditions of happiness, since we are all likely to be unhappy under similar con ditions of deprivation but not likely to be happy under the same apparently beneficent conditions.89 Madden illustrated Wright's social/political thought by presenting his views on the status of women and the distribution of property. Wright favored legal and political equality for women on the utili tarian ground that liberty is only to be restricted when security con siderations necessitate. Wright subsumed the advocacy of women's rights under the advocacy of individual rights, and opposed any exten sion of "rights" that was in reality an extension of power over indi viduals.9^ Concerning private property, Wright departed from Mill's</page><page sequence="19">Edward Madden on Chauncey Wright 51 position that it has intrinsic value, arguing that "The utilitarian . . . jus tifications are entirely instrumental."91 Wright admitted that private property is necessary to social stability, but believed that it had become so concentrated as to cease increasing the well-being of the many, and so needed to be restricted on utilitarian grounds.92 To complete this summary of Madden's presentation of Wright's philosophical views, I must take up several technical issues on which Wright expressed himself: the nature of spatial relations, a priori knowledge and space, the structure of self-consciousness, scepticism vs. common sense and Hamilton's Law of the Conditioned. Madden said Wright developed his view of spatial relations in refuting both the view that spatial relations are introspectively reduci ble to non-relational elements, and the view that a metaphysical self acts to supply spatial relations. The latter position was defended by Wright's friend F. E. Abbott, in a lengthy correspondence with whom Wright explained his own position, which was to admit relations on an equal footing with properties . . . [as] introspectively unanalyzable [and] as 'immediately perceived' as properties themselves .... 93 Madden called attention both to the originality of Wright's view ? only Thomas Brown, about whom Wright knew little or nothing, preceded him in regarding spatial relations in this manner - and to the way it reinforced empiricism in one of its weakest areas: James Mill, for example, had held the feeble position that perceiving objects is the same as perceiving objects and their relations. In the context of debating this issue, Wright engaged in what Madden termed a novel "rear-guard action" on the subject of a priori knowledge. Against Abbott's metaphysical a priori, Wright proposed a "functional a priori " asserting that in the perception both of proper ties and relations, the mind classifies the present sensory intuition by comparing it with past ones stored in memory. Perception both of properties and relations thus involves an a priori contribution of the intellect, deriving either from the individual's own experience or from associations "original to the mind."94</page><page sequence="20">52 Robert Giuffrida, Jr. Madden saw Wright's conception of space as flowing from his conception of spatial relations: Empirically ... the notion of space arises by the per ception of spatial relations. We must . . . assume that space is continuous, that is, extends beyond our perceptual apprehension.95 For Wright, "space is continuous" was a positive cognition, while the concept of space itself was an abstraction of the highest order: 'Space' ... is the cognition of the ultimate difference in phenomena ? that difference which exists between all phenomena as plural, no matter how great the resemblances.96 Wright believed that the related question of whether space is bounded or infinite is a metaphysical, and therefore closed question, one of no import to science.97 While appraising Wright's notion of space as a thoughtful contribution to the discussion in his time, Madden criticized it first, for its treatment of the continuity of space as a scientific hypothesis, and second, for its inadequacy, in light of relativity theory, on the question of space's boundedness. Madden gave an extensive description of Wright's "psychozoology," his investigations into the transition from animal to human intelligence. Wright distinguished sign usage in lower animals from that in man in terms of enthymemetic as opposed to scientific reasoning: in the latter, unlike the former, universale and major premisses are present to consciousness. The increasing development of memory and atten tion, faculties useful in their own right, gradually allowed in certain animals simultaneous attention both to internal and external signs, thus generating the awareness of "self," the individual's flow of thought, as distinct from outward perceptions. This awareness was reinforced and developed by language use until the distinctively human form of consciousness emerged, something continuous with previously existing consciousness, yet radically different from it.98</page><page sequence="21">Edward Madden on Chauncey Wright 53 Madden noted several important results of this theory, the first being Wright's neutral monism, mentioned earlier. Of equal significance was the fundamental restructuring of psychological investigation Wright carried out under Darwin's influence. Wright made a significant contribution to the general movement of psychology away from single variable/syndrome law descriptions toward two-variable/process-law descriptions: Wright's stimulus-response orientation becomes all the more significant if we note that at the same time he was developing his psychozoological principles the associa tionists . . . and the Wundtians were engaged in building their psychologies in terms of a single variable, mental contents .... 99 Wright's approach attained its full development in the work of James, Dewey and the American functionalists; however, Madden was careful to note, Wright's psychology lacked both James' teleological concep tion of essence and Dewey's assertion of a teleological relationship between stimulus and response.100 In Wright's thought on the relation between common-sense truths and philosophical theories Madden found a surprisingly modern view: First, ordinary knowledge must be explained or inter preted by any philosophical system . . . but such knowl edge does not itself constitute a resolution or dissolution of any philosophical problem. Second . . . Wright [made] the important distinction between believing a proposition to be true . . . and knowing fully what that proposition means .... 101 Madden expressed his approval of these theses, which he regarded as essential parts of Wright's metaphilosophy, a view which never denied the truth of any common-sense proposition, but only sought its proper analysis. Madden's treatment of Wright's discussion of Sir William Hamilton consisted of detailed analysis of the latter's Law of the Conditioned,</page><page sequence="22">54 Robert Giuffrida, Jr. Abbott's (and later, Mill's) criticisms of it, and Wright's rebuttal of those criticisms. Hamilton's Law, briefly stated, was that all of our positive knowledge lies between polar opposite statements, or "incon ditionates," such as "space is bounded" and "space is infinite," neither of which can be conceived as possible, but one, and only one, of which must, by the laws of thought, be true. Madden showed how Wright's more consistent (than Abbott's) use of the distinction between rational and sensuous concepts, and his elucidation of Hamilton's conception of the "mean" as a psychological rather than a logical concept, blunted much of Abbott's and Mill's attack on Hamilton. However, Madden charged Wright with himself failing to grasp what Hamilton meant by "knowledge" - that anything properly so called must have a signifi cant negation - when Wright argued that we at least "know" that the laws of thought apply to the inconditionates.102 I must not omit, finally, the thorough personal background and assessment of Wright's character that Madden presented. Wright's early brilliance in mathematics, his youthful exposure to evolutionary ideas, his inability to focus his energies on any task not genuinely interesting to him, his mood swings as well as his personal warmth and charm, together with the specific intellectual influences on him, Madden welded into a complete and appealing portrait of Wright, the man and philosopher, a portrait not presented by any of Wright's previous commentators.103 As is readily apparent, Madden's treatment of Wright differed on many points from those of previous writers. First, Madden showed that Wright's positivism did not include any general theory of meaning. With the exception of a verification view of scientific concepts, Madden asserted, Wright provided only a general "forward-looking" orientation to empiricism. Madden thoroughly rejected the idea that Wright accepted tychism, and left open the evaluation of the consistency with which he held to the universality of causation. Wright's neutral monism, Madden said, was an important advance on phenomenalism, and resembled in broad outline James' later doctrine of Pure Experi ence. In discussing Wright's work on self-consciousness, Madden was the only writer who recognized Wright's contribution to the develop ment of the structure of psychological theories. Finally, Madden</page><page sequence="23">Edward Madden on Chauncey Wright 55 brought to light Wright's position on issues such as the nature of spatial relations and space, the relation between common-sense and philosophy, and others, which had received little or no mention in previous work on Wright. IV Chauncey Wright and the Foundations of Pragmatism received numerous reviews, all speaking highly of it, though often reflecting their authors' differing interpretations and assessments of Wright. W. H. F. Barnes, for example, recited with no disagreement all of Madden's principal points, demurring only to claim that Madden found little of interest in Wright's ethics. He concluded, "here was a natural philosopher working on small canvases and thinking out the answers to a few problems quite independently."104 In contrast, John J. McDermott saw Madden's work refuting those who viewed the Golden Age of American philosophy as lacking breadth, and agreed with Madden that Wright's ethics was of some significance. He, too, accepted all of the main points of Madden's presentation of Wright.105 Review ing Madden's book from a standpoint unsympathetic to Wright's posi tivism were Wilbur Long and Jeanne Parain-Vial. In spite of this, both found only minor points on which to criticize Madden's presen tation.106 Herbert Schneider seemed to be moving away from his interpreta tion of Wright as a pragmatist and instrumentalist when he wrote in his review, The pragmatic strains in Wright's philosophical method were incidental to his primary interest in showing that sciences are metaphysically 'neutral'.107 However, he reclaimed some, at least, of his position when he added, "his influence on Peirce and James was direct and strong, both on their cosmological and methodological doctrines."108 Somewhat peculiarly, he saw Wright's primary achievement as having been the application of utilitarianism to Darwin's theory of natural selection, an aspect of Wright's thought which Madden and others characterized</page><page sequence="24">56 Robert Giuffrida, Jr. the other way around and criticized.109 Schneider clearly accepted most of Madden's view of Wright, however. J. J. Chambliss wrote an article in 1960 which referred to Madden's series of articles on Wright, and a lengthy review in 1964 of Chauncey Wright and the Foundations of Pragmatism. In the former, he drew out an aspect of Wright's thought not emphasized by Madden, the importance of the social nature of man, and its implications for Wright's evolutionary utilitarianism and his conception of thought in general. Chambliss wished to see Wright as an anticipator of Mead, and as holding an implicit instrumentalist theory of mind.110 He acknowledged, however, what Madden had insisted, that Wright con fined his "instrumentalism" to scientific concepts, and so was not himself a pragmatist or an instrumentalist.111 In his review, Chambliss presented accurately Madden's principal theses on Wright, dissenting on only two minor points: Madden's failure to mention the significance for the philosophy of science of Wright's application of mathematics to botany, and to note Wright's apparent denial of the self-containedness of the sensuous given in his notion of a functional a priori.112 (Madden subsequently clarified this matter in a short article stating that Wright's functional a priori concerned not the meanings of terms referring to simple sense data, but rather our coming to know or identify our perceptions.113) Chambliss accepted Madden's overall assessment that Wright's merit lay in the intrinsic value of his own work, more than in his muted prefigurements of later philosophers.11^ Morton White's chapter on Wright in his Science and Sentiment in America reflected a later influence of Madden's interpretations of Wright. White stated, Although he is sometimes thought of as an early pragmatist, it is more accurate to think of him as an empiricist way paver for pragmatism . . . who encouraged it by opposition to Transcendentalism, by fostering philosophical respect for scientific method, and by his whole-hearted acceptance of Darwin's theory of natural selection.115</page><page sequence="25">Edward Madden on Chauncey Wright 57 He followed Madden in his attribution to Wright of a forward-looking empiricism limited to scientific concepts, and in his description of Wright's views of the cognitive status of metaphysical propositions. In connection with the latter, White formulated a distinction between two senses of "belief*' he suggested Wright made implicitly: in the realm of faith, an expression of belief simply registers an attitude toward a proposition, while in the realm of science, such an expression additionally implies that there exists empirical evidence which would support a knowledge claim.116 Lest one conclude that Madden's work eliminated all diversity in the interpretation of Wright, I must cite Bruce Kuklick's treatment of him in The Rise of American Philosophy. Kuklick delved little into the fine points of Wright's philosophy, no doubt due to the broad scope of his book, and, I believe, misread him when he did: for example, he rendered Wright's contrast between internal and external signs in "The Evolution of Self-Consciousness" as a contrast between a sign and its object.117 Oversights such as this, however, are insignifi cant in relation to Kuklick's rendition of Wright's position on meta physics and religion. Contradicting all previous interpretations of Wright, he saw him as believing in God and the immortality of the soul, and attributed to him an "evolutionary pantheism."118 Madden and P. H. Hare responded to these assertions in their lengthy review of the book.119 Elizabeth Flower and Murray Murphy, too, in A History of Ameri can Philosophy offered some views of Wright different from Madden's. While essentially accepting Madden's view of Wright's forward-looking empiricism, they much more narrowly construed the focus of Wright's thought as the defense of evolution.120 Most of their discussion of him was organized around this theme, and they did not perceive the breadth of philosophical inquiry that Madden found in Wright. Further, they attributed "religious commitments" to Wright, though without (as Kuklick at least attempted to provide) any documentary evi dence.121 My own work on Wright appeared in two articles, "Chauncey Wright's Theory of Meaning," and "Chauncey Wright and the Problem</page><page sequence="26">58 Robert Giuffrida, Jr. of Relations."122 I have never put forward a comprehensive survey of Wright's views, as I am substantially in agreement with Madden's interpretations, but I have sought to correct and supplement his work where I considered it necessary. In the first article, I claimed that Madden and others who saw Wright as an early verificationist, even in a restricted sense, had been mistaken. Using a distinction between antecedent or definitional meaning, and significance or experiential meaning, I reinterpreted those passages in which Wright expressed his forward-looking empiri cism, and concluded that Wright never conflated the two as did the logical positiviste.123 Wright always recognized the meaningfulness of the various terms and propositions he analyzed, quite independently of whether they were verifiable. This meant that it was not accurate to attribute the later verificationists' notion of system meaning to Wright, concerning terms for the theoretical entities of science, because he had no doubt about their meaningfulness to begin with. Wright's notion of indirect verif?ability was that it counts substantially the same as direct verif?ability in supporting science's knowledge claims.12^ This also meant that Wright was not attempting to show that meta physical (including religious) propositions are meaningless. He was merely challenging their validity as knowledge claims, with the aim of disencumbering science from philosophical and theological con straints.125 In the second article, I used Madden's characterization of Wright's novel position on spatial relations as a starting point for a more detailed exposition of Wright's views on space. I explained Wright's distinction among the terms "spatial relations," "extensity" (the simple property of sensations being spatial), and "Space" (the unified, continuous conceptual framework within which we locate all sensations),126 and then described the mechanism by which, for Wright, the mind passes from the simple intuition of spatial properties and relations to the hypothesis of a continuous Space. This mechanism was the operation of the faculty of "understanding," by which the mind constructively synthesized abstract representations produced by the imagination, to form conceptions such as Space and Time (which were hypotheses because not derived directly from experience).127 In this way, Wright</page><page sequence="27">Edward Madden on Chauncey Wright 59 added significantly to the traditional empiricist conception of mind. As a secondary point, I showed how Wright's functional a priori allowed Wright to hold the somewhat unusual position of accepting the self containedness of the sensuous given while rejecting the incorrigibility thesis. He did not confuse the meanings of terms for simple sensations with the identification of these sensations, and supposed an (error prone) act of comparison in our cognition of them.128 This, too, was an original contribution to empiricist thought. Finally, I should mention Barbara MacKinnon's remarks on Wright in her recently published anthology of American philosophy. These are found in her introduction to the selections from Wright's writings, in which she quoted Madden several times, accepting the main points of his interpretation of the nature and significance of Wright's views.129 MacKinnon's rendition of Wright, I believe, is illustrative of the overall consensus that has developed on the major points of Wright's philoso phy as a result of Madden's work. Thus, while there is no doubt much more work to be done on Wright, the guidelines of such future research clearly have been set. Troy, New York NOTES 1.
