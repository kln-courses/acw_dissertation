<plain_text><page sequence="1">PREHISTORIC SCULPTURE from the Columbia River By Emory Strong In few areas in the United States has there been such a dearth of archaeological research as along the Colum- bia River, where there is such a wealth of material. The prehistory of man on the Columbia River is extremely complex. Along the Long Narrows, near The Dalles, Oregon, a team from the University of Oregon under the direction of Dr. L. S. Cressman excavated, layer by layer, through nearly thirty feet of refuse, a site con- tinuously occupied for over ten thousand years. The upper levels contained modern trade goods; the lowest was dated by the Carbon 14 method at 9,780 years ago. Since this date is from a composite layer, the bottom level may be as much as eleven thousand years old. Now most of the ancient villages are lying deep beneath the waters, behind the dams which have harnessed the vigorous Columbia. During the terminal stages of the Ice Age a tongue of the glacier extended far into Idaho, blocking the drainage from the melting ice until a great lake was formed that covered Montana and parts of nearby states. Eventually the weakened ice dam failed, releasing a cataclysmic flood that surged across the lowlands and poured through the Columbia River gorge a thousand feet deep, sweeping all life before it. Sparse evidence shows that man lived along the river before this disaster, called the Spokane Flood. After the waters receded, man slowly began again to settle near the river ; the earliest arrivals were hunters and food-gatherers who left crude percussion-chipped tools to mark their presence. As the population grew, the artifacts lost in the refuse heaps increased in number. From the stagnant pools and back- waters of the river, birds were captured with the bola. Game was slain with stone-tipped darts hurled with the atlatl. Fishing was important, as was the gathering of seeds and berries. About seven thousand years ago, the weather gradually grew warmer and drier, finally desiccating the lakes and marshes of the Great Basin, where an extensive popula- tion seems to have existed, and forcing them to migrate to more favorable areas. Undoubtedly some of them found their way to the Columbia, and perhaps even to the Pacific shore. During the hot, dry altithermal period, which lasted about 3500 years, life along the river seems to have been barely at subsistence level; the population did not increase nor did the culture expand. As the weather moderated, however, the increase in population became rapid. Carved stone appeared, and well made pressure-flaked points. The rich Columbia River culture was in its formative stages. From still inadequate archaeological investigations made along the river it appears that this prolific culture was well established about 1200-1500 years ago and reached its apex 400-800 years later; by the time of the European invasion, or soon after, it withered and died. The culture was completely prehistoric and untouched by European influence, unlike the better known North- west Coast cultures, which produced monumental zoomorphic and anthropomorphic sculptured forms. The cause of this people's artistic decline is unknown. There is no evidence that they were overrun by invaders. The artifacts found with burials attest to a fairly peace- ful existence, for weapons are rare and have the appear- ance of symbolism rather than utility. Unlike the Aztec and other American civilizations, the Columbia ' River 131</page><page sequence="2">1. Handle of stone maul or pestle, in the form of a human head. Broken off at the bottom.

Prehistoric Sculpture continued culture harbored no highly stratified society. In ceme- teries utilized over long periods by specific tribes addicted to interment of the possessions of the deceased, any burial may contain grave goods, but none is furnished with an unreasonably large amount. The objects in the graves are mostly of stone, with a few of bone. It is known that wood was used to a large extent for artistic expression. Shell, feathers and fiber were also utilized and, occasionally, unfired clay. These materials have nearly all disappeared over the ages; their use probably exceeded to a large extent that of stone. Thus the urge to create may not have disappeared ; instead, it may have been gradually transferred from stone to a perishable medium. Great landslides along the river which produced rapids, such as the Cascade Rapids, must have affected the economy and hence the entire culture, by disrupting the salmon runs on which the natives depended for their 132</page><page sequence="3">existence. The coming of the horse about 1720 caused another cultural upheaval, with increased mobility which must have resulted in greater inter-tribal contact. And of course the white man's diseases, introduced about 1780, spelled disaster: by 1835 over three-quarters of the natives along the lower river had perished, and these once powerful nations were forever destroyed. No white man ever saw the natives of the Columbia in the full glory of their culture. The Columbia, a young, energetic stream, enters the state of Washington from Canada near the Idaho border. From there it flows southward, then sweeps north and west in a great bend, forced against the granite hills by the Miocene Age basalt flows. Through these lavas it cuts a narrow channel to emerge into the semi- arid plains of Central Washington and Oregon near Priest Rapids, flowing south and then west to the Pacific Ocean through a deep gorge extending through the Cascade Mountains. There are two distinct climatic areas, the rain-washed hills and forests west of the Cascades and the dry plains to the east. Each area had a separate culture adapted to the region, yet both were dependent on the salmon. To the east the people were partially nomadic, roaming from berry fields in the mountains to the prairies for harvesting roots, and always to the river in the salmon season. To the west the natives lived in large permanent villages, in houses built of split cedar planks. The two cultures met at the Long Narrows of the Columbia, site of the village Wishram of Washington Irving' s Astoria. Astride the only water level pass across the mountains between Canada and California, Wishram became the great trade mart of the West, as well as the most important fishing site. At the Long Narrows the Columbia, in volume second only to the Mississippi, was forced through a vertical walled channel in the dense basalt, less than two hundred feet wide and over three hundred feet deep. The violent currents forced the salmon to seek channels and eddies, where they were easily netted or speared. The natives met at Wishram as much to trade, gamble and fraternize as to fish. The mixing of cultures and the large population have made this place one of the richest archaeological areas in the United States, and it is here that most of the better specimens of primitive art have been uncovered. The style is characterized both by originality and by mechanical precision. Small bone amulets and effigies are greater in number, and antler and stone are carved with more diversity of style and mastery of technique, than in the lowlands to the west, where sculpture depended more on scale and boldness for its impact. In the lowlands grew the cedar, that useful wood from which the natives constructed and furnished their houses and canoes, and with which they expressed their aesthetic impulses. Consequently, fewer stone ob- jects are found west of the Cascades, but those that do appear are noted for their developed style. The art style of the Columbia River has distinctive features which readily identify it. While each of these features may be found in other primitive art, their com- bination here is unique, and attests to a long and pro- gressive development. The most characteristic element is the exposed skeleton motif. The bulging eyes and promi- nent brow ridge, as shown in a maul handle (Figure 1), are typical. Other stylistic elements, besides the over-all massiveness, are an elaborate headdress or ornamentation, the crescent mouth or ' grinning face," or the portrayal of a single significant feature, such as the eyes alone. Some carvings, especially those on antler and bone, have intricate interlocking designs. The artistic impulse of primitive people is usually expended on the embellishment of utilitarian objects, and on the Columbia there are many examples of this motivation. Hand mauls, used for driving wedges to cleave wood for use as planks or fuel, are highly polished and frequently carved into stylized or conventional zoomorphic forms. On the upper river, in the semi-arid regions east of the Cascade Mountains, the maul was the favorite article and in some places almost the only one on which aesthetic effort was expended. The maul shown in Figure 2 is an example of this type of expression. It is made of dense black basalt, ground and polished until it glistens. On the handle end are three interlocking faces, carved with a technical skill indicating high artistic development. Nearly all stone mortars from the Columbia have some decoration, if only rim delineation or geometric design. Unfortunately, the natives of the West possessed no pottery, that useful medium by which the sequence of artistic development can be followed. Instead, besides the stone bowls, they used baskets, made waterproof by superb weaving, and wooden bowls for cooking by the hot stone method. The high development of the art of basket-weaving at the time of the European invasion in- dicates a long tradition. An example of massive art style adapted to a utilitarian object is shown in the lava mortar in Figure 3. Two of the stylistic elements of Columbia River art are evident, the bulging eyes and prominent brow ridge. The rim pattern emphasizes the outline, and leads the interest skilfully to the main feature. The interior of this bowl shows extended use. A different artistic treatment is shown in a mortar carved of granite (Figure 4) ; the skill of the artisan who created this masterpiece was superb. The uplifted 133</page><page sequence="4">4.

The regularly spaced features are balanced by the protruding tail, and elimination of the back legs enhances rather than detracts from the feeling of motion. This bowl was found on the river s edge, washed from the bank, and many artifacts are found in the same way by diligent searchers of its shores; in fact all of the objects shown in this article were discovered by amateurs. The most highly developed utilitarian art appears on small mortars, known locally as "paint pots" on the assumption that their primary function was as a recep- tacle for grinding paint. While some may have been so used, most are not suitable for the purpose. Some are too deep, while others are made of porous stone. Their most probable use was for mixing the potions and herbs used by the local shaman in his rites. The almost in- credible amount of work expended on them would imply ceremonial use. The carving in bas-relief - rare in the art of this region - shown in Figure 5 is made of lava; considerable skill in handling a difficult medium is demonstrated. This was probably a ceremonial mortar. A beaver with broad tail is represented ; both side and top views are shown in the same plane. The rim design skilfully fills the voids but does not detract from the emphasis on the face or create unbalance at the tail. Like most pieces found in cremation graves, this one has been broken - "killed" - in order to release its spirit to follow the departed owner. What is probably the finest sculpture yet found along the Columbia is the standing owl shown in Figure 6. While retaining the characteristic solemnity of its living model, it imparts a feeling of vigor; the poised wings and prominent features radiate life. The quality of the carving is excellent. The polish masks the char- acter of the stone so that its type cannot be determined, but it is dense and hard. The tiny bowl in the back ap- pears to be symbolic rather than of practical use.

"flat face" style of this figure is unusual, and serves to illustrate the originality and diversity of the local art. The eyes and mouth may have been inset with shell or mica. This figure was found in a cremation pit at a depth of six feetv Most of the better specimens are found in these pits, or with inhumation burials which lie just beneath them. Cremation is presumed to be a fairly recent trait along the river, and the cremations overlying inhumations indicate a change of burial practices within the same culture. This carving probably dates between 400 and 800 years ago. The owl, as in many other places, was the favorite subject for portrayal along the river. One form is called a "Spedis Owl," after a prominent local Indian; it ap- pears in numerous petroglyphs on the cliffs along the Long Narrows. Frequently only the eyes and beak appear on the petroglyphs, and on mortars such as that shown in Figure 3. Figure 7 illustrates both the non-utilitarian artistic conception and the bold style found along the lower river. This seated owl was found on Sauvies Island near Portland, Oregon. The dignity of the owl has been ad- mirably captured by the prehistoric sculptor; the bird has the appearance of a pompous judge about to render an important decision. In this specimen the feeling of vigor and dignity is imparted by sheer boldness, without refinement of detail. By contrast the owl in Figure 6, from the upper river, obtains the effect by symmetry and perfection of workmanship. Figure 8 shows a less de- tailed treatment of the owl, still retaining the expression of dignity. Two types of clubs are shown in Figures 9 and 10. The former is of whalebone and shows one typical dec- oration of this type of weapon ; the latter is a bird effigy carved of basalt. It was made to be used with a wooden handle; the groove separating the head and body serves for its attachment. Pure geometric design is represented by the bowl shown in Figure 11, carved of mountain sheep horn. By steaming, this material could be bent and formed into 135</page><page sequence="6">7.

Prehistoric Sculpture continued almost any shape, and it was extensively used for dishes and spoons, which were seldom decorated with other than simple designs. Some of the utilitarian objects depend on form alone for their aesthetic expression. One of this type is an arrow-shaft straightener (Figure 12). So-called atlatl weights (Figure 13) are carefully finished; they are al- ways made of highly colored stone, and beautifully formed and polished. While there is no «direct evidence that these particular stones were used as atlatl weights, they are similar in shape to stones known to have been so utilized. All were grave offerings, indicating a sym- bolic use. The famous Columbia River gem points (Figure 14) are made of semi-precious agate, opal and petrified wood. Not only was the most beautiful stone used, but they were chipped to display the color and grain to the best advantage. The Columbia River tube pipe (Figure 14) is also known for its artistic form and excellent workmanship. Occasionally one is carved with geometric or anthro- pomorphic designs, and many show wear from extensive use. Unfortunately, most pipes have been "killed" or badly burned in cremations. The Columbia, once a rapid stream sustaining a large native population on its shores, is now a series of stag- nant pools behind monumental dams. Before the river was tamed its flow fluctuated widely, washing many artifacts from its banks, and the violent winds that sweep up the gorge uncovered others from the moving sands. Few indeed will now be the art treasures uncovered, until some time in the far distant future when the pools are drained and the sediment eroded.
