<plain_text><page sequence="1">Evidence and Inference in Nuclear Research Martin Deutsch Time and again the question of evidence and inference in experi mental physics has been used as a starting point for the discussion of scientific method. I shall discuss the question in a rather personal way, for in my own work I have been puzzled at times by the striking degree to which an experimenter's preconceived image of the process which he is investigating determines the outcome of his observations. The image to which I refer is the symbolic anthropomorphic representation of the basically inconceivable atomic processes. Modern microphysics deals with phenomena on a scale on which there are no human sense organs to permit a direct perception of the phenomena investigated. I do not mean simply that our organs are not sensitive enough to observe the processes. This would be true in astronomy, where the observed celestial bodies may be too far away to be seen and resolved by the human eye, and in geology, where the interior of the earth is not accessible to direct observation. In quantum physics, however, the inaccessibility is of a more funda mental nature. While telescopes and microscopes and seismological listening devices can refine our senses to the point where they will give a sensory impression of the astronomical or microscopic objects which, although distorted, is still certainly relevant, there is no conceivable way of seeing, for example, an electron in its orbit in the hydrogen atom, or a neutron on its way out of a nucleus. The human imagination, including the creative scientific imagina tion, can ultimately function only by evoking potential or imagined sense impressions. I cannot prove that the statement I have just made is absolutely true, but I have never met a physicist, at least not an experimental physicist, who does not think of the hydrogen atom by evoking a visual image of what he would see if the particular atomic model with which he is working existed literally on a scale accessible to sense impressions. At the same time the physicist reahzes that in fact the so-called internal structure of the hydrogen</page><page sequence="2">Evidence and Inference in Nuclear Research 89 atom is in principle inaccessible to direct sensory perception. This situation has far-reaching consequences for the method of experi mental investigation. The use in the interpretation of physical phenomena of factors not directly perceivable is, of course, very old. But there is a basic difference between this procedure in classical phenomena and in microscopic quantum physics?a difference which I shall try to illustrate by two examples. First let me take a classical example, the simple meteorological phenomenon of the rising and setting of the sun. There is probably immediate agreement among all rational observers of the sun's behavior, that we are dealing with the relative motion in space of a luminous body and the observer. (Only very rarely has the sug gestion been made that we are reaUy dealing with a stationary object and that only the light rays follow different paths in the course of the day.) The nature of this motion has been investigated by methods famiUar to every schoolboy. The angle at which the sun is visible from various locations at various times has been recorded with great care and compared with the angle at which the moon and the stars are visible. Various kinematic descriptions have been achieved, such as the Ptolemaic and Copernican. Further refinement of such theories have led to a dynamic rather than kinematic description, in terms of the Newtonian system of gravi tational mechanics appropriately modified by relativity. Whatever theory we may develop, there will never be any doubt that the relevant observations are those of the sun's position, of the length of shadows, etc. There is a direct and self-evident Unk between the sensory image and the scientific theory. But now let us consider one theory of celestial mechanics which has at various times enjoyed great popularity: we assume that the sun is moved by a spirit which may be appeased or influenced to act in a favorable or unfavorable fashion. For example, the rising of the sun must be achieved by invoking the favor of this spirit. To test this theory our experimentation has to apply not only to the sun, the moon, the stars, and the shadows, but in principle also to the spirit which is not amenable to sensory perception. The whole context of relevant factors is now suddenly changed; if the sun is echpsed it may become necessary to investigate whether the king did not violate a taboo. Furthermore, the question is really very difficult to settle by experimentation because the spirit might at one time be in a more tolerant mood than at another and we have, in</page><page sequence="3">90 Daedalus principle, no way of making this mood directly accessible to our senses. Bad though this situation is, it is in some respects more favorable than that obtaining in quantum physics. It is, after all, ultimately possible to decide between these theories with reasonable certainty by performing observations only on the celestial bodies themselves. Having accumulated a sufficient amount of data concerning the behavior of the sun over the centuries, we arrive at a complete description of past and future phenomena based entirely on direct sensory observations, and the animist theories collapse from the lack of evidence for their relevance rather than because they are exphcitly disproved. The evidence is convincing for any person with an ordinary degree of imagination, i.e., an ordinary ability to evoke the sense impressions which he would receive from the sun under certain specified conditions. In a typical modern physics experiment, on the other hand, the direct sensory impressions of the experimental situation are not only not very helpful to the solution of the problem investigated, but are not even likely to reveal the relevant factors. A typical high energy physics laboratory abounds in impressive sights and sounds. There is likely to be the huge magnet of an accelerator, pounding periodically as it is energized, the whirr of the electric generators, perhaps clouds of condensation above containers of liquid air and the rushing cooling water. The control room and the experimental area are fiUed with colored Ughts, hundreds of knobs, moving meter needles, and flashing oscilloscope patterns to deUght the heart of the space child. I am sure that a scientist of 150 years ago, told to proceed with experimentation in this laboratory, would have no difficulty in making extensive observations on the change in the appearance of the Ughts as various knobs are turned, and on the variation in the pitch of the generator noise. But, of course, none of these changes directly accessible to sensory impression are really relevant to the experiment actually being carried out. Even in the very roughest, prehminary experiment the nuclear physicist does not look at the object of his investigation, or listen to it, or sniff it, or try to determine its tem perature. He does not start with a simple impression of the phenomena, later refined by quantitative measurement. The only visible feature intimately connected with the actual experiment may be the position of a knot controlling the current through a magnet</page><page sequence="4">Evidence and Inference in Nuclear Research 91 and a mechanical recording device indicating the rate of arrival of ^electrical signals from a small counter. The experimental procedure may consist simply in noting the reading on the recorder as a function of the magnet current. Both the change made?the position of the control knot?and the resulting effect?the reading on the recorder seem almost neg?gihle in the totality of material involved in the experiment. This is also true if we search a little deeper and consider the total energy or total electric current involved in the actual observation, and compare it with the totals involved in the experiment. To make matters worse, there are prohatly several other knots which could be turned with much more drastic effect on our recorder. In addi tion, there are literally dozens of similar recording devices and hundreds of other similar knobs connected with the experiment, some of which may show correlations much more marked than those under investigation. Yet, if you ask the experienced experimenter he may tell you that these other effects are either fully understood or certainly without importance. We see, then, a situation in which the experiment is carried out under conditions in which almost all sensory impressions concerning its operation are irrelevant to the question investigated and in which a large number of related phenomena remain uninvestigated and, therefore, unexplained. How is it possible that important and reUable conclusions are drawn from this experimentation? The answer Ues in the fact that the experimenter starts out with a well structured image of the actual connections between the events taking place. Far from approaching the problem with the completely open mind which is supposed to be characteristic of the scientist investigating in an unbiased fashion all possible connections, he starts with the con viction that all of the relevant occurrences except the one which he is actually investigating in the experiment are either fully under stood or at least in principle exphcable on the basis of the preconceived image. Without this image, the experiment certainly could not have been conceived in the first place. In terms of our current image its description might be as follows: when the high-energy proton beam produced in the accelerator strikes the nuclei of the berylhum target, mesons are produced by the impact of these protons on the berylhum nuclei. They emerge from the target at various angles with various velocities. A narrow beam of these mesons is allowed to pass through a deflecting magnet</page><page sequence="5">92 Daedalus and then through two particle detectors placed several meters apart. We determine the velocity of the mesons in terms of the measurable time interval between the electrical pulses indicating their passage through the first and second of the detecting counters mentioned. The angle through which a beam of charged particles is deflected by a magnet of given strength is determined by the particles' momentum (classically, the product of its mass and its velocity). Since the particles can enter the detecting counters only if they have been deflected through a specified angle, the counters record only particles of a fixed momentum. Having measured the momentum and the velocity, we can directly calculate the mass. By changing the magnet current we vary this momentum until it corresponds to the velocity selected by the counters. If one does not already have some famiUarity with the field, this very condensed description is probably not sufficient to form a clear image of the experiment. But I hope that it does give the feeling that with the aid of a few simple diagrams and perhaps a clarification of some of the concepts involved, there would be no difficulty in understanding the result of this kind of measurement. The only reason for the acceptance of this picture by non-physicists is, how ever, the good name of the physicist who presents the picture. I cannot actually show you the protons, the nuclei, the mesons or even the electrical impulses except in an indirect fashion which already involves a good part of the conclusions to be understood. Similar problems arise also in other fields when a certain degree of sophistication has been reached, but I believe that the intellectual ocean between the actual observation and its rational interpretation which must be crossed by "dead reckoning" creates special problems for the experimental physicist. It is much safer and easier to change direction and to explore all possibihties while sailing on a lake within sight of the shores than it is while navigating an uncharted ocean, where even the sun and the stars are no longer visible. I have attempted to demonstrate that the actual phenomena, the actual physical occurrences in the apparatus of the typical modern experi ment, are extremely complex, and many of them involve interactions vastly greater than those under investigation. It is therefore of vital importance to consider not only the desired effects, but also as many of the alternative influences as possible. This is, of course, at the very core of experimental scientific procedure. There is no recipe, no rule of procedure which will permit the</page><page sequence="6">Evidence and Inference in Nuclear Research 93 unimaginative experimenter to consider all of these possibihties by applying systematic logical analysis to all aspects of his apparatus. The only workable scheme is to operate within the framework of an anthropomorphic image. It is sometimes amusing to watch two highly competent physicists discuss the functioning of an apparatus if their images have for some reason taken somewhat different forms; despite the fact that they reach the same conclusions they may have some difficulty communicating with each other. I should really say that there are two separate images involved in most experiments, one image representing the functioning of the apparatus, the other the basic physical phenomenon investigated. The procedure is probably more famihar in the instrumental aspect. We structure the behavior of the compUcated physical phenomena according to a functional interpretation; that is, we consider each part of the apparatus as a unit having a definite function with respect to our purpose. The language which we apply to it is frequently ludicrously anthropomorphic. For example, we say without hesitation: "This ampUfier does not like to operate at high counting rates," or "This circuit is designed to reject protons." The functional image which we construct is more sophisticated than this would imply, but it also ultimately reduces the functioning of the apparatus to terms analogous to phenomena directly amenable to sensory verification. This functional view of the physical phenomena does not cause any serious comphcations when apphed to the apparatus. After all, the apparatus is designed to perform a certain function according to the desire of the experimenter, and while there may be aspects of its behavior which cannot be under stood within this image, these are not necessarily relevant to the experiment. The problem is very much more serious when we consider the image representing the fundamental physical phenomenon studied. The description which I gave at the outset of the experiment that has been discussed is certainly not the only possible one of the sequence of events. We could, for example, imagine the phenomenon as one of interaction between the berylhum target, struck by the protons in our accelerator, and certain atoms in our counters. The concept of an unobservable physical particle traveling in a well-defined path through the magnet would then not be part of the image. We clearly could not have designed our original experiment and measured the mass of the particle unless we had</page><page sequence="7">94 Daedalus started out with an image of the phenomenon involving such a "particle." The very word used implies the image. But a meson is clearly not an object with the general properties of a ball which we could see if we had a sufficiently good microscope, or feel impinging on our hand if our nerves were a Uttle more sensitive. We are not forced by direct sensory perception to use this image. We have developed it because it allows us to reason from one experiment to the next by analogy; even in a mathemati cally sophisticated theory we deal with formal thought processes designed to connect sensory impressions. It, too, must proceed by analogy with the connections established between such perceivable events. Now it is clear that if one is too strongly attached to one's preconceived model, one will of necessity miss all radical discoveries. It is amazing to what degree one may fail to register mentally an observation which does not fit the initial image. I could quote some sad examples from my own career. On the other hand, if one is too open-minded and pursues every hitherto unknown phenomenon, one is almost certain to lose oneself in trivia. As I have tried to show in my illustration, in a typical experiment in modern physics the apparatus involves complex influences fre quently of much greater order of magnitude than the phenomenon investigated. Each of these influences can occupy a lifetime of experimental investigation before it is fully understood, and is most hkely to be of no particular scientific interest as it concerns only features of a particular piece of apparatus. The abi?ty to distinguish between what we call colloquially a "dirt effect" and a basic phenomenon that is still an unknown is what constitutes the decisive intuition of the experimenter in this field. It is really the ability to recognize relevance in the evidence presented by the experiment. I beUeve that there are at least three different manners of experi mentation in modern physics. While the three approaches may employ almost identical techniques in detail, they imply differences in attitude on the part of the experimenter. Most creative physicists show a definite tendency to favor one or the other of these approaches, at least during a large part of their active career. Most physicists also have a very strong prejudice about the relative merit or creative stature of the different approaches, although there is no general agreement concerning the order of such merit. Each</page><page sequence="8">Evidence and Inference in Nuclear Research 95 approach has made great and decisive contributions to our knowledge and understanding. The first of these three types of experimentation might be called "observation." It is the type we normally associate with the naturalist, a manner of letting nature bring the questions and answers to you. The phenomenon to be investigated may be ill defined at the outset, and the interpretation of the result obtained is initially uncertain. It is at this point that the investigator's imagination and ingenuity are apphed. In this type of experiment the image or model enters least consciously. In fact, the sophisticated model with its mathematical refinements is avoided as far as possible. The experimenter wants to approach the phenomena in what he considers to be the most unbiased fashion. But it is not possible to analyze and design an experiment without recourse to an image. Hence the experimenter will tentatively order his results according to a dehberately more primitive sensory image. He prefers so-called "visual techniques," of which the classical and still widely used example is the Wilson Cloud Chamber. Here, ionizing particles leave vapor tracks which are photographed; from the density, curvature and branching of these tracks the experts deduce the details of nuclear events which have taken place in the chamber, much as the auspex observed the flight of birds and the gypsy studies the pattern of tea leaves to predict the future. These methods give the illusion of direct sensory perception of the events involved. In fact, the relation between this sensory impression and the fundamental physical phenomenon may not be simple. It does, however, permit a logical analysis of the results without reference to the more sophisticated images required when one's reasoning is more closely linked with the actual physical process. Even when visual techniques are not used, this type of experimenter will usually like direct sensory representation of the results. You will find him representing his results as curves or graphs and squinting at these pictures in an attempt to relate himself in some way to the out standing visual features. The field of cosmic rays has long attracted physicists whose natural bent favors this kind of experimentation. Cosmic rays present themselves with an intensity and a variety which cannot be controUed by the experimenter, who can only design his apparatus to observe what arrives from outer space. An outstanding result of this type of experimentation was the discovery by C. D. Anderson</page><page sequence="9">96 Daedalus and, independently, by J. C. Street of the /?-meson, a particle of a kind completely unknown and unexpected at the time. The discovery was based on the appearance of a few cloud-chamber tracks produced by cosmic radiation. This first type of experiment leads most frequently to the kind of success to which the word discovery is most appropri ately apphed, namely, a new knowledge or insight found in an unexpected place or context. The second type of experiment is the one which the layman most generally expects to hear reported; starting with a well-established theory or perhaps with two alternative and mutually exclusive theories, the experimenter designs conditions in which the theory predicts a definite qualitative or quantitative outcome in a manner such that a contradictory result would require a basic revision of the theory or the acceptance of one of the two alternative theories and rejection of the other. In other words, the experimenter designs a "test" for the theory. The ideal experiment of this type is one in which the decision can be reached from the quahtative outcome and depends very Uttle on the precision of the measurement or the perfection of the experimental technique. This condition is of course rarely met in actual experiments, but the ingenuity of the experimenter in this situation is apphed to the design of an experiment approaching these characteristics. We see clearly how this differs from the first, "observation" type of experiment; in the "test" the phenomenon studied is determined by the pre-existing theory, and the inter pretation of the results should be self-evident in a well-designed experiment. The experimenter's contribution hes in the invention of a sharply defined experiment. In this "test" type of experiment, the image enters most consciously and explicitly. In fact, the experiment is usually designed to test the apphcabiUty of the image. Several of the most decisive advances in atomic and nuclear physics have been achieved by this type of ex periment. The most recent and one of the most heautiful examples is the experiment hy Wu, Amtler, Hudson, and Hayward, which proved the Lee-Yang theory postulating the hreakdown of parity conservation in weak interactions. This theory had teen developed as a tentative interpretation of some other experiments of the "oh servation" type dea?ng with heavy mesons. A numher of workers were attempting to test this theory ty means of experiments which required high precision of measurement. The results had teen in</page><page sequence="10">Evidence and Inference in Nuclear Research 97 decisive. The beauty of the decisive experiment lay in the fact that it produced a large effect which did not have to be measured with great precision. Provided the apparatus was performing at all as intended, the result of the experiment was incontrovertible. The third type of experiment is of the kind which I should like to designate "measurement." Here the experimenter accepts the frame work and perhaps even the details of the theory for the phenomena which he investigates. He may proceed to determine a constant of nature, as in the classic Millikan oil-drop experiment. Or he may investigate specific cases not easily fully investigated in the theory. A large part of atomic and nuclear spectroscopy falls into this category. In this type of experiment the role of the image is harder to assess. In one sense, the experiment is frequently designed on the assumption of the vahdity of the image. For example, the experiment which we have described above can only measure the mass of the meson if the image of the meson as a "particle" is valid. On the other hand, this type of experiment is, in some respects, the most naive and straight forward observation of the physical phenomena and a quantitative experimental result of the experiment may be found to be incom patible with the image or theory on which the measurement was based. At some point, frequently almost by accident, a phenomenon is observed which simply cannot be understood in terms of the estabUshed image. A classic example of this occurrence is the famous Davison Germer experiment. This experiment was designed to study the paths of electrons conceived of as particles in the sense of the classical model when they are scattered from crystals. The observations could not readily be ordered and understood in terms of this particle image at all. They seemed much more reminiscent of results obtained in phenomena to which an image of waves was customarily apphed. The result of this classic experiment then was the acceptance, already foreshadowed by other developments, of another image in which we think of electrons in the manner in which we usually think of waves. I have myself in most of my work preferred to perform this land of experiment. We have always been encouraged by a remark of Enrico Fermi: "Go ahead and perform this experiment. If you are lucky, you will make a discovery; if you have bad luck and your results agree with existing theory, you have at least performed a measurement." It is of course the ambition of every experimenter</page><page sequence="11">98 Daedalus performing this kind of experiment to make a discovery, somehow to sail safely between the Scylla of intellectual prejudice which makes us reject evidence not readily integrated without preconceived notions, and the Charybdis of irrelevance which has swaUowed many working days spent in the pursuit of instrumental artifacts.</page></plain_text>
