<plain_text><page sequence="1">Catholic Human Rights Theory: Four Challenges to an Intellectual Tradition* John A. Coleman, S.J. ** My own beliefs about human rights have always been grounded on very concrete icons and images. Around my neck, for example, I wear a pendant made by a political prisoner in Chile. I have been privileged to meet, through Amnesty International or church connec- tions, prisoners of conscience such as Mr. Babu, the former vice-presi- dent of Tanzania, who testify to the efficacy of human rights advocacy from a center in the first world. In Zambia and Peru, I have seen little children, whose subsistence rights have been denied, being treated for malnutrition by staff from missionary clinics. These human images and icons have led me to concrete commitments which include active membership in two international human rights organizations: Am- nesty International and the Roman Catholic church as a transnational human rights network of advocacy (I am referring not only to the Vatican's participation in the United Nations and its world-wide orchestration of refugee services through Catholic Relief Services but also to more local human rights networks such as, for example, the Vicariate of Solidarity in Santiago, Chile, or, in our country, the church-sponsored sanctuary movement for refugees from El Salvador and Guatamala). I mention these icons and commitments not so much to establish any personal credentials to address the topic, but to insist that we ground any intellectual discussion of human rights on vivid intuitions and experiences of human dignity and its violations. These are the appropriate deep sources for any intellectual elaboration of a theory of human rights. Probably the most important function of churches, as transnational actors, is to keep these ordinary human faces, the victims of human rights violations, vividly before us as living icons of God's image which evoke a response of solidarity in suffering. The church must sacramentalize for us those icons that portray the por- traits of the real faces whose lives and dignity suffer violence. It must make concern for the violation of human rights alive for us by reciting * This essay was originally delivered as part of series at Immaculate Conception Seminary, Long Island, New York.

Another function of theology and the churches, however, is more properly intellectual: to elaborate a coherent theory of human rights which can be articulated and defended in a broader, pluralistic discus- sion. It is to this task that I want to turn our attention. I am going to narrow our capacious topic to a slightly more manageable theme: The Catholic Human Rights Tradition-Four Conceptual Challenges to an Intellectual Tradition. Why this focus on the church as an institu- tional actor in human rights advocacy, and why a concern for the Catholic intellectual tradition on human rights? Neither governments nor international agencies, such as the United Nations, are especially effective advocates of human rights. Either their own self-interest, or pressing diplomatic reasons, severely limits governmental moral leverage on human rights questions.1 Transnational, nongovernmental advocates of human rights such as Amnesty International or the International Commission of Jurists lack, generally, adequate resources to organize, nurture, or protect local, indigenous human rights advocacy in places as diverse as Lithu- ania or Bolivia. The churches are uniquely on the spot to monitor human rights abuses and sustain human rights advocacy. The Church has local, grass-roots listening posts, and often the churches are the only possible sources of information across national boundaries. In a survey of contemporary international human rights develop- ments, Patricia W. Fagen, confirms this judgment when she concludes that human rights advocacy "can only occur where there exists some institutional umbrella that can protect human rights advocates and offer both political and material support for human rights activities .... Almost everywhere, the churches play the most critical role. Religious groups, when internally strong, are the least vulnerable in- stitutions."2 Brian Smith has amply documented Fagen's assertion about the churches for five Latin American countries.3 Similarly, Max Stackhouse describes various church-sponsored human rights 1.

My strategy in this focus on an intellectual theory of rights will be to look at the standard accounts of the Catholic intellectual tradi- tion on human rights, especially as articulated by two contemporary exponents of the tradition. There are four questions which point to the unfinished intellectual work in Catholic thinking about human rights. At this point, I will simply list the four challenges which I will later develop: 1. Is human dignity a sufficient foundation to ground human rights? 2. Why is there no theory of basic rights? What is lost by its absence? 3. What is the relation between a theory of rights and questions about the institutional embodiment of rights? 4. Can we understand the current Catholic human rights tradi- tion if we do not probe-and, perhaps, honor-the reasons the church in the nineteenth century rejected the liberal human rights tradition? Both Hollenbach and Hehir read the Catholic social teaching, embodied in papal encyclicals and episcopal pronouncements, through the lens of human rights theory.5 If there is a "seamless gar- ment" which weaves together concerns about abortion, nuclear arms, and poverty, as Hehir has contended in speeches he has written for Chicago's Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, the thread which ties these is- sues together is the Catholic theory of human rights. If there are such things as subsistence rights, as Hollenbach argues in the sections he drafted in the American Bishops' recent letter on the American econ- omy, once again the way to understand the claim is to probe the Cath- olic theory of human rights. Finally, in many articles, the Canadian social theologian Gregory Baum has pointed to this theory of human rights as the key to understanding why "Pope John Paul II accuses the communist countries of the East with violating the civil liberties of people, including religious freedom and political dissent, while he accuses the capitalist countries of the West of neglecting socio-eco- 4.

Before pressing my four challenges to Catholic human rights theory, I will briefly re- view the central argument and concepts of this work. In the structure of his argument defending Catholic rights the- ory, Hollenbach is preoccupied with three questions: the grounding of human rights, the interrelation of various human rights (especially civil-political versus socio-economic rights), and the issue of institu- tionalization of rights. In the background of the book are echoes of the debates about the North-South conflict, a new international eco- nomic order protected by international law, and a strategy for third- world development based on basic human needs. Hollenbach is look- ing for a better way than is available in the usual U.N. discussions to correlate the two United Nations covenants on human rights. He strongly resists the attempts by Maurice Cranston and other liberal theorists to dismiss the United Nations covenants on economic rights as mere programmatic ideals rather than rights. He also resists a util- itarian understanding of the public good which allows dismissal of the language of human rights, in Jeremy Bentham's phrase, as "non- sense-nonsense on stilts."7 Hollenbach favorably contrasts the Catholic theory on human rights with liberal theory, Marxism, and the United Nations tradition. Liberal rights theory, it is argued, grounds human rights in the pri- macy of liberty. Thus, H.L.A. Hart speaks of a "fundamental right to liberty" as the only human right.8 Rights are primarily "negative" rights to immunity against interference or political coercion. Unfor- tunately, "the liberal rights theory is compatible with the presence of extreme want in a society, even when the resources necessary to elimi- nate it are present."9 It escapes the dilemma of what looks like a barbarous trade-off of the liberties (perhaps even mere preferences) of some against the basic material needs of others "by restricting its con- cern to problems of justice and human rights which arise in societies 6.

It stresses the insepa- rability of personal freedom and social solidarity. Unfortunately, in Marxist theory, rights can never function as claims against society. They are always merely opportunities to participate in the benefits of the emerging socialist economy. CLAIMS IN CONFLICT pairs off these two traditions of Liberalism and Marxism and finds both wanting. "Liberal democracy notes that not all are willing to have society guarantee social and economic rights and concludes that these rights are not really rights at all. Rights are identified with claims to political liberty. Marxism, on the other hand, notes that unrestricted liberty in a class-stratified society leads to a denial of social and economic rights. Political liberty must be restricted if social and economic claims are to be guaranteed."1 The third element of the problem, the U.N. tradition, is dismissed as weak law. Enter, then, the mediating link between the truths in liberalism and Marxism, the classic Catholic third way. The Roman Catholic tradition "has developed an approach to human rights which is both activist and theoretically rigorous. It has . . . sought to take seri- ously both liberal democratic and socialist perspectives."12 In Hol- lenbach's view, the Catholic theory can more adequately ground a theory of human rights which looks to needs, freedoms, and relation- ships than alternative theories.13 Hence, ". . . the Roman Catholic tradition was led to respond to the threats to human dignity in a more integrated way than either liberal democracy or Marxism had done."14 Through official documents beginning with Leo XIII's Rerum Novarum, Hollenbach uncovers a theory of human rights which en- shrines the transcendental worth of persons. This transcendental worth entitles them not to be treated as means in a utilitarian calculus. He cites with approval this primacy of the personal in Leo XIII's dictum: "Man precedes the state."15 From Pius XI Hollenbach extracts a theory of social justice 10. Id. at 20. 11. Id. at 26. 12.

Human dignity makes a genuine moral demand upon the organizational patterns by which public life is structured."16 In Pius XII's allocutions Hollenbach sees a further development in Catholic human rights theory which lays stress on human dignity as a finite good. Fundamental forms of human interrelationship (the social in- stitutions of family, property, association, and government) so organ- ize and internally condition human dignity that they call forth a community of responsible citizenship. Hollenbach's book represents a careful balancing act between the personal and the communitarian. "Human rights cannot be under- stood apart from social interdependence nor can social well-being be understood apart from personal rights."17 Again, "the rights which protect human dignity are the rights of persons in community. They are neither exclusively the rights of individuals against the community nor are they the rights of the community against the individual."'8 He similarly balances the claims of philosophy and theology, of faith and reason. Thus, he argues that the ultimate foundation for the dig- nity of the person, whether Christian or not, consists in an ontological relation to God and Jesus Christ. Nevertheless, nontheological ("nat- ural" or philosophical) modes of analysis also play a genuine constitu- tive role in structuring the rights theory of the modern Roman Catholic tradition.19 Hollenbach endorses, and makes his own, the extensive list of rights (which includes, although it does not coherently integrate, both political and economic rights) in John XXIII's encyclical Pacem in Terris. He elaborates on the theory of justice in Catholic social think- ing which distinguishes and unites commutative justice (based on con- tract or promise or obligation between morally equal individuals) with distributive and social justice. "There are goods or values necessary for the realization of human dignity which transcend the sphere of private interaction and contract which is the concern of commutative justice. For example, such goods as political self-determination, par- ticipation in the economic productivity of an industrialized society, and enjoyment of one's cultural heritage can be obtained by an indi- vidual only through participation in the public life of society."20 16.

He articulates three strategic moral priorities (a version of which, interestingly enough, has been picked up by Pope John Paul II in his allocutions in Canada): 1. The needs of the poor take priority over the wants of the rich. 2. The freedom of the dominated takes priority over the liberty of the powerful. 3. The participation of marginalized groups takes priority over the preservation of an order which excludes them.21 At this point, I have reviewed enough of the Hollenbach volume to discuss several objections to his impressive achievement. I do so, not to belittle his achievement, but to raise questions regarding the coherency of the theory as presented. As a committed social Catholic I think and work within the same intellectual framework of Catholic rights theory. As an intellectual, however, I see several flaws in the Catholic argument for grounding, interrelating, and weighing various claims to human rights. FIRST CHALLENGE: THE SUFFICIENCY OF HUMAN DIGNITY TO GROUND RIGHTS The first challenge focuses on the justification for grounding rights in a norm of human dignity. It will be my contention that there are both philosophic and rhetorical difficulties with this way of grounding rights. On the face of it, both Hollenbach and Hehir seem to agree that the proper grounding of rights is in some norm of human dignity or the transcendence of the human person. Several citations will document this contention. Thus, in his summary of the social thought of Leo XIII, Hollenbach notes, "Leo's encyclicals laid the groundwork for the modem Catholic theory of human rights. Human dignity is the foundation of this theory."22 In surveying the various rights in the summing list of rights in John XXIII's Pacem in Terris he claims, "the thread which ties all these rights together is the fundamental norm of human dignity. Human dignity is not an ab- stract or ethereal reality but is realized in concrete conditions of per- 21. Id. at 204. 22. Id. at 49. 343] 349</page><page sequence="8">JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION sonal, social, economic, and political life."23 Finally, toward the end of his chapter on Roman Catholic rights theory, looking back on the whole sweep of Catholic documents on human rights, he remarks, "[t]he Roman Catholic tradition answers the question of the founda- tion of human rights with a single phrase, the dignity of the human person."24 For his part, Bryan Hehir similarly simply equates the rights of the person with the worth of the person.25 Behind both these authors stands the earlier work of Jacques Maritain on human rights: "The dignity of the human person? The expression means nothing if it does not signify that, by virtue of the natural law, the human person has the right to be respected, is the subject of rights, possesses rights."26 In his philosophic treatise on human rights, Human Rights, Es- says in Justifications and Applications Alan Gewirth challenges, on two grounds, this appeal to dignity as a way of grounding rights.27 Gewirth outlines the structure of any language of rights by analyzing the formal elements in the sentence, "A has a right to X against B by virtue of Y." Formally, there are five elements in any claim to a right, and every rights theory should address each one. 1. The subject of the rights: In the case of human rights the subject of the alleged right is every human, regardless of status, merit, or special particular need. The use of human rights language implies both full moral equality and universal claims. All humans qua human have this alleged right if it is truly a human right. 2. The nature of the right: In Gewirth's proposal some human rights are more basic than others, and, therefore, take priority over less basic rights. He contrasts rights to basic goods with rights to what he terms "nonsubtractive" and "additive" goods. 3. The object of the right: With this phrase, Gewirth refers to the specific reference and character of a right, e.g. to subsistence, physical security, the right to emigrate, etc. 4. The respondent of the right: This rubric gathers together the correlative duties to rights. 5. The justifying basis or ground of the right: This element re- 23. Id. at 68. 24. Id. at 90. 25.

GEWIRTH, HUMAN RIGHTS: ESSAYS ON JUSTIFICATION AND APPLICATIONS (1982). 350 [Vol. 2</page><page sequence="9">CA THOLIC HUMAN RIGHTS THEOR Y fers to the rational source to which one appeals to forge a logical nexus between the subject, nature, and object of the alleged right. When discussing attempts, such as the Catholic human rights theory, to ground rights on some norm of human dignity, Gewirth presses several difficulties. First, a theory based on human dignity, "puts chief emphasis on the relation between the subject and his re- spondent, whereby the former is in a position to choose to exact a certain duty from the latter."28 While this relation is important for the understanding of human rights, it must be supplemented by atten- tion to the nature of the right and the logical nexus between the justi- fying basis and the objects of human rights. Dignity theories of human rights generally either neglect or finesse these two formal ele- ments. They fail to specify the precise nexus between human dignity as an evocative quality and a particular alleged object of a right claim. Dignity theories do not make clear the logical and necessary connec- tions (the transition and the ground for claiming a specific right) be- tween a generic notion of worth or dignity and a specified right such as, for example, free speech. These connections remain "intuitively fitting" or merely esoteric. Secondly, arguing against Maritain's appeal to human dignity, Gewirth contends that there is a tautology between the term dignity and the term rights of the specific rights appeals to dignity are sup- posed to ground. Thus, the sentence, "X has a set of specified rights because of X's right to be treated with human dignity." But how do we ground this latter right as a right? Mere appeals to dignity beg the question or, as in Bryan Hehir's usage, equate the ground of the right with what it is supposed to ground (as in Hehir's tell-tale language "the worth of the person, and therefore the rights of the person").29 As Gewirth notes, "the two expressions, 'A has human rights' and 'A has inherent dignity' may seem to be equivalent so that the latter sim- ply reduplicates the former. ... If, however, the two expressions are thus equivalent in meaning, the attribution of dignity adds noth- ing substantial to the attribution of rights and someone who is doubt- ful about the latter attribution will be equally doubtful about the former. Thus, the argument for rights based on inherent dig- nity . . . does not satisfy the requirement of noncircularity."30 Gewirth suggests an alternative way of formulating a justification for rights in what he calls the necessary conditions of human action. 28. Id. at 13. 29. Hehir, supra note 5, at 5. 30. GEWIRTH, supra note 27, at 28. 343] 351</page><page sequence="10">JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION He contends that "the necessary conditions of action have more spe- cific and less disputable contents than may be attributed to concepts like dignity and flourishing."31 From this starting point, Gewirth links the situation of every human being as a prospective agent, who has purposes he or she wants to fulfill, to a concern with the necessary conditions of human agency (limited conditions of both freedom and well-being) and to a statement of basic goods which are the absolutely essential preconditions of action (such as life, physical integrity, and mental equilibrium). The advantage of the Gewirth formulation over the Catholic human rights theory's grounding of rights in dignity is that Gewirth's way of phrasing raises questions about the necessary condition of human action in ways that help us specify the objects of rights. Moreover, it is capable of generating, in principle, a theory of basic rights. Provided that this grounding by Gewirth, following the lead of the Catholic theory, entertains a sufficiently strong social un- derstanding of human action, I would contend that it promises to be, formally and in theoretical coherence, superior to the ordinary Catho- lic accounts which justify rights in a norm of human dignity. Perhaps the difference I am raising here with Hollenbach is purely semantic in the last analysis. He expands the notion of human dignity to include a complex and differentiated theory of social justice. Indeed, in one place, in a throw-away line never elsewhere expanded, he seems to concur with Gewirth's formulation: "Rights are the con- ditions for the realization of human worth in action."32 It may be that the extraordinary elegance and power of Hollenbach's account of human rights flows precisely from the fact that, implicitly, it is this formula about "the conditions of the realization of human action" which actually governs his theoretical argument more than the simpli- fied and evocative appeal to dignity to which he consistently and ex- plicitly appeals. Nevertheless, it seems to me that the formal, logical structure suggested by Gewirth of moves from subject of right, to na- ture, object, respondent, and the justifying basis of rights should yield a more elegant, clearer, and probably more theoretically tight account of Catholic rights theory than the vague appeals to human dignity characteristic of the standard accounts of Catholic rights theory. I am suggesting that Catholic rights theory should speak of the justify- ing ground of rights as "the necessary conditions for socially-situated 31. Id. at 51. 32. HOLLENBACH, supra note 5, at 91. 352 [Vol. 2</page><page sequence="11">CA THOLIC HUMAN RIGHTS THEOR Y human action" rather than the more capsuled, and misleading, formula of a norm of human dignity. My second objection to using human dignity as the ground for justifying human rights is basically a rhetorical difficulty. In an im- portant essay, "The Catholic Foundation of Human Rights," Gregory Baum recounts his fears that a theoretical foundation of rights which appeals too simply to the dignity of the human person as the imago dei with an infinite value could legitimate a liberal political philoso- phy, at odds with the Catholic social theory. Such a theoretical basis might promote individualism and undermine social solidarity.33 In so many ways, the language of a Catholic or Christian rights theory and that of the liberal utilitarian tradition or individualist lan- guage of rights sound very similar. Robert Bellah has alerted us to the danger of a contaminating conflation of these two languages: It has been suggested that basic human needs and rights may provide criteria for evaluating a new internationl economic order. Such a suggestion is a valuable one. However, 'needs' and 'rights' are key words in moder ideology. Needs in that context are grounded basically in biological appetites and rights derived essen- tially from the right of self-preservation as the highest of all rights. Placed in a religious context the terms take on entirely different meanings. 'Needs' in this case would include not only the individual ap- petites, but the needs for community, meaning, and spiritual aspi- ration. 'Rights' would be grounded not merely in self-preservation of the individual but in divine justice, law, or dharma. Above all, the use of 'needs' and 'rights' in a religious context would involve a critique of how these terms have been used pre- cisely to justify the devotion to the endless accumulation of wealth and power that has done so much to create our problems. . . Only an assertion of needs and rights in the context of a general critique of moder ideology could contribute to the solution of our long- run problems.34 In a similar vein, Max Stackhouse and Wilson Carey McWil- liams have amply documented Bellah's contention of an amalgam of Enlightenment individualist rights language and Puritan Calvinist strands in American religious history. As McWilliams puts it, "[c]oncern for practice often led Americans to overlook differences in 33. Baum, supra note 6, at 8. 34.

Hence, he claims "Catholic rights theory is far removed from individualist or libertarian social philosophy. The theory presented in the encyclicals is personalist, not individualist, and it recognizes that persons are essentially social and institution- building beings."37 It may be sorely doubted, however, that the gen- eral public-even the educated reader-will comprehend, following Maritain, the fundamental distinction between the personal and the individual. Throughout his book, Hollenbach stresses the strong social un- derstanding of the human person in Catholic social theory. Thus, he urges that human rights cannot be understood apart from social inter- dependence nor can social well-being be understood apart from per- sonal rights. In speaking of the common good, it seems to me, Hollenbach provides a more adequate basis (and a superior vocabu- lary) to human dignity for a foundation of rights by lifting up the collective, interpersonal solidarity of persons in the community. The common good must be understood primarily in structural terms. It is not a summation of the goods of individual citizens, but a set of social conditons which facilitate the realization of personal good by individ- uals. Hence, "[t]he rights which protect human dignity are the rights of persons in community. They are neither exclusively the rights of individuals against the community nor are they the rights of the com- munity against the individual."38 In his essay on human rights, Bryan Hehir captures much the same tone. "In the Christian position, the deepest meaning of freedom is 'freedom for,' engagement with others in society."39 In the first challenge to Catholic rights theory, I argue that the 35. W.

Hehir, supra, note 5, at 9. 354 [Vol. 2</page><page sequence="13">CA THOLIC HUMAN RIGHTS THEOR Y standard accounts of Catholic rights which found a theory of human rights simply in a norm of human dignity are insufficient on both phil- osophic and rhetorical grounds. Human dignity can not adequately (and nonintuitively) mediate the nexus between subjects of rights and the specific objects of alleged human rights. Nor, as we will see, can it generate a list of basic rights. A revision of Gewirth's proposed for- mulation for grounding rights in the necessary goods or conditions for human agency in community strikes me as a superior formal strategy for rooting the justificatory ground of a human rights theory. More- over, it is not human dignity but the Catholic notion of the common good (understood as the social matrix of values and institutional ar- rangements which mediate human agency) which serves as the key background notion for a Catholic grounding of a rights theory. Greg- ory Baum has similarly argued that "the theoretical foundation of civil liberties . . . is not simply the dignity of the human person which as imago dei has infinite value. Such a theory would legitimate liberal political philosophy. I wish to argue, on the contrary, that the theoretical basis for civil liberties and all human rights is the common good of society, i.e. the values, institutions, laws and structures that mediate relations between persons and groups in accordance with their dignity. Thus, the rights to dissent, to religious worship and to form associations and organize opposition are not granted simply be- cause the subjective demands of persons must not be violated."40 They are granted, rather, because they are the necessary conditions for a public good which serves as a matrix for human survival, action, and flourishing. A SECOND CHALLENGE: WHY IS THERE No THEORY OF BASIC RIGHTS? The further advantage of grounding a theory of rights on the nec- essary conditions for human agency in community (or the alternative wordings of "human social action" or "the necessary conditions for a personalist common good") lies in the fact that this strategy can yield a theory and list of basic rights. Generally, Catholic rights theory does not generate such a theory of basic rights. My own concern with the need for a theory of basic rights is twofold. First, such a theory seems necessary to adjudicate, with any rigor, conflicting claims to rights. Second, it provides us with a prior- ity list of rights to press in human rights advocacy. My membership 40. Baum, supra note 6, at 10. 343] 355</page><page sequence="14">JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION in Amnesty International has made me acutely sensitive to the need to keep our list of basic human rights short, chaste, and sober. If we expand our understanding of human rights too quickly (e.g. the right of all humans to a paid yearly holiday suggested by the U.N. Declara- tion on Human Rights or the right to own a pet recently tested in the American courts) we run the risk of trivializing rights. For this rea- son, I also resist attempts to speak of animal rights or God's right. I see these as category-mistakes in the use of language. It seems impor- tant to stay close to the original generating metaphor of rights lan- guage in the judicial context of courts and legal rights. Following Joel Feinberg, I would urge that we see human rights, flowing from this generating legal metaphor, as "claim-rights." Rights can be urged, pressed or justly demanded against other persons. In appropriate cir- cumstances the right-holder can "urgently, peremptorily, or insis- tently call for his rights or assert them authoritatively, confidently, unabashedly."41 Ronald Dworkin captures this same sense of rights as urgent moral claims between moral equals when he speaks of rights as "political trumps held by individuals."42 Despite loose usage by some theologians of "God's right to" as a grounding of human rights, I would contend that neither God nor animals can appropriately be said to have rights. God in his sover- eignty is beyond the realm of urgent moral claims in a society of moral equals. To have a right is to be in a position to make demands on others on whom one depends for the right. It is to be a moral claimant. God transcends this category except in anthropomorphic metaphor. Similarly, while humans may have responsibilities toward animals, only those capable of human agency can be said to have rights. Rights language should, appropriately, be restricted to in- terhuman agency. As we have seen, some concept of human agency in community is the only sufficient grounding of rights. Alan Gewirth deals with basic rights in terms of a concept of basic goods. "Basic goods are the essential preconditions of action such as life, physical integrity, and mental equilibrium."43 More use- fully, Henry Shue in his book, BASIC RIGHTS, carefully defines the term.

SHUE, BASIC RIGHTS 19 (1980). 356 [Vol. 2</page><page sequence="15">CA THOLIC HUMAN RIGHTS THEOR Y lowed to sink."45 In Shue's understanding, rights are basic if the en- joyment of them is essential to the enjoyment of every other alleged right. By nature, any list of basic rights will be short, chaste, and sober. They will provide us with an operative priority-list for human rights advocacy. Shue rather self-consciously proclaims that he is "working on the foundations, not the spires, of the edifice of rights."46 Thus, he sug- gests that rights to physical security, such as the right not to be as- saulted, are basic whereas the right to publicly supported education is not. He elaborates on this distinction: I do not mean by this to deny that enjoyment of the right to education is much greater and richer-more distinctively human perhaps-than merely going through life without ever being as- saulted. I mean only that, if a choice must be made, the prevention of assault ought to supersede the provision of education. Whether a right is basic is independent of whether its enjoyment is also valu- able in itself. Intrinsically valuable rights may or may not also be basic rights, but intrinsically valuable rights can be enjoyed only when basic rights are enjoyed. Clearly, few rights could be basic in this precise sense.47 Shue marshals a case that, at least, the rights to physical security, subsistence (basic necessities in the area of food, medicine, housing, clothing) and effective participation in choices about the operation of institutions and the implementation of policy where the person is di- rectly affected are candidates for basic rights. Like Hollenbach, Shue elaborates a threefold set of priority principles to adjudicate situations of rights-claims in conflict: 1. The fulfillment of basic rights takes priority over all other activity, including the fulfillment of one's own nonbasic rights; 2. The fulfillment of nonbasic rights takes priority over all other activity, except the fulfillment of basic rights, including the en- richment of culture and the satisfaction of ones own preferences; and 3. The enrichment of culture takes priority over the satisfaction of preferences in ways that do not enrich culture.48 Shue's presentation of his priority principles contains a theoreti- cal elegance and tightness of logic and argument lacking in the Catho- lic human rights theory. For his part, Hollenbach rejects an approach 45. Id. at 18. 46. Id. at 71. 47. Id. at 20. 48. Id. at 118. 343] 357</page><page sequence="16">JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION which attempts to establish a set of independent and discrete instru- mental rights in political, economic, health, religious, and familial sec- tors of institutional life. He fears that this approach does not pay "sufficient attention to the interconnections which actually exist be- tween personal rights or to the multiple social impacts of large-scale institutions. These interconnections and multiple impacts only come into view when the whole set of social rights is made the focus of concern."49 Thus, he argues that "adequate human rights policies must give priority to protecting the full set of social rights for all persons."50 To establish this full set of social rights Hollenbach appeals to the magisterial summation of rights in John XXIII's Pacem in Terris. He argues that these social rights include basic needs which can be met only in community, the exercise of personal freedom in interac- tion with others and relationships which bind persons to each other. On this basis, Hollenbach generates his threefold set of moral priori- ties which weigh the needs of the poor over the wants of the rich, the freedom of the dominated over the liberty of the powerful and the participation of the marginalized over the preservation of an order which excludes them. Although, intuitively, these three priority prin- ciples strongly resonate with my moral sentiments, I am unable to find in Hollenbach's work any careful argument in which to ground these human-rights priority principles. I think the difficulty in finding the argument lies in the failure of the Catholic rights theory to raise the issue of basic rights in Shue's sense. Pacem in Terris enumerates some twenty-seven different specific rights ranging from the rights to life and bodily integrity; the right to security in sickness, inability to work, widowhood, old age, unem- ployment; a right to basic education (and, on the basis of merit and talent, a right to advanced studies); a living wage, to form unions; rights to emigrate and immigrate (which are seen as totally parallel rights) and rights to assembly, association, and participation in the political process.51 The rights list in Pacem in Terris-a systematic recapitulation of the rights claims made in the Catholic tradition since Leo XIII-in- cludes both basic and nonbasic rights without distinguishing the two. It also includes ideals connected with the enrichment of culture (e.g. 49. HOLLENBACH, supra note 5, at 197. 50. Id. at 203. 51. Cf. Pacem in Terris in THE GOSPEL OF PEACE AND JUSTICE 203-206 (J. Gremillion ed. 1976). 358 [Vol. 2</page><page sequence="17">CA THOLIC HUMAN RIGHTS THEOR Y advanced education and the pursuit of art). I readily grant the enor- mous attraction of these latter as ideals. I also grant the attraction of a list of fundamental rights which includes both liberties and eco- nomic rights. As John Langan has recently noted, "In the Catholic approach to human rights theory there is a clear affirmation of what are commonly called social and economic rights, that is, rights to food, clothing, housing, education, and medical care, as well as to different forms of social participation, of which the right to a job is particularly important."52 Nevertheless, the rights list in Pacem in Terris is sufficiently lengthy and specific as to make adjudication difficult in cases where various human rights are in conflict. Compare, for example, the mere juxtaposition of various subsistence and economic rights in paragraphs 11 and 20 of Pacem in Terris and the assertion of a right to private property, even of productive goods, in paragraph 21 (with the reminder in paragraph 22 of a "social duty inherent in the right of private property") with the greater moral bite and elegance in Shue's ability, relying on a theory of basic rights (a short list is essential here), to demonstrate cogently that "property institutions can be fair only if subsistence needs for economic commodities are guaran- teed."53 The difficulty, of course, is that private property, even if le- gitimately recognized as a human right, is not a basic right in the same sense as a right to subsistence. As Shue persuasively argues, only some socio-economic rights (e.g. subsistence) and some civil- political rights are basic rights. The Catholic list lumps together, without remainder, subsistence and other socio-economic rights. It is not that I doubt that a case can be made for most (but not all) of the rights enumerated in Pacem in Terris as universal human rights, but the absence of a theory of bottom-line "basic rights" makes the adju- dication of rights in conflict more vague than is necessary. Especially the notion of subsistence rights as basic rights lacks clear accentuation and justification in Catholic rights theory; although, implicitly, of course, it is present. The sections on human rights in the recent draft of the American Bishops' Pastoral Letter on "Catholic Social Teaching and the U.S. Economy"-sections which bear the imprint of Hollenbach who served on the drafting committee of the letter-go a long way toward moving toward a theory of basic rights. Indeed, all human rights (I 52. Langan, The Bishops and the Bottom Line, COMMONWEAL, 590 (Nov. 1984). 53. SHUE, supra note 44, at 125. 343] 359</page><page sequence="18">JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION think unfelicitously) are equated in that document with basic rights, "the minimum conditions of life in community."54 Once again, the Pastoral Letter appeals to the summary list of human rights in Pacem in Terris. All of these rights, then, are lumped together as "the minimum conditions which respect human dignity and social solidarity."55 Only an appeal to papal or ecclesiastical pos- itivism, however, could justify including John XXIII's right to emi- grate and immigrate (#25 in Pacem in Terris) and freedom in pursuit of art (# 12) as the most basic or minimum conditions for life in com- munity.56 It may well be that the summary list of rights in Pacem in Terris contains a subset of purely basic rights. Neither in Pacem in Terris, nor in CLAIMS IN CONFLICT, nor in the sections on human rights in the Bishops' Pastoral, however, are we ever given an argu- ment why just this full set of rights listed (and not only a subset of the list or, in addition, some rights not listed) should function as our uni- verse of basic rights. In the Bishops' Pastoral, the rights enumerated in Pacem in Ter- ris are seen as either "the absolute minimum for the protection of human life" or the indispensable social guarantees for the protection of these minimum rights.57 In an improvement over Pacem in Terris, the Bishops' letter distinguishes the right to subsistence from other, less basic but still universally human, economic rights. Curiously, however, the Pastoral Letter fundamentally appeals, to ground subsis- tence rights as a priority or basic right, neither to human dignity as such nor to the necessary conditions of human action. The right to subsistence as a priority right is grounded on a specifically biblical and theological principle, "the preferential option for the poor."58 This asymmetry in grounding at least one basic right further compli- cates the issue of a Catholic theory of basic rights. Although it is asserted that the "fulfillment of the basic needs of the poor" as a pri- ority right is "also a priority fully supported by human experience and reason," no explicit reason for this priority from experience or logic are actually presented.59 Notoriously, Catholic theology prefers both-and options to 54.

It shuns conflict and avoids facing squarely the condition of sin, scarcity, and finitude which dictates at times, hard choices and trade-offs on rights. Catholic theories of society are gen- erally conflict-free. Catholic theories of truth, for their part, tend al- ways to make distinctions, to use Maritain's classic phrase, only in order to eventually unite what has been distinguished. My proposal is that Catholic rights theory provide, in the manner of Shue, a theory and short list of basic rights. When this foundation is firmly laid, we can work later on the spires. Meanwhile, this foundation will give urgency, bite, and direction to our human rights advocacy. THIRD CHALLENGE: RIGHTS AND INSTITUTIONALIZATION In the third challenge to Catholic rights theory, I will focus on the connections between rights and institutionalization. On this point, Shue is eloquent: "A proclamation of a right is not the fulfill- ment of a right, any more than an airplane schedule is a flight. A proclamation may or may not be an initial step toward the fulfillment of the rights listed. It is frequently the substitute of the promise in the place of the fulfillment."60 Shue reminds us that "a right has not been fulfilled until arrangements are in fact in place for people to enjoy whatever it is to which they have a right."61 The fundamental truth in legal positivism, which would restrict legitimate rights claims to those, in fact, guaranteed by constitutions, legal enactments, and courts, lies in the connection Shue presses be- tween rights and institutionalization. Of course, legal positivism suf- fers from a voluntarist and consensus understanding of rights. It disallows a notion of rights against society and its legal enactments. It, fallaciously, conflates the legal and moral orders which only, im- perfectly, overlap. Max Stackhouse echoes Shue's fundamental con- cern about rights and institutionalization when he notes that "the institutional dimension of human rights is missing in much of the cur- rent literature on human rights."62 Hollenbach, to be sure, strongly emphasizes the organizational and institutional consequencses of the norm of human dignity. "Human dignity makes a genuine moral demand upon the organiza- tional patterns by which public life is structured."63 Hollenbach also notes the fallacy in legal positivism, i.e. "confusing fundamental 60.

HOLLENBACH, supra note 5, at 55. 343] 361</page><page sequence="20">JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION human values with the means by which these values are institutional- ized."64 Moreover, he warns against "foreshortening the discussion of the theory and foundation of human rights claims by a premature conclusion about how they are to be implemented."65 Limitations of space permit me to only list the challenges to the Catholic human rights theory under the rubric of human rights and institutionalization: 1. Catholic rights theory is relatively vague about spelling out the institutional embodiments which are the correlates to the eco- nomic, political, religious, civil, familial, and educational rights enu- merated in Pacem in Terris. To some extent, as an international church rooted in many continents and political, cultural, and eco- nomic systems some of this vagueness is simply unavoidable. More- over, there may be plural ways to embody, institutionally, the kinds of economic and political rights listed in Catholic rights theory. Still, the extraordinary vagueness on the institutional implica- tions of the rights proclaimed leads to certain anomalies. Thus, Mus- solini in Italy and Dolfuss in Austria could claim that their regimes incarnated, institutionally, the rights enunciated in Pius XI's Quadragesimo Anno. Thus, too, the dictator head of state in anti- communist and authoritarian Brazil could proclaim that the institu- tions of his government embodied the human rights thrust in Paul VI's encyclical Populorum Progressio (an encyclical dubbed by the Wall Street Journal as "warmed-over Marxism"). With the exception of labor unions, there is little clarity in Cath- olic social thought about the contours of the social arrangements needed to mediate the translation between the proclaimed right and the institutional guarantee of the right against standard threats. Without such a guarantee, as Shue notes, "if people are as helpless against ordinary threats as they would be on their own, duties correla- tive to a right are not being performed. People are virtually as vulner- able with their basic rights 'fulfilled' as they are without them. For what people want and need is the protection or deliverance of their rights."66 More attention needs to be paid to the institutional consequences of various proclaimed rights than the Catholic rights tradition to date has done. Hollenbach, himself, notes the breakdown of earlier Catho- 64. Id. at 25. 65. Id. at 33. 66. SHUE, supra note 44, at 33. 362 [Vol. 2</page><page sequence="21">CATHOLIC HUMAN RIGHTS THEOR Y lic corporate models of society and its institutional arrangements which typified an earlier Catholic rights theory. He also contends that while a conflict-free corporate model has lost its plausibility, "no adequate replacement has yet been found."67 He would yield the point in this third challenge to Catholic rights theory. "An accept- ance of a social model which envisions conflict and community as dynamically interrelated would be a major source for the renewal of the Roman Catholic approach to the implementation of human rights."68 2. In his survey of human rights advocacy by the churches in five Latin American countries, Brian Smith argues that, "In no cases . . . have churches been able by themselves to effect major changes in the political and economic structures underlying or caus- ing the violations of civil, social, and economic rights."69 Smith notes that where changes have occurred in patterns of repression (e.g. in Paraguay and Bolivia) this has always occurred in conjunction with and through activity by both religious and secular domestic forces. Smith's observation raises questions and challenges to the church's discernment of alliances, in effective coalition, with secular political forces working for human rights. I have argued elsewhere that many churchmen resist this challenge of strategic alliances (by lending its institutional umbrella to secular groups or working within secular in- stitutions) with secular forces as the necessary precondition for effec- tive, i.e. institutionally guaranteed, implementation of the Catholic vision on human rights.70 FOURTH CHALLENGE: THE CHURCH'S NINETEENTH CENTURY "No" TO HUMAN RIGHTS The final challenge I want to raise to the Catholic human rights theory concerns the strong "no" of the nineteenth century Catholic church to liberal human rights theory in Pius IX's Syllabus of Errors and elsewhere. Usually Catholics and others are simply embarassed by this verdict and avoid any contemporary retrievals of it. Most follow Hollenbach in understanding the "no" as totally time-condi- tioned, to be simply forgotten and surpassed. "The church's own in- stitutional interests and its traditional roots in both pre-modern thought and pre-modern European society were the chief causes of 67. HOLLENBACH, supra note 5, at 160. 68. Id. at 165. 69. Smith, supra note 3, at 183. 70. Cf: J. COLEMAN, AN AMERICA STRATEGIC THEOLOGY264-66. 343] 363</page><page sequence="22">JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION hesitancy."71 In a similar vein, Max Stackhouse simply by-passes the nineteenth century Catholic opposition to liberal rights theory. "Not until the late nineteenth and early twentieth century did Catholicism re-enter the mainstream of Christian history as it bears on questions of human rights."72 I have no intention, in some feat of fancy apolgetics, to rehabili- tate Pius IX's Syllabus of Errors. In some, perhaps many, of its con- demnations of nineteenth century human rights the papacy was, indeed, myopic, time-bound, simply wrong. Nevertheless, following the lead of Gregory Baum, I want to argue that we cannot fully un- derstand the current Catholic human rights tradition if we do not, in some sense, honor the "no" of the nineteenth century church to lib- eral human rights. Baum suggests three reasons for this Catholic "no": 1. The papacy feared that the individualism inherent in liberal human rights theory would undermine social cohesion and the com- mon good, thereby legitimating personal egotism. 2. Catholics feared the relativism in regard to truth which grounded many liberal arguments for civic tolerance and human rights. They resisted indifference to the ultimate unity of truth. 3. The papacy noted the strong connections between economic and political liberalism in the nineteenth century, a connection several recent theorists have argued is still essential to a human rights theory. From a position similar to the Tory radicals in England (also, like the Catholics, tied to medieval or pre-moder world views), Baum contends that Catholics noted that "to announce the rule of freedom in the jungle gives free reign to the predators."73 In an objec- tion similar to nineteenth century socialist thought, the papacy felt that, in a sinful world, claims to freedoms inevitably fell to the advan- tage of the strong. Not enough, it seems to me, has been made of the fact that in initial Catholic social documents on human rights, such as Leo XIII's Rerum Novarum, the Church began with clearer enunciations of socio-economic rights to life, health, food, and shelter than to the more developed political-civil rights. These represented the corer- stone of its rights tradition in the nineteenth century. Then, as now, there was resistance to these rights claims. Even today the American 71.

Baum, supra note 6, at 7. 364 [Vol. 2</page><page sequence="23">CATHOLIC HUMAN RIGHTS THEOR Y bishops in their letter on the economy note how onerous a task it is to create a "cultural consensus that all persons really do have rights in the economic sphere."74 Only a certain empathy toward the church's nineteenth century "no" to liberal human rights theory will allow Catholic thinkers to "find a nonliberal theoretical foundation for the defense of human rights i.e. a theoretical basis that does not promote individualism and undermine social solidarity, does not relativize truth and trivialize the truth question and does not act as a legitima- tion for the free market economy."75 Only such empathy will prevent contamination of the religious rights language by individualistic pre- suppositions and permit a forging of a new language that is clearly neither that of liberal theorists nor Marxists. In this regard, I am struck by how very different, on many points, Max Stackhouse's language sounds from the Catholic human rights tradition. Stackhouse has a much more benign reading of the Puritan-liberal synthesis in America on social thought than other Cal- vinist historians such as Wilson Carey McWilliams. In the ultimate analysis, despite many nuances, Stackhouse agrees with the liberal tradition on the priority of liberty over material need: It has never been a part of this tradition that freedom from want- material resources-comes first. People experience want, some- times severely. More oppressive than the want itself is the denial of the right to give utterance to the need, to be unable to turn to the neighbor and to God and cry out in the despair of suffering to name the oppressor, to teach the reasons for suffering and to re- ceive guidance and courage, consensus and orientation, solidarity and empowerment to remedy the ills. ... In turn, as open discus- sion and genuine religion lead to democratic government, so then the groundwork is laid to deal with want. . . . The defense of freedom of speech and association is thus the prior condition for pursuit by the people of those activities which will meet material needs.76 Henry Shue has rightly labeled "crude and implausible" any global theses that economic rights always take priority over all other rights or that all political rights take priority over all other rights.77 The great achievement of Hollenbach and the Catholic tradition on human rights is that it cuts through the kind of dichotomy be- tween freedom and material need, political versus economic rights, 74.

It will not, I have argued, adequately render an account of its refusal to embrace this dichotomy unless it better understands the initial nineteenth century opposition "no" to liberal human rights language. I will end, as I began, by evoking the notion of icons. However important it is that the Catholic intellectual tradition on human rights squarely face several intellectual challenges to its theoretical coher- ency, more vital is the issue of the churches sacramentalizing human rights by presenting us, transnationally with icons and litanies of real names to anchor our thought on human rights, and to lead us to risk alignment with other groups, such as Amnesty International, working to proclaim, institutionalize and protect human rights from violation. While I do not think that the norm of human dignity is a sufficient theoretical ground for human rights theory, I am convinced that the experience of shock to God's image and the violation of the sacred dignity of humans is the iconic ground to move our imagination to rethink human rights theory, since in the images of human rights being violated we will never lose sight of the ultimate stake in getting our hearts, minds, laws, and institutions straight on this issue. 366 [Vol. 2</page></plain_text>
