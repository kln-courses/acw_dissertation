Power Train Front Axle and Steering of the Renault 16. Fernand L. Picard, Regie Nationale des Usines Renault The complexity of developing automotive design to meet the competitive market demands has necessitated closely coordinated teamwork to solve the various engineering problems. This paper describes the development of the power unit and front axle of the Renault 16, from the initial specifications and engineering decisions through the manufacturing details and performance ratings of the final model. 670002. Autobianchi Primula Transverse Powerplant. Ettore Cordiano, Fiat S.p.A. In the field of average and small-size cars, "Primula" represents the simplest mechanical solution for a front wheel drive and transverse engine arrangement. It was desigted to incorporate the largest possible number of components readily available from current FIAT production stocks. The development of the "Primula" layout is described, including the decisions reached within the framework of the guidelines initially established for its design. 670003. Rootes 54 Cu In. Light Alloy Engine and Transaxle Unit - Design and Development. Leo Ku≈∫micki, Rootes Motors, Humber Ltd. The design and development of a 54 cu in. single overhead camshaft aluminum engine and transaxle for a rear engined vehicle is described. Weight consideration and required performance resulted in the adaption of a light alloy construction. A brief description of the low pressure die casting method is included, and production advantages of both low and high pressure die casting are covered. Constructional considerations in achieving a compact unit are highlighted. 670004. Ford of Britain's Vee Engine Range. Allen Aitken, Ford Motor Co. Ltd. A range of 60 deg V-4 and V-6 engines with four displacements has been developed by Ford of Britain for vehicle application. Some of the features which make these units unique from previous light car engine design include bowl-in-piston combustion chamber, cross-flow cylinder head, individually mounted rocker arms, fixed piston pin, deep skirted cylinder block, closed crankcase ventilation system, throwaway lubricating oil filter, primary balance shaft (on the 4-cylinder version) high efficiency centrifugal type water pump, and water heated intake manifolds and water temperature controlled automatic chokes. An important objective of the development and testing program, namely, minimum need for servicing and attention to parts, was also achieved. 670005. Is Molded Plastisol Meeting Automotive Needs?. H. W. Weinberg and A. F. Reilly, Sheller Mfg. Corp. Plastisol technology with respect to its use in automotive interior trim parts is briefly reviewed. Manufacturing processes are discussed and specific parts in 1968 production are listed. 670006. Engineering Approach to Truck and Tractor Train Stability. Ingobert Schmid, Battelle-Institut e.V. A simplified analysis is made of the directional stability of vehicle combinations, such as a tractor combined with one or two semitrailers or a truck and full trailer. Vehicle combinations are treated as linear dynamic systems with two degrees-of-freedom for each unit. The equations of motion are derived considering the influence of braking and acceleration, and a characteristic equation for traveling at constant speed is obtained. The Routh criteria are examined to distinguish between stability and instability, considering oscillatory and aperiodic motions separately. Special attention is given to the behavior of the vehicle during braking, with discussion of the influence of various design parameters and the distribution of the braking forces applied to the wheels. Finally, a new design of fifth wheel device is presented in order to stabilize tractor-semitrailer combinations. Discussion: S. H. Backaitus; Crysler Corp.; F. Jindra; AC Defense Research Lab., GMC; A. H. Easton; University of Wisconsin; author's closure SA E Transactions 670007. Ignition Delay in Diesel Engines. N. A. Henein and Jay A. Bolt, Michigan Univ. The ignition delay in diesel combustion has been studied in a turbulent chamber engine. The criteria used to define the end of this period are the pressure rise and illumination due to combustion. The pressure rise delay is generally shorter and more reproducible than the illumination delay. The effect of the following factors on the ignition delay were studied: cylinder pressure, fuel/air ratio, fuel injection pressure, cooling water temperature, and engine speed. Data concerning the effect of cylinder pressure on the pressure rise delay period, at constant air temperature, were correlated and compared with previous experimental results. The analysis indicated that the pressure rise delay is affected by physical and chemical factors as well as thermodynamic parameters that control the several forms of energy during the delay period.

A theoretical stress analysis was performed on the crankshaft of a 2-cyl engine using routine engineering calculations, and the results were verified by test. Agreement was satisfactory under controlled operating conditions. Actual service loads were found to be about half as high as the maximum possible. The fatigue strength of production crankshafts was measured in a specially built fixture. About 20-30 percent improvement in fatigue strength could be achieved by shot peening or Tufftride. Discussion: Gary Cloud; Michigan State University; C. R. Goulet; Continental Motors Corp. SAE Transactions 670011. Dimensions of the Traffic Safety Problem. Murray Blumenthal, Travelers Res. Center, Inc. Traffic safety is described as a problem with technological, behavioral, sociological, and value dimensions. Accidents are viewed as "localized system failures," symptomatic of an underlying problem that includes: an imbalance between driver capabilities and the demands of the motor vehicle transportation system; the absence of functional communication between the administrative units respon- sible for the input and functioning of men, vehicles, and environment; and the lack of recognition and resolution of the trade-offs between safety and other desired system outputs and characteristics. 670012. Role of Systems Analysis in Traffic Safety. David M. Boodman, Arthur D. Little Inc. To reduce the losses incurred in motor vehicle operations, all of the factors contributing to the creation of the accident event must be considered. A systematic itemization of these factors indicates that perhaps several hundred environmental, vehicle, and driver factors affect traffic safety. In order to identify the changes which must be made in the interests of improved traffic safety, the techniques of systems analysis can be applied to select those programs which will provide the greatest improv- ement in traffic safety for the effort expended, whether it be in the area of vehicle improvements, roadway improvements, or driver improvements. 670015.

The 1967 Plymouth Barracuda comes in three body styles: fastback, hardtop, and convertible. It has as standard equipment fold-down arm rest bench seats, which allow three people to sit in front. Four engines are available: 225 cu in. 6-cyl version; 273 cu in. 2-barrel carburetor V-8 engine; 27v cu in. 4-barrel carburetor high compression ratio V-8 engine; and 383 cu in. V-8 engine. 670019. Automotive Piston Rings - 1967 State-of-the-Art. Herbert F. Prasse, Harold E. McCormick and Roy D. Anderson, TRW, Inc. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art with respect to compression and oil control ring designs used in 1967 model engines. Specific precautions with regard to details in piston ring specifications for optimum oil control and blowby performance are discussed. For 1967 engines, barrel face piston rings, molydenum piston ring facings, and smoother cylinder bores are being used for improved oil economy and wear performance. New developments in piston ring coatings and materials are reviewed. SA E Transactions 670020. Designing an Automotive Engine Piston. James W. Winship, Bohn Aluminum and Brass Co. This paper is designed to aid and guide the automotive engine designer in selecting a piston design capable of performing satisfactorily with particular requirements. Design parameters relative to clearances, strength, heat flow, and control of expansion are considered. The correlation of these factors to practical foundry practice and production machining requirements is vital to successful design. Guidelines are established for this correlation based on actual practice and experience. A review of new techniques designed to help the piston engineer pretest and outguess the engine is included. Finally, analysis of engine test results and procedures for corrective actions are suggested. SA E Transactions 670021. Analytical Techniques for Designing Riding Quality into Automotive Vehicles. Bruce D. Van Deusen, Chrysler Corp. This paper describes techniques that predict and analyze dynamic response of vehicles traversing random rough surfaces. Road irregularities are statistically classified by frequency and amplitude distribution. This classification determines the nature of random inputs to mathematical vehicle models and allows computer prediction of dynamic response of a simulated vehicle. Once inputs and models are defined, parametric analysis with output criteria specified statistically can be performed. This allows prediction of vehicle riding quality and evaluation of design concepts. Statistical analysis of accelerometer measurements on actual vehicles permits verification of the design process and meaningful comparison between vehicles. Discussion: F. A. Newberry; Ford Motor Co.; author's closure SAE Transactions 670022. Load-Deflection Characteristics of Vehicle Suspension Systems. Donald F. Livermore, Wisconsin Univ. When a stationary automobile is on a horizontal road, the car and its suspension linkages are in static equilibrium under the actions of gravity loading, road reactions, and internal spring forces. When this same system is acted on by steady cornering and/or axial acceleration loads, in addition to gravity loading, the equilibrium configuration of the suspension will be changed substantially from its gravity-load-only condition, affecting the driving characteristics of the automobile. 670023. Ford Aluminum Beaker Test: A New Tool for the Study of ATF Oxidation. B. A. Pearson and J. L. Thompson, Ford Motor Co. A small-scale oxidation test for automatic transmission fluids has been developed. In the test air flow rates, temperature and catalytic activity can be closely controlled at desired levels. A test procedure for screening automatic transmission fluids is described. Data are presented illustrating the ability of the test to distinguish between different levels of oxidation resistance, the repeatability of the test, and the correlation achieved thus far with a presently used full-scale transmission oxidation test. 670025. Post Office Vehicle Crash Study. James C. Gilkey, United States Post Office Dept.; and Robert A. Rogers, General Motors Corp. A comprehensive test program has been carried out to study the indicated effectiveness of personnel restraining devices in reducing injuries and fatalities in post office vehicle accidents. The program consisted of a series of simulated vehicle crashes utilizing a dynamic impact sled and three actual crash tests of postal vehicles. The seating configurations and restraint systems of the three types of postal vehicles were tested on the impact sled with an anthropomorphic dummy simulating the vehicle driver. Crash tests were simulated at various speeds, g levels, and angles of impact, with accelerometers and high speed motion picture cameras used to monitor the significant variables observed during each impact test. At the conclusion of the simulated testing, a full-scale barrier impact test was conducted on each of the three types of vehicles under study. Certain changes in restraint system installations have already been initiated as a result of the information gained from these tests. 67</page><page sequence="5">670026-670033 670026. Temperature Telemetry Technique for Recip- rocating Engines. G. C. Lawrason and W. L. Rollwitz, Southwest Research Inst. A need for an accurate and reliable method of measuring temperature at critical points in and around reciprocating parts has arisen with the development of reciprocating engines. A unique system has been devised to measure and telemeter critical temperatures of reciprocating engine components. A prototype has been used to measure the piston pin bearing temperature in a full-scale EMD 2-567D diesel engine SA E Transactions 670027. Ultrasonic Method of Measuring Piston Ring Bore-Contact Patterns. Ted Rudy, Perfect Circle Corp. A new method for detecting the shape of a piston ring has been developed. The method uses the magnitude of a surface wave ultrasonic echo to plot the quality of the contact between a piston ring and a gage bore on a polar graph. The testing method and the results are discussed for single-piece and multi-piece rings, and for various surface treatments utilized in automotive piston rings. 670028. Integrated Data Acquisition Safety Monitoring, and Control System for Automated Tests. Vern C. Vanderbilt, Jr., William Van Ostrand and Clarence L. Zimmer, Dynamic Precision Controls Corp.

A new type of specialized digital computer and data logger is described and examples given of engine parameter computations. 670029. Evaluating Scavenging Efficiency of Two-Stroke Cycle Gasoline Engines. Richard R. Booy, Outboard Marine Corp. Two experimental methods for determining scavenging efficiency of an operating two-stroke cycle spark ignition engine are discussed and compared. They are the gas sampling technique and the spark interruption technique. Necessary apparatus and instrumentation are described, as well as the method of operation. 670030. Effect of Crankcase Volume and the Inlet System on the Delivery Ratio of Two-Stroke Cycle Engines. Fujio Nagao, Kyoto Univ.; and Yuzuru Shimamoto, Okayama Univ. Increasing the air charge of crankcase scavenged two-stroke cycle engines is essential for improved performance. Accordingly, the crankcase volume and dimensions of the inlet system were experimentally investigated in order to fully utilize the dynamic effect of both the exhaust and inlet systems with a view towards increasing the delivery ratio. To achieve full utilization of the effect of the inlet system, it was found that the time-area of the inlet port should be far larger than that considered for the usual engine. The drop in delivery ratio caused by increasing the crankcase volume can be fairly well compensated for by tuning the exhaust and inlet systems. Discussion: P. H.

Hydell, Allison Div., GMC A working system of peak to valley surface roughness control has been developed and is in use on selected aerospace production hardware. The system, while similar to the Swedish H system, has additional flexibility for the design engineer. A test in which seven companies participated proved the compatibility of roughness values obtained. 670032. New Technique for Classifying Random Surface Roughness. Bruce D. Van Deusen and Gerald E. McCarron, Chrysler Corp. Present techniques for classification and analysis of surface roughness are based on a trace of surface profile, or a measure of arithmetic mean, or rms value of the profile height, but this information is not adequate, and a new technique has been developed to classify surface roughness based on frequency content of the variance of the surface profile. A digital computer frequency filter has been devised to allow differentiation between roughness height and waviness or general surface contour. Three representative surfaces have been measured and classified according to this analysis and data are presented in support for roughness classification techniques. SAE Transactions 670033. (SP-284) Engine Cooling Systems for Motor Trucks. P. K. Beatenbough, Harrison Radiator Div., GMC Design practices and principles for motor truck engine cooling systems are discussed.

Kroell, General Motors Res. Labs. An analytical study of right angle barrier crashes has been conducted to evaluate the influence of vehicle crush distance, occupant spacing, and interior crush stiffness on the severity of occupant-interior impact. Particular attention was directed to the influence of the vehicle deceleration-time history wave shape. The study includes an analysis of a simple-point occupant and a more complicated articulated dummy. The results of these analyses are in substantial agreement and indicate that the most important factors in reducing unrestrained occupant impact severity in conventional vehicles are occupant spacing, vehicle crush distance, and interior crush stiffness. Because of practical considerations and the multiplicity of crash conditions, it is concluded that the most direct way to reduce injury and death is through improved vehicle interior crush behavior. SAE Transactions 670038. Stopping the Occupant of a Crashing Vehicle - Fundamental Study. Adolf Egli, Ford Motor Co. Occupant motion in a head-on collision is studied through classical solutions of a two-degree-of-freedom mathematical model simulating a colinear vehicle-occupant system. Stoppage of the elastically restrained occupant by general system tuning is demonstrated. Analysis of the system behavior over a range of initial vehicle speeds brings out the fundamental differences due to elastic and inelastic occupant restraint and due to changes of character of vehicle front end collapse. Consideration of practical application of the conclusions, generally, should be limited to systems with well harnessed occupants. SAE Transactions 670039. General Motors Energy Absorbing Column. Donald P. Marquis, Saginaw Steering Gear Div., GMC While the collision of cars is not an exact sciennnce, the 1967 General Motors energy absorbing steering column shows what can be done in one area to improve the finished product through the achievement of a sequence of design goals. It is felt that, based on tests of a great number of vehicles, the energy absorbing column will definitely improve the driver's chances of survival in a significant range of head-on collision conditions. 670040. School Bus Passenger Protection. Derwyn M. Severy, Harrison M. Brink and Jack D. Baird, California Univ. Three full-scale collision experiments involving a school bus were conducted using research techniques and engineering methodology designed to provide realistic and objective findings relating to school bus passenger safety. The experiments conducted were: a head-on collision between two fully loaded, moderate-sized school buses, each traveling 30 mph; a stationary bus rear-ended by a passenger car traveling 60 mph; a stationary bus impacted on its right side by a passenger car traveling 60 mph. The following categories relating to passenger injury causation were studied: location and type of impact, structural integrity of vehicles, vehicle size, seat design, type of restraint or force moderator, type of safety glass, passenger size, standing versus seated passengers, passenger kinematics and interactions, forces sustained by passengers and many related factors. Electronic instrumentation consisted of 61 transducers positioned in the anthropometric dummy passengers, on the safety belts and on the vehicles to record accelerations and forces during collision. Photographic instrumentation included 33 high-speed motion picture cameras and special photographic devices that were arranged within, around and above the colliding vehicles to provide detailed observation of all aspects of these collision experiments. SAE Transactions 670041. How do Phosphate Coatings Reduce Wear on Moving Parts. W. R. Cavanagh, Parker Rust Proof Co. The benefits provided by phosphate coatings in reducing wear are ascribed to the controlled etching of the surface subjected to wear. Through tests it appears that the manganese phosphate coating is the most effective application, the reason being the number of larger pits formed by manganese phosphate and the greater amount of phosphate retained in these pits. Chemical reactions involved in the production of these coatings are reviewed together with a comparison of the reactions involved in some of the common phosphate coating baths. The effect of treatment of metal surface prior to coating and the type of coating bath used are compared by examining the coatings as produced and after burnishing. These coatings have been reported to provide wear resistance by removing surface irregularities after machining and lapping, increasing lubricating efficiency, and preventing welding under loads.

Brown, Perfect Circle Corp. 69</page><page sequence="7">670043-670050 The characteristic wear of electroplated chromium on piston rings has changed over the past 15 years. The reasons for the change are discussed and a theory proposed for the wear mechanism.

Herider, Rockwell-Standard Corp., Res. and Dev. Div.; and William F. Le Fevre, Consulting Engr. This is a two part paper on the considerations involved in truck seating design. The first part discusses physiological factors of seating comfort which are essentially static in comparison to requirements for vibration isolation discussed in the second part. Basically, a truck driver's seat should be designed to furnish the most in driver seating comfort within bounds of reasonable cost. Improved safety is gained by reducing muscular and nervous tensions which, in turn, reduce physical fatigue. The ability of the chair to isolate the driver from vibrations influences riding comfort. While the proper chair design can isolate high frequency, low amplitude vibrations the lower frequency, high amplitude chassis pitch vibrations can best be controlled by proper vehicle suspension systems, thus providing optimum riding comfort. 670044. Modern Development of Mechanical Spring Truck Seating. A. W. Moesta, Jr., Mclnerney Spring and Wire Co. Through continuing and realistic innovations in concept, design, and testing, mechanical spring seating in trucks has vastly improved in recent years. Development of modern truck seats begins with the original seat package layout derived from the cab package. Then the details covering seat frame design are worked out so that prototype models can be received by the truck manufacturer at least a year in advance of model production in order to provide adequate test, development, ride, and refinement time. Numerous and comprehensive laboratory and road vehicle tests are conducted to insure that the best seat is made available for the intended truck, with comfortable seating for the occupant at an economical cost. 670046. Ignition and Battery Charging with Permanent Magnet Alternators. T. Frazer Carmichael, Syncro Corp. The permanent magnet alternator as applied to automotive battery charging and portable engine service is discussed. Manufacturing procedure, magnetic material selections, and regulation means are described. Output characteristics of several alternators are presented. Ignition on portable engines using the alternator is described. 670047. Growing Power in a Growing Market. E. L. Fisher and D. J. Wahlen, Kohler Co. The evolution of Kohler engines is discussed, particularly with respect to the higher horsepower engines used in suburban power equipment. Bore and stroke, horsepower and torque, valve timing, volumetric efficiency, cooling, and crankshaft design are some of the areas explored. The author treats Automatic Compression Release extensively, and concludes that this mechanism eliminates the necessity of a spark retard mechanism, simplifies choking, reduced cost because less costly magnetos of single magnet construction may be used, and easy cold weather starting, to cite a few advantages. 670048. Rolling Element Bearings in Passenger Car Automatic Transmissions - 1967 Edition. J. R. Hull, Torrington Co. The material is an updating of a 1961 paper, "Rolling Element Bearings in Passenger Car Automatic Trans- missions" by R. H. White (paper 359F). This "1967 Edition" has been changed only where necessary to reflect current theory and practice. Passenger car automatic transmissions have two major sections, a hydraulic torque converter and a planetary or epicyclic gear box. This paper will first discuss the radial bearings in the planet gears and then discuss the thrust bearings used in both the hydraulic converter and geared sections of the transmission. Discussion: R.

Kinematic features of acceleration and deceleration are depicted on a graph. The analysis presented will aid in the determination of proper involute and lead modifications required to weaken sound. It also presents a wear pattern determined by lead and involute specifications. SAE Transactions 670051. Putting Automatic Transmission Clutch Friction Researchers on Speaking Terms. G. R. Smith, General Motors Corp.; W. D. Ross, Ford Motor Co.; P. L. Silbert, Chrysler Corp.; and W. B. Herndon, General Motors Corp. With the object of improving the technique of testing and specifying friction materials, a new type of friction material test fixture has been developed by the SA E Friction Subcommittee. This is a completely self-contained machine especially designed for cyclic testing and quality control work. This does not replace, but rather supplements, the steady state type friction test fixture (SAE No. 1) previously developed by the committee. This fixture, known as the SAE No. 2 test fixture, is designed to test clutch packs in an environment which is as close as possible to that of the friction elements in an automatic transmission. Both friction material manufacturers and users are employing this machine for quality control, component selection, and evaluation of friction materials and lubricants. 670052. (SP-285) Liquefied Petroleum Gas for Engines - LP-Gas Fuel Systems Affect Engine Per- formance. R. A. Mengelkamp and A. C. Hudson, Phillips Petroleum Co. Laboratory dynamometer studies indicate that some, if not most, commercially available carburetors and related fuel systems offered for large automotive LP-gas fueled engines do not provide optimum air-fuel ratios throughout their normal range of operating speeds and loads. Such deficiencies in carburetion have an unfavorable effect on the apparent performance of LP-gas as a motor fuel, especially with respect to relative fuel economies when compared to those experienced with liquid fuels. 670053. (SP-285) Liquefied Petroleum Gas for Engines - Engine-Fuel Relationships with LP-Gas and Natural Gas. Gordon J. Kuivanen, Rolland O. Westra and Dallas G. Lien, Minneapolis-Moline, Inc. Several parameters of engine-fuel relationships with leaded and unleaded LP-gas and natural gas are discussed. Performance factors include the effect of carbureted gaseous fuels on observed and corrected volumetric efficiency. Emphasis was placed on the knock-limited spark advance characteristics as a function of engine speed for all fuels tested at engine compression ratios of 9.1 and 10.6. Results showed that the knock-limited spark advance increased with decreasing engine speed with both LP-gas and natural gas fuels. The amount of change or increase appeared to be related to both fuel types and relative fuel octane quality as referenced to the engine requirement. 670054. (SP-285) Liquefied Petroleum Gas for Engines - A Superior Motor Fuel. Milton C. Baxter, Cities Service Oil Co. A six-cylinder regular fuel automotive engine was operated on both LP-gas and gasoline. Power, economy, air-fuel ratio control, spark advance characteristics, and exhaust hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide levels were obtained with both fuels over a wide range of steady-state cyclic operating conditions. Significant improvements in economy and air pollution emissions occurred with LP-gas compared to gasoline at virtually all operating conditions. A system was developed to use the heat of vaporization of LP-gas to eliminate wide open throttle power loss. Unusually low levels of exhaust hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide were obtained by the use of a nonstandard LP-gas idle setting. Discussion: K. Boldt; Union Oil Co. of California; G. J.

Kenneth Boldt, Union Oil Co. of California Work has been completed in ASTM Committee D-2, Research Division I, on a knock test method for rating gaseous fuels at a severity level approximating that found in full scale engines. The method for gaseous fuels, Motor (LP) method, is a modification of the Motor methods D 357-65 and D 1948-65 used for liquid fuels. The precision of the Motor (LP) method is comparable to that found for liquid fuels. Additionally, the Motor (LP) method had been used to provide octane numbers for the individual hydrocarbons found in typical LPG fuels and a method has been developed for calculating the octane numbers of LP-gas fuels when their hydrocarbon composition is known. 670056. (SP-285) Liquefied Petroleum Gas for Engines - Effects of Inlet- Air Temperature and Humidity on Performance of an LP-Gas Engine. W. L. Harris and J. W. Hummel, Maryland Univ. Some effects of controlling temperature and humidity of the inlet air on the maximum power output of an LP-gas engine were determined. The humidity had no significant effect; however, by decreasing the air-fuel mixture temperature an increase in power was obtained. The thermal efficiency of the engine was significantly affected by the temperature of the fuel leaving the regulator. The data presented could contribute to the development of a carburetion system to obtain higher performance from engines converted to burn LP-gas. 71</page><page sequence="9">670057-670064 670057. (SP-285) Liquefied Petroleum Gas for Engines - Some Effects of Altitude on LP-Gas Tractor Operation. G. M. Galster and J. S. Pigott, Champion Spark Plug Co. Spark plug thermal characteristics were investigated for both propane and butane at various altitudes. These tests show that under ordinary conditions, if the correct spark plug heat range is installed at sea level, the selection does not need to be changed for higher altitude operation. Operating spark plug temperatures were lower with butane as compared with propane and may warrant, in some instances, a hotter heat range. Knock-limited spark advance increased with altitude, but decreased with increasing compression ratios. There is no significant spark plug voltage requirement change under running conditions, as altitude is increased from roughly sea level to 8000 ft. 670058. (SP-285) Liquefied Petroleum Gas for Engines - Carburetion and Other Factors which Affect Propane Fueled Engines. W. S. Blalock and R. N. Little, Borg-Warner Corp., Marvel-Schebler Div. Many propane conversions result in less than optimum performance because of a lack of information concerning variables and their resultant effect on engine performance, economy, and durability. Factors such as carburetor size, air-fuel ratio, spark advance, air cleaner restriction, exhaust back pressure, intake manifold heat, voltage requirements, spark plug selection and gap, riser height and design, and carburetor orientation are examined to increase the basic understanding of this fuel. 670059. Rotor-Bearing-Dynamics of High-Speed Turbo- machinery. Beno Sternlicht, Mechanical Tech- nology, Inc. This paper discusses the influence of rolling element and fluid film bearings on rotor dynamics of "high-speed" turbomachinery. System critical speeds, rotor response to unbalance, instability, and turbulence are discussed. The types of fluid film bearings best suited for high-speed operation are identified. Examples of high-speed turbomachinery using rolling element, liquid film and gas bearings are presented. SAE Transactions 670060. Rolling Bearing Selection for Turbine Engines. P. S. Given, SKF Industries, Inc. Conventional calculations for rolling bearing application are not sufficiently accurate to satisfy the conditions of the speed and temperature environment of turbine engines. Abetted by high speed computers, modern rolling bearing analysis permits the more sophisticated optimization of rolling bearing selection, mounting and lubrication. A logical analysis and practical approach to bearing selection is presented using a typical turbine-driven power shaft as a model. 670061. Nonlinear Vibration Damping Functions for Fluid Film Bearings. Homer J. Wood, Power- Dynetics, Inc. Curve-fitting functions are combined with transfer functions and special parameter groupings to demonstrate that amplitude-limiting effects of hydrodynamic bearings on vibrations associated with critical speeds of flexible rotors are due to nonlinear characteristics. It is shown that stable and/or critically-damped operation can be achieved by designing bearings within proper ranges of a "dynamic load number" and controlling unbalance expressed as a principal axis deviation related to clearance. The form of the attitude angle function is shown to be particularly significant with respect to unbalance tolerance. Practical application techniques are illustrated. SAE Transactions 670062. Circumferential Seal: Its Application, Its Place in the Seal Spectrum Relative to Gas Turbines. John A. Heck, Koppers Co., Inc. Application of circumferential seals has shown this type of bore contact seal to have practically unlimited axial travel, to be an essentially fail-safe device, and to require minimal space requirements. Problems involving residual unbalance and sensitivity to pressure direction and fluid environment are examined, and steps that may alleviate such difficulties associated with circumferential seals are described. 670063. Design and Application of Plain Journal Bearings to Small Gas Turbine Engines. Donald L. Carriere, Ford Motor Co. A design technique for applying pressure-lubricated plain journal bearings to small gas turbine engines is described in this paper. Design charts, failure criteria, and the concept of a load-speed diagram are presented for both film and boundary lubrication conditions, along with data on the successful application of journal bearings in the Ford Model 705 gas turbine engine. SAE Transactions 670064. Shaft, Bearing and Seal Systems for a Small Engine. Richard P. Shevchenko, United Aircraft Corp., Pratt and Whitney Aircraft Key mechanical difficulties inherent in designing shaft, bearing, and seal systems for three desirable types of small gas turbine engines are discussed. The bearing, shaft, and seal system of a family of large turbine engines which has demonstrated its high reliability, high efficiency, and low cost per unit of power is described. Three different solutions to the problems (for radically different applications) are offered. The first and second solutions are for sophisticated, efficient engines for weapon systems consideration (Types I and II). Solution three describes a potential industrial, low cost, high efficiency, moderately heavy engine (Type III). A summary is made of the key shaft, bearing, or seal 72</page><page sequence="10">670065-670073 problems which must be overcome for each of the three types of engines described. 670065. Ford GT Sports Car. R. C. Lunn, Ford Motor Co. Development of the Ford GT Sports car from the Mustang I required analyses in the following areas: Aerodynamics; engine, transafle, drive-shafts; body; suspension, steering, brakes, wheels; interior, driver environment; and fuel system. Discussion covers the original concept sketch of the GT 40, various models and prototypes, and the final layout of components for the Mark II car, which won at Daytona in 1966, and the XI car (an open version of the Mark II with an aluminum underbody), which won at Sebring in 1966. 670066. Mark II - 427 GT Engine. Joseph F. Macura and Jonathan Bowers, Ford Motor Co. The Mark II Ford 427 cu in. displacement GT engine used in the 1966 Le Mans race was a modified version of the 1966 High-Performance production 427. Major changes from the standard version included the use of aluminum cylinder heads, "dry-sump" lubrication system, new carburetor, aluminum water pump, tran- sitorized ignition, special flywheel, an aluminum front cover, and a magnesium oil pan. These changes, along with various design refinements, were made to meet particular demands imposed by vehicle design, race regulations, endurance requirements, and vehicle per- formance characteristics. 670067. Mark II - 427 GT Engine Induction System. A. O. Rominsky, Ford Motor Co. Among the factors attributable to Ford's success at Le Mans, France in 1966 is the high efficiency air induction system of the 427 GT engine. Contrary to the basic design parameters of passenger car engine induction systems, which consider part-throttle transistions and fuel economy, induction systems for high speed, high-output competitive engines are quite the opposite. These engines demand maximum airflow capacity, and equal balance of air/fuel mixture to each cylinder to insure high efficiency throughout the engine speed range under full-throttle conditions. SA E Transactions 670068. Mark II-GT Ignition and Electrical System. Robert C. Hogle, Ford Motor Co. The development of a reliable electrical system for the Mark II-GT sports racing car recognized vibration as a major cause of failure. Subsystems discussed include: Wiring system; generating and starting system; electric fuel pumps; windshield wiper system; lighting system; and ignition system. 670069. Mark II-GT Transaxles. H. L. Gregorich and C. D. Jones, Ford Motor Co. The transaxle used in the Ford Mark II-GT sports-racing car is described. The functional requirements, as established by a simulated Le Mans dynamometer test cycle, are summarized through integration of the engine torque and speed data and compared with gear and bearing design parameters to reflect their capacities in hours of Le Mans usage. The areas where the development work was particularly important are highlighted. 670070. Mark II GT Sports Car Disc Brake System. Joseph J. Ihnacik, Jr. and Jerome F. Meek, Ford Motor Co. The design and development of Mark II GT brake system within the parameters dictated by the Mark I chassis presented many problems. The Mark II GT with its larger 427 cu in. engine had more weight and much higher performance than the Mark I. Space limitations of the carryover wheels and suspension imposed a severe handicap on individual brake component design. This was compounded by shortening the normal one year development time to a three month period. The factors which control the design of a brake, the concept of kinetic energy, and its effects on brake performance are reviewed briefly. Use of the ventilated rotor design is explained for applications where severe heat is a problem, as in the case of the Mark II GT. The development of the brake system from the 24 hr Daytona endurance race to the Le Mans Grand Prix race is reviewed. The unique rotor problems resulting from the various energy loads experienced at Daytona, Sebring and Le Mans are analyzed. The brake dynamometer, its automatic programmer and the logic of race simulation duty cycle are described. Use of the Ford Reliability Laboratory brake dynamometer for screening of potential rotor designs is explained. In the screening process, dynamometer results proved that significant brake development work can be performed in a laboratory where a race can be simulated under carefully controlled conditions. 670071. Laboratory Simulation, Mark II-GT Powertrain. B. F. Brender, C. J. Canever, I. J. Monti and J. R. Johnson, Ford Motor Co. Laboratory simulation of the powertrain for the Ford Mark II-GT sports-racing car included simulation of the same speeds, loads, and times that are experienced in the Le Mans race. Two proposed powertrains were tested: (1) A Mark II car with a 427 cu in. displacement engine and a Ford designed four-speed standard transmission and axle and (2) A "J" car with a 427 cu in. engine and a Ford-designed two-speed automatic transmission and axle. 670073. Technique of Electron Irradiation Curing of Coatings. Kennard H. Morganstern, Radiation Dynamics, Inc. Representing a radical departure from the two-element system of painting and/or coating (solids dispersed or 73</page><page sequence="11">670074-670081 74 dissolved in a suitable carrier) is a single-element system in which the coating material system is its own carrier with no solvent required. The radiation cure technique, discussed in this paper, has substantial merit for reasons such as rapidity of curing speed, lower cost of material and operation, and applicability to substrates which are sensitive to heat. 670074. Plastisol Coatings as Packaging Material. Jack S. Panzer and Robert Jurczyszyn, Wyandotte Paint Prod. Co. Packaging Plastisols are liquid polyvinyl chloride dispersions which can be applied by conventional means such as spraying, dipping, and flow coating. They can be applied in film thickness of 2-300 mils and can be made to foam to give strippable coatings ranging from a soft resilient type to a hard tough type. However, they must be fused at 300-350 F. Plastisols have advantages of saving much space and labor. Also, they are fire retardant and resistant to exterior and chemical atmospheres. Parts can be coated, fused, and stacked in times ranging 3-10 minutes. 670075. Weldable Lead Phosphate ... Its Properties and Use. L. D. Barrett, International Rustproof Co. A new phosphate coating for steel - lead phosphate - has been developed. Unlike other phosphate coatings, lead phosphate does not impair the weldability of the steel substrate. In addition to this important and valuable property, a lead phosphate coating can be formed on steel near room temperature by a simple, single pass spray technique. This type of coating, properly applied, affords good protection against rust, reduces friction in drawing operations, yields an excellent base for electrocoating systems, and is highly resistant to removal by all but the strongest alkalis and mineral acids. SAE Transactions 670076. Perspective - Correlation of Laboratory, Proving Ground, and Customer Testing. W. G. Dixon and G. J. Kuchera, Ford Motor Co. Reduction of lead time between design and production is possible through application of modern test techniques. Such techniques involve accurate measurement of customer service load cycle and application of these measured loads to the laboratory and proving ground. Correlation of customer usage with "in house" testing is essential to a realistic projection of test results into anticipated service life. 670078. Influence of Vehicle Design Parameters on Characteristic Speed and Understeer. R. Thomas Bundorf, General Motors Corp. Vehicle understeer is rigorously defined and discussed as it pertains to directional control of an automobile. Methods are presented for predicting understeer quality in proposed vehicle designs and for measuring understeer quality in existing vehicles. The methods make possible complete and accurate quantitative descriptions of vehicle understeer. Discussion: A. G. Fonda; Giannini Controls Corp.; author's closure SAE Transactions 670079. New Laboratory Friction and Wear Test for the Characterization of Brake Linings. A. E. Anderson, Serge Gratch and Hayden P. Hayes, Ford Motor Co. A compact new laboratory friction and wear test machine has been developed. Test procedures have been established for this machine in a constant output (that is, constant friction force) mode of operation. These procedures have been shown to be particularly well suited for quality control of brake lining materials. The test, designated Friction Assessment Screening Test (FAST) has been shown to yield highly reproducible results which correlate well with vehicle performance. The results are highly sensitive to those variations in brake lining properties which are most significant in brake performance. SAE Transactions 670080. New Chemical Test for the Characterization of Organic Brake Linings - Pyrolytic Gas Chroma- tography. Roy L. Gealer and Bobby H. Biggers, Ford Motor Co. Pyrolytic gas chromatography (PGC) has been applied to the characterization of the organic constituents of brake linings. The test involves the pyrolysis of a sample followed by the instrumental separation and sensing of the products of decomposition. A study of experimental variables, such as pyrolysis temperature, has allowed the selection of conditions which yield excellent reproducibility and sensitivity. The preferred test conditions, which have been incorporated in Ford's brake lining quality control specifications, result in a relatively rapid, meaningful test for constancy of composition. 670081. Review of Progress with Some Recently Developed Techniques for Friction Material Evaluation. A. R. Spencer and W. M. Spurgeon, Bendix Corp., Bendix Res. Labs. Establishment of a new quality control test involves four phases: (I) test development; (II) determination of the natural limits of the test data for the manufacturing process; (III) negotiation of specification limits; (IV) correlation of the specification limits with service tests, and improvement of the manufacturing process to make new natural limits coinciding with the specification limits. Development of an integrated set of quality control tests for automotive brake linings (Phase I) was reported earlier. In a continuation of Phase I on differential thermal analysis, it was found that temperatures of some DTA peaks for linings are pressure sensitive. Hence, good pressure control is necessary in using this test. It was also found that differential thermal analysis gives useful information on the state of lining binder</page><page sequence="12">670082-670089 cure. A statistical test plan for rapid estimation of natural process limits (Phase II) is described and illustrated with differential thermal analysis data. SAE Transactions 670082. American Motors Typhoon V-8 Engines. Robert A. Petersen and Carl E. Burke, American Motors Corp. The new American Motors Typhoon V-8 engines are lighter in weight and smaller in physical size than the units they replace. However, they produce more power and have superior durability characteristics. They have been designed to be manufactured in the most modern and efficient manner. 670083. Buick's New V-8 Engines. C. G. Studaker, Buick Motor Div., GMC Since the introduction of the first Buick V-8 engine of 322 cu in. displacement in 1953, the trend has been toward larger engines. The practical displacement limitation of this design was reached in 1964 with the 425 cu in. engine. A new engine program was initiated to provide flexibility for meeting the requirements of an expanded line of vehicles and to take advantage of advances in manufacturing technology. Two. displacements were selected for Buick's new V-8 engines, 400 cu in. and 430 cu in. Objectives realized: increased breathing potential; smoother, quieter operation; improved durability; and simplification for improved manufacturing and service. The basic engine design included provisions for future requirements as well as provisions for readily adapting to modern combustion systems for exhaust emission control. 670084. Plastic Fiber Optics. Thomas C. Hager, Robert G. Brown and Burton N. Derick, E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. Plastic fiber optics have been developed which possess excellent light transmission characteristics. The basic theory which explains this phenomenon of light transmission through plastic fibers and certain physical properties which characterize the utility of Crofon plastic fiber optics are discussed. Particular emphasis is placed on optical properties. In addition, mention is made of plastic fiber end finishing techniques, accessory fittings, and applications. SAE Transactions 670085. Application of Plastic Fiber Optics to Automobiles. R. A. Meade, Packard Elee. Div., GMC The availability of plastic fiber optics light-energy- transmitting material in long continuous lengths has made possible its use in automotive lighting and remote indicating systems. This paper presents a general history of the program and a discussion of the current applications and future possibilities. Also, the paper outlines some of the benefits to be gained by the use of fiber optics and guides for its application. 670086. New Developments in Automotive Lighting. K. J. Jones, Joseph Lucas Electrical Ltd. Some of the problems in lighting and signaling equipment which have yet to receive satisfactory solutions are considered. In the case of signaling lamps, it is suggested that two level signals be used to obtain adequate signaling by day and by night, and that the fields of visibility of direction indicators be extended. In the headlighting field, the main problem is that of obtaining better performance from lower beams, and it would seem that radical re-thinking is necessary in order to obtain the appreciable improvement which the problem necessitates. 670087. Automatic Control of Asphalt Paver Machines. R. C. Flom, Honeywell, Inc., Apparatus Controls Div. One of the more recent areas where automation has been used to accomplish improved results over those obtained by manual operation is in the bituminous paving industry. The application of automatic grade and slope control systems to the modern floated screed asphalt paver dramatically evidences the higher level of paving efficiencies and better riding roads normally expected when electronics augment the human operator. The control systems are rugged, reliable, easily operated, and low cost in relation to economics of operation. 670088. Handyman to Hardiman. Ralph S. Mosher, General Elee. Co. Man and machine can be combined into an intimate, symbiotic unit that will perform essentially as one wedded system. This Cybernetic Anthropomorphous Machine (CAM) will respond to irregular force and position patterns with the alacrity of man's information and control system coupled with the machine's power and ruggedness. A new and exciting area for the application of this control technique is in earthmoving and material-handling equipment. SAE Transactions 670089. Measuring the Total Hydrocarbons in Diesel Exhaust. H. W. Pearsall, General Motors Res. Labs. In order to simulate diesel exhaust of known composition, weighed amounts of various high-boiling hydrocarbons were evaporated into a stream of heated air. These mixtures were sampled continuously and the hydrocarbon contents measured with a heated flame ionization detector (FID). The evaporator unit and FID were operated at various temperatures and 375 F was optimum as regards percentage of input material accounted for (85-100 percent, for paraffins through CI 6), fast response, and repeatability. The FID was then used at various temperatures to measure total hydro- carbons in exhaust from a 1-cyl diesel engine. Again, 375 F was optimum for obtaining maximum apparent hydrocarbon concentration, fast response, and re- 75</page><page sequence="13">670090-670096 76 peatability. Finally, FID measurements were obtained at 375 F on exhaust from the engine at various operating conditions, to assess the effects of operating variables on hydrocarbons. Increasing compression ratio and tem- peratures of the inlet air and crankcase oil were effective ways of lowering hydrocarbons. Some principles for valid sampling and measurement of diesel exhaust hydrocarbons are discussed. 670090. Diesel Engine Exhaust Smoke - Its Measurement, Regulation and Control. N. M. F. Vulliamy and J. Spiers, Perkins Mfg. Co. Density of exhaust smoke from a diesel engine is a sensitive indication of engine overload and fuel economy. The various lines of development of smokemeters are outlined. It is concluded that, with closely controlled maintenance, calibration, installation, and operating procedures, the two meters most commonly used in Europe are capable of giving adequate results under full-load steady-state testing conditions. A completely new appproach to instrumentation for measurement of vehicle smoke emission under road or variable speed conditions is needed if satisfactory rapid test methods are to be evolved. 670091. Diesel Fuel Properties and Exhaust Gas - Distant Relations?. G. McConnell and H. E. Howells, British Petroleum Co., Ltd. This paper examines the question of whether or not significant improvements in the condition of a diesel engine's exhaust can be practically achieved by altering the quality of the fuel. Engine test results from a variety investigations are presented, and they are examined on a fuel quality/exhaust quality basis. Black smoke, white smoke, odor, oxides of nitrogen, and carbon monoxide are the exhaust constituents discussed in conjunction with fuel volatility, viscosity, and ignition quality. It is suggested that a change in base fuel quality is not, at present, a practical means of insuring an improvement in exhaust condition. Discussion: D. K. Lawrence; American Oil Co.; authors' closure SAE Transactions 670092. Diesel Engine Exhaust Smoke: The Influence of Fuel Properties and the Effects of Using Barium-Containing Fuel Additive. D. W. Golothan, Shell Intl. Petroleum Co., Ltd. Even though the combustion gases of diesel fuel are much less toxic than those of gasoline, exhaust smoke has increased proportionately with the number of diesels in use and has become a major problem. This paper describes the influence of base fuel composition on smoke, and the results of using a barium-containing additive in the fuel. The toxicological aspects of using the additive are considered, together with certain other side effects that might arise. Details are also given of the various means for measuring smoke, and of existing legislation to control the nuisance. Discussion: D. K. Lawrence; American Oil Co.; A. H.

Included herein are a discussion of the need for concurrent evaluation of new manufacturing methods with initial engine design to produce a lower priced gas turbine engine; an exploration of the use and value of cost comparison for various approaches plus the importance of market analysis and sales forecast; and an investigation the cost of fabricated parts versus investment cast parts, using the latest manufacturing techniques and equipment. Examples are supplemented by percentage figures and illustrations. SAE Transactions 670095. Fabrication of Small Gas Turbine Compressor Blades by Precision Rolling. Herbert L. Albro, Kelsey-Hayes Co., Utica Div. Precision rolling of gas turbine compressor blades for use in aircraft and stationary engines is a reality. This manufacturing process has been used to produce blades of various types of metal, many being rolled at room temperature, others requiring preheating. It also offers an economical method of manufacturing huge quantities of parts of the same design. The most outstanding features of precision rolling is the repeatability of the process. 670096. Numerically Controlled Milling for Making Experimental Turbomachinery. Mason K. Yu, General Motors Res. Lab.; and Charles A. Amann, General Motors Res. Labs. Utilization of numerically controlled milling has been found particularly attractive in producing, in limited quantities, the three-dimensional curved surfaces character- istic of turbomachinery. In experimental and develop- mental programs its use can result in decreased fabrication cost, reduced lead time, and improved dimensional accuracy. Following a review of the general classifications of numerically controlled milling machines available for manufacture of such parts, illustrations are given of some of the procedures and techniques employed in their use. A variety of parts made using numerical control serve as examples. SAE Transactions</page><page sequence="14">670098-670107 670098. Advanced Aerospace Metals Deformation Tech- nology. Henry A.

Taming the Radio Transmitters Under Your Hood - Ignition Suppression Updated. F. Bauer, Ford Motor Co. Two-way radio supplanting television as the commu- nication system that must be protected from vehicular interference. Because the electrical phenomena of this type of interference involve almost every portion of the vehicle, spurous radiation is a topic of serious concern to engine, chassis, and body engineers as well as those in the radio engineering field. This paper covers briefly the history of SAE involvement in determining standards to solve the problem, newly discovered facts concerning ignition emission of signals, and methods presently used to counteract their effects on communication channels.

A new era in the history of fiberglass reinforced plastics has been introduced by new molding materials which combine the properties of performed parts with the flowability of premix. Such new materials make molding from preforms, glass mat, and polyester syrups obsolete, for they are ready for the molding press as received by the molder.

Performance with Economy - RamAire System. Worth H. Percival and William H. Ahrens, General Motors Res. Labs. A novel method for the intermittent supercharging of an internal combustion engine in a vehicle is described. During full throttle operation, high pressure motivating air entrains ambient air and compresses it to an intermediate pressure in the diffuser of an air ejector. Flowing through the carburetor and into the engine, the supplemental air augments engine power, reducing vehicle acceleration time by as much as one-third. By allowing engine size to be reduced, better economy without loss of performance is possible. SA E Transactions 670110. Differential Compound Engine. F. J. Wallace, Bath Univ. of Technology A differential compound engine is described which indicates it to be a significant advance over other traction prime movers. Its engine rating, as confirmed by both theoretical and experimental analysis, represents an increase of approximately 150 percent over the cor- responding naturally aspirated engine. Furthermore, the compound mode of operation implies feedback of surplus power to the output shaft and therefore overall efficiencies in excess of engine efficiency, at least over part of the load range. Values of 40 percent in the neighborhood of the design point can be expected, experimental work having demonstrated engine brake thermal efficiencies in excess of 42-43 percent. Additional advantages include rising torque characteristics with decreasing output shaft speed, the incorporation of effective engine braking, and response characteristics superior to those of a turbo-charged engine.

Address Coding for Highway Communications. Raleigh H. Emery, Bureau of Public Roads, Traffic Systems Div. A network technique is described for the nonambiguous designation of a vehicle at an exact position within a system of roads as well as a selected route by which a vehicle may proceed to any other point in the system. Based on the nodes of the highway system, this code is developed for eight branches connecting to one node. The number of possible branches connecting to a node is limited by available space in a highway network. A suggested technique for coding includes nodes named in a manner to provide maximum information, branches designated by the most significant cardinal compass heading from each node, and a position description by adding measured distance to a given point from an adjoining node. 670113. Integrated Vehicular Communications System Using the Ford Radio Road Alert. F. Bauer, Ford Motor Co. The Ford Radio Road Alert is a new method of providing information to the driver in a more easily used form. It uses coded messages from roadside transmitters which trigger a memory storage in the vehicle and cause recorded announcements to be made through the car radio whether it is on or off. A logic circuit automatically overrides a message being received if one of a more critical nature is required. The driver is assured of receiving the radio messages in a constant format, with constant volume, and in all weather conditions. 670114. Electrical to Thermal Conversion in Spark Ignition. R. T. Lovrenich and J. T. Hardin, Eitra Corp., Prestolite Div. This paper emphasizes the fundamental properties associated with spark ignition, as they affect system design, whether conventional or capacitor discharge techniques are employed. The basic parts of any ignition system are: energy source, energy storage system, mechanism for delivering the stored energy to the spark plug in proper time sequence, and a spark plug which converts electrical energy to the thermal energy required for ignition. The energy storage system and spark plug act as the source and the load, respectively, to supply ignition requirements. The significance of voltage rise time, spark duration, and peak power is discussed as they are derived from the load-source relationships. SA E Transactions 670115. Capacitor Discharge Ignition-Design Approach. Charles L. Shano and Arthur G. Hufton, Motorola, Inc. A capacitor discharge ignition system tailored to modern automobile requirements has been developed which can be triggered direct from the regular distributor cam with breaker points or magnetic pick-up sensor. The system features improved fouled plug firing capability using the 78</page><page sequence="16">670116-670124 conventional ignition coil, draws current from the battery only when engine is rotating, and promises good performance in cold weather starting applications. Special attention has been given to keep ignition radiated radio interference to a minimum without sacrificing spark energy requirements for the many conditions of engine operation. 670116.

Kline, Delco-Remy Div., GMC A new breakerless capacitor discharge ignition system has been developed by Delco-Remy Division, GMC. . This unit provides important benefits to the vehicle operator, and has been designed to fit the requirements of modern gasoline engines. In an extensive engine test program conducted to establish the major design objectives, it was found that under adverse cold starting conditions the system must produce 23-25 kv of ignition at the spark plug to insure reliable starts. Battery voltage may drop as low as 4.0 volts at this time. SA E Transactions 670118. Impact of Changing World Trade Patterns on the Supply and Demand of Automotive Metals - Aluminum. Raymond W. Hale, Battelle Memorial Inst., Columbus Labs. For many years aluminum has been widely used in passenger cars for engine, transmission, and trim components despite both technical and economic problems. It now appears that aluminum will be more readily accepted by the industry because these problems have largely been solved. Considerably wider application of aluminum will be made in radiators, engine blocks and heads, electrical systems, and wheels and brakes within the next five years. 670119. Current Patterns and Future Trends in the Supply and Use of Copper. W. Stuart Lyman, Copper Dev. Association Inc. Data available which make understandable the historical, the present and the foreseeable future trends in copper supply and consumption in the United States, in a worldwide context are examined. Data which describe the use pattern for copper and copper alloys in the automotive sector of the transportation market are also analyzed. 670120. Impact of Changing World Trade Patterns on the Supply and Demand of Automotive Metals - Iron and Steel. Jack Robert Miller, Battelle Memorial Inst., Columbus Labs. A significant change in patterns of world trade in steel is taking place. In the five year period following World War II, a low level of 1 10 million metrice tons in 1945 moved up to 150 million tons in 1950. During the 1956-1965 decade total exports of finished and semifinished steel to the world market rose 112 percent, from 27.6 to 58.4 million metric tons. The United States has changed from the position of net exporter to that of net importer. In 1966, steel imports reached nearly 12 million tons. To meet this problem, the U. S. is striving to increase productivity, to establish new technological areas, and to improve some not so new. 670121. Chromium, Molybdenum, Nickel and Tungsten as Automotive Metals. Charles W. Merrill, Interior Dept., Bur. of Mines The four metals - chromium, molybdenum, nickel, and tungsten - so important to automotive manufacture, currently are in ample supply. Their availability is well supported by world resources and reserves. There are some hazards from hostilities denying access to remote sources, or political factors hindering efficient mining and transport from some producing countries. Future demand can be expected to grow with an increase in the number of motor vehicles produced, but this trend should be countered by their more efficient use. They are among the more expensive raw materials consumed in automobile manufacture and as such will be a target for redesign by automotive engineers. On the other hand, greater quantities may be needed with refinement in vehicle design. 670122. Direct Spectroscopic Determination of Nitric Oxide in Reciprocating Engine Cylinders. H. K. Newhall, Wisconsin Univ.; and E. S. Starkman, California Univ. A theoretical and experimental investigation was carried out to determine the mechanism whereby nitric oxide is formed, conserved, and exhausted from the reciprocating engine combustion chamber. The equipment utilized a magnesium oxide window to transmit the infrared radiation from the combustion chamber; a monochrometer to disperse the radiation, and a cryogenically cooled semiconductor, to sense and indicate the nitric oxide produced radiation.

Engine Variable Effects on Exhaust Hydrocarbon Composition (Single-Cylinder Engine Study with 79</page><page sequence="17">670125-670131 Propane as the Fuel). W. A. Daniel, General Motors Res. Labs Both the mechanism of individual hydrocarbon emission and the effects of engine variables on the individual hydrocarbon concentrations in the exhaust were investigated using a laboratory, single-cylinder engine with propane as the fuel. Individual hydrocarbon concentrations were measured, with a gas Chromatograph, in samples obtained at different conditions. SAE Transactions 670125. Unburned Hydrocarbons in Closed Vessel Explosions, Theory versus Experiment Ap- plications to Spark Ignition Engine Exhaust. John T. Agnew, Drexel Inst, of Technology Experimentally determined and theoretically calculated concentrations of unburned fuel in the exhaust products of a combustion system amenable to theoretical calculations have been compared. Propane-air mixtures were spark-ignited in the center of spherical combustion bombs of various sizes. By this means, the relative importance of the quench phenomenon (a surface effect) has been evaluated. The results show that simple application of quench theory is not consistent with the experimental results. Use of a modified quench theory, based on the results from the bomb experiments, for theoretical calculations of unburned hydrocarbon in engine exhaust indicates that the exhaust unburned hydrocarbon concentration from a large-displacement, low-compression ratio engine should be much lower than that of a small-displacement, high-compression ratio engine. SAE Transactions 670126. Factors Influencing Evaporation Losses from Motor Vehicles. David T. Wade, Esso Res. and Engrg. Co. The basic factors influencing carburetor and fuel tank evaporative emissions are explored. These factors are combined in a mathematical model to predict the magnitude and composition of evaporative losses. A laboratory technique for simulating carburetor losses is also described. SAE Transactions 670127. Adsorption-Regeneration Approach to the Problem of Evaporative Control. P. J. Clarke, J. E. Gerrard, C. W. Skarstrom, J. Vardi and D. T. Wade, Esso Res. and Engrg. Co. An approach to the containment of evaporative emissions of hydrocarbon fuel from automotive vehicles, using an adsorption system, is described. The concept of the system is based upon controlled adsorption-desorption cycling phased to engine operation modes. Feasibility is shown for both the containment of hydrocarbon vapors which would normally be lost to the atmosphere, and the feeding of these vapors to the engine under conditions such that both exhaust emissions and engine operation are unaltered. Extensive performance data are furnished on three cars equipped with exhaust control devices, and system design is treated in a semiempirical fashion demonstrating the flexibility of the approach.

Effect of Fuel Antiknock Compounds and Deposits on Exhaust Emissions. J. C. Gagliardi, Ford Motor Co. The effects of fuel antiknock compounds and combustion chamber deposits on exhaust hydrocarbon emissions were investigated. Six cars were operated on a light-duty driving schedule for periods of 12,000-30,000 miles. Three fuel blends were used: Indolene Clear (a full boiling range nonleaded gasoline), Indolene 30 (Indolene Clear plus 3.0 ml/gal of motor mix blend), and Indolene 30 plus 0.2 theory of an organic phosphorous compound. Two engine lubricants were evaluated: a petroleum base SAE- 10W-30 and a synthetic oil, di-2-ethyl hexal sebacate. 670129.

Phile, Bell Telephone Co. of Pennsylvania Within the utility companies, the automotive groups are charged with responsibility of providing transportation and work vehicles for the operating plant and other departments. As such, the combined thinking of other departments quite often is taken into consideration when purchase of equipment is made. It is, therefore, planned to cover some of the problems encountered in selecting acceptable chassis for utility use up to 16,000 gvw. SAE Transactions 670131.

Howard C. Hansen, Utility Body Co. The wide acceptance in the last 10 years of utility equipment, such as hydraulic derricks and aerial devices, has pointed out many long existing problems in mounting equipment to truck chassis. The newer equipment developments have brought to light many new problems. Many of these problems are herein documented, together with possible solutions. SAE Transactions 670132.

Ray S. M. Wilde, Haveg Industries, Inc. Filament wound glass-epoxy aerial booms are used as cantilever structural electrical insulators on mobile aerial manlifts. The effects of working loads, cycling, field wear and tear, environment, and electrical requirements must be considered in the design to assure units of long useful life. Filament wound glass-epoxy booms with oriented glass fibers are lightweight, extremely strong, corrosion resistant, and good electrical insulators, all of which are desirable for application.

Telescopic and articulated aerial devices must have reliable controls. This paper describes several types in use today, together with comments on the selection of hydraulic fluids for use in this kind of equipment. SAE Transactions 670136. Aerial Device Maintenance. Donald H. Groft, Pitman Mfg. Co. Since the design of an aerial device is not controlled by any standard group and is not governed by a set of uniform requirements, it will be up to the customer to determine how well a particular machine will do its particular job and how much safety is really built into the machine. We hope the decision of the buyer will be based on a demonstration of lifting ability using test weights and on sound engineering data rather than the social compatibility of the salesmen. Immediately after the decision is made on what make and model machine is desired and the purchase order is placed, the maintenance program should begin. It should begin by sending the people responsible for maintaining the machine to school. Whichever level of employee is selected, he must be capable of learning and retaining the knowledge of the details of machine construction and must be able and willing to transmit this information to other people. The next step is to set up a preventive maintenance and test program. This program should be developed and should clearly indicate what items should be performed on a pre-flight basis by the machine operator, which items are the responsibility of the shop mechanic and how often these items should be checked. Actual check lists should be prepared for a daily, weekly, monthly and yearly maintenance program. 670137. Structural Design Considerations of an Aerial Device. John G. Keck and Joseph D. Patton, Asplundh Chipper Co. This paper is presented as an introduction to the considerations made by the structural engineer in the design of an aerial device. Among the topics discussed are the design philosophy, design specifications, critical positions and loadings, selection and meanings of safety factors, and evaluation of the finished product. To corroborate the design assumptions and to confirm the calculated safety factors, a discussion of testing is included. Together with this are presented the data and conclusions from a series of static and dynamic strain measurements made on a typical aerial device. SAE Transactions 670138.

A control system requirement is defined for an advanced direct lift engine designed for a typical Mach 2 fighter aircraft. The characteristics of the control system (performance, weight, reliability and maintainability, cost) are shown to be predominantly a function of the degree of simplicity of the control system requirements and somewhat less a result of the mechanization employed to meet those requirements. 81</page><page sequence="19">670139-670147 670139. Some Aspects of the Control of Multi-Shaft Jet Engines. W. G. Cross and W. B. Edwards, Rolls-Royce, Ltd. Methods of controlling multishaft jet engines are discussed, together with the reasons which dictate the type of control used. These cover control of compressor geometry including variable stators and compressor bleed, control of engine fuel flow including limiting trims, and control of the afterburner including afterburner fuel flow and final nozzle area. The particular problems during transient as well as steadystate engine conditions have been considered. The advantages and disadvantages of various types of control are presented, and these arguments are used to evolve a number of guiding principles in the control of this type of engine. 670140. Some Aircraft Gas Turbine Environmental Challenges for the Fuel Control Designer. L. J. Moulton, General Elee. Co., Flight Propulsion Div. This paper reviews various environments established by the aircraft gas turbine itself, by the aircraft, and by new aircraft engine specifications within which fuel and control systems must operate. Emphasis is on the design requirements placed on controls to assure satisfactory operation in these environments. The influence on design choices and the demands for special testing are discussed for several components. As its objectives, the paper identifies specific areas which may prove troublesome as controls are designed to meet the new requirements. Recognition of potential problem areas is suggested as a first step toward successful design. 670141. Present Needs of Gas Turbine Control Systems and Predictions for the Future. Joseph B. Eastman and Peter M. Slade, Boeing Co. This paper examines the power control system require- ments of small industrial gas turbines of free turbine design.

Aircraft gas turbine are used to drive free turbine- centrifugal compressor combinations in stationary installations. This combination is used for gas compression and power generation in the natural gas transmission, processing, and utility industry. This article discusses the use of aircraft gas turbines to drive gas compressors. The control design criteria and concepts for the start-up sequence based on the location and load are explained. Safety controls for unattended remote installations are discussed. 670143. Engine Manufacturer's Requirements for Start and Safety Controls on Industrial Gas Turbine Engines. W. S. Curtis and W. H. Belke, Caterpillar Tractor Co. A gas turbine engine in an industrial application requires an interlocked supervisory, or start and safety, control for both engine and personnel protection.

This paper discusses the philosophy and development of a start and safety control package for a turbine engine driving a power generator. A brief look at future techniques is also included. 670144. Automatically Programmed Quadruple Dyna- mometer for Vehicle Brake Testing. D. W. Howard and J. L. Winge, Bendix Corp., Bendix Prod. Auto. Div. The multiple dynamometer described in this paper is capable of testing complete four-wheel braking systems similar to the actual vehicle operation by the use of magnetic tape programming techniques. Vehicle tests up to 6 hr in length can be accommodated on a single reel of tape. The use of digital programming permits a high degree of test flexibility coupled with excellent test repeatability. Secondary advantages include the capability of performing these tests on an unattended basis, thereby effecting a savings in manpower. The paper tape and magnetic tape programs can be cataloged and stored, and the test procedure can be duplicated at a later time if so desired. The instrumentation system furnishes precise measure- ments of the braking parameters, thereby providing accurate test data for the design engineering group. SA E Transactions 670146.

Methods of reducing fade based on this mechanism are examined. 670147. High Altitude Can Affect Automotive Ignition System Performance. G. M. Galster and D. A. Garner, Champion Spark Plug Co. To evaluate spark plug and ignition system requirements at high altitudes, tests were made in mountainous areas and in the laboratory using an altitude simulator. In the latter phase, both a standard compression ratio and a typical "export" compression ratio were investigated. In addition both compression ratios were tested using standard carburetion and typical high altitude carburetion. 82</page><page sequence="20">670148-670153 Spark plugs at least one heat range hotter than normal can be used if a vehicle is continuously driven at altitudes above 5000 ft above sea level. However, since spark plug voltage requirements increase at road load conditions and flashover voltages decrease at higher altitudes, more frequent maintenance of spark plugs and ignition systems is desirable in high altitude areas. When an engine adjusted for optimum performance at higher altitudes is driven at wide open throttle at sea level, preignition and detonation may be encountered. SAE Transactions 670148. Development of a New Automotive Spark Plug. William R. Edwards and Gerald E. Roy, AC Spark Plug Div., GMC A new 14-mm automotive spark plug was introduced in the 1967 Buick 400 and 430 cu in. engines. The spark plug combines a 5/8-in. hex and a 63-deg conical seating arrangement with the popular 14-mm thread to provide a reduction in overall size. The smaller installation space required offers the engine designer considerably more flexibility in spark plug positioning. Extensive laboratory and vehicle testing have proved that the new spark plug will perform all required functions exceedingly well. 670149. It has All Been Done Before. I. B. K. Gough, Smiths Industries Ltd. To evaluate spark plug and ignition system requirements at high altitudes, tests were made in mountainous areas and in the laboratory using an altitude simulator.

In addition, both compression ratios were tested using standard carburetion and typical high altitude carburetion. 670150. Computer as a Design Tool. James M. Sneyd, Chrysler Corp. This paper is a critical review of the state-of-the-art in the utilization of modern high speed digital computers as engineering design tools, covering: the problem confronting the modern design engineer in the automotive industry which forces him toward computer usage; computer usage in engineering design processes and its inability to satisfy the demands of the design engineer; and modern input/output devices and time sharing system, which allow close man-machine communication and provide the means by which the engineer can more nearly computerize a total design process. The author redefines the design engineering function with the computer as a partner in the evolutionary steps from concept to final design of a component or end product. 670151. Fundamentals and Basic Techniques of Residual Stress Measurements with a Portable X-Ray Diffraction Unit. R. J. Homicz, Northrop Corp., Norair Div. The X-ray diffraction method for nondestructively measuring residual stresses in metals is advantageous as it does not require a zero stress condition. With the use of a portable X-ray machine and the back reflection film technique, the method becomes even more useful for measuring stresses in components as the component size is no longer a limitation. This paper discusses the fundamentals, basic techniques, and the type of equipment commonly associated with the portable film technique. Bragg's law and its application to residual stress measurements are presented. The single exposure approach for the portable film technique is contrast√®d with the double exposure method that is commonly employed with the direct-reading diffractometers. The necessity for determining the stress factor for each material and heat treatment is presented. The data are interpreted statistically because of the scatter associated with the film readings. This portable X-ray diffraction technique was applied to measuring residual stresses in three 7079-T6 forgings. The purpose of the program was to determine a manufacturing process sequence that would minimize harmful residual stresses in the machined forgings. SAE Transactions 670152. Application of the Portable X-Ray Stress Technique at the Commercial Airplane Division of the Boeing Company. Donald A. Bolstad, Boeing Co., Airplane Div. Several examples are presented where x-ray stress measurements were made with a portable unit. The examples include the measurement of stresses in a welded rocket motor case (maraging steel), heat-treat stresses in a machined part (7079-T6I1), and stresses in a spot-welded panel (Ti-8Al-lV-lMo). Each application emphasizes the advantages of stress analysis by x-ray diffraction by the portable method. For the spot-welded panel there is a direct comparison of x-ray diffraction stress measurements and stress measurements by the compliance method. The results show good agreement between the two methods. 670153. Using Aluminum Alloy Strain Measurements. Marilyn S. Werkema, Martin Co., Denver Div. A portable X-ray diffraction system was used to measure strain in three aluminum alloys (sheet stock) with X-ray elastic constants determined for these alloys. Residual stress estimates have been made as a contribution to t he failure analysis of cracking in production parts. The procedure used involves surface preparation by electropolishing, the preparation of three focused, back reflection photographs, data collection by micro- photometer, and interpretation of the data by the "sin; psi method." A computer program has been written to calculate the slope of the line, change in lattice spacing/interplanar spacing in unstressed condition, versus sin; psi, from the positions of the lines on the films. 83</page><page sequence="21">670154-670161 The crystalline structure of 2014-T6 aluminum alloy sheet stock is such that a large specimen sampling is required to obtain suitable strain measurements. The peculiarities of this material and the resulting effects are discussed, as well as the contribution of X-ray stress measurements to a stress corrosion study involving a launch vehicle part. 670154. Application of Residual Stress Measurements in Failure Analysis and Field Inspection. M. Raefsky, N. Walter, W. Lieberman and J. Clark, Boeing Co., Vertol Div. Investigation of cracked rotor "D" spar revealed an area of tensile residual stress in the area of the failure origin. Normal rotor spar processing results in the formation of compressive residual. The service history of the cracked spar indicated that it had been buckled, at d that compressive yielding had occurred. This resulted in a "wiping out" of the compressive residual stress, and the subsequent formation of a tensile residual stress. Laboratory tests aimed at reproducing the buckle proved successful and full scale fatigue tests of the buckled spars resulted in failures significantly below the normal test scatter. Inspection criteria, based on X-ray diffraction residual stress analysis, have been instituted. SA E Transactions 670155. Gas Turbine Auxiliary Power Unit Noise and Its Attenuation. James J.

Utilization of Technological Resources. James E. Burnett, Lewis Res. Center, NASA The skillful use of new technology has long been a factor in industrial growth, and in recent years it has become the controlling variable determining competitive success. An unusual communication experiment between NASA and the petroleum industry clearly demonstrates the fact that areospace-related new technology has a substantial content of industrial value. A number of examples are given illustrating this fact. The entire NASA collection of aerospace-related technology is now fully and selectively available to industry on a regular working basis through special NASA programs. As a consequence, the technological resources for considered use by any interested company are very large and of demonstrated value. 670160. Technology Stockpile - National Resource and a Challenge to Industry. D. A. Douglas, Union Carbide Corp. In this paper the question, "How can industry rapidly and effectively utilize government-sponsored technology?" is surveyed. The author thinks that, since both the interrelations between government, universities, and industry in the creation of technology and the general economic climate have changed, industry itself must accept the challenge of using technology developed for government projects. There are several pertinent issues: market applicability, management attitudes, personnel motivations, investment protection, and the necessity to establish a strong barrier against government intrusion into areas properly the province of private industry. 670161. Applications of a Reverberation Chamber in Solving Automotive Noise Problems. Robert M. LaBreche, General Motors Corp. This paper contains a practical discussion of the applications of reverberation chambers to acoustical measurement problems often encountered by noise control engineers. The important characteristics of a reverberation chamber are explained and typical reverberation chamber construction demonstrated. The advantage of the reverberation chamber as a simple method of measuring certain acoustic phenomena and acoustical properties is illustrated by its application in three typical examples. First, the application of the room to measurements involving directional sound sources is illustrated by a study of automotive alternator noise. Second, the use of the room as a nondirectional sound source in measurement of acoustical material properties is illustrated by sound barrier tests of material sample installations. Finally, the use of the room in measurements of acoustical properties of nonhomogeneous 84</page><page sequence="22">670162-670166 distributed materials is illustrated by a measurement of the average absorption of an automobile headliner as installed in a car. 670162. Tools and Methods for Automotive Vehicle Noise and Vibration Testing. A. M. Sogoian and W. V. Paliga, Ford Motor Co. Some of the basic techniques employed for the determination of the noise and vibration characteristics of a vehicle are presented along with a description of the various laboratory and road testing facilities. Testing may be classified as evaluation, diagnostic, or development, each consisting of its own approaches and objectives. While evaluation tests may be considered the basic form of all tests and the most easily represented by a standard test procedure, the diagnostic test is used to determine the cause and effect of any undesirable noise or vibration. This type of test fully describes the noise in terms of its effect on the passenger, critical operating conditions, frequency composition, sensitivity to various operating parameters, excitation sources, and mode of transmission to the passenger. The development test relies on these results and involves vehicle modification or component redesign in the quest for elimination of any undesirable noises or vibrations. Special emphasis has also been given to laboratory devices which are capable of simulating the road operation of a vehicle. These facilities, which are used not only for complete vehicle testing but also for individual component testing, allow for more detailed investigations than are possible on the road. This aspect of testing, combined with road testing, results in efficient and thorough vehicle development. 670163. Dynamic Testing of Elastomers with an Electro- Hydraulic Analog Readout System. J. A. Sturos and C. J. Pietkiewicz, Cadillac Motor Car Div., GMC The dynamic rate of a rubber part must be known to predict adequately the viscoelastic behavior of the rubber part while undergoing dynamic excitation. But accurate and convenient testing systems have not been readily available. The resonant beam system, which is used by most engineering groups, has definite drawbacks. The new dynamic rate system at Cadillac Motor Car Division is an electro-hydraulic actuated system which excites the rubber part under closed-loop control. The system features a built-in analog computer which accurately determines the spring rate and damping coefficient for selected values of men load, cyclic amplitude, frequency, and temperature. The need for such a facility, a description of and the procedure in using the resonant beam and the new system, the advantages of the new system as compared to the resonant beam, and the availability of a commercially built electro-hydraulic analog readout system are discussed. 670164. Development of an On-Line Exhaust Gas Data Reduction System. R. M. Cobb and F. Perna, Jr., General Motors Corp. This paper discusses data reduction systems for use at exhaust emission test facilities. An investigation of ways and means of automatically reducing the large volumes of data generated in exhaust emission testing is discussed. Four distinct data reduction methods were considered and evaluated. The investigation resulted in the specification and purchase of an on-line data reduction system for use at several of the General Motors test facilities. Specifically, a system was developed to reduce data collected according to the California Exhaust Emission schedule. Data reduction is accomplished by electronic analog computation with digital control and output. Gas analyzers convert the hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide composition of exhaust gas into analogous electrical signals. They are averaged by time scaled integration at specific times during the driving cycle. At the end of a given time the electrical analog data is operated on according to a specified equation. The accumulation of data during the schedule provides the information used for the final average values of HC and CO. The results are displayed on a chart recorder or digitized and typed on a report. 670165. Correlation of Exhaust Emission Test Facilities. John A. Westveer, Ford Motor Co. Current legally specified test procedures for measuring hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide concentrations in vehicle exhaust gases contain intrinsic test variables which significantly affect test results. These variables constantly hamper efforts to correlate test data generated at one or more exhaust emission test facilities. Some of the more prominent test variables such as vehicle repeatability, test driver repeatability, instability of calibrating gases and changing ambient test conditions are described. In addition, the paper discusses the success of various measures which were undertaken to reduce or eliminate the influence of some of the variables on test repeatability and facility correlation 670166. Generalized Evaluation Model for Military Transports. Peter Goodwin Fielding, Booz, Allen Applied Res. Inc. A general method for cost-effectiveness evaluation of off-road locomotion, air, and other transportation systems operating in the military environment has yet to be developed. The U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Public Roads, Office of Research and Development, has sponsored research work aimed at developing a generalized model of United States transportation. At this time, a generalized model of the performance of transport systems operating in one, two, and three degrees of freedom is being prepared for computer programming. The applicability of this model to solving 85</page><page sequence="23">670167-670173 questions of the relative cost-effectiveness of military transports is discussed. 670167. Cost-Effectiveness Considerations in the Design and Employment of Army Off-Road Vehicles. Donald M. Fort, Rand Corp. This paper discusses the design and employment of off-road transport vehicles for forward-area support of Army ground forces in combat. Following the Bekker- Butterworth approach in broad outline, consideration is given to suitable operational requirements, specific vehicle configurations meeting these requirements, and appropriate measures of system cost and system effectiveness. The requirements emphasize survivability under fire, airliftability, swimming capability, large- obstacle and soft-soil capability, and design for high-density cargo. Large-wheel articulated vehicles, multiwheel vehicles, and tracked vehicles are considered. 670168. Computerized Evaluation of Driver- Vehicle-Terrain Systems. Roy D. McKenzie, W. Max Howell and David E. Skaar, AC Electronics Div., GMC The method is presented which enables a prediction of vehicular performance relative to a specified physical environment. The discussion centers around the parameters which are required to specify the vehicle, the driver, and the environment together with the computational procedure used to estimate vehicular mobility in terms of these parameters. Analog and digital simulation results are presented for wheeled and tracked vehicles respectively. SAE Transactions 670169. Place of Model Tests in Vehicle Development. I. Robert Ehrlich, Stevens Inst, of Technology Operational research procedures are, in general, not applicable to the development of cross-country vehicles because the vehicle-environmental relationships are not well enough understood and the environmental information has not yet been gathered. Model tests are proposed to overcome partially these difficulties and for other purposes where calculations or full-scale tests are not practical. A description of a few model programs and abstracts of their results are presented as examples. 670170. Correlation between Predicted and Actual Off-Road Vehicle Performance. R. A. Liston, Army Tank Automotive Center The need for systems analysis techniques to permit the evaluation of the effectiveness of off-road vehicles is established. The desired characteristics of an analysis technique are discussed. The results of a study which compared predicted and actual performances are presented. The measure of performance is taken as a cost effectiveness ratio proposed by Bekker and Butterworth. It is shown that it is quite possible to correlate predicted and measured results under limited conditions. The performance characteristics that do not have a statistical nature such as reliability or maintenance costs can be predicted and correlated to a measured value by a simple and short test. However, to correlate the non-deterministic characteristics, it is necessary to conduct tests that are sufficiently lengthy to provide a sample size having statistical significance.

Waterways Experiment Station Specialists met at the U.S. Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station (WES) to consider quantitatively various elements of the entire vehicle mobility problem and to suggest an approach for achieving a substantial degree of solution. One specific purpose of the meeting was to design a number of vehicles capable of operating in remote areas of the world where extremely soft soil conditions predominate. 670172. Wheels of Arbitrary Section: Sinkage and Resistance. B. W. Firth, Witwatersrand Univ. Dimensional analysis is used to develop a general sinkage equation for probes of arbitrary shape, confirmed by a test in cohesionless sand giving a straight line over a range l(k Existing equations for plate sinkage are special cases of the general one, and for the form of equation used, the Reece equation is generalized whereby the sinkage exponent will have approximately equal values for cohesive and frictional soils. 670173. Analysis of Tire Lateral Forces and Interpretation of Experimental Tire Data. Donald L. Nordeen, General Motors Res. Labs. Force and moment tire data are not always easy to interpret. Tire characteristics unacceptable for one vehicle may be desirable for another. Tire data cannot be fully evaluated without considering the vehicle on which the tires are to be used. This paper describes a simple method by which tire data as applied to a particular vehicle can be evaluated. The analysis includes an approximate calculation of the steady-state directional control characteristics of the vehicle. The calculations are simple and straightforward, and assist in interpretation of the effect of the tire forces on the vehicle steady-state characteristics. This method of analysis cannot replace the more elaborate dynamic analysis of vehicle handling, but can assist by eliminating those combinations of vehicle parameters and tire characteristics which cannot provide the desired directional control characteristics. This analysis provides a strong basis from which quantitative tire lateral force character- istics can be meaningfully specified. SAE Transactions 86</page><page sequence="24">670174-670178 670174. Quantitative Analysis of the Enveloping Forces of Passenger Tires. S. A. Lippmann and J. D. Nanny, United States Rubber Co. The forces generated by tires when traveling over irregular roads are related to the structure of the tire and to the geometry of the road surface in a useful mathematical relationship. Linearity and superposition principles allow an idealized and synthetic road irregularity to represent the response of a tire to realistic kinds of road irregularities. The association of the enveloping forces with factors related to the structure of tires facilitates the understanding of the enveloping responses. The analysis of the forces for the idealized road irregularity, coupled with the Fourier integral analysis of road surfaces, produced the spectrum of outputs for exciting modes of vibration in the tire itself and in vehicles. 670175. Electrovair - A Battery Electric Car. E. A. Rishavy, W. D. Bond and T. A. Zechin, General Motors Corp. The General Motors electric car program resulted in two battery powered passenger cars, Electrovair I and II. These cars were built to evaluate new motor and control concepts. The program proved that modern high performance electric cars are technically feasible. However, a better electric power source is needed and present costs are too high to make electric cars economically practical. Evaluation tests defined the car problems which must still be solved to prove the commercial and economic feasibility of electric cars, namely: 1 . Low mileage range - especially as batteries age and at low temperatures. 2. Short battery life. 3. Long recharge time. 4. Weight and size - for both the batteries and the electric drive system. 5. Costly components and materials. 6. Sensitivity of the motor control system to electrical noise. 7. Difficult cooling requirements - for the motor, controls, and batteries.' 8. Special auxiliary power requirements - especially for car heating and air conditioning. 9. New safety problems - high voltages and lack of engine braking; possible collision hazard. 10. Radio and TV interference. Discussion: James Lunan, D. M. Teague; Chrysler Corp. SA E Transactions 670176. Electrovan - A Fuel Cell Powered Vehicle. Craig Marks, Edward A. Rishavy and Floyd A. Wyczalek, General Motors Corp. As part of an electric vehicle state-of-the-art evaluation, General Motors built a fuel cell powered van, the Electrovan, to explore the potential and problems of the fuel cell powerplant. Fuel cells were considered as possible electric power sources because they offer the potential of high thermal efficiency and extended range compared with batteries. Although the Electrovan was successfully operated on the road, it was concluded that much research and development work is still needed to solve the many major problems. The encouraging rate of progress and the advantages of fuel cells provide the stimulus to maintain a strong continuing effort in this field. Evaluation tests clearly defined the problems of fuel cell powerplants which must still be solved for vehicle applications, namely: 1. Heavy weight and large volume. 2. Short lifetime. 3. Costly components and materials. 4. Complicated and lengthly startup and shutdown procedures. 5. Removal and disposal of exhaust products - byproduct water, gas bleeds and gas leaks. 6. Sensitivity to contamination - both in the gases and the electrolyte. 7. Complexity of the three separate fluid systems - hydrogen, oxygen and electrolyte. 8. Difficult temperature control requirements. 9. New safety problems - high voltages, electrolyte leaks, hydrogen leaks, possible collision hazard. Discussion: James Lunan, D. M. Teague; Chrysler Corp.

By obtaining a minimum road load for the electric car, the energy consumption per mile will be reduced and therefore extend the driving range per battery charge. The factors which contribute to the energy consumption of the electric car and their relative values are discussed. Projected energy savings through better aerodynamic shapes, low power loss tires, and unique power train configurations are shown for constant speed expressway driving and city-surburban driving. 670178. High Peformance A-C Electric Drive System. Paul D. Agarwal, General Motors Defense Res. Labs.; and I. M. Levy, Delco Products Div., GMC The recent advance in power handling capacity of semiconductor devices makes it possible to replace d-c and a-c commutator machines for variable speed applications by high-speed, light-weight, squirrel-cage induction motors. This paper describes the development of a high-performance electric drive system which uses squirrel-cage induction motors in which slip frequency is externally controlled. This makes it suitable for traction applications. Two systems were specifically built for installation in a battery-powered automobile and a fuel-cell powered delivery truck. The performance of 87</page><page sequence="25">670179-670185 88 these vehicles has proven the technical feasibility of an electric powered vehicle. 670179. Sodium-Sulfur Secondary Battery. Joseph T. Kummer and Neill Weber, Ford Motor Co. A sodium-sulfur secondary battery has been devised which shows promise as a power source for electric vehicles by virtue of superior energy and power densities and use of cheap, light reactants. The cell is a sealed low pressure device operating at 300 C in which liquid reactants are separated by a novel solid ceramic electrolyte permeable only to sodium ions. It is premature to do anything but speculate on what this battery could mean for an electric car since there are many problems to be solved, not only with the battery, but with motors and controls, before it can become a practical reality. It is nevertheless possible, and useful, to make a tentative calculation of what might be achieved. For example, 350 lb of sodium-sulfur battery in a 1350 lb commuter car should allow it to cruise at 40 mph for 200-300 miles, at 60 mph for 125-200 miles, and have a top speed of about 70 mph. Such a car should have adequate performance in an urban-suburban environment. The chief disadvantage of this battery, even for motive power use, is the high temperature of operation. The battery is inoperative at room temperature, so a cold start is impossible, unless auxiliary heating is used. A large battery has a considerable heat capacity and the time required to bring it up to operating temperature with any practical auxiliary system would probably be unacceptable except for very infrequent occasions. However, the solution to this problem is to keep the battery hot all the time. Discussion: James Lunan, D. M. Teague; Chrysler Corp. SAE Transactions 670181. Vehicle Fuel Cell System. Floyd A. Wyczalek, Daniel L. Frank and Gene E. Smith, General Motors Corp. A fuel cell system was developed which can deliver a peak power of 160 kw. It consists of 32 Union Carbide fuel cell modules together with the electrical and fluid system auxiliary components needed to operate and control them in a vehicle. The reactants are hydrogen and oxygen and the modules use a circulating electrolyte, potassium hydroxide. Sufficient auxiliaries are included to maintain all working fluids in an invariant condition. The heat generated in the fuel cells is rejected to ambient air. The exhaust product, water, is condensed out of the recirculating hydrogen and drained. Two of these 160 kw electric powerplants were built. One is a laboratory test bed and the second is installed ip a vehicle. Discussion: James Lunan, D. M. Teague; Chrysler Corp.

The construction and operating characteristics of the Union Carbide hydrogen-oxygen thin electrode module as incorporated into the General Motors Electro van are described. The interfaces between the fuel cell module and its thermal and its fuel system are considered as well as the interface with the electrical load under a range of steady-state and transient conditions. Accessible state of the art and next generation improvements are described. 670183. Underwater Work and Manned Submersibles. John A. Pritzlaff, Westinghouse Elee. Co., Underseas Div. This paper is intended as in introduction into the role of the manned submersible in deep-water exploration and work accomplishment. A brief history of the bathyscaph type vehicle is given. The type of under-water work that submersibles will do is outlined, and a summary review of the existing and future deep diving vehicles is provided. 670184. Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle. Daniel M. Spadone, Navy Dept. A deep submergence submarine rescue system is being developed by the Navy. The system will provide a world wide capability of rescuing personnel down to the collapse depth of U.S. Navy submarines. The design requirements for the system and details of the major subsystems are provided. 670185. 2,000,000 Miles of Fluid Evaluation in City Bus Automatic Transmissions. M. L. Haviland and J. J. Rodgers, General Motors Res. Labs. In certain types of city bus service some automatic transmission fluids can fail in less than 10,000 miles. In order to provide satisfactory transmission performance for longer mileage, improved fluids are required. An investigation was undertaken to obtain improved fluids. Fifteen different fluid formulations were evaluated in 30 city buses operated in normal service for more than 2,000,000 miles. It was determined that fluids fail because of frictional deterioration and oxidation. Based on these evaluations, only two fluids were found to be satisfactory for more than 40,0k00 miles; one additional fluid was satisfactory for more than 30,000 miles. The remaining 12 fluids failed in less than 20,000 miles. From this fluid evaluation program, it is concluded that with properly formulated fluids, drain intervals in city bus automatic transmissions can be as great as 40,000 miles; however, drain intervals should be established by evaluating fluids in the bus service for which they are intended. Analysis of fluid samples taken during a test can aid in establishing the optimum drain interval. Discussion: K. Rothert; Enjay Additives Lab.; P. B.

Breitenburger, Deutsche Tafelglas AG This paper deals with the question of how windshields must be constructed and installed in order to provide the highest degree of protection for passengers in a crash. Material characteristics and mounting methods of laminated safety glass are discussed from the viewpoint of actual conditions (internal automobile dimensions and possible head-to-glass impact velocity) and concrete performance data are given. A test specification is also proposed. SAE Transactions 670192. Analytical Prediction of Vehicle Handling Behavior. Wayne C. Hamann, Ford Motor Co. A comprehensive mathematical model of the vehicle is described. The capabilities of this model have been made easily accessible to the design and development engineer by implementation on the remote console computer time-sharing system. A joint test-calculation investigation into the development of useful handling criteria and design analysis of vehiue handling behavior is briefly discussed. As a result of this investigation, a number of criteria were developed by which vehicle performance can be evaluated. Application of the mathematical model and these criteria to improve handling characteristics of a "problem vehicle" are demonstrated "on-line" using a remote console connected to Ford Technical Computer Center facilities in Dearborn. 670193. Torsional Vibrations in Agricultural Tractors. R. Bruce Hopkins, Deere and Co., John Deere Waterloo Tractor Wks. A brief description of the representation of physical systems as idealized systems and the computation of natural frequencies is given. Using an example of an engine and power shift transmission system, it is shown that a simplified analysis can be made with small effect on the computed natural frequencies. The prevention of torsional vibrations with a power shift transmission, and the prevention of gear rattle in conventional transmissions, is discussed. SAE Transactions 670194. Rotating Combustion Engine - Compact, Light- weight Power for Aircraft. Charles Jones, Curtiss-Wright Corp. The status of the rotating combustion aircraft engine program at Curtiss-Wright as of the fall, 1966, is presented. Related developments which led to present configurations are briefly discussed and likely directions for the future are mentioned. This prior work included cumulative test time of 34,000 hr on one- to four-rotor engines covering a displacement range of 445/1; the development of durable, efficient components; feasibility demonstrations of air cooling and heavy fuels operation; and field testing in automobiles, boats, and generating sets. This background leading to the current JP fuel-injected 310 hp engine (RC 2-90) is developed to show that today's RC engine offers propeller driven and rotary wing aircraft a new powerplant approaching the size, weight, and smoothness of the gas turbine at reciprocating engine fuel economy and cost. 670195. Approaches and Trends in Automatic Speed Controls. J. T. Ball, Chrysler Corp. This paper reviews automatic speed control progress covering the earlier buzzers and throttle holders and explores the operation and function of the truue speed control which automatically operates the throttle to maintain a preset car speed under varying conditions of wind, grade, and load. The basic anatomy of the automatic speed control, which consists of the manual control system, the car speed sensor, the "brain," the power unit, and the disengagers is described. Automatic relatch and resume- speed features are also treated, as are accuracy, safety, and fuel economy aspects of these devices. Discussion of recent trends in low cost vacuum controls with simplified button operation completes the paper. 670196. Guided-Light Display Panel. George K. C. Hardesty, Naval Ship Res. and Dev. Center, Annapolis Div. The term "guided-light" applies to a new concept of internal light utilization applicable primarily to opaque- faced, edge-lighted, plastic panels. Manufacturing techniques based on this concept make possible the production of one-piece illuminable cockpit and control console panels that have unprec dented efficiency and "light-throw" yet retain the dimensions and conventional appearance of the single-panel types. It is estimated that guided-light panels require less that 25 percent of the number of embedded lamps than are now used in state-of-the-art, embedded lamp, single panels. Some of the techniques of guided-light light distribution are related to those that have been developed for the duo-panel but others are unique. This paper lays the ground work for early industrial application to aerospace indicating instruments. Optical efficacy of candidate combinations of materials may be determined through use of the curves presented. SAE Transactions 670197. Disc Brakes - Two Years After. T. H. Thomas, Bendix Corp., Brake and Steering Div. Although relatively new on American cars, disc brakes do not represent a new concept of braking. This paper reviews their development and first testing in the 1930's, their application to EEuropean cars in the 1950's, and their subsequent introduction on American cars in the 1960's. 89</page><page sequence="27">670198-670204 90 Described in detail are the three categories of caliper disc brakes: disc floating, caliper fixed; disc and caliper fixed; disc fixed, caliper floating.

Performance of Vehicle Gas Turbines. D. E. Barbeau, Continental Aviation and Engrg. Corp. The performance of gas turbine engines suitable for ground vehicle applications is examined. Two basic cycles are discussed - the simple turbine engine cycle, and the regenerated turbine engine cycle. The simple cycle presents the high power to weight and power to volume potential of the gas turbine in its basic form. The regenerated engine with variable power turbine geometry presents the simplest turbine cycle capable of competing with the best piston engines on the basis of fuel consumption. The effect of the choice of cycle parameters and the effect of component performance on engine performance trends is presented, and the overall engine performance is examined as it relates to the vehicle. 670199. Spark Ignition Engine Progress. Albert G. Lucas, General Motors Corp. A review of past development progress, the basic engine design problem, and the design status of today's engine indicates that the continued development of the four cycle, reciprocating piston, spark ignition automobile powerplant means continued improvements and the creation of a more difficult task for possible replacement. The years of development time have resulted in significant improvements in four areas: higher rotative speeds and improved thermal, volumetric, and mechanical efficiencies. Continued development and refinement of this engine will be stimulated in the future with catalytic development efforts similar to one we are presently experiencing - reduction of exhaust emissions. This effort is discussed in addition to the overhead camshaft valve mechanism and aluminum engines which are also subjects of current development interest. 670200. Smoke Abatement in Gas Turbine Engines through Combustor Design. J. G. Gleason, University of Arkansas; and J. J. Faitani, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. Intensive investigation of the effect of design features of jet engine combustors with regard to the formation of smoke has been performed by Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft during recent years. This paper discusses the effect on theo intensity of smoke formation observed by changes of such factors as primary air distribution, burner shape, swirlers, premixing, vaporizing, and so forth. A brief discussion concerning the effects of such variables as pressure, inlet temperature, and the like is presented, as is some discussion on the possibility of needed compromise between smoke abatement and performance factors. 670201. Experimental Determination of the Velocity and Pressure Profiles in the Combustion Zone in a Model of a Gas Turbine Combustion Chamber. Talaat E. A. Youssef, Cairo Univ. One of the still undecided questions concerning the aerodynamics of the flow in gas turbine combustion chambers is the extent of the similarity between the flow patterns in the chamber under cold flow and combustion conditions. This investigation reports on the experimental measurements of the velocity and the static pressure profiles in the combustion zone in a model of a gas turbine combustion chamber under atmospheric con- ditions. The results are analyzed to establish the extent of the similarity between cold flow and combustion profiles. The shape and size of the flow reversal zone under both conditions are also discussed. SA E Transactions 670202. Instrumentation for Dynamic Vehicle Diagnosis. John St. John, Marquette Corp. The development of the oscilloscope as an ignition diagnostic tool is decribed. The end result of this development is a device which, with only four connections to the engine, all accessible, plus a pickup in the exhaust tailpipe, yields all the diagnostic information necessary to evaluate the performance of an internal combustion spark-ignited engine and pinpoints malfunctions requiring correction for proper operation. 670203.

It will also develop the test methods required to determine compliance to these standards. This paper describes the three areas NBS will concentrate on initially: tire systems, occupant restraint systems, and braking systems. In developing its research data, NBS is looking to building on work already done by the automotive</page><page sequence="28">670205-670212 industry.

Schultz, AiResearch Mfg. Co. Factors to be considered in selection of fuel for the auxiliary power system are discussed along with the performance of various fuels or propellants. The non-air breathing systems covered in this paper are considered an integrated assembly of four basic subsystems - energy source, energy converter, power conditioning, and heat sink. Advantages and disadvantages of both solid and liquid propellants are reviewed. Because weight and size considerations are of prime importance in auxiliary power units, a theoretical performance in the way of minimum specific propellant consumption is presented. The paper concludes with presentation of a possible problem an APS must undergo, and its solution. 670207. (P-14) Modular Packaging Approach for Dual In-Line Integrated Circuits. John M. Martinell, Eleo Corp. This paper describes the development of a packaging technique using the new dual in-line package. Part one tells why this package was developed and gives some advantages this technique has over present trends in packaging. Part two gives a complete explanation and description of the component parts of the package. The third part elaborates on the heart of the package, namely the interconnection matrix. Details are given on converting from a systems logic diagram to a graphic format used in the development of the matrix layout. Part four explains the step by step procedure used in manufacturing the dual in-line module on both the prototype and production level. The final part tells of other packaging techniques using as a basic building block, the internal parts of the dual in-line module. 670209. (P-14) Microelectric Welding - Approach to Improved Reliability. Stephen N. Bobo, Raytheon Co. There has long been a need for positive and definitive identification of questionable microwelds. This is not due to the fact that the number of poor welds made in any production is high. The need rather stems from the fact that visual inspection criteria are neither sufficiently uniform nor sufficiently dependable to guarantee 100 percent reliability where absolute reliability is a real requirement. Raytheon has used the technique of infrared monitoring to improve the accuracy of diagnosis of welding inspectors. An experimental program has verified that infrared can be useful, not only in welding control, but as an extremely good monitor of weld quality without the necessity of using it to control. The concept of infrared monitoring then can be extrapolated into structural welding for purposes of continuous 100 percent quality determination, control, flaw detection, and so forth. SAE Transactions 670210. (P-14) Package Fabrication and Evaluation. David Nixen, North Amer. Aviation, Inc., Autonetics Div. Hermiticity requirements for electronic devices become more important as increasingly stringent demands are made upon new systems required for both DOD and NASA. Because of the decreased internal volume of flat packages today, higher levels of hermeticky are required to minimize the exchange of atmosphere between the package and the outside ambient. A smaller package will show a greater effect than a larger package with the same leak rate over the same period of time. This paper describes flat-packs which are composed of nonporous materials which leave two areas for possible leaks: (1) the seal between the lid and the case, and (2) the seals between the leads and the case. The processes for sealing the lid on the package are discussed, showing the various material combinations currently being used. The structure of various types of packages, including the lid seals and the lead seals are shown. Seal structures are discussed showing the characteristics of the Kovar-to-glass lead seal, Kovar-to-pyroceram lead seal. Photomicrographs show the relationship of the various components of a seal to each other as well as the conditions which would cause that seal to fail hermetically or electrically. Hermeticky data relates the calculated rate of the exchange of the ambient in a given package to the measured leak rate. Methods of determining leak rates are discussed, including photographs of the helium bomb and the mass spectrometer setup technique. Conditions of the fine leak test and of the gross leak test are presented. SAE Transactions 670211. (P-14) Laser Welding - A Status Report. Jon H. Myer, Hughes Res. Labs. The laser welder and particularly the pulsed ruby laser welder has evolved into a specialized tool for specialized applications in the same class as the ultrasonic welder. Laser welders will not replace present welding equipment, but rather will supplement it and will not revolutionize the welding industry but rather extend its potential. The device has limitations in the welding field, but the necessary skills have been acquired to better exploit its unique capabilities. Some of the laser welding processes that appear promising will be indicated. 670212. (P-14) Developing the Quality Assurance Requirements for a Custom Thin-Film Circuit Program. Robert R. Prudhomme, Martin Co., Denver Div. Because of the unique problem areas associated with thin film circuit fabrication, a study was initiated to develop 91</page><page sequence="29">670213-670219 the quality assurance requirements for custom thin film circuitry. This study resulted in generating (1) contamination requirements, (2) criteria covering receipt and handling of vendor supplied components and materials, (3) controls for critical thin film processes, (4) necessary inspection points, (5) a closed loop process control and corrective action system, and (6) reliability and failure analysis requirements. Also, the study showed that better nondestructive testing methods need to be developed in order t detect latent defects and thereby, increase circuit reliability. 670213. (P-14) New Approach to Parallel-Gap Joining. C. J. Dawes, British Welding Res. Assn. One of the major problems in conventional parallel-gap joining methods is overheating. Damage to the copper circuit thus results. The British Welding Research Association has designed a new electrode with a metallic insert. The insert which is separated from the electrodes by a thin dielectric acts as a heat sink. Joints made with the new electrode have a large bond area, show little damage to the substrate, and exhibit a characteristic fillet at the edge of the lead. This fillet is a visual indication of a satisfactory joint. SAE Transactions 670214. (P-14) Precision Bonding Utilizing Mechanical Thermal Pulse Techniques. R. H. Cushman, Western Electric Co., Inc. The results of a limit study program utilizing Mechanical Thermal Pulse (MTP) techniques are discussed. The characteristics and capabilities of MTP bonding process are described. This process makes it feasible to bond through appreciable layers of contaminants without flux and without extensive precleaning. It is also feasible to make multiple bonds with surprisingly simple, rapid equipment. The type of equipment designed to carry out the process is described. Several examples are used to show various applications of the process in everyday interconnection problems. The "Band and Join" type connection and bonding to unstripped plastic insulated wires and cables are highlighted. 670215. (P-14) Inspection and Control Requirements for Hot Gas Sold red Flat Pack Connections. Andor J. Kraut, Martin Co., Denver Div. Acceptance of the flat pack as a standard configuration for integrated circuits has stimulated development of new interconnection techniques which necessitated development of new criteria and controls for these techniques. One method is a hot gas soldering process in which the solder joints are made by passing the printed iircuit board containing the flat packs under hot gas jets. Specification of this process for a possible space application necessitated development of inspection criteria and controls to ensure the required joint reliability. This was accomplished concurrently with development of the soldering process and qualification method. 670217. (P- 14) Packaging of Electronic Signal Conditioning Equipment for the Project Apollo Lunar Module, George Yabroudy, Frank Aversano and Remo Savino, American Bosch Arma Corp., Arma Div.; and Benedict Gaylo, Grumman Aircraft Engrg. Corp. The electronic circuit packaging techniques employed in the Signal Conditioning Electronic Assembly (SCEA) which is a critical part of the Project Apollo Lunar Module instrumentation is described. Mission and equipment requirements are reviewed and the nature of the SCEA circuits is described. Lunar Module Packaging concepts, insofar as they affect the SCEA, are discussed. Design problems and the design method employed are covered and hardware descriptions are given for SCEA plug-in subassemblies and their constituent welded cordwood circuit modules. Significant features of the design are: extremely rugged subassemblies, very high welded module part densities, and new microminiature transformer design and fabrication techniques. 670218. (P-14) Study of Embedment and Other Metal- lurgical and Mechanical Characteristics of Cross-Wire Resistance Welds. James A. Munford, Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA An investigation was performed to evaluate the cross-wire resistance welded joints used in welded electronic assemblies for aerospace applications. Mechan- ical strength and reproducibility of strength were determined for several alloy combinations by performing single torsion-shear tests in a pneumatically operated pull testing machine. A metallographic investigation was performed in order to determine the type of bondinng and the degree of mutual embedment resulting from the welding operation. Material combinations investigated were Nickel 200 interconnect welded to itself, Kovar, Alloy 180, and Dumet; and Alloy 180 interconnect welded to itself, Kovar, and Dumet. Strength, embedment, and consistency data indicate that an optimum degree of embedment exists for each combination of materials. For the material combinations studied, the optimum embedment was found to be between 10 and 25 percent of the wire diameter. 670219. (P-14) Thermal Stress Analysis of Epoxy Encapsulants. George Nikolaychik, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. The stresses produced by the epoxy resin during thermal shock may cause rupture of the component-to-ribbon welds in encapsulated welded modules. This investigation develops a mathematical model describing the stresses on component lead wires. Stresses are functions of the temperature-dependent mechanical properties of the 92</page><page sequence="30">670220-670223 epoxy, diameter of an epoxy slug in shear with the component lead wire, and temperature. Thermal stress indexes were established to predict the thermal-shock properties of epoxies. Strain-gage force-voltage trans- ducers, simulating epoxy-encapsulated, cylindrical, electronic components, were used to measure stresses in modules. Good agreement was obtained between experimental data and theoretical results. 670220. (P-14) Effective Visual Criteria for Welded Interconnections in Microcircuits. R. D. Bryant and M. H. Bester, North Amer. Aviation, Inc., Autonetics Div. One of the most critical aspects affecting the ultimate reliability of welded interconnections is the lack of meaningful visual criteria for crosswire joints. In recognition of this, Autonetics has undertaken a comprehensive program to establish the correlation between visual characteristics and metallurgical and mechanical properties of specific wire combinations. Significant numbers of welded interconnections were made using 25 wire combinations and employing welding parameters that would produce cold, typical, and overheated welds. The welded joints were critically examined and classified with regard to useful visual characteristics such as embedment, indentation, filleting, bulging, expulsion, pitting, surface fusion, cracks and voids. Also, metallographic studies were conducted to determine the relationship between internal conditions and joint integrity. 670221. (P-14) Process Origin of Impurities in Hermetic Electronic Device Packages. P. H. Eisenberg and G. V. Brandewie, North Amer. Aviation, Inc., Autonetics Div. Many investigators who have studied the reactions of various gases and contaminants on solid state device operating characteristics have not particularly concerned themselves with the process origins of these gases and contaminants. Analysis of the contents of hermetic device packages has revealed large variances in composition and concentration of these gases and contaminants. Once the gas or contaminant had been established as deleterious to the operation of the device, it was necessary to determine its origin. It was assumed that all deleterious materials of concern to the study were process oriented. The techniques utilized by various manufacturers to make hermetic packages were compared for common practices associated with the closure techniques, the ambients, the temperatures, and their controls. These were carefully evaluated and compared to the analyses performed using mass spectrographic and gas chromatographic techniques. Solid contaminants trapped inside the device due to processes occurring prior to the seal operation were traced to their origin using analytical techniques including the electron microprobe. Results of these studies indicated major sources of impurities to be (1) dry box ambients, (2) outgassing for metal surfaces, (3) residual processing solvents, (4) weld flash, and so forth Some examples of joint studies that resulted in corrective actions which eliminated these process oriented inpurities are given. For example, open aluminum interconnects in integrated circuits were determined to be caused by chloride corrosion present as a result of incomplete cleaning processes. 670222. (P-14) Microchemistry and Microhardness as a Function of Microstructure in Parallel Gap Welds. John E. Breen, Raytheon Co. A study was made on the metallographic, microchemical and microhardness properties of parallel gap welds and their relationship to each other. The parallel gap welding process is often used to join metals with large differences in their physical properties over wide ranges of energy inputs. The resultant weld microstructures vary over a full spectrum from the so-called brazed joint to a completely fused weld area. The chemical and mechanical variations were determined on a microscale in the weld area to aid in an intelligent interpretation of the microstructure. The bulk of the work was done on gold plated Kovar leads welded to nickel ribbon. It was concluded that: 1. In the braze type joint the gold plating melts and dissolves metal from the Kovar leads and the nickel ribbon. In the brazed area there are concentration gradients of the elements present in the weld members across the braze. The brazed area is two or three times the original plating thickness. 2. As the energy input is increased the thickness of the brazed area increases and the concentration gradient becomes less sharp. 3. At the highest energy inputs the entire area has melted and there is a chemically homogeneous alloy acrosss the entire area. 4. Microhardness readings show evidence of solid solution hardening due to alloying during the braze/ welding processes. 5. The microchemical and microhardness studies along with the metallographic examination show that good joints are obtained in the weld joint or brazed joint and points in between. 670223. P.C.V. Valves. Frank J. Woechan, United States Post Office Dept. Positive crankcase ventilation valves offer the advantages of reduced crankcase emission and increased fuel economy. However, if not maintained properly, they develop a number of malfunctions: starting problems, poor idling, and oil leaks. The cause is the development of sludge and contaminates in the oil filter. These valves must be tested each time the vehicle is serviced to determine if the whole system is operating properly. The system must be thoroughly cleaned periodically to prevent the buildup of sludge. This conclusion is based on experience with post office vehicles. 93</page><page sequence="31">670224-670233 670224. Smoke Reduction in Diesel Engines. A. W. Carey, Jr., Cummins Eng. Co., Inc. Black smoke is composed of free carbon or soot in an otherwise transparent exhaust stream. This paper discusses the factors responsible for smoke formation, the measurement of smoke, causes of excessive smoke on the highway, and the effect of fuel on smoke formation. Finally, the role of smoke suppressant additives is described. 670226. (P-16) Tip Tank Concept: An Economic Orbital Transportation System. Roland Quest, McDonnell Co., McDonnell Astronautics Co. The extremely high cost of space flight is the primary deterrent to expanded space activities. A major step forward in economical near-earth orbital transport capability can be achieved through the "Tip Tank Concept." The concept is based on the development of an integrated launch/re-entry vehicle with a high degree of reusability. It consists of a long slender vehicle which carries all launch, orbital and re-entry subsystems for subsequent reuse - plus low cost, lightweight, "throwaway" propellant tanks attached to the sides of the vehicle. With this configuration, it is possible to achieve orbit, utilizing presentday technology, without requiring any additional booster. The concept evolves as a logical next step based on a consideration of the presentday technology capabilities in terms of structures and propulsion, and economic analysis of the alternatives available within the framework of this technology. The integration of the boost propulsion system into the vehicle is a developmental problem which should be solvable utilizing existing booster technology. The operational costs of the Tip Tank orbital transport system are shown to be approximately one-fourth of the operational costs of a system using an expendable booster such as Titan UIC with a reusable spacecraft. s A E Transactions 670228. Estimating Maintenance Man-Hours per Flight Hour for Business Turbojet Airplanes. Harley D. Kysor and Tayler H. Bingham, Kysor /Harley D./ and Associates, Inc. A new method has been developed for estimating the manhours of labor per flight hour that will be required to maintain many of today's turbojet/fan business airplanes. This method consists of establishing a base manhour per flight hour depending on an airplane's empty weight completely equipped. Then the effect of certain factors that influence this base manhour can be calculated, and the base manhour appropriately adjusted to reflect the total number of manhours per flight hour. In addition, material costs are estimated. This procedure offers a planned, systematic means by which the maintenance costs of most airplanes in this class can be estimated on an objective basis. 670230. Quebec's Approach to the Use of Special Aircraft for Forest Fire Suppression. Paul Gagnon, Quebec Transp. and Communications Dept. In order to reduce the incidence and spread of forest fires in the Province of Quebec, the Department of Transportation and Communications has set up an Air Service Division which provides aircraft to both detect and fight forest fires. Their method for transmitting accurate fire location data based on a master grid numerical reference system is described, as well as the water pickup and drop procedure that is part of the design mission. Research currently in the development stage is expected to effect further improvements in forest fire suppression through the use of aircraft. SAE Transactions 670231. STOL Commercial and Business Transports. W. C. J. Garrard and J. Mack Eaton, Lockheed- Georgia Co. The designs of three short takeoff and landing (STOL) commercial transports are described, and their initial and direct operating costs compared with those of conventional high-speed jet transports. STOL performance can be provided at comparable costs by propeller driven aircraft, but at a large sacrifice in cruise speed. STOL performance and comparable cruise speeds result in airplanes with significantly increased costs. Existing airports in the United States are classified by field length, to show the available number of smaller airports which could be used by STOL aircraft. It is suggested that, for business aircraft, the ability to operate from shorter fields does not justify the higher costs, since it may be less expensive to increase runway lengths than to operate significantly more expensive airplanes. For airline operations between congested metropolitan city-centers, however, the additional costs of STOL may be justified by reduced overall travel time and passenger convenience. SAE Transactions 670232. Aerial Photography Operations in the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Francis D. Moran, United States Dept. of Commerce Through the exploitation of color, infrared, and panchromatic aerial films, the Coast and Geodetic Survey has developed aerial photography skills and procedures that have removed much of the hazardous and back-breaking work from charting shoreline and locating landmarks and aids to nautical navigation. It has extended these techniques to aeronautical and airport obstruction charting, and more recently has applied photogrammetric principles to mapping boundaries, making crustal movement surveys, measuring tidal currents, and for extending horizontal control. 670233. Use of Large Helicopters in the Field of Construction. Peter Wright, Keystone Helicopter Co. Large helicopters are being used for many types of 94</page><page sequence="32">670234-670242 construction work in the United States. Some of the helicopters that are used for this work and their operational problems are described in detail. Examples of jobs done for the air conditioning companies, electric utilities, ski lifts, and structural steel contractors are given. With proper planning and design and with much larger helicopters coming on the market soon, a tremendous increase in constructions by helicopter will take place. 670234. Designing Business Jet Aircraft Engines for Increased Service Life. Frederick W. Garry, General Elee. Co., Flight Propulsion Div. Techniques for increasing the life of small jet engine components have been developed. Turbine nozzles have been improved by introducing localized cooling, and by changes in mechanical design. In the bearing area, life has been increased by reduction of axial thrust and vibratory loads, and the total bearing-lubrication system has been improved by changes in sump venting and carbon seal cooling. Rotor vibration problems have been decreased by changes in design assembly and techniques and bearing supports; and the results of vibration on connecting components have been controlled by study and treatment on a system basis. Integration of numerical computation with test results and field experience is presented as a basis for rational life predictions of rotor parts. SA E Transactions 670235. Thrust Reversers for Business Jet Aircraft. John C. Pickerd and C. M. Hinds, Rohr Corp. Principles of thrust reversing are reviewed along with descriptions of most common types of thrust reversers. Various uses of reversers are discussed and limitations of reversing due to reingestion and other causes are examined. Technical asipects of thrust reverser analysis and testing are related to both static and dynamic performance. Specific uses of reversers on business jets and the resulting performance gains are demonstrated. 670236. Growth and Operational Capabilities of the Turboprop Engine. Howard A. Buckner, Jr. and Robert R. Van Nimwegen, AiResearch Mfg. Co. In addition to pssessing inherent characteristics of operational smoothness, long life, and high reliability, the turboprop engine has the extremely desirable feature of large growth capability in a given frame size. Whereas the reciprocating engine has been growth limited for many years, we can anticipate a large growth in power from today's engines by increasing turbine inlet temperature, improved component efficiencies, and increased engine specific flow. Con≈õiderable activity is taking place in the areas of high temperature materials, cooling of turbines and other hot end parts, and on compressor and turbine developments. This paper highlights some of this activity. 670237. General Problems in Vibration of Aircraft Powerplant Components. E. Forest Critchlow, Consultant Some of the more general types of dynamic vibration that exist in aircraft, particularly the powerplant components, are reviewed for reciprocating and turbine engines as well as helicopter and unconventional drive systems. The responsiveness of various components to the source of excitation, resulting in either resonant or nonresonant (forced) vibration, is discussed. The importance of evaluating the fatigue life of a component at varying load . conditions, both in the laboratory and field, is stressed. 670238. Two-Stroke Light-Aircraft Engine Potential. James L. Dooley, McCulloch Corp. The current position of the two-stroke cycle aircraft engine is described with respect to competitive type powerplants, including a brief historical background and information on some of the latest designs. The two-cycle case is substantiated with arguments and data showing why it should still be considered for the lower power ranges. 670239. Professional Growth of Engineers with Business Aircraft Manufacturers. J. A. Dugelby, Swearingen Aircraft This paper looks at the engineering aspects of the business aircraft industry and makes certain recom- mendations concerning the engineer and his continued growth. A four-point program is proposed to establish the environment necessary for continued significant engineering contributions. 670241. Development of the Third Level Airline Industry. A. K. Pepin, Beech Aircraft Corp. The commuter or third-level airline service is a stable, rapidly growing and necessary part of the United States transportation system today. Much of the success of operators in this service is due to recognition of the needs of the communities they serve and tailoring service to fill these needs. Modern equipment with profit-producing potential, a hub-and-spoke traffic pattern with emphasis on nonstop routes and proper promotion are keys to success. 670242. Gulfstream II Aerodynamic Design. Irving T. Waaland and Edward J. Curtis, Grumman Aircraft Engrg. Corp. The Gulfstream II business jet is a low wing aircraft of moderate sweep featuring a T-tail arrangement and two aft-mounted turbofan engines. The paper outlines aerodynamic development of the configuration and control system, highlighting significant design decisions and aerodynamic characteristics with appropriate experimental data including force, pressure, and flow visualization results. Aerodynamic design considerations included: wing optimization to meet the requirements of high and low speed performance and a pitch-down stall 95</page><page sequence="33">670243-670248 break at all flight conditions while providing adequate fuel volume; nacellepylon-wing relationship for optimum drag, engine characteristics, and airplane balance; and an empennage arrangement providing satisfactory stability and control at all conceivable flight conditions. The Gulfstream II configuration provides strong aerodynamic resistance to inadvertent secondary stall entry and more than adequate recovery capability. SA E Transactions 670243. Aerodynamics of the Cessna Tandem Twins. William D. Thompson, Jr., Cessna Aircraft Co., Commercial Aircraft Div. Aerodynamic investigations in tandem twin aircraft are confined mainly to the effects of propeller slipstream variations on longitudinal control, trim, and stability. Slipstream velocities measured at the horizontal tail increase by a factor of three during a transition from a glide to a full throttle climb at 75 mph. Out-of-trim stick forces must be minimized by judicious placement of the elevator trim tab and careful design of the horizontal tail geometry. Rear engine operation is superior to front engine operation in stability, control, and performance, offering 100 percent more longitudinal stability in climb and 24 percent more rate of climb at sea level. 670244. Aerodynamic Considerations of a Medium Mach Business Aeroplane. G. H. Lee, Handley Page Ltd. This paper illustrates in the context of the operational requirements for a business aircraft, the dependence of airframe design and powerplant choice on aerodynamics. The Handley Page Jetstream twin turboprop airplane at 12,500 lb. A.U.W. is used to illustrate this thesis. Performance and layout of executive and high-density versions, 300 mph cruising, stage ranges up to 2000 miles, payload up to 18 passengers and 2 crew, and low first and running costs, are covered. Among subjects discussed in detail are: 1 . Choice of wing area, planform and t/c ratio. 2. Choice of engines and propellers. 3. Modification of wing section to improve flow near trailing edge. 4. Tunnel tests to eliminate hysteresis with double slotted flap. 5. Tail unit design. The powerplant, Turbomeca Astazou XIV and Hamilton Standard propeller, is described. The direct control of propeller blade angle, characteristic of the Astazou, is shown to simplify piloting and increase safety. 670245. High Lift Techniques for STOL Aircraft. J. J. Cornish, III and R. F. Tanner, Lockheed- Georgia Co. This paper examines a number of the methods available for producing high lift as required by today's STOL aircraft and compares these methods on the basis of maximum lift coefficient. Most of the efforts to generate additional lift are directed toward providing favorable conditions for the boundary layer to prevent flow separation or to increase the projected wing area. Ideally a high lift system should make maximum use of both of these possibilities. High lift coefficients are well within the current state-of-the-art and have been so demonstrated by numbers of research aircraft. However, the resulting problems of control criteria and handling qualities requirements still present an obstacle to the increased utilization of high lift systems. SAE Transactions 670246. Preliminary Studies of a Supersonic Business Jet. Donneil W. Dutton, Georgia Inst, of Technology Two possible designs, an uns wept trapezoidal wing model and an essentially delta wing model for a 10-passenger Mach 2.2 supersonic business jet are discussed. The studies are quite preliminary in nature and the result of team efforts in two different Senior Aerospace Vehicle Design courses at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The philosophy of the course and the selection of this particular aircraft as a project design are touched upon briefly. The two designs are discussed in regard to their aerodynamic performance, engines, and propulsion systems. Costs, and probable noise level, including the sonic boom problem, are estimated. They are not considered solution aircraft, but the designs are believed to be fairly representative of what the resulting aircraft would resemble. The work is continuing through re-cycling and optimization of the performance by computer techniques. 670247. Jet Age Fueling Systems for Smaller Airports. Ross L. Jackson, Humble Oil and Refining Co. Smaller jet aircraft have created a need for jet fuel facilities at smaller airports. Principles of fuel handling have been developed to prevent known jet fuel contaminants from being delivered into aircraft. Typical airport facilities have been developed to fulfill requirements for safety, fuel quality, and ease of operation. If a jet fuel system is designed and operated properly, clean, dry fuel can be consistently delivered into aircraft. 670248. Present-Day Lubricants for Utility Aircraft Engines. H. A. Poitz, Shell Oil Co. At the present time, there are four basic kinds of oils available for utility aircraft piston engines; two of these can be considered major types and two minor, but of considerable interest. These are: nonadditive straight mineral oil; ashless dispersant mineral oils; metallic additive detergent mineral oils; synthetic oils. This paper discusses the merits of each of these major types of oil and compares their relative advantages in 96</page><page sequence="34">670249-670254 several categories. The paper also develops some of the reasons why the ashless dispersant mineral oils have made such gains in usage since introduced to the market in 1958. There is also a discussion and clarification of the terms "dispersant" and "detergent" as applied to additive oils. 670249. Cold Starting and Service Test Evaluation of an SAE 10W30 Aircraft Engine Oil. Bruce N. Marks, Cessna Aircraft Co. The versatile, small utility, business and private aircraft often operates from strips where external power and engine preheat are not available. Starting tests performed at 0 F have shown that with all engine conditions normal (standard SAE 30 aircraft engine oil, external power source, and functioning prime system), an engine start is unlikely. Faster cranking speeds are known to contribute substantially to improved starting, and can be obtained through the use of less viscous lubricating oils. An SAE 10W30 aircraft engine oil, compounded to promote easier cold weather starting and offering adequate protection at normal operating temperatures, is discussed and comparisons are drawn between this oil and other available multiviscosity oils. Results from cold weather starting tests as well as a service test program performed to support the use of the 10W30 oil under normal hot weather operating conditions are presented. 670250. New Trends in Aircraft Direct Current Systems. Henry W. Gayek, General Elee. Co. New electronic devices such as the silicon rectifier, transistor, silicon controlled rectifier, and miniature electromagnetic relay are changing the complexion of aircraft d-c generating systems. Their application has resulted in the introduction of a static equivalent of the familiar carbon pile regulator and of the overvoltage relay, as well as a unique protector against feeder faults. As developed by General Electric, these new products provide better voltage regulation, improved engine starts, and better system protection. They are smaller, lighter, and longer-lived than the older electromechanical devices. Brushless d-c generators, also made possible through the use of modern semiconductors, bring relief from old-time maintenance problems of brush and commutator wear. All these new products represent new trends in aircraft d-c systems. 670251. New Look in Avionics Equipment. Keith L. Fletcher, Collins Radio Co. New packaging concepts for avionics equipment are evolving as a result of extensive use of microcircuits and thin film circuits. These components, essentially planar in configuration, have naturally led to the development of new planar packaging systems. A system of this type currently being implemented uses planar circuit boards of a unique new design and also provides a method of packaging these boards in separate planar sections. Two or more of these sections, each with its own connector and dust cover, may constitute a complete airborne function such as VOR or VHF communication. The sections, which are shorter than standard ARINC units because of increased packaging efficiency, also facilitate equipment installation in smaller aircraft. 670252. Airborne Weather Radar. G. A. Lucchi, Radio Corp. of America A number of design parameters are traded off in the design of an airborne weather radar system. The inter-relative effects of design tradeoffs can be meaningfully approximated by application of the standard range equation which takes into account such items as peak transmitter power, width of the transmitted pulse, target area and reflectivity characteristics, transmitter wavelength, antenna gain, and the receiver overall noise figure. Selection of that radar system which is best suited to the particular aircraft to be equipped not only increases the utility of the aircraft, but also the safety of operation within given weather margins. Optimal allowances made for such installational limitations as reflector size, radome design, and temperature environments enhance both the performance and the reliability of the radar. 670253. Impact of Microelectronic Technology on General Aviation Avionics. E. B. Moore, Aircraft Radio Corp. Microelectronic devices are the natural next phase in the evolutionary cycle which comprises miniaturized, tran- sistorized, and solid state components. Microelectronics refers to a miniature device that will make it possible to manufacture electronic equipment smaller than has been done in the past. Of greater significance than the smallness of the devices is the reliability, maintainability, and ultimately the cost factors of such devices. This paper describes various microelectronic devices currently in use and presents photographic illustrations. New products will be manufactured and marketed which will make far greater use of such devices, and, in many instances, cause a significant change in design concepts used to achieve the functions of avionics in general aviation aircraft. 670254. Category II Avionics System. John F. Morehead, Rockwell-Standard Corp., Aero Commander Bethany Div. The electronics package for a Category II qualified business jet aircraft and the function of the various components of the system are described. These components include: dual Collins 51-RV-l VOR/ILS/G.S. receivers which provide and utilize beams along which the aircraft descends for a safe approach; a Collins AL-101 radio altimeter to determine altitude; dual flight directors for automatic and manual approaches; and a Collins 54W-1 comparator warning system, to name a few. A general rather than a technical approach is used. 97</page><page sequence="35">670255-670262 670255. Automatic Flight Control Development for General Aviation. Lee J. Vetter, Honeywell, Inc., Aerospace Div. A fluidic flight control system has been flight tested to develop and evaluate vortex rate sensors, fluidic amplifiers, dynamic shaping techniques and system accuracy. Discussed are results which have confirmed applicability of conventional control theory and projected high reliability. Also discussed is a stabilization system featuring an electropneumatic servo actuator with variable transfer function and unique characteristics for application to a range of stabilization problems. Recent electronic system studies have shown substantial improvement in reliability, maintainability, size, weight and cost reduction by use of microelectronic functional modules as alternates to individually-mounted discrete components.

A new air traffic control system has been designed and is now being implemented, in order to alleviate problems in the present system which have resulted from the constant increase in air traffic since 1950. This new system is commonly called the Beacon System, and is defined in a U. S. National Standard. It automatically provides the air traffic controller with an identified three dimensional radar screen presentation of every properly equipped aircraft within his control area. New ground and airborne equipment is required for this system. The airborne equipment required includes an altitude sensing and digitizing device, a 4096 code transponder, and an antenna. 670257. Certification of the Sabreliner Safe Life Structure. Clyde W. King, North Amer. Aviation, Inc., Sabreliner Div. Unique, in an era of fail-safe airplane designs, is the safe-line Sabreliner, twin-jet executive airplane. A description of the methods of fatigue analysis and tests which weree required to obtain Federal Aviation Agency certification under the Transport Category are presented. The overall program of tests is briefly described, with the major discussion devoted to the fatigue evaluation. The Sabreliner evolved from the T-39 military trainer which was certificated to the Air Force requirement of 10,000 hr; however, even under the stringent FAA requirements, a considerably longer life was foreseen for the commercial version - the Sabreliner. Currently, analysis and tests are well along toward the target fatigue life of 30,000 hr. 670259. Design of a Small Pressurized Aircraft Structure. Philip H. Furman, Mooney Aircraft, Inc. A recent trend in the light aircraft division of the business aircraft industry is toward cabin pressurization and higher operating altitudes. Factors affecting the design of the fuselage on these aircraft include pressurization schedules, intended operation of the aircraft, environ- mental limits, cabin configurations, production methods, FAA fatigue strength requirements, tests and evaluation, economics, and sealing techniques. Programs and techniques developed for the transport industry are not necessarily useful in light aircraft applications. This paper discusses selection of cross-sectional shapes, evolution of basic design philosophies ("safe life" versus "fail safe" approach), and materials and stress levels used in design of small pressurized aircraft structures. 670260. Flutter Characteristics of the Slab Tail. John A. McKillop, Engineering Res. Associates The slab tail, or stabilator is a comparatively popular design feature of modern business airplanes. Unlike conventional controls, however, there are no rules nor criteria for flutter prevention for slab configurations. The several types of flutter that can occur in a slab tail installation have been studied in the hope that a meaningful flutter criterion can be developed. Un- fortunately, too many independent parameters affect the flutter characteristics for this objective to be realized. The influence of these parameters is shown, and some rules are derived which should be useful to the slab tail designer. SA E Transactions 670261. Flying Qualities Research for General Aviation. George E. Miller and David R. Ellis, Princeton Univ. The variable-stability airplane used as an in-flight simulator has been an important and effective research tool in the field of handling qualities requirements for military aircraft. Such a machine is equally well-suited for studies of the general aviation airplane-pilot combination, with the objective of defining optimum and minimum acceeptable values of flying qualities parameters for use as design and certification guides. 670262. Recent Developments in Instrumentation and Fuel Systems for Turbocharged and/or Pressurized Aircraft. H. W. Kaatz, Fred Wilhelm, Leo Tobacman and L. L. Aspelin, Airborne Mfg. Co. Recent engine developments have increased altitude performance of light aircraft. Operation at altitudes above 15,000 ft demands changes in the air operated instrument systems and fuel systems in order to assure dependable operation throughout the new altitude ranges. The first section, on pneumatic systems, deals with the requirements and considerations leading to the conversion from vacuum to pressure operated gyro, autopilot, and deicer boot systems. The second section, on fuel systems, is intended to aid in the solving of the present fuel systems vapor lock 98</page><page sequence="36">670263-670269 problem. A discussion on aviation gasoline includes a tabulation of most of the hydrocarbons, including the classes of hydrocarbons used in this fuel, together with the vapor pressure, boiling point, and heating value of each. A description of the ASTM distillation tests and the Reid vapor pressure equipment is included, since these characteristics affect the volatility and vapor locking tendency. A qualitative description of how vapor lock occurs in the suction piping and its accessories is included. Early Air Force effort is described, tabulating several approaches, and the results. Three twin engine fuel systems are described. 670263. Current Survey of Aircraft Fuel Gaging Systems. L. M. Weixelman, Electronic Communications Inc., Std. Precision Div. Fuel gaging systems in over 90 percent of small civil aircraft use the automotive float type sender with an electrical indicator. Considering such factors as dihedral, summing, temperature, variation in specific gravity of fuel used, and input voltage, the accuracy is approximately plus or minus 5 percent of full scale and plus or minus 10 percent of the reading. A more accurate system is highly desirable for weight control, flight planning, and possible e.g. consideration. Among other gaging systems available are improved float types at moderate costs, capacitive systems with good accuracy at comparatively high initial cost and increased maintenance, and a mass sensing system at moderate cost. The pros and cons of each system are discussed. Factors contributing to errors in readout and often overlooked are variations in height versus volume of fuel tanks because of manufacturing tolerances, and changes in shape and relative position of tanks under different loading when in flight. 670264. Business and Financial Ramifications of Our Present Air and Airport Traffic Control. Randall H. Carpenter, Wayfarer Ketch Corp. The phenomenal growth in air operations of all kinds may have an inhibiting effect on corporation and business aviation in particular, and ultimately on all of general aviation. Delays occasioned by either ATC or airport acceptance rate become a very important cost consideration in the operation of the aircraft. The author uses the New York - Boston - Washington complex for illustration, giving sample costs involved in such delays. To further illustrate the problem, a Port of New York Authority survey on air requirements for the New York area is discussed. 670265. Federal Aviation Agency Air Traffic Control Development Program. John A. Weber, Federal Aviation Agency This paper discusses the increasing growth in air traffic due to the introduction of the turbine-powered transport and to the growth of general aviation of all kinds. Presented in the paper are some of the Federal Aviation Agency's development programs for expanding the capability of air route traffic control centers and terminal control facilities, for increasing the usefulness of the navigation and landing aids to more airports, and for increasing airport capacity. 670266. Air and Airport Traffic Control Problems. Horace E. Wood, Gillette Co., Aviation Dept. It is forecast that the number of business-use aircraft will substantially increase by 1975. Unless solutions at hand are implemented in the near future, air traffic congestion and the attendant delays and loss of time and money caused by this situation will assume alarming proportions. This paper discusses how airport capacity can be increased through proper layout of runways, and how improvements in airport traffic control procedures can be effected through such means as greater flexibility in assigning aircraft to alternate runways, simultaneous and independent IFR operations, and use of computer data to transmit directional and distance information to pilots. On the whole, it is concluded that all phases of the problem can be solved using current concepts and existing, tested equipment. 670267. Powerplant Pressurization for Altitude. Don Trompler and James B. O'Reilly, Mooney Aircraft, Inc. Aircraft cabin pressurization is a means of providing an adequate cabin environment while achieving the performance available from a supercharged engine. The Mooney M22 is a single-engine pressurized four-to-five place aircraft powered by an engine incorporating a small low cost exhaust drive turbosupercharger based on a diesel automotive unit. By means of this turbocharger, the M22 was pressurized and met its performance goals while remaining close to the same economic class as previous conventional single-engine aircraft. 670269. Test Results of an All-Mechanical Flight Control System Utilizing a Cascade Toroidal Servo. Raymond Kerner, North Amer. Aviation, Inc., Los Angeles Div. An all-mechanical flight control system is potentially adaptable for high-temperature operation, high structual stiffness, lighter weight, and increased reliability. A mechanical cascade toroidal servo was tested on the North American Aviation F-100 flight control simulator. This was the second toroidal servo tested. The improvement over its predecessor was primarily the reduction of pilot operating forces. This mechanical servo incorporated a miniature servo into the input control linkage of the original servo configuration. In this way, the pilot controlled the miniature command or pilot servo and subsequently controlled the power servo with reduced input force. This mechanical servo, like its predecessor, was based upon a proportional control concept which converted unidirectional rotational 99</page><page sequence="37">670270-670277 100 mechanical energy to provide bidirectional control surface motion through power hinges at the surface as a function of pilot input commands. This paper discusses: (1) the results of this latest test program; (2) the static and dynamic characteristics of the servo and of the complete control system; (3) a comparison of the performance of this latest servo configuration with those of the original and, when possible, the performance with a conventional hydraulic system; and (4) the mechanical failures that occurred during the test program. 670270. Progress in Earthmoving. R. G. LeTourneau, LeTourneau /R. G./, Inc. This paper sketches briefly the development of earthmoving equipment at LeTourneau from the early days of the company. It relates the story behind the development of the electric wheel, diggers, dozers, telescoping buckets, side dump trucks, front end loaders, and the like. The substitution of rubber tires for steel ones and the use of electricity instead of hydraulics are also discussed briefly. 670271. REDSOD New Concept in Earthmoving. John M. Clark, Jr., Roger H. Hemion and Robinson W. Brown, Southwest Res. Inst.; and Delmar L. Craft, Army Engr. Res. and Dev. Labs. REDSOD, an acronym for Repetitive Explosive Device for Soil Displacement, utilizes the energy generated within a combustion chamber by the combustion of compressed air and a hydrocarbon fuel to displace and move soil or material. An integral wedge-shaped base shoe with a large exhaust opening in its top surface is pushed into a soil overburden at depths up to 5 or more ft by a transporting vehicle. When the combustion chamber pressure has reached a maximum value, the hot, high pressure gases are released through the exhaust opening under the soil overburden. The soil is disaggregated and displaced up and out of the excavation. Deflectors can turn the direction of the soil's trajectory to deliver it to one side of the excavation. A greatly increased productivity per unit of equipment is possible over conventional earthmoving means. SAE Transactions 670272. Euclid R-X Truck - A New Concept in Off-Road Rear Dump Vehicles. A. C. Eubanks and R. J. Bernotas, Euclid Div., GMC One of the latest off-road, rear dump truck developments in the earthmoving industry is GMC Euclid Division's R-X truck, an all-wheel drive vehicle capable of hauling payloads up to 105 tons, at speeds of 53 mph. The R-X truck incorporates many innovations new to off-road truck design. A hinged frame, pivot steering arrangement, and equal load distribution on the two drive axles provide exceptional tractive effort and maneuverability. It reduces tire scrubbing in turns, which has been a major contributor to excessive tire wear, and allows the use of smaller tires, which lowers load height. Also unique in the R-X truck design is the suspension system which features the use of a patented "A" frame axle mounting which maintains axle alignments while permitting oscillation against stacked rubber disc spring members. 670273. Mining - A Problem in Earthmoving. Ernest M. Spokes, Missouri Univ. at Rolla The mining industry of the United States moves about 7 billion tons of earth and rock per year. Much conventional earthmoving equipment is used in mining, particularly surface mining, but the special problems of the industry suggest that machines designed for mining would be better than machines designed for the construction industry in many applications. Underground mining now uses little automotive equipment. Systems of mining are reviewed to suggest to designers possible applications for new types of automotive equipment. 670275. Equipment Selection, Operation and Maintenance at Mangia Dam. Ray N. Atkinson, Atkinson /Guy F./ Co. The unprecedented size of the Mangia Dam Project has led to the selection, operation and maintenance of the largest peacetime construction fleet ever assembled. Equipment selection was carefully made, native operators trained and modern production techniques practiced. Resultant mechanical problems were resolved and routine repairs were accomplished by an energetic maintenance program, thus satisfactory results have been achieved by combining American construction industry know-how with good construction machinery and vendor service. 670276. Earthmoving-A Challenge in Australian Iron Mining. J. S. Abdnor, Pickands Mather and Co. Open pit iron mining includes a great deal of earthmoving. Described in this paper is the development of the Savage River open pit mine in Tasmania. The mine will be a mile long and one-quarter of a mile wide to a depth of 800 ft. The installation will include crushing and separating equipment to remove the ore from the mined rock, a water slurry to carry the concentrated ore to the pellet plant, and a conveyor to carry the pellets to the shiploading facilities. In addition, a complete town to house the workers is being built. Described are the financing of the project, the problems of operation in a foreign country, and equipment used. 670277. Mass Movement of Excavation at Oroville Dam. J. Rodney Mims, Oman Construction Co. The Oroville Dam on the Feather River in California is one of the most automated construction jobs in the world. The approaches and equipment used have application to many other construction projects. This paper discusses in detail the design of the embankment dam, the embankment materials, and the equipment used to strip the area of the dam and to move the embankment</page><page sequence="38">670278-670286 materials. A railroad was constructed to haul embankment materials from the borrow pits to the main damsite. The railroad hauls the material to a reclaim tunnel at the site, a conveyor belt carries the material to a truck loading hopper, where trucks pick up the material for transport to final placement in the embankment. Excluding the truck drivers, the operation is run by 18 men. 670278. Belt Conveyors in Mining and Construction. Jim W. Symonds, Peter Kiewit-Sons Inc. The development and installation of the world's longest steel cable belt conveyor system is described. This conveyor, with a total length of over 30,000 ft, has been employed to transport approximately 108 million tons of glacial moraine material to the construction site of the Portage Mountain Dam in Vancouver, British Columbia. Its use in this connection has proven that conveyors can be an economical transportation tool under favorable conditions. 670279. Contractor's Tire Problem. Charlie E. Sanders, Green Construction Co. Although tires represent a major portion of the operating cost on rubber-tired earthmoving equipment, these costs are not as scientifically predictable as explosive costs or ripper teeth replacement costs when estimating a job. Tires have not developed at the same rate equipment manufacturers have improved the design and resulting performance of rubber tired equipment. Each year the construction jobs grow more rugged. The nature of jobs is such that tires for haulage equipment must be suitable for the short haul as well as the long haul type jobs. Although excellent haul roads can be maintained between the cut and fill areas, work at the cut and fill expose the tires to severe cutting. An integral part of the development of a suitable tire construction technique should be a low cost method of repairing a damaged carcass, thereby providing an extension of the tire life. Together with this a recapping should be developed which will give this tire the same reliability as a new tire in the larger earthmoving sizes. 670280. Testing Techniques and Recent Developments in Earthmover Tires. R. L. Wann, Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. Testing techniques involving tires and tire components are discussed. New developments such as Super Deep tread design, improved repairs, and portable scale are covered as they relate to improved off-the-road tire performance. These new techniques and developments are the result of extensive investigation and testing in both laboratory and field. The weighing device described here is an effective tool in selecting type, load, and air pressure of high performance tires. 670281. Engineering and Economics of Earthmover Tires. S. J. Sitko, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. Earthmover tire technology has expanded in recent years not only in construction and compounding but also in furnishing larger and larger sizes to provide the required capacity for new high capacity scrapers, trucks, dozers, and loaders. Actual service results show that the theory and economics of large tire usages in high capacity equipment is well established and on a sound footing. SA E Transactions 670282. Challenge of Construction Equipment Safety. K. L. Mason, Caterpillar Tractor Co. Safety in construction equipment is a challenge to the engineer. This paper discusses the determination of accident causes, the determination and application of preventative measures, and communication to the man in the seat. The achievement by the operator of an understanding of what to do and how to do it is cited as the most difficult of these challenges. 670283. Vehicle Braking Systems Can Be Safer. R. C. Bueler, Wagner Elee. Corp. Vehicle braking systems consist of four basic elements: generation, storage, control, and transmission of braking effort. The method of energy storage used as well as the interrelationship between it and the three remaining system elements, and the vehicle operator and foundation brakes greatly affect system reliability. Control should remain with the operator for both service and emergency actuation, except in extenuating circumstances wherein the driver fails to act. 670285. Quest for the Ultimate in Gear Load Carrying Capacity. Darle W. Dudley and Robert E. Purdy, Mechanical Technology Inc. There is some ultimate load carrying capacity that can be achieved with gears. In general, most designs fall considerably short of achieving the ultimate in capacity. This paper presents new information on the ultimate capacity that might be achieved and what it takes to achieve it. The paper also discusses new developments that may lead to an even higher ultimate capacity in the future. 670286. Progress in Hough Payloader Productivity with the H-400. Richard H. Marshall, International Harvester Co., Hough Div. This paper covers the development of a front end shovel loader capable of meeting market requirements for increased productivity at lower cost per ton or cubic yard. Use of bigger hauling units required much larger mobile loading equipment, and on-the-job experience and research promptly determined the size and features required for its profitable manufacture. Following design and building of prototypes, proving ground, field, and laboratory testing eliminated deficiencies and the result, the Hough Model H-400, became available in 1965 as the world's largest production-built articulated loader. 101</page><page sequence="39">670287-670301 102 670287. Giant Tractor Shovel - The 475. Jay S. Jarpe and Gene F. Hand, Clark Equip. Co. Production cost analyses show a potential economic advantage for the giant loaders on large jobs. This paper presents a cost comparison between the Model 475 tractor shovel, a smaller tractor shovel, and a swing shovel. Evolutionary events and designs leading to the creation of the 475 are presented and discussed. Design considerations and specific features of this unit are pointed out. Some of these are: loader linkage design, hollow boom construction, split hydraulic system, and a hydraulic power assist for operator controls. Prototype testing and changes are discussed and explained. 670291. (P-15) Advances in the Use of Computers for Handling Human Factors Task Data. Lawrence E. Reed, Aerospace Medical Res. Labs. The relative simplicity of early systems was such that human requirements (skills) were easily interchanged within and between systems. Current complex aerosystems are accompanied by an increased need for closer consideration of the human component. The amounts of information generated and the compressed developmental schedules have led the specialist to rely heavily on his own expertise when existing data are not known to exist or are inaccessible. As such, the input to early identification of requirements and the integration of these requirements into training programs has suffered. In 1963, the Aerospace Medical Research Laboratories and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, initiated a joint research program to explore, and where possible, develop techniques for handling and processing human factors task data (task analysis/maintenance analysis). It is anticipated that the techniques will assist the human factors specialist in industry and the government to make better use of available data for making decisions about the training of system maintenance and operator personnel. The techniques will also be useful in carrying out a variety of other functions related to the human side of aerospace system development. 670292. (P-15) New Look in TWA Training. D. M. Crowley, Trans World Airlines, Inc. The new TWA DC-9 training program is based on the "Instructional Systems Approach" which is a highly structured, step-by-step, controlled learning system. It is goal and results-oriented and produces most rapid individual learning. The system uses a classroom responder system and other programed-type learning aids. This new approach to training results in 30 percent reduction in training time coupled with a very high quality of achievement. Industrial training and education are on the brink of revolutionary change and TWA's DC-9 training program is the beginning of the total change required. SAE Transactions 670295. (P-15) Medical Human Factors Aspects of Jetliner Flight in Severe Turbulence. C. R. Harper, United Air Lines, Inc. It was noticed in 1964 that many accidents occur when jetliners enter severe air turbulences. Studies revealed that pilot performance is compromised in many ways. To prevent this, flight crews should be properly restrained during all phases of flight. They should trust the gyrohorizon as the only reliable attitude indicator, and they should be aware of the fact that "railroad track" turbulences may terminate in unusually severe turbulences. Also, the most reliable and readable artificial horizon should support the pilot. SAE Transactions 670297. (P-15) Urgent Need for Flight Simulators for Present and Future Aircraft. John Rhodes, Trans World Airlines, Inc. Training requirements of the current commercial subsonic jet programs and those of the manned space flight projects have dictated rapid expansion in the state of the art of simulation development. A concept of flight realism, before unknown, is being developed into our future simulators. These concepts are being formulated using past experience as a foundation to determine our needs; and technology developed in the the space age to be our tools. The realization of training transfer to the high degree required will come with the further development of simulation environment, instrument presentation, motion systems with 6 degrees of freedom for "g" force inputs, and real world visual presentation. Many of these are already realized; the rest are in advanced development stages. 670300. (P-15) Survey of Flight Simulation Computation Methods. Laurence E. Fogarty, Michigan Univ. An historical review of developments in flight simulator computation methods indicates that the computation load has been increasing by about a factor of ten every ten years for the last thirty years. From a brief analysis of computation methods used on a typical modern digital flight simulator it is concluded that these methods are more than adequate for the simulation task as now defined. Additional new simulation requirements such as computer-aided instruction methods and computer-based navigation techniques apparently will require very large additional simulator computer capacity in the near future. 670301. (P-15) Future Potential and Requirements of Digital Simulation. John M. Hunt, General Precision, Inc. A very large increase in the ratio of digital computer capabilities (memory capacity and operating speed) to computer cost is forecast in the next decade. This paper considers a number of aspects of the design, construction and use of modern digital flight and space trainers with</page><page sequence="40">670302-670307 the thought of exploitation of presently unobtainable computer capacity to maximize simulator usefulness and to minimize total simulator costs. New methods of visual and radar simulation made feasible only through the use of super computers are discussed. Methods of utilizing large computer capacity to supplement or eliminate existing simulator hardware elements are outlined. Consideration is given to the opportunities for material reduction in simulator maintenance time and increase in simulator reliability and availability through the use of increased available computer power. SAE Transactions 670302. (P-15) Need for State-of-the-Art Advances in Maintenance Training Equipment. John H. Koch, Koch Training Consultants An extensive analysis of aircraft technician training levels, methods, and equipments has been developed. This analysis positively indicates trending of the generally skilled into specialties. It has uncovered areas of serious undertraining in specialty due to lack of specialty training equipments. Dominant among the factors influencing this negative trend is the compounding complexity presented training tool and method developers, wherein general type equipment and methods must now be replaced by multiple individual specialty program equipment training packages. Compact series of specialty method tools are being devised to reverse trend in training deficiencies in specialty, prior to advent of second generation jets. 670303. (P-15) Visual Simulation - Where We Are - Where We Are Going. Douglas Wilson, General Precision Systems Ltd. Visual simulation has added a new dimension to flight training simulators. Monochrome TV projection preceded the early color displays which are, in turn, superseded by high definition color systems incorporating features such as full runway and approach lighting. The paper outlines the progress in visual simulation and high definition color systems which we have today. The requirements of all-weather operation are detailed. New developments are discussed which will further advance the art of visual simulation. 670304. (P-15) Flight Simulator Motion, Its Enhancement and Potential for Flight Crew Training. Frank H. Borlace, CAE Industries Ltd. Concepts of motion systems which have not been fully utilized for training flight simulators, and which promise to provide a more accurate motion system representation are discussed. An examination of the vestibular system is made and the information it gives to the pilot is shown to be of a "phase advance nature." Some programming considerations of motion systems are presented. The desirability of custom designing the motion system to aid in training the pilot for specific tasks is also discussed. SAE Transactions 670305. (P-15) Aerospace Concepts Applied to Deep Submergence Vehicle Simulation. James D. Goff, Northrop Corp., Nortronics Div. The methodology employed in the derivation of simulation equipment requirements for a Deep Sub- mergence Vehicle DS/V is described, together with an outline of the hardware design concepts adopted or considered. The parallel is drawn between methodology and equipment used for a DS/V simulator, and that found in most aircraft or spacecraft simulators. In order to better understand the parallel, a brief discussion of the history and operation of a DS/V is included. SAE Transactions 670306. (P-15) Influence of Piloted Flight Simulator Studies on the Design of the SST Instruments. Gordon D. Annin, Boeing Co., Airplane Div. For the Boeing SST, flight simulators are providing important insight into problems of stability, control, and flight information display in advance of the actual cutting of metal for flying hardware. Simulator investigations have yielded tentative solutions to several flight instrumentation problems: the optimum scale factor for the pilot's pitch indicator; the economical evaluation of experimental landing displays through the use of cathode ray tube line-writing techniques; and the development of a display system for informing the pilot of his situation with respect to a prescribed sonic-boom-limited climb or descent profile. SAE Transactions 670307. (P-15) SST Training Program Considerations. John J. Carroll and Raymond Ziesmer, Federal Aviation Agency, Office of SST Dev. The development of training programs for ground and flight personnel for system operation of the United States Supersonic Transport is a responsibility shared by the Office of SST Development, the FAA, the airframee and engine manufacturers, and the eventual operators of the airlines. Today's engineering development, experimental and flight simulators, are providing the basis for definition of optimum operating procedures, standards, identification of efficient instructional procedures, and for an eventual safe and economic means to evaluate crewmember capabilities, safety, and proficiency. Closer cooperation and coordination between flight operations personnel and simulator design engineers is considered essential if the results are to be achieved by establishing effective training programs for the Supersonic Transport. 103</page><page sequence="41">670308-670315 104 670308. (P-15) Programmed Instruction and Computer- Assisted Instruction - How They Can Be Used Effectively in Our Training Programs. Leonard C. Silvern, Education and Training Consultants Co. Programmed Instruction, a method of teaching subject- matter without the intervention of a human instructor, is being used profitably in civilian and military aerospace applications. A more sophisticated technique which utilizes time-sharing computer systems, Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI), provides a learner-machine relationship not previously obtainable. The evolving roles of the participants are discussed: learner, instructor, instructional programmer, computer programmer, computer operator, and training director. Reference is made to CAI software systems and languages, and the development of "Elements of EYBOL," a missile orientation training program is described in detail. SA E Transactions 670309. (P-15) Using Simulation for Research - and Using Research to Develop Valid Simulation Techniques. Roy F. Brissenden, Langley Res. Center, NASA The major factors involved in designing simulators that have "practical" fidelity without being overdesigned is outlined. A closed-loop logic for the development and use of simulation is set forth. The simulation approach is developed around three basic design categories - the basic computer and servomechanism technology, the human engineering criteria, and control information. The control-information category is discussed extensively, and representative fixed- and moving-base research simulators in use at the Langley Research Center are presented to describe specific display designs and motion-cue effects. SAE Transactions 670311. (P-15) Review of the Current Policy in the United Kingdom for the Use of Flight Simulators in Flight Crew Training and Checking. W. E. B. Griffiths, Board of Trade, Civil Aviation Dept., England The history of flight simulator acceptance in the United Kingdom is covered. In 1951, the Ministry of Civil Aviation allowed the use of Redifon/BOAC Stratocruiser flight simulators to conduct Statutory instrument rating renewal tests. In 1960, the use of simulators was extended to bi-annual competency tests for pilots and flight engineers. The paper also explains why, with the advent of SST's and jumbo jets, flight simulators will play an even larger part in pilot training and checking. 670312. (P-15) Can Flight Training Take Lessons from Our Astronaut Training Program?. Robert S. Buchanan, Air Force Aerospace Res. Pilot School; and John Prodan, Air Force Aerospace Res. Pilot School, Simulation Div. Flight training can take lessons from the astronaut training program. Specifically: (1) each phase of flight training - initial, instrument, upgrading, and requalification - will benefit from using the same instructor in all areas of instruction including academics, simulation, and flight, (2) extensive use of high fidelity simulation devices (either airborne or ground) is highly desirable to provide the pilot with the knowledge necessary for understanding and solving the problems of flight in more than a procedural sense, (3) emphasis in any phase of flight training must be placed upon the development of a "think for yourself" capability rather than a reliance upon memorized procedures, ground management or a "school solution" approach. Application of these training procedures, along with an emphasis on general knowledge (as opposed to specific answers to test questions) can be a step toward airplane pilot performance comparable to that of the astronauts. 670314. (P-15) Experimental Device for the Study of the Physiological Functions of Equilibration. P. Vidal and J. M. Toulotte, Lille Univ., Faculty of Science Human reaction to a shock or vibration input is graphically demonstrated in the horizontal plane. Subjects are dispaced while standing on a calibrated platform. Learning times to regain equilibrium are improved if subjects can watch graphical plot of their reactions. The utilization of an analog computer made it possible, thanks to its flexibility, to study physiological functions of equilibration. Moreover, recordings of complex functions (derivative, integral, etc.) of the output signal can be thought of. However, the preceding experiments are still at the stage of elaboration. The study of pathological cases will lead to a more global understanding of the phenomenon and will be published later on. 670315. (P-15) Conjunctive War Gaming. Paul Brock, General Elee. Co. There has been extensive work done to develop and to apply a number of War Gaming Simulation Techniques. Many informative and provocative documents have been published on the subject. In prior work at the RAND Corporation and at the Army Combat Development Experimentation Center, the author has studied and used varied war gaming techniques. From this advantageous view of the subject an attempt is made to codify war gaming techniques, as they seem to form an homogeneous subject area. This structuring allows for potentially more ways of utilizing an expanding existing methodology. Indications of richer and stronger techniques are developed in the report. It is hoped that the results discussed here can assist</page><page sequence="42">670316-670324 the staffs of those organizations who have the responsibility for generating war game simulations for analysis purposes. It is also hoped that users of war gaming simulation techniques may gain a better understanding of their values and capabilities through the critiques that are expounded in the paper. 670316. Reliability Assurance and the Concorde Engines. B. G. Markham, Bristol Siddeley Engs. Ltd. This paper explains the background of the Concorde engines and how a design specifically for civil operation has been derived from a military supersonic engine. It reports a study of the failure pattern of current engines, which shows that the traditional approach to reliability must be extended by all means available. Reference is made to the application of the disciplines of reliability engineering and the special design features to assure safety and reliability. The test program and some of the special test equipment required for a supersonic engine are described. SA E Transactions 670317. Reliability Development on the GE4. D. Q. Marshall and H. T. Gieryn, General Elee. Co. The introduction of a supersonic transport directly into commercial service presents a reliability challenge to its developers. Six reliability methods used to insure early reliability of the supersonic transport engine are identified. One of these techniques, the Reliability Analysis Program, is fully described. Early results of these programs in the GE4 SST development are given. 670318. Reliability Development of the Boeing SST Inlet, Control, and Power System. James R. Moorehead, Boeing Co. Functional requirements and limitations of the Boeing supersonic inlet system are presented and several of the design considerations are discussed. Some trade studies are defined and examples of current hardware concepts are presented. The overall reliability program is discussed in terms of the test program, design objectives, and cost considerations. 670319. Plans for the New Tampa International Airport. George Bean, Tampa International Airport A new design concept - airside/landside - has been advanced by the Hillsborough County Aviation Authority in its plan for the Tampa International Airport passenger terminal. By drawing together heretofore-separated activities of airline passengers on the ground, terminal sprawl is avoided. Basic elements of the design include the central landside building, at the hub of a spoked wheel, where the separate activities of processing arriving and departing passengers and their baggage are stacked vertically, along with auto structural parking, in a multistory structure serviced by a series of vertical elevators and escalators. On the rim of the wheel are the airside satellites devoted directly to loading and offloading of passengers, baggage, and cargo, and the handling and servicing of aircraft. Electrically propelled, automatically controlled, enclosed vehicles will shuttle passengers speedily between the landside activity center and the aircraft-oriented airsides. The Passenger Transfer System will be elevated, allowing 360 deg circulation of ground traffic around the central landside, where all forms of public and private transportation will be accommodated. SA E Transactions 670320. Airline Terminal Building Concept. Frank S. Pittenger, Aviation Dept., Kansas City, Missouri As a result of the planning effort for the new Mid-Continent International Airport at Kansas City, Mo., a concept of terminal design known as the "gate arrivai" scheme has emerged. It provides a practical approach to terminal complex design concept which: allows air passengers to alight from ground transportation virtually at the entrance to appropriate gate hold areas, and to depart by the same short routes; marries aircraft and automobile parking; and sharply reduces car to aircraft walking distance. 670322. Airport Accessibility: Growing Problem in the Jet Age. Clayton D. Peavey, Port of New York Authority Airports are rapidly growing as generators of trans- portation demand - to a point at which there is a substantial question as to the adequacy and ability of highway networks to serve future ground access needs as well as other metropolitan area travel needs. New and innovative approaches must be considered, including extensions of rail facilities to airports, exclusive bus lanes on existing or planned highways, and possible use of combination bus-rail vehicles when convenient rail trackage is available. Each possibility has advantages and disadvantages which must be taken into account by local areas in considering ways to meet the foreseeable need. SAE Transactions 670323. Conflicts and Identities of Interests - The Airport and the Community. Secor D. Browne, Massachusetts Inst, of Technology There are both conflicts of interest and identities of interest between the airport and the community. The former include: noise, land takings, danger of accidents, access traffic, air pollution. The latter include: availability of efficient transport, increased employment, better highway communications. 670324. Northeast Corridor Transportation Project Broad Gaged Transportation Planning.

Nelson, United States Dept. of Transportation The Northeast Corridor Project is the first broad systematic analysis of a region's transportation needs 105</page><page sequence="43">670325-670330 106 carried on in the country. This paper describes the Project, discusses its objectives, and reviews its progress. The major part of the Corridor analysis is to try to describe as accurately as possible the transportation systems, and combination of transportation systems, which are possible, and portray the consequences to individuals and the community of each of them. An engineering systems analysis of possible systems and a costing procedure are used to define systems which could be used in the Corridor. 670325. Operating Techniques and Maintenance Con- siderations for Air Inlet Controls in Airline Service. Robert D. Porter, United Aircraft Corp., Hamilton Standard Div. The supersonic transport will introduce into commercial service for the first time variable geometry air inlets and their related control systems. This paper discusses air inlet control system function and the effect of control performance on aircraft operation. The impact of these additional control functions on cockpit procedures is discussed, along with possible in-flight troubleshooting techniques. Ground support equipment provisions must be integrated into the system design to assure dispatch reliability of the aircraft. The effect of component reliability on dispatch reliability and maintainability is presented. SA E Transactions 670326. Fuel Control System of the GE4 Engine for the Supersonic Transport. John T. Moehring, General Elee. Co., Flight Propulsion Div. The design of the power control and fuel systems for the General Electric GE4 augmented turbojet engine selected to power the Boeing 2707 supersonic transport combines proved designs with technical innovation to strike a design balance meeting all the requirements for commercial airline service. Application of the integrated three-variable power control principles, long in production for supersonic military service, will ensure a successful transition from the simpler, single-variable power controls operating at subsonic conditions in today's airlines. The overall power control system operation of the GE4 engine is presented, followed by a more detailed account of the main and augmentation fuel and control subsystems. System design and component mechanization are shown and related to the factors that influenced the design. 670327. New Flight Instrumentation for Future Transport Aircraft. James R. Gannett, Boeing Co. Current studies of flight instruments at Boeing are aimed at improving the safety of approach and landing and the precision of terminal area navigation. Flight tests and simulation studies are being conducted in an efffort to determine the feasibility of various improved displays using current electronic technology. SA E Transactions 670328. Place and Capabilities of Modern Doppler Systems for Subsonic and Supersonic Aircraft. J. C. Forrest, General Precision, Inc. The considerable advances made in the Doppler radar and Doppler navigation system state-of-the-art since the early 1960's are described. A detailed comparison is made between the earlier Dopplers and today's vintage. A new Doppler-inertial system, currently being developed for the military, is described and where pertinent compared to a comparable pure inertial system. The analysis concludes that using this approach adequate navigation accuracy can be achieved for subsonic and supersonic transports at approximately one-third the cost of a comparably reliable inertial installation. 670329. Inertial Navigation Systems for Subsonic and Supersonic Commercial Aircraft. J. H. Sheldrick, AC Electronics Div., GMC During the past several years, the world's major airlines have been planning for the introduction of inertial navigation into scheduled airline operation. This effort has resulted in the generation of ARINC Characteristic 561. Systems which have been designed to this characteristic are expected to enter airline service in 1968. A description of the configuration of the "561" system is presented which includes the various aircraft interfaces, system modes of operation, and the performance which can be realized from such a system. In order to extend the capabilities of the basic 561 system, the airlines are about to begin generating Characteristic 562 which will describe a digital computer whose function it is to perform additional computations incidental to the navigation problem and to extend the 561 interface. Such extension will be desirable, for instance, in navigating the SST. A discussion of some of the candidate 562 functions is presented. This discussion includes: (1) vertical navigation, (2) bulk information storage (for VORTAC magnetic variation and chart data), (3) automatic chart displays, and (4) steering. Multisystem installations are also discussed. Particular attention is given to maintaining malfunction independence among the 561 and 562 elements. AC Electronics Carousel IV Navigator is used as an example of 561 hardware. 670330. Maintainability Design Requirements for Future Jet Engines. John J. Morelli, Trans World Airlines, Inc. On the wing repair is a new concept in jet engine management, rapidly spreading throughout the airline industry. This new approach now requires that maintain- ability be moved high on the list of design considerations on engines of tomorrow. Some specific maintainability design features are now clearly needed to permit expanding this concept beyond the scope of work now being accomplished. The next commercial engine must have these features.</page><page sequence="44">670331-670336 670331. Designing the JT9D Engine To Meet Low Noise Requirements for Future Transports. J. D.

The Aeronautical Engine Laboratory's Containment Evaluation Facility (AELCEF), featuring the government's largest spin chamber, high speed photographic equipment, and impact instrumentation, has been created and has recently become operational. This unique installation is described in detail. The first successful photographs ever taken of the interaction of rotor fragments and a containment ring are presented. Testing techniques and results are discussed. The ultimate goal of the AEL, NASA sponsored, integrated program of theoretical and experimental research work is to provide lightweight containment/control devices that will prevent the fragments of failed turbomachines from injuring personnel and minimize aircraft damage. 670333. Use of Composite Materials in Aero Engines. J. M. S. Keen, Rolls-Royce Ltd. Laboratory-achieved material properties have long indicated that significant reductions in aero-engine weight and cost might be achieved by the use of glassfibre reinforced composite materials. Prompted by this, in the early 1950's, Rolls-Royce instituted a research program into the use of composite materials for compressor blading. Successful conclusion of this program coincided with a requirement for which the sole engine function was to support a vertical take-off aircraft during transition. Weight and cost considerations led to the decision to fabricate the low temperature components of this engine (the Rolls-Royce RB.162) in glass reinforced composites. The properties of such materials are described and an outline is given of the design philosophy adopted in applying them to an aero-engine. Particulars are given relating to the construction of the front bearing housing, compressor casing and compressor blading. The application of RB.162 composite material experience to future commercial engines is considered. SAE Transactions 670334. T63 Engine Sand and Dust Tolerance Development and Field Experience.

Titanium Alloys for Advanced Compressors. R. A. Sprague, Duane L. Ruckle and M. J. Donachie, Jr., United Aircraft Corp., Pratt and Whitney Aircraft Engineering development has always been restricted by the limitations of structural materials. In the development of large fan stage compressor blades, material of high strength to density and modulus to density ratios have been required. This paper discusses use of titanium in the 170 and 190 ksi yield strength alloys in these applications. Materials, procedures, and results of the Pratt -I- Whitney development program are discussed. The Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn alloy appears most promising in meeting the desired 170 ksi yield strength while maintaining reasonable fracture toughness. The rela- tionship between toughness, fatigue, and other mechanical properties is incompletely understood. However, with high tensile preloads, a strong positive correlation between toughness and fatigue strength seems quite probable. SAE Transactions 670336. Low Cycle Fatigue Properties of Advanced Engine Materials. V. J. Mehra and J. Mogul, Curtiss-Wright Corp., Wright Aero. Div.; and Justin Slepitis, Taylor Forge and Pipe Co. Low-cycle fatigue is a term used to describe the thermal and/or mechanical loading conditions which cause premature failure of materials at less than 20,000 cycles. These cyclic stress conditions are prevalent during engine start up or shut down and in severe flight maneuvers. From the design standpoint, it is important to assess and predict the behavior of compressor and turbine component materials under these severe conditions. This paper presents the low cycle fatigue data on six candidate materials which were considered for an advanced engine. The materials were investigated simultaneously by pull-pull and by modified rotating beam fatigue testing techniques. Results indicate that the candidate materials can sustain appreciable cycling at stress levels beyond design limit before fracture occurs by the low cycle fatigue mechanism. Of the materials investigated, Udimet 630 exhibited the optimum low cycle fatigue resistance. SAE Transactions 107</page><page sequence="45">670337-670345 108 670337. Adopting Space Vehicular Check-Out Procedures and Philosophy to Near-Future Transport Aircraft. Joseph G. Wohl, Dunlap and Associates This paper describes potential applications of space vehicle checkout procedures and philosophy to near-future transport aircraft. Specific areas √≤f application include incipient failure detection, failure localization, and contingency rescheduling. Examples of recent NASA sponsored advances in the state of the art are stressed, with emphasis on defining the role of man and computer and on the technical and economic benefits to be gained by further development and/or adaptation of these techniques to airline operations. SAE Transactions 670338. Future Needs and Current Advances within the Airlines. P. A. Wood and B. L. Hechinger, United Air Lines, Inc. New systems and techniques in aircraft maintenance had to be developed to help cope with the rapid increase in workload and the changing nature of aircraft systems, parts and material. Some of those that developed were from the science of mathematics dealing with sampling and the improv- ement of performance reliability and maintenance costs. Science and industry developed new material fabrication and machining techniques that are enabling the airlines to work with materials that did not exist ten years ago. This paper deals with maintenance concepts developed since they acquired turbine aircraft. It mentions only a few of the new shop techniques that meet demands of reliability, costs and new types of materials. It lists a few of the needs of the business in the near future that will enable the airlines to continue moving toward greater dependability and better control of costs. SAE Transactions 670339. New Advances in Non-Destructive Testing Techniques. H. G. Bogart, Magnaflux Corp. New developments in nondestructive testing for turbojet engines and aircraft are illustrated and current problem areas are outlined. Development work now underway in this field is described. Future requirements, related to such aircraft as the 747 and SST and their engines are anticipated. 670341. Disciplines of Organization. William T. Seawell, American Airlines, Inc. Discipline in an airlines organization is essential to the providing of safe, economical air transportation. Such discipline is reflected in leadership, sound organization, firm company policies, professional ability and standards, and a logical and efficient working group. American Airlines is implementing three basic programs in the flight performance area in an effort to reduce risks: centralized flight training, line flying checks in the hands of Flight Standards superintendents, and routine surveillance of operations by use of flight performance recorders and accompanying computer programs. 670342. Psychological Variable in Airline Safety. Jerome I. Berlin, United Air Lines, Inc. Psychology plays a large role in airline safety, one that has been relatively neglected to date. The author cites examples to support several conclusions: that personal and psychological variables are primary factors in safety; that management and organizational policies can deeply affect these personal and psychological variable≈õ: and the airlines must start taking these factors into consideration in their organizational and operating setup. SAE Transactions 670343. Basic Discipline of Airline Operation. Marvin Whitlock, United Air Lines, Inc. The airlines project a substantial growth period ahead. Many new facilities will be needed and provided. In the meantime, the primary mission of the Operating Departments is to use the facilities and hardware that is already available to its maximum advantage and do this consistently. This requires the people involved, regardless of their task, to follow the fundamental discipline of paying attention to what they're doing. 670344. Design Criteria and Configuration for Long-Life Aircraft Gas Turbines. J. S. Alford, General Elee. Co., Flight Propulsion Div. This paper presents an analysis of major life-limiting problems in military and commercial service experience. Design action and means to verify the solution have included engine and laboratory tests. As a result, the experience gained has led to the development of design criteria, most of which have a basis in analysis of flow models, rotor dynamics, wave mechanics, heat transfer, or stress fields. These criteria correlate the design parameters of the unsatisfactory initial design, as well as successful solutions to the problem. Design criteria, when adequately substantiated, become effective means of using past lessons and experience to help protect new designs from life-limiting problems which might be related to the following: coking of vent tubes, seals, and sump walls; materials joining; low-cycle fatigue, including thermal cyclic stresses; fretting and wear; bearing retention; blading; installation effects; and flexural vibration and fatigue of the thin walls of flow passages. SAE Transactions 670345. Development of a High Temperature, Long-Life Turbine. Warren W. Jones, Allison Div., GMC The logical progression for the gas turbine engine in aircraft and other related industries is to extend its usefulness by providing longer service life. Careful attention during the design and development phase is necessary to obtain this goal in actual production engines. A full knowledge of the operational environment to which the engine will be subjected is of primary</page><page sequence="46">670347-670354 importance in defining design and test requirements. This paper presents some of the design considerations and tests conducted in development of a high temperature long life turbine. The specific program involves the application of air cooling in the initial stage of blades and vanes to reduce metal temperatures. 670347. New Concept for Critical Speed Control. M. Kulina, J. Mullen, M. Natesh and H. Saltzman, Curtiss-Wright Corp. A device for the control of critical speeds, consisting basically of a squeeze film oil damper between two nonrotating parts in parallel with a flexible bearing support, is described. A mathematical model of the vibratory system is developed showing the existence of two different critical speeds as a function of damping. From the model, response of the system is predicted. A critical speed test rig was designed and fabricated and a test program was conducted. Results of the experimental investigation confirm the applicability of the model and the use of the device as a critical speed control. Further testing is reported on the effect of various design parameters on damping, and a simple method of varying the damping on the test stand during engine operation is shown. The results of the investigation were applied to the design of a similar device for a multistage compressor which was successfully operated with low amplitude throughout the speed range. Disassembly following 150 hr of compressor testing showed all parts to be in excellent condition. 670348. Progress on All Weather Operations. Walter Gerstenberger, United Aircraft Corp., Sikorsky Aircraft Div. Various facets of all weather operations for V/STOL type aircraft, including the enviromental requirements are discussed. Progress on the military developments of the Marine Corps, Air Force, and Army are reported. Development of components for the IHAS program and various environmental test programs are described. 670349. Failure Safety in V/STOL Operations. James Hayes, Paul H. Kesling and Norman E. Nelson, Lockheed California Co. The joint philosophies of "safe life," "fail-safe," and "failure safety," are considered in the design of new rotary wing aircraft with particular regard to airline type operation. The methods of developing these char- aacteristics in the aircraft are discussed - including state-of-the-art and advanced concepts. The subjects include structural considerations of rotors, power transmission, airframe and landing gear; stability and control considerations; instruments and avionics; controls; and electrical and hydraulic systems. Lockheed believes these characteristics can be designed into rotary wing aircraft and thus provide flight safety that exceeds the excellent records of such operators as Los Angeles Airways, New York Airways, and San Francisco and Oakland Helicopter airlines. 670352. Turbofan/Turboshaft Powerplant for Composite Helicopters. W. O. Gaffin and S. E. Wilcox, United Aircraft Corp., Pratt and Whitney Aircraft Div. A concept for obtaining substantial amounts of shaft power from conventional two-spool turbofan engines will be introduced. The concept shows promise of alternatively providing rotor drive power and cruise thrust from the same engine for composite (stowed rotor) helicopter applications. The effects of varying several engine design features, including bypass ratio, compressor split, and variable geometry, on the amount of power available will be explored. Data on a specific engine will be used to investigate the installation, performance, and control characteristics of the engine in relation to the requirements of a typical composite helicopter. 670353. ADAM II Propulsion System and Internal Aerodynamics. C. Todd Havey, LTV Aerospace Corp. The ADAM II (Air Deflection and Modulation) propulsion system is discussed as it is applied to LTV propulsive wing airplane configurations, which house all or part of their propulsion system within the wing surface. The original ADAM I configuration and its subsequent development to the present ADAM II is mentioned, together with the characteristics currently used for each of its components, such as fan turbine set, gas generator, hot gas ducting, wing mounted turbofans, and mechanical cross-shafting. The ADAM II concept is applicable to a full spectrum of subsonic aircraft and the propulsion system uses present day state-of-the-art technology, which makes the feasibility of its development quite real. 670354. Mixed Missions - Potential Improvements in Thermal Management of Hypersonic Designs. C. J. MacMiller, North Amer. Aviation, Inc., Los Angeles Div. The potential advantages of hypersonic vehicles compatible with missions combining more than one cruise flight regime are developed. Gas dynamic heating is discussed as one of the most challenging areas in the development of their propulsion systems, and the role of thermal management on the design of hypersonic vehicles is emphasized. Mixed missions result in vehicles with higher structural efficiencsy and lower fuel equivalence ratios, and these benefits are presented in terms of their effect on range. Further, mixed missions are shown to complement current research and development of high-temperature materials. SA E Transactions 109</page><page sequence="47">670355-670362 670355. Economies of Airline Scheduling as Frustrated by the Total System Environment. R√ºssel K. Rourke, Trans World Airlines, Inc. The problem of the limited real and air space available to facilitate further growth in the airline industry is discussed with the hope solutions will be formulated that are economically viable for both the airline industry and the communities it serves. SA E Transactions 670356. Airport Economics-Its Application to the New Airports for the 1970's. D. C. Meeham, United Air Lines, Inc. By 1980 the revenue passenger miles for the airline industry will be 3 1/2 times 1966's performance, while the cargo volume will be two times 1966's level. It is an established fact that though the growth of air trans- portation will continue, the present day airports in our national system are not adequate to handle these needs. The basic economic factors to be considered in the development of new major airports are social implications, costs, profits, and land values. Also to be considered are airport values to the community, both directly such as jobs for local residents, and indirectly such as stimulating tourism, motel, taxi, and other general business activity. In conclusion it is felt that future airport construction should take the deficit-financing approach represented by O'Hare Field, which appears to have answered the economic factors involved with a minimum of duplication of administrational organizations and lines of authority. 670357. Operating Economics in Short Haul Air Transports. W. B. Caldwell, Jr., Mohawk Airlines, Inc. Mohawk's conversion to turbine-powered equipment resulted in numerous advantages: ability to supply comfort to the passenger comparable to that of jet transport, reduction in amount and complexity of ground support equipment, increased reliability of engines, and lower direct operating costs. An increasing problem of all airlines which affects the short haul carriers particularly hard is that of heavy air traffic. The author believes the private air traffic will have to be rerouted to separate but equal facilities to solve the problem. 670358. One Airline's Hits and Misses in Propulsion Systems Diagnostics. J. N. Smith, Air Canada Propulsion systems diagnostics, neglected through the early years of turbine propulsion development, is now emerging as a new weapon with which airlines can protect themselves against advanced in-service failures and their attendant safety and economic impacts. Air Canada's experience in the development and application of various diagnostic methods is reviewed and reveals a still pressing need for: improved aircraft and powerplant basic diagnostic design and accessibility; a better and wider field of engineered detection devices, both airborne and ground support; personnel training and specialization. 670359. USAF Application of Airborne Recorders for Propulsion Diagnostics. Robert J. Carlson, Air Force Systems Engrg. Group The United States Air Force is evaluating the application of an airborne analyzer and digital recording system to assess, diagnose, and predict turbojet engine health on an immediate and long-term basis. This paper presents a brief discussion of the C- 14 1 "Lead-the-Force" System, the C-5A Malfunction Detection, Analysis, and Recording Subsystem, and discusses in detail the Engine Analyzer System (EASY). The EASY discussion includes the design philosophy, hardware, test programs, computer programs, and test results. 670360. Automatic Performance Monitoring. Peter F. Bellam, Garrett Corp. Automatic performance recording and monitoring is capable of improving flight safety, increasing aircraft availability and utilization, and decreasing maintenance and operational costs. Methods of selecting, collecting, and processing the necessary data are described. Applicability is focused on the aircraft turbojet engine, although the system is adaptable to other airborne and ground-based systems, mechanical, electronic, or hybrid. The condition of the engine is divided into: "mechanical" and "gas generator" (for perfomance). The "mechanical" condition is reflected in physical parameters, such as fuel and oil pressures and temperatures, and vibration, which are usually go-no-go in their operating limits and reflect definite malfunctions of components. The "gas generator" refers to those portions of the engine devoted to the generation of energy (compressor, diffuser, burner, turbine, and exhaust) and the associated parameters are those reflecting changes in the efficiencies of components within these sections. 670361. Endoscope - A New Tool for Internal Inspection. A. W. Young, Engis Equip. Co., Instrumentation Div. The Universal Endoscope System makes use of the transmission capabilities of a solid, totally internal reflecting quartz rod and precision microscope. The light output is approximately 200 watts. This bright source is aircooled throughout and permits internal viewing of bores, cavities, walls, and assemblies. Standard probes as small as 7/16 in. are available. 670362. Applications of an X-Ray Sensiticve Television System for Nondestructive Testing. Jay P. Mitchell and Robert C. McMaster, Ohio State Univ., Welding Engrg. Dept. A television X-ray image enlargement system capable of directly detecting images developed by penetrating 110</page><page sequence="48">670363-670368 radiations is serving as an inspection tool for non- destructive testing. This system provides instantaneous X-ray images having 30X enlargement on a television screen. A special television camera tube detects the X-ray image and transforms the X-radiations to a video signal at a 1/30 sec frame rate when using standard television imaging operation. Oriiiginal development of the television X-ray imaging system was for inspection of weldments and material reliability in aerospace vehicles. The contrast sensitivity of this system has shown 2 percent thickness change in 1/4 in. steel and 1 in. aluminum thicknesses. Its resolution capability has repeatedly revealed 500 mu in. detail; however, with careful attention to operational techniques, 300 mu in. detail can be visualized. Specimen motion speeds up to approximately 18 in. /minute can be used without objectionable image blurring. The system's capability to respond to dynamic conditions, coupled with remote manipulation of devices, under inspection, provides instrumentation which can reveal many hidden defects in materials and structures. 670363. Designing Diagnostics into Propulsion Systems. J. C. Pirtle, General Elee. Co. A diagnostic system is required for the supersonic transport engine and will be part of the normal engine development program. Methods must be devised to sense either performance deterioration or related mechanical malfunctions. Eight examples of diagnostic devices, essentially in the development stages, are discussed in relation to their potential for monitoring or measuring the health of the engine. 670364. Thickened Fuels for Aircraft Safety. A. Beerbower, J. Nixon, W. Philippoff and T. J. Wallace, Esso Res. and Engrg. Co. The current incentive for safety fuels is due to excessive loss of aircraft in Vietnam due to fires. Evaluation of four classes of thickened fuels eliminates "canned-heat" gels, the visco-elastic Napalm type, and the polymer-thickened fluids. Emulsions-thickened fuels seem more compatible with aircraft systems. Points of superiority include ease of removal from tanks, good atomizing properties in engines, and constancy of rheological properties over a wide temperature range. Recently, work on an Army-sponsored contract to develop emulsion safety fuels for Army helicopters and cargo planes has uncovered a number of formulations containing at least 97 percent fuel. Based on early laboratory data, these emulsions appear to have good stability at -30 to 130 F. The separation of JP-4 varies from 1-10 percent after several cycles of heating and cooling between these limits. One nonaqueous emulsion, WS-X-7063, has provided valuable background information. The yield stress of the emulsion can be varied 1000-3500 dynes/cm 2 by varying the ratio of continuous phase to emulsifier. Its performance characteristics in various engine fuel systems are under investigation. We hope the information produced qill enable us to develop a fuel acceptable for use in selected military applications. SAE Transactions 670365. Emulsified Jet Engine Fuel. Jay C. Harris and E. A. Steinmetz, Monsanto Res. Corp. The objective of preparing emulsified jet fuel is to reduce the possibility of in-flight or post-crash fires. Two high internal phase JP-4 fuel emulsions containing 3 percent external emulsifying phase were developed which have reduced flammability and are engine consumable with low residual ash. One of the emulsions is designed to permit JP-4 recovery for use in other vehicles. External phase characteristics are described which provide lowered JP-4 volatility and flammability, and which give emulsions stable at -20 to 135 F, are completely resistant to 500 g accelerations, and are corrosion resistant. The effectiveness of various types of emulsifiers and their peculiar requirement for these emulsions are discussed. Preparation, storage, pumpability, and other emulsion characteristics are described. SAE Transactions 670366. Initial Experience with Emulsified Fuels at Avco-Lycoming. George Opdyke, Jr., Lycoming Div., Avco Corp. This paper discusses the major effects observed in feasibility testing of three emulsified fuels in several gas turbine combustors, fuel controls, and fuel system component parts, and in three Avco Lycoming gas turbine engine models. Engine operation was essentially unaffected at power levels normally used for low altitude flight, but combustion was inhibited at starting and at altitude conditions. The fuel controls performed reasonably well, but showed that modifications will be required for reliable long term operation. 670367. Environmental Testing of a Gas Turbine Engine with Emulsified JP-4 Fuel. John Monarch, Continental Aviation and Engrg. Corp. The results of tests conducted to determine the effect of the direct burning of an emulsified JP-4 fuel in a gas turbine engine under various environmental conditions are discussed. Engine operation, including starting and transient operation, with emulsified fuel was essentially the same as that with liquid JP-4 during all phases of the testing. Engine testing was terminated when a "hot section" corrosion problem, generated by one of the additives in the emulsified fuel, was encountered. 670368. Preliminary Evaluation of an Emulsified Fuel Mixture in a Model T63 Turbine Engine. James R. Lucas, Allison Div., GMC The development of aircraft engine fuels with improved safety characteristics is of considerable importance to both military and commercial users. Preliminary ill</page><page sequence="49">670369-670378 evaluation of such a fuel has recently been completed by the Allison Div., of General Motors Corp. under contract with the U. S. Army. This evaluation compared an emulsified mixture of JP-4 fuel in water with standard JP-4 jet engine fuel in the Model T63 gas turbine engine. The results of this testing on both bench test and full scale engine test demonstrated the feasibility of such a safety fuel in this or an engine of similar type. In fact, the fuel appears to have a very good potential for military application. SAE Transactions 670369. Operation of the GE T64 on Emulsified Fuel. William J. Crawford, III, General Elee. Co., Flight Propulsion Div. Based upon initial testing, it was concluded that the T64 engine could operate on emulsified fuel (JD1) without any engine or control adjustment or modifications. This was accomplished without loss of performance or deterioration of engine components. However, the limited program indicated that water additives had severe effects on fuel system components which meet normal Military Specification corrosion resistance requirements. Extensive follow-on testing for fuels and long term engine endurance operation are required to evaluate these fuels fully from an engine life standpoint. This paper summarizes engine operation, and describes components following limited operation on a water emulsification of JP-4. 670370. Fuselage Configuration Studies. J. Morris and D. M. Ashford, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. Because of the rapid growth of air travel, both cargo and passenger, the payload capacity required for future transport aircraft is too great to be accommodated by fuselages of conventional configuration (that is, single- deck, single-aisle, up to six seats abreast). Fuselage design philosophy was therefore re-evaluated in a recent Douglas study, reviewed in this paper. Factors affecting fuselage design are outlined and trends are discussed. It is concluded that the forthcoming wide, single-deck fuselage, seating up to 10 abreast, will have a potential capacity of about 550 passengers. For larger capacities, the greater efficiency of multideck fuselages over that of the single-deck becomes increasingly apparent on a per-passenger basis. The use of multideck fuselages, however, will raise new problems - particularly those of airport terminal design and passenger evacuation - but these should not prove insurmountable. SAE Transactions 670371. Determining SST Size. John M. Swihart, Boeing Co. A method of determining the size of a supersonic transport that will be competitive in a future air traffic market is discussed. Traffic volume forecasts, year of introduction, type of aircraft, and flight frequency are used to select a basic configuration and size. Then engine-airframe matching analyses, landing and takeoff restraints, and the designer's judgment are balanced against direct operating costs to determine the final size. 670373. Proposed New Approaches to the Maintenance of the Boeing Supersonic Transport. Robert M. Barr, Boeing Co. The overall maintenance requirement for the Boeing supersonic transport is no different from that of any other airplane: to provide maximum airplane availabilty at minimum cost without compromise to safety. However, allowing for size, speed, and sophistication exceeding that of current airplanes, it must be apparent tha traditional maintenance methods alone will not suffice with the SST. New approaches have to be developed if new standards of productivity are to be realized. The approaches described here are a start. Successful completion - and hence successful operation - will depend on the continuing efforts of manufacturer, suppliers, airlines and FAA. 670374. (P-16) European Point of View on Recoverable and Reusable Spaceflight Systems (Aerospace Transporter). Alois Cejka, Eurospace Eurospace's aim is to advance a comprehensive European space program. Open cooperation in space technology between the United States and the European organization has also been sought, to the extent that U.S. companies were invited to become members of Eurospace. Among the several projects proposed by Eurospace is an aerospace transporter. At the first joint U.S.-European Conference, it was precisely the aerospace transporter proposal which elicited the least favorable response from the American side. Why this project would be unsuitable for the European organization to undertake at present is questioned openly. 670376. (P-16) Economics of Military Space Launching Systems. David V. Miller, Air Force Space Systems Div. A brief review of our present national launch vehicle inventory is presented here, and the economic character- istics of these systems are discussed briefly. Continual emphasis should be placed upon the means of finding more economical launch vehicles, and potential concepts are discussed which may offer economic benefits to future military space operations. Military requirements for future systems are discussed in a general manner in stressing the need for a valid reliability-cost tradeoff. Finally, any system is dependent upon sound technical management, and continued progress in this area is also essential. Continued Air Force selective studies are required in order to establish the planning data upon which future system selection can be made. 670378. (P-16) Near Term Reusable Rocket Launch Vehicle Concepts. G. Karel, General Dynamics Corp., Convair Div. 112</page><page sequence="50">670380-670384 In recent years substantial resources have been expended by USAF and NASA to develop a broad technology base applicable to launch vehicles. A spectrum of reusable first stage launch vehicles using this technology base has been explored and the economic, operational and performance characteristics compared. The systems investigated are all vertically launched, 2-stage-to-orbit rocket powered vehicles having fully recoverable first stages with glide hypersonic entry and airplane type subsonic flyback. The second stages are existing expendables, all engines are from the existing inventory and current structural- materials-fabrication-techniques are used. A specific vehicle is selected, defined, and shown to have economic merit. A major result of the study was to show that current technology could be applied to a reusable rocket launching system with significant economic benefits. 670380. (P-16) Low-Cost Boosters. John E. Martin, John A. Mayhall and Richard Hardy, Boeing Co., Launch Systems Branch Recent work performed by Boeing to evaluate various low-cost methods of providing rocket-launch vehicles of payload capability between the uprated Saturn I (40,000 lb to low earth orbit) and Saturn V (262,000 lb to low earth orbit) is summarized. A NASA space program has been postulated indicating that 33-69 vehicles may be required during the 1970's in the payload range described. In increasing development complexity, the vehicles evaluated include (1) existing developed equipment like the S-IC and S-IVB stages of Saturn V, (2) a new 260-in. diameter solid booster vehicle and (3) new pressure fed storable propellant booster vehicles. Comparisons are made evaluating the effort and cost required to implement the various systems and their individual operational costs. The low cost system selection changes with mission requirements and is further contingent on a booster stage recovery and reuse decision. 670381. (P-16) Advanced Space Vehicle Planning: An Analysis of the First Decade. Carl H. Builder, United Aircraft Corp. Advanced space vehicle planning is analyzed from the economic approach to decision making. Optimum cost of program is found to drop with time despite rising launch traffic. Mathematical models are constructed with parameters based on earlier launch vehicle data. Effects of ix discounting on optimum investment are presented. 670382. (P-16) Enigma of Booster Recovery - Ballistic or Winged?. Phil Bono, Frank E. Senator and D. Garcia, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. The relative merits of ballistic versus lifting-body and winged recovery techniques for space launch vehicles in the small-payload category is discussed. Costs and operational capabilities of vertical-takeoff vertical-landing (VTOVL) vehicles are compared with two variations of all-rocket, vertical-take-off horizontal-landing (VTOHL) vehicles: (1) winged first stage, lifting-body second stage and (2) winged first and second stages. In addition, three baseline configurations are discussed and compared. Problems associated with maximum vehicle versatility are identified and solutions are suggested. Operational and economic factors are discussed, conclusions are drawn, and suggestions are made for further study of the most promising approaches to reusable launch vehicle design. SA E Transactions 670383. (P-16) Design Considerations for Orbital Transport Systems. Dietrich W. Fellenz and Charles M. Akridge, Marshall Space Flight Center, NASA Applications of earth orbital platforms like commu- nications satellites have already achieved a commercial value in their own right. Starting from our present-day hardware, the key question is, should we simplify or sophisticate our vehicle concepts? Two problem areas are: 1. Implications of operational "requirements" on systems design, performance and cost, including mission parameters, considerations of man's safety and comfort, overflight of populated areas, sonic boom, abort and flyback capability, and vehicle turn-around. 2. Implementation of the systems development: Do we propose a quantum jump requiring a large, concentrated development expenditure, or is there an alternative in a more modestly paced evolutionary approach in which annual funding and development risk are limited? Various development approaches and their systems sensitivities were put into context with a mission model and evaluated for utility, cost and development risk. The first new development seen is that of a reusable passenger vehicle designed for orbital use to replace the Apollo command and service modules. Next, or concurrent, are improvements in economy and operations of the mission launch vehicle. Partially reusable transportation systems appear most promising on the basis of the model used. Relatively small additional savings, associated with high uncertainties, may be expected from a fully reusable system. A choice will have to be made on the basis of economical growth potential and operational considerations. SAE Transactions 670384. (P-16) Comparison of Fixed Wing Reusable Booster Concepts. Richard A. Nau, General Dynamics Corp., Convair Div. Eight fixed-wing reusable horizontal landing booster point design concepts are presented and compared on the basis of weight, cost, technical difficulty, and availability date. The eight vehicle types considered are all basically two-stage systems with a lifting body reusable second stage, with all vehicles normalized to place 40,000 lb 113</page><page sequence="51">670385-670391 payload in orbit. All flight vehicles are fully reoverable and capable of flying back and landing at the launch site. Vehicle types discussed are vertical take-off horizontal landing rockets, sled launched horizontal take-off rockets, runway launched horizontal take-off rockets, air breathing first stages, combined air breathing and rocket first stages, oxidizer collection concepts, supersonic combustion ramjets, and in-flight refueling vehicles. Each of these vehicle types is depicted in the paper and its design and performance characteristics are discussed. System non-recurring costs tend to be proportional to the inert weight of the vehicle, and therefore the rocket propelled vehicles have lower investment costs than the airbreathing types. The turnaround or recurring costs are relatively independent of the launch vehicle types with the exception of the in-flight refueling system, which is about double those of the other systems because of the large weight of flight hardware to be maintained. The airbreathing first stage boosters, however, may offer more mission flexibility than the rocket first stages because of their capability to fly for longer periods within the earth's atmosphere. 670385. (P-16) Review of European Aerospace Transporter Studies. H. Tolle, Entwicklungsring Nord - ERNO Three points are discussed. Firstly, what has been the starting point of European work on the Aerospace Transporter and what is the development of cooperation on this subject in European industry. Secondly, how were the studies tackled in the beginning and what is the main trend for future work now. Thirdly, who has worked in Europe on the Aerospace Transporter mainly and on what concept. 670386. (P-16) Italian Approach to Reusable Low-Cost Rockets. Glauco Partei, P. Laurienzo and F. Diamantini, Societa Transporti Missilistici Hot water or steam rocket development and production cost is estimated to be about 95 percent less than the cost of developing chemical propellant rockets. Hot water rockets can be reused a great many times, making them even more economical. Operating temperatures are low and no insulation is needed for engine walls. Albeit their modest specific impulse, which is in the order of 40-50 sec, hot water rockets have many practical uses, particularly as booster rockets for large payloads. A dimensionless method is described by which hot water rockets of any size can be designed in a few hours. 670387. (P-16) West German Approach to Reusable Launch Vehicles. Jurgen Lambrecht and Edwin Schafer, Junkers Flugzeug - Und Motorenwerke GmbH Complete feasibility studies of seven reusable launch systems being carried out by Germany since 1962 are described. Work has reached the early experimental phase (as in the United States). The author explains why, at this stage, cooperation between Europe and the U.S. would present substantial economic advantages for both parties. He also suggests how this cooperation could be approached. 670388. (P-16) French Concept for an Aerospace Transporter. Henri Deplante, Avions Marcel Dassault; and Pierre Perrier, Etudes Avanc√©es Assuming the delivery with an excess velocity reserve 3.300 fps of a 1-ton transferable load to a space laboratory orbiting at 200 statute miles, the feasibility of a 2 (or 3) stages "horizontal take-off transporter" is considered. Analysis includes the concept of two recoverable vehicles and discusses the configuration, separation, return and propulsion. Design assumes that conventional airports can be used without special facilities, except LOX and LH. 670389. (P-16) British Reusable Booster Concept. T. W. Smith, British Aircraft Corp. /Operating/ Ltd. With reusability accepted as a means of reducing operating costs, the size of the initial investment (research and development) is likely to determine the choice for the next generation boosters. High volume utilization lifting bodies propelled by LH/LOX rockets in a vertical take-off mode are shown to be superior to several other concepts. This is largely due to the low manufactured weight without undue complexity or use of exotic materials, leading to low research and development and low unit cost. Even lower costs can be shown for a modular concept (MUSTARD) in which basically identical lifting bodies units are utilized as both boosters and spacecraft. The concept is shown to be feasible, and progress on some aspects of the associated structural analysis is described. 670390. (P-16) Air-Breathing Reusable Launchers. R. H.

Performance is examined of a reusable space launcher system suitable for European development with an air-breathing first stage and rocket-propelled second stage. The merits of ram-rocket and turbo-ramjet propulsion are compared and the research program required for such a system is discussed. It is concluded that a partly air-breathing reusable launcher system is likely to emerge as a byproduct of air transport development. 670391. (P-16) Space Rotor - French Concept for a Reusable Recovery System. Marcel Kretz, Giravions Dorand The space rotor corresponds to a device designed to satisfy the general requirement for a light, maneuverable, fully reusable reentry system, having a high capability to spot-land, softly, a variety of space vehicles in unprepared areas. Recent feasibility studies have shown that the space 114</page><page sequence="52">670392-670396 rotor exhibits a number of remarkable features - its light weight characteristics, when compared with maneuverable or ballistic reentry means, being the most striking ones. In general the combined system, space-rotor-vehicle, can be regarded as a hypersonic glider having an L/D ratio of the order of 1.0 to 1.5. However, whatever the applications envisioned, booster recoveries, orbital recoveries of manned or unmanned vehicles - the weight penalty incurred by this new system is fairly constant and situated well below that of the equivalent, more conventional means or reentry and recovery. The space rotor represents a fully reusable metallic structure built from nickel superalloys to withstand temperatures of 1650-1800 F. During reentry the heat problems of the space rotor are considerably reduced thanks to the migrating stagnation point effect which eliminates the usual "hot spots" present on fixed geometry vehicles and levels down the temperature distribution to the mean radiation temperature. The paper ends with an analysis of the technological and economical advantages of the space rotor and their comparison with other reentry and recovery means. A project of an aerospace transporter is presented as another example of the potential capabilities of the rotary wing techniques for low cost orbital transportation. 670392. (P-16) Space Operations and Economics. M. W. Jack Bell, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. Future potential developments in space transportation systems are reviewed. Consideration is given to spacecraft systems, launch and recovery facilities, and economic justification of future alternatives. Requirements for high system utilization rates must be evolved before a fully recoverable, reusable space transportation system can be economically justified. The recovery and refurbishment of current-type systems is suggested as an intermediate alternative which, by reducing cost per mission and increasing space system utilization, will ultimately lead to a valid requirement for advanced reusable systems. 670393. (P-16) Accuracy of Launch Vehicle Cost Analysis. M. C. Heuston, J. G. Fish and E. C. Bradley, Aerospace Corp. A summary of an initial phase of a long term study to develop techniques for accurately predicting launch vehicle costs is presented. It is directed to the cost estimating problem involved in conceptual phase planning of future orbital transportation systems. It is an initial part of a larger research project to develop a computer program cost model for long range planning. Several aspects of launch vehicle cost models are described. A brief survey of the current state of the art in launch vehicle cost estimating techniques is included, plus a brief description of the Aerospace Corp. launch vehicle cost model currently under development. The emphasis of this paper is on the accuracy or confidence associated with cost estimates calculated by industry launch vehicle cost models. Results are shown of a statistical analysis of the mean and standard deviation of sample model estimates for various cost elements of a liquid and solid launch vehicle program. This sample was obtained with the assistance of several industrial contractors. The variations in the cost estimates are discussed. SA E Transactions 670394. (P-16) Operational Experience of the X-15 Airplane as a Reusable Vehicle System. James E. Love and William R. Young, NASA, Flight Res. Center The flight environment of the X-15 research aircraft is similar to that of a first-stage rocket booster. The data obtained s X during the flight program is, therefore, of interest for reusable space vehicles. Detailed information is presented concerning development, operation, and the economic aspects of the vehicle and facilities, including manpower effort, and calendar time required for refurbishment and turnaround. The effect on operations of component improvements dictated by failure experience is examined. These data have been derived from more than 7 years of X-15 operations. 670395. (P-16) Launching Saturn Vehicles. J. G. Shinkle, Kennedy Space Flight Center, NASA The preparation of necessary facilities, the checkout and the launch of an Apollo/Saturn V vehicle is probably one of the most complicated and intricate single operation of our times. It is an orderly outgrowth of the firing many years ago of the first rocket propelled vehicle. But the advances being made in computer technology, commu- nications, and even mechanical design must be added to show what is required in a launching of the Saturn V. New concepts have been devised such as the mobile concept, computer technologies, and advanced commu- nications which enable a high degree of automation and remote control of the operation. Certain management techniques have been used such as an activation board and a series of facilities tests. The use of contractors has been emphasized but the integration of contractor effort has been retained by the government. The government has, for the many dollars spent and effort of many people expended, obtained a series of facilities most versatile in capabilities, a knowledge of how to perform many highly technical and intricate tasks and a team of people, both civil service and contractor, capable of performing a very complicated, arduous, and mutually interdependent task. 670396. (P-16) Critical Aspects of Implementing Reusable Booster Concepts. H. F. Keyser and C. W. Spieth, Martin-Marietta Corp. Three critical aspects of implementing reusable booster concepts are discussed. These aspects center on 115</page><page sequence="53">670397-670402 requirements for economic justification, establishing the credibility of recurring cost characteristics, and means of minimizing development costs such that these nonrecurring costs are matched with the size of market which must amortize them. The impact of these factors on implementing a reusable booster development program is discussed. Approaches and possible programs are suggested that could make significant progress toward establishing our technological preparedness for reusable booster program implementation. 670397. (P- 16) Economic and Technical Analysis of a Partially Reusable Space Vehicle System. S. L. Hislop, G. M. Fuller and K. J. Ugoretz, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc., Advance Spacecraft The operating costs of current space systems are examined briefly to determine the distribution of these costs through the major operational elements of the systems. For flight frequencies of between 5-20 flights per year, the system costs associated with recovery and reuse are examined to show where major savings are potentially achievable. The authors then describe the results of a feasibility analysis of a vehicle concept emphasizing recovery and reuse of the spacecraft and the simplification of the expendable elements. The latter is accomplished by incorporating the boost phase steering function in the spacecraft and using solid propellant motor booster stages. A first order cost comparison with other current and projected concepts is then presented to indicate the separate effect on operating costs of launch vehicle propulsion type, spacecraft type, and steering techniques. The authors conclude with an enumeration of study results which indicate that the partially reusable head-end steering concept is technically feasible and cost effective. 670398. (P-16) Lifting Center-Body Land Recoverable Booster Concept. Hans F. Wuenscher, Marshall Space Flight Center, NASA A new concept for land recovery of launch vehicle stages is described. After burn out and separation of a conventional cylindrical booster configuration, the outer tank portions are discarded, leaving a lifting shaped center-body capable of re-entry, pull out, fly back and landing. The essential features are the application of intersecting pressure vessel theory for shaping the tanks and the simple arrangement of hinged tail panels (dive brakes). The panels are used for stabilization and deceleration during the re-entry phase and fold back in sequence during the pull out maneuver and transition into an aerodynamic lifting body configuration of low wing loading. In conclusion, the concept promises the following advantages: 1.No essential weight increase* versus expendable stages. 2. Maximum use of existing and proven stage hardware and launch facilities. 3. Conversion of rocket stage into a well-defined controllable aircraft for land recovery, without deployment shock and residual disposal problem. 670399. (P-16) Titan IIIB Recovery Experiment. John Dunn, Martin-Marietta Corp., Denver Div. The Titan IIIB recovery experiment is designed to recover the spent Stage I of a Titan IIIB to evaluate the feasibility of refurbishment and reuse. The stage, slowed after reentry by parachute deployment, can be allowed to impact in the water or retrieved via helicopter in midair. In either case, the stage will be returned to land, refurbished, and reused. Cost data will determine the economic feasibility of the program. A preliminary design of the recovery system has been made, the economic factors evaluated, subsystem contractors contacted, and an experiment program defined. 670400. (P-16) Review of Current Trends in Technology for Reusable Launch Vehicles. Alan Watton, Air Force Dept., Res. and Technology Div. A review of current trends in the technology for reusable launch vehicles is an appropriate method of highlighting the pacing technologies to provide a suitable introduction to discussions in specific technical areas. Improvements in both operational capabilities and in economic characteristics can be expected from the advances in the relevant technologies. The attainment of such improvements involves two dilemmas of technical innovation. One is that the greater the desired capabilities, the more significant the technical challenge. The second is that the more complex technical approaches involve significant program investments that are justified only in terms of high levels of utilization. The paper establishes the technical areas of most fundamental importance and provides a resume of each area in terms of its potential contribution to the attainment of low-cost orbital transportation. 670482. (P-16) Survey of Advanced Structural Technologies Applicable to Future Large Launch Vehicles. Edward W. Gomersall and Kenji Nishioka, NASA, Office of Advanced Res. and Tech- nology; and Raymond W. Buey, Jr., General Elee. Co., Missile and Space Div. With the objective of minimizing structural weight in future large launch vehicles, several applicable advanced structural analysis techniques, materials, and unique approaches to structural design are assessed. Advanced structural design analysis techniques such as pressure coupling effects and higher allowable stresses by use of various biaxial stress field failure theories are considered. Materials include filamentary composites, beryllium, titanium, and aluminum. Various types of wall con- struction are considered. Unique design approaches include front-end steering, strap-ons, and advanced nozzles. Effects of varying selected design criteria from values in use today are also shown. Each new technology or approach is individually applied to a representative 116</page><page sequence="54">670403-670452 vehicle. Structural weights with and without the new technology or approach are compared. Interdependence effects are also investigated. The results may be used to assess the relative potential of each new technology as applied to possible future large launch vehicles. SAE Transactions 670403. (P-16) Spacecraft Landing Systems. Leland C. Norman and John W. Kiker, NASA, Manned Spacecraft Center An evolutionary survey of spacecraft landing systems with mission requirements and landing system performance as the evolutionary yardstick is presented. First, the requirements associated with low lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) spacecraft are briefly reviewed, then the reasons for and descriptions of the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo systems are presented. Several types of high performance concepts were evaluated for possible application to follow-on generation spacecraft, and the avenue selected for development embodied a gliding, controllable descent system coupled with a means of attenuating impact. A pioneer system developed by the Manned Spcecraft Center in consonance with Gemini requirements amply demonstrated the effectiveness of this type of landing system. With this baseline established, new designs and concepts in the field of gliding descent devices are discussed which indicate the growth in landing system performance represented by these devices. The conclusions contain a prognosis of what the next decade may hold for spacecraft landing systems and indicate areas wherein continued improvement is highly desirable. SAE Transactions 670404. (P-16) Control Systems for Reusable Launch Vehicles. James C. Blair and Jerome R. Redus, Marshall Space Flight Center, NASA Flight control requirements of reusable launch vehicles are reviewed and compared to those of aircraft, current launch vehicles, and spacecraft. Areas are identified in which more work on the flight control system will improve mission performance. Current work in three areas is briefly reviewed - the use of man in the control loop, the development of systems which can accommodate large changes in the flight conditions, and use of the flight control system to reduce wind-induced loading. 670405. (P-16) Place of the Aerospace Transporter in European Space Programme - Recommendations. David ¬´Andrews, Rolls-Royce Ltd., Indust. and Marine Gas Turbine Div. The evolution of space activities based on the use of large ballistic vehicles appears now to have been fortuitous. The delayed start of European programs necessitates reconsideration of what will be the most profitable line of development. Until men are seen to inhabit space stations for useful purposes and to be transported there and back safely and economically popular support for these activities will be reluctantly given. A re-usable transporter, of whatever type, enlarges man's capability in space. Industrial recommendations for a European space program accept it as a necessary implement in the long term. 670448. Controlling Job Shop Operations by Computer. R. L. Whitfield, National Twist Drill and Tool Co. This paper deals with a system for the computerized monitoring of manufacturing operations and the methods employed in collecting and analyzing production information. It covers briefly the relationship of the manufacturing system to the balance of the information system. The system employs a special purpose digital computer interfaced with a general purpose computer on a real time basis and various visual and audio controls. 670449. Application of Computer Control in Computer Manufacturing. Gene A. Addesso and Paul V. D'Ambrosa, International Business Machines Corp. This paper treats the problem of efficiently and economically customizing a so-called standard products. Analysis showed the numerically controlled tools could solve the problem if they could be supplied with command data at a much higher rate than normally supplied to N/C machine tools, and if a means could be devised for obtaining feedback from the tools. After exploring several manufacturing system alternatives the solution was found in a computer controlled manufacturing system. The Solid Logic Technology (SLT) board, a basic building block in computers, is a part for which the customizing system was developed. 670452. Thermoelectric Generators for Military Portable Power. A. Bayne Neild, Naval Ship Res. and Dev. Center, Marine Engrg. Lab. The inherent advantages of quiet operation, few moving parts, and compact and lightweight construction make thermoelectric generators desirable for specialized military uses. Recent developments in the thermoelectric couple and thermopile enclosure fabrication have shown promise for successful generator sizes that can meet present military needs for portable power up to 3 kw. Design, development, and test of two 300-w portable thermoelectric generators by th√© U. S. Navy Marine Engineering Laboratory are described. The generator weighs only 35 lb, including diesel, kerosene, or jet fuel for 8 hr of operation. The cooling fan operating from power produced by the thermoelectric couples is the only moving part. The laboratory is investigating minor modifications needed for units to be used by the Marine Corps in field trails. The performance characteristics of the new 300-w thermoelectric generators and other power sources now available are compared. 117</page><page sequence="55">670453-670458 Discussion: N. C.

Fuel cells using hydrocarbons, methanol and ammonia fuels, and air as oxidant are evaluated for vehicle propulsion. Progress and problems in the direct and indirect use of these fuels in fuel cells are considered. In the indirect systems, they are first reacted to produce hydrogen-containing mixtures, which are then oxidized in the fuel cells. Comparisons are made with present experimental fuel cell-powered vehicles, which use expensive and dangerous fuels and oxidants. Fuel cells are also compared with present and proposed new high energy density battery systems for vehicle propulsion. Discussion: J. C.

Discussed are: compression- ignition and spark-ignition engine generators, hybrid engines, turbine generators, Stirling engines, rankine cycle engines, fuel cells, and batteries. The liquid hydrogen fuel cell offers the greatest potential for military applications because of the compatibility of the fuel. Also covered are the power conditioning units and drive units.

Developing an Electrically Driven Hydrogen Blower for a Vehicular Fuel Cell Powerplant. C. A. Amann and G. D. Skellenger, General Motors Res. Labs. An essential component in the fuel cell/electric powered Electrovan is its hydrogen blower, which circulates gas past the hydrogen electrode, transporting the water formed there to the condenser for removal from the system. The two stage, radial flow blower designed to meet these teeds is a compact, quiet, electrically driven unit with minimal leakage rate, and which does not contaminate the fuel cells. Major areas receiving attention in its development were the high-speed shaft seal, turbomachinery, resonant vibration in the blower housing, and noise level in the vehicle installation. The blower has completed several hundred hours of satisfactory service. 670456. Controlling Deceleration in a Crash-Impact Simulator by Metal Cutting. J. A. Bates, D. R. Dunlop, D. M. Finch and D. O. Horning, California Univ. The principle of metal cutting is used in an energy- absorption system to control the deceleration of a moving test vehicle in a crash impact simulator. By varying the depth and type of cut made, such a system can be programmed to duplicate the basic deceleration patterns typically produced in single and multiple impact collisions of motor vehicles. Initial experiments with a vertical type, dynamic test machine showed that the metal cutting method compared favorably in ease of operation, design feasibility, and operating cost with other energy-absorption methods such as hydraulic buffering and crushing of metal honeycomb material. In addition, it provides the advantage of multiple impact simulation. Preliminary evaluation tests of the fullsscale metal cutting system in the collision simulator, using aluminum plate for the material cut, showed the system capable of providing flat-topped deceleration patterns of various amplitudes with good repeatability. Other patterns, such as sinusoidal and triangular shapes, are possible with further refinement of the system. SAE Transactions 670457. Evaluation of Market Samples of Motor Vehicle Lighting and Safety Devices. C. O. Jones, California Highway Patrol; D. R. Dunlop, California Univ.; and D. M. Finch, California Univ., Transp. and Traffic Engrg Inst. A market sampling of motor vehicle lighting devices and seat belts approved for sale in California found a sizable percentage not complying with State requirements. Samples of 40 different devices, in both after-market and original equipment categories, were purchased on the open market and subjected to the same inspection and test procedures as the corresponding samples originally submitted by the manufacturers for approval. A large percentage of the purchased devices were found unacceptable. Many of the unacceptable units showed obvious physical changes made in production when compared with the original samples submitted for approval testing. In the remaining unacceptable devices, performance deficiencies were probably due to inadequate quality control in manufacture. There was no significant difference between the after-market and original equipment categories with regard to the percentage of purchased devices found unacceptable. 670458.

Five conditions of restraint were included for four sizes of occupants; the anthro- pometric dummies, their restraints, seats and crashing cars all carried appropriate transducers. Seven high g-tolerant, high-speed cameras, carried by the crashing cars provided close-up continuous monitoring of these quarter-second collision sequences, supported by many more tower and ground level special photographic units arranged adout the collision scene.

Automobile owners get more luggage space when they use this space saving tire, and forgetful air inflators need never find themselves without a spare because this one is carried flat and needs only a little pressure boost to make it wheelworthy. Moreover, the capability of operating when deflated is a bonus characteristic. This is the thin tread emergency spare tire by Goodrich. Deflated, it is only slightly larger than its rim. Expanded, it is normal size and shape. The mechanics of expansion are explained here and operational data and test results are presented. 670461. Factors Affecting Tire Traction. Walter E. DeVinney, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. Of the many variables involved in the problem of wet skidding, the most significant single factor is speed, since it is the one item which remains entirely within the control of each individual vehicle operator. On wet surfaces, the effects of speed on the apparent coefficient of friction are reduced as the surface texture becomes more coarse. Although more consistent frictional coefficients obtained by increasing surface coarseness would assist greatly in reducing skidding, the many other variables involved remain an integral part of the tire traction problem. Factors considered in this paper are: tread design and compound, tire construction, inflation pressure, road surface, tire load, and temperature. 1968 SA E Transactions 670462. Development and Economics of Using Aluminum in Automatic Transmissions. Paul L. Thornburg, Ford Motor Co., Transmission and Chassis Div.

Metallurgical Factors Related to Machining Aluminum Castings. Robert C. Lemon, Alumi- num Co. of America Three metallurgical factors have a major influence on the machinability of aluminum castings: chemical composition, heat treatment, and foreign inclusions. Other metallurgical factors that may also affect machinability are generally related to one of these three items. In general, aluminum alloys have good machining characteristics, although tests indicate that they cover a range. Characteristics relating to machinability of the important commercial aluminum alloys, including tool wear, machining rate, surface finish, burring, chip characteristics, and dimen- sional stability, are discussed.

This is a continuation of the presentation of thermo- dynamic properties of selected fuel-air mixtures in chart form, suitable for utilization in engine performance calculations. Methane and propane, representative of natural gas and LPG are the two fuels considered. Using these charts, comparisons are made between the performance to be expected with these gaseous fuels compared to octane, as representative of gasoline. Reduced engine power is predicted and this is confirmed by experience of other investigators. SAE T ransactions 670467. Effects of Mixture Motion Upon the Lean Limit and Combustion of Spark-Ignited Mixtures. Jay A. Bolt and David L. Harrington, Michigan Univ. The object of this research was to learn more about the effects of mixture motion upon ignition in spark ignited piston engines, and to determine how variations in mixture velocity alter the combustion process. To provide effective means for producing and measuring the mixture velocity, all tests were made in a constant volume bomb, using mixtures of propane and air. The effects of mixture motion on the lean spark ignition limit, rate of pressure rise, and burning time were determined for mixture ratios ranging from stoichiometric to the lean limit. The mixture pressures corresponded to those in Otto cycle engines at the time of spark occurrence. The results reveal that a mixture velocity of 5mfps, relative to the spark plug, requires an enrichment of 17 percent with respect to the stagnant lean limit. Increases in mixture velocity were found to greatly increase the rate of pressure rise during combustion. This effect was more pronounced for lean mixtures than for stoichiometric mixtures. Increasing the initial mixture pressure was found to increase the rate of pressure rise and the burning time of 119</page><page sequence="57">670468-670477 quiescent mixtures, but had no noticeable effect on the spark ignition lean limit.

Study on the Behavior of a Fuel Droplet Injected into the Combustion Chamber of a Diesel Engine. Mitsunobu Ogasawara, Osaka Univ; and Hiroshi Sami, Toyota Motors Co. Ltd. In this study, the burning rate, burning lifetime, and flight distance of a fuel droplet injected into the combustion chamber were formulated, taking into consideration the effects of high air temperature and pressure, and of droplet relative velocity. These formulas were proved to be valid, at least for a droplet in the tip of a puff of spray. They should provide strong clues to the theoretical determination of the minimum cylinder diameter suitable for small-size, direct injection diesel engines SAE Transactions 670469. Piston Temperature in Compression-Ignition Engines. Leon Gross-Gronomski, Israel Inst, of Technology In this paper experimental data for different diesel engine types are described. The influence of load and speed on piston temperature is discussed. The problem whether higher speeds or higher mean effective pressures are preferable for a given output and for its increase are studied with the aid of experimental curves. Dependence of relative piston temperature on fuel consumption is shown for various engines. The role of engine speed in this dependence was found to be complicated. Piston temperature factors were introduced for practical purposes. 670470. Design and Construction Considerations of Radial Passenger Car Tires. F. E. Buddenhagen, Goodrich /B. F./ Co. The radial ply tire has been established as a growing factor in the American tire market because of the many basic advantages the radial ply concept offers as compared to the conventional bias tire. There still remains much work to be done, however, before the full potential of this concept - an efficient and economic means of of combining materials to perform the function of a tire - is realized. In addition, disadvantages must be minimized or eliminated. Modifications in construction and design are means toward these goals and are considered in some depth in this paper. It should be noted that construction and design features consistent with bias tire experience must be carefully re-examined when applied to the radial tire principle. 670471. Performance Characteristics - Radial Ply Tires. W. K. Klamp and W. J. Milligan, United States Rubber Tire Co. The mechanical properties and principles that make up the performance characteristics of the radial ply tire are examined. Harshness, tread wear, skid, traction, stability, puncture resistance, standing height, and power con- sumption are discussed briefly. The necessity for viewing tire performance only in respect to a particular vehicle is emphasized. 670472. Application of Radial Tires for American Cars. J. L. Martin, Ford Motor Co. Radial tires are being used on some Ford vehicles because, despite certain disadvantages, they do appear to offer clear advantages for the tire- vehicle system. The process of adapting radial tires to a vehicle is discussed under the following headings: Selecting the tire. Power spectral density recording methods used for tire-vehicle system noise, vibration, and harshness studies. Application of radial tires to passenger cars.

Vehicle Stability Studied with a Non-Linear Seven Degree Model. Arturo Chiesa and Lucio Rinonapoli, Pirelli S.p.A. This paper describes a new mathematical model developed to account for nonlinearities between vehicles and tires. Lateral and vertical stiffnesses of tires are investigated because they are basic influences on the behavior of the car in sudden and severe maneuvers. The new procedure allows operational simulation and simplifies analyses of cars with different types of tires and suspensions. This is demonstrated by comparing vehicles fitted with a basic tire, a tire with larger lateral stiffness, and a tire with larger lateral force. Calculations show the damping effect of lateral stiffness and the need for increasing both cornering and lateral stiffnesses. Discussion: J. M. Sneyd; Defense Engineering, Chrysler Corp.

The exhaust system is simulated by pulses of compressed air at a frequency of up to 4000 pulses/minute, that is, a 1 cyl 4 stroke cycle engine running at 8000 rpm. The pressure-time histories are calculated by digital computer in terms of the cylinder, exhaust valve, and pipe friction characteristics and compared with the experimental pressure-transducer records at various positions in the exhaust system.

A detailed description of a numerical method for computing unsteady flows in engine intake and exhaust systems is given. The calculations include the effects of heat transfer and friction. The inclusion of such calculations in a mathematically simulated engine cycle is discussed and results shown for several systems. In particular, the effects of bell-mouth versus plain pipe terminations and the effects of a finite surge tank are calculated. Experimental data on the effect of heat transfer from the back of the intake valve on wave damping are given and show the effect to be negligible. Experimental data on wave damping during the valve closed period and on the temperature rise of the air near the valve are also given. Discussion: F. J. Pekar; Mack Trucks, Inc.; T. Wu, K. J.

Borman, Wisconsin Univ. A study was made to determine the effect of heat transfer from the backface of a poppet intake valve on the flow rate through the valve. All tests were made under steady flow conditions. The results show that for the same lift and same pressure drop across the valve, the flow rate through a hot valve is less than through a cold valve. This effect increases almost linearly with the heat transfer rate and decreases rapidly with lift. The results also show that the effective flow area is independent of pressure drop through the valve. A correlation of heat transfer from the back of the valve surface to the flowing air shows that the Nusselt number varies as the 1.27 power of the Reynolds number. 670480. Parametric Studies Using a Mathematically Simulated Diesel Engine Cycle. Harold G. Weber and G. Borman, Wisconsin Univ. A detailed mathematical simulation of a single cylinder, open chamber, naturally aspirated diesel engine was used to predict changes in performance caused by changing various engine design parameters. The computations have, in some cases, been used to obtain the parameter values which give optimum performance. Among the parameters studied are: bore-stroke ratio, valve timing, intake and exhaust valve size, heat release patterns, compression ratio, and atmospheric temperature and pressure. The results are discussed and evaluated in terms of the assumptions used in the calculations. Discussion: W. L. Brown; Caterpillar Tractor Co.; N. J.

Nickol, Ford Motor Co. The influence of engine variables on the concentration of oxides of nitrogen in multicylinder engine exhaust was studied. The concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) were measured with a mass spectrometer or a nondispersive infrared analyzer. It was low for rich operation and increased with air-fuel ratio to a peak at ratios slightly leaner than stoichiometric proportions. A further increase in ratio resulted in reduced NO concentrations. Advanced spark timing, decreased manifold vacuum, increased coolant temperature and combustion-chamber deposit buildup also increased exhaust NO concentration. These results support either directly or indirectly the hypothesis that exhaust NO concentration is primarily a result of the peak combustion gas temperature and the available oxygen. The NO concentration of the exhaust from an individual cylinder is a function of the air-fuel ratio of the charge that the individual cylinder receives. Since the NO concentration as a function of air-fuel ratio is highly nonlinear, it was concluded that the NO concentration of the conglomerate exhaust is a function of distribution as well as overall air-fuel ratio. The NO concentration of the gases expelled from cylinder varies with time. The last portion to be expelled is, at least under some operating conditions, lower in NO concentration than the average of the well-mixed exhaust gas from that cylinder. These results can be explained by flame quenching resulting from the relatively cold combustion chamber walls. 670483. Exhaust Gas Analysis as a Tool for Measuring Fuel-Air Ratios.

Mixture Pre-Treatment for Clean Exhaust - The Zenith "Duplex" Carburation System. G. Lawrence and J. Buttivant, Zenith Carburetter Co. Ltd.; and C. G. O'Neill, Engineering Res. and Application Ltd. A carburetor adapted to exploit the control of exhaust emissions through consistency of metering and mixture quality, particularly in conjunction with a dual bore inlet manifold, is discussed against the background problems faced by the European motor industry. The development and incidental research data which determined the design are followed by a description of production and quality assurance techniques, with special reference to the evolution of automatic flow testing apparatus. 670485. Vehicle Exhaust Emission Experiments Using a Pre-Mixed and Pre-Heated Air-Fuel Charge. J. H. Jones and J. C. Gagliardi, Ford Motor Co. The effects of air-fuel mixture quality and cylinder- to-cylinder air-fuel distribution on exhaust emissions have been determined on two engine-vehicle combinations. Cylinder-to-cylinder air-fuel distribution during the transient operation of the 7-mode California Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Board (CMVPCB) test cycle was measured on two engines. The total carbon emissions for each cylinder during successive test cycles were recorded. It appeared that the vaporization tank significantly improved cylinder-to-cylinder air-fuel distribu- tion for all modes of the cycle. This improvement permitted lean operation and resulted in low carbon monoxide concentrations. CMVPCB cycle hydrocarbon emission levels were similar for both the vaporization tank and the carbureted induction system when compared at equivalent air-fuel ratios. At the leaner air-fuel ratios obtainable with the vaporization tank, an actual increase in cycle hydrocarbon levels was noted. The installation of a 4-in. high intake manifold riser extension, which provided an additional intake charge mixing volume, resulted in an improved cylinder- to-cylinder air-fuel distribution with the conventional lean carburetion. Application of exhaust heat tt this mixing chamber accomplished little in improving the cylinder-to-cylinder air-fuel distribution. 670486. Stylist Comments on Glare-Reduction Regulations. Virgil M. Exner, Exner /Virgil M./ Inc. The recently issued Federal Motor Standard on glare reduction does not pose a problem to the automobile stylist. However, as this standard is expanded it may call for greater restrictions on interior panels and metal components in the driver's view. These future requirements may well call for greater ingenuity on the part of the stylist and for new uses of materials. The author believes the stylist will meet the challenge. 670488. Anti-Glare Finishes for Automotive Stainless Steel Trim. M. J. Johnson, Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corp. Anti-glare finishes may be classified, according to their appearance, into three general groups: "dead-dull," "textured," and "directional." Theeese finishes can be applied to the stainless steel surface by the automotive trim producer, the stainless steel manufacturer or both, by mechanical, chemical or electrochemical methods. Although the challenge of producing anti-glare finishes has been met by the stainless steel industry within a year, research is continuing for the development of new finishes, new methods of applying them, as well as improving the methods and finishes now available. 670489. Nickel Plated Finishes for Glare Reduction. John W. Manquen, Udylite Corp. A new concept in nickel plating is described. The process produces a low gloss finish through the co-deposition of inorganic particles in the nickel deposit. The process is discussed from the standpoint of bath composition, process control, corrosion protection, instrumentation for quality control, and special p ocessing techniques. The low gloss nickel coating provides a method of meeting the requirement for a low specular gloss electroplated finish on certain automotive parts. SAE Transactions 670490. Low Gloss Finishes for Anodized Aluminum Trim. Frank W. Baker, Aluminum Co. of America This paper explains the reflectance characteristics of anodized aluminum and describes the finishing treatments which produce the desired low glow appearance required by The Proposed Federal Motor Vehicles Safety Standards. Certain of these low gloss producing treatments are easily incorporated into existing finishing lines and in many cases are more economical to apply than the present bright specular finish. The materials and processes used to satisfy this proposed standard are discussed fully. s A E Transactions 670491. Application and Deposit Characteristics of Duramir BK Black Chrom Plate. Luther C.

Vacuum metallized parts must comply with the antiglare regulations as set forth by the General Services Administration. This is in spite of the inherent brightness of a vaporized aluminum plate. Ways and means to satisfy these regulations are discussed, and advantages and disadvantages of the several different possible solutions are weighed. 670493. Road Contact Forces of Truck Tires as Measured in the Laboratory. James L. Ginn and Robert L. Marlowe, Goodrich /B. F./ Co. A wide range of laboratory measurements on truck tires is being carried out on a continuous basis. This paper discusses some of these measurements related to ground contact forces and force and moment charai teristics of rolling tires. New laboratory equipment to measure tires on a flat surface and on a 120 in. diameter drum is described, as well as several test procedures carried out on these machines. Potential applicability to vehicle performance is suggested, and lateral force data for a range of truck tire sizes are included for future reference. SA E Transactions 670494. Gas Chromatography - Measuring Exhaust Hydrocarbons Down to Parts Per Billion. Louis J. Papa, E. I. Du Pont de Nemours and Co. Several methods for determining hydrocarbons in automotive exhaust are discussed: nondispersive infrared, ultraviolet, flame-ionization detection, and gas chroma- tography. A gas chromatograpic method is presented for determining individual hydrocarbon components in automotive exhaust. The minimum detectable con- centration of each hydrocarbon is one part per billion (ppb) volume/volume. The method has thus far detedted over two hundred hydrocarbons of all classes, that is, paraffins, olefins, and aromatics, in exhaust. The total analysis time is 25-30 min. A technique for collecting the exhaust sample in small plastic bags is descriaed along with a brief study on the selection of suitable bag material. Techniques for sampling, calibration, and standardization are also discussed. Applications of the method are presented, along with a discussion of the results. Discussion: D. L.

The control of nitrogen oxides by exhaust recirculation has been evaluated theoretically by digital computer simulation of the engine cycle. Nitric oxide emission, power output, and fuel consumption have been considered. Preliminary results indicate that effectiveness of the recirculation method of nitric oxide control can be accounted for by the attendant shift in the peak temperature chemical equilibrium species distribution. The analysis reveals that nitric oxide reduction is highly dependent on fuel-air ratio, and somewhat less dependent on the temperature of recycled exhaust gases. Discussion: T. F.

U.S. Army Human Factors Engineering Pub- lications on Military Wheeled Vehicles. Sylvester E. Kalen, Army Human Engrg. Labs. The goal of the United States Army human factors engineering in Army research, development, test, and evaluation programs is assuring that the fully equipped soldier can operate and maintain Army materiel in all environments. To this end, the United States Army Humat Engineering Laboratories have published several human engineering standards that assist and guide contractor human factors programs, provide design principles and criteria for the design engineers, and serve as a tool the human factors engineering specialist can use in evaluating the materiel he is helping to develop. This paper briefly discusses three of the standards. 670498. Emission Control Devices Demand Improvement in Test Techniques and Motor Oils. F. E. Ghannam and R. I. Potter, Ford Motor Co. Since emission control devices are manadatory on the 1968 automobiles nationwide, the recirculation of blowby gases within the engine necessitates a new approach to the evaluation of engine oils. New test methods incorporating these closed ventilation systems, namely, the Falcon Rust Test and the Sequence V-B Sludge Test, are necessary for predicting motor oil performance. Closed ventilation systems increase the load on the motor oil, and complicate the lubrication mechanism because these highly acidic blowby lases are recycled. In the West Coast area, where both open and closed systems were first used, performance of many branded motor oils deteriorated; others were unaffected. Examples of corrosive engine wear were observed where improper motor oils were used. This paper provides a portion of the technical record of meeting this challenge, and points out important oil test parameters and additive combinations effective in meeting these new problems. 670499. Balanced Motor Oils for 1968 Engines. C. C. Colyer, American Oil Co; and L. J. Allman and R. M. Ladevich, American Oil Co. Federal law mandates that all United States passenger-car gasoline engines be equipped with crankcase and exhaust emission devices in 1968. These devices, combined with 123</page><page sequence="61">670500-670506 increased short-trip stop-and-go driving under extended oil drain periods, likely will challenge the perfomance properties of motor oils. Interim results from various field and laboratory tests show that motor oils are available to meet the expected needs of 1968 engines, provided the oils are drained more frequently as engine mileage accumulates. The MS sequence tests were found to be reliable laboratory test tools to screen motor oils prior to field testing. As experience accumulates with 1968 engines, continued surveillance by both the automotive and petroleum industries is recommended to keep engine requirements and motor oil qualities in tune with each other. 670500. Brake Drums - Designed for Compatibility. Paul G. Wilier, Kelsey-Hayes Co., Gunite Div. Brake drums and brake linings work together to control vehicle deceleration. The best brake drum material is fully compatible with the various linings made by reputable manufacturers. Brake drum size and shape can be varied to provide adequate resistance to mechanical and thermal stresses while effectively storing and transferring heat to the atmosphere. 670501. Conditions Upsetting Brake Lining and Drum Compatibility. Robert W. Kickel, Carlisle Corp., Molded Materials Div. In order to maintain designed mating compatibility of brake drum and lining, we rely on assistance from the field maintenance personnel and the vehicle operators. Specifically, they must recognize environmental and mechanical conditions that prevent the compatibility of the brake lining and brake drums and based on their all around knowledge of braking fundamentals and experience correct these conditions. This paper covers: theoretical braking concept; internal conditions contributing to noncompatibility of drum and linings; foreign conditions contributing to noncompatibility of drums and linings; corrections. 670502. Brake Linings as Related to Brake Drums and Brake Performance. Robert E. Nelson, Abex Corp., Amer. Brakeblok Div. It is necessary to consider the brake lining and brake drum as a mating pair for optimum perfornmance. Some of the characteristics of brake linings, the interrelationship of the brake drum, and their combined effect on certain aspects of brake performance are discussed. Temperature, rubbing speed, unit pressure, and mating surface material are factors affecting the coefficient of friction of the lining. Brake maintenance also affects the operation of the lining as well as the entire brake system. By understanding the various properties of linings and drums and the concept of mating pairs, certain compromises can be reached which offer optimum performance for a specific set of operating conditions. 670503. Photostress Study of Spur Gear Teeth. Marion G. Pottinger, Air Force Aerospace Res. Labs.; and Raymond Cohen and Ervin O. Stitz, Purdue Univ. An experimental-analytic method of determining the stress distribution in narrow faced spur gear teeth is presented. The successful application of photostress to this contact problem is reported. It utilizes a digital computer routine developed for separating stresses in any general two-dimensional region. Results for two pairs of gears are presented. Comparison is made with values predicted by the modified Lewis formula, the Kelley and Pedersen equation, and by the Belajef solution of the Hertz contact problem for two cylinders. 670504. Study of the Effect of the Induction Hardening Variables on the Residual Stresses and Bending Fatigue Strength of Final Drive Gears. R. A. Cellitti, International Harvester Co. Various induction hardening metallurgical variables for several induction hardening experiments in hardening gears are outlined and related to heat energy inputs and their effect on the bending fatigue strength of gears. The experiments included residual stress measurements by X-ray diffraction and by sectioning and etching techniques; bending fatigue tests; metallurgical examination comprising microhardness traverse tests and micro- structure-macrostructure evaluations; and dimensional analysis. Based on the results outlined, it was concluded that detrimental residual tensile stresses in the fillet surface of the tooth and the presence of dark etching transformation products near the surface can affect the performance of induction hardened gears in bending fatigue, and that metallurgical requirements can be specified to improve the reliability of induction hardened gears. SAE Transactions 670505. Trends in Braking Techniques of the European Vehicles. Andre Furia, Sully Schachter and Pierre Gancel, DBA, France Disc brakes and modulating valves work together to improve the stability of a car during braking. This fact, as well as% the increased possibility of braking control, comprise the main reasons for the tendency of European manufacturers to employ four disc brakes and modulating valves in their cars. Floating and fixed calipers are both used, but the first category has advantages which seem conclusive for the future. The next step could be the use of antiskid devices, the object of considerable research efforts, none of which has given any conclusive results to date. 670506. Characteristics and Applications of Trailer Surge Brake Systems. B. L. Douglass, Atwood Vacuum Machine Co. The rapidly increasing number of passenger car trailers using public highways has focused attention on trailer 124</page><page sequence="62">670507-670512 brake systems. One of these systems, the surge or momentum actuated type, has received particular attention because it offers automatic trailer braking inherently synchronized with different deceleration rates of the towing vehicle as well as with different gross trailer weights. This system presents new considerations that must be evaluated in establishing overall system performance and extent of application. This evaluation is described here. 670507. Turbine Blade Vibrations of Turbocbargers. V. A. Zastrow and E. R. Bernson, Caterpillar Tractor Co. The causes of turbine blade excitation are described, and the factors that influence amplitudes of vibration are discussed. Blade rotation in an asymmetrical pressure field produces a periodic force on the blade. Harmonics of this periodic force excite the blades at their natural frequencies. Gas disturbances created by nozzle vanes also can excite the blades. Amplitudes are affected by the type of exhaust system combined with the type of turbine housing, turbine housing design, engine speed, vane design, and any local gas disturbance or condition that creates asymmetrical gas flow through the turbine housing.

Chwa≈Çek, Bendix Corp., Brake and Steering Div. The experimental program described here was conducted in order to determine the effect of fixed and variable steering gear ratio on driver task performance. Three fixed gearbox ratios and two variable ratios of the Bendix Varamatic type were tested, using a single vehicle. Four steady turn driving tasks were used, each producing the same lateral "g" (0.2g) and a transient maneuver task, induced by applying a step change in front wheel angle to the vehicle, was also used. The pool of test subjects consisted of student drivers with an average of 39 hr of on-the-road driving experience. 670509. Story of the "Beta" Group - An Unusual Organization Working on Brake Lining Problems. Robert E. Antheil, Inland Mfg. Div., GMC An interdivisional organization has been formed within General Motors to supply special information to assist in the development of friction materials. People with special talents from nine different divisions of the corporation have been active contributors in the exploration of 33 special projects by this organization, which has been called the "Beta" Group. From these projects have come new procedures, new devices, and new information which should be helpful to chassis engineers and development people who are interested in brake lining improvements. 670510. Laboratory Evaluation of Brake Lining Materials. Albin J. Burkman and Frank H. Highley, General Motors Corp. The laboratory evaluation of brake lining materials at General Motors Engineering Staff is discussed. Physical aspects that may occur during test which were of concern are swell, shrinkage, blistering, extrusion, and sloughing. The friction materials test machine and test procedures are described. Frictional characteristics considered in the testing are friction level, uniformity of output, shape of family curves, fade, fade and recovery, and resistance to moisture. Test results are presented in the form of sample plot sheets of good and poor lining performance. Good linings showed a fairly uniform coefficient of friction and consistent grouping of the family curves, in contrast to the excessive spread and erratic values of the poor lining example. 670511. Chemical Changes at Brake Wear Surfaces. R. L. Gatrell and T. P. Schreiber, General Motors Res. Labs. During a fundamental investigation aimed at the further improvement of organic disc brake linings, chemical studies were made of brake wear surfaces. Electron microprobe and infrared analysis were used to study the layer which forms on the lining and the film which forms on the drum when a new lining is broken in. Both the lining surface layer and the drum film are discontinuous and contain thermally decomposed asbestos. Calcined asbestos as an added ingredient in experimental linings resulted in markedly improved frictional performance. Further elucidation of braking phenomena appears to be forthcoming from the analysis of films that form on the drum surface. SAE Transactions 670512. New Devices to Assist in Friction Material Development. Richard A. Muzechuk, Inland Mfg. Div., GMC Five test devices were developed to aid in the development of new friction materials. A friction machine has been equipped with disc brake apparatus and the data compared with standard drum friction machine data. A method has been developed which utilizes fast response thermocouples to measure interface temperature distribution during dynamometer tests. Extremely high temperatures have been noted. Three laboratory tests were developed to evaluate brake materials' susceptibility to produce noise: vibration tests to measure dynamic characteristics; friction machine tests to measure negative damping; slip-stick machine 125</page><page sequence="63">670514-670524 tests which use the lining's noise producing tendency to excite a resonant system. Correlation of these tests with vehicle data were investigated and are discussed in the paper. 670514. Application of Infrared Spectroscopic and Gas Chromatographic Techniques to Brake Lining Development. George Rappaport and Gerald C. Goldfinger, Inland Mfg. Div., GMC Infrared and gas chromatographic techniques are capable of yielding compositional data on the organic constituents of brake linings. Examples will be given relating such compositional data to the state of cure of the resin binder, to the presence or absence of specific organic friction modifiers, and to determining whether or not the proper resin binder system was used. The success of the above techniques in the solution of specific brake lining problems does not necessarily recommend them as quality control tools. 670517. Development of Techniques and Equipment to Improve Reliability of Automotive Diagnosis. E. L. Cline, Automotive Center Consultants, Inc., and Clayton Mfg. Co. Findings obtained through mass diagnosis provide a practical insight, useful in the development of: multiple personnel work procedures, efficient facility layout, testing techniques that answer field service problems, equipment and personnel education that implement these techniques, and solutions to novel architectural problems inherent with indoor vehicle operation. New lower cost equipment permits reasonable amortization with lesser vehicle through put. Capabilities of the Lane and Bay type facility are also compared. A highly coordinated system, including management, personnel, building area, and machines offer a solution to the routine detection of the exact cause of existing or potential vehicle problems in both small to large operations. Reliable diagnosis provides the opportunity to recommend specific repairs and in an order of urgency. 670519. (SP-290) High Output Diesel Engines: Daimler- Benz High Output Engines - A Study in Compact Design. Otto Herschmann, Daimler- Benz A.G. To meet the increased power demands for special vehicles, Daimler-Benz started the development of a compact, liquid-cooled diesel engine family some 12 years ago. The objective of this development was to obtain a maximum output from a given bulk volume while maintaining well-known diesel engine characteristics. The basic layout of this family was such as to offer a high degree of versatility and to allow continued development. Based on this existing engine family, the development of a 1500 hp engine was started about three years ago. Reducing the bulk volume and, at the same time, increasing the specific output, resulted in a very compact engine, producing 28.4 hp per cu ft of bulk volume. This paper presents some of the considerations made in the design of these engines and some interesting technical data. Discussion: W. P. Mansfield; BICERI, Ltd.; W. L.

Cycle simulation can be used for design studies, it can predict trends, it can serve as a diagnostic tool, it can give more complete data than normally obtained from experiments, and it helps in understanding of complex processes.

(SP-292) Engineering Know-How in Engine Design - Heat Rejection and Cooling Require- ments of Internal-Combustion Engines. Robert Cramer, Jr., Murphy Diesel Co. This paper develops methods of calculating the heat rejection of internal combustion engines so that these quantities can be used in selecting radiators and oil coolers. The importance of heat which is rejected, though often not recognized, is that it is the source of most engine trouble and also is the basic determinant for the 126</page><page sequence="64">670525-670530 rating of an engine. Part of the heat which is rejected is carried away in the exhaust gases, the remainder passes through the metallic walls of the engine, causing expansion and internal stress in the parts. Also discussed are input-output relationships in the engine as well as calculations for heat loss and engine cooling phenomena. The methods developed give some insight into the thermodynamic efficiency of the internal combustion engine. 670525. (SP-292) Engineering Know-How in Engine Design - Engine Cooling Radiators. James D. Morse, Modine Mfg. Co. The radiator in today's internal combustion engine has many functions in addition to its primary job of cooling the engine. The name "radiator" is a misnomer since its function is that of a heat exchanger that transfers heat by means of forced convection. Considerations involvedd in radiator design depend upon functions performed by the radiator, space available for its installation, the environment in which it must operate, and basic economics. Presented in this paper are design details pertaining to methods of construction, kinds of materials used, and types of fins and core designs. Other factors to be considered are necessary coolant reserve, deaeration, use of pressure caps, and types of mountings. All these factors must be considered but practical limits as to space and cost often cause decisions to be made to the detriment of any one particular function. 670526. (SP-292) Engineering Know -How in Engine Design - Small Internal-Combustion Engine Design - Cooling and Associated Parameters, Heat Rejection Methods. R. E. Perlewitz, Lon Mooney and Wm. Kalweit, Tecumseh Prod. Co., Power Prod. Div. In the case of small, lightweight aircooled engines the fin design is of utmost importance. The basic consideration is to make maximum use of the material in the cylinder to obtain maximum heat transfer for minimum material used. The trapezoidal fin approaches the ideal construction and is more effective than either the rectangular or triangular types. The author illustrates how thinner fins mean better utilization of material, together with an additional advantage in that cooling surfaces are doubled and the amount of heat transferred is increased. An important point to be considered is the spacing of the fins so that airflow is not reduced between them. Finally, provisions must be made for the disposition of foreign materials, which may block airflow, if the engine is to operate in a dirty environment. 670527.

The moving parts of the ignition system such as the distributor shaft which is driven from the cam shaft, centrifugal weights which move the cam, vacuum advance mechanism, and rubbing block with breaker points and rotor can and will be eliminated with the aid of solid state electronics. An analysis of the ignition coil and factors influencing its design as well as its vital part in the present-day system is reviewed. Also mentioned briefly are the transistor system and capacitor discharge ignition system and their current state of application. It is believed that solid state devices and integrated circuits will develop greater reliability and greater cost advantages for the consumer. 670528.

While the Boeing 2707 SST will operate in environments that are new to commercial passenger airplanes, its flight control system introduces no radical changes in operating procedures. All Primary Flight Control surfaces are operated by triple, non-interconnected hydraulic systems. The normal mode of longitueinal and lateral control employs an Electrical Command System and mechanical backup is provided. Multi-channel Stability Augmentation is introduced on all three control axes.

Five different types were considered: 1. Cooled hydraulic system. 2. Liquid metal system. 3. Pneumatic system. 4. Pulsating flow hydraulic system (using conventional fluid in the moderate temperature, and liquid metal in the higher temperature portions of the vehicle). 5. Mechanical system. These systems have been evaluated for use in a high Mach number cruise aircraft on the basis of weight, power requirements, and cooling requirements. As a result of this study, a cooled hydraulic system appears to be the most desirable choice for a first generation hypersonic cruise aircraft. SA E Transactions 670531.

In both craft the concentration of methane increases with time because it is not removee easily and there are continuing sources. Tobacco smoking in submarines generates large quantities of carbon monoxide which is catalytically burned. Its presence in significant quantities in SeaLab II is not fully explained.

(P-17) Ocean Engineering in the Underwater Launch Testing of Polaris. George Mechlin and C. Robert Brown, Westinghouse Elee. Corp. Testing the underwater launching of Polaris missile test vehicles had to be done from an unmanned and remttely operated underwater facility before test missile launchings from a submarine could be safely and reliably ac- complished. The development and operation of equipment to perform these tests rivaled and perhaps surpassed the technical problems of the tactical missile launcher. It was necessary to duplicate the undersea environment of the submarine, including water depth and relative ship-water motion from the effect of surface waves and from the way of the submarine. Further, it was necessary to arrest the fallback of inert test vehicles after launch to avoid damage to the launcher and to allow postlaunch evaluation of the structural integrity of the test vehicle. The servicing of the surfaced launch vessel was accomplished at a catamaran type work barge, and the operation of the submerge launch vessel was accomplished from a monitor ba le. Prelaunch positioning of the launch vessel wa i ted by Scuba divers and observed by underwater closed-circuit television network. Ar esthnt of test vehicle fallback was first accomplished by an underwater net system which was later replaced by a cranesupported net that caught the test vehicle after it broached surface water Relative water motion was generated by mounting the launch vessel on an underwater sled that aiile ated the launch vessel to a predetermined velocity before launching the test vehiil ich then decelerated the launch vessel to rest. 128</page><page sequence="66">670538-670547 670538.

(P-17) Survey of Reaction Control Systems ftr Synchronous Satellites. M. Edmund Ellion, H. DiCristina and L. M. Wolf, Hughes Aircraft Co., Space Systems Div. The analysis performed in the selection of a reaction control system for a spinning synchronous satellite is presented. A 2000-lb satellite is chosen as an illustrative example and the detailed steps followed in defining a tradeoff study leading to the selection of a preferred propulsion system are described. A "genesis" t the propulsion systems' requirements is presented, followed by a definition of those criteria used in the selection of the optimum reactitn control system. The paper then reviews a list of candidate propulsion systems and carefully examines their performance potential, state of development, and limitations. Finally, a tradeoff study is effected for the illustrative satellite in which total reaction control system weights are compared. In order to reasonably limit the scope of this paper, other criteria used in real system evaluation, such as availability, reliability, state of develtpmen≈• and so forth, are not developed in detail, but are, of course, governing factors in the overall comparison.

Volatile liquid pressurization provides an improved method of expelling storable propellants for spacecraft reaction control system engines by eliminating the requirement for a high pressure storage and distribution capability. The volatile liquid system, which is particularly attractive if in-flight refueling is to be considered, utilizes the energy resulting from the phase change of a volatile liquid caused by a controlled heat input. Parameters to consider in volatile liquid selection and system design are presented. Typical test expulsion characteristics of sub-scale and flightweight systems are described. SAE Transactions 670545. (P-17) Development of a Lumped Parameter Model for a Monopropellant Hydrazine Reaction Chamber. Vincent J. Sansevero, Jr., United Aircraft Corp., Hamilton Standard Div. Catalytic decomposition of hydrazine and hydrazine blend propellants has been recognized as an efficient means of providing warm gas for direct thrust or auxiliary power in many current and future applications. In most of these applications, the dynamics which relate propellant inlet flow to gas output flow have a significant influence on the overall system design. It therefore, becomes essential that these dynamics be predicted and tailored for each system. In general, the approach to date to this problem has been from two extremes: the empirical evaluation of specific configuration and the analytical study of a completely distributed parameter microscopic model. The first approach does not lend itself to tailoring of the reaction chamber for specific systems. The second approach could produce both prediction and tailoring capability if accurate values of reaction and diffusion rates as a function of numerous environmental and geometric parameters were available. The experimental measurement of these parameters during actual reactor operation does not presently appear practical. It is the objective of the paper to present a compromise approach to this problem. A lumped parameter model which includes an overall mass and energy balance for the reaction chamber is developed. This model is based upon empirically determined reaction and diffusion rate coefficients. 670546. (P-17) Plessey Constant-Speed Drive/Starter and Its Application to the BAC1-11 Commercial Transport. R. L. Smith, American Airlines, Inc. The Plessey CSDS is a pneumatically trimmed unit which assumes the dual role of a constant-speed drive and engine starter on the BAC 1-11 commercial transport. This unit is basically an epicyclic gear train which takes inputs from both the engine and a reversible Roots type air motor/blower to drive an a-c generator at a constant speed. This paper discusses the design, operation, and performance of this unique unit. 670547. (P-17) AGD- Concept to Configuration. Stephen S. Baits and Joseph P. Mooney, Sundstrand Corp. This paper narrates the thinking that led to the selection of the basic design of the constant-speed drive, explaining the reasons for the choice of the schematic and the various components, such as hydraulic units, differential gears, and governor. Some configurations which have been produced by scaling and/or rearranging the design without introducing any significant development requirements are presented. The design has proved to be lighter, to have longer life, is less expensive to operate than previous designs, and is a commercial success. 129</page><page sequence="67">670548-670553 670548. (P-17) Noise Control of Aircraft Auxiliary Power Units. Vernon E. Callaway, Boeing Co., Commercial Airplane Div. Lower noise levels are required from auxiliary power unit (APU) installations on board commercial aircraft to make these compact, high-energy, turbine power sources more acceptable at terminal gate positions. Special acoustical materials and installation techniques that fulfill high-temperature requirements and stringent fire-safety demands are needed to control the three principal noise sources: the inlet, the case, and the exhaust. In addition, practicable noise criteria are needed which do not create requirements that excessively compromise APU performance or increase installed weight. Fulfillment of the preceding requisites for APU installations on the Boeing Model 727-100 and Model 737 aircraft is discussed. Suggestions for noise control practices to be folllowed in turbine design are also presented. SAE Transactions 670549. (P-17) Means for Reducing Bypass Flow Requirements in Liquid Hydrogen and Liquid Oxygen Tank Mounted Boost Pumps on Centaur Vehicle. A. V. Pradhan, G. H. Caine and J. F. DiStefano, Borg-Warner Corp., Pesco Products Div. Cryogenic centrifugal pumps cannot be operated at extremely low flow rates without internal boiling of the fluid. Hence bypassing part of the flow becomes necessary. This paper presents an analysis for minimizing bypass flow on the Centaur boost pumps. Various effects are discussed in detail. The temperature-pressure relationships in the liquid hydrogen boost pump are evaluated in relation to bypass flow requirement to determine if this flow rate can be reduced or eliminated. The minimum quantity of flow without any bypass was analytically estimated and it was observed that it compared closely with the test results. SAE Transactions 670550. (P-17) Space Power and the Progression of Manned Space Flight Requirements. Robert N. Parker, Langley Res. Center, NASA The application of space-power technology to a possible progression of manned space flight requirements is presented. Of particular concern are the spectrum of mission requirements and constraints which strongly influence the selection and integration of a space-power concept with manned spacecraft, and the desire to "build-in" as much intrinsic value as possible into hardware decisions. Although the post-Apollo goals have not been established, an orderly progression of the manned space flight activity can be postulated which extends from immediate exploitation of Apollo earth- orbital capability to manned exploration of the planets. A multipurpose space station occupies a predominant role within this progression and will provide the major stimuli for the development of new and improved space-power concepts. SAE Transactions 670551. (P-17) Structural Analysis and Design of a Large Area Solar Array. R. C. Weikel, Boeing Co. The problem of establishing the configuration and sizing of the primary structure of a large area solar array yielding 20 watts-per-pound is analyzed. The factors affecting the structural design and examined in this paper include: 1 . Effects of launch environment, 2. Deploying and deployed phases of a typical mission, 3. The impact of ground support and test equipment upon the design, and 4. Fabrication problems affecting the structural design. The analyses consider: 1 . The dynamic and internal loads, 2. Temperature distribution and thermal control, 3. Selection of materials, 4. Weight distribution, and 5. Interface of the structural and electrical technologies. It is found that the feasibility of design of a 20-watts-per-pound large area solar array is within the present state-of-the-art only if beryllium is used to transmit primary loads.

Application studies of fluidic technology have demon- strated its adaptability and versatility in several ramjet control systems. Schemes for mechanizing three typical controls with fluidic elements to the extent now feasible are presented. Fluidics is incorporated in sensing, logic, and actuation functions. Digital and analog techniques are employed. The three controls are: the inlet control which optimizes performance through modulation of the centerbody position, the fuel control which maintains the desired fuel-air ratio, and the coolant control which manages the fuel distribution in the engine structure to maintain structural integrity. Performance analyses and test results are included. SAE Transactions 670553. (P-17) Flueric Sun Sensor- Actuator, A Solar Attitude Control System. Lawrence S. Galowin and Albertus E. Schmidlin, General Precision, Inc. A preliminary analytical investigation of a flueric solar attitude control device performing the functions of both sensor and actuator was conducted. The system cycle was based upon only incident solar energy as the power source and heat rejection by radiation to space. The working fluid continuously experiences a change of phase 130</page><page sequence="68">670556-670560 liquid to vapor and recondensation to liquid. The fluid in the liquid phase is pumped by surface tension forces in a porous wick material within the annular volume and also provides large surface area for the heat exchange function in the evaporator. As a result of angular misalignment from the sun direction an unbalanced mass flow develops. From consideration of the redistribution of angular momentum (in the sense of a momentum flywheel) it was shown that the vehicle can be rotated to re-establish alignment with the sun direction. The numerical results indicate the feasibility of the concept for space applications. Initial design estimates for space vehicle applications were shown in terms of the vehicle mass and required radiant energy exchange areas. 670556. (P-17) Pneumatic Power for Satellite Control. D. A. Sheets, Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. Fluid systems are receiving widespread usage in space vehicles. Typical applications include the use of pneumatic power for attitude control of an orbiting satellite. Selection of a pneumatic system for satellite control is predicated on certain key requirements and constraints imposed upon the system. Chief among these are thrust level, total impulse, electrical power, weight, reliability, and cost. The above parameters are considered in a case example of tradeoff studies that ultimately leads to a pneumatic system design for attitude control of a long-life orbiting satellite. 670557. (P-17) Permanent Joints for Agena Pressure Systems. Robert H. Goslow, Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. Difficulties in retaining pressurized gases in Agena separable-connector tubing systems dictated a permanent joint solution. Vehicle considerations indicated brazed joints for application to this particular family of space vehicles. Selection of joining method, application problems, and interesting test results are discussed. Projection of the effects of permanent joints, welded or brazed, on system component design and testing in the immediate and distant future are presented. 670558. (P-17) Surface Tension Devices for Management of Space Propulsion System Propellants. S. C. De Brock, Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. The surface tension principles applicable to the design of propellant management devices for the static retention and dynamic control of space propulsion system propellants are discussed briefly. The characteristics of ideal propellant retention and control (management) systems are introduced as criteria for judging proposed designs. Three typical missions are examined and capillary principles applied to obtain designs of propellant management systems. The designs are functionally characterized as (a) large tank high thrust systems, (b) long-life low-thrust systems, and (c) minimum center of gravity travel systems. The leading mission requirements and constraints and their influence on the design of capillary propellant management systems are discussed. The operational characteristics of the design solutions are related and their performance, passive reliability, and manufacturing complexities discussed. Flight and design analysis experience are presented and simulation test techniques introduced. SAE Transactions 670559. (P-17) Flotation Requirements for Aircraft. R. G. Ahlvin and D. N. Brown, Army Engr. Waterways Exper. Station A need exists for some quantitative measure of an aircraft's support or flotation requirements on the ground. It has been possible to satisfy this need, at least to a substantial degree, through the use of established relations between airfield or landing strip strength and aircraft ground loading characteristics. Using these established relations, aircraft ground-flotation require- ments have been developed which permit assessment of the flotation characteristics of any aircraft or proposed aircraft design. Comparisons between aircraft or setting of minimum flotation requirements for proposed aircraft are made possible by use of these developments. This paper presents limited background on ground- flotation criteria development and some of the concepts on which current criteria are based. It gives an insight into various problem areas in development of the criteria and explains the extent or limits of applicability of flotation criteria now in use. In the final portion of the paper, emphasis is given to the particular aircraft characteristics that contribute good or high flotation and some discussion is presented of factors, not treated by current criteria, which recent research indicates may have a significant effect on flotation.

Petersons, Air Force FLIGHT Dynamics Lab. In recent years the Air Force Dynamics Laboratory (AFFDL) has actively attempted to develop improved techniques and criteria for providing aircraft with a capability for landing on substandard fields. The scope of approaches investigated includes expandable tires, extra wide tires, low pressure tires, track gear, air cushion gear, and basic flotation criteria. This paper summarizes the significant results of these programs. The paper summarizes the available criteria for ground flotation on bare soil and indicates approaches for improving aircraft ground flotation characteristics. Also included are the results of AFFDL tests of conventional tires tested at high deflection, and of conventional (expandable) tires which collapse for 131</page><page sequence="69">670561-670566 stowage. Finally, the advantages and limitation of unconven- tional gear such as the track gear and the air cushion are discussed: It is concluded that: Conventional 17.00-20 and 20.00-20 size tires may be operated at 50 percent deflection for at least 30 landings. An expandable tire which expands from 38 in. diameter to 59 in. diameter performed satisfac- torily per spec MIL-T-5041. The air cushion landing gear offers promise for providing a breakthrough in high flotation capability for aircraft. 670561. (P-17) C-54 Landing Gear. Norman S. Currey, Lockheed-Georgia Co. High flotation was a basic parameter in the C-5A landing gear design when it was first conceived and a computerized study of 2600 landing variants revealed the present design to be optimum for an airplane with the weight and mission concept of the C-5A. The history of the C-5A landing gear is reviewed, and the evolution of its various requirements - kneeling, steering, weight and flotation. The problem areas are discussed and the subsequent final design details are given in order to show the interrelationships between the requirements, problems and solutions. The overall design and capabilities of the landing gear are reviewed, including the results of using various flotation criteria on both Support area and Zone of Interior runways, with changing weight, center of gravity position and soil strength.

The landing gears of the OV-10A have been designed to meet extremely severe landing and operating conditions. The articulated main gear and semi-articulated nose gear assemblies have proved to be well suited to meeting the requirements for high sink rate landings onto bumps, steps, and holes, in addition to taxiing and making take-offs over undulating contours.

(P-17) Sheaves: A Growth Contaminant in Hydrocarbon Systems. J. L. Bicknell, Bendix Corp., Missile Systems Div. The deleterious effect of particulate contamination on the performance of dirt-sensitive hydrocarbon systems has long been recognized. To cope with this problem, industry has expended considerable energy in devising test methods, developing cleaning techniques, improving processes, and establishing contamination controls. In recent years, the resulting improvement in system cleanliness, fluid cleanliness, and analytical techniques have allowed detection of a whole new family of previously-masked contaminants - the chemical "growth" products. Increased stagnant storage time has now brought to light still another of these growth con- taminants - "sheaves." This paper describes the physical characteristics of these dendriform crystals, identifies their origin, discusses their potential effect on system performance, and presents possible corrective actions. SAE Transactions 670565. (P-17) O-Ring Permeation Measurements for Selected Pressures and Gland Designs. J. V. Baum and T. M. Trainer, Battelle Memorial Inst., Columbus Labs. Measurements were made of helium permeation rates for O-rings subjected to helium pressure on one side and vacuum on the other. Helium pressures up to 1000 psi were used in the investigation. Gland designs included grooves for O-ring squeezes from 25 to 75 percent, dual O-ring grooves, and two tongue-and-groove configurations. Calculations were made of the expected permeation rates based on material permeability data. The results of this study indicate that dual O-rings and close-fitting tongue-and-groove designs provide permeation rates that are lower than the rates that are calculated by conventional methods. 670566.

A technique for simulating the zero-gravity-environment inside and outside space vehicles is described. A servo-driven/computer-controlled simulator provides motion to the astronaut equivalent to that experienced in a zero-g environment. The instrumentation systems required to generate the necessary input data to the analog computer, programmed with the EVA/IVA dynamic equations, are discussed. The instrumentation consists of a load cell array to sense the forces and moments applied to the spacecraft by the astronaut during orbital activity and a unique limb motion sensor that continuously measures the astronaut's limb positions. The design considerations for the simulator are presented, and various space missions conducted on the simulator, with primary emphasis on EVA, are discussed. SAE Transactions 670569. (P-17) Control Moment Gyro Development and Test. C. R. Keckler and A. Fontana, Langley Res. Center, NASA Extensive research conducted by the Langley Research Center has led to the development of a spacecraft control system employing three control moment gyros (CMG). This concept has been selected as the baseline control system for the Apollo Telescope Mount (ATM) which is being developed by the Marshall Space Flight Center. Langley is providing Marshall with the necessary supporting research to insure a successful ATM flight. A full-scale CMG unit has been procured to determine CMG hardware characteristics and non- linearities. To evaluate the effects of these nonlinearities on the control capability of a CMG system, the unit has been incorporated into an analog simulation of spacecraft control for the ATM. This paper presents a description of the physical and hardware characteristics of the CMG unit, and discusses results obtained from the system simulations for ATM. These results indicate that the Langley CMG system can meet all ATM spacecraft pointing requirements. 670571. (P-17) XC-142A Control System. G. K. Fling, LTV Aerospace Corp.

Delvin E. Littell, Robert W. Bailey and William P. Schane, Army Aeromedicai Res. Unit U.S. Army fixed wing aircraft employed in Vietnam at present range in sophistication from the O-l, "Bird Dog", a single engine, two place light aircraft, to the OV-1, "Mohawk", twin engine, two place turboprop aircraft. Each aircraft has unique escape problems and employs different methods that are appropriate to meet the requirement. U.S. Army rotary wing aircraft in R. V. N. range in sophistication from the OH- 13, "Sioux", to the CH-47A, "Chinook". All rotary wing aircraft present a formidable escape system design problem. Attempts to design such a system have been made, but none have become available for operational use. Therefore, no single escape system operation at the present time is appropriate for all Army aircraft. Current practice prohibits the employment of an escape system for crew members that is not available for passengers in Army aircraft, for example, the aeromedicai evacuation aircraft. Current escape systems designed to safely land the cabin area of the aircraft to the ground by parachutes are not available for the larger Army aircraft, or are too heavy for the smaller Army aircraft. Therefore, there is a continuing requirement for the development of a single type system compatible with all Army aircraft. 670576. (P-17) Helicopter Personnel Escape, Protection and Survival System. F. Terry Thomasson, Naval Air Systems Command Headquarters The technical and medical aspects of the United States Navy's program to develop a complete system to ensure the survival of helicopter occupants is treated. The "fuselage capsule," composed of pyrotechnic devices to jettison rotor blades and extraneous fuselage portions and ballistically deployed and ballistically spread parachutes to recover the occupied portion of the fuselage, is to be the heart of the system. However, to guarantee injury free survival, energy attenuating seats, helicopter mounted energy absorption devices and fire prevention and suppression devices will be integral parts of the system.

Aviation, Inc., Columbus Div. 133</page><page sequence="71">670578-670581 The LW-3b Escape System was designed for low and medium performance V/STOL aircraft. The recovery capability of the system at speeds less than 200 knots, where most ejections from these aircraft occur, exceeds all contemporary escape systems, with the exception of other LW systems, which utilize the same parachute deployment system. This advance in the state of the art was achieved by arranging a standard, 28-ft personnel parachute so that it is deployed immediately after seat-aircraft separation, thus reducing as much as 3 sec the time from initiation of the escape sequence to full inflation of the recovery parachute. The recovery capability of the system at speeds greater than 200 knots is comparable to contemporary systems. The system is lightweight and easily maintained, and it requires no special tools and no ground support equipment other than the safety pin harness. This paper describes the operation of the two-mode LW-3B Escape System and its development and qualification program. SA E Transactions 670578. (P-17) Techniques for Space and Hypersonic Flight Escape (Paracone). R. T. Kendall, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. A single, efficient, reliable emergency escape system is needed to provide, at an acceptable total cost, emergency escape capability throughout the entire mission envelope of hypersonic and orbital vehicles. Analysis and limited testing indicate that the Douglas Paracone emergency escape system will meet this requirement. The Paracone is a gas-inflatable structure shaped like a cone with a large spherical nose. When the cone is deployed, the crew is positioned and supported within the cone approximately one third the length of the cone as measured from the leading edge of the spherical nose. The crew is suspended over an air mattress flotation plenum chamber which, in turn, is located over a gas impact attenuator. SA E Transactions 670579. (P-17) Design Objectives for Tomorrow's Escape Systems. James J. McCormack and Ernest M. Chase, Jr., Air Force Systems Engrg. Group Escape systems for USAF aircraft must be designed to successfully recover crew members from disabled aircraft under a myriad of conditions. These conditions encompass a wide speed range, vary with altitude, and involve adverse aircraft attitudes including high sink rates. Designing a system which will satisfactorily perform over the entire spectrum poses many problems which necessitates various trade offs to achieve a practical escape system. Emphasis is now being placed on low speed, low altitude, high sink rate, and adverse attitude escape capability. This is a significant problem area today and will be even more important with the advent of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft. Escape and recovery under these conditions can be achieved only when the time from initiation of the escape sequence to full inflation of the parachute is kept to a minimum. However, the high speed performance of aircraft is increasing which further complicates the escape system design. This paper briefly analyzes the ejection systems of the past, emplores the proposals for today's and explains the criterion that must be embodied in tomorrow's design to meet the expanding requirements of USAF aircraft.

The simulation of the hydrospace environment is an undertaking that is difficult, expensive and attended by a certain degree of danger. At the present, it is really only possible to simulate adequately the pressure and temperature of the ocean depths, with some limited simulation of the sea water chemistry by using fresh sea water in an open loop hydraulic system. The other limitations on simulating hydrospace, such as the heat sink capability and shock wave absorption, are not to be solved easily, or soon. However, as vessels are constructed which are larger and more pressure resistant, and other components become available which are not only reliable, durable and safe under the severe service encountered in operating a high pressure and large volume hydrospace simulation facility, but are also more refined and ingenious, additional hydrospace parameters will be incorporated in the land based simulated hydrospace system. The scientific principles describing the operation of simulated hydrospace are known, what is required is a high level engineering effort to translate those scientific principles into an operational hardware system that will permit the creation of a simulated hydrospace indistinguishable from the hydrospace of the oceans. 670581.

To prove the design validity of SST flight control and hydraulics systems prior to flight, the systems will be assembled and operated in testing fixtures under simulated operating loads and expected flight environ- ments. Clearance for first flight will depend upon successful demonstration in the testing complex. The program is named CODE (Controls Development), and for the prototype airplane it is divided into two stages. Initially, component problems will be studied in a preliminary fixture using a triple-channel conceptual servo actuator under mechanical and electrical command. This will allow for variation in load inertia, simulated aerodynamic load, and in the ompliance used to represent the flexible airframe. Flutter loads will be generated by an external force servomechanism. Data from the preliminary program will guide design of flight hardware for the prototype airplane. The prototype stage will utilize flight hardware in a fixture which spatially resembles the prototype airplane. Prototype development studies will emphasize dynamics within the hydraulic, flight control, and automatic flight control systems. Interaction effects among these systems will be studied under all expected conditions of dynamic pressure, flutter, and elevated temperature environment.

(P-17) Computer Technique to Evaluate Routing of Fluid System Plumbing for Aircraft Engines. Clarence H. Borgmeyer, United Aircraft Corp., Pratt and Whitney Aircraft In the design of fluid systems plumbing for aircraft engines, the designer is continually challenged by the problem of component location and routing. In order to achieve accessibility and maintainbility, and to avoid physical interferences, plumbing design is accomplished through extensive graphical projection and mockups. The solution to this problem must also satisfy tubing stress limits, resonant frequencies, bracket or clamping positions available and future space requirements. To facilitate and expedite this design procedure a digital computer technique has been developed which determines the clearances between tubing and other engine components. Though not a substitute for graphical projection, this program provides a means for accurate checking for interference. It also serves a valuable purpose in the storage of previous or alternate plumbing routing arrangements for comparison. This computer program is based upon a mathematical representation of the mechanical arrangement of exterior engine components. This paper presents a brief description of the program, a qualitative review of the mathematical techniques involved, and describes the means of integration of the program into the design procedure. A discussion of possible future extensions of this concept is also presented. 670585. (P-17) Evolution of the A-7A Hydraulic Tubing Permanent Joint System. J. R. Crissey, LTV Aerospace Corp.

Correlation of calculated effects of thermal gradients with measured results is presented to verify the design method. SA E Transactions 670588. (P-17) Thermal Problems Peculiar to Cryogens in Space. Marvin Adelberg, Consultant; and Sidney H. Schwartz, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. Thermal problems peculiar to cryogens stored in a reduced gravity environment are discussed, along with some techniques considered for their solution. Included are gravitational effects upon transient and steady state nucleate boiling, heat transfer and temperature fluctuation and meniscus displacement and distortion. To place these problems in proper perspective, a brief survey of the various heat transfer modes is presented. One device, which appears to warrant serious consideration, is the thermodynamic separator and its operation is briefly described. To illustrate the importance of certain problems peculiar to reduced gravity, a number of numerical examples are presented. SA E Transactions 670589. (P-17) Development and Performance of an LH2 Heat Exchanger for Servicing the S-II Stage. Albert E. Otto, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. Assessment of the design requirements for an LH2 heat exchanger to service the Saturn II Stage dictated the need for a more efficient and reliable type of heat exchanger than was known to exist. To accomplish this and also advance thee state- of-the-art of existing concepts, a liquid-to-gas and a counterflow gas-to-gas type heat exchanger utilizing both latent and sensible heat of vaporization of liquid hydrogen were combined into one envelope. A discussion of the design, operation, and the problems of the unit is included. Important conclusions established from the design and performance data on this type of heat exchanger are as follows: 1. Efficiency is improved. 2. Cost of operation is reduced. 3. Physical size is reduced. 4. Flexibility is increased. SA E Transactions 670590. (P-17) Facility for Testing Rocket Engines and Flow System Components in Liquid Fluorine. James R. French and Floyd E. Robinett, TRW, Inc. A liquid fluorine closed flow loop and engine test position has been designed, constructed, and operated for extended periods with very few difficulties. This paper describes the design philosophy of the system and discusses the operation experience gained in rocket engine firings and cold flow operations. Based upon experience with this system, a new attitude toward the handling of fluorine has evolved. Fluorine may now be handled with confidence so long as its peculiar characteristics are considered and respected. In this light, more realistic safety, cleaning, passivation, and testing procedures have been developed. 670591. (P-17) Evolutionnn of Cryogenic Storage Systems toward Advanced Spacecraft Missions. Scott A. Manatt, AiResearch Mfg. Co. The application of cryogenic fluid storage systems to manned spacecraft is considered attractive primarily because of the substantial weight and volume saving afforded compared with high-pressure gaseous storage at ambient temperature. Advanced missions under consideration will require storage capacity for 60 days to one year. Although present design concepts can be used to provide storage for 60- to 90-day missions, the systems become relatively heavy and have limited performance capability. These drawbacks have led to the advanced design concept. A long-mission cryogenic storage vessel has been fabricated and tested. Results of testing indicate that the test unit is capable of a one-year mission, with a mission performance flexibility far beyond the capability of present state-of-the-art designs. The storage concept provides for mass flow rates small enough to provide for minimum metabolic needs of a typical manned mission, or high enough for rapid pressurization of large volumes, while operating isobarically with no parasitic power requirements. Data are presented to show thermodynamic/heat transfer and certain dynamic and environmental testing. In addition, the simplification of manufacture and the mission growth potential of the long-missions storage concept are discussed. 670608. Transient Nature of Wind Gust Effects on an Automobile. F. N. Beauvais, Engineering Staff, Ford Motor Co. This paper describes the investigation carried out to answer whether the forces and moments measured in the wind tunnel under quasi-steady state conditions are representative of the transient period during which a 136</page><page sequence="74">670609-670613 vehicle encounters a wind gust. The experimental facility is described, as are the airstream calibration procedures, the tests performed, and the test results. SAE Transactions 670609. Vehicle-Driver Simulation for a Cross-Wind Disturbance Condition. D. H. Iacovoni, Ford Motor Co. A preliminary investigation to determine the feasibility of mathematically simulating a driver as a control element in the vehicle-driver system is discussed. An artificially produced cross-wind disturbance maneuver was chosen. This simulation was limited in that it used a fixed-control vehicle and did not include the steering system dynamics. In effect, the steering system dynamics were included in the driver simulation. Also, the feedback cues to the driver were limited. Despite these limitations, the investigation showed that it is feasible to achieve some degree of simulation of the driving task for a specific maneuver. By using a free-control vehicle simulation with all the important feedback cues experienced by the driver, and by exploring a larger sampling of drivers with vehicle systems having different response characteristics, it may be possible to arrive at some statistical driver simulation for a given type of maneuver and a given system. Through the use of model-reference adaptive control techniques, the gains and time constants of the driver simulation could be obtained in a more straightforward manner. Using such techniques, it would be possible to derive an understanding of a driver's adaptive capabilities in terms of the time constants and gains of his transfer function and the manner in which he weighs the importance of his various feedback cues for various types of maneuvers and vehicle systems. This knowledge would lead to a fundamental understanding of the driving task and would provide means for optimizing the performance of the vehicle-driver system. SAE Transactions 670610. (P-18) Investigation to Develop Optimum Short-Term Screen Tests for Integrated Circuits. D. A. Cross and W. R. Rumpza, Boeing Co., Launch Systems Technology This paper describes a technique of utilizing life distributions of integrated circuits obtained under high-stress testing to establish reliability screening criteria. The basic factors controlling observable lot behavior, what can be learned from them, and how they dictate a test approach are discussed. Analyzed are the typical life expectancy distributions obtainable from today's devices; what the probable escape rates of defective devices are; how they may be made observable; and finally, how the expected life of accepted devices may be altered by stress screening. The lot behavior analysis will also define the existence of device threshold stress level capabilities from which the screenability of lots can be determined. The philosophies and approach discussed can provide a yard stick with which device manufacturing line control can be monitored as well as provide a basis for selecting an optimum device screening criteria. 670611. (P-18) Predicting Environmental Interaction. Gerald Coren, William Cotliar and David Conroe, Fairchild Hiller Corp., Republic Aviation Div. Ingredients necessary for studying the effects of environmental interactions are presented. A technique for quantitatively predicting the effects of combined environments upon components was developed and applied to test data obtained under controlled conditions. The synergistic effects were equalized as to exposure time and the number of environmental encounters. The data were then statistically analyzed, with the following conclusions: 1 . Combined environments produce a synergistic effect which acts to reduce the overall stress severity imposed upon components by the individual environments. 2. The length of time parts are exposed to a combined environment is more critical to component life than the number of encounters with that environment. 3. Combined environments appear to produce the same effect upon a given component irrespective of the environments concerned in the combination. 4. Different components are affected in different ways by a given combined environment. 670612. (P-18) Relationship of Management to Some Aspects of Reliability during the Athena Program. W. Donovan Schutt, Aerospace Corp., Reentry Systems Div.; and Stanley Schreiber, Aerospace Corp., Weapon Systems Div. Reliability aspects of the Advanced Ballistic Reentry System feasibility programs are covered. A specific example of the Athena program will address booster and data acquisition system reliability improvement. In addition to typical reliability practices, strong management control and examination of the hardware, procedures and design compromises resulted in a continuous reliability growth during the course of the program. The criticality of payloads obtaining good payload test data from very few and expensive flights requires an entirely different approach for the reliability aspects of these systems. Finally, some specific thoughts and techniques employed to achieve the enviable record for this program will be described. 670613. (P-18) Reliability Demonstration during Category II and III Testing. Dean Edgerton, Jr., Hughes Aircraft Co., Missile Systems Div. The objectives of Category II and III test programs, particularly with relation to reliability demonstration, are described. Data are presented and analyzed from the 137</page><page sequence="75">670614-670619 Category II and III tests of two different systems, one a missile, the other an airborne radar fire control system. Examples are given of reliability improvements that were introduced during the Programs, with emphasis on coordination between factory and field. The importance of proper organization and control of the Test Program is discussed, and attendant problems are illustrated. It is concluded that even though limitations exist, Category II and III tests come the closest to allowing the total system to be exercised under operational conditions; and that from the test results, assessments can be made of demonstrated reliability, and significant reliability improvements can be achieved. 670614. (P- 18) Navy Reliability Research. Harold Liebowitz, Navy Dept., Office of Naval Res. Current research programs in reliability being performed by the Navy are reviewed. Primary emphasis is placed on identifying these programs and requirements for achieving a balanced basic research effort in reliability. Areas of interest include mathematical, engineering, behavioral and management sciences. The two principal functions that a sound program in basic reliability research can fulfill are ( 1 ) to increase the emphasis placed upon reliability aspects in relevant scientific research and (2) to provide the fundamental work leading to reliability techniques, methods and knowledge for use across all Naval organizations. 670615. (P-18) Safety Analysis of Statically Indeterminate Trusses. J. T. P. Yao and H. Y. Yeh, New Mexico Univ., Dept. of Civil Engrg. Reliability analysis is formulated for a certain type of statically indeterminate structure with random resistance and subjected to a random load. Specifically, this paper studies the effect of stress redistribution on the reliability of the structural system due to the failure of certain redundant members in an m-member plane truss. In addition, the probabilities of complete survival for structures with different degrees of redundancy were compared on the basis of equal volume of materials used. Numerical examples indicate that (a) for designs with each member carrying the same proportion of load, the failure of one member in a statically indeterminate structure is not necessarily more likely to cause the failure of the whole structural system; (b) for designs with euqual area in each member, the probabilities of complete-survival of statically indeterminate trusses (with the exception of the three-member truss) are greater than those of the statically determinate truss with the same volume; and (c) for the type of structures investigated the statically indeterminate trusses should be designed so that each member has an equal cross- sectional area from the viewpoint of reliability. A third example shows that the effect of the number of members on the probabilities of complete-survival for a parachute-like, three- dimensional structure becomes less pronounced at larger values of volume. 670616. (P-18) Structural Reliability of a Simple Rigid Frame. Masanobu Shinozuka and Masami Hanai, Columbia Univ. With the aid of plastic structural analysis, the reliability (against plastic collapse) of a portal frame subjected to simple loading conditions is analyzed under a number of simplifying assumptions. It is shown that a minimum weight design under specified reliabilities is possible, and that such a design might be compared with the standard deterministic design for better interpretation of safety factors that are now used. 670617. (P-18) Development of Improved Gust Load Criteria for U.S. Air Force Aircraft. William H. Austin, Jr., Air Force Systems Command Improved structural design criteria for gust loads on aircraft are presented, based on the continuous turbulence concept and probabilistic considerations. It is proposed that these improved criteria may replace the heretofore used discrete gust concept. The improved criteria consist of a rational-probability analysis backed up by a design envelope analysis. Both of these analyses are related to the strength level of a previously successful commercial transport and employ power spectral density techniques to establish design values. In conjunction with the rational-probability analysis, an acceptable failure probability is specified, and, for the design envelope analysis, a design limit gust velocity is established. Finally, the turbulence field parameters that may be used for design calculations on new aircraft are specified. 670618. (P-18) Interactionist Models of the Varieties of Human Performance in Complex Work Systems. James J. Keenan, Dunlap and Associates, Inc. The changing, growing, and, hopefully, improving application of the behavioral sciences and related disciplines to the conceptualization, development and use of complex work systems demands adequate con- ceptualization about human performance. A useful framework for understanding the varieties of human performances in the complex system or formal work organization is presented. The approach here is interactionist, structuring human performance along the lines of the principal interactions of the human with the system environment and positing a fundamental "performance grid." Multidimensional models are also discussed as basic to the systematic development of measurable aspects of human performance. 670619. Need for Quantification in Human Factors Engineering. Daniel B. Jones, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. A major problem in human factors engineering is implementing effective human performance consideration into system design; presenting the data in engineering, not psychological, terms. The most usual basic engineering 138</page><page sequence="76">670620-670624 requirement is for information which can be handled in mathematical terms. Mathematical description of human performance is difficult because of the nonlinear and time-varying characteristics of man. The human factors mathematical data needed forr system conceptual phase engineering solutions are generalized models, rule of thumb, or sovereign factors. During the design phase, human task performance, and especially task complexity, should be quantified. During system acquisition phase, operation failure and error analyses must include valid human error probability determination. Methods of meeting these requirements are suggested. 670620. (P- 18) On Managing the Present through Efficient Use of the Past. Robert V. Katter, System Dev. Corp. Managers of complex human factors efforts have the problem of managing their management information. This requires tools for monitoring and assuring both the flow and application of current information to the solutions of technical problems. The challenge posed by the amount and diversity of both information and requirements for information has outstripped the capacity of current methods for handling and managing such information. Some core problems involve lack of between-persons agreement regarding the judgment, evaluation, and characterization of information. There is evidence that behavior-oriented experimental research of the human factors variety can help to solve such core problems. Three examples of such empirical study projects are described. 670621. (P-18) Voyager's Most Challenging System Requirement. B. H. Caldwell, General Elee. Co., Missile and Space Div. Perhaps the most important system requirement for future unmanned space programs like Voyager is "first try success." Responsibility for meeting this requirement will rest on both the government and industry, each of whom must be completely realistic in their approach to the program. General Electric has conducted systematic studies of spacecraft failures and has reached some quit unexpected conclusions concerning them. For example: 1 . One-third of the flight failures were in simple components. 2. Electromechanical components had a failure rate twice that of electronic components. 3. Off-the-shelf components failed almost twice as frequently as those designed specifically for the program in which they were used. (This does not mean that it is not desirable to use mature equipment. It does point out that a component cannot be accepted as adequate simply because it has been used successfully in some other program.) 4. Design deficiencies accounted for about half of all flight failures. 5. Ignorance of the space environment was an insignificant cause of flight failures. 6. Infant mortality (first day failure) was a serious problem. 670622. (P-18) Long Duration Space Missions through Use of In-Flight Maintenance. Haggai Cohen, NASA, Manned Spacecraft Center The background of Apollo Applications Program objectives, moving from 28-day missions to 56 days, to 120 days, and so forth, up to one year, are presented. It will discuss the concept of revisitation and reuse of hardware left in orbit and the recognition of the need for in-flight maintenance for enhancing probability of mission success. The design of the airlock module and multiple docking adapter which is aimed towards ease of module replacement, are presented. The orbital workshop, planned for a late 1968/early 1969 launch, has a programmed set of experiments in the maintenance area, which will try to provide a baseline of astronaut capability in the maintenance area. These experiments are discussed in detail. 670623. (P-18) Air Force System Effectiveness and Reliability Data Systems. Milton Haus and John L. Fuchs, Air Force Dept., Reliability Br.; and Emmanuel Denning and R. H. Schierman, Air Force Dept., Ballistic Systems Div. Two Air Force programs are currently under development for the collection, reduction, storage, analysis and dissemination of reliability, maintainability and other system effectiveness parameter experience data. The System Expeerience Correlation and Analysis Program, being developed by the Ballistic System Division, will provide the means for measuring and monitoring weapon system effectiveness, flagging critical problems, reducing data analysis costs, providing information for tradeoff analysis and an experience retention capability that will enable comparison of weapon systems. The Reliability Analysis Central, being developed by Rome Air Development Center, will be a centralized Air Force clearinghouse for part and device reliability information and experience. It will serve as a ready source of current cumulative reliability knowledge for the engineering and logistic activities of the Air Force and their contractors. 670624. (P-18) PRINCE/ APIC - A Centralized Parts and Materials Information Center for the Reliability Engineer. E. Ray Ritch, Jr., Marshall Space Flight Center, NASA PRINCE/APIC is a parts and materials information center which utilizes a blend of mechanical and electronic methods of data storage and retrieval. The information center was originally organized as PRINCE (Parts Reliability INformation CEnter) in the early sixties to serve the parts information exchange needs of the Saturn Parts Program of Marshall Space Flight Center. In February of 1965 it was also designated 139</page><page sequence="77">670625-670630 as the information center for the NASA Apollo Program (Apollo Parts Information Center); hence the name, PRINCE/APIC. The operations of PRINCE/APIC's Data Input Section, which performs all of its data acquisition and storage functions, and the Inquiry Service, which retrieves and disseminates this data, are described. PRINCE/APIC's storage files and the types of information it has available for the users are discussed, as well as some PRINCE/APIC usage factors. 670625. (P-18) Utilization of Integrated Data Collection and Analysis in Reliability/Maintainability Programs. S. Pollock, Naval Fleet Missile Systems Analysis and Evaluation Group A Navy (Special Projects Office) method is presented of integrating all reliability data obtained from testing, inspection, and trouble and failure reporting by means of an Integrated Data Plan. (The System is fully documented in NAVWEPS OD 29304 "Guide Manual for Reliability Measurement Program" as a derivative of a requirement contained in Military Specification MIL-Q-21549B of 10 June 1963, entitled "Product Quality Program Require- ments for Fleet Ballistic Missile Weapon System Contractors.") Because one of the data inputs to this System is from trouble and failure reports, this paper presents the Special Projects Office Trouble and Failure Report Program (which is less well known outside of the Navy) for the Fleet Ballistic Missile Weapon System to illustrate how data are utilized to enhance the quality/ reliability/maintainability of a weapon system. Data exchanged and utilized through two nationally known programs - the Interagency Data ¬ªExchange Program and the Failure Rate Data Program are also discussed. 670626. (P-18) Chrysler's Quality Data Reporting System. Vincent P. Burns, Chrysler Corp., Car and Truck Assembly Group The Chrysler Quality Data Reporting System is primarily designed to collect information on quality defects reported by line inspectors and report them to the production areas so that corrective action may be taken. Individual input machines throughout the production areas feed data to the computer for processing and reporting. Along with this "Production Oriented" approach to Quality Reporting are the built in Quality Control tools for the analysis, summarization and management type reporting of quality conditions that allows plant management to stay in touch with quality at all times. 670627. (P-18) Intrinsic to Operational Reliability and Maintainability - A Credibility Gap?. Eugene T. Zak, Litton Systems, Inc., Guidance and Controls Systems Div. Nature and magnitude of differences between intrinsic and operational reliability and maintainability character- istics are presented. Relative supplier and user respon- sibility is cited. The difficulty in justifying increased reliability and maintainability is illustrated by means of hypothetical equipment selection. Direct mutual de- pendence of reliability and maintainability is demonstrated. A suggested approach to the reconciliation of intrinsic and operational values consists of recognition of mutual responsibilities of supplier and user, development of a clear conditional frame of reference for intrinsic claims, user, development of a clear conditional frame of reference for intrinsic claims, and application of more effective operational management controls. Data bank requirements for this approach are also established. 670628. (P-18) Reliability Demonstration of Clustered Engines. D. K. Lloyd, TRW, Inc., Systems Group A statistical method for estimating and demonstrating the reliability of clustered liquid rocket engines from development, qualification, production, acceptance, and flight test results of varying durations is described. The method described is an extension of one previously developed for single engines. A worked example is given and management control techniques for assuring data integrity are discussed. The Appendix consists of the mathematical derivation of the system reliability estimates. 670629. (P-18) Use of Entropy in Reliability of Measurements. John DeVelis, Merrimack College; and Haresh Shah, Pennsylvania Univ. The use of entropy concepts in determining the reliability of a given measurement is presented. In particular, the problm of the analysis and report of given data with respect to some quotation of the degree of confidence is considered. Properties of probabilistic entropy are introduced and its application is demonstrated by means of an example. An entropy of a given one-dimensional Gaussian distribution is discussed. Methods presented are general enough so that the same ideas can be extended to other types of distribution. 670630. (P-18) On the Distribution and Prediction of Excess Time. Eginhard J. Muth, General Elee. Co. A system whose components, upon failure, are repaired or replaced is considered. Only two system states, the "operating" state and the "failed" state are distinguished. The time to failure and the time to repair of the system are assumed to be random variables with general distribution functions. A criterion of system worth is the random variable "excess time," denoted by B(t), and defined as the total time the system is down for t units of time spent in the operating state. The following questions are answered in this paper: (a) What is the distribution function of B(t)? (b) What are the moments of B(t)? (c) 140</page><page sequence="78">670631-670635 What is the asymptotic behavior of B(t) for large t? (d) How can one make approximate probability statements about B(t)? It is shown that the gamma distribution is a suitable approximation for the conditional distribution of B(t), given that at least one failure has occurred, and that for t greater than 20 mean failure times the distribution of B(t) is practically normal. 670631. (P-18) Impact of Maintainability Engineering Techniques on the Design of the F-lll. T. E. Smith, General Dynamics Corp., Fort Worth Div. Maintainability technology and controls developed and implemented during early design of the F-lll to ensure the achievement of desirable maintainability goals are discussed. The validity of the approach, which entails determination and prediction of maintainability parame- ters, is verified by actual examples. The major maintainability design decisions applicable to the program are also discussed briefly. 670632. (P-18) Practical Circuit for Integral Majority- Voting Logic Elements. Robert W. Stoffel and John C. Donaldson, Martin Marietta Corp., Denver Div. For spacecraft systems to be designed for the next generation of scientific missions, the system complexity and long life requirements produce reliability criteria which can not be met by either current satellite logic circuitry nor application of redundant sets of such circuitry. A circuit is, therefore, described that is composed of available integrated circuits along with a passive voter circuit and providing majority voting at the logic element level. This circuit is analyzed both from reliability and performance standpoints to show that approximately two to three orders of magnitude improvement in reliability without any significant degradation in performance is realizable. 670633. (P-18) Incipient Failure Detection - Detection of Certain Contaminating Processes. Harvey L. Balderston, Boeing Co. The detection of a specific contaminating process, namely, the reduction of the lead oxide content of the sealing glass around the Kovar leads is the primary subject of this report, but three other destructive processes were shown to be detectable by noise during phase two. It was noted that some of these processes depend upon the CI -ion involvement. These processes have also been observed on printed circuit boards in completed circuitry, and on every soldered joint examined which was exposed to air and moisture. It may be rare that these contaminating processes would be the primary cause of failure in circuits made up of discrete parts, because of the relatively large spacing between wires and the lack of sufficient moisture. It certainly is a different matter with subassemblies made up of integrated circuit or hybrid microcircuit devices with a spacing of leads which approaches 0.005 to 0.03 in. In fact, these contaminating processes could conceivably be a greater source of failure than any other currently known. A very small amount of moisture and a trace of chlorine can cause failure. Accordingly, this matter is being studied further. In addition, specific experiments with regard to the areas of storage, handling, assembly into subassemblies, soldering versus welding, potting, encapsulation, and so forth, of integrated circuits and other microcircuit devices are being made. A controlled experiment has been set up with and without chlorine involvement, with and without solder joints, and with various conformai coatings. The results of this research will be the subject of a second paper. 670634. (P-18) Technique for Reliability Circuit Design Review in Space Electronics. P. J. Franciscovich, International Business Mach. Corp. Design review is becoming a basic requirement during the design and development of military systems to increase the inherent and operational reliability of the systeem. The result of efforts to comply with Paragraph 3.6 of NPC 250-1 Reliability Program Provisions for Space Contractors covers most of this paper. A reliability circuit design review, with emphasis placed on what should be reviewed and the review techniques employed is discussed. The basic circuit design review prerequisites, com- ponent parts and their ratings, are covered, as well as the organization and reviewing of circuits. The review items include worst-case circuit performance, component applications, failure mode analysis, noise rejection, electrical stress, and the determination of component temperatures. The reliability analyst is thus given cognizance of basic design problems and troublesome circuits, and also, aids in formulating a design review program. 670635. (P-18) Reliability of Merchant-Marine Turbine- Gear Propulsion Sets. Duane E. Kimball, General Elee. Co., Generator and Gear Dept. Analysis of 635 set-years of service experience of 147 merchant-marine steam-turbine-gear propulsion sets showed a mean time between failure rate of 23.5 set-years. The sets of one good-sized fleet had three times as large a MTBF as the rest of the sample, a fine return on the more conservative attention paid them. The sample size increased linearly with date. The most satisfactory analysis was as a plot of age-wise cumulatives of failures and service-life. This revealed a significant, short, relatively trouble-free wear-in period, with an MTBF of 9.3 set-years; later service had a 27.6 set-year MTBF. Many failure modes are discussed, and the design and operating practices that minimize them. Much of the favorable MTBF comes from avoiding all but a very little innovation in the design of individual sets. 141</page><page sequence="79">670636-670641 670636. (P-18) Factors Degrading Reliability in the Use Phase. S. J. Kasper, Westinghouse Elee. Corp., Defense and Space Center Review and extension of results from an Electronics Industry Association Reliability (G-41) Committee Task to determine factors degrading reliability in the use phase provide a basis for design improvements. A matrix of potential degradation factors and measures of significance are used in the development of analysis methods to determine optimum correction modes in terms of cost and time. Recommendations include a realistic downtime model and considerations for design analysis to aid in improving use reliability. 670637. (P-18) Relationship between Demonstrated and Operational Reliability. H. Dagen, ARINC Res. Corp.; and R. Saum, Naval Ammunition Depot There is a correlation between Advisory Group for Reliability of Electronic Equipment test results and operational reliability, according to this study, although the developed relationship is based on a relative small number of equipment - all airborne types. However, considerably more operational data will be available in the near future. There is also an indication that operational data covering Air Force equipment recently AGREE-tested will be available soon. It is recommended that additional regression analyses be performed as soon as field results are available on equipments that have recently been AGREE-tested. This will provide a larger data base for deriving relationships of different classes of equipments at different test levels. It would also be advisable to correlate the AGREE and operational test results with estimated (predicted) reliability. This will help to standardize equipment predictions and enable estimates of operational reliability to be made as accurately and as early as possible. 670638. (P-18) Maintainability Demonstration Results and Experience. C. E. Cunningham, Philco-Ford Corp., WDL Div. Sixteen separate maintainability demonstrations have been conducted under various Air Force contracts. All demonstrations were conducted on installed equipments in their final operating locations and environments. The purpose of each demonstration was to determine whether a given subsystem of electronic ground equipment satisfied maintainability time-to-restore requirements imposed in design and procurement specifications. Each subsystem was different, but most of the equipment in each was electronic and was mounted in standard seven-foot racks, in a standard indoor environment. Most of these racks were designed for ready access, and their basic building blocks, the key line-replaceable unit, was usually the circuit board or logic chassis card. For each demonstration, a sample of malfunctions was established statistically to represent the lifetime population of corrective maintenance tasks expected for the given equipment. Methods for duplicating or simulating each malfunction were determined, and the malfunctions were inserted, one at a time, into the installed equipment under as near to operational conditions as could be achieved. In addition to presenting the results of the maintain- ability demonstrations, this paper describes the procedures, controls, and general conduct of maintainability testing. Problems encountered in both field and in plant testing are discussed and maintainability criteria are examined. 670639. (P-18) Problems of Maintaining Equipment Containing Integrated Circuits. Joseph T. Curry and George Smith, II, Boeing Co. Problems of developing and maintaining equipment containing integrated circuits are: (1) processing, (2) fault isolation, and (3) human error. Quantitative study of these problems shows the highest number were experienced during preliminary manufacturing and testing (screening and burn-in), with a decrease during final manufacturing checkout (board assembly and final testing) and a minimum during the system operational period. Maintainability, it is concluded, is still the necessity it was even with the advent of reliable integrated circuits. This is substantiated by the many failures and defects encountered during manufacturing and development phases. Manufacturing economics force the consideration of maintainability in integrated circuit design. 670640. (P-18) Specification Trees - A Tool for Management. Charles K. Murtaugh, General Elee. Co., Reentry Systems Dept. A specification tree is a pictorial presentation of the interrelationship of requirement documents, specifications and standards applicable to a particular program. It should be maintained current and be an integral part of the program design review checkoff. Copies should also be provided to all operations with the classifications as necessary for a given program. As a management tool it: 1. Provides a basis for technical management of hardware and software control. 2. Forms a part of the Program Work Package Structure for Earned Value administration and control. 3. Serves as a ready reference document for procuring agency and contractor personnel. 4. Pictorially portrays the effect of decisions on the configuration and data requirements for the Contract End Items. 670641. (P-18) Maintainability Design Review of the AN/SQS-26CX Sonar System. Vincent C. Iacono, Naval Applied Science Lab.; and Richard J. Morss, Naval Ship Systems Command The procedure followed for the conduct of the Maintainability Design Review of the AN/SQS-26CX Sonar System is discussed. Esoteric techniques utilized, pitfalls to be avoided, and solutions to design review 142</page><page sequence="80">670642-670648 problems are given. A fundamental test point optimization technique is discussed, as well as modifications necessary to apply a standard Maintainability Prediction Technique to a modern complex system in order to utilize it as a design review tool. 670642.

Latest revision is indicated in all instances, but no attempt was made to list supplements or amendments. Department of Defense Index of Specifications and Standards is published annually in three parts (alphabetic, numerical, and listing of Federal Supply Classification following unclassified documents.) 670643. (P-18) Standardized Techniques for the Selection of Hi-Rel Microelectronics. Eugene Slaughter, General Precision, Inc., Kearfott Prod. Div. The use of microelectronic devices in electronic equipment always obviates problems for the design engineer in the design of a compact, light-weight, highly reliable, high-vibration-withstanding and shock-resistant system. Certain of the above descriptive objectives are automatic with the inclusion of microelectronic devices, others are available, at a definite price. This paper deals with the selection of the proper supplier to obtain high quality microelectronic devices through the use of appropriate specifications, military and industrial. 670644. (P-18) Reliability - From Factory to Target. W. L. Hadley, Martin Marietta Corp. The importance to reliability of such factors as vendor selection, parts screening tests, electronic packaging selections, in-process inspection and test, and maintenance by the user, to name a few, is loudly proclaimed, yet accurate quantitative assessment has not been achieved. The data presented in this paper put some of these reliability prediction factors in perspective to show which produce the greatest gains in reliability. The theme is factory-to-target reliability, emphasizing that the practices selected in design, in manufacture, in test, and in operational use have a lasting impact on survival of the products of a company, and, ultimately, on the future of the company. 670645. (P-18) Reliability Models for Dependent Elements Using a Method of Correlations. R. L. Patterson, Florida Univ. To find a way to predict the reliability of a system of interacting elements in which the interaction effects can be accounted for quantitatively and can be estimated from experimentation - such is the purpose of this paper. The models developed are intended to provide a tool for investigating the reliability of systems of elements which interact, thereby affecting their joint condition over a period of time. Interaction effects are quantified in terms of correlations which may be the result of active physical cause mechanisms or which may be present even though the elements are physically independent. 670646. (P-18) Building in Reliability. Charles H. Plyer and William P. Wood, Martin Marietta Corp. Four of the many tasks which make up an in-house process control program are covered. These tasks have special significance in their high payoff in product integrity. Reliability requirements are used to develop quality requirements for process control and a simple method of analysis of in-process data is described. This Reject Pattern Analysis relates the cost of failure to the cost of repair. Data are also presented to prove the need for product burn-in or screening. Both industry and government should take forthright action to implement these improvements more uniformly. 670647. (P-18) Development and Application of a Logistic Simulation Model. Robert O. Black, Pat Shamblin and Thomas E. Diggs, Army Missile Command A Monte Carlo simulation model which simulates operation of a complex logistic system is described. The model was developed for use in the management of low density Army missile systems, but the technique is applicable to other areas as well. The model provides a technique for measuring the effect of changes in reliability, maintainability, and logistic support on system availability. The development, operation, results, and potential application of the model are covered. 670648. (P-18) Application of Maximum Entropy in Estimating the Reliability Functions for Creep Failure Modes of Engineering Materials at High Temperatures. A. B. O. Soboyejo, Pennsylvania Univ. The principle of maximum entropy is used to obtain the prior probability distribution functions for critical creep-strain and creep-rupture characteristics of engi- neering materials, operating at known high temperatures and uniaxial stresses. From the prior distribution function obtained, reliability function which is simply the probability of successful operation of the material, can be derived for specified critical creep-strain and creep-rupture modes of failure. An attempt is made to derive the reliability functions from prior considerations of the mechanics of failure, and the mechanical and physical characteristics of engineering materials. This work assumes that mechanical creep design reliability functions for creep-rupture and critical creep-strain modes of structural elements can have values such that the failure of the elements can occur either by any of the modes of failure or by the assumed combined modes of failure. It is also pointed out that the prior probability distribution functions from which the reliability functions are derived, can be improved by the use of Bayes' theorem in order to 143</page><page sequence="81">670649-670654 obtain a posterior probability distribution function, whenever more creep data are made available. The posterior probability distribution functions can then be used to derive more accurate reliability functions. Finally, these considerations and procedures which yield the reliability design criteria, are illustrated by an application to the stress analysis of a structural member, with given mechanical, physical, environmental and creep characteristics. 670649. (P- 18) Physics of Maintainability. C. M. Ryerson, Hughes Aircraft Co. Physics of Maintainability is an organized scientific approach to the solution of special design-oriented problems in maintenance. The conventional maintenance approaches can be strengthened and provided with adequate tools and techniques for the new challenges being raised by the recent advances in the electronic state-of-the-art. The new field is described and some familiar aspects of maintenance which will be affected by it are discussed. Materials in Design, Aid to Trouble Isolation, Applications to Microelectronics and Implic- ations of Maintenance in Space are discussed. 670650. (P-18) Metallurgical Aspects of Reliability for Small Nitrided Parts. Alfred J. Babecki, Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA Many spacecraft experiments and systems employ drive systems which contain gear trains, slides, rachets, and similar components subject to sliding wear. In order to inhibit wear, some manufacturers employ surface hardening processes, including nitriding. Cases of three such applications are reviewed. One involved rachets made of Nitralloy 135M on a spectrometer grating drive. These rachets suffered excessive embrittlement of the very small (10 mil height) r√§chet teeth. Another case involved Type 416 stainless steel gears in a small motor gear train. These were nitrided by a proprietary process and suffered flaking of the nitriding and chipping of the gear teeth during testing. A third case involved a pinion gear on an infrared scanner which also was made of Nitralloy 135M and nitrided to increase its surface hardness. This gear was subject to flaking of the nitrided case and also breakage of the teeth. In all of these cases, metallographic examinations and microhardness measurements were made. These disclosed that the case hardening operation resulted in an excessively deep hardened zone which rendered the hardened parts extremely brittle. The principles of case hardening, of the internal stresses that are introduced, and of the difficulties of applying the conventional process for large piece parts to the very small piece parts of many spacecraft systems are discussed. Alternate solutions to the wear problem of sliding mechanisms are presented. 670651. (P-18) Planetary Quarantine and Its Challenge to Materials Reliability. E. P. Kozoriz, General Elee. Co., Reentry Systems Dept. The challenge facing the materials engineer in the manufacture of space vehicles where both particulate cleanliness and biological contamination must be rigidly controlled is discussed. Techniques of sterilization are discussed, along with some of the problems which must be considered because of the sterilization requirements. Thermal and chemical environments which will be required place a new burden, and an entirely new reliability history must be obtained. A new technology encompassing microbiology and engineering is developing. The potential benefit of a controlled space exploration program is great. The losses are even greater. The challenge is here - all must be equipped to meet it. 670652. (P-18) Problems In Achieving ILS Requirements through Analysis. Jack F. Witten, Naval Material Command Major problems pertaining to design of an Integrated Logistic Support System are discussed. It is based on seven years of experience in implementing ILS require- ments on a large variety of Navy programs. Problems pertaining to quantification of requirements, including the role of systems analysis, data banks, planning data elements, and sampling of the experience of highly qualified using personnel are explored. Ways to insure development of valid requirements, and how to insure that the requirements are included in basic program documents are described. Future work which must be done to further develop methods and techniques for ILS system design are mapped out. 670653. (P-18) Logistics Development during the Con- ceptual and Contract Definition Phases for USAF Programs. John E. Losee, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc., Advanced Logistics Dev. Increased emphasis has been placed upon the orderly development of integrated logistics support by the Department of Defense through the issuance of DOD Directive 4100.35. This paper investigates and illustrates the development of the quantitative logistics performance parameters related to time, resources, and cost in the Concept Formulation Phase (CFP) and through the Contractual Definition Phase (CDP). Equations- of-relationship are presented which define the iterative elements and their interfaces during the development of time, resources, and cost factor constraints. This interplay is further defined by the presentation of typical "real-world" examples and the methods used to control the quantitative performance elements during CFP and CDP. 670654. (P-18) Personnel Ready. James M. Richards, Lockheed-Georgia Co. This paper emphasizes the point that skilled manpower, ready and available, is an important factor in logistic support. Manpower must be conserved by reducing 144</page><page sequence="82">670655-670659 requirements for manpower through improved reliability and maintainability as well as improved manpower planning. Improved manpower planning is possible only through thorough, well organized system analysis based upon complete and accurate data. It is further necessary that good interdisciplinary understanding exists at the working level between the disciplines which affect logistic support, that is, reliability, maintainability, spares, personnel subsystems, training, and handbooks. These disciplines must recognize the common relationships between their efforts and strive for a common data base and system math models that are sufficiently related so that design changes can reflect influence on all logistic elements and, similarly, changes in one logistic element can be reflected throughout the others. When the time is reached that all personnel requirements are adequately established and the types and quantities of personnel identified, then adequate plans can be developed to assure that the system has "Personnel Ready" so the system can "GO." 670655. (P-18) Inventory Control Models for Logistics Planning and Operational Readiness with Cost Constraints. D. J. Harrahy and M. L. Hinkle, Raytheon Co. It is quite widely acknowledged that a large part of the cost in deploying a weapons system in the field is the cost of spares provisioning. Historically, spares have been provided in a number of ways, not always directly related to the frequency with which things fail and seldom related to minimization of the cost entailed in such procurement. Ways of maximizing the probability of not incurring a system spares shortage under cost constraints, or minimizing cost, while operating under some system spares shortage probability constraint, are reviewed. In the terminology of inventory control systems, there are two different kinds of models in general which one might contemplate using for the usual spares provisioning situations, based upon the needs of the system being deployed. These model categories are: 1 . Static models under risk 2. Dynamic models under risk. Both models are discussed. In general it may be said that static models apply for purposes of sparing initially, or on a "one-shot" basis; and that dynamic models apply when one is contemplating sparing over long periods of weapons system operation. Finally, the paper illustrates when, and under what circumstances, various models should be used. 670656. (P-18) It Is Just the Numbers Game. William F. Blue and A. Howard Kent, Jr., Martin Co. For years reliability has been referred to as "the numbers game", because the numbers do play a significant part in it. However, it is time that engineers in reliability stop taking offense at this reference and proceed to educate various groups in the meaning of the "numbers game" and the many benefits they may derive from proper application of reliability predictions, allocation, analyses, and evaluation. Some of the problems created in design, management, and other areas when reliability principles, techniques, and procedures are not understood are described. Some typical reliability training programs within Martin- Marietta for educating non-reliability personnel are mentioned. In addition to the existing programs, some items that might improve these training programs are included. 670657. (P-18) Standardization, Its Advantages and Problems. R. E. Killion, Radio Corp. of America, Missile and Surface Radar Div. Standardization is a significant factor in achieving cost reduction in design, manufacturing, and field operations. In addition, it contributes to the enhancement of reliability and maintainability. In spite of these advantages it has failed to achieve full acceptance and support. Greater acceptance and support can be realized, with a better understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of standardization. It is within the p√∂wer of the user of standards to minimize some of the faults that exist and thus more fully realize the benefits of standardization. 670658. (P-18) A-7A Aircraft Maintenance Guarantee and the Role of Training. W. C. Gersch, Aerospace Corp., Vought Aeronautics Div. The contract and specifications for the Navy's A-7A Corsair II included a maintenance guarantee which wƒÖs a first in the aerospace industry. As a result, every effort was made to design "ease of maintenance" into the A-7A. The maintenance guarantee would be validated by the Navy during the period of initial squadron formations. An intensive training program was planned to supply trained personnel for the support of initial aircraft deliveries and for participation in the maintenance verification program. Planning, implementation, and problems encountered during the A-7A training program are reviewed. 670659. (P-18) Standards and Education of Reliability Personnel. Paul H. Zorger, Vitro Labs. The practical application of reliability, the need, the personnel, the objectives, and the probability of achieving such objectives are discussed. The probability of achieving reliability objectives from the standpoint of personnel qualifications, recognition of these qualifications, and the specific type of knowledge required of reliability personnel, if objectives and some level or standard of acceptable competence are to be achieved are emphasized. Another objective is the problem of communicating the words "reliability" and "maintainability" to a greater portion of the population. Methods of accomplishing this at various educational levels are also discussed. Basic types of knowledge required of reliability personnel at various levels of competence and applications 145</page><page sequence="83">670660-670666 146 are covered. Personnel "standards" required to achieve the characteristic of reliability in products through a "total" reliability educational program are thus established. 670660. (P- 18) Mission Risk Appraisal. David R. Douglass and Carl R. Austin, Boeing Co., Space Div. A Mission Risk Appraisal technique is presented as an additional system engineering tool. Risk, a major element of technical decision making, is defined as uncertainty and its consequences. The technique defined identifies and quantifies the high risk areas of a mission and provides traceability from cause to effect. The general form of the technique is applicable to many complex endeavors. 670661. (P-18) Risk Assessment in Complex Unattended Aerospace Systems. Anthony M. Smith, General Elee. Co., Missile and Space Div. Various risk assessment techniques for the design and fabrication/test phases of a program are presented. Component reliability assessment, via the standard design reliability techniques and the use of Bayesian Statistics is suggested to be an approach for credible relative measures of equipment risk. A special adaptation of the Monte Carlo technique is suggested as a method for obtaining credible absolute measures of system risk. Reliability trend indicators are also cited as a means of risk appraisal. Several examples are presented to illustrate the use to which these techniques have been applied. 670662. (P-18) Assessing Performance Readiness with the Saturn V Reliability Analysis Model. Kenneth H. Eagle and John J. Reh, Boeing Co., Systems Assurance Data Analysis Group The reliability analysis model for the Saturn V launch vehicle is described. A method of quantitative criticality determination is presented wherein six stage and engine reliability prediction models and their associated Failure Effects Analysis Reports are combined to obtain the basis for criticality determination. The derivation of the criticality equation is also presented. The uses of the Saturn V Reliability Analysis Model, which extend considerably beyond the normal uses of prediction models, include determination of the probabilities of mission success, vehicle survival, and crew survival. The model is further used to assess performance readiness and to identify critical areas requiring management attention. 670663. (P-18) Maintainability Risk Analysis Using the Analytical Maintenance Model. Elmer L. Peterson and Hue B. Loo, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. Use of the analytical maintenance model to perform maintainability risk analyses is described. The procedure developed can be useful for the prediction, assessment, and validation of maintainability. The method presented uses the gamma distribution because of its relative algebraic simplicity. The rationale for this approach is described. 670664. (P-18) Man as a Control Element in Space Systems. Vernon L. Grose, Tustin Inst, of Technology The results of recent research in human engineering which should aid system designers to optimize man's role as a control element in space systems are presented. In particular, five human characteristics necessary for spacecraft control are shown to exceed the capabilities of any known or planned machines. The maximum role of which man is capable should be defined for each particular space system. When this maximum role is known, then trade-offs become possible between human and automatic control. The line of demarcation between men and equipment, known as the man-machine interface, becomes deliberately established rather than drawn accidentally. Reliability is thereby enhanced because man is performing only those functions in which his superiority over equipment is clearly confirmed. Furthermore, the converse also holds - man is excluded from performing functions more reliably executed by machines. 670665. (P-18) Parametric Relationships of Factors Affecting Maintainability of Long Duration Manned Space Flights. H.A. Jennings and E. P. Trott, Boeing Co. There are many parameters which influence the maintainability of long-duration manned space flights. This study involves a detailed investigation of the sensitivity of some of the major parameters on a typical 1975 near earth orbit spacecraft and mission. A mechanized analytical math model and a mission simulation model were utilized to evaluate the effects of: spacecraft system weight, volume and reliability; mission duration and re-supply rate; and maintenance requirements on the total spacecraft requirements to achieve various probabilities of crew survival and mission success. The results obtained to date are given, but specific conclusions will not be made until the study is completed. 670666. (P-18) Case Study - MARCEP Applied to Space Systems. E. P. Trott, Boeing Co., Space Div. There are many problems encountered in taking a mechanized mathematical/logic model from the concept and "toy" problem stage to the production capability stage. The problems encountered in developing the production capability of the Maintainability and Reliability Cost Effectiveness Program technique are indicative of the types of problems that can be expected for any large program of this type. The problem areas can be classified as: (1) Program Logic Problems, which include describing basic system components to ensure logical results, forcing the computer to select redundant configurations which have</page><page sequence="84">670667-670672 been predetermined as necessary, establishing a rationale for investigating crew survival and mission success, and methods of handling components with short wear lives; (2) Computer Limitation Problems, which are identified are capability to calculate large factorial numbers, the calculation of initial system reliability when the system failure rate x mission time is very large, reduction of run times, and core storage limitations. Of the problems discussed, it is shown that most can be corrected or circumvented. The most difficult problems to overcome are those inherent in the computer. Recommendations for necessary state-of-the-art developments are made. 670667. (P-18) AH-56A (AAFSS) Safety Engineering. Robert W. T ewton, Army Bd. for Aviation Accident Res.; and John F. Krey, Lockheed- California Co. The System Safety Engineering Program of the Army AH-56A compound helicopter is described. The three most important aspects of setting up a proper program: the safety organization, control of safety effort, and the personnel requirements - are discussed. An example of the failure-effects method of analysis, which is the method found most suitable for the AH-56A, is given. This example includes all of the worksheets used in conducting the analysis. Both the original design of the example (the fuel system), and the design as changed as a result of conducting the failure-effects analysis are shown. Finally, the quarterly safety reviews held between Lockheed and the Army are discussed. The procedures for conducting the meetings, personnel attending the reviews, as well as the manner in which the Army reviews and supplies their inputs into the safety program, are described. 670668. (P-18) Defining the Safety Mission. Rex B. Gordon, General Elee. Co., Reentry Systems Dept. A fundamental aspect of the system safety engineering concept which requires attention and improvement is that of defining the more subtle safety requirements of a complex system. It is suggested that safety requirements must be presented in measurable terms and expressions if they are to be constantly and effectively incorporated in design. 670669. (P-18) Improving Aerospace System Safety Programs through an Inter-Company Information Exchat ge. L. C. Montgomery, California Inst, of Technology, Jet Propulsion Lab. The aerospace industry can greatly benefit by an inter-company information exchange, with its potential for improvements to system safety programs. There are many methods of exchanging information and many facets to system safety. However, this paper is concerned only with the exchange of incident/accident information. A pilot program for such an exchange has been tried. Its results point the way to improving many system safety programs. It challenges all of the aerospace industry to exploit its benefits. In this regard, the paper (1) indicates to industry the need for this exchange program; (2) lists the benefits available; and (3) recommends a method of implem- entation. 670670. (P-18) Maintainability of Phased Array Radar Systems. A. Hevesh, AVCO Corp. Phased planar array radars represent a class of equipment employing hundreds or thousands of indivi- dually steerable radiating and receiving elements. In the operation of such systems, it is necessary to keep continually ahead of an advancing failure ac- cumulation through maintenance policies geared to replacement-while-in-operation concepts. Several practical maintenance policies, each with certain advantages, are considered: 1. Immediate maintenance 2. Delayed maintenance 3. Cyclic maintenance. The effects of these policies on the outage availability are discussed. Immediate maintenance yields the highest system availability, but requires the continued presence of a moderate size maintenance force. Increasing the number of maintenance crews increases the availability of phased array systems, but the added contribution to satisfactory system states shrinks rapidly with the growth of crews. Delayed and cyclic maintenance both involve a more leisurely, planned work pace characterized by periods of relatively low service activity, followed by periods of intense activity to restore the system. At the expense of some system availability, these policies require only part-time presence of maintenance personnel and may well be the most attractive alternatives for phased array radar systems possessing some degree of surplus performance. 670672. (P-18) Assessment of Ground System Performance and Integration of Reliability and Maintainability with Simulated System Operations. John E. Snyder, Boeing Co. An idealized approach to developing design criteria for a ground support system, assessing the system effectiveness, and improving system design is described. System design starts with mission objectives and performance requirements. As the flight system is designed the assembly, test, and checkout functions are identified. These generate requirements to be satisfied by the ground system. Requirements are allocated to the system elements as design criteria and provide the basis for ground system design and procurement. The system is designed and fabricated to these criteria. Since typical space programs include a very limited number of space vehicles of high cost and complexity, it is important to assess and ensure system performance 147</page><page sequence="85">670673-670679 before the hardware is operational. Computer simulation of system operation, including reliability and maintain- ability, provides a system effectiveness prediction and identifies soft spots so that early remedial action is possible. This approach to requirements and criteria has been applied in part on the Saturn V Program and a simulation of the entire Saturn V activities at the launch pad has been developed. The most significant results achieved to date are discussed. 670673. (P-18) Effects of Maintenance and Support Factors on Availability of Systems. Myron A. Wilson, General Elee. Co., Reentry Systems Dept. The problem of writing valid availability models for complex systems is discussed, together with the problem of maximizing availability as a function of maintenance and support factors. A new graph-theoretic modeling and simulation technique is described, useful for predicting the distribution of system downtime and for enabling trade-offs among design and support variables. 670674. (P-18) Pitfalls in Reliability Predictions. George Ashendorf, Radio Corp. of America Since reliability predictions have become a basis for many decisions in selecting system configurations and investing large sums of money it is essential that there be a full recognition of the potential pitfalls that exist in this activity. The recognition and effort to eliminate these pitfalls must be initiated during the program definition phase and continue unabated through every phase √≥f the program. Each phase of development of a new system is discussed and the pitfalls associated with each task during each of the major phases is considered. 670675. (P-18) Reliability and Maintainability Case Histories. Anthony Coppola and John E. Daveau, Air Force Dept., Rome Air Dev. Center Predicted reliability and maintainability figures of merit are compared to values measured during demonstration tests and those experienced in the field. Five data processing components, two large tracking radars, and four display consoles are considered. Results indicated that reliability predictions are generally conservative, possibly due to improvements in parts between the creation of part failure rate references and their use in new equipment. On the other hand, maintainability predictions were far better than field experience with the same equipment. Demonstration testing of maintainability, however, resulted in a lower test mean-time-to-repair than predicted, for each piece of equipment considered, indicating a weakness in the present procedures of maintainability demonstration by simulation of failures. 670676. (P-18) Reliability Prediction Activities in the Apollo Program. George C. White, Jr. and Catherine D. Hock, NASA, Office of Manned Space Flight This paper discusses reliability prediction, modeling and analysis activities which are taking place in the Apollo program. Reliability modeling and analysis of a typical manned Apollo mission are covered through an example, the switch selector in the S-IVB stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle. Benefits and limitations of the analytical approach are given. It is concluded that prediction activities have benefited the Apollo program, and they have been most useful as consistent tools for designers where complete communication is maintained between engineers performing the analyses and those engaged in designing and t sting the hardware. 670677. (P-18) Reliability Design Analysis for Space Systems. Stuart A. Weisberg, Grumman Aircraft Engrg. Corp. Some of the problems encountered in the design of space systems are discussed, along with some of the approaches, considerations, and analytic tools which may be useful in solving those problems. The techniques and problems discussed are: reliability estimation, weight-reliability tradeoffs, and spares and redundancy considerations. The analytic approaches are representative of the types of analysis available and are used to illustrate some of the techniques which have been satisfactorily used on space programs. 670678. (P-18) Reliability Prediction with Inadequate Data. Paul Gottfried and David W. Weiss, Booz, Allen Applied Res. Inc. Although the accuracy of reliability prediction depends on both mathematical models and available data, the latter most often constitutes the limiting factor. Data inadequacies result in prediction uncertainties. If these uncertainties can be quantified, they need not negate the usefulness of predictions. In fact, quantified uncertainty may aid in the system of configuration selection and in the allocation of further effort. An approach utilizing information from diverse sources to predict reliability and estimate prediction uncertainty is described. 670679. (P-18) On the Question of M Incentive Contracting. Leonard R. Doy on and Kenneth E. Appley, Raytheon Co. The maintainability demonstration methods in vogue today are reviewed. Seriously questioned are the present statistical techniques for reducing maintainability demonstration test data. Sufficient field maintenance data are said to exist to confirm that field times-to-repair of electronic at d electromechanical equipment are best fitted by a log-normal curve; but one can expect the times-to-repair observed during a maintainability demon- stration test to be normally distributed. Therefore, the median-time-to-repair considered is a more suitable 148</page><page sequence="86">670680-670684 maintainability index than the mean-time-to-repair for contracting purposes. The point is made that variations in the observed median-time-to-repair will exist from one demonstration test to another, and from the demonstration test to the field experience, but these variations are more likely due to human factors than to equipment factors. Four causes for these variations are differences in repairmen skills, experience, learning, and motivation. To cope with some of the variations, some coarse correction factors for the demonstration test data are given, even though much more study and development are necessary to achieve the accuracy required for making maintainability incentive contracting practical. 670680. (P-18) Vendor Quality and Reliability Incentive Procurement Program. T. J. Cartin and R. C. Digilio, Westinghouse Elee. Corp., Underseas Div. A pilot incentive procurement program to make it mutually profitable to supplier and buyer to obtain quality and reliability in purchased parts is discussed. An incentive bonus was offered to a vendor to deliver a product which met delivery, quality, and reliability requirements. A vendor could make or lose up to 7 percent of his normal profit. The highest total acceptance rate was obtained, and the company was able to accelerate delivery schedules of the end product. 670681. (P-18) Automatic Reliability Assessment and Analysis System for Spacecraft Automatic Checkout Equipment. H. P. Nicely, Jr., General Elee. Co., Missile and Space Div. An operational, computerized system which produces automatically many tools useful in the reliability and maintainability surveillance of a hardware project is described. Some of the tools, such as the flagging of selected assemblies and components, are especially of value in product improvement studies. Other tools, such as reliability and maintainability trend charts produced on a printer-plotter (each with superimposed predictions), are of value in the comparison of actual performance with expected performance. These tools are used at many levels of assembly, from piece-part to total system. The development of this computerized system was sponsored by NASA specifically for the Acceptance Checkout Equipment for the Apollo Spacecraft. The surveillance and product improvement tools used are, however, of such a generalized nature that they would be applicable in other hardware projects, whether intended for earth or space applications. The computerized system and its application to the Acceptance Checkout Equipment for the Apollo Spacecraft are discussed. Attention is focused on the novel automatic analysis tools which permit the reliability specialist to be freed of the laborious chore of perusing countless statistics. 670682. (P-18) Integrated Reliability Program for Scout Research Vehicle. B. V. Morris and R. C. Welch, Aerospace Corp., Missiles and Space Div. The Scout research vehicle has developed into a highly reliable, efficient, and versatile vehicle, thanks, in good part, to the integrated reliability program described. The program consists mainly of attention to details during design, procurement, and manufacturing. It utilizes additional inspection, testing, investigation of failures, and rechecking of critical components and systems. These activities were pursued during all phases from design through launching. 670683. (P-18) The RAIDS Data System as a Tool of System Safety Engineering. Thomas J. Lebel, Martin Marietta Corp. The RAIDS (Rapid Availability of Information and Data for Safety) System has been established as a solution to the problem of data storage and retrieval in the field of systems safety. Its use is based upon the "real world" of problem solving which is (or should be) the foundation of system safety. The paper calls attention to the fact that many reference tools and specialized publications are used to identify aerospace safety data. Following identification acquisition, technical evaluation of the data is judged vital to the quality and quantity of the collection. The data are then organized according to a logical pattern and processed to be user-oriented. Storage of the data then takes three basic forms, each chosen to form an arrangement suited to the final form of data presentation. Retrieval is accomplished in several distinct manners, each benefiting the type of information and the problem solution required. Design reviews and operational problem solving are shown to be the major and products of various operations, additionally functioning as prime reference sources for future investigations. 670684. (P-18) System Safety - A Quantitative Fallout from Reliability Analysis. J. R. Jordan and R. L. Buchanan, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. A method to quantitatively evaluate the safety of a system by utilizing existing reliability techniques and data is presented. The premise is that crew safety is a special case of system safety. Therefore, the reliability analyses and mathematical models developed to evaluate crew safety are considered applicable to a system safety analysis. System safety is developed as the probability of successfully completing or safely aborting a given operation or test. The relationship and utility of crew safety mathematical models, failure mode-effect analyses, criticality analyses, critical items lists, component failure data, and system effectiveness are discussed. The methodology developed for the display of system safety as a probability is the extension, reorientation, and selective utilization of these techniques and analyses. 149</page><page sequence="87">670685-670689 This is accomplished by (1) extension of these analyses to other than flight systems and/or mission operations, and (2) consideration of a safe abort capability through utilization of operating personnel or automatic sequencing to initiate corrective measures to avert a potentially hazardous situation. The advantages of system safety being developed as a product of an existing technology include maximum utilization of existing procedures, data, and computer programs, resulting in an overall program cost effectiveness. The advantage of system safety being developed as a quantitative figure of merit is its utilization as a parameter of system effectiveness. 670685. The Next Decade for Piston Engines. W. E. Adams and R. V. Kerley, Ethyl Corp. Spark-ignition and compression-ignition piston engines are currently undergoing intense examination as energy conversion devices. Much of this attention has been focused on the contribution of these conventional engines to the air pollution problem. Exhaust emissions will be a major consideration in the design and selection of engines for the future. However, it is believed that evolutionary changes in the conventional piston engines will overcome the exhaust emission problem during the next decade. Changes in the types of engines used for the various applications may occur; if other energy conversion devices prove to be superior for a given application and are economically justified, they will break into the market presently held by our conventional engines. This paper discusses alternate powerplants we believe will be important in the next decade. It includes brief discussions of such energy conversion devices as rotary combustion engines, gas turbines, stratified-charge engines, compound engines, fuel cells, and batteries. The challenges facing the spark-ignition and com- pression-ignition engines are covered in detail, along with estimates of possible changes in engine design or of shifts in the use of types of engines for various applications. The effects that such changes will have on fuel and lubricant requirements are explored. SA E Transactions 670686. Perspective Look at VTOL. L. B. Veno, General Elee. Co., Flight Propulsion Div. Seven varieties of VTOL aircraft are discussed. Basically, the future for all VTOL vehicles hinges on the recognition of the need to select the proper type for a specific role. Particular areas discussed are: lift efficiency, cruise efficiency, maximum speed and range, and hovering capability. Both speed and vertical or near- vertical capability are desirable features that bear a price. Thus, compounding the two will mean very high cost for a high-speed VTOL. Thus the development of the low-speed helicopter necessarily emerged first. Although the evolution of VTOL vehicles has been slow and difficult, progress continues toward the original goal of a safer more effective vehicle for transportation through the air. 670687. Development of the Exhaust Emission Control Device for Toyota Vehicles. Shoichiro Toyoda, Keitaro Nakajima and Tadahide Toda, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. Control of exhaust emissions from automotive engines, with particular reference to the Toyota manifold air injection system developed for the 1968 Toyota vehicle model is discussed. The influence of engine variables on exhaust emissions was investigated under various operating conditions, such as idling, deceleration, and road load. Although some design aids involving engine modification for emission control were devised, the limited time schedule afforded for the necessary development work led to the adoption of a manifold air injection system for the 1968 Toyota model. Its characteristic features and some technical problems experienced during development are described. 670688. Exhaust Emissions from Compact Cars. Ronald E. Kruse and Donald M. Hill, United States Health, Education and Welfare Dept. An analysis and interpretation by the U.S. Public Health Service of the data obtained in a program to determine representative emission levels from imported, domestic, and total compact car populations, as compared to those of standard cars, is presented. The concentrations and mass levels of emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen were measured for a variety of imported and domestic compact cars during operation on the road and on a chassis dynamometer (California 7-mode cycle, hot start).

Grant, California Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Bd. Emission tests on 739 cars (1966 and 1967 models) equipped with exhaust controls in public use confirm that the vehicle manufacturers have done a good job of designing cars with low emissions. However, field data on emissions higher than proving ground results, and deterioration of emissions with mileage, indicate that much more effort is needed awith regard to proper engine adjustments and quality control on the production line as well as better servicing of the engines in the field. Continued effective emission control after initial sale of the new car is the responsibility of the states. Discussion: M. M.

Lee Gustafson, Deere and Co., Engrg. Res. Div. The demand for wood is increasing and the labor supply is decreasing. Capital will be invested by the timber industry for equipment to solve these problems. The equipment industry will face many challenges in developing this equipment: improve mobility; develop economical harvesting processes for unusable timber; develop low cost transportation; combine and/or eliminate operations; program the events cycle; control the environment; and provide safer working conditions. To meet these challenges, good use can be made of recent advances in technology, such as: 1. Mobile machines will need the high power to weight feature of the gas turbine. 2. Added mobility on soft surfaces is offered by the air cushion suspension principle used on ground effects machines. 3. Compressing sawdust or chips into cubes may reduce transportation and handling costs. 4. Side-hill stability can be improved with a self-leveling suspension system. 5. A harvesting machine may be made independent of terrain by supporting it on a huge walking beam carrier. 6. Enclosed operators' stations with interior padding, exterior shielding, and closed circuit television circuits will be needed to provide the needed comfort, safety, and visibility. Of prime importance in the application of technology is a thorough understanding of the silvicultural and economic limits imposed by the local conditions. SAE Transactions 670691. Development of Rubber-Tired Log Stackers. Scott S. Corbett, Jr., Nelson Equip. Co. The handling of logs makes many demands on equipment: tire size, axles, holddown devices, trans- missions, etc. It is only in the last few years that equipment specifically for the logging industry has been developed. This paper describes the slow process from early fork lift trucks adapted for logging to today's specifically designed equipment. Typical examples are given. 670692. History and Development of the Mobile Spar in Logging. J. S. Wilfert, Madill Sales Ltd. The mechanical evolution of the mobile spar is outlined, as well as its economic impact on the industry, in order to make a reasonable forecast of the directin of future mechanical developments and the market potential. In 1950 Berger Engineering built the first portable steel spar. In the ensuing years, three basic design factors have come to stand out as having the most effect on operation and efficiency. In order of importance, they are: the self-aligning double bullseye-type fairlead; type of undercarriage; and the integration of the yarder with the spar and undercarriage. In general, the paper shows that: 1. Economic necessity will force the total conversion of all existing standard rigged trees and yarders to mobile spar units. 2. More sophisticated logging cost analysis will assist in broadening the application of mobile spars and cable logging to areas historically employing other machines and systems. 3. For this same reason a greater standardization of machine and system will be evident compared to the development years of mobile spars. 4. Offshore markets for spars and yarders will increase with the development and growth of forest industries in areas such as Southeast Asia, New Zealand, and the Philippines. 5. The general direction and effort of spar man- ufacturers will be toward smaller, lighter, more mobile, less complex andd easy-to-operate units, with a subsequent reduction in capital cost. 6. A replacement for obsolete units is now developinng. 670693. Applications of the ST6 Gas Turbine Engine. G. Hardy, United Aircraft of Canada Ltd. The 550-shp ST6 turbine engine was adapted for industrial use from the PT6 aero engine. Its performance and operating characteristics make it suited to a wide field of applications. Extensive development and test programs have been conducted on industrial features incorporated into the engine. Experience has been gained in many industrial and marine installations and some of these are dealt with in detail. The engine has shown excellent versatility and durability to date in industrial and marine use. SAE Transactions 670694. Industrial Applications of an 1100 Horsepower Gas Turbine. John H. Myers, International Harvester Co., Solar Div. Applications of the Saturn 1100-hp industrial turbine engine are discussed briefly. The engine is a simple-cycle turbine having an 8-stage axial expansion compressor, 2-stage axial expansion turbine, and a single-stage axial power turbine. A shaft from the power turbine wheel is connected directly or through gearing to the external load, thus providing rotating power at the output shaft. It is available in single- and split-shaft configurations. The applications of this engine are of two types: pre-engineered standard packages and sets, and engines only. The first type includes generator sets, mechanical drive packages, and compressor sets. In the other case, only the engine is sold, which is then installed and connected to the driven equipment by others, as for example, original equipment manufacturers and engineer- constructors. 670695. Gas Turbine Powers - Chipper. Peter Cervenak, Nicholson Mfg. Co. A self-propelled processing plant for converting whole 151</page><page sequence="89">670696-670705 logs into pulp chips is described, with emphasis on the chipper power source. A comparison is made between gas turbine and diesel engines as the prime power for chipping. Application of the turbine engine as related to total plant design, field experience, economics, and customer acceptance is also discussed. 6706%. Application of Mobile Hydrostatic Transmissions. Allan Heinrich, Dynex Co. New concepts and evolutions of existing concepts are occurring at an increasing rate in the field of fluid power transmission. This paper discusses the following specific areas relating to open loop, piston type hydrostatic transmissions: the hydrostatic assist drive, the powered wheel, higher horsepower hydrostatic drives, a new concept in variable pumps, variable displacement motor. With proper application, these developments mean hydrostatic transmissions which are more compact, are easier to apply, are functionally superior, and utilize engine horsepower over a broader vehicle speed range. 670697. Fluids for High-Pressure Industrial Hydraulic Systems. F. J. Hanly, Chevron Res. Co. For industrial (nonaerospace) applications, hydraulic system pressures can be increased to the "high pressure" (2000-5000 psi) or even the "very high pressure" range (5000-10,000 psi) with fluids available currently. Fluid properties that must be considered for high pressure use are: lubricity, antiwear, bulk modulus, cleanliness, vaporization temperature, stability, and seal compatibility. For fire resistance, extreme low temperature and extreme high temperature synthetics are required. High quality, petroleum-base fluids have the greatest number of relative advantages for regular high pressure hydraulic service. Principal among these advantages are: lubricity, antiwear, cost, availability, ease of sealing, and stability. New synthetic fluids are available with unique properties for special applications. Costs relative to petroleum oils range from 5:1 up to over 1000:1. 670698. Hydraulic Components and Circuit of 130,000 Lb Log Stacker. Jack L. Aldred, FWD Wagner, Inc. The log stacker is a high capacity lift truck used in the dry handling of logs at sawmills and reloading sites. Its work operations include handling logs on and off trucks, into and out of storage stacks, and in sorting. This paper describes the largest such vehicle now in existence: the FWD Wagner L-130 Lumber Jack. Described in detail is the hydraulic circuit which provides 475 hp with individual direction of six functions or combinations using all or part of the power available. 670700. 700 H.P. Truck Transport. Vaughn H. Dorsey, Kenworth Motor Truck Co. Significant reduction in the transportation cost per ton mile of bulk products is attainable by the proper adaptation of a truck train transport. Improved haul roads, greater distances, and increased demand for mine products at competitive prices are resulting in a re-evaluation of all cost aspects of material movement. The truck train concept using relatively smaller tires than large pit trucks opens the door to reduced operating costs by lowering cycle times and cost per mile of tires and capital investment. 670701. Automatic Truck Transmission, Its Performance Advantages in On-Off Highway Operation. E. P. Welcher, Allison Div., GMC Fleet owners operating on-off highway trucks are finding that the use of automatic instead of conventional transmissions is one way to improve the performance of their equipment. Performance records of fleet owners operating logging, transit-mix, and refuse trucks equipped with both types of transmissions are examined, compared, and evaluated on the basis of productivity, simplicity of operation, driver training, safety, power train life, and operating cost. Results show that the automatic provides many benefits for the on-off highway type truck and that there is a definite trend toward its use in applications of this kind. 670702. Case for Mechanical Transmissions in On-Off Highway Trucks. N. H. Revenaugh, Dana Corp., Transmission Div. The on-off highway truck must serve two primary purposes. It must be capable of going into adverse terrain to pick up a load and be able to bring the load out to improved private roads or public highways. It must then have relatively high-speed highway capabilities in order to keep round trip time to a minimum. This paper discusses the transmission requirements for this truck and presents a case for selecting a mechanical transmission to serve these purposes. 670704. Data Acquisition Using Punch Paper Tape. H. W. Van Gerpen, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works A punched paper tape system offers a relatively inexpensive and speedy means for recording, reading, and storage of data.

Typical advantages, applications, and mathematics of flueric operational amplifiers are briefly discussed. In that cascaded proportional amplifiers (gain blocks) are the backbone of operational amplifier circuits, their performance is shown. Practical considerations of gain blocks, such as signal-to-noise ratio, frequency response, saturation characteristics, repeatability, and hysteresis, are pointed out. Gain block development breakthroughs achieved during the past two years make operational amplifiers highly practical for fluidic control system design. Examples of operational amplifier test performance are shown; the performance is in excellent agreement with the theory. SAE Transactions 670709. (SP-291) Pli sties Fundamentals. A. A.

Case P-50 Hydra Placer. A. M. Schaible, Case /J. I./ Co. The art of placing concrete through flexible lines, though not new, has developed to a stage where a commercially acceptable machine is economically justified. To develop the art further, the P-50 Hydra Placer has been designed to meet the growing needs of the building trade. This machine is a 40-50 cu yd/hr machine, with capability of placing concrete 600 ft horizontally or 120 ft vertically. The placement power is developed hydraulically by an in-line piston pump mounted directly to the engine. Concrete flow is controlled and directed by four concrete flow valves located in the placement chamber. 153</page><page sequence="91">670718-670726 670718. What Is Human Engineering?. William Wokoun and Sylvester E. Kalen, Army Human Engrg. Labs. Human engineering is based on the premise that since the human being cannot be redesigned, his equipment must be designed around his attributes and his environment. This paper illustrates the importance of human engineering in a simple example of the adding machine, with all the questions which should enter into its design. The goals of human engineering are listed as: easy operation, faster operation, fewer errors, fewer accidents, less complicated requirements for operators, less training, all ultimately resulting in the need for fewer men to do a job. Examples of attaining these goals are given. 670719. Methods of Human Engineering. Richard M. Michaels and Burton W. Stephens, Trans- portation Dept., Federal Highway Admin. Some of the considerations underlying human engineering in systems design are discussed. The emphasis is, first, on how the engineering psychologist looks at human behavior as a basis of designing man-machine systems. Second, the purpose is to define some of the major methods that are employed in human engineering as part of this systems engineering function. 670720. Utility of Human Engineering as Applied to Vehicle Design. Jack W. Dunlap, Dunlap and Associates, Inc. Human engineering has demonstrated its utility in all phases of the design process. Examples illustrating the contributions of human engineering in the conceptual, design, and evaluation phases are discussed. Human engineering techniques are employed to test the feasibility of design concepts involving man-machine interactions. Methodologies and techniques are useful in making direct inputs to the design process during both the design and evaluation phases. 670721. Improving Design Quality with Computers - Harvesting Equipment. Harry Fink, Jr., Deere and Co., John Deere Harvester Wks. An engineering design group can increase its effectiveness by using a computer to solve daily routine problems. Certain requirements of computer hardware and personnel training, however, must first be satisfied. Various basic computer applications which have proved useful to one harvesting equipment design group are presented in this paper. These applications apply to the daily problems of simple tabulation, test data reduction, and design optimization. One of the programs can assist in the design of a three-sheave belt drive. A listing of this program is included to facilitate its use on any computer which has a Fortran compiler. 670722. Instant Transmission Design and Field Test - By Computer. Robert D. Barrett and John O. Nicholson, International Harvester Co. Field performance of tractors with various transmission designs can be determined and compared under identical test conditions. A relatively simple mathematical model of the tractor and implement system provides information like productivity in acres per hour and fuel consumption in gallons per hour. The program provides information for management decision without the costly, time- consuming activity of designing, building, and testing each prototype. 670723. Computer Applications for Suspension and Frame Design of Agricultural Equipment. Robert E. Smith, FMC Corp. A two-part digital computer program is being used to evaluate dynamic responses and internal frame forces and moments to assist the design engineer in the design of agricultural equipment. The designs can be optimized for actual field operating environments at a savings of development costs and time. 670724. Eight Speed Powershift Transmission System for a 14 Cu. Yd. Tractor Scraper. S. P. Nordling and G. D. Rohweder, Caterpillar Tractor Co. A new two-speed converter drive, six-speed mechanical drive transmission was designed for a 14 cu yd tractor scraper to provide an efficient and easily controlled power train. Included with a description of the system is a review of the development history, along with a summary of some new features utilized in this design. 670725. Reliability Evaluation of Transmission Gears. W. E. Schilke, Allison Div., GMC Pitting fatigue of transmission gear teeth, if allowed to progress through continued operation, will result in tooth breakage and loss of drive. Laboratory test gears were run to determine their probability of failure under this mode. It was found that the dispersion or scatter of life values depends upon the gear surface contact stress; thus, there is less scatter at higher stress and, conversely, more scatter at lower stress. A cumulative damage method of evaluating trans- mission duty cycles is presented, with particular application to gear pitting fatigue, in a form adaptable to digital computer calculation. SA E Transactions 670726. Evolution of Power Trains and Steering in High Speed Military Track-Laying Vehicles. Edward Hamparian, Army Tank Automotive Center This paper discusses the historical development of the transmission and power train in high speed military track-laying vehicles. It is apparent that the final design of any power train system for military vehicle application must take into consideration factors such as vehicle performance criteria, vehicle weight class and influence, engine application, and mission profile. Detailed analyses of various power train systems, 154</page><page sequence="92">670727- 670733 such as the X-700, XHM-1500, and HMPT-100, are presented. The basic aim was to shape the new hulls around the smallest practicable power package of engine cooling system, transmission, and steering-brake system. By including the steering and braking in the transmission unit much hull space could be saved, and the space saved could be used for installation of more powerful engines. Based upon a vast background of knowledge developed since World War II, ATAC is maintaining a very high level of effort in assuring that the latest and most advanced drive systems are available for the United States military combat vehicle. 670727. High Speed Power Shifting Transmission for Gas Turbines. Donald J. Fergle, Eaton Yale and Towne Inc. A 300 hp, four speed, forward and reverse, power shifting test box has been designed, fabricated, and tested by the Eaton Yale + Towne Research Center at a rated input speed of 30,000 rpm. The concept incorporates a torque limiting clutch on the input shaft to limit inertia shock loads during shifting, and unique expanding sleeve clutches for changing gear ratios. Expanding clutch material and design were developed through extensive bench testing and computer investigation. A 30,000 rpm, high pressure, controlled leakage rotating seal was developed for the input shaft. Limited experience with the vehicle installation is also discussed. 670728. Mimic Control of Multi-Axis Systems. R. A. Burt and John P. Connolly, Ford Motor Co. A concept for combining the separate manual controls of a multiaxis system was explored and demonstrated on a Ford backhoe. The four axes of the backhoe system receive their command signal from a single 4- deg-of-freedom controller. The motion of the backhoe then "mimics" that of the controller, generating a followup signal to close the control loop. This control system provides simultaneous, coordinated control of all four axes in response to natural movements of the human operator. 670729. Construction and Application of Push-Pull Control Cables. William R. Gostlin and Frank S. Payerle, Morse Controls, Inc. Improved and increasingly complex farm, construction, and industrial machinery demand improved remote control systems. This paper focuses on one element of the mechanical remote control system which is keeping pace with the industry, the push-pull control cable. Recent improvements in material and construction features of push-pull cables make their use in an ever-increasing variety of applications more attractive from the standpoints of cost, ease of installation, durability, and reliability. 670730.

Russ Henke, Milwaukee School of Engineering Potential applications of fluidic devices for the remote control of the following vehicular functions are discussed briefly: engine controls, power train control, steering control, vehicle attitude, control of certain auxiliaries, attachment control. Since little acknowledged work is being done in this area, the applications are discussed in a conjectural tone. 670731. Experience with a Formal Reliability Program. Barrett G. Rich, O. A. Smith and Lee Ko≈ôte, Deere and Co., John Deere Waterloo Tractor Wks. At some point in the development of an organization, the problems of achieving reliability become so great that reliability of product is recognized as a problem of sufficient magnitude to be organized as a separate function. The evolution of a formal reliability program at John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works, the organization and function of all departments in the reliability division, and some accomplishments to date are presented. The total program is discussed, including reliability goal setting, analysis of new and current design, inspection planning, reconciliation of engineering specifications and manufacturing processes, vendor rating, audit and inspection procedures. Emphasis is placed on proved successful procedures. SAE Transactions 670732. Air Filtration for Prime Mover Gas Turbines. H. L. Krewson, General Elee. Co., Flight Propulsion Div. Filtration of mobile turbine engines is shown to be practical. While the environment used in the tests was not particularly severe, it is considered typical of the mining environment. Applications of turbine engines to earth- moving equipment will involve operation in higher concentrations of dust, but experience indicates that this too can be handled. The dirt is generally less abrasive and shorter times between filter cleaning can be tolerated. More frequent replacement of parts is also economically feasible, as the prime competitor of the turbine - the diesel engine - is also adversely affected by the higher dust concentrations. 670733. Development of an Advanced Air Cleaner Concept for Army Vehicular Gas Turbines. Lionel J. DuRocher, Army Tank Automotive Command; and Hugo Giannotti, Giannotti Associates The requirements for Army vehicular gas turbines are reviewed and various concepts are compared.

The application of TCA to the development of a gear set is demonstrated. Also described is the use of TCA to study the effects of various design parameters on the tooth contact pattern, with particular emphasis on the choice of cutter diameter. 670736. Hydraulic Fluidics. C. K. Taft, New Hampshire Univ. Basic fluid elements are described. Sequential fluidic circuits using gases as the working fluid are being employed in machine tools and many other applications; circuits using hydraulic fluids or other liquids have not been as highly developed. The primary problems appear to be lower operating speed, higher power losses, and entrapped air. There still appear to be many advantages in using hydraulic fluidics to replace systems involving many moving parts. Hydraulic fluidic feedback control systems would offer even greater advantages in cost and reliability. 670737. Electro-Hydraulic Servo-Valve - Applications in Construction Machinery. Edwin O.

Design Considerations when Applying Hydraulic Drives to Vehicles. Melvin M. Hann, Sundstrand Hydro-T ransmission Early attempts to apply hydrostatic transmissions to vehicle propulsion resulted in enthusiasm for the basic concept but disappointment in its execution. More importantly, the cost was too high. This paper discusses how advances in the state-of-the-art and basic research, coupled with an engineering approach closely geared to manufacturing, has resulted in a reliable, low cost, and high-performance transmission. This paper will outline key factors in the successful application of a hydrostatic transmission. 670741. Hydraulic Drives in Forage Harvesting. William A. Arnold, Lowe Machine Co. Three hydraulic circuits for forage harvesting equipment are discussed: engine driven pump circuit, header and chopper feed drive, and hydrostatic traction drive. All drives are on current production models of Lowe harvesters. It has been found that the flexibility offered means added performance and production, easier machine control, and reduced maintenance. Details and advantages of each circuit are outlined. 670742. Hydraulic Systems for Grain Harvesting. E. J. Krukow, International Harvester Co., Farm Equip. Div.

B. Burkett, McCulloch Corp. After 18 years of development, a satisfactory electric starter for chain saws has been produced. It consists of a starter-generator, combined with a 12-v nickel-cadmium battery, to give the necessary high-speed cranking. Both starter-generator and battery had to be specially developed to meet strict requirements of compactness, light weight, and independence from an external power source. The use of a solid-state regulator allows these batteries to be recharged very rapidly, compared with the normal 14-20 hr recharging time. A continuous charge is applied for 3 min, followed by 6-8 min of pulse charging, all at a 4-6-amp rate. Discussion: John R. Dwyer, Jr.; Outboard Marine Corp.; W. O.

Because of the size and weight of the various components going into the machine, new approaches were used to solve the practical limitations of manufacturing facilities, shipping clearances, and erection procedures. Although the general appearance of the machine is similar to previous units, there are a number of new design features incorporated in the unit. This paper will be limited to the major design considerations as follows: adaptation to stripping two seams of coal simultaneously; dipper with two doors; computerized hydraulic steering maintaining Ackerman correction; double end drive crawlers and belt tensioning; and electrical innovations. 670746. Development and Manufacture of a 220 Cu Yd Walking Dragline. T. Learmont, Bucyrus-Erie Co. The surface mining machine discussed will dig through areas up to 160 ft deep. A dragline was selected for this application after considerable study of the relative merits of shovels and draglines; and a single large machine was selected in preference to two smaller units. The machine features hydraulic walking equipment of a new design. Horsepowers and pulls on the drag and hoist machinery are larger than on any draglines currently in operation. Six motor-generator sets convert 13800-v incoming a-c power to d-c power with thyristor control. The boom is subjected to a combination of primary and secondary loads and required special design treatment. 670747. Technical Data Package for Procurement of Military Design Equipment. Harold H. Gillespie and Ralph E. Armbruster, Army Mobility Equipment Command The military Technical Data Package is the vehicle for communicating fixed price competitive procurement requirements between Government and industry for the manufacture of military design equipment. The necessity for complete understanding of the content, the controls invoked, and the Government philosophies behind the various elements is essential to interested potential manufacturers. This paper defines the package elements, discusses the industrial application of the data, indicates trouble areas, and defines the terminology. The conclusion of the Technical Data Package concept is the material advantages to industry and government. The broader supply base results in open competitive sources of supply, more sources of supply, greater interchangeability of parts and a greatly simplified logistics problem of procurement and inventory stocking. 670748. Government Engineering Role during the Procure- ment of Military Equipment. Turner G. Timberlake and Chester R. Gurski, Army Mobility Equipment Command The government engineering role during quantity procurement of various types of machinery is defined, in an attempt to point out areas in which suppliers often run into problems when on fixed price contracts. Outlined are contrasting operational objectives of the military as opposed to most industry operational objectives. When adapting a commercial item to meet specific military needs, specifications are expressed in requirement- type terminology. Another factor to be considered by contractors is drawings which provide design data and ignore process data. Possible problem areas are insufficient material allowance for processing, inaccurate transfer of dimensions, substitution of materials and inaccurate conversion from military standards to supplier practices. No contractor should commit himself until all questionable engineering requirements of a quantity procurement contract have been clarified to eliminate all misunderstanding. 157</page><page sequence="95">670749-670805 670749. Orboresonance, A New Mechanical Elastic-Circuit System which Has Significant Usefulness in Earth Working Equipment. A. G. Bodine, Bodine Soundrive Co. A new earth working technique has been developed as an outgrowth of experiments in sonic power transmission, whereby a tool combination having an elastic resonance is set against the resistance of earthen material, much as an electronic power circuit deals with its load. An essential element in this, for accomplishment of maximum performance, is the provision of a unique type of mechanical oscillator which automatically uses "feedback" from the resonator. Use of curcuit concepts in the design of sonic equipment results in very simple, reliable, and rugged mechanisms. Typical ones are applied in earthmoving machinery. These design concepts also have a surprising degree of operational simplicity. 670750. Model of Vibratory Soil Cutting. R. J. Boyd and C. L. Nale≈ºny, Bell Telephone Labs. A lumped parameter model consisting of a spring and coulomb friction is developed to simulate soil cutting by a plow blade vibrating horizontally. The spring represents blade and soil elasticity; the coulomb friction represents soil strength. Predicted instantaneous and average forces agree favorably with those obtained experimentally for a sinusoidally vibrating blade in a compacted silty sand. Results indicate that, for a given cutting speed, average force can be reduced by increasing frequency, displacement amplitude, and/or system stiffness. For practical design values f these parameters, the force can be reduced to 25 percent of the nonvibrating cutting force. Further reductions can be achieved only by large increases in the parameters. SAE Transactions 670751. Comparison of Vibratory Soil Compaction with other Field Methods. E. T. Selig, Illinois Inst, of Technology Res. Inst. Full scale field tests on soil compaction were undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of various methods of achieving compaction and to examine techniques for compaction control. The test variables included type of soil, moisture content, lift thickness, type of compactor, compactive effort, and number of roller coverages. Vibratory, pneumatic, segmented pad, and sheepsfoot rollers were investigated. Measurements of soil strength and density were made after a prescribed number of roller coverages. A comparison of results between the vibratory method and the other methods was made to provide insight into the role of vibration in compaction. The basic concepts of vibratory compaction are also discussed. SAE Transactions 670802. New Approaches to Industrial Hygiene in Beryllium Fabrication. Don L. Hedges, North American Rockwell Corp. The toxic properties of beryllium have been known for many years. New developments in the fields of industrial hygiene and manufacturing have greatly reduced the hazard in fabrication of beryllium components. These new methods of control have also reduced the cost of process control. This paper describes the techniques used by North American Rockwell to control the toxic effects of fabricating beryllium. Also discussed are the medical controls. 670803. Fabrication Techniques of Beryllium Metal Removal. G. Raymond Paul, Speedring Corp. Familiarity with beryllium metal machining and handling characteristics places the material in favorable perspective with conventional materials. The stability, coefficient of expansion, and thermal conductivity of beryllium are very favorable to achieving and maintaining size control. Extensive use in the aerospace industry has assisted in development of allied processes that further enhance the achievements in fabrication techniques. This paper shows the evolution of fabrication considerations from procurement through completion of parts. Interim processes and surface treatments are discussed, as well as some applications. 670804. Forming and Mechanical Joining Criteria for Beryllium Structures. S. E. Ingels and W. H. Kinney, Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co. The deformation and mechanical joining of beryllium and beryllium-aluminum alloys is discussed with respect to a typical aero-space structure utilizing normal cross-rolled sheet, characterized by a maximum BeO content of 2.0 percent, ingot sheet rolled directly from high purity cast billets, and 62 percent beryllium - 38 percent aluminum alloy. Selection and application of material types is determined on the basis of mechanical properties, manufacturing considerations, and availability. Surface imperfections induced by manufacturing procedures are shown to be greatly reduced or eliminated by proper stress relief and etching. Examples of simple unidirectional bends and complex forming, requiring severe multidirectional material flow, are given. Mechanical joints resulting in net tension values equal to the yield strength of the beryllium are shown to be possible with proper choice of fasteners and joint geometry. It is, therefore, concluded that highly efficient, optimum weight beryllium structure can be achieved using presently available materials and manufacturing capability. SAE Transactions 670805. Beryllium Brazing Technology. George D. Cremer, James R. Woodward and Larry A. Grant, International Harvester Co., Solar Div. The use of braze-joining to extend the practical utilization of beryllium in the fabrication of lightweight, exceptionally stiff components is described. Practical consideration of structural beryllium 158</page><page sequence="96">670806-670810 brazements is discussed, using monocoque cylindrical and conical shapes, radiator assemblies, sheet metal brackets, and sandwich structures as examples. Beryllium, as a material of construction, exhibits attractive properties up to at least 1200 F. However, due to its metallurgical and mechanical peculiarities, special fabrication techniques are necessary. These are discussed with particular reference to the SNAP-27 beryllium radiator/housing assembly. Consideration is given to joining hot pressed block to wrought sheet and the unique requirement of hermetic sealing beryllium to stainless steel for sustained operation at 525 F. Data show the effect of filler metal interactions on the stress levels attainable in properly brazed jbints. Braze alloys include sterling silver, silver-copper eutectic, and aluminum-silicon. Other test specimen results related to beryllium joining include: shear strength, tension, yield, elongation, and thermal exposure. SAE Transactions 670806. Solvent Control - A National Problem. S. Smith Griswold, Department of Health, Education and Welfare The Federal Government and, for that matter, the entire country have a great interest in the impact of Rule 66. This rule of the Los Angeles County Air Pollution Control District is meant to eliminate the emission of the most reactive hydrocarbons of organic solvents. It allows the emission only of solvents of such low reactivity that they do not contribute significantly to the formation of smog. The particular government agencies involved are the Department of Defense and the General Services Administration. Both these agencies develop Federal specifications for paints, varnishes, thinners, lacquers, and the like, that are based not on air pollution prevention criteria but on performance, durability, and reliability. In addition, Federal agency activities are subject to control under an executive order of the president, which calls for abatement of air pollution from Federal facilities. Moreover, as time goes on, more and more localities will develop their own restrictions. The chaotic situation that may develop, with all the requirements for additional testing, point to the need for a uniform approach to the problem in helping to find an equitable solution. 670807. Rule 66 - A Part of Total Air Pollution Control. Warren M. Dorn, Los Angeles County, Bd. of Supervisors The part Rule 66 plays in total air pollution control in Los Angeles County is explained. This rule of the Los Angeles County Air Pollution Control District is meant to eliminate the emission of the most reactive hydrocarbons of organic solvents. It allows the emission only of solvents of such low reactivity that they do not contribute significantly to the formation of smog. Background material on the control of visible emissions, sulfur, hydrocarbons, and motor vehicle emissions is also presented. Finally, the background and acceptance of Rule 66 is described. 670808. Need for Rule 66 in Los Angeles County. Louis J. Fuller, Los Angeles County, Air Pollution Control District The need for Rule 66 and how industry has moved promptly and creatively to meet it are discussed. This rule of the Los Angeles County Air Pollution Control District is meant to eliminate the emission of the most reactive hydrocarbons of organic solvents. It allows the emission only of solvents of such low reactivity that they do not contribute significantly to the formation of smog. 670809. Photochemical Reactivity of Solvents. Walter J. Hamming, Los Angeles County, Air Pollution Control District The increasingly obvious need for an appraisal of the potential contribution of organic solvent usage to the photochemical smog problem in Los Angeles County was confirmed by the results of surveys to determine the kinds and quantities of solvents used. The need for control of emissions resulting from various uses of organic solvents could be determined only by investigation and evaluation of the relative photochemical reactivity of such emissions. The studies and criteria utilized to assess both such needs are described, as well as the approach used to translate the results of the studies into a functional, purposeful rule for the control of organic solvent emissions, namely Rule 66. This rule of the Los Angeles County Air Pollution Control District is meant to eliminate the emission of the most reactive hydrocarbons of organic solvents. It allows the emission only of solvents of such low reactivity that they do not contribute significantly to the formation of smog. SAE Transactions 670810. Complying with Solvent Control Legislation. Robert G. Lunche, Los Angeles County, Air Pollution Control District Treatment of the organic emissions resulting from solvent usage, converting to less photochemically reactive solvents, or changing the process can result in compliance with Rule 66. This rule of the Los Angeles County Air Pollution Control District is meant to eliminate the emission of the most reactive hydrocarbons of organic solvents. It allows the emission only of solvents of such low reactivity that they do not contribute significantly to the formulation of smog. An engineering permit system and an enforcement inspection program ensure that control equipment to treat the effluent is designed for the required efficiency and operated in compliance with the law. 159</page><page sequence="97">670811-670815 670811. Impact of Rule 66 upon Industry. W. J. Ryan, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. Rule 66 was developed with the full cooperation of industry, which worked through such organizations as the Aerospace Industries Association and the California Manufacturers Association. This rule of the Los Angeles County Air Pollution Control District is meant to eliminate the emission of the most reactive hydrocarbons or organic solvents. It allows the emission only of solvents of such low reactivity that they do not contribute significantly to the formation of smog. One of the problems faced by the aircraft industry in conforming with the rule was the additional need to meet military specifications. Before the final rule was developed, committees were formed of the groups involved, which led to suggested modifications of the proposed rule. So successful was this technique that when the final rule was presented to the Board of Supervisors, there was no opposition from individuals or industry. The aircraft companies did, however, face a gigantic task in meeting it. Douglas, for example, formed Task Forces to keep all groups of the company informed of developments and make sure that production ran smoothly. Many changes were required. For example, all degreasers had to be changed from trichloroethylene to 1-1-1- trichlorethane and equipment renovated. 670812. Cost-Performance Summary of Air Pollution Control Equipment Used for Rule 66 Compliance. J. G. Hayes, American Can Co. The parameters of time, temperature and turbulence affect the efficiency of incinerators in the control of organic solvent emissions from stationary equipment, as required by Rule 66. This rule of the Los Angeles County Air Pollution Control District is meant to eliminate the emission of the most reactive hydrocarbons of organic solvents. It allows the emission only of solvents of such low reactivity that they do not contribute significantly to the formation of smog. Fuel costs are a problem, however, on which more data are needed. For example, for a large incinerator with no heat recovery features, the installed cost may be as low as one dollar and seventy-five cents/cfm for a 23,000 cfm unit with a fuel cost as low as twenty-three dollars/hr. A small unit without heat recovery but using no external combustion air might cost eleven dollars/cfm. The cost of equipment and operation is directly proportional to the exhaust volume to be handled. 67081 3. Development of Rule 66 Complying Solvents. H. E. Sipple, Shell Chemical Co. Solvent manufacturers are making a major effort to develop materials that are exempt from Rule 66. This rule of the Los Angeles County Air Pollution Control District is meant to eliminate the emission of the most reactive hydrocarbons of organic solvents. It allows the emission only of solvents of such low reactivity that they do not contribute significantly to the formation of smog. The basic problem is to achieve maximum solvent power within the compositional limits of the rule. This means minimum aromatics, mafimum naphthenes, and suitable polar compounds. Ex mpt mineral spirits and VM + P naphthas are commercially available. High solvency naphthenic base stock helps offset the solvency of displaced aromatics. These exempt solvents appear to be entirely adequate for long and medium oil alkyd resins. Where greater solvency is needed, as with short oil alkyds, vinyls, epoxies, and the like, polar compounds such as alcohols, esters, ketones, and nitroparaffins, have been incorporated in the solvents. Architectural coatings are being successfully formulated with the exempt solvents with little, if any, solvent cost increase. Most industrial coatings have been prepared with exempt solvents and initially appear to be performing satisfactorily; however, solvent cost will increase approximately 50- to 300-percent. Many specialized industrial coatings are still being reformulated. 670814. Availability and Evaluation of Non-Photo- chemically Reactive Primers and Topcoats for Aerospace Applications. J. C. George and G. R. Morris, Lockheed-California Co. New coatings with low smog producing potential, as required by Rule 66, have been and are continuing to be evaluated for use in the aerospace industry. This rule of the Los Angeles County Air Pollution Control District is meant to eliminate the emission of the most reactive hydrocarbons of organic solvents. It allows the emission only of solvents of such low reactivity that they do not contribute significantly to the formation of smog. These new coatings have been proved in laboratory and shop testing to be equal in quality to the conventional coatings they are replacing. Environmental exposure tests to date are satisfactory and are continuing. However, difficulty has been encountered in obtaining consistent quality in large production batches. Some of the new coatings contain solvents that are slightly more toxic. Also, some of the modified coatings have lower flash points. These new materials, which include both proprietary and military coatings, appear to be readily available. Coating costs of the new materials generally are higher, but vary from a reduction of approximately 7 percent to an increase of 35 percent. 670815. Effect of Los Angeles County Air Pollution Control District Rule 66 on Cleaning and Degreasing Operations. Rae E. Houke, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. There are three general methods of complying with Rule 66 (this rule of the Los Angeles County Air Pollution Control District is meant to eliminate the emission of the most reactive hydrocarbons of organic solvents. It allows the emission only of solvents of such low reactivity that they do not contribute significantly to the formation of smog) or with similar legislation relating to vapor degreasing and cleaning operations. These methods are 160</page><page sequence="98">670816-670826 the installation of vapor emission control devices, the substitution of exempt solvents, and the substitution of an alternate cleaning or degreasing method. The installation of control devices will require high acquisition and operating costs. According to equipment manufacturers' claims, savings from the recovery of solvent should partially compensate for the equipment's cost. The substitution of an exempt solvent appears to be the most economical method of compliance, in that little or no equipment changes may be required and no change in operating methods will be required. The substitution of an alternate cleaning method would be suitable for general cleaning, but would not be recommended for parts that are to undergo coating or further surface treatment. SA E Transactions 670816. Southern California Aerospace Industry's Program To Control Smog Produced by Chemical Milling Maskants and Shop Protective Coatings. Q. H. Coffman, Northrop Corp., Norair Div. Chemical milling maskants and hand-peelable shop protective coatings which comply with Rule 66 of the Los Angeles County Air Pollution Control District and are used by the aerospace industry in Southern California are discussed. The maskants were evaluated to determine the material best suited under Rule 66 to perform chemical milling, and the shop protective coatings were evaluated to determine the material best suited for protecting metal surfaces during fabrication, adhesive bonding, and assembly operations. 670817. Flexibility, Economy, and Imagination with E.D.M. Thomas J. O'Connor, Easco-Sparcatron, Inc. The purpose of this paper is to stimulate the imagination of the engineer to the great flexibility and potentials that lie in Electrical Discharge Machining by: 1. Introducing him to a few of the many attachments and motions of machining that are now available to the industry. 2. Showing him how these quick-change tooling attachments apply to prototype or long-run production machining. 3. Erasing the general concept that electrical discharge machining is only a last-ditch approach to performing a difficult production machining operation. 670818. New Concepts for E.C.M. Victor D. Myerly, Cincinnati-Heald Although electrochemical machining has been available for only about ten years, it is being used to good advantage for many difficult machining operations, where machinability and geometry pose difficult problems. The new concepts of better control, more accurate and reliable machines, coupled with higher amperage power supplies, are now putting this process on a competitive basis with normal milling operations. Manufacturers now offer not only initial installation and training in the customer's plant but also hold periodic formal training seminars and make tooling manuals available. 670822. Compatibility Considerations for Metal-Matrix Composites. W. A. Comp ton and K. P- Steward, International Harvester Co., Solar Div. Research on metal-matrix composites for turbine compressors has demonstrated that four areas of compatibility are very important in composite design, and all must be considered in detail when specifying metal-matrix composites for structural applications. These areas comprise: chemical compatibility between matrix and filament, elastic strain compatibility, physical property compatibility, and manufacturing process compatibility. The designer must have detailed knowledge of every step in the composite manufacturing process to predict structural performance. Control of the man- ufacturing process to achieve maximum reinforcement from the filaments is considered the most important single factor. Asymmetrical elastic properties introduced by residual stresses or area ratio variation appear to be the most difficult aspect to appraise. A result of such asymmetry is dimensional and structural instability in a changing temperature environment. SA E Transactions 670825. Maintaining the Cleanliness of Clean Parts. R. C. Libby and F. T. Oliveri, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. Procedures used by Douglas Aircraft Co. in maintaining the cleanliness of parts that have been cleaned and packaged in a clean room are described. Specific procedures are discussed for liquid propellant and hydraulic systems and spacecraft interiors. The methods described are used mainly for the protection of parts with particles no larger than 100 microns. 670826. V/STOL and Short-Haul Commercial Require- ments. Clifton F. von Kann, Air Transport Association of America Several aspects of V/STOLs for short-haul transportation are considered: production time needed to produce a craft with suitable operational characteristics, profitable operation, noise, safety and reliability, air traffic system control, landing facilities, passenger comfort, market- ability, size. The author urges that a joint effort by military and civilian departments of the government and industry be undertaken to develop a V/STOL transport system. Factors to be considered are discussed. 161</page><page sequence="99">670827-670834 670827. Short Haul Military Requirements (1970-1980) - A Qualitative Estimate of Aircraft Criteria. Robert K. Meister, Stanford Res. Inst. A typical military short-haul airlift situation is postulated for the 1970-1980 period. Based on this generalized picture of operational requirements, criteria are developed qualitatively with respect to the principal characteristics of a mixed fleet of advanced V/STOL short-haul aircraft to support the postulated airlift operation. 670828. Getting There from Here - Discussion of Surface Transportation Problems at the Los Angeles International Airport in the Age of the SST. Richard K. Bowler, Automobile Club of Southern California The examination of ground transportation conditions at the Los Angeles International Airport suggests that, while there is still some potential street and freeway capacity left, future problems may arise. This can be largely attributed to drastically revised projections of passenger traffic, apparently due to the expectations of increased travel because of the SST and the so-called jumbo jets. Ground transportation capacity now appears to be the most limiting capacity problem to future airport planning. The external road system, which is largely beyond the control of the Los Angeles Department of Airports, presents the most serious problem and alternative means must be found to either decentralize departing flights or to bring arriving passengers to the airport by other means. The Department of Airports proposes a system of satellite airports and metroports utilizing flying buses or VTOL/STOL aircraft to collect and distribute passengers around the metroport area. The key to making this system work might be the installation of a uniform fare structure for all arriving and departing passengers regardless of the location of the airport or metroport that he wishes to use. SAE Transactions 670830. Short-Haul Compound Transport and Its Place in Interurban Transportation. Norman E. Nelson, Lockheed-California Co. A new type of rotary wing aircraft, the compound aircraft, is currently in development for the armed services. This new method of VTOL flight appears to offer great promise to the commercial VTOL field, particularly as it applies to the interurban mass transportation problem. It has been apparent for some years that fixed wing aircraft, due to airport congestion both in the air and on the ground, cannot fill this requirement. The possibilities of this new type of aircraft in this environment are discussed. 670831. Challenge in Engineering Management. Charles E. Hirsch, Philco-Ford Corp. Some of the tools and techniques that engineering management can provide for its engineers, so as to help them design better products at lower cost are discussed briefly, for example: 1 . Controlled criteria documents that contain per- formance and design criteria, based on the customer's requirements. These documents are to be changed only as a result of changing customer's requirements, or for other good reason. 2. From analysis to final design phases, controlled preliminary design or design assembly or assembly layout drawings, which must be kept accurate and current. 3. Engineering schedules that are paced to the project schedule. These are needed at all appropriate levels and for all affected engineering organizations to define the time frame for their activities to interface and integrate with other organizations. 4. Manuals that set forth configuration management and design, drafting, material, and parts and components standards. These manuals must be properly prepared, used religiously, and kept up to date at all costs. 670832. Control of Engineering Costs and Contract Definition. E. R. Moyes, McDonnell Douglas Corp. Negotiated price of a defense contract indicates the quality /risk level at which engineering must perform. This article describes a method for controlling engineering to the proper quality to insure a profit. It includes a discussion of engineering task breakdown, task cost estimating, scheduling, and status reporting. 670833. Dilemma of Technical Obsolescence. J. D. Boulgarides and V. C. San Filippo, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. Technical obsolescence of engineers and scientists is defined and discussed. The knowledge explosion in general terms, and in specific areas is examined. The impacting force of the knowledge explosion is considered in terms of organizations and individuals. An approach to assessing the impact of the knowledge explosion is proposed. The responsibility for positive action to avoid technical obsolescence is discussed. The scope of this paper is restricted to the technical obsolescence of engineers and scientists, and does not concern itself with equipment and facilities. 670834. Castles, Management, and Schizophrenia in Engineering. C. Wilson Whitston, consulting engineer The interfaces of engineering and management offer an insight into why the engineer, when viewed as in his castle, avoiding constraints, seems out of contact with the facts of business life. His sharing in the benefits and yields, while shunning a full measure of responsibility, appears less than glamourous in final, depersonalized analysis. A view of the engineer as manager, judicious scheduler, and user of resources after regressive analysis 162</page><page sequence="100">670835-670840 of professional antecedents and future expectations; the engineer as participant, delineator, and communicator; as active in the art and science of management as well as in design, innovation, and research, can be projected as faces of an attainable value, with enhanced professional esteem. 670835. Managing Engineering for Profit in the Aerospace Industry. J. F. McCarthy, Jr. and F. A. Aschenbrenner, North Amer. Aviation, Inc., Space Div. Management of engineering for profit is examined from the establishment of company objectives in the advanced planning stage through the planning and control of major programs. Five major areas are discussed: advanced program planning, managing small projects, developing the engineering processes leading to integrated major program plans, controlling the engineering effort, and managing the engineering rates. These five areas range from highly creative concepts to detailed control techniques. Approaches which have proved useful for reducing costs and maximizing profits are outlined. The delineation of authorities, responsibilities, and accountabilities is made where applicable. Actual examples from existing projects are included. The management techniques described are considered generally applicable to any large aerospace company where the major target is the capture and efficient execution of large complex programs. These management techniques could be applied to other industries. SAE Transactions 670836. Some Suggestions on the Management of Engineering Activity. Robert W. Bradshaw, Grumman Aircraft Engrg. Corp. Engineering managers can improve their operations by acquiring an increased awareness of the human needs of the engineers under them. The author offers some suggestions for increasing this understanding by discussing the motivating stimuli in the business environment, the nature of authority, what the manager gives in exchange for what he expects, management obligations, commu- nications and frustrations, and the challenge of the least satisfactory employee. 670837. Transient Thermal Simulation of Apollo Spacecraft and ECS. J. R. Frahm and H. F. Walthall, Jr., General Elee. Co., Apollo Support Dept. An analytical thermal model of the project Apollo Command Module has been developed for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. This model simulates the entire spacecraft structure and the four closed fluid loops of the environmental control system. The configuration of the model is discussed as well as the correlation of this type of model with test data. Also covered are the environmental data used in conjunction with the model for mission analysis. Typical results of the mission analyses are discussed in more detail. 670838. Design and Transient Performance of a Liquid Coolant System. R. S. Barker, H. M. Stephens and B. N. Taylor, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. An analytical investigation of the design and transient performance of a representative space vehicle control liquid coolant system is presented. The coolant system is used to transfer waste heat from the vehicle's environ- mental control/life support system to a space radiator. The system was designed by suboptimizing system components on the basis of weight and power at various flow rates, and subsequently finding the minimum total system penalty and corresponding system flow rate. With Freon 21 as the heat transport fluid, the transient analyses indicated that heat loads as low as 20 percent of the design heat load were permissible without causing incipient freezing of the Freon in the radiator tubes.

The environmental control and life-support system design for the 21- and 30-day mission NASA Biosatellite program is presented. A two-loop system provides temperature control for the fuel cell power source, cryogenic gases, water and urine storage, and the gas management system. The latter provides control of the gaseous environment in the recovery capsule. It controls temperature, relative humidity, recirculation and filtration of the atmosphere, buildup of toxic and/or nontoxic gases and odors, and partial and total pressure of the nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere. Comparisons of experimental results with analytical predictions are presented. Extensive thermal vacuum system testing was performed to verify design predictions; good agreement with analysis was achieved. 670840. Design, Development, Fabrication, and Test of an Environmental/Thermal Control and Life Support System for the Apollo Applications Program. Wilbert E. Ellis and Noel C. Willis, Jr., NASA, Manned Spacecraft Center The hardware development effort expended by the personnel of the NASA Manned Spacecraft Center in the field of environmental/thermal control and life support systems in support of the Apollo Applications Program is discussed. Although the Manned Spacecraft Center staff anticipated that the next space program would be an Apollo extension, it was also recognized that the detailed definition of the program would lag the requirement for basic subsystem development. Thus, to permit the vehicle 163</page><page sequence="101">670842-670846 164 prime contractor to proceed judiciously with the design of the spacecraft upon program definition, the staff initiated an effort to provide the required subsystem advances. The basic goals of this effort were to meet the subsystem development requirements, with a directed development program and to develop the new hardware components such that a qualification program could be instituted by the prime contractor with minimum development efforts. Another major goal was to demonstrate the adequacy of the system developed for manned space application by means of a long-duration manned system test. The method of accomplishing these goals, a description of the development tests conducted, and the hardware fabricated are summarized. SA E Transactions 670842. Application of Adsorption Beds to Spacecraft Life Support System. J. K. Jackson and R. L. Blakely, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. Important parameters in designing regenerable absorption beds for spacecraft life support systems are defined. Typical applications include syynthetic zeolite, which is used for carbon dioxide removal; and silica gel, which dehumidifies the atmospheric gas prior to passing it through the zeolite beds. Bed performance is evaluated from correlated test data. A linearized solution of the dynamic mass transfer equations is presented, which provides a simplified method of bed design. This method is used to find the optimum design for a typical four-bed regenerable, isothermal, carbon dioxide removal system. Results of this simplified analysis are compared with those of a detail digital computer study. This comparison indicates that the simplified method predicts system weight approximately 10 percent higher than the detailed evaluation. SAE Transactions 670843. Test and Development of a Regenerative C02 Removal System for Apollo Applications Program. Sam H. Davis, Jr., NASA, Manned Spacecraft Center Basic adsorption data for carbon dioxide and water vapor on molecular sieves and silica gel are reported. A mathematical model was used to predict the behavior of regenerative adsorption multibed systems. Prototype tests of an Apollo size system and comparison of this system with model predictions are discusssed. The basic data include equilibrium isotherm data and nonequilibrium adsorption and desorption data taken in a small cross-section bed. The prototype tests were performed in a 6- by 6- by 6-in. adsorption bed that was packed with silica gel and molecular sieve. 670844. GAT-O-SORB - A Regenerable Sorbent for Carbon Dioxide Control. A. J. Glueckert, P. P. Nuccio and J. D. Zeff, General Amer. Transportation Corp., General Amer. Res. Div. A regenerable absorbent in solid granular form has been developed for the removal of carbon dioxide from air or other gases. The unique features of the absorbent are: (a) no predrying of the gas stream is necessary prior to carbon dioxide absorption, and (b) only moderate regeneration conditions are necessary to desorb carbon dioxide, for example, heating to 180 F and evacuating to a 40 mm vacuum. An operating laboratory prototype having a four-man capacity was built and tested, continuously removing 0.41 lb/hr of carbon dioxide at a 7.6 mm carbon dioxide partial pressure. The system penalties for the unoptimized prototype were: 1. Absorbent weight - 30 lb (7.5 lb/man) 2. Structure and controls - 63 lb (total: 93 lb, or 23.3 lb/man) 3. Electrical power - 288 w (thermal power (electrical or sensible), 472 w; total 760 w, or 190 w/man) 4. Envelope volume - 14 X 24 X 33 in. The absorbent, called Gat-o-sorb, was devised and developed under an independent research program, and improved under contract NAS 1-29 15 for development of the laboratory prototype model. The design and performance of the cycling two-bed system are described. A comparison is shown between Gat-o-sorb and synthetic zeolite for carbon dioxide removal. 670845. Airfoil Analysis and Synthesis Utilizing Computer Graphics. J. J. Cornish, Lockheed-Georgia Co. Determination of the characteristics of arbitrary airfoil sections has mainly been accomplished in the past by wind tunnel tests. Due to the lengthy and often inaccurate computations involved, for the most part, theoretical analyses have been avoided. However, with the advent of high-speed computer techniques, more complicated methods which givee better accuracy can now be used. By combining a number of subroutines which calculate various parts of the overall airfoil analysis, a program for accurately defining the character- istics of airfoil sections in 2-dimensional, incompressible flow at arbitrary Reynolds numbers has been derived. In addition to defining the characteristics of a given section, the program may also be used to synthesize or design an airfoil which will have a desired pressure distribution. The effectiveness and useful speed of this program have been greatly enhanced with the use of computer graphic techniques. The airfoil characteristics are displayed on a cathode ray screen, and the operator communicates with the computer by means of this display; derivation of airfoils with desired characteristics is rapidly accomplished. 670846. Aerodynamic Design of the DC-9 Wing and High-Lift System. Roger D. Schaufele and Ann W. Ebeling, Douglas Aircraft Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. The aerodynamic design of the wing and high-lift system</page><page sequence="102">670847-670851 for the DC-9 short-to-medium-range jet transports is discussed in detail. This wing incorporates full-span leading edge slats for extremely high maximum lift capability and specially designed airfoils for low cruise drag. Preliminary design methods used to establish major wing features such as area, sweep, average thickness, and taper are reviewed, as well as the more detailed design procedures. These procedures include (1) analytical methods for obtaining wing-section pressure distributions, (2) empirical correlations of data on previous designs to obtain the effect of root and tip conditions on section pressure distributions and the variation of these pressures with Mach number, and (3) the relationship between the occurrence of local supersonic flow and drag divergence. The correlation is presented between the estimated wing characteristics and those obtained from wind tunnel tests during the development phase. Flight development tests, designed to confirm the high-lift wing characteristics while utilizing representative "boilerplate" hardware, were conducted to evaluate lift and drag characteristics for both slats-open and slats-closed conditions. During this program, other tests were conducted to evaluate a triple-slotted flap, the supplementary stall recognition system, and the wing tip light fairing, and these results are presented. Correlation of final flight test data on the Series 30 with early estimates show that, for the DC-9 wing and high-lift system, the available methods resulted in a design that met all of the aerodynamic criteria established during the early design phase. SAE Transactions 670847. Aerodynamic Design Features of the C-5A. J. H. Paterson, Lockheed-Georgia Co. The aerodynamic features of the C-5A discussed include only those items which posed a significant challenge to the aerodynamicist: airfoil sections, high-lift systems, and control and augmentation systems. While the cruise configuration is quite conventional in that the C-5A uses a moderately swept wing, a tee-tail, and wing-pylon-mounted engines, the design requirements for forward and aft straight-in fuselage loading coupled with the provision of personnel accommodations, airdrop capability, and extremely high flotation, dictated fuselage and landing gear configurations which required an intensive effort to reduce aerodynamic drag to an absolute minimum level. The design of the high-lift system was dictated by extremely stringent airport requirements and the high wing loading necessary to achieve optimum matching of airframe and engine in the cruise regime. In addition, the use of a modest thrust-to-weight ratio, coupled with a high thrust lapse rate with speed aggravated the difficulties associated with development of a suitable high-lift system. The methods used to achieve the necessary aerodynamic high-lift system performance while satisfying structural requirements are discussed. SAE Transactions 670848. Jet Transport Design Considerations for Category III All-Weather Landing Systems. F. M. Wilson, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc., Aircraft Div. The landing system being developed by Douglas to enable transport aircraft to operate in all-weather conditions is part of a total transportation system being developed by many agencies. The airborne part of the system involves automatic and manual modes, operating as a dynamic system. Inputs to the airborne system are generalized as aerodynamic, earth reference, and visible world. A successful system must properly integrate all of these elements. To achieve this integration, the system was synthesized, designed, laboratory tested, and finally flight evaluated in a DC-9 series 30 aircraft. The systems that were developed during the program are reviewed and problems yet to be resolved are listed. 670849. Selection of an Oxygen Regenerating System To Meet the Demands of a , Multi-Mission Program. G. L. Drake and J. R. Burnett, General Dynamics/Convair The process of selecting a critical life support system function is outlined. As an example, five approaches to oxygen supply for a spacecraft atmosphere are compared and evaluated. The state of the art associated with the five approaches is discussed, as well as some of the problems yet to be resolved. An evaluation model is presented that systematically and rigorously relates each alternative to each evaluation criterion within a set of weighted criteria, specifically chosen to reflect the characteristics of each of several spacecraft in each of several representative missions. The technique presented should help to overcome the severe limitations of the more traditional engineering approaches currently followed in design synthesis. 670851. Water-Vapor Electrolysis Cell with Phosphoric Acid Electrolyte. J. E. Clifford, Battelle Memorial Institute, Columbus Labs. An oxygen-producing water electrolysis cell with phosphoric acid electrolyte can operate on the water vapor in recirculated cabin air and accomplish concurrent dehumidification. The development of the concept over the past three years involved research to define the components of electrode overvoltage and design analysis to provide a small, lightweight unit to compensate for the electrolysis power. Theoretical equations based on electrochemistry, fluid dynamics, and heat and mass transfer correlate with the observed steady-state operation obtained in extended testing of experimental cells for over 1000 hr. Data on electrode life, gas purity, and voltage characteristics combined with size, weight, and power estimates indicate that the new concept would be competitive with other methods of oxygen generation for advanced space missions. The recent satisfactory 165</page><page sequence="103">670852-670858 performance of a prototype module in an extended test of over 1000 hr is reviewed. SAE Transactions 670852. Fecal Waste Management Unit. J. D. Zeff, General Amer. Transportation Corp., General Amer. Res. Div.; B. J. Intorre, ARDE, Inc.; and A. B. Hearld and C. A. Metzger, Air Force Systems Command, Aerospace Medical Div. A novel waste management unit for the collection, sampling, drying, and storage of fecal wastes in a life-support simulator, or aerospace flights has been designed, developed, and tested. The unit collects the feces, which are subsequently air dried at ambient temperature and pressure, and stored. The unit is designed for use in a weightless environment yet has the convenience of operation of an ordinary terrestrial toilet. Other design features include measures to prevent fecal contamination or odors from entering the space cabin, low power requirements, and minimum loss of cabin air overboard. Weight of the unit is about 50 lb. SAE Transactions 670853. Waste Management in Manned Space Vehicles. R. W. Murray, L. Cooper and G. L. Fogal, General Elee. Co. A simple and reliable concept for the collection, processing, disposal or storage of human waste products has been developed for application under conditions of weightlessneess. Psychological acceptance is achieved by utilization of a hardware design permitting conventional earthlike procedures. Bag type containers are not used for collection and storage, thus manual handling of waste products and storage containers is not required. The system is capable of handling urine and fecal waste as well as vomitus and food debris. The solids are vacuum dried to permit bacteriostatic storage and urine can be jettisoned to space. SAE Transactions 670854. Engineering Requirements for Culturing of Hydrogenomonas Bacteria. John F. Foster and John H. Litchfield, Battelle Memorial Inst., Columbus Labs. Experimental results obtained with a continuous culture system for the cultivation of hydrogenomonas eutropha for waste management in a life-support system indicate that a reliable and stable system can be designed under the present state-of-the-art. The present system provides for control of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, pH, all density, temperature, urea, and ammonia during growth. The culture system design is adaptable to operation in a zero-gravity field, and should be adaptable to integration with proposed water electrolysis and product recovery systems for waste management in an overall life-support system. SAE Transactions 670855. Effect of Joint Design and Dimensions on Adhesive Strength. W. A. Dukes and R. W. Bryant, Ministry of Technology, England Five joint designs in steel or aluminum are compared, using both a rubbery and a tough adhesive, cured at room temperature. Circular butts in simple and in torsional shear and tubular butts ("napkin rings") in torsion are preferable to the ASTM D 1002 lap shear, as the adherend dimensions do not affect the measured strength. Thus the strength of a structure can be better assessed. Circular butts in tension ("poker chips") are similarly suitable, and are as strong as in simple shear. The circular butts in torsion are stronger than the tubular butts, but the convenient simple-shear butts are nearly as strong. Strength dependence on strain rate and on adhesive thickness is compared with precision of measurement. 670856. Adhesive Joint Strength as Function of Geometry and Material Parameters. M. A. Nadler and S. Y. Yoshino, North Amer. Aviation, Inc., Space Div. Structural tests on a 54-in. diameter epoxy-phenolic adhesive bonded titanium honeycomb sandwich tank resulted in failure substantially below designed ex- pectations. Design parameters for future bonded construction were studied. Of specific interest were the effect of geometric variables, including scaling effects, and elastic properties of adherends and adhesives. The investigation utilized titanium, stainless steel, aluminum, and beryllium adherends and HT-424 and FM- 1000 adhesives, the former comparatively brittle, the latter quite tough. Analysis of the results: (1) confirmed the generally known relations between bond strength and elastic properties of joint constituents; (2) indicated surprisingly large scaling effects (25-30 percent) not hitherto taken into account in design practices; and (3) revealed that the anomalously high strength-to-modulus ratio of titanium alloys is probably responsible for the often encountered and reported difficulty in obtaining expected bond strength levels in titanium structures. The attained insight has led to the postulation of a "critical strain parameter" concept for brittle adhesives, which appears to be worthy of further exploration. SAE Transactions 670857. Producibility Considerations in Adhesive Bonded Structures. Eugene R. Crilly, Lockheed- California Co. The principal items making up a typical bonded structure (joints, edge closures, doublers and splices, attachments, and core) are examined and their effect on producibility discussed. Certain suggestions toward minimizing the difficulties before they arise in production are made. The importance of prefit checks and department cooperation are also emphasized. 670858. Large High-Temperature Sandwich Structures. Richard Kantner, Whittaker Corp., Narmco 166</page><page sequence="104">670861-670866 Res. and Dev. Div.; and Sidney Litvak, Air Force Materials Lab. Materials and processing variables applying to the fabrication of large sandwich structures which incorporate polybenzimidazole prepreg, high-temperature adhesives, and high-temperature honeycomb cores are evaluated. Manufacturing methods for fabricating large plastic sandwich structures which incorporate high-temperature adhesive and honeycomb core, and polybenzimidazole prepreg are discussed. Finally the problems involved in fabricating three large sandwich structures, using selected materials and processing conditions are described. Room temperature and 650 F sandwich flexural shear and flatwise tension test results of generally equal magnitude were witnessed for all adhesives; however, the less complex processing and lower cure and postcure temperature requirements of the polyimide system resulted in the selection of Bloomingdale polyimide FM-34 adhesive for the first sandwich radome specimen built. 670861. Mi tal-Matrix Composites Behavior and Aerospace Applications. H. Simizu, J. F. Dolowy, Jr., R. J. Taylor and B. A. Webb, Marquardt Corp. Metal-matrix composites of aluminum, titanium, nickel and their alloys reinforced by continuous filaments of boron or silicon carbide are considered. The aluminum-boron system provides advantages at temperatures to 600 F for general application; the titanium-silicon carbide system shows promise for high-temperature applications; but nickel-silicon carbide matrix presents problems in the reaction between the two metals at high temperatures. Selection of matrix alloys depends on filament loading, thermal history imposed by fabrication and usage requirements, the composite reinforcement geometry, and the nature of stress distribution resulting from external loadings. SAE Transactions 670862. Development of Filament Reinforced Titanium Alloys. A. G. Metcalfe and G. K. Schmitz, International Harvester Co., Solar Div. Titanium and its alloys can be used successfully as matrix material for continuous filaments, such as boron or silicon carbide. The single limiting factor in fabrication and life of the composites is the interaction between filament and matrix. Several attempts have been made to manufacture filament-reinforced titanium alloys; however, methods such as powder metallurgy, creep controlled diffusion bonding, and plasma arc spraying have been unsuccessful because interaction has led to reaction layers in excess of 1 micron in thickness. Compound thicknesses of such magnitudes render composites useless because cracks form in the compound at low strains and cause subsequent failure of the filaments. Recent developments in manufacturing techniques have made it possible to control formation of boride or silicide so that prolonged life is obtained. This paper describes properties of such composites. SAE Transactions 670865. Airline View of the SST Power Plants. F. Searls, United Air Lines, Inc. The airline view of SST engines from the 1967 perspective is presented. With the British-French Concorde only months away from first flight, and the major United States SST design decisions made, the age of commercial supersonic flight has practically arrived. Afterburning turbojets will provide the power for both transport airplanes. A review is made, therefore, of some of the technological and operational complications which face the users of this equipment. Among these are the questions of how to deal with the noise problem, what the new higher engine operating temperatures will mean, and what might need to be done in the event of a performance "bust" of the airplane-engine combination. An attempt is made to identify the real problems and separate them from the imaginary ones. Finally, the review ends on an optimistic note considering the resources and creative problem-solving abilities of the industry itself. SAE Transactions 670866. Reduction of Jet Engine Exhaust Smoke with Fuel Additives. M. W. Shayeson, General Elee. Co., Flight Propulsion Div. An investigation of fuel additives was conducted to identify materials which will reduce or eliminate jet engine exhaust smoke. Many materials were evaluated in a full-scale combustor rig, and the better ones were further tested in full-scale engines, both on the ground and in flight. Metallorganic compounds of barium, manganese, and iron were found capable of essentially eliminating smoke under some conditions. Although all of them formed solid exhaust products, in some cases these products caused no major adverse effects on J79 engine operation in limited endurance tests. 1670869 DC-8 aircraft fuel tank sump drainings and soil, air, and fuel-water samples from fuel distribution facilities were analyzed for microbial contamination. The data were evaluated to determine the fuel tank contamination, its sources, and its effect upon the aircraft so that corrosion prevention methods could be developed. Sampling plans and microbial examination techniques are presented. Principal contaminants were Hormo- dendrum resinae, Candida sp., and yeast-like cells. They appeared together in many aircraft. Most of the microorganisms found in aircraft samples were also found in samples from fuel distribution facilities, but only in very low frequency in aircraft dispensed fuel. The fuel facilities could serve as an important microbial source when the final barrier is breached or not effective. SAE Transactions 167</page><page sequence="105">670869-670876 670869.

Young, William J. Bays and Edwin C. Reynolds, Jr., Air Force Dept., Oklahoma City Air Materiel Area The U.S. Air Force Engineering Development Program has established a method of isolating vibration from a single force function within turbojet engines. The stimulus of this program was that a large number of jet engines were removed from service for exceeding the established overall vibration. In most instances, complete overhaul of these engines did not identify the source of vibration. The result was high cost of repair in manhours and materials, plus engine unavailability. The goal of this program was to develop vibration equipment and limits that could be used in the field to isolate sources of excessive vibration and enable the using activity to remove the defective component. Techniques used to establish filtering requirements to isolate a single vibration source from the complex input, equipment specifications, and vibration limits on selected parts will be discussed. The type of instrumentation used for jet engine diagnosis using vibration trouble-shooting limit charts will be included in the discussion. SAE Transactions 670871. Jet Engine Malfunction Diagnostic System Using Sonic/ Vibration Analysis. A. J. Kasak and L. R. Last, General Elee. Co., Flight Propulsion Div. Jet engine malfunctions can be detected by acoustic and vibration measurement. A means of detecting engine malfunctions, or functional variations, with a high confidence level is being investigated using digital computer techniques. Operation of the analyzer is based on subjecting incoming "real time" data to predetermined tests and categorizing the data based on these tests. Using this method, several different types of possible mal- functions were checked at one time in less than 10 sec. Acoustic and vibration design data, required to form the malfunction decision rule, were tape recorded in test programs of actual known malfunctions in jet engines. Both normal engine data and malfunction data with several degrees of failure were used to establish each predicted malfunction detection mode. SAE Transactions 670872. Engine Vibration Signals as an Aid to Fault Diagnosis. L. R. Hulls and J. R. Welch, Philco-Ford Corp. The techniques that can be used for diagnosing engine malfunctions from vibration signals are discussed in a general way. The various kinds of signals which can be obtained by instrumenting an engine are considered with reference to the various analytical techniques available for abstracting useful diagnostic information. The results of two experiments are used to illustrate some of the suggested methods. One experiment shows how an oversized rod bearing can be detected, and the other demonstrates a technique for pinpointing mal- functions in the valves. 670873. Mechanical Impedance Approach to Engine Vibration Transmission into an Aircraft Fuselage. S. Rubin, consultant; and F. A. Biehl, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. A mechanical impedance approach to reduce aircraft cabin noise resulting from fuselage vibration generated by engine rotor unbalance disturbances is described. A simplified analytical model is used in combination with experimental impedance data to investigate the effec- tiveness of several schemes applied to the engine/airframe interface. Airframe vibration absorbers are found to be the most effective. Qualitative correlation is achieved with the results of the installation of absorbers on the Douglas DC-9 aircraft. A more comprehensive analytical model is generated to account for 3-dimensional effects; data acquisition for this model is discussed. SAE Transactions 670874. Application of Fast Fourier Transform Procedures to Shock and Vibration Data Analysis. Loren D. Enochson and Allan G. Piersol, Measurement Analysis Corp. The theory of fast Fourier transformation procedures, and their use for shock and vibration data analysis are discussed. The basic principles of the Cooley-Tukey and Sande-Tukey approaches are described, and programming considerations are detailed. The computational efficiency afforded by these procedures is illustrated for specific cases. The application of fast Fourier transformation procedures to the estimation of power and cross-spectra used extensively in shock and vibration analysis is then outlined with emphasis on the practical computational problems which arise. 670876. Statistical Energy Analysis of Vibration Trans- mission into an Instrument Package. Terry D. 168</page><page sequence="106">670878-670884 Scharton and Thomas M. Yang, Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. Random vibration transmission from a vibrating source into an instrument package is analyzed using statistical energy analysis techniques. A general outline of these techniques, followed by a specific application to an instrument box attached to a vibrating plate, are presented. Consideration is also given to vibration isolation of the instrument box and to a novel method of performing vibration tests of small instrument packages and components. The experimental results presented agree well with theoretical results and indicate that these new analysis techniques offer new insight into practical high-efficiency vibration problems. SAE Transactions 670878. Variable Geometry in a Supersonic Transport Aircraft. John M. Swihart, Boeing Co. The variable-geometry features of the Boeing supersonic transport are described. Particular attention is given to the hardware development of those variable-geometry features unique to the supersonic transport. The design, development, and current status of a direct lift control system, the supersonic internal-external compression inlet, and the full-scale wing pivot are described. SAE Transactions 670879. Pilot Comments on Variable Geometry Aircraft. Robert K. Parsons, Air Force Dept. Some of the more significant factors affecting the design and flying qualities of a variable geometry aircraft are discussed. These comments were prepared by a test pilot currently involved in testing a variable geometry aircraft and so are not as detailed as one might expect from a design engineer's viewpoint. The selection of a wing pivot location is discussed along with longitudinal stability characteristics. The comments on flying qualities of a variable wing aircraft include trim changes and buffet boundary limits with wing sweeps, performance gains, operational flexibility, and cockpit controls. In addition, some suggestions for future application of the variable geometry principles are made. SAE Transactions 670880. Aerodynamic Design Considerations of Variable Geometry Aircraft. S. K. Landgraf and R. N. Herring, McDonnell Douglas Corp. Aircraft designs have been characterized by an increasing utilization of variable geometry features as aircraft capabilities expand into new flight regimes. The trend seems likely to continue as requirements for new aircraft become continually more demanding. The successful application of variable geometry depends on several things: the understanding of the aerodynamic principles involved, efficient structure, and whether an overall worthwhile improvement in performance, maneuverability, or flying qualities is gained; since it certainly will cost more, be less reliable, and more difficult to maintain. The application of some existing and proposed variable geometry schemes to aircraft is discussed. The aerodynamic factors affecting low and high speed performance, maneuverability, and stability and control characteristics indicccate some of the desirable and troublesome aspects of these concepts. SAE Transactions 670881. Structural Considerations for Variable Sweep Wings. J. W. Harvey, McDonnell Douglas Corp. Pivot point concepts for fighter aircraft with variable sweep wings are reviewed. Structural and aerodynamic considerations involved in sweep pivot location, a summary of endurance testing of Teflon lined journal bearings, and variation of fatigue life of the aircraft versus wing sweep position are discussed. SAE Transactions 670882. Mechanical Aspects of Variable Sweep Wings. F. M. Paget, General Dynamics Corp., Fort Worth Div. The use of variable sweep wings creates a special set of aircraft mechanical design considerations. This paper contains some of the philosophy and design that grew from the development of the variable sweep feature on the F-lll aircraft. SAE Transactions 670883. Maintainability Considerations in Variable Geometry Aircraft. L. J. Onewein, Boeing Co., Supersonic Transport Div. The Boeing SST design incorporates a variable-geometry wing. Some of the wing-pivot-joint and actuation-system configurations considered during the development of the SST variable-geometry design are discussed herein. In addition, the selected SST design is described, and detailed maintainability and maintenance requirements are reviewed. 670884. Reliability of the SST Wing-Sweep Actuation System. G. C. Newell and F. E. Marsh, Boeing Co., Supersonic Transport Div. The United States supersonic transport must be capable of equaling or even better, exceeding the reliability of today's subsonic jets to be profitable in scheduled revenue passenger service. This paper describes reliability aspects of the wing-sweep actuation system for the Boeing SST in terms of (a) the hardware interfaces, functional purposes, and basic design concepts; (b) the basic requirements and design criteria established by Federal Air Regulations, Tentative Airworthiness Standards, FAA-established numeric goals, and Boeing-evaluated airline economic goals; and (c) reliability analyses relating the hardware design to specific requirements.

The conditions, the problems therewith, and the performance of various fastener materials when subjected to these unusual environments are defined. SAE Transactions 670886. (SP-293) Advanced Fasteners: Design Trade-Offs that Determine Fastener Selection. Oscar Ritchie, Boeing Co. Fastener selection entails two functions, a staff function to select a group of fasteners for consideration and a design function to select the most suitable fastener for a specific function. The considerations that enter into each function in selecting fasteners for commercial and military aircraft, military unmanned vehicles, and space vehicles are itemized in detail. Characteristics of specific bolts and fasteners are also tabulated. SAE Transactions 670887. (SP-293) Advanced Fasteners: Structural Fasteners for Extreme Temperature Utilization. Charles L. Ramsey and Jesse C. Ingram, Jr., Air Force Systems Command, Flight Dynamics Lab. Fasteners, specifically threaded types, can be fabricated from columbium, molybdenum, and tantalum alloys employing conventional equipment and special handling procedures. Limited success in development of blind fasteners has been realized with columbium and tantalum alloys; however, embrittlement of the substrate by the required protective coating makes deformation difficult and lack of coating ductility prevents assured oxidation protection where post installation is not possible. Dispersion strengthened metals which offer excellent thermal stability may also be fabricated into useful fastener configurations. Summary of strength and oxidation test results of fasteners are presented and future materials for fastener developments are discussed. SAE Transactions 670888.

Practical solutions to operating engine fastener problems are discussed. 670889. (SP-293) Advanced Fasteners: Fastener System Concept. A. G. Tokarcik, Goodyear Aerospace Corp. A wide range of threaded fasteners for structural applications is available to fulfill the ever-increasing demands of the aerospace industry. Each of the basic designs was developed to fulfill a need and, consequently, possesses certain characteristic features defining that need, such as extended fatigue performance, superior notch toughness, exceptional corrosion resistance, and new wrenching configuration. These characteristic features, in combination with the dimensional and mechanical property characteristics, define a product having a potential performance capability. The objective is to define the basic parameters considered mandatory for utilizing this performance capability in a structure. 670890.

The influence of hole preparation, hole finish, fastener surface coatings, thread lubricants, and fastener fits on joint fatigue life is discussed. Some data on titanium alloy riveted and bolted joint fatigue life are presented to show the effect of rivet hole filling and bolt close and interference fits.

These are: fastener performance, reliability, safety, standardization, avail- ability, ease of use, reasonable cost, inter-changeability, tooling, corrosion control, re-useability, and identification. Of these, the following are considered in some detail: standardization, service life, and identification. 670892. (P-21) Dynamic Modeling in Engineering. Leonard Segel and Ray W.

After a brief discussion of the steps involved in the modeling process, applications are cited in the fields of aircraft design, control systems, circuit analysis and synthesis, structures, process control, vehicles other than aircraft, and human performance. Detailed consideration is given to two examples: design and optimization of an aircraft control system, and prediction of non-periodic structural loading on a rotary wing. Finally, it is suggested how techniques successfully applied in other fields can aid in automotive vehicle safety studies. SAE Transactions 170</page><page sequence="108">670893-670902 670893. (P-21) Computer Simulation of Driver Behavior. Theodore E. Anderson, Edwin A. Kidd and Kenneth R. Laughery, Cornell Aero. Lab., Inc. Many mathematical models have been developed which simulate various types of traffic situations. These models usually focus attention on the overall performance of the system and are typically not concerned with the behavior of individual drivers. The model presented in this paper deals with the individual driver and his interactions with the environment and other v hieles. It attempts to simulate the driver's perceptual, decision making, and response processes as he approaches, passes through, and leaves an intersection. A comparison is made between the model's output and field data, and it is concluded that, at a very gross level, the model accurately predicts driver behavior. 670894. (P-21) Systems Approach to the Simulation of Impact Trauma. Bruce W. Pince, Space/Defense Corp. A physical model capable of credible simulation of human trauma is badly needed in automobile safety research. Development of such a model has been limited, not only by lack of biological and engineering data, but by lack of a coherent, sequential plan of attack on the problem. Such a plan, based upon the systems approach, is offered. The plan has two major phases. The first phase includes qualitative analysis, hypothetic modeling, and program planning; the second provides for empiric research, system modeling, and design, fabrication, and test of a physical model. 670895. (P-21) Potential for Predicting Flexible Car Crash Response. R. J. Melosh, Philco-Frod Corp., Western Dev. Lab.; and D. M. Kelley, Philco-Ford Corp., Western Dev. Lab. The car crash simulation problem is characterized as the development of the coefficients in equations of the motion for the car and the solution of these equations. The complexity of the car structure and the car response require a numerical and mathematical model of the structural system. No major technical advances are required to develop a satisfactory modeling. The mathematical model requires an extensive number of calculations. Structures involving as many as 880 equations are indicated to be economically treated by numerical analysis compared with physical tests. Improvements in computer hardware and a mathematical modeling technique can be anticipated to reduce analysis costs. Data describing the material properties as a function of pertinent parameters may not be satisfactory for obtaining adequate correlation of analysis and tests. Development of these data are indicated to require a minimum of one year's time. SA E Transactions 670896. (P-21) Experimental Validation of Dynamic Models. John Versace, Ford Motor Co. Validation of two types of models are discussed: functional and structural. The former are predictive, the latter presume to represent reality with great accuracy. To validate a model, its predictions must be compared with observable data, which calls for accurate use of statistics. The application of inferential statistics is briefly discussed, along with the problems of experimental design. The author concludes that modeling can be an effective tool in automotive safety research, but it must be carefully coordinated with accident data collection. It is in the latter area that more work is needed. 670897. (P-21) Basic Study of "Energy-Absorbing" Vehicle Structure and Oicupant Restraints by Mathematical Model. Dennis N. Renneker, Chrysler Corp.

A two-mass model was developed and validated to compute restraint loading from a given passenger compartment deceleration. The effect of various deceleration curves, representing forestructure modifi- cations, is reported. A "constant force" restraint system is also evaluated. SA E Transactions 670901.

The reported experimental results are for variations in the output load resistance only. Variations in power jet pressure and output impedance may change the frequency where the amplifier departs from the predicted response. The experimental procedure and frequency response test results are discussed. SAE Transactions 670904. (P-20) Computer Simulation of Single Vehicle Accidents. Raymond R. McHenry, David J. Segal and Norman J. Deleys, Cornell Aero- nautical Lab., Inc. An eleven-degree-of-freedom nonlinear mathematical model of an automobile traversing a variety of irregular terrain features and encountering a variety of roadside obstacles has been formulated and programmed for a digital computer. The primary objective of the described research has been to develop analytical means of evaluating existing and proposed roadside energy conversion systems. However, the developed computer simulation also has potential applications in the reconstruction of single vehicle accidents and in studies of the driving task at the upper limits of vehicle control. A unique feature is the simulation of combined cornering and ride motions. In its present form, the computer program includes open-loop evasive maneuvers. The results of a review of single vehicle accident statistics and also measurements of structural load- deformation properties of automobiles, performed within this research program, are presented. The mathematical model is described, and a series of comparisons is presented between simulated responses and test results from the literature. The comparisons include cornering, ride, curb and bridge parapet impact, guardrail impact, ditch traversal, and skidding responses. SAE Transactions 670905. (P-20) Device for the Investigation of Head Injury Effected by Non-Deforming Head Ac- celerations. Lawrence S. Higgins and Robert A. Schmall, Technology Inc., Life Sciences Div. An investigation of head injury has led to the design and construction of a machine having the following functional goals: 1 . Delivery of a reproducible acceleration-time profile to a primate head. 2. Capability of increasing the acceleration magnitude while retaining a similar acceleration-time profile. 3. The path traversed by the head must be constrained during the acceleration. 4. The forces applied to the head must be distributed so as not to produce gross damage to the brain or skull. This machine - Head Acceleration Device II (HAD-II) - consists of an axial cam cut on the face of a flywheel, and the cam follower imparts the motion of the cam through a linkage to a helmet in which the test subject's head has been potted. The helmet is rigidly pivoted causing the head to be rotated through an arc of 45 degrees. The peak acceleration attained by the cam follower was 1250 g's, with a positive phase duration of approximately 3 milli-seconds. An initial sample of 26 anesthetized squirrel monkeys was run on HAD-II at various acceleration levels. Each animal experienced only one acceleration pulse and survivors were sacrificed five days post test. A probit analysis of the data was performed and results compared with earlier work. 670906. (P-20) Scaling of Experimental Data on Cerebral Concussion in Sub-Human Primates to Concussion Threshold for Man. A. K. Ommaya and P. Yarnell, National Inst, of Neurological Diseases and Blindness; A. E. Hirsch, Naval Ship Res. and Dev. Center; and E. H. Harris, Tulane Univ. A method of extending the results of experiments on concussion-producing head rotations on lower primate subjects to predict the rotations required to produce concussions in man is presented. A rational scheme of development of the overall investigation is outlined. Theoretical scaling factors are derived and discussed and the results of concussion-producing tests on the Rhesus monkey are presented in chart form. A chart of angular acceleration required to produce concussion in the Rhesus monkey indicates that an acceleration of 40,000 radians per second per second will have greater than 99 percent probability of producing concussion. The scaling factors presented herein tentatively indicate that an acceleration of 7,500 radians per second per second will have the same probability of producing concussion in man. 670907. (P-20) Safety of Windshield Against Flying Stones. G. Rodloff and G. Breitenburger, Deutsche Tafelglas A.G. More than 1000 road driving trials were made to determine some of the limits of safety offered by the various types of "safety" glass: (1) tempered glass; (2) chemically-strengthened glass; (3) laminated construction with chemically-strengthened glass; (4) laminated safety glass with different thicknesses of the interlayer. It was found that windshields made of tempered glass could suddenly break during the study, and this can be considered a potential cause of an accident. The visibility 172</page><page sequence="110">670908-670913 along the stopping distance is not guaranteed. This also applies to laminates made with strengthened glass - a development which is being pressed in the United States. Such strengthened constructions are not penetrated by stones. However, the risk involved in covering the stopping distance with limited visibility is increased, since some drivers in the face of this danger who have no "second of fear" (delayed reaction) could punch out a hole in an overall-crazed windshield when it is made of a single piece of strengthened glass. 670908. (P-20) Development of Anthropomorphic Test Dummies to Match Specific Human Responses to Accelerations and Impacts. Samuel W. Alderson, Alderson Res. Labs., Inc. The anthropomorphic test dummies developed originally for testing aircraft ejection seats have been found to give test results that do not agree satisfactorily with operational results because of their lack of capability for reproducing and measuring human stresses. Such measurements are essential in automotive safety research and require that dummies be matched to humans with respect to their anthropometry, to such interfaces with the environment as shoulders, chest, abdomen, buttocks, and so forth, at d with respect to dynamic response. Current developments of such dummies are described in the paper. 670909. (P-20) Hydraulic Bumper - Automatic Seat Belt Package on Ground Vehicles. James J. Ryan, University of Minnesota The engineering extrapolation of the data from the University of Minnesota tests on the hydraulic bumper- automatic seat-belt package made with 3600- and 6000-lb automotive vehicles is presented. It shows the forces of impact on passengers in small cars, buses, trucks and semis for a series of accident conditions. The structural protection required for a safer crash of one vehicle into the side of another and into barricades with this package is prescribed. It has been found that small cars, given additional rigidity, and head room for the passenger, have nearly the equivalent safety characteristics of larger cars, and heavy transports may incorporate greater safety for drivers. 670910. (P-20) Some Aspects of Traffic Injury in Urban Road Accidents. G. Murray Mackay and C. P. de Fonseka, University of Birmingham, England Some aspects of an on-the-spot study of 425 urban road accidents in Birmingham, England are presented. Injury patterns to pedestrians, motorcyclists and front seat car occupants are summarized. The origins of these injuries in relation to road and vehicular impacts are discussed. Vehicle components causing injury to pedestrians and to car occupants are analyzed. Crash helmet effectiveness in motorcycle impacts is discussed and some comment is made on seat belt fitting and use. 670911. (P-20) Determination of Response Characteristics of the Head with Emphasis on Mechanical Impedance Techniques. V. R. Hodgson, E. S. Gurdjian and L. M. Thomas, Wayne State Univ. Certain physical characteristics such as apparent mass and stiffness influence the dynamic response of the head, and thereby the degree of trauma suffered from impact with another body. These characteristics are a function of frequency and can be determined by mechanical impedance measurement techniques. A force generator was attached directly to the skull and the force input and resulting motion at the point of attachment were measured respectively by a force and acceleration transducer. The magnitude as well as phase angle between these two vectors were measured over the frequency range from 5 to 5000 Hz. A plot of the ratio of force and acceleration versus frequency and phase angle versus frequency on a nomograph reveal that both the apparent mass and stiffness of the head vary markedly from static values, and with location. Effective values of these physical properties at a given vibration frequency correspond to those arising during an impulse containing components at the same frequency. Results and relationship of this information to skull deformation and acceleration are shown and discussed. 670912. (P-20) Safety Performance of Laminated Glass Configurations. R. G. Rieser and J. Chabal, Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., Glass Res. Center Impact performance of a large variety of interlayer combinations laminated with annealed plate, heat strengthened, and fully tempered glasses has been analyzed for acceleration pulses, "severity index" and penetration. These tests, conducted at 0 F, 70 F, and 120 F, indicate that small interlayer thickness changes are most effective in upgrading performance. Severity index numbers well below 1000 were calculated for laminated safety glass with interlayer thickness as high as 0.120 in. Highly localized bending of glass panels during impact with the 22-lb headform has been recorded through high-speed photography, as reflected grid board distortion. Lacerative potential of laminated safety glass is being evaluated by using a simulated skin developed through studies of human tissue. SA E Transactions 670913. (P-20) Cadaver Knee, Chest and Head Impact Loads. L. M. Patrick and H. J. Mertz, Jr., Wayne State Univ.; and C. K. Kroell, General Motors Res. Labs. Human tolerance to knee, chest and head impacts based upon skeletal fracture of cadavers is reported. The results are based upon unrestrained cadaver impacts in a normal seated position in simulated frontal force accidents at velocities of 10-20 mph and stopping distances of 6-8 in. The head target was covered with 15/16-in. padding. 173</page><page sequence="111">670914-670918 No skull or facial fractures were observed at loads up to 2640 lb. Extensive facial fractures and a linear skull fracture occurred during application of the maximum head force of 4350 lb. The chest target was 6 in. in diameter, with 15/16-in. padding. The padding was rolled over the edge of the target to minimize localized high force areas on the ribs. A 1/8-in. diameter rod was inserted through the chest and fastened through a ball joint and flange to the soft tissue at the sternum. Deflection of the chest was determined by measuring the distance between the back of the cadaver and the end of the probe from the high-speed motion pictures. Four rib fractures were observed at 1340 lb and extensive fractures were observed at 1850 lb. The maximum chest deflection was 2.18 in. at 1815 lb. The knee targets were padded with 1 7/16-in. padding. No fractures were observed at forces up to 1970 lb. SA E Transactions 670914. (P-20) Development of Energy-Absorbing Steering Column Assembly for Small Passenger Cars. J. Banshoya, H. Okoshi, S. Asano and K. Okamoto, Nippon Seiko Kabushiki Kaisha A new energy absorbing steering column has been developed for small passenger cars, which have more dimentional restrictions than large ones do. The column utilizes frictional and plastic deformation resistance as absorbing means. This paper presents design details, test results on various specifications and conditions. It also discusses various factors which affect the performance, analysis of column compression both statically and dynamically, testing methods and equipment for components and complete assembly. It is shown that its intended features of relatively low peak load and reasonable compression length have been achieved. 670915. (P-20) Study of Internal Movements of the Body Occurring on Impact. J. L. Nickerson, Milana Drazic, R. Johnson, H. Udesen and K. Turner, Chicago Medical School An X-ray experimental method for observing the motion of body visceral regions subject to whole-body impact has been developed. The observations demonstrate the movement of internal areas relative to the spinal column and to the impact cradle. Calculation of displacement from the rest position, including the lag on free fall, and velocities and accelerations generated are presented. In these experiments the maximum drop height was 84 in., so that the trauma produced was minimal. 670916. (P-20) Comparative Responses of Small and Medium Sized Primates, Both Live and Embalmed, to Impact Stress. Jeffry S. Life and Bruce W. Pince, Space/Defense Corp., Basic and Applied Res. Dept. Embalmed cadavers have been used extensively to study impact dynamics but the results seem inconclusive to us. To collect statistically valid data eventually allowing extrapolation to humans, squirrel and rhesus monkeys, (both alive and anesthetized and dead and embalmed) were impacted using a linear accelerator. The embalming procedures were standardized and the impacts were targeted, precisely controlled and proportional. Necropsy showed that in both small and medium sized primates, embalmed bone is more susceptible to damage than live bone. The converse is true for the soft tissues impacted. The intraspecies differences are statistically significant, and further, the interspecies comparisons show positive correlation in most cases. Our results suggest that embalmed tissue response is not representative of live tissue response. This conclusion is at variance with others' findings. Embalming procedures and experimental design account for some of the discrepancies. Additional work is needed to "calibrate" cadavers to allow their confident use in biodynamics. SAE Transactions 670917. (P-20) Nomograms for Impact Calculations. Paul Richter, Abendgymnasium - Hannover. Velocities, momenta, and energy distribution after impact can be calculated by a simple method. This technique can be used only when two bodies are involved that represent a closed system. One of the bodies is assumed to be at rest with respect to the chosen frame of reference before impact. Very simple geometric figures are used with the method. For the central impact, for example, the distribution of velocity and momentum after impact is found from the point of intersection of two straight lines. One of these represents the ratio of masses of the interacting bodies, and the other represents the degree of elasticity (thus depending only on the ratio of the actual loss of translatory kinetic energy - resulting from impact - to the highest possible loss of translatory kinetic energy - resulting from a nonelastic impact between two bodies of the same mass and velocity.) 670918. (P-20) Injuries to Rear Seat Occupants in Automobile Collisions. Alan M. Nahum, Arnold W. Siegel and Philip V. Hight, UCLA School of Medicine A study was made of 54 collisions resulting in injuries to rear-seat occupants unrestrained by seatbelts. It was determined that children (who represent a disproportionate percentage of rear-seat occupants) tend to become airborne and to incur severe injuries against the windshield, mirror, dashboard and header. Adults tend to injure the face and head against the front seat and to sustain typical leg fractures from trapping their feet under the front seat. The occupants seated at the outside edges of the rear seat sustain dangerous injuries from metal ashtrays and window crank handles out of proportion to the severity of the collision. All unrestrained rear-seat occupants add to the injuries of front-seat 174</page><page sequence="112">670919-670924 occupants by hurtling into them. Terminology to describe the types and severity of collisions is offered to facilitate medical and engineering evaluation of injuries. Recommendations are made for design changes to lessen hazards. 670919. (P-20) Investigation of the Kinematics and Kinetics of Whiplash. H. J. Mertz, Jr. and L. M. Patrick, Wayne State Univ. The kinematics of rear-end collisions based on published acceleration pulses of actual car-to-car collisions (10 and 23 mph) were reproduced on a crash simulator using anthropomorphic dummies, human cadavers and a volunteer. Comparison of the responses of subjects without head support were based on the reactions developed at the base of the skull (occipital condyles). The cadaver gave responses which were representative of persons unaware of an impending collision. The responses of both dummies used were not comparable with those of the cadavers or volunteer, or to each other. An index based on voluntary human tolerance limits to statically applied head loads was developed and used to determine the severity of the simulations for the unsupported head cases. Results indicated that head torque rather than neck shear or axial forces is the major factor in producing neck injury. When the head is initially supported by a flat, padded headrest, all subjects give comparable headrest loads. Using this configuration, the volunteer withstood an equivalent 44 mph simulation with only slight discomfort. SAE Transactions 670920. (P-20) Research at the Road Research Laboratory into the Protection of Car Occupants. I. D. Neilson, Road Res. Lab., Ministry of Transport, Great Britain Detailed accident and injury investigations at the BRRL show that the greatest need is to provide protection against injuries produced in frontal collisions. Data from American impact studies and from the Laboratory's own controlled impact test provide the basic information on which protective measures should be based. Theoretical and experimental work show that safety belts which also afford restraint to the upper part of the body are likely to be by far the most effective way of providing protection. The development of standards and of testing methods is briefly discussed. An assessment of the value of safety belts in use in protecting car occupants in Great Britain is given. The paper also describes investigations into the protection value of padding material, safety glass, overall and detail design of vehicles, crash barriers and lamp standards. 670921. (P-20) Preliminary Findings of Head Support Designs. Derwyn M. Severy, Harrison M. Brink and Jack D. Baird, Institute of Transportation and Traffic Engrg., California Univ. Scientific methodology and engineering techniques were applied to the initial four of a series of 12 automobile rear-end collision experiments to provide data relating to seat and head-support design. Two speeds of impact, three seatback heights and two seatback strength values were studied. This is a study to evaluate the relative protective merits and the practicality of various seat designs with respect to the many variables common to rear-end collisions. This basic research data will provide a standard reference system for determining collision performance of seat and head-support designs with respect to occupant size, posture, and proximity to injury producing structures. 670922. (P-20) Experimental Impact Protection with Advanced Automotive Restraint Systems: Pre- liminary Primate Tests with Air Bag and Inertia Reel /Inverted- Y Yoke Torso Harness. Richard G. Snyder and Joseph W. Young, Engineering Staff, Ford Motor Co.; and Clyde C. Snow, Federal Aviation Agency, Dept. of Trans- portation Biochemical primate evaluation of inverted-Y yoke torso harness with inertia reel and the air bag restraint system as experimentally adapted for possible automotive use is described. These tests are a continuation of a study involving the relative impact protection and effectiveness of major restraint systems utilized in general aviation aircraft and in limited automotive use. The objective of this test series was to determine how much protection those advanced restraint concepts provided; to obtain preliminary biomechanical and physiological data; to identify problems of technique and applications in occupant protection; and to provide an initial basis for direction of future test requirements. 670923. (P-20) Development of a Model for the Study of Head Injury. V. R. Hodgson, E. S. Gurdjian and L. M. Thomas, Wayne State Univ. Experiments have revealed that the brain of the experimental animal behaves elastically in response to dynamic forces in situ. The response of the skull of the human cadaver has been investigated by means of static load-deflection tests and impact and mechanical impedance tests. This information has been used to construct a 2-dimensional head model consisting of a polyester resin shell reinforced with fiberglas with plexiglass sides; a clear silicone gel brain; and spinal cord simulated by a plexiglass tube containing silicone gel supported by a piston-spring assembly. Several frames taken from motion pictures recorded at 7000 frames per sec. show how pressure gradients in the model are displayed by observing the growth and location of bubbles during impact. 670924.

Bruckner, Vereinigte Glaswerke, Central Labs. 175</page><page sequence="113">670925-670931 When a blunt body of simple design strikes a plate of brittle material, such as glass, the effects produced can be determined by calculation up to the point of fracture if the shape- and time-dependent factors of the occurring deformation are taken into account. The results are of importance for the internal safety of motor vehicles as they give information on the actions occurring during an impact on a windshield. 670925. (P-20) Statistical Analysis of 28,000 Accident Cases with Emphasis on Occupant Restraint Value. N. I. Bohlin, Volvo AB, Passenger Car Engrg. Dept. The value of the 3-point safety-belt is evaluated by a statistical analysis of more than 28,000 accident cases, which concerned mainly two car models only and in which 37,511 unbelted and belted front seat occupants weree involved. The safety harness concerned is Volvo's 3-point combined lap- and upper torso harness with so called slip-joint. The average injury reducing effect of the harness proved to vary between 40 and 90 percent, depending on accident speed or type of injury. Non-belted occupants sustained fatal injuries throughout the whole speed-scale, whereas none of the belted occupants was fatally injured at accident speeds below 60 mph. Slight injuries only, mostly single rib cracks, bruises, and so forth, referred to the safety belt were reported in some cases. The 3-point belt proved to be fully effective against ejection out of the car. Almost all cars involved were equipped with safety belts, of which, however, only 26 percent on an average were used. Use-frequency increased with increasing age of occupant. SAE Transactions 670926. (P-20) Injuries in Urban and Rural Traffic Accidents: A Comparison of Two Studies. G. Anthony Ryan, Harvard Univ., School of Public Health Urban injury-producing traffic accidents in Adelaide, South Australia have been compared with rural, injury-producing highway accidents in the United States. The rural accidents had more front impacts, higher impact speeds, and more severe damage to the cars involved, than the urban accidents. In the rural accidents, car occupants were injured more often and more severely than in the urban accidents. The head and lower limbs were injured most frequently in both groups of accidents. In urban accidents the door was the chief cause of injury to all body areas except the leg, due to the large number of side impacts. In rural accidents the windshield, steering wheel, instrument panel and ejection were the chief causes of injury. It is concluded that the differences between the two broad groups of accidents - urban and rural - must be considered when methods of alleviating injuries are being designed into the automobile. The three-point seat belt which restrains the upper torso is suggested as a most effective means of preventing injury in automobile accidents. 670928. Heat Flow in Engine Pistons. S. J. Pachernegg, List-Rosen-Wittek Inc. The theoretical approaches for determining the amount and distribution of heat flow in pistons are discussed and their limitations pointed out. A simplified theoretical model of a cylindrical disc with specified boundary conditions is introduced as a help to understanding the frequently cross-linked relationships. The application of theory proposed here may be useful in the treatment of thermal problems. The heat balance of direct piston cooling is presented in relation to the total heat release for various engine cycles. The specific capacity of heat transfer from the piston by the coolant is discussed. SAE Transactions 670929. Measurement of Instantaneous Gas Temperatures for Determination of the Exhaust Gas Energy of a Highly Supercharged Diesel Engine. Klaus Mollenhauer, Institut fur Verbrennung- skraftmaschinein der Technischen Universit√§t Berlin To calculate the true exhaust gas energy of a high-pressure turbocharged diesel engine, the pressures and the instantaneous temperatures were measured in the exhaust gas pipe of a test engine. The results and the problems encountered during measuring are described, and simple approximation equations for the instantaneous temperature are compared with the measured temperatures. Energy calculations carried out with these temperature functions have shown that the deviations from the true values are only slight. SAE Transactions 670930. Analytical Representation of the Thermodynamic Properties of Combustion Gases. F. Zacharias, BP Benzin und Petroleum AG This paper deals with mathematical equations for compressibility factor, enthalpy, and entropy of real combusion gases. These equations are approximated representations of the thermodynamic properties of burned gases, including low and high temperature behavior and hence the effects of molecular forces and dissociation. A suitable system in FORTRAN, based on the equations, is programmed to resemble a series of charts for burned mixtures so that the same variety of data can be obtained much faster than by manual calculation.

Universally Applicable Equation for the Instan- taneous Heat Transfer Coefficient in the Internal Combustion Engine. Gerhard Woschni, Ma- schinenfabrik, Augsburg-Numberg AG The heat transfer coefficient for internal-combustion engines is calculated by a new method. From the laws of 176</page><page sequence="114">670932-670937 similarity governing convective heat transfer, the author has derived an equation consisting of two convective terms, one of which takes into account the piston motion and the other the convection due to combustion. These terms, by means of several constants, separately take into consideration the fluid flow conditions in the scavenging period plus the type of combustion system. The constants were determined as follows: First, on an unfired engine, the scavenging period and the compression and expansion strokes were examined separately, to give the heat transfer conditions that depend on piston motion. Then the combustion influence was determined on the same, but this time fired, engine. Discussion: N. A. Heinen; University of Michigan; T. LeFeuvre, P. S.

Hydrostatic drives for trucks have gradually been appearing over the past few years. Truck auxiliaries, such as cranes, transit mixers, winchers, are in production and truck drives, such as front wheels or rear wheels, are in the prototype and early production stages. This paper discusses some of the drives, both fixed and steerable, and compares a powered wheel concept with the powered axle. Some typical circuits and components are discussed and the future growth of this type of drive is outlined. 670934. Factorial Testing of Diesel Engine Piston Rings. Paul R. Shepler and Carl S. Weinberger, Koppers Co., Inc. The use of the factorial method of testing is demonstrated for four diesel engines. Each engine was investigated in a series of eight tests for the effect of seven parameters on oil consumption and blowby. This method of testing is shown to be efficient in surveying effects of test parameters. The factorial approach forces well-planned ex- periments, gives equal weight to each of the factors being studied, forces the experimenter to keep other factors constant, and produces results in an efficient manner.

Walter Cornelius, Donald L. Stivender and Robert E. Sullivan, Detroit Diesel Engine Div., GMC The combustion system developed for the General Motors GT-309 regenerative gas turbine is used to illustrate pertinent structural, performance, and exhaust emission considerations when designing for a vehicular gas turbine application. The development of each major component and the performance of the combustion system as a whole are reviewed. The satisfactory performance and durability potential of the GT-309 engine combustion system have been demonstrated by extensive operation in a component test facility and in several test cell and vehicle installed engines. Exhaust emissions of unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide are minimal and are of no concern from an air pollution standpoint. No objectionable exhaust smoking and odor are produced. As is the case with current spark-ignited and compression-ignition engines, the emissions of oxides of nitrogen in the present state of development do not satisfy the proposed 1970 California limit for this air pollutant on an equivalent weight flow basis.

To meet the ignition problems of gas turbines caused by wide variations in environment and the use of a multiplicity of fuels, a glow plug system has been developed which is proving very satisfactory. The system was developed with particular reference to the PT6 and ST6 gas turbines where, due to their small size, weight and size are of extreme importance. The glow plug system is extremely lightweight in comparison to spark systems suitable for gas turbines and relatively inexpensive. The ability of the glow plug to operate under extremes of 177</page><page sequence="115">670938-670945 conditions has been proved in many engine applications. It has also proved extremely durable over prior art. 670938. Gas Turbine Combustion of Ammonia. D. T. Pratt and E. S. Starkman, California University A theoretical and experimental study was undertaken to establish whether or not parametric correlations could be satisfactorily applied to combustion of ammonia in gas turbine combustors. It was found that a usual parameter of the form (chemical loading( X (Reynolds number raised to the 0.7 power) was satisfactory for establishing blowout limits in modeling. However, the attainable values of chemical loading were at least an order of magnitude less than those attainable with hydrocarbon fuels. SAE Transactions 670939. Corrosive Ring Wear - Does It Exist with Modern Lubricants and Ring Metallurgy?. Harvey Siegel and W. E. Partridge, Texaco, Inc. Piston-ring wear studies using an automotive engine and a radioactive wear measurement technique are presented to show the effects of compression ring face metallurgy and general lubricant composition on corrosive wear control. These results are correlated with those obtained in a single-cylinder laboratory engine. Results show that lubricant composition is not critical respecting corrosion when chromium-plated and molybdenum-filled com- pression rings are used, but is critical when plain cast-iron rings are used. Although wear for the molybdenum rings may be slightly higher than that for chromium rings, no service problems are anticipated. Discussion: W. E.

Thayer, III, Washington University Measurements were made of the rate of drying of lubricating oil on the cylinder wall of a cold running gasoline engine. Between jacket water temperatures of about 50-100 F drying rate was roughly constant, depending only on the rate of oil circulation to the cylinder. At lower temperatures the drying rate decreases. These results supply a means of estimating the rate of oil circulation to and from the cylinder wall. Conventional oil compounding holds water into the oil and as a result the oil remains wet during its stay on the cylinder. The possible relation of these observations to acid collection and engine wear is discussed. 670941. Aerodynamic Testing and Instrumentation of Components for Small Gas Turbines. R. L. Langton and R. E. V. Westerhout, United Aircraft of Canada The relative merits of the engine or rig approach to aerodynamic testing of components for small gas turbines are briefly discussed. Rigs were used to test a centrifugal compressor to 91,000 rpm, cold flow turbines to 37,000 rpm, and for development of a plenum-type exhaust duct. The latter two cases applied to the PT6 free turbine engine. Facility, instrumentation, and operating experience are covered. 670942. Modern Instrumentation Techniques in the Development of Fluidic and Hybrid Controls for Gas Turbine Engines. Jerome L. Johnson, Honeywell Inc. Fluidic sensors have been developed which possess the high response and environmental capability required for use in modern gas turbine engines. These new sensors enable new, more accurate instrumentation and control system through direct measurement of critical engine parameters. A description is made of four fluidic sensors and how their performance can be used to advantage in instrumentation and control system design.

The system involves the use of five process gas chromatographs to measure oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen, plus a hydrocarbon analyzer to determine unburned hydrocarbons. These measurements, in conjunction with other operating data, permit the 178</page><page sequence="116">670946-670953 calculation of overall combustor performance, as well as identification of local point-by-point conditions at the combustor exit.

Starkman, California Univer- sity; G. E. James, Boeing Co.; and H. K. Newhall, Wisconsin University Theoretical and experimental investigations were carried out for the purpose of predicting and measuring the performance which results from operation of compression ignition engines when anhydrous ammonia is used rather than diesel fuel. Predictions were that ammonia would give slightly increased output but fuel consumption would also increase 2 Vi fold. By equipping the engine with a spark-ignition system, it was possible to operate successfully on ammonia at normal compression ratios and retain the same fuel injection system. Fuel injection and spark timing were found to be critical. Indicated power output was reduced by about 10 percent, which differed from prediction. The discrepancy was due to the poor combustion characteristics of ammonia. Predicted increases in fuel consumption were experienced. Because ammonia is not "smoke limited" as is diesel fuel, it was possible to increase the smoke free output from the engine by going to richer mixtures with ammonia. SAE Transactions 670947. Combusion of Anhydrous Ammonia in Diesel Engines. Thomas J. Pearsall, Continental Aviation and Engrg. Corp.; and Charles G. Garabedian, Army Tank Automotive Command Two different approaches were used to adapt a compression-ignition engine to operate with anhydrous ammonia fuel. The first version was achieved by simply supplying ammonia vapor in the induction air system and using the fuel-injection system to furnish a pilot charge of diesel fuel for ignition purposes. The second version was a conversion to spark ignition. An attempt to inject liquid ammonia directly into a high compression ratio (30/1) engine was unsuccessful. SAE Transactions 670948. Study of Marginal Compression Ignition. C. M. Urban and J. T. Gray, Southwest Research Institute The effects of engine and fuel variables under marginal compression ignition conditions have been investigated as part of a comprehensive combustion program now in progress at the U.S. Army Fuels and Lubricants Res. Lab. To accomplish the program objectives it was first necessary to develop a suitable engine technique and several single-cylinder engine procedures were considered. The one chosen provided a means of quantitatively evaluating the marginal combustion performance of fuels with a degree of repeatability nearly equivalent to that of the ASTM cetane number procedure. Cursory studies with individual fuel components indicated that the heavier aromatics were the most detrimental to marginal combustion performance. 670949. Development of a Turbocharged Two-Stroke Twenty Cylinder Diesel Engine for Marine Application. James R. Ware, General Motors Corp., Electro-Motive Div. The selection of a firing order for a 2-stroke 20-cyl V diesel engine is reviewed. Effects of the firing order on crankshaft design and combustion are discussed. Also outlined are the application of a larger bore cylinder in the framework of an existing crankcase and the developments of piston, cylinder head, and crankcase needed to operate with the increased thermal and mechanical loading of the larger bore. The increased airflow provided by turbocharger modifications made possible a 20-cyl engine with marine rating of 3600 bhp. Means for multiple usage of this engine in vessels are suggested. 670950. Why Has the Medium-Speed Diesel Become Competitive in Marine Propulsion?. Wolfgang Hempel, Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nurnberg AG The market for powerplants to propel large merchant vessels has shown an increasing trend towards medium- speed geared units since 1965. An economic analysis determines the reasons why the medium-speed engine can complete with the slow-running, direct-propulsion, 2-stroke-cycle engine. The various influences on the types of cost are examined and the cost parameter range within which the medium-speed geared unit is competitive are marked out. An optimization analysis clarifies the cost advantages that will be provided by tomorrow's still larger medium-speed 4-stroke cycle diesels. 670952. U.S. Navy PGM-84 Class CODOG Propulsion Plant. Maurice R. Hauschildt and Charles L. Miller, Naval Ship Engrg. Center Two diesels and one jet engine are combined to power the United States Naval ships of the GH-84 class. A controllable-reversible pitch propeller provides the means of reversal. The marinization work necessary to adapt an aircraft jet engine for marine use is described. Although some operating problems have developed in the first few months of service, the concept provides great improv- ements over the characteristics available either with all diesel or all jet engine drive. 670953. Engine Selection and Rating for Military Ship Application. C. F. Perry, Naval Ship Engrg. Center The environment which surrounds the U.S. Navy marine powerplant installation is a major consideration in the 179</page><page sequence="117">670954-670959 selection and rating of diesel engines. Some of the Navy's efforts in identifying and minimizing the effects of influencing environmental forces are described. New evaluation, specification and procurement techniques are being studied to provide more positive controls over the influencing environmental forces. 670954. Turbine-Speed Pump for Vehicle Transmission Use. J. C. Swain and D. L. Thomas, Battelle Memorial Institute; and Walter Slabiak and H. A. Santo, Army Tank Automotive Command A turbine-speed, variable-displacement, high-pressure hydraulic pump is currently being developed at Battelle Memorial Institute under contract with the U.S. Army Tank- Automoti ve Command. This pump is intended to operate over a pressure range of 2000-8000 psi at constant power and will utilize conventional petroleum- base fluids. The basic concept is a small-diameter, 2-lobed vane pump capable of stepless variation in displacement. The pump is intended for possible use in land-vehicle transmission systems. It is anticipated that the pump will have efficiencies competitive with or exceeding con- ventional speed pumps, will be lighter and smaller, and can be driven at gas turbine speeds. Discussion: P.

Collet, Rover Gas Turbines Ltd. 3-shaft cycle turbine with a twin-spool compressor system is compared to a 2-shaft cycle with a variable geometry power turbine. Operating in a heavy commercial vehicle, the following engine parameters are considered: specific output power, fuel consumption, engine response, torque characteristics, and engine braking capability. The 3-shaft cycle showed an average improvement of 5 percent in sfc, a stall torque ratio of 3.8 versus 2.65 for the 2-shaft cycle, a potential increase in engine braking capability, and engine response consistent with the 2-shaft cycle.

J. L. Bame and J. S. Coon, Shell Oil Co. Results are presented showing that, through judicious choice of additive and base stock components, multigrade heavy-duty oils can be formulated to match the performance of single-grade oils with regard to cleanliness and durability. There are, however, a number of benefits inherent with multigrade heavy-duty oils because of their viscosity-temperature characteristics. Foremost among these is the ability of SAE 20W/40 oils to provide the improved starting characteristics of an SAE 20 W grade oil while maintaining the oil consumption control provided by an SAE 30 grade oil (note that it is SAE 40 grade at high temperature for only the first few hours of use). To the operator, this means decreased manpower requirements for cold-weather starting, decreased use of starting aids, increased unit availability, and longer battery and starter-motor life. Still another inherent benefit is improved fuel economy; gains range from essentially zero in warmed up line-haul operation to as much as about 10 percent in severe stop-and-go city operation where engines operate a significant percentage of the time at less than warmed up conditions. Discussion: W. E. Freed; Cummins Engine Co., Inc. SAE Transactions 670957. Filtration Experience with Highly Dispersant Diesel Engine Oils. P. I. Brown, Chevron Research Co. Some fleet operators feel that the use of highly dispersant nonfilterable oils will wear an engine out by carrying abrasives and other inorganic debris throughout the system. Laboratory and field test data are presented which show that the benefit of improved filter life obtainable with highly dispersant oils does not adversely affect control of abrasive wear in diesel engine service. 670958. Laboratory Engine Test for Gas Engine Oil Development. T. F. Lonstrup and J. W. Wilson, Imperial Oil Enterprises Ltd. A laboratory procedure for evaluating gas engine oils using a 6-cyl automotive engine is described. In additon to the usual engine cleanliness ratings and used oil inspections, the test method provides an accurate way for measuring wear. The test can also be used to establish used oil condemning limits. The authors conclude that a suitably modified automotive engine can be used as a development tool for gas engine oils.

Harald V. Heuser, Army Engr. Res. and Dev. Labs. An analog simulation is given of a turbo-alternator system used as a vehicle drive. As in an electrical vehicle drive system, the miles/dollar ratio is a critical consideration. The influence of a load scheduler on the economy of the turbine fuel consumption has been studied. It is shown that by utilizing this load scheduler as a proper sensor of the vehicle's power requirement and controlling the power output of the turbine, a considerable amount of fuel can be saved, especially when the vehicle is at rest and the turbine speed is governed at a lower idling level than its rated operating speed. Also, some general power and torque characteristics resulting from the simulation are given. 670961. Development of a Rapid Start System for the Boeing Model 502-2E Gas Turbine Engine. Lloyd E. Hull, Boeing Co.; and Harold A. Santo, Army Tank Automotive Command A rapid-start system has been developed for application to turbine engines when they are used to provide power boost on heavy tracked vehicles. During its development, laboratory tests were conducted on a Boeing 502-2E engine using a readily available impingement boost cranking system. These tests showed that rapid starting could be attained by applying high cranking torque without further engine modification, and provided data for the hydraulic system design finally chosen. The hydraulic system proved capable of achieving the 3-sec startup goal and also of reliably starting the engine at temperatures as low as -65 F. 670962. Diesel Lubricant Performance in Highway Truck and City Coach Service. J. G. Brandes, Detroit Diesel Engine Div., General Motors Corp. One experimental and 12 commercial diesel crankcase oils of various industry-accepted performance levels were evaluated in highway truck and city coach service. The oil performance parameters evaluated showed that SAE-30, MIL-L-2104B lubricants, as a family of commercial oils, gave better performance than MIL-L-2104A, Supplement 1, Series 3 or multigrade products. Multigrade oils gave very poor performance in both service applications. The results of these two related programs influenced the engine manufacturers decision to recommend MIL- L-2104B oils. 670963. Lubricants for European Diesel Engines - Automotive and Industrial. W. A. Cox and J. K. Lock, British Petroleum Co. Ltd. In Western Europe, there is a large and growing number of diesel engines used in commercial vehicles, agricultural tractors, and industrial and marine applications. The paper reviews these engines and their lubricant require- ments. Consideration is given to the relevance of internationally accepted lubricant specifications in fulfilling these requirements and the inadequacies of these specifications are discussed. An attempt is made to forecast future trends in lubricant quality. Discussion: I. Glover; Lubrizol International Labs.; authors* closure SAE Transactions 670964. New HD Oils. Donald R. Harsell and Alan A. Schetelich, Enjay Chemical Co. The formulation of oils for heavy-duty diesel engine operation is a field on the threshold of change after years of conventional appearance. Oil companies now formulate very versatile heavy-duty oils - some multi- graded, some low ash - meeting the most severe requirements for passenger-car performance as well as meeting the newest heavy-duty diesel engine requirements. This paper presents the nature and the performance of these new heavy-duty diesel oils. 670965. Application and Operation of the LM100 Gas Turbine Engine in Bell Sk-5 Hovercraft. T. E. Coppinger, General Electric Co. The LM100 marine powerplant is a derivative of the T 58 turbo-shaft engine, the experience and maturity of which have been immediately valuable to the marine and industrial version. Some of the advantages of the LM100 discussed in this paper are its compactness, low specific fuel consumption, quick starting ability over a wide range of temperatures, and ability to withstand shock. 670966. Initial Applications of the Orenda OT-4 Recuperated Gas Turbine. G. C. Best, Orenda Ltd. Development of a 600-hp twin-shaft gas turbine with plate-fin recuperators has been proceeding successfully through the component and engine factory test phases. Since there has been no prior field experience with this type of engine, the need for prototype engine operation in representative installations is greater than usual. Experience to date with the design, assembly, and initial operation of the turbine in Army experimental tracked vehicles, a minesweeper, and a highway tractor is described. 670967.

Gas Turbine Engines Applied to Passenger Trains. Thomas R. Wheaton, United Aircraft Corporate Systems Center The free turbine engine, because of its light weight, compactness, and inherent torque characteristics, permits the design of a new type of passenger train with light weight, high performance, and good economy.
