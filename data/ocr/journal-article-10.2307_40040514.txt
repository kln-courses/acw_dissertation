As much as information today determines the contemporary wealth of nations,1 the physical world retains its relevance. Even though firms in today's technology-driven economy derive much of their value from information and other "intangible resources,"2 physical determinants of productivity remain critical.3 Architecture affects crime rates,4 arguably even collegiality among law professors.5 Paradoxically, place may assume greater value in an 1.

"Place has become the central organizing unit of our time, taking on many of the functions that used to be played by firms and other organizations."6 The interplay between the physical and the ethereal likewise shapes the constitutional doctrine that facilitates the free flow of ideas. "Physical settings shape expressive practices and expectations."7 The structure of a communicative medium virtually dictates its performance.8 Wealth transfers within the new economy prompt "new efforts by the government to intervene in the marketplace to favor a particular outcome," and in due course courts will entertain "new constitutional claims" arising within the political economy of modern communications.9 Awareness of the structure of information markets improves the calibration of intellectual property and refines legal responses to potential electronic bottlenecks.10 This Article takes the next logical step: revealing the deep doctrinal structure of legal efforts to influence the design and maintenance of communicative conduits. To facilitate this Article's examination of free speech jurisprudence, Part I describes how any communicative medium can be visualized as three distinct physical, logical, and content-based layers. End-to-end design, the Internet's operative ideal, illustrates how logical architecture affects network performance and how the law in turn shapes architecture.

Free Speech Jurisprudence, End-to-End The structure of any communications conduit reflects the tripartite division of human enterprise between production, transmission, and distribution. Implicit in the structure of the Internet, among other conduits, is the end-to-end principle. By simplifying communicative protocols, end-to-end design drives all intelligence within a network toward its edges, where speakers generate ideas and audiences respond. Free speech jurisprudence should be understood as operating within physical, logical, and content layers. Section A elaborates the three- layered structure of the Internet. Section B shows how the law of free speech falls into three corresponding layers. A, The Internet as Developmental Parable Industria est omnia divisa en tres partes.12 Virtually every industry in an age of mass production and consumption, "like ancient Gaul, is divided into three parts": production, wholesale transmission, and retail distribution.13 What is true of chrysanthemums14 and "the flow of wheat from the West to the mills and distributing points of the East"15 applies with greater force to electronic networks.16 12.

Network architecture dictates how speakers and listeners interact. Every conduit consists of a physical layer, a logical (or code) layer, and a content layer.17 The physical layer of the Internet consists of network infrastructure. Common logical protocols within a packet-switched, interconnected network transforms the physical Internet into "a unique medium . . . located in no particular geographic location but available to anyone, anywhere in the world."18 Atop lies a rich content layer, the fertile output of the "most participatory form of mass speech yet developed."19 Rife with "material about topics ranging from aardvarks to Zoroastrianism,"20 that content "is as diverse as human thought."21 Standard accounts of economic development describe property as the engine of growth.22 In an information-driven economy, intangible property plays the heroic role of spurring innovation.23 But closer examination reveals the modest contribution of intellectual property to the Internet's inventive potential, at least relative to the network's open [I]n the use of wires and pipes to get power and light and fuel into the service of ultimate consumers, there is a trinitarian fusing of what in the case of chattels embraces three distinct operations: (1) making; (2) going to market; and (3) selling in packages suitable to the needs of individual customers. cf.

At the heart of the Internet lies its operating ideal, the end-to-end principle.27 End-to-end architecture seeks to accomplish two related goals. First, the higher-level layers, "more specific to an application, are free ... to organize lower-level network resources to achieve application-specific design goals efficiently."28 By contrast, "[ljower- level layers, which support many independent applications, should provide only resources of broad utility across applications," while enabling applications throughout the network to share resources and resolve conflicts over resources.29 End-to-end design places a network's "intelligence" at its ends while keeping all intervening protocols as simple and general as possible. Providers and consumers of content may express themselves creatively, whereas the network itself is "stupid."30 The resemblance to parsimonious computer programming is unmistakable. "By keeping the network simple, and its interaction general, the Internet has facilitated the design of unanticipated applications such as "Internet telephony, 24.

It is a guarantee . . . that innovation will be rewarded if the innovation is one that markets respect."32 The absence of a "centralized distribution point" makes it difficult for "network operators or government regulators" to "stifle independent information sources."33 The "abundance generated by ... an open-access network eliminates one of the key First Amendment diversity difficulties found in mass media."34 That the Internet currently strives to maintain the end-to-end ideal does not mean that every conduit naturally achieves this streamlined architecture. The debate over the application vel non of real property doctrines to Internet traffic35 fiercely disputes whether access to websites should be governed by a rule sounding of nuisance within a commons,36 or, alternatively, whether "a rule of consent supported by judicial injunctions" should constitute the "default rule" for "access to websites and proprietary networks connected to the Internet."37 Neither end-to- end nor proprietary design arises without deliberate legal 31.

That potential in every other setting attracts serious judicial attention. It also warrants a closer look at the logic of free speech jurisprudence. B. A New Hope for Free Speech Jurisprudence One can condense American constitutional law into a struggle to reconcile two standards of review articulated in the early years of the Republic.42 One standard prescribes deference to legislative prerogatives; the other calls for strict scrutiny of suspect laws.43 The former standard operates as a rubber stamp;44 the latter is "'strict' in theory" but "fatal in fact."45 Real confusion arises when the Supreme Court attempts to bridge these extremes. 38.

Insofar as the logical layer in communications intercedes between physical infrastructure and ultimate expression, regulation of that layer combines an official interest in resource allocation with an interest in content. Logical layer cases oscillate between the relatively skeptical attitude toward content- based regulation and the comparatively deferential approach to laws affecting the time, place, or manner of speech. This facile jurisprudential taxonomy begs a critical question: which decisions comprise the logical layer? Contemporary communications analysis treats "code" as synonymous with the logical layer. And "code" in real space consists of the "constitutions, statutes, and other legal" prescriptions that shape human conduct.79 Any expressive "medium" consists of the "set of social conventions and practices shared by speakers and audience."80 The logical layer of free speech jurisprudence comprises controversies in which the law structures the use of a 452 U.S. 640, 648 (1981) (addressing whether a state fair can require individuals "to confine their distribution, sales, and solicitation activities to a fixed location"). 76.

Content-based restrictions that would receive withering scrutiny in any other setting (especially in print media) suddenly enjoy greater vitality if portrayed as conduit- based regulation. To the extent that the entire First Amendment corpus can be recharacterized either as content-based or as content-neutral - after all, laws assertedly directed to "values unrelated to communication, such as noise, congestion, property, aesthetics, or privacy," ultimately "have information effects" insofar as they "affect what gets said, by whom, to whom, and with what effect"90 - the concept of conduit-based regulation provides merely another channel by which (1984) ("The lawmakers reasoned that if too many stations used the [spectrum] at once, radio signals would become garbled and communication would be impossible.").

Alas, either of these George Lucas creations would aptly symbolize the logical layer cases. In addressing these logical layer cases, this Article will tackle the daunting task of translating from Hutt or Jar Jar Speaks into English. II. The Logical Layer of Free Speech Jurisprudence Cases contesting conduit-based regulation of speech have varied, as one might expect, by conduit. As of 1978, when William Van Alstyne wrote The Mobius Strip of the First Amendment, this jurisprudential "logical layer" consisted almost entirely of cases involving broadcasting. The intervening quarter-century has confounded the Supreme Court's views of conduit-based regulation. This Article will now examine the logical layer cases in three conduits: broadcasting, cable, and the Internet. A. Broadcasting's Special Constitutional Status Courts routinely use technological changes to dilute constitutional protection for speech in a new conduit. At a minimum, "differences in the characteristics of new media justify differences in the First Amendment standards applied to them."104 Justice Jackson proclaimed that each conduit "is a law unto itself": "The moving picture screen, the radio, the newspaper, the handbill, the sound truck and the street corner orator have differing natures, values, abuses and dangers."105 Justice Kennedy has advocated analyzing laws affecting new conduits "by reference to existing elaborations of constant First Amendment principles."106 This habit has proved surprisingly durable. In conduit- based controversies, courts often try to derive "the operative metaphor for freedom of speech" from "an appropriate analogy for the superficiality, its internal incoherence, [and] its distressing failure to facilitate constructive judicial engagement with significant contemporary social issues"). 104.

FCC"0 the 1969 decision that upheld a federal right-of-reply regime within broadcasting. To begin an examination of broadcasting's special status with Red Lion, however, is to neglect more than a quarter-century of constitutional history. In the 1940s, the FCC recognized that an increasing amount of programming was not locally produced, but "transmitted by wire . . . from their point of origination" by a national syndicate "to each station in the network for simultaneous broadcast."111 The FCC's "chain broadcasting" rules112 eventually evolved into longstanding rules regarding network affiliation113 and station ownership,114 territorial exclusivity,115 the division of the broadcast day,116 and network influence over programming and advertising.117 In National Broadcasting Co. v.

In rejecting the network's First Amendment challenge, Justice Frankfurter reasoned: "Freedom of utterance is abridged to many who use the limited facilities of radio. Unlike other modes of expression, radio inherently is not available to all. That is its unique characteristic, and that is why, unlike other modes of expression, it is subject to governmental regulation."122 Characterizing "[t]he facilities of radio [as] limited and therefore precious," NBC concluded that spectrum "cannot be left to wasteful use without detriment to the public interest."123 If any decision deserves credit as the origin of conduit-based regulation's "scarcity" rationale, it is NBC and not Red Lion. In strictly doctrinal terms, Red Lion represents a modest extension of NBC. Yet Red Lion's greater prominence vis-d-vis NBC is readily understood. Whereas NBC involved the degree of vertical integration and coordination in which a network could engage with local affiliates, Red Lion targeted expressive, editorial decisions by broadcasters. The rules in Red Lion subjected broadcasters to "broad rights of access for 119. Id. at 226. 120. The rule against dual network operation, 47 C.F.R.

Because of spectrum's physical limits, the Court surmised, "only a tiny fraction of those with resources and intelligence can hope to communicate by radio at the same time."129 Thereupon the Court recited the classic formulation of the scarcity rationale: "Where there are substantially more individuals who want to broadcast than there are frequencies to allocate, it is idle to posit an unabridgeable First Amendment right to broadcast comparable to the right of every individual to speak, write, or publish."130 Although the FCC abandoned the personal attack and political editorializing rules in the late 1980s,131 the scarcity rationale endures.

NBC acknowledged that the chain broadcasting rules transcended mere "supervision of [broadcast] traffic"; they effectively "determined] the composition of that traffic."142 Altering broadcast content, however coarsely or subtly, is the raison d'etre of structural regulation. For example, expected differences in content were the only justifications for the affirmative action policies in Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCCU3 and Lamprecht v. FCC.144 Metro Broadcasting upheld race-conscious comparative licensing and distress sale policies on the assumption that a "broadcasting industry with representative minority participation will produce more variation and diversity than will one whose ownership is drawn from a single racially and ethnically homogeneous group."145 Lamprecht struck down comparable rules designed to increase female ownership and participation.146 Red Lion, by contrast, involved a far more direct restraint on editorial freedom. In the abstract, it is hard to gauge whether NBC or Red Lion upheld the more aggressive program. Although comprehensive structural restraints are arguably more confining than an overtly content-based set of rules targeting an isolated set of editorial practices, NBC suggested that structural regulation warrants less concern. That case, and not Red Lion, established the federal government's greater discretion to regulate horizontal and vertical integration in broadcasting, relative to the same economic phenomena in other media markets. NBC so thoroughly sanctified the federal government's 141.

National Citizens Committee for Broadcasting (NCCB)148 embraced NBCs deferential posture toward structural regulation of broadcasting. NCCB upheld the FCC's ban on "common ownership of a radio or television broadcast station and a daily newspaper located in the same community."149 After extolling the need to regulate a market whose "finite . . . frequencies" are "far exceeded by the number of persons wishing to broadcast," the Supreme Court blessed the allocation of "licenses so as to promote the 'public interest' in diversification of the mass communications media."150 The Court cited both NBC and Red Lion'51 even though NCCB's cross- ownership rule much more closely resembled NBCs chain broadcasting rules than Red Lion's fairness doctrine. NCCB emphasized that its deferential approach would insulate efforts to '"enhanc[e] the volume and quality of coverage' of public issues" in broadcasting, but not necessarily "similar efforts to regulate the print media."152 Despite conceding that "'the issue . . . would be wholly different' if 'the Commission [were] to choose among applicants upon the basis of their political, economic or social views,'" NCCB flatly denied that the cross-ownership ban was "content related."153 Averring that the cross-ownership restrictions would "promote free speech, not . . . restrict it,"154 the Court asserted that the ban and broadcast licensing at large "preserve^ the interests of the 'people as a whole . . . in free speech.'"155 NCCB even praised structural regulation as a noncensorial means for "'enhancing] the diversity of information heard 147.

Red Lion recognized the technologically volatile nature of scarcity. Well before Red Lion, the Supreme Court had identified the "rapidly fluctuating" and "dynamic [field] of radio transmission"157 as "a field of enterprise [whose] dominant characteristic" has been "the rapid pace of its unfolding."158 "Advances in technology," Red Lion acknowledged, "have led to more efficient utilization of the frequency spectrum, but uses for that spectrum have also grown apace."159 Improvements in consumer electronics substitute for spectrum by allowing stations to operate at closer frequencies and lower power.160 Today the average household can receive thirteen conventional television signals.161 Mindful of "[t]he rapidity with which technological advances succeed one another to create more efficient use of spectrum space on the one hand, and to create new uses for that space by ever growing numbers of people on the other," Red Lion thought it "unwise to speculate on the future allocation of that space."162 The past four decades have fulfilled Justice Douglas's interrelated prophecies that "television viewers" would enjoy at least "400 channels through the advances of cable television" and that scarcity would become a "constraint of the past."163 Red Lion apparently tried to confine its analysis to the technological context of broadcasting circa 1969.

Cable as Broadcasting's Economic and Legal Rival In Red Lion's immediate wake, the jurisprudence of conduit-based regulation focused on cable television. Despite its origins as a technology for extending broadcast television into "remote or mountainous communities," cable became a formidable competitive threat.167 In the late 1960s, the FCC asserted jurisdiction over cable in order to stem the flow of viewers and revenues away from UHF and educational stations. Failing to anticipate that much UHF bandwidth would "sit[] around for years collecting electromagnetic dust,"168 Congress buttressed the FCC's localism policy by entertaining its own proposals to curb cable's "'unregulated explosive growth.'"169 These policies clashed in the 1968 case of United States v. Southwestern Cable Co,110 Decided one year before Red Lion, Southwestern Cable held that statutory jurisdiction over "'all interstate and foreign communication by wire or radio'" permitted the FCC to regulate cable.171 The Court openly endorsed the Commission's objective of preserving UHF and educational stations as the 165.

It remained unclear whether cable operators might enjoy the rights enjoyed by print publishers under Tornillo, as opposed to broadcasters' more restricted rights under Red Lion. In theory, the Supreme Court could have elevated both broadcasters and cable operators to Tornillo's more generous level of protection. The Court acknowledged in 1979 that "[cjable operators . . . share with broadcasters a significant amount of editorial discretion" over programming.174 In 1986 the Court conceded that cable "plainly implicate^] First Amendment interests" and that the production of "original programming" and the exercise of "editorial discretion over . . . stations or programs" enable a cable operator "to communicate messages on a wide variety of topics and in a wide variety of formats."175 The Court nevertheless declined to embrace any specific standard of review.176 A contemporaneous trilogy of tax cases, however, had already unleashed Red Lion in cable's realm. The 1983 case of Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune Co, v. Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue111 invalidated an ink-and-paper tax aimed at the print media, as distinct from other businesses.178 The Court condemned exemptions that placed the onus of this tax on the state's largest newspapers.179 Four years later, Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v.

In Leathers v. Medlock,190 Arkansas taxed cable services while exempting "newspapers, magazines, and satellite broadcast services."191 The Court rejected a cable operator's claim of "intermedia and intramedia discrimination,"192 having found no evidence that "the tax [was] directed at, or present [ed] the danger of suppressing, particular ideas."193 By failing to distinguish "the information service provided by cable . . . from the information services provided by Arkansas' newspapers, magazines, television broadcasters, and radio stations,"194 Leathers invited the very distinction that separated broadcasters in Red Lion from print journalists in Tornillo. By the 1990s, cable television emerged as "UHF's savior rather than its scourge" by finally giving UHF stations "technical parity with VHF stations."195 As a legal matter, however, the Supreme Court stopped short of equating cable with broadcasting. In the first of two cases named Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC,196 both involving a requirement that cable operators transmit the signals of broadcasters requesting carriage, the Court reasoned that its "distinct approach" to broadcasting rests on that medium's "unique physical limitations."197 Turner I distinguished Red Lion and other broadcasting cases because cable "does not suffer from the inherent limitations that characterize 188.

"Given cable's long history of serving as a conduit for broadcast signals," the Court observed, "there appears little risk that cable viewers would assume that the broadcast stations carried on a cable system convey ideas or messages endorsed by the cable operator."203 The Court placed even greater weight on "an important technological difference": whereas a "daily newspaper . . . does not possess the power to obstruct readers' access to other competing publications," the "physical connection between the television set and the cable network gives the cable operator bottleneck, or gatekeeper, control over most (if not all) of the television programming that is channeled into the subscriber's home."204 In 1997 the Supreme Court reconsidered must-carry.205 Whereas "the state of the record" in Turner I confined the Court to assessing the government's interests solely "'in the abstract,'" an "expanded record" enabled Turner II "to consider whether the must-carry provisions were designed to address a real harm, and whether those provisions will alleviate it in a material way."206 The Court found that Congress had garnered "specific support for its conclusion that cable operators had 198.

FCC.210 No fewer than five opinions advocated distinct approaches to First Amendment review within a new conduit. None commanded a majority. Section 10(a) of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992211 permitted a cable operator to prohibit sexually explicit programming on leased access channels.212 Section 10(c) granted an operator the same power over public access channels.213 Section 10(b) required operators to segregate sexual explicit programming on leased access channels, block it presumptively, and unblock it upon subscriber request.214 Six Justices agreed that section 10(b)'s "segregate and block" requirements failed strict scrutiny in light of less speech-restrictive means for filtering sexually oriented programming. Three Justices, led by Justice Breyer, voted to uphold section 10(a) under Turner Fs intermediate scrutiny standard; a coalition led by Justice Thomas supplied three additional votes under a strict scrutiny approach. Justice Breyer, joined by two other Justices, also used Turner Fs intermediate scrutiny test to invalidate section 10(c).

Condemning the "doctrinal wasteland" to which the Court had consigned cable operators, Justice Thomas suggested "that cable operators should enjoy the same First Amendment rights as the nonbroadcast media."225 He throttled Red Lion's dictum that "'[i]t is the right of the viewers and listeners, not the right of the broadcasters, which is paramount.'"226 Concluding that Turner I had undermined Red Lion's emphasis on "the rights of viewers," Justice Thomas declared that "[i]t is the [cable] operator's right that is preeminent."227 G The Naked and the Lewd: Content-Based Regulation Online The Turner cases and Denver plunged free speech doctrine into chaos. Yet the resulting "clash of doctrines is not a disaster - it is an opportunity."228 Indeed, subsequent cases have hinted at a promising solution. The key lies in the contrast between conduit-based and content-based regulation. Recent cases adjust First Amendment review according to whether the law targets content, focuses solely on the physical context of speech, or straddles these worlds by controlling the legal operations of a particular conduit.229 The direction of policy "in electronic media cases" is arguably "driven by a renewed concern for access interests, rather than indecency issues."230 As a matter of doctrinal development, though, the reverse is true. Almost all of the decisions regarding conduit-based regulation of the Internet have involved sexually explicit but nonobscene speech. Speech of this sort warrants constitutional protection.231 As a "great and 224.

Reno v. ACLU251 the first of the Supreme Court's Internet-specific free speech controversies, not only invalidated the CDA as a transparent assault on speech but also reinstated Red Lion's multifaceted approach. Reno held that the Internet lacked three key features that justified broadcasting's deferential First Amendment standard: "the history of extensive Government regulation of the broadcast medium; the scarcity of available frequencies at its inception; and [broadcasting's] 'invasive' nature."252 Justice Stevens observed that "the vast democratic forums of the Internet" have never "been subject to the type of government supervision and regulation that has attended the broadcast industry."253 In light of this medium's relative freedom from regulation, he detected no risk that users "might infer some sort of official or societal approval of" online content.254 He also noted that "the Internet is not as 'invasive' as radio or television."255 "Finally," Justice Stevens added, "unlike the conditions that prevailed when Congress first authorized regulation of the broadcast spectrum, the Internet can hardly be considered a 'scarce' expressive commodity."256 In 2000, the Court got a chance to reconcile Reno with Denver and the Turner cases. United States v.

Justice Thomas concluded that Congress could place '"the burden of complying with [its] prohibition on obscene messages'" upon a producer of online speech reaching "different communities with different local standards."273 Concurring in the judgment, Justice Kennedy again insisted that the "unique characteristics" and "distinct attributes" of "each mode of expression" should guide First Amendment analysis.274 In a stark departure from Turner /, however, Justice Kennedy emphasized factors beyond physical scarcity. "The economics and the technology of each medium," he wrote, "affect both the burden of a speech restriction and the Government's interest in maintaining it."275 Rejecting Justice Thomas's reliance on Hamling and Sable, Justice Kennedy stressed that "[t]he economics and technology of Internet communication differ in important ways from those of telephones and mail."276 "Paradoxically," he observed, "it is easy and cheap to reach a worldwide audience on the Internet, but expensive if not impossible to reach a geographic subset."277 Unlike mail and telephony, regulating Internet speech without regard to "national variation in community standards" would impose an unacceptable burden.278 Justice O'Connor likewise disputed the plurality's use of Hamling and Sable.

The shift between Ashcroft I and // from a facial attack to a preliminary injunction markedly favored COPA's foes. Characterizing COPA as overtly content-based regulation, Ashcroft II readily imposed strict scrutiny.288 Because the government bore "the burden of proof on the ultimate question of COPA's constitutionality," the injunction would stand as long as COPA's challengers could establish at least one "plausible, less restrictive alternative]]."289 Writing for the same coalition of five that decided Playboy,290 Justice Kennedy concluded that "[blocking and filtering software is ... less restrictive than COPA, and, in addition, likely more effective as a means of restricting children's access."291 Justice Kennedy praised filters for imposing "selective restrictions on speech at the receiving end, not universal restrictions at the source."292 He speculated that filters might be "more effective than COPA," insofar as filters operate without regard to geography and cover "all forms of Internet communication, including e-mail."293 Justice Kennedy drew an explicit comparison to Playboy, Both Playboy and Ashcroft II, he wrote, "involved a content-based restriction 286.

For example, the ratings system mandated by the Telecommunications Act of 1996299 undermines any comprehensive ban on indecency within any conduit able to exploit the V-chip.300 Indeed, the development and diffusion of "[u]ser-control technologies" should have the effect of invalidating all "intrusive government restrictions."301 294. 124S.Ct.at2793. 295.

Contrary to its caricature as the origin of a senseless "scarcity" rationale, Red Lion in fact articulates almost all of the rationales invoked in examinations of legislative efforts to structure a specific conduit. Section B will dissect Red Lion's three interrelated rationales: scarcity, enhancement of underrepresented voices, and overall regulatory context. Section C will examine a factor added by later decisions: the social meaning that emerges from a conduit's pervasiveness. Matthew L.

In many settings, technological innovation demands reinterpretation of the Constitution. Even originalist theories accommodate "technological changes."317 Mindful of the government's ability to exploit "[sjubtler and more far-reaching" technologies,318 the Supreme Court monitors how "the advance of technology" may affect "the degree of privacy secured to citizens by the Fourth Amendment."319 Wary of "leav[ing] the homeowner at the mercy of advancing technology," the Court considers not only "relatively crude" technology in use, but also "more sophisticated systems ... in development."320 314.

What Chief Justice Warren observed with respect to "the television camera" applies equally to Fourth and First Amendment liberties: "technological innovations [are] not entitled to pervade the lives of everyone in disregard of constitutionally protected rights."321 The special status of technological innovation as "a singularly uncontroversial justification for modifying established doctrine" warrants heightened vigilance.322 Far from embracing new channels of expression, lawmakers routinely respond to unfamiliar technologies by suppressing them. Putative "technologies of freedom"323 could in fact represent the First Amendment's "Trojan horse."324 Armed with Red Lion's declaration that "differences in the characteristics of new media justify differences in the First Amendment standards applied to them,"325 courts routinely exploit technological differences between older and newer modes of communication in calibrating constitutional protection within the newer medium.326 It is unclear whether systematic reliance "on reference points provided by older, established technologies" has advanced the constitutional understanding of conduit-based regulation.327 A jurisprudential engine fueled so heavily by "principles operating at a low or intermediate level of abstraction" is bound to yield "incompletely theorized judgments."328 (criticizing the overuse of technology-based arguments in contemporary Fourth Amendment jurisprudence); Marc Jonathan Blitz, Video Surveillance and the Constitution of Public Space: Fitting the Fourth Amendment to a World that Tracks Image and Identity, 82 TEX.

Given the doctrinal baseline for content-based regulation - strict scrutiny absent affirmative debasement of the speech at issue - Red Lion's invitation to examine "the characteristics of new media" represents a one-way, downward ratchet.330 As Red Lion itself illustrated, invoking a conduit-specific approach to the First Amendment tends, perhaps inexorably, to degrade constitutional protection for speech. Throughout the logical layer of free speech jurisprudence, judicial consideration of a conduit's traits rarely if ever enhances constitutional protection. In United States v. American Library Association, Inc.,331 for instance, parties challenged the Children's Internet Protection Act's requirement that libraries install filtering software on Internet access terminals as a condition of federal funding.332 A plurality of Justices rejected the argument that Internet access converts a public library into "a 'designated public forum'" enjoying heightened protection against governmental restrictions on the time, place, and manner of speech.333 According to Chief Justice Rehnquist, a library "provides Internet access, not to 'encourage a diversity of views from private speakers,' but ... to facilitate research, learning and recreational pursuits by furnishing materials of requisite and appropriate quality."334 The Chief Justice echoed the Senate's sentiment that the Internet was nothing "'more than a technological extension of the book stack.'"335 329.

The opinion's concluding paragraph and footnote identify three interrelated rationales. In addition to "the scarcity of broadcast frequencies," the Court cited two distinct factors counseling judicial acquiescence in the regulation of broadcasting: "the Government's role in allocating those frequencies, and the legitimate claims of those unable without governmental assistance to gain access to those frequencies for expression of their views."336 Red Lion also presented two intriguing "related argument [s]" beyond the admittedly temporary "technological scarcity of frequencies."337 First, the Court acknowledged that legally induced "economic scarcity" arising from actual or potential "limit[s] [on] entry to the broadcasting market" might justify "the fairness doctrine or its equivalent" on behalf "of those excluded" from the airwaves.338 Other passages plainly reveal the Court's awareness that scarcity in broadcasting was a technologically volatile phenomenon. Red Lion took pains to confine its holding to the state of communications technology as of 1969.339 Second, the Court hinted that it might uphold "legislation [that] directly or indirectly multiplies] the voices and views presented to the public through . . . devices which limit or dissipate the power of those who sit astride the channels of communication with the general public."340 Careful exegesis of Red Lion therefore reveals no fewer than three distinct justifications for tailoring First Amendment protection by conduit. First, a nuanced understanding of scarcity and its technological context might justify governmental intervention. Second, the history and thoroughness of regulation may warrant greater deference to the legislative structuring of a conduit. Third, a conduit's vulnerability to monopolization may merit official efforts to mute louder voices so that softer ones might be heard. Cases after Red Lion supplied a fourth rationale: some media are "uniquely pervasive," able without warning 336. Red Lion Broad. Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 400 (1969). 337. Mat401n.28. 338. Id. 339.

Pacifica Foundation,342 upheld the FCC's power over the timing of potentially offensive broadcasts such as George Carlin's "Filthy Words" routine without relying "on the notion of 'spectrum scarcity.'"343 Red Lion, as it turns out, came dangerously close to articulating a comprehensive (if not altogether coherent or credible) theory on conduit-based regulation of speech. Aside from an inchoate expression of enhancement theory and a failure to anticipate pervasiveness, its justifications conform quite closely to the multifaceted approach that the Supreme Court would eventually summarize in 1997: "the history of extensive Government regulation," "the scarcity of available" avenues for expression, and the contested medium's "'invasive' nature."344 The First Amendment jurisprudence of conduit-based regulation therefore hinges on four interrelated rationales: scarcity, regulatory context, enhancement, and pervasiveness. The remaining sections of Part III will assess these rationales in turn. Section B will address scarcity, regulation, and enhancement as interrelated phenomena. Section C will examine pervasiveness. 5. Enhancing the Legal Understanding of Rivalrousness and Regulation 1. Enhancement theory. Among the rationales marshaled in defense of conduit-based regulation, the so-called "enhancement theory" is the easiest to dismiss. First Amendment jurisprudence has struggled mightily with the urge to enhance the voices of the "many people who have ideas . . . but who do not have enough money to own or control publishing plants, newspapers, radios, moving picture studios, or chains of show places."345 Congressman Charles E.

The Supreme Court's frequent observation that "the broadcast media pose unique and special problems not present in the traditional free speech case"357 allows the enhancement theory to flourish within broadcast regulation. The limited nature of spectrum putatively justifies an aggressive federal role in "securing] a reasonable equality of opportunity in radio."358 In the clearest endorsement of enhancement theory, NCCB declared that "'"efforts to enhance the volume and quality of coverage" of public issues' through regulation of broadcasting may be permissible where similar efforts to regulate the 352.

As Part FV.A shows, lower court decisions involving structural regulation of communications have consistently confined NCCB to broadcasting. Cases involving must-carry obligations and ownership restrictions in nonbroadcast media have applied a tougher brand of scrutiny. NCCB therefore provides no firm support for the proposition that enhancement theory pervades the jurisprudence of conduit-based regulation. Confining this deviant theory to a single, historically circumscribed setting merely isolates the law of broadcasting as an aberrant branch of First Amendment jurisprudence. Rejecting enhancement theory does not resolve the yearning for greater competition in the marketplace of ideas. The "great fear" that motivates the jurisprudence of conduit-based regulation is "a fear not of one but of many."360 This body of law embodies a concern that uncoordinated speech markets would drown in a "cacophony of competing voices, none of which [can] be clearly and predictably heard."361 The challenge lies in reconciling this anxiety with the "profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open,"362 with "the assumption that the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources is essential to the welfare of the public."363 359.

First Amendment doctrine presumptively rejects enhancement as antithetical to self- governance through the free flow of ideas. That presumption has historically been reversed, or at least suspended, in the context of broadcasting facilities whose peculiar scarcity supposedly warrants a deviant approach. If the scarcity rationale collapses, either with respect to broadcasting or across a diverse range of conduits, its fall similarly dooms enhancement theory. 2. Scarcity as rivalrousness and the government's regulatory response. The contradictions of enhancement theory therefore demand a more careful definition of "scarcity." Scarcity in the sense of rivalrousness is not equivalent to the economic definition of scarcity as a constraint on consumer choice. The latter notion of scarcity, as "a universal fact, . . . can hardly explain regulation in one context and not another," let alone "justif[y] content regulation of broadcasting in a way that would be intolerable if applied to ... the print media."364 Because "[a]ll economic goods are scarce," not "everyone who wishes to publish a newspaper . . . may do so."365 Invoking scarcity in this sense represents at best an exercise in spurious market definition. Not only is scarcity universal; it is marvelously contingent and elastic. Any technologically driven expansion in available channels of communication can defeat a claim of scarcity. Absent a convincing demonstration of "physical interference," the government lacks "an essential precondition" that might otherwise justify "an umpiring role."366 Clarifying the scarcity rationale begins with a careful distinction between rivalrous and nonrivalrous resources.367 In stark contrast with the rivalrous nature of most tangible goods, whereby gainful use by one party leads directly to another party's loss, use of a nonrivalrous good "by one entity does not necessarily diminish the use and enjoyment of 364.

"[EJvery transmitter creates some interference": whenever a consumer "uses a cordless telephone, or even turns on a light," the resulting emission of energy creates some "interference for nearby users of nearby frequencies."370 Because simultaneous use of spectrum is inescapably rivalrous, "organizing that resource within a system of control makes good sense."371 Within broadcasting, that system consists of a "regulatory mechanism to divide the electromagnetic spectrum and assign specific frequencies to particular broadcasters."372 The constitutional significance of the "limited" availability of "radio facilities" cannot be distinguished from the regulatory interest in preventing "the confusion that would result from interferences" among competing uses of spectrum.373 What the jurisprudence of conduit-based regulation has called scarcity is better understood as rivalrousness, which justifies governmental efforts to dismantle barriers to competition and freedom of movement within the marketplace of ideas. So rehabilitated, the scarcity rationale even restores a hint of enhancement theory: "The logic of the scarcity rationale is that there are not enough opportunities for speakers to express themselves, and that the government has a role to play in ensuring that these limited opportunities be put to the most valuable uses for society."374 If nothing else, broadcast licensing's awareness of rivalrousness boasts a long legal pedigree.

The Ashbacker right to comparative licensing proceedings eases a conflict created by the law itself:377 the decision to award any license precludes another broadcaster from using the same frequency in the same locality.378 Although alternatives to licensing, such as auctions379 or common law resolution of claims by "spectrum squatters,"380 would offer different solutions to rivalrousness, they could never cure the mutual exclusivity of competing uses.

Reliance on the common law would require nonexpert, generalist courts to perform the same task, ex post rather than ex ante. This choice between a liability rule and a property rule, though justifiable on other economic grounds,382 does not settle or eliminate rivalrousness. The heated debate over licensing and its alternatives thus hinges solely on a question of remedies, even as underlying conflicts among uses of spectrum remain unresolved. Licensing as a remedy does carry constitutional consequences. Approval of broadcast licensing represents a significant departure from the Supreme Court's deep and historically validated suspicion of licensing as the quintessential prior restraint.383 "The struggle for the freedom of the press was primarily directed against the power of the licensor."384 Early in constitutional history, "a law requiring the licensing of printers" was recognized as the "archetypical censorship statute."385 The sixteenth and seventeenth century "licensing laws" that the Bill of Rights targeted as a "core abuse" have a contemporary analogue in broadcast licensing.386 Even when courts allow licensing schemes, they impose stringent conditions,387 lest the unscrupulous licensor achieve censorial objectives through "post hoc rationalizations" and "shifting or illegitimate criteria."388 In another instance in which "equal protection" considerations are "closely intertwined" with free speech,389 constraints on licensing consider the "specific sequence of events leading up to the 381. 47 U.S.C.

The Supreme Court "has recognized the strong governmental interest in certain forms of economic regulation, even though such regulation may have an incidental effect on rights of speech and association."394 Although broadcasters have been regulated on terms distinct from those imposed on common carriers,395 what matters is that the government does restrict entry into and exit from these industries, and does so tightly. Though neither "owned by the federal government" nor subjected by it to rate regulation, "spectrum is subject to strict governmental regulation."396 Regulation of entry, even if not of rates, gives the government freer rein over an entire conduit.397 The Court has distinguished laws targeting 390.

Cable franchising likewise guarantees that a single operator will serve a particular locality. Physical restraints do govern both settings - as spectrum limits the number and strength of distinct signals, so will cable operators encounter some limit on their ability to lay wire. In both settings, however, the more important constraint is legal rather than physical. To repeat: scarcity as rivalrousness is not equivalent to the economic definition of scarcity as a constraint on consumption. Before Ashbacker, the Supreme Court held that "economic injury to an existing station is not a separate and independent" consideration in broadcast licensing.406 It takes but a small sleight of hand, though, to transform injury to rival broadcasters into a relevant element of the public interest: "economic injury to an existing station, while not in and of itself a matter of moment, becomes important when on the facts it spells diminution or destruction of service."407 If anything, treating scarcity as synonymous with economic injury yields perverse broadcasting policy.

Substantial economies of scale preclude a communications market of atomistic, independent actors. Because an "industry with a larger number of owners may well be less efficient than a more concentrated industry," contrary efforts to structure communications markets may sacrifice "[b]oth consumer satisfaction and potential operating cost savings."416 Competition among communicative conduits thus presents yet another instance in which competition among the few provides "a standard of structure and performance that is more pertinent than pure competition given the character of modern technology," a regulatory norm superior to perfect competition.417 In this setting as elsewhere, "perfect competition is not only impossible but inferior."418 Competition within and among conduits often lacks two of the conditions of perfect competition: an atomistic market and the absence of legal restraints on entry and exit. The former condition is static and structural; the latter, dynamic and legally contingent. The dynamic factor carries greater constitutional significance.

The sharp constitutional divide between these two industries hinges on some other factor. What separates print journalism from broadcasting is that newspaper monopolies are not the products of comprehensive, conscious regulatory policy. Nor could they be, given the constitutional tradition opposing the licensure and regulation of print journalists. Though newspapers and broadcasters may be equally capable of squelching public debate,423 print and broadcast journalists are different if only because the law says they are. The mere presence of command- and-control regulation, to say nothing of discretionary choices in its implementation, plainly restricts freedom of movement into, within, or out of any market. If only by historical accident, print journalists have been spared the chore of complying with official constraints on their economic decisions. Ever since the government intervened in radio, broadcasters have not enjoyed comparable freedom. The substantive content of regulatory law is not the sole source of constitutional distortion. The very presence of an agency and its accompanying regulatory apparatus reduces a reviewing court's marginal propensity to protect speech.424 In his Ashcroft I dissent, Justice Stevens characterized his earlier opinion in FCC v.

Whether a conduit fits this "public interest" model is more a question of legal discretion than of natural definition.

Circuit dutifully assumed that DBS was subject to "inherent physical limitation^]"442 that enable "only a tiny fraction of those with resources and intelligence" to exploit that medium.443 Mindful of the Supreme Court's approval of "reasonable means of promoting the public interest in diversified mass communications,"444 Time Warner upheld a demand that DBS operators set aside four to seven percent of their channel capacity for noncommercial educational and informational â¢ 445 programming. 435.

If anything, DBS promises to ease scarcity problems on multiple levels. DBS boasts larger channel capacity. From the even more important perspective of the geographically constrained consumer, DBS facilitates intermodal competition for multichannel video programming delivery. As the "first video technology with a national footprint" and the corresponding opportunity "to exploit the cost efficiencies that accompany national distribution" of programming, DBS "represents the first technology capable of breaking" the grip of "local cable monopolies."446 In the name of preserving free, over-the-air broadcast television, Congress has imposed must-carry obligations on DBS,447 similar to those borne by cable operators.448 DBS's must-carry regime is called "carry one, carry all."449 In Satellite Broadcasting &amp; Communications Association v.

At the very least, Time Warnefs contrary approach, which would have subjected structural regulation of DBS to broadcasting's deferential standard, no longer gives unequivocal support for treating DBS like broadcasting rather than cable. But these decisions also provide no plausible reason for analogizing DBS to conventional broadcasting (the better technological analogue) or to cable (a closer functional or economic substitute). The free-wheeling Internet provides a striking contrast. Unlike broadcast and cable, the Internet's logical architecture continues to adhere, more or less, to the end-to-end principle.454 The true strength of any end-to-end network lies in its stupidity. As befits a "stupid" network455 or a "dumb pipe,"456 the logical layer of the Internet is oblivious to content. By keeping intervening protocols as simple and general as possible, end-to-end design drives a network's "intelligence" to its ends, where users load information an&lt;3 launch applications.457 Simple design and common protocols enable users to develop applications ranging from peer-to-peer file sharing to e-commerce and voice over Internet protocol.458 The resulting communications environment is as fecund as it is diverse. The Internet thus harvests the legacy of this country's longstanding treatment of free speech as a "transcendent value" based on a "robust exchange of ideas which 452. See FCC v.

As Justice Kennedy has recognized, "it is easy and cheap to reach a worldwide audience on the Internet, but expensive if not impossible to reach a geographic subset."461 "Whereas traditional scarcity of money and space require [sic] a library to make choices about what to acquire," observed Justice Souter in his dissent in United States v. American Library Association, Inc.,462 "blocking is the subject of a choice made after the money for Internet access has been spent or committed."463 By contrast, because access to the Internet is acquired in one swoop, blocking "is not necessitated by scarcity of either money or space."464 In the electronic domain, to be sure, current technological assumptions are unusually treacherous. "Experience has made it axiomatic to eschew dogmatism in predicting the impossibility of important developments in the realms of science and technology. Especially when the incentive is great, invention can rapidly upset prevailing opinions of feasibility."465 "[Solutions adequate a decade ago are not necessarily so now, and those acceptable today may well be outmoded 10 years hence."466 The Internet's current reliance on "unified set[s] of code made available to everyone" may "change in the future"; this fragile modus operandi can shift abruptly toward a proprietary model.467 Under the jurisprudence of conduit-based regulation of 459.

ACLU468 observed that the Internet's historic freedom from regulation warranted closer scrutiny of the CD A vis-a-vis similar laws governing broadcast.469 In the event of constitutional conflict, a change in the Internet's regulatory status will change judicial attitudes. First Amendment protection shrinks as messages and audiences become more private and therefore more remote from public discourse.470 If private parties do partition the Internet, First Amendment doctrine would almost surely grant the speech-regulating "machinery of government" greater "play in its joints."471 A technologically savvy jurisprudence of conduit-based regulation would classify DBS and the Internet according to their real-world performance. But it is clear that these conduits' legislative status is driving their constitutional status. Such treatment effectively creates "one long [legal] bootstrap."472 Longstanding regulatory provisions have now "become part of the constitutional baseline used to determine whether a particular regulation violate[s] the First Amendment."473 The notion that the social meaning of a thoroughly regulated conduit justifies further regulation not only engages in the circular illogic of "[bjasing government control on government control"; it also "fail[s] to distinguish spectrum from forms of property" beyond the government's reach.474 Rights in other scarce resources, most saliently land, are determined by "a mode which neither necessitates nor tolerates a regime like that of the FCC."475 In a constitutional tradition that tempers many rights accorded to owners of property but protects speech 468. 521 U.S. 844 (1997). 469.

In a polity where "[government control is not a justification for government control, but a response to some other justification," regulatory disparities should rest on legitimate factual differences.477 The jurisprudence of conduit-based regulation reflects no such rationality; it rests exclusively on historic path-dependency. Even though land and spectrum present identical issues of scarcity and rivalrousness, "it is only because the legal devices used in respect to land have been so vastly different from those represented by the FCC that we unthinkingly suppose that there must be some intrinsic differences."478 Over time, conduit-based regulation's bootstrap becomes even longer and more pernicious. Any explicit inclusion of regulatory intensity in a constitutional test "creates a somewhat perverse incentive for legislatures - regulate a medium in its infancy or lose your chance to regulate at all."479 Try as the law might in an industry's embryonic stage to avoid "an all or nothing-at-all choice,"480 any solicitude for ongoing regulation, however modest, will favor preemptive regulation. From the perspective of a legislator or regulator who can rationally anticipate constitutional jurisprudence, "all other things will not be equal if waiting means forfeiting the right to regulate."481 In dynamic terms, this "sinister" jurisprudence allows "regulation [to] serve as a constitutional justification for more regulation" and to "reinforce an overriding culture of regulation for its own sake."482 4.

Wileman Bros. &amp; Elliot, Inc.486 rejected a First Amendment challenge to marketing orders that required producers of tree fruit to pay assessments for generic advertising. Wileman stressed "the importance of the statutory context";487 nectarines, plums, and peaches are marketed under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937,488 which "displaced many aspects of independent business activity."489 The tree fruit program forced producers to contribute funds to cooperative advertising "as part of a broader collective enterprise in which their freedom to act independently [was] already constrained by the regulatory scheme."490 Indeed, the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act "displaced competition" so thoroughly that tree fruit marketing orders issued under that statute's authority and actions pursuant to those orders were "expressly exempted from the antitrust laws."491 Four years after Wileman, the Court again revisited the constitutionality of compulsory cooperative advertising.

Because the tree fruit program in Wileman "to a large extent deprived producers of their ability to compete and replaced competition with a regime of cooperation," it enabled the government to demand and collect "compelled contributions for germane advertising ... in furtherance of an otherwise legitimate program."496 In United Foods, by contrast, the principal objective of the Mushroom Act was "speech itself."497 All that was at stake was "a compelled subsidy" designed to "mak[e] one entrepreneur finance advertising for the benefit of his competitors."498 The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act subjects the tree fruit industry to such comprehensive regulation that compulsory advertising assessments represent at most a modest marginal imposition on producers' liberty.

The less comprehensive the regulatory scheme, the greater the scope of speech rights within the industry. The subtle slide from Wileman toward United Foods signals a larger jurisprudential shift. The argument that regulation of its own accord justifies more intrusive conduit-based restraints on speech cannot be squared with the First Amendment's commitment to expressive liberty. Chief Justice Rehnquist has suggested that comprehensive "regulation of [an] industry . . . might well" sanction speech-restrictive regulation in that industry.500 This posture is reminiscent of Justice Holmes's argument that the greater power to extinguish "the dedication" of public places "to public uses" subsumes "the less [sic] step of limiting the public use to certain purposes."501 Under Justice Holmes's approach, every public forum case would follow the adage that "[t]he State, no less than a private owner of property, has power to preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated."502 Chief Justice Rehnquist's suggestion also echoes his opinion in Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico,503 which held that "the (1984) (applying the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act to dairy products); Zuber v. Allen, 396 U.S. 168 (1969) (same); United States v.

In Johanns v. Livestock Mktg. Ass'n, 125 S. Ct. 2055 (2005), the Supreme Court dismissed a First Amendment challenge to the beef program by characterizing generic beef advertisements as government speech immune from constitutional scrutiny, see id. at 2062. Johanns 's resolution of this dispute left intact the essential holdings of Wileman and United Foods. See id. at 2058; cf id. at 2066 (Thomas, J. concurring) (reaffirming Justice Thomas's belief "that '[a]ny regulation that compels the funding of advertising must be subjected to the most stringent First Amendment scrutiny'" (quoting United States v. United States Foods Inc., 533 U.S. 405, 419 (2001) (Thomas, J. concurring))). Under any approach, Wileman has no application to the beef program. The original Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 omitted beef from its list of "basic agricultural commodities," see Act of May 12, 1933, ch. 25, Â§ 11, 48 Stat. 31, 38 (designating wheat, cotton, field corn, hogs, rice, tobacco, milk, and dairy products); United States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1, 54 &amp; n.2 (1937) (same), and the federal government exerts far less influence over beef than milk or tree fruit. Johanns explicitly observed that the absence of a '"broader regulatory system in place' that collectivizes aspects of the beef market unrelated to speech" rendered Wileman inapplicable to the beef program.

To the extent that it rests on the presumptive police power over private use of a conduit, the jurisprudence of conduit-based regulation is comparably suspect. C. Push, Pull, and Pervasiveness: Of Saturation and Social Meaning One final factor remains: the pervasiveness and social meaning of particular conduits of speech.506 "Physical settings" in which speech occurs "are not significant in the abstract"; they draw meaning from "the social expectations and understandings associated with different settings, the practices such spaces foster, and the relationships of those practices to First Amendment values."507 Speech does not take place in "some abstract world uncontaminated by concrete social practices," and constitutionally meaningful "communicative acts" must be distinguished from "social practices that do not carry any constitutional value."508 Courts fret over potential public inferences of official endorsement from the government's legal presence within a conduit.

Turner I cited "cable's long history of serving as a conduit for broadcast signals" in playing down the "risk that cable viewers would assume that the broadcast stations carried on a cable system convey ideas or messages endorsed by the cable operator."510 Reno observed that the Internet, having remained free of the intense "government supervision and regulation that has attended the broadcast industry," would not lead its users to "infer some sort of official or societal approval" within that medium's "vast democratic fora."511 Denver similarly distinguished between (traditionally regulated) public access channels and (traditionally unregulated) leased access channels. Because cable operators have historically enjoyed fewer "editorial rights" over public access channels, "the countervailing First Amendment interest is nonexistent, or at least much diminished."512 The logical layer of free speech jurisprudence often invokes another factor closely related to social meaning: the conduit's putative "pervasiveness." This factor most profoundly affects indecency cases. The "uniquely pervasive" nature of broadcasting justifies temporal restrictions on sexual or scatological humor.513 By contrast, the FCC may not restrict nonobscene "dial-a-porn" that enters the home only when "a caller seeks and is willing to pay for the communication."514 Justice Stevens's observation that "the Internet is not as 'invasive' as radio or television" virtually doomed the Communications Decency Act.515 At least in the realm of indecency regulation, constitutionality apparently hinges on the line between "push" and "pull" technologies, between media that deliver information passively and those that await user FCC, 556 F.2d 9, 37 &amp; n.18 (D.C.

FCC11 invalidated restrictions on phone calls whose sexually explicit content, though worthy of protection, lay much further from core First Amendment concerns than did George Carlin's ribald political commentary.518 The most cogent distinction between Pacifica and Sable lies in the nature of the two conduits: whereas broadcasting provides "push" communications, the telephone is the ultimate "pull" tool. Many distinctions within the jurisprudence of conduit-based regulation evidently hinge on the line between push and pull. That line is becoming harder to draw, and its blurriness undermines the distinction's usefulness as a constitutional test. Technological flux undermines legal assumptions about the passive or interactive nature of any conduit. Indeed, to the extent that end-user technology is expanding the domain of pull, government's sphere of influence over expression correlatively shrinks. The growing ability of "customers (in particular, parents) to limit access" to entire categories in "interactive media" should impair all types of content-based regulation, "whether it is regulation of sexual expression, violence, commercial speech, or other controversial materials."519 Pervasiveness does not divide, but rather unites all forms of passive communication - audio and video, wireline and wireless, analog and digital. What Guglielmo Marconi envisioned as a "wireless telegraph,"520 an airborne twist on an older pull technology, eventually built radio's empire of the air.521 Cable is at least as pervasive as over-the-air TV, and probably more so, because the presence of more channels enables subscribers to watch more and to "surf" longer before settling on a program.522 Video-on-demand "promises to transform television from a 'push' technology" at least partially into "a 'pull' technology."523 Now 516.

"[T]he receipt of information on the Internet requires a series of affirmative steps more deliberate and directed than merely turning a dial."526 Nevertheless, anyone who has been "mousetrapped" by pop-ups while browsing the Web or whose e-mailbox has been "spammed" into submission is likely to dispute the Internet's characterization as a "pull" technology. Wireless devices, once broadly deployed, will complete the transformation of the Internet into a medium equally at home with passive push as with active pull.527 If anything, telephony's status as the consummate pull technology hangs by a slender legal thread. The telephone remains a pull technology in significant part because the law so decrees. The technological trifle of sending unsolicited faxes converts fax machines into passive receptacles for information. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA),528 however, makes it "unlawful ... to send an unsolicited advertisement to a telephone facsimile machine."529 More recently, the TCPA and the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act of 1994 (as amended in 2003)530 have authorized a national do-not-call registry.531 States are rushing to 524.

Nor does technology inherently shield the traditional telephone from push uses. "Copper twisted pair" permits both push and pull; it enables digital subscriber line (DSL) service as readily as voice messages. Broadband access via DSL is "always on," a typical push trait.533 Legislative classification of cable broadband and voice over Internet protocol as "information" services, "telecommunications" services, or both may further blur the already illusory distinctions between wireline telephony, broadband, and multichannel video programming delivery.534 In any event, legislative definitions do not control the factual underpinnings of a First Amendment claim.535 Even if it did establish a bright line among conduits, however, the distinction between push and pull can carry only so much constitutional weight.

Although drivers and mass transit passengers may have no "choice or volition" to absorb such messages as are "thrust upon them by all the arts and devices" of the dark science of marketing, the "radio can be turned off."541 Pacifica acerbically refused to ask aggrieved listeners to "avoid further offense by turning off the radio," regarding such an instruction as a facetious pronouncement "that the remedy for an assault is to run away after the first blow."542 Pacifica vastly overestimated the difficulty of avoiding unwanted broadcasts. "Turning off a radio is much easier than averting your eyes from someone who is in the same room. Just try it sometime."543 Efforts to "reduce the adult population to reading only what is fit for children"544 are eviscerated by admonishing offended viewers to avert their eyes.

Against a Distinct Jurisprudence of Conduit-Based Regulation This Article rejects a distinct jurisprudence of conduit-based regulation. At best, distinguishing speech cases by conduit fails to solve basic doctrinal tensions. At worst, adopting a conduit-based approach invites unduly speech-restrictive regulation. After describing how First Amendment jurisprudence might look if stripped of this doctrine, I advocate a unitary theory that respects no categorical distinctions based on the conduit through which speech passes. A. A Truly Transparent, "End-to- End" Approach to Conduit-Based Regulation A separate jurisprudence on conduit-based regulation is unnecessary. A truly transparent, "end-to-end" approach that gives no weight to conduit-specific regulation would perform better. The real problem stems from the longstanding strategy of inspecting every novel conduit before fixing the appropriate level of First Amendment review. This practice, whose pedigree runs from NBC and Red Lion through Reno v. ACLU, typifies the extensive but imperfectly limned jurisprudence of conduit-based regulation. Somewhere between the extremes of presumptive strict scrutiny for content-based regulation and the radically weaker review devoted to restrictions on the time, place, or manner of speech, the Court has sustained putatively economic regulations of communicative conduits that also affect, as they must, those conduits' underlying content. Separating conduit-based regulation's concern with legitimate economic interests from its censorial potential represents another variation on the fundamental challenge of First Amendment doctrine within track one-and-one-half . Two of the most recent cases in this sequence, United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.,547 and the second case styled Ashcroft v. ACLU,548 illustrate an underemphasized doctrinal theme. Pacifica, Sable, Denver, Reno, Playboy, and Ashcroft II have all shown that the Supreme Court is perfectly capable of detecting - and perhaps even denouncing - content-based regulation of speech without regard to conduit. "Regulation of content is not required to solve the technical commons problem in airwave usage"549 or any other aspect of the 547. 529 U.S. 803 (2000). 548. 542 U.S. 656 (2004). 549.

Physical challenges do demand some degree of regulation. "Licensing is necessary for engineering reasons; the spectrum is limited and wavelengths must be assigned to avoid stations interfering with each other."550 Courts, however, must not transmogrify this narrow justification into a bootstrap by which the government can leverage licensing into unfettered content-based regulation. "[Cjensorship or editing or the screening by Government of what licensees may broadcast goes against the grain of the First Amendment."551 Though it superficially honors Red Lion's admonition to focus on conduit, the Supreme Court has never duplicated Red Lion's feat of weakening scrutiny of content- based regulation in any nonbroadcast conduit.552 Even within broadcasting, courts readily condemn overt, ham- fisted control of content. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee553 rescued broadcasters from being forced to accept paid editorial advertisements, reasoning that mandatory carriage would degrade "the journalistic discretion of broadcasters in the coverage of public issues."554 Concurring in the judgment, Justice Douglas drew a cogent distinction between legitimate and censorial regulation: "The Commission has an important role to play in curbing monopolistic practices, in keeping channels free from interference, in opening up new channels as technology develops. But it has no power of censorship."555 FCC v. League of Women Voters556 likewise invalidated an attempt to condition federal funding of public television on broadcasters' abjuring of editorializing.557 Its reasoning was simple: "scarcity of air time does not justify viewpoint-based exclusion."558 Courts have long exhibited the ability to pierce the veneer of conduit-based regulation.

Burstyn confronted a technological phenomenon whose constitutional implications had previously confounded the Supreme Court. In its first look at the movies, the Court held in 1915 that "the exhibition of moving pictures is a business pure and simple, . . . not to be regarded ... as part of the press of the country or as organs of public opinion."561 By 1952, however, the Court had not only accumulated extensive experience with the movie industry's stormy relationship with antitrust,562 but also had come to treat "moving pictures, like newspapers and radio" as part of "the press whose freedom is guaranteed by the First Amendment."563 The Court proceeded to extend full constitutional protection. Although each "particular method of expression" does "tend[] to present its own peculiar problems," Burstyn reasoned, "the basic principles of freedom of speech and the press ... do not vary."564 In an era not known for its dedication to expressive freedom,565 the Court acknowledged that core First Amendment principles "make freedom of expression the rule."566 Red Lion and Pacifica later cited Burstyn for the proposition that "differences in the characteristics of new media justify differences in the 559. 343 U.S. 495 (1952). 560.

However nuanced the judicial approach to the physical, legal, and social vagaries of each conduit, courts should apply as much scrutiny as needed to "smoke out" official efforts to control communicative impact.569 At a minimum, courts should pay closer attention to the prospect that seemingly neutral restrictions will perniciously affect content.570 On other occasions, the Supreme Court has dispatched content- based restrictions with nary a glance at conduit. For instance, Sable Communications of California, Inc. v. FCC1X bypassed the trivial ritual of determining the proper level of First Amendment scrutiny for restrictions on speech via telephone. Decided in 1989, Sable coincided with the cable sequence that began in 1986 with Preferred Communicationsâ¢ and ended in 1997 with Turner 7/.573 Those cases, unlike Sable, pondered the extent to which a new conduit should be analogized to broadcasting. Indeed, telephony has largely eluded the conduit-based strategy.

First Amendment arguments tend to be more respectable than other constitutional strategies, if only because free speech represents the final redoubt of an extensive libertarian tradition that once justified vigorous judicial vindication of economic due process.587 If anything, the First Amendment has apparently "become the first line of challenge for virtually all forms of regulatory initiatives."588 Critics warn that "[f]reedom of speech is becoming a generalized right against economic regulation of the information industry."589 The real trick is to preserve freedom of speech without succumbing to the First Amendment's Lochnerian potential. In an effort to curb the First Amendment's critical power, Justice Breyer has distinguished between "pure economic regulation" and "regulation of expression": "what may count as rational where economic regulation is at issue is not necessarily rational where we focus on expression - in a Nation constitutionally dedicated to the free dissemination of speech, information, learning, and culture."590 The Supreme Court "has recognized the strong governmental interest in certain forms of economic regulation, even though such regulation may 587.

In a 2001 challenge to FCC rules on horizontal and vertical aspects of cable television ownership and operation,610 the D.C. Circuit eschewed NBC and NCCB in favor of the intermediate scrutiny standard articulated in United States v. O'Brien!'11 These cable rules, no less comprehensive in their reach than corresponding rules in broadcasting, failed to pass the tougher test. In striking the 30 percent horizontal limit on subscribers nationwide that any set of commonly owned and operated cable systems may reach, the D.C. Circuit found "nothing in the record supporting a non-conjectural risk of anticompetitive behavior" among affiliated cable systems.612 The court likewise struck down vertical limits on the number of channels that any cable operator may assign to programmers in which the operator holds an attributable interest.613 To like effect, the Fifth Circuit in 1999 invalidated a municipal fee for non-locally produced programming on a public/educational/ governmental (PEG) cable channel.614 The appeals court described the fee as "a content-neutral regulation which implemented] a significant governmental interest in promoting localism."615 This is the deferential rhetoric of NBC and NCCB. The court compared the fee to Turner litigation's must-carry rule, reasoning that a fee that "subsidizes" a PEG channel "and substitutes for the local resources that could otherwise be utilized to produce programs" rests on "an independent economic basis more closely analogous to the content-neutral must-carry rule than a purely [sic] content-related localism preference."616 As in the D.C.

NCCB does nothing more than parrot Red Lion's assertion that broadcasting alone may be lawfully subjected to structural regulation whose censorial potential is unacceptable in any other setting. Unexamined categorical distinctions between conduits offer a wholly unsatisfying alternative to the standing First Amendment trick of vacillating between strict scrutiny on track one and judicial deference on track two. "[T]he issue would be totally different" if regulators were to rest their decisions "upon the basis of [would-be speakers'] political, economic or social views."619 Yet NCCB's endorsement of enhancement theory gives the lie to the idea that structural regulation is inherently content-neutral.620 To the extent that government structures media markets to affect content, courts should apply strict scrutiny. Even absent lower court elaboration, the weaknesses in the jurisprudence of conduit-based regulation are evident from Supreme Court cases. Turner provides the leading illustration. Although Turner I endorsed Red Lion's methodology in searching for a conduit-specific approach to cable, the Turner cases placed exclusive emphasis on cable's physical characteristics. This method stands in stark contrast with Red Lion's more nuanced technique. In concert, the Turner decisions represent the most emphatic rejection of Red Lion's analogical approach. Alone among the Supreme Court's decisions, Turner I insisted that Red Lion involved nothing but physical scarcity, as though the physical characteristics of spectrum alone justified the fairness doctrine. That assertion does not withstand a careful reading of Red Lion and its successor cases. Although Turner I declined to hinge First Amendment analysis solely on the presence of a monopoly,621 it also ignored the impact of the law on cable's economic structure and expressive performance. By contrast, Red Lion counseled consideration 617. Id. at 195. 618. See id. at 195 ("Access has failed to demonstrate narrow tailoring of the fee rule as a matter of law."). 619. NBC v.

Turner Ts deepest pitfall, however, lay in its rendering of the balance between legislative discretion and judicial supervision. "Deference to a legislative finding cannot limit judicial inquiry when First Amendment rights are at stake."622 Ceteris paribus, the Supreme Court gives far less weight to legislative fiat than to individual conduits' functional peculiarities. At a minimum, Turner II evidently sought to reverse this presumption through its application of intermediate scrutiny to must-carry.623 To be sure, the Supreme Court had already conceded its otherwise plenary command over the factual foundations of First Amendment disputes in FCC v. League of Women Votersâ¢ which declined to overrule Red Lion "without some signal from Congress or the FCC that technological developments have advanced so far that some revision of the system of broadcast regulation may be required."625 But the Turner cases extended judicial abdication to settings beyond broadcasting. If anything, Turner calibrated judicial independence in inverse proportion to the innovative potential of the disputed technology. What Turner I had called "substantial deference to the predictive judgments of Congress"626 acquires "special significance in cases . . . involving congressional judgments concerning regulatory schemes of inherent complexity and assessments about the likely interaction of industries undergoing rapid economic and technological change."627 Of course, Red Lion also fell into the same trap. But Turner I aggravated the problem through unilateral judicial disarmament. Worse still, Turner I insisted that "Congress granted must-carry privileges to broadcast stations [solely] on the belief that the broadcast television industry [was] in economic peril due to the physical 622.

If Turner Fs shortcomings concerned nothing besides must-carry, the resulting misalignment of cable and broadcasting would only modestly affect communications law at large. Cable's greatest competitors today are local telephone companies (in the broadband market) and satellite broadcasters (in the multichannel video programming delivery market). But Turner's missteps matter in the same way that the larger body of broadcasting law still matters. Turner erred in two significant ways: first by stressing solely the physical differences between cable and broadcast, and second by ignoring the content-based motivation underlying must-carry. Both of these failings grew from the failure to perceive how the law structures conduit in ways beyond those dictated by strictly physical characteristics. Conduit-based regulation of speech is a constitutional mirage. It represents no genuinely distinct category of First Amendment doctrine. Conduit-based regulation raises precisely the same issues as all other decisions reviewable under the First Amendment. Treating conduit- based regulation as a distinct category does almost nothing to resolve the First Amendment's considerable doctrinal difficulties. Discrimination on the basis of content does not and should not acquire sudden immunity merely because speech passes through a less privileged conduit. To be sure, distinct conduits raise distinct regulatory concerns, ranging from strictly physical characteristics to economic predictions regarding markets that exploit that conduit. Persuasive free speech jurisprudence considers differences of this sort. Condensing these nuances into deceptively convenient categories such as "broadcasting," however, blunts judicial initiative to engage in contextual analysis. Over time, the factors that once might have justified more aggressive intervention in broadcasting may have changed or even 628. Turner /, 512 U.S. at 659. 629. Red Lion Broad. Co. v.

The mere invocation of cases such as Red Lion, NBC, and NCCB, however, effectively ends any reasoned discussion of whether structural regulation of broadcasting deserves closer scrutiny or, for that matter, whether comparable efforts to structure nonbroadcast markets warrant the deference heretofore reserved for broadcasting. Treating conduit-based regulation as a distinct First Amendment concept invites the application of per se rules, in both directions, when what is truly needed is a constitutional rule of reason. Controversies over conduit-based regulation of speech have made two doctrinal contributions. First, these cases have instructed courts to study the conduit in which speech is transmitted, being prepared if necessary to dilute constitutional protection for the expression of ideas. Second, these cases have concluded that one conduit among many - broadcasting - has historically merited less rigorous review on account of rivalrousness in the use of spectrum, the industry's regulatory history, and the public's interest in access to this unique but highly controlled conduit. Almost all objections to Red Lion and the broadcast model have addressed the second aspect of the conduit-based cases. Whether Red Lion erred in its initial assessment of broadcasting and whether that analysis is obsolete today are both beside the point. It is Red Lion's apology for a separate jurisprudence on conduit-based regulation of speech whose time has passed. Technology evolves, but the irreconcilable imperative of protecting expressive freedom while accommodating the regulation of noncommunicative concerns will endure forever. B. Toward a Unitary Theory of Free Speech "It would be convenient if there were some principle demarcating the line between those activities and resources" that directly facilitate speech "and those that do not."631 In reality, there is no clean division between content and conduit. The "almost metaphysical" distinctions on the continuum from the purely physical to the purely expressive provide "no clear dividing line between facilitative aspects of speech and other activities."632 "[I]t is both theoretically difficult and practically impossible to separate the uniqueness of a particular message from the uniqueness of a particular audience at a particular time and place 63 1 .

"Deriving a consistent theory of the First Amendment from the myriad opinions of the Supreme Court represents a task similar to defining the inside and outside of a Mobius strip; that which appears logical at one point evaporates from another perspective."634 To its credit, the jurisprudence of conduit-based regulation acknowledges the intractability of its own quest. Static technological limits, the economic rivalrousness of competing uses, the history and nature of governmental regulation, the pervasiveness and social meaning of a conduit - all of these factors inform this absurdly convoluted constitutional project. And this is to say nothing of predicting the tortuous path of technological change. As much as the broadcast model has crippled the market for video programming and delivery, the dynamic effect of the conduit-based strategy on legal evolution and the pace of technological innovation may be even more dramatic.635 "[F]ully to comprehend" the vast field of contemporary communications "would require an almost universal knowledge ranging from" engineering and economics "to the niceties of the legislative, judicial, and administrative processes of government."636 Foundationalist responses cannot encompass the full "web of values, collectively comprising our understanding of how people should live."637 Yet the core of this task is simple enough to be expressed in a single sentence. Our First Amendment rests squarely on "[o]ur profound national 633. Alexander, supra note 47, at 928. 634. Van ALSTYNE, supra note 141, at 68; Van Alstyne, supra note 11, at 548.

"The Framers of the First Amendment surely did not foresee the advances in science" underlying contemporary conduit-based controversies.640 Courts enjoy enormous freedom to engage in highly contextual, ad hoc judgments that hinge more on evanescent technology than on immanent and durable verities. Like any other social institution, the law must adapt to technological change. A single human generation typically provides ample time for the Supreme Court to complete a constitutional hiccough. Yet assurances that legal change will come in a quarter-century buy nothing in this land.641 A polity whose modern prophet decreed that justice delayed is justice denied does not count patience among its national virtues. Law "must ultimately dissolve into a study of aesthetics and morals."642 We could seek cheap refuge in "[n]ew technology," invariably "the easy answer to everything."643 Technological convergence among "terrestrial broadcasting, satellite broadcasting, coaxial cable," wireline telephony's "twisted pair," and other media still being refined or invented will render meaningless not only "any remaining distinctions between . . . various media technologies" but also 638.

The architecture of our greatest conduit teaches a vital constitutional lesson. "The Internet . . . offer[s] a forum for a true diversity of political discourse, unique opportunities for cultural development, and myriad avenues for intellectual activity."646 The end-to-end concept animating the versatile and volatile Internet should inform First Amendment doctrine. End-to- end wisdom drives all intelligence in free speech jurisprudence to the ends - equally to speakers and to their audiences - at the expense of governmental efforts to modulate the logic of the conduit through which ideas are transmitted. Red Lion and Justice Thomas are each half-correct. Red Lion insisted that "[i]t is the right of the viewers and listeners, not the right of the broadcasters, which is paramount."647 Justice Thomas has declared to the contrary that "[i]t is the operator's right that is preeminent."648 These dueling propositions express a joint truth: guaranteeing expressive freedom among producers as well as consumers of information depends on minimizing the government's role in encumbering conduits with embedded expressions of official "intelligence."

First Amendment jurisprudence has allowed certain expressive conduits to drown in a thick layer of government-initiated "code," in the stultifying structural "logic" of broadcast licensing in the "public interest." Allowing the government too much power to "tell[] us what to say or hear for our own good" threatens to "deform[] the entire democratic process."650 Not for naught has the Supreme Court described the "right to speak freely and to promote diversity of ideas and programs" as "one of the chief distinctions that sets us apart from totalitarian regimes."651 Speech, "often provocative and challenging" and invariably free by law, is intended "to invite dispute," particularly "when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger."652 Free speech "may strike at prejudices and preconceptions and have profound unsettling effects as it presses for acceptance of an idea."653 Within a guarantee of free speech spanning the communicative experience, from its roots in the physical world to its transformation within the mind of the perceiver, "only a unitary First Amendment for all media will do."654 The principles that have kept print media free throughout the history of the Republic should apply equally to new media.655 A unitary free speech jurisprudence leaves no room for a distinct logical layer, for the clumsy cluster of existing doctrines on conduit-based regulation. The very presence of a free speech jurisprudence of conduit-based regulation invites government to shape speech according to its own vision of the good life. Normatively speaking, however, courts should stop endorsing conduit-based regulation. Resistance to official control of the means and manifestations of imaginative expression represents the brightest of "fixed star[s] in our constitutional constellation."656 650.

All law is an experiment, as "all life is an experiment."657 First Amendment jurisprudence should err in favor of and not against the right to speak. Such is the lesson taught by the basic structure of First Amendment doctrine: we begin with presumptive strict scrutiny and then find reasons to ratchet down. From that list of excuses, conduit-based regulation should be struck. Many governmental efforts to regulate conduits and media markets would run afoul of the First Amendment. The First Amendment's commitment to "free trade in ideas" rests on the belief that "the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market."658 In this marketplace of ideas, the "forum where ideas and information flourish," it is "the speaker and the audience, not the government, [who] assess the value of the information presented."659 Conclusion "Every year if not every day we have to wager our salvation upon some prophecy based upon imperfect knowledge."660 Under a Constitution that runs as a covenant across the ages, "[e]ach generation" must reject "anew . . . ideas and aspirations" not fit to "survive more ages than one."661 A separate First Amendment jurisprudence on conduit-based regulation deserves to wither away. A generation ago, William Van Alstyne presciently "repudiat[ed] the doleful view that we are helpless captives of night riders on the air or that we need protection from every political charlatan who may seek to corrupt us with 1,000 watts of radio power."662 Today and tomorrow, "[i]f we would guide by the light of reason, we must let our minds be bold."663 657.
