<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Not Quite All, My Dear": Gender and Voice in Frost Donald G. Sheehy Love and forgetting might have carried them A little further up the mountainside With night so near, but not much further up. They must have halted soon in any case With thoughts of the path back, how rough it was With rock and washout, and unsafe in darkness; When they were halted by a tumbled wall With barbed-wire binding. They stood facing this, Spending what onward impulse they still had In a last look the way they must not go, On up the failing path, where, if a stone Or earthslide moved at night, it moved itself: No footstep moved it. "This is all," they sighed, "Good-night to woods." But not so; there was more. A doe from round a spruce stood looking at them Across the wall, as near the wall as they. She saw them in their field, they her in hers. The difficulty of seeing what stood still, Like some up-ended boulder split in two, Was in her clouded eyes: they saw no fear there. She seemed to think that, two thus, they were safe. Then as if they were something that, though strange, She could not trouble her mind with too long, She sighed and passed unscared along the wall. "This, then, is all. What more is there to ask?" But no, not yet. A snort to bid them wait. A buck from round the spruce stood looking at them Across the wall, as near the wall as they. This was an antlered buck of lusty nostril, Not the same doe come back into her place. He viewed them quizzically with jerks of head, As if to ask, "Why don't you make some motion?

Sheehy Or give some sign of life? Because you can't. I doubt if you're as living as you look." Thus till he had them almost feeling dared To stretch a proffering hand- and a spell-breaking. Then he too passed unscared along the wall. Two had seen two, whichever side you spoke from. "This must be all." It was all. Still they stood, A great wave from it going over them, As if the earth in one unlooked-for favor Had made them certain earth returned their love. -Frost, "Two Look at Two"1 Readers of Frost have taken a singularly unanimous delight in the emo- tional poise and philosophical wisdom of "Two Look at Two," the poet's 1923 lyric-narrative of "love and forgetting," of a sustaining correspon- dence between the human and the natural. From Cleanth Brooks to Frank Lentricchia, critics have addressed the poem by degrees of the su- perlative: "Almost alone among Frost's poems," Brooks observes, it "suggests that nature does give some sort of answering response to the pulsations of the human heart," although that suggestion "takes the form of an aspiration rather than an article of faith" for "the experience occurs to a pair of lovers, prone to project their own tenderness upon the event and disposed to believe that the bond of love that unites them answers to that which links the buck and doe" (3). William Pritchard hears as "much tenderness as is ever found in Frost," for of "the many 'as if moments in Frost's poetry, none is more touching than this one . . . where the lovers have few words beyond saying "This must be all" (161-62). In a poem "given its energy by a visionary impulse," Dorothy Judd Hall finds that "human love- which is presented as real in the poem- may be a catalyst to an equally real spiritual union with nature" (94). Arguing that Frost is most dramatically successful when "the im- pulse of heart and the requirements of mind find embodiment in human figures, usually husband and wife," Marion Montgomery declares this "drama is nicely balanced in 'Two Look at Two' " (221). For Lentricchia, the poem offers "one of the supreme moments of wonder in American literature," in which "Frost can yield to wonder and not (at the same time) yield to sentimentality because he has not forgotten to draw the limits of wonder" (Poetics, 181). Remarking Frost's philosophical kinship with William James, he argues that "the lesson urged upon us by Frost ... is that our redemptive thrust to heal the split between subject and object is balanced by a tragic"- albeit itself sustaining- "recognition of the irredeemable alienation of consciousness in a world in which the ob- ject finally resists being subjectified" (Poetics, 165). But in "redemptive</page><page sequence="3">Gender and Voice in Frost 405 moments" such as that in "Two Look at Two," "we transcend our iso- lation and the perplexities of our human condition, as we are released from the 'siege of hateful contraries' ": If we put aside the poet's sobering perspective for a moment, there can be no doubt that from within the perspectives of the lovers in the poem the earth has returned their love; that nature has opened herself receptively to them, even as they have opened themselves to one another. Love's linkages not only bind self to self, but the two to the earth. And the gentleness of the poet's ironies binds him to his lovers. The poem ends with the "as if." And yet the final image is not one of the lovers moving on down the mountainside, with time flowing again- the final image is of the stillness and of the en- chanted moment of vision. It was Frost's choice, after all, to end his poem there. (Poetics, 182) To end there was Frost's choice after all, but as a version sent to Sidney Cox in 1920 reveals, it was not so originally. Significantly variant in two other places, this draft differs substantially at its end. In fourteen con- cluding lines- published as a note in Toward Robert Frost (1991) by Judith Oster, to which I will return later- the univocality of the "they" opens into dialogue between man and woman.2 The break in the stillness leads not toward sentiment or irony, however, but to the didactic. Frost's later intent to bring "Two Look at Two" into an expanded North of Boston not- withstanding, the original dialogue recalls the untendentious, if equally gendered, conversations of the early dramas less than it predicts that of "West-Running Brook," another discursive look by "two thus" into the mirror of nature. "It is not hot pursuit. And yet he seeks her. That is the meaning of the way they walk- Together on, on, ever everything, Always so far apart, in single file, Against the wind, that always in their breath Pervades their minds with fancies." "When the wind Blows in a new direction do they turn?" "They turn and face it." "Do they keep their order? If the west wind should suddenly be east, And they both faced about, 'twould bring the doe Behind her mate. Would she be seeking him then?"</page><page sequence="4">406 Donald G. Sheehy The way they walked would have another meaning. He would be seeking her when she walked first. He would be leading her when he walked first. Declaring himself a "monist in my wishing but a dualist in my think- ing," Frost avowed a view of existence as "endless . . . things in pairs ordained to everlasting opposition," while intimating that in the fullness of love we may "trust ourselves to go by contraries" and know dichotomy/difference not as opposition but as complementarity. "Two Look at Two" has thus prompted attention to a variety of dichotomous terms - self/other, human/natural, mind/heart, rational/emotional, spirit/matter, active/passive, husband/wife- as expressive of a funda- mental dualism in Frost, against which a redemptive moment of wonder/transcendence/unity is imagined. Given, however, that a major feminist project since Simone de Beauvoir has been to reveal how a di- chotomous organization of thought in Western philosophy privileges male subjectivity, and given further the emphatic reinscription of gen- der as hierarchy in the original ending of "Two Look at Two," an argu- ment by Hélène Cixous seems particularly apt. "Always the same metaphor," Cixous declares, "we follow it, it car- ries us, beneath all its figures, wherever discourse is organized." If we read or speak, the same thread or double braid is leading us throughout literature, philosophy, criticism, centuries of represen- tation and reflection. Thought has always worked through opposi- tion. . . . Through dual, hierarchical oppositions. Superior/Inferior. Myths, legends, books. Philosophical systems. Everywhere (where) ordering intervenes, where a law organizes what is thinkable by op- positions (dual, irreconcilable; or subla table, dialectical). And all these pairs of oppositions are couples. Does that mean something? Is the fact that Logocentrism subjects thought- all concepts, codes and values- to a binary system, related to "the" couple, man/ woman? (63-64) "Organization by hierarchy," she argues, "makes all conceptual organi- zation subject to man" not only because an opposition between activity and passivity is used by man to sustain himself but because a subordi- nation of feminine to masculine "gives the appearance of being the con- dition for the machinery's functioning" and allows a masculine order to "pass as the eternal-natural" (64-65). At issue, of course, is phallogocentrism as a representational system- socially realized in patriarchal culture- which takes one model of sub- jectivity, the male, as that by which all others are defined, and which, as</page><page sequence="5">Gender and Voice in Frost 407 Elizabeth Grosz notes, includes among its forms a complementarity in which "one term is taken as given, in need of completion . . . while the other is regarded only insofar as it serves to satisfy this need" (105-06). In arguing that Frost views gender difference as such a hierarchical com- plementarity and that this informs the voices given to women in his poetry, my intent is not reduction. "We must make no mistake," Cixous advises, men and women are caught up in a web of age-old cultural deter- minations that are almost unanalyzable in their complexity. One can no more speak of "woman" than of "man" without being trapped within an ideological theater where the proliferation of rep- resentations, images, reflections, myths, identifications, transform, deform, constantly change everyone's Imaginary and invalidate in advance any conceptualization. (83) With such caution in mind, I wish to attend more closely to certain scenes in the theater of Frost's imaginary.3 2 "Two Look at Two," like "Birches" and "Stopping by Woods," Elizabeth Sergeant reported, was "written with one stroke of the pen": "In all the same exquisite inter-transfusion between man and nature," "the same cherishing of an objective image in a poet's dream and fantasy until it is ready to flow out upon the page at last in calm and eternal shape" (300). Well, no- but perhaps Frost meant only that first versions had come with relative ease. To read the two versions of "Two Look at Two" is, in any case, to be glad that after putting down his pen Frost picked up a blue pencil. For all that the lines deleted may seem lapses in poetic de- corum, however, they do not violate the poem's logic but make explicit what was implicit in the separate and disparate perceptions of doe and buck, in the overdetermination of difference as female/passivity /less and male/activity/more: "This was an antlered buck of lusty nostril, / Not the same doe come back into her place," a buck who had originally ap- proached with a "click of horny tread," and who- unlike the doe who "sighs" and "could not trouble her mind too long"- interrogates and dares the couple with quizzical "jerks of head." It is possible that Frost revised not only with the grace of a poet but with the conscience of a countryman once embarrassed by having de- scribed geese roosting in trees. For Disney aside, one need be un- "versed in country things" to believe the deer "married," and Frost could not have chosen a species less suited to embody metaphorically his vision of human love. About the deer's failure to flee from novelty,</page><page sequence="6">408 Donald G. Sheehy single-file movement, and sensory experience, Frost held true to fact: "Her vision is no fine and precise thing," Curtis Stadtfeld notes in White- tail Deer, "she sees only indistinct grey shapes," but "her eyes have evolved to see motion, any motion" (2). About their mating, Frost did not: "She will never have a mate at all, in fact, save for one day each fall when she will allow a buck to copulate with her," and "he will leave the next day" for "there is no permanence of pairing" (7, 87). Whitetail "are strictly matriarchal. . . . Hunters often see a buck travelling with a doe in the fall and mistakenly assume they are together as mates. More com- monly, the buck with the doe will be her male fawn in his second fall" (15). Perhaps, however, the poem testifies to the less common, for Stadt- feld records field observations as well of "something nearly like fond- ness" between buck and doe for her few hours of heat (92). Thus, the extent to which Frost's anthropomorphic investment is also androcentric is evident less perhaps in the buck's exclusive "seeking" (though it is "hot" pursuit and not "together on") than in his "leading," for neither leader/follower nor dominance patterns in deer correlate consistently male/female; and except in breeding season, a buck is for all purposes "a sexless animal" (136-38). Dialogue well-written, Frost once remarked, makes attribution of lines to speakers self-evident, and the uncrossed voices of "Two Look at Two" prompt no doubts. To the male is assigned, in ever firmer declaratives, statement of "fact" and exposition of meaning; the female is consigned to a deferential, if potentially subversive, interrogative. (Noteworthy also is that in the authoritative emphasis of the last three lines quotation marks were omitted, effectively confirming a privileged relation of male to narrative voice.) The purpose of the dialogue, however, is not to sunder the couple as couple nor to deny where love has carried them but to reinscribe certain limits to "forgetting"- to confirm the hierarchical structure of the very re- lationship that has made them "two thus." How Frost has buck (active/ pursuer/leader) and doe (passive/pursued/follower) see each other through the lens of instinct is reflected and naturalized in the realm of the human by the dynamic of the closing dialogue. If, as Lentricchia suggests, nature as other "has opened herself receptively" (italics added) to the couple by virtue of their passivity- suggested in the "sigh" they share with the doe- then the dialogue (re)defines the relation by which "they have opened themselves to one another." Celebrating a passive and intuitive sympathy with nature defined culturally as "feminine," the narrative voice betrays an anxiety that it not be construed as, or misconstrued by, the female. My point is not that Frost's idea of the proper relation between man and woman is brute domi- nation; it is not. Rather, as "On the Heart's Beginning to Cloud the Mind" suggests, "He is husband, she is wife. / She fears not him, they fear not life" (291). But the ideal of modern, educated Western man, as de Beauvoir</page><page sequence="7">Gender and Voice in Frost 409 has observed of the sodal construction of complementarity, is "a woman who freely accepts his domination, who does not accept his ideas without discussion, but who yields to his arguments, who resists him intelligently and ends by being convinced" (184). "Voice in conflict with metaphor or with other voices," Richard Poirier has argued of Frost, "the measure of this requires extreme delicacy be- cause it is a conflict inextricable from love." The voice, when it gets anxious about the metaphor it is using, is . . . involved with what it has helped create or evoke, with versions of reality or of poetry or of the "other" in which the self has chosen to find a "reflection." The abrasions can involve the terrible know- ingness of love or of what once was love. Perhaps inevitably, Frost is a great poet of marriage, maybe the greatest since Milton, and of the sexuality that goes with it. This is signally true of the dramatic narratives and less directly of all his poetry. His feelings are satu- rated with what Wordsworth . . . calls the perception of "similitude in dissimilitude" and "dissimilitude in similitude." (22) Casting Frost's redemptive moments as Emersonian efforts "to hold the miraculous within the embrace of the quotidian," Poirier maintains that "sexuality is simply 'there/ as it is in so much of Frost's writing- the specific sexual act of 'putting in the seed'- but it is syntactically and in every other way made continuous with the general human thrust to- ward penetration and creativity" (22). Frost is a great poet of marriage, but Poirier's comparison begs old questions about Miltonic misogyny, even as his recourse (and Frost's, most notably in "All Revelation") to a symbolic language that privileges male subjectivity- "the general hu- man thrust toward penetration and creativity"- raises others. In ad- dressing them, it is instructive to follow Poirier's movement from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century. Among the Miltonic echoes in Frost, one hears nowhere the lament of the bitter, fallen Adam of Book 10 of Paradise Lost: Ο why did God, Creator wise, that peopl'd highest Heav'n With Spirits Masculine, create at last This novelty on Earth, this fair defect Of Nature, and not fill the World at once With Men as Angels without Feminine, Or find some other way to generate Mankind? (427)</page><page sequence="8">410 Donald G. Sheehy On the contrary- and counter as well to the harmony of solitary man and nature in Emerson and Wordsworth- moments of redemptive/ transcendent vision occur in Frost in the context of an achieved "we" of male-female love. For Frost, woman's sexual presence does not, as in the "mower" poems of Andrew Marvell he so admired, rend a unity of mind-and-landscape or mind-and-self for man but allows it. The complementarity of heterosexual love is for Frost the felix of our culpa; it is the failure of sexual love that subverts human nature. From "A Prayer in Spring" to "Never again Would Birds' Song Be the Same," Frost inti- mates not only that "earth's the right place for love" but that it becomes for man a "right place" because of it. By the somber prospect of "A Win- ter Eden," after all, are we reminded that "So near to paradise all pairing ends," and as "An Old Man's Winter Night," "On the Heart's Begin- ning," and "The Most of It" reveal, man cannot keep a house, commu- nity, or universe alone. The complementarity of married love is not conceived in Frost, however, as a relation of equal subjects, and for all that he does not regard female sexuality as a locus of corruption, or de- fine woman by a Renaissance dichotomy of "fair above and foul below," the Eves of his gardens are not a justification of her who recognizes "for, inferior, who is free" but an appreciation of her who is willingly (re)"composed to" the naturalness and efficacy of "submission." Male fear and rage against women in Renaissance poetry, Jim Swan has argued, is "at a deep level not about woman at all, not about the double and divided object, beautiful and dangerous," but about the double and divided male subject. Citing Nancy Chodorow's argument that since men, unlike women, look back to an origin of identity with one who is different, there is "built into core male gender identity ... an almost somatic sense of femaleness that continually, usually unnotice- ably, but sometimes insistently, challenges and undermines the sense of maleness," Swan notes that a "paradox of primary male identity" has particular consequences for poetry: "As a poet, a man may well find it valuable to accept his original identity with a woman. . . . [A]s a poet he must accept it if he is to maintain his creativity. But as a man in a world of masculine dominance ... he may experience a difficult conflict be- tween his roles as man and poet." Poetry, he concludes, "often provides an occasion for realizing this conflict and working or playing it out" (161). Valid as it may be, however, one need not subscribe to a psycho- analytic account of the origin of this conflict to recognize either the power of its cultural construction or the complexity with which it is at play in Frost. Indeed, a feminist history of philosophy offers another means of approach.</page><page sequence="9">Gender and Voice in Frost 411 3 The figuration of a cultural ideal of a "Man of Reason" is based, Genev- iève Lloyd argues, in an association between male and rational and fe- male and nonrational that extends back to Aristotelian and Augustinian definitions of women as "lesser men" by virtue of a relative incapacity or passivity in rationality, but that takes particular shape in what Susan Bordo calls a seventeenth-century "masculinization of thought." En- tailed in a Cartesian antithesis between mind and matter, Lloyd argues, was a separating out from thought of the emotional, sensuous, and imaginative and a polarization of intellect and emotion, reason and imagination. The exclusion of women by "defect" from training in rea- son further provided a reasoned basis for their social subordination, and thus the idea that man was made in God's image and woman as a com- panion took on a new dimension: Reason, the godlike in humankind, is assigned to the male, and the emotions, the imagination, and the sen- suous to the female, whose role is to preserve for man what he himself must transcend (116-17). Our seventeenth-century inheritance, Lloyd maintains, is an ideal of cognitive method in which intuition is devalued as unsystematized thought and associated with the female (124); an ac- companying image, Susan Hekman notes, "of man the scientist who proves his virility by penetrating the secrets of nature" (116); and an epistemology, Bordo argues, that values "masculine" modes of detach- ment, distance, and clarity and devalues as "feminine" those of connect- edness, closeness, and empathy (264). Frost's cultural legacy includes as well, of course, a Romantic chal- lenge to the adequacy of reason as a mode of access to physical and metaphysical reality. But an exaltation of imagination and feeling also yielded a pedestalization of women that was disastrous for sexual equal- ity. As Lloyd observes, "The ideal of the Man of Reason stayed intact through the challenge of Romanticism, while going in search of his op- posite to complete or complement his existence," and thus a "dichot- omy between reason and feeling was preserved and in fact endorsed" (125). Toward a similar conclusion, Hilde Hein argues that spirit and matter do not appear as primary oppositions on a value scale of hierar- chical dichotomies in Western philosophy because women have been variously seen as either incompatible with the spiritual or its primary human representation (293). Associating spirit with the male, rational, and ethically sound, as well as biologically generative and divine, clas- sical and Christian conceptions justified women's subordination and necessary obedience. For in its superiority to matter, spirit is rightfully destined to dominate it, and material nature, associated with a passive</page><page sequence="10">412 Donald G. Sheehy female potency, must be controlled in women, the physical world, and man himself (297-98). In reaction against the instrumentality of scientific reason in industrial culture, Hein notes however, Romantic thought re- conceived spirituality and created a pseudo-moral realm of sentiment in which women were held hostage. Identified by default with spirituality, they are required to satisfy the dimension of affect and sensitivity that both reason and matter ignore. This spirituality gives meaning to life and makes it worth- while . . . but it is not to be confused with moral righteousness, which is lawful and derives from reason. Love, not morality, is the realm of the spirit, and love is the domain of women. The home is also the domain of women, and there spirituality is enshrined. (301) The sentimentally spiritualized woman, she concludes, is "above the crass materialism and rationalism of the world of men . . . , but woe unto her if she descend, for she is instantly transformed into her mirror image- cold, hard, unnatural. The compromise of her spirituality dena- tures her femininity, though not necessarily her sexuality. Hence the distinction . . . between the lady and the woman. The spiritualized lady is 'pure' in her wifely dedication and motherhood: the despirited woman is depraved, either as sexually wanton ... or as sexually neu- tralized and frigid" (302). Romanticizing the "feminine" within a do- mestic sphere, as Bordo argues, thus fulfilled the ends of a seventeenth- century masculinization of thought by the "exclusion of feminine modes of knowing, not from culture in general, but from the scientific and philosophical arenas, whose objectivity and purity needed to be guaran- teed" (264). Schematicized thus, science and philosophy are, of course, "mascu- line," while literature as cultural activity overlaps categorically with the "feminine" and, given its inherent involvement with the affective, no form more so than lyric poetry. While effectively barred from commerce and the public sphere and largely silenced by exclusion in philosophy and science until well into the twentieth century, women had more suc- cessfully made themselves heard in literature. Thus, the cultural status as masculine of the modern "Man of Poetry" was problematized both by the fuller emergence of female authorship and by a Romantic legacy in which intuition and emotion are taken as legitimate, and metaphysically superior, ways of knowing. But if "true transcendence" in Romantic thought is, in de Beauvoir's terms, "accomplished by a return to imma- nence," then a male anxiety entailed in such recuperation of the "natural/intuitive/feminine" is revealed, as her analysis of its prevalent</page><page sequence="11">Gender and Voice in Frost 413 myths of woman suggests, in its self-enabling displacement of woman as "other" into "deep immanence" and "far-off transcendence" (181-82, italics added). Such anxiety, as critics have noted, is evident in the "male fear and rage" in modernist poetics, where a misogynistic "masculin- ism" is not only promulgated at the level of Pound's diatribes against "Aunt Hepsy" and a corruption of literature into a "great passive vulva" but also encoded in such forms as Hulme's classicism, Eliot's imperson- ality, and Lawrence's cult of the phallus. If not virulently misogynistic, neither is Frost's sense of woman's "na- ture" and proper sphere free of hierarchical assumption. "I am not the Pla- tonist Robinson was," he declared in a letter to R. P. T. Coffin in 1938: By Platonist I mean one who believes what we have here is an im- perfect copy of what is in heaven. The woman you have is an im- perfect copy of some woman in heaven or in someone else's bed. Many of the world's greatest- maybe all of them- have been ranged on that romantic side. I am philosophically opposed to hav- ing one Iseult for my vocation and another for my avocation. . . . You see where that lands me on the subject of Dante's Beatrice. Mea Culpa. Let me not sound the least big smug. I define a difference with proper humility. "A truly gallant Platonist," he concluded, "will remain a bachelor as Robinson did from an unwillingness to reduce any woman to the con- dition of being used without being idealized" {Letters, 462). Refusing a reduction of her sexuality to "use" or of her spirituality to the attenuations of romantic love, Frost nonetheless locates woman's natural expression and fulfillment in the realm of the affective and- while he declines to sentimentalize its quotidian tasks- in the sphere of the domestic. Marriage, in Frost's poetry, achieves harmonious comple- mentarity (as in "The Death of the Hired Man" or in the understated play on "lady" in "In the Home Stretch") when woman willingly plays what de Beauvoir calls a "role of pity and tenderness," in which she "heals the wounds of the males" and rather than "threaten man's works, limits herself to enriching them and softening their too rugged lines," and when as Muse she "mediates between the creator and the natural springs whence he must draw" (181). Sustaining the comple- mentarity of marriage devolves in Frost upon both husband and wife and is as susceptible to rupture- signaled by a failure of language as communication and of sexual love as communion- by male indiffer- ence, insensitivity, or brutality as by female refusal or rebellion. Though not untenable, it is particularly vulnerable in the absence of a child</page><page sequence="12">414 Donald G. Sheehy whose presence validates woman's domestic existence as an integration of labor, love, and nurture. Neither reactionary in his ideas about the education of women nor progressive in his attitude toward an expansion of their social roles and sexual freedoms, Frost wrote to his daughter Lesley- herself a strong- minded and independent individual whom he encouraged in her edu- cational, business, and professional pursuits- about his experience at the University of Michigan in 1926 and declared that "I find I'm not fond of teaching girls in their new state of mind": They started out escorting me home from night classes and propos- ing canoe rides and when I blocked that turned on me in some sort of sex resentment and gave me one of the worst classes of wrangle and flat contradiction I ever had. . . . Suddenly out of some sex mis- chief they break loose and storm me not with subjects, observa- tions, and comparisons (such would be welcome) but with contradictions and abuse. I could compose these matters if I cared to. But I seem off such people. I'm willing to grant their equality if thats [sic] all they are fighting for. (Family, 112) A letter to Lesley in 1939 about difficulties in her sister Irma's marriage further reveals Frost's ambivalence about the changing social status of women: It cant [sic] be that what a woman lays up against a man is his suc- cess out where she can only imperfectly share it. Mind you I dont [sic] care if she does. I am prepared for any sadness in the structure of the universe. Go out and get all your own success. But do it coolly and deliberately and without importunate haste. Keep well, look well. A woman has to look well. (Family, 210-11) Neither is Frost's sense of the status of the poet as culturally "mascu- line" free of the anxiety attendant upon what Lentricchia defines in "The Resentments of Robert Frost" as an awareness that "manliness was quite simply the culturally excluded principle in a life given to po- etry" (191). "A real artist delights in roughness," Frost insisted in an- other letter to Coffin in 1938. "He's the brute who can knock the corners off the marble block and drag the unbedded beauty out of bed." Un- usual though not unique in Frost's poetics, such "virile" vehemence is set in context by what follows: Then there was the man who after telling me for hours about his big bold business adventures asked me toward morning what I did</page><page sequence="13">Gender and Voice in Frost 415 with myself. I staved off the confession. I likened myself to him in adventurousness. I was a long-shot man too. I liked not to know beforehand what the day might bring. And so till he lost patience with me and cried "Shoot!" Well I write poetry. "Hell," he said un- happily, "my wife writes that stuff." (Letters, 465) "It turned out she did," Frost acknowledged, and safely consigned her to the feminized realm of the "poetry society" by noting he had seen her verse. Other women had written, however, what was inarguably poetry, and a distinction Frost drew in a 1960 interview is revealing: Interviewer. Conrad Aiken, in introducing the Modern Library edi- tion of Emily Dickinson's poems, says: "In her mode of life she car- ried the doctrine of self-sufficient individualism farther than Thoreau carried it. ... In her poetry she carried it, with the comple- ment of passionate mysticism, farther than Emerson: which is to say that as a poet she had more genius than he." Frost. Hah! Hah! Hah! I'll forgive him that. He's a friend of mine. Interviewer. I think your laugh is the answer. Frost. It's a great joke. That's the way it goes. She's the greatest lady poet who ever lived. Another extravagant statement. She was, I think. That's true. That's nonsense [Aiken's statement]. (Cook 162). Of the efforts of male modern poets to define a masculine cultural identity and poetic practice, Lentricchia argues that "the provocatively gendered responses of Frost, Pound and other male modernists" were less a function of misogyny than a reaction against a "genteel" literary style, "a cultural feminization, at work in the writing of both sexes" ("Resentments," 184). Citing Robert Penn Warren's distinction between pure and impure poetry, he argues that the modern lyric is masculinized in being "indecorously open ('full of all sorts of things')" and "impure." If love is lyric poetry's purest inherent tendency, its "soft subject" and "exclusionary principle," then the principle of impurity is "hard mascu- line wit" that "brings love back from the far empyrean to bawdy earth" -an "unidealized consciousness that so far from doing in and do- ing away with the purity of poetry actually acts as its world-toughened shield, the realist protector of airy romantic ideality." Thus, "lyric is cul- turally sanctioned in modernist polemic when what is culturally branded (and denigrated) as essentially female is not done away with but is married to the male principle" (190-91). In Frost's poetics, he maintains, "the act of summoning voices from the vernacular would be the sign of masculinity in poetry,"</page><page sequence="14">416 Donald G. Sheehy an invitation to poetic reading that real (economically earnest) men might find seductive because redolent with the odors of a world they knew and the new lyric poet's key technical liaison with the already powerfully emerged realist novel might win for him, an American male lyricist, social acceptance in an American . . . context which typically encoded economic and cultural roles in engendered opposition. (185) More is involved, of course, in the "provocatively gendered re- sponses" of modernist poetics than the cultural "femininity" of genteel poetic style and subject matter, but despite its own masculinist assump- tions, Lentricchia's argument provides a useful sense of the context in which Frost defined his discursive range by a marriage of culturally "feminine" and "masculine" voices and subjects. Along with the tradi- tionally lyric subjects of love and celebration of the nature (often enough rendered "pure"), Frost takes as appropriate poetic subjects philosophy, theology, history, science, commerce, and politics. Further, as Lentric- chia notes, Frost's dramas "often featured at their very center economi- cally disadvantaged female voices," although the "liaison" he defines with realist fiction was not itself unproblematic. As the aspersions of "womanly" cast at William Dean Howells and Henry James by their more "manly" naturalist successors suggests, the masculine status of re- alist fiction was itself made suspect by its investment in the domestic and by the fuller emergence of fiction by women. In fact, after likening Frost's narratives of New England life to those of Sarah Orne Jewett, Mary Wilkins Freeman, and Alice Brown in reviews of North of Boston, both Amy Lowell and Howells himself thought it best to assert the po- et's "manliness." Such a comparison, Howells emphasizes, "does not adequately suggest the range of [Frost's] very distinctive power. His manly power is manliest in penetrating to the heart of womanhood in that womanliest phase of it, the New England phase." Frost's dramas do give women voice, and grounded as they are in the experiential, they render honestly and sympathetically his sense that, unless realized as a full complementarity of love, marriage and domestic life can become for women a condition of deprivation, servitude, and entrapment that is finally disabling and dehumanizing. Frost's women speak intelligently and expressively, but they also speak as "woman," centered in the realm of the affective and the sphere of the domestic. Depicting what Frost conceives as successful marriage, such poems as "The Death of the Hired Man" enact the subtle gradations by which women's thought and speech may move outward from a domestic cen- ter and men's inward from worldly concerns to converge to an extent that, without collapsing difference, sustains and enriches both; in mar-</page><page sequence="15">Gender and Voice in Frost 417 riages failing or failed, male/female difference freezes into incomprehen- sion and/or opposition, as in "The Hill Wife," "A Servant to Servants," or "Home Burial, in which the husband declares that "A man must partly give up being a man With womenfolk. We could have some arrangement By which I'd bind myself to keep hands off Anything special you're a-mind to name. Though I don't like such things 'twixt those that love. Two that don't love can't live together without them. But two that do can't live together with them." (52-53) For all that the sustained and sustaining conversation between Robert and Elinor Frost appears to have ranged over issues of religion, philoso- phy, history, science, commerce, and politics- "She has been the un- spoken half of everything I ever wrote," he revealingly declared in 1937 (Letters, 450) -talk between men and women in the poems does so rarely and with particular consequences for women's voices. As is evident not only in A Masque of Reason (1945) and A Masque of Mercy (1947) but also in the earlier "West-Running Brook" (1928), the nearer dialogue ap- proaches the status of philosophical discourse in Frost, the more dis- tinctly hierarchical a dichotomy between woman's voice and man's becomes. 4 Sufficiently evident at the dramatic surface, gender difference is in- scribed as hierarchy at all levels of the philosophical, theological, and so- cial debate of Frost's Masques. In the conversation in A Masque of Mercy among Jonah, Paul, and Keeper concerning divine mercy and divine jus- tice, Jessie Bel, Keeper's wife, is largely limited to a hectoring of Keeper (" 'We're poor . . . My man can't earn a living' "), for which she is reg- ularly chastised (" 'Don't be so silly, woman' ") by each of the men. Jessie Bel- Jezebel recast as a "new woman" - "takes to drink" and speaks what Jonah calls "Greenwich Village cocktail-party talk." While Keeper's theological and political misapprehensions are cleared in talk with Paul and Jonah- indeed, as Randall Jarrell notes, Keeper "devel- ops so much that he finally develops into Robert Frost" (35)- Jesse Bel remains beyond the reach of philosophical education. But then her prob- lems originate, we are told, not in theological uncertainties but in fail- ures of love. Faced with her disillusionment, Jonah speculates that " 'She's had some loss she can't accept from God-/ Is that it? Some</page><page sequence="16">418 Donald G. Sheehy Utopian belief- / Or child, and this is motherly resentment?' " Asked by Jonah who Paul is, Jesse Bel calls him "our analyst" and explains that " 'An analyst's the latest thing in doctors. / He's mine. That's what he is (you asked)- my doctor. / I'm sick.' " " Of what?' " Jonah asks. Jesse Bel. Oh, everything, I guess. The doctors say the trouble with me is I'm not in love. I didn't love the doctor I had before. That's why I changed to Paul - To try another. Paul. Jesse Bel's a girl Whose cure will lie in getting her idea Of the word love corrected. She got off To a bad start it seems in the wrong school of therapy. (499-500) The principles of a Pauline course in love by which Jesse Bel is to be cured are left unstated but are familiar enough perhaps from 1 Timothy: "Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in si- lence. . . . Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety" (2:11-15). Near the end and after another rebuke of her impiety, Keeper declares that " 'Bel gets some things right- and she was right-' " (Jesse Bel. " Ί am right, then?' ") - " 'In glorifying courage.' " What she had said, however, was that " 'The saddest thing in life is that the best thing in it should be courage.' " Appropriating her perception in the final speech of the play, Keeper also corrects it: "My failure is no different than Jonah's. We both have lacked the courage in the heart To overcome the fear within the soul And go ahead to any accomplishment. Courage is what it takes and takes the more of Because the deeper fear is so eternal." Linked as Jezebel to the impudence, meddling, and bad counsel that threatened the salvation of Ahab, Jesse Bel is by her view of courage- and by the self-restorative moral quality of Keeper's repudiation of it- linked as well to those female embodiments of weakness who threaten to undo a legion of biblical heroes. The association is reinforced by her having been in analysis, a sign of weakness for Frost. Keeper's ironic re-</page><page sequence="17">Gender and Voice in Frost 419 jection of Jessie Bel's designation of Paul as "our analyst" ("Who keeps our bookstore annals") accords with the earlier satiric dismissal in "New Hampshire" (1923) of the "school of the pseudo-phallic," whose con- struction of manhood offers a choice only between being "prude" or "puke" and whose therapeutic model encourages the latter. Depicted less harshly than Jesse Bel, Job's wife is no less marginalized in the philosophical discourse of A Masque of Reason. The play opens as a "Man" and "Wife" watch God emerge from a burning tree and pitch his throne: "A Court of Love," she suggests; "More likely Royal Court- / Or Court of Law," he corrects. Once he is named in dialogue, "Job" re- places "Man" in the left margin while "Wife" becomes "Job's Wife." While Frost has biblical precedent for not naming Job's wife, it presents a dramatic problem he solves by having her addressed as Thyatira. An ancient city in Asia Minor, Thyatira is linked to a woman both times it appears in the Bible. In Acts, it is the birthplace of Lydia, a convert who welcomes Paul into her home at Philippi (16:14). In Revelation, how- ever, the church at Thyatira is accused of matriarchal corruption: "I have against thee that thou sufferest the woman, Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, to teach, and to seduce my servants, to commit fornication, and to eat of things sacrificed to idols. And I gave her time that she might repent, and she does not want to repent of her immorality" (2:18- 21). The uncertain moral status underscored in Frost's choice of name is consistent with what biblical account we have of Job's wife. For her fail- ure of faith during his trials- her call to "curse God, and die"- Job re- bukes her: "Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh" (2:10). Not again directly mentioned, she is implicitly restored to obedi- ence, however, for Job's later blessings include many sons and notably worthy daughters. On Judgment Day in A Masque of Reason, Job seeks an accounting of his moral worth, to "come to rest in an official verdict." But Thyatira, he advises, should " 'Suffer yourself to be admired, my love, / As in Waller.' "4 Thus, the end of man is justice, while the end of woman is to be loved- or, as she worries, "not admired." Recognizing Job- though He requires an introduction to Thyatira, God takes responsibility for Job's suffering, explains the purpose of its "unreason" as "releasing me from moral bondage to the human race," and names Job a "saint." " 'We're saved,' " Job declares to Thyatira, and assured a share in salva- tion, she at once reveals a failure to comprehend God's explanation of Job's plight: Job's Wife.- I have a protest I would lodge with You. I want to ask You if it stands to reason That women prophets should be burned as witches,</page><page sequence="18">420 Donald G. Sheehy Whereas men prophets are received with honor. Job. Except in their own country, Thyatira. God. You're not a witch? Job's Wife. No. God. Have you ever been one? Job. Sometimes she thinks she has and gets herself Worked up about it. But she really hasn't- Not in the sense of having to my knowledge Predicted anything that came to pass. Job's Wife. The Witch of Endor was a friend of mine. God. You wouldn't say she fared so very badly. I noticed when she called up Samuel His spirit had to come. Apparently A witch was stronger than a prophet there. Job's Wife. But she was burned for witchcraft. God. That is not Of record in my Note Book. Job's Wife. Well, she was. And I should like to know the reason why. (476^77) In the "Note Book" of scripture, the Witch of Endor is, of course, not burned. Indeed, to a degree that Cheryl Anne Brown notes as striking in light of biblical attitudes toward both women and necromancy, she is portrayed in her counsel and comfort to Saul as a woman of courage, competence, and compassion (181-205). The legitimacy of her "femi- nist" perspective compromised by her error, Thyatira is further chas- tised by God: " There you go asking for the very thing / We've just agreed I didn't have to give. - I Where has she been the last half hour or so?' " He offers to explain the concept of injustice to her, but Job de- murs. God. Because your wife's past won't bear looking into? - In our great moment what did you do, Madam? What did you try to make your husband say? Job's Wife. ... I stood by Job. I may have turned on You. (477) Again falsifying scriptural history by avowing that "I did my wifely duty" during Job's tribulations, Thyatira lodges another protest by which Frost reveals the limits of her moral and social understanding. Counter to Job's biblical certainty that whatever his sin he had never "denied anything to the poor, or allowed the eyes of the widow to Ian-</page><page sequence="19">Gender and Voice in Frost 421 guish while I ate my portion alone" (31:16-17), she recalls that Job "tried to think what he / Had done or not done for the poor" and insists- like the New Dealers Frost satirized through the 1930s- that the test of goodness is "always how we treat the poor": "It's time the poor were treated by the state / In some way not so penal as the poorhouse. / That's one thing more to put on Your agenda." Having misrepresented her wifely virtue and the certainty of Job's social virtue, she further mocks God and man: All You can seem to do is lose Your temper When reason-hungry mortals ask for reasons. Of course, in the abstract high singular There isn't any universal reason; And no one but a man would think there was. You don't catch women trying to be Plato. (478) In the context of a fundamentally fideistic argument about the inad- equacy of human reason to divine purpose, Thyatira's refusal of philo- sophical speculation is both self-limiting and potentially subversive. Already discredited by its "feminist" interestedness, her dangerously philosophical antiphilosophical voice is now suppressed in a manner that recalls Milton's disposition of Eve as Michael explains God's ways to Adam. "You go to sleep," Job tells her, informing God that "Nothing keeps her awake / But physical activity, I find. / Try to read to her and she drops right off." "She's beautiful," God replies. Assuring God fur- ther that they can speak in confidence, Job declares that "There's no one here but her, / And she's a woman: she's not interested / In general ideas and principles." God. What are her interests, Job? Job. Witch- women's rights. Humor her there or she will be confirmed In her suspicion that You're no feminist. You have it in for women, she believes. Kipling invokes You as Lord God of Hosts. She'd like to know how You would take a prayer That started off Lord God of Hostesses. God. I'm charmed with her. (479) Participating thereafter only sporadically (Job. " 'What, still awake?' ") and inappropriately (God. " 'My kingdom, what an outbreak!' ") in a</page><page sequence="20">422 Donald G.

Well, what led up- Something about- (The three men laugh.) -The Devil's being God's best inspiration. Job. Good, pretty good. (487-88) As Thyatira's subsequent flirtation with Satan confirms, however, it is not good enough. Having been neither fully asleep in the restorative "trance" of Milton's Eve and thus open to an account of God's plan sim- plified to her needs as woman, nor fully "awake" intellectually to the argument conducted above her head, she misrepresents its import by mockingly tempting Satan to speak and imploring him to stay: " This is polite society you're in, / Where good and bad are mingled every which way, / And ears lent to any sophistry / Just as if nothing mattered but our manners.' " Revisionist as they may be in theological argument, the Masques are traditionally masculinist in discrediting a "feminist" philo- sophical voice. 5 Grounded not in scriptural stricture but in the reconciliations of intellect and intuition, of science and faith, in the philosophy of Henri Bergson, "West-Running Brook" is more gentle but no less firm in excluding woman's philosophical voice. While Fred's wife, who is not named, is rendered in a manner more complementary and more complimentary than are the wives in the Masques, her voice is no less circumscribed. Sharing with "Two Look at Two" both a debt to Bergson and a dramatic situation, "West-Running Brook" thus reveals the particular pressures exerted upon the poetic voice by its investment in intuitive modes of thought culturally construed as feminine. Frost's appreciation of Bergson is evident, as Thompson has noted, as early as 1911, when he defended Creative Evolution against charges of atheism (381-82). The nature of Bergson's appeal is evident perhaps in</page><page sequence="21">Gender and Voice in Frost 423 Thomas Hanna's account of the general enthusiasm that greeted Creative Evolution: "Great and hopeful prospects were suddenly opened up ... for a wholesome respect between the proponents of scientific intelli- gence and those of intuitive understanding. For a long moment, the uni- verse seemed large enough for both science and poetry and not only that, but in need of them both" (18). Frost found in Bergson not only a reconciliation between a religious, if not orthodox, faith and a science of evolution but also between intuition- which Bergson associated with both an aesthetic faculty and mystical experience- and rationality. A re- integration of thought was further conceived by Bergson as a comple- mentarity that recognized the interdependence of intellect and intuition but that granted intuition primacy over instrumental analysis by virtue of its access to a metaphysical reality. The limited effect his project had upon modern philosophy and science- as opposed to religion and literature- reveals, however, the extent to which Bergson's rehabilitation of intuitive thought suffered by association with traditional definitions of intuition as mere ir- rationality-as in "woman's intuition." In such a context, as Lloyd ar- gues, any attempt to provide intuition with philosophical content can be seen as a "vacuous affirmation of the importance or superiority of feel- ing or imagination," even when a defense of intuition, as in Bergson, is not a rejection of rationality but an effort to repair a segmentation of thought (124-26). Frost may have recognized as well, however, what Hanna perceives as "a male-female distinction" in Creative Evolution, a spirit/matter dichotomy in which "one reality is active, the other pas- sive," for "spirit is an aggressive reality which has . . . molded the static reality of matter." The off-spring of this male ingression is organic life, and it is, per- haps, an obscure echo of Bergson's Jewish patriarchalism that the active spirit is alone sanctioned as the parent of organic life. . . . [S]pirit seeks to express itself by incarnation within matter, but this incarnation is ... not a union of two equal realities; rather, organic life is a victory over static matter, spirit's triumphant use of matter to express and realize itself. (6)5 Apparent in poems as various as "Kitty Hawk" and "A Never Naught Song," Frost's debt to Bergson is most evident perhaps in "West- Running Brook." It figures as well, however, in the rendering of intui- tive insight in "Two Look at Two." In "Introduction to Metaphysics" (1903), Bergson defined intuition as "sympathy by which one is trans- ported into the interior of an object in order to coincide with what there is unique and consequently inexpressible" by analysis (190). "It is to the</page><page sequence="22">424 Donald G. Sheehy very inwardness of life that intuition leads us," Creative Evolution argued (176), and it is an experience, in The Two Sources of Morality and Religion (1935), by which "the soul is open to the oncoming wave . . . like an onslaught of love" (90). Such a moment of sympathetic wonder is shared by the couple in "Two Look at Two" ("Still they stood, / A great wave from it going over them / As if the earth in one unlooked-for favor / Had made them certain earth returned their love"), but the meaning of the experience is spoken not by them, except as "This must be all," but by the narrative voice. The wife and husband in "West-Running Brook," however, give voice to their insights, and the dynamic of the dialogue is as revealingly gendered as are their interpretations. The poem opens as the woman voices not a statement but a question, and one not unmarked by gendered assumptions: "Fred, where is north?" "North? North is there, my love. The brook runs west." "West-Running Brook then call it." (West-Running Brook men call it to this day.) "What does it think it's doing running west When all the other country brooks flow east To reach the ocean? It must be the brook Can trust itself to go by contraries The way I can with you- and you with me- Because we're- we're- I don't know what we are. What are we? "Young or new?" "We must be something. We've said we two. Let's change that to we three. As you and I are married to each other We'll both be married to the brook. We'll build Our bridge across it, and the bridge shall be Our arm thrown over it asleep beside it. Look, look, it's waving to us with a wave To let us know it hears me." (257-58)6 While the sentimentality of her analogy is balanced by a modest evoca- tion of the marriage bed (" 'the bridge shall be / Our arm thrown over it asleep beside it' "), it fails, as Fred chides, to remain sufficiently aware of its status as metaphor.</page><page sequence="23">Gender and Voice in Frost 425 "Why, my dear, That wave's been standing off this jut of shore - ." (The black stream, catching itself on a sunken rock, Flung backward on itself in one white wave, And the white water rode the black forever, Not gaining but not losing, like a bird White feathers from the struggle of whose breast Flecked the dark stream and flecked the darker pool Below the point, and were at last driven wrinkled In a white scarf against the far-shore alders.) "That wave's been standing off this jut of shore Ever since rivers, I was going to say, Were made in heaven. It wasn't waved to us." (258) As Fred's thought or as a narrative interpolation that establishes an identity of male and poetic voice, the parenthetical passage contrasts sharply with the wife's speech in conceptual and verbal complexity. Granting his superior claim to "fact," she finds in his mention of heaven a source of particularly feminine authority: " 'It wasn't, yet it was. If not to you, / It was to me- in an annunciation.' " " Oh, if you take it off to lady-land,' " Fred replies, " 'As't were the country of the Amazons / We men must see you to the confines of / And leave you there, ourselves forbid to enter-/ It is your brook! I have no more to say.' " Playfully disproportionate, Fred's remonstrance is also effectively cumulative in relegating metaphors of romantic love and conventional Christian story (which Frost likened elsewhere to gossip) to an unpromising land sen- timental in its spirituality and yet Amazonian in its assertion of feminine authority. By its shift from personal to cultural ("we men"), it asserts that within the confines of discourse thus feminized philosophical man will not speak. The dialogue continues only because Fred's wife neither takes offense nor pursues her thought against his silence but abandons it to solicit his: " 'Yes, you have, too. Go on. You thought of some- thing.' " In an uninterrupted speech of thirty-five lines, and with a rhetorical power perhaps unrivaled in Frost, Fred's philosophical meditation takes the resistance of counterwave to flow as emblematic of the movement of life- of what Bergson called an effort of spirit "to re-mount the incline that matter descends" (Creative Evolution, 245). " 'Speaking of contrar- ies,' " he begins, " 'see how the brook / In that white wave runs counter to itself. / It is from that in water we were from / Long, long before we were from any creature. . . . ' "</page><page sequence="24">426 Donald G. Sheehy "It is this backward motion toward the source, Against the stream, that most we see ourselves in, The tribute of the current to the source. It is from this in nature we are from. It is most us." (259-60) Threatening an economy of realist dialogue, the power and gravity of Fred's discourse, when measured against his wife's, also confirms the hi- erarchical distinction between man's and woman's voice that is endorsed by his wife's response. "Today will be the day You said so." "No, today will be the day You said the brook was called West-Running Brook." "Today will be the day of what we both said." (260) Describing it as one of the notably successful marriages in Frost, Oster argues that "West-Running Brook" brings "not only two people into harmony but also words and that which words are attempting to repre- sent." His intellectual imagining begins with his wife's questions, and is further stimulated by her imaginings. Although he protests that he cannot follow her to Ladyland where a wave is intentionally wav- ing, he takes off from her vision into his Bergsonian lecture. "Speaking of contraries," he begins, but no one had been speaking of contraries. No one had mentioned the word, but the couple had been voicing and then creatively joining their very different ways of seeing. (214) At issue, however, here as in Frost's other marriage poems, is how very different ways of seeing are joined. Someone had in fact been speaking of "contraries," and by returning to that point in his wife's speech to begin, Fred effectively displaces from significance what had followed. Having relegated her imaginings about marriage and faith to "lady-land," he appropriates and incorporates such concerns about love and spirit into a philosophical-poetic discourse that, despite its own foun- dation in the intuitive and religious, is defined by opposition as masculine. If Fred's speech, as Oster observes, amounts to a "lecture," then it is instructive to note how it is received. While his philosophical argument</page><page sequence="25">Gender and Voice in Frost 427 is open to challenge, as Frost well knew, from a variety of religious, sci- entific, and philosophical perspectives, his wife grants him without de- mur the very authority to speak for "us" he had denied her. While she is apparently to some degree persuaded, the poem gives no voice to her understanding, no sense of her intellectual imagining being stimulated by his imaginings. Thus, Oster's insistence that "she not only imagines, she names, and he wants to be sure to credit her with that as surely as she wants to credit him with his major assertions" seems strained in its willingness to find equal value assigned by each to the speech of the other. Rather, the value Fred assigns to his wife's imaginings derives from their expression of a feminine perspective complementary in its subordination to his masculine. Her perception of the brook's difference is first offered not as a statement but as a question, and she names it only after he asserts that "North is there, my love. / The brook runs west." In the end, she declares the day memorable for his philosophical remarks, while he offers to commemorate not an imaginative discourse he con- signed to lady-land but a derivative act of naming. If the rest of what she said is reclaimed for them as valuable, it is so only relatively and by her: "Today will be the day of what we both said." A desire to see an equality of subjects similarly strains Oster's other- wise fine reading of "Two Look at Two." For after noting the disparity in the depiction of the perceptions of the doe and the buck, she concludes that "between the two couples, the greater harmony is with the human lovers, who are together throughout the poem in contrast to the deer who see the same view separately": "Two had seen two whichever side you spoke from," but the man- ner of seeing differed from side to side. The human lovers see ev- erything together, not only at the same time, but in the same way. . . . [T]he deer . . . see the same view not only at different moments but with different attitudes, different levels of perception, and dif- ferent abilities to understand. The respectful communication so nec- essary to human love is present in the human lovers and totally absent in the deer. (92-93) "For this reason alone," Oster concludes of the original closing dia- logue, "it is better that Frost chose to end the poem where he does" (277). The "respectful communication so necessary to human love" in Frost, however, depends precisely upon the hierarchical complementa- rity that results when men and women recognize and accept that they see the same view with different attitudes, different levels of perception, and different abilities to understand. And for that reason I believe it is</page><page sequence="26">428 Donald G. Sheehy also better that we attend closely not only to the original dialogue of "Two Look at Two" but to the dialogue of male and female in all of Frost. Edinboro University of Pennsylvania Edinboro, Pennsylvania NOTES A portion of this essay, in an earlier form, was presented to a session on Frost and sexuality at the 1993 convention of the Modern Language Association in Tor- onto, Ontario. 1. The Poetry of Robert Frost, ed. E. C. Lathem (New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1969), 229-30; all subsequent quotations are from this edition. 2. The typescript of "Two Look at Two" sent to Cox is in the Frost Collection of the Dartmouth College Library (No. 920417). It differs substantially from the published poem at lines 17-19: "She saw them in their pasture; they saw her / In hers. (They hoped she saw that they were two.) / The trouble of discerning what stood still"; and at lines 26-27: "But no, not yet. A snort to bid them wait, / A click of horny footsteps, and a buck / From round the selfsame spruce stood looking at them" (see Oster, 277). 3. For a reading of the distrust and containment of the female/generative/ irrational in the masculinist erotics of Frost's poets, see Katherine Kearns, "The Serpent's Tail: Robert Frost and a Poetics of Appetite," Western Humanities Review 47 (Summer 1993): 110-31. On the related issue of masculinity and homosocial discourse in Frost, see James R. Dawes, "Masculinity and Transgression in Rob- ert Frost," American Literature 65 (June 1993): 297-312. 4. Frost has Job take slight but significant liberties with the third stanza of Ed- mund Waller's "Song" ("Go, lovely rose?"): "Small is the worth / Of beauty from the light retired; / Bid her come forth, / Suffer herself to be desired, / And not blush so to be admired." 5. Bergson hints in Creative Evolution at a relation between philosophical intu- ition and maternal love: Like eddies of dust raised by the wind as it passes, the living turn them- selves, borne up by the great blast of life. They are therefore relatively stable, and counterfeit immobility so well that we treat each of them as a thing rather than as a progress. ... At times, however, in a fleeting vision, the invisible breath that bears them is materialized before our eyes. We have this sudden illumination before certain forms of maternal love, so striking, and in most animals so touching, observable even in the solici- tude of the plant for its seed. This love, in which some have seen the great mystery of life, may possibly deliver us life's secret. It shows us each gen- eration leaning over the generation that shall follow. It allows us a glimpse of the fact that . . . the essence of life is in the movement by which life is transmitted. (128)</page><page sequence="27">Gender and Voice in Frost 429 This observation occurs in a chapter about the "Development of Animal Life," a stage at which instinct has not acquired the self-consciousness of human intu- ition, and Bergson leaves unstated the relation at the human level between the mother and the "we" who perceive the significance of her "instinctive" care. An implication remains that it is not the female/mother but the male/philosopher who is the adequate interpreter. 6. The gender distinctions of the opening exchange are readily confirmed for us by an attempt to reverse the speakers- a strategy used to great effect by Robin Lakoff to demonstrate the levels at which language is gendered.
