The paste is compact and black, with a noticeable admixture of tiny flakes and larger round grains of gravel. Traces of soot indicate use for cooking. Two sherds bear drilled holes (Fig. 84, 5) showing repair and continued use after cracks had developed, as was often the case during the Neolithic and Bronze Age in the Lena Valley. This pottery differs markedly from the crude, massive, and usually stamped wares of the coastal Eskimo sites. Its main features link it with pottery dated to the end of the Neolithic and the Bronze Age on the lower Lena and especially on the Kolyma, where all the traits of the Lake Chirovoe ware occur, including traces of hair on the outer, and occasionally inner, surfaces. The stone- working technique substantiates this. The arrowpoint is analogous in form and technique to many others in Late Neolithic-Early Bronze sites on the Lena and Koly- ma. In the latter region, obsidian was also widely used for arrowpoints from early times. A date of 1500-1000 B.C. is suggested for the Lake Chirovoe finds on this basis. The absence of pottery at the Yakitikiveem site makes it difficult to judge its relationship to Lake Chirovoe; the stone artifacts are also of different materials. How- ever, it is suggested that Yakitikiveem may be earlier. In any event, the early hunting culture of the interior of the Chukchi Peninsula is definitely linked with that of the lower Lena and Kolyma, and indicates that the area was settled from the west, rather than from the south by peoples of the coastal strip stretching north from the Amur and Sakhalin. It will be of particular interest to American archae- ologists to note that these stone artifacts from the Chukchi Peninsula, as well as those from the Kolyma, remind Okladnikov of comparable material from Alaska as reported by Giddings (1949, 1950) and Rainey (1939, 1940), which typologically, by north Asiatic standards, can be related to the Late Neolithic of the Lena Valley. He feels these Alaskan finds are probably contemporary with the Chukchi Peninsula material, and that together they constitute evidence of pre-Eskimo links between CA I FIG. 85. northeast Siberia and America. They are, of course, far removed from any early human movements in the area. GIDDINGS, J. L., JR. 1949 Early Flint Horizons on the North Bering Sea Coast.

Longyear, in his excellent presentation of the ceramics of Copan (1952), describes a vessel which he tentatively labels an incense burner. The vessel in question belongs to his Archaic period (?-A.D. 300). He considers it to be the only vessel from this period with possible ceremonial connotations. Quoting Longyear (p. 24): "It is a thick-walled, rough-finished vase, set on three solid cylinder legs (fig. 42a [reproduced here as Fig. 86, a]). The body is pierced by a number of large, horseshoe-shaped holes. This may very well have been an incensario of some sort." Longyear gives more details about the same vessel (p. 92). "Other thick- walled, coarsely finished sherds appear to come from incensarios of jar type, only two of which could be reconstructed. One is a large jar, of 'hourglass' silhou- ette, supported on three long solid cylinder legs. The walls are pierced by an undetermined number of horse- shoe-shaped windows, and the basal angle bears inden- tations made by the fingertip (fig. 42a). Rim diameter is 22 cm, over-all height is 30 cm, Archaic period." The other jar-shaped incensario with spiked decoration re- constructed by Longyear belongs to his Classic period and will not be discussed here. There is little doubt in my mind that the "hourglass- shaped vessel supported on three solid cylinder legs" from Copan is an incense burner. However, I would like to add that it is not an incensario with 3 supports. 284 [ XX, 3, 1955</page><page sequence="2">FACTS AND COMMENTS The "supports" are in actuality prongs making this specimen a member of the "3-pronged incense burner" complex, a feature common in the pre-Classic and Late Classic archaeological deposits at Kaminaljuyui and else- where in Guatemala (Borhegyi 1950; 1951a; 1951c). This is not the first time that this mistake has been made. A similar incense burner "with three legs" from Finca El Progresso (Dept. Santa Rosa in Guatemala) was illustrated by Kidder, Jennings, and Shook (1946 Fig. 202, c). I had an opportunity in 1950 to examine this specimen and realized that it belonged to a group of newly recognized ceremonial vessels which I later described as 3-pronged incense burners (Borhegyi 1950a). If the specimen from Copan is turned right- side-up it can be seen that it also belongs to this cate- gory (Fig. 86, b). Although the Early pre-Classic 3-pronged incense burners from Guatemala are taller on the average (30-40 cm.) than the Copan specimen and frequently have effigy prongs instead of plain prongs, the triangular or horseshoe-shaped windows are a well- recognized characteristic of this type of vessel (Borhegyi 1951a: 111; 1951c Fig. 1, a). The plain-pronged type is common during the Miraflores and Arenal phases (1000B.C.-A.D. 1), whereas the effigy-pronged type seems to be dominant during the earlier Las Charcas and Providencia-Sacatepequez phases (2000-1000 B.C.) of the pre-Classic period in the Guatemalan highlands. For some reason 3-pronged incense burners are absent from the Santa Clara phase of the pre-Classic (A.D. 1-200) and from the Early Classic Aurora and Esperanza phases (A.D. 200-500). During the Late Classic period (A.D. 500- 900) they reappear in somewhat changed form and 4c FIG. 86. a, Tripod incense burner, Archaic period, Copan, Honduras, as illustrated by Longyear; ht. 30 cm., rim dia. 22 cm. b. Same as a but turned to appear as 3-pronged incense burner. c. Rimhead vessel from Santo Domingo, Oaxaca, Mexico, in Frissell collection, Mitla; ht. 33 cm., rim dia. 38 cm. both plain and effigy prongs are equally common. Dur- ing the pre-Classic the distribution of 3-pronged incense burners seems to be confined to the Guatemalan high- lands but in the Late Classic they appear as far east as Quirigua (Borhegyi 1951a Fig. 4, b-plain-pronged type) and at San Pedro Sula and Travesia on the north- west coast of Honduras (Stone 1941: 82 and Figs. 93 and 94, j, o - effigy-pronged type). It is therefore to be expected that a specimen of this type of incense burner should have been found at Copan although its appear- ance in the Archaic period is somewhat startling. The 3-pronged incense burners of Guatemala are usually found associated with deeply-scored covers which give the appearance of being shallow bowls, occasionally with apron overlap and inferior loop han- dles (Borhegyi 1951a Fig. 5, c-f). These were placed atop the 3 prongs. Consequently they are fire-blackened on the interior, the incense having been burned on the top of the incense burner between the prongs. Similar shallow bowls with incised decoration are present in Copan although they were not recognized as 3-pronged incense burners. Longyear describes them (1952: 91) as "incised shallow simple bowls with fairly thin walls." He had no information on the base so it is not known if they had attached loop handles. They bear simple linear incisions (Longyear 1952 Fig. 37, a) and some have smoke-blackened exteriors. For this reason Long- year believes that they might have been used in cooking as small comales. Their rim diameters range between 18 and 34 cm. Since the basal diameter of his censer is 22 cm. it is fully possible that some of these "incised shallow bowls" are actually deeply-scored incense burner covers and were supported on top of the 3 prongs of the hourglass-shaped censers. Smoke from the burning incense would have caused their fire-blackened appear- ance. The only problem seems to be the fact that these incised shallow bowls are from Longyear's Early and Full Classic period, A.D. 450-600 and A.D. 600-800 respec- tively, and not from the Archaic period. There seem to be 2 alternatives, either these fire-blackened shallow bowls are holdovers from the Archaic or Longyear is incorrect in assigning the hourglass-shaped incensario to this period. Longyear also mentions "comales with interior han- dles" (1952: 92 and Fig. 35, i). I am inclined to think that these may represent a local form of the Late Clas- sic rimhead vessel at Copan. Longyear describes these fragments (1952: 91) as resembling "loophandled co- males in general form. Here, however, handles are hollow cones, rising from interior surface, close to rim. Number of handles per vessel not known, but probably one or two. Period: Last half of Full Classic." Not having seen the actual specimens it is hard for me to say if Longyear is right or wrong in calling them co- males. Certainly hollow loop-handled comales are not known in Guatemala nor, to my knowledge, elsewhere in Mesoamerica, but vessels with 3 plain hollow interior loops have been reported from Uaxactun and I have seen 2 restored specimens of this kind in the Frissell 285</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY collection in Mitla, Oaxaca, which are believed to have come from Santo Domingo near Etla, Oaxaca (Fig. 86, c). They have a single, rather carelessly drawn line of red paint on the interior of the rim. One of the sherds from the "comales with interior handles" in the Copan collection (Longyear 1952: 91) has a similar red line around the interior of the rim. If my theory is correct, the Copan specimens when properly reconstructed would resemble the type of ceremonial vessel known as rimhead vessels. These are closely related both in shape and function to the 3-pronged incense burner complex. The plain or effigy prongs of these vessels may also have supported deeply-scored covers, in which case the in- cised shallow bowls from Copan were probably used in connection with them rather than as comales or cook- ing utensils. Unfortuately there is no information on the date or period of the Oaxaca specimens but Late Classic rimhead vessels are common in Mesoamerica and their presence in plain or effigy-prong form at Copan would not be surprising (for their distribution see Borhegyi 1951c: 176; 1951a: 118). The anthropomorphic effigy incense burner illustrated by Longyear (Fig. 88, e) and believed to be of Full Classic date is similar in all respects to a type of incense burner characteristic of the Early Classic Esperanza phase of the Guatemalan highlands. These have been designated loop-nose incense burners because of the looplike protrusion on the upper half of the vessel wall (Borhegyi 1951b; 1951d Fig. 6). The Copan specimen, although from the Full Classic period, undoubtedly be- longs to this category of incense burner. From an analysis of the data presented above it might seem that Longyear's breakdown of the archaeological periods at Copan is open to some question. It may be that the Archaic period at Copan started unusually late but that possibility notwithstanding, the earlier part, at least, of his Full Classic should probably be equated with the later part of the Early Classic Esperanza phase of the Guatemalan highlands.

April, 1954 CHINESE FIGURINES IN MESOAMERICA In a recent article J. Alden Mason (1951) called at- tention to 2 small Chinese figurines found in local archaeological collections in Mesoamerica. One was from Azqueltan, Jalisco, Mexico and is now in the University Museum, Philadelphia (catalog number NA- 11808), and the other was in the Vitalino Robles collec- tion of Quezaltenango, Guatemala. Both are of a soft stone and were described as "crawling infants." While browsing through a collection of archaeological objects in an antique shop in Guatemala City I came across another small Chinese figurine similar in most respects to the ones described by Mason. The shop owner, unaware of the Oriental origin of this specimen, was sure that it must have come in with the other arti- facts from Kaminaljuyu, a large archaeological site on the outskirts of the city. The figurine has been presented to the University Museum (catalog number 54-4-1). Like the Quezaltenango specimen (Mason 1951 Fig. 1, a), the stone figurine from Guatemala City is an opaque yellowish-amber color with reddish veins and has a very soft, soapy texture (Mohr scale 2.8). It is made of agalmatolite, "the poor man's jade" in China. It also seems to represent a crawling infant. The head, which now is broken, is large and the limbs short and rudimentary. The wide nose, closed eyes, mouth, and ears are represented by light incisions. These, like the body features, are somewhat worn, probably from much handling. The arms and legs are stubby and the hands and feet are not shown but the female genitalia are distinctly marked (Fig. 87, a). The specimen has been perforated with a diameter of 3 mm., obliquely from front to back through the neck. This perforation gives the impression of recency and was undoubtedly made so that the figurine could be worn as a pendant (Fig. 87, b). The specimen from Guatemala City is slightly larger than the ones from Azqueltan and Quezaltenango, comparing with them as follows: Length Guatemala City .....................4.8 cm. Azqueltan .... ....................... 3.7 cm. Quezaltenango ...........................3.4 cm. Height 2.1 cm. 2.3 cm. 2.0 cm. Width 2.8 cm. 2.1 cm. 1.6 cm. 286 [ XX, 3, 1955</page></plain_text>
