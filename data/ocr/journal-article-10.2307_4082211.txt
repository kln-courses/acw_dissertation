<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bird Study.-Andrew J. Berger. 1961. John Wiley and Sons, Inc. xi + 389 pp., 178 figs.-There seems little point in attempting a comparison between this book and the other general, elementary texts on ornithology that have appeared recently. Despite the fact that the present work would not suffer from such a comparison, the scope of Bird Study warrants individual consideration. This was not intended to be a definitive text on the subject. As specifically stated in the preface, it was written for use in a one-semester course for liberal arts students, in which Pettingill's A Laboratory and Field Manual of Ornithology would be used as a supplement. Accordingly, the author has permitted himself the luxury of a modicum treatment of morphology and physiology. A perusal of the "Contents" substantiates the implication, inherent in the title and spelled out in the preface, that the emphasis ". . . is on the living bird." The 11 chapters are headed, "Introducing the Bird," "Field Identification," "Bird Habits," "Migration," "Behavior," "Song," "Courtship and Nest Building," "Eggs and Young," "Structure and Function," "Conservation," and "Systematics." Eight pages of individual chapter references, 11 of "Common and scientific names of birds," and a 17-page index complete the book. The numerous illustrations are well chosen and generally very good. The emphasis on behavior, both in the specific ethological and in the more gen- eral bionomic sense, may come as a surprise to those who consider Berger as primarily an avian anatomist. To preclude any suggestion that the book fails in the author's intent to supply a sufficiency of anatomical background for the purpose intended, we should note that in addition to the one chapter on structure and func- tion, further morphological information is incorporated elsewhere, notably in Chapters one, six, seven, and eight. Despite its intriguing aspects, the chapter devoted specifically to behavior was, for this reviewer, one of the least satisfactory in the book. This is not, necessarily, an indictment of the manner in which it was written. In fact, the calculated avoid- ance of anthropomorphic reasoning is extremely gratifying. Rather, this objection stems from the reviewer's impatience with the inane welter of terminology with which ethologists seem bent on duplicating some of the earlier aura of ecology. Readers unsympathetic toward the Lorenz-Tinbergen school, specifically, are not likely to enjoy this section. In view of the relatively heavy treatment cf the "doing" bird, Berger manages to include a surprising variety of other subject matter. Much of the material reflects the current literature, despite the fact that the treatment is, of necessity, frequently scanty. Thus, the section on migration (p. 123) explains proximate and ultimate factors but does not mention the refractory period. Despite (or be- cause of?) the brevity in many cases, however, nonbiology majors may acquire an insight into a considerable amount of subject matter impinging upon, but not usually treated in, ornithology courses. In this connection, most of the references listed are cited in the text. Numerous experiments and reports mentioned through- out various chapters, however, are not included in the literature citations. The author rationalizes that most of this information is common knowledge to ornitholo- gists and therefore that excessive documentation would merely be distracting in an elementary text. Nevertheless, he envisions the work as a possible ". . . source book for teachers in elementary and high schools and for parents of inquisitive</page><page sequence="2">October] Reviezus 653 children," as well as a college text. It may well be, therefore, that some of his readers would benefit by knowing where to find such things as Yeatter's discussion of the possible effects of excessive air temperature on the southern distribution of Ring-necked Pheasants (p. 73), or Yeagley's paper on the postulated effects of the Coriolis force in bird navigation (p. 127). The few errors of commission noted were mostly of small moment. Pseudotsuga taxifolia has been in synonomy for some time (p. 119). Kudzu has proved to be less than a blessing in the forestry-conscious southeast (Fig. 3, p. 313), and it came as a surprise to this reviewer to see the Galliformes categorically listed among the birds possessing a "penis" (pp. 190 and 301). One of the most delight- ful facets of the text is the author's candid and frequently iconoclastic expose, ranging from the ostensible perspicacity of some ethologists (p. 133), through the diarrheic pens of some taxonomists (pp. 337 and 341). Furthermore, Bird Study assumes considerable stature through its emphasis on the "principle approach" to its subject. Biology has traditionally been taught as a cold, hard core of facts, to be memorized and then regurgitated when the proper string was pulled. It is patent that facts are necessary before thinking is possible, but the assimilation of facts all too frequently has been, and is, an end in itself. It is refreshing, there- fore, to encounter an elementary text in which man's biological ignorance is not only admitted but glaringly delineated, and in which the reader's attention is di- rected toward some of the more spacious and hence significant questions that challenge our ingenuity. Berger notes the necessity of a teacher to go with a text in any good college course; granting the assumption, Bird Stutdy could provide the basis for a good course in ornithology.-ERNEST E.
