The swamps, lakes, and jungles of this lowland zone provided Olmec communities important resources for subsis- tence as well as surpluses for exchange. Studies of Olmec imagery clearly demonstrate that their religious concepts were tied to this envi- ronment. Jaguars, terrestrial and water ser- pents, crocodiles, and certain fish and birds are the most common representations, and they are thought to have been associated with the cult of water, the earth, and fertility ( Joralemon 1971, 1976; Pohorilenko 1977, 1986; Coe 1972; Diehl 1989; Grove 1968, 1972, 1987). Anthropomorphic axe "El Bebé" (detail) from La Merced, Early Formative period, stone Photograph: Proyecto Manatí The problem of excess water - swamps, lakes, and the frequent inundations - led low- land Olmecs to construct great drainage sys- tems, such as those found at San Lorenzo (Coe and Diehl 1980), La Venta (Heizer et al. 1968), and Laguna de los Cerros (Ortiz 1986). Hydrau- lic engineering also had a pragmatic as well as sacred purpose, for despite the wet environment, potable water was in great demand. Hence, nat- ural springs were valued, and sophisticated sys- tems were designed to transport potable water to settlements. Ethnohistoric data and recent offerings found in sacred areas at El Manatí (see Ortiz and Rodriguez, this volume), and pos- sibly at La Merced, demonstrate the locations of many important early cult centers, and some of these regions continue to have ritual signifi- cance today for indigenous communities (Ortiz et al. 1988, 1989, 1990, 1996; Ortiz and Rodri- guez 1989, 1995, 1997; Rodriguez and Ortiz 1994; compare Eliade 1991, 1994). From the beginning, we considered it a priority to continue investigations at Cerro Manatí, and at other sites like El Macay al and La Merced, to understand the broader socio- cultural context for Olmec ritual offerings at both the local and regional levels. More infor- mation is needed from these sites and others in the region to provide insight into the moti- vations for Olmec society to create large-scale offerings. Did they include nearby communities, and perhaps some even farther away like San Lorenzo, Portrero Nuevo, and other settlements still undiscovered? We undertook the survey at La Merced dur- ing the 1994 season, creating a map with data on topography, activity areas, and the location of stratigraphie units excavated in the site cen- ter and in domestic spaces on the outskirts (fig. 1). The site zone was divided into sectors accord- ing to the spatial arrangement of structures. The site center was named the Ceiba Group, while the area with low and dispersed mounds located toward the south was designated the Cocuite and Tiznada Groups. The Archaeological Zone The archaeological zone of La Merced is located scarcely 2 kilometers in a straight line north- east of the site of El Macayal, which was likely only a few minutes by water when the area 155</page><page sequence="3">was inundated. La Merced forms part of a group of islets that we have called the archipelago of El Manatí, where modern and ancient popu- lations have lived (fig. 2). At present there is a small cooperative community (ejido) that has recently sprung up, although most of the site center is on private property utilized for cattle raising. The site takes its name from the mod- ern community of La Merced to the north. La Merced is located on the highest part of an island and was possibly filled over in some areas during ancient times. Site planning was not well defined, as seen by the irregular distri- bution of structures. Nevertheless, the layout follows a common pre-Hispanic community pattern: platforms and pyramidal structures distributed around open spaces that form plazas and public and residential areas. Taking advantage of the higher natural topography to the north is a residential area, consisting of a complex with small rooms, some bordered by patios. To the west of this area, a residential group occupies a low rise and consists of a small plaza surrounded by elongated parallel platforms with mounds clos- ing off the plaza at its north and south ends. This residential group is located on the high- est elevation at the site, and the slopes were possibly modified to function as containment walls in the event of flooding. In addition, it is likely that canals were dug out, thereby pro- viding quick access to the interior public and habitational zones of the site. The site center, the Ceiba Group, is located to the south and is defined by a plaza, which is formed by two platforms and a mound clos- ing off the east end and a small platform on its west end. A great mound rises to the east, but at a considerably lower elevation, and could therefore be associated with this elevated plaza. However, it would seem that the mound's prin- cipal facade faces east - the direction of the lake rather than the plaza. It is possible that this mound was constructed before the great plaza and was incorporated functionally into the plaza at a later date. In the northeast section of the central plaza, the constructions consist of large platforms arranged in an L shape. To the southeast, next to one of the main platforms of the plaza, the terrain was modified to form terraces that lead down to what was likely a pier or quay on an artificial canal leading to La Merced Lake. This canal provided access to the religious center, arriving directly at the principal mound and then branching off in other directions. Ceram- ics from excavations here indicate that the most recent occupation at the site dates to the Late Classic period, but Early Formative mate- rials were found occasionally in the deepest levels (Ortiz and Rodriguez 1997). Various stratigraphie excavations over two seasons in 1994 and 1995 were also carried out in the Cocuite and Tiznada Groups to locate and define the earliest Olmec occupations.

Excavations uncovered an Early For- mative settlement (fig. 3). Located southeast of the monumental zone, Unit 3 of the Ceiba Group revealed the most interesting information of all the excavation units. Initially it was outlined as a stratigraphie pit measuring 1.5 by 1.5 meters, oriented north- south; however, various concentrations of axes were discovered, and it was necessary to extend the unit. In the end, a total area of 30 by 30 meters was excavated, encompassing a mas- sive offering of more than six hundred axes, the majority of which were carved from lime- stone and kaolin. These axes were found with ceramics and other artifacts that date to the end of the Early Formative period and were perhaps contemporaneous with the offerings of serpentine mosaics found at La Venta. We present here only a preliminary inter- pretation of the data, based on our observa- tions during excavations at the site; a detailed analysis of the materials is still pending. From the stratigraphy, we infer that the space where the offerings were placed witnessed three sep- arate events later than the domestic midden found in the deepest levels (fig. 4). The first and oldest offering contains axes of the smallest dimensions and the most well defined forms. These axes were arranged in open semicircles, either in groups of four or five axes or with individual axes standing apart. The small axe with the incised human-feline personage was found in this offering. The nat- ural stratum where the offering was located had sedimented in a way that preserved the original placement of these objects. This layer (IV) was located low on a slope with regular deposition. The second axe offerings, located in layer Did, expand to the east. With these events, the most important and abundant offerings were put in place. Some changes are noteworthy, particularly the technique of making the axes, the different axe forms and dimensions, and RODRÍGUEZ AND ORTIZ I57</page><page sequence="5">5 .

Anthropomorphic axe in situ Photograph: Proyecto Manatí the lesser quality of axe material, now primar- ily limestone and kaolin stone. A new type of axe arrangement is also apparent: the axes were placed with their cutting edges pointing up- ward and poll ends down (fig. 5). The surface finish of the axes tends to be better, with clear definition of axe forms and their polls, which tend to be more rectangular. However, the overall forms lack the symmetry seen for the axes from the earlier event. While the area of this second offering was extensive, the greatest concentration was found toward the southeast where the anthropo- morphic sculpture "El Bebé" (The Baby), was found surrounded by many axes, stone axe pre- forms and nodules, tecomates, and fragments of pyrite mirrors (figs. 6-8). Also found in this southeast zone is a probable sculpture located during this 1996 season (S3E4), which also had associated axes, fragments of hematite mir- rors, and a tecomate (figs. 9- 11). The third offering is observed in layer Illb where, in general, stone preforms, nodules, and un worked stone predominate (fig. 12). From this layer came the stela or worked stone with a human-feline face, but the number of axes diminished considerably, and tecomates and hematite mirror fragments are absent. This last offering is concentrated in the southern part of the unit. At this time, the site still retained a sacred character but could have been losing impor- tance, or alternatively, the new characteristics of the offerings could well have signified chang- ing ritual patterns. Stratigraphy The stratigraphy at La Merced is similar to that described for the 1994 season (Ortiz and Rodri- guez 1995), except for some modifications in nomenclature by Antonio Flores, an investi- 158 RODRÍGUEZ AND ORTIZ</page><page sequence="6">9- Ceramic vessel (tecomate) with an axe offering Photograph: Proyecto Manatí io.

There were some dis- tinctive soil lenses caused by the fluctuation of the water table that helped us to better define the stratigraphy and the sequences of the offerings. The significant strata are described in table i. These strata numbers cor- respond to those mentioned above for the var- ious massive offerings. The Stone Mask This flat stone, Monument i, has a rectangular shape, 72 centimeters in total length, although its carved length is 63 centimeters. It has a maximum width of 40 centimeters and a thick- ness of 9 centimeters. Only one surface is carved (fig. 13). Each of the four corners shows four small rectangles. A V-shaped cut occurs in the upper part of the stone, while the right lower flank has what appear to be crudely outlined, open eyes. Toward the center of the stone was another carved V-shaped cut, with a conical oval cap appearing to emerge behind the cut. Below the upper rectangles, a face was carved. The elongated eyes had slightly curved irises, giving the image the appearance of squinting. The nose is wide, and the nostrils seem to bring forth a liquid draining over its upper lip. The tip of the nose is formed by a small square that seems to pass behind and below the lip and delineates teeth. The mouth is the most com- plicated element and somewhat atypical (fig. 14). The upper lip is very thick and elevated from the surface and has drooping corners. Toward the center of the mouth emerges a shell-shaped flower similar to the teeth of a feline or shark. Below this element is another feature that could represent the gum, while RODRÍGUEZ AND ORTIZ I59</page><page sequence="7">Table i.

The carving of the thin lip is at the same height as that of the gum, while just below the lip is another small square. The lower part of the monument has a carved tang or stem that is broken on the right side, perhaps caused by a defect in the primary material. Anthropomorphic Sculpture "El Bebé" This piece was equally interesting. It measures 40 centimeters in length, with a maximum width of 23 centimeters and a thickness of 8 centimeters. The first impression upon view- ing it is that of an infant crying with the eyes closed and swollen (fig. 15). The personage is standing. The forehead has a V-shaped cleft, and the closed eyes were carved with a horizontal line that continues almost unbroken toward its extremities, inter- rupted only by the nose. The eyelids seem inflamed and frame the eyes. The nose is flat but short; the mouth is open and occupies almost half of the face. The lips are shaped like brackets; the upper lip is thick with the cor- ners pointed upward. The neck is marked by a single line that separates the trunk or chest. The arms are crossed over the chest, and each hand holds a downward-pointing axe. The legs are plump, as are the feet and fingers. The ears are worked in the shape of rectangles. As with the stela, there is a V-shaped cleft on the fore- head, but not the conical cap. Arms are defined in its upper half. The buttocks are heightened; the legs are short and chubby. Olmec literature reports at least fourteen objects with similar characteristics. Each is a standing anthropomorphic axe that represents head, neck, body, and extremities. Each has a wide, flattened nose,- the upper Up of the mouth is prominent, with a downturned mouth, tooth- less visible gums, and the arms crossed over the chest. While the objects are not identical, the shared formal elements are numerous. Each of them, as in the example from La Merced, represents the head with the cleft, similar eyes, a mouth with canine teeth, and the lower extremities; and some carry an axe with the edge pointing downward. The best-known example is the Kuntz axe in the American Museum of Natural History, New York, of unknown provenience. Incised Axe with Human-Feline Personage This axe is really an irregular oval-shaped nod- ule, with one of its polished faces crudely carved with an anthropomorphic depiction of a human-feline personage. The eyes have the feline appearance with the irises outlined, and they appear to be squinting. The eyebrows are incised, incurved lines. The nose is wide, and the lower lip is thin, while toward the center of the upper lip one notes a "tooth." The lower edge of the face is indicated by a horizontal line. In the forehead is a V-shaped cut. The arms cross over the chest, with hands tucked under the arms, and are barely incised. The piece resembles a seated feline with its upper paws crossed over the chest. David Joralemon mentions a single axe from Cuauhtla that has a similar hand position (Joralemon 1971: 76, fig. 220). Small Axe with Relief The object in question is very small (10 centi- meters) in relation to the two previous exam- ples. It depicts a standing individual with the legs spread and the arms extended downward. The right leg is slightly raised as in the poise of a dancer or walker. The face is framed by a rectangular hair arrangement that hangs toward the sides and covers the ears. There is a V-shaped cut in the forehead, and from this cleft rises a cone. The 16.

Preliminary Discussion From the data obtained, it is clear that the La Merced offerings were deposited at various times. The oldest offering is associated with domestic activity, to judge by the presence of the midden located at the edge of the offering and what could have been a riverbed with per- manent but slow-moving water. A deposit of clays with lenses of sand and gravel was located in the lowest zone under the water table that formed the riverbed. The forms and decorative characteristics of the ceramics in these layers probably date to the end of the Early Forma- tive period. Subsequently, while layer Hid was forming, an axe offering was interred, with some of the axes intruding into the earlier midden. Most of the greenstone and limestone axes were posi- tioned horizontally rather than on end. After layer Hid was deposited, judging by the abundance of axes and lithic preforms and nodules of primary material, the most impor- tant offering was ritually interred. Also placed with these axes were sculpture and anthropo- morphic axes, tecomates, vases, polished black plates, and fragments of hematite that prob- ably were parts of mosaics and mirrors (fig. 10). The last offering included the mask, some worked stones without decoration, stone nod- ules, and other amorphous objects of primary material (figs. 16-18). The decreased number of axes was noteworthy. The data suggest that those involved in the rituals of which the axe offerings are our only remaining testimony must have had special motives for selecting La Merced to deposit their most valuable objects, whether of jade, other fine stone, or local materials. The offerings of La Merced were probably associated with a spring, old riverbed, or other source of water for the lake. The offering events may have been associated with agricultural cults, perhaps propitiatory rituals to maintain the equilibrium of rainfall - to save harvests or perhaps to improve them. If true, these were likely to have been performed at critical mo- ments, for reasons due to a lack of or an excess of water. Or perhaps "they corresponded to a celestial event that was repeated each year and had a great effect on the spectators, for example, the first appearance of the Pleiades on the day the sun crossed its zenith" (Pasztory 1993: 139), or also to the disappearance of the Pleiades dur- ing the month of May when the rains became more intense. This offering involved the appropriation of primary local and foreign resources and the work of a good number of people and artisans. Nevertheless, the quality and finish of the ob- jects were apparently not the most important RODRÍGUEZ AND ORTIZ 163</page><page sequence="11">feature. The importance of the items derived from their symbolic or ritual significance, a fact that exceeded their sumptuary and luxury character. It also suggests that common people in some cases could acquire the primary mate- rial. When the techniques of manufacture were unknown, or could not be acquired, they per- haps created the objects themselves, albeit more crudely, giving them the proper form as ritual objects which were then offered. This is a different phenomenon from that seen at El Manatí, where the quality of the material, as well as the execution, was always very careful and important, especially during the earliest periods (see Ortiz and Rodriguez, this volume). Through time this tendency also changed, beginning with the offering of the wood busts (Ortiz and Rodriguez 1997), when the axes show a preference for the material, rather than the quality of the completed object. In this case, the pattern had become more sim- ilar to La Merced and could be indicative of its contemporaneity. While we observe an evolu- tion in the significance of the axes at El Manatí, axes at La Merced already have a formal but distinctive imagery: an axe with carved human features and associated with other symbolic elements, such as figures holding axes, the V- shaped cut on the foreheads, and thick lips. Nevertheless, the quality of stone at El Ma- natí is superior to that at La Merced. To date, no limestone or other material of local origin has been recovered at El Manatí, with the exception of a sandstone example. At El Ma- natí, one notes a close relationship between the primary material, form, and significance or symbolism. The use of fine or precious stone at El Manatí required a great labor investment, including the acquisition of the primary mate- rial, its movement over great distances, and its fabrication into axes by specialized artisans, who were likely in the service of those who sponsored the offering, most likely a high- ranking social group. The Symbolism oí the Axe The axe as representation of an idea was also probably a metaphor for a myth (see Leach 1978: 52). In reality, however, we do not have specific evidence that indicates what precisely were the ideas symbolized by the axes (see Taube, this volume). They may have represented water and, as such, be an indicator of a water cult, particularly for having been carved primarily in jade or greenstone. In later Mesoamerican cultures there was an equivalence between jade, water, and the color green (Tibón 1983). The axes' petaloid forms are also reminiscent of raindrops and ears of corn, items associated with the fertility of mother earth. At La Merced, as at other sites where Olmecs offered axes, the axes' domestic significance likely trans- formed into a sacred and primordial element in ceremonies related to the cult of the deities of water (Anzures y Bolaôos 1990). Although distant in time, and always used with care, analogies to the data provided by the chroniclers, indigenous sources, and con- temporaneous ethnography contribute numer- ous ideas for interpretations of some possible Olmec religious practices. Many present-day indigenous groups preserve their myths and beliefs. Among the "Cakchiqueles de Coma- lapa wedge-shaped green stones (ancient ob- jects [axes] that are found in fields) were called 'lightning axes'" (Broda 1991: 468). In a transcription by Fray Gregorio García on the Mixteca, one reads: "And on the highest [part] of the house [palace] and habitation of these [creator] gods, there was a copper axe, with the cutting edge pointing upward, upon which was the sky" (Dahlgren 1990: 236). A sig- nificant percentage of axes found at La Merced were placed intentionally with their edges pointing skyward. The Chols believe that lightning, known as the Lord of Storms, possesses an axe with which he splits trees that, upon falling, some- times reveal an axe at the foot of the tree where lightning once fell. The association of axe- lightning-rain explains the myth. Also, ob- sidian is commonly called "lightning stone" because it is thought that where one finds it, a lightning bolt had fallen. This is a widespread concept in southern Veracruz. This idea apparently has a universal char- acter, given that among various African groups this axe-lightning-rain association has also been documented (Luzuy 1978). In this sense it is interesting that Philippe Luzuy (1978: 255) affirms that, in reference to a communal Afri- can ceremony, "it is known that throughout all the eras, in all of the countries of the world, all carved axes have been considered 'lightning stones'; among the attributes of Jupiter, one finds these lightning stones. The first pre- historic discoveries were by men looking for 164 RODRÍGUEZ AND ORTIZ</page><page sequence="12">'lightning stones' to possess them as protec- tive talismans, such as those presently used in Brittany, where they place them in the frame- work of houses." Along the Gulf Coast, many stories abound of children who, in the distant past, were lost in the forest and rescued by old people who lived in a magic hill. From this hill, they fabri- cated swords or axes and produced winds on which they flew, wearing capes. In some ver- sions, it is a flying axe that carries the child to the old owners of lightning; in others it is a deer. In all, the youth disobeys the prohibition against touching the magic instruments of lightning, provoking a catastrophe in which he submits himself to being tied to the bottom of the sea, converting himself into the "Old King." The Mixes have this belief, as well as the Totonacs, Tepehuas, Nahuas, and the Popo- lucas (Williams 1980; Técnicos Bilingües 1985). Shamans making rain (called "lightning men" in southern Veracruz and "men of hail" in the states of Mexico and Morelos) and the spirits to whom they dedicate their rites and offerings (that is, Spirit of the Volcanoes, dwarfs, old lightning) seem to have a common origin and in many cases are related to the origin myths of the Maize God. It is unsettling to note the parallel of the paraphernalia of these shamans with the effigy axes and Olmec sculptures that carry "padlocks," "gauntlets," "torches," and wear "capes." The axe was a tool of the gods of water and was, by extension, a symbol of this same ele- ment. As with all symbols, it had a polyvalent character, and its significance transformed or varied according to the ritual in which it was used. In other cases the axes symbolized power and status, as was suggested by the Olmec anthropomorphic figurines that typically hold fine stone axes in their hands or those that have perforations at their heels to be suspended as pendants. The two personages on Altar 18 from San Lorenzo hold an axe between their hands with arms crossed over their chests,- one carries an axe in the left hand with the edge pointing downward, while the other figure car- ries the axe in his right hand with the edge pointing upward. Also, on Monument 8 from San Lorenzo, known as the "billiard table," are six impressions that seem to be axes and are located on one of its flat surfaces, as if they had been embedded in the monument (Coe and Diehl 1980, 1: 313). Similar impressions appear on a basalt plaque from Laguna de los Cerros (Ortiz 1986). But the real function of the axes in agricul- ture, that is, cutting and burning, also had to have been related to some deity of the woods. In this sense, the representation of the tool used in deforestation would be the logical offer- ing to the spirits of the forest so that they would not harm those responsible for the cut- ting; the instruments used would likely have had to have been buried in the same place where the act had occurred. Among the indigenous groups of southern Veracruz, the dwarf is the owner of the forest and animals. He is in charge of punishing those who excessively cut down the forests and those hunters who indiscriminately kill the animals. These small dwarfs lived near springs, rivers, lakes, and any body of water,- to avoid them, one had to smoke a cigar or wear his clothing inside out. By their association with water, axes also relate to the helpers of Tlaloc, or tlaloques; the Aztecs believed that water was guarded within the mountains in large caves by the tlaloques, who eventually emptied or broke their clay vessels over the fields and at the four cardinal points, thereby causing rain. The tlaloques also regularly smoke cigars, for the smoke forms clouds, which then provoke rainfall. As we know, Tlaloc lived in paradise or Tlalocan, also called the "house of turquoises" or jades. The description of these dwarfs coincides perfectly with the personages carved on Olmec altars, like that at Corral Nuevo; and while they seem to represent magical entities, we do not know whether they were considered owners of the forests as the dwarfs are today or as tlaloques of the Aztecs. Conclusion Given that the central problem of the Olmecs was not, as in many other centers of civiliza- tion, the shortage of water but its excess, the ritual activity had to be directed toward its containment and control rather than entreaties for its abundance. In fact, the axes and other objects in the offerings such as ceramic vessels, figurines, and fine stone masks may have been hurled into the springs, rivers, arroyos, wells, and estuaries to call the rains, to conjure storms, or to exercise an effective control over the wax- RODRÍGUEZ AND ORTIZ 165</page><page sequence="13">ings of the moon, as the data of El Manatí, La Merced, or Arroyo Pesquero may suggest. The discovery and archaeological investi- gation of offerings like those at El Manatí or La Merced will help explain somewhat better the religious concepts of the Olmecs, in par- ticular the meaning behind the ceremonial axes, masks, portable figurines, and other objects that have been admired in the world's museums for their artistic quality and style. Museum pieces, as products of looting, lack provenience and context and therefore provide minimal help in interpreting the events in which they played an important, signaling role. Almost all anthropomorphic axes or carved reliefs of personages carrying axes are found in private or museum collections. The only ones that come from controlled excavations are, to date, those from La Merced and El Manatí. To the degree that scholars and aficionados can unite to prevent looting of precious Olmec arti- facts and to recover the important contextual information for them, to that degree we will enrich our knowledge of their history, beliefs, and ritual practices.
