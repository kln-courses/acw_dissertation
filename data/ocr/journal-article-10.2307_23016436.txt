<plain_text><page sequence="1">COLERIDGE, HARTLEY, AND 'THE NIGHTINGALE' BY PETER KNOX-SHAW Coleridge, towards the end of his annus mirabilis, famously recorded in the Gutch Notebook that a dead dog at a distance could smell like elderflowers. The observa tion—which has always been taken to be his own—was copied, in fact, from the first part of David Hartley's Observations on Man, the volume primarily concerned with psychology. That it falls in the Notebook between two other entries that contributed substantially to 'The Nightingale' suggests that the influence of Hartley—which is commonly thought to have peaked in the middle years of the decade—was still active when Coleridge wrote what he was first to describe as a 'conversation poem'. With some glances at the other poems in this group, the article reads 'The Nightingale' in the light of a number of Hartleyian reflections. These range from his concept of how an abstract idea can be 'enlivened' by a vivid sense impression, to his view that the appreciation of nature undergoes radical change through the 'different periods' of life, a concept that seems to have had repercussions on 'Tintern Abbey'. Of particular relevance to 'The Nightingale' is the strong analogy that Hartley draws between human and animal passions, and his concern with the non-verbal utterance of feeling. 'Somewhat startling', Lowes remarked of an observation recorded in the Gutch notebook by Coleridge when well advanced into his annus mirabilis (1797-98): A dunghill at a distance sometimes smells like musk, &amp; a dead dog like elder-flowers.— Evidently the entry left sufficient impression to be put to good and varied rhet orical effect many years later.2 In Omniana (1812), it was to provide the punch line of an elaborate joke: 'We here in England received a very high character of Lord E—, during his stay abroad'. 'Not unlikely, sir,' replied the traveller; 'a dead dog at a distance is said to smell like musk.'3 And when in Aids to Reflection (1825), Coleridge urges the virtue of restraint in religious polemic, he revamps the trope to warn against an untoward consequence of abusing antagonists: there is danger... if the punishment be [severe], of spreading far and wide their reputation as Martyrs, as the smell of a dead dog at a distance is said to change into that of Musk.4 1 J.

That it has always been taken as such is owing to the editorship of his nephew, who, lifting the entry from the Gutch notebook and prefacing it with a moral taken from Tacitus, inserted it into the manuscript of the posthumous Table Talk (1836),5 unaware no doubt that it was copied from the philosopher after whom his cousin Hartley was named. In context, the excerpt is of special interest seeing that Coleridge's response to his early mentor is widely understood to have peaked in the 'middle years of the decade', and to have assumed, on the whole, a moral and religious character.6 Anatomizing the sense of smell in his Observations on Man (1749), David Hartley presents a variant on a distinction dear to Coleridge, the case of an impression that differs only in degree while seeming to differ in kind: Thus an onion cut fresh, and held close to the nose, smells very like asa fetida; and asa fcetida, in an evanescent degree, like onion or garlic. Thus a dunghill at a distance has smelt like musk, and a dead dog at a distance like elder-flowers. And fetids are said to enhance the flavour of fragrants. The three last instances show, that pleasure and pain are very nearly allied to one another in this sense also.7 Unlike Coleridge, Hartley effectively buries the dead dog, subsuming at a stroke the raw odours of corpse and dung in the fetids of perfume manufacture. But the assuagement of pain through natural process is among the Hartleyian themes that Coleridge had previously addressed, notably in 'On Observing a Blossom on the First of February, 1796': the warm wooings of this sunny day Tremble along my frame and harmonize The attemper'd organ, that even saddest thoughts Mix with some sweet sensations, like harsh tunes Play'd deftly on a soft-toned instrument.8 Of more obvious relevance, however, to the 'conversation poems'—and more particularly so in view of Hartley's insistence that the senses are interchangeable in this respect—is the statement from Observations that immediately follows: It will be evident, upon a moderate attention, that the grateful smells, with which natural productions abound, have a great share in enlivening many of our ideas, and in the 5 Table Talk, ed.

Just how closely Coleridge's practice could conform to the philosopher s belief that sense impressions act as a spur to the ideational is clear as early as 'The Eolian Harp' where the scent off a bean-field, snatched by a breeze that carries sounds from the sea (muted by distance to a 'stilly murmur'), sets the stage for a series of rhapsodic abstractions.10 Revealingly, it was after Hartley's first attempt in the Observations to adumbrate the excitatory impact of 'vivid real impressions' on complex ideas that Coleridge noted in the margin: Ideas may become se as vivid &amp; distinct, &amp; the feelings accompanying them as vivid, as original Impressions—And this may finally make a man independent of his Senses.—one use of poetry." If poetry can provide a training in doing without the senses, it is on the premiss that it can vie with the senses in its vividness, that the poet can, in a nutshell, build his 'Dome in air'.12 It seems, then, that the poet's ideal in 'Kubla Khan' rests as much on Hartley's psychology, as does the vocational goal outlined in 'Religious Musings' (1794) with explicit reference to Hartley: progress towards a selfless state of'theopathy' that enables vision of 'the all in all'.13 Coleridge notoriously, and perhaps inevitably, came to dismiss Hartley's psych ology as mere dross, exempting only the second, more theological volume of the Observations on the grounds that it was 'independent of his peculiar system'.14 As far as the poetry is concerned, however, Hartley's dead dog is no caput mortuum. In the Gutch notebook the sentence transcribed from the first volume of the Observations falls between two other entries that were to contribute substantially to the text of 'The Nightingale', placed by its subtitle ('April 1798') as the last conversation poem of the great year. The later of these entries, positioned at the 9 Observations, I, 185. Though there is no external evidence for Hartley's familiarity with A Treatise on Human Nature (1739), his notion of an idea being 'enlivened' or 'vivified' by an impression coincides exactly with Hume's terminology.

The wish chimes with the philosopher's general theory of association, together with his belief in the naturally prevailing happiness of creation, and so too with the more specific tenet that the 'melody of birds' provides an epitome, or 'miniature', of the 'pleasures arising from the beauty of the natural world'.19 Though the 'love-chant' of Coleridge's nightingales is more openly anthropomorphic and erotic than Hartley's coy peep at the expression of instinct in the wild 'at certain ages and seasons of the year',20 the poem's tacit alignment of the birds' and babe's greeting of the moon falls squarely within the province of that broad analogy between human and animal experience that Hartley sets out with uncustomary boldness: I always suppose, that corresponding feelings, and affections of mind, attend upon them, just as in us. And the brute creatures prove their near relations to us, not only by the general resemblance of the body, but by that of the mind also; in as much as many of them have most of the eminent Passions in some imperfect degree, and as there is, perhaps, no passion 15 See lines 43-9, Poetical Works II. 1, 681. 16 Notebooks, I, 231. 17 Ibid., I, 219. 18 'To Josiah Wedgwood, Nov. 12 1800', Collected Letters, ed. Earl Leslie Griggs (Oxford, 1956), I, 647. 19 See particularly Observations, II, 23-30, I, 419. Coleridge appears to adopt Hartley's favoured notion of a sense impression acting as a 'miniature' of a complex idea when he remarks in a letter to a fellow poet that it is through images of rural beauty that the power of the divine is 'miniatured on the mind of the beholder'; see 'To George Dyer, 10 March 1795', Collected Letters, I, 154. 20 Observations, I, 412.</page><page sequence="5">COLERIDGE, HARTLEY AND THE NIGHTINGALE 437 belonging to human nature, which may not be found in some brute creature in a consid erable degree.21 In distinguishing between the 'articulate sounds' of speech, and 'musical and other inarticulate sounds', Hartley highlights a sector of the pre-linguistic—both gestural and vocal—that is held in common by animals and humans, the latter learning in infancy to select sounds and to attach public meaning to them through a process that involves both imitation and trial by error.22 Drawing on some of Hartley's terms, Coleridge introduces his babe as a being who communicates without words, just as do the nightingales whose 'sweet voices' are mimed to unique effect in words that expressly reach out to express the voiced non-verbal.23 Capable of 'no articulate sound',24 the babe 'Mars all things with his imitative lisp', but is imagined raising a finger to his ear to play out the act of listening—an instance of what the philosopher called 'dumb-shew'.25 In the notebook entry young Hartley cries after falling down and hurting himself, but in the poem he is rendered less active, waking from a dream to a feeling of distress. That the dream is caused by 'some inward pain' and that it continues to reverberate is wholly in keeping with the Observations, which refers the quality of a dream to the 'then state of body or mind', and accounts, too, for the after-effects of internal imagery.26 But as the babe's distress turns to rapt attention and to laughter, it is clear that the substitution serves what was perhaps at this period the most im portant to Coleridge of Hartley's many themes: the transmutation of inherent pain into pleasure through experience.2' This, after all, is the theme dramatized, earlier 21 Ibid., I, 413-14. 22 See particularly the section entitled 'An inquiry how far the power of distinguishing articulate sounds depends upon association', I, 228-31; also I, 105-7, and 225. For his discussion of the infant's attempts to imitate received sounds, see I, 107—8, 263; and for the erratic nature of these, see I, 106. Although Hartley took the term 'articulate sounds' from Locke (Essay, II.xi.8, 11), Coleridge confessed early in 1801 never hitherto to have 'really read1 him (Collected Letters, II, 679). 23 Hartley discusses the analogical application of 'language' to birds and beasts, I, 294. 24 'The Nightingale: A Conversation Poem, Written in April, 1798', line 92, Poetical Works II.1, 682. A more figurative use of the phrase occurs in 'Frost at Midnight' where the church-bells seem 'like articulate sounds of things to come!' (line 33). Kelvin Everest argues from the evidence of the Gutch notebook that the composition of the latter poem over lapped with that of 'The Nightingale'; see Coleridge's Secret Ministry (Hassocks, 1979), 286-7. 25 'The Nightingale: A Conversation Poem', lines 93-6, Poetical Works II. 1, 682. Hartley regards such mime as a primitive but highly effective means of communication; see Observations, I, 263, 410. 26 See Observations, I, 383-4, 385, 396. Hartley presents pain as endemic to infancy, and comments on the typical swiftness and intensity of mood switches in that state; see particularly I, 83, 105-6, 40. 27 Hartley explicitly grants a redemptive role to experience. Assuming an accumulative, overall 'excess of pleasure above pain', he infers that 'association, under the supposition of this corollary, has a tendency to reduce the state of those who have eaten of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, back again into a paradisiacal one' (I, 83). Compare Coleridge on the 'Progressive' nature of happiness in the first of his 'Lectures on</page><page sequence="6">438 PETER KNOX-SHAW in the poem, in the remodelling of the self-indulgent poet who reads his sorrows into the song of the nightingale, so shutting himself off from a nature in which 'there is nothing melancholy': he had better far have stretch'd his limbs Beside a brook in mossy forest-dell, By sun or moonlight, to the influxes Of shapes and sounds and shifting elements Surrendering his whole spirit, of his song And of his fame forgetful!28 In context the unrelenting convention of the nightingale's 'pity-pleading strains issues in a sort of poetic cloning ('he, and such as he', 'many a poet echoes the conceit') which serves to throw the varied and flux-like aspects of the natural scene into relief. And the poem's abundant emphasis on the energies of generation, realized not only in the birdsong, and the glow-worm's 'love-torch', but also through the babe in arms, extends to the responsive poet whose creations are seen to share in 'Nature's immortality'. If the poem fails, in the last analysis, to live up to its new model poet, it is no less satisfying or rich for deviating from its inbuilt theory, and perhaps no less Hartleyian either. The 'I' of the conversation winkingly owns up to his authorship of the earlier nightingale poem with its 'pity pleading strains',29 and not for long does he 'surrender his whole spirit' to the present scene, for he is soon launched into the recovery of a memory ('I know a grove / Of large extent, hard by a castle huge...') which is submitted, ostentatiously, to the shaping of literary convention in the telling. And while the 'most gentle Maid' at the centre of this tale may rate as the first twitcher recorded in literature, and her devotion to 'something more than Nature in the grove' be taken as compatible with romance, she remains aloof from the avian bacchanalia of which she is the imagined witness, even if she is by the standards of the earlier night-wander refreshingly open-eyed. A decided drop in emotional temperature is registered in the transition from the 'choral minstrelsy' of the birds to the ever-watchful maiden, and again in the switch from 'tipsy joy that reels with tossing head' to the calm conversational tone of the poet who talks of 'loitering long and pleasantly'. Indeed, the feelings excited in the birds and the babe by the suddenly disclosed moon seem to belong to a specially charmed realm of intensity. Hartley, in a section on the 'Pleasures arising from the beauties of the natural world', points to (and claims as a manifest confirmation of his approach) 'great differences in the kind and degree of the relish' proper to the 'different periods' of human life.30 Though his views on the relationship between Revealed Religion', in Lectures 1795, ed.

As seems partly to have been understood in the late eighteenth-century, it was in the suggestiveness of particular perceptions such as this, rather than in its imposing coherence, that the value of Hartley's psychology lay. Throughout the conversation poems Coleridge speaks through a variety of figures, autobio graphical or otherwise, a process exemplified in 'This Lime-Tree Bower my Prison' when the laid-up poet recreates the impact of a distant vista through the eyes of his friend, the habitually city-pent Charles, 'As I myself were there'. In both 'Frost at Midnight' and 'The Nightingale', the poet ranges through adult hood, childhood, adolescence and infancy, fleshing out the notion of a response to nature that varies in pitch and timbre according to circumstance and time of life. But the linear account is complicated by the success of the poet's imaginative recovery. Young moonstruck Hartley may, in the sequence of inspiration (revers ing that of composition), have given rise to the moonstruck nightingales, but, as far as the poem is concerned, both babe and bird are father to the man. When Wordsworth, addressing his wild-eyed sister in Tintern Abbey, reflects, 'in thy voice I catch / The language of my former heart,' he has in fact already attempted to find a language for the days when nature 'had no need for a remoter charm, / By thought supplied, nor any interest / Unborrowed from the eye';37 and in this he follows the precedent of the two great conversation poems. The music of church-bells that Coleridge remembers, while daydreaming of his birthplace, to have 'stirr'd and haunted me / With a wild pleasure', provides a foretaste of Wordsworth's description of his first experience of the landscape above the 31 Ibid., compare, for example, I, 423 with I, 80—1. 32 Ibid., I, 420. 33 Ibid., I, 422. 34 Hence Joseph Priestley's abridgement and free recasting of the Observations in the cause of rescuing 'many excellent articles' that would otherwise be lost in 'so very extensive a system'.
