<plain_text><page sequence="1">Martin Prozesky. Religion and Ultimate Wellbeing. Pp. ix+ 256. (Macmillan, 1984). ?20. The thesis of this book is that modern concepts of knowledge, and the global perspective of contemporary thought require a radically new understanding of the nature of religion. In particular it is claimed that any explanatory account must do justice to the variety of the world's faiths and be such that believer and non-believer can recognise its validity. Prozesky believes that the quest for ultimate well-being is a thread which runs through all humanity's religions, and therefore that this can be seen as the clue to what they offer to their devotees. On this basis religion can be seen as the product of humanity's endeavour to find 'ways to overcome the problems of vulnerability and pain in a mysterious, threatening, yet also sustaining cosmos' (p. i). Prozesky points out that all existing faiths were shaped by world-views formed before the rise of modern science and they developed in isolation from each other. Hence attempts to explain religion have normally been conducted from within one religious tradition and have lacked adequate information about, or empathy for other traditions. Academics have tended to play down the enormous role of'salvation experience' in popular religion, and believing scholars have been insufficiently rigorous at seeking expia</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 303 nations for their own faith, or of accounting for its rejection by others. Similarly atheistic attempts to explain away religion have notoriously failed to do justice to their subject. For example the marxist claim that faith is the delusory refuge of the oppressed is difficult to reconcile with the fact that religion flourishes 'in the world's richest and least down-trodden nation' (p. 6). Prozesky's aim is therefore to find an explanation of religion which believer and unbeliever can both recognize as valid, and which will do full justice to all that modern studies of religion have shown us about this important global phenomenon. Prozesky believes that awareness of the diversity of the world's religions compels the abandonment of any supernatural explanation for them. To suppose for example that religious consciousness is evoked by an encounter with a single benign deity raises the question of why the results of such an encounter are 'so varied and at times mutually inconsistent' (p. 193). And though polytheism might offer a partial solution to this problem, on other grounds 'the polytheistic case is difficult to take seriously' (p. 193). Moreover Prozesky is convinced that the concept of direct divine self-revelation is in any case a logical impossibility 'because the deity, being pure spirit, cannot be perceived in any way' (p. 194). Hence any explanation of religious consciousness must see it as having a 'natural, human basis' (p. 194). According to Prozesky religion is the result of humanity's perception of our place in nature. Human beings find themselves in a Cosmos they still hardly understand, and subject to powers of nature which form 'an encompassing field of interacting, conditioning, largely unseen forces, some helping and others injuring human existence' (p. 100). Yet it is a world in which 'things seem to fit together into an orderly living whole' (p. 101). It is not at all surprising therefore that during an earlier stage of human knowledge the workings of the forces of nature should have been attributed to spiritual agencies, or that 'the anthropomorphic projection' of the idea of a powerful and personal directive agency, or god, should have seemed a natural causal hypothesis to explain how things were (cf. pp. 154 ff). Then, once the world was thought of as directed by the personal agency of a God, or gods, how utterly reasonable that the human longing for well-being should have resulted in prayer and worship being offered to such powers in an attempt to win favourable treatment from them. And Prozesky shows just how much of the ritual of almost all religions is geared to the cajoling of special benefits from the deity addressed. The thesis is presented clearly and intelligently and on the basis of wide reading in world religion. Moreover the author makes every effort to come to terms with, and respond in advance to, the objections which he recognises will be levelled against his position. Hence it is a difficult book to criticise, but criticism must, I believe, be made. First, as is almost inevitable in any work which seeks to present an overall</page><page sequence="3">304 RELIGIOUS STUDIES perspective, I am worried that the differences between the world religions are insufficiently noted. For example although the Theravada tradition is briefly mentioned most of 'the evidence for Buddhism' is deduced from Mahayana, and in particular Pure-Land Buddhist sources, and it is ex? ceedingly hard to see how, despite the discussion on page 51 ff, Theravada Buddhism can possibly fit into Prozesky's thesis. Likewise I do not think the Qur'anic references cited on page 32 ff. sustain the interpretation given, and much of the Old Testament becomes unintelligible if there really was as little difference between early Judaism and the nature religion of the ancient Canaanites as Prozesky implies. But my central concern is that Prozesky wholly excludes the possibility of any direct relationship between God and humanity, even though this is at the heart of all theistic religion. As we have seen his grounds for this are the diversity of the world religions and the fact that God cannot be apprehended by the senses. Neither of these arguments will suffice. It is true that the human response to God has been extraordinarily diverse yet the fact that missionaries have found that no human language is without a word for ' God ' capable of bearing a Christian usage, suggests that the underlying unity between the worlds' theistic religions may be much greater than Prozesky suggests. And his further suggestion that only that which is apprehended by the senses can be considered to have reality, gratuitously treats as nothing the testimony of theistic mystics who insist that their overwhelming sense of God's reality was neither mediated nor assisted by the senses. Yet if their testimony is accepted we may well conclude, contra Prozesky, that theistic religion is indeed explicable as 'justified fidelity to the evocations of an objectively real transcendent world of the spirit, accurately perceived by the eye of faith ' .(P-93) Paul Badham</page></plain_text>
