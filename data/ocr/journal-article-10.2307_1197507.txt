<plain_text><page sequence="1">CRITICAL REVIEWS Man's Vision of God. By CHARLES HARTSHORNE. Chicago: Willett, Clark &amp; Co., I94I. xxi+360 pages. $3.00. Many contemporary philosophers practice the art of evading thought about God while not denying themselves the luxury of intense negative convictions. Charles Hartshorne is not of that ilk. His rugged originality and penetrating insights merit serious attention. Perhaps his often ob- scure and uneven style repels some readers; but the enigmatic Preface to Man's Vision of God should not deter anyone from reading the book, which is Hartshorne's most adequate work up to the present. Hartshorne is engaged, along with numerous other philosophers, in an attempt to revise the traditional idea of God which has prevailed in Jew- ish and Christian philosophy and theology from the time of Philo Judaeus, through Maimonides, Aquinas, and Spinoza down to contemporary Neo- Scholastics and many Protestants. "Theologians," he declares, "would be no more justified in denying offhand that they can have misled religious thought for centuries than doctors were in their indignant denial that it was they themselves who consistently infected mothers with puerperal fever." Progress is possible. Atheism has no better friend than the the- ologian who confines the reality of God within one particular definition. In undertaking his contribution to revisionism, Hartshorne aims to be rigidly logical. Since the idea of God is the idea of a perfect being, the logical possibilities may be grouped under three types. Type I: There is a being in all respects absolutely perfect (absolutism, Thomism, the Philo- nian type). Type II: There is a being in some respects absolutely perfect and in some not (a finite-infinite, perfect-perfectible God). Type III: There is a being in no respects absolutely perfect (a merely finite God). These might be called the Parmenidean, the Heraclitean, and the Epi- curean types, although Hartshorne does not name them thus. Hartshorne contends that traditional Type I theology has been able to maintain its hold largely because it succeeded in creating the impression that Type III (a manifestly inadequate view) was its only rival. Only since about I880 has Type II been brought to general attention, chiefly by Protestant philosophers and theologians. In his numerous arguments against Type I, Hartshorne seems to the present reviewer to be in the right at every important point. This doc- 96</page><page sequence="2">CRITICAL REVIEWS trine, he says, quoting Peirce, serves to "block the path of inquiry" into more qualified formulations. He points out that the traditional view con- tains many nonreligious tenets, such as God's nontemporality, his pure activity (denying him any personality), his creation of the world out of nothing, his absolute simplicity, even his lack of emotions and will (p. 95). The perfection of God, even for such liberal Neo-Scholastics as Gilson and Maritain, implies that "be we saint or sinner, no matter what we choose to do, it is all one to God, for his glory has the identical absolute perfection in either case" (pp. 117-18). Such a God is "incapable of re- sponding to our noblest need" (p. II8); he is too perfect. Hartshorne's treatment would have been strengthened had he gone back of Philo to Aristotle and Parmenides and had he considered the thought of A. C. Knudson, the ablest living Protestant exponent of Type I. Be that as it may, Hartshorne of Chicago has dealt the old view shrewd blows in one of its modern citadels. The book is worthy of commendation for its criticism of Type III, which rests on purely empirical arguments (as Type I rests on purely a priori grounds). However, it must be said that Hartshorne's treatment of religious naturalism is too cursory; that he does not sufficiently analyze the thought of a representative naturalist like H. N. Wieman (pp. 209- io); and that he does not consider critically the precise nature of empiri- cism. Historically, empiricism has meant Hume's analytic sensational- ism, James's doctrine that relations as well as terms are given, as well as Dewey's identification of experience with nature. Hume and James make experience mean less than the whole of any man's consciousness; Dewey makes it mean far more than any human consciousness could ever include. Should we not rather equate experience 'with actual conscious- ness and thus become "empiricists of consciousness" (like Hegel as Haer- ing sees him)? In the main, Hartshorne's case for Type II theology is well grounded. He defends anthropomorphism as inevitable (p. 88); holds that God is "individual and personal" (pp. 249-50); rejects creatio ex nihilo in favor of a temporalistic view of God (pp. 230, 255; Bergson, Whitehead); and interprets foreknowledge, according to "the principle of Gersonides," as meaning that "the true way to know the future is as undetermined" (p. 98); and favors a panentheism instead of pantheism (p. 347; cf. p. 208, n. 5, and pp. 289-90). There are at least four points at which questions arise: i. Is not Hartshorne too fully committed to the a priori? "The a priori method, not the empirical, .... is capable of adjudicating the claims of 97</page><page sequence="3">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION the two methods" (p. 64); this statement is true in a sense, false in a sense, and needs analysis. It is, however, less misleading than the con- stant assumption that arguments for a necessary being must "involve necessity" (p. 251) and that all metaphysical knowledge is a priori (p. 60). In harmony with this excess of rationalism is the omission of the teleologi- cal arguments (preferred by Gifford lecturers, as well as by Hume and Kant) in favor of the cosmological and ontological. But the rejection of Type I theology, the emphasis on "the religious strand" in theology (chap. iii), which is called "more than formal" (p. I37), and the clear statement that "we are always talking about experience if we talk sig- nificantly at all" (p. 79) betray an empirical conscience in revolt against apriorism. Perhaps the worst effect of a priori thinking in the book is the rejection of pacifism on grounds derived from the abstract nature of so- cial awareness (pp. i66-68), without concrete consideration of actual long-run consequences. 2. Does not Hartshorne's logical method suffer from a neglect of the criterion of coherence and of the principle of probability? This criticism is closely related to the first. Hartshorne thinks in terms of the logic of consistency and necessary implication, overlooking the fact that coher- ence, which is the mark of concrete, empirical truth, is far more than mere noncontradiction; and also overlooking the fact that all our knowl- edge of existential propositions is empirical and probable. Paul Weiss, it is true, has argued that it is a priori and metaphysically necessary that I shall not meet myself walking down the street; but he omitted to add that the proposition is empty unless we add "if there be myself," a prota- sis that can be established only empirically. Hartshorne's criticism of the present reviewer's conception of God is due to his failure to consider em- pirical coherence (p. 73). However, he dimly recognizes the probability underlying the claims of logical certainty when he says: "Faith in God means trust in the value of choice ..... The very 'ground of induc- tion' .... is some sort of faith" (p. 8i). But the principle of coherent faith is not made fundamental, as it should be in a critical philosophy of religion. 3. Is panpsychism necessary to Type II theology? Hartshorne is strongly convinced of the truth of panpsychism. He develops the view in one of his most original and stimulating chapters, the one on "Theologi- cal Analogies," in which, after criticizing the mind-idea relation, the arti- san analogy, and the social analogy, he finds the analogy of God as cosmic poet, cosmic father, and "monarch or world boss" (pp. 202-5) to be far less satisfactory than the analogy of God as cosmic mind, whose body is 98</page><page sequence="4">CRITICAL REVIEWS the universe. Here, at least, Hartshorne is plainly using the method of empirical coherence rather than his usual apriorism. However, he is on insecure ground when against all epistemological dualism he speaks of "the surely immediate mind-body relation" (p. 187). Although Harts- horne is right in holding that in some sense man controls his body more directly than anything else (p. 183), he fails to explain in detail why he infers panpsychism from this fact. Still worse, he fails to make his pan- psychism coherent. A "cell" of the body is "too light and weak a thing for its feelings to have any predominant influence" (p. I89). '" These crea- tures [the cells] are too limited in knowledge to cooperate to any concerted end such as might interfere with the human being" (p. I89). Here is the crux of panpysychism: How can cells be foolish and wise at once? How can they be so knowing as to co-operate in harmony with complicated psychico-chemical and biological laws, and yet not knowing enough to co-operate in a common revolt against the human mind of which they are the body? In fact, when disease and death come, their rebellion becomes a revolution. Then, are not the cells much wiser and more powerful than the original definition supposed? Does not this indicate that their real function is simply to be agents of cosmic law-that is, expressions of God's will? Why, then, nick Occam's razor with a dense population of superfluous subelectrons, when God suffices to do the work of matter? Panpsychism is a possible but hardly a probable view. Type II is better off without it. 4. Does Hartshorne meet the case against pantheism? Although re- jecting pantheism, he is too sympathetic with it. He notes that the argu- ment against pantheism is that an omniscient mind could not contain lesser minds as parts of itself without entertaining their partly erroneous beliefs (p. 289). He then goes on to a subtly meant refutation to the effect that this assures that "the only way to contain a belief is actively to be- lieve it. But perhaps one can passively suffer it." In thus arguing, Harts- horne omits the main point, which is that if one mind is part of another, then the former must be included as it is, with all its actively erroneous beliefs. If the active error is not God's, then something is not God and pantheism is refuted. These criticisms are not intended to detract from the importance of a weighty and suggestive book.
