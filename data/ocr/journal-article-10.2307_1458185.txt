<plain_text><page sequence="1">Research Abstracts HISTORY OF RELIGIONS (1955-1956) JOHN B. NOSS Franklin and Marshall College Since history of religions is receiving increasing attention in periodical literature, the following ab- istracts are more or less arbitrarily chosen on the basis of their probable usefulness to the teacher of undergraduate courses in this area of study. Some rather regrettable omissions have doubtless been made as a consequence. Whereas for awhile there was a paucity of infor- -mation concerning Chinese developments, both past and present, this lack has recently been made good, and I have therefore favored articles throwing light on the Chinese situation, now and earlier. It is with a sense of diffidence that I take over the task of preparing these abstracts from Prof. Charles S. Braden, who is here my model; and I hope that what is arduous but profitable for me will prove to be profitable but not too arduous for my possible readers. Like Prof. Braden I call attention to the admirable service performed in The Review of Re- ligion (Columbia University) in printing in each issue a classified bibliography of current articles covering the field. Intriguing articles in periodicals not found in smaller libraries can probably be had through inter-library loans, should either the fol- lowing abstracts or the listings in The Review of Religions excite curiosity. The Religions in General Allen, E. L. "The Christian Attitude toward the Non-Christian Religions." The Journal of Religious Thought, Vol. XII (Autumn-Winter 1954-55), 17- 25. How is one to look upon non-Christian religions ? Several answers are considered. Two such can be ruled out: the simple division of religions into true and false and the position that all religons are at bottom the same. ("I do not see how it is possible to think that the relation between Judaism and Tan- tric Buddhism is anything but an Either-Or.") We have to reckon with the fact of opposition among, and also within, the great religions. But there is also the fact of correspondence. Certain patterns of thought and devotion cross the boundary separating one religion from another. Witness the correspond- ence of so many in facing the problem of salvation by works versus salvation by faith or in reacting to the authority of tradition. Even so, the correspond- ence and the opposition cannot be separated. Here lies the possibility of "conversation" between the religions, where both opposition and correspondence are explored, in a "communion"' of the spirit that transcends difference. "The presupposition of such conversation is that we are one in spirit even though we come in conflict the moment we seek to define that which unites us." Teachers of courses in history of religions will find this a very suggestive discussion. Dewick, E. C., "Modernist Movements in the Non-Christian Religions." The Modern Churchman, Parts I and II, Vol. XLV (March and June, 1955), 31-43, 97-108. The author defines Modernism as "a movement which seeks to express the faith and practice of a religion in terms and forms more consistent with modern knowledge than those traditionally used, but without impairing the essential character of its original message." Using this criterion, he examines modernist movements in Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam and Judaism. He canvasses in Hinduism the Brahmo Samaj, the Arya Samaj, the Radhasoami sect, and two individual Hindu modernists, Aurobindo Ghose and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. He considers but does not accept as truly modernist the Ramakrishna Mis- sion, the Vedanta Movement, the Theosophical Move- ment, and Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. In recent Buddhism he finds "but little progress" in the endeavor to rethink the original message of either Hinayana or Mahayana Buddhism in relation to modern ideas. His conclusion concerning Islam is much the same; while many recent Muslims, like Muhammad Abduh, Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan, and Sayyid Amir Ali, whose views he summarizes, have realized the need for readjusting their faith to mod- ern ideas, very little real progress has been made. He admits that more genuine progress has been made in modernist Judaism. 216</page><page sequence="2">RESEARCH ABSTRACTS 217 "Non-Christian Religions in the Contemporary World" by Various Writers. Religion in Life, XXV, No. 4 (Autumn, 1956), 483-542. This is a symposium on certain non-Christian re- ligions and their challenge to Christianity. The fopics and authors are the following: "Islam" by Kenneth Cragg, "Hinduism" by David G. Moses, "Communist China" by Frank Wilson Price, "Ja- pan" by Antei Hiyane, and "Challenge and Chris- tian Answer" by Edmund D. Soper. Cragg deplores approaching Islam with Western security in view; we should try to understand what it means for the Muslim of our day, that is to say, an inclusive type of self-expression, with a sense of the past and a real sense of the future. Islam from within is then depicted in broad strokes. Moses points to the evi- dence of the inherent vitality of Hinduism and con- siders various aspects of its modern renaissance. Price treats of the fact that the old arbitrary divi- sion between Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism cannot be maintained; for they are equally rooted in Chinese history and environment, and are even more dependent upon milieu now that the environment has been revolutionized. Japan presents the world's re- ligions in miniature, says Hiyane. Edmund Soper reviews the religions of Asia from the standpoint of their challenge to Christianity and outlines the Christian answer: Christ has made known what God is like and reconciles God and man through the cross. Boslooper, Thomas. "Jesus' Virgin Birth and Non-Christian Parallels." Religion in Life, XXVI (Winter, 1956-57), 87-97. The oft-repeated statement that the Virgin Birth is of pagan origin and found its way into the story of Jesus is so erroneous that it would be difficult to find anything in all the literature of historical criti- cism more misleading. Actually the literature of the world contains no precise analogy or exact parallel to the biblical idea. The claims that Buddhism, the myth of Krishna, Assyrian and Babylonian tradi- tion, Zoroastrianism, Egyptian tradition, and Greco- Roman and Hellenistic legends are possible sources of the biblical story are separately dealt with and discounted. Martin Dibelius' theory that the many points of agreement between, for example, Buddha legends and the stories about Jesus arise not from borrowing or from the phenomenon of one serving as the "source" of the other, but because of the "law of biographical analogy" is favorably considered; but the Christian formula is unique all the same, it is argued. Ancient Religions Kramer, S. N. "Sumerian Theology and Ethics." Harvard Theological Review, XLIX (January, 1956), 45-62. The Sumerians believed that the "heaven-earth" (the vaulted heaven superimposed over the flat disk of earth with air between) was somehow engendered in a "primeval sea" and was controlled and guided by a pantheon of anthropomorphic deities organized into a super-state with a king at its head. Four gods did the actual creating out of the elements provided by the primeval sea: the heaven-god An, the air-god Enlil, the water-god Enki, and the earth-goddess Ninhursag. By mutual planning and assent (me) which kept these deities within the proper sphere, the creating deities uttered a creative divine word and whatever was thus commanded to be was so. An was the first king of the gods, but Enlil superseded him. Enki was the actual organizer of the earth as men know it. Sumerian ethics was fitted into this context. "All credit for the high moral qualities and ethical virtues which the Sumerians had no doubt evolved gradually and painfully over the centuries from their social and cultural experience was attrib- uted to the gods: it was the gods who planned it that way, and man was only following divine or- ders." Consequently, human suffering and adversity could be overcome only by glorifying the gods and weeping and lamenting before them until they deigned to turn suffering to joy. Ferguson, John. "More about Mithras." The Hibbert Journal, LIII (July, 1955), 319-326. The excavation of an unusually large and interest- ing temple of Mithras in the heart of London in- spired a series of articles in The Hibbert Journal, of which this is the second. (The first was sum- marized by Prof. Braden in JBR in July, 1955.) The author counters one aspect of the earlier article, which implied that Mithraism was a limited religion which never seriously rivalled Christianity, and does this by supplying the historical details which suggest that although it was originally a cult lim- ited to males and of obviously local origin, it had emerged as a world religion before it succumbed to Christianity. Indeed, before its demise it may to some extent have transmuted Christianity from within in both faith and morals. The cited evidence for this is acknowledged to allow no dogmatic cer- tainty. Toynbee, Jocilyn M. C. "Still More about Mith- ras." The Hibbert Journal, LIV (January, 1956), 107-114. The purpose of this article, besides offering cor- rections to both preceding articles, is to make ob-</page><page sequence="3">218 RESEARCH ABSTRACTS servations on the wide differences between the Christian creed and the teachings of pagan mysteries. The mysteries were mythological, dualistic, and polytheistic, and they were limited to a relatively small number of initiates; whereas Christianity is historical, monistic, uncompromisingly monotheistic, and open to all mankind. Christ offered a higher, more divine, and more glorious destiny than any practitioner of a mystery cult ever dreamed of. The Religions of India Heiman, Betty. "God and Man in India: Cosmos and Person." Hibbert Journal, LIII (April, 1955), 230-237. The three main general religious problems arising from the notion of personality are: Is God unique? Is God the highest personality? And, finally, is personality in all religions the sine qua non of high- est value? India's answers to these questions are in strict contrast to the axioms upheld in all Western religions. In Indian religions, (1) God is never unique; (2) no god-form is unchanging and perma- nent; (3) gods are only a class of beings side by side with other classes in the universe, though they may be of exalted rank; (4) man is not isolated from other beings on earth; (5) self-salvation is a necessary, gradual process; (6) the process of sal- vation ends, in nearly all Indian religions and philos- ophies, in the highest stage of de-individualization; and (7) persons are only instrumental factors in the operation of supra-personal laws and processes. McCullough, Jay R. "Indian Theism and the Im- portance of Moral Acts." The Review of Religion, XXI (November, 1956), 5-16. Although ethics, generally speaking, never served as an independent subject for speculation in India, practical morality is regarded as a means; it is a cleansing or prophylactic agent incident to and within the integrating process which dissolves the moral need in a higher synthesis. Morality is not to be divorced from karma and the world of change, and so sin has no permanence. It is a temporary stain. Sin destroys itself on contact with divine love. Neither sins nor virtues are to be cherished, for otherwise they may become idols in themselves. In the light of these propositions the Vedic and Upanishadic teaching is reviewed, and the ontological dichotomy of Western religion is then contrasted with it. This is a very searching essay. Dandekar, R. N., "Recent Researches Relating to the Veda." Prabuddha Bharata, LXI (February, 1956), 104-109. This is a useful summary and discussion of Vedic researches since 1946, in India and outside of it. Williams, George, "Harvard and Hinduism." Prabuddha Bharata, LXI (January, 1956), 56-59. Prof. Williams summarizes very briefly the "dis- course between East and West" which began in New England with interchanges between Henry Ware and Rama Mohun Roy in 1823 and is still continuing through a long succession of individuals since the first contacts. Swami Satswarupananda, "Does Vedanta Ac- cept Evolution?" Prabuddha Bharata, LX (through 1955), 278-283, 324-331, 434-440, 474-483. The answer given to this question is in the affirm- ative, but evolution is fitted into the total manifesta- tion of Maya. Maya includes evolution, and in the same process dissolution as well. Evolution and dis- solution are in a certain sense compulsive, but under the aspect of eternity they tend to cancel each other out. Gough, E. Kathleen, "Brahman Kinship in a Tamil Village." American Anthropologist, Vol. 56, no. 5 (October, 1956). This is a detailed study of a Brahman kinship system in an area of India where the social patterns remain relatively traditional. In the village under study, the Brahmans live in a single street in the center of the village, the street forming a separate social unit within the larger village; the non-Brah- mans live in adjoining streets and the low caste, Dravidians in streets beyond rice fields outside the village proper. The Brahmans are the landlords and religious specialists of the village, and are maintained by the work of lower caste tenants and laborers. Marriages take place within the caste between exogamous patrilineal groups of the same or different villages. The endogamous subcaste within which the marriages are arranged is com- posed of Brahmans of eighteen villages within a radius of thirty miles. How the Brahmans, male and female, live within the individual family and in the wider kinship system, and what changes are be- ginning to occur, is interestingly related in this study. Jain, Prithvi Raj, "The Fundamentals of Jain- ism." The Aryan Path, XXVI (January and Feb- ruary, 1955), 16-20, 70-75. The author finds in India two distinct and antag- onistic currents of culture, the Vedic or Brahmanic and the Shramanic. Of the latter Buddhism and Jainism are the surviving representatives. This point of view is essentially pessimistic in its out- look, metaphysically dualistic, animistic and humane</page><page sequence="4">RESEARCH ABSTRACTS 219 in its ethical tenets, temperamentally ascetic, and socially equalitarian. Jainism stresses the fact that truth and untruth exist side by side and that it has no non-human source. The author considers the characteristic terms of Jainism and defines them. Buddhism Mather, Richard, "The Conflict of Buddhism with Native Chinese Ideologies." The Review of Religion, XX (November, 1955), 25-37. The normal Chinese conviction of the essential unity of the "Three Religions" did not prevent a minority of discerning critics from detecting sharp conflicts between Buddhism and the native Chinese ideologies. These critics complained of the Buddhist repudiation of the actual world, its other-worldly ideal for monks and nuns, the "departure" from the realities of this world involved in the seeking of Nirvana, the economic loss to the country caused by deeding of arable lands to tax-free temples and by the investment of huge sums in bronze images and pagodas, and the political, cultural and moral effects of monasticism itself. Relevant documentation is provided. Gray, G. F. S., "Buddhism Today, and Its Appeal to Modern Man." Theology, LIX, No. 435 (Sep- tember, 1956), 354-360. The main contention of this article is that the appeal of Buddhism to the modern man in the West and in the East lies in its doctrinal teaching, which points to man alone as the creator of his present life and the sole designer of his destiny, a pure form of humanism attractive to those who feel that depend- ence on a personal god is sheer laziness. Moreover, Buddhism is gentle and tolerant where Christianity appears often to be harsh and bigoted. Another at- traction of Buddhism lies in its solution of the problem of suffering by invoking the Law of Karma and Reincarnation, and thus pointing to a cosmic principle of justice more satisfactory to many than the "immoral doctrine" of the forgiveness of sins. The Religions of China Chang, Carsun, "Wang Yang-ming's Philosophy." Philosophy East and West, V, No. 1 (April 1955), 3-18. Wang Yang-ming is considered by the author to be China's most powerful and influential thinker. His subjective idealism resembled the Western Berkeley's. According to Wang Yang-ming, mind is reason; knowing is the core of reality and reality is comprised of consciousness; willing and knowing are correlated; man is the mind or center of the universe; physical objects therefore have spiritual affinity with mind and would not function if there were no mind or intuitive knowledge; matter or the world of nature is the material with which mind functions. The universe is an integration or whole, with man at the center; and all men constitute a brotherhood. Schafer, Edward H., "The Development of Bath- ing Customs in Ancient and Medieval China and the History of the Floriate Clear Palace." Journal of American Oriental Society, Vol. 76, no. 2 (April- June, 1956). This paper is an attempt to remedy the lack of scholarly writing about the history of bathing in China, a lack which contrasts strikingly with the abundance of material available on bathing in Eur- ope, the Near East, and Japan. After a brief re- capitulation of the bathing history of Europe, Is- lamic lands, India, and Japan, the bathing customs of the Chou Dynasty are outlined and subsequent changes and innovations down to the Ming Dynasty described. Finally, a study of the oldest and most fully documented imperial bath, the Floriate Clear Palace, is added. The Chinese strictly separated the sexes during bathing, and bodily and moral purity were regarded as closely interdependent. Purification rituals often called for bathing in rivers. Bathing before religious ceremony was prescribed from the earliest days, and polite manners required washing of the body, and failing that of the hands, mouth, and particularly the hair, before visits or formalities of all kinds. Hair washing was re- garded as so important that almost no interruption was permitted while it was in progress. Too fre- quent bathing was regarded as sybaritic, but the indifference of the natives of Szechwan to cleanli- ness gave rise to the derogatory proverb: "The men of Shu bathe once at the time of birth, and once at the time of death." The connection between hot springs and health was early recognized. Marco Polo mentions public baths, "the finest and largest baths in the world; large enough for 100 persons to bathe together." The most famous in song and story was the imperial Floriate Clear Palace, built around warm mineral springs on the slope of Mt. Li near the capital city at Ch'ang-an. The baths are now the site of hostels. Chiang Kai Shek was held pris- oner by the Communists there. Creel, H. G., "What Is Taoism?" Journal of American Oriental Society, Vol. 76, no. 3 (July- September, 1956). "If anyone is apprehensive that I am going to give an answer to the question posed by the title of this</page><page sequence="5">220 RESEARCH ABSTRACTS paper, let me reassure him at once." Taoism can- not be comprehended in a single sovereign defini- tion; it is more than a school; it is a whole congeries of doctrines. Nevertheless, if one is to discuss Tao- ism, he must at least have a reasonably clear concep- tion of what it is. The word Tao is a fixed star in the firmament of Taoism. It remains difficult to define. The Confucians regarded it as only a principle; the Taoists considered it as both a method and a sub- stance, a thing; and Chuang Tzu held it to be the only substance, the only thing. To be in accord with it one must practice wu-wei (non-action) and be selfless. There is both a contemplative and a purposive Taoism. The former represents philos- ophy in its original purity, the latter cultivating the Tao as a means to power. This is seen in both Chuang Tzu and Lao Tzu. Religious Taoism or Neo-Taoism arose close to the beginning of the Christian era and concerned itself with the achieve- ment of immortality. The goal was to become a hsien, a Taoist immortal; whence this form of Tao- ism should be called Hsien Taoism. The problem of how Hsien Taoism emerged historically is con- sidered in some detail, the theory being advanced that at about 300 B.C. a cult of immortality arose that took over the name Taoism. The gulf that re- mained between "contemplative" Taoism and Hsien Taoism was never bridged, and this is a fact recog- nized in the Lieh Tzu. This gulf only widened when Hsien Taoism incorporated elements from Confu- cianism, Moism, and Buddhism. Levy, Howard S., "Yellow Turban Religion and Rebellion at the End of the Han." Journal of Amer- ican Oriental Society, Vol. 76, no. 4 (October-De- cember, 1956). The historical circumstances surrounding the re- bellion against the throne on the part of Neo-Taoists near the end of the Han Dynasty are thoroughly pre- sented and documented in this article. The Yellow Turbans were so called because they wore yellow kerchiefs on their heads to identify them. They were led in the east by three Chang brothers. They bore the same surname as Chang Liang, Taoist ad- viser to the founder of the Han Dynasty, and Chang Tao-ling, the famous founder of the healing and longevity cult in Szechwan province. Two rebel- lions of the Yellow Turbans took place, one in the east in 184 B.C., which followed a series of natural disasters and had great popular support but was soon put down, and the other in the southwest, led by Chang Lu, the grandson of Chang Tao-ling, which resulted in the successful forming of a state within the state that endured for some time. Nivison, David S., "Communist Ethics and Chi- nese Tradition." The Journal of Asian Studies, XVI, no. 1 (November, 1956). It is the thesis of this article that, despite the break the Chinese Communists have made with the Chinese past, they have not broken entirely with certain elements in the Confucian tradition. The Communists' response to their problems of the Jap- anese war period was a combination of united-front nationalism and of ideological molding stressing "self-cultivation." The latter is the point of con- tact with tradition, for self-cultivation-the closing of the gap between "theory" and its realization in subconscious attitude, character, conduct or "prac- tice"-was an exercise which formed the basis of Confucian and Buddhist ethics for two millennia. 6f' particular influence was the thought of Wang Yang- ming (16th century; see above) who taught that the gap between knowledge and action must be closed: to know is to know how and know that one ought. Sun Yat-Sen spoke in the same terms; and the Communists in the Thirties insisted, a la Ne0- Confucianism, that the Communist cultivate himself, the essence of this being to make his Marxism real through revolutionary work. How this old Con- fucian technique of self-cultivation ("watching one- self when alone") was spelled out in detail by' Liu Shao-ch'i and Mao Tse-tung is fully documented in this excellent article. Lifton, Robert J., "Thought Reform of Chinese Intellectuals: a Psychiatric Evaluation." The four- nal of Asian Studies, XVI, no. 1 (November, 1956):, This article follows immediately after and sup- plements the one just summarized. Lines of relation- ship with Chinese tradition are traced. Its subject has received much attention under the popular term, "brainwashing." The material was gathered ih Hong Kong from Feb. 1954 to June 1955. Thought reform takes place, as a rule, in a "revolutionary college," where the following conditions are set up: "great togetherness" (group identification), "criti- cism, self-criticism, and confession" (the period of emotional conflict), "rebirth" (submission). Analy- sis shows that the process exhibits these psychlogi- cal principles: milieu control; guilt, shame, and confession; group analysis and sanction; emotional appeals; shift in role behavior and in personal iden- tity. The central effort is expended upon the produc- tion by each individual, and group criticism, of an over-all thought summary or final confession, which becomes a permanent part of each person's record. The essential thesis of the process, that man can and should be re-educated, that he must follow the "cor- rect" ideological path, and that he is constantly to</page><page sequence="6">RESEARCH ABSTRACTS 221 further his "self-cultivation," is directly in the Con- fucian tradition. Traditional Chinese educational methods--constant repetition, the use of exact models, and something like the "eight-legged" essay of the traditional state examination--are used. There is a violation of the traditional Chinese cultural values, however; filial piety, for instance. The Religions of Japan Nielson, Niels C. Jr., "Religion and Philosophy in Contemporary Japan." The Rice Institute Pam- phlet XLIII, no. 4 (January, 1957). The entire issue is devoted to the topic. The fol- lowing generalizations are stated: "Japanese religion is characteristically naturalistic and pantheistic rather than theistic. Moreover, it is not oriented on history as much as Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The Japanese mind is eclectic and inclusive; questions of doctrine are often ignored or minimized. The explicit affirmative or negative of Western thought modes is not accepted. Intuition is stressed more than concept and interpretation. Expression is not alone by word and speech, but by gesture, movement, and repeated act. Basically, Japanese religion is very practical as compared with the speculative religious genius of India." In the light of these findings, a complete survey is offered of post-war Japan, Shinto, Buddhism, Christianity, newly emergent religions, and Japanese philosophi- cal developments. This thorough monograph is a summary of study and research undertaken in Japan during the summer of 1956. Islam Wolfson, H. A., "The Muslim Attributes and the Christian Trinity." Harvard Theological Review, XLIX, 1-18 (January, 1956). Early in the 8th century there arose in Islam the belief that certain attributes of God are real incor- poreal beings which exist in God from eternity. There is nothing in the Koran to warrant such a belief. Since such a belief is analogous to the Chris- tian doctrine of the Trinity, which Islam began by excoriating as error, it is of some interest to see how it arose. Its source may have been in Christian doctrine but it is more likely that there were logical grounds for it. The author embarks upon a detailed linguistic study of Christian, Neoplatonist, and Muslim writers, and concludes that "quite evidently there is some kind of relation between the Muslim belief in attributes and the Christian belief in the Trinity." Apparently the Son and the Holy Spirit were transformed into Muslim attributes. The rea- son this was done is contained in the logical situation arising from debate between Christians and Mus- lims, and the need of the latter to counter the doctrine that the Son and the Spirit are equal with the Father by asserting that the attributes for which the Son and the Spirit stand were to be taken as "things" existing in God from eternity and insepar- able from Him but not to be called God but, instead, attributes of God. Kedourie, Elie., "Islam and the Orientalist: Some Recent Discussions." The British Journal of Soci- ology, VII, no. 3 (September, 1956). This article reviews some recent discussions of the possibility of constructive social change in Islam on the part of G. E. von Grunebaum, D. B. Mac- Donald, D. G. Hogarth, L. Gardet, H. A. R. Gibb, and others. As von Grunebaum asserts, Islam is permeated by a sense of the autocracy of God; be- tween God and man an infinite gulf is fixed; and what God promulgates today He can abolish to- morrow. All depends on God's will. Muslim theology is therefore strictly voluntarist, and Muslim ethics rest on a nominalist foundation: the good is good not because it conforms to a law of nature or of reason, but because God decrees it to be good. This means that Muslim theology is occasionalist: there is only one cause, God, and there are no laws of reason or nature or even of causality that bind Him. How, then, shall the problem of government be solved? So far in Muslim history, the divine will has required autocracy in government to enforce it. No scope for constitutionalism or for democratic theories of representation has existed. No rights are inherent in man as such. Executive absolutism has had no real check except the Revelation. Could things have been otherwise.? H. A. R. Gibb thinks that the over-rapid conquests of the Arabs led to absolutism as an expedient, but the original Mus- lim principles of government might have been less tyrannical. Gardet suggests that the voluntarist, authoritarian character of Islam might in future allow the European solution of constitutional guar- antees. But the author of the paper doubts this.</page></plain_text>
