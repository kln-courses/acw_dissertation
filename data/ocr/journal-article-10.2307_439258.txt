Albany: State University of New York Press, 1996. Pp. xii+ 163. Ends of the Lyric: Direction and Consequence in Western Poetry. Timothy Bahti. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996. Pp. viii+288. Lyric poetry was particularly relevant to the concerns of poststructur- alism in the 1970s and early 1980s when Paul de Man's work put it firmly on the theoretical agenda. The waning of poststructuralism, or rather its absorption into all theoretical positions, has relegated the study of the lyric as a genre to the back burner. These books by two subtle and sophisticated scholars will be welcome and enlightening to those interested in the subject. Both are concerned with the lyric in a broad sense, the one focusing on the poet as melancholy allegorist, and the other on the peculiar kinds of "non-endings" characteristic of lyric reading. Unapologetically poststructuralist in approach and style, and almost completely unleavened by the new historicisms and cultural- isms, they have all the ingenuity one might expect without quite over- coming the impression that the returns from this line of criticism are diminishing. Anselm Haverkamp's book is a translation of his Laub Voll Trauer: H1lderlin's Spdte Allegorie (Munich, 1991), with an appended essay on Keats that was written in English. After a preface to the American edi- tion and two introductory chapters, there are five chapters, each of which interweaves a reading of a single poem (one by Albrecht von Haller, three by H61derlin, and one by Keats) with readings in a par- ticular philosopher (Kant, Hegel, Heidegger, Kant, again, and Locke, respectively). This is a very difficult book, more dazzling than commu- nicative, and it seems to aim at a readership of the like-minded. Com- plex and sometimes enigmatic theoretical texts by Benjamin, Derrida, de Man, Maria Torok, and others are alluded to and argued with but seldom adequately expounded, and familiarity with H61derlin's ex- tremely difficult late poetry and its scholarship is assumed. (The un- initiated will find some of the necessary background quite lucidly presented in Timothy Bahti's chapter on H61derlin.) Vernon Chad- wick's translation is no less clear than the sections written in English but contains quite a few awkward Germanisms. Haverkamp's theoretical starting point is Benjamin's identifica- tion of allegory and melancholy as peculiarly modern conditions, each the correlative of the other. As Benjamin argued in his book on Ger-</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 261 man Trauerspiel (Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels [Frankfurt, 1972]), the classical aspiration to a symbolic coherence between particular and universal is abandoned in these baroque tragedies in favor of alle- gory. The melancholic eye there transforms the natural world into a charnel house of dead objects, allegories of the decay of a world which has as its concomitant the truth and transcendence of an other world. For Haverkamp, such transcendence is refused by the modern melan- cholic, as is the mourning that would allow the poet to detach himself from the remnants of a lost order. He opposes to Freud's ameliorative "work of mourning" a "melancholy lingering" and "deepening" char- acteristic of the modern lyric consciousness, in which the lingering relics of a failed allegoresis are simply incorporated rather than be- ing introjected as representations that become part of the self: "What for the baroque melancholiac was left behind outside, dead, is now left behind inside-'living dead' " (pp. 17-18). This produces a de- centered self and what Derrida describes in Psyche: inventions de l'dutre (Paris, 1987) as a "kryptic subjectivity," in which the walls of the 'krypt' where incorporation has its end do not separate an inner from an outer forum but rather make of the inner forum "an outside excluded in the interior of the inside" (p. 16), or "an outside excluded from the interior of the inside" (p. 17; whether this is an error or a new point is unclear). These theoretical concerns are then explored through a consider- ation of the late career of H61derlin. The polemical implications of the use of the word 'beyond' in Haverkamp's various reversals of the "anthropomorphic" hierarchies (e.g., "incorporation beyond introjec- tion" and "the krypt beyond archaeology"), are fed into a revaluation of the trajectory of H61derlin's career. In particular, the so-called with- drawal after the difficult, paratactic late hymns to the apparently sim- plistic rhymed quatrains of the mad H61derlin is interpreted as a heroic achievement to be understood in poetological terms rather than as a retreat into madness. Neither a story of failure and retreat nor a func- tion of H61derlin's madness, this trajectory is rather an emptying out of allegory so that what remains can be the basis for "a poetic of read- ing beyond the allegories of meaning," a new kind of realism (p. xi). Thus Hl1derlin evades "the ghost dance of abandoned shadows" and the "agony of melancholy rage" (p. x) that feature in Keats's "Ode on Melancholy." A chapter on Haller links the world of Benjamin's baroque tragedy and H61derlin; Haverkamp thus replaces Klopstock with the poet whom Kant called the most sublime of German poets as H61derlin's predecessor. Haller's "Unfinished Ode on Eternity," in which the poet mourns a friend amid a gloomy, nonresponsive nature, bespeaks the</page><page sequence="3">262 MODERN PHILOLOGY extinction of the Vergilian pastoral tradition. Nature is no longer a place in which experience (of loss) takes place, and the loss of Na- ture's representational adequacy becomes a cipher for the poet's bereavement. The next three chapters all deal with poems that feature trees and thus carry on the mournful dialogue with an extinguished Vergilian pastoral. The first of these chapters deals with H61derlin's memory of epic myth in the poem Mnemosyne. Of the paratactic, epicizing style of this poem Haverkamp remarks, "The allegorical coherence of Mnemo- syne consists in nothing more than this metonymic accumulation of its parts that does not represent the myth itself so much as its loss in the process of futile appropriation. This poem is itself only insofar as it presents others as itself" (p. 48). The poem therefore has the struc- ture of a "krypt" "through which (not in which) a loss is preserved and concealed" (p. 54). The following chapter focuses on H61derlin's "Andenken," a poem of private rather than epic memory. The last line of this poem, "Was bleibet aber, stiften die Dichter" [What endures is endowed by the poets] was the occasion for the most portentous of Heidegger's claims for poetry. Haverkamp debunks Heidegger by interpreting the line to mean that the poet's melancholy reflection on what remains (bleibet)-- namely, the empty signifiers of an abandoned allegory--provides a foundation (stiftet) for a "poetics of reading beyond the allegories of meaning, a poetics of the mourning invested in the material traces of tropes" (p. xii). Stiftet is taken, etymologically, to refer to the "stiffen- ing" of the sign. Haverkamp relates the figtree remembered by H61- derlin in this poem to the distinction, elaborated by John Freccero ("The Figtree and the Laurel: Petrarch's Poetics," Diacritics 5 [1975]: 34- 40), between Augustinian fig tree (logos) and Petrarchan laurel (rhetoric) and then deconstructs that distinction to deny the possibil- ity of a remembered plenitude. In the final H61derlin chapter, Haverkamp conjures out of the ex- traordinarily beautiful rhymed poem "Der Kirchof" a return to the world via a dialectic between emptiness and fullness. Emptying signs of reference makes possible a new kind of plenitude: "Marked by a renunciation and abandonment hard to imagine, H61derlin expects from the happy life something beyond the understanding of those who psychoanalyze his withdrawal: in the spare frames of empty images, the fullness of things called forth from nothing" (p. 100). This "noth- ing" is the end of the H61derlin book, but there is a coda in which Keats's "Ode on Melancholy" is read through Shakespeare's Sonnet 31 to show how Keats's ode is ironic in its thematization of melancholy and its observation of the melancholy self. Keats identifies melan- choly as the necessary implication and consequence of the narcissism</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 263 of Shakespeare's sonnet. While for Shakespeare, "the loss is overcome and 'reigned' by poetry, for Keats this mourning remains untrue and consequently rejoices in melancholy" (pp. 114-15). This synopsis does no justice to the dizzying convolutions of the argument or to its many byways. By turns heady and by turns infuri- ating, Haverkamp's book contains a richly suggestive meditation on the modern lyric consciousness. But, as Bahti aptly comments on Haver- kamp's discussion of "Andenken," it frequently verges on a deconstruc- tive self-parody in which, as Bahti puts it, "every accomplishment [is] a failure, every possibility an impossibility" (p. 132). Haverkamp's ar- gument calls out for some discussion of the claims made by the spatial metaphor in the ubiquitous word 'beyond', as well as of the ethics implied by liberal use of the word 'heroic' (or 'Herculean') and by the insistence that H61derlin's final poems represent a renunciation rather than a withdrawal. Without such a discussion, the reader feels manipu- lated by what can seem like intellectual machismo. The focus of Bahti's book is on the "ends" of the lyric, both the end- ings and the goals of lyric poems. Although he treats a wide range of European poets in chronological order, his book is not in any sense a history of the lyric. It consists in close readings in eight chapters, of lyrics by Shakespeare, Leopardi, Coleridge, Keats, H61derlin, Baude- laire, Stevens, and Celan. Reversing Barbara Herrnstein Smith's project in Poetic Closure: A Study of How Poems End (Chicago, 1968), Bahti ex- plores "non-closure" in the European lyric, a phenomenon he explores under three headings--"direction, trope and reflection" (p. 9)-each of which is understood in at least two senses. Where Haverkamp em- phasizes the beyondness of the lyric, Bahti stresses its turning back; instead of deepening, Bahti is concerned with reflection. Like Haver- kamp, though, Bahti is concerned with reading (which is one of the "directions" the lyric gives us), and particularly with the ways in which poems reflect, and reflect on, their own reading. His master trope is chiasmus and he finds it on all levels of the lyric, from the chiastic arrangement of words (abba) to the inversion that takes our readings from the beginning to the end of the poem and then back to the beginning again. In the opening chapter, on Shakespeare's sonnets, Bahti describes how poems directed toward their ends may feature an interesting play between sequence (one thing after another) and comprehension (a thought or sentence moving toward completion), between the un- folding of a narrative and the understanding of an utterance. In the first of several readings of poems that produce figures of reading, Bahti considers Sonnet 43, in which the paradox "When most I wink, then do my eyes best see" is not so much explicated as used to make the reader see reading as a form of seeing that is also a not-seeing.</page><page sequence="5">264 MODERN PHILOLOGY The ambiguities of grammar and semantics in this poem bring out the character of reading as paradoxical seeing. From Shakespeare we leap ahead to Leopardi's "L'Infinito," whose shifting deictics undermine any stable position for the speaking 'I', and whose beginning presupposes its end just as its end directs one back to its beginning again. (One of the directions that poems give us, of course, is to read them again.) In the chapter on Coleridge's fragmentary "Kubla Khan," Bahti discusses how the poem continually conjures up figures of the reader's (or writer-as-reader's) own desire for completion, and how, instead of being a fragment of a whole, the poem constitutes itself as a chain of anticipations and reflections that could not even in theory culminate in a totality. The Keats chapter, focusing on the two Hyperion poems, is a fascinating discussion of Keats's effort to "write what it means to read one's own text" (p. 82). The image of "might half-slumbering on its right arm," according to Bahti, "suggests a poetic poise and posture.. . between reading and being read .... The power of poetry... [is] an image of activity, and yet inviting or giving way to another activity wherein the first one would become an object of a lingering gaze" (p. 81). Keats imagines his poems as passive, stilled objects still directing the activity that passes over them. A subtle reading of Keats's characteristic use of the word 'still,' in which the meaning 'not yet' becomes 'no longer' or vice versa, is convincingly related to his imaging of the poem and its reading. The chapter on H61derlin deals mainly with his "Wie wenn am Feiertage" (a poem that, together with the influential studies by Heidegger and Peter Szondi discussed by Bahti, provides a useful in- troduction to some of the issues of Haverkamp's book), and more generally with H61derlin's images and their role in mediation. Bahti gives us an enlightening discussion of the trajectory from the decom- position of mediating images in "Feiertage" to the self-abnegating representational images in "Hilfte des Lebens" and a superb read- ing of the ending of that poem with its clattering of weather vanes (Im Winde / Klirren die Fahnen). This is followed by a disappointingly mechanical reading of "Andenken," which concludes that "only at the end can the poem begin its full remembrance, as the remembrance of the remembrance, the remembrance (Andenken) of 'Andenken', the beginning of its and any remaining (Bleiben)" (p. 141). In Bahti's hands, Baudelaire's "A une Passante" becomes, quite con- vincingly, a parable of reading: just as the persona looks at the anony- mous woman in the crowd, who then turns her gaze on him before promptly disappearing, so the reader who has reached the end of the poem becomes its addressee. The concerns of the Shakespeare chap- ter with the relation between seeing and reading are recapitulated: "Passing to reading and reading to the end of the poem, we see our-</page><page sequence="6">Book Reviews 265 selves reading the sight of the disappearance of our eyes and the knowledge.., .they had been given, and had taken from them, in passing to the site of reading" (p. 163). Three poems by Stevens (including "The Snow Man") also become allegories of reading: "For on the far side of the attempted representa- tion of a world of scenery and weather and air without 'us' is the ac- tual presentation-present, 'now'-of reading" (p. 177). In a reversal of the direction of reading from the material of language to its sense, the reader is drawn to linger on the words themselves, so that the end of the poem becomes its last word. The final chapter discusses Celan's frequent images of flight and direction, which, as Celan's own theoret- ical writings confirm, carry the thematics of writing and reading. Bahti argues that Celan's boomerang-like poetic projectiles have as their aim a "double miss," neither quite reaching their goals nor quite re- turning: "But precisely in the writing of such poetry of a double trajec- tory, and in the traces and whizzings that guide its reading, the wider arc of Celan's poetology inscribes its mark" (p. 201). In an afterword, Bahti situates the lyric between the limits represented by the archaic poet Pindar and by Dante in the Commedia, between pure circularity and pure linearity. This is an intelligent and enlightening book which spins its charac- terization of the lyric out of close readings that are, for the most part, convincing and imaginative. If anything, it is a little undertheorized: both the connection between the various forms of "non-ending" and their specific relation to the lyric remain a little elusive, though the readings build effectively on each other. Both of these books have interesting things to say about the mys- terious activity that is reading, and both are capable of making you see a poem afresh-this is particularly true of Bahti, but Haverkamp is splendid on "Der Kirchof." Too often, though, the authors subju- gate the thematics of the poems to a rather threadbare deconstruc- tive moral: they are a little too quick to find poetry moving toward an epiphany of the words themselves (Bahti), or the "material traces of tropes" (Haverkamp). The familiar, often dizzying, deconstructive style of argument, with its tendency to give another turn to the screw ("not the a of b, but the a of the a of b," and so on), is still capable of producing challenging insights; not infrequently, though, it becomes a mannerism that calls to mind the guitarist in the fictional rock group Spinal Tap, who calibrated the volume control on his amplifier to 11, instead of the usual 10, in order to give himself that crucial edge.
