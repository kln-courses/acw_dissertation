<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROBERT SMITHSON UNEARTHED: DRAWINGS, COLLAGES, WRIT- INGS, by Eugenie Tsai. New York: Columbia University Press, 1991, 200 pp., $45. The double meaning of this book's title, and its premise as stated in Johanna Drucker's introduction, is that the "unearthing" of little-known works by Smithson reveals him as an artist of greater scope than the "earthworks" for which he is known and frees him from the niche "selectively carved" by "modernist critics." It may be a case of an irresistibly clever title's teasing its author into overstatement. Even so, the four-part book delivers at other points. Although Smithson himself inveighed against The Self in art, we are indeed given what David Rosand in the foreword calls "a richer range of personal affect" than we find in other accounts. Beginning with 1953, Eugenie Tsai's 36-page essay (part 1), "Early Smithson," fleshes out the artist's first interests and connects themes and disparate elements in his life and art up to his death in a plane crash in 1973 when he was thirty-five years old. A portion of it are her unconvincing arguments for including Smithson's writings and travels as "works" of substance with those he indicated on a 1970 "map" of his career; on the whole, however, the essay is densely informative, versatile, and un- usually thorough. Part 2, "Anthology of Unpublished Writings," is a smat- tering of poems, plans, notes, and turgid articles, cranky in the artistic, par- ticularly Smithson manner and in places-to use a term favored by him-sophomoric. Nevertheless, it appreciably adds to The Writings of Rob- ert Smithson (edited in 1979 for New York University Press by Nancy Holt, who was married to him), which is a more complete record of his aesthetic and "anti-aesthetic" projects and conceptions. Skipping part 3 for a mo- ment, part 4 consists of eighty-seven illustrations, most of which take full advantage of the book's 11 x 8 inch format. Together with the fifteen figures accompanying Tsai's essay and eight color plates (all from the pre- earthwork early 1960s), these reproductions are one of the book's major val- ues for students of Smithson. Part 3, "Well, in nature you can fall off cliffs," although the shortest, may be "a center point on the edge"-a key Smithson locution. That is, although last in the order of text, rambling and useless until now, by turns obtuse and sensitive, naive and urbane, these four recorded conversations between Dennis Wheeler and Smithson in 1969 and 1970 offer the careful reader the essence of Smithson and much of the "art scene" of his time. They present directly the kind (and spoken form) of artistic concerns that are routinely deformed-if not passed over altogether-by too many commentators. Even though edited "in a strongly condensed form," they are a valuable document.</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 119 One reason the talks had not been published may be the contradictions they offer to received notions about Smithson's centrality in Conceptual Art ("Just very sort of superficial sophomoric philosophy") and other develop- ments that were shortly to ascend beyond question. He challenged the many impositions of galleries and museums and is the presumed guru of outdoor art, but he did not think one was "freer artistically in the desert than... in- side a room.... You're probably always going to come back to the interior in some manner." Concerned with expanding limits, not (impossibly) doing away with them, as is commonly presumed, he said, "I don't think you can escape the primacy of the rectangle." Through every page weave unman- ageable nuances of the kind inimical to the programs of ideologues. "Lan- guage is as primary as steel," he said, but "The literary person is not dealing with languages and material, he's dealing with it as a kind of means to an end rather than an end in itself" (italics added). Smithson was featured in Lucy Lippard's Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object (1973), but his unwavering stress on the physical was not. Smithson rejected, among other aspects, the "anthropomorphism" of Abstract Expressionism, but the man who can say, "Planning and chance almost seem to be the same thing" has not completely lost touch with its wellsprings. Wheeler, young and admiring art historian and filmmaker, and Smithson, Creative Polymath on the Cutting Edge, converse in sober earnest. How- ever, from our place twenty-two years down the line, especially those of us who are of Smithson's generation, we hear humor's constant trickle in their exorbitant grappling with Art, The World, and the "crystalline buildup" of the Emerald City of Oz. We are moved by the restless excitement and dis- appointments, the idealism, gullible and otherwise. Their talk calls up that time when most of our art world's mindgames and dialectics were first en- dorsed, a time when the seductions of film and technology were finally or- dained and arbitrary documentation was "in"; when neologisms embold- ened critics, and artists, impressed but semiliterate (not Smithson), began to use words like "volumatic" and "emphatization"; when the culture began to go into solution and all distinctions, especially "banal," became problem- atic; when Pop, parody, and prefixes (anti-, non-, and de-) joined forces while theatricality groomed itself for the capital T we would give it. Head- ing off everybody at the conceptual pass, artist Yves Klein signed the world. Nothing and everything was fraught with ultimate significance. "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times." Fortunately, the simplistic overstatement of the book's first impact fades. Softened by Tsai's more balanced treatment (for example, Drucker posits originality as one of the "delimiting conceptions of modernism," while Tsai quotes a critic's recent pronouncement that Smithson's was "one of the most original minds of this century"), it is then gradually overcome by the unre- strainable complexities and appetites of a writer-artist. Smithson emerges in the same artistic region in which we have grown used to encountering him, Master of the Spiral Jetty, but richer for having been restored to the clutter and variety that supports the major work of every artist. It was not modern- ism that stripped and oversimplified him; the same signatural consistency</page><page sequence="3">120 Book Reviews that appears to continue among well-known postmodern artists is not due to a new, more genuine concentration or purer, unburied purpose. The forces then and now that cause such apparent homology, the impatient pri- orities that cut across (or supplant) the artist's process, are broader and deeper than "isms." Robert Smithson Unearthed gives us a glimpse of such artistic processes working below, over, around, and (sometimes) through those forces. One of the book's gifts is a renewed sense of what was lost when, "in nature," flying in a technological bird to view and photograph a "primoridal" earthwork, Amarillo Ramp, he "fell off a cliff."
