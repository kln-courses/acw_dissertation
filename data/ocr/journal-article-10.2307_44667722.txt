Anderson University of Michigan Program for Injury Research and Education Skip Barnes and Stephen A. Ridella TRW Automotive Stewart C. Wang University of Michigan Program for Injury Research and Education Copyright Â© 2006 SAE International ABSTRACT The intent of this study was to compare the neck responses measured from the Hybrid III 3 and 6-year-old ATDs in laboratory testing to injuries sustained by three children in a field crash and investigate the appropriateness of recommended in-position neck injury assessment reference values (lARVs), and the regulated out-of-position (OOP) lARVs specified in FMVSS 208 for the Hybrid III 3 and 6-year-old ATDs. This paper principally reports on apparent artifacts associated with the Hybrid III 3 and 6-year-old ATDs, which complicated investigating the appropriateness of the in-position and out-of-position neck lARVs. In tests using 3-point belt restraints, these apparent artifacts included: 1) High neck extension moments, which produced the peak Nij values, without significant observed relative head-to-neck motion, 2) Neck tension forces well in excess of the lARVs that occurred when the ATD's chin contacted the chest. Because humanlike kinematics and force deflection properties for belt restrained chin-to-chest contact have not been defined, and ATD force deflection criteria are not specified for chin-to-chest contact; the biofidelity of the neck data measured by the ATD during chin-to-chest contact is doubtful. This paper also compares the measured neck injury criteria with 3 and 6- year-old Hybrid III ATDs to the neck injuries sustained by the three children in a previously reported frontal crash. To the extent the test environment simulated the field crash, the out-of-position neck tension lARVs seemed consistent with the injuries sustained by the 3 and 6- year-old children who were in 3-point restraints, but had placed the shoulder belts behind their backs. Excluding neck tension measurements during chin-to-chest contact, the neck tensions measured in the lap/shoulder belted sled tests seemed consistent with the injuries sustained by the lap/shoulder belted 7-year-old child in the field crash. While the Hybrid III 3 and 6-year-old ATDs are the best available tools for assessing child neck injury potential, judgment is needed in interpreting the neck data from tests with belt restraint systems. It is inappropriate to only consider the peak neck measurements without examining the events surrounding those peak values. INTRODUCTION Neck responses in excess of the accepted injury assessment reference values have been measured from child anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) during various sled testing of child restraints and 3-point belts [11, 29]. However, child neck injuries are seldom observed in the field under similar restraint conditions. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 208 (Occupant Crash Protection) [5] and FMVSS 213 (Child Restraint Systems) [6] are intended, among other things, to help minimize the risk of injury to children in MVCs. While FMVSS 208 contains child neck injury criteria, it does not address in-position belt restrained children. While FMVSS 213 addresses dynamic, in-position child restraints, it does not regulate neck tolerance measurements. The current FMVSS 208 standard utilizes a series of child-sized anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs). The neck structures in the Hybrid III 3-year-old and 6-year-old ATDs are designed to human response corridors that were scaled from 50th% adult male neck response corridors [9, 12]. FMVSS 208 specifies these ATDs to measure the injury potential to an out-of-position child that may be in extreme close proximity to a deploying passenger airbag. For child out-of-position occupant evaluations, FMVSS 208 specifies a set of injury assessment reference values for the Hybrid III 3 and 6- year-old ATDs that must not be exceeded if a vehicle 183</page><page sequence="2">manufacturer is attempting to comply an air bag system with the low risk deployment option of FMVSS 208. Mertz et al. [14] conducted a test program to understand the types of injuries that may be induced when a child is in close proximity to an inflating passenger air bag. The primary objective of this testing program was to understand the potential for injury to the head, neck and chest. Animal surrogates were utilized to determine the threshold of injury. The surrogates were exposed to deploying airbags and were evaluated for resulting injury. The most frequently observed neck injury was hemorrhage within the atlas occipital joint capsules and /or hemorrhage dorsal of the membrane covering the midsaggital-ventral aspect of the A-0 junction. Such hemorrhage was described as a good indicator of the onset of damage to the apical odontoid ligament. This is in agreement with the neurosurgical medical literature [32] which states that involvement of the tectorial membrane was the critical threshold in the transition from a stable to an unstable neck injury. See Figure 1 . Figure 1 : Occipital atlas interface These same types of out-of-position tests were repeated with a 3-year-old sized ATD that was developed for airbag inflation induced injury assessment and utilized an upper neck load cell located in the area of the occipital condyles [34], Neck injury thresholds and risk curves were then developed through research conducted by Mertz and Weber [13], Mertz et al. [15], Mertz and Prasad [16], and Mertz et al. [17], Most recently, injury assessment reference values have been established for application to both in-position and out-of-position testing of ATDs [17], The injury assessment reference values developed from this research were used as the basis for the neck injury values specified for the Hybrid III child ATDs in the FMVSS 208 out-of-position (OOP), air bag test requirements [2], FMVSS 213, which regulates the performance and testing of child restraint systems, previously utilized only the Hybrid II ATD, which is not capable of recording neck loads. In addition to the Hybrid II, the Hybrid III ATD, which has the capability of measuring upper neck loads, is allowed to be used for FMVSS 213 compliance [6]. FMVSS 213 calls for the Hybrid III to replace the Hybrid II ATD in the future. While FMVSS 208 specifies static tests with the Hybrid III child ATDs positioned very close to a deploying passenger air bag, FMVSS 213 is the only Federal regulation that addresses dynamic, in-position child restraints. The FMVSS 208, Final Rule dated May 12, 2000 [19], specifies Nij neck injury criterion that account for combined loading conditions of neck flexion, extension, tension, and compression and their cumulative effects on injury risk. The final rule explains that neck tension and compression limits were added based on concerns expressed by the Alliance of Automobile Manufactures, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, and the National T ransportation Safety Board that the peak neck tension and compression allowed by Nij when the moment was zero were too great. Several automobile manufacturers had concerns that the current Hybrid III ATD neck was inadequate to accurately assess flexion/extension injuries and would affect calculated Nij responses. They recommended delaying the extension related criteria and using neck tension as the only neck injury criteria. The FMVSS 208 Final Rule further explains that the NHTSA and commenters observed high measured neck moments at the upper neck load cell within the first 20 ms, with initiation of large neck shear loads, without observing substantial angular deformation of the neck. The question was raised concerning whether these moments measured without substantial angular deformation of the neck were biomechanically realistic. However, because of the need to minimize the likelihood of neck injury and the lack of testing alternatives, the FMVSS 208 Final Rule specified the existing Hybrid III neck. Kang et al. [10] found that moments at the occipital condyles of the Hybrid III 5th percentile dummy, in certain modes of air bag neck interaction, go out of the Mertz and Patrick human response corridors [12], with very little head rotation relative to the torso. Agaram et al. [1] discussed the occurrence of large moments at the occipital condyles with small angular deformation of the neck and that such responses are unlikely in humans because of greater laxity of the human atlanto occipital joint. They concluded that high extension/flexion moments were produced with little neck angular deformation when the Hybrid III 5th percentile neck was subjected to second mode bending. The Hybrid III neck was developed to respond in a manner representative of humans only in first mode beam bending. Similar neck structures, utilizing a pivoting OC joint and nodding blocks are used in both the Hybrid III 5th percentile and Hybrid III 6-year-old ATDs, so neck responses were expected to be similar. In addition, researchers have made observations regarding the biofidelity of the head kinematics as a result of the rigid thoracic spine in the 184</page><page sequence="3">Hybrid III child ATDs and the resulting head, neck and chest responses in a dynamic environment [29, 11, 33, 3]. As the government and industry continue to develop solutions to enhance protection for children in an automotive crash environment, the responses of the Hybrid III family of child ATDs and the injury assessment reference values will come under increasing scrutiny. Based on several studies, NHTSA and other organizations have for several years emphasized the importance of proper child restraint usage. As government and industry strive to protect children, ATD measured responses need to appropriately predict child injury potential in a dynamic test environment. Assessing the appropriateness of the existing injury criteria or developing new ones is a difficult task as there is little child impact data from the biomechanical laboratories. This has led public health officials and bioengineers to utilize the sources of limited data, which are available to them. Because of these limitations, real world crash data and detailed injury reconstructions could be an important source of information in deciding the acceptance or rejection of proposed injury assessment reference values [23, 31 , 32], In a previous paper by Sochor et al. [30], a crash involving three seat belt restrained children was investigated as part of the University of Michigan CIREN (Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network) project. See Figure 2. Figure 2: Case Vehicle. The ages of the children involved in the crash were 3, 6 and 7 years old. This real world crash was studied because the children all suffered threshold-type (tectorial membrane hemorrhage and occipital condyle hemorrhage) neck injuries. The children were similar in height and weight to the Hybrid III 3-year-old ATD (ht = 945mm, wt = 16.2kg) and the Hybrid III 6-year-old ATD (ht = 1 168, wt = 23.4kg). The three children sustained the following injuries: Left Rear Seated, Lap Belted Only, 3-year-old (ht=1 000mm wt=15kg) ISS = 17 â  synovial capsule with tectorial membrane hemorrhage (AIS = 2 (650208.2) )(See Figure 3A and B) â  small bowel perforation (AIS = 3 (541424.3)) â  bilateral iliac wing fractures (AIS = 2 (852602.2)) â  Abdominal contusions (AIS = 1) Right Rear Seated, Lap Belted Only, 6-year-old (ht=1 220mm wt=23kg) ISS = 26 â  tectorial membrane hemorrhage with occipital condyle ligamentous injury (AIS = 2 (650208.2) ) â  Right frontal bone depressed skull fracture with underlying subarachnoid hemorrhage (AIS = 3 (150404.3)) â  small bowel devascularization x 2 (AIS = 4 (541426.4) ) â  colon perforation (AIS = 3 (540824.3 ) â  L2-3 spinous process avulsion fractures (AIS = 2 (650618.2)) â  L4 vetebral body fracture (AIS = 2 (650632.2) ) â  Abdominal contusion ( AIS = 1 ) Right Front Seated, Lap/shoulder Belted, 7-year-old (ht=1 240mm wt=35kg) ISS = 21 â  6th cranial nerve palsy (AIS = 2 (650208.2)) (The attending neurosurgeon opined that this injury resulted from stretching of the nerve by distracting the occiput from C1). â  Bilateral Pulmonary Contusions (AIS = 4 (441410.4)) â  Left #2-6 rib fractures (AIS = 3 (450230.3)) - Lower Abdominal Contusions (AIS = 1) Figure 3A: MRI of tectorial membrane hemorrhage in 3- year-old victim. 185</page><page sequence="4">Figure 3B: Synovial Capsule Hemorrhage 3 year-old In this crash, the case vehicle experienced a 12 o'clock, fully distributed, frontal impact when it T-boned a passenger car. An accident reconstruction was conducted, and WINDSMASH estimated the change in longitudinal velocity (delta V) of the case vehicle to be 45 kph (28mph). The 3 and 6-year-old children were both restrained in the rear outboard seating locations. Even though these seating locations contained a lap/shoulder belt system, both children were reportedly wearing the shoulder belt behind their back at the time of the crash. Therefore, for the purposes of this analysis, these two children were considered to be restrained by a lap belt only at the time of the crash. The 7-year-old child was seated in the right front passenger seat, and was restrained by the three-point vehicle lap/shoulder belt. Despite the differences in the children's sizes, restraint configurations, and seating locations, each child suffered a threshold A-0 injury similar to those shown in the experiments run by Mertz et al. [14]. This field crash offered the unique opportunity to evaluate the neck lARVs using modeling and laboratory sled testing under conditions similar to this field event. The intent of this study was to compare the neck responses measured from the Hybrid III 3-year-old and 6-year-old ATDs in laboratory testing to injuries sustained by the three children in the field crash and investigate the appropriateness of the neck injury assessment reference values. Apparent artifacts associated with the Hybrid III 3-year-old and 6-year-old ATDs were examined. METHODS SLED TESTING A series of five sled tests were conducted on a rebound- type deceleration sled at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The Hybrid III 3-year-old and Hybrid III 6- year-old ATDs were used to simulate the sizes of the children involved in the field crash. The 3-year-old and 6-year-old ATDs, corresponding to the left and right rear occupants respectively, were very similar to the stature of the case vehicle occupants in those seating positions. The 7-year-old in the right front seating position is 72 mm taller and 1 1 .6 kg heavier than the 6-year-old ATD. Each sled test contained two ATDs, which were positioned in the outboard seating locations of a standard FMVSS 213 bench seat [6]. The ATDs were restrained by either a lap belt (three point restraint with shoulder belt portion behind child's back) or a lap/shoulder belt. The sled tests were recorded using high-speed digital video cameras (1000 frames per second) which provided side view and overhead coverage, and an 8-frame rapid- sequence Polaroid camera. See Table 1 for a description of the configuration for each sled test. TABLE 1: Matrix of sled tests conducted at UMTRI utilizing a 25 mph, modified FMVSS 213 sled pulse.

Due to lack of availability of a test fixture and seats like the SUV case vehicle, the FMVSS 213 test fixture and seat were used in the sled tests [6]. Differences between the SUV and FMVSS 213 seats are not expected to significantly affect the potential for neck injury because only the legs and buttocks of the ATD were contacting the seat when the peak neck loads were generated. The dummy H-point was used as the reference point for locating the belt anchorages, therefore the belt position on the ATD was the same for the 213 seat as it would have been with the SUV seat. Occupant compartment intrusion did not occur in the field crash which eliminated it as a variable when comparing the sled tests and the field crash. The Hybrid III 3-year-old and 6-year-old ATDs were instrumented with tri-axial head and chest accelerometers; a chest potentiometer, and a six-axis upper neck load cell. The measured responses are filtered per SAE J211 [26] and reported per the SAE J1733 sign convention [25]. Belt loads were also measured during each test. Appendix A contains the external resultant head impact force equation, the moment transfer equation to obtain the upper neck 186</page><page sequence="5">moment about the y-axis at the occipital condyle for the Hybrid III 6-year-old ATD, and the neck injury predictor, Nij, equations used for the calculated dummy responses. All test data were filtered according to the procedures in SAE J211 [26]. The Nij biomechanical neck injury predictors (NTe = tension/extension and NTF = tension/flexion) were calculated for the upper neck as specified in Appendix A [2, 19, 18, 15, 16, 17]. Table 2 summarizes the upper neck injury assessment reference values specified for in-position testing by Mertz et al. [17], and the upper neck limits specified for out-of- position testing by FMVSS 208 [5] for the Hybrid III 3- year-old and Hybrid III 6-year-old ATDs. The data generated from the sled testing was compared to both sets of injury values. TABLE 2: Upper Neck Injury Criteria for the Hybrid III 3- year-old and Hybrid III 6-year-old ATDs.

To simulate the restraint use of the left rear 3-year-old occupant in the field crash, a Hybrid III 3-year- old ATD was restrained only by the lap belt with the shoulder portion positioned behind the back for Tests 1 and 2. The rear seat belt geometry used in the sleds duplicated the rear seat belt geometry of the case vehicle. To simulate the restraint use of the right rear 6- year-old occupant in the field crash, a Hybrid III 6-year- old ATD was restrained only by the lap belt with the shoulder portion positioned behind the back for Tests 1 and 2. Case vehicle rear seat belt geometry was duplicated, but 150 millimeters of slack was introduced into this belt system. In the field crash, the right rear 6- year-old occupant's head contacted the back of the right front passenger seat in the case vehicle. Modeling studies indicated that 150 millimeters of slack was necessary in the lap portion of the belt system to reproduce the field crash kinematics that allowed the occupant's head to make contact with the back of the front seat back [30]. No front seat was present in the sled tests, so head to seat back contact could not occur. The sled tests did not attempt to fully re-create the right rear 6-year-old occupant's head contact with the front seat back in the field crash, so that camera coverage of the ATDs' kinematics could be optimized. Front seats were also not run in the sled tests so that the head, neck and chest responses for all of the ATDs could be analyzed and compared directly without the added variable of head contact with other interior components. Figure 4: Hybrid III 6-year-old (simulated right rear belt anchorages) and Hybrid III 3-year-old (simulated left rear belt anchorages) lap belted only sled test set-up (Tests 1 and 2). Figure 5: Hybrid III 6-year-old (simulated right front belt anchorages) and Hybrid III 3-year-old (simulated left rear belt anchorages) LAP/SHOULDER belted sled test set- up (Tests 3, 4 and 5). To simulate the restraint use of the right front 7-year-old occupant in the field crash, a Hybrid III 6-year-old ATD was restrained by a three-point lap/shoulder belt for Tests 3, 4, and 5. The right front seat belt geometry of the case vehicle was duplicated. To evaluate what effect a three-point restraint might have had on the 3-year-old case occupant, a Hybrid III 3-year-old ATD was restrained by the left rear three-point lap/shoulder belt in Tests 3, 4, and 5. The case vehicle left rear seat belt geometry was duplicated. New seat belts, similar in material properties and with the same geometry as the actual belts installed in the case vehicle (case vehicle belts out of production), were used for each test. The 30 mph sled pulse specified in FMVSS 213 [6] was modified to a 25 mph, 80 millisecond (msec) pulse for use in these sled tests, in order to more closely simulate the case vehicle's response in the field crash. Also, due to constraints in the ability of the available rebound sled 187</page><page sequence="6">to produce longer duration pulses like the FMVSS 208 30 mph, 125 msec sled pulse [4], the shorter duration, 25 mph, modified FMVSS 213 sled pulse was used. All the sled tests were conducted using the same 25 mph, modified FMVSS 213 pulse, and the longitudinal acceleration and velocity associated with this sled pulse is shown in Figures 6 and 7. Modeling As previously described by Sochor et al., 2004, the occupant responses (kinematics and injury criteria) from the field crash were evaluated using rigid body vehicle and occupant modeling techniques. The MADYMO occupant simulation software (TNO Automotive, Delft, The Netherlands), was used for this simulation. A MADYMO model was created of a generic sport utility vehicle having internal geometry similar to the case vehicle. The seats, seat positions, belt mounting positions, and other relevant interior structures were derived from drawings of the vehicle. Interior structures were modeled with rigid bodies. Material properties for seats and other interior structures were derived from previously developed models. Body structures in certain areas (glass, sheetmetal and seatbelts) were modeled with finite elements to look more closely at potential interactions. For this study, modeling was used to understand the effects of variation in crash pulse on the ATD responses. A model was created to simulate the FMVSS 213 fixture tests that were done for this study. A rigid body sled buck model was developed that had the proper seat geometry and foam force deflection properties (utilizing solid finite elements) that exist for a seat as designated in the 213 standard. The child dummies were modeled in the same position relative to the seat as the actual test set-up. While the actual deceleration pulse of the field crash is not known, the impact of the front of the SUV case vehicle into the side of a passenger car suggests a pulse longer in duration than that of a rigid barrier test. WINDSMASH estimated the longitudinal delta V in the field crash to be 28 mph. The configuration of the crash and the estimated delta V suggest that the FMVSS 208 30 mph, 125 millisecond sled pulse would be reasonably representative of the field accident. Due to constraints in the ability of the available rebound sled to produce longer duration pulses like the FMVSS 208 30 mph, 125 millisecond sled pulse, the shorter duration FMVSS 213 sled pulse was modified to produce a 25 mph change in velocity. MADYMO modeling was used to compare the sensitivity of the ATD responses to the modified 25 mph, FMVSS 213 pulse; the FMVSS 208 30 mph, 125 msec pulse; and a 30 mph rigid barrier crash pulse. The pulses evaluated were 1) a 30 mph barrier pulse of the exact same make and model vehicle from the NHTSA vehicle crash database, 2) the FMVSS 208, 30 mph, 125 msec generic sled pulse first specified in the March 19, 1997, version of FMVSS 208 [4], and 3) a modified FMVSS 213 sled pulse [6] that took into account the pulse limitations of the sled system used for the 213 tests. These acceleration and velocity pulses are shown in Figures 6 and 7. Figure 6: Comparison of longitudinal acceleration pulses (g's). Figure 7: Comparison of longitudinal velocity pulses (mph). Figures 8 and 9 compare the modeled upper neck force, Fz (tension/compression), and neck moment, My (flexion/extension), for the three pulses with a lap-belted 6-year-old Hybrid III ATD. Figures 10 and 11 compare the modeled upper neck force, Fz (tension/compression), and neck moment, My (flexion/extension), for the three pulses with a lap- shoulder-belted 6-year-old Hybrid III ATD. The model predicted that the modified 25 mph, FMVSS 213 pulse would produce neck tensions and moments similar in magnitude but offset earlier in the event than the FMVSS 208 30 mph, 125 ms pulse. The modeled barrier pulse produced neck tensions and moments similar in timing but greater in magnitude to the modified 25 mph, FMVSS 213 pulse. 188</page><page sequence="7">Figure 8: Modeling Results Comparing the Upper neck z- force (tension/compression) vs time for the Hybrid III six- year-old lap belted occupant.

CHIN-TO-CHEST CONTACT ANALYSIS The third, fourth, and fifth sled tests were run with lap/shoulder belted Hybrid III 3-year-old and 6-year-old ATDs. In each of these three tests, chin-to-chest contact was observed with both ATDs. The results from the lap/shoulder belted tests were analyzed while considering the neck responses in the period of time before chin-to-chest contact, and the responses resulting from chin-to-chest contact. In order to quantify the timing and duration of this contact, resultant external head impact forces were calculated per the procedure specified in SAE J2052 [27], See Appendix A for the equations and head masses used in the calculations. Tables 5 and 6 summarize the time of chin-to-chest contact for all of the lap/shoulder belted tests, as determined by using the external head impact force calculation procedure.

The maximum Nte and peak neck tension values for the lap/shoulder belted Hybrid III 3-year-old tests are reported in Table 7 for the period of time before chin-to-chest contact.

Table 7 reports the maximum NTF and peak neck tension values that resulted from chin-to-chest contact. These neck responses were compared to both the injury assessment reference values specified for in- position testing [17], and the upper neck limits specified for out-of-position testing by FMVSS 208 [5] (as listed in Table 2), and are reported as a percentage of those values.

The upper neck z- force (tension/compression) time history responses can be found in Appendix C. PERCENT RISK OF INJURY The risk of injury as a result of the measured peak neck tensions was calculated for each of the lap only belted tests and lap/shoulder belted tests using updated injury risk curves specified by Mertz et al. [17]. The IARV for peak neck tension was based on a 3% risk of an AIS &gt; 3 injury. In the development of the neck tension IARV, it was assumed the neck muscles of an in-position occupant would be tensed to 80% of their maximum muscle tone [12], and the normalized values for use in applying the risk curves to in-position testing were adjusted to account for 80% muscle tone [17]. Out-of- positlon neck tension IARV is not adjusted for muscle tension. Tables 9 and 10 report the estimated percent risk of an AIS&gt;3 neck injury due to neck tension for the lap belted Hybrid III 3-year-old and Hybrid III 6-year-old, respectively. The normalized values used in applying this injury risk curve to both in-position and OOP testing are also given in the tables, and percent risk is calculated for both conditions.

Such comparisons are relevant only to the extent the test environment simulates the field crash and to the extent the neck forces and moments measured by the Hybrid III 3 and 6-year-old ATDs are humanlike. The in-position injury assessment reference values and the FMVSS 208 out-of-position limits for neck injury criteria that were approached or exceeded in the belted frontal crash environment simulated were the peak neck tension, and the NTE and NTf- The discussion focuses on these measures of injury potential from the sled tests and the extent to which they simulate the field crash. Peak upper neck compression, NCe, and NCf values were found to be insignificant in this study, and therefore are not further discussed in detail. The parameters of the field crash are not precisely known, and the sled test environment could not exactly replicate the field crash. However, the MADYMO model indicates the field crash and the sled tests are similar In severity and would be expected to produce similar neck tensions and moments. NECK RESPONSES - LAP BELTED SLED TESTS The first and second sled tests used the same test conditions and produced essentially the same results. The shoulder belt was placed behind the backs of both the Hybrid III 3-year-old positioned on the left side of the FMVSS 213 bench seat and the Hybrid III 6-year-old positioned on the right side of the seat. The head, neck, and torso kinematics of both the lap belted Hybrid III 3-year-old and Hybrid III 6-year-old were similar, except for belt slack in the Hybrid III 6-year-old's belt system that caused the measured dummy responses to shift later in time and delayed the time at which the ATD pitched forward into the restraint system. As the lap belt restrained the lower torso, the upper torso pitched forward before the head rotated significantly resulting in neck extension with relatively small angular bending of the neck. For example, Figures 20 and 21 show the position of the ATD during Test 1 at this time of measured peak neck extension moment. Figure 20 - Hybrid III 3-year-old lap belted ATD position at the time of peak neck extension moment during Test 1 (75 ms). Figure 21 - Hybrid III 6-year-old lap belted ATD position at the time of peak neck extension moment during Test 1 (79 ms). 193</page><page sequence="12">In all of the lap belted tests with the Hybrid III 3-year-old and 6-year-old ATDs, the neck extension and NTE peaked at the same time. For example, Figure 22 Illustrates the relative timing of the neck extension, neck tension, and NTE for the lap belted Hybrid III 6-year-old in Test 1. The NTE curve shown in this figure was calculated using the in-position intercepts. For demonstration of the timing of the occurrence of extension and tension throughout the event, the extension and tension were divided by their respective in- position intercepts for comparison purposes to the timing of the NTE in order to graphically see the contribution of each of these two components to the combined tension- extension NTE. Early in the event the neck extension is more of a contributor to NTE than the neck tension, but neck tension becomes more of a contributor to NTE later in the event. Figure 22 - Lap belted only, Hybrid III 6-year-old comparison of the contributions of extension and tension to Nte for Test 1. In the lap belted only tests, neck tension peaked later than neck extension for all ATDs, after the head rotated to a position approximately in line with the torso, and the torso was about 20 degrees above the horizontal. For example, Figures 23 and 24 show the position of the ATD during Test 1 at this time of measured peak neck tension. Time history graphs of the upper neck moment about the y-axis (flexion/extension) and upper neck z- force (tension/compression) are provided in Appendix B for the lap belted Hybrid III 3-year-old and Hybrid III 6- year-old tests. Head contact with the lower extremities and head contact with the base of the seat in the case of the Hybrid III 6-year-old, occurred later in the test sequence but did not affect the peak Nij values, neck forces, or neck moments. No chin-to-chest contact occurred in the lap belted tests. Figure 23 - Hybrid III 3-year-old lap belted ATD position at the time of peak neck tension (91 ms) during Test 1 . Figure 24 - Hybrid III 6-year-old lap belted ATD position at the time of peak neck tension during Test 1 (103 ms). The high neck extension values, which produced the peak Nij values, were generated with relatively little head-to-neck motion. This response has been reported by Kang et al. [10] and Agaram et al. [1] during air bag loading of the Hybrid III 5th percentile ATD and was attributed to lack of laxity in the occipital condyle joint in the neck of the Hybrid III 5th percentile ATD. However, Agaram et al. [1] felt this was not an issue in belt restraint testing. The Hybrid III 6-year-old ATD has a similalr OC joint to the Hybrid III 5th percentile ATD, and both of these ATD necks contain nodding blocks. Although the Hybrid III 3-year-old neck structure is different from the 6 year-old, both are designed to meet human response corridors, and both ATDs measured high neck extension moments without significant relative head motion in these sled tests. This measured response is likely due to the lack of laxity at the occipital condyle region. Nusholtz et al. [24] found that no values used in the Nij criterion corresponding to compressive force, extension moment and flexion moment optimally separated the injury and non-injury cases in the biomechanical data set examined. Only the tensile force allowed identification of 194</page><page sequence="13">the injury risk. The peak neck tensions for the tests with the lap belted Hybrid III 3-year-old were 93% and 97% of the out-of-position IARV and 74% and 77% of the in- position IARV. The peak neck tensions for the tests with the lap belted Hybrid III 6-year-old were 104% and 109% of the out-of-position IARV and 82% and 86% of the in- position IARV. The neck tension lARVs are intended to correspond to a low risk (3%) of AIS 3 injury [17]. The Hybrid III 3-year- old neck tension values from the lap belted Tests 1 and 2 correspond to a risk of AIS = 3 or greater neck injury of 1% and 2% respectively, using the out-of-position criteria and a risk level of less than 0.1% for both tests using the in-position criteria. The Hybrid III 6-year-old neck tension values from the lap belted Tests 1 and 2 correspond to a risk of AIS = 3 or greater neck injury of 7% and 13% respectively, using the out-of-position criteria and a risk level of 0.1% or less for both tests using the in-position criteria. The two lap belted children in the field crash sustained AIS = 2 neck injuries indicating an incipient condition leading to potentially more severe neck injuries [32]. It is unlikely that the two lap belted children in the rear seat tensed their neck muscles in response to the impending crash. Absent tensing of the neck muscles, the out-of- position lARVs would be the most appropriate for comparison. The atlanto-occipital dislocations that these children suffered were AIS = 2 injuries. The interpretation of the imaging studies and physical exams revealed no evidence of cord laceration or contusion and a lack of fracture present in the cervical vertebrae. Hemorrhage between the tectorial membrane and clivus does not represent an epidural hemorrhage thus these are considered AIS = 2 injuries. However, the neurosurgeons felt the 3-year-olds AIS =2 injury represented an unstable AO complex and recommended surgical intervention. To the extent the test environment simulates the field crash, the Hybrid III 3 and 6-year-old ATDs and the neck tension lARVs seem consistent with the injuries sustained by the lap belted 3 and 6-year-old children in the field crash. NECK RESPONSES - LAP/SHOULDER BELTED SLED TESTS The kinematics of both the lap/shoulder belted Hybrid III 3-year-old and Hybrid III 6-year-old were similar in all lap/shoulder belted Tests 3, 4 and 5. As the lap and shoulder belts restrained the upper torso and lower torso, the head initially translated forward resulting in neck tension and extension with little or no perceivable angular bending of the neck. The combination of tension and extension in the earlier stages of the sled tests produced the highest NTE values near the time the neck extension peaked. Figures 25 and 26 show the positions of the ATDs during Test 3 at the time of measured peak neck extension moment. Figure 25 - Hybrid III 3-year-old lap/shoulder belted ATD position at the time of peak neck extension during Test 3 (52 ms). Figure 26 - Hybrid III 6-year-old lap/shoulder belted ATD position at the time of peak neck extension during Test 3 (52 ms). The head then rotated forward producing neck flexion. The chin of both the Hybrid III 3-year-old and the Hybrid III 6-year-old ATDs ultimately impacted the chest. The chin-to-chest contact increased the chest acceleration and deflection measures at the time of contact and resulted in the highest measured neck tensions and NTF values throughout the lap/shoulder belted sled tests. Figures 27 through 32 show NTF vs. time, resultant chest acceleration vs. time, and chest deflection vs. time for the Hybrid III 3-year-olds and 6-year-olds, respectively. The time the chin is in contact with the chest is indicated by the shaded region. 195</page><page sequence="14">Figure 27: NTF vs. time for the lap/shoulder belted Hybrid III 3-year-old (using in-position intercepts).

Figure 33 shows the NTE for the lap/shoulder belted Hybrid III 6-year-old in Test 3, overlaid with the neck tension response (divided by the in-position neck tension Nij intercept value) and the neck extension response (divided by the in-position neck extension Nij intercept value). This comparison displays the different contributions of neck extension and neck tension throughout the duration of the sled test. Early in the event, neck extension is the primary contributor to NTE, 196</page><page sequence="15">but between approximately 65 and 147 msec, neck tension is the sole contributor to NTE. Chin-to-chest contact occurred during this period of time. This comparison is similar for the other Hybrid III 6-year-olds in Tests 4 and 5, and the Hybrid III 3-year-olds in Tests 4, 5 and 6. The Hybrid III 6-year-old data from Test 3 are shown as a representative example. Figure 33 - Lap/shoulder belted, Hybrid III 6-year-old neck responses vs. NTe for Test 3. The high neck extension values, which produced the peak Nij values, were generated with relatively little or no head-to-neck motion. Figure 26 shows the position of the Hybrid III 6-year-old ATD during Test 3 at the time of maximum recorded neck extension. This ATD response was discussed previously relative to the lap belted tests, and the same response was observed in the lap/shoulder belted tests. Figure 34 shows the NTf for the lap/shoulder belted Hybrid III 6-year-old in Test 3, overlaid with the neck tension response (divided by the in-position neck tension Nij intercept value) and the neck flexion response (divided by the in-position neck flexion Nij intercept value). This comparison displays the different contributions of neck flexion and neck tension throughout the duration of the sled test. Neck tension is essentially the sole contributor to NTf until approximately 65 msec, and remains a major contributor to NTf throughout the rest of the event. This comparison is similar for the other Hybrid III 6-year-olds in Tests 4 and 5, and the Hybrid III 3-year-olds in Tests 4, 5 and 6. One of the comparisons is shown here as an example. Figure 34 - Lap/shoulder belted, Hybrid III 6-year-old neck responses vs. NTF for Test 3. In the lap/shoulder belted tests chin-to-chest contact produced the highest NTF values for the event, and a second peak in neck tension that was higher than the neck tension peak before chin-to-chest contact. Figures 35 and 36 below show the point in time during Test 3 where peak neck tension, peak neck flexion, and maximum chin-to-chest interaction occurred for the Hybrid III 3-year-old and Hybrid III 6-year-old, respectively. Figure 35 - Hybrid III 3-year-old lap/shoulder belted ATD position at the time of peak neck flexion, peak neck tension, and maximum chin-to-chest interaction during Test 3 (80 ms). 197</page><page sequence="16">Figure 36 - Hybrid III 6-year-old lap/shoulder belted ATD position at the time of peak neck flexion, peak neck tension, and maximum chin-to-chest interaction during Test 3 (95 ms). Hybrid III 3-year-old, lap/shoulder belted tests produced peak neck tensions prior to chin-to-chest contact of 99%, 96%, and 90% of the out-of-position IARV and 78%, 76%, and 71% of the in-position IARV. The 3 year-old neck tension values produced prior to chin-to-chest contact correspond to a risk of AIS = 3 or greater neck injury of 0.5% - 3% using the out-of-position criteria that don't incorporate muscle tone, and a risk level of less than 0.1% using the in-position criteria which do consider muscle tone. During chin-to-chest contact, the Hybrid III 3-year-old produced neck tensions of 1 70%, 1 58%, and 162% of the out-of-position IARV and 135%, 124%, and 128% of the in-position IARV. The 3-year-old neck tension values produced from chin-to-chest contact correspond to a risk of AIS = 3 or greater neck injury of 1 00% using the out-of-position criteria and a risk level of 49% - 77% using the in-position criteria. Hybrid III 6-year-old, lap/shoulder belted tests produced peak neck tensions prior to chin-to-chest contact of 71%, 83%, and 68% of the out-of-position IARV and 56%, 65%, and 54% of the in-position IARV. The 6 year-old neck tension values produced prior to chin-to-chest contact correspond to a risk of AIS = 3 or greater neck injury of less than 0.1% using the out-of-position or in- position criteria. During chin-to-chest contact, the Hybrid III 6-year-old produced neck tensions of 161%, 142%, and 169% of the out-of-position IARV and 127%, 112%, and 1 33% of the in-position IARV. The 6-year-old neck tension values produced from chin-to-chest contact correspond to a risk of AIS = 3 or greater neck injury of 90% to 1 00% using the out-of-position criteria and a risk level of 17% - 74% using the in-position criteria. When the MADYMO model was used to compare the sensitivity of the ATD responses to the sled pulse, it predicted peak neck tensions and NTF in the lap/shoulder belted tests would occur during chin-to-chest contact. Differences between what the model predicted during chin-to-chest contact and the experimental sled results are probably due to lack of information concerning the actual force deflection properties of the ATD in the area of the chin and the upper chest when contacted by the chin. The MADYMO model uses two ellipsoids, a rigid one for the head and a deformable one for the face, including the chin. Uniform force/deflection properties are defined for the MADYMO face ellipse. The face ellipse force deflection properties were derived from the head drop test to the forehead specified in Part 572 [21, 22]. It is unlikely that the actual force/deflection properties of the chin are the same as the forehead. Furthermore, the model used the force/deflection properties from the pendulum tests to the center of the chest as specified in Part 572 for the entire chest region. Again, it is unlikely that the force/deflection properties of the upper chest, when impacted by the chin are the same as those described in Part 572. To the extent the test environment simulates the field crash, the lap/shoulder belted, Hybrid III 6-year-old, neck tensions measured during chin-to-chest contact and the predicted risk of AIS = 3 or greater injury seem inconsistent with the AIS = 2 neck injuries sustained by the lap/shoulder belted 7-year-old child in the field crash. The biofidelity of chin-to-chest contact in the Hybrid III child ATDs and its effect on HIC measurements has been noted in Dorel Juvenile Group's comments to the FMVSS 213 docket [3], and by Tylko and Dalmotas [33]. After observing neck loads exceeding published injury thresholds in all tests with a Hybrid III 6-year-old ATD, even though non-contact cervical injuries are rare in correctly restrained children, Sherwood et al. [29], concluded that the stiff thoracic spine of the ATD resulted in non-humanlike kinematics, neck forces, and neck moments. Sherwood et al. [29] also noted that an area of concern was the biofidelity of the chin-to-chest interface. Possible reasons for the stiffer chin-to-chest contact were identified as a stiffer metal chin of dummy, lack of a temporomandibular joint in the dummy, lack of anterior-posterior translation in the dummy's cervical spine, the stiff chest of the dummy, and mass of the ribs in the dummy. Menon et al. [11] observed similar kinematics with the Hybrid III 6-year-old in a high-back- booster seat at a test speed of 56 kph. There was no indication that the chin of the lap-shoulder belted 7-year- old impacted the child's chest with significant force in the field crash. It is not known whether there was contact between the child's chin and chest or to what degree such contact may have contributed to the child's A-0 injury. CONCLUSIONS Investigating the appropriateness of the in-position and OOP neck lARVs with sled testing was complicated by apparent artifacts associated with the Hybrid III 3 and 6- year-old ATDs. These apparent artifacts significantly affected neck injury values measured with the 3 and 6- year-old Hybrid III ATDs. 198</page><page sequence="17">In both the lap belted tests and the lap/shoulder belted tests, high neck extension measurements were generated, which produced the peak NTE values without significant relative head-to-neck motion of the Hybrid III neck. Although the neck configurations of the 3 and 6 year-old ATDs are different, the high neck extension phenomena without significant relative head motion observed in these sled tests is likely due to the lack of laxity in the OC joint. In the lap/shoulder belted tests, high neck tension measurements were generated from the ATDs chin contacting the chest, which produced peak neck tension measurements well in excess of the neck lARVs. Because humanlike kinematics and force deflection properties for belt-restrained chin-to-chest contact have not been defined and ATD force deflection criteria are not specified for chin-to-chest contact [21, 22], the relevance of the neck data measured by the ATD after the point of chin-to-chest contact is in question. The two lap belted children in the field crash sustained AIS = 2 neck injuries indicating an incipient condition leading to potentially more severe neck injuries. It is unlikely that the two lap belted children in the rear seat tensed their neck muscles in response to the impending crash. To the extent the test environment simulated the field crash, the out-of-position lARVs seemed consistent with the injuries sustained by the lap belted 3 and 6-year- old children in the field crash. The injuries sustained by the lap/shoulder belted 7-year- old in the field crash, were not consistent with the sled test peak neck tension measurements that occurred during chin-to-chest contact. The neck tension measurements from the ATD that were recorded up to the point of chin-to-chest contact, were consistent with the neck injury sustained by the 7-year-old lap/shoulder belted right front passenger. It is not known whether there was contact between the chin and chest of the lap- shoulder belted 7-year-old in the field crash or to what degree such contact may have contributed to the child's neck injury. While the Hybrid III 3-year-old and 6-year-old ATDs are the best available tools for assessing child neck injury potential, judgment is needed in interpreting the neck data from tests with belt restraint systems. It is inappropriate to only consider the peak neck measurements without examining the events surrounding those peak values.

Resultant external head impact force calculation [26]: To calculate the inertia loads on the head*: F Xmmialaixl F y inenialaad ^ Y.-.j F Zinertialaad *A Hybrid III 3-year-old ATD head mass of 2.63 kg, and a Hybrid III 6-year-old ATD head mass of 3.19 kg was used in the calculation, which represented the masses of the heads above the measurement strain gage in the upper neck load cell. To calculate the head impact forces: r = r - r Xhead Xinertialaad Xupperneck F y - F y - F y head y inertialaad ^ upperneck F = F - F Z head â *- Zinertialaad Zupperneck To calculate the resultant head impact force: F reshead Ä¼Ä¼ (jF X head ) ^F y head Ã ^ (jF zhead ) 2. Calculation of the translated moment about the y-axis of the occipital condyle for the Hybrid III 6-year-old ATD [24]: The IARV for neck moments was based about the occipital condyle, however, for the Hybrid III 6-year-old ATD, the moment is not measured about the same location. The following equations allow for the moment to be translated from the point of measurement to where the IARV is applicable (the corrected moment). The measurements are at the correct location for the Hybrid III 3-year-old, so the moment does not need to be corrected for this ATD. M oCy = M MeasuredY ~ (D * F x) Where, M 0Cy = the corrected moment about the y-axis (Nm) Fx = the measured force output in the x-direction (N) M MeamredY = measured y-axis moment output (Nm) D = vertical distance between the axis of the load cell and the axis of the condyle (0.01778 m) 3.
