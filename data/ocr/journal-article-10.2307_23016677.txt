<plain_text><page sequence="1">"A Different Starting Point, a Different Metaphysics": Reading Bergson and Barad Diffractively IRIS VAN DER TUIN This article provides an affirmative feminist reading of the philosophy of Henri Berg son by reading it through the work of Karen Barad. Adopting such a diffractive reading strategy enables feminist philosophy to move beyond discarding Bergson for his apparent phalbcentrism. Feminist phibsophy finds itself double bound when it cri tiques a phibsophy for being phalbcentric, because the setup of a master narrative comes into being with the critique. By negating a gender-blind or sexist phibsophy, feminist phibsophy only reaffirms its parameters, and setting up a master narrative costs feminist phibsophy its feminism. I thus propose and practice a different methodobgical starting point, one that capitalizes on "diffraction." This article ex periments with the affirmative phase in feminist phibsophy prophesied by Elizabeth Grosz, among others. Working along the lines of the diffractive method, the article at the same time proposes a new reading of Bergson (as well as of Barad), a new, differ ent metaphysics indeed, which can be specified as onto-epistemological or "new materialist." The philosophy of Henri Bergson is gaining in popularity among feminist phi losophers. This article adds to this trend. By offering a diffractive reading of Bergson's oeuvre and the work of Karen Barad, 1 engage with Bergson in two ways: feminist ways of reading Bergson and a feminist reading of the philosophy together form the core of this article. Reading diffractively breaks through the academic habit of criticism and works along affirmative lines. The contours of an affirmative feminist take on Bergson have been given by Elizabeth Grosz in "Deleuze's Bergson: Duration, the Virtual and a Politics of the Future" (Grosz 2000), The Nick of Time: Politics, Evolution, and the Untimely (Grosz 2004), and Hypatia vol. 26, no. 1 (Winter, 2011) © by Hypatia, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">Iris van der Tuin 23 Time Travels: Feminism, Nature, Power (Grosz 2005). Reading affirmatively entails "a mode of assenting to rather than dissenting from those 'primary' texts" (Grosz 2005, 3). Grosz explicates how a critical rendering of texts, a ges ture that is fundamentally a distancing act, functions "as a form of dismissal of texts, rather than as an analysis of the embeddedness of critique in that which it criticizes" (3). An affirmative reading does not allow for leaving a text un touched, and requires a text's readers to engage with the transformation (2). In other words, assenting to philosophical texts does not mean that the texts are solely celebrated. Moving away from the intrinsically connected tendencies of critiquing Bergson and reading his work only celebratorily, thus undoing feminism's good practice of not having itself, effectively, "habituat[ed] to a single philosophical perspective" (Olkowski 2000, 3), makes Grosz's methodology innovative. In her own affirmative readings of Bergson, however, a disjunction between Berg son and feminism can still be found. It is only after Bergson is discussed in depth that the reading is affirmatively applied to feminist theory and politics. I will attempt to work with an affirmative method that is immediately feminist. I suggest, "let us go further and try to engender" (Bergson 1934/2007, 47; com pare Bergson 1907/1998, 207), that is, to work on how to effectuate a feminist Bergsonism for the twenty-first century as well as actually to effectuate it. Similarly to John Mullarkey (1999, 2), I propose to concentrate on the con temporary significance of Bergson, and not to adhere to a linear theory of the development of thought, which would be un-Bergsonian. A comparison, how ever, is not what I offer either. I will adopt a diffractive method as an alternative for the double bind just alluded to, as well as for the disjunction to be found in the work of Grosz, and will read early twentieth-century Bergson and early twenty-first-century Barad diffractively.1 Diffraction makes Grosz's assenting move precise. It entails refraining from isolating philosophies, in their time or as (dialectically related) closed wholes. After all, a new metaphysics originates in the movement of thought, in thinking in duration. This implies that the article also proposes a Bergsonian reading of the work of Barad. Not withstanding that my focus is on Bergson and feminist philosophy, I will also specify how the diffractive reading makes Barad precise. From Criticism to Affirmation: Reading Diffractively Grosz's plea for an affirmative, uncritical rendering of texts can be read as Berg sonian. In The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics, Bergson attempts to shift the philosophical tendency toward criticism. Language and society, as well as man's natural tendency toward action and thus toward utilitarianism, have led philosophers to subscribe to criticism, whereas Bergson says "[i]t is a far cry from concrete reality to the reality we should have reconstructed a priori!"</page><page sequence="3">24 Hypatia (Bergson 1934/2007, 65). The reconstruction suits the critical mind, "since its role is not to work on the thing, but to appraise what some one has said about it" (65). Working with words, that is, along the lines of the intellect, prevents one from getting at reality; Bergson talks about "the impossibility of satisfacto rily getting the real into the ready-made garments of our ready-made concepts, the necessity of making to measure" (Bergson 1907/1998, 48). Language, that is, a set of "pre-existing concepts" (162; emphasis in original) thoroughly influ ences our approach to reality; it makes sensations felt as repetition without difference, and at times simply deceives us (Bergson 1889/1913, 131). How ever, things are in fact slightly more complicated than Bergson disposing of language. At first, in Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Conscious ness, it indeed seems as if "language" is being condemned when Bergson states that "[b]oth parties [mechanism and dynamism as false opposites] commit themselves to a confusion which arises from language, and which is due to the fact that language is not meant to convey all the delicate shades of inner states" (Bergson 1889/1913, 160). Later in the book (as well as in later books), this statement is made complex when Bergson asserts that "immediate intuition and discursive thought are one in concrete reality, and the very mechanism by which we only meant at first to explain our conduct will end by also controlling it" (237). The word in Bergson touches on the "order-word" as conceptualized by Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari (Deleuze and Guattari 1980/1987, 75ff.; compare Deleuze 1966/1991, 15). According to Bergson, "[1 language transmits orders or warnings. It prescribes or describes. ... But in either case the function is industrial, commercial, military, always social" (Bergson 1934/2007, 62-63). "[T]he philosophical mind," contrary to the critical one, "is sympathetic to the endless renovation and re-invention which are at the bottom of things, and words have a definite meaning, a conventional value relatively fixed; they can express the new only as a rearrangement of the old" (64). Bergson thus says we should refrain from putting words at center stage, because then we would find ourselves constrained by their simplifying or deceptive effects on the basis of a spatializing act, as we do when we embark on a critique. This spatializing act, proffered by preexisting concepts, and consequently by linguisticism as well as by utilitarianism, is what Bergson attempts to revise throughout his oeuvre, be cause it is via spatialization that philosophers are led to making unwanted assertions, assertions, for instance, that subscribe to an atomist metaphysics (of time), which prevents reality from being grasped. Installing oneself in reality, the philosopher "will arrive at fluid concepts, capable of following reality in all its windings and of adopting the very movement of the inner life of things" (160). Bergson proposes that "the only acceptable criticism would be a new study, more deeply pursued but equally direct, of the thing itself' (66). He calls this new study, which works with the fluid concepts just mentioned, "intuitive</page><page sequence="4">Iris van der Tuin 25 metaphysics." Before I move on to what this new study entails, let me provide an example of the linguistic simplification or deception just mentioned, which can be found in a recent critical, feminist reading of Bergson. In two articles, Rebecca Hill comments on the phallocentrism (and Eurocentrism) that, she claims, is constitutive of the philosophy of Bergson. Bergson, in her reading, offers a phallocentric philosophy, because "his intu ition of the enduring self is elaborated within restrictively masculine parameters" (Hill 2008a, 119). Hill states that "Bergson's commitment to du alism can be read as symptomatic of a disavowal of a sexed hierarchy at the very heart of his philosophical system" and that "Bergson's celebrated monistic in tegration of the divergent tendencies of life and matter maintains this sexed hierarchy" (Hill 2008b, 124). By adhering to a "sexed hierarchy," Bergson's work "demonstrate[s] the valorisation of a hypermasculine theory of life and corresponding devaluation of matter as feminine" (132). Even though Hill as serts that "[t]his is not a binary hierarchy because Bergson's concepts of life and matter are never actualised as pure activity and pure space" (132), she does end up claiming that "we would do better to reconsider the life-matter relation beyond dualism" (133). Although the intricacies of Bergson's position on life and matter, and other concepts, will be explicated in detail below, it becomes clear here that Hill ascribes to Bergson an endorsement of what Rosi Braidotti has so forcefully summarized as "to be 'different-from'" coming to mean "to be worth less than" (Braidotti 1994, 147; emphasis in original). Yet his entire phi losophy can also be read, precisely, as a move beyond dualism. Hill is critical not only of Bergson. She is also critical of the feminist read ings of Bergson offered by Grosz and Dorothea Olkowski. Hill asserts that Olkowski and Grosz have been too quick to affirm the benefit of Bergson for feminist theory on the basis of direct links between Bergson and Luce Irigaray, or sexual difference theory in general, to be found in the fact that both philos ophers theorize "duration" and "the interval," the former being non-spatialized time and the latter the shifting of a utilitarianist relationality between living beings and things that is equally spatializing (Hill 2008a, 120-21, 130, n. 1). Hill asserts that a complicating move is necessary, and she makes use of the work of Irigaray to try to alter Bergson's phallocentrism (based on his adher ence to the sexed hierarchy between life and matter) in order to make Bergson, in turn, potentially valuable to Irigaray scholarship. Whereas this move sounds diffractive rather than critical, Hill's conclusions show that the text of Bergson has been left untouched, as she concludes: "My critical de scription of Bergson has shown that his claim to overcome space fails" (129) on the basis of a residual, sexed hierarchy. The same happens when Hill discusses Deleuze's take on Bergson. Hill critiques Deleuze because he reads a monistic metaphysics into Bergson, asserting that the latter's dualism is only a method ological step toward monism. Although she underscores Deleuze's reading of</page><page sequence="5">26 Hypatia Bergson's methodology (he has to distinguish between intellect and intuition in order to retain the latter), Hill's eventual evaluation is that the work of Bergson is not monistic, and she sticks to this claim even after having read Bergson through the work of Manuel DeLanda, a Deleuzian after all, who highlights those intuitive parts in the work of Bergson that in fact affirm that "'inert' [feminine] matter is capable of organising itself and acting in ways that exceed mathematical prediction" (Hill 2008b, 135). Although Hill says she is not interested in a feminist condemnation of Berg son (Hill 2008a, 119), she does undertake a criticism that he would find unacceptable. Hill appraises what Bergson has said, and what others have said about Bergson. She works with preexisting concepts and spatializes Bergson's oeuvre and the feminist readings of it. Doing this, Hill corners feminist schol arship on Bergson. Hill, in other words, buys into what Bergson calls "negation" (Bergson 1934/2007, 89), the dialectical stance that "leads to con trary philosophies; it demonstrates the thesis as well as the antithesis of antinomies" (115; compare 168, Deleuze and Guattari 1991/1994, 79-80). Negating Bergson thus leads to celebrating Bergson, to the setting up of a mas ter narrative and to philosophical standpoints critiquing one another, to dialectically related schools of thought, one of which is feminist. How, then, should a feminist philosopher approach Bergson, moving away from celebra torily installing a (new) master narrative yet allowing for feminist philosophy to be something specific? I have indicated above that Grosz has prophesied an answer to this question, and that "diffraction" can be used to push that answer further. Donna Haraway was the first to formulate diffraction for feminist academic purposes. She introduces it in an attempt to move away from a reductive lin guisticism, assuming fixity between signifier and signified, word and thing. Haraway maintains that "the stories of hyper-productionism and enlighten ment have been about the reproduction of the sacred image of the same, of the one true copy, mediated by the luminous technologies of compulsory hetero sexuality and masculinist self-birthing" (Haraway 1992/2004, 69), thus situating Bergson's repetition without difference. She proposes a semiotics of non-fixity, and suggests moving away from what has come to be called "repre sentationalism" in the newly emerging cultural theory of "new materialism" (Van der Tuin and Dolphijn 2010). Feminists would be better off affirming diffraction instead of the spatializing act of representation or reflection, which lures us into reduction as well as reaffirming the phallocentric order. Haraway is as wary of the critical stance as Bergson, as it is said to assume that words have authority over things and bodies (Haraway 1997, 16). Diffraction is said to shift a restrictive linguisticism. Diffraction is meant to disrupt linear and fixed cau salities, and to work toward "more promising interference patterns" (16), both between words and things (allowing for things and bodies to be active in</page><page sequence="6">Iris van der Tuin 27 processes of signification) and between theoretical schools (moving away from dialectically related schools that only repeat one another, and setting up the reductive readings that Bergson, Deleuze and Guattari, Haraway, and other new materialists try to shift qualitatively). Barad has worked out the methodological potentialities of diffraction. Diffraction for Barad is, first of all, a reading strategy that breaks through a di alectics set up between schools of thought on the basis of what Bergson calls negation (Barad 2007, 92-93). A diffractive strategy entails "reading impor tant insights ... through one another" and thus "reworking" concepts that structure these insights or appear in the traditions of thought from which they stem (Barad 2003, 811). Representationalism is such a structuring device; the diffractive method allows us to affirm links between seemingly opposite schools of thought, thus breaking through a politics of negation. At the same time, it allows us to affirm and strengthen links between schools of thought or scholars that only apparently work toward the same goals. Diffraction, then, is the strat egy with which new concepts or traditions, new philosophies, can be engendered. Barad develops the strategy as well as the concept of diffraction (Barad 2007, 73). Diffraction is a physical phenomenon that can indeed inspire a new read ing strategy, but it also has to be read itself, which is what the feminist philosopher and theoretical physicist Barad does when she discusses the study of instances of interference, to be found all around us, in Meeting the Universe Halfway: Quantum Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and Meaning. Dis cussing diffraction as a methodology, Barad claims that (post-)structuralist critique, culminating in feminist standpoint theory or identity politics in gen eral (also when pluralized), has taken the important step toward including the knower as influential in knowledge production into epistemological musings, thus avoiding Haraway's disavowed "God trick." This work, however, contin ues to be "based on the belief that practices of representing have no effect on the objects of investigation and that we have a kind of access to representations that we don't have to the objects themselves" (87). Barad ascribes a Kantian legacy to critique, which is the relativist, representationalist legacy that Berg son attempts to shift throughout his oeuvre. Critique, it is true, all too often translates into a relativism, a point Haraway makes as well (Haraway 1988). Barad does not read the divergent studies of interference along relativist lines. What a diffractive methodology boils down to is the shift of both a relativism and its assumed opposite (realism), in the natural sciences as well as the humanities and philosophy, toward a mode that Barad calls "performative." Performativity entails "moving away from the familiar habits and seductions of representationalism (reflecting on the world from outside) to a way of un derstanding the world from within and as part of it" (Barad 2007, 88). We are no longer "reflecting on representations" (of, for instance, interference, but</page><page sequence="7">28 Hypatia also of schools of thought or scholars that have been stereotyped), thus focusing on language, which suggests a certain fixity, a certain causal linearity, but mov ing to "accounting for how practices matter" (90). An example of these practices is classification, the naturalistic tendency to classify what is to be found "out there" (including languages and schools of thought). Barad says: We do not uncover preexisting facts about independently ex isting things as they exist frozen in time like little statues positioned in the world. Rather, we learn about phenomena— about specific material configurations of the world's becoming. (90-91) This performative mode indeed comes close to what Bergson suggests when he considers life or reality as movement or flux: Everything is obscure in the idea of creation [becoming] if we think of things which are created and a thing which creates, as we habitually do, as the understanding cannot help doing. ... Things are constituted by the instantaneous cut which the un derstanding practices, as a given moment, on a flux of this kind, and what is mysterious when we compare the cuts together be comes clear when we relate them to the flux. (Bergson 1907/ 1998, 248-49; emphasis in original) Barad also talks about "thingification" (Barad 2003, 812, 815), and, likewise, she pleads for scientists and (feminist) philosophers to account for the "cuts" they enact in the world's becoming.2 Barad's performative take aims at shifting representationalism as well as thingification. Bergson, in the above quotation, has the same aim in mind, albeit that his metaphors or images (meant to be fluid concepts) for the preferred alternative are at times suggestive. In the philosophy of Bergson, metaphors, which might suggest semiotics to the contemporary reader, are nothing but tools to think with, tools for artic ulating the intuitive metaphysics with which we immerse ourselves in concrete reality. In The Creative Mind, we encounter Bergson using light and even re flection in an expose about intuition as the approach to "the radically new and absolutely simple idea" (Bergson 1934/2007, 23), whereas the idea of "corre spondence" is usually reserved for a science not (yet) complemented by intuitive metaphysics (see, e.g., Bergson 1934/2007, 32). Although we enter the realm of criticism with these remarks, they may provide a preliminary dem onstration of the fact that reading Bergson and Barad diffractively, that is, through one another, elucidating and strengthening the work of both accord ing to a feminist methodology of affirmation, may be a helpful strategy. Bergson does not buy into representationalism, and despite the fact that he does not make diffraction into a conceptual tool, it is used once as such, namely when</page><page sequence="8">Iris van der Tuin 29 Bergson talks about the sudden experiencing of our deepest self when we abruptly drift away from our habits as an experience "disturbing my whole con sciousness like a stone which falls into the water of a pond" (Bergson 1889/ 1913, 168) (thus effectuating an interference pattern). Barad's straightforward move away from representationalism engenders a feminist philosophy (she calls it "agential realism"; compare Bergson's "partial realism"3) along the lines of the theory of time set out by Bergson, despite the fact that she does not men tion "duration" nor does she reference the work of Bergson anywhere in her work.4 Nevertheless, Barad is most explicit about qualitatively shifting spatiali zed time (see, e.g., Barad 2001). Let us use these preparatory observations to move to really reading Bergson and Barad diffractively, first by considering their oeuvres in general, second by discussing the complementary relation be tween science and philosophy that Bergson announces or pleads for, and Barad, in my reading, practices. It is in this complementarity that the diffractive read ing can find its apotheosis. Leaving Matter Halfway : Meeting the Universe Halfway When we consider Bergson's famous statement that a philosopher brings for ward only one idea (Bergson 1934/2007, 88-89), Matter and Memory should be seen as the key to his own oeuvre. It is in this book that his theory of duration is most explicitly laid out. In an introduction written in 1910, he clearly states that by talking about "memory" he intends to discuss "the reality of spirit" and "the reality of matter," that is, those of "body" and "mind" or "soul" in their mutual entanglement. Although the approach is dualistic, his intention is to break through the dialectically related philosophical schools of realism or ma terialism (focusing on the thing), and dogmatism or idealism (focusing on the representation), by pushing dualism (thing versus representation) to an ex treme (Bergson 1896/2004, 236). Bergson affirms that "the theoretical difficulties which have always beset dualism" (vii) are owed to the conceptu alization of "matter" put forward by the respective philosophical traditions. Bergson suggests a different treatment of matter through memory; hence the title of his work. The treatment consists of the suggestion "to leave matter half way between the place to which Descartes had driven it and that to which Berkeley drew it back—to leave it, in fact, where it is seen by common sense" (x). In this quotation Rene Descartes comes to exemplify thingification, and Bishop George Berkeley its opposite: representationalism. This is assuredly a slightly un-Bergsonian statement when we take into account his apt observa tion that "divergences are striking between the schools, that is to say, in short, between the groups of disciples formed around certain of the great masters. But would one find them as clear-cut between the masters themselves?" (Berg son 1934/2007, 168; compare 92ff.) and that common sense is habitual and</page><page sequence="9">30 Hypatia utilitarianist by nature, although his claim about the preferred treatment of matter is nevertheless important. Note that Bergson also explicitly uses "half way" to make sure that we are not to stop halfway when it comes to dualisms (e.g., Bergson 1907/1998, 355; 1934/2007, 30). We do not qualitatively shift dualistically related schools of thought nor do we break through false opposi tions between concepts when we do not push the dualism to an extreme and stop halfway. In this section, I tap into a different use of "halfway" that is also to be found in the work of Bergson: a halfway that alludes to "a hyphen, a con necting link" (Bergson 1896/2004, 196; 1907/1998, 22) constituting past present-future, but also the material-semiotic, and space-time, for instance (see also Hill 2008a). Bergson wants to make intuition the method of philosophy, or, more pre cisely, metaphysics. A philosophy built on intelligence, on understanding, built along the lines of criticism, cannot get out of where we already are: our mind has been colonized by what Bergson calls "spatialized time," which is represen tationalism, and cannot actually reach the life of the mind or consciousness, the flux of life or reality. The sciences are lined up with a philosophy structured by the critical mind, which "aims above all at making us masters of matter" (Bergson 1934/2007, 25). Bergson wants to shift metaphysics, yet he wants to keep the connection between metaphysics and science, even though their par allel lives will be structured differently when the intuitive method is installed, when matter is being left halfway by philosophers. Leaving matter halfway consists of the following: we consider matter before the dissociation which idealism and realism [as well as materialism and dogmatism] have brought about between its existence and its appearance. (Bergson 1896/ 2004, viii-ix) We look at matter precisely insofar as we want to tackle "the problem of the relation between soul and body" (x), and as it is memory that we have to deal with then, we look at "the intersection of mind and matter" (xii), because that is what memory is. In fact, matter, for Bergson, becomes "an aggregate of 'images'" whereby images are more than representations and less than things (vii). They are what we find halfway, when we traverse thingification on the one hand and representationalism on the other. Bergson goes as far as defining "[t]hat which is given" as "the totality of the images of the material world, with the totality of their internal elements" (30). Olkowski formulates their work ings neatly: All [images] function without ever producing a single represen tation of the material universe. Rather, external images influence the "body" image by transmitting movement to it.</page><page sequence="10">Iris van der Tuin 31 The body image responds by bringing about changes in its sur rounding images and giving back movement to them, choosing how it returns what it receives. (Olkowski 1999, 96) The material universe, for Bergson, is the totality of images. Bergson, in other words, asserts that philosophers working according to the intuitive method are, in the formula of Barad borrowed from a poem by Alice Fulton, "meet[ing] the universe halfway" (Barad 1996, 161; 2007, 39). He proposes to leave matter halfway, asserting that matter is an aggregate of images, and that the universe is made up of the totality of images. When matter is left halfway, the universe is met halfway. In the philosophy-physics of Barad, "[k]nowledges are not innocent representations, but intra-actions of nature-cultures: knowledge is about meeting the universe halfway" (Barad 1996, 189). What Bergson has already taught us (we look at the intersection of mind and matter) as well as his use of hyphens, similar to Barad's, makes the concept of intra-action very clear, and, vice versa, Barad's concepts can make Bergson's lessons stronger (intersection is suggestive as it assumes two preexisting elements and two unilinear tracks) (compare Cohen 1999, 25). Bergson's traversing of thingification and representationalism, that is, Bergson's positioning of these habits, also shows how Hill has confused Bergson's description of spatialized time, a mode of thinking about matter as cribed to the critical scholar/philosopher, with his own position. For Bergson, matter is always already entwined in durational monism. No traces of objectify ing matter—making matter feminine—can be found in his work. Working on physics, and on the way in which this field is structured by the seemingly irresolvable dualism between light as wave and light as particle, Ba rad comes up with an onto-epistemology according to which knower, known, and laboratory instrument act and come into being simultaneously, in their mutual entanglement. None of the three has the definitive say in the coming into being of the eventual knowledge claim; they are co-constitutive, and all of them, including the known that is haunted by being objectified and thus fem inized, are agential. Therefore, Barad does not reside among realists (giving the known the definitive say) or among the relativists (ascribing the final say to the knowers). Barad, following Niels Bohr, whose work is as "cross-sectional" (Mullarkey 1999, 2, 8) as the philosophy of Bergson, brings the laboratory in strument into the picture so as to show that neither knower nor known, neither subject nor object, and neither culture nor nature, preexists. Barad looks at how these seeming poles of seeming dualisms intra'act, giving account of the coming into being of the two poles that cannot be accounted for by an interactive take "presuming] the prior existence of independent entities/relata" (Barad 2003, 815). In Barad's work, "knowledge comes from the 'between' of nature-culture, object-subject, matter-meaning" (Barad 1996, 188). What then is matter for Barad? And what is meaning?</page><page sequence="11">32 Hypatia Barad defines matter "like meaning" as "always already an ongoing historic ity" (Barad 2003, 821). Let me divide remarks regarding this definition in two. First, I used the term "material-semiotic" above, and now it is time to discuss the notion, which was introduced to feminist philosophy by Haraway (Har away 1988, 595). The material-semiotic, or "material-discursive," entails the idea that matter envelops meaning, and meaning matter. The gap, and conse quently the unilinear, fixed relation, that is supposed to exist between signifier and signified, between word and thing, albeit that it is not unambiguously pro posed as such by Ferdinand de Saussure (see Kirby 1997), plagues contemporary cultural theories as well as the natural sciences. The work of Bergson and Barad, among others and when read diffractively, can be put to work to end this academic habit, which is a scholarly and philosophical habit that taps into in telligence as opposed to intuition, as Bergson would have it. This is where the objectified, feminized known is created, alongside the authoritative, masculini zed knower. Feminist standpoint theory and identity politics more broadly have not been able to bring this habit to an end. Barad and Bergson, however, both do so. Second, Barad's definition provides room for matter's historicity. Matter is all too often, in cultural theories as well as in the natural sciences, not supposed to have a history, let alone to influence that history or to have a history that is in fact duration. Matter is supposed to be unhistorical, or to exist outside history. It was with the coming into being of (feminist) science studies that matter was given its history, although Bergson and the (feminist) minor tradition(s) sur rounding and embracing his work can be said to have given it that already. The assumption of mute matter is an assumption much commented on by feminists, who, in divergent ways, have wanted to inscribe feminized matter, and women per se, into history. How is matter material-semiotic and durational? Life and reality as movement or flux, as a creative evolution, are structured by duration rather than spatialized time. Spatialized time is a representationalism, a predetermined way of looking at things. This conception of time, which ap pears as forward-looking, although it is structured by what Bergson calls a "retrograde movement" (Bergson 1934/2007, 11), structures science when it is not complemented by an intuitive metaphysics. In a similar way, it structures history (and the history of philosophy). Science as brought to the fore by Barad via a different, agential take on it, and the philosophy asserted by Bergson by suggesting intuition instead of intelligence, parallel each other by inserting du ration into what is supposedly unhistorical or historical: matter.5 Bergson says: the difficulty arises from this, that we represent statistically ready-made material particles juxtaposed to one another, and, also statistically, an external cause which plasters upon them a skillfully contrived organization. In reality, life is a movement, materiality is the inverse movement, and each of these two</page><page sequence="12">Iris van der Tuin 33 movements is simple, the matter which forms a world being an undivided flux, and undivided also the life that runs through it, cutting out in it living beings all along its track. Of these two currents the second runs counter to the first, but the first ob tains, all the same, something from the second. There results between them a modus vivendi, which is organization. (Bergson 1907/1998, 249-50) A diffractive reading, focusing on Barad's emphasis on entanglement and intra-action, prevents us from reading the two currents as a linear or twin-track system, while Bergson can specify Barad's historicity, inserted into matter, his toricity being, after all, a term with spatialized connotations. The specification being: Matter thus resolves itself into numberless vibrations, all linked together in uninterrupted continuity, all bound up with each other, and traveling in every direction like shivers through an immense body. ... there are, in a sense, multiple objects ... at the same time that our actual and so to speak instantaneous perception effects this division of matter into independent objects, our memory solidifies into sensible qualities the contin uous flow of things. It prolongs the past into the present, because our action will dispose of the future in the exact pro portion in which our perception, enlarged by memory, has contracted the past. To reply, to an action received, by an im mediate reaction which adopts the rhythm of the first and continues it in the same duration, to be in the present and in a present which is always beginning again,—this is the funda mental law of matter: herein consists necessity. (Bergson 1896/ 2004, 276-79; emphasis in original) Thus, when the universe is made up of (an aggregate of) images of matter or bodies, and when historicity, or better duration, is inserted into matter (as it always is already inserted into spirit), a new kind of materialism is put forth. With it, we have an eye for duration, for a temporality that is not spatialized. It is Bergsonian duration, that "what differs from itself' (Deleuze 1956/2002, 37; emphasis in original), that specifies agential matter. Philosophy and Science as Complementary We have seen that Bergson works on metaphysics and Barad on science (phys ics). Bergson wants metaphysics and science to complement each other. Barad, in conformity with Bergson, states that setting up a dualism between the two,</page><page sequence="13">34 Hypatia privileging one or the other, will result only in the underprivileged coming back with a vengeance (Barad 2003, 812, n. 14). The way in which Barad's philosophy-physics complements Bergson's metaphysics instantiates an affir mative relation between the two, wherein negation, in line with the philosophy of Bergson, does not play a role, and wherein Bergson, in line with the methodology of Grosz, is not featured as a master nor as a phallocentric philosopher that feminists need dualistically to distance themselves from (an inescapably unsuccessful move). How does Barad's onto-epistemological take on physics instantiate and strengthen Bergson's intuitive metaphysics, which is supposed to be complementary with science? And how does Bergson's intuitive metaphysics affect Barad's onto-epistemology? In other words, how can the diffractive reading install an onto-epistemology of duration? Let me state be forehand that complementarity means that metaphysics and science have an equal value, and that, via their respective, complementary methods, "both can touch the bottom of reality" (Bergson 1934/2007, 25; compare 50). Grosz un derlines this when she states that, by engaging with questions of time, science and philosophy engage themselves with ontology, which, for science, means that it "participates in metaphysics, where it encroaches on the durational questions that occupy philosophy" (Grosz 2004, 247). In the work of Bergson, the body as an image—or "my body"—is positioned at the center, even though his philosophy, also in this respect, is clean of all traces of Kantianism: we may speak of the body as an ever advancing boundary be tween the future and the past, as a pointed end, which our past is continually driving forward into our future. Whereas my body, taken at a single moment, is but a conductor interposed between the objects which influence it and those on which it acts, it is, on the other hand, when replaced in the flux of time, always situated at the very point where my past expires in a deed. (Bergson 1896/2004, 88) The body here ceases to be the living being directed toward utilitarianism (which is how the scientific, critical mind conceptualizes it); Bergson sees "the life of the body just where it really is, on the road that leads to the life of the spirit" (Bergson 1907/1998, 269). The moment we position ourselves thus, as philosophers, we need no longer explain memory as a "special faculty whose role is to retain quantities of past in order to pour it into the present" because "[t]he past preserves itself automatically" (Bergson 1934/2007, 128). The body, or the brain for that matter, is not imbued with a predetermined special func tion. It is not an apparatus in that sense: "The body is a centre of action and not a house of representation" (Ansell-Pearson 2007, xx). It is where movement happens, where the flux takes place, where we, as it were, strive toward reaching</page><page sequence="14">Iris van der Tuin 35 pure duration (Bergson 1907/1998, 199-200). Reading this strong anti-hu manism or anti-anthropomorphism according to which "[m]ind or life are not special substances, different in nature to matter [,but r]ather mind or life par take of and live in and as matter" (Grosz 2000, 219-20) through the work of Barad, who comments on the position ascribed to the scientist by Bohr, can help us specify what the former means when she proposes "a way of interpreting quantum physics that builds on Bohr's interpretation while removing its hu manist elements" (Barad 2007, 248). Defining the body as a conductor (see also Bergson 1896/2004, 86), however, is slightly suggestive in this context. The body as a conductor, as a medium, seems to be in between before and after, interacting with what surrounds it, whereas movement and flux are undivid able, and there is progressive duration and intra-action instead, according to an intuitive metaphysics: the body is "the materiality of existence and the bound ary between duration and matter" (Olkowski 1999, 111). Bergson's take on "my body," then, can in turn be made more precise, that is, less susceptible to division, when we look at Barad's "apparatus," and conceptualize the Bergson ian body along these lines. Bergson's emphasis on undividability and flux, in turn, can help us grasp Barad's scientific apparatus and its specific temporality better. I will do this by demonstrating how Bergson's intuition is onto-epi stemological and Barad's onto-epistemology intuitive. Bergson describes the physical act of measurement as a conventional exer cise alluding to the critical mind, imposed on a nature that "does not measure, nor does it count" (Bergson 1907/1998, 218). While affirming these measure ment procedures as they capitalize on the fact that materiality and intellectuality are "of the same nature and having been produced in the same way" (219), he simultaneously works toward shifting this conventionality, a shift that is made precise in the work of Barad. Bergson's move toward a Ba radian take on the (scientific) apparatus can be made explicit via his discussion of the film camera or cinematograph. Bergson states that "the mechanism of our ordinary knowledge is of a cinematographical kind" (Bergson 1907/1998, 306; em phasis in original), which is to say that we take snapshots of a flowing reality that are then strung together in order to set ourselves to an understanding of movement. In his famous essay "Introduction to Metaphysics" Bergson claims that this is an illegitimate move, predicated on spatialized time, with which we will never approach true movement or the flow of duration (Bergson 1934/ 2007). Bergson not only suggests the camera as a perfect metaphor for the crit ical mind, he also shifts our take on it for it to become a metaphor that works for the philosophical mind, for a take on knowledge that works for an intuitive metaphysics. Here, wholly in line with Barad as we will shortly see, Bergson suggests that we look for movement not in the strung together snapshots on the film that go into the cinematograph, but put the latter itself at center stage, like my body, which makes us see that "[t]he movement does indeed exist here; it is</page><page sequence="15">36 Hypatia in the apparatus" (Bergson 1907/1998, 305; compare 1934/2007, 45). It is pre cisely in the unrolling act itself, which is durational, that movement is to be found: "it is, of course, understood that what is projected on this screen, over and above these immobile views themselves [the snapshots on the film], is the movement within the projector" (Bergson 1934/2007, 217, n. 1), just like there is movement in the body when we restlessly seek to reconstitute movement when following our habit of spatializing time (Douglass 1999, 212). The rep resentationalism effected by the intellect and materialized in the camera provides "a camouflage that 'glides over' the reality underneath" (213), the re ality of the body or of the camera itself. Here we indeed find a strong connection with the complementarity thesis of Bohr that so much inspired Barad when setting up her onto-epistemology:6 movement is to be found when "grasping it in the aggregate" and not when we, habitually and intellectually, are seduced "to divide up the film image by image" (Bergson 1934/2007, 7). It is indeed the case here, as Grosz comments on Maurice Merleau-Ponty's read ing of Bergson, that there is a "direct equation of the epistemological with the ontological, collapsing our knowledge of the thing with its being" (Grosz 2005, 123). Bergson's shifted take on the cinematograph,7 no longer influenced by spatialization, by thingification and representationalism, is onto-epistemologi cal (compare Bergson 1907/1998, 231). We do not need, as Olkowski does (Olkowski 1999, 135ff.), to move beyond Bergson and toward Deleuze to make this point.8 The intuitive method now can be said to be an onto-epistemology. Onto-epistemologies, on the other hand, can be said to be intuitive. Barad is clear about the role of apparatuses in the different metaphysics she considers necessary for us to come up with. She works with Bohr, who in his ontology has shifted the atomist metaphysics of Sir Isaac Newton, and who, epistemologi cally, has broken through the gap Descartes assumed to exist between subject and object, knower and known (Barad 2003, 813). Onto-epistemology is intuitive because it starts from the simple and undivided (entanglement and intra-action), while allowing for the cutting up of this flux or flow in a second instance by the traditional, Newtonian scientist. It thus subscribes to Bergson's claim that one can move from intuition to intelligence, and not from intelli gence (snapshots) to intuition (flowing reality) (Bergson 1934/2007, 152). Similarly to Bergson, Bohr shifts the role of language, but he also shifts our take on measurement: "Language does not represent states of affairs, and measure ments do not represent measurement-independent states of being" (Barad 2003, 813). We have already seen with Bergson that it is not only the gap be tween the word and the state (or thing) that we have to shift, it is also the idea of a state of affairs, or of a state of being as such, as if it were measurable along the lines of spatialized time, that we have to shift. Measurement "is an instance where matter and meaning meet in a very literal sense" (Barad 1996, 166). This is surely not the conventional take on measurement Bergson affirmed as fully</page><page sequence="16">Iris van der Tuin 37 humanist; measurement instruments also play a role, and even so-called objects are agential. Light can be said to be a particle only when a specific measure ment device is used, and it really acts like a wave when a different device is used. Barad defines apparatuses as "phenomena" (Barad 2003, 816), and "phe nomena are ontologically primitive relations—relations without preexisting relata" (815). Capitalizing on the notion of intra-action, or rather materializing it, Barad thus shows how a new metaphysics perceives knower, known, and measurement device as intrinsically bound up with one another in such a way that their so-called function is not predetermined nor are the boundaries between them (816). In phenomena, thus with apparatuses, "relata-within phenomena emerge through specific intra-actions. Crucially then, intra actions enact agential separability—the local condition of exteriority-within phenomena" (815; emphasis in original). Everything being in flux, the world being becoming, apparatuses, like the Bergsonian bodies, act and constitute cuts in this flow. This is how I read Bergson when he states that "[t]he systems marked off by science endure only because they are bound up inseparably with the rest of the universe" (Bergson 1907/1998, 11; emphasis in original). In a metaphysical moment, then, Barad states that "[rjeality is not composed of things-in-themselves [thingification] or things-behind-phenomena [represen tationalism] but 'things'-in-phenomena" (Barad 2003, 817). What we have here, very much in line with Bergson, is dynamism, an "ongoing flow of agency" (817), and it is, in Barad's terms, through "this processual historicity" (817-18) that "[t]emporality and spatiality emerge" (817), that human and non-human bodies "come to matter" (823). The fact that cuts, agential ones that is, are involved makes Barad also name her metaphysics an ethico-onto epistemology (Barad 2007, 409, n. 10). Which cuts are made, when, and for whom? Here a new materialist take on, for instance, sexual difference is effected: matter is not feminine, but can be made feminine by the traditional scientist or critical philosopher, and it can influence its de-naturalization. Looking at the complementarity of Bergson's "my body" and Barad's appa ratus as a phenomenon will, for starters, undo the suggestive nature of Bergson's conceptualization of my body as a conductor between x and y. My body is the instrument of an intuitive metaphysics, because it functions entangled with flows of matter and meaning. In addition, Barad says that not only the non linear and non-spatial links between past, present, and future come to matter in the reality that is always already in flux or movement. Bodies also come to matter in such a way. When phenomena, with Barad, are ontologically prim itive, we cannot say that my body is a fully fledged starting-point for an intuitive metaphysics, that it stands on its own and is always already there (see Hill 2008a, 129). My body, as an apparatus, comes to matter as well. Here we find the breakthrough of the God trick as well as the (multiple) standpoint(s) of feminist standpoint theory and identity politics.</page><page sequence="17">38 Hypatia In Creative Evolution, Bergson states that "[f]rom our first glance at the world, before we even make our bodies in it, we distinguish qualities" (Bergson 1907/1998, 300; emphasis in original). Qualities are in movement and change constantly, even though the critical, scientific mind we have familiarized our selves with works with them as cut up in (successive) states. Bergson claims: Now, in the continuity of sensible qualities we mark off the boundaries of bodies. Each of these bodies really changes at ev ery moment. ... But, even if we regard the quality as a stable state, the body is still unstable in that it changes qualities with out ceasing. The body pre-eminently ... is the living body; it is, moreover, for it that we cut out the others within the whole. (302) After this fragment, Bergson discusses two other representations (forms of essences and acts), which he also both affirms (this is what the critical, scien tific mind does) and discards (it is not how the philosophical mind preferably goes about it). What we see in the work of Barad is that she develops, with Bohr, a take on science (otherwise colonized by the critical mind) that qual itatively shifts all kinds of well-known, dialectically related ontologies and epistemologies. The fact that she calls for a new metaphysics in her work sug gests an even more thoroughgoing step, one that, reading Barad's work through Bergson, works toward metaphysics or philosophy and science complementing each other, for instance owing to the simple fact that they "commune in ex perience" (Bergson 1934/2007, 31) or "meet in intuition" (162). In Matter and Memory, Bergson makes clear that "the turn of experience" indeed involves a certain return, or revolutionization of the common sense, as I suggested at the beginning of this article, because it involves a move away from knowledge "relative to the fundamental structure of our mind" and "only to its superficial and acquired habits, to the contingent form which it derives from our bodily functions and from our lower needs" (Bergson 1896/2004, 241; emphasis in original). This turn is "illuminating the passage from the immediate to the use ful" (241; emphasis in original), and marks the link between philosophy and, at least, mathematics (242). Barad makes clear how this complementing works when she discusses local, agential resolutions in phenomena, rather than resolutions that have an air of full causal fixity, of thingification or represen tationalism. Both Bergson and Barad affirm that "[ojbjects are boundary projects" (Haraway 1988, 595). Barad's ethics, or, more broadly, her feminism, finds its apotheosis in her take on objects as boundary projects, in the "which cuts are made, when, and for whom?" and, following the diffractive reading, we find that a similar ethics is at work in Bergson. We thus no longer have to critique Bergson for his assumed phallocentrism; despite the "proof' of Berg son's phallocentrism found by Hill, an affirmative feminist philosophy, one that</page><page sequence="18">Iris van der Tuin 39 does not simply celebrate the work, can specify and strengthen the philosophy so as to make it work for feminism and sexual difference theory. Although Hill states that duration is inserted into matter and the dualism between active life and passive matter is thus pushed, she also states that it is not pushed to an extreme owing to a residual sexed hierarchy. I have shown, reading Bergson and Barad through each other, that dualism is pushed to an extreme, that is, to a feminist ethics. An onto-epistemology of duration allows us to conceptualize matter-made-feminine as a preexisting concept, which is an invention of the critical, scientific mind, that is, a spatializing intervention in creative evolu tion. The different, Bergson ian-Baradian metaphysics, the starting point of which is my body as an apparatus, allows us to think life and matter as entan gled, durational, and agential, which is a reality that is to be grasped with fluid, moving concepts. Notes I would like to thank Rick Dolphijn, the participants in the Contemporary Cultural Theory seminar at Utrecht University, Gaston Franssen, and the two anonymous ref erees from Hypatia for their insightful comments, and Piet Van de Kar for his immediate reaction. Karen Barad uses the phrase "a different starting point, a different metaphysics" in her article "Posthumanist performativity: Toward an understanding of how matter comes to matter" (Barad 2003, 812) in order to communicate the need for an epistemic shift away from representationalism and thingification. Diffractively speaking, the phrase also conveys the core of the philosophy of Henri Bergson. 1. Kember 2006 is one of the few articles that talks about Bergson and Barad. Kember, however, discusses the scholars successively, whereas I attempt to make them speak to each other. Richard A. Cohen, in his contribution to The New Bergson, offers a singular, diffractive reading of Bergson and Maurice Merleau-Ponty without, however, using the term or talking about the benefits of the reading strategy (Cohen 1999, 27 28). 2. Barad differentiates between "Cartesian cuts"—cuts that suggest inherent dis tinctions between, for instance, objects and subjects of inquiry—and "agential" ones— local cuts that materialize within the becoming of the world. I will discuss the latter cuts below. 3. Bergson uses "partial realism" in a letter to John Dewey dated January 3, 1913, stating that what he intended to do in Matter and Memory is to traverse realism and idealism (see Mullarkey 1999, 86). 4. In an interview, Rick Dolphijn and I had with Barad at the 7th European Fem inist Research Conference on June 6, 2009, at Utrecht University, Barad referred to the work of Jacques Derrida when affirming a non-linear temporality. Her reading came very close to Bergsonian duration.</page><page sequence="19">40 Hypatia 5. I borrow the formulation "the insertion of duration into matter" from Grosz 2005, 111. 6. Bohr is not featured in Bergson's oeuvre. The latter does, however, apart from his reading of Albert Einstein as furthering spatialized time, affirm recent developments in physics in The Creative Mind, and is explicit about Alfred North Whitehead's take on matter in movement (Bergson 1934/2007, 56, 220-21, n. 12). In addition, Timothy S. Murphy claims that "Bohr's refutation of determinism in the quantum realm repeats key aspects of Bergson's defence of free will as the impossibility breaking up a process of movement or change in duration" (Murphy 1999, 73). Murphy also claims that more contemporary refutations of Einstein's relativity (e.g., by David Bohm) affirm both Bohr's complementarity thesis and Bergson's/Deleuze's duration, because both allow for a range of actualizations of time as virtual multiplicity, for instance in different exper imental settings (Murphy 1999, 73-77). 7. Two comments must be made here. First, the shifted cinematograph is not per feet as a metaphor, because it can be switched on and off, and works with a calculable number of images (Bergson 1934/2007, 128-29). In addition, Bergson discusses only the (experience of) gaps between the snapshots and not the spatialization of 3D projected as 2D (Douglass 1999, 215). Second, my reading of Bergson shifting the metaphor, thus working toward looking at the moving cinematograph itself instead of the string of im mobile snapshots, complements a shift provoked by Deleuze, who, in Cinema 1: The Movement-Image from 1983, complements Bergson by stating that he, for obvious rea sons, looked only at (the experience of watching) early film, which, indeed, works according to the stringing of shots and evokes the bodily restlessness mentioned (Dou glass 1999, 214). Deleuze's movement-image is, however, only in the process of becoming institutionalized, that is, our experience of film is still mostly one of spatial ization (216-17; compare Smelik 2009). 8. Olkowski pleads the need to move beyond Bergson because Bergson argues, as I mentioned previously, that "immediate intuition and discursive thought are one in concrete reality." According to Olkowski, this does not push our ontology far enough, that is, toward an "ontology of becoming, the being of becoming," because we remain hindered by intellect, by utilitarianism (Olkowski 1999, 133).
