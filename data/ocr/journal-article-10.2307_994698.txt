<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE TEST-STUDY METHOD VERSUS THE STUDY-TEST METHOD IN SPELLING JOHN H. KINGSLEY School No. 24, Albany, New York There was a time when, because of lack of scientific data, school people believed that proficiency in spelling was dependent on the time given the subject in the daily program and that such proficiency was measured by the ability to spell such words as phthisis, anthropomorphism, schismatic, etc. By these standards, our ancestors of the spelling-school days far outclassed the boys and girls of today. A new social condition, however, makes it necessary to conserve the time of children, and scientific research has estab- lished the relative importance of words on the basis of their practical use. This paper attempts to direct attention to the great waste of time which results from the method still commonly used in teaching spelling, namely, the study-test method, and to explain a plan which has as its ideals, first, the saving of 90o per cent of the time now spent in study; second, the revival of life and interest in the spelling period; and, finally, general improvement in spelling ability. Most school programs provide for a daily study period for spelling of at least fifteen minutes in length. Where such time is not provided, the pupils are required to take their spellers home. Under the plan of study in school, all of the pupils study all of the words of the lesson under the direction of the teacher. In schools suffering from the "home-study disease," the teacher assigns the lesson and trusts the fathers and mothers to do the highly technical, professional teaching. The result in either case is that the good, conscientious pupils spend too much time, and the others too little time, on the task. Either plan is inefficient, destroying interest, incentive, and advancement in good and poor alike. The test-study method is the plan by which the pupils study only those words which they cannot spell. They have the recitation 126</page><page sequence="2">THE TEST-STUDY METHOD IN SPELLING 127 first and the study period afterward. When the plan is carried to the extreme as a time-saver, those pupils who have superior scores for a week, a month, or a term, are excused from the whole spelling exercise for a like period. This saves time, not only for the pupil, but for the teacher, concentrating the teacher's efforts where most needed. There are pupils in any grade above the fourth who can spell, without study, practically every word in the spelling assignment of the next grade higher. Why should they study for a year that which they already know? The observations here recorded are based on work with three texts; they cover a period of two years of careful analysis in Grades V to VIII in two schools, with occasional class averages from four other schools. On such a limited foundation, generalizations would be dangerous, but the facts are interesting. Is it true that a boy can actually get a higher mark without study than he gets after the mechanical study of a spelling lesson? An experiment of this kind leads one to wonder why we follow old devices without proof of their value. In October, 1921, a sixth-grade teacher, in desperation over the low average of her spelling marks, promised to try the test-study method for one month. The results were more than surprising; they were almost unbelievable. Half of the pupils rarely had any lesson to prepare, and no one ever had to prepare the whole lesson. The approach to the period was delightful. The better spellers were keen to see if there were any words that they could not spell, and the others were glad to try to surpass their record of the previous day and thereby reduce their study assignment. Never before had they really enjoyed the spelling period. In the month they moved from sixth--lowest-place in daily class average to third place and showed the largest percentage of gain of any grade in the school. At the end of the month the eighth grade and one of the two seventh grades joined the sixth grade in trying the scheme. A fifth grade and a seventh grade were kept at the old plan to act as checks on the results of the other grades. The following year, three grades in another school, each using different texts, one grade with no text in the pupils' hands, joined in the experiment with the same remarkable results in every particular.</page><page sequence="3">128 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL [October The average class distributions, based on the average number of words misspelled in daily recitation for a year or more, are shown in Table I. The records cover three to six classes of each grade about equally divided between the test-study method (a) and the study-test method (b). The results show some slight advantage in favor of the new method in daily records, while they emphatically indicate that the time spent in class study periods was wasted.

Roughly grouping the totals for the test-study method, one finds that 55 per cent of the pupils missed no words; 25 per cent missed one word; io per cent missed two words; 5 per cent missed three words; i per cent missed four words; and i per cent missed five words. To ask these pupils to spend a fifteen-minute study period on the lesson, before testing, would be to waste nearly 95 per cent of the time and, in some cases, actually to reduce the spelling ability. For a class of thirty, figured as a business manager keeps time, 425 minutes of the aggregate 450 made no return. The question of actual comparative achievement as a final test of the two spelling methods is not answered by the daily records tabulated. Variations in texts, methods of procedure in study and recitation, and differences between teachers and grades introduce a number of elements of unreliability. To secure a more accurate estimate of achievement, Ayres Measuring Scale for Ability in Spelling was used for monthly tests. Table II shows the results. As in Table I, the averages of the classes using the test-study plan are in the (a) columns; the averages of the classes using the study-</page><page sequence="4">19231 THE TEST-STUDY METHOD IN SPELLING 129 test plan are in the (b) columns. In some cases classes changed from the old plan to the new plan. The words selected for the test, twenty each time, were of standard difficulty, giving 79 per cent as the class average. It would have been much better to have used 69 per cent as the standard.

Standardized tests make possible a study of methods through the accurate measurement of accomplishment. Such measure- ment is true in its findings; eliminates some time-honored, time- wasting classroom practices; and appeals to teachers and school executives.</page></plain_text>
