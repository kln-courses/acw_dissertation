<plain_text><page sequence="1">THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE From the Artificial to the Art: A Short Introduction to a Theory and Its Applications Massimo Negrotti TWO SOULS OF TECHNOLOGY Artificial Intelligence (AI) is openly devoted to reproducing natural phenomena that characterize the human mind/brain system in projects that range from natural language under- standing programs to expert systems. However, since the 1980s, AI projects have clearly shown the impossibility of arti- ficially rebuilding the human mind as such. Instead, AI has been successful at reproducing [1] some specific functions of the mind, particularly formal reasoning, pattern matching and the like. On the other hand, both supporters and detrac- tors of AI have focused almost exclusively on the nature of human intelligence rather than on the nature of the artificial. Suffice it to say that throughout the history of human tech- nology and art, the term "artificial" has been utilized to dis- tinguish between attempts to reproduce nature and attempts to build technological objects that have no referent in the natural world. In fact, the concept of "artificial" (a term whose use dates back at least to the Middle Ages), has some deep meaning in itself and in its implications. Thus, the main questions a theory of the artificial should answer are: * What are the common denominators between the perspectiva artificialis of Leon Battista Alberti and Piero della Francesca [2] and today's AI; between Francis Bacon's "ar- tificial rainbow" [3] and Charles Baudelaire's "artificial paradises" [4]; or between the "artificial smell" designed by Sony Corporation [5] and Langton's "artificial life" [6]? * What is the anthropological significance of the attempts by Jacques de Vaucanson and other eighteenth-century designers to build automata [7] and other machines that were able to mimic human or animal behavior in view of current research on biomaterials and so-called "bio-artifi- cial" devices [8]? * What comprises the typical development-from initial idea to realization-of an artificial object, process or machine? When can we properly say that something is artificial? It seems that a definition of the artificial comes logically from the premise that humanity is able to perform two differ- ent technological roles: that of inventing something that does not exist in the natural world and that of reproducing some- thing that does. Thus, we can reasonably define as "conven- tional technology" that which-on the basis of scientific knowledge of both the physical world and technology-pro- duces unique objects or machines with the explicit aim of controlling nature rather than of imitating or reproducing it. On the contrary, I shall define as "artificial technology" ABSTRACT The author presents the idea that all human attempts to repro- duce natural objects ("exemplars") or their functions-that is, to build artificial objects or processes- unavoidably result in a transfigura- tion of the exemplars. After intro- ducing the main concepts of a theory of the artificial, the author . ,_ ., _ L ., _ _ . .___ that which evinces or even explic- extenas tne neory to communica- itly declares its intention to re- tion and the arts, both of which provide compelling examples of produce something existing in the generation of artificial objects nature by means of materials and or processes.

Simon [9], J. Monod [10], a failure of the reproduction pro- A. Karlqvist [11] and other re- cess but, rather, the true objective searchers who have approached of the artist. this theme in various contexts seem to conceive of the artificial as something produced by people that differs from the natural (for instance, according to Monod, in its formal, geometrical aspect [12]). If we fol- low such an approach, then no common denominator ap- pears necessary to distinguish the artificial from the human- made and, therefore, "artificial" becomes merely a synonym for "human-made" or "technological." On the contrary, it seems reasonable to maintain that something is artificial only as compared to something else. This explains why nobody speaks of "artificial drills" or "arti- ficial television sets" but, rather, of "artificial skin" or "artifi- cial flowers." The existence of artificial objects demonstrates that human beings, like many other animals, have an instinct to imitate that which exists in nature; this feature has been remarked upon by many thinkers, from Aristotle to G. Tarde, who in 1890 dedi- cated his main sociological book, The Laws of Imitations [13], to the subject. The main difference between animals and humans in this paradigm lies in the ability of the latter to make conven- tional technology, i.e. to invent objects that are radically new in that they do not already appear as such in the natural world. I shall hereinafter designate as "artificialists" those people (whether engineers or artists, musicians or lay people) who try to reproduce something natural that originates in either the internal or external world. THE GENESIS OF THE ARTIFICIAL: EXEMPLARS AND ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCES Conceptually, the common basis of any artificial object is the natural reference object, or "exemplar," from which it draws Massimo Negrotti (educator), Istituto Metodologico Economico Statistico-Laboratory for the Culture of the Artificial, University of Urbino, Via Saffi, 15 1-61029 Urbino, Italy.

An exemplar can come just as easily from external reality as it can from an original vision of the hu- man mind; it can even be the result of a collective cultural construction, such as the devil as rendered in Medieval art. An exemplar can be a biological organ, such as the heart, or a landscape, which might be reproduced by means of a plas- tic model for architectural use. Conceptualizing further, the exemplar can be described on the basis of features or functions-which I shall call "essential performances"-that unambiguously in- dividuate the exemplar. In fact, artificialists often try to directly repro- duce essential performances rather than exemplars themselves. This can be seen, for instance, in the classical, symbolic AI field [14] when designers adopt the "functional equivalence" principle, ac- cording to which AI's target is not the structure of the mind but its functions. All artificialists try, by definition, to re- produce an exemplar and/or its essential performance-respiration, blood circu- lation, vision and so on-by adopting simulated materials and/or processes but not, necessarily, structural similarities. Nevertheless, in many fields a high de- gree of structural similarity between arti- ficial object and exemplar is a prerequi- site, as evinced by certain classes of artificial organs, architectural models, figurative painting, educational artificial systems (i.e. biology or medicine) and even by anthropomorphic robots or toys. The balance between the structure and the functions to be reproduced depends, therefore, on the final aims of the artificialist or, even, on the expectations of the public or the market. Regardless, artificialists clearly perceive the repro- duction of a natural exemplar as a whole-in terms of both structure and its performance-as an impossible aim, despite their dreams or tacit pretensions. In the eighteenth century, Jacques de Vaucanson wrote thus about his artificial drake: I do not pretend that this should be a perfect digestion, able to generate blood and nutritional particles in or- der to allow the survival of the animal. I only pretend to imitate the mechan- ics of this action in three points: in the swallowing of the wheat; in soaking, cooking or dissolving it; in allowing its going out, forcing it to visibly change its stuff [15]. Nearly 300 years later, the situation, in its logical aspects and constraints at least, remains, of course, unchanged, as shown in a case of an "artificial retina": In building a silicon retina, our pur- pose was not that of reproducing the human retina up to the last detail, but of getting a simplified version of it, containing the minimum of necessary structure in order to accomplish the biological function [16]. OBSERVATION LEVELS Conceived as experimental research, an investigation of the artificial immedi- ately bears an epistemological problem: if in order to reproduce an exemplar the artificialist first of all has to observe it, then we have to take into account the whole set of conditions within which the human observational process happens. Contemporary thought concerning this point holds that the observer is always constrained by the system to which he or she belongs [17] and by that system's rules. In short, the observational process involves the well-known dilemma of whether what we see is what we want to see or what actually exists. Either reality imprints on us its own features or we "construct" reality [18]. Regarding the design of an artificial object and the requisite observational process, the final result is always the same. Actually, people try to reproduce natural exemplars under the often tacit premise that reality clearly shows those features or functions they have selected. This holds true both for de Vaucanson's duck and for the intelligence observed and described by an AI group; and for the sky as seen both by Vincent van Gogh and by Johannes Kepler when he de- signed his machina mundi artificialis [19]. In the end, every person adopts cultur- ally or psychologically based standpoints, or observation levels, in an attempt to grasp reality. As such, observation levels always lack some degree of shared legiti- mization or hierarchy-a problem that often gives rise to real conflict and con- troversy. One need only consider the sci- entific attribution to electricity, during the nineteenth century, of a central role in several phenomenologies, including the sexual act [20]. Likewise, what the scientist sees also depends to some extent on personal preferences, or "bets" on reality. For ex- ample, Francois Bichat, the founder of histology, said in reference to the reli- ability of the observations made possible by the microscope that such instruments "seem to be of no special usefulness, be- cause when looking in the dark, every- one sees in their own way" [21]. As the physicist T. Regge pointed out, by selecting what I call an observation level "we force matter to choose a con- figuration among those that are avail- able" [22]. What the artificialist repro- duces is not, strictly speaking, the exemplar in itself, but a representation based on his or her observation level. This is the key to bridging technology and art: both paintings and machines are the result of the attempt to repro- duce natural objects according to indi- vidual or cultural (often scientific) se- lections, i.e. the configurations and functions that are more or less com- monly attributed to those objects. The more a representation is shared in the culture to which the artificialist be- longs, the more people will accept the reproduction attempt (Fig. 1). To sum up, a complete definition could read as follows: an artificial object is an object, built by humans with mate- rials and procedures different from those naturally occurring, that repro- duces the essential performance of an exemplar based on a more or less shared representation from a certain observation level. THE IMPOSSIBLE CHALLENGE OF SYNTHESIZING REALITY A reproduction of a flower would privilege as the essential performance at a macroscopic observation level ei- ther form, color, fragrance or struc- ture-but not all these elements at once, because their synthesis would require the analytical knowledge of the intimate relationships among them at all possible observation levels. Since analysis implies selection of ob- servation and representation levels- and analysis is, of course, the first step of scientific work-in scientific terms it is impossible to grasp reality as a whole. This is also a problem for artificialistic work, for example, for bio-engineering. A group of bio-engi- neers discuss a pragmatic solution to the difficult undertaking of creating artificial devices that can interact with an organism and are compatible with it at all biological levels: Until recently, most research in the field [of cell transplantation] has fo- cused on minimizing biological fluid and tissue interactions with bio- materials in an effort to prevent fibrous encapsulation from foreign-body reac- tion or clotting in blood that has con- tact with artificial devices. In short, most biomaterials research has focused on making the material invisible to the body [23]. 184 Negrotti, From the Artificial to the Art</page><page sequence="3">artificial + On the other hand, some ancient or recent popular gadgets, explicitly ori- ented towards fashion-such as dolls, clothes, cars, clocks or even jewelry- can simultaneously reproduce many functions on a merely allusive or superfi- cial level simply by amalgamating mul- tiple functions in the same object (i.e. including fragrance in a plastic rose). Thus, for example, Pliny the Elder re- ported that in a match between the two Greek painters Zeusi and Parrasio, Zeusi draws grapes which deceives the sparrows.... Parrasio draws a drapery which simulates so carefully a breadth of cloth, spread to cover a painting, that he cheated his competitor [24]. Similarly, Nicolas Negroponte has re- ported that when one of the first tele- conferencing systems was designed in the 1970s to improve United States gov- ernment emergency procedures, a mechanism was added to reinforce the realism of the message given by the model system: an animated plastic head representing a speaker, for instance, the President. The result was that the "video recordings generated in this way pro- vided so realistic a reproduction that an admiral told me that the 'talking heads' gave him nightmares" [25]. In a personal interview, Willem Kolff of Kolff Labs in Salt Lake City, Utah- one of the leading scientists who de- signed the first artificial kidney during the Second World War and, subse- quently, the artificial heart-acutely de- fined artificial organs as ways in which to "cheat nature" since they generate per- formances that the body has to accept as if from a natural organ [26]. But we should be aware that the un- avoidable selection process-of an obser- vation level, an exemplar or an essential performance-will cause transfiguration of the features and the behavior of the Fig. 1. The artificial is the result of the overlap between na- ture and conven- tional technology. The arrow pointing ~hnology ~ 1to the right indi- UhnologUy | cates that the artifi- cial develops with growing conven- tional technology, which pulls it fur- ther and further away from nature. exemplar once it is rebuilt as the artifi- cial (Fig. 2). THE REVENGE OF REALITY Part of the paradoxical but intrinsically unavoidable destiny of the artificial is that it must rely on conventional tech- nology. In fact, the technology of the ar- tificial does not consist of knowledge, techniques or tools that are intrinsically able to generate artificial objects; rather, the technology of the artificial re-orients conventional technological knowledge, techniques and tools towards the repro- duction of natural exemplars. The final result of the process of cre- ating the artificial becomes, therefore, the outcome not only of a multiple se- lective process but also of the adoption of materials and procedures different from those that constitute the exemplar. In fact, the multiple selection process is a sort of funnel process that, starting with the selection of only one observa- tion level, makes "visible" only one class of potential exemplars, cutting off the others. The selection process continues through the isolation of a specific exem- plar from its context, reducing once more what potentially can be taken into consideration. Eventually the process ends with the isolation-or the attribu- tion-of one essential performance of the exemplar, from the ones that the previous selection stages have allowed. When using material B rather than material A, we do not include in the fi- nal artificial object only those features Fig. 2. Genesis of the Artificial: the basic steps. This model describes the general process that leads to the artificial. The first two steps (selection of an observation level and genera- tion of mental representations) are common steps for all human activities, from daily life to art or science. The steps concerning the selection of an exemplar and of an essential perfor- mance belong to an advanced phase, one in which we decide to rationally define, conceptu- alize or model an object or event already observed and represented in our minds. To "define" means to isolate the exemplar from its background or context and then to select a unique, typical or essential performance. Both of these selections strongly depend on the selected observation level, our past experiences, preferences, values and also on the cul- ture to which we belong. These steps are also common to a wide series of daily, artistic or scientific activities, though they receive a special methodological formalization in science. The last two steps (the adoption of conventional technology and the actual building of something artificial) concern only those activities that-like technological artificialism, communication and the arts-openly aim at reproducing the exemplar and its essential performance according to some observation level. observation level representation representation exemplar essential performance Negrotti, From the Artificial to the Art 185 conventional technology artificial</page><page sequence="4">of B that appeared useful to us from a certain observation level for reproduc- ing an essential performance of an ex- emplar. We could call this phenomenon a sort of "inheritance principle," which refers to the fact that although we choose just one observation level, our actions or the materials we use will bring with them a number of unex- pected features that are independent of our analytical decisions. These features result from the complex relationships among all levels of actions or materials and the reality they meet. For instance, we may plan a holiday in some new place because we are interested in expe- riencing some of its known landscape features, but though the real experi- ence might be quite satisfying to our eyes, it may also be quite unacceptable to our ears or our noses. The "inherit- ance principle" ensures that by using material B, we include in the final ob- ject all of B's features, both its known and unknown characteristics and dispo- sitions. Subsequently, the more the arti- ficial develops, the further it grows away from the nature of that from which it drew its inspiration. Thanks to the various genetic and de- velopmental heterogeneities it implies, an artificial device inevitably generates both "side effects" and "sudden events"-that is to say, events that come along with a planned event (such as the side effects of drugs) and those that ap- pear suddenly without any clear expla- nation (such as an electrical blackout)- that belong to a wider spectrum of possibilities than that of the exemplar and its performances. In the arts, this transfiguration of ex- emplars and their essential perfor- mances represents the very nature of ar- tistic creativity. In fact, all arts are transfigurative simply because artists de- liberately accept the impossibility of re- producing reality and, in fact, amplify that acceptance through their language and poetics. The tendency of the artificial to de- velop different configurations and behav- iors from those of the exemplars is often taken by people as a suggestion for estab- lishing new realities or introducing new classes of objects, processes or languages. The encounter between the artifi- cialistic disposition-which is basically imitative-and the process of creativity is best illustrated by the model proposed at the beginning of the century by anthro- pologist Franz Boas. Writing on the work of "primitive" artists, Boas noted that a weaver, after having trained to repro- duce natural exemplars such as fishes or birds on his cloth, "plays" with his own technique; that is, when no longer satisfied to weave for- ward and back, he begins to skip the wires, introducing more complex rhythms of movement [27]. COMMUNICATION MESSAGES AS ARTIFICIAL OBJECTS In human affairs, although the artificial appears according to different modali- ties than does the technological, they share enough to scrutinize them both on the basis of the same theory [28-34]. In the domain of cultural activity, hu- man communication is probably the most spectacular instance of the genera- tion of the artificial. This developmental process originated at the dawn of civili- zation by means of human vocal sounds with the presumed aim of reproducing widely shared mental exemplars and es- sential performances, i.e. objects or events linked to pain or happiness, hun- ger or tenderness. The process contin- ued along the centuries through the gradual invention of languages as sys- tems based on more and more abstract rules (including grammar, semantics, syntax and style), which led to the pro- duction of messages as definitively artifi- cial objects. We can define the communication process as one by which an actor "A" tries to reproduce (in an attempt, ide- ally, to replicate) an exemplar residing in his or her mind at a certain observa- tional level-and to which he or she at- tributes a certain essential perfor- mance-in the mind of a listener "B." In order to do so, A cannot avoid adopting materials and procedures differ- ent from those that are active in his own mind: thought, mnemonic elements, im- ages, sensations or feelings are then translated-or, more accurately, trans- duced and transferred via language- with the aim of reproducing them. In addition to the selection process involving an observational level, the ex- emplar and its essential performance (and the "inheritance principle" attrib- utable to the adoption of various materi- als and procedures, as well as any side effects and sudden events) constitute a permanent outcome in communication, as we know well from daily life. They ap- pear not only as ideas, conceptual asso- ciations or misunderstandings that modify the path of discourse, but also as agents of reduction and transfiguration of both the exemplar and its essential performance due to the heterogeneity of language. This particularly applies to those situations in which people need to express themselves not only in a purely informational sense, but also in their need to share their most subjective exis- tential knowledge. The Italian poet Dante Alighieri deftly described this human condition in the context of his vision of God: Oh speech How feeble and how faint art thou, to give Conception birth! Yet this to what I saw Is less than little [35]. Actually, the richness and complexity of human language-though a result of the attempt to make communication more accurate and detailed-seems to allow the civilized world a less efficient and effective means of communication than that which was available to "primi- tive" people. This is why we continuously rely, in developed and learned communication, on both the translation of messages into simpler, more familiar references and the illusory and "circular" use of meta- phors. Thus, at least in the Italian lan- guage, the taste of a wine becomes "round" (rotondo) or a pain "acute" (acuto); but also a discourse becomes "flat" (piatto), a personality "angular" (angolosa) and an expression "icy" (glaciale). Such expedients introduce standard- ized exemplars and essential perfor- mances that differ greatly from the spe- cific, subjective exemplar and essential performance that one tries to repro- duce. Let us suppose that Antonio tells Marcello in Italian "So di avera una personalita angolosa" (I know I have an angular personality). Due to the human disposition towards building semantics based on our experiences, Marcello may fear that Antonio is referring to the same threatening personality features Marcello faced just a few days ago while interacting with Mario and not to the kind to which Antonio is referring now. For all these reasons, daily communica- tion unavoidably assumes a feature that is similar to a bounce. The actor A trans- fers the specific meaning of a message stored in his or her mind into some- thing artificial made of linguistic ele- ments and then deposits and repro- duces it in the mind of the listener B. Nevertheless, the meaning turns back also to A-that is, A listens to him or herself. As a consequence, A evaluates the effectiveness of the message as a lis- 186 Negrotti, From the Artificial to the Art</page><page sequence="5">tener, which explains why communica- tion-while only sometimes persuasive to the outside world-is certainly self- persuasive. As stated by L. Pirandello: "When the passage from one spirit to another is accomplished, modifications are unavoidable" [36]. ART AS INTENTIONAL TRANSFIGURATION We may say that art is possible where communication is not. Artistic phenom- enology, as a true self-referential disci- pline, comes not only from the use of conventional technologies, but also from fundamental technologies such as communicative language. As the me- dium becomes the message in Marshall McLuhan's well-known aphorism [37], artistic reproduction always becomes a process by means of which the adopted conventional technology becomes a "substance" in itself-or, more accu- rately, a fact of aesthetic relevance. An artist's subjective exemplars and essential performances-which become his or her representations of reality- have no relevance in themselves until they are actually transfigured by his or her aesthetics into concrete action. In other words, aesthetic value resides in a work of art and not in the mental repre- sentations that precede it, and certainly not in the communication of natural or psychological exemplars as such. Indeed, all art forms draw develop- mental possibilities from the fact that communication technologies-oral, written or otherwise-allow and impose forms and substances that are indepen- dent of both simple exemplars and their simple, essential performances. It appears Oscar Wilde understood this point when he said that [T] he purpose of art is not simple truth but complex beauty. Art, in the end, is an exaggeration of things, and the se- lection of these things themselves, that is, the soul of them, is nothing but an intensified form of emphasis [38]. Art is not pure information (as a large part of ordinary communication is): art is knowledge. The artist does not concern him or herself with mere communication (though his or her work always de facto communicates something) but, rather, with discovering or constructing-and then offering to the public-representa- tions of worlds that exist beyond accepted reality and that only become known due to his or her reproductions. Artistic form and substance bring with them the unavoidable ambiguity that characterizes any artificial object, which, as mentioned above, always transfigures the features of its exemplar and essen- tial performances. In this sense, beyond the evident differences among the vari- ous schools, all art can be defined as transfigurative. The only difference (al- beit strategic) is that artistic ambiguity- far from generating the equivocal or frustrating situations that occur in every- day communication-sometimes also generates aesthetic gratification. In other words, as far as art is con- cerned, we face a new paradox. In fact, the artist exceeds the communication role of the artwork at the moment he or she transduces his or her mental exem- plars and essential performances. The real aim of the artist is simply to transfig- ure reality in accord with his or her aes- thetics, which, in the end, constitute the actual observation level the artist adopts to look at reality itself. Music provides an instructive case here, though one that has not been con- clusively studied. Although various schools of thought exist on this, it seems that the linguistic or symbolic character of music, in combination with its repro- ductive content-that is, its capacity to reproduce the exemplar and the essen- tial performance that was in the composer's mind-would constitute a pre-condition from which to speak of meaning and of the artificial. Actually, the history of music-from Rameau to Couperin, from Vivaldi to Prokofiev- often exhibits explicit attempts to repro- duce "external" exemplars and essential performances whose beauty, neverthe- less, fully belongs to their musical na- tures and transcends their reproductive capacities as such. Chopin-who maintained that he could not conceive music that does not express anything-counterpoints Stra- vinsky, according to whom expression had never been an important feature of music; Richard Strauss, who refused to believe in an abstract music, is opposed by the theses of Eduard Hanslick, who strongly maintained that music is her- metically self-defined [39]. Musical composition consists of a single-step observational process, while all other arts pass through a two-step process. In other words, a classical or tra- ditional painter looks at reality, captures in it some exemplar and then-before he or she may enjoy the poetical trans- figuration generated by the activity-re- produces it in such a way that the viewer can recognize the exemplar. On the con- trary, apart from some particular in- stances of intentionally onomatopoetic music, no natural exemplar can be rec- ognized in either a musical score or its execution, regardless of its title. Indeed, this entails that the composer looks at reality in a special way, namely through what we may call a "musical ob- servation level": a sort of "sense organ" that comprises the cultural result of a long evolution, stabilized by the devel- opment during the seventeenth century of both a standardized scale and essen- tial technical rules [40]. This was already understood by W.H. Wackenroder, one of the leading theore- ticians of Romantic music, when he re- ferred to the mysterious stream which flows in the depth of the human soul: the word enumerates, names and describes the transformations of this stream, adopt- ing a material which is extraneous to it; on the contrary, music makes the stream itself run before our eyes [41]. Both classical painters and composers in general-like any other artificialists- adopt their own materials in their work, but the public recognizes the final result only in the case of the former, which im- plies that composers directly and prima- rily visualize exemplars and their essen- tial performances in a musical way. To some extent, we could then main- tain that modern-particularly ab- stract-painting is much more similar to the nature of music than is traditional painting. However, in its quest to gener- ate truly universal beauty, modern paint- ing lacks the conventional technology- standardized compositional rules and criteria-that music gained after the late Renaissance and that still dominates most modern and contemporary musi- cal composition. In other words, if mu- sic were painting, it would be entirely "abstract," though supported-at least in the Western tradition-by a universal set of rules and criteria. This means that musical "construc- tion"-to use Stravinsky's term [42]-is the real artificial object we can appreci- ate: it is self-sufficient, since it already re- sults from a transfiguration of reality ac- cording to the composer's aesthetics and the conventional technology he or she adopts. To sum up, music clearly exemplifies the freedom of human beings and cul- tures to set up new observation levels and, therefore, to propose new transfig- ured landscapes whose reproduction con- sists of a true knowledge in itself, because music is able to create a universe of vir- tual time that, as maintained Gustav Negrotti, From the Artificial to the Art 187</page><page sequence="6">Mahler, can bring "in another world, in which things are no longer subject to time and space." Balinese people speak of the "other mind" as a state of being one can reach with dance and music [43]. I could discuss many other instances, including electronic or computer music, visual computer art or sculpture. Multi- media art, particularly, will face big problems simply for its attempt to link several observation levels in one project. Multimedia art will inevitably realize some set of aesthetic rules to govern its heterogeneity, which was an aim pur- sued, without persuasive results, by the gesamtkunstwerk utopia attempted, for in- stance, by Richard Wagner. CONCLUSION In human nature, there is something that pushes us not only to adapt our- selves to the world, possibly to know and to control it, but also to reproduce it. In order to shift from the pure knowl- edge of or control of the natural world to the reproduction of it, we need suit- able technology and related materials and techniques. Existing conventional technology comprises a body of tools and knowledge built over the centuries to fit natural laws and constraints; it is not capable by itself of reproducing natural exemplars. Since the time of Icarus, humans have tried to imitate, mimic, simulate, repro- duce and even replicate that which is around or within us by means of avail- able technology. To do so sets up a true paradox: humans try to reproduce natu- ral objects and events through the use of unnatural materials or procedures. The tacit dream of the artificialists is to reach an undefined threshold: they hope to be able to reproduce what is "essential" in their exemplar without having to repro- duce it as a whole-for reproducing it as a whole would require the impossible task of rebuilding it at all of its possible observation levels, that is, replicating it naturally. The artificial is damned to swing for- ever between the pole of nature and the pole of technology-without limiting it- self to either pole. If the artificial were to coincide with a purely technological device, it would lose all similarity to its natural exemplar. If it were to coincide completely with a natural exemplar, it would lose its status as artificial. Thus, the artificial places itself in a "third real- ity" in which a natural exemplar is re- produced, but also transfigured in un- predictable ways. This is particularly true when artificialists try to combine together more than one artificial object (for example, combining two or more organic exemplars of human body parts), hoping that the resulting sub- system will behave like a natural coun- terpart. In this case, transfiguration is due to the fact that accurate reproduc- tion of the subsystem is impossible, for it would require totally accurate knowl- edge and reproduction of all possible observation levels. If one considers not only the techno- logical artificial (e.g. machines and other concrete devices), but also repro- ductions generated in communications and the arts, one will recognize the aforementioned paradox. When we try to communicate our mental state, we are trying to reproduce or to replicate it in someone else's mind by means of lan- guage. Language is the only technology that can be defined as intrinsically ori- ented to the artificial, since its only func- tion is that of allowing the reproduction of our mental states. Unfortunately, lan- guage has developed to the extent that the more personal and complex the message, the greater the transfiguration of our mental exemplars. This failure of language in communi- cation generates frustration in daily life, but it also is responsible as inspiration for artists: Artists assume from the be- ginning the impossibility of communi- cating successfully through language alone. Gustav Mahler, for instance, ex- plicitly said that it was necessary for him to express himself through music when undefinable emotions emerged-if he could have expressed these emotions in words instead, he would have done so. Art in this sense is the generation of ar- tificial objects within which transfigura- tion is not only unavoidable but inten- tional: beauty comes not only directly from the internal and external worlds, but from their transfiguration through art. Human adventure is a field that seems to exhibit definite laws and constraints that limit our ability to cope with nature, but, at the same time, offers us the abil- ity of generating new entities. The main problem is learning or inventing new rules and visions to coexist with this not- yet-experienced reality. References and Notes 1.

In 1860 French poet and writer Charles Baudelaire (1821-1867) wrote Les Paradis artificiels, which describes the effects of drugs on the human senses. See C. Baudelaire, Les Paradis artificiels (Paris: Gallimard, 1972). 5. Sony Corporation has designed a device able to detect smells by means of advanced electronic hardware assisted by computer programs. 6. Chris Langton of Santa Fe Institute started a new area of research (which is today quite advanced) at the end of the 1980s called Artificial Life (A-Life) that aimed at demonstrating that a number of phe- nomena typical of life (such as evolution, reproduc- tion, differentiation) can be reproduced in their essential dynamics by means of computer programs that graphically exhibit the involved processes. A good introduction to A-Life can be found in S. Levy, Artificial Life (New York: Vintage, 1997). See also the article by artist Christa Sommerer and Laurent Mignonneau in this issue of Leonardo. 7.Jacques de Vaucanson was a French technician of the eighteenth century in the field of "automata"- that is, he attempted to reproduce concrete living systems able to perform like human or animal ex- emplars. In addition to the automated drake dis- cussed later in this article, de Vaucanson built a flute player and a drummer. Swiss technician Henri-LouisJacquet-Droz built a draftsman, a musi- cian and a well-known writer. The human disposi- tion for imaging, designing and building automata is ancient; we can find instances of it since the time of Eron (first century A.D.), in ancient China and in the Bible. 8. Biomaterial was defined in 1982 by the U.S. Na- tional Institute of Health as "any substance (other than a drug) or combination of substances, syn- thetic or natural in origin, which can be used for any period of time, as a whole or as a part of a sys- tem which treats, augments, or replaces any tissue, organ, or function of the body." See National Insti- tute of Health, Clinical Applications of Biomaterials. NIH Consensus Statement 4 (1-3 November 1982). Bio-artificial devices may be defined as the devices resulting from the combination, made possible by current conventional technology, of biological and technological features. 9. H.A.

French biologist Jacques Monod maintained that during an ideal visit to Mars a computer would recognize the artifacts built by local people, taking into consideration the geometrical form of the ob- jects it could have seen on the surface of the planet. "Because of complete ignorance about the inhabitants, about their nature and about the projects they could have conceived, the program [of an ideal computer] should use only very gen- eral criteria based exclusively on the structure and form of the considered objects."

Symbolic AI is the early version of AI followed by many researchers in the field. It is called "sym- bolic" after the work of H.A. Simon and colleagues because it tries to reproduce functions of the mind by means of computational models, which are sym- bolic in their very nature. See K.

In mechanistic culture, towards the end of the sixteenth century, Kepler designed a three-dimen- sional reproduction of the universe, the machina mundi artificialis, which was given as a gift to prince Friedrich von Wfirttemberg. 20.
