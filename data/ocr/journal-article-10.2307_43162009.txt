<plain_text><page sequence="1">Strange Partners: The Story of Symbiosis. Anabel Dean. 96pp. $4.95. Lerner Publications Company, 241 First Ave., North, Minneapolis, Min- nesota 55401. 1976. (Grade 5 and up) Dozens of nature's commensal, mutual, and parasitic "odd couples" are present- ed in this book that will delight and enlighten the young reader. Strange Partners ranges from the familiar alga- fungus relationship of lichen to more ex- otic relationships among fish and anemone, whale and barnacle, and in- sect and bird. Emphasis is on the bizarre, rather than the familiar, so the appeal is to the imagination, rather than to "hands-on" experiences with every- day things. Although anthropomorphism is used without accompanying caution to the young reader (e.g., "the sea anemone knows it has a good thing going for it," pp. 42-43), the book is recommended for elementary and junior 54 SCIENCE and CHILDREN</page><page sequence="2">high readers and to teachers who want to spice up their symbiosis lessons with "believe it or not" examples.
