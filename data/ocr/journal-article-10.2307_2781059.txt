Barry Smart University of Auckland Neglect of the potential of the body as a topic of investigation, particu- larly in respect of the access it promises to provide for an understanding of the complex interrelationships among forms of human subjectivity, social practices, and institutions, has been a general weakness of both classical and contemporary sociology. At one level, John O'Neill's Five Bodies compensates for the neglect of the body in sociological discourse through what amounts to a consideration of the prospects and pos- sibilities for a "sociology of the body." However, as anyone familiar with O'Neill's other works might expect, much more is at issue than the mere identification of a new field of sociological inquiry, for at another level, the book provides a powerful and convincing critical analysis of modern society, its central institutions, organizational forms, and likely develop- ment. In addition, O'Neill presents the view that it is vital to preserve, if not regenerate or extend, the potential for and practice of a "human shaping of human beings." In brief, O'Neill's thesis is that there is a need for anthropomorphism-"an essential human response; . . . a critical force in the human shaping of human beings" (p. 15)-to counter the increasing therapeutic administration and government of minds, bodies, and experiences in modern society. O'Neill identifies the human body as "an intelligent and critical re- source in the anthropomorphic production of those small and large orders that underlie our social, political, and economic institutions" (p. 16), and, 224</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews although an analytic distinction is drawn between a physical body and a lived or communicative body, the two are recognized to be experientially inseparable. Thus, it is the articulation of biology and culture that consti- tutes the context if not the focus of much of the discussion. To those who would argue that the body is peripheral to sociological interest and in- quiry, O'Neill replies that, as far as everyday life is concerned, "we have-and must have-society in our bones. ... The work of institu- tions is finely grained into our physical, mental, nervous, and moral constitution-and this is what accomplishes the daily marvel of social order with its pleasures and pains, its rewards and punishments" (p. 24). It is abstract and rationalized modes of thinking and classification, dis- connected from their foundation in an embodied logic, and synonymous with modern science and its technological corollaries, that have con- stituted the instrument through which domination has been exercised over both nature and humanity. If we are to begin to recover the power to give a human shape to our present and future existence, we need, accord- ing to O'Neill, to (re-)constitute a conception of the world's body and of our necessary kinship with it. In other words, in order to counter the domination, estrangement, and disenchantment arising from "negative" anthropomorphism, there is a need for a "radical" anthropomorphism to "think the future shape of human beings according to a rule of conserva- tion that places nature before life, yet life before society and the family before ourselves" (p. 47). O'Neill comments that, just as it can be shown that people once thought and made sense of the world and the universe and their respec- tive places in the greater order of things through body imagery, so it is when we turn to the "lesser" order of human society and the conception of relations between individuals and social institutions. Yet, of course, we are not inclined to think in this way; we may accept that society infiltrates our minds and even shapes our sense of self, but our bodies, nature's "gift," are generally regarded as impermeable. As O'Neill puts it, "We prefer to think that society operates upon us intellectually and consensu- ally rather than directly upon our bodies, which suggests a more slavish relation" (p. 48). Drawing on a wide range of philosophical, sociological, and anthropological sources, O'Neill demonstrates that in respect of diet and eating, sexuality and pleasure, the production and consumption of commodities and services, as well as in relation to body contour or shape, physical fitness, health, and ill health, "our bodies are social in almost any way we care to think" (p. 65). Turning to the question of what needs to be done to counter the therapeutic administration and degradation of human existence and experience as well as to combat the erosion of the body politic, O'Neill discusses the limits and limitations of professionalism and the welfare state and argues for the need "to reinvent the family as a responsible unit of action regarding the welfare of its members in matters of education, consumption, and general health" (p. 117). Five Bodies makes a significant contribution to contemporary social 225</page><page sequence="3">American Journal of Sociology thought through its critical approach to the question of the sociality of our bodies; the economic, ecological, and ethical effects of Western life-styles, production/consumption patterns and habits, and associated cultural forms on increasingly marginalized populations across the world; and the subordination of the body politic to the therapeutic state armed with industrial medical technology. It represents an attempt to revive political discourse and the imagery of the body politic against the "twin excesses of neo-individualism and statism" (p. 83) through the cultivation of "anthro- pomorphism and familism." While one might take issue with O'Neill's frequent endorsements of some form of family life, particularly the lack of discussion of possible desirable forms, the book as a whole in interesting, thought provoking, and enjoyable to read.</page></plain_text>
