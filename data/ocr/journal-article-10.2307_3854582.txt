<plain_text><page sequence="1">(I62) NOTES AND NEWS On Prof. Gunn's resignation from the editorship of this Journal, his place was taken by Mr. C. R. C. Allberry, of Christ's College, Cambridge, and it is to their combined energy that Vol. xxvi was due. In course of time Mr. Allberry joined the Air Force, with the result that responsi- bility for this periodical reverted to one of its earliest editors. The chances of obtaining good material for Vol. xxvII looked black at the outset, with excavations at a standstill, museums inac- cessible or closed, and all younger colleagues engaged in war work. The usual bibliographies (excepting that by Mr. Tod included in the present volume) were rendered impossible by the absence of foreign publications. Happily the Old Guard has come valiantly to the rescue, and our members will not be dissatisfied with the fare here provided. How much that fare owes to the material and how much-to continue the metaphor-to its culinary preparation it would be in- vidious to inquire; but it must be manifest to all that Dr. Johnson, our superlative chef at the University Press, has once again excelled himself, and has set a new standard as regards the gar- nishing and the dishing up which will, it is hoped, stimulate our purveyors to even keener activity. It need not be concealed that we have had to ask ourselves seriously (i) whether the circumstances of the moment justified a volume of the present scope, and (2) whether our finances would stand it. Encouragement from American friends has gone far to reassure us on the first point; on the second we should indeed have had to retrench drastically but for the fact that staunch supporters of the Society have come forward to make good the difference between the total cost and what our admir- ably prudent Hon. Treasurer would allow us to spend. The Committee are deeply indebted to some authors of articles who have not only consented to write them, but also to contribute towards their printing. Whatever doubts might be entertained by outsiders as to the propriety of scientific publication during the worst crisis this country has ever had to face, scholars will no doubt, as a whole, take the longer view and realize that our organization had to be kept alive and that it was only by present efforts that our future could be assured. When the post-war period arrives, it will become known what a large number of our leading researchers have thrown themselves wholeheartedly into the common cause. But there have been others, older men, whose duty seemed to lie in intensifying their researches and so striving to outstrip their competitors in the field of scholarship. It will be curious to learn what the lands under Nazi control, and above all Germany herself, have been able to produce in the domains of Egyptology and papyrology in this time of stress. The Danes at all events have not been idle, and a monograph by Profs. Lange and Neugebauer on an interesting hieratic and demotic cosmological papyrus has reached this country, as well as a long article on the Divine Wife of Amuin by Prof. Sander-Hansen. From neutral Switzerland has been received an interesting little book by Prof. Jequier on his twelve years of excavation in the Memphite Necropolis, and many well-wishers will desire to congratulate that admirable archaeologist on this rounding off of his work in Egypt. Meanwhile British scholars have something to show. The recently issued new volume of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri is described below. Temples of Armant, another important work due to our Society, was mentioned in the last Notes and News. N. de G. Davies's stately publication of the Tomb of Ramose, the coping-stone to our late President's labours in Egypt, is a magnificent monu-</page><page sequence="2">NOTES AND NEWS I63 ment to his memory, thanks to the combined efforts of author and printer. To the present writer is due a large folio volume of Plates introducing to Egyptologists one of the most important secular hieratic papyri in existence, called the Wilbour Papyrus after the distinguished American Egyptolo- gist from whose funds the cost of the publication has been defrayed; this deals with the taxation of land under Ramesses V, and deep gratitude will be felt to the authorities of the Brooklyn Museum for sponsoring so extensive an undertaking; the Text volume is in course of preparation. We understand that W. F. Laming Macadam's book on the inscriptions of Kawa, of which report speaks very favourably, is already in the hands of the printer; it is much to be desired that the results of the late Professor and Mrs. Griffith's important excavations on that Nubian site should be completely published with as little further delay as possible. We cannot but feel regret that our Society's memoirs on El-'Amarnah, Sesebi, and 'Amarah West are postponed owing to the engage- ment of their authors upon war work of various kinds, and the publication of the temple of Sethos I at Abydos is likewise at a standstill. Dr. Bell writes: 'Part XVIII of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, edited by Mr. E. Lobel, Mr. C. H. Roberts, and Miss E. P. Wegener, will appear in the autumn of this year. It is a volume of somewhat outstanding interest, even in the remarkable series of which it forms part. Theological texts are, indeed, of minor importance, though an addition to the few papyrus fragments of Philo is welcome, but the new classical fragments give this Part a very notable place among editions of papyri. Frag- ments of no less than six of the lost plays of Aeschylus, besides two of his surviving ones, are here published; and of the new plays the zLiKcrvoAKoI, the @EwpoQ ij 'Io(trcaacrTat (?), and the EavTptat are represented by a fair number of lines. The remains of Alcaeus are increased by a most inter- esting, if difficult, poem of biographical interest; there are considerable fragments of Callimachus, and not only fragments of poems by Hipponax but also a commentary on him. An imperfect but interesting fragment of the so-called Acta Alexandrinorum makes a useful addition to the surviving specimens of this class of literature. Among known literary works the Oedipus Rex of Sophocles and Plato's Phaedo are represented by substantial fragments. 'Documentary papyri, though not so numerous as in some former volumes, are of good quality and include some notable texts. Among them are a long letter, one of the most interesting examples of epistolography yet found among the papyri, from an "undergraduate", probably at the university of Alexandria, to his father, a letter announcing the writer's arrival at Puteoli after a voyage in which he "experienced no discomfort such as usually occurs, particularly on one's first voyage", another, of quite special interest, concerning books and mentioning a bookseller who may have one of the works required, two curious Christian letters which, though in Greek, begin with a Latin quotation, and some important accounts from the Apion archive.' We have grievous losses to record among our collaborators, colleagues, and other supporters, foremost among whom are Prof. C. G. Seligman, the well-known anthropologist, Sir Arthur Evans, the famous pioneer of Minoan excavation, and Mr. Harry Burton, the skilled photographer of the tomb of Tut(ankhamiin and of many of the Theban excavations undertaken by the Metropolitan Museum of New York. Some paragraphs were consecrated to the first and third of these in our recently issued Annual Report for I940. In Sir Arthur Evans we mourn, not only a great scholar and very generous patron of archaeology, but also a liberal contributor to our Society; it would be otiose to dilate here on a career which has been described at length in the daily papers, and will doubtless be dealt with thoroughly in the proceedings of the societies with which he was yet more closely associated. Here, however, we may fitly dwell on the work of Miss Bertha Porter (d. Oxford, Jan. 17, 1941), inasmuch as she was very closely associated with the late Professor Griffith, the first of our own Society's students. For many years she had contributed to the Dictionary of</page><page sequence="3">I64 NOTES AND NEWS National Biography and (to quote her obituary notice in The Times) 'by her labours in the British Museum and other libraries, became an expert bibliographer'. Unless the present writer is mis- taken, it was to him, despite his youth at the time, that Miss Porter owed her first introduction to Egyptology. Casting around for some new field of scientific endeavour when her work on the Dictionary came to an end, she copied many of the stelae in the British Museum on behalf of her young friend Alan Gardiner. It was only at a later date that she went to Gottingen to study with Professor Sethe, and subsequently was recommended by Erman and Sethe as the most suitable person to be entrusted with Griffith's projected conspectus of the ancient monuments. In I924 Miss Rosalind Moss was asked to collaborate, and thus originated that remarkable partnership to which we owe the six invaluable volumes of the Topographical Bibliography of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic Texts, Reliefs, and Paintings, to which others remain to be added. Though Miss Porter dropped out, owing to ill health and old age, before actual publication was far advanced, it was to her that the planning and the first stages of this all-important undertaking were mainly due. Apart from her literary achievements, Miss Porter will be long remembered for her warm-heartedness, en- couragement to young aspirants, and great gifts in various directions. At this point we digress a little to pay a tribute to the work of British women in the field of Egyptology. Risking the anger of those whose modesty may be embarrassed, we cannot refrain from taking this opportunity to express our admiration of the ladies who have thrown their energies into our subject. In what other country, though most possess or have possessed some excellent lady Egyptologists, has so great a mass of outstanding work been attributable to their talent and enthusiasm? The monumental tomes devoted to Egyptian Painting by Mrs. Davies and to the temple of Sethos I by Miss Calverley and Miss Broome, stand side by side with the above-mentioned volumes of the Bibliography as pre-eminent examples of feminine achievement. But there are many other important names that could have been mentioned, and it is only through fear of omitting one or other that we refrain from enumerating them all. Every Egyptologist will be able to fill out the lacuna for himself. Among foreign scholars we have also to record the deaths of the American Prof. Clarence S. Fisher and the French Prof. Hyvernat. Fisher excavated for the University of Pennsylvania various sites in Egypt and Palestine, perhaps his greatest success being at Memphis. Unfortunately, his published work was very slight, the only book of any size due to him being one on the minor cemetery of the Old Kingdom at Gizah. Dr. Crum writes with regard to Hyvernat: 'Born in 1858 near Lyons, he migrated in I889, after some years in Rome, to the Catholic University at Washing- ton. He was an excellent Coptic scholar; the many texts which he published are unlikely to call for re-editing. For years past he had devoted himself to the study of the vast Pierpont Morgan collection of MSS. Of these he produced, in 1919, a summary Check-List-still our sole guide to the contents of the 56 volumes-and he had long been preparing an elaborate Catalogue, unfortu- nately left unpublished.' There are many who will be anxious for news of their colleagues abroad, and as regards the French we are indebted to Dr. Cerny, himself in Egypt, for interesting information. Great sym- pathy will be felt with Prof. Lefebvre in the loss of his son on the field of battle. M. Boreux has surrendered his position as Conservateur at the Louvre, M. Drioton having been appointed in his place; but during the absence of the latter in Egypt, where he has been retained as Director of the Service des Antiquites for another two years, M. Vandier is replacing him in Paris. M. Jouguet has retired from his Directorship of the French Institute at Cairo, and has been lecturing on Greek and Roman History at the University of that city; his successor at the Institute is M. Kuentz.</page><page sequence="4">NOTES AND NEWS Another appointment of interest is that of Mr. A. Rowe as Director of the i\Juseum at Alexandria. M. Chevrier, who was in charge of Karnak, is said to be a prisoner of war, and so, too, was that able archaeological architect M. Robichon, who, however, has since been released. At Brussels M. Capart is said to be well, and to be no less full of scientific activity than is his wont. It was hardly likely that much would be going on in the way of excavation, but Dr. Cerny reports whatever is to be reported. At Kom esh-Shukafah in Alexandria Rowe has resumed the excavations in the catacombs, finding tombs of the first and second centuries A.D. Beautiful jewellery was discovered on the body of a lady encased in a coloured and gilded plaster shell modelled in the form of a goddess; this comprised a necklace having suspended from a chain a wheel-pendant with eight spokes, the emblem of Nemesis; also an armlet among other objects all of gold. Nearby in a partly robbed tomb was a female skeleton from which were taken three golden rings with a cameo in each; the largest of the rinrgs had an onyx cameo on which were engraved Leda and the swan; the cameos of the other rings were of agate, the one with a figure of Harpocrates holding a cornucopia and the other showing Ilars with spear and shield. Less important tombs were also found, and in the hands or mouths of some of the dead were discovered bronze coins wherewith to pay.the ferryman; the bodies had been placed either in loculi or in troughs, and lay on their backs upon a layer of clean sand. At Sakkarah Chief Inspector Zaky Saad completely excavated, with funds given by H.M. the King, a large tomb of 'Persian' type near the pyramid of Onnos similar to those found in I900. The shaft, more than 20 metres deep, was filled with sand. At the bottom was found a vaulted chamber the limestone walls of which are carved with Pyramid Texts. The owner was one Amen- tefnakhte, chief of the king's bodyguard, and he seems to have lived in the second half of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty. The burial chamber was entirely filled with an enormous sarcophagus of hard limestone, 4 metres in length. In this was an anthropomorphic coffin of schist. Though the tomb was unrobbed, the body did not yield any jewels or indeed objects of any kind. At Mlit Rahinah to the right of and not far from the road leading to Sakkarah, Mustafa el-Amir, the inspector of Sakkarah, discovered walls probably belonging to the temple of Apis. A large offering-table (4- by 2 m.), with a base about 5-1 m. long, was hewn out of a single block of alabaster. This had the form of a bed with lions on both of the long sides; a few steps lead up to the table from the base; on the opposite, northern side a circular alabaster base received the water from the surface of the table. Close at hand was a smaller bed, likewise consisting of one piece of alabaster, bearing the name of king Nechos (Dyn. XXVI) 'beloved of the living Apis'. West of the large bed was another of limestone smaller in size. Other finds were a block of alabaster with the name of Amasis and a large alabaster vase of Darius. These excavations came to an end through lack of funds. Just before this volume goes to Press, the news reaches us of the death, at a ripe old age, of the distinguished Russian Egyptologist Wladimir Golenischeff. No details are known, and for an adequate notice here both material and space are lacking. Deep regret will be felt at the passing of one not only an eminent scholar, but also a great-hearted gentleman, the friend of old and young alike, whose innate dignity and simplicity were thrown into sharp relief by heavy pecuniary losses at the conclusion of the last war.
