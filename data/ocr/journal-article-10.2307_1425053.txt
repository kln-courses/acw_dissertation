The Biennale in Venice that year, organized by Paolo Portogh- esi, Robert Stern, Christian Norberg- Schulz, Vincent Scully and Charles Jencks, signalled "the new consensus," as Jencks puts it. No longer did the modernist agenda hold sway. The purism and principle of the International Style had come to represent the alienating self-absorption of the corporate and governmental bureaucracies that inhab- ited it. The new sensibility called for inclusion, participation, and dialogue, thus establishing pluralism as the salient ingredient in the new trend. A building was no longer a justification of dogma. It had to develop a relationship with its user, understand and embrace its context, communicate its raison d'etre. But something else happened too: a postmodern penchant for irony, detach- ment, paradox, and wit appeared as the new forms sought their terms of reference in "The Presence of the Past," as the Biennale's title announced it. Everything old wasn't exactly new again, but it wasn't exactly old any more either. The separation of past and present that had been established by the Bauhaus and Das Neue Bauen was no longer doc- trine. Yet the past wasn't being repos- sessed holus-bolus either. The tempera- ture was schizophrenic. Too blatant an historical revival might revisit certain troubling dialogues of power, as Peter Smithson argued as early as the 1960 CIAM conference at Otterlo. Not enough recovery of the past and architecture remained in the modernist void. Implicit in the uncomfortable dilemma was the degree to which postmodernism constituted a rejection of modernism, an issue that remains a troubling debate. Its highlights can be readily glimpsed in two recent books on postmodernism, Heinrich Klotz's The History of Postmodern Architecture, and the fourth edition of CharlesJencks' The language of Postmodern Architecture. To Klotz, the postmodern aesthetic is a revision of modernism; toJencks, it is rather more a reaction against it. The German sees a fairly steady progression towards "ar- chitectural fiction" through certain crucial modifications of rationalism. The Ameri- can sees the emergence of a whole new way of comprehending buildings based on semiotic theory, with the initial em- brace of metaphorical content appear- ing a little skittish and pedestrian, the more mature resonances becoming ex- citing and profound. Klotz ends in pure fiction; a section entitled "architecture on paper" reveals fantasies of the future that are by turns witty, sarcastic, Daliesque and unbuildable. Jencks ends in "synthesis", the new and the old coming comfortably together in a style he calls "Postmodern Classicism". Both see in the best of postmodern architects a certain talent for formal reference that allows a bridging of the gap between the purity of modernism and the identity and dia- logue of historical reference. The pluralist terrain does not easily sub- mit to coherent critique. In Klotz we make our way architect by architect, perhaps occasionally losing sight of the woods for the trees. In Jencks we see the relentless energy of the classifier at work in the face of a myriad of substyles, all appearing at one point in the form of an ornate "evolutionary tree". Also in Jencks is something of the snapshot feel of a jounalistic work in progress as each new edition adds yet another postscript (though Klotz too adds a postscript, written in 1987, to the new American edition). Nevertheless, the sensibility of the new trend is clearly glimpsed in either case. Both authors face first, and at some length, the matter of the demise of modernism. Early hints of something new seem to have come from two directions. There was the strident historicism of the revivalists, a glaring and polished ex- ample of which is the Getty Museum in Malibu, California (1 970-5), a scholarly recreation of the Villa of Papyri in Herculaneum. Then there was the overt symbolism of buildings like Corbusier's Ronchamp (1955) - was the guru of modernism turning over his earlier ratio- nale for a commitment to sculptural form? - Saarinen's TWA building (1962), and Utzon's Sydney Opera House (1 957- 74). these were buildings of representa- tional form, not self-sufficient glass box rationalism; they strove to communicate implicit meanings to their users. The re- sulting communication wasn't altogether unambiguous, but it certainly wasn't modernist either. Did these first hints of a new trend con- stitute a rejection of modernism outright, or just an evolutionary progression from modernism? Much energy has gone into advancing the former thesis, a lot of it in the sixties. There was Venturi's Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture (1966), Summer 1990 JAE 43/4</page><page sequence="2">54 recommending ambiguity as a first prin- ciple of design in place of modernist clarity (or reductionism). Mannerist and baroque sources, Venturi was arguing, may have been born of a time but are not restricted to it. All architecture comments on other architecture anyway, the argu- ment implied, regardless of its historical context. So, architects may feel free to incorporate such free floating historical paradigms into their own work as they see fit. Curiously, here was a modernist argument in form, since it saw architec- tural forms as liberated or detachable from historical contexts, ready for reinvention in the modern world. Yet here was an argument urging consider- ation of historical forms in service of a postmodernist cause. Also modernist was the polemical tone - Venturi called it a "gentle manifesto" - yet a polemic in service of an unpolemical architecture. The argument thus had one foot in modernist thinking and one foot beyond it. In content, however, the suggestion of a thoroughgoing break with modernism was unmistakable. From Europe came a blatant land ironi- cally stated) rejection of modernism. Returning to Vienna after several years in the United States, Hans Hollein claimed in a lecture in 1962 that "Architecture has no purpose. Speaking in terms of precalculated material utilization, it is purposeless.... The origin of architecture is sacred...[its] function is a purely spiritual, magical one....[and] a build- ing ought to show what it means." (Seventeen years later Hollein called architecture "cultic" and 'Ritualistic," underlining again its spiritual or sym- bolic purpose.) The modernist agenda of moral self-improvement in tandem with rationalized function and abstract form was no longer credible. And while Norberg-Schulz wrote about "intentions" in architecture (1963), and Jencks and Baird about "meaning" in architecture (1969), Louis Kahn shifted architecture into a transitional realm, seemingly symbolic, historical and modern all at once. The Bangladesh Parliament Building (1965-74) recovered the use of monumental Roman vocabu- lary for its own purposes; the Salk Insti- tute (1959-65) re-established ceremo- nial staging and a Greek-like axis to infinity. Meanwhile German voices were seeing their urban fabric as a living, organic continuum again, growing directly from its own history. "Architecture is a living intrusion into a complex, mysterious en- vironment that has grown and been molded prior to our times," Gieselman and Ungers wrote in Zu einer neuen Architektur in 1960. "Its creative mission...is a continuous discovery of the genius loci from which it draws its impulses. "Also, Rob and Leon Krier were interested in urban reconstruction based on a view of urban space that saw it as experiential and sensual rather than ra- tionalized and functional. In Italy Aldo Rossi's Monument of the Resistance in Segrate in 1965 attempted to restore the recollection of poignant wartime events, taking into account even the shadows cast by the architecture as part of the meditation engendered by it, as Rossi himself implied. Amidst the pu- rity of primary forms there developed a remarkable awakening of memory. If the break with modernist formal purity wasn't absolute, the break with the modernist silence about the past certainly was. Subsequently, the more fully blown, complicitous and involving fictions of postmodernism arrived in the '70s, and it became harder to believe that mod- ernism had come along for the ride. Charles Moore's Kresge College (1 973) creates a whole narrative collage of village life without didacticism or pre- tension. The college's main path or street becomes both spine and story, structure and narrative, creating the college's myth of place. Hans Hollein's Austrian Travel Bureau (1976-8) created an efferves- cent fiction, a joyous set of illusionistic impressions pointing to, but not claiming to be identical with, certain experiences related to travel. Moore's Piazza d'ltalia (1976-9) in New Orleans appeared as one of the monuments of postmodernism, recovering the spirit of Italy for the local inhabitants amidst the festive ambience of conscious architectural play. This was and was not Italy, the architecture said: irony and detachment are part of the game. The essence of the work, thus, was the viewer's involvement in it. The earnest commitments of modernism had been diffused. On another scale of urgency altogether was Aldo Rossi's Modena Cemetary (1971-85). Here again his primary forms attempt to recover and provoke dark and moving currents of memory. The proces- sional experience moves from vacant city to crematorium funnel where the living stand in defiance and mourning over the violence done to their ancestors. As a repository of collective conscious- ness, the Modena Cemetery taps into the historical experience of the visitor in a way that makes the work one of the most haunting architectural memorials of our time. The '80s gave birth to the most self- confident statements of postmodernism. The most significant statement of self- arrival so far seems to be Michael Graves' Portland Public Service building (1980- 3), forthright in its stylized but striking use of historical motifs, its overall schema in fact like one giant keystone sitting on two fluted columns. the building seems monumental, yet with a strange trans- parency, like a building in a state of pure meditation. Yet the whole vocabulary of historical public building appropriately announces the building's publicpurpose. Even though the technology of modern building remains, we've come a long way from the Bauhaus. Yet an inheritance of modernism remains in the rationalist tradition that informs certain postmodern developments. Take for instance the formal rationale and modularity at the heart of house schemes by Graves and Eisenman. Grids may intersect at odd and inventive angles, but the generative rationale for the form Summer 1990 JAE 43/4</page><page sequence="3">55 remains evident throughout. Similarly, German postmodern architects working in the rationalist tradition, like Kleihues, allow a building's form to be developed by the repetition of a basic element, as in his Landesgalerie in Dusselforf, only to break, disturb, or interrupt it. Meanwhile O. M. Ungers has developed a notion that seems to me crucial to the future of architecture, namely the idea of transfor- mation as a generative morphology of related themes - variations and reca- pitulations, like the structure of classical music. Moreover, if the postmodernist aesthetic is to remain true to its philosophical base, seeing all historical vocabulary as both rootedin its place in history and hovering independently over it at the same time, then the postmodern move- ment will feel itself free to embrace its own modernist inheritance on the same terms as it embraces other historical vocabulary. The stage is set for the broadest possible dialogue with the past - possessing and inventive, eclectic, pluralist, exploratory. Yet still at issue is the degree to which the reuse of historical forms returns us to the past. To what degree might archi- tectural meaning be predetermined? If one of our modernist inheritances is a self-conscious separation from historical usage, then the social content conjured up by that historical usage need not be simultaneously reborn. Even the strictest form of revivalism no longer returns us entirely to the past, because our histori- cal recollection is cumulative; we are the sum of our past, so any one remembrance of it, taken literally, cannot return us to the past en entier. (You can't go back home.) The key lies in the implications of form, the notion that architectural language is really more metaphorical than literal. Historical suggestion in reinvented forms establishes dialogue, not repetition. Suggestions of permanence and con- tinuum can occur without offering up the prospect of history relived. Such sug- gestions are accomplished for instance by the Netherlandish row housing in Zwolle designed by Aldo van Eyck and Theo Bosch in 1977. Here are hints of subtle and implied remembrances mani- fest in aspects of the medieval street, the renaissance merchant or tall house, plus a great variety of inventive spaces, in- cluding alcoves, terraces, loggias and vestibules. The modern thus connects the new and the old, creating dialogue, remembrance and continuum, rooting the user in tradition while keeping the traditional alive to the spontaneity of the present. Historical (social and ideologi- cal) content, meanwhile, has undergone a cultural metamorphosis, neither denied altogether nor embraced in nostalgia. "The historical forms are husks of meanings," says Klotz, "that can be filled with new contents - usually in such a way that the new contents are in a tense antithetical relation to the old contents, which are still partially remembered." The buildings' 'function' is now historical and cultural as much as practical. More than a mere tilt towards metaphor, however, the postmodern embrace of figurative content can be, in Klotz's view, pretty thoroughgoing. At least this is the direction in which he is rather consistently headed: One finds oneself transported into a world where the signals of the past, activated from afar, gain impact and spread (via the highly refined constructs of the highest technical perfection) a veil of memories of the past. Such are the makings of fiction for an architecture that, in the wake of the functionalist deletion of meaning, aspires to new meaning and contents. Only by these means does the art of architecture regain the quality that connects it to all the other arts: the ability to relate life to fiction and reality to the realm of the imagina- tion, where liberation from mere Tacts can be "played out. Those interested in postmodern trends could do no better than spend their next available ten minutes with Klotz's two page epilogue in which he cites his ten "defining characteristics". Taken to- gether, they emphasize the notion of building as an act of symbolizing, a work of narrative fiction - even 'poetry' - and come replete with an evolution- ary warning: Modernism has to pass through the pro- cess of fictional design, and all those architects who think they will be able to keep the purity of modernist abstraction from being sullied will not be part of the continuing creative development of ar- chitecture. The would be postmodernist, however, needs also to contend with the over- whelming pluralism of the movement, the main emphasis of Charles Jencks' book. Individual experience takes on a new credibility as context and compromise replace design consistency and dogma as the central architectural fundamen- tals. But, as readers of the previous editions will know, Jencks is very explicit - that is, literal - about the notion of a building as a text. Jencks applies the language of literary theory (from whence postmodernism was born with its interest in semantics and semiotics) back onto architectural form. He considers the im- plications of "words" (or single elements) and "syntax" (or the relationships between elements), as well as notions of metaphor and analogy, signifier and signified. The juxtapositions between elements are seen as being one of the keys to their meaning. The 'talking' that buildings do in fact is taken quite literally, its source being Venture's recommendation that the architect has much to learn from the symbolical efficacy of 'main street' or 'the strip'. But donut stands in the shape of donuts (or "ducks" or iconic signs) don't take us very far. Nor does the mannerism of peeling or disintegrating facades (Venturi's "decorated shed" or symbolic sign, establishing a differentia- tion between interior and exterior func- tion). Nor do anthropomorphic allusions such as doors as mouths (a throwback to Federigo Zuccaro's gamey grotesques in the mannerist renaissance) or facades as faces. The language of architecture is more effective when working by subtle Summer 1990 JAE 43/4</page><page sequence="4">56 implication - quiet metaphorical sug- gestion - than by literal reference. The right kind of metaphorical allusion beck- ons the viewer to be a part of the archi- tectural 'fiction' at a much deeper level of consciousness than do simplistic analogies. Wit and symbol combine to reveal "the self-conscious or 'meta' sensibility of our times" as literary critic Linda Hutcheon says in The Canadian Postmodern: "the awareness that all our systems of under- standing are deliberate and historically specific human constructs (not natural and eternal givens)." As much as we might long to be naive again, authors and architects are saying, we can't be: our naivet6 is bound up with our rela- tionship to the illusions we create for ourselves. (Hence the penchant of postmodern litterateurs to acknowledge generic boundaries and conventions while simultaneously standing outside them or breaking them.) What then are the uses of history? If revivalist, as David Watkin avers in his recent History of Western Architecture, how do we know what to revive? If all architecture comments on other archi- tecture, as the book's essentially postmodern thesis affirms, how do we gather what makes for a successful transplant? If historical vocabularies are rooted in time and place and transport- able, the architect must know the cultural conditions, so to speak, at both ends in order to ensure a credible reception for the reinvented form. The nuance of dif- ference is especially crucial. He or she must comprehend 'the language of the tribe," as Jencks calls it, the cultural etiquette of architectural form (as op- posed to the more presumptuous and insistent Zeitgeist of the modernists). An additional ingredient is the temper of the times. Conservative times seem rather more ready to embrace orthodox revisitings than liberal ones. Hence, for instance, the Etruscan and axial strictures given Augustus' Temple of Mars Ultor in the Augustan portion of the Roman Forum, establishing the appropriate notions of political progress in the minds of its beholders. So too with the Schinkelesque revivalism under Friedrich Wilhelm, ac- cording the appropriate sobriety, ideal- ism and dignity to the wished for image of the Prussian state. Indeed, the thor- oughgoing migration of classical vo- cabulary in the history of the west from temple to basilica to church to villa to library to bank to fairground to super- market has lent the historian a gauge by which to judge various kinds of political and moral legitimizing - views of the good life, if you will. The fact of the migration itself is enough to establish historical vocabularies as no more than the 'husks of meaning" Klotz suggests they are. The real reinvention occurs in the mind of the user when in complicity with the aims of the architect. The classi- cal revivalism favoured by the pre-war Fascists was an attempt to clothe the Reich in the grandeur of Rome. But the 1 Hodrlan's Villa, Tivoli (118-139 A.D.)

Acropolis, Athens same choice of architectural vocabulary recommends the American democracy on the grounds of it Athenian spirit. The vistas of I'Enfant's Washington com- memorate a different kind of temporal power than the vistas of baroque Rome, but the urban design device is the same. Also in Washington, Lincoln gets his own Doric temple whileJefferson gets his own Pantheon. Such striking contrasts in 'cultural content' demonstrate the postmodern contention that the "Truth" is not singular but plural, as Linda Hutcheon puts it, and not found but constructed, in complicity with its audience. Not sur- prisingly, classicism is alive and well still as a dominant strain of postmodernism: Jencks devotes his latest postscript to it. But even traditional classicism may have already revealed to us, from the gener- ous perspective of its history, the first curiously 'postmodern' buildings. The Erechtheion in Athens, for instance, is a building devoted to memory, yet reintegrative or pluralist in form, sophis- ticate, self-conscious, inventive. Build when Athens was fighting for its life against Sparta, her confident Periclean self-image a mere shadow of its former self, the building tells a 'story' or 'nar- rative', creates a 'fiction', incorporating references to Erectheus, Poseidon and Athene, and plays with the very idea of the (traditional Greek) self-sufficiency of wall and column. Even the idea of the column itself is reconsidered on the cary- atid porch. The implicit anthropomor- phism of the column leaps to another level of interpretation altogether as the maidens gracefully support their archi- trave with little effort. Or consider Hadrian's Villa as a postmodern pre- view. Another 'late' piece devoted to memory and experience expressed in large metaphorical gestures. Yet em- bracing the spontaneity and inventive- ness o the present and the individuality of its builder. Can Moore's exuberant Piazza d'ltalia be far behind?! Nevertheless, postmodern pluralism is of a whole new order. The present day architect is swamped with styles. What to do? We're beyond the passive 19th IIlllll L '111111 3 Charles Moore, Piazza d'ltalia (1975-80X New Orleans, Louisiana Summer 1990 JAE 43/4 57</page><page sequence="6">century pluralism implicit in Heinrich Hibsch's famous query in 1828, In welchem Stil sollen wir bauen? (In what style shall we build?) - the kind of thinking that made the Ludwigstrasse in Munich and the Ringstrasse in Vienna contemporaneous museums of styles. We're also beyond the social conserva- tism that established the pluralism of the early 20th century in America, where as Watkin puts it, "a business tycoon of these years might live in a neo-Tudor suburban mansion, work in an art Deco skyscraper, visit a neo-Georgian coun- try club at the weekends, and educate his sons at a neo-Gothic college, all build in the 1920s." Today, by virtue of the media, even the average citizen has whatJencks calls "a well-stocked musee imaginaire" - the potential exposure of a world traveller with the detachment of what Mcluhan called television 'cool'. Now the architect must accompany a fluency in architectural vocabularies with a fluency in cultural understanding in order that the constructs of signifier and signified become more than lust a game. The sensitivity must be to origins and to current context in order to capture coher- ently the subtle associations between the remembered and the reinvented. It's a knowing art, yet a deeply moving and powerfully subjective one. and yet the cultural memory remains one of the most mysterious and ultimately unfathomable of human facets, embracing a knowl- edge of tradition and yet informing spontaneous invention. This is the inter- play that plays a part in the creative process and makes the act of designing in the postmodern context so exciting. How then should we teach history? With the widest possible exposure to our cul- tural past, accompanied by an eye for the inventive and an avoidance of the doctrinaire. A hint of such an approach comes in Bill Risebero's Story of West- ern Architecture when we glimpse the political and cultural forces responsible or building programs in, say, Louis XVI's France or Charles Dickens' England. (Spiro Kostof has taken us further down the same road with his focus on "settings and rituals".) With entire social struc- tures presented diagrammatically, the reader immediately sensitive to the iconographical program of official building projects as representing an im- age of power and an ordering of soci- ety. Of course, diagrams don t conjure up states of mind, and barely scratch the surface of cultural understanding. The significance of the pilgrimage as a medi- eval social phenomenon - and there- fore an inkling of the communicative force of pilgrimage churches - is better demonstrated by Chaucer. And no sketches of Elizabethan timber-framed buildings can expose the sensibilities of the people who lived in them and the temperature of the times that embraced them better than Shakespeare can. No one makes Rococo decor and mood more felicitous than Mozart. Purcell's energetic clarity illuminates Wren's. Mondrian's paintings readily expose the presumptions behind De Stiilarchitecture. And so on. The case is easily made for the widest possible cultural immersion on the part of the prospective architect. Nevertheless, the many sketches in Risebero's book do make us aware of the interpretive hand behind them, clari- fying, explicating, discovering, in a way that our passive response to the camera often does not. Another of Risebero's theses goes to the heart of our modernist inheritance: the gradual disjunction of designer and user. One infamous inheritance, the Pruitt-lgoe housing block in St. Louis, was finally put out of its misery by dynamite in 1 972, as Jencks reminds us. (If we want a date and time for the death of modern archi- tecture, he says, this is it.) With it went our faith in the modernists' moral agenda. Corbusier's Unite was, alas, the unfortu- nate progenitor of much urban alien- ation and malaise. Of course the pre- sumptions behind rationalist functional- ism that echo so resoundingly in Vers une architecture are themselves a French in- heritance: the rational positivism of Comte and the 19th century buildings of Labrouste, and before that the 1 8th cen- tury architectural theory of Durand and Rondelet, even back, I suppose, to the rational scepticism of Diderot. But now the gulf between designer and user, theory and practice, must be closed if architecture is to become more humane. A certain adeptness at cultural sensitivi- ties on the part of the postmodern archi- tect might replace some of the usefulness of consultation with the users, but not all of it. Neither might one's immersion in the milieu be as thoroughgoing as Ralph Erskine's was in his buiTding of the Byker housing project in Newcastle England in the early '70s. But his was a landmark move in the right direction. For architecture is, much more than technique, an accommodation of the spirit. With the postmodern recovery of memory has come a recovery of architecture's spiritual purpose. Museums and galleries are the temples of our times. Hans Hollein's M6nchengladbach museum (1972-82) is an 'acropolis', Jencks suggest in the postscript he's added to his latest edition: identifiable in the symbolical ensemble are aspects of temenos, propylaeum, and abstract temple types (with a meandering ap- proach of terraces modulating sacred' and 'secular' space). Similarly proces- sional gestures in relation to the past are established in James Stirling's Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart (1977-84) and by Moshe Safdie's recently opened National Gallery of Art in Ottawa, Canada. The latter involves the visitor in a long processional entrance through a Gothic nave-like space up a ramp,a space that begins with formal references to a Catholic church and ends with a vista of the neo-Gothic Parliament buildings - a veritable synthesis of the country's beginnings. The processional, in fact, seems to me to reveal the central underlying myth of postmodern culture. We worship the holy recovery of memory as a validation of our individual experience in the form of 'story' or 'narrative'. The most successful of the postmodern architects (and writers and artists) engage us directly in this dialogue. And just as individual experi- ence inevitably touches on the universality of the experience, so too the universal or Summer 1990 JAE 43/4 58</page><page sequence="7">archetypical forms (of the so-called "New Abstraction") attempt to register readily recognizable associations even while embracing their particular urban con- texts as a living fabric or cultural con- tinuum. The synthesis is an aspect of our global village: the electronic media may have made us 'cool', but, as Marshall Mcluhan also suggested, it has also made us 'tribal': we are transformed by the immediacy of the moment into a single ritualistic entity. The whole postmodern recovery of the public realm, aided and abetted by classical vocabu- lary, underlines this observation. The real virtue of postmodern pluralism is not the plethora of stylistic categories, but the richness of metaphor and multiplicity of associative meanings that can attach themselves to such a broad range of human experience. Of course, the shopping malls are our mock-processionals - every good and sacred thing has a horrible parody that looks just like it. With their everpresent glass gallerias, copied originally but perversely from Milan's, developed along a private space enclosed by so-called impulse shops and extending between two large department stores, these monuments of modern culture reveal themselves as jeering escapist traps. Machines for spending in. the new Eden (the big prize!) is now winnable by lottery. No holy halls of memory these. But because our experience is both cu- mulative and sequential, the architec- tural mode most solicitous of our deepest intuitive experience is the processional. We are forever entrapped by the boxes of time and perspective - "idols of the cave" Francis Bacon called them. We are congenitally shortsighted: we see only so much of our lives at one time. But our linear, sequential experience, which we long to reckon as progressive, is affected at every turn by the voices of memory. These are the voices that beckon the postmodern embrace. (Processional space, as I have suggested, seems an even more powerful notion when linked with Ungers' transformational grammar of architectural form in a palpable tran- sition from old to new and module to module.) Because the philosophy under- lying the forms of modernism purported to be progressive, moving us towards a utopian ideal abetted by technology, the forms themselves could afford to be static. The glass box and open plan became a sort of architectural code for moral self-improvement. But no longer. The modernist gods have retreated. The postmodern politic, like the postmodern aesthetic, is defined against the center, against the uniform, against the bureau- cratic collective. We seek a new spiritual consensus- more than a metaphysics of "polite ag- nosticism", asJencks calls it. Through the architectural inheritance of classicism is still with us, we've moved beyond the timeless stasis of the Greek pantheon and the Aristotelian polls as a natural given. Yet still we long for the myth of place. We are also far from the Roman legitimizing of the political present in the official rendition of the mythologized past. Yet our desire for a progressive or purposeful notion of time and history lingers on. Neither do we readily appear to be the direct inheritors of Augustine's medieval city in motion, confident in- heritors of sacred history en route to a spiritual destination. Yet a movement towards some kind of state of spiritual recovery underlines all of western cultural experience since Augustine. We now progress towards the unknown, through the experience of the intuition, expressed in our own re-established myths (or 'narrative fictions'). The architecture that doesn't honestly address our postmodern predicament will not be a part of shap- ing who we are. John Greenwood Waterloo, Canada Summer 1990 JAE 43/4 59</page></plain_text>
