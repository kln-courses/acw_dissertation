The proto-historic remains at Ugarit, although less familiar than those of the second millennium B.C.E., are no less important. Two deep trenches, Sondages SC and SH near the Temple of Ba'al on the acropolis, reveal archaeological deposits some 14 m. deep, representing a sequence of occupation from the late Pre-Pottery Neolithic in the late seventh millennium B.C.E. to the post-Halafian (Ubaid) period in the second half of the fifth millennium B.C.E. This stratigraphy makes Ugarit a key site for understanding the cultural developments of the sixth and fifth millennia in Syria. The publication of the final excavation report from Ugarit is thus a most welcome contribution to the archaeology of the Levant. The first excavations of proto-historic Ugarit were carried out in the early 1930s by Schaeffer (C.F.A. Schaeffer [ed.]: Ugaritica I, Paris, 1939, pp. 3-13). Later, in the early 1950s, he conducted</page><page sequence="2">274 REVIEWS further examinations (idem, Les fondements pr?historiques d'Ugarit, in idem [ed.], Ugaritica IV, Paris, 1962, pp. 151-249), as did A. Kuschke (Bericht ?ber eine Sondage im Palastgarten von Ugarit-Ras Shamra, in ibid., pp. 251-299). A basic stratigraphie division into three layers was established for the pre-MB periods: Layers III, IV and V, with a few sub-divisions in each. However, it was only with the involvement of H. de Contenson, who carried out 13 seasons of excavation between 1955 and 1976, that the proto-historic layers at Ugarit became a focus of intensive research. The results of these excavations are presented in the report under review in nine chapters, including five interdisciplinary studies. The first chapter (pp. 11-52) describes the stratigraphy and architecture of the various phases, accompanied by figures, sections and photographs. De Contenson suggests a detailed stratigraphie division into 38 sub-phases within the original Layers III-V. However, unlike Canaanite Ugarit, which has been exposed over very large areas, the proto-historic remains have only been unearthed in deep, narrow trenches. Thus, only limited information could be obtained from each sub-phase, making this a rather theoretical division. The intensive use of absolute heights, usually at regular intervals of 20 cm. or so, seems artificial and arbitrary. The sequence represents the following main cultural phases: a) Late Pre-Pottery Neolithic settlement (second half of seventh millennium B.C.E.); b) Pottery Neolithic (sixth millennium B.C.E.); c) Halafian-Wadi Rabah related settlement (first half of fifth millennium B.C.E.); d) Post-Halafian (Ubaid) settlement (second half of fifth millennium B.C.E.); e) occupational gap (fourth and beginning of third millennia B.C.E.); and f) small EB III site, as indicated by presence of Khirbet Kerak ware. More information on this last period was earlier published by de Contenson (Rapports entre la Palestine et Ras Shamra-Ugarit au Bronze ancien, in P. de Miroschedji [ed.]: L'urbanisation de la Palestine ? l'?ge du Bronze ancien [BAR International Series 527i], Oxford, 1989, pp. 317-329). The dating of this sequence is supported by six reliable C14 dates which verify the archaeological dating. One date from Layer Vc, which predates the other datings from this phase by a millennium, should probably be rejected. The datings were mostly submitted by Schaeffer, and were published in the early 1960s. It is a pity that de Contenson did not obtain additional datings for this outstanding, thick deposit. Another omission of this report is a table summarizing the cultural phases, stratigraphie division, absolute heights and C14 dates. Such a table is appended here for the convenience of readers (Table 1). Chapter 2 (pp. 53-93) presents the sequence of the flint and obsidian industries, with quantitative data in tables and illustrations. The chronological distribution of obsidian is of special interest (Fig. 1), since it corresponds to the pattern observed in the excavations in Israel and Jordan. There is a fair amount of obsidian at the site in Phases Vc (PPNB) and Vb (early Pottery Neolithic); it decreases sharply in Phase Va (corresponding to the Yarmukian and Jericho IX cultures), and increases again in Phase IV (Halafian/Wadi Rabah). In comparison, small quantities of this exotic raw material are found at sites (Jericho, Yiftahel, 'Ain Ghazal) in the seventh millennium B.C.E. (PPNB). As in Ugarit, it disappears almost totally from archaeological record in the second half of the sixth millennum B.C.E., in the Yarmukian and Jericho IX cultures. In the fifth millennium B.C.E. large quantities of obsidian appear at Wadi Rabah sites (Y.

The distribution of obsidian in the various layers at Ugarit. Neolithic and Early Chalcolithic Periods [unpublished Ph.D. diss., The Hebrew University of Jerusalem], Jerusalem, 1992, pp. 57, 133,219). It thus seems that there is a correlation between cultural homogeneity and the movements of exotic raw materials over long distances. In the PPNB and the Halafian-Wadi Rabah phases, when large areas of the Levant share a similar material culture, there are larger quantities of obsidian at various sites than in the second half of the sixth millennium B.C.E., when local regional cultures seem to have been more typical. Chapter 3 (pp. 95-123) presents the various stone vessels and objects. The report does not sufficiently emphasize the extremely important assemblages of stamp seals and engraved stones uncovered at Ugarit. Backed terra-cotta seals are presented separately in Chapter 5 (pp. 136-137), and the stamp seals from Schaeffer's and Kuschke's excavations are not integrated into the report (Schaeffer, op. cit., Ugaritica IV, PL. 11:7; Kuschke, op. cit., p. 286, Fig. 7). Seals decorated with simple geometric patterns are reported from the early part of the sequence, in Phases Vc and Vb (Fig. 125:14-15). Similar patterns are reported on clay stamp seals from Phase Va (Fig. 156:1-2, 16, PI. CXIV:l-2). Phase Vb also produced engraved stones with patterns identical to those from Sha'ar Hagolan (Fig. 126:1, 6-7), and Khirokitia (Fig. 126:13-14). Seals decorated with complex geometric patterns appear in the upper part of the sequence, from Phases IVc and IVb (Figs. 133:15-19, 140:8, 13-17). The appearance of such seals in Phases IVc and IVb suggests that the rich assemblage of stamp seals from Hagoshrim, in the northern Jordan Valley, should be dated to the fifth millennium B.C.E. and not to the fourth millennium, as suggested by H. Keel Leu (Diefruhesten Stempelsiegel Pal?stinas ? von den Anfangen bis zum Ende des 3 Jahrtausends, in O. Keel et al. [eds.]: Studien zu den Stempelsiegeln aus Paliistina/Israel 2 [Orbis Biblicus et Orientalis 88], Freiburg, 1989, pp. 3-38). Chapter 4 (pp. 125-134) presents the bone tool industry, and Chapter 5 (pp. 135-146) the baked clay objects. It is of interest that only very few anthropomorphic or zoomorphic figurines have been uncovered at proto-historic Ugarit. Chapter 6 (pp. 147-186) presents the</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS 277 pottery assemblages, including some quanti tative data and illustrations. Because of its location, Ugarit has connections both with Mesopotamia and with Southern Levant. In Layer Va a few large basins of the Hassuna husking tray type have been discovered, and the Layer IV pottery includes Halafian decorated vessels. This affords an opportunity to re-examine the relation between Wadi Rabah and Halafian pottery. The Wadi Rabah culture has been identified by Kaplan in his excavations in Israel at Wadi Rabah, Teluliyot Batashi and 'Ein el-Jarbah (J. Kaplan: Excavations at Wadi Rabah, IEJ 8 [1958], pp. 149-160). Similar remains have been unearthed at N?olithique Moyen Byblos, among surface finds from the Baqa' in Lebanon and in Kirkbride's excavations at Ard Tulili (D. Kirkbride: Ancient Byblos and the Beqa'a, M?lange de l'universit? Saint-Joseph 45 [1969], pp. 46-53). Ugarit may shed light on the northern boundaries of the Wadi Rabah culture and on its relationship with the Halafian culture of northern Syria. The pottery asemblages from Phase IV at Ugarit are characterised by the appearance of classical Wadi Rabah components, both in shape and decoration. Notable shapes include: flaring rim bowls (Fig. 189:8-12), shallow in-curving bowls (Fig. 195:8-9), shallow bowls with straight walls (Figs. 180, 182:3), massive chalices (Fig. 198:13), stands (Figs. 200:7-9, 201) and bow-rim jars (Figs. 185:5-6, 199:4-5). Examples of Wadi Rabah decoration at Ugarit include: combed decoration, incisions, impressions and plastic decoration (Pis. 130-132, 141 142). At the same time, the pottery assemblage of Layer IV at Ugarit contains classical examples of Halafian decoration, clearly indicating that the Wadi Rabah pottery is contemporary with the Halafian. Chapter 7 (pp. 187-189) presents the metal objects, all from Layer III (Early Bronze Age). Chapter 8 (pp. 191-202) is a general summary, accompanied by an English translation and an abstract. Chapter 9 (pp. 203-224) is devoted to specialised reports: human remains (M. Dupeyron and H. de Contenson), faunal remains (J. Blot and H. de Contenson), pottery petrography (L. Courtois) and pollen analysis (A. Leroi Gourhan). H. de Contenson has devoted most of his field work to the Neolithic period in Syria, conducting large-scale excavations at Tell Ramad, Tell Aswad, Ghoraife and Ugarit. He has published detailed preliminary reports on these projects, usually soon after each field season. Now, with the publication of his final excavation report on Ugarit, we hope that the final reports on the other sites will also appear in the near future. Yosef Garfinkel</page></plain_text>
