Piedras Negras Stela 40 has been among the acknowledged masterworks of Classic Maya sculpture since its discovery in 1921. Morley used the head of the principal figure as a frontispiece to the five volumes of The Inscriptions of Feten (1937-38), devoted a page of volume III to des cribing its discovery, and hailed it as "unquestionably one of the finest examples of Old Empire sculpture ex tant" (1937-38, III, 200, 202), his initial interpretation of its subject matter has been challenged only once in the literature, by Tatiana Proskouriakoff as the result of her bahnbrechenden assertion of the historicity of the Classic Maya inscriptions. Morley's interpretation of the scene on Stela 40 was of a maize-cultivation ritual: "The design ... seems to be intimately connected with the cultivation of corn - a presentation of a maize deity possibly, conceived in anthropomorphic form, who may be engaged in sowing grains of corn ... on the original half a dozen can be easily distinguished as small round dots or low circular ele vations". On the upper register "a magnificently sculpted figure kneels, facing to the right.From the right hand fall grains of corn while the left holds a small bag or pouch from which presumably they have been taken... Above the head rises an enormous conventionalised ear of corn, the individual kernels showing clearly along the upper margin of the ear, while from its lower end emerge stands of corn silk. Conventionalised leaves of corn are fasten ed by triple knots to what looks like a rope passing down the left margin... to the headdress of the lower figure, passes behind this and below the throne or plat form on which the planting figure kneels, and finally disappears behind the nose of the lower figure, or per haps even comes out of it. "Below the upper figure the grains of corn fall on to the head and shoulders of a somewhat larger figure fa cing... the left ... cut off at the breast by an object with two legs upon which it rests and holds in the right 77</page><page sequence="2">hand a bunch of feathers which fall gracefull over the There is nothing in the iconography of the scene to side of the legged support from which the head and support this somewhat arcane interpretation, and it has shoulders rise...

I would like to suggest yet legged support is nothing more than a throne such as a third notion of what the scene on Stela 40 depicts, is shown on the piers of House C at Palenque, where the one which links with Proskouriakoff's overall view of supports of the throne have similar circular depressions, the Piedras Negras monuments as showing dynastic rituals: Graved on the side of the throne is the symbol for zero while Stela 11, the initial monument in Proskouriakoff's or completion.

(Morley, 1937 38, III, 203, excerpted). two regisbers, upper and lower, by a rectangular block running three-quarters of the way across the recessed panel from the (viewer's) right-hand side, but linked by the twisted "rope" with projecting elements up the left margin, the two registers are clearly intended to be seen as a single composition, as both Morley and Proskouriakoff infer. The upper figure, kneeling and seen in left profile, wears an elaborate head-dress, of which the most striking feature is a lace-like projection rising forwards from within the tall circlet that surmounts the figure's head. This is the "conventionalised ear of corn" recognised by Morley, but his recognition of "kernels along the upper margin of the car" and indeed his identification of the device as a maize cob at all must be ascribed to wishful thinking, and an a priori conviction that the figure was scattering grains of maize. The openwork design, with a fret-like motif solid against the background, seems more charac teristic of a textile such as cotton, and the fold clearly depicted at the base of the projection reinforces this. The stiffness of the fabric could have been ob tained with a generous dose of vegetable starch from a tuber such as manioc (Karen 0. Bruhns, 1977). The "strands of corn silk" identified by Morley are more easily interpreted as the hair of the figure, pulled up through the circlet and streaming down his back. The sculptural convention used for the hair is found on numerous other monuments. Some of the hair at the back of the neck seems to have been pulled through a large tubular bead, presumably meant to be of jade; the circlet, the detailed design of which needs not concern us here, also seems to feature jade elements and the figure wears an impressive ear-ornament with a long projecting bead, again presumably of jade, to gether with a massive bead necklace. Although Morley calls the figure "very simply clad" (1937-38, III, 203), he is in fact richly accoutred. The belt sup porting an effigy head and a set of jade hanging plaques on his back also holds up a richly-worked apron hanging to mid-thigh. The costume is completed by large wristlets and anklets made of multiple rows of beads, and by a maxtli seen only in a slight pro jection at the back of the thigh. Overall, the basic outfit of maxtli, necklace, wristlets and anklets common to many depictions of rulers is in this case augmented by the unique headdress and the unusual apron, items which we could consider specific to the activity in which the figure is engaged. It is common ground between Morley, Proskouriakoff and myself that this activity is the scattering of small round grains or nodules with the right hand, down on to the figure in the lower register; we all assume that the nodules have been taken from the cylindrical fringed bag held in the left hand. Morley's assumption was that these were kernels of maize; Pros kouriakoff identifies them merely as 'grains'; my proposal is that they are nodules of copal incense. Morley's idea of corn being ritually sown in an offering This type of bag has for some years been identified to a chthonic deity has been generally accepted by as a copal bag, while the scattering of small circular scholars, including Thompson (1967, Plate 10, b)\ an nodules into a brazier on Nim Ii punit Stelae 2 and 15 alternative, political, interpretation was suggested by (Hammond, 1976a, b) suggests the use of copal. Nim Ii Proskouriakoff (1960, 463): Stela 40 "shows a bust of punit Stela 14 has a single figure scattering similar one figure on a throne, and another figure on the cano- nodules, but lacking the brazier and accompanying py above, scattering grains. What seems to be suggested figures of the other two monuments: since this is a is some delegation of power, perhaps a temporary sub- very narrow stela in spite of its height of 9.50 m servience to a foreign potentate, perhaps an acting head this is unsurprising, and the identification of copal of government appointed to carry on the functions of an can stand by association (as it can also, perhaps, on incapacitated ruler." Seibal Stela 19). A reexamination of the "scattering" 78</page><page sequence="3">motif in Maya art is overdue, and a critical evaluation in terms of copal rather than maize kernels or water droplets being represented would be most valuable; I suggest that the "hand-scattering" glyph (T 710) in particular is likely to refer to copal, either ideo graphically or phonetically or both, but have no in tention of dipping my toe in those deep epigraphic waters at present. The figure in the lower register, on to whom the copal descends and to whom it is presumably being offered, is larger in scale than the upper one, in right profile and visible only from the middle of the chest upwards. He wears a headdress composed of a head-piece apparently depicting a monster (?saurian or crocodilian), with a top knot from which sprays a panache of feathers. His neck lace is massive, of alternating tubular and spherical beads, and his ear-ornaments have projecting tubular beads. The right wristlet, although damaged, can be seen to have multiple strands; the right hand holds a bunch of feathers wrapped in a plain holder, a not uncommon object in Maya art which Elizabeth Benson (lecture in Miami, 1977) suggests is a fan or fly-whisk marking high status. The face, although damaged, is a normal human profile, and the entire outfit of the figure is also consonant with his being human rather than divine: there are no marks of deity upon him, and were he to stand erect he could take his place on typical stela without comment. We have, therefore, one high-status human, assumed to be the ruler who erected the Series 4 stelae at Piedras Negras, offering copal incense to a second high-status human in some lower region. I suggest that this lower region is a funeral vault, seen in schematic cross section, with the living ruler kneeling in the temple above it. The lower figure rises from what both Morley and Pros kouriakoff describe as a "throne", Morley specifically because of its legs with their circular depressions which are paralleled at Palenque. The "throne" is, how ever, specifically shown as being hollow:, the right wristlet and hand of the figure are cut by its upper edge, and a decorated fringed cloth (not remarked upon by Morley or Proskouriakoff) hangs over the edge, partly obscuring the quadrilobate design on the side of the "throne". Rather than a throne or platform with a trun cated figure perched uncomfortably on its top - an aesthetic solecism unequalled in Classic Maya official art - this scene shows a sarcophagus with its occupant rising to receive the offering of copal. The twisted "rope" with its triple "bow-tie" motifs, beginning as Morley notes at the nostrils of the lower figure and turning upwards and backwards to rise verti cally up left edge of the upper register, in front of the kneeling figure, may support this contention: the leaf-like elements seen by Morley as conventionalised maize leaves can equally well be interpreted as symbols for "breath", and the upper termination of the "rope" in a sky-band forming the top of the stela ties to gether the tomb, the living world of the upper register, and the eternal world of the heavens. Just such a con ceit has been identified in the Postclassic murals at Tulum by Arthur Miller (1974) for the "umbilical cord" motif: the twisted nature of the "rope" on Stela 10 suggests a similar iconographic intention. A second and equally apposite parallel is the "sipapu" or "spirit tube" found in the Temple of the Inscriptions at Palenque, linking the tomb of Pacal to the world above. If this funerary interpretation of the lower register is accepted, then the architecture seen in section on the right hand side of the sculpture is that of the sub terranean vault, although the significance of the finely hatched designs on its side eludes me, and the "canopy" identified by Proskouriakoff becomes the floor of the temple or the ground surface of the living world. Although several motives for offering copal to a person in a tomb could no doubt be suggested, by far the most obvious is the veneration of an ancestor, deified or not, and particularly a royal predecessor. I suggest that the theme of Piedras Negras Stela 40 is the filial and dynastic respect paid by the ruler at the 9.15.15.0.0. hotun to his inmediate forebear or pars pro toto to the dead members of the dynasty: the "odor of the center of heaven" (Roys, 1931, 278) would be a suitable offering.

Die Piedras Negras S+ele 40, die lange als Darstellung eines Mais-Opferrituals ge genüber einer Erdgottheit interpretiert wurde, zeigt wohl eher das Darbringen von WeihrauchkopaI-KügeIchen für einen verstorbenen Vorfahren. Der Ahne erhebt sich aus dem Sarkophag in einem Grabgewölbe. Er ist mit seinem Nachkommen, dem Herrscher von Piedras Negras, durch eine geflochtene Schnur verbunden, was eine Verbindung durch Nabelschnur und durch sipapu darstellen könnte. Diese Interpretation steht im Einklang mit jüngsten Entdek kungen wie bei den Nim Li Punit-Monumenten und mit Be legen über die Ahnen-Verehrung bei den klassischen Maya. Resumen: pom para los antepasados. La estela 40 de Piedras Negras fue interpretada por mucho tiempo como la representación de un ritual de ofrenda de maTz frente a una deidad de la tierra. Sin embargo, ella muestra más bien la ofrenda de bolitas de copal a un antepasado muerto. Este se levanta del sarcófago dentro de una cripta. El está unido a su descendiente, el sobreano de Piedras Negras, mediante un cordón trenzado. Este podría representar la conexión a través del cordón umbilical y del sipapu. Esta interpretación concuerda, por un lado, con descubrimientos muy recientes como por ejemplo en los monumentos de Nim Li Punit y, por otro lado, con evidencias sobre el culto de antepasados en la época de los mayas clásicos.</page></plain_text>
