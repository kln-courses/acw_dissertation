<plain_text><page sequence="1">Psychology of Religion: Guidelines for Priests, Ministers, Religious Educators, and Parents" By K. Helmut Reich Introduction This essay attempts to assist priests, ministers, religious educators, parents, etc. in their difficult task to stimulate, "transmit", and support a healthy re ligious faith. A healthy religion is defined as one that contributes to the de velopment of human potential, makes for the physical and psychic health of its believers, strengthens relationships and social cohesion. For Christians, such a religion is based on the Bible. However, given already the multitude of narratives in Scripture, its messages call for interpretation. To stay healthy in a changing environment, that interpretation has to change with changing cir cumstances and insights. Traditionally, such a task falls to the Church and its theologians. Thus, Thomas Aquinas integrated the various insights of his time in the summa theologiae. Unfortunately, with the progress of the new, inductive science, its new insights (e.g., of Galileo, of Darwin) were no longer fully integrated into the views of the Church. Although efforts toward a bet ter integration are noted (e.g., Bouma-Prediger, 1995; Cole-Turner &amp; Waters, 1996; Dorschner, Heller &amp; Pannenberg, 1995; Hefner, 1993; Polkinghorne, 1996; Russel, Stoeger &amp; Coyne, 1988; Schwarz, 1988-1999; SSTh, 1993-1999; Zygon, 1966-1999), this state has not yet been achieved. Hence, more indi viduals are called upon to contribute to that task. In my attempt I take up a middle position between positivism and post-modernism (Reich, 1995). Whenever new convincing evidence is brought to light, might the present guidelines need to be changed. Among other things, the task envisaged calls for a partial rephrasing and reinterpretation of the biblical writings, which originated roughly 2'000 to 3'000 years ago. At that time, the world population was probably below 250 million, 80 per cent of humankind wrung their livelihood from the land, communication was mainly by word of mouth, trade and commerce were es sentially centred on local markets, travel - a rare, risky enterprise - on land was by foot or by riding an animal, almost all weapons were muscle-powered and enabled one to kill in close contact only. The worldview was that of an unchanging universe created by God(s). In fact, higher powers were believed A first version was presented at the Conference on Religion, Magic and Healing or ganized by the International Association for Psychology and History of Religion, Aarhus, 21-24 May 1998.</page><page sequence="2">Psychology of Religion 279 not only to have been active at the origin, but also to play a major role in the world's day-to-day affairs. Divine commandments had to be observed indi vidually and collectively, if major disasters were to be avoided. Also, the con cepts of personal identity and right to privacy in the modern sense had not yet been conceived. In fact, with everyone being imbedded in an extended family and a tightly-knit tribe with fairly homogenous religious, moral, and social practices, there was no need for, and little stimulus towards, an aware ness of such issues. In 1999, in contrast the situation is vastly different. We are approaching 6000 million humans, in our industrialized countries only a small percentage of the population are farmers / peasants, the media on a global scale inform everybody immediately about what is going on world-wide, merchandise can be ordered from anywhere to anywhere via the World Wide Web, long-dis tance return air-travel has become a common routine, we have long-distance weapons of mass destruction, and the reigning worldview is that of an evolv ing universe resulting from the Big Bang, cosmic evolution, and Darwinian selection. God's perceived role in the day-to-day affairs of the world - if any (Reich, 1997b) - is no longer so clear. For instance, there is talk of a self-lim iting God. While God's commandments are still important to many persons, the relative numbers of those believers have diminished, and the Zeitgeist hardly supports their beliefs, at least not in industrialized Western countries. As regards today's individuals, well-known key words are "individualiza tion" (e.g., Anderson, 1997), "self-supported development", "bricolage relig ion", "spirituality" (which is not necessarily tied to a religious doctrine or to membership of a religious community - e.g., Brown &amp; Furlong, 1996; Reich, Oser &amp; Scarlett, 1999). These are no arguments against a healthy religion, of course. It just makes the task we are discussing a little harder. The Nature of Change: Filiation vs. Substitution Much of this essay is about change: (1) Change that took place from bibli cal times until today, and which needs to be taken into account when one in terprets the biblical message, but also (2) change in individuals growing up in present times (ontogeny). While in those two domains there are some paral lels between the respective changes regarding their content (particularly worldviews, e.g., Reich, 1997d), that is not the primary focus here. Rather, two types of change are discussed, each of which pertains to both domains, in particular to knowledge acquisition and to interpretations of various kinds. By "filiation" I follow Jean Piaget in denoting a step-by-step, cumulative extension / development of an original notion or approach, which takes place without a fundamental break. Ontogenetic examples are (1) a child's develop ing, ever wider grasping of the term "family" as the understanding grows from a family comprising parents and siblings, to one including grandparents,</page><page sequence="3">280 K. Helmut Reich uncles, aunts, and first cousins, and on to more distant relatives, or (2), in a different register, how the notion of "money" developed and develops from meaning coins, to include bank notes, checks, credit cards, etc. In contrast, "substitution" means to replace, or at least to restrict severely, a once generalized concept or method. Examples are (1) an infant's move from the ever-present oral mode of exploring the nature of things, to touch ing, experimenting and observing the result or (2), again in a different regis ter, the replacement of the anthropomorphic white-bearded God of child hood days by a non-figurative God who is a life-giving force. Similarly and not surprisingly, we already find continuity and change in biblical times. An example of continuity is the commandment to love one's neighbour as oneself (Leviticus 19:18 and Mark 12:31, par). Filiation in that case would mean to extend the meaning of "neighbour" from those living close by to those further away, to all of humanity, and on to all of nature (e.g., Maillard, 1997). Such a filiation may actually involve a severe unlearning in a first step as illustrated by the progression of the following two biblical texts: From (1) "Happy shall they be who take the little ones [infants] and dash them against the rock!" (Psalm 137:9, NRSV throughout) to (2) "Father forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing" (Luke 23:34). In the first case (written during the Babylonian captivity), "neighbours" are one's own people only; it is right and proper to kill one's enemies, including their children. In the second case, even people who wronged Jesus are his "neighbours". Clearly, it is to be expected that a filiation is much harder to achieve when such "unlearning" is involved over against a simple extension into "neutral" territory.1 In the partial rephrasing and reinterpreting of biblical texts the question arises of whether filiation or substitution is called for. The latter is clearly more painful and risky, more apt to cause antagonisms and divisions e.g., when Jesus' crucifixion (and resurrection) is not interpreted as a kind of scapegoat sacrifice required by a "law of justice" in order to settle humanity's 1 If there is need for further examples in order to appreciate the "naturalness" of even drastic change, look at the evolution of the universe (e.g., Bresch, 1995). Whereas the nu clear synthesis of elements heavier that lithium required the high temperatures and high pressures found in the cores of the stars, evolution of life from complex molecules contain ing those products is thought to have required initially an environment of comparatively modest temperatures and pressures, and also lightning and ultraviolet light. Once life had arrived, the latter forced it into the water from which it could only emerge after the ozone layer had grown thick enough to filter sufficiently the deadly ultraviolet radiation. That life-saving layer could only arise because early (relative) dominance of methane had been replaced by that of oxygen, bringing with it new species and annihilating old ones. Whereas during roughly the first two thousand million years of animal life the reign of sin gle-cell organisms was based on rapid cell division, subsequently, in multicell organisms, rapid cell division (cancer) became deadly. Finally, instincts served and serve many animals to survive, but in the case of homo sapiens the well-developed brain potentially decides more wisely, particularly in changed circumstances.</page><page sequence="4">Psychology of Religion 281 account, but as a voluntary self-offering in tune with the "law of solidarity" (e.g., Varone, 1985). Given the potential difficulties arising from substitution, priests, ministers, religious educators and parents should attempt to avoid the need for later sub stitution whenever reasonably possible. Specifically, children should not be taught "facts", explanations, or behaviours that are "obviously" counterfac tual; they will find out sooner or later, jettison as a matter of course what they were taught and lose trust in the adult. (However, telling appropriate fairy tales and other children's stories, which have stood the test of time, can be beneficial). In cases where substitution is unavoidable, like for the God image, the persons named should consciously assist and support the growing child to make the transition to the new, substituted view at the opportune time. Following the spirit and the letter of the present guidelines may not be an easy task and perhaps even lead to disputes and worse. Let me illustrate this by the following example of an interchange between one of our students at Fribourg and a lecturing Catholic priest who worked with HIV-positive ho mosexuals: ["How do you deal with the use of condoms, given the Vatican's opposition?"] "I think that I know more about the [beneficial] effects of con doms for the people I work with than the Holy Father; so I recommend them." That priest took it upon himself that sooner or later he might be asked by his superiors to justify such a statement with consequences not nec essarily beneficial for his future activities. - As could be shown easily by way of examples from many walks of life, reason and good will unfortunately do not always win the day, far from it. This may be especially true when wres tling with enslaving "religious" organizations. Yet, I believe that it is worth while to try again and again. The ensuing considerations on our theme come in three parts: (1) religion and health; (2) religious development; (3) concluding remarks. The input will be mainly from psychology of religion, but also from psychology in general, and from other sciences. A caveat: In presenting these considerations, I am aware that they are addressed to individuals and concern, above all, their in teraction with other individuals. Even if those interactions were at an opti mum according to the present considerations, there remain wider influences of the (religious) cultural environment with its rites, its symbolisms, etc., in fluences which may be all the harder to change, if desirable in case of a nega tive effect, as they may act at an unconscious or preconscious level. Religion and Health In what ways can a healthy religion, as already defined, contribute to indi vidual and societal health? The short answer is: "by way of instigating and supporting healthy beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours." When considering the changes indicated above since the Bible was written, a first need for "substitu</page><page sequence="5">282 K. Helmut Reich tion" in the interest of humanity's health comes to mind in connection with Genesis 1:28 ("Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves on the earth.") The first part of that command ment has been achieved, even overachieved (e.g., Ehrlich &amp; Ehrlich, 19902). Thus at least the "multiply" can no longer be understood numerically. As to the second part, dominion clearly cannot be meant to involve extermination, but rather "stewardship". Altogether a certain humbleness, at least vis-à-vis nature, seems to be called for in the interest of long-term survival. Maybe in that respect we could learn something from the ways of the bushmen, the Inuit, or similar people. As to particular points about ancient biblical rules of dietetics and hygiene, should they not be replaced when well-established cur rent scientific knowledge now considers them harmful? Not to sound too negative: it seems clear that an appropriate religion, and in particular praying, can improve physical health, and even contribute to healing serious illness (e.g., Benson, 1996; Byrd, 1988; Gardner, 1986; Koenig, 1997, ch. 6; Murken, 1997, 166; Utsch, 1998). So much for the more physical side. As for the mental side, a basic issue is whether a person should base his or her life entirely on his or her own command, transfer some command and re sponsibility to a particular group or to society as a whole, or whether the ac ceptance of a "collégial" transcendent power can be healthier in that a dis tancing from oneself and from various societal demands, and a dialogue (in prayer) are facilitated (e.g., Fowler, 1982, 1996). How far can the ego's efforts at self-grounding be successful? How far does self-vindication go? Can that approach really face the void, the dark side of human existence? To ask an even more radical question: Is life without relationships and interchange pos sible at all? What has psychology of religion to say in that respect? As a review of the more recent literature (e.g., Gardner, 1986; Koenig, 1997; Murken, 1997, 1998; Paloutzian &amp; Kirkpatrick, 1995; Schumaker, 1992) easily shows, there is as yet no consensus as to the beneficial effects of religion for mental health or otherwise. Part of the reason are the fuzzy definitions of re ligion and of mental health, as well as not infrequently inadequate methods of measurement. Furthermore, a study of the nature of the interaction with the divine and the social environment is often neglected, although that interaction is rather important for development and (mental) health (e.g., Heydayat-Diba, 1997; Kegan, 1994; Murken, 1998). Thus, religion is sometimes still measured simply as church attendance, etc. In actual fact, religion and health "are both multifaceted constructs, and the empirical relationships between them prove to be highly complex" (Paloutzian &amp; Kirkpatrick, 1995,1). 2 Even if the Ehriichs sometimes have a tendency to be overly pessimistic, they have at least looked at issues not infrequently swept under the carpet by politicians and the media.</page><page sequence="6">Psychology of Religion 283 Focusing on what is relevant for my argument, I should now go into the details of mental health, of coping, of substance abuse, of depression and sui cide, of social issues such as child and wife abuse, etc., relating each element to the specific effects of various religions or at least denominations, perhaps even to esoteric movements, or maybe to religious attitudes and God images, and ideally separately for adolescents, the aged, women, etc. Given restric tions of space and my own research orientation (toward religious develop ment), I can only refer anybody interested to the literature indicated and the further references listed there. Here I shall simply abstract some guidelines from the research just referred to. In what follows, I engage, although not ex clusively, in a friendly dialogue with Sebastian Murken (1997). Murken (1997, 168-169) lists six points of criticism about religion to the effect that it limits human potential, and therefore is not good for mental health. Rather than taking such a perspective, I shall take the six headings and try to formulate positive guidelines. Cognition: Given the lack of consensus on many important issues in our postmodern society, for instance concerning the environment including en ergy use, birth control, extent of social services, combating unemployment, or even the nature of the human self (e.g., Anderson, 1987), it is not easy to avoid cognitive dissonances. One possible way out is to analyze each issue and to match the thought form chosen (formal, dialectic, complementarist, etc. - Reich, 1997a; 1999) to the "structure" of the issue. That requires knowledge, effort, and probably also a supportive community for carrying on Socratic dialogues. In some cases, the result may be to live with the disso nances until the understanding of the issue in question has deepened. In other cases, an extensive study may lead to a decision on the most desirable course of action. In yet other cases, the initial discrepancies, and even contradictions, may give way to an overarching synopsis or even theory, which makes them appear in a new light as different aspects of the same entity or event. The es sential point is to go on searching for a solution with an open mind (e.g., Feynman, 1998). If an analogy for at least part of what I mean is needed, let me refer to Ein stein's special theory of relativity: If a particular event, e.g. the duration of a light signal is timed (1) by a close bystander and (2) by an observer moving at a good fraction of the speed of light, then the respective results differ. However, knowing the speed of motion of the second observer, the second measurement can be transformed via the appropriate equation into the first. Correspondingly, my notion is that at least in some cases (though certainly not in all) a consensus could be found if competent persons of good will would spend sufficient time and effort to find the particular "transformation equation(s)" which would transform the particular perspectives into each other. At least such a search may discover functional equivalents, common categories, or even shared principles. Given the potentially negative effects of cognitive dissonances (e.g., the discrediting of early claims of heliocentrism</page><page sequence="7">284 K. Helmut Reich from the perspective of the established geocentrism), even large efforts to find a satisfactory explanation of "contradictions" are justified. Yet, as we all know, in certain (extreme) cases, no solution may come forth in the short term - patience is needed. Unfortunately, in religion, there are serious blockages to such a search. In the Roman Catholic church, the magisterium formally decides what is correct thought. On the Protestant side, a first reaction is to separate into different denominations or even sects whenever a new religious thought arises. The guideline here would be clearly to take a distancing position only after other options have been discussed openly and sympathetically with all concerned, and thought about in depth (cf. Boulard, 1§97). Emotions and feelings: No consensual psychological theory of emotions seems to exist (e.g., Bischof, 1989; Scherer et al., 1990; Ulich &amp; Mayring, 1992). I start from the more or less obvious assumptions (cf. Reich, 1992b, 50-52) that (1) emotions, in particular more complex ones, and cognitions are intertwined (e.g., Bearison &amp; Zimiles, 1986), and (2) that positive feelings (like joy, inspiration, hope, the experience of being part of a community, feel ing good about oneself) contribute to mental health. Consequently, a healthy religion should foster such feelings rather than their negative counterparts (sadness, boredom, despair, solitude, a feeling of personal worthlessness). Yet let us not forget the positive aspects for ultimate well-being of fasting, repen tance, penitence, forgiveness, humility. However, those remarks are not an advocacy of limitless emotional experimentation. As Paul of Tarsus already wrote, "'All things are lawful for me', but not all things are beneficial. 'All things are lawful for me', but I will not be dominated by anything" (1 Corin thians 6:12; cf. 10:23). As with many things in life, it is often a matter of bal ance, here of experimenting without limit vs. not experimenting at all. A healthy religious community can be of help in that regard. Clearly, one of the established findings is that being part of it leads to less substance abuse (e.g., Gorsuch, 1995). Agency and s elf-efficacy: A person who attributes to him/herself adequate agency and self-efficacy, who feels that he or she controls his or her own life as much as is humanly possible, is likely to be in better mental health than a person at the other end of those scales. Hence a religion supporting such at tributions in a reasonable way is likely to contribute to mental health (e.g., Murken, 1998, 56-64). Of course, that does not mean to suggest dreams of superpower or invincibility because "God is with us". As before, a certain humility may be a preferable attitude, "If I do not understand this event, God knows why he/she sends it", or even, "God does not always seem to as sume full control (e.g., Auschwitz), but God will stay with me/us." Relationships: A free choice in one's relationships is deemed to be an im portant ingredient for mental health. In our culture many hurdles (racism, sexism, etc.) to such a freedom have been lessened. A religion which would want to go back on that development, for instance by insisting on the sever</page><page sequence="8">Psychology of Religion 285 ance of all contacts with "heretics", may not further mental health, at least not in the long run. As already indicated, the objective should rather be to widen the horizon with regard as to who my neigbour is. Behaviour: To find one's identity, a certain amount of experimenting is in dispensable (e.g., Scharfetter, 1991, 31), and this calls for a certain freedom of action. Those actions may be opposed to each other, like being involved in group activities, and being on one's own. A religion which sets too strict lim its on behavioural variation may lead to a foreclosure of identity develop ment over against a self-made, achieved identity. What was said about balance in regard to emotions and feelings applies, mutatis mutandis, to behaviour. Consciousness: This is a particularly tricky issue. To what extent is it healthy to transcend the everyday consciousness of common sense? By its very nature, religion, and even "non-religious" spirituality, will lead to some transcending, and that can be a defense against the tyranny of the current "correct thought". However, if the sense of reality becomes impaired (as seemingly in some sects that experienced mass suicide), the process of tran scending went too far. Where is the limit (cf. Utsch, 1998)? No general an swer seems possible; it may vary from person to person, and from culture to culture (e.g., Anderson, 1997; Kegan, 1994). It must also be said that despite much writing not too much is known as yet about the relation of the brain to consciousness, in particular its higher reaches (e.g., Baars, 1997; Ramachdran &amp; Blakeslee, 1998). Given the intensity- of current research efforts in that area, maybe it will be possible to say more in the not too distant future. Religious Development Once more, no consensual, all-encompassing psychological theory of relig ious development exists (e.g., Heimbrock, 1998; Reich, 1992a, 1993a; Paloutzian, 21996, chs. 4 &amp; 5). The main theoretical approaches may be classed as phenomenology/hermeneutics (Beizen, 1997; Briod, 1989), depth psychology (Wulff, 21997, ch. 6 to 9), and others, in particular "cognitive" approaches (Hood et al., 21996, chs. 2 to 4). Again, anybody interested in de tails should consult the literature. What was said above about cognitive disso nance, presumably also applies to existing theories: intense work needs to be continued (e.g., Reich 1993b/1997) for deeper insights to be reached. Here I discuss some common misunderstandings concerning "cognitive" theories, and present a broadly sketched picture of general and religious development from childhood to young adulthood, from which guidelines can be abstracted (cf. Reich, 1992b; 1994 ). The misunderstandings concern stage-type theories of religious develop ment, in particular those of James W. Fowler (1981, 1987, 1996), and of Fritz K. Oser (Oser &amp; Gmünder, 1991; Oser &amp; Reich, 1996). Two not infrequent [mistaken] criticisms are that (1) by reducing religious development largely to</page><page sequence="9">286 K. Helmut Reich cognitive development à la Piaget such theories falsify it; and (2) the insis tence on a limited number of stages reminds one of the story of the Pro custean' bed, into which persons of different height were forced without pity even if they did not fit in. It is true that in the original theories not too much was said about emo tions, in particular not by Oser. However, (a) it has always been clear (see above and, e.g., Piaget, 1954/1981) that there are no pure cognitions without emotions, and no pure emotions without cognitions (though perhaps some diffuse feelings). More recently, those interrelations have been researched ex plicitly in regard to Oser's theory by Anita Kager (1995) and Hartmut Beile (1998, 1999); at a given stage of religious development certain emotions (but not all) seem to arise more frequently than others, (b) Oser (31993) insists that his theory of religious judgement is only one component of a triad de scribing religious development, the other two components being "religious knowledge" (a finding also known from other studies) and "religious experi ence". The latter in particular involves emotions. Finally, I agree with the fol lowing view of Sebastian Murken (1998, 47): " Altogether it turns out that the conceptualization of religiousness depends to a high degree on (limited) theo retical considerations and research objectives and that it is probably not pos sible to determine the general dimensionality of religiousness. From the point of view of psychology, it is hence important to conceptualize and operation alize partial aspects according to the specifics of the respondents, their relig ious denomination, and researchers' psychological interest (cognition, emo tion, behaviour, relationships)." As for the fit between stage descriptions and individual development, Thomas Bernhard Seiler and Siegfried Hoppe-Graff (1989) differentiate be tween "genealogy" (the individual, successive cognitive structures - cf. Briod, 1989), "sequence" (the succession of generalized cognitive structures charac teristic for a given group of individuals or an age class), and "stage" (a se quence of abstracted structural levels - second order structures useful for re constructing the general developmental "logic" in a given domain). Thus the stage descriptions are not meant to correspond closely to individual develop ment with its specific episodes and accidents, but merely to indicate some general milestones in a particular development. But now to some frequently observed features of general and religious de velopment. The objective is not to distil out a set of universal characteristics, but to discover the essential or invariant features of a child's developing world, the opening of new horizons (biologically and culturally) (Briod, 1989). The general idea of child development "connotes a changing and dy namic life, one that progresses from simpler and relative 'immature' levels of behavior and experience toward more and more complex stages of growth" (ibid., p. 117), and "an increasing sense of responsibility for, and control over [one's] own lived existence" (ibid., p. 124). Kindly note that in speaking about developmental stages, I maintain the proviso made above as to the very</page><page sequence="10">Psychology of Religion 287 notion. In describing them, I shall also refer to Piaget's stages of logico mathematical thinking (Piaget, 1970), because of their influence on religious development, - as that on the worldview, which is related in turn to religious development. Although Piaget's findings and his interpretations of them have been much criticized, major overall characterizations of children's and adoles cents' development remain true (Goswami, 1998, ch. 8): babies and infants learn mainly by doing (cf. Fowler, 1996, ch. 1); their actions explore relation ships which can later be put into words and (logical) reasoning. Until about the age of 7 (with falling tendency from about 5 years onward) children live pretty much in their own world, characterized in particular by their own "logic" and epistemology. This includes: (1) their egocentricity, which leads them to infer "objective" states-of-af fairs or norms from their personal situation, views or experiences in a way not infrequently unacceptable to adults, e.g., "because I eat and drink, God too eats and drinks"; "because humans are too small to build high-rise build ings, God has done that for them"; "because I wear a red sweater, the red sweet is for me!" (cf. Koehler, 1997, p. 296-300) - also, they prefer pictures on the grounds of closeness to their life-world (pets, colours, etc.); (2) a belief in magic and other supernatural powers and events (no diffi culty with Genesis 1-2) as well as the capacity to live in two worlds, (a) a fairy-tale world, in which almost all is possible (and which accounts for the marvelous inventiveness of the age group under discussion), and (b) in the real world of adults, to which belongs (as discovered lately) their under standing of the differences between making a mistake, pulling somebody's leg, and consciously deceiving a person (from about four years onward), in dicating a sense of ordering and even theorizing, which is also apparent in learning to speak, which involves not just imitating but also idiosyncratic constructions, even theorizing - not to say philosophizing; (3) certain conceptions almost unimaginable for present-day adults such as (a) the asserted dependence of the actual quantity of coins from their spatial distances, of the mass of plasticine from its form, the volume of a liquid from the shape of its container, etc.; (b) the notion of the Earth as flat (or even as a hollow sphere), which in one way or another needs to be kept from "falling down" (e.g., Reich, 1997d); (c) a representation of the sky as a solid firma ment from which the sun, the moon, and the stars are hung up (ibid.); (d) an image of God as the anthropomorphic maker of all there is, including arti facts which adults ascribe to human activity; (4) an uncritical syncretism which becomes apparent in the "simultaneous" affirmation of statements which for adults are incompatible, e.g.: "Eve was the first woman on Earth" and later, "her mother ...". From about age 7 onwards, children master more and more of Piaget's (1970) concrete operations, that is they can handle two concrete dimensions and elucidate their relationships. That includes recognizing the constancy of number, mass, and volume, and justifying it; ordering a number of things</page><page sequence="11">288 K. Helmut Reich concurrently according to two parameters (such a form and colour); and cor rectly executing basic logical operations such as inferring simple conclusions from the premises. When children's worldviews indicated above (e.g., flat Earth) clash with those of adults (e.g., spherical Earth), children will not sim ply accept adults' views if given the possibility of exploring such clashes on their own, but work on their own views, explore the differences, improve their own, and finally get to the adults' views, provided they involve under standable experiences. Given a satisfactory mental development, formal operations are mastered by reflective abstraction in a process of filiation increasingly from age 11-12 onwards3; persons of that age can solve problems formally in their head (i.e. without manipulating concrete objects), they can formulate hypotheses in possibility space and test them in reality space; they use that new competence to construct a realistic conceptualization of their biophysical and social sur roundings. Correspondingly, their preference is now, among other things, for "realistic" pictures. That (potentially overrated) newly gained reasoning ca pacity may have the consequence that every narrative (like Genesis 1-2) which is judged "logically" unacceptable, will be jettisoned. From later ado lescence onward, at least some persons will reflect on reasoning itself, "Can one know this altogether?"; "How do I know whether this is true?", etc. (e.g., Reich, Oser, &amp; Valentin, 1994). As regards the development of knowledge structures and concepts, two trends may be discerned in particular: (1) from the "surface" to the "inte rior", more exactly from the external aspects that meet the eye to the genu inely defining aspects ("Now I know that my uncle is not the family friend who often brings gifts, but the little son of my grandma"); and (2) from sim ple descriptions/ explanations to complex ones (from a savings bank merely as a keeper of savings to being also a lender, and on to a system existing on account of the differential in interest rates for deposits and loans). Implication for Religious Education What is the relation between what was said so far and stimulating, "trans mitting", and supporting a healthy religious faith based on the Bible? The idea is that long term success is only possible if the developments indicated are taken into account, and even rendered possible. As already said, this ap plies more strongly to "unnatural" substitutions than to filiation. In fact, the evolution of the worldview and of religious concepts proceeds largely by substitution, not filiation: from the flat earth and the solid firmament above, with heaven just beyond, to an unimaginably vast, expanding universe filled Roughly half the adults master formal operations.</page><page sequence="12">Psychology of Religion 289 with zillions of galaxies, from an all-powerful, all-knowing anthropomorphic God in heaven to God the other, the incomprehensible, the possibly self-lim iting in power and knowledge (Reich, 2000). The critical point is that each child and each adolescent (and each adult) has to take their development in his or her own hands, in accordance with their own personal readiness and speed of progress, if long-lasting insights and coherent behaviour are to be achieved (e.g., Bucher, 1989, 1992; Holm, 1992; Mode, 1992; Oser &amp; Reich, 1990). Priests, ministers, religious educa tors, parents, etc. can "only" offer possibilities for development, provide in formation and stimulation, raise questions, point out contradictions, be a possible role model, when necessary gently but firmly resist undesirable ex tremes, be available to answer questions, discuss doubts, share joy and sor row; but they cannot expect to "transfer lock, stock, and barrel" their own views, beliefs, and behaviour. In fact, individuals may interpret the Bible, and find help from it, in unexpected ways. For instance, Ruard Ganzevoort (1998) tells the story of Frits, who was sexually abused by his father. In childhood Frits managed to construct a meaningful story about what hap pened to him by bringing in Jesus' suffering, and also Abraham binding Isaac in preparation for his sacrifice (Genesis 22:9). Later on, Frits reinterpreted those religious references, which helped him to see that painful period of his life in a different light and to overcome his trauma to some extent. Similarly, at the adult level, Marinus van Uden (1998) reports on the gradual healing of Piet Rigstra's obsessive neurotic problems by way of reading and meditating on Jesus' driving out the sellers and buyers from the temple and overturning the tables of the money changers (Mark 11:15) - thus finding encouragement to express his bottled-up anger. Also, the methodology has to be adopted to the age in question, mostly in terms of filiation: from simply doing things together, to also telling stories, drawing pictures, playing games, singing songs and on to role-playing, discus sions, analyses, etc. And similarly for content, from creating a knowledge base to understanding the relevance of that knowledge, to finding a sense in life, to becoming aware of one's identity, etc. (cf. Böhnke &amp; Reich, 1991, 23-26). With the failure to act appropriately (e.g., Reich 1997c, 1998), the likelihood will in crease that the child/the adolescent will throw out religion altogether, along with the stork which brings the babies, the tooth fairy, Father Christmas, and the Easter bunny, possibly only for a few years, but potentially for good. Yet, whatever the divergences and even disputes and oppositions, children, adoles cents, and even adults need (to a diminishing degree if all goes well) (social) ac ceptance and support including "mirroring" of their personality, "heroes", that is (religious) persons and objects to be admired, and beneficial stable (re ligious) relationships (in infancy, secure attachments). The potential, risks and difficulties involved were already pointed out in the Introduction as well as the need to persevere even in the face of societal indifference.</page><page sequence="13">290 K. Helmut Reich Concluding Remarks Why should anybody be interested in the guidelines above? Some may judge them entirely misguided because these persons consider the Bible out dated, if not positively harmful. Conversely, theologians of the Barthian school and their sympathizers would presumably argue that the guidelines are irrelevant at best, and harmful at worst (but see Jeeves, 1997) because they distract from focusing on God's revelation; hence for some "religious lead ers" they will be inacceptable. Others may point out that each person is dif ferent - particularly in these postmodern times -, and that hence no general guidelines can be established. Experts may dispute some of my interpreta tions of the research results. Others will point out that the devil is in the de tails, and hence such generalities are of little help, yet others may think that I knock on open doors. Being aware of all that, why did I go ahead anyway? First, I believe in the importance and value of a healthy religion, and would like to make a contri bution (if ever so small) aimed at reducing the danger of spreading unhealthy "religions" (e.g., Scharfetter, 1991; Utsch, 1998). It seems to me that at the present stage of scientific development, some relevant knowledge is suffi ciently well established to be applied, even if cautiously. Should that know ledge then, not be made public? Second, I think that in the long run any guidelines will prove or disprove their utility as a matter of course, as stated in William James's version of pragmatic truth or in the biblical formulation, "You will know them by their fruits" (Matthew 7:16, par). And that does not mean that religion is reducible to its utility. A true believer will anyway have a different perspective, "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways my ways, says the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts" (Isaiah 55:8-9). Acknowledgment: I thank Eduardo R.
