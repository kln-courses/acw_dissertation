<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hebrew Studies 42 (2001) 322 Reviews HISTORY AND IDEOLOGY: AN INTRODUCTION TO HISTORIOGRAPHY IN THE HEBREW BIBLE. By Yairah Amit. Biblical Seminar Series No. 60. Pp. 127. Sheffield: Academic Press, 1999. Paper, $19.95. Speak the word "history" in relation to biblical writings and the discus sion usually focuses on whether a biblical character really existed or was a literary creation; whether a described event occurred or was manufactured in order to convey an important truth. Archeology generally becomes the proving ground for the "real" versus "created" accounts of what happened. Yairah Amit, in her brief and very readable book, reshapes this discussion by affirming the historical importance of the ideology present in the writings of the Hebrew Bible. Amit begins by affirming the centrality of history for the biblical writ ers. She points out how most of the authors in the Hebrew Bible provide some type of historical setting for their work. Besides the references to kings and battles which prophetic writings often employed, the laws of the Pentateuch frequently were given historical justification, and religious ceremonies were tied to past events. Even divine speeches were linked to the liberation from Egypt instead of the cosmological creation of earth. Yet Amit is not trying to advocate the historical reality of events like the exo dus. Amit is interested in what values are conveyed by the particular telling of these stories for the writers and their audience years later. After analyzing Genesis-Numbers, Deuteronomy, Kings, Joshua, Judges and Samuel, Amit is convinced that two conflicting ideologies are at work in these writings: the ideology of the Deuteronomistic school (7th-6th century B.C.E.) and the priestly ideology prevalent after the fall of Judah (6th-5th century B.C.E.). Deuteronomistic ideology emphasizes the worship of God in a centralized location, a more remote, transcendent image of God, and the importance of keeping the covenants and statutes of God in order to possess the land. Deuteronomy, Kings and Joshua advocate this ideology. Their precursors, Judges and Samuel, also possess some elements of it. In contrast, Genesis through Numbers express the priestly ideology which has a greater openness to foreigners, allows sacrificial offerings to be made at numerous locations, views the wilderness as a formative period in their history, and expresses an anthropomorphic image of God. When Amit analyzes Chronicles, she believes a third ideology is present. She begins by examining how the author of Chronicles reshaped the history of Judah given in the earlier work of Kings. The more positive presenta tion of the kings of Judah, the focus on more inclusive practices of David and Solomon, and the portrayal of Judah as a vast and united people, lead Amit to believe that the writer is expressing his vision of what the new</page><page sequence="2">Hebrew Studies 42 (2001 ) 323 Reviews post-exilic society should become: an inclusive society led by one from the Davidic line. Amit concludes that the ideology underlying Chronicles is a revolt against the exclusionistic views of Ezra and Nehemiah. The author is presenting an alternative vision for the community. For Amit, the primary historical value of Chronicles is not in what it tells the reader about Judah's past, but what it indicates about the post-exilic world in which the writer lived. In her opinion, history is not the accurate recitation of past events, but the significance society imputes to past events. This book would be good companion piece in an introductory course on the Hebrew Bible. It needs to be used with a textbook about the history of Israel which covers archeological discoveries and their relationship to bib lical literature. Without this additional input, some of Amit's discussions about the historicity of the events portrayed in Joshua or discussions over the real existence of biblical characters would be difficult for a student to follow. As Amit notes in her final chapter, there are archaeological and historical truths. Archaeological truth is "what we accept as a reliable his torical source for reconstructing the past, whereas historical truth is the contribution made by a given work to our understanding of the forces that shape history." She then quotes Asher Hirsch Ginzberg, a philosopher who stated in an essay on Moses, "Not every archaeological truth is also histori cal truth. Historical truth is that, and that alone, which reveals the forces that go to mould the social life of mankind. Every man who leaves a per ceptible mark on that life, though he may be a purely imaginary figure, is a real historical; his existence is an historical truth." (From A. H. Ginzberg, "Moses," in L. Simon (trans.), Selected Essays by Ahad Ha 'am [Philadel phia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1948], 307-329). While many will not agree with Amit's definition of historical truth, the presentation of her ideas is interesting, understandable, and not as polemic as some in volved in this debate. Her book can make a contribution to constructive dis cussions about history and ideology in classrooms around the world. Jo Anne R.
