Ganeša, an important god of the Hindu pantheon, is becoming more and more popular and studies devoted to him are now coming out in quick succession. Only in 1997 Paul Dubost, a French scholar who prides in calling himself a 'Gänapatya', brought out a massive monograph on Ganeša, and the present one follows him. This too is profusely illistrated, but with B/W photographs. Most of the works on Ganeša cover the familiar ground, and Alice Getty's study still remains a standard work. To start with, the author examines the place of Ganeša in India's life and then discusses whether he is a Vedic god. He rightly concludes that the had no Vedic origin, as evidence from verses from the Maitrãyani Samhitã which are generally cited are later interpolations. Ganeša was a folk divinity according to the author, but his dating of the Mãnava-grhyasãtra to 7th-4th cent. BC is much on the higher side for it is not earlier than 2nd cent. BC. The author then gives descriptions of the god in the epics and the Purãnas, his parentage and iconography, the Gänapatya cult and so on. Finally, he has also briefly dealt with Ganeša</page><page sequence="2">280 Annals BORI, LXXXII ( 2001 ) images outside India. This also is roughly the pattern that other writers on Ganeša have followed. The author appears to be of the opinion that the Ganeša images begin to occur from the Gupta period onward. However, there is evidence to show that the first image of the god was fashioned in the Kushan period as is evident from the Mathurã specimens. The author has cited the evidence of coins of Demetrius and Menander, but it must be noted that the "King with elephant scalp" type was not their innovation; they were merely imitating Alexander who had issued the type to celebrate his oriental conquests. However, it is highly likely the elephant scalp on his coins is probably the sacred elephant of Taxila which Alexander had venerated during his stay in the city. The sacred elephant who appears on the coins of Eukratides is the Pilusara of Kapisha as the legend on the coin bears out. It was given the anthropomorphic form on Hermes' coin . This in all likelihood is the origin of the elephant-headed deity. The book is a welcome addition to the literature on the subject and the author deserves our congratulations. - M. K.
