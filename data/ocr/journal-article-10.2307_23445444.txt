Pune: Indian Philosophical Quarterly Publications (Pune 411 007). 1984. Rs 70. Also available from Gandhi Peace Foundation, Delhi. In his justly celebrated recent book The intimate enemy, Ashis Nandy examines the pathology of a hypermasculinity which is widely known under its Hispanic name machismo, a name especially well-known in circles sympathetic to ecological and feminist critiques of the dominant patriarchal and industrialist modes of thought. By way of tying his study to our specific experience, Nandy looks at the actions of and reactions to this pathology at both ends of the British Raj, both in dominated Indians and in dominating/dominated Britishers. He shows how machismo, the ideological panoply of himsà or violence, has called forth a matching reaction of aggressive nationalist terrorism in some people, but has also inspired others, like Gandhi, to respond by taking fresh cultural and political initiatives in ahirhsà or non-violence. This distinctively Indian option, Nandy shows, effectively sidetracks and defuses the rage and rational-systematic repression of the macho adversary. It also successfully protects the non-violent satyàgrahî from the danger of wanting to be violent, to violate the opponent's human ity first in thought (seeing him as an inhuman 'enemy'), then in word, and finally in irreversible action, surrendering to the course of war in which the opponent wishes to embroil the satyagrahi. Nandy also pays crucial attention to the psycho-ideological hold that violence has on much mainstream thought. He speculates, often insightfully, about ways to break this hold, and seeks unusual and interesting allies in his effort to wage peace rather than war. This is his contribution to the Gandhian struggle against the intimate enemy, against the colonial (both colonizing and colonized) power-self which all too often constitutes our 'normal', violence-based self-image.

This form is inevitably shaped by the fact that the conflict has forced us to take it. Political forms always involve this element of compulsion or force, however well our policies may avoid the violence that violates the opponent's humanity. There is no escape from this contingency. We cannot struggle our way out of the necessity of organized struggle itself. Seeing this, we may have an uneasy feeling that the Indian path as the Gandhian movement and its allies have seen it comes out as a negative stance, as ultimately a reaction to some natural state of violence rather than a truly vital and youthful initiative which launches itself. It seems hard to do anything about this feeling as long as one sticks to categories of war and peace — political categories that help deter mine the form of nations or individuals with a non-violent vision as a self-image, possibly the image that will 'overcome' others. For winning and losing, however much one tries to soften and ennoble their dynamics, remain a formal matter of yes and no. As one should expect in a domain where the basic breakthrough, ahimsà, has been a lateral manoeuvre, the answer turns out to lie in a mode of thought which is literally beside the point, if one takes the 'point' to be war and peace (or if, as Marx said, 'the point is to change it (the world)'). One of the clearest contemporary articulations of this sidetrack, which enables us to affirm our way out of the winnings and losings of this world, is Ramchandra Gandhi's recent Meditations on the truth of India, if one may mention this subtitle before coming to the principal title of the book I am thou. As a way of approaching this book, let us take up a few lines (in my translation) from a poem by Jibanananda Das (Bengal's major post-Tagorean poet) which juxtapose the winnings and losings of this world with the meditation on T and 'thou': The strife, the blood, the victories of this earth, Though real, don't have the substance that endures. Calcutta will, some day, achieve utopia; And yet the point is that my heart is yours.</page><page sequence="3">REVIEW ARTICLE 189 Here Das situates my heart firmly on this earth and not in some transcendent sphere. And he also tries to be clear, while avoiding an exacting rigour that would miss the point, about the relative status of our realistic form, the structures we inhabit, and our romantic substance, the love that we live in. 'This earth' is to be read not astronomically, as a planet, but ecologically, as the human home. On the earth so understood, human life has a civic form and a rather differently constituted personal substance. The civic or political form of Ufe (note that ci vis and polis are the words for 'city' in Latin and Greek) always responds to the chaos of real and potential war by propping up various sorts of shelter. This is a defensive reaction and must remain so. As its most foresightful phase, the defending machine (the state) may use the tactic of pre emptive attack, perhaps by unobtrusively invading people's minds so that the system is permanently 'safe for democracy', as some people put it — safe from all possible opposition. At its conscientious best, defence may lean towards the conditional abdication called anarchism. In this scenario the state machine agrees to wither away on condition that all persons agree to behave responsibly forever, ensuring safety and the fair play on which safety depends. Even this leaves us with a negative, defensive social function, taken over in such a utopia by all individuals, but still negative and secondary. The point of living cannot be a state of safety from actual or possible threat, even if the principle of safety is presented as a peace that rests on a careful consensus. The question becomes: why carel The answer to that is the one offered by Jibanananda Das: friends (and the essential special case, lovers) live in each other's hearts, caringly; that is why we do care. This looks like a sidetrack to realistic eyes only because it avoids the political and moral question of why we should care. But that question has no direct answer. Politics and morality rest on no first principles of their own. 'Civil rights', however reasonably defined, give us the right to say we don't care. No prin ciple of civility cancels our right to resist or refuse friendship. What counts is that the reality of friendship has lasting effects; in contrast, the reactionary and republican fears, withdrawals, and furies of those publicans who think only in structures of enmity and defence (and</page><page sequence="4">190 REVIEW ARTICLE only see friends 'in public', as fellow combatants against some enemy) fade away. The reality that endures is private, not public; Das, like Kierkegaard, shows that truth is subjectivity. This is the substance of life, and it tells a personal story. Why a story? Why not the principles of a science? Because a peace that invites and depends on an exhaustive analytical investigation would collapse into a 'peacefare' or a 'continuation of warfare by other means', yet another name for the surrender of personal substance to publicly observable form. Our substantial reality is that we are part of each other's stories, in the intricacy that gathers stories into histories — for there is no history in the singular. It is to this reality of ours that Ramchandra Gandhi's I am thou reintroduces us by telling us an albumful of stories which it renews in the telling. Any summary of such an album is bound to be as unfair as a summary trial. But this essay is a public act in the framework of the book reviewing system, and cannot hope to refrain from the necessary unfairness of all publicity. Consider an apple. When I eat it — and this is modern man's favourite way of 'considering' things — my meta bolism produces a personal summary or digest of it; this is called anabolism (and my system throws the rest away, a process known as catabolism). This is most unfair to the apple. The real apple was much richer than my personal summary of it. However, notice that other people eat apples too, and what they make of applekind is obviously quite different from my dyspeptic efforts to digest this noble fruit: they live and flourish, thanks to the way they eat apples, quite differently from the way I live. The upshot is that I don't think apples mind being eaten, if we apple-eaters have so many different styles of turning apples into energy that our panorama of visibly different types of human life reflects the richness of the Eternal Apple itself. Thus the unfairness is okay. I am thou will survive my one-sided summary of it. For many other readers have made and will make a prolixity of summaries, if only in their privacy. And this will do justice, ultimately, to this major work. Armed with the apple argument justifying my unfair summary, I may now present the summary: I am thou is a vaisnava advaitin commentary which seeks out a sütra from texts and tales, turning an apparent problem — the absence</page><page sequence="5">REVIEW ARTICLE 191 of a canon — into an advantage, and relating the concept of such a manoeuvre to the world of tantra. This is probably much more indigestible than most oneliners you have seen, but I promised you a summary, not a rose garden. We can now go over the main points, treating the summary like a long and initially inscrutable headline. I am thou is a commentary or bhàsya which seeks out a sütra. Indian thought has always used compact sütra formulas and commen tarial formulations of various types (kàrikà, vrtti, tikà, bhàsya) for different purposes. The comparison with equations like e = mc2 and their exoteric elaborations is only partially appropriate, but may stand as a first approximation. I am thou is an elaborate commentary on a sütra text which, if it existed as an actual text, would express the unification of strands of Indian thought that belong together. Since the sütra has no such concrete existence, I am thou identifies its elements and shows how they gather and 'weave' themselves into a single weft with a specific texture, amounting to a text when seen in perspective. / am thou does all this quite self-consciously: it directly discusses the hermeneutic relation between original texts and their post-classical interpretations (pp. 55—57). One might think that it would be appropriate to see the absence of a vaisnava advaitin sütra as a problem to which I am thou, as a bhàsya that needs a text, offers this sort of tentative solution. But the notions of Problem, Solution, and Tentative are not quite the ones that are at work here. Tantra is defined (p. 154) as the art of turning an apparent handicap into an advantage. This helps us to view the text finding work of this book as tantric in a pervasive sense. It may be easier to appreciate this sense if one reexamines the word tantra in the context of tantri in the musical sense, tantu in the organic (tissue) sense and in the domain of weaving as a craft, tâna 'tone', âtati 'tension', and other derivatives of the root tan which is usually trans lated as 'stretch'. The tantric method, working along lines of organic relatedness of tissue and tone, removes the handicap of apparent disconnections and discovers the advantage of nontrivial connections. How so? Consider the concrete case here. I am thou wants us to meet the world of vaisnava advaitin unity. But no visible sütra gathers and presents this world. So the author of the bhàsya introduces us to</page><page sequence="6">192 REVIEW ARTICLE the elements of vaisnava advaita in such a way that we come to realize the impossibility of any single string (sütra also means 'string') tying all this together. It is in the nature of vaisnava advaita to need to be seen from many viewpoints. A unity does emerge, but not the sort that calls for one sütra. Thus the absence of a sütra, which had seemed a handicap, ends up helping the project. A vaisnava bhàsya must seek its scripture in life and stories as well as in sutra texts. What is vaisnava about this? Visnu's principle, sthiti or conserva tion, is ecological; his major incarnation Krsna lived a lush and many sided life. It is vaisnava to keep cycles going, to connect and correlate, to reweave your own texts and textiles when you need them, and to draw your warp and woof from resources in your environment, reliving the history of your life-space when appropriate. It makes sense, then, that I am thou starts with a gathering, a spiritual retelling of Indian history, one that can be fruitfully contrasted with the methodologist's 'rational reconstruction' of what some scientists once did. In the latter case, familiar in the methodology of research pro grammes based on Popper's philosophy of science, the rational reteller of the story guesses how the scientist would have proceeded had he or she acted 'rationally' all the time. I am thou, in contrast, nowhere needs to speculate about what ancient Indians should have been doing according to some canon of spiritual nobility. In this connection it may help some readers to keep in mind Wittgenstein's slogan 'Philosophy gives no prizes'. I am thou helps us, for instance, to see and respond to the self-confidence of the Vedas and the self consciousness of the Upanisads without feeling unduly disturbed that these two virtues did not occur together. The book is not just vaisnava. It shares the advaitin or non-dualistic position of the áañkara-vedanta mainstream in classical Indian philosophy. Readers familiar with R. Gandhi's technical work on the philosophy of human communication will find some interesting arguments, elaborating his earlier work, in support of advaita. But this is not the heart of the book. I am thou has something for technical philosophers, but it addresses all thoughtful readers directly. It helps us to experience more vividly what I will describe as the personal cycle of figuration, or the cycle, in the absence of a better term. Advaita theorizing is this book's way of making the cycle vivid for us.</page><page sequence="7">REVIEW ARTICLE 193 Let me first offer an independent characterization of the cycle. It involves three moments. For the sake of exposition, we assume these to be successive. There being no privileged starting point, let us arbitrarily begin at the prefigurational or structural moment: here the personality considers the potential of elements as individual con stituents that may combine in various ways. When a creative artist gets stuck at this prefiguring stage, he is not in touch and produces only constructions, not creations. When he makes the transition from potential form to actual expression, personality shines through. At this creative moment of figuration the artist unfurls a fresh space which invites and nurtures other minds. These creative works and creation-spaces respond to each other. They set up a field with a horizon and a sky gathering their rhythms into a network of signifi cance. Under optimal conditions this process leads to a transfigura tional or numinous moment which redeems the isolation of the individual and shows each person as reborn in all persons. Many people today are prepared to look at rebirth in the form of renaissance but not in the form of reincarnation or resurrection. Whitehead's Adventures of Ideas makes it clear how a renaissance can be less than enough (in his section on peace). Perhaps people who see the power of renaissances or revolutions can bring themselves to encounter alternative visions of what transfiguration is all about. I am thou is a good place to begin this encounter: it contains a rich commentary on the reincarnation and resurrection motifs of Hindu and Christian thought. Among the Greek thinkers before Plato, Heraclitus celebrated the flowingness of rivers and other forms of Becoming, while Parmenides spoke of the faithful lastingness of Being. Ever since, western thought has had a problem of identity concerning being and becoming. Some writings by Heidegger, Deleuze, Whitehead, and others who have faced this problem suggest that careful western thought inclines towards the form of Nietzsche's solution: eternal recurrence is Be coming's attempt to represent the lasting essentialities of Being. This solution raises questions about the nature of eternal recur rence. Nietzsche was a cyclical thinker and was directly indebted in this respect to the Indian tradition. His writings help us to see how transfiguration fades into formality on the way to the next prefiguring; that is how the cycle goes on past the point at which my story had left</page><page sequence="8">194 REVIEW ARTICLE it. But Nietzsche does not help us to see that the cycle itself is a transfiguring principle or to understand how the recurrence gets a chance to improve on the occurrences it reproduces. For insight into these matters, we have to take the substance of the cycle seriously, trying to situate the person in the cycle. It will help if we now relate the discussion to the way I am thou views the cycle. To its advaitin eye, the story looks as follows: the self, while capable of existing as Being without specifications, launches itself away from the (structural) shore of this capability, on an adventure of becoming specific (creative) figurations, on which it hopes to base a return to a fresh (numinous) self-communion, which may in turn serve as the shore for another launching; and this cycle goes on at various times, places, and scales. This account is a reasonable advaita reading of the role that the sâihkhya gunas or strands called tamas, rajas, and sattva play in the natural cycle of pralaya, srsti, and sthiti. My renderings 'structure, creation, numinosity' do not distinguish the stages from their corre sponding gunas. Traditional translations force such a distinction: for instance, pralaya 'structure' is usually called "destruction". But the word pra-laya seems to present the brightness of previous sthiti as fading or undergoing laya into a forward movement, a pra-gati, so that yesterday's numinous insight becomes today's jaded, taken for granted institutional structure. The gaze that looks at structure as such is of course analytical and thus destructive of the personal and of figuration; but the translation 'destruction' overconcentrates on this gaze, an Apollonian bias, which forces a sharp distinction between the dancer and the dance. I am thou refers the cycle to cosmic advaita itself, making possible a new derivation of samkhya from vedanta. A-dvaita, non-duality, involves a sâttvika negation ('non') of the ràjasika negation ('two') of an initial undifferentiated tamas or quiddity postulated in the very act of negating; the advaita double negation in its affirmative movement generates and connects the gunas which sàmkhya simply lists in a hierarchy. I promised to situate the person in this story. The person experi ences subjectivity as time. Time is the element of rajas, 'creation'. Rajas, where the person lives, is the basic personal standpoint which</page><page sequence="9">REVIEW ARTICLE 195 every individual assumes, conceiving of the human self as both created and creating. One legitimate application of the cycle is to 'take it personally' and construe it in terms of subjective time. Consider a person at a moment of successful creation — an artist, labourer, scientist, or other produc tive citizen. This person's confident present is grounded in a past of pre-creative apprenticeship and other construction work. Our under standing of the relation between a creative present and its precreative past has been enriched by Sankha Ghosh's 1982 book in Bangla, Nirman ar srishti ('Construction and creation'; Calcutta: Rabindra Bhavana). And the creative present moment feels as though one is on the verge of a transpersonal future which, in the words (my transla tion) of a modern Indian poet, 'will hundred all our ninety-nines'; this utopia is always a horizon which we never reach. The ground-tamas behind the person and the horizon-sattva around the creative space animate the creation. It is clear, though, that the structural heaviness (tamas) behind and numinous lightness (sattva) around the person are not themselves persons, and they do not even hold persons the way that the creational dynamism of rajas holds them in time. The person peripherally feels tamas as a binding past or sattva as a releasing future, but these are systematic mirages. For tamas and sattva don't exist in time, sequentially, although it is possible for a series of events in real time to represent a tamas-rajas-sattva cycle. What does it mean to say that tamas and sattva don't exist in sequential time? To approach an answer, consider the case of lan guage. The French scholar Meillet was the first to draw attention to the 'discontinuous transmission of language' across generations, the fact that the children of each generation, during their language devel opment, recreate the language in their own style. Language is a space, as is marriage, or democracy, a cultural space of the kind that we often call 'institutions'; persons enter these spaces by recreating them in their lives; such recreation renews the space and reconstitutes it, slightly differently every time. When an individual is entering a language-space, it comes across as an inheritance, as the alluvial timeless structure recalling what was once numinous. Once individuals come into their linguistic inheritance, they use their language creatively; it is then a matter of real time,</page><page sequence="10">196 REVIEW ARTICLE the present. Their creations may occasionally step lightly into the transpersonal region of communion, the numinous, perhaps in poetry; when this happens, the matter is again taken out of time's hands, this time because truly light steps in language manage to reach the sky. That the cloud in the sky then becomes rain, enters the earth, and remains as a heavy and rich inheritance for the next cycle is not the point at the numinous moment: the cloud doesn't care about fertilizing. The important point here is that individuals don't receive any inheritance directly from other individuals. The inheritance process goes through the spaces below and around the surface of personal time, and in large part eludes the individual will. This is the funda mental fact underlying the social sciences, and this is also what I mean by saying that tamas and sattva don't exist in sequential time. Time is personal, while tamas is nobody and sattva is everybody (because it transcends the boundaries, while tamas precedes them). This makes both tamas and sattva 'social', which only goes to show that this English word is of little theoretical value. Tamas and sattva are not political; they form, with rajas, the figuration cycle which helps us understand the private, personal substance of human life in a way that does not start with a political problem and then try to get away from it. The intimate friend is not someone you discover just by fighting the intimate enemy identified by Nandy or by enlisting the help of allies. I have not yet tried to name the intimate friend; we are merely getting ready to try. This getting ready cannot afford to stick to the Hindu apparatus of thought; realizing this, I am thou explores points of real and potential contact with other religions and with socialist thought. In the spirit of that exploration, I would like to suggest that the cycle, which is made explicit in Indian thought, may fruitfully be sought elsewhere. One could argue that hïnayâna Buddhism, which focuses on individual release (nirvana), is a tamas-oriented moment of the Buddhist cycle, giving way to the rajas-oriented mahàyàna moment which spreads Buddha's karunà (usually rendered as 'compassion', though words like 'grace' and 'service' express some aspects better) to all people and recognizes the diversity of individuals, leading to the sattva orienta tion of developed Buddhism as in Zen or the Tibetan forms or the vajrayâna/sahajayàna developments which lead into the Eastern Indian</page><page sequence="11">REVIEW ARTICLE 197 mystical sects like the hauls. The logic of the entire unfolding of Buddhist thought can be found in the reported life and teachings of Buddha himself. The same cycle works itself out in the Judaeo-Christian tradition in an unexpected way. Let me simply say that Christianity is poised between a heavy or tâmasika Judaic inheritance and a light or sàttvika follow-through in late Christendom. To give a name to this follow through is very hard. The renaissance and the enlightenment created the conditions for it, and in Hegel we find a crystallized form of Christianity which the new lightness could take as a point of depar ture, but Kant could also play this role. Post-Hegelians like Marx and Kierkegaard or someone reacting against everything Kantian, such as Nietzsche, can be seen as the overt atheism into which the living Judaeo-Christian tradition transforms itself, in necessarily diversified forms (Kierkegaard's anguish about faith is surely a variant of atheism), comparable to the many forms of late Buddhism. Most Marxians see it as a libellous charge when someone calls Marxism a religion or compares it with religions on the same footing. Clearly we need terms which will not evoke these avoidable emotions. In order to talk about how a person or mind organizes itself, we speak of its personality or mentality; let us, likewise, coin the term culturality for the organizing principle of a culture. Culturalities may be mani fested as religions or as secular systems like Marxism. We are looking at the workings of the cycle in culturalities, not just in religions. Hence the discussion of language, for instance. It may be recalled that the point is to see how the cycle is itself a transfiguring principle. We have seen that cultural spaces like language or marriage or democracy are continually enriched and transfigured as successive generations enter the space, deposit something there, and leave; this was the working of the cycle as transfiguration or rebirth on a community scale. We are now trying to look at the civilizational scale. It is not just a matter of looking for examples of some schema in various culturalities, but of trying to understand the principles of development of the substance of human life in terms of a specific conception. This conception is related to the general concern about a transition from classical tradition to some 'modern' vision of 'freedom', and to the concern Marx had expressed when he said that human history will come to be under</page><page sequence="12">198 REVIEW ARTICLE stood when it is reviewed in terms of the dynamics of countryside and city. At the tamasika point of the cycle, a culturality faces the problem of death and inheritance, the problem of tra-dition, passing-on or handing-down. Culturalities solve this by classical means; inheritance and authority are formalized and give cultural structure to individual life and death; forms like hînâyana Buddhism (with the stress on the problem of personal suffering and discontinuity) and Judaism and the áiva-oriented Harappan structure which (one might speculate) has introduced the culture of tapasyà or directed meditation into the Hindu synthesis correspond to this tâmasika phase. At the techno logical 'base' of such a form of culturality, Marxians and other causal explainers will find systematic agriculture. I am inclined to agree with Nietzsche in seeing sign-relations rather than causality in the relations between cultural forms and corresponding forms of material Ufe. Cities are early, but the hegemony of the city comes late, at the ràjasika point of the cultural version of the cycle of figuration, raising the question of individual lives on the basis of the long solved issue of individual deaths. Given an established culture that is confident in its continuity, in its power of epic consensus elaborated as specific poetry whose rhythms span the gaps represented by individual deaths, there can be the rise of the person as a new question. The Sanskrit word (used in modern Indian languages like Hindi, Bangla etc.) for person, vyakti, has the primary meaning 'expression', which raises the question clearly: how is the person to express the culture, to express human life? All over the world, the answer has been art (in the broad sense proposed by Nietzsche, who regarded science and religion and work as arts), of which the city is the outer form and principle. Important examples for us are India, where the period of bhakti and Sufism and khayàlî music give rebirth to song, and the Western renaissance, where the individual has expressed human life in prose in a broad sense. I am thou opens up a new vista for careful inquiry into the work of combining these responses to the problem of the person in modem India. Even activists cannot avoid this inquiry. The work of com bining two styles perhaps began when India received, in the form of Islam, the first input from what R. Gandhi has insightfully identified as</page><page sequence="13">REVIEW ARTICLE 199 the Abrahamic set of culturalities (comprising Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, united in their acknowledgement of Abraham, who had been willing to sacrifice his son Isaac at the bidding of an unseen God). However, our cultural self-image situates the beginning of our modern work at the point of the encounter with the Christian variant of the Abrahamic culturally, which continued into renewals of the encounter as the Western system moved into the overtly atheistic mode of its culturally; we call this our renaissance, our enlightenment, or our awakening, and associate it with key figures in Maharashtra, Bengal, and certain other areas. We see it as the beginning of our public discourse. I am thou's discussion of the Sikh version (pp. 54—57) of the bhakti revolution makes the intriguing suggestion (p. 57) that 'Future anthropology, beyond egoistic psychology and herd sociology, will descend more from Nanak than from Aristotle', and fruitfully relates the issue to tantra and to the work of (p. 55) 'a translation of the classical and not a transgression of it'. I will resist the temptation of trying to unpack these suggestions right here: that would be another essay. Let us instead simply extend the scope of the suggestions to the entire bhakti-Sufi-khayàlï range of the post-classical Indian awakening or rebirth which made our distinctive response to Western conquest possible. R. Gandhi is making the important point that the bhakti process renewed the classical attainments in personal lives and opened up an anthropological, public space where the tradition can disperse into equivalent but diverse personal expressions. It follows, with just a few obvious extra premises, that the bhakti process was bound to attack untouchability in the short run (consider the early saints) and in the long run (consider Gandhiji, a bhakti leader in the eyes of a long-term history of India). Other implications for the shape of discourse and public interaction in reborn India are not hard to derive. As history-writing, and other methods of making the recent past accessible and usable, continue to clarify the spiritual and secular innovations of the bhakti-Sufi period for us, the implications will become clearer. The Abrahamic culture of individual prose represents an orienta tion to Brahma, the God-form which is to creation what Shiva is to structure or what Visnu is to numinosity. Appropriately, Abrahamic</page><page sequence="14">200 REVIEW ARTICLE cultures worship God as the supreme creator. In the technical terms made available by Indian thought — and 1 am thou sets an extended example in the area of using Indian terms for universal purposes — the Abrahamic person's ista devatâ, roughly 'allegiance-claiming God-form', is God as the supreme creator; as the work of worship progresses, the worshipper takes on many of the features of the God-form; Abrahamic culture becomes a culture of self-conscious creators, leaving less and less of a role in the culturality for the creative God-form. At a mature phase of this process, Abrahamic worshippers either switch their worship onto the proper locus of the creative work — the force that carries out the work (in the form of the working class in particular, or a charismatic fuehrer, or the human species viewing itself as a work-force in general) or the principles governing world-spanning creative work (the principles of science and art) — or make their worship abstract and impersonal, seeking a new form or forms of God. The logic of their exclusive, 'monotheistic' worship of the Creator forces this choice on them: either an apparent atheism (with a figure of 'Man' in God's place) or a faith that sets aside the exclusive thematization of Creation. There is a lot for all of us, both in and outside the Abrahamic orbit that has imperially affected all people, to learn from both horns of the dilemma and from the circumstances that led to the dilemma. Readers who have been following the theology implied in this account may wonder how there can be any alternative to the Abrahamic stance at the rajas phase of the cycle. Surely, if Brahma is the God form for this phase, it is appropriate for the person, as a ràjasika being, to worship Brahmâ? Yes it is, but there is also another option: the Goddess, Plato's matrix or Receptacle, who is seen in India as the consort of Siva as it is in her space and with her energy that structure can exist, and as she is the grace whereby Siva passes into the multi plicity of creation (hence the easy substitution of Sakti for Karunà when cultural politics forced Eastern Indian Buddhist cults to pretend to become Hindu overnight). If you assume Sakti to be nature-as active, it begins to make sense that she should flow through the entire cycle as the cyclic principle itself, while the principles of Siva (struc ture), Brahmà (creation), and Visnu (numinosity) pertain to specific moments or forces of the cycle. The bhakti movement had many</page><page sequence="15">REVIEW ARTICLE 201 forms, but it seems fair to say that post-classical India has either identified with áakti (in the form of Ràdhà, and taken Visnu's Krsna form as the ista devatà) or worshipped her, avoiding the Abrahamic option of worshipping the personal principle of creation in the form of Brahmà. As the cyclic principle, Sakti, continually transfigures the world, she leads to the essence of transfiguration itself, Visnu, and the result is inevitably Vaisnava, putting the person in numinous touch with other persons at the very moment when the person comes into his or her own as an individual. It is possible that too quick a transition from structure to numinosity shortcircuits the energetic expansion of the creative individual, inhibits the completion of the process of freeing the individual from the overprotective care of tradition, and prevents the lived cycle in human experience from faithfully representing, and thus comprehending, the untamed ràjasika wildness of the universe as a risky place. It is quite likely that the technological and scientific imperative which, through the West, has imposed itself on a wider range of cultures is an essential component of a rajas-oriented urban period in world history. That certain Indians responded to the Christian challenge by establishing a dualistic Brahma worship of an abstract God who turns out theologically to be the Creator figure may not have been inappropriate, then. And in that case there are impor tant ways in which it is legitimate and necessary to deny that 'I am thou'. Whether or not India is to abandon its 'road of song' (to invert the title of Ray's film Pather panchali 'The song of the road') entirely, one must then concede that Indians must at least join the Joneses in the standard modern efforts of personal and cultural development. It is possible to elaborate these remarks into a full-scale counter-state ment. But that would take us back to the problems of war and peace, and we would miss the intimate friend. And besides it would miss the point of the current crisis in the West itself. The Abrahamic paradigm is altering itself irreversibly. Creation as an exclusively worshipped principle of production is giving way to a gradual understanding of the numinous, at first in dispersed move ments like the environmental and anti-nuclear efforts or feminism or the struggle against racism, but growing towards comprehension of the total situation. Changes in the sciences themselves are contributing</page><page sequence="16">202 REVIEW ARTICLE positively to this development; anthropomorphic views based on unilinear, quasi-subjective time are giving way to broader systemic views that accommodate intersecting and incommensurable time-scales and rhythms in a vaisnava fashion. This was the vaisnava trend. And in the saiva direction, explanations in the social sciences (causal or semiotic) accept the necessity of referring the subjective to the objec tive, the personal to the prepersonal, and the biochemical revolution has brought theoretical science to the threshold of the principles involved. The growth of vaisnava practice and saiva theory in the Abrahamic culturally compels monotheism (and its atheistic transform monohumanism) to grow by its own logic towards some version of advaita, some understanding of the unity of the cycle and its role in all regeneration. If negative trends don't manage to obstruct this develop ment, then possessive individualism and the mini-imperial sovereign state, the two Western inventions that have done the greatest amount of measurable harm, are going to be tamed reasonably soon. It will then stop being necessary to present ideas of Indian vintage aggres sively or as an alternative to the confident Western mainstream. Our job, then, is to keep doing whatever we are good at, letting other culturalities benefit from our material at a time of their own choosing. R. Gandhi is good at introducing us to the intimate friend, a matter to which we may now return. It is possible now, in a way that was unimaginable at the outset of this discussion, to place R. Gandhi's decisive contribution in a classical setting. In putting forward his vaisnava bhàsya of advaita, he implies, without criticism, that orthodox advaita has been saiva. So has orthodox Sanskrit grammar, to which he proposes, by way of some suggestive etymologies, a vaisnava alternative. In both cases, this brings out the character of our orthodoxies: they overtly pertain to undifferentiated Brahman and are trying to be neutral about the lflà (play) of differentiation, but in fact they take a distinct position, the saiva position which appears to precede mâyâ. Now, this does not give them an Archimedean point outside the play, as the vaisnava eye of many post-bhakti Indians sees clearly. Given that one must take the play with the Brahman, it is more advantageous to try and attain a seat on the horizon of numinosity; you have to reach that seat by living through the whole cycle of play, not just once but repeatedly,</page><page sequence="17">REVIEW ARTICLE 203 not just in what you feel as your present life but in all other lives, which are also yours, as you are everyone else. R. Gandhi accepts Aurobindo's extension of reincarnation theory; and the great vaisnava poet Tagore wrote poems expressing how we feel at one with cosmic rhythms when we learn from evolutionary theory that we come from a whole line of vegetable life and sea and land animals — poems that could only have been written in a culture where the notion of reincar nation is alive. But these poems also belong distinctively to a bhakti period of this culture, one that rejoices in and beyond the element of màyà that orthodox translation and thought would call 'illusion'. What, really, is màyà? The word is a noun based on the verb root mà (the same yâ is found in mrigayà, pravrajyà etc.), whose meaning must be grasped through the family of words pramà 'adequate knowledge', pramàna 'proof (that which brings about adequate knowledge), upamà 'com parison', pratimà 'image', màna 'standard, measure', and the like. The Radhakrishnan definition of mà as 'to form, to build' and of màyà as 'the capacity to produce forms' (pp. 40—41 of his English edition of the Bhagavadgità) cannot really handle the whole family of words. Recall that the Rgveda texts called Indra visvasya pratimànam 'a match for all, a standard or model for all', and spoke about a god measuring (vi-mà was the verb stem) the heavens and the earth with his strides. The notion of mà seems to be this: a being has a limited, shaped existence, and these limits or this shape can be perceived or measured either directly or in comparison with other beings sharing cosmic space with it; when you measure a being, you ask it to 'be itself in a special finite way (it's like a tailor saying, 'Please stand the way you normally do: I want to get the right measure'), hence the use of màna, màpa etc. for measurement; a pratimà 'image, statue' of a being iconically mimics that being's eidos in the Greek sense. These are the familiar properties of non-relativistic and non quantum everyday objects which pre-twentieth-century physics had generalized to all things, and which we now know to be a special case though not 'illusory' in any useful sense of that term. Màyà is Euclidean geometry and Newtonian physics, the foundation of common sense and humanity. The vaisnava vision realizes that one cannot sidestep such humanity</page><page sequence="18">204 REVIEW ARTICLE and directly arrive at a final truth. The saiva dancingness of micro particles and vaisnava horizon-curvature of the macrocosm can only emerge as the outcome of a hard life devoted to the truth and yet capable of joy; one has to earn a real way out of the magic, including the potential for black magic, of the màyà-world. It is fitting that considerations touching on Indra as a pratimàna should help us to try and understand màyâ; Indra was known for his vajra, his thunderbolt; and we must acquire the easy hardness of the late Buddhism known both as vajrayàna 'the thunderbolt way' and as sahajayàna 'the natural/ easy/innate way', and also of Subhash Mukhopadhyay's poem which says, 'Comrade, try for a friendship tough as thunder', with the ease of friends and the hardness of Indra's thunderbolt, if we are to face the real challenge of màyà. The present form of the challenge is this. It has become the task of subjective mâyà, the magically congregated rulers and thinkers and doers in our countries, to take over the household management of gàrhasthya of objective màyà, the magically present and intricate network of our life-space, now stretching beyond earth to as far as our machines can go. All this is magical because our individuals can't understand either subjective or objective reality for long enough, and their understanding is not hard enough to be dependable. Will we be hard enough, in the congregations that our friendship can gather, to face this challenge? We will, if we pick the right intimate friend. Suppose we choose Nature, Sakti, and correspondingly polarize the friendship field so that what we feel as 'us' (rather than 'our friend nature, in human life and nonhuman realities', the other pole of the field) is an active principle that can weather the cycle because it has itself learnt to swing with it and at the same time to rise above it. This is a possible choice, though hardly a worldly human choice in the usual sense; we may be able to grow into it if we remain human as persons but learn how to make our cultural spaces superhumanly resilient and 'true'. Then we will be able to remain vaisnava, with Visnu as our personal ista devatá, or to exercise the other choices which are more natural for many of us, but our spaces will have áakti as their ista. This is the sort of possibility that I am thou encourages us to imagine. Persons can grow into a tough, private peace that will survive all the warlike posturings that</page><page sequence="19">REVIEW ARTICLE 205 public distortions can ever generate. It is the story of this maturity that I am thou tells most lastingly. There is no automatic intimate friend. The mature person knows how to make a natural choice.
