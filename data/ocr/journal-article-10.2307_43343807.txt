Grendel, as feond is not a "fiend" of hell, but an "enemy" in the Hall. In Classical literature a diabolos (O.E. cognate deofol) was a "slanderer"; the verb diaballein meant "to overthrow", either a man's reputation by calumny, or even social order. Such was Grendel as deofol who wrecked King Hrothgar's Heorot, and his reputation as pro- tector of the Hall. Hél, "calumny" was the homophone of hel, the "Underworld", and both Northern and Greek belief associated the Underworld with the sanctity of oaths by which social order was maintained: Horkos, the personification of "Oath" was under the protection of the River Styx, while in the Poetic Edda , solemn oaths were sworn by the River Slith. Thus, in both cultures a man's false word and the social order were subject to hell itself. Critical readers of Beowulf made uneasy that the hero should have so ignoble an opponent as Grendel, have usually compensated by declaring him an anthropomor- phic monster and fiend of Hell. In this way they glorify the epic as Christian allegory.1 It is assumed for example, that Christian thought colored the poet's con- cept of syn , understood not only as 4 'crime' ', but rather as a 4 'sin" to be judged by the Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount. Grendel, moreover, had com- mitted his synn as feond and deofl for which he was to be punished in Hell, in Satan's realm. But the poet, however exposed to Christian doctrine, ignores the New Testament and the figure of Christ, and especially the idea of the brotherhood of all men. Though no longer a polytheist, he grounded his beliefs (not without ambivalence) in an ethic long established in the Northern and Mediterranean worlds, one based on a narrow kinship and social structure, which he cherished above personal salva- tion and the Christian afterlife. Therefore he devoutly embraced the Old Testament with its belief in a single almighty, Almihtig , paternal and protective deity who, as Dryhten and Helm, "Chief" and "Helmet", reinforced his own supreme trust in kingship. He also found the moral of the Old Testament Cain legend particularly im- portant for amalgamating his ancient tribal tenets with his new faith inasmuch as it upheld as prime evil the shedding of kindred blood and, as even worse, the de- fiance of authority and order. This is precisely why Grendel, although of Northern origin, was regarded as the diabolical descendant of biblical Cain and as bent on the overthrow of the Chieftain Hrothgar in his hall. This was presented as a paper at the Augustinián Conference of Villanova University, Villanova, Penn- sylvania in Sept. 1983. Special thanks are due Professor Nicholas Howe, Rutgers University, for his critical commentary. 1 Fr. Klaeber, "Die Christlichen Elemente im Beowulf Anglia 35 (1912) Pts. I-III, 249-69; 36 (1912) Pt. IV.</page><page sequence="2">160 THALIA PHILLIES FELDMAN Briefly, the epic's language establishes that Grendel was not a monster of fantasy, but a wer a "man", albeit a cannibal, the most degenerate order of the human race.2 He is literally a magu mane fah (978) a "young man guilty of crimes", and a micel, a "big one" (1348), in fact "bigger than any other man" (1353), just as Beowulf is declared "bigger than any other noble and warrior" by the coast warden (248-9). Both protagonists are matched in superhuman strength, with maegen and miht for one carries off thirty victims at a time and the other goes him a shade better by swimming off with thirty suits of armor.3 Each is declared a rinc, meaning a "fearless fighter", and aglaeca, "formidable", and both fight bare-handed.4 The poet apparently sees his protagonists, among other things, as equally opposed forces of savagery and civilization, with civilization connoting the finest values of authority and culture, and savagery as all that would devour and destroy these. However much one allegorizes, Grendel remains a localized, early medieval figure of terrifying concreteness, which the poet's language literally conveys. Therefore, it seems best to examine some of that terminology, taking care to avoid the "pre- judicial limitations" of interpretation in reference to Grendel against which Meritt and Robinson have so astutely warned us.5 The term feond is a special case in point, which Bosworth and Toller render as "foe" and "enemy" for all uses except for Grendel; for him it is prejudicially 2 Beowulf 105, 1352.

Moreover, though each takes off with 30 trophies, Grendel only carries his in a bag while Beowulf outdoes him by swimming off with them (2359-62). To read his feat of swimming as a "sailing off" instead, as does Fred C. Robinson, "Elements of the Marvellous in the Characterization of Beowulf", in Old English Studies in Honour of John C. Pope, ed. Robert Burlin and Edward Irving, Jr., (Toronto, 1974) 130, seemed to miss the point of their essential superhuman equation. 4 Rine : may have referred to a "beardless youth" of an age-group like the Greek ephebe, except that Hrothgar is described as gamol rinc (1677), an "old noble", not an "old boy". Aglaeca: Fr. Klaeber, Beowulf and the Fight at Finnsburh, 3rd ed. (Boston, 1950), in the glossary renders it as "hero", "war- rior", but predictably for Grendel as well as his Dam and Dragon, as "monster", "demon", "wretch", "miscreant", but, in contradiction, as "fierce combatant". 5 Herbert D.

But the most incontrovertible evidence against the double standard for feond occurs when both Beowulf and Wiglaf are designated as the Dragon's fionda (2671), its "foes"; they are scarcely its "fiends".7 Admittedly, ambiguity may seem possible in rela- tion to Grendel when Beowulf speaks of him as a feond on fraetewum (962), "a [blank] in full gear". But this is a conventional formula simply meaning a "foe in full gear", and in Grendel's case having ironic application to his great bare hands and the bag intended for his gruesome loot. As for the most controversial expression of all in respect to Grendel, feond on helle , that will be taken up later in discussion of helle and healle . The evidence, however, for a double standard of interpretation one pejorative to Grendel, will be the same. There remains one ambiguity in respect to feond and Grendel. It occurs when he is said to journey at his death far on feonda geweald (808), which might imply "in the realm of fiends", meaning "devils" of Hell. On the other hand this may be a Christian emendation. But to eject it as such simply to keep one's argument intact seems a moral frailty. Instead, in this special case feond may conceivably represent a transitional stage in which the O. E. "enemy" is beginning to shade into its later usage of "fiend", and coming at a time when a true Christian's worst enemies might indeed begin to be conceived of as the devils of Satan. We can see that transition beginning in the Life of St. Guthlac, a work of solidly Christian spirit.8 On the 6 Also, J.R.C. Hall and Herbert D. Meritt, A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary, (Cambridge, 1960), s.v. feond, "adversary", "foe", "enemy"; "fiend", "The Devil". Stephen Barney, Word-Hoard: An In- troduction to Old English Vocabulary (New Haven, 1977), s.v. feond, p. 59 notes it had the unique mean- ing "devil" only later. Signe Carlson, "The Monsters of Beowulf: Creations of Literary Scholars", Jour- nal of American Folklore 80 (1967) 360, finds that of twenty-two translations and adaptations of the epic only two translate feond in lines 101 and 725 as "enemy" or "foe", while sixteen retain "demon", "spirit", "devil". Tolkien (above n. 2) 89, recognized that feond in references to Grendel meant "enemy". In this Klaeber concurs in his glossary. 7 Similarly, the dragon's track, feondes fotlast (2289) is the "enemy's track"; and they slew the "foe", feonda (2706) by common action. 8 That transition of feond from "enemy" to "fiend" seems to be beginning to take place in the Life of St. Guthlac, a poem of earlier composition than Beowulf, but already wholly imbued with Christian spirit as it recounts the life of an early 8th century Mercian nobleman of royal blood who, after leading a war band, later became a hermit and spiritual guide. He gained sainthood by his spiritual war and vic- tory over his diabolical tormentors. (See below on diabolos, pp. 163-4) In his translation of that poem, Israel Gollancz, The Exeter Book Pt. I, EETS (London, 1958 reprint), 104-88, exercises judicious ar- bitrariness (or else simple ambivalence) in using both interpretations for feond. But, undeniably, the fion- da finally truly emerge as "fiends" in their hideous tormenting of the poor saint. Yet, it is noteworthy</page><page sequence="4">162 THALIA PHILLIES FELDMAN other hand, when that same term is applied in the epic itself to another outcast, Heremod (902-5), that unhappy ruler may be understood to be going into the power of his enemies, presumably the Jutes.9 N.F. Blake, however, may be right in inferr- ing that more likely Heremod's "enemies" were the eotenas .,0 These were not the punitive fiends of Hell, but Grendel's Northern relatives, the fifelcyn of the lonely fens. It is among them that Heremod, like Grendel, was exiled since each had violated the mores of civilized men. In wraeclastas, "paths of exile", these outcasts kept company right here on earth with other foes of the social order. Thus, feond means "foe" in virtually every usage in Beowulf. As such, Grendel is consistently the feond mancynnes, without any Satanic connotations. Otherwise, what would a "fiend of mankind" be, if one insists on applying "fiend" to Grendel alone? He is the "enemy", just as elsewhere he is called the hero's "mortal enemy", feorhgenithla (969), and lathgeteona (974), "a foe who incited hatred" and who fought ana with eallum (145), "one against all", meaning humans, not God. that the saint personally never addresses them as such, calling them, significantly, " faith-breakers' ' or "oath-breakers" instead, (623) who live in "exile-tracks", and "murderers" and "wicked spoilers", (652) also "creatures bereft of glory" (673). Indeed, it would be difficulty for any true believer of any Christian period, after knowing that poem, not to brand feond as "fiend". The real questions is whether the Beowulf poet held such spiritual views of his feonda. Klaeber, (above n. 1) 250-252, for feond. 9 Klaeber, (above n. 4) 165 regards the e /Eotenas as Jutes, as do most commentators. R.E. Kaske, "The Eotenas in Beowulf", in Old English Poetry ; ed. Robert Creed (Providence, 1967) 285-310, regards these as "giants" and "unidentifiable foes" suggesting the large Frisian foes of the Danes. 10 N.F. Blake, "The Heremod Digression in Beowulf" JEGP 61 (1962) 278-87, esp. 283. But as he in- terprets the critical Heremod passage (903-6), he provides another example of Christological veneering by virtue of his rendering of it: He [Heremod] was seduced [forlacan] (from God and consequently) quickly despatched into the power of devils [feonda], among the giants [ eotenum ]. He was wracked by painful surgings of fire [lemede sorhwylmas] forever. This clearly envisions Heremod burning in hell-fires in the power of giant fiends. But the sorhwylmas provides the first crack in Blake's Christian veneering. While he acknowledges the sorhwylmas , when ap- plied to Hygelac (1990-94), meant that the king was overwhelmed with anxiety and sorrows at Beowulf's decision to fight Grendel, for Heremod, he quite arbitrarily invokes surging hell-fires of Christian belief, and thus renders a single word in the same work with two very divergent interpretations. This is not the same as what Gollancz does with feond; in The Life of St. Guthlac the very context and argument forces the creation of the term "fiend" into the Christian-English vocabulary. In that poem feond validly emerges as "fiend", and thus marks a moment in the history of the English language which Blake's dual interpretation for sorhwylmas does not. Moreover, in Beowulf wylm and its compounds consistently mean "surge", a "welling of flood or water", sometimes even of "blood", and metaphorically of "emo- tion", but never of "hell-fire". In fyrwylm and brynewylm the surge of burning comes from the fire-drake and not Hell. In arguing from Guthlac B for sorgwylm (1073) and sorgwaelm (1261-62), Blake offers no supportive evidence. In 1073 the sinners in Hell are "overwhelmed with grief'*, not fire; and in 1261 the dying saint says he will not leave his dear friend "overwhelmed with sorrows", a situation quite removed from the torments of Hell.</page><page sequence="5">A Comparative Study of (Feond' ' Deofl ' 'Syn* and 'Hel' in ' Beowulf 163 The term deofl is conventionally and comfortably assumed to refer to a Satanic 4 'devir'. Yet only once is Grendel, together with his mother, referred to as such (1680). In their case the term seems vaguely applied, quite in the way it is still used today when we refer to malevolent people as 4 "devils". Once also, in fleeing Beowulf, Grendel seeks the company of deofla (756), by which is inferred that concourse of his fifelcyn on earth and close to him by the sea, for he would scarcely search out devils in an Underworld. These deofla would seem to be the unhyre, those 4 'savage" ones whom the poet considers eotenas (1679-80), and also the giganta cyn (1690) whom the Lord destroyed in the flood of waters.11 In any case, none of these, the deofla included take any punitive action against men's souls, as Tolkien recogniz- ed.12 Rather, they are part of ancient Northern and protohistoric belief. Although Tolkien, Kiessling and others acknowledge that Grendel was of human stock (which Klaeber scarcely allows him), they still insist that he is a creature to be judged by Satanic standards. For Malone, even the Dam's simple cealde streamas (1261) are not literally the "cold seas", but are gratuitously colored as "evil seas".13 It was in respect to notions of the diabolical that Christians largely diverged from both Classical and Northern pagans who, in contrast shared strikingly analogous views. They derived the diabolical from a social ethic in which the harm done was regarded as injuring the other but had little effect on the soul of the perpetrator which was the preponderant concern of the Christian believer. In the 5th c. B.C. the term diabolos which, like deofl, was later adapted for "devil", originally meant "slanderer" and "bearer of false witness", and as motivated by envy.14 Now Chris- tians of course did not condone slander and they, too, believed it arose from envy, but an envy motivated by Satan. Old English, too, had its term for "calumny" and "false charge", namely hél which is, significantly, the homophone of hel, the Under- world. This is not coincidence, but indicates a concern which, like the Greek, regard- " Nora Chadwick, "The Monsters and Beowulf", in Anglo-Saxon Studies for Bruce Dickins, ed. Peter Clemoes (London, 1959), 173 and n. 3, 175, notes that in the Latin Anglo-Saxon Glossary, preserved in MS. CCCC 144, of the 8th c., thyrs is cited as an alternative to heldiobul (i.e. heldeofol) and again, glosses Orcus. Thomas Wright, Anglo-Saxon and Old English Vocabularies , 2nd ed., Richard Wiilcker (Darmstadt, 1968), s.v. "Orcus", under which are also listed heldiobul and thyrs. But whatever the glossators thought, in this case the poet keeps his orcneas by the sea, not the Underworld. 12 Tolkien (above n. 2) 88-91- Also, Goldsmith (above, n. 2) does not take Grendel literally as "devil", nor, she contends, would any educated Christian. The singular glof or "pouch" Grendel carries on his forays had been made out of dragon-skin (2085). As Klaeber reminds us, a glof was a characteristic pro- perty of pagan trolls. In Christian belief devils neither made or carried them. 13 Tolkien (above, n. 2). Kemp Malone, "Grendel and His Abode", Studia Philologica et Litteraria in Honorem R. Spitzer, ed.

The parallels are striking: In early Greek thought, in Homer and Hesiod, horkos, the "true word" or "oath", "the object by which one swears", was placed by Zeus under the jurisdiction of Styx, the river of the Underworld: "And Zeus honored her [Styx] and gave her great gifts, for her he appointed to be the great Oath of the gods". Just so, as Bellows has noted in the Grimnisvol Saga (28) of the Poetic Edda, oaths were similarly sworn by the River Slith in heiX5 Thus, hél, "false witness" is to Slith what "horkos", "truth-telling", is to Styx. It seems this same ethic was also carried over into Christian times insofar as the one who foreswore himself was refused Christian burial. The ancient ethical belief in truth-telling was so powerful because such was the magical power of the word as truth and, converse- ly, of falsehood and the breaking of oaths. It was believed that the other, indeed many others, might suffer irreparable harm from the abuse of truth. In fact, the verb diaballein in Greek means not just "to slander", but more crucially, "to over- throw". This could imply simply wrong-doing and upsetting, but it could also in- volve the overthrowing of the social order. This is powerfully stated in Pindar, Pythian II, 76-88 in which the purveyors of "slander", diabolia, are "harmful to the State", in direct contrast to "the man of straightforward speech" who "in every mode of government cometh to the front, whether at the tyrant's court, or where the boisterous host, or where the wise have care of the State." But Christianity by no means slighted these same moral sentiments. Just as pagans viewed Slith and Styx, hell itself, as claiming anyone who slandered a good reputation or betrayed an oath, so too, in the Life of St. Guthlac the diabolical tormentors of the saint were thrust into hell-fire because they were waer-logan (623), "oath-breakers". So deeply were these societies troubled by the social and even cosmic consequences of untruths. It was a sentiment most deeply felt by the Romans such as Quintilian (Instil Orat. 12, 1-2) who regarded the power of speech as nature's greatest gift to mankind and which was never intended to be the "accomplice of crime" sociam scelerum, "the foe of innocence, adversam innocentiae, and the "enemy of truth" hostem veritatis. As he states, "For it had been better for men to be born dumb and devoid of reason than to turn the gift of providence to their mutual destruction". Whoever did so was truly a diabolos, a hostis prolis humanae and a feond mancynnes, and had been regarded so long before the rise of the invidious Satan. Perhaps it is in this sense, of overthrower of order, that the term Godes andsaca was applied to Grendel; he is literally the "denier" (not merely the generalized 15 For Styx and oaths see also Iliad 2, 755; 15, 38.

He appears, in fact, to be this kind of ancient deofl and diabolos . But while he is too brutish to verbalize his animosity, he commits the ultimate diabolical offense of damaging Hrothgar's reputation by reducing him to a chief who has failed to prevent devastation in his hall. Grendel is a deofol in the ancient tradition of diabolos who moves stealthily for the destruction of the community; he moves out of personal en- vy, for which he needs no pact with Satan. For that reason the poet reviles Grendel, calling him daedhata, not a "deed-hater", but a "doer of hateful deeds", "in secret", deogol (275). Worst of all he is a heorowearh (1267), a "hostile criminal", and evokes images of the Icelandic vargr, [lone-] "wolf" or "outlaw", and the O.H.G. Warch, glossed as diabolus . He is an angenga, "one who walks alone", and "regularly", oft , prepetrator of "severe humiliations", heardra hyntha (165-66). For Hrothgar, that humiliation of his reputation was the greatest damage Grendel could do him (475). The harm is a social one in demeaning him not only in the eyes of his people but before the whole world, for his miserable plight had already been put in song for several years and had even reached Beowulf across the sea. Though Grendel is not a satanic devil but a social malignancy, there still remains the question of the nature of the syn(n) he is said to commit. Again, the same cultural frames of interpretation are involved - the Christian as opposed to the Classical and the Northern which, in turn very possibly evolved from prehistoric antecedents. Those early cultures and their epics seem to acknowledge in common more of the same ethic than does the Christian, except insofar as Christianity soon espoused some of these same values. Since these pre-Christian cultures (i.e. pre-New Testament) largely determined ethical belief on the basis of social judgments, sin in Grenders case would not have had personal, moral connotations. Moreover, he was too ignorant a fifel to grasp that, any more than he could have comprehended the notion of damage to his own soul or anyone elses. Tolkien, therefore, preferred tak- ing the large view of Grendel's syn, regarding it as Chaos as opposed to Light, with Light signifying Christianity. But such cosmic interpretations of sin are shared by most if not all early societies: among these Light is understood rather as Natural Order or Law. In that context "sin" or "evil" is any action that opposes or actually disturbs that Order. It is believed that if the sin or violation of the norms goes too far, the world will be destroyed. Thus, in that universal, cosmic sense Grendel may, indeed, be regarded as committing a syn insofar as he violates the primitive, pre- Christian sense of world Order. However, in Beowulf itself syn is more limited, and means "wrong-doing" or "crime" against others. Its social intrepretation stands somewhere between primitive cosmic violation and the later, developed concept of sin as a violation of the individual soul. The epic's view seems like a necessary transi- tion between the primitive and the later, more spiritually and ethically developed</page><page sequence="8">166 THALIA PHILLIES FELDMAN belief in individual responsibility for the self and the soul, as well as for the well- being of others. The evidence is borne out by the uses of syn in the poem: between the Swedes and Geats there were synn ond sacu, "wrong-doings and strife" (2742). Such overtly hostile acts were immoral, but in a social and legal sense rather than in a spiritual; in fact they were old-fashioned acts of vengeance.16 So too, the plunderer of the royal treasure held by the Dragons was synnum scildig (3071), "guil- ty of crimes". He had hardly violated himself so much as he had nearly devastated his people. Similarly, cannibal Grendel, synscatha (801), the "malefactor", is syn- num geswenced (975), "burdened with crimes", and a maga mane fah (978), a "youth guilty of a wicked deed".17 For his crimes Grendel will be judged in the afterlife by Metod, the "Apportioner", presumably in hel where such social crimes had long been punished among comitatus believers. This practice was also wholeheartely assumed by Christian believers who judged these crimes more severely, as sins, as deviations of personal morality as well.18 The epic, however, does not seem as yet to have gone quite along with that transition from social crime to per- sonal sin. The poet has not quite absorbed St. Augustine's philosophy which in- tegrated evil into Christian belief and so influenced the Middle Ages. For example, the poet still clings to the wergeld system which still took no account of the right or wrong action of the perpetrator provided that proper compensation was paid. It was Christian belief that added sin and penance to the notion of wergeld, provisions quite absent from Beowulf. At Heorot, instead, there was concern for the effects of syn on the body politic, but little if any on the soul of the perpetrator. Similarly, also, Grendel was "Keeper of crimes", a fyrena hyrde (750, 101, etc.) and of "many crimes" (164). 19 Klaeber, moreover, regards fyren as "ein feindliches furchtbares element, das über den menschen kommt, in sein herz dringt, ihn fesselt", which (the feindliches aside) defines it as a "crime of passion", an unthinking action.20 Such 16 Winifred Lehmann, "On Reflections of Germanic Terminology and Situation in the Edda*', in Edgar Polomé, Old Norse Literature and Mythology (Austin and London, 1969) 227-43. esp. 231, in rela- tion to kin. Also wroht, in BT shows progression of meaning from I. "accusation", to II, "false accusa- tion", "slander", to III, "what is an occasion for accusation, fault, crime". Thus wroht , synn and sacu are special kinds of disputes and crimes that need especially to be avenged by kin, or by the Dragon at the theft of its treasure, 2287, 2473, 2913. 17 As wiht unhaelo (120), Grendel is literally an "unhealthy creature", or a "creature of destruction", which does not automatically make him Satanic just because the obverse, haelobearn refers to the Christ- Child in Crist 586, 754. 18 Tolkien (above n. 2) 69-72, 87-89, gives "malefactor" for Grendel the synscatha, but for synnum beswenced lapses into the conventional "afflicted with sins", thus giving prejudicial coloring to the term, influenced by the fact that Grendel was considered a descendant of Cain. 19 Other uses of fyren similarly point out the same kind of disturbance to the social order. See lines 101, 137, 153, 164, 628, 750, 811. 20 Klaeber, (above n. 4) 128.</page><page sequence="9">A Comparative Study of 'Feond', ' Deofl ' 'Syn* and 'Hel' in Beowulf 167 were the crimes of the untutored Grendel, who 4 4 would not make peace with any man" sibbe ne wolde with manna hwone (1544-45). That wolde, from willan , mean- ing "to desire", has connotations of emotional, unthinking, wilful force. For the same reason Grendel did not think to pay compensation for his crimes (157-58). Such wilful passion also possessed (onwod) Heremod (915), the arrogant Modthrytho (1932) and Ongentheow's sons (2480). 21 This concept of syn and fyren was entirely consonant with the ideas of the comitatus whose paramount concern was for the well-being of its members and, conversely, for fear of its violation. Syn(n), however, eventually did evolve into "sin" in terms of Christian morality, just as did the Greek equivalent hamartia finally in the New Testament.22 In Beowulf, instead, syn seems closer to that of Homer's world in which hamartia still meant literally "failure", "the missing of a definite goal", as in missing a mark in hurling a spear, but more significantly, in neglecting cult responsibility or the laws of hospitality, both of which were grave offenses against the gods, Zeus especial- ly.23 Soon after Homer, Hesiod in his Works and Days (372ff) defined the concept of hamartia even further in terms of social injustice, and more significantly, within familial relationships, man's earliest and closest form of social organization. Accor- ding to him hamartia now extended to the dishonoring of parents, to divorce, or the oppression of orphans. Such familial misdeeds evoked the wrath of the gods as guarantors of law and social order. It is the Latin parallel errare, however, which later was used for the verb "to err", "to depart from the truth", that retains most closely notions of cosmic Order, for initially error meant a "wandering" or "going astray", not only of people but of planets, rivers and such natural phenomena. Closely analogous to errare in cosmic connotations is the O.E. worian which also referred to a wandering of the planets; in a figurative sense, however, it meant "doubting", "vacillating".24 Moreover, when error referred to a person, it did not imply moral deficiency but a sign that the gods were against him.

It was Hesiod who later expanded dikē further into "justice", the basis of the Classical democratic enlightenment. Yet traces of the older social discrimination survived in the West in the wergeld system in which degree of compensation kept being reckoned by status. These pagan concepts and practices regarding social behavior were readily adapted to Christian morality which developed and transformed them into personal accoun- tability and the soul. Similarly, sin was also syncretized further, this time in connec- tion with kinship and blood. There is, however, one significantly sinful act in Beowulf which both pagan and Judaeo-Christian belief would have regarded as in- volving both personal and social accountability. This sinful act occurs when Grendel consumes the body and blood of Beowulf's thane and kinsman (742-43): bat banlocan, blod edrum dranc, synsnaedum swaelh; It is a question whether this is an example of early Christian syncretization, or, of separate but analogous pagan belief. There is reason to suspect the latter and that it arose from analogous attitudes toward kindred blood. Fred Robinson quite rightly retains the literal meaning:27 He bit the bone-lock up, drank blood from the veins, swallowed the sinful morsels; He argues that O.E. prose had an "almost obsessive concern with the Old Testa- ment injunction of blood because it was identified with the 'soul' and, therefore, ac- counted for the poet's striking expression of 'sinful' [rather than "criminal"] morsels. Consequently, any Christian and indeed Judaic believers, at seeing the blood and soul of a fellow thane consumed by Grendel, would be equally horrified. But, more may be involved than the individual soul. Such concepts regarding blood go very far back in ancient pagan belief, and these were held well into the later 25 On synn in relation to kin, Lehmann (above, n. 16) 231. 26 W.K.C.

For example, tribal peoples such as the Athenians even into the Classical period continued to hold to the primitive belief that their members were all related by descent from common ancestors, and therefore, shared common blood. This also held true certainly among the Anglo- Saxon peoples whose earliest political structure lay in the maegõ, the "kindred", those groups united by one common blood and ancestry. They still, however, observ- ed class distinctions within the birth-grades of which the folk was composed, in con- trast to the Athenians who did not allow such social distinctions to form within the citizenry. In the Old English world this meant that for a man's oath to be acceptable before the early laws, his kindred group had to swear along with him, as warrantors of his oathworthiness, as extensions of himself so to speak.28 That was also the true basis of Athenian democracy itself which was based on the belief held by the citizens of the Ten Tribes that they shared common blood and thus common legal privileges and responsibilities. Since blood-ties were deemed part of Natural Law and were ultra-sacred, it was a social crime, as well as a personal sin, to kill and shed this shared blood.29 That bond of blood kinship and the self was so strong that the same verb, autokteinen, literally "self-slaying", was used for both "suicide" and "kin-slaying". Suicide as kin-slaying, was a paramount, ancient taboo of in- calculable age. Thus, Cain was not just the first murderer, he also committed the primal crime of mankind in killing his own blood and he was banished for it from society. Hence, it would seem that when Grendel killed the thane and drank his blood on top of that, he committed a sin even older than the horrifying act of his Old Testament ancestor Cain, something deemed morally sinful not only in Judaeo- Christian belief, but in pagan and for many ages past. Yet - how can that be? The victim was not Grendel's kin, but Beowulf's thane, one for whom the chief felt special relation and therefore, responsibility. Thus it is really Beowulf, not Grendel, who at that moment feels the sense of syn as guilt upon his own head at seeing his 28 Joliffe (above, n. 15) 2-3. 7-9. 29 Notions regarding blood pollution became more intense after the 8th c. B.C. in Greece, which meant that the bonds of kinship were tightening rather than loosening in time. G.M. Calhoun, The Growth of Criminal Law in the Ancient World (Berkeley, 1927) ch. 2 and 3. For that reason the Athenian citizens of the newly evolving democracy of the 6th and early 5th centuries, in order to avoid blood-guilt, saw fit to import foreign Scythians archers for their police-force to shoot down citizens in the act of com- mitting crimes. For that reason, too, Socrates was not put to death by the citizens themselves, but was required to take poison (not blood-shedding) by his own hand. The back-door of the prison was also left open for him to leave Attica, in which case he would be accounted as "dead", once beyond the confines of kin and tribe. But he chose to abide by the new concept of Law as required by the State. Such were the ambiguities of living in a transitional period of evolving statehood which still made uneasy com- promises with ancient tribal and kinship mores. The poet of Beowulf would have been sympathetic to those Attic dilemmas.</page><page sequence="12">170 THALIA PHILLIES FELDMAN thane and relative consumed, flesh, blood and soul. These morsels are indeed "sin- ful" in Beowulf's own eyes and his own soul that he should let this be happening. They may be GrendePs "crimes", but they are of no moral concern to him what- soever.30 For the poet, too, this is a sinful act on GrendePs part, however little that cannibal realizes it. In discussing this act further, Robinson makes the paradoxical but correct observation that Grendel acquires his supernatural power in being impervious to men's swords precisely by virtue of breaching so awesome a taboo." In fact this is how primitive thinking functions. Robinson gives the analogy of Grimr in Hrolf's Saga, who also drinks the blood of men and beasts and as a result is endowed with the power to make the Dam's swords ineffectual against him. Those who break a fearful taboo and survive without being blasted are, thereby, endowed with super- natural powers. The ultimate fate of the incestuous and sinful Oedipus of the Ty ra ri- no s who was later enshrined at Colonus is a prime example.32 Thus far it seems that Grendel has a preponderantly pagan inheritance, deriving mainly from his ancient flfelcyn. Furthermore, just as there are marked differences between Christian and pagan ethic as to what constitutes a syn or sin, there are the same differences as to hel and Hell. First, we might ask as to what extent either hell figures in Beowulf. The crux of the problem lies mainly in the meaning of the form helle as it appears in Klaeber's text and as taken from the manuscript. Again, Robin- son provides the most insight even though, admittedly, he applies his interpretation cautiously to only one case, the one involving Thorkelin's reconstruction of the work from "the crumbling edges of the folio leaf".33 In discussing that passage, involv- ing the punishment Unferth will receive in helle for having committed fratricide (588-89), Robinson would emend the helle to healle, meaning therefore that Unferth "must endure condemnation in the hall", instead of "in hell". Condemnation in that social climate meant that he could no longer remain with kin or peers at home, but must live in exile. Although given shelter in Hrothgar's court, Unferth is still not allowed to forget the fact of his crime by Beowulf who reminds him of it in that state- ment. Moreover, the emendation also logically explains his subsequent statement, "even though your wit is keen". Obviously keen wit is scarcely an asset in hell (except for Shaw's Don Juan), but it is precisely Unferth's critical intelligence and wit that 30 Beowulf cannot stop to consider his own moral responsibilities at this moment for Grendel is already reaching for him. How, at a later time, he handles or rather evades that responsibility for the vic- timized Hondscioh must be considered at another time. 31 Robinson (above, n. 5) 104. 32 Thalia Phillies Feldman, 4 'Taboo in the Oedipus Theme' in Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Assosiation, 93 (1962), 124-143. Robinson (above, n. 5).</page><page sequence="13">A Comparative Study of 'Feond', ' Deofl ', 'Syn' and 'Hel' in ' Beowulf 171 makes him tolerated in Heorot, indeed, even honored. Similarly, under like cir- cumstances as Unferth, Theoclymenus, the Argive kin-slayer in Od . 15, 271-81, 525-38, found refuge and honor with Telemachus, though not for his wit but for his mantic powers. Robinson, however, did not choose to emend the three other Beowulf passages in which helle might also be read as healle without violating logic and consistency. In the first emendation suggested (101), the warriors would then enjoy the Hall until Grendel begins to murder as the ' 'enemy in the hall", feond on healle, rather than as the textual paradox, "the enemy in heir', feond on helle . (What in heaven's name would an "enemy in heir' mean, anyway?) At that point Grendel was nowhere near hell. Similarly, Grendel howls with pain because he is trapped by the wound caused by Beowulf's mighty grip and thus is literally a "captive of the hall", healle haefton (788), rather than a "captive of hell", where he is not and never has been. It was the pain that held him captive, as indeed, Beowulf himself affirms later (975-77). Ac- tually, anyone still pressing for the reading "captive of hell" might then put Beowulf himself under diabolical suspicion for it is he who physically holds Grendel captive at this point.34 By similar emendation Beowulf lays Grendel the heallegast low precisely because he is literally the "hall-foe", not the "hell-foe" of the unemended text. Again, what would a "hell-foe" mean? Finally, in that last, emended form, Grendel is truly the ironic "hall-guest; just as earlier he is analogously mocked as the "hall-thane", healdegn (142). 35 Since Grendel had terrorized the Hall nightly for twelve years, the black irony cuts straight to the jugular; he had obviously done more time in the Hall than in Hell. Yet, undeniably, it is easy to see how a baptized copyist could easily have slipped Grendel from the Hall into the Christian Hell, as his own vision shifted from the communal good to a new regard for personal salva- tion in the after-life. But it does not seem that the poet himself as yet quite shared such a belief. His own use of his terminology remains literally and consistently pagan so that feond remains "enemy", syn is still social "crime", and helle is really healle, the "Hall". But, (and this is an all-important "but"), since the time of the epic's 34 It is assumed, since Klaeber's contention (above, n. 1) 254, that helle haefton is the translation for captivus infernus, the Latin periphrasis for the Devil, and thus in the epic is used in "a moral sense to emphasize the evil malignity of other beings". Dorothy Whitelock, The Audience of Beowulf { Oxford, 1951) 11, concurs. But even if we were to accept the helle as the original version and not the healle of my recommended emendation, then why cannot we assume that the reverse happened, namely, that the O.E. expression and its Germanic connotations of hel is the older concept, and later adapted into the Latin by Christiantiy? In that case the helle of helle haefton would refer in the epic to the pagan hel and hell- bonds, and not to the Christian Hell. 35 Norman Eliason, "Beowulf Notes", Anglia 71 (1952-53) 439. Goldsmith (above, n. 2) 108-9. For an appreciation of irony in the epic, see, R.

The confusion continues to this day. Words, are not fixed, con- crete, objective entities impervious to personal, individual experience and understan- ding. There is, however, one crucial instance in which Grendel is actually associated with hell and validly; because of his murders, hel finally received his haethene sawle (852).36 In this case the spelling is indisputably hel. It is presumed, therefore, that this was the place conceived for Christian sinners and embraced pagans as well. Yet even here we must not fall back on familiar assumptions. In the epic there is another reference to hel, but one of unquestionably pre-Christian belief, as the place to which the Anglo-Saxon chiefs of old had damned anyone robbing a certain treasure, the one eventually taken by the Dragon. In that curse the plunderer was to be fast-bound with "hell-bonds", hellbendum, specifically in idol shrines and doomed (3072) for committing such an anti-social act against the comitatus. Moreover, it is significant in terms of the consistent development of ethical ideology in the entire pre-Christian West that Vergil, too, still saw fit to stress such traditional themes of punishment in the Underworld for crimes of rebellion against authority, and particularly for corrupt behavior toward society, and kin especially. In Aeneid 6, 577 - 91, he condemns the titans, sons of Earth, among others for rebellion against deity. For punishment these titans and rebels lie in Tàrtarus alongside those who had fought against their own country or broken faith with their lord (6, 608 - 14). Even more significantly, they writhe beside those who hated their brethren, smote a parent, committed adultery, or entangled clients [regarded as members of the extended Roman familia], or finally, who had never given a portion of their wealth to needy kin. Vergil still honored the values of the small comitatus society of the old Republic which took severe account of both religious and social transgressions which threatened the established order and the interdependent net- work of divinity, of kin, and all their obligations. It was for the punishment of such acts that the pagan hel was conceived. It is a question, therefore, whether the hell which was to receive Grendel's heathen soul was not also that same pagan one rather than the Hell of exclusively Christian belief. It has often been remarked how that hell in Beowulf is totally lacking in the iconography identified with early medieval Christian poetry, having none of the references to fallen angels, torments by fire and such, as in Genesis, Christ, and 36 Klaeber maintains that Grendel goes to Hell because he is a devil, (above, n. 4) 268.</page><page sequence="15">A Comparative Study of 'Feond', ' DeofV, ' Syn ' and 'Hel' in 'Beowulf' 173 Christ and Satan?1 Therefore there are grounds for suggesting that in the epic there is only one version of hell, namely the hel long known to heathen social trans- gressors. Grimm, in fact, also points to this Beowulf passage as retaining perfectly the meaning of hel as it was used in Old Norse to refer originally to the goddess Hel Originally Hel was not an evil being or tormentor, but one assigned to take (cf. onfeng, Beowulf 852) the departed heathen souls and hold them in an inexorable grip, possibly in hell-bonds. Her dwelling-place was deep underground, as Grimm describes it, . .the place which the converted heathens without ado applied to the Christian underworld . . . perhaps because the Church was not sorry to associate the lost spirits with a heathen and fiendish divinity."38 One last note on hel as hell in the epic, a place which the poet himself takes very little into account. In fact at one point when he speaks of Grendel joining the helrunan in his rounds, those "beings skilled in the mysteries of heV' witches and sorcerers presumably, he is uncertain where they are located, "men do not know where the helrunan move" (163 - 64). Presumably these are above ground where Grendel searches them out in the fens.39 In any case, whatever the nature of hel to which Grendel is to be consigned at death - exclusively pagan, exclusively Christian, or even possibly an amalgam of both - he must have been conceived of as a human, truly a wer by virtue of the fact that he had a sawol (852).40 He was not a monster, even an anthropomorphic one, for these did not possess souls nor were they con- signed to punishment in the Underworld. This, surely, is the most incontrovertible internal argument of all for accepting Grendel as a man, this and the fact that he was descended of Cain despite all his ambiguously supernatural fifelcyn . But though he was a man, and as such transcending his fifelcyn, he still lived by cannibalizing 37 Klaeber (ibid.) 266, includes numerous references in which the Christian apparatus for Hell is in full force. But Vergil already also includes as punishment in Avernus all the apparatus later to be adopted for Christian Hell: the clanking chains, the lashes and groans and cries all enclosed by "a rushing flood of torrent flames", and more, Aeneid 6, 548-58. Etruscan punitive concepts of the Underworld as seen in their tomb paintings, must have had much to do with Vergil's imagery, and affected Christians quite pro- foundly. 38 Chadwick (above, n. 11) 24.
