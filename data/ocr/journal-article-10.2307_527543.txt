"Yahweh commands Moses to consecrate to him all the first-born of man and cattle.-Proceeding from Succoth, the Israelites encamp in Etham; but they are soon ordered to go back to Pi-hahiroth, in order that Pharaoh may think that they have lost their way in the wilderness, and so pursue them- to his own destruction. Pharaoh, hardened by Yahweh, does pursue. Moses is instructed to divide the waters of the Red Sea, by the touch of his hand, and thus effect a passage on dry land for the children of Israel. Pharaoh is induced by Yahweh to follow; then, Moses, by another motion of the hand, reunites the waters, and the entire Egyptian host perishes. Having made a short stop at Elim, an oasis, the' entire congregation ' arrives in the Wilderness of Sin, where they complain because of lack of food. 'Yahweh's glory' appears in a cloud, and announces that, in answer to the people's demands, flesh will be pro- vided in the evening, and bread in the morning; the latter comes as manna-just an omer for each person. But on Friday, a double portion is obtained, that tbey may have no work to do on the Sabbath.-Aaron is instructed to lay by an omer of manna as a memorial for future generations.-The children of Israel then pro- ceed to Rephidim." 3.

[These are due, probably, to exactness of statement.] Remark.-The greater number of these new words strictly belong to P's legal vocabulary. 4. STYLE OF P. It is marked by 1) Formulas: (1) "l *Y1 N r ;-7 *) 't) " (13:1; 14:1; 16:11) found scores of times in the P code; (2) 3j) .... 9D (13:20; 17:1); cf. Num. 33, where this expression occurs over forty times; (3) "~"j K "ji (14:2,15), very frequent in the code; (4) T'i;t '34 '3 (14:4,18; 16:12), a standard phrase. 2) Exactness of statement: (1) Etham "at the end of the desert" (13:20); (2) Pi-hahiroth was "between Migdol and the sea, before Baal-Zephon" (14:2); (3) the Wilderness of Sin "which is between Elim and Sinai" (16:1); (4) they gath- ered twice as much bread, "two omers for each one" (16:22). 3) N umbers and Dates: (1) "Twelve springs of water, and seventy palm trees" (15:27); (2) "on the 15th day of the 2d month" (16:1); (3) "the omer was a tenth of an ephah" (16:36). 4) Repetition: (1) 13:2b might be omitted; (2) last clause of 14:2 is superflu- ous; (3) 14:9b is unnecessary, after the minute description of v. 2; (4) 14:29 is practically the same as v. 22; (5) 16:6sq. are summed up and elaborated in v. 8, and form a clumsy repetition; (6) the last six words in 16:16 are a legal repeti- tion; (7) 16:18b is unnecessary; (8) 16:32a is practically repeated in v. 33. 5. MATERIAL. P, as compared with the prophets, presents the following: 1) Duplicates: (1) Consecration of first-born (P = 13:2; J = 13:12-15); (2) God leads the people to the sea (E = 13:17sq.; P = 14:1-3); (3) the Egyptians pursue (P = 14:4,8 sq.; JE = 14:5-7); (4) there is evidently more than one account of the passage of the Red Sea, and of the destruction of the Egyptians, in 14:15- 31, [for so much repetition could not possibly be charged to one writer, even if he were P; nor can we account for the incongruities (see differences, below) on the hypothesis of a single authorship]; (5) heavenly food is promised (J = 16:4; P = 16:6-8,12); (6) instruction concerning the gathering of the manna (J = 16: 4sq.; P =- 16:16); (7) manna on the Sabbath (P -= 16:22 sq.; J = 16:25-30); (8) manna is named twice (J = 16:15; P = 16:31). 2) Differences. The double accounts become clearer when we find that they differ in important particulars: (1) the law about the first-born cannot be dis-</page><page sequence="4">244 HEBRAICA. cussed until we are ready to consider the various codes, for other passages must be taken into consideration; (2) the reason for leading the people to the Red Sea is, according to E, "for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt" (13:17); according to P, in order to deceive Pharaoh, that he might think the Israelites had lost their way (14:3); (3) the king of Egypt pursues, because "Yahweh hardens his heart " (P = 14,4,8), but JE says, because "he learned that the people were fled " (14:5); (4) in the passage of the Red Sea, we notice (a) that the sea is made dry, according to P, by Moses stretching forth his hand and dividing the waters (14:16); according to J, by a terrible gale blowing all night (14:21); (b) that the Egyptians enter the sea, according to P, because Yahweh hardened their hearts to pursue Israel (14:17,23); according to the prophets, because they were thrown into confusion (14:24 sq.); (5) according to J, the people received nothing but manna (16:4); but P gives them manna only in the morning, and flesh in the evening, 16:8,12 sq.;* (6) in J, the double portion on Friday is a part of the original arrangement (16:5); while in P, the gatherers are surprised to receive two omers on the sixth day (16:22); (7) P speaks of the Sabbath as an old institution (16:23), having in mind Gen. 2:2 sq.; but, according to J, Moses institutes it for the first time, and some of the people do not accept his authoritative statement concerning it (16:25-30). 3. Incongruities. Granting the bare possibility of (a) a double purpose in God's leading the people to the sea, of (b) a double motive for Pharaoh's pur- suit, and supposing (c) that God might wish to supplement Moses' weak hand by a mighty wind, and (d) that Moses did not tell the people of the double portion on Friday, we nevertheless find it difficult to conceive (1) of an army in pursuit and confusion at the same time; (2) how Moses could promise flesh and bread, when God promised only the latter (16:4,8), and, at a later time, punished severely the demand for meat (Num. 11:18-20,33). Then (3) would one author make a state- ment about the consecration of the first-born in 13:2, talk about something else in the same paragraph (vs. 3-10), and afterwards begin anew with the first-born (vs. 11-15(?)), or (4) would he, after relating that "the people said one to another, It is manna" (16:15), and having told practically all about the manna, add the statement, " And the house of Israel called its name manna " (16:31a) ? (5) 16: 36 has no connection where it stands; its proper place is probably after v. 16; (6) 17:1, if it be connected with the following verse, locates Meribah at Rephidim; but Num. 20:1; 27:14 make Kadesh the place. * P has really combined two distinct events in one: the Prophets tell us (Num. 11:4-6 (before which passage J's account of the manna stood originally), 18-20, and 31-34), that after the people became tired of the manna, they began to cry for meat, and this was given, not indeed to satisfy, but to destroy them. It is, however, manifestly difficult for P to enter into such details; because (a) it would take too much space (and he is anxious to get to his great work, the code); (b) it would make the people unnecessarily rebellious (he is mainly interested in recording the futile and impious protestations of the laity against the priesthood, ef. Numbers, chs. 16 sq.); (c) it would give a representation of Yahweh which would be inconsistent with P's theology.</page><page sequence="5">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 245 6. THEOLOGY. 1) God's commands are formal: (1) He ordered Israel to encamp at the sea, "and they did so " (14:1-4); (2) Moses is ordered to stretch out his hand and divide the sea, and he does it (14:15,16,21a); (3) he is then ordered to unite the water by stretching forth his hand, and it is done (14:26 sq.); (4) God commands an omer-ful of manna to be laid by, and Aaron does, "according as Yahweh com- manded Moses " (16:32-34). 2) The sea is divided by a fiat of the Almighty (cf. J, Yahweh makes use of a strong east wind). Note also how complete the miracle is: (1) the sea is not merely parted, but the passage is turned into dry-land (0739, 14:22,29); (2) the waters stood as a wall on both sides; (3) as soon as the Egyptians enter, Moses by a motion of the hand closes the sea. 3) Aaron is made prominent : (1) "the congregation murmurs against Moses and Aaron" (16:2), and both reply (16:6) (cf. J (15:24sq.; 17:2) where Moses alone is looked upon as leader); (2) Moses tells Aaron to bring the congregation into the presence of Yahweh (16:9 sq.); (3) it is Aaron who lays by the manna before the fl Y (16:33sq.). 4) God's glory appears in a cloud (cf. Lev. 16:2, and 13), to show the unap- proachableness of the Deity. B. Element of J. 1. VERSES ASSIGNED. 13:3-16,21 sq.* (Well., 3-16 = Rd Or p3~; so Kuen. and Jill.

SYNOPSIS. "Moses commands unleavened, and prohibits leavened, bread to be eaten for seven days in the month of Abib, to commemorate the hasty exodus; while all first-born males are to be consecrated in commemoration of the last plague in Egypt.-Yahweh leads the people by a cloud, in the daytime, and by a pillar of fire in the night.-The king of Egypt, on learning that the people have run away, pursues them with an army. At his approach, the children of Israel are fright- ened, and cry to Yahweh. They also blame Moses for bringing them into the wilderness-to die. But he assures them that they see the Egyptians for the last time: 'Yahweh will fight for you !' Thereupon the cloudy pillar takes its station between the hostile forces. In the night a strong gale sweeps over the sea, making it dry. At dawn, Yahweh appears in a pillar of fire and cloud, and the Egyptians, perceiving his presence, flee into the receding sea, where Yahweh destroys them. The signal deliverance inspires Israel with reverence for Yahweh, and with trust in him and Moses.--[~l*Food is provided for the hungry nation from heaven daily, except on Friday, when they receive a double portion. They call the heavenly bread manna. They are ordered not to leave any over night; some disobey, and it spoils.

[= E]; 13:21 [= J]); (2) he fights for them (14:14,25 -[= J]; 14:24b,25a[-= E]). 2) Sacrifice exists before the formal founding of the theocracy: (1) Moses builds an altar to commemorate the victory over Amalek (17:15 [= E]); (2) Jethro offers up an )y and t' .* to God, and Aaron and the elders partake of the religious feast (18:12 [= El). 3) J records the institutions of (1) the feast of unleavened bread (13:3-7); (2) the consecration of the first-born males (13:11-15); (3) the Sabbath (16:29). It is worthy of notice that these are not given directly as laws, but rather as national institutions to commemorate historical events. "Remember," says Moses, "you left Egypt in haste, and so let no leaven be eaten" (13:3); "Because God slew every first-born in Egypt, therefore do I sacrifice all that opens the womb, etc." (13:15); "For this reason does God give you a double portion on Friday, that ye may rest on the Sabbath" (16:29). 4) God uses natural means to accomplish his ends: (1) the east wind (14:21b); (2) a saccharine(?) tree (15:25 [= E]). 5) According to E, the officers of the theocracy were elected (1) before the law was given; (2) by the advice of a heathen priest (18:21-26).

SYNOPSIS. "When Pharaoh dismisses the people, God leads them not by way of Philistia, though (?) that is the nearest route, fearing that they might return to Egypt, if they should encounter an enemy. So God causes them to go around to the Red Sea, by way of the wilderness; although they were well armed. Moses takes Joseph's remains with him, in accordance with the solemn charge of Joseph to his brothers. -Pharaoh, regretting that he has allowed the people to go, pursues them with a large army. God tells Moses to act rather than pray. God's angel shifts his post from the van to the rear of the camp, and throws the Egyptian army into con- fusion by removing the wheels from their chariots. Then Miriam, at the head of a female choral procession, celebrates Pharaoh's destruction with a song of tri- umph; while Moses and the people sing a hymn of praise and victory to him who is 'glorious in holiness, and who doeth wonders.'--From the Red Sea, they wan- der in the desert of Shur for three days without water. On reaching Marah, they find water, but it is bitter. The people complain; Moses prays, and God* points out a tree which sweetens the water. Moses impresses upon them the necessity of obedience. [At Rephidimt] they are again without water, and again complain. In answer to Moses' prayer, God* says,' Lead the people to the rock of Horeb, where I await thee, and smite it with thy rod, and water will come forth.' It is done.-Amalek then comes and offers battle to Israel. Moses sends Joshua, with selected warriors, into the field; while he himself, accompanied by Aaron and Ilur, ascends to the hill. The hands of Moses, uplifted all day (in prayer(?)), decide the fate of the struggle in favor of Israel, and Joshua gains the victory. Moses is ordered to record the event, and to impress it on Joshua that Amalek is to be blotted out. And he builds an altar to commemorate the victory. [Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, visits the camp, bringing Moses' family. After some friendly conversation, the 'priest of Midian ' offers sacrifices to God, and Aaron as well as the elders partake of the sacrificial feast. Next day he advises Moses to appoint officers, who shall assist him in the arduous duties of governing the nation. The plan is adopted, and Jethro returns to his country.?]" 3.

[Cf. under J, pp. 9-11.] Of E's peculiarities we note the following: (1) the use of "the angel of God" (14:19a); (2) a fondness for "three-days' journeys" (15:22); (3) the name of Moses' father-in-law, ?'S (18:1,2,5,6,9,10,12). 5. MATERIAL. [J and E are here compared and contrasted.] 1) Single accounts: There are, in fact, only two stories which clearly show the traces of editorial combination in the prophetic material; otherwise, the narra- tive is from one or the other source. (1) From J, we have the account of (a) the institution of the feast of Mazzoth (13:3-10); (b) the consecration of the first-born (13:11-16) [both of which are explicitly connected with the stories of the "last plague in Egypt," and the "hasty exodus," as recorded by the same author in previous material (Ex. 11:4-8; 12:29sq.; 12:34,39)]; (c) the gift of the manna and the Sabbath (16,1 combined with P). [For E's version of the manna story, cf. Num. 11:7-9; (also 21:5, where $1 fl5 D is usually interpreted to mean manna); but the Sabbath is, according to E, given at Horeb (20:8 sq.)]. (2) From E come the following events: (a) the taking along of Joseph's remains (13:19), reminding us of Joseph's testament (Gen. 50:24sq.); (b) the battle with Amalek (17:8-13); (c) Jethro's visit (18)-all of which are marked by the prevailing name of Oti .4 (3) Ch. 15 belongs properly, as Jill. claims, to J, as can be seen by the invariable use of 4l'7 (fifteen times in all, not counting v. 19, which is * While the Deut. passages are neither J nor E, they are still prophetic, and may be loosely cited. + Nowhere else in Hexateuch. $ J's account, however, belongs probably before Num. 11:4, where the subject will be more fully treated. ? The presence of flfl' in some verses of ch. 18 is more easily explained by supposing it to be the work of R than on any other theory; as, e. g., 1) that D'fL7 is only used in the mouth of Heathen; (but Jethro, the Gentile uses fl~1' in vs. 10sq., while Moses, the supposed narrator, uses mostly D'fi7t); 2) that f1' is distinctly the name used in connection with God's dealings with Israel; (but 17:1a is decidedly against this). We find also other traces of R in vs. 1,9sq. [Cf. Dill., II., p. 184. 1</page><page sequence="11">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 251 clearly the work of R in an effort to harmonize P with the prophets); besides, v. 10a naturally refers to J's statement in 14:21, and v. 5a connects with J's por- tion of 14:27. Yet vs. 13-17 betray a late hand, of one to whom not only the settlement in Canaan was a matter of the past (note the perfect of all the principal verbs), but also of its establishment as a "holy habitation" (v. 13), "the moun- tain of God's inheritance, and the place of the sanctuary." Hence the name n1;7 may also be due to this later hand; and if, as Dill., etc., claim, E is the earliest of the prophets, we may assume that the original song (bearing undoubted signs of antiquity) existed first in his document. One thing is certain: P had nothing to do with it. 2) Duplicates and diferences: (1) In the account of Pharaoh's disaster, we note (a) that Israel's guide shifts his position from the van to the rear of the camp (E = 14:19a; J = 19b); but this guide is, according to E, the "angel of God" [so char- acteristic of E], but according to J the "pillar of cloud" (consistent with his statement in 13:21 sq.); (b) the confusion of the Egyptians is due, according to J, to the appearance of Yahweh in the "two pillars" (14:24a), but according to E, to the removal of their chariot wheels (by the angel) (14:25a). (2) In the story of .Meribah (17:2-7) we note (a) v. 3 is a clumsy repetition of v. 2; but (b), according to J, Moses rebukes the people's demands (v. 2b), while according to E, he prays for water (v. 4); (c) the name (i7l'T i b ) is only appropriate to the terms used by J in 2b; (d) while there is no connection between the whole story and 17:1 (= P), we may well suppose with R that the event took place at Rephidim [cf. v. 8]. Remark: The comparison of this composite prophetic account of the " waters of Meribah " with P's version of the same event (Num. 20:1-13), will be deferred till we reach that point. 6. THEOLOGY.

MATERIAL. [Best given in the form of remarks.] 1) Aside from the minute instructions about the Tabernacle (which occupy seven chapters), what P fails to record is more noteworthy than what he tells: he knows nothing about (1) the thunders of Sinai (his great revelation is to emanate from the Tabernacle (cf. 25:22; Lev. 1:1; Num. 7:89); (2) the nation's</page><page sequence="13">Tiu PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 253 apostasy (it would hardly do to record so early an act of idolatry, and that, too, under Aaron's vice-regency and superintendence); (3) the "ten words" (the entire law is equally important and binding); (4) the "covenant of blood " (since there are yet no altar and priests). 2) The points of contact between P and the prophets are (1) Moses ascends the cloud-covered mountain; (2) where God manifests his presence; and (3) he receives some laws on two tablets; (4) while his return causes consternation among the people.-But note the following 3) Differences: (1) According to the prophetic account, God appears in the cloud (J = 19:9; E = 20:21b); according to P, the cloud simply covers the moun- tain, while the fl,t ") is distinct from it (24:16a), appearing as a burning flame (24:17a); (2) the laws received were, according to P, instructions about the Tabernacle (chs. 25-31); according to the prophets, the "book of the covenant" (E = chs. 21-23; J = 34:10-27); (3) the Tables contained, according to J and E(?), the Ten Words (34:28); according to P, the rJT.f. (31:18a; 82:15a; 34:29); (4) Moses' return inspires fear, according to J and E, because of their insubordina- tion (J - 82:19bsq.; E = 32:26-28); according to P, because of his shining face (34:29b sq.). 4) If the entire account of Sinai, as we find it, is from one author, it is decidedly strange (1) that Moses' face had never shone before, in his many inter- views with God(?); (2) that the writer should make Moses ascend four times in succession, without descending once (24:9,13,15,18(?)) [repetition explains only the last two]; (3) that the writer should represent Yahweh choosing Aaron as his high priest (ch. 28), just about the time when Aaron is making the golden calf (32:4 sq.). 5) The detailed discussion of the Tabernacle, with all that is connected there- with, belongs to the legal argument which is to be considered later.* 8. THEOLOGY OF P. 1) The first step toward the establishment of the theocracy, is the building of a sanctuary (25:8), and the inauguration of the Priesthood (28:1). 2) He knows of no altars, till the altar is ordered (27:1); and of no sacrifices, before the priests are installed (ch. 29:1-37). 3) Every detail about the making of the Tabernacle, its furniture, and even the priestly attire was directly communicated to Moses from Yahweh. 4) The regular services (= the morning and evening sacrifices and incense) are instituted from the very beginning, and in all their details (29:38-30:10). 5) It is only Moses (the law-giver) who is favored with a divine halo, and even he only in connection with the revelation of the laws (34:29-35, especially v. 34). * The reader is referred to Dill., II., pp. 269-272, for a very impartial statement.</page><page sequence="14">254 HEBRAICA. 6) Aaron and his family are especially pointed out as the priestly family (28:1 41b; 30:30), which is forever to be hereditary (28:43b; 30:21b).

Aaron and the elders see God, but Moses alone remains forty days on the mount. The people, thinking that Moses will never return, command Aaron to make them a god, and the golden calf is the result. Aaron builds an altar, institutes a feast, and the people offer sacrifices. Yahweh informs Moses of the apostasy, and, in his anger, is determined to destroy the nation; but Moses interceding reminds him of his oath to the patriarchs, and he repents.-As Moses approaches the camp, in his anger, the tables (of the covenant ?) fall from his hands and are broken. He utterly destroys the calf, rebukes Aaron, and makes the people realize the enor- mity of their sin; still again he pleads with Yahweh, who finally agrees to send his angel to lead them to the promised land, without granting, however, a com- plete pardon. Moses is puzzled, and asks for a more complete revelation of Yahweh's providential dealings. It is granted, and Yahweh appoints a special place, where Moses is to meet him next morning, with another set of stone-tablets. There he reveals to him his attribute of mercy as well as of righteousness. Moses makes a final appeal, asking Yahweh, as a personal favor, to go with them, and to pardon their transgressions.

[J and E are considered together.] It is 1) Easy and Flowing.-This point is especially noticeable in this section, which is decidedly legal in its intent and content, but different in its tone and spirit from P: (1) the preceding history, elaborate, interesting and instructive as it may be, cannot be considered a mere introduction to the brief "book of the covenant;" (2) while the covenant at Sinai has an august, almost awful, dignity (infinitely more so than in P's passing notice), it is not disproportionately treated when compared with other events, as the apostasy or reconciliation; (3) nor is the revelation at Sinai the climax of the narrative: it is an event, important indeed, but not the all-important one; and (4) it is surely not the culmination of the his- tory, since the succeeding events receive fully as much attention as this or any other one. 2) Yividc, Descriptive.-This also is the more strikingly illustrated in this sec- tion, since from the nature of the material we least expect it. We note (1) the picturesque scenes of (a) the nation trembling at the foot of the thundering, smok- ing, burning mountain; (b) the sinful nation, engaged in idolatrous orgies; (c) the repenting nation, watching reverently Moses' communion with God; (2) poetic phrases: (a) "I bear you on eagles' wings" (19:4); (b) "let not a hand touch it" (19:13); (c) "as the smoke of a furnace " (19:18); (d) "a paved work of sapphire stone, and as it were the very heaven for brightness " (24:10); (e) " written with</page><page sequence="17">THE PENTATETUCHAL QUESTION. 257 the finger of God "' (31:18b); (f) "blot me out of thy book " (32:32); (g) "he did neither eat bread nor drink water " (84:28); (3) the emphatic infinitive: (a) gy 1Y3W (19:5; 23:22); (b) IInV nm (19:12); (c) ~ri" ;-r, '~PD' 'ijD (19:13); (d) rpr flj) (34:7); (4) traits of human nature: (a) the people prefer to have Moses speak to them (19:19); (b) Moses is late, and the people become impatient for a new leader (32:1); (c) in his anger, Moses breaks the tablets (32:19); (d) Aaron, in trying to exonerate himself before Moses, fails to tell the whole truth: instead of telling that "he formed it, and made it a molten calf" (32:4), he says, " I cast it (the gold) in the fire, and out came this calf," as if by chance (32:24); (e) Moses acts resolutely (32:26-29); (f) the penitents rise and remain standing, as Moses passes (33:8). 3) Anthropomorphic: (1) the usual phrase of "Yahweh coming down " (19:11, 18,20; 34:5); (2) in his anger, Yahweh is determined to destroy the people, then he repents, etc. (32:10,14); (3) the great argument used by Moses is that Yahweh's reputation will suffer (32:12); (4) Yahweh speaks to Moses, "as one man to another" (33:11); (5) the whole presentation of Yahweh revealing his glory to Moses is very strange (33:18-23); (6) God is plainly visible (24:10,11), though, probably, not his face (33:20). 4)' Prophetic (= giving religious instruction); as before, every story carries with it a great truth. (1) Obedience to God is the ground of Israel's supremacy over other nations (19:5); (2) the entire body of believers is to be a "kingdom of priests" (19:6); (3) the great things emphasized on Sinai consist in the proper attitude toward God and man (20:1-17); (4) wherever God manifests his presence, there worship is proper (20:24); (5) God protects and blesses those who do his will (23:20-31); (6) the intercession of the righteous averts God's anger (32:9-14); (7) God withholds nothing from those in whom he is well pleased (33:12-17); (8) God is compassionate, merciful and forgiving; but sin must be punished (34:6 sq.). 5. MATERIAL. [To be considered under E; cf. pp. 260 sqq.] 6. THEOLOGY OF J AND E. 1) Altars are to be erected of any material in any place where God reveals himself, just as heretofore (20:24sq.): Moses himself builds an altar (note the invariable absence of the article) at the foot of the mountain (24:4). 2) Moses builds also twelve "pillars "* (one for each tribe), which are expressly forbidden both in I)eut. (16:22) and in Lev. (26:1).t [Cf. Gen. 28:18.] * The context clearly shows that they were made for religious purposes, since they are men- tioned together with the building of the altar, preparatory to sacrifices (24:4 sq.). + This is not the place for a fuller discussion of the subject (it must be deferred for the "legal argument"); it may, however, be remarked that 34:13 and 23:24 [= R(?)] only enjoin the destruction of heathen "pillars," but do not forbid the "pillars." *3</page><page sequence="18">258 HEBRAICA. 3) There is no special priesthood for sacrifice: (1) the whole nation is to be a "kingdom of priests " (19:6); (2) the "young men " offer up the covenant sacrifices, at Moses' own bidding (24:5); (3) Moses himself sprinkles the blood (which is the highest act in any sacrifice) (24:6,8); (4) Aaron is the one who makes the calf (32:4 = J), or at least is the cause of the apostasy (32:25 = E); (5) intercession and atonement for the sinful nation are made, not by a priest and propitiation, but by a prophet and prayer (32:11); (6) in the mind of the nation also, Moses (not Aaron) was God's representative on earth; hence, in his absence, they clamored for another god (32:1). 4) All throughout the account of the apostasy, the reciprocal treatment between God and Moses is one of intimacy and familiarity, if not equality: (1) God says to Moses, "Thy people have corrupted themselves....and now let me alone" (32:7,10); (2) Moses uses, "Why should the Egyptians say," as an argu- ment (32:12); (3) Moses says, "If thy presence go not, carry us not up hence" (33:15).

SYNOPSIS. "....trAnd Israel encamped there (= at Horeb) opposite the mountain, and Moses ascended to God. In view of the solemn covenant that is to be made on the mountain, the people are cautioned not even to touch it. They are also instructed to wash themselves and their garments. On the third day, amidst thunder and lightning, Moses presents the people to God, at the foot of the burn- ing mountain, where God utters the Ten Commandments.$ The people naturally keep at a distance; Moses alone approaches the dark spot where God is, and is ordered to emphasize to the people again the fact that no images are to be made in God's worship, but altars (of earth or stone) are to be built in any place where God should vouchsafe his presence and blessing. Then he builds an altar (also twelve pillars for the tribes of Israel), and commissions the 'young men' to offer up sacrifices, sprinkling half of the blood on the altar, and half on the people, and a feast completes the ceremonies of the covenant.fl-Leaving Aaron and Hur to manage the people's affairs, Moses goes up with Joshua to the ' Mount of God,' where he receives a code of social, civil and religious laws, for the observance of which many temporal blessings are promised, especially the subjection of the promised land. [He also receives]? tablets of stone written with God's finger on both sides. Joshua calls his attention to extraordinary shouts from the camp. As he approaches, Moses discovers that, owing to Aaron's mismanagement, the people have broken all religious restraint and are in a state of anarchy. He finds, however, the ' children of Levi' still loyal, and orders them to quell the rebellion by the sword. Some three thousand of the people are killed. God** threatens them with complete destruction, and orders them to give up their ornaments, which they do. [.... ttThis furnishes the money for the construction of the 'Tent * Here, according to all critics, was originally E's account of the building of "Tent of Meet- ing," for which the ornaments of v. 6 were used.

As a sign of repent- ance, the people rise in their tents and look after Moses till he enters the tent, and at the descent of the cloudy pillar they prostrate themselves.

Num. 22:22); (6) Moses ascends to receive the law, according to J, alone (24:12--18b); but according to E, he takes Joshua with him (24:13); (7) accord- ingly, when the apostasy occurs, Moses learns about it from Yahweh, according to J (32:7); but in E's account, Joshua calls his attention to the uproar in the camp (32:17); (8) in J, the people's sin consists in the making of the calf (32:4- 6); E refers to it as mere rebellion (32:25); (9) hence, Moses' action, on his return, is, according to J, to destroy the calf (32:20); but according to E, to quell the insurrection, by the aid of his clan (32:26-28); (10) in J's story, the people do not put on their ornaments of their own accord, because they mourn over their lost favor with Yahweh (33:3b sq.); but in E's account, they are ordered to remove them, as a penalty for their transgression (33:5 sq.); (11) according to J, recon- ciliation is effected by Moses' repeated intercession (32:11-13,31 sq.; 33:12-16; 84:9); but according to E, by the people's repentance, as shown by their ready surrender of their ornaments, and their reverent attitude toward the holy place (33:6-10); (12) the many points of difference in the two codes (21-23, and 34:10- 26) are beyond the scope of this article, which is purely historical. 3) Incongruities: (1) 19:3bK is strange after 3a; when Moses had gone up to God, Yahweh calls him from the mountain (note also the sudden, unaccountable change from b'rVi to gyp); (2) 19:9b is meaningless as it stands, especially after 8b, and is best explained as having had originally a different connection; (3) 19:18 tells us that Sinai was all smoking, "because that Yahweh had come down" (the perfect "'l? after the perfect IY , must be translated by a pluper- feet), and v. 19b adds that Moses was already conversing with God; but v. 20 * For a full discussion of this point, of.

What, then, does 24:1 mean, when it reads, "And unto Moses he said, Come up to Yahweh, etc.?" In fact, the phrase by t3 r r7t syntactically implies that what has gone before has not been said unto Moses just there and then; (6) but having received this summons, it is diffi- cult to see why Moses should do so many things (enumerated in 24:3-8) before obeying it; (7) according to v. 9, he finally does as ordered in v. 1, and ascends; what then does v. 12a mean, reading, "And Yahweh said unto Moses, Come up unto me to the mountain, etc.?" (8) Whly should there be so much guess-work on the part of Joshua and Moses (32:17sq), when the latter was plainly told by Yahweh himself of the people's apostasy (32:7 sq.)? (9) The massacre instituted by Moses (32:26-29) seems as cruel as it was unnecessary, after his action in v. 20: if they submitted without murmur to have their idol destroyed, and to drink water in which its powdered remains were mingled, as a penalty [cf. Num. 5:17- 22], why inaugurate a wholesale slaughter against an unresisting, penitent people ? (10) On the other hand, his gracious disposition the next morning (32:30-32) seems to be that of either another Moses or of another writer; (11) why the people should mourn so much at the announcement that Yahweh is going to send an angel to banish the Canaanitish tribes (33:2,4), which is almost an exact repetition of the original promise made before the apostasy (23:23), is quite inexplicable; (12) after Yahweh's repeated assurance that "his presence" would accompany the people (33:14-17), Moses' prayer, in 34:9a, has no meaning. 4) Traces of editorial combinations: (1) All the foregoing instances of (a) repeated material; (b) different presentations, and (c) incongruous statements- show clearly that two accounts have here been interwoven together; (2) on the other hand, there are no important omissions [as can be seen from the Synopses under J and E] ; (3) the only exception to the preceding remark is in the case of the account of the "Tent of Meeting," which is absolutely demanded before 33:7, and which R evidently omitted in favor of the fuller account of P; (4) the most striking feature of R's work in this section is, however, the numerous misplace- ments of material; of these we note the more important: (a) 20:1 sounds very abrupt after 19:25, but it fits well after 19:19, where it belongs; (b) the introduc- tory verse, 21:1, is hardly appropriate, since the foregoing verses (20:23-26) are also laws; (c) 24:1 does not go well with 23:33; nor, in fact, with any of E's mate- rial [cf. (5) under 3), above], but falls in with 19:25; (d) 24:3 is only appropriate immediately after some code [hence it is assigned after 34:10-27], but not after 24:1 sq.; (e) the more detailed description of the Tablets (32:15b sq.) naturally</page><page sequence="23">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 263 belongs with 31:18 [no writer could betray such a lack of sympathy with the serious subject in hand, as to stop for so passing a remark concerning Tablets, which play, at best, but a subordinate part in the story]; (f) it is difficult to con- ceive of a more abrupt transition, in the same paragraph, than is presented by 33:7 [the article in big clearly points back to something mentioned imme- diately before; but even remotely (ch. 26), we have only instructions for the erec- tion of the Tabernacle, while the actual erection of the building did not take place till some nine months later [cf. 19:1; 24:18b, and 40:17]; (g) 33:12 has no possible connection where it stands, but evidently refers back to 32:34-33:4 [note especially the participle "3 , as if Yahweh were just speaking]; (h) the answer in 33:14 does not meet the request of v. 13 [3~1'-nK N 'l;l]; while it is just what is needed to satisfy 34:9a; (i) in like manner, 34:10-27 has no logical connection with what precedes [since it was not a covenant the people wanted: this they had (if the previous material is from the same pen); but Moses prays for Yahweh's favor to be restored], but fits admirably before 24:3 [cf. especially 34:27 with 24:4a and 7a]. Remark.-After the foregoing array of facts, the question may well be asked, How could R (whoever he was) have done such work ? It can only be said that (1) the facts are here; and whether they are best charged to the original writer, or to a later editor, is for the reader to judge; (2) R's task was a difficult one, and the wonder is not that he left some traces of his work, but that many ages, even though uncritical, have failed to discover them. 6.

SYNOPSIS. [" The 'Tabernacle' is elaborately constructed by Bezalel and Oholiab, and is erected for use on the first day of the second year. Yahweh's glory fills the 'Tabernacle,' and there Moses receives the Levitical code. Aaron and his four sons are installed as priests, but Nadab and Abihu offer incense with unconse- crated fire, and a fire from Yahweh consumes them. A month later, a minute census of the twelve tribes (Levi being excluded) is taken, and the nation is divided into four divisions, which are to have their quarters on the four sides of the Tabernacle, both when in camp and when on the march. The Levites also are numbered, and organized as a body-guard around the holy place. Twenty days later, they leave Sinai, and the organized 'hosts' move further in the wilder- ness.*] By Yahweh's command, twelve men, one from each tribe, are sent to spy out Canaan. They return, after forty days, with an unfavorable report. The people grumble against Moses and Aaron. Two of the spies, however, stand by Moses and Aaron, and stoutly maintain that the country is 'exceedingly good.' The people wish to stone them; but Yahweh interferes, and decrees that none of that rebellious people (from the age of twenty and upwards) shall enter the prom- ised land : they are to die slowly within the next forty years, which they are to spend in the wilderness (a year for each day spent by the twelve). The spies, except Joshua and Caleb, die on the spot. Now, Korah, with a band of 250 prom- inent men of the congregation, disputes the supremacy of Moses and Aaron over the laity. Moses suggests to them to test the matter by offering up incense (a priestly prerogative) next morning, when Yahweh will manifest his choice. At Korah's instigation, the entire nation is present next morning at the Tabernacle. Yahweh wishes to destroy all, but Moses and Aaron interceding, the punishment is limited to the 250, who are consumed by a fire from Yahweh, [Eleazar, Aaron's eldest son, is ordered to make plates from the censers of the rebels, and cover with them the altar, as a warning against Korah's examplet]. Next morning a reaction takes place: the people charge Moses and Aaron with having killed the 'godly people.' Again would Yahweh destroy them all; but Aaron, at Moses' sugges- tion, hurries into the camp with a pan of holy incense, and by this atonement stays the plague which has already devoured 14,700 people. In order to settle all * This matter in brackets, is a brief summary of P's historical connecting links scattered all through Ex. 35:I-Num. 10:28, where P's narrative is again interwoven in the prophetic material. t This is assigned to Pa.</page><page sequence="25">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 265 doubts as to Aaron's divine right to the high-priesthood, Yahweh orders the chief of each tribe to deposit a staff in the Tabernacle, Aaron being the represent- ative of Levi's tribe. Next morning, as Moses enters the Tabernacle, he finds that Aaron's staff had blossomed and produced ripe almonds. This staff is pre- served as a warning for future rebels.

STYLE OF P. It is marked by 1) Precision and exactness: (1) the "land of Canaan" is further described as that "which Yahweh gives to the children of Israel" (13:2); (2) the names and patronymics of the spies are given (13:4-15); (3) "they spied out the land 'from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob to the entering in of Hamath'" (13:21); (4) the "tent of meeting "' is more fully designated by the phrase, "Where I meet with you" (17:19). 2) Repetition and verboseness: (1) 13:3b is unnecessary after 2b; (2) 13:16a is an expanded repetition of 4a; (3) 13:17a is not needed after 3a; (4) 13:26a is a verbose expansion of 25a; (5) . fl....

(containing thirty-two words); (13) the last three words of 17:26 add nothing to the thought. 3) Numbers and dates: (1) The spies return, at the end of forty days (13:25); (2) Korah's party has 250 prominent adherents (16:2); (3) in the plague, 14,700 die (17:14); (4) not satisfied with telling us that each tribe is to furnish a staff, P characteristically sums up, every time he mentions the fact, that there were twelve staffs (17:17,21).</page><page sequence="26">266 HEBRAICA. 4) Stereotyped phrases: (1) ~ K . ... . 75 t * (13:1; 14:26; 16:20,23; 17:1,9,16); (2) 9"' fitp (13:26; 14:5,7; 17:6); (3) at every trouble, "Moses falls on his face" (14:5; 16:4,22; 17:10). 5. MATERIAL. We note 1) Duplicates: Both tell (1) of the salient points touched by the spies (P 13:21; JE 13:22sq.);t (2) of Caleb's bringing a good report, and supporting Moses (E = 13:30; P = 14:6 sq.); (3) of Yahweh's oath (E = 14:23 sq.; P = 14: 35); (4) of the forty years to be spent in the wilderness (J = 14:33; P = 14:34); (5) of Moses treating with those who oppose his authority (P = 16:3-7; J - 16: 12-15); (6) of a signal punishment coming from Yahweh upon the rebels (J = 16: 30,32a,33; P -= 16:35). 2) Differences: (1) According to P, the extent of the spies' topr is emphasized (13:21) [this is in full accord with the writer's cold, matter-of-fact history]; but the prophets mention only those points which were the basis of their unfavorable report (cf. 13:22sq. with vs. 27sq. and 32b sq.); (2) according to E, Caleb alone contradicts the bad report of the other spies (13:30); but according to P, Joshua is the principal supporter of Moses, and Caleb is mentioned only with Joshua (14:6 sq.); (3) consistently, in Yahweh's decree, Caleb only is excepted, in E's account (14:24); but P represents Joshua and Caleb as escaping the divine wrath (14:38) ;t (4) the forty years in the wilderness are, according to J, a punishment of the children, inevitably connected with the favor granted to the sinful genera- tion, not to perish immediately (14:33); but according to P, they are the punish- ment of the sinners: a drudgery of forty years in the desert, for the forty days spent by the spies (14:34); (5) according to P, Moses treats with Levites who aspire to priestly equality (16:5-7, especially 7b); but according to J, the party is made up of Israelites, dissatisfied with Moses' leadership (16:12-15); (6) consist- ently, the terrible death comes to the rebels, according to J, to establish Moses' divine mission (16:28-30); but according to P, to demonstrate the unfitness of the rebels for priestly service (16:6sq.,18,35); (7) consistently again, the death, according to J, is merely a strange phenomenon, showing Yahweh's direct inter- ference and his displeasure (16:30); but according to P, it is directly connected with the presumptuous attempt at sacrifice (16:35) [cf. Lev. 10:1 sq.]. 3) Incongruities: (1)J makes the ark of Yahweh's covenant go before the * Here, as well as in other points of diction and style, ch. 15, though very rich in P's charac- teristics, is omitted. t That vs. 22 sq. are not a mere expansion of v. 21, is seen from the fact that v. 22 begins anew with ~179' . Cf. also Differences: (1) below. $ It is interesting to notice that J, having both names, mentions Caleb first (14:30); and thus R found it easier to combine P with J (both of whom agree at least in mentioning both men) rather than with E [cf. 14:6-9 (where 8 sq. are attached to P's account), and 14:26-38 (where J's part, vs. 28,30-33, are interlaced in P's material)].</page><page sequence="27">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 267 people (at a distance of three days ahead of the camp, 10:33b); but cf. P, Num. 2:17; 10:13-17; (2) 12:16 contradicts 10:12 (in fact, 10:33; 11:3,35 also refute the idea of one station between Sinai and Paran); (3) 14:29 would naturally come after v. 35; here it has no connection; (4) if the leaders of the rebellion against Moses were Korah and Dathan and Abiram, then these latter are included in Inty of 16:5 and 6; but v. 7b is decidedly against this, if only one man was a Levite; (5) also Moses' sending for Dathan and Abiram (v. 12) is very strange, after the satisfactory arrangement of vs. 5-7; (6) the greatest difficulties, how- ever, are found in 16:23-35; (a) in v. 24, the order comes for the people to depart "from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan and Abiram;" but Moses goes only to the last two, "and tells the people to turn away from the tents of these wicked men " (vs. 25 sq.); (b) in 27a, again all three are mentioned; but in 27b, Korah is omitted again; (c) the sentence pronounced in vs. 28-30, naturally refers only to Dathan and Abiram [cf. 27b]; but in 32b Korah reappears again [in such a way, however, as clearly to show that even 32a does not refer to him*]; (d) vs. 32-34 surely give the impression that the whole trouble was over: everything pertaining to the rebels was swallowed up in the earth; but v. 35 remarks, passingly as it were, that a "fire consumed the 250 men that offered the incense." [In fact, the 250 men are entirely lost sight of in this section, until we reach the last verse.] 4) Conclusion: All the preceding facts show not only (1) that R has combined various documents, but also (2) that he has occasionally inserted harmonizing glosses and verses. 6. THEOLOGY OF P. 1) He lays so much stress on the fact of Yahweh's indorsement of Aaron's sole claim to the priesthood, that (1) more than two-thirds of his material is given to it (chs. 16 sq.); (2) four distinct events are related, all bearing on this point: (a) Korah's company is destroyed by fire (ch, 16); (b) the remains of their censers are spread on the altar (17:1-5 = P3); (c) a plague destroys many of Korah's sym- pathizers (17:6-15); (d) Aaron's blooming staff finally settles the matter (17:16-26). [That all these have their desired effect is shown in 17:26 sq.]. 2) Yahweh's punishments are direct: (1) The evil spies are stricken down "before Yahweh "' (14:27); (2) a fire "from Yahweh" consumes the 250 men (16:35); (3) the plague among the people is "the wrath gone out from before Yahweh" (17:l11b). 3) The main activity of Yahweh, especially the theophanies, are at the Tabernacle: (1) Yahweh's appearances are invariably in or near the TI3 ig (14:10; 16:19; 17:7); (2) Korah's party comes there to learn of Yahweh's choice (16:18sq.); (3) the miracle of the transformation of Aaron's staff occurs in the n'Wf, ,nK (17:19,22sq.,25). * For if Dfln'n-nKn tn includes Korah and all his possessions, then 32b is wholly mean- ingless.</page><page sequence="28">268 HEBRAICA, 4) Atonement for the nation's sin is effected (1) by Aaron; (2) by burning incense; (3) with fire obtained from the altar (17:11; cf.

Moses is displeased, and complains to Yahweh that he can no longer endure alone the nation's burden. Yahweh orders him to appoint seventy elders, who shall assist him; and he also promises meat,' with a vengeance' 'for a whole month they shall get nothing but meat, till it be loath- some to them.' Moses wonders where so much meat is to come from; but Yahweh only re-affirms his promise. In the meantime the seventy are chosen; and as they all receive a part of Moses' prophetic spirit, two of them remain in the camp 'prophesying.' Joshua considers it a usurpation of his master's office; but Moses serenely replies, ' Would that all the people were prophets.' But the claim of Aaron and Miriam to be equals of Moses, is severely rebuked by Yahweh, who testifies to a closer intimacy with Moses than with any other prophet.... . * Cf.

MATERIAL. [Cf. under E, where both prophets are compared.] 6. THEOLOGY OF J AND E. 1) Yahweh is near to man: (1) His presence proceeds before his people to find a suitable stopping place (10:33b); (2) Moses is intimate with him, if not his equal (11:11-15; 11:21sq.; 12:7sq.). 2) There is an element of vengeance, almost of spite, in Yahweh's punish- ment: meat will be furnished, till it become loathsome (11:18-20); (2) even when the people repent, he does not revoke his sentence (14:39-42). 3) Yahweh desires to display his power; hence the enormous quantity of meat (11:21-23). 4) Yahweh's spirit is something transferable from one person to another (11: 17,25). 5) Yahweh is anthropomorphically conceived: (1) the usual phrase, "And his anger was kindled," occurs many times (11:1b,10b,33b; 12:9); (2) as usual, he "comes down" to install the elders (11:17,25). 6) Yahweh uses natural means: (1) a wind brings the quails (11:31); (2) the rebels are swallowed up by the earth (i. e., an earthquake (?)

[See under J, pp. 268,269.] 5. MATERIAL. Both J and E are here considered :- 1) Remarks: (1) While P is quite distinct from the prophetic material (as shown above), the line between J and E, in this section, can be drawn with diffi- culty; (2) the reason for this is obvious: in P, besides the legal and priestly pur- pose, running all through his narrative, we have also his peculiar vocabulary, style and theological conceptions to guide us; whereas, the prophets present but few such distinctions; (3) the name of the Deity, quite decisive by itself in pre- vious material, is here ;tl7 all through; (4) we are, therefore, left entirely to internal evidence: could the narrative, as it stands, emanate from one source ? 2) Duplicates: (1) 10:29-32 resembles in many respects E's story in Ex. 18; in both (a) Moses meets a near relative of his wife;$ (b) he relates to him the con- dition and prospect of the nation; (c) something is said about taking advice from * Nowhere else in Hexateuch. t "AiraF 2ey6Fevov. , In fact, some would make Hobab Moses' father-in-law, a different name being used by E; of.

[cf. under P, "material," 2) (3) and note, p. 266]. 4) Incongruities: (1) Some of the differences, especially (2) (b) and (3), amount to inconsistencies; (2) no author would begin the story of the cry for meat, fraught as it was with such disastrous and important effects, as a mere appendix to a passing notice of Taberah [11:4 joined to 1-3]; (3) much less would an author (and surely not Moses, who in writing it must have lived through all the horrors of the event once more) digress to describe the beauties of the manna (11:7-9) at such a critical point; (4) 12:5, if omitted, leaves the narrative con- sistent and natural; but it sounds decidedly strange that Yahweh should speak with Moses, Aaron and Miriam (12:4), and then "come down" (12:5), and then tell them what he wants (12:6) [Where was he when he first spoke ? If he could say anything without descending, why not say all that he has to say ?]; (5) how does the fact that Moses is in direct communion with Yahweh justify his improper (?) marriage ? (12:7 sq., in connection with v. 1); (6) could Moses have been "the meekest of all men,"' if he wrote 12:3 ? 6. THEOLOGY.

SYNOPSIS. "The Israelites arrive in the first month at the desert of Zin, where they find no water, and so they complain to Moses and Aaron. Yahweh tells Moses that he and Aaron shall speak to the rock, before the congregation, and it shall yield water. [But Moses expresses his doubt about it in the hearing of the congrega- tion,t] and Yahweh decrees that because of their lack of faith, and their failure to glorify him before the people, they shall not bring the people into the promised land. Arriving at Mt. Hor, Aaron dies-as decreed-and Eleazar succeeds him as high priest. The people mourn over Aaron thirty days. Their next station is Oboth, whence they move to Iye-Abarim, and finally they encamp in the plains of Moab, on this side of the Jordan. HIere a man publicly commits adultery with a Midianitish woman. Pinehas seizes a dagger and stabs both of them on the spot, and thus the plague, which had already destroyed 24,000 people, is stopped. The man was Zimri, a prince of the tribe of Simeon; the woman was Cozbi, the daughter of a prominent chief in Midian." [This led to a war with Midian, whence much booty was obtained, half of which was given to the high priest.]S Then follows a census by tribes of all males above twenty years of age, the total number being 601,730.

Not a man of those who came out of Egypt lived to see this census. They all died in the wilderness, except Caleb and Joshua. The census being of males exclusively, the family of Zelophehad, in which there were no sons was omitted. Hence the daughters put in a claim for a homestead. They plead their cause well, and Moses lays the matter before Yahweh, who decides that they should receive their father's share of land, and establishes this as a precedent for future emergencies: whenever the head of a family dies without male descendents, his estate is to go to his daughters, or to any relative living." 3.

MATERIAL OF P. 1) Remarks : (1) There are only two narratives in P's material, which find parallels in the prophetic stories: (a) the waters of Meribah (20:1-13); (b) Israel's adultery with heathen women, and its penalty (25:1-15); (2) the first of these, although interpolated here with a prophetic version,* is really a duplicate of Ex. 17:2-7; (3) by far the greater part of P's material is peculiar to himself: (a) Aaron's death and Eleazar's succession (20:22-29), especially when taken in con- nection with the prominence given to Pinehas (25:7 sq.), establishes the priestly heredity during Moses' life-time; (b) the census (ch. 26) settles the theocratic division of the promised land, and becomes necessary after the first census (ch. 1), since it is of a new generation (26:64 sq.f) ; (c) the story of Zelophehad's daugh- ters (27:1-5) is clearly introduced only for the sake of the law (27:6-11) for which it serves as a precedent; (4) we may now examine more carefully the two brief statements that are similar to the prophetic accounts, in the usual way. 2) Duplicates : (1) In the story of Meribah, P's account is like that of E in the following essential features: (a) the people lack water (E = Ex. 17:3a; P = Num. 20:2a); (b) they complain against Moses (E = Ex. 17:3; P - Num. 20:2b,3b); (c) Moses prays (E = Ex. 17:4; P = Num. 20:6); (d) God tells him to obtain water from a rock (E = Ex. 17:5,6a; P = Num. 20:8a); (e) the miracle is performed openly (E- Ex. 17:6b; P = Num. 20:10a); (2) in the account of Israel's adultery, we have the following points in common: (a) it takes place on the borders of Moab (P = 22:1; J = 21:20); (b) the sin is intercourse with heathen women (J = * The main points of similarity between the two accounts are as follows: (a) the order of the tribes (both conforming to the division of ch. 2); (b) both are of males above twenty years of age; (c) from both the Levites are excluded; (d) the aggregate number is very nearly the same (cf. 1:46 with 26:51); (e) in both the tribal numbers as well as the total number are never given in units, and except in two cases (out of twenty-four) are given only in hun- dreds (cf. 1:25; 26:7, as the only exceptions). [The last two points cast considerable doubt on the historicity of these numbers]. ?

Num. 33:36b-38, especially 38b]); (b) in lP's story Aaron is, of course, associated with Moses all through the affair (Num. 20:2b,6a,8a,10a,12a); the prophets invariably speak only of Moses (J = Ex. 17:2; E = Ex. 17:3,4,5,6b; Num. 20:3a,7,9,10b ('7t') in the singular), 11); (c) E, as usual, produces the water by means of Moses' staff (Ex. 17:5b,6; Num. 20:8a,9a,11a); but according to P, Yahweh instructs them to speak to the rock (Num. 20:8a); (d) according to E, Moses does as commanded (Ex. 17:6b; Num. 20:9); according to P, they draw Yahweh's displeasure upon themselves by their action (Num. 20:12,24b; cf. also Deut. 32:51); (e) according to J, the place was called Meribah (Ex. 17:7); while with P, Meribah is not a proper but a com- mon noun (Num. 20:13; cf. particularly Num. 27:14; Deut. 32:51, where the expression "the water of the strife at Kadesh" is used); (2) the account of heathen adultery presents the following variations: (a) according to J, the sin is very prevalent (25:lb); according to P, only one leader commits it, while the congregation deplores it (25:6, especially 6b); (b) according to J, Moses appeases Yahweh's anger (25:4); according to P, Pinehas (25:7 sq., especially 8b; also v. 11); (c) only P knows of a plague among the people (25i:8b,9,19); (d) according to J, the women are Moabites (25:1b); according to Pi, a Midianite (25:6a,14a,15) [cf. also 31:2a,3b,7,8a]. 4) Incongruities: (1) Many of the differences enumerated above are really inconsistent one with the other (note particularly (a) and (di) under (1), and (a) and (d) under (2)); (2) the notice of Miriam's death (20:lb) has no point or connection in the story; (3) it is very strange that Yahweh addresses only Moses (20:7), when Aaron also was there (v. 6), and was also to accompany Moses to the rock (8a,10a);t (4) no writer would leave the sin of Moses and Aaron, which was so grievously punished, in such obscurity; (5) why should Yahweh tell Moses to take his staff along, if he wished him only to talk to the rock (20:8a)? (6) if Moses smote the rock, contrary to Yahweh's orders, why did it yield water at all ? (7) no original author would have placed 25:14 sq. after 13, but better after v. 6; (8) if Moses executed all the chief men of the nation (25:4a), how did it happen that Zimri (cf. v. 14b) was left (v. 6) ? * This is the only point in which P's account resembles that of E. It is interesting to note that in the matter of the punishment, P has to a certain degree combined the two prophetic statements. t It is equally noticeable that while the fl1 attack Moses and Aaron (v. 2b); the Dy quar- rel only with Moses (v. 3a).</page><page sequence="39">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 279 5. THEOLOGY OF P. Note the following points : 1) The "Tent of Meeting "' is (1) the regular place of resort, in trouble, for Moses and Aaron (20:6); (2) the regular place of Yahweh's revelation, when theocratic troubles are to be settled (ibid.). 2) Yahweh appears (1) only on rare occasions, as to quell an incipient insur- rection (20:6) [the routine affairs are managed by formal commands; cf. 26:1,52; 27:6]; (2) even on these occasions it is only his glory that appears: the Deity is thus kept from direct contact with man. 3) The High Priest is (1) invariably associated with Moses, whenever an important matter of administration comes up (20:2b,6a,8a ,10a,23; 26:1; 27:2a); (2) appointed to office, not only by the right of heredity, but by a direct order of Yahweh (20:23-28); (3) installed in office by receiving the special regalia, the official robes, from the preceding high priest (20:26,28). 4) It is a priest who is (1) zealous for Yahweh and his law (25:7,11); (2) instrumental in appeasing Yahweh's wrath against Israel (25:8b,11).

So Moab, very much alarmed, sends for Balaam, a prophet, to come and curse the people. Balaam answers that even for a house full of gold, he cannot disobey Yahweh. Nevertheless he saddles his ass for the journey, which displeases Yahweh,* and his angel stands on the way to hinder his pas- sage. The ass, seeing the angel with his sword drawn, turns aside into the field. Balaam, in his blindness, strikes the clairvoyant animal, and urges her back to the road. Then Yahweh's angel places himself in a hollow betwden two fences. The ass perceiving him, presses to the wall, squeezing Balaam's leg, who strikes her again. The angel then takes his position in a narrow path, where there is no room to turn, and the ass cowers down. This so exasperates Balaam that he beats her with a stick. Now Yahweh 'opens the mouth of the ass,' and she remonstrates with her master for maltreating her. And then the scales are removed from his eyes, and B3alaam is informed that the angel was the cause of the animal's fright. IIe falls to the ground, and is ready to return home, if the angel so desires. But the latter permits him to proceed, provided he be careful to utter only what Yahwelh shall order him. When Balaam comes in sight of Israel's camp, the divine influencet prompts him to prophecy nothing but blessing for Israel. Balak, disgusted with his conduct, orders him home. Before depart- ing, Balaam predicts the final conquest of Moab and Edom by Israel. But the people begin to commit adultery with Moab's daughters, which leads to idolatry with Moab's gods. So Yahweh commands the leaders to be hung, that his wrath may be appeased." 3. LANGUAGE OF J. 1) OLD WORDS. (1) 08pi (20:20; 22:34; 24:1). (2) ,'3Trl ' (20:20).

STYLE OF J AND E. It is characterized by 1) Anecdotes and stories: (1) Miriam's death (20:lb);$ (2) Israel's message to Edom (20:14-21);t (3) successful encounter with the King of Arad (21:1-3); (4) the brazen serpent (21:4-9) ;t (5) negotiations and battle with Sihon (21:21-31) ; (6) Balak and Balaam (22:2-21);i (7) the ass and the angel (22:22-35); (8) Balaamr's blessings (23:1-24:19);( (9) idolatry at Moab (25:1-5). 2) Poetic passages: (1) The Song of the Well (21:17b,18a);t (2) the minstrels' celebration of the Amorite's victory over Moab (21:27-30); (3) the prophecies of Balaam (23:7-10,18-24; 24:3-9,15-19). 3) Variety of expression: (1) While Israel's repeated complaint is always the same in substance, "Why have ye brought us out from Egypt into this desert, etc.," yet it is always couched in different phrases (cf., e. g., 20:4sq. with 21:5, both of which are E; cf. also J, 11:5 sq., which is again different); (2) Israel's messages to foreign powers, asking permission to pass through their territory, though necessarily the same in thought, have yet some verbal variations (cf. 20: 17 with 21:22);$ (3) Balak's second message, and Balaam's reply to it, differ from the first (cf. 22:6-8t with 22:17b-19 ); (4) the three appearances of the angel are differently and climactically presented (22:22-27); (5) the preparations for, and the results of, Balaam's two prophecies, according to E, though identical, are very differently worded (cf. 21:41-22:7a with 22:13-18; and 22:11 sq. with 22:25 sq.) 4) Puns: (1) 7 because (t")1 (21:3); (2) "thence to 1" , that is the well " (21:16t). 5) Archceological and geographical allusions: (1)" Arnon is the boundary of Moab, etc." (21:13b$); (2) "the book of the wars of Yahweh "' [probably an ancient chronicle, from which, perhaps, our writers received considerable material, * Nowhere else in Hexateuch.

(22:30a); (f) it is hardly necessary to call attention to the many similes and metaphors in the purely poetic passages in chs. 23sq.; (4) vivid particularization: (a) "to bring us to this evil place; it is no place of seed, or figs, or vines, or pomegranates " (20:5b*); (b) "we will not pass through field or vineyard, neither will we drink of the water of the well" (20: 17a*; 21:22a*); (5) the time of the day is noticed: (a) Balaam rises in the morning (22:13-21"); (b) God comes to him in the night (22:20*); (c) in the morning, Balak takes him to Bamoth-baal (22:41"); (6) emphatic infinitives and cognate accusa- tives: (a) * g.. .... 9 (21:1b); (b) O"O. ....'l9 (21:2a); (c) rIrP tJ1 (21:2b); (d) .~3"~K 7"" (22:17a; 24:11b); (e) iff.DD .D, (22:30a); T(f) 0 p fliby (22:37a*); (g) ''1)3 ftt (23:11b*; 24:10b); (h) L74K 5#3 (22:38a*)T; (i) Ip" f....i~ ('2:25a*); (j) u]D'!f .... . (23:25b*). 5.

[Those references which have no mark are J.] t Accounts where J and E are interwoven.</page><page sequence="43">THE iENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 28S "If thou wilt deliver this people into my hands, then I will devote their cities" (21:2); (2) speaking against God is no more blasphemy than speaking against Moses: they are the same (21:5a,7a*) [cf. 12:10, where speaking against Moses exclusively is punished as severely]; (3) Balaam is indeed respectful, yet perfectly familiar (chs. 22 sq.): (a) he expects God to visit him any night ($2:8,19*); (b) he is not at all disconcerted when he discovers the presence of the angel. 2) God's revelations are as informal now as in the patriarchal period. (1) Though we find occasional references in the prophetic material to the "Tent of Meeting" and the "Ark of the Covenant" (as Ex. 33:7-9 [= E]; Num. 10:33b [= J]), yet God's communications are in no way particularly connected with these (20:7*; 21:7b sq.*; 25:4); (2) he not only comes to Balaam in dreams, but he also meets him in various places (22:9,20; 23:4,16*); (3) he evidently receives the sac- rifices of the latter wherever they are offered (23:1-5,14-16*). 3) An image of a serpent, as a symbol of God,t is made by Moses, under God's direction (21:8 sq.*). [This is somewhat akin to Jeroboam's bulls at Bethel, which were originally only symbols of Yahweh worship; and as such were toler- ated by the prophets who brought about the division of the kingdom.] 4) Revelation and prophecy are not limited to Israel: Balaam, a Gentile (Ammonite(?)), (1) has frequent communion with God (20:9-12*,20*,31-35; 23:5*, 16*; 24:4,16); (2) makes a contribution to Jewish prophecy, which forms the basis of the wonderful and beautiful prophecies we have to-day (23:7-10*,18-24*; 24: 3-9,15-19).

SYNOPSIS. "The people settle at Kadesh, where Miriam dies and is buried. They revive the old complaint: Why have they been taken from Egypt to that bare spot, where there is no grain, fruit or water ? Moses is directed to take the staff, and produce water from the rock. He does as he is bidden; while rebuking the people, he smites the rock twice, and an abundance of water comes forth.-Then Moses sends messengers to the king of Edom, telling him of Israel's experience in and out of Egypt, and asking permission for a quiet passage through his realm. Edom flatly refusing, they circumvene his land along the Red Sea, which makes the people very impatient, and again they murmur against God and Moses. Godt sends venomous serpents, which kill many of them. At this they repent, and Moses intercedes for them. Godt tells him to make a fiery serpent of bronze, and to put it on a pole, so that those bitten may look at it and be healed. Moses com- plies, and the remedy is very effective. They then proceed to the valley of Zered, thence to Arnon, and finally to Beer, where water is given them.-Then Israel sends messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, requesting a peaceful passage through his kingdom. He replies by meeting them with an army; but he is utterly defeated, and the conquerors take possession of his dominion. Balak, the Moabite, seeing what Israel has done to the Amorite, is greatly distressed. He tells [Balaam$]: a people has come out of Egypt, darkening the world, and now they are opposite me. Come, I beg of you, and curse them for me, perchance, I may smite them and drive them off. Balaam tells the messenger to stay over night, that he may get word from God.t God comes to him, and asks who the men are. Balaam, telling him their errand, is commanded not to go, nor to curse the people. So he dismisses the embassy. But Balak sends a larger and worthier delegation, [who are also invited$] to remain over night. This time God permits him to go, with the command that he shall do only what he shall tell him. Balak comes out to meet Balaam, and mildly upbraids him for his first refusal. Balaam replies, Even now that I am here, I am under God's absolute control. Balak makes a feast for Balaam and his suite, and next morning he takes him up to Bamoth-Baal to afford him a view of the enemy. Seven altars are erected, upon * Cf.

God meets him, and inspires him to utter a eulogy on Israel. Balak, disappointed, takes him to another place, and again builds seven altars and sacrifices upon them. But again only blessing upon Israel is the result. So Balaam returns home, and Balak likewise goes his way.-The Israelites now dwell in Shittim, and fall into idolatry. To appease God's anger, Moses orders the judges of Israel to execute the idolaters under their respective jurisdiction." 3. LANGUAGE. 1) OLD WORDS. (1) ,1K7 (20:14). (2) pY (20:16).

(b) the story of the messengers to Edom (20:14-21); [That it is from E, notwith- standing the ?) in 20:16, is attested (a) by the reference to God's angel (20:16); and (p) from the allusion in Jud. 11:17, which shows the Ephraimitic origin and currency of the tradition.]; (c) the incident of the "brazen serpent" (21:4-9), attested to be E's (a) by the words "to compass the land of Edom" (21:4a), a reference to 20:21; (P) by the presence of b')r in v. 5; (y) it is hardly proper for the strict Yahwist to tell such a story [cf. 2 Kgs. 18:3 sq., where it is enumer- ated among the virtues of Hezekiah that he destroyed it]; (2) from J alone comes the story of Hormah (21:1-3). 2) Duplicate accounts: (1) We have two presentations (beside that of P, 21: 10 sq.) of Israel's itinerary to Moab (21:13-15, and 18b-20); (2) 21:25 -- 31 equal, in thought, 21:24b; (3) 22::3b = 3a; (4) 22:35b = 21; (5) there are also two distinct presentations of God's attitude towards Balaam's going to Balak (which, however, will best appear under the following heads of Differences, etc.); (6) the final per- mission, however, is identical in both writers (20:20b, and 35aW); (7) the two sets of Balaam's prophecies will also appear clearly further on; (8) 25:3a is but another statement of v. 2. 3) Differences in the double stories: (1) according to E, Israel reaches Moab's boundary after Nahal-Zered (21:12sq); according to J, after Bamoth (21:21); (2) according to J, Moab makes an ally of Midian* (22:4,7); but in the transactions of Balaam with the envoys, not a word is said about Midianites (22:8b,10 [in con- nection with 9b],13a,14a,21b); (3) we may also note that J speaks of the elders of Moab (22:7a); while E invariably refers to the princes of Moab (22:8b,13a,14a, 15b,21b); (4) according to E, God gives his permission during his meeting with Balaam in the night (22:20); according to J, Yahweh's angel, after repeatedly vexing Balaam, next day allows him to go (22:22-35); (5) the prophetic spirit comes upon Balaam, according to E, by retirement on his part when he meets God (23:3b,4a, and 15b,16a); according to J, it comes spontaneously (24:2b,3a, and 14b,15a); (6) E's introduction to each prophecy differs according to the occasion and thought of the prophecy (cf. 23:7b sq., with 18b-20); but J has an elaborate formula in both which is quite similar (cf. 24:3bsq., with 15bsq.); (7) with J, idolatry is the result of adultery (25:lb sq.); E says nothing about adultery, except as it is implied in the worship of Peor(?) [cf. llosea 9:8b(?)] (25:3); (8) the penalty for this sin, is, according to J, the execution of the leaders by Moses (25:4); accord- ing to E, the killing of the sinners by the leaders (95:5). 4) Incongruities: (1) 21:18b has not only no grammatical or logical connection with what precedes, but is also contradictory to the statement made in 16a: Israel is in Beer not in a desert, concerning which some parenthetical remarks are made, * This point is only according to Dill.; other critics, as Well. and Kuen., consider the words 17p! sq?? an interpolation to suit P's material in 25:6sqq.</page><page sequence="47">THE PENTATEUCOHAL QUESTION. 287 and we should expect the author to begin "rVf , etc.; (2) how many times, and by what route, did Israel come to Moab ? (cf. 21:11, with 12b sq., and 20); (3) 22:4b sounds very strange, after all that has been said in vs. 2-4a: the two words fi)~ after 2a would have been very easy and natural; (4) it is impossible to find anything in Balaam's conduct, as reported in 22:8-21, that would justify God in being angry with him (v. 22a); it is especially contradictory to the presentation in v. 20, where God gives him full permission to go; (5) in fact, we cannot see that there was anything whatever gained by the repeated interferences of the angel, and the extraordinary transformation of the ass into a personal being, since v. 35 is practically identical in its instructions with v. 20; (6) 24:1 speaks of Balaam's customary use of enchantments; but according to 23:4a,5a, and 16, he used none in his prophecies recorded in ch. 23, and the force of the remark is entirely lost, and is surely out of place at this stage of the proceedings. We must, then, find an entirely new account in ch. 24; (7) this difficulty is greatly enhanced by 23:29 sq.: if Balaam has decided to prophesy extemporaneously, why should he instruct Balak to build the altars and offer sacrifices, just as before ? (8) but, furthermore, how could he use itff , when he praises Jacob for e'flj-g (23:23) ? (9) if special communion with God (23:3b,4a; 15b,16a) was necessary for the utterance of the first two prophecies (23:9 sq., and 21-24), surely the last one (24:17-19) needed it, since it is iMessianic (in the broad sense, at least); (10) if Yahweh ordered Moses to hang the leaders of the people (25:4), why should he [= Moses] instruct the judges to kill the people (25:5)'? 5) DificulTties in the way of the analysis: (1) the unsatisfactory use of the names of the Deity; (a) Yahweh is the prevailing name (if"! occurring but nine times in the entire section); this is, however, more easily explained on the R- hypothesis than by any other; (b) Elohim occurs twice (22:22; 24:2) in J's mate- rial; but this has already been explained [cf. foot-notes on p. 280] ; (2) there are a few omissions which must be supplied in one document from another; but, as the "synopses " show, these are as unimportant as they are few. 6.

SYNOPSIS. "Moses is bidden to take a farewell look at the promised land, which, like Aaron, he is not to enter, because of the transgression at Kadesh. Moses then prays for a successor; and Joshua is appointed, with 'laying on of hands,' in the presence of Eleazar and the whole congregation, to take charge of affairs.-Now, the Reubenites and the Gadites had much cattle; they desire, therefore, the land already conquered as their share. Moses agrees to let them have it, on condition that they accompany their brethren across the Jordan, and assist them in conquer- ing their enemies. The contract is made in the hearing of Eleazar and Joshua, and accepted by Reuben and Gad. Moses also allots Gilead to Machir, son of Manasseh."--[Here comes an itinerary of the stations in the wilderness.]-" In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses delivered his final message to the people from Yahweh, and then ascended the mountain Nebo, and died there according to Yahweh's command, at the age of 120 years.

MATERIAL OF P. As compared with the prophetic material, we find 1) Duplicate accounts: (1) of the appointment of Joshua (P = Num. 27:18-25; E = Deut. 31:14 sq.); (2) of the land given to Reuben and Gad (both intermingled in Num. 32; their character will best appear under the following heads); (3) there are evidently two sets of regulations in Num. 33:52-56 (see below); (4) that there is more than one account of Moses' death in Deut. 34, will also be shown later on. 2) Similarities and differences: (1) While in both accounts, Joshua is appointed because of Moses' end being near (Num. 27:12-17 and Deut. 31:14a), P alone lays special stress on (a) the laying on of hands (Num. 27:18b,23a); (b) the presence of Eleazar the priest (ibid., 19a,22b); (c) the fact that Joshua is to depend for Yahweh's revelation on what Eleazar is to tell him by means of the Urim (ibid., 21); (2) according to all accounts, Reuben and Gad are to have their desired dis- trict only on condition that they aid their brethren across the Jordan; but accord- ing to P, (a) Moses demands it (Num. 32:20-22); (b) he leaves the contract with *6</page><page sequence="50">290 HEBRAICA. Eleazar, Joshua and the chiefs of the tribes (ibid., 28 sq.); while in E, they make the offer themselves (ibid., 16 sq.), and that settles it (see below); (3) it is charac- teristic of the prophet to warn the people against idolatry, when they conquer the land (Num. 33:52,55); but P simply emphasizes the division by lot (ibid., 54; cf. 26:52-56); (4) according to P', Moses died on a mountain (Deut. 34:5a [Dg~ refer- ring to '] " in v. la]); according to D, in a valley (Deut. 34:6a). 3) Incongruities: (1) If the entire Pentateuch be from one hand, it would be strange (a) that, after Joshua had been fully, legally and divinely appointed (Num. 27:18-23), the order should so soon* come again to call Joshua, etc. (Deut. 31:14sq.); (b) that Moses should have called Joshua before he were bidden, and should have given him the same instructions (Deut. 31:7sq. [= D2], which Yahweh gave afterwards (Deut. 31:23); (c) that the entire ceremony, including Moses' instructions, should take place in the presence of the whole congregation (Num. 27:19,22b; Deut. 31:7); while Iahweh's instructions, which would con- firm his divine appointment more than anything else, were given privately, only Moses being present (Deut. 31:14b,23); (2) Num. 32, while at first glance it seems consistent enough, shows some literary difficulties, when more closely examined: (a) vs. 2b-4 give us the words of the children of Reuben and Gad; why then should v. 5 (apparently a mere continuation of their petition) begin anew, "And they said," etc.?t (b) v. 16 also begins as if they come forward for the first time;$ (c) the greatest inconsistency, however, is that after they voluntarily offer to accompany Israel in their conquests (vs. 16-19), Moses should introduce it as a condition, and should talk so much about it (vs. 20-30); (d) v. 31, moreover, speaks explicitly of the condition as being the command of God, not the words of Gad and Reuben; (e) no author would introduce "the half of the tribe of Manas- seh " in v. 33a, so abruptly and inappropriately; (3) the instruction given in Num. 33:54 has no connection with what immediately precedes or follows (vs. 52 sq. and 55 sq.), while v. 55 is not only a natural, but necessary, sequence to vs. 52 sq.; (4) in the death of Moses, we find (a) that Deut. 32:50a emphasizes the fact that he is to die on the mountain (that in this respect also his death may be like Aaron's (50b)), and this would be the natural impression of Deut. 34:1-5; but v. Ga explicitly says that he was buried in the valley; (b) that Deut. 32:49a gives the description of the place very minutely; but 34:6b says that nobody knew his burial place; (5) who wrote Deut. 34 ? Surely not Moses (vs. 5-12 would decide against him); hardly Joshua (v. 9a would hardly be from him). It is the conservative critic who appeals in this casel to a "later hand," to a Redactor. But if R could write a * It will be remembered that the events in Num. 27 and Deut. 31 are very near each other chronologically (perhaps on the "very same day," Deut. 32:48), since the entire book of Deuter- onomy is supposed to be Moses' last words to Israel. The point made in the text is this: that a writer trying already to crowd so much into so short a time, would be least likely to make so many independent and disconnected references to Joshua's appointment. t The Massorites evidently felt it, and so made v. 5 begin a new paragraph. $ Note the paragraph here also. ?

(6) Deut. 33 breaks in on 32:52 and 34:1. 6. THEOLOGY OF P. But two points are to be noticed in this brief section: 1) Emphasis is laid on the ceremony of the laying on of hands in the appoint- ment of Joshua (Num. 27:18b,23a), and attributing his divine power to it (Deut. 34:9a). 2) The importance of the high priest is emphasized by (1) mentioning his pres- ence at important affairs, as (a) the installation of Joshua (Num. 27:19a,22b); (b) the negotiations with the Reubenites (Num. 32:2b,28*); (2) subordinating the prophet or judge to him (Num. 27:21a).

SYNOPSIS. " Moses discusses with the children of Reuben and Gad the advisability of their remaining this side of Jordan, reminding them that they must not discour- age the nation, as did the spies. But they promise to leave their families and flocks in Gilead, while they themselves will fight in Yahweh's battles. Also some of the tribe of Manasseh capture some cities in Gilead, and settle there. In con- nection with the prospective entrance into the promised land, some injunctions about the treatment of those nations are emphasized.-Moses being near death, Yahweh directs him to write a poem, and have the Israelites learn it, as a warning for future days, when they fall away from Yahweh, and, of course, suffer the consequent punishments. Moses complies, and the text of the Song is given. Then Yahweh points out to Moses from a distance the whole promised land from Gilead to Dan, reminding him that he is not to pass thither.' * Note also that Eleazar is here put before Joshua. t Cf.

The following remarks will suffice: 1) As this section is very brief, and as almost all of the prophetic material in it is taken up by the two long poems (Deut. 32 sq.), there is very little chance to illustrate their regular style. 2) But the very fact that their material is given in the form of poetry, is characteristic of the prophets. 3) To do justice to the beautiful diction, bold figures of speech, and splendid imagery of the poems, is beyond the scope of this article: no one can fail to find them. 4) But also in the prosaic fragments the prophetic stamp is unmistakable : (1) the elaborate, earnest appeal to past experience (Num. 32:6-15); (2) the strong warning against alliance with the gods and nations of Canaan (Num. 33:52 sq., 55 sq.*); (3) the prediction of "many evils and afflictions" as an inevitable result of sin (Deut. 31:16-21)-how all these remind us of Amos and Isaiah. 5. MATERIAL. The material of J will be considered in connection with that of E, pp. 294 sq. 6. THEOLOGY OF THE PROPHETS. 1) J evidently knows nothing of a t~'l1 which is to be a testimony [an f'T) to the people: Moses is to write a poem (Deut. 32) embodying (1) Yahweh's kindly dealings with Israel; (2) their rejection and neglect of him; (3) his severe but temporary punishment; (4) Israel's final restoration, because of Yahweh's jealousy for his honor; and this was "to be a witness for Yahweh against the children of Israel" (Deut. 31:19,21a). 2) Yahweh is very near to his people: (1) he is a father (Deut. 32:6b,18); (2) he tenderly cares for them (Deut. 33:11-14). 3) E refers indeed to Levi as those called to teach the people, and to offer up sacrifice (Deut. 33:8-10). But note (1) that it is the whole tribe to whom priestly</page><page sequence="53">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 293 offices are ascribed; (2) that the ground of his call is based solely on his special zeal shown at Israel's rebellion (v. 9; cf. Ex. 32:25-29); (3) that the teaching of God's precepts is the primary, while sacrifice is but the secondary function of the Levites. [A fuller discussion of the prophetic (including the Deuteronomic) view of the priesthood, belongs to the legal argument]. C. Element of E. 1. VERSES ASSIGNED.

[See under J, pp. 292 sq.] 5. MATERIAL. [J and E are here compared and contrasted :] 1) Single accounts, or material peculiar to one of the prophetic authors: (1) the warning against leaving any of the foreign nations or their gods in the land (Num. 33:52 sq., 55 sq.), harmonizes with J's material elsewhere [cf. Ex. 34:11-16]; (2) the order to write the Song of Warning (Deut. 31:16-22), and (3) the Song itself (Deut. 32:1-44), are in their present form and connection from J; as can be seen from (a) the uniform use of Yahweh (31:16; 82:3,6,9,12,19,27,30,36); (b) cer- tain historical references (vs. 21,30,35 sq., and vs. 40-42*); yet it has some charac- teristics of the Northern dialect,t which would make it a much older document ; (4) on the other hand, Moses' blessing (Deut. 33) is probably, in the main, from E, as will appear from (a) the word Oti) in v. 1; (b) Joseph receives the most attention of any of the other tribes (vs. 13-17); while Judah is but briefly dis- missed, with a prayer that God might "restore him to his nation" (v. 7) as if Judah was to blame for the division of the kingdom; (c) the strange arrangement of the tribes [cf. Gen. 29:32-30:24 +- 35:17 sq.; also Gen. 35:23-26a; 46:8-24; Ex. 1:2-4; Num. 1:5b-15; 20-42; 2:3-30; 7:12-78; 10:14-27; 13:4-15; 26:5-48; 34: 19-28; and especially Gen. 49:3-27t] would seem to indicate that the writer wished to dispose of the group of Judah, and then turn to the Ephraimitic union, with Joseph as leader. [Reuben is the only exception, but his birthright natur- ally entitles him to the priority which is accorded to him ]; (d) the references made to Levi (vs. 8b,9) are to E's material [cf. Ex. 17:3-6; 32:26-29]; also the words 0]0 .) in v. 16, refer to Ex. 3:2-4. 2) Double accounts: (1) the gift to the tribes of Gad and Reuben (Num. 32) presents the following duplicates (aside from P's account): (a) v. 16 is in thought equal to v. 5, and begins in such a way, as if entirely ignorant of the latter; (b) vs. 25-27 form not only an awkward repetition of vs. 16 sq., but 25b is a different presentation: instead of their offering to aid Israel (v. 17), Moses imposes it upon them; (2) Moses' death was probably recorded by all the writers; but in the present combined story (Deut. 34), the different(?) prophetic versions can be determined only in fragments. Thus v. 4a is evidently from J (the expression occurring verbatim in Ex. 33:1b; cf. also Gen. 13:15; 15:S18b; 26:3; 28:13), while v. 10 refers clearly to Ex. 33:11a, which is from E. * For the historical background of Deut. 32, of.

Ex. 33:7-11]; (c) v. 16 is decidedly out of connection with v. 15, and v. 23 is not only an awkward appen- dage to v. 22, but requires a change of subject (from Moses to Yahweh, as v. 28b shows); (4) that the prevailing name of the Deity is Yahweh, is probably due to R's influence; (5) Deut. 33:4 is not of a piece with what precedes or fol- lows; (6) the composition of Deut. 34 has already been dwelt upon sufficiently.* 6.
