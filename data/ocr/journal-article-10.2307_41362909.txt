Bailey, m.c., m.a., d.sc., f.r.s., Director of the Geological Survey and Museum. Lecture I. - Delivered February 21 st, 1944. During the Stone Age, which covers much the greater part of human occupation of our region, flint was the undisputed key mineral of the land. It played an essential role in war and chase, and in many aspects of the simple home life of the period. In one direction, it maintained its place long after metals came into common use : not till 1839 did our War Office abandon flint-locks. To-day, though no longer essential, flint remains useful, and figures to the extent of millions of tons per annum in tar macadam and concrete aggregate. The flint of southern and eastern England all originally grew as nodules in the chalk. The latter was deposited 100 millions of years ago upon the bottom of the sea, as an ooze containing the hard parts of many animals, mostly calcareous, but some siliceous. During a dry-land period, which separated the sub- mergence responsible for chalk formation from that which received our earliest Tertiary gravels, sands and muds percolating waters charged with carbon dioxide led to consider- able subterranean segregation of the mixed materials : here calcium carbonate was deposited and silica dissolved ; there, in reverse, calcium carbonate was dissolved and silica deposited. The general tendency was to destroy disseminated siliceous skeletons, such as sponge spicules, and build up aggre- gated siliceous nodules, the flint of to-day. The nice balance of give and take, which we thus note between dissolution and deposit, is characteristic of much of Nature's handiwork. In a limestone cavern, due to solution of calcium carbonate, there are always stalactites and stalagmites due to precipitation of calcium carbonate. Similarly, in a valley excavated by river erosion, there are always stretches of alluvium, an unmistakable product of river deposition. The spade that digs at one point throws down its load at another. I shall postpone consideration of copper and tin until I have dealt with iron and fuel, wliich together during the last 3,000 years have increasingly dominated the lives of humanity. Wood fuel, of course, has been employed for much more than 3,000 years. Even coal, the word is British, has left its cinders among Roman ruins excavated in Northumberland. As regards the natural history of coal, I accept, on the evidence of root-beds, that most of our British coal seams must be attri- buted to vegetation that grew on the sites now occupied by the coal itself. The alternative theory of drifted vegetation appeals to certain scientists, who mistrust any interpretation that is picturesque. Their anthropomorphic conception of Nature is of a being, picturesque in the present but prosaic in the past. The differences that distinguish layers of dulls and brights in an individual coal seam clearly depend on original differences of the semi-raw material, controlled either by plant characteristics or by accumulation conditions ; but most of us think that the differences which lead from mature peat through lignite, bituminous coal and steam coal to anthracite, aie essentially geological, in the sense that they have been determined by underground conditions, physical or chemical. This seems to follow, from the fact that the condition of plant beds always matches in rough and ready fashion the condition of other associated sediments. Moreover, there is Hilt's Law, according to which, in any particular vertical succession encountered in mining, deeper seams usually retain less of their original volatiles than shallower seams ; in other words, measurement has demonstrated that depth of burial is an important factor in developing anthracitization - of course indirectly. Prob- ably mountain -making movement in many cases acts independently in the same sense. South Wales presents an intriguing anthra- cite problem. Professor Hickling, a leading expert, favours application of the depth of cover theory with resultant differences of temperature. Basing on this general hy- pothesis and the available geological evidence, I offer three suggestions : (1) the main loss of volatiles may have occurred during the earth- movement responsible for the development of the South Wales coal basin ; (2) on the east and south sides of the basin the rocks may have been continually worn down by erosion about as fast as they were being ele- vated by earth-movement, because they were able to pass on their debris by what is now the upper estuary of the Severn into, and through, a great hollow of subsidence east of the Malverns ; (3) on the west and north sides of the basin the uplifted rocks may not have</page><page sequence="2">Sept. 15, 1944 THE NATURAL RESOURCES OF GREAT BRITAIN 539 been similarly eroded until a later date, but for the time being may have stood blanketed by detritus, delivered from the broad summit region of the adjacent Welsh mountain-land, which we know was undergoing a more or less simultaneous renewal of uplift. These three suggestions would account for the present day distribution of volatiles so far as revealed by Strahan and the Fuel Research Board : on the east and south sides of the basin, volatiles in any particular seam decrease very regularly as the seam in question is followed in mines from outcrop to depth ; whereas on the west and north sides of the basin volatiles decrease outwards towards the adjacent Welsh moun- tain-land, irrespective of present depth of cover. Also, it may be added, comparatively early erosion east and south of the basin has long been recognised by geologists, for in these directions Trias is found resting indis- criminately on any formation, from Coal Measures down to Silurian. The South Wales coalfield is an exposed coalfield. Its Coal Measures, bent by earth- movement into basin form, present to obser- vation the details of their upper surface cut aerose by erosion. Certain other British coalfields, such as those of Yorkshire and Durham, are semi-exposed. The Kent coal- field on the other hand is completely con- cealed. Here Coal Measures exist with an eroded upper surface deeply hidden under accumulations of later sediments. Since 1826, geologists have thought of possible discontinuous subterranean connec- tions linking the coalfields of South Wales and Somerset with those of northern France and Belgium. The conception received substance in 1846, when a bore for water in the Pas de Calais struck coal in depth. It is not sur- prising, therefore, to find the possibility of a Kent coalfield figuring largely in a presidential address to the Geological Society, delivered in 1855, by Godwin- Austin. The suggestion was combined with a good deal of unsound geological argument, and attracted a corres- pondingly mixed reception. However, from 1872 to 1875 a committee of the British Association sought the promised coalfield bv boring deeply at Battle. They penetrateci 1,100 feet of Cretaceous and Jurassic sedi- ments, and then gave up the chase as un- profitable. In 1884 Godwin- Austin died, unsatisfied. Two years later, Francis Brady, an engineer connected with the Channel Tunnel scheme, proposed a further explora- tory bore at Dover, which in 1890 matured and proved a coalfield, hidden far below the chalk of the White Cliffs of England, 1,107 feet beneath sea level. It is possible that other concealed coalfields may yet be found in England ; but boring for one purpose or another has already demonstrated their non- existence in many parts of the country. Usually, mineral exploitation has proceeded in stages from the outcrop to further and further depths underground. The present war has brought about a curious reversion to former practice. There are very incomplete records of outcrop working of coal in past centuries. Mining for long has tended to avoid the vicinity of outcrops, with their special problems of surface damage, risks of flooding and general uncertainty of extent. I myself thought that the " old men " had probably taken so much of what had been worthwhile that the industry had done wisely in considering outcrop coal as, broadly speaking, a vanished asset. Fortunately, however, a thorough investigation was made, and some districts have proved amazingly fruitful, especially in the Notts, Derby, Yorkshire field, where the " old men " have spared an unexpected proportion of near-outcrop c√≥al, and where the seams are inclined at so low and steady an angle that they make ideal subjects for opencast working with mechanical excavators. An excellent account has recently been published by Major-Gen. K. C. Appleyard, who took charge of operations for the Ministry of Works in the latter part of 1942. He has his own staff and employs boring and exca- vating contractors. He also receives assistance from officers of both the Geological Survey and Fuel Research in location of sites and in estimation of quality. Proof by boring inter- venes, and if all goes well production follows, production according to a carefully devised plan. In replacing the soil the Restoration Officer makes what amends he can for inter- ruption of agriculture ; and after the storm has passed a farmer sometimes admits that his fields have become more productive, and that awkward hills and hollows have been levelled out. I have even heard of a school that has gained a cricket pitch. The customer is reported as still a little doubtful of the coal that he receives ; but increased attention is being paid to quality and sizing. The weekly output is determined in part by daylight and , weather, factors that do not trouble miners underground. Thus, with most other cir- cumstances increasingly favourable, the weekly total of 160,000 tons, reached in July, 1943, fell to about 80,000 this last</page><page sequence="3">54¬∞ JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Sept. 15, I944 January. Corresponding figures for mined coal in July and January were 3,200,000 and 3,600,000 respectively. Appleyard looks forward to great advances in 1944 in " the biggest civil engineering job that has ever been done in the world," and adds : " the Panama Canal construction was quite small compared with what our contractors are going to undertake." We live in days when expense of output is reckoned in man-power rather than money. Opencast working of coal has a present value which one hopes will never recur after the available resources have been exhausted. A few more words about the main subject, underground coal and its working. Reserves in 1925 have been variously estimated as of the order of 135, or 175, thousand million tons. Output culminated in 1913 at 287 million tons. With the exception of agri- culture, to which it is a close second, the industry employs more men than any other ; in addition, it supplies the material or power that makes most of the others practicable on a large scale. British coal became the property of the nation in 1942. British oil had already been nationalised in 1934. I cannot, in this lecture, find space to enumerate results of research, which, since Watt designed a steam engine with separate condenser, have rendered coal more possible or more profitable to mine. I must, how- ever, point out that coal-mining may con- ceivably be exchanged before long for a very ¬´ different system of exploitation. Early sugges- tions from Sir William Siemens, 1868, and Prof. Mendeleef, 1888, were followed in due time by an after-luncheon speech delivered by Sir William Ramsay at an International Smoke Abatement Exhibition held in London, 19 1 2. " A boring," Ramsay said, " might be put down to the coal strata, the coal might be lighted where it was, and air and water might be passed down so as to produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The resultant gas might be used in gas engines at the pit mouth for the production of electricity which might be distributed by high tension currents to any desired point. That, ' ' he added , ' ' would settle the strike problem. "(*) Attracted by the press notices Lenin next year wrote to Pravda , as follows : - " The world -renowned English chemist, William Ramsay, has invented a means of getting gas direct from the seam of coal in situ." Lenin's words eventually led to researches, undertaken since 1931 in the * Cf. Times, 1912, March 25th, p. 3, and June 7th, p. 8. Soviet Union. A current, either of oxygen- ated air, or of steam, is sent down at one shaft, and after traversing a glowing gallery in coal is drawn up at another, transformed to fuel gas of regulated composition. The Russians believe that they have in view a time when, to quote again from Lenin : " under Socialism the application of Ramsay's method through liberating the labour of millions of miners . . . will permit the reducing of working hours for every one from eight hours to, say, seven or even less . . . will render conditions of work more hygienic, will relieve millions of workers of smoke, dust and dirt, will speed up the conversion of filthy abhorrent workshops into clean light laboratories worthy of man." Great Britain, so rich in coal, is poor in oil. British oil can be classified under two head- ings, shale oil and free oil. The shale oil industry of the Lothians of Scotland presents a wonderful picture of resourceful courage. The oil has to be distilled from shale, which itself requires mining. Fortunately, there is a good yield of ammonia, and ammonia fixed as ammonium sulphate is a valuable manure. The Scottish oil shales are of somewhat earlier date than the Coal Measures, and started their career as lagoonal or fresh water muds, rich in microscopic oil-bearing plants that are classed as algae. The free oil of England is particularly note- worthy for the high level of technical skill that has been directed towards its discovery. Underground structures, involving both per- meable and impermeable materials, have in many parts of the world furnished vast natural receptacles, so shaped as to trap and retain migratory oil. This substance, mobile and fugitive, tends to rise to the surface, floated out by water ; but imprisoned in suitable structures it may remain through geological ages, awaiting release by man with his boring equipment. In searching for promising structures much help can be got from ordinary geological observation and inference ; but on occasion geology must confess herself baffled, and hand over further inquiry to her younger sister, geophysics. very successful geophysical technique involves the stimulation of an artificial minor earthquake with the help of a charge of ex- plosive and the instrumental record of the results at a number of carefully-sited obser- vation posts. From the data thus acquired mathematical physicists disentangle the posi- tion and attitude of such subterranean reflecting or refracting surfaces as have guided the transmission of the earthquake</page><page sequence="4">Sept. 15, 1944 THE NATURAL RESOURCES OF GREAT BRITAIN 541 waves. Old-fashioned boring then takes up its task. Perhaps I should say new-fashioned boring, for processes are so perfected that depths are reached and speeds attained that would have been unthinkable not many years ago. Some recent bores in England have passed the 6,000 feet mark and have reached a speed of 500 to 1,000 feet a day. Such finds of oil as have been made in England have been richly deserved. As yet very little has been published on the subject. Across the border a strong gas well has been established in Mid -Lothian. I had the privilege of attending, with other members of the Geological Society of Edin- burgh, a trial blow at the Mid-Lothian well. The tap was turned ; the gas ignited ; flame leapt hundreds of feet into the air ; rushing noisily it stood there swaying in the wind, a landmark to which we turned our eyes again and again as we retraced our steps. Such a sight brings home vividly the potential mobility of fluids through permeable rock. The gas had been stored for ages in an ex- tensive permeable sandstone, sealed beneath a cover of equally extensive impermeable shale. It was now crowding out of the sand- stone into a narrow borehole that at last offered it chance of escape. Mineral oil and gas, like coal and the car- bonaceous material of oil shale, are organic in origin ; but unlike these two substances, they are completely disembodied. We obtain our stores from permeable rocks that have served as reservoirs, into which the mobile oil and gas migrated after generation by chemical processes elsewhere. The actual source- rocks are usually impermeable clays or shales, now darkened with immobile residue of plants and animals. Coals have not been important source-rocks, for most oil and gas are drawn from marine assemblages of strata, devoid of intercalated coal seams. Having devoted as much space as I dare to fuel, I now turn to iron, the second mineral resource of Britain, according to modern standards. Before the war the annual output of coal was 250,000,000 tons, and of iron ore 15,000,000 tons. For most of the period during which iron has been in use, its production and manipula- tion remained in the hands of craftsmen - a considerable body of men, to judge from the twenty Smith pages of the London telephone directory. Early small-scale methods of extraction gave wrought iron as the normal product ; or steel, with slight additional content of carbon. In the fourteenth cen- tury, larger, taller furnaces, by unintentional increase of carbon combination, delivered cast iron, characterised among other things by greatly-reduced melting point. Demand, however, continued so moderate that from the fourteenth to the seventeenth century the trivial ore field of Sussex was able to maintain the main smelting centre of England. Its advantages lay in proximity to the forests of the Weald and the markets of the capital, combined with gun-running facilities to the Continent. Cast iron, since its appearance, has generally been accepted as an indirect step in the passage from ore to wrought iron and steel. In 1856 Bessemer introduced his converter, lined with silica rocks (acid process), in which excess carbon is burned out with the help of hot blast. The resultant cheap steel led to development of new markets ; and this was accentuated in 1876, when Thomas and Gilchrist lined the converter with lime and magnesia (basic process), and by eliminating phosphorus made an additional set of ores available for mass -production of steel. Meanwhile, in the furnaces of our country, charcoal had been almost wholly replaced by coke or coal. The change is commonly supposed to have been started in Worcester- shire in 1 61 9. Once under way it led to gradual supersession of the ores of Sussex by others developed in the Carboniferous For- mation which furnished the coal employed as fuel. These Carboniferous ironstones are numerous and have yielded great quantities of iron. At the same time, they are individually thin and impersistent, so that they are seldom followed far underground, unless in close association with some mined coal. In the country as a whole, transfer from charcoal to coke was determined as much as anything by exhaustion of local wood. The history of the high-class haematite ores of Cumberland and Furness includes many interesting records of ore in pursuit of fuel, after local resources have failed. The quest led to establishment of charcoal furnaces in the West Highlands of Scotland, most notable among them the Lome Furnace, 1753 to 1876. This particular furnace ran in competition with coke furnaces in the Lowlands, for in 1759 the Carron Ironworks started, relying at first largely on Carboni- ferous ironstone mined at its doorstep. I have spoken of the acid and basic processes of steel production. They deal with low- phosphorus and high-phophorus ores, with a division set at –æ 02 per cent. P, on a basis</page><page sequence="5">542 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Sept. 1 5, 1 944 of 50 per cent. Fe. In our country this separation corresponds sufficiently closely with a more obvious distinction, for the low- phosphorus ores occur as veins or replace- ments, while the high-phosphorus ores are normal bedded sediments. The haematites of Cumberland and Fur- ness, north of Morecambe Bay, and of Llanharry and the Forest of Dean, in and near South Wales, are all of them veins or replacements. They are mostly located in specially susceptible beds of limestone of Carboniferous age. In such case they are certainly due to attack of the limestone, long ago, by iron-bearing solutions under oxidising conditions- haematite is the red oxide of iron, Fe208. Many people regard the iron-bearing solutions as the percolating rainwater of the day, modified through addition of iron picked up from rocks of the neighbourhood. This would make the haematite deposits, mutatis mutandis, more or less comparable with the flints in the chalk. There is another view, voiced especially by Dr. E. E. L. Dixon, who claims the solutions as of deep-seated origin, analogues in fact of others that have yielded iron carbonate veins to be discussed in the next paragraph. Mr. H. G. Dines has thrown out a suggestion in regard to difficult cases of this sort, where deposits have been assigned a meteoric origin largely because their arrangement suggests precipitation from downward -moving solutions. He points out that solutions supplied from a deep-seated source must be expected to spread laterally, and then descend if offered suitable oppor- tunity. In the northern Pennines and in Somerset, Devon and Cornwall, low-phosphorus iron ore occurs again as veins and replacements ; but here the ore was originally deposited as well crystallised siderite, FeCOj - though frequently weathered later to hydrated ferric oxide. Moreover, it is commonly associated with abundant sulphides of iron, lead and zinc, and also with fluorspar, barytes and quartz. It is universally interpreted as a low-tempera- ture penultimate crystallisation from solutions derived from deep-seated igneous rocks. It is interesting in these circumstances to find in the Pennines much the same sort of pre- ferential attack upon particular beds of lime- stone as characterises the replacement pheno- mena encountered in the haematite fields. In a recently studied area, three out of twenty recurrent limestones of the local Carboniferous succession have proved themselves specially susceptible. A vein, that measures only a few inches across in associated sandstones, may spread laterally as a " flat," for 100 feet, or even 1 ,000 feet, as soon as it enters a really hospitable bed of limestone. The low-phosphorus ores of Britain have passed their zenith as producers. The Cumberland and Furness haematites gave nearly 3,000,000 tons in 1882, but less than 1,000,000 in 1937. The ores of Devon and the south-west continue into depth, but easily- won material in sight has mostly been taken. On the other hand in the Pennines there has been a valuable war-time return of activity. The high-phosphorus iron ores of Britain, usually mined up to a limit of about 1 per cent. P305, are marine, lagoonal or lacustrine deposits. The most widespread ore-mineral is siderite. This sedimentary siderite differs from the vein siderite in being very finely crystalline. In the marine ironstones it is usually accompanied by abundant chamosite, 2S√åO2, A1208, 3FeO, aq., a variety of chlorite often in the form of ooliths. In the fresh water ironstones chamosite is very rare, and alumina is carried in ordinary clay minerals. Pyrites is fairly common in the bedded ironstones, and records of the sulphides of zinc and lead, though of insignificant amount, furnish a further link with the iron-carbonate veinstones. Delightful problems await solution, for we know next to nothing of precipitation of purely ferrous compounds in modern sediments ; except that ferrous sul- phide, under bacterial conditions, results from reduction by hydrocarbons of sulphates in presence of soluble iron salts. The fresh-water and lagoonal iron ores include the so-called clayband ironstones of the Carboniferous, and their successors, deposited 130,000,000 years later in the Wealden formation of Lower Cretaceous age in Sussex. Even the Carboniferous ores have fallen into comparative disuse. The output in Staffordshire, for instance, was 2,000,000 tons in 1882, and only 150,000 tons in 1937. The marine iron ores of Britain are mostly of Jurassic date, and are especially strongly developed in the Lias and, like the Lorraine ores of the Continent, in the Inferior Oolite. They constitute our main present source of iron. Mosdy they are won by opencast working along outcrops in the Midlands, if we may extend this term to reach north to the Humber. Both topography and dips are here sufficiently gentle to afford fine opportunities for mechanical excavation. The output of Jurassic ironstones reached 13,000,000 tons in 1937.</page><page sequence="6">Sept. 15, 1944 THE NATURAL RESOURCES OF GREAT BRITAIN 543 From bedded iron ores let us turn back again to vein-stones of deep-seated origin, especially well known in relation to ores of the non-ferrous metals, tin, copper, zinc and lead. The main ores here are : tin-stone or cassi- terite, Sn02 ; copper pyrites, CuFeS2 ; blende, ZnS ; and galena, PbS. Tin in Britain is restricted to Cornwall and Devon. Copper is more widely distributed. Most has been obtained from Cornwall and Devon, and from Parys Mountain, Anglesey, and Ecton Mine, Staffordshire. Britain contributed 50 per cent, of the world's copper output during the first half of the nineteenth century ; but to-day production is vestigial. Copper ores of moderate or small extent are found in several localities, additional to those mentioned above. They are, as a rule, associated with zinc and lead ores, which in most cases are strongly preponderant. Lo- calities that come to mind in connection with workable lead and zinc are Cornwall, Devon, Central Wales, North Wales, Shropshire, Lake District, Isle of Man, Pennines of Derbyshire, Yorkshire, Durham, Northum- berland and Cumberland, and the Leadhills of southern Scotland. I offer a few representative figures taken from a recent paper by my colleague Dr. K. C. Dunham, dealing with the most important lead field in Britain, which reaches in the North Pennines from Stainmore Pass to the Roman Wall. I also reproduce certain well- founded conclusions which he has drawn, in comparing conditions during the heyday of Pennine mining, seventy years ago, with those obtaining at present.

(2) Taxation has very greatly increased. (3) Royalties have been very substan- tially reduced. Instead of one-fifth or one-ninth, royalties now vary from one-twelfth to one-twenty-seventh, according to the price of lead. (4) Power costs were an insignificant item in 1870 ; they represent an important item to-day. (5) The initial capital cost of equipping a mine is beyond comparison greater with consequent increase of amortisa- tion charges. Surface prospecting was long conducted in the fell country by directing water collected in reservoirs in a rush that washed its way down to solid rock. With growth of syste- matic mining underground prospecting has been carried out by driving long exploratory levels at some chosen horizon at right angles to the regional trend of veins. The Beaumont Company in Weardale drove 120 miles of dead developmental levels between 1818 and 1876, and obtained on the average 3*71 tons of lead concentrate for each fathom of this work from the deposits which it opened up. Dunham has indicated on a small-scale map unexplored areas, where the available evi- dence affords reasonable expectation that new deposits may be found. As might be expected these areas lie thousands of feet back from the already explored valley sides. In most British fields there has been a very marked slump in lead production, introduced by a break in prices, which started in 1878. Only the richer portions of deposits remained worth extracting, and little or no money could be set aside for prospecting. As a result, mines went out of action as they finished their proved reserves, with important tem- porary exceptions as at Mill Close in Derby- shire and Halkyn in Flint. On the other hand, while lead and zinc production has wilted, that of the barium minerals, witherite and barytes, and of fluor- spar has markedly increased. This is due to demands arising from new uses, for instance, of fluorspar as a flux in basic open-hearth production of steel. The Cornwall-Devon field has supplied √îne of the starting-points for theories concerning the genesis of mineral veins. Tin-stone, for instance, in association with boron-fluorine- minerals, notably tourmaline, is commonly found in veins within or near the margins of granites. There can be no doubt that it is a</page><page sequence="7">544 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Sept. 15, 1 944 high temperature precipitate, from emana- tions proceeding from the consolidating in- teriors of the granites concerned. Moreover, in the Cornwall-Devon field a lode may vary greatly, upwards or sideways. The Dolcoath mi√±e, near Camborne, is the most quoted example. Starting at the surface on a copper lode, it yielded 230,000 tons of copper ore, containing 16,000 tons of copper, but in depth it found the lode failing in copper and developing workable tin instead. This experience is repeated in other examples. The zoning of the Cornish ores has an extensive literature. In so complex a setting it is wonderful that regularities have been dis- entangled. Mr. Henry Dewey has given a rough indication of the general upward succession, built up from many partial examples as follows : - Tin oxide zone, with wolfram in its upper part (overlapping into copper-sulphide zone), 2,500 feet ; copper sulphide zone, 2,500 feet ; zinc sulphide, followed by lead sulphide, 1,800 feet ; antimony sulphide, etc., 200 feet ; iron and manganese carbonates, 400 feet. The tin oxide zone, it is suggested, was deposited at at about 5500 C., and the others at falling temperatures down to 400 0 C. for the car- bonates. There is a danger, which Dewey would be the first to acknowledge, in this diagrammatic up and down presentation of ore distribution. It might lead the unwary to expect a rich copper development beneath every important lead mine of the district, whereas experience shows that this happy condition is far from general. Ore succession in the Cornwall- Devon field, as in all others, has a lateral as well as a vertical pattern. Dines dealt with this matter particularly clearly in 1933. He stressed the conception of emanative centres, and of an increasing lateral distribution, as compared with vertical, in each successive upper zone of deposition. I feel at times that some of these accounts of ore distribution attach a little too much importance to bulk temperature of the country rock bounding the channels of ore deposition. If an ore-bearing solution flows fairly rapidly, its temperature at any point may be largely determined by the time taken on its journey from the distributing centre. Another example of lateral separation of lode minerals, with less of the vertical element than in Cornwall, has been deciphered by Dunham in the North Pennines, where shales have often limited ascent of a solution by closing in on a conduit. From a copper pyrites centre, or centres, a rough outward succession can be traced through blende and galena, mixed, to galena, almost by itself. Concomitantly fluorspar among the non- metallic minerals gives place to barytes. The vein-stones of Britain are confined to the Palaeozoic rocks. This is very likely largely due to the great majority being of Palaeozoic date, though evidence on the sub- ject is tantalisingly difficult to get. It is only quite certain, so far as I know, in relation to the Parys Mountain ores (pre-Carboniferous), and the Cornwall-Devon ores (Permian). Care has to be exercised in interpreting negative evidence. Ore-bearing solutions cannot be expected to spread upwards through thick clays unless propelled with something of the violence of a volcanic outburst. Accordingly, the bulk of the Mesozoic and Tertiary rocks might escape veining through shelter afforded by the Keuper Marls and Lias Clays. Actually, I think that the bulk of the mineralisation of Britain is Palaeozoic ; but I am ready to listen to those who argue that much of the barytes of Scotland, for instance, may be of Tertiary date. Here it is proper to refer to certain impreg- nations found at various localities in Triassic conglomerates and sandstones of the Mid- lands. The best-known are those responsible for great cavernous workings in the Keuper sandstone of the Trias at Alderley Edge, in Cheshire, where tools have been found which have been ascribed by Boyd Dawkins to Bronze Age miners. The impregnations include copper carbonates and blende. Two main explanations have been offered. Mr. A. M. Fini ays on, for instance, regards the solu- tions which deposited the ore impregnations as a late continuation of those which in the hard older rocks have yielded veins. Dewey, on the other hand, thinks that the solutions were developed more or less in situ as a consequence of attack upon detrital ores, derived by erosion from the older rocks. The matter obviously deserves very careful field and microscopic reinvestigation, though many of the exposures are in unsatisfactory condition. Solution and re-deposition with consider- able change commonly affect the richness of veins in the weathering zone. The most susceptible ores are iron pyrites, FeS2, and copper pyrites, CuFeS2. Both are reducing agents giving so far as the iron is concerned ferrous sulphate, followed by hydrated ferric oxide. The oxidation occurs in two con- trasted positions. Towards the surface,</page><page sequence="8">Sept. 15, 1944 THE NATURAL RESOURCES OF GREAT BRITAIN 545 oxygen is supplied from the atmosphere and develops both ferrous and copper sulphates. At greater depth, where atmospheric oxygen is exhausted, oxygen is supplied from such copper sulphate, as has passed down in solution. Thus various copper sulphides are precipitated at these lower levels giving rise to a secondary enrichment. Many mines, after penetrating a leached upper level, have further down proved profitable among pro- ducts of secondary enrichment ; and then have failed in original ores at depths not reached by descending sulphate solutions. The famous china clays and china stones of Cornwall are generally attributed to destruc- tive activities of certain members of the great series of epianations that produced the mineral veins of the district. According to this view, particular emanations traversing already con- solidated portions of the granites have attacked the feldspars, removing alkalies, and leaving water in exchange, combined with residual aluminium silicate. I must now conclude, though, with so vast a subject, I have scarcely commenced. I have mentioned in passing fluxes and furnace linings. Among the latter must be reckoned, not only silica rock and dolomite, but also bricks made from fireclay. Fireclay is again widely used in sanitary ware. Other in- gredients employed in the pottery trade, besides, of course, china clay and stone, include bone, feldspar, ball clay and flint. Ball clay has much the same composition as china clay, but is a bedded deposit. Many other bedded clays are employed in the production of pipes, tiles and bricks. Most British bricks are now made out of Oxford Clay, a member of the Jurassic system. From bricks one's thoughts pass naturally to build- ing stones, such as are furnished by the oolites of the Jurassic, the magnesian limestone of the Permian and the sandstones of the Trias, Permian and Carboniferous ; or, where special strength and decorative quality are desired, by Palaeozoic granites found in Scotland, Westmorland, Cornwall and Devon. Slates recall Wales and other exposures of Palaeozoic mountains in Scotland, Cumber- land and Devonshire. Limestones, notably the Chalk and the Carboniferous Limestone, supply constructional and agricultural needs. Gravels furnish much of the aggregate re- quired in concrete. Hard rocks, especially those of igneous origin, provide road metal. Sands and soft sandstone have perennial uses for mortar, moulding sand, glass- making, etc. ; and 1939-40 will long be remembered as sandbag year in London. Salt, gypsum and anhydrite, pro- ducts of evaporation during the Permo- Triassic desert stage of our region's previous existence, all have their values. The mineral resources of Great Britain have been brought together during geological time as products of a long series of climatic, geographical and subterranean changes. In the substance of our island we find stores of coal, iron, non-ferrous metals, building materials, roadstones and fertilizers, with soil on top. Even the salt of the earth has not been forgotten. (2) UNDERGROUND WATERS By E. B. Bailey, m.c., m.a., d.sc., f.r.s. Lecture II. - Delivered February 28th, 1944. Man is a relatively slow animal, attached to something of the nature of a home and depen- dent upon a neighbouring source of water. Thus, at first, we may picture him keeping in close touch with rivers, streams and springs. The digging of wells brought emancipation, since experience opened up conveniently dispersed underground supplies hitherto untapped. The beginning of this great adventure is so simple that one almost wonders not to find other well-diggers in the animal creation ; but man alone seems to have advanced beyond the stage of mere standing in water holes or wallowing in mud. His first effort would be to deepen with his hands some existing pool, or to grub down into a moist patch, as a rabbit burrows into dryness. Each subsequent development would be guided by the dropping water level of the summer season. In wells dug without machinery, the bottom always stands a little lower than the water level at the time of digging. In many districts one can plumb the greatest depth to which water has sunk in recent years, unless occasional drought has been so severe as to outstrip the digger. I have said that well digging* brought emancipation to early man from the thraldom of river banks. It was, however, only a partial freedom, for it is not in every district that wells meet water. A good illustration of limited freedom is furnished by the extension of Greater London beyond the City wall. * In a lecture on underground water contributions made bv catchment devices, such as the so-called dew-ponds and roof-fed cisterns, must remain unsung.</page><page sequence="9">546 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Sept. 15, 1944 For centuries building development was restricted to water-bearing terrace-gravels flanking the Thames. It was not till about 1800 that cast-iron pipes and steam pumps rendered habitable the bare surfaces of impermeable London Clay, which nowadays carry the bulk of the population. The discovery of artesian or subartesian water in Tertiary Sands and Cretaceous Chalk below the London Clay was made about the same time. Even if it had come earlier it would not materially have affected the housing problem, except on a basis of co-operative action, for the deep boring required in its exploitation would seldom have been undertaken by the occupant of a small private dwelling. It is interesting to give a thought to the natural history of the underground water of which we are speaking. Like the water of our surface streams and lakes, where, of course, we readily see or can imagine movement, under- ground water functions as portion of a mighty current leading from sky to ocean. No part could maintain itself indefinitely above sea level if cut off from replenishment. It is true that in certain basins, walled and floored with impermeable material, underground water might linger stagnant for what, to mankind, might seem eternity ; but even- tually it would be dissipated by subterranean evaporation, more slow, but no less sure, than the subaerial evaporation responsible for dissipation of desert lakes at the surface. There are some who think it dangerous to compare the circulation of underground and surface waters, because the differences are so important. Except in the caves of limestone districts, there is scarcely an underground stream or lake into which a man could dip a finger. Usually the underground analogues of surface streams and lakes are enoimously extended bodies of water, minutely distri- buted throughout the substance of saturated permeable rocks ; the streams ooze very, very slowly in some direction or another ; the lakes stand practically stationary - until relief of pressure, such as is furnished by the pumping of a borehole, gives local oppor- tunity for escape. A slightly closer approach to surface conditions is afforded in cases where the underground flow is conducted, not in- discriminately through the main mass of the containing rock, but along an interlacing set of fissures. Erosion may in such a case give local mastery to some particular fissure, or sequence of fissures, thus concentrating discharge into a spring, rather than a seepage zone. In the special case where the country rock is limestone, soluble enough to be etched but strong enough to resist collapse, concen- tration may extend far underground, and fashion for itself a lengthy cavern. I have spoken of permeable and imper- meable rocks. The difference between the two may be expressed as follows : where both are saturated, the permeable will share its water with any well that is dug into it, whereas the impermeable will not. The pores or cavities of impermeable rocks are so small that they exercise molecular attraction, often called capillarity, upon all water that enters them, and, accordingly, refuse to yield it up in response to a gentle tug from gravity. Thus, if a well is sunk into a saturated permeable rock it will obtain water. In the simple case where the permeable rock con- tinues vertically upwards to the surface of the ground, water will continue to enter the well laterally until its surface reaches the upper limit of saturation in the rock, the so-called water table. The water table will not be constant. It will vary in response to the seasons and to pumping, either from the well itself or from near neighbours. I have already pointed out important differences between underground and surface lakes, if, in spite of Aristotle's protest, the former term is held to be admissible. Now let me add another. An underground lake in a permeable formation is often confined beneath a cover of impermeable rock, which may, in places, descend far below the water table established in the permeable formation where this latter communicates upwards freely with the surface. To match this condition in connection with a surface lake, one is driven to small-scale analogies. If one sails on Lake Windermere, the water level on either side of the boat corresponds sufficiently closely with the water table of the under- ground lake in its unconfined portions ; while the water beneath the boat is in a position analogous to that of the underground water where confined beneath impermeable cover. If now a juvenile experimenter bores a hole through the bottom of the boat, water will spurt upwards in an attempt to reach as high as the free water surface alongside the boat. Similarly, if a borehole be drilled through impermeable cover into a confined under- ground lake, water will tend to rise in the borehole to the level of the water table along- side the cover. If the surface of the ground, where the bore is sunk, is lower than the adjacent water table, the water in it will gush out into the air at the top, exactly as it gushes</page><page sequence="10">Sept. 15, 1944 THE NATURAL RESOURCES OF GREAT BRITAIN 547 out into the air within the boat. A gushing well of this type is called artesian, after early examples in the province of Artois, northern France*. Wells in which water rises from a permeable formation through an imper- meable cover part way to the surface are classed as subartesian. All this is particularly clearly illustrated in the London basin. The chalk in its outcrop forming the rim of the basin rises locally 800 feet above the sea. Internally it passes underground to be confined beneath an imper- meable cover of Tertiary formations that include London Clay as their main component. This cover locally, in the heart of the basin, continues to some 250 feet below sea level. When, towards the end of the eighteenth century, a number of bores were sunk through the London Clay to the underlying chalk, some at Hammersmith and Chelsea actually overflowed, while others so nearly achieved this distinction that the term artesian was very commonly applied to the whole series. Since then many deep bores have been sunk and pumped by individual firms anxious to avoid the rates charged for piped supplies. The result has been something that we can only partly parallel in our boat experiment on Lake Windermere, because : (1) The water of London's under- ground, chalk-enclosed lake plays but a minor and transferable part in supporting the weight of its imper- meable cover - transferable, since at short notice the whole load can be handed over to the solid matrix which contains the water itself ; this condi- tion can roughly be imitated by grounding our boat before puncturing its bottom. (2) The movement of the underground water in response to readjusted pres- sures is extremely slow as com- pared with similar movements of the water of Lake Windermere. Below central London, the cumulative effect of pumping for a century had de- veloped by 1936 an area of 53 sq. miles throughout which standing water level in wells served by the chalk had been depressed to more than 100 feet below the sea ; in half of this area the depression exceeded 200 feet, with a maximum of about 300 feet. Such delay in response * The earliest dated arti√±cial artesian wells seem to be those of Neolithic age in the Kharga Oasis. Natural artesian springs are, of course, fairly common. contrasts vividly with the almost immediate refilling that follows mo- mentary cessation of pumping in a leaky boat. In my previous lecture on minerals I had occasion more than once to point to changing values. It may be safely prophesied that fresh water will always figure in the first rank among necessities of human life. It also seems certain that its applications in industry and agriculture will continue to increase. Most mineral resources are wasting assets with reserves in many cases calculated to meet industrial requirements for no more than the next few hundred years. Rate of replenish- ment is generally scaled in geological periods, rather than in intervals with human signifi- cance. There are a few exceptions such as the shell sand of our shores, the peat of our moors, the diatomite of our pools, the travertine of hot springs in certain foreign countries, the guano of rainless coasts, not our own, and, most fortunately, the soil of our fields where precautions are taken against soil erosion. It is a relief to realise that fresh water, whether found on the surface or underground, falls in the replenishment category. The currents of fresh water that lead from air to sea along the surface of the land, and underground, are returned by evaporation from sea to air. The procession is cyclical. Of course, this year by year replenishment has local exceptions. Under London, the long continued and increasing reduction of water level shows that here, at any rate, we draw on capital. It is not that too little water is supplied by heaven to affect replenishment, but that, with the very slow velocities that are possible for water flowing through the chalk, the intake at the distant periphery cannot compete successfully with the heavy withdrawal made at the centre. One finds, for instance, that the peripheral chalk is saturated where it passes under its Tertiary cover. This is obvious, because besides sending, as it must, very sluggish streams down under the Tertiaries to replenish the great subterranean lake, it feeds copious springs, as at Carshalton and Ewell, at about 120 feet above the sea. These springs repre- sent surplus water taking advantage of an unobstructed high level avenue of escape. It is a rough and ready rule in Britain that of all the rain which falls one- third is returned to the air by evaporation ; and of the remain- ing two-thirds, destined for the sea, half, in a district of permeable outcrops, goes by per- colation to join the sluggish ground water,</page><page sequence="11">548 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Sept. 1 5, 1 944 while half runs off in rapid surface streams. An approximate estimate for the annual rainfall on Great Britain is 52 million million gallons. The third that is evaporated is by no means a complete loss. Before it is returned to the atmosphere a large proportion has done essential service in passing through plants and animals. In fact, the evaporated fraction is at least as useful to us as the unevaporated 35 million million gallons that eventually reach the sea. Let us consider a very few representative ways in which water is spent in maintaining our modern civilisation. A countryman on the average gets 10 to 12 gallons per day ; an unfortunate city dweller is compensated with from 30-40 gallons, or even more, per day. A cow in full milk needs 16 gallons per day ; so that a farm with 100 head of dairy cattle requires some 1,500 gallons per day for stock watering, and a considerable volume for cooling of milk and washing of utensils. Horticultural interests in the Lee Valley consume between 3,000,000 and 4,000,000 gallons per day. Generation of 1,000 units of electrical energy by heat engines requires 90,000 gallons of water ; generation of the country's total from this source some 6f thousand million gallons per day. Hydro-electric schemes throughout the country employ some 900,000 million gallons per year ; that is on an average i' thousand million gallons per day. An express train uses 11,000 gallons between Waterloo and Plymouth ; a large running shed servicing locomotives needs 250,000 gallons per day. An oil refinery, manufacturing petrol, benzine, kerosene, diesel oil, fuel oil, etc., from crude oil, consumes about 25 gallons of water for every gallon of crude oil input. These are just isolated items ; but I am assured that the total annual requirements of man, domesticated beast, irrigated crop and industry, for the country as a whole amount to some 4√å to 5 million million gallons. This figure lies comfortably within the estimate of the 35 million million gallons returned to the sea, particularly as much of the used portion is counted twice, thrice or even more often on its long beneficent journey. Accordingly, there appears con- siderable room for future expansion. It may, however, be taken for granted that the fit will remain quite loose to the end of time, even when hydro-electric schemes, which at present handle some 900,000 million gallons per year, have been pushed to their economic limit. As matters stand mobilisation of surface waters accounts for some 4 to 4^ million million gallons per year. The corresponding figure for underground waters is some 200,000 million gallons per year. What I have said about the rough equality of distribution of surface and underground water upon outcrops of permeable formations does not apply more than superficially to the Wet West, which receives 32 million million gallons of rain per year. Speaking broadly, much the larger part of Great Britain west of a line from St. Abbs Head on the North Sea to Start Point on the Channel, that is Scotland, Wales, and a considerable strip of England, is floored by ancient impermeable rocks, with only a thin and discontinuous mantle of permeable cover (the so-called drift). The drift mantle temporarily absorbs a large proportion of the rainfall ; it plays an impor- tant role in regulating discharge of surface water ; but it seldom furnishes a reservoir of more than local significance for artificial exploitation. The Wet West is the home par excellence of surface supplies of such cities as Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham, and of such hydro-electric schemes as those of Fort William, Kinloch- leven, the Tummel and Loch Doon. I do not want to be misunderstood just because I have to compress broad generalisa- tions into narrow compass. The Wet West, as I have defined it, embraces certain areas where the geological conditions provide for very helpful underground storage of water. This applies to much of the industrialised Midland Valley of Scotland, where, for instance, the breweries of Alloa and Edin- burgh rely on underground reservoirs ; also to Lancashire and Cheshire, between More- cambe Bay and the Dee estuary, a district which is best accommodated in our hydro- geological partition of Britain by swinging the St. Abbs Head - Start Point line, just a very little to the west so as to pass by along the coast. Until recently, Birkenhead took all its water from local bores, though now it has followed the lead given by Liverpool and pipes water from the Welsh hills. When we turn east of the St. Abbs Head - Start Point line we find oui selves in an England with successive belts of permeable and impermeable outcrops. Some of these outcrops are broad and continuous, so that they can be represented individually, even on</page><page sequence="12">Sept. 15, 1944 THE NATURAL RESOURCES OF GREAT BRITAIN 549 a small-scale map. Others include narrow permeable and impermeable strips in closely alternating series, so that little more can be indicated than a mixture of character. Most of Great Britain has been mapped by the Geological Survey on the scale of six inches to one mile, and it is often possible to tell an inquirer whether a proposed well site lies on a permeable or impermeable outcrop. If the well is to be quite shallow this information is tantamount to saying that success is possible or impossible : possible, because a permeable formation will yield water to a well, if it is itself wet (though not if it is dry) ; impos- sible, because an impermeable formation will not yield water to a well, even if it is itself saturated. The further question, as to whether the permeable formation is likely to be wet or dry, is answered by reference to the geological structure in relation to the shape of the ground, and by the accumulated experience of well diggers in the neighbourhood. The Geological Survey collects and tabulates information about wells in all parts of the country - though, for economy of effort, it pays much more atten- tion to deep wells than to shallow. In the case of a deep well the question is no longer will the well start in a permeable formation, but rather will it end in this happy situation. Here, if the ground is thoroughly known, a geologist can often give a positive answer, saying that, at about such and such a depth, the bore may be expected to enter such and such a permeable formation. Again, fortified by recorde of neighbouring wells, he will be justified in prophesying that this permeable formation, when encountered, is likely to be wet or dry, as the case may be. If he thinks it is to be wet, he will probably venture to add an estimate of yield in gallons per hour, and to foretell whether the well will be artesian or subartesian. This, in broad outline, is the geologist's contribution. The water engineer has to get the goods. He has to dig a shaft or bore a hole, it may be hundreds of feet deep. A shaft is 3 feet or more in diameter ; a borehole may vary down to a few inches. From a shaft, at appropriate levels, almost horizontal headings or galleries may have to be driven. The headings of the Brighton Water Works, driven in the chalk, aggregate some 5 miles in length ; but such a total is exceptional. A borehole is drilled, either by a heavy chisel, raised and dropped, raised and dropped, or by an auger or bit, rotated round and round, round and round. The operation, as a rule, gives chips and sludge, which are washed to the surface. In special cases, however, the rotating bit is armed with diamonds or some artificial substitute, and provides a cylindrical solid core, which is pulled up after it has reached a certain length. There is plenty more to arrange ; casing or tubing to exclude conta- minated water, or to prevent collapse of walls ; perforation of casing to admit desirable water ; marginal filters of gravel to regulate flow and avoid silting ; and, of course, pumps for any but free-flowing artesian water. Pumps are of various types : for instance, in the air-lift pattern, air is blown in at the bottom and water bubbles or froths over at the top. So much for the minimum equipment required for the development of an under- ground source. If the water has to be distributed to a number of users one must add a small reservoir to cope with irregular demand and pipes for transit. Two obvious advantages, which underground water often possesses over surface water, are that there is no need for an extensive artificial storage reservoir, or for miles of artificial pipes to bring the water to the distribution centre (the miles of gallery of the Brighton system are, I have already said, exceptional). Reservoir and feeding pipes are supplied by Nature herself in the permeable rocks below and around the site of the pumping station. In all questions of water supply, whether from surface or underground sources, quality is of prime importance. There have been all too many examples of pollution by eewage and disease-carrying germs, or by toxic and corrosive trade effluents. On the whole, underground water, if the near-surface contribution be excluded, is much less risky than surface water. This holds especially in regard to flow through the porous body of a rock, rather than through open fissures. The water undergoes natural filtration. Some authorities attach importance to the idea that in the upper oxidising layers noxious microbes have to run the gauntlet of a gelatinous film of harmless indigenous micro-organisms. At any. rate, noxious microbes are creatures conditioned to a comfortable intra-human existence. If they escape in the upper layers, and start on a sluggish deep-seated voyage, they generally perish within the next few days - that is, before they are likely to enter any well which has been tubed in its upper portion. At the same time there is a tendency, fostered by occasional misfortune, to make doubly certain, even where tests give no cause</page><page sequence="13">550 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Sept. 1 5, 1 944 for anxiety, in other words to destroy patho- genic organisms by treating the water with chlorine. Where underground water flows in open Assures, as it does in many limestones, it is little more exempt from organic pollution than if it travelled in a surface stream. Continual vigilance is required to see that sewage effluent does not enter a limestone. It is, however, a cheering, though somewhat unsavoury, thought, that sewage treated by modern processes, such as that of activated sludge, yields an effluent which is tolerated by fish, fortunately for us, creatures of high susceptibility ; and that residual noxious elements tend to be soon oxidised. Con- sideration for the rights of fish, or more probably of fishermen, has materially helped to make it possible for London to prosper on the diluted sewage effluent of Windsor, Windsor on that of Reading, and so on up the course of the Thames. Perhaps this picture may tend to spread despondency and alarm ; but behind the fishes are ranged experts for ever testing and treating the water they pump from the river. The fish problem, of course, mainly concerns the economy of surface water, but surface water has a habit of finding its way underground. Dissolved inorganic impurities of natural origin are, according to their nature, respon- sible either for salinity or hardness. Salinity is due to the presence of sodium chloride, NaCl, the common salt of the sea and the breakfast table. With less than 30 partis of salt per 100,000, water is classed as thoroughly drinkable ; with twice or thrice this amount it becomes tasted. For certain chemical operations, and in extreme cases for ships' boilers, salinity is cured by distillation, or sometimes in the former case by treatment with " artificial zeolites " ; but much more commonly it is accepted up to a specified limit, and beyond that avoided. It may seem surprising that our permeable rocks often yield fresh water from depths far below sea level. If all Britain stood just above sea level, all our underground water would be salt, unless protected by some impermeable barrier ; but actually much of our island rises to considerable altitudes, and stores within itself a slow-motion stream fed by the rains of many seasons, not merely by a single shower. Thus, there oozes through the permeable rocks a slowly descending column of fresh water, which displaces by virtue of its weight subjacent layers, whether these be fresh or salt. The downward outward flow continues till a depth is reached, at which equilibrium is attained on a basis of difference of density, coupled with diffusion. When a deep bore is pumped near the coast, care has to be exercised not to use up too rapidly the accumulated reserves of fresh water. Other- wise the well may be invaded by sea water, and may take years of rest to recover serviceable freshness. Trouble often arises, even in inland situations, where there does not happen to have been sufficient passage of fresh water to wash out from the rocks salt dating back to the period of their formation, millions of years ago - a relic, one may call it, of original sin. Hardness is of two types, temporary and permanent. Both are mainly due to the presence of lime in solution - I adopt old fashioned terminology which any chemist can translate into terms of ions. Where the hardness is temporary, the lime occurs as soluble bicarbonate, CaC08, H2COs ; but, where the hardness is permanent, the lime occurs as sulphate, CaS04, or chloride, CaCl2. It will suffice here to speak of temporary hardness, so-called because dis- pelled by boiling which, by driving off half the carbon dioxide as a gas, precipi- tates the remaining simple lime carbonate as an insoluble solid : - CaC03, H2C08 = CaCO, + H20 + C02. Temporary hardness is characteristic of water derived from limestone, itself simple carbonate of lime, and readily attacked by natural waters containing carbon dioxide in solution. Hardness is good for drinking4', bad for washing ; good for breweries, bad for boilers. Many authorities soften their water before distribution. One method seems almost paradoxical, for it depends upon addition of further lime in solution : - CaCOs, H2C08+Ca0=2CaC08-f H20. It will be noticed that the addition of CaO has here given the same simple insoluble lime carbonate (doubled in amount), as previously resulted from subtraction of COt. Another method is by base exchange in special filters, where lime is retained in place of soda in artificial zeolite or activated glauconitet- Regeneration of the filter is affected by washing wtih a solution of common salt, which disentangles the captured calcium as chloride. ‚Ä¢ I mean more palatable. From the health point of view, I ack of lime in drinking water is compensated by its presence in food. t Natural glauconite in greensand is sometimes ready- activated through partial replacement of potash by soda.</page><page sequence="14">Sept. 15, 1944 THE NATURAL RESOURCES OF GREAT BRITAIN 55 1 I have touched lightly here and there upon representative aspects of underground water. It remains to gather together their significance in relation to local problems of supply and demand. The needs of the Wet West will always be met primarily from surface water. The problem is largely to find good non-leaky sites for reservoirs, with serviceable catch- ments. Position and elevation must suit the purpose, whether it be to furnish a gravity supply to a city, or power to a turbine station. Search must be made for sound natural walls, and also for a good foundation for a dam. Underground water in the Wet West may be considered under three headings, accord- ing as it is contained in superficial deposits, thick permeable formations or mines. Water supplied by superficial deposits to developed springs or boreholes may have value out of all proportion to its small individual volume, because of its wide distribution in rural localities. Water held in thick permeable formations in many parts of the Midland Valley of Scotland, the Carlisle plain and South Wales, can be called upon according to convenience. Water in many abandoned coal mines in Scotland and Wales, and metalliferous mines in Cornwall and Devon, may have commercial applications, and even be suitable for drinking. It is interesting to note that the metalliferous mines just mentioned are situated in country rock that is in a general sense impermeable, but traversed here and there by belts of smashed, water-bearing material. Such belts are, as a rule, too widely and haphazardly spaced to make a profitable target in water exploration ; but they are encountered willy nilly in large-scale mining operations. Cam- borne, Penzance, Newquay and Perranporth draw much of their water from abandoned mines. England, east of the Wet West, still relies largely on surface waters. Thus, it draws important piped supplies from Wales and the Lake District, though not from Scotland, because of geographical isolation, nor from the Devon peninsula, because of low eleva- tion. It also looks internally to the Pennines as a convenient site for surface reservoirs ; while London, York and other riverine towns accept with due precautions what Nature, perhaps with some assistance, delivers through surface water-ways at their very doors. In many districts, however, there are thousands of individual users, ranging from cottagers to important commercial under- takings and entire municipalities, who find it economical to take advantage of supplies passing beneath their feet. Even for the London area the Metropolitan Water Board takes one-sixth of its huge total from under- ground. There are, in the parts of England now considered, numberless sources of under- ground water, shallow and deep. For wide extent the superficial deposits are again specially noteworthy. They, more than any other source, have made the countryside habitable right up to the present day ; but the modern world is growing impatient of their limitations. In towns superficial de- posits have generally been discarded : Lon- don, for instance, no longer drinks from the polluted gravels which for long centuries made its existence possible. Even in the heart of the country a desire for baths and other domestic amenities, and for clean drinks for cattle, is driving the local wells deeper or calling for piped supplies from a not too distant distribution centre. The comparatively rapid advance of towns in improvement of water supply is due to the greatness of their need, the simplicity of their distribution problem and the weight of their collective purse. To-day rural areas are attracting particular attention. They may be separated into three groups : - (1) areas where there is no possi- bility of local water supply other than that derived from shallow wells or ponds, giving very small and uncertain yields of doubtful quality ; (2) areas where water is readily obtainable from a local source, either from wells of comparatively shallow depth or from reliable surface sources ; (3) areas where there is no constant water supply near or at the surface, but where a deep well, or one furnished with extensive headings, may pro- vide for a large district, though often at a price beyond the resources of local private enterprise. These three types of areas are distributed through the greater part of Eng- land in a manner reminiscent of the streaki- ness of tasty bacon. The pattern is well known to geologists, and should be carefully accommodated in any plans that may be formulated for banishment of the village pump and cottage well. A country district that cannot reach a satisfactory supply through development of its own resources, should be coupled with some adjoining country district more favourably endowed, or with a neigh- bour town which has won the chance of super- fluity, either by piping from a distance,</page><page sequence="15">552 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Sept. 15, 1944 sinking to a considerable depth, or pumping and treating the local river. This is no place to enter into detail : I merely point out that if community planning is to be extended in scope there already exists much sound knowledge to help direct its enterprise. I propose to conclude on a related topic - that of public control. At ‚Ä¢ present there is little public control of under- ground water in Great Britain, except in relation to pollution and to certain monopoly aspects of water supply undertakings separately determined by Act of Parliament. There is, for instance, no public control of the cut-throat competition* which has lowered the water level in Central London wells to 200 or 300 feet below the sea. I have already pointed out that this competition has led to big calls upon hydrological capital ; I may add that it is also drawing in the sea. The chalk of the southern rim of the London basin is exposed for a short distance in the bed of the Thames at Gravesend. In the old days of plenty, underground water filled the chalk at this low level to overflowing and bubbled out at springs in the river bed. Now the current is reversed : brackish water creeps down towards the low pressure area below Central London, and has led to aban- donment of well after well in its course. The question is very complicated. Some may suggest that London's great store of underground water, though a source of wealth to many individuals, has been a hindrance in the rapid development of the riverine supply for the good of all - since its exploitation has withheld much money from the common effort ; these will view its apparently inevitable annihilation with grim equanimity. Others may suggest that the development of London's underground water served a useful public purpose in its own day by lightening the strain on the river scheme ; but now that the latter has attained maturity, they may consider subterranean help no longer required. Others again may suggest that, however irregular the distribution of advantage has been, the underground water of London was a public asset and that its failure, if come it must, will be a public loss. * An interesting cognate case of competition, which must appeal to anyone travelling north from Liverpool Street Station, is exemplified by the miles of glass houses which shelter the tomatoes of the Lee Valley. Twenty-three deep wells, drawing 2,000,000 gallons per day to supply these houses, lie within two miles of the Turnford Well of the Metropolitan Water Board. There is one source of water, the Chalk. Not un- naturally the water level is on the downgrade. At any rate all will agree that no scheme of artificial replenishment or of maintenance through restriction, could be adopted except as a public experiment designed for public, and not individual profit. I think it probable that before very long measures will be taken to regulate in some manner further development of the under- ground water resources of the country as a whole. Our legislature may be trusted to remember that regulations in an obscure subject often bring unexpected results. I hope, therefore, that full advantage will be taken of experiences gained in the United States of America, where several circum- stances co-operate to make underground water relatively more important than it will ever be in Britain. (3) HYDRO-ELECTRIC POWER By Sir William Halcrow, m.inst.c.√©. Lecture III. Delivered on March 6th , 1944. The first two lectures in this series, which have been given by Dr. Bailey, dealt with the underground resources of this country, and I have been asked to complete the picture by giving some idea of the uses which have been made and can be made in the future of the surface water resources when applied to hydro-electric power. Many people have the impression that water swiftly flowing in a river must be capable of producing large quantities of power. This is not strictly true as, for prac- tical purposes, you must concentrate the water at a point and then make it fall from a height. If you increase the fall of, for in- stance, a gallon of water from one foot to a hundred feet, you will get a hundred times more power. Water has been used as a source of power for centuries, the most usual form being the water wheel. The water, collected from a river by building a weir across it, is carried along a channel, often called a mill race, running along the bank. From the end of the channel the water falls on to a wheel which generally drives a mill. This underlying principle is the same even for the largest power station of the present day. When a large hydro-electric power scheme is being considered the area to be developed is examined and a site is chosen for the main dam, behind which the water will be stored</page><page sequence="16">Sept. 15, 1944 THE NATURAL RESOURCES OF GREAT BRITAIN 553 before passing it down to the power house. The water is collected from various outlying streams to the reservoir above the dam by means of special channels if they do not link up directly with the main river system, so that the maximum amount of water is made available. From the dam the water passes through a tunnel or an open conduit to a point above the power house, where it enters pipes. These pipes carry the water under pressure to the turbines which drive the electric generators. The potential water power resources of Great Britain are not large in relation to the population when compared with other coun- tries, and the areas where major develop- ments have been and can be carried out are mostly far from our industrial towns where the need for cheap electricity is greatest. These towns have grown up round the ex- tensive coal fields with which we are so richly endowed, and electricity has been generated by coal-burning power stations. But, with modern developments in the methods of distributing electricity over long distances, it has become more and more apparent that hydro-electric power can be of advantage to our industries if we produce enough of it. It may be said that at the beginning of this century power derived from water was confined almost entirely to water wheels and small turbines, of which there existed a large number in the rivers. These were used extensively for industrial power purposes, notably for the production of textiles and for milling. The number of installations was probably considerable, but, as the individual capacities were small, the power in the aggre- gate was not great. According to a census of production in the United Kingdom taken in 1 9 17 of the total engine capacity less than two per cent, represented water power plants. The production of certain metals, especially aluminium, requires large quantities of cheap electric power, and it was for this industry that the first hydro-electric power schemes of any size were developed at the turn of the last century. The British Aluminium Com- pany were the pioneers in the production of water power on any scale, and they deve- loped a scheme in 1896 at Foyers, on the shores of Loch Ness. A few years later, the Aluminium Corporation built a power station of about the same size at Dolgarrog in North Wales, and by 1914 two more schemes had been developed, still for the production of aluminium, one at Cwm Dyli in the same region as Dolgarrog and the other at Kin- lochleven in Scotland. The last one was the first hydro-electric power development to produce a fairly large quantity of power con- tinuously, its capacity being 30,000 h.p., as compared with 6,700 h.p. at Foyers. It was not until the later period of the Great War that public attention was drawn to the potentialities of the natural water resources of the country by the appointment by the government, through the Board of Trade, of a committee to examine and report upon the water power resources of the United Kingdom and the extent to which they could be made available for industrial purposes. The Committee undertook a comprehensive survey of the question, and in their final report, issued in 1921, stated : - " The water power resources of Great Britain are to be regarded as of such impor- tance to the Nation that their development should be effectively regulated that they may be utilised to the maximum extent and best advantage." In 1 92 1 the British Aluminium Company obtained powers by an Act of Parliament to develop the Lochaber Water Power Scheme utilising the extremely high rainfall on the Ben Nevis range of mountains. This scheme was constructed in three successive stages. The power house has a total capacity of 120,000 h.p., and is the largest in the British Isles. The first of the larger Scottish hydro- electric developments for public supply was carried out in the Clyde Valley in 1926, and in 1927 the Grampian Company began the construction of extensive works, which were completed a few years ago. In the interval three important schemes were put before Parliament in 1929, but two of them, the Affric scheme and the West Highland were rejected. The third, the Galloway scheme, was authorised and the five power stations were opened in 1935 and 1936. The Caledonian Power Scheme, which was designed for the production of calcium car- bide, formed the subject of Bills in Parlia- ment in 1936, 1937 and 1938, and on each occasion it was rejected on second reading by the House of Commons. In 1941 the second Glen Affric scheme, after being passed by Parliamentary Commission which conducted a lengthy enquiry, was also rejected ; so that of the six northern Scottish schemes pro- moted since 1929, none was passed. The principal Scottish plants constructed to date are, in the order of size : -</page><page sequence="17">554 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Sept. 1 5, 1 944 Lochaber Grampian Kinlochleven Galloway Clyde Valley Foyers. Schemes planned in some detail but not constructed are the Glen Affric and Cale- donian, having capacities which would bring them between the Lochaber and Grampian plants. These schemes bring the total developed and projected (to 1941) power in Scotland to Trollh√§ttan Power Station , Sweden . about 350,000 h.p. of continuous output. Although this may appear a fairly large figure, the record of the last twenty years is not an imposing one. Anyone interested in the history of the development of water power in the Highlands of Scotland could not do better than read the report of Lord Cooper's Committee. My brief summary shows that in a period of twenty years seven Bills were promoted and only one passed. The develop- ment of the most important asset of the High- lands was persistently opposed and there was little prospect of industrialists sinking more money in promoting Bills which became, to a large extent, political issues. Unless other steps could be taken these assets would continue to be of no value. I may say that the cost of promoting a Bill for s√ªch schemes may be as much as ¬£30,000. There is room for a great deal of further development, and I propose to devote the second part of this lecture to the possibilities of the future. After the rejection of the 1941 Affric Bill, the Secretary of State for Scotland appointed a Committee to " consider the practicability and desirability of further developments in the use of water power resources in Scotland for the generation of electricity. " The committee reported favourably on the work already done and recommended that further developments should be undertaken. It proposed the formation of a body on the lines of the Central Electricity Board. This proposal was accep- ted by the Secretary of State for Scotland, and the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board was formed and is now actively engaged on future plans. The Cooper Committee, dealing with the history of the development of Scottish water power and referring to the rejection of the Bills to which I have already alluded, write : - "We must assume that good and sufficient reasons existed in each case for the rejection</page><page sequence="18">Sept. 15, 1944 THE NATURAL RESOURCES OF GREAT BRITAIN 555 of six successive promotions. But our study of these abortive promotions, and of the evi- dence which we have obtained, has revealed a number of disquieting features. All major issues of policy, both national and local, have tended to become completely submerged in the conflict of contending sectional interests. Local opinion has vacillated widely from time to time and has been, and is, acutely divided both on general principles and on the merits though coal is virtually non-existent north of Fifeshire. In the result, the whole subject has become involved in an atmosphere of grievance, suspicion, prejudice and embittered controversy." So we see that whenever it was desired to obtain the necessary legal rights to develop a certain area for the production of hydro- electricity, the promoters had to fight a losing battle against a number of vested Verampio Power Station , Italy . of individual proposals ; and some of the views on policy which have been locally advanced have been neither self-consistent nor technically practicable. The opposition of landowning and sporting interests seems to have been pressed further than was justifiable for the protection of their interests, and, in some cases, to have been taken more seriously than was intended ; and in several instances strenuous opposition has been offered by the Mining Association with the object of pre- venting hydro-electric development so as to maintain or increase the demand for coal, interests, including the political. Fishery, amenity and coal interests were strong opponents, and if we look into their cases we find that they have really little firm ground on which to stand. When these large schemes are constructed it is unavoidable that the flow of rivers is disturbed to a certain extent by the construction of dams and other works. However, when they are completed, and provision is made for the passage of fish to the impounded reservoirs, the surrounding land is soon restored. Passes or ladders have been built which give salmon an easy passage y</page><page sequence="19">556 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Sept. 1 5, I944 and at the same time detract nothing from the efficiency of the reservoir. Whenever a new scheme is promoted there is a great deal of talk and writing on the subject of amenity. Most of the complaints which have been made about the injury to Highland scenery have been exaggerated. There is no doubt that, during the construc- tion of the works, a certain amount of dis- figurement is bound to be suffered, but this is only temporary. Some hold the view that a dam and reservoir destroy the beauty of scenery ; on the other hand, others maintain that these form an attraction to the district. My own experience is that the presence of hydro-electric works has brought many visitors to the Highlands who would otherwise not have gone there, and I have no recollec- tion of any case of a potential visitor being deterred by them. When we consider the developments abroad we can visualise many schemes which can in no way be said to have spoiled permanently the attractiveness of the district. Switzerland and Sweden might be specially mentioned. Some of the power house buildings which have been constructed are certainly pleasant to the eye. I propose to show some slides of power houses built abroad at the end of this sectioh of my lecture. The argument of the coal owners was that the production of hydro electricity on a large scale would so reduce the consumption of coal as to be a major disaster to the industry. That is certainly not the position to-day when the nation is short of coal. If some of the large schemes put before Parliament in the 1930 period had been carried out the fuel situation during this war would undoubtedly have been easier. A point to be remembered is that our mines will be producing less coal as they gradually become worked out. It is our duty to plan for this eventuality by pro- ducing power from any other resources which are available. I might add in this connection that, if the Caledonian Power Bill promoted by the British Oxygen Company had been passed, an electro-chemical industry would have been established in these islands to produce a commodity of which we are in great need during the war, but which has now to be brought in ships from abroad. The Cooper Committee, referring to the defeat of the Bill, said that it can only be recorded as " a tragic mistake not only for Scotland but for Great Britain." When hydro-electric schemes were first discussed, it was the general opinion that large quantities of power were going to be made available for the general public at an exceedingly cheap rate, but when certain schemes were put into operation it was found that the price paid for domestic uses was just as high as the current in similar areas supplied by steam stations. Hydro-electric power is cheap, but only in its actual production. The distribution of the power costs the same whether it is developed from water or from coal and distribution is by far the largest part of the cost. However, in the case of industrial organisations, where the factories can be established close to the power stations, there is no doubt that they can obtain electricity at a very cheap rate, as has been done for the aluminium industry. An investigation made shortly before the outbreak of war of the comparative cost of power from water in Scotland or from a steam station situated near a coal field showed that under the most favourable conditions, with coal at 15 s. per ton, the cost of steam power was about double that of water power. With coal at to-day's prices, the margin in favour of water power is, of course, much greater. An important point to bear in mind when considering relative cost of water and steam power is that, although the initial capital cost ofthe former is higher than that of the latter, the bulk of the annual cost is made up of interest and sinking fund. The steam station on the other hand has to pay for fuel. The life of water power works may be taken for financial purposes at seventy-five years, although the dams, tunnels and other structures have an indefinite life. If, during this period, the capital is paid off in annual instalments, the interest charge steadily falb, so that at the end of the period the cost of electricity from water is extremely small. The plant of a steam station has to be renewed, say, every twenty years and the coal bill is more likely to increase than decrease. I have referred to the new North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board formed to develop Highland water power, and it is inter- esting to note that there are possibilities of producing over 1,000,000. turbine h.p. con- tinuously. This is equivalent to steam station? of 3,000,000 installed h.p., working on a 33 per cent, load factor. Many of the plants will be small, and it may be some time before they are developed, but there is no doubt that the nation has a useful asset in water. The Cooper Report records the excellent work done by private enterprise in the High- lands and corrects the wrong impression that</page><page sequence="20">Sept. 15, 1944 THE NATURAL RESOURCES OF GREAT BRITAIN 557 the companies were making huge profits. In the case of the Grampian Company the return earned on the money over a period of ten years was a little over 3$ per cent, on six million pounds of capital employed. I have confined my remarks so far to water power in the Highlands, as I have been intimately associated with these developments, and because the largest potential power is to be found there. There are other parts of the country where water power can be developed, more notably in Wales, but they have not been studied to the same extent as those in the North. No picture of the hydro-electric develop- ment of Great Britain would be complete the beginning of the nineteenth century. The Tamar wheel was subsequently super- seded by a small turbine. During the last hundred years several methods of using the power of the tides have been proposed and in some cases utilised. One method was by the float system in which a float of a certain weigTit was made to rise with the incoming tide, and then allowed to drop during the falling tide. It was made to work through a system of levers and gearing, but the mechanical complications of gearing such a slow motion were too great. A second system was called the tidal stream system, and here it was the flow of the water more than its rise and fall which was made to do Fig. i. without reference to tidal power. Tidal power is the power available from the flow and ebb of the tides. The method of harness- ing the power is to construct a barrage across an estuary with openings left in it to allow the water to flow into the enclosed area. When the tide is high the openings are closed, and as it falls the difference in the level of .the impounded water and the sea below the barrage is utilised to drive turbines. The earliest record of the use of tidal power is in 1790, when a tidal mill w√°s installed on the River Tamar in Devonshire which was still in operation a few years ago. Originally water wheels were used in tide mills on more or less the same principle as wheels on ordinary rivers, and it is believed that quite a number of tide mills were in operation at the work. A large paddle wheel was made to turn with the current and thence drive the machinery, but here again the power gener- ated was so small that its economic value was negligible. The only workable scheme is the basin system, which I have outlined. A few years before the war the French constructed a small experimental tidal power scheme on the basin system at Aber Vrach, near Brest. This scheme should prove very interesting when details of its capabilities become available, but from what has been published so far it is evident that there are no insuperable difficulties in harnessing hydro-electric power from tides. It is clearly desirable to have as large a rise and fall of tide as possible, and favourable conditions are to be found in the Severn</page><page sequence="21">5s8 journal of the royal society of arts Sept. 15, 1944 Estuary. The maximum rise of tide at the most promising site for a barrage is as much as forty-seven feet, and the estuary above is large enough to store an immense quantity of water. The first proposal for a barrage across the Severn was made in 1849, not with the object of generating electric power, but for impound- ing the water for shipping purposes, and also with a view to providing a crossing by railway and road to South Wales. Nothing, however, came of this scheme and it was not until 1917 that further consideration appears to have been given to the matter, when a scheme was prepared by my late partner, C. S. Meik, for under the Chairmanship of Lt.-Col. J. T. C. Moore-Brabazon (now Lord Brabazon), to enquire into the report on the practicability of the Severn Barrage. A comprehensive study was made of the scheme and the report was not issued until 1933. Recently, the Minister of Fuel and Power has appointed another Committee to review the scheme, in the light of present knowledge, and to report thereon. The chief difficulty to be overcome in tidal power schemes arises from the continual variation of the power output. The tide falls twice a day and the period of high tide advances by about one hour each day. Fig. 2. a barrage at Beachley, just above the conflu- ence of the Wye, to develop hydro-electric power. The general principles of the scheme were a sluice dam to allow a through passage for the inflowing tide, a turbine dam to generate power on the outgoing tide, locks for ships, and a subsidiary water power scheme with a reservoir at Treleck Grange for equa- lising the unequal production of power from the incidence of the tides. The estimated capacity of the plant was 750,000 h.p. The proposal was considered by the Water Power Resources Committee, who agreed that it was practicable and recommended that a further, more detailed, technical enquiry should be made. In 1920 the Ministry of Transport put forward a scheme with the same basic principles, the site chosen being the alter- native one at English Stones. In 1925 the Prime Minister appointed a Committee, Again, more power can be produced at spring than at neap tides. To make the tidal power house independent of steam stations, it is necessary to store power when generated and not required for consumption, and to produce it during periods when no power can be obtained from the tides. One method of doing this is, as I have already indicated, to construct a subsidiary water power scheme in the vicinity of the Severn. A reservoir would be formed on high-lying ground as at Trelleck Grange, into which water would be pumped, using power from the barrage, and then drawn from the reservoir to provide power when required. By this system, how- ever, a substantial proportion of the power from the barrage is lost in pumping water to the reservoir, and it is hoped that the greatly increasing consumption of electricity and the comprehensive system of distribution through</page><page sequence="22">Sept. 15, 1944 THE NATURAL RESOURCES OF GREAT BRITAIN 559 a large network of transmission lines (known as the Grid), may lead to a more economical solution of the problem. I have prepared a diagram which shows that when the tide has risen to its full height and the gates are shut, and the water downstream of the barrage is allowed to fall for a distance of about nine feet, it becomes practicable to start the turbines in operation. As will be seen from the diagram these continue to function until the difference in level between the impounded and the tidal water is again about nine feet, when the turbines are shut down. The sluice gates are opened when the rising tide below the barrage reaches the level of the impounded water. The next diagram which I show indicates the variation in the quantity of power during a cycle of tides from the springs to the neaps. The shaded portion of the diagram shows periods during which power is available, and the spaces between them indicate the time during which no power is available and other methods of supply must be adopted. On present estimates the power which could be derived from the Severn Barrage would be less than one-tenth of the total consumption of electricity to-day. An alternative to the water storage subsidi- ary plant is the use of steam stations, which would have to operate at different periods each day, owing to the advancing times of the tides. There are other methods of storing power now being considered, and I may mention the studies which are being made of hot water storage. The idea is that surplus energy could be used for heating water in large tanks situated in tojvns, so that houses could be supplied with constant hot water in the same way as they are supplied with cold water, gas or electricity. I have endeavoured in this brief lecture to show what possibilities exist for the develop- ment of hydro-electric power in Britain. There is no doubt in my mind that great benefits have been enjoyed in Scotland as a result of power developments there, and that these benefits will be extended. Also, the Severn Barrage is being given more immediate consideration, in view of the trend of coal production in the future. Water as opposed to coal is not a wasting asset, and given suit- able financial arrangements, the cost of power produced from water should in any scheme be a steadily reducing figure. Present calcula- tions show that Scottish water power, together with the Severn Barrage, could produce about one-fifth of the estimated post-war power consumption in Great Britain.</page></plain_text>
