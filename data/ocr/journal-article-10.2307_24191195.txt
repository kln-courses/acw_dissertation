<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUMMARIES Gerald J. Blidstein THE CONCEPT OF ORAL LAW IN R. SCHERIRA'S EPISTLE The Epistle of R. Scherira Gaon (10th cent.) has been the major catalyst for questions regarding the literary history of the Talmud. But since it is likely that the major thrust of the work was ideolo gical, it ought be analyzed on that level as well. The Epistle claims that the Oral Tradition was uniform from its inception. This uniformity existed with regards its substance, not its form (a distinction used elsewhere to explain anomalies in the history of the tradition); the novel authority claimed for the Mishnah, therefore, is literary as to substance, nothing new has been created. This literary standardization (mvoing the Oral Law closer to the Biblical model) becomes necessary due to the decline of the Jewish people and the corruptions of its traditions after the des traction of the Second Temple. And as the decline continues, the Talmud must be created to present and explain what was always known by the sages of old. R. Scherira's attitude towards the Talmud ought, then, be highly ambivalent if not negative; that it is not, indicates the ideological origins of his reconstruction. Now, in order to enter a claim for Mishnaic authority, R. Scherira must assert that the Tannaitic period was, paradoxically, a time of calm both after and before the (perceptibly) approaching storm. Thus, Mishnah is now substantively authoritative — if not creative — as well as literarily fixed. R. Scherira suppresses indications — both literary and legal — of Talmudic creativity, for these would violate the notion that the entire tradition was present, whole, at its origin. But even having done so, he is hard pressed to explain the existence of the Talmud itself. The denial of true human creativity can be maintained easily over against a revelatory trans-human reality; it is virtually impos sible to maintain when discussion the relationship of two periods in human history. This was recognized by Maimonides, who pointed the discussion of the history of Oral Law in a different direction.</page><page sequence="2">60 Yochanan Silman BETWEEN THEORY OF GOD AND THEORY OF MAN IN THE KUZARI This paper examines two stages in the development of the thought of R. Judah Halevi. It also examines briefly the viewpoint of the Aristotelean philosopher. According to the latter, the theory of God is the systematic starting-point for establishing the three-way cor relation between the theory of God, the theory of man and the nature of the interrelation between God and man. In addition, the connection between the individual and God is solely ontological in nature, and is based on the ontological possibility of beccoming similar to The Active Intellect. This possibility depends upon the assumption that a basic ontological identity exists between God and man. This assumption is connected in turn with a dualistic concept of man. Accordingly, the essence of man is identified in the intellect. Judah Halevi's earlier thought is characterized by its internal systematic contradictions. Many of these contradictions are rooted in different interpretation of the interrelations between God and man. Jewish religious experience simply cannot be reconciled with the meaning given to this interrelation by the Aristotelean philosophy. Halevi's later thought exhibits an implicit and explicit reliance upon experience which causes a revolution in the very meaning of God, and similarly in the meaning of man. Halevi has reservations concerning the ontological meaning attributed to the essence of God as well as to the essence of man, and he grants them a new systematic, cognitive and existential meaning. This new meaning is rooted in sensory experience and in the reaction of the whole human entity to it. The revelation of God to man determines the human entity. Accordingly, this entity in eludes body and soul, intellect as well as imagination, feelings and senses. In Halevi's later thought the connection between God and man is no longer established on an ontological basis, but upon man's deeds — in his fulfilment of God's demands. Parallel to this, the identity of God becomes consolidated by man's repeated experiences, as one of a God of free will who is concerned with existence outside of himself.</page><page sequence="3">61 Hanna Kasher THE GUARANTEE OF TRUTH ACCORDING TO SAADIAH AND MAIMONIDES Basic differences exist between the position of Saadiah and Maimonides on various questions of theology. Many of these dif ferences can be explained by examining the way each of them regards the conscious criteria for judging the truth. Saadiah is faithful to the classical definition of truth, in which knowledge is identical to the object itself. When the object in question cannot be empirically verified, there arises the problem of certainty. Saadiah therefore had to relate to questions such as the existence of God, His characteristics, the divine source of the Torah, and the reliability of the prophets. He regarded miracles as typical divine intervention, and these constituted proof of the cor rectness of claims that had religious significance. Due to the faith ful tradition, the meaning of miracles reached far beyond their times. Maimonides, for reasons of his own, refrains from relying on miracles and tradition. In his various writings, he accepts a claim as true if it is arrived at by way of the critical method. In certain cases he specifically forgoes the verification of whether in fact there is identity between knowledge and the object itself. In his view, therefore, "True Prophet", "True Messiah" and "True Torah" are defined by their practical fulfillment, without our knowing for certain whether they are divinely inspired. Moshe Idel THE IMAGE OF MAN ABOVE THE SEFIROT This paper deals with the concept of Supernal Light of R. David Ben Jehuda he-Hasid and its metamorphoses, according to his unpublished answer to one of his pupils. This answer is printed here, and the implications of its ideas are discussed. Some of R. David's esoteric remarks in his other works, allude to an anthropomorphic structure of ten Supernal lights (tzahtzahot) existing in Ein-Sof. A similar idea also appears in a Gnostic text of a Coptic version. The Lurianic concept of Adam Kadmon seems to be influenced by R. David's concept of the Supernal lights as Shi'ur Komah.</page><page sequence="4">62 Jacob Katz POST-ZOHARIC RELATIONS BETWEEN HALAKHAH AND KABBALAH Kabbalah in general and the Zohar in particular contains statements of Halakhic nature. As Kabbalah interpreted the details of the religious ritual symbolically it had to determine them first. If this determination did not conform to generally accepted norms of the Halakhah the question arose what authority should be attributed to the statements of the Kabbalists. The rule that evolved as early as in pre-expulsion Spain, stated that as long as there is no un answerable contradiction between uncontested Halakhic ruling and that of the Kabbalah the latter is binding. This compromise did however not solve the basic dilemma in volved. Kabbalah claimed to be revelationary truth and as such ought to have had unlimited authority. Halakhah, on the other hand, presented itself as a closed system discarding intervention from whatever external source. It met Kabbalah's claim half-way. The present article analyzes the application of this compromise by 16th century scholars including Rabbi Joseph Karo, the author of the Shulhan Arukh. The rule turns out to have been applied with more or less stringency according to the measure of adherence of the Halakhist to the teachings of the Kabbalah. Gedalyah Nig'al THE "DIBBUK" IN JEWISH MYSTICISM The belief that dead souls can possess the body of living persons, and that these spirits can be exorcised by various means, is wides pread in several cultures and among religious believers of all faiths. This article describes Jewish accounts of this phenomenon (some times called "Dibbuk" in the Ashkenazi tradition), from the writings of Josephus Flavius to descriptions written at the beginning of the twentieth century. Most of these accounts were written by eye wittnesses or actual participants in exorcisms. The large number</page><page sequence="5">63 of descriptions of the "Dibbuk" phenomenon allows us to build up a stereotype of the possessed person and the spirit within him, to define the symptoms of the illness, and to build a model of exor cism ceremonies. The accumulation of material on this subject should serve as the basis for further research by psychologists, sociologists, folklorists, and literary researchers. We have attempted to isolate the particularly Jewish elements of this phenomenon. Jewish accounts usually stress the nature of the sins of both the possessed and the spirit, on account of which they are punished; these sins are generally severe offences in the realm of morality and religion, but more minor offences are also cited, such as making fun of a sage or Hasidic person. The suffering of the possessed person is his atonement, whereas the repair of the spirit is achieved by learning paragraphs from the Mishnah, the reciting of Kaddish, etc. Only when these things have been promised to the spirit does the latter show willingness to depart from the body of the possessed person. The aim of most of the writers of these accounts is didactic : to arouse the readers to repentance, to show that reward and punishment exist, and to show that Hell offers no refuge for the sinner. Most "Dibbuk" stories sprang from a popular environment, often with Kabbalistic influences. Rationalists and Enlightenment followers denied the existence of "Dibbuks", and explained the phenomenon in terms of mental illness. Folklorists saw these stories as the expression of the spirit of the people. Warren Zev Harvey HEBRAISM AND WESTERN PHILOSOPHY IN H.A. WOLFSON'S THEORY OF HISTORY In his youthful essay "Maimonides and Halevi, A study in Typical Jewish Attitudes towards Greek Philosophy in the Middle Ages" (JQR, II, 1912, pp. 297-337), Wolfson contrasted Hebraism (ethics, subjectivity, flux, history, personal God) and Hellenism (cosmology, objectivity, stability, science, impersonal God). He described the mediaeval Jewish philosophers, especially Maimonides, as "Helle</page><page sequence="6">64 nists" who forsook the Hebrew "view of life", and he wrote warmly of a "counter-movement" of "Hebraists", represented in particular by Judah Halevi, which criticized Greek philosophy and sought to define Judaism on its own grounds. Concluding with an ironic twist, he maintained that today Maimonides is of no philosophic impor tance, whereas "Contemporary [philosophic! thought, the whole pragmatic movement, may find its visions foreshadowed in Halevi's discussions [sc., in Hebraism]"! In this youthful essay, therefore, Wolfson in effect argued that Hebraism, though in conflict with Hellenism, is not in conflict with philosophy, and that in the his toric clash beween Hebraism and Greek philosophy, Hebraism eventually won. In his later works, Wolfson developed a novel theory of history according to which Western philosophy is divided into three periods: (1) Greek, (2) "Scriptural" or "Philonic", (3) modern. Philo of Alexandria, who had been portrayed in the youthful essay as a mere Hellenizing Jew, was now presented as a loyal Hebrew who interpreted Greek philosophy in the light of Scripture ("philo sophy had to yield to Judaism on every point on which the two met in real conflict"), and thereby founded the philosophic tradition which reigned in the West — among Jews, Christians and Muslims — until it was brought to an end by Spinoza, who liberated philosophy from Scripture. Wolfson's theory of Philonic philosophy led him to reject much of his youthful essay on Maimonides and Halevi; e.g., Maimonides was now no longer a Hellenist, but a Hebraist no less than Halevi. Nonetheless, Wolson's theory of Philonic philo sophy may be seen as a continuation of his early views. Thus, Wolfson continued to hold that Hebraism was in conflict with Hellenism, but not in conflict with philosophy, and that in the historic clash between Hebraism and Greek philosophy, Hebraism won — except that now the victory was achieved by Jews them selves (Philo and other Alexandrian Jews, not James and the prag matists), and dated almost two millenia earlier. Wolfson's theory of the history of Western philosophy was framed by him in explicit opposition to the Hegelian theory, which according to him was but a "metaphysical restatement" of the Christian theological conception. Wolfson's own theory may fittingly be described as "Hebrew", perhaps even as a Hebrew revolution in the study of the history of Western philosophy.</page><page sequence="7">Pinchas Η. Peli THE USES OF HERMENEUTICS ("DERUSH") IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF J. B. SOLOVEITCHIK METHOD OR ESSENCE ? The essay contains a historical overview of derush as a major literary genre in Jewish tradition. The hermeneutical way of derush (or midrash) from its earliest appearance — in Scripture itself — to modern times, serves as a means of confron ting ever emerging new situations, which present challenges to tradition both from the outside and from within. An attempt is made to prove that the midrashic approach, when assuming this role, is not merely a methodological device to interpret seeming contradictions within sacred texts, but it is rather part of the essence of the process of absorption, or for that matter rejection, of new ideas. It is the only way towards the crystalization of solid new phases of thinking without breaking away from well establi shed revered traditions. Midrash of the type represented by Rabbi Soloveitchik is syncretistic in nature, fully accepting simultaneously the indivisible validity of two modes of culture expressing one and the same truth. In the philosophy of Soloveitchik derush is the very sym biosis between the world ofhalakha and that of the (existential) Western culture. The Herculian effort to present the twin as the dual aspect of one modern truth it prompted, as outlined in the essay, by socio-cultural changes in the m i 1 i e u of the new orthodox Jew in the post-world-war-II era. This tast could not have been achieved without the use of a genuine and innovative hermeneutics developed by Soloveitchik as an immediate response to the new reality of the conscientious halakhic Jew thriving outside of *he confines of the Ghetto as an integral part of Western, especially American culture. Although far removed chronologically the closest parallel to Soloveitchik is to be found in the allegorical works of Philo Judaeus. Parallel lines are drawn between Philo's Alexandria of the first century and Soloveitchik's Boston of the twentieth. We get to understand much better Soloveitchik's dependence on the midrashic genre if we project him unto the "Philonic situation" (taking, of</page><page sequence="8">66 course, into consideration all the vast dissimilarities between the two philosophers, in addition to their distance in time from each other). The situation is marked by a strong Jewish community given to the influence of a powerful culture with which it is not too difficult for Jews to identify, certainly to admire some of its major expressions, while they must vehemently reject its central thesis. What holds true for Hellenism in antiquity holds true for Americanism in modernity. As an example we are offered Soloveitchik's midrashic inter pretation of the two central events in modern Jewish history, namely, the holocaust and the emergence of the modern State of Israel. This interpretation is brilliantly laid out by Soloveitchik in the form of a midrash to some verses in the Song of Songs and the book of Job, offers not only the philosophical and theological understanding of history as it evolves in front of our eyes, but moreover, issues a halakhic imperative as a call to action and realiza tion in this world of one's existential commitment as a participant in contemporary history. The use of derush as the hermeneutical overall setting spares Rabbi Soloveitchik the exact metaphysical labelling of the events. Their intrinsic religious meaning is not expressed in any fundamental manner other than the inevitable call for duty and action.</page></plain_text>
