PART I.-IN INDIA AND THE FAR EAST. I O3 Among Hindu fishermen and seafaring folk in India and the north of Ceylon numerous instances occur indicative of a belief in the expediency of creating an intimate association between a protective deity and the craft which they use, be it catamaran, canoe or sailing coaster. The strength of this belief varies within wide limits; occasionally it is articulate and definite; more often it is vague and ill-defined, often degenerating to a level where the implications of the old ceremonies are largely or even entirely forgotten. In the last category the boat-folk continue to practise some fragmentary feature of the old ritual for no better reason than the belief that by so doing they will ensure good luck for their ventures and voyages, a belief usually linked with a dread of being overlooked by the 'evil eye.' Outside of India similar beliefs were probably widespread in ancient times; to-day shadowy vestiges remain here and there, their survival due mainly to a traditional belief, sometimes strong, sometimes weak, in their efficacy to ensure good fortune or to counteract the baleful glance of the evil eye. The subject falls naturally into two categories, (a) definite and often periodic worship of the protective deity, accompanied by suitable offerings, and (b) customary acts to ensure good luck and immunity from the effects of the evil eye. These are, however, frequently so intermingled or obscurely understood that they cannot be separated in treatment. Except where the contrary is stated, the instances to be given all come within my own personal knowledge. The most definite examples belonging to the first category are to be seen among vessels belonging -to Hindus which are now or were formerly engaged in trade between the Coromandel Coast and the north of Ceylon. Of these the kalla dhoni was the principal craft in the days before a regular through traffic by rail and connecting steamer service was inaugurated. Some of the last of these vessels were lying derelict on the beach at Point Calimere, some thirty years ago, when I visited this locality. In all cases an eye (oculus) was carved on each bow, followed by the words Amma paravi incised within a rectangular panel and surmounted by the Hindu propitiatory sign 2.. The owners, who called themselves Karathurai Vellalas, stated that, prior to the launch of a newly built boat, elaborate puja ceremonies were performed with a viewto dedicate it to the goddess of the village temple, Mari amma, a deity noted as a protectress of seafarers. The final observance in these rites consisted of incising an eye on each bow and the words which followed as above given. This ceremony is termed 'the opening of the eye '; several of the older men stated that this action endowed the boat with sentient life and constituted it the vehicle (paravi) of the goddess, i.e. the vehicle wherein she would abide and be its protectress during voyages across the sea. Similarly, the locally built barque which was my headquarters when inspecting the Ceylon Pearl Banks was named the Rengasami Paravi, being dedicated to the god Rengasami (Ramaswami), thereby becoming his 'vehicle.' The custom of 'opening the eyes' and the consequences following, are analogous to those that are 1 As the English language is deficient in any satisfactory collective term for the host of miscellaneous types of craft used for water-transport-canoes, catamarans, open boats, sailing vessels and steamers-I am here using the term 'ship' in this comprehensive meaning, although I am aware of its inaccuracy in any strict sense or usage. [ 121 ]</page><page sequence="3">No. 103] MAN [November.-December, 1943. obligatory before the image of a Hindu god may become a part of the godhead and thereby suitable for adoration in temple or in the home shrine of a Brahman. Whenever such an image is made by a Hindu craftsman, he omits to indicate the pupil until just before the instalment or consecration of the image. So it is that the small images of Hindu gods in metal or in stone, often to be seen on sale in the bazaars of Indian towns, are always blind; among the strictly orthodox the eyes must be opened-the pupils indicated-with due ceremonial rites before they are suitable for worship. Till then they are lifeless images, without sanctity. When, therefore, we find a similar custom of 'opening the eyes' of a newly built boat immediately previous to launching, this fact confirms the statements made that the puja ceremonies are specifically intended to instal the deity herself in the craft and to merge its individuality in that of the goddess whose pro- tection is sought. Once the eyes are opened, whether in the kalla dhoni under notice or in the masula boats of Madras and Pondicherry, no further attention is bestowed upon them; in the course of a short time all obvious trace of them may disappear, the shallow incision becoming obliterated by weathering or by the paint or tar occasionally applied to the outside of these boats. Crossing to the northern ports of Ceylon, the homes of that old-world craft, the 'Jaffna dhoni ' (called padagu locally), we find the same idea prevalent among Hindu owners and crews, but brought into conformity with the more orthodox views current there among the Hindu community. The eyes of these boats are boss- like, carved separately out of wood, and nailed in place, one on each bow. In the majority of padagqus adorned with eyes, the fore part of the bows and particularly the stemhead, carved into a backwardly coiled figurehead, the surul, is sacred; it forms the boat's shrine and place of worship. The members of the crew are usually orthodox Saivites, so the after face of the surul is painted in white with the three horizontal bars indicative of the sect. In the recess below is a little shelf a few inches above the deck; on this, when I visited one of these vessels, was a shell-trumpet made out of the snowy shell of the Sacred Chank (Xancus pyrum, L.), together with the lamp used in the ceremonies. When worship is to be per- formed, one of the crew who acts as pujari, puts ash on his forehead, lights the little ghee lamp lying on the shelf, burns camphor and incense, breaks a coconut, and rings a bell, while an as- sistant blows intermittently upon the chank trumpet. Offerings of plantains, and pan supari (betel leaves and areca nut) are made to the god and then distributed among the crew. Any indignity to the bow is resented by the crew, as shown by the following incident. One of my assistants when on a voyage in a Jaffna dhoni, happened to seat himself upon the broad surul. The tindal was greatly annoyed at this in spite of the offender being a Brahman; he ordered him off peremptorily, telling him he must not sit there as the prow was the goddess Lakshmi, and that such an act was highly offensive to the goddess. In explanation he subsequently stated that the prow is held sacred among Jaffnese Hindu sailors, consequent upon the religious ceremonies performed at the time of launching. The tindal described these as follows: ' Before the boat is launched it is decorated with 'flags and plantain stems and a flower garland 'hung round the prow, which is a]so smeared with ' sandalwood paste and vermilion powder. A ' small coloured " cloth " such as is worn by ' young girls is also wrapped round the prow; ' finally, a tali or marriage token in the form of a ' small brass cup or bowl is tied round the same ' part exactly as a token of similar form, but 'fashioned in gold, is tied around a bride's neck 'during orthodox Hindu marriage rites. These ' ceremonies are intended to wed a goddess (most ' commonly it is Lakshmi) to the boat and to 'instal her there permanently as its tutelary ' deity. The brass tali used at the launch is a ' cherished possession of the boat-owner and is ' handed down from father to son. However, ' Hindu boat-owners in the north of Ceylon are ' now few in number and the custom of wedding ' a goddess to the boat is dying out rapidly-even ' the custom of placing oculi on the bows is be- ' coming rare.' Regarding the antiquity of these practices it is important to note that the Jaffnese Tamils, long resident in the north of Ceylon as descendants of immigrants and invaders from the Chola and Pandyan kingdoms of South India, have retained many archaic Tamil customs more or less in disuse or forgotten by their kindred on the mainland; they are noted for employing in ordinary speech a form 'of Tamil which they claim closely ap- proaches the classical Tamil of 1,000 years ago. If even partially correct, as is probably the case, the inference follows that their local craft may be expected to retain more marked archaic features and launching rites than those of ports more open to outside influence. The same de- duction applies to the Point Calimere kalla dhoni which was till recently emDloved in traffic solelv [ 122 ]</page><page sequence="4">November-December, 1943.] MAN [No. 103 with the north of Ceylon and whose crews were closely related in origin, caste and customs with the men who man the Jaffna dhonis. Both are above the average in religious zeal and usually aspire to be considered higher in caste than the ordinary run of coast fishermen and sailors. Among the fishing hamlets scattered along the Madras coast we are able to trace almost every- where the existence of a related belief in the sacred character of the prow, but here the ritual, crude and primitive, belongs to that pre-Brah- manic religion in which the deities were village godlings, so strictly local that those of each village concerned themselves solely with the affairs of their own villagers and with their pro- tection against the malignant demons who other- wise would plague them. They had no concern with any other village even when the godling of that village bore the same name. This was reasonable, for whom should these godlings protect if it were not the people who clothed and sacrificed to them ? The catamaran, a primitive craft formed of logs tied together in definite order but differing in design according to the particular mode of fishing subserved, is the characteristic of the whole of the surf-troubled coast northward from Point Calimere to Bengal. No fisherman will go to sea in one unless it has been duly dedicated to and made the ' vehicle ' of a protective godling when first launched; she must also be honoured on each subsequent occasion of putting to sea. The godling is invariably female, Kanniamma by name; she is a virgin deity of kindly nature who is pleased with simple offerings and willing to extend her protection to the poor craft of her parishoners which she accompanies to sea, though invisible in her shrine within the pieces of the beaked prow. She is said to abhor blood sacrifices. Incidentally it is worthy of remark that the. protecting deity of sailors and fishermen in India is almost always feminine. By this association of the boat with a female deity, the identity and sex of the protectress are merged with those of the boat itself; as we may infer that many other peoples have reasoned and acted similarly, this may explain the fact that ships are generally con- sidered as feminine. The ceremonies designed to instal the deity in a newly biiilt catamaran vary greatly from hamlet to hamlet; they are also influenced by the means of the owner, who, if poor, has to curtail the offerings, trusting that the shortcoming may be overlooked. Of several records of catamaran launchings which I possess. the following, that of one which took place near Madras in 1919, is typical:- The owner and his womenfolk put on clean cloths; as professing. Hindus they also placed on their foreheads the mark of their particular sect. Then, after the logs of the craft had been laved with sea-water, the prow (talaiya), con- sisting of several detachable pieces forming a pointed beak, the midships region and the stern (kadaiya), were smeared with turmeric paste in oval patches sprinkled with dots of red powder (kiunkiumum), while garlands of sweet-smelling flowers-jasmine, frangipani and oleander-were hung upon the prow. When the owner can afford the extra expense, he may further deck the prow with a new 'cloth' (dhoti) and place another on the stern. Coming to the puja proper: to one side of the head of the catamaran as it lay pointing toward the sea, a small rectangular area was enclosed with a low ridge of sand, a few inches in height, with an entrance passage facing the sea; this represents the godling's shrine. On the low parapet seven small conical heaps of sand were placed to represent the seven virgin goddesses which in this instance were the godlings chosen for instalment; they are sisters and are named Kanniammar-representing, by multiplication of the original single deity, the idea of increasing the strength of the protection hoped for. Each heap was adorned with turmeric, kunkiumum and a few blossoms. Within the enclosure two pyra- mids of boiled rice (pongal) rested on pieces of plantain leaf; on each heap small quantities of native-made sugar (jaggery) and a piece of plantain were placed, while in front of the heaps were deposited offerings of pan 8upari, half- coconuts, lumps of jaggery, plantains, beaten rice (aval) mixed with fried Bengal gram (kadalai), a potful of palm toddy, a bottle of arrack, some incense sticks, fragments of camphor and more flowers. The priest (pujari) who officiated was an elder of the fishing community, for no Brah- manwill take part in these unorthodox ceremonies, which are considered by their caste as heathenish and unworthy of their cognizance; they do not, however, actively oppose their observance. When the preliminary arrangements were completed, the fisherman-priest burned incense; over its smoke he held a coconut, which was then broken and the halves placed with the other offerings in the godling's shrine. Lastly, after burning camphor before the shrine, a large pumpkin (kalyana pushini kai) into which tur- meric and vermilion powder had been previously introduced through a small hole, together with [ 123 ]</page><page sequence="5">No. 103] MAN [November-December, 1943. an odd number-3, 5 or 7-of the smallest coins current (pies), was carried thrice round the catamaran and then broken to pieces upon the beak. When the ceremonies ended and the craft had been dragged down to the sea and launched amid much shouting and running about, the offerings were shared among the people present. Such is an account of one of the most elaborate of these launching rites; there is, however, no settled ritual. Variations occur from hamlet to hamlet; there is every possible gradation be- tween the elaborate ritual above described and the degenerate and attenuated form where it has shrunk to nothing more than the smearing of turmeric and vermilion on the prow and the burning before it of a piece of camphor. The deity propitiated by these ceremonies is usually a single one called Kanni Amma, a virgin village-goddess with great power at sea. Less commonly (as in the instance detailed above) plurality is attributed to this guardian deity, seven being the recognized number of these virgin deities, termed collectively Kanniammar. But it is not uncommon to find that only five are represented in the conical sand piles which serve to symbolize their presence. Ceremonies much the same but on a reduced scale are performed after a prolonged run of poor catches of fish. Usually the nets are barked again at the same time whereby superficial observation is apt to associate the ritual with this re-barking. Even the coracle-men on the Tungabhadra River have closely related ritual on the occasion of the first launching of their hide-covered coracles.2 At the launching of a new Masula boat at Madras a ritual of the same general character as for the catamaran is followed, but this is always of the elaborate type detailed though usually with various amplifications which need not be described here except in respect of two of the major items. Of these the first is that the ' opening of the eyes' upon the bows is an es- sential feature as in the Kalla dhoni and the Jaffna dhoni. The second is of particular interest for in it, as in the breaking of a pumpkin on the beak of a catamaran, we see a relic from the days when a human sacrifice was necessary to impart good fortune to a newly built vessel. In the present instance the ritual prescribes that a pumpkin, previously injected with turmeric and vermilion as already described, be placed just ahead of the vessel so that when it be dragged seawards the pumpkin shall be crushed and, squelching, shall spray spurts of red and vellow juice over the excited crowd, in simulation of the blood splashes ejected when a human victim was sacrificed beneath the keel of a launched boat. This view is in accordance with what we know of the evolution of the ritual of sacrifice in India. With the gradual advance of milder manners and the influence of higher religious conceptions, domesticated animals came to be substituted for the human sacrifice; the gradation appears to have been, first the ox or the buffalo, then the sheep or the goat, next the fowl and, eventually, as in the instances just adduced, the refinement is reached of substituting a vegetable for a living animal. But even here old custom requires the maintenance of a simulacrum of the original idea, and so a pumpkin has to be treated in such a manner as to give verisimilitude to the sacrificial act. The fact that the bows of the masula boat are also daubed with red spots as well as the exterior of the pumpkin, corroborates this infer- ence; both appear to be intended to represent the blood splashes spurted from the victim as the boat lumbers over the quivering body. Degraded or vestigial remains of the launching ceremonies above described survive among the fishermen of Palk Strait and the west coast of the Gulf of Mannar, people who have lost many of their old-time customs through long contact with Islam and Christianity. For example, I was in- formed at Tirupalagudi on Palk Strait that when a canoe is launched, the carpenter who here assumes the priestly function and acts as the pujari, places an uprooted bush called Thalaisu- ruli at the head of the canoe, cutting it in two so that the halves fall apart overboard when the craft is launched. Afterwards he sprinkles turmeric water over the hull and makes an offering of cocunuts and pan supari and burns incense. A cock or a sheep is also sacrificed according to the means of the owner. It is understood that the local village god is the power propitiated, but beyond this and 'custom' the people cannot or will not go in their explanation. In the nineteenth century when large sailing vessels, schooners and barques were fairly frequently built in South Indian ports, particu- larly at Negapatam and Kilakarai, the cere- monies just described were conducted on a more elaborate scale. At Kilakarai, an important seaport on the Gulf of Mannar inhabited mainly by Muhammadans, many of whom are descended from Arab immigrants, an old carpenter described the launching ceremonial of a schooner as it was in his young days (c. 1870), premising that if the 2 J.

The duty of arranging and carrying through the ceremonies devolved upon the head carpenter (maistri) of the shipwrights, who was supplied by the owner with the needful funds. When the ship was ready to launch, coconuts, pan supari, sandalwood paste and vermilion powder were placed upon a bench adjaceint to the prow, but always to the starboard side, and one or more sheep were held in readiness alongside the other offerings. The sheep might be either one, three or five (always an odd number), but three were most usual. As soon as all these items were collected and placed ready, the carpenter, using a bunch of mango leaves as a sprinkler, splashed water over the whole of the hull to purify it. Next he smeared sandal paste and vermilion on various places along the sides and also upon the prow and the masts. The sacri- ficial sheep were then sprinkled with water and had sandal paste and vermilion smeared upon their heads. This done the carpenter severed the head from the body of each with a single stroke of a billhook and placed all the heads upon the prow that the blood should flow in streams over it. The final act was to make a solemn dedication of the carcases of the sheep and the other offerings to the deity who had been selected to preside over the ship's destiny and be her protector-most commonly it was Lakshmi or Rengasami (Rama- swami). At the conclusion of the ceremonies the heads of the sacrificed sheep were given to the head washerman (dhobi) of the village according to traditional custom while the carcases were taken by the carpenter for his own use, or disposal. Formerly this sheep sacrifice at a launch was the recognized procedure, but to-day, when the launch of a large sailing vessel is of rare occur- rence at Kilakarai and at the various ports on the Coromandel Coast, the ceremonial is greatly curtailed. Instead of sacrificing several sheep, a single individual is taken alongside the vessel where one of its ears is cut and the blood that flows is smeared upon the prow. Some few offerings are also made. Even in the daily routine of fishing the deity associated with the boat usually receives libation and often some simple offering. The most common, practised even by the Roman Catholic fishermen of Tuticorin, is to lave the prow with water as the canoe leaves shore, this duty falling upon the last man to board the boat. In the Palk Strait villages those fishermen who are nominal Hindus by religion commonly smear the prow with mud when going to sea. After a run of bad fishing luck, the carpenter pujari is called in to make offerings which shall ensure a return of good fortune. According to the fee given the ceremony takes the form of (a) sprinkling turmeric water upon the prow accompanied by offerings of coconuts, plantains, pan supari, camphor, etc. or (b) the addition to these ceremonies of the smearing of the two ends of the canoe with castor oil and, if the owner can afford it, the sacrifice of a cock. Corresponding rites are practised in Bengal, where the use of oculi on the bows is common among certain types of boat plying on the Ganges and other rivers. The crews of these craft regularly perform propitiatory ceremonies at the bows, particularly at the time of new moon (amavasi), when a flower garland is hung around the prow and puja performed in the bows, where a ghee lamp is lighted, camphor burned, the sacred chank blown, coloured paste smeared on the stemhead, with libations and offerings of flowers, boiled rice and pan supari to the god whose protection of the boat and her crew is sought. Significance attaches to the fact that when the hull is naked of paint, a large triangular area on each bow is coloured black; similarly the outer part of the long, snout-like stem projection of the large Arab ship called a bitm, hailing from the Persian Gulf, is likewise always painted black. No explanation is forthcoming. On occasions when danger threatens at sea or when a prolonged dead calm unduly protracts the voyage, the Roman Catholic sailors of Tuticorin occasionally revert to their pre-Christian custom of appealing for help to the goddess believed to guard sailors and their craft. On one occasion when one of my assistants was a passenger on a local boat, the wind failed. After several hours without progress it was arranged that the tindal should do puja at the bows at the expense of the passengers in the hope of breaking the calm. The tindal (captain) having collected the requisite materials poured a libation of water over the prow, broke a coconut on the stemhead and hung a flower garland around the coiled surul of the stem; the coconut halves were left on the prow. At the conclusion of the ceremony the tindal prostrated himself behind the stempost, reciting or mumbling certain formulw. The next [ 125 ]</page><page sequence="7">No. 103] MAN [November-December, 1943. day when he was asked by my assistant for an explanation he was confused in his reply and denied the coconut and other offerings, evidently afraid to own to this 'heathenish ' practice lest it were reported to the parish priest; he did, however, concede that it was still a practice with his people to wash and garland the prow if there should be any unclean person aboard; this he believed-a truly Hindu conception-would be sufficient expiation to counteract the impurity of the unknown person aboard the boat. The fishermen of the same coast, although Roman Catholics, preserve, sub rosa, several emasculated versions of other pre-Christian practices when poor results attend their fishing operations, due as they believe to some evil influence, whether of a malign spirit as some think, or to the effect of the evil eye as others prefer to suppose. One of these practices is to pour a libation over the prow of a mixture of turmeric and coconut kernel ground together to a paste, subsequently rendered fluid by the addition of water. Beyond the confines of India, this belief that every boat is endowed with a sentient soul under- lies related practices in various countries. Some of these, practised by Arab sailors and by those of several lands around the Mediterranean, appear to be relics of human sacrifice offered during launching ceremonies; these are given in Part II, which follows. It will suffice as illustrative of such belief if I quote Annandale 3 for the state- ment that some of the Malay fishermen of Patani, on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula, believe, although Muhammadans, that their boats have souls and that these men make a practice of placing turmeric-stained rice upon the prow every Friday to ensure good fishing. The custom of the Solomon Islanders of affixing the head of a slaughtered enemy upon the prow of a new canoe has the same end in view as have the religious ceremonies of Indian boat people, but instead of intercession addressed to a benevolent goddess, it takes the form of a barbarous and bloody act. The explanation of the Solomon Islanders' reasoning is readily understood if we consider it as an act which transfers the bodily and spiritual power resident in the victim to the canoe-a practical example of the doctrine of mana, once widespread through- out Oceania. Grant Allen in an explanation which does not mention mana, came independently to almost an identical conclusion when he con- tended that this deed was intended to liberate a guardian spirit from the human victim and to incorporate it so intimately with the planks and timbers of the canoe as to become part and parcel of its fabric. A similar transference of power (=mana) was undoubtedly the reason for the human sacrifices which sometimes sullied the launching of a Viking longship. And as we have seen memory of a bloody rite of the same character is the meaning which we have to read into the crushing of a pumpkin filled with red and yellow pigment under the keel of the masula boat of Madras at the time of launching, but in this case it is intended to propitiate a goddess in order to induce her to identify herself closely with the safety and well- being of the craft. PART II.-IN ARABIA AND THE MEDITERRANEAN REGION. A-t Port Sudan, Massawa, and Jibouti, I have frequently seen Arab vessels, uisually of the sambuk class, with the stemhead swathed in a goat skin, hairy side outwards. This, I was told, is done just before a vessel is launched and is the concluding act in the ceremonies considered es- sential to ensure good fortune to the craft in her future voyaging to and fro. Of these ceremonies the principal one consists of the sacrifice of a goat; after the head is cut off the carcase is flayed and the skin thrown over the stemhead and there lashed down securely. A similar custom is recorded by Zwemer,4 as followed at the launching of boats engaged in the Bahrein pearl-fishery; he adds that the figure-head of these craft is termed the kubait. Other writers have also mentioned this custom of offering a blood sacrifice at the time of launching of Arab vessels; Alan Villiers 5 records it as usual at Ma'alla and elsewhere on the southern coastline of Arabia. A sacrifice of this character is foreign to Islamic ritual and cannot well be other than a survival from the days of a pre-Islamic cult in which black stones, probably of meteoric origin in most instances, were objects of worship, to which blood sacrifices were made. At the conclusion of the sacrifice it is probable that the flayed off skin was draped over the sacred stone. The black stone embedded in the wall of the Ka'ba at Mecca was one of these lithic pagan gods or fetishes. Apart from this somewhat doubtful instance from pagan Arabia we have the authority of Herodotus (II, 42) that in the neighbouring land of Egypt a ceremony of related character took 3 N.

The ram was sacred to this god who is commonly represented with a ram's head set upon his shoulders; the ram was probably the totem of a certain community or group of people at an early period, who, in later times, endowed their totem with the attributes of divinity and then represented it in partial anthropomorphic form. According to Herodotus the priests of Amon (whom he equates with Jupiter), never sacrificed sheep on ordinary occasion, their place being taken by goats; a single exception occurred during the principal festal season of the god. On this occasion one of the most important features of the religious ceremonies was the offering up of a ram to the deity after the fashion prescribed by ritual usage. Stripping off the fleece, Amon's priests ' put it upon the statue of the god. When 'they had done this, all who were in the temple ' beat themselves in mourning for the ram and 'then bury him in a sacred vault.' The similarity of this ceremony of draping Amon's statue in the skin of the sacrifice with the ceremonial wrapping of the skin of a sacrificed goat around a ship's stemhead, is .etremely sug- gestive of a common origin, but this is as far as we are justified in going. In all these instances the fundamental and original belief entertained by the people who followed this practice appears to have been that the skin of the sacrifice becomes itself sacred when offered to the god; when stretched upon any object, such as the figurehead of a vessel, this was considered as identifying it with the god himself, thereby bringing the vessel into such intimate association with the deity as to ensure protection from accidents and evil happenings. A similar belief in early times underlay the widely followed custom of providing a ship with oculi on the bows; in the course of time this primary reason has been forgotten except in a few ex- ceptional instances; oculi came to be debased with rare exceptions into a mere amulet whereby a vessel so provided might find its way in safety through the manifold dangers that beset it during its voyages upon the sea. The custom of preserving the skin of the sacri- fice as a visible token of the act and with amuletic intent appears to be confined to regions where Moslem.influence is or has been strong. This is particularly noticeable in the Mediterranean area; Malta, Sicily, parts of the Adriatic coasts and the southern shore of Spain and Portugal, are all localities where the people have been for some considerable period in their history in intimate cultural contact with the Arab world; in several instances they have even come under direct Moslem rule and have been overrun by Arab armies and immigrants. From the details given below it will be seen that the actual goatskin has been replaced in many instances by a wig-like substitute made after the fashion of the head of a mop. Generally the strands of the mop-head are of hemp, but some few are of coir and others of worsted. The use of an actual pelt is less common, but examples have been noted in boats belonging to Italy, Portugal and Syria; in Gozo a rabbit skin is used. Sicily.-Syracuse is the only Sicilian port where I have noted the custom as prevalent. There, in 1930, I found that the smaller fishing boats were all characterized by a stemhead orna- ment formed either of rope-end ravellings or of coarse worsted strands.6 Among the small craft used for ferrying passengers across the harbour, this mop-head has degenerated into a globular wooden knob usually encircled with an annular pattern turned horizontally upon it. Malta and Gozo.-In the island of Malta no trace of this peculiar stemhead ornament is to be seen to-day. That it was formerly in use is probable on the evidence of a sprit-sail Ferilla (labelled Speronara) in the Valletta Museum. In this picture the summit of the lofty, vertical stempost projection is covered by a wig-like object which cannot be other than a hairy pelt pulled-well down over the swollen end of the stempost. I could gain no information on the subject for a long time, being told that no such custom has ever existed in Malta so far as my informants were aware. Later, I was so fortu- nate as to meet Mr. G. Caruana, a gentleman belonging to Gozo, having a wide acquaintance with the island's customs; from him I learned that within his own knowledge as a fishing-boat owner, he had seen Gozo fishermen lash a rabbit skin over the stemhead of a newly built fishing boat before launching her. As I have noted elsewhere,7 Gozo fishermen are intensely super- stitious and may even contemplate murder if the luck-bringing oculi of their boat be maliciously damaged by a neighbour jealous of a special run of good luck experienced by a newly built boat. The Adriatic coasts.-On the west coast of Italy no sign is to be seen of this stemhead custom, 6 For illustrations of this mop-head fitting, see Hornell, J.: 'Survivals of the Use of Oculi in Modern Boats,' J.R.A.I., LIII, 1923, and ' Boat Oculi Survivals: More Records,' J.R.A.I., LXVIII, July/Dec., 1938. 7 Hornell, J.: ' Survivals of the Use of Oculi in Modern Boats,' J.R.A.I., Vol. LIII, p. 315, 1923.

Spain and Portugal.-The rope-yarn mop-head type of stemhead affix is seen on some small boats fishing out of the southern Spanish ports adjacent to the Portuguese frontier (Huelva and Ayamonte), but the majority have abandoned the custom. In Portugal, in all ports from Lisbon to Villa Real on the Spanish frontier, a notable proportion of the local fishing craft have retained the stem- head covered with a wig-like mass of worsted or of rope ravellings, usually of hemp, occasionally of coir; a fair number, however, adhere to what I was told is the old or original fashion, the use of a goat skin tied over the bulbous end of the stem. This stemhead is usually formed by nailing to each side a circular or slightly elliptical plano- convex wooden cheek. In a few instances I noted that the bulbous termination was arrived at by affixing a globular mass of burnt clay, perforated at the centre, upon a peg projecting from the sumnmit of the stempost. This way of forming the terminal knob appears to be older than the use of side cheeks nailed on. The caiques of Algarve, Setubal, and Lisbon and the canoes of Cezimbra and Setubal are among the Portuguese craft most addicted to the use of the mop-head stem adornment. Syria.-On schooners owned by Moslems and registered at Syrian ports, it is not uncommon to see the rudder head covered with skin, hair side outwards. I saw several at Famagusta in 1930. Whether this has the same significance as when the skin covers the stemhead is in doubt for the men questioned could or would not give any other reason than that it was customary. A similar difficulty is experienced when questions are asked concerning the significance of the skin-covering of stemheads in Italy and Spain; the answers are always evasive or vague.</page></plain_text>
