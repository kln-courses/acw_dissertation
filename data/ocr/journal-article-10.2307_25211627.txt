<plain_text><page sequence="1">UNHINGING SlVA FROM THE INDUS CIVILIZATION1 By Doris Srinivasan When books on Hinduism begin with a discussion of the Indus Valley civiliza tion, one of the main postulates to illustrate the influence of the Indus upon Hinduism is that Siva originates from this prehistoric civilization. The postulate is based on three types of objects found in the Mature Harappan context (c. 2500?1900 B.C.) which strongly evoke the personality of the great Hindu god. These objects are phallic emblems and baetyls, seals, and some sculptures. As to the first, conical shaped objects of stone, shell, faience, paste or clay were found in the Indus cities and an outpost, and these emblems are found to bear considerable resemblance to the later conventionalized HHva-lingas. So too the Indus ring stones are likened to the later yonl-rings, objects representing the female organ and located at places holy to the Goddess (her plthas). Regarding the second, a seal from Mohenjo-daro portraying a central figure with ithyphallic and tricephalic features, seated in yogic fashion and surrounded by four animals is identified as a proto-Siva figure whose pasupati nature is already recognized. This famous seal, Mohenjo-daro seal No. 420, incorporates the most extensive range of symbols shared by a set of Indus seals, which are, on that account, all thought to exhibit proto-Saivite symbolism. Lastly, two sculptures are suggestive evidence that the Indus region visualized something akin to the aspects that later comprise diva's nature. As such, a small, broken stone sculpture from Harappa is conjectured, when its missing limbs are reconstructed by modern scholarship, to assume a dancer's pose; in consequence the piece is understood as evocative of a Siva Nataraja.2 Another small figure from the HR area of Mohenjo-daro has female breasts and male sex parts, though not in urdhvalinga.3 Thus the broken, clay figurine is a hermaphrodite, and although the unification of sex attributes is rendered in a mode different from that in later Hindu art, the figurine shows an emphasis on sexual symbolism as does the later Siva Ardhanarlsvara.4 The theoretical implications of these interpretations are enormous. If these remains are considered proto-Saivite, then the Indus Valley Civilization becomes a valid source for the interpretation of any later development in Saivite thought and art. Moreover, an a priori condition is established whereby subsequent interpretations must take into account and harmonize with the proposition that the Siva-idea originated in a non-Vedic culture which precedes the advent of the Hindu tradition. To state it another way, Siva as yogi, Siva as the erotic god, Siva as Nataraja, Siva as Pasupati, Siva as Ardhanari, Siva as the polycephalic Mahadeva, and Siva as linga, all would trace their origins to beliefs conceived outside ofthe Hindu tradition. The main elements of this postulate were first advanced by Marshall in the brilliant chapter on religion in his monograph Mohenjo-daro and the Indus</page><page sequence="2">78 UNHINGING SlVA FROM THE INDUS CIVILIZATION Civilization.5 Although it was published over fifty years ago, the theory has proven to be attractive ever since. However, as there has been a steady, recent amassing of pertinent information from archaeological findings as well as from studies in art history and the history of religion, it is a good time to review this interpretation. The review will concentrate on the two types of objects for which new information is available: the so-called phallic emblems and baetyls, and the seals, especially seal No. 420 from Mohenjo-daro. A. Mohenjo-daro seal No. 420 (Plate I) Marshall identified a proto-Siva on seal No. 420 because he viewed the figure and the surrounding field as replete with proto-Saivite iconography.6 He saw the figure's head as tricephalic and associated this feature with the later Hindu iconographic convention of multiple heads, especially as it appears in the iconography of Siva Mahadeva. He noticed the figure's yoga-like posture and recalled Siva's position as the yogi par excellence; he suggested that an erect phallus may characterize the figure, though he conceded that what seems to be a phallus may be "the end of a waistband".7 The figure's ornate headdress reminded him of Siva's later emblem, the trident. The four wild animals in the field prefigured for him Siva's aspect as Lord of Animals, or Pasupati. It is these four criteria ? the headdress, the posture, the face and the animals ? which need to be reexamined in the light of recent findings.8 For a clearer understanding of the headdress a terracotta "cake" from the Harappan levels at Kalibangan offers valuable insight.9 Kalibangan is a site about 120 miles south-east of Harappa. On the obverse side of the "cake" a human figure is crudely incised. The figure wears a headgear composed of two large upward curving horns and a central branch-like configuration. The shape of the horns is nearly identical to those on seal No. 420; the only major differ ence is that the Kalibangan horns are devoid of the transverse striations which decorate the horns on seal No. 420. The central branch motif on the Kalibangan "cake" is basically similar to the central portion belonging to the headdress on the seal, though the "cake" shows a naturalistic rendering and the seal shows a stylized rendering. Indeed there can be little doubt that the headdresses on the "cake" and the seal are composed of the same elements, though the former exhibits a graffito quality and the latter an engraver's skill. As such, the figure on seal No. 420 wears a mitre composed of the branch and horn motif. Actually the mitre on this seal appears to be the most stylized version among a series of more naturalistic examples found on several other so-called proto-Siva seals from the Mature Harappan phase at Mohenjo-daro; the mitres on seals Nos. 222 and 235 display designs more transparently derived from horns, leaves and plants.10 Moreover, there is evidence for a pre-Harappan phase of development of these forms.

All these ceramic pieces come from the Early (i.e. pre-Mature) Indus phase, and as such may possibly have, according to the excavator, George Dales, a generic and stylistic relationship to the Mohenjo-daro so-called proto-Siva figures of the succeeding phase.13 These archaeological findings strongly indicate that it is not necessary to go outside of the prehistoric period for the meaning and development of the forms comprising the mitre on seal 420 and the related seals mentioned above. In fact, the horn and branch mitre is not particularly uncommon in the ancient world of the second millenium B.C. Such components form, for example, the mitres worn by gods on Mesopotamian cylinder seals dating to the Akkadian period (c. 2330?2180 B.C.).14 In the Mesopotamian context, this type of mitre is emblematic of divinity.15 Turning next to the posture of the figure on seal 420, opinions have divided themselves on whether or not the posture is as peculiarly yogic as Marshall believed. The posture has been seen by some investigators as a natural mode of sitting and therefore devoid of religious significance.16 For others it represents a yoga posture, and one writer even states that it attests the Yogilvara aspect of the god Siva.17 Probably the significance lies somewhere between these two views, as a survey of other seated figures on Indus seals shows. When other seated positions are compared to the posture on seal 420, they convey a greater ease of pose than the one on seal 420, whose stance is more formal, possibly even cultic. It is, however, the occurrence of kneeling person nages in conjunction with a figure in the yoga-like posture that suggests that the yogic posture may be a mark of divinity. Examples come from both Harappa and Mohenjo-daro.18 A most interesting example is seen on a Mohenjo-daro faience sealing which shows two kneeling "worshippers" flanking the "yogi" seated on a dais; behind each "worshipper" is a serpent.19 It may therefore be inferred that the "yoga" posture is emblematic of divinity, just as the plant and horn mitre is emblematic of a fertility figure. There is however nothing in the posture or the headdress which may conclu sively identify the figure as a proto-Siva. The four animals grouped around the figure have fostered the idea that the palupati concept, frequently associated with Rudra-Siva from the Vedas on wards, is already prefigured in the nature of the proto-Siva. This hypothesis cannot, upon closer inspection, be fruitfully pursued. It is critical to observe that the animals depicted on the seal are all wild animals, being the elephant, tiger, buffalo and rhinoceros. In surveying the term palupati in the Rig Veda and Atharva Veda, especially as it relates to</page><page sequence="6">82 UNHINGING &amp;VA FROM THE INDUS CIVILIZATION Rudra, it is to be concluded that a pasupati does not protect wild animals.20 Verses in the Atharva Veda make it quite clear that a pasupati protects the domestic animals upon which the agrarian economy and ritual depend.21 The Vedic evidence would therefore not support the interpretation that the animals on seal 420 are within the domain of a Pasupati. Indeed there is further textual evidence in the Rig Veda and Atharva Veda that Rudra injures precisely those creatures under the protection of a Pasupati.22 As the probability for a proto-Siva identification lessens, we may begin to ask ourselves who the figure on seal 420 may be. The posture, headdress and surrounding animals hint that this may be a fertility god whose power is as strong as that of wild animals, or whose domain of power includes them. Greater precision is attained by an analysis of the face. A close look at the facial characteristics reveals that the long and rather rectangular face is marked by a set of unusual features (Plate 1). The eyes are placed high and slant downward. The nose is prominent and elongated. A double-line contour, suggestive of a pendulous fold of skin, extends from the eyes around the face. The face appears to grow directly out of the shoulders. On either side of the face occur lateral projections consisting of a long pointed flap over horizontal strokes. It is these projections which Marshall considered to be the profiles of a three-headed proto-Siva. However, the projections as well as the entire group of features correlate well with archaeological remains recently found within the Indus context itself. Again from the Harappan period at Kalibangan comes evidence which clarifies the seal's iconography. A terracotta bull, very similar to the typical Mohenjo daro bull figurines, is of interest on account of the way its dewlap is depicted.23 The folds of skin hanging loose below the neck of the Kalibangan bull are indicated by a series of wavy incised lines that closely resemble the lines which contour the face on seal 420. Does the face on seal 420 also have a dewlap? It is indeed likely, as quite a number of other bovine features have been subtly integrated into the face. The degree to which bovine features and proportions are integrated is best seen when the face on seal 420 is compared to several horned masks also from Mohenjo-daro.24 The masks are in the main anthropomorphic and theriomorphic. A certain type of mask however seems to fall between the two categories. That is, this type of mask is different from the set of human horned masks because it has a more animal-like look. However when compared to the masks of a typical Indus bull, certain human features and proportions can also be discerned. Apparently, this type of mask depicts a humanized bucranium whose features compare very well with those on the face of seal 420. Both show the vanishing brow, the small lozenge-shaped eyes, the snout-like nose and the slight indication of a dewlap. The face on seal 420 shows additional points of comparison with another humanized bucranium head painted on a vessel from Kot Diji, a site 25 miles</page><page sequence="7">UNHINGING SlVA FROM THE INDUS CIVILIZATION 83 northeast of Mohenjo-daro; the vessel comes from the site's pre-Harappan occupation deposits. The painted design shows a head adorned with huge stylized horns, the upward curving striated tips of which nearly touch. Within the curvature of each horn is a large six-petalled flower. "From the junction of the horns seems to 'hang' down an elongated human head, its chin and cheeks shown in black dots, the low forehead, and the upper part of the long drooping ears in solid black".25 Sankalia considers the design to represent a humanized bucranium head. He identifies the horns as those of a bull and considers the type as the direct predecessor of the figure on Mohenjo-daro seal No. 420. A compari son may also be ventured between the ears of the painted humanized bucranium and the flap-like projections on either side of the 420 face. To consider these projections as ears of the humanized bucranium is of course very suitable; however the significance of the extension below the ears remains unresolved. Even so, the weight of the evidence goes counter to Marshall's idea of a tri cephalic proto-Siva, wearing, in his pasupati aspect, an enigmatic headdress. Instead there emerges the manly face of a bucranium whose headdress distin guishes him as a fertility figure and whose human body is poised on a dais in convincing yogic fashion. The question whether he is a bull-man or a buffalo man is becoming resolved in favor of the latter. Based on the Balakot evidence noted above, and that cited by Hiltebeitel,26 it is more likely that the horns worn by the deity are those of a buffalo. Perhaps the Indus civilization will some day reveal the identity of this divine buffalo-man. For the moment only one thing seems clear to those who have studied and commented upon the seal in the last few years27 ? the figure can no longer be considered a 'proto-Siva'. Rather, as Stella Kramrisch has recently proposed in her book, The Presence of Siva, the figure, by whatever name it is called, represented in the Indus context "power". The bovine power is sym bolized by the horns; the yogic power is symbolized by the posture. Together they coalesce to convey the superior power possessed by this prehistoric deity.28 B. The so-called Lihga and Yoni stones from Indus centers (Plate II) Marshall's initial glossing of the dome-shaped pieces as linga-shzped stones has been virtually accepted ever since. As recently as 1979, Raymond Allchin, in a seminar paper on the legacy of the Indus civilization speaks of the presence of stone or terracotta "lihga" at sites such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa and Surkotada, and builds upon that supposition.29 But here too problems arise, as Sankalia may have suspected when several years ago he noted that the "lihgas" of Mohenjo-daro were found in streets and in drains and were not enshrined in rooms as one would expect sacred objects to be.30 Before outlining the problems, it may be well to describe the nature of these objects. Marshall distinguished two types.31 The first type separates the domed top from the base by a groove or ridge (Plate II, Nos. 2, 4, 5); the second type</page><page sequence="8">84 UNHINGING SlVA FROM THE INDUS CIVILIZATION shows no separation (Plate II, Nos. 1,3). The first type can measure between half an inch and a foot; the second type can also be very small, or can measure up to two or three feet. On the whole, the smaller ones much predominate over the larger ones. They are all, to some degree, conventionalized in shape; this is particularly true of the smaller ones which resemble a thimble. Some have a hole at the base and Marshall conjectured that it served to affix the lihga stone to the yoni base. It is clear however that Marshall was not very happy with the two types he was able to distinguish. He considered it unlikely that two different conventionalized forms should have been produced during the Mature Harappan period at a given site. He writes that he nevertheless chose to interpret the second, more abstract, shape as a phallic emblem, because its shape is so similar to the majority of phallic stones found in medieval and modern India. He illu strates his point with a photograph of a modern Siva-//%a such as can still be found in Indian bazaars, in his time and ours.32 It is certainly true that from the Gupta and post-Gupta periods onward, to the end of the medieval period and into modern times, the form of the Siva linga is predominantly an abstract and conventionlized form.33 For example, the lihga installed in the Siva temple assumes an uninterrupted silhouette, com posed of three parts which merge into each other. The fully developed tripartite lihgas have a circular upper part, an octagonal central portion and a square base which is usually hidden within the yorii-pitha.*4 There is also a successive reduction in size so that the later ones appear as "inconspicuous small lihga-s of thimble size".35 In essence, the lihgas from about the fifth or sixth centuries A.D. onward provide scant if any reference to the phallic form. However, this had not always been the case. Post-Gupta lihgas evolved from a very different type, and that is why problems arise. Unlike the later ones, the earliest lihgas are anatomically realistic, huge, and found mainly in those regions that, unlike the Indus civilization, are strongholds of the Vedic tradition. A brief survey of important pre-Gupta lihgas is most instructive.36 The earliest lihga, the Gudimallam lihga, is undoubtedly also the most realistic. It is housed in the Parasuramesvara Temple, District Chitoor in Andhra Pradesh. Discovered in 1903, it has recently received intense re-examination as a result of an excavation and conservation project undertaken by the South-Eastern Circle of the Archaeological Survey of India. The project entailed digging beneath the temple's garbhagrha and exposing the hidden part of the icon.37 The excavator, I. K. Sarma, would date the icon to the 2nd century B.C. A date of the 1st century A.D. has been recently proposed by von Mitterwallner in her careful stylistic analysis of the piece.33 Although these and other opinions regarding the date differ markedly, all acknowledge the Gudimallam lihga to be both the earliest and the least conventionalized form. The lihga stands 5' in height above the ground. The cylindrical shaft is l' thick. The nut is not an abstract dome, rather it is anatomically realistic. It projects considerably beyond the shaft and</page><page sequence="9">UNHINGING SlVA FROM THE INDUS CIVILIZATION 85 its edge is turned slightly upward. The raised ridge on the upper shaft enters the triangular portion of the nut. The seven-sided shaft is undivided for its entire length down to the square portion which fits ? without benefit of holes ? into the circular ring stones of varying diameters.38 In fact, the Gudimallam icon is the earliest lihga-pitha known to date. What is more, it is the earliest known Siva lihga which closely resembles a phallus. It is not within the scope of this paper to consider the other iconographic elements of the Gudimallam lihga. We should however not leave this icon with out observing the point first made by D. R. Bhandarkar, namely that the con nection between phallicism and Saivism had perhaps not then been definitely established, since the artist felt it necessary to carve the figure of Siva upon this huge lihga.39 Slightly later than the Gudimallam lihga, other realistic lihgas which I would date circa 1st century B.C., have been found. There is the free-standing plain lihga found at Mathura (U.P.) and now housed in the State Museum, Lucknow (SML No. HI).40 It features the projecting nut with a central fold and decorated with a wide band. The top is evenly rounded off. The shaft is cylindrical. The lihga measures 38.2" in height above ground, and is 10.2" in width. The lihga has a rectangular socle intended for insertion into the ground. There are no base holes here, or on any of the early lihgas described here. A similar lihga is depicted on a relief showing a scene of lihga worship. The relief comes from Mathura and is now found in the Government Museum of Mathura (No. 3625).41 The worshippers, fantastic composite creatures, approach the lihga, which corresponds in realism to the Gudimallam lihga, and of which, like the preceding free-standing Mathura lihga, a simple band decorates the nut. Another example, again from Mathura, belongs to the Philadelphia Museum of Art (No. 70.221.1).42 It is an ekamukha lihga, that is a lihga displaying one head of Siva upon the shaft. Noteworthy is the combination of the abstract, dome-shaped top of the glans, and the more realistic lower portion. The stone sculpture probably dates around the time of the Christian era and shows that tendencies towards con ventionalization are beginning to appear. Lihgas from the next phase (c. 1st?3rd century A.D.) illustrate further changes, though realism continues to dominate. As in the preceding phase, the main examples stem from a limited geographic area. There is a colossal (5' in height) Ekamukha Lihga from Aghapura (District Bharatpur, Rajasthan), a site close to Mathura's cultural climate in antiquity.43 It continues the same realism seen in the plain and ekamukha Mathura lihgas of the previous phase. From Mathura itself, come several lihgas. (i) A free-standing lihga measuring 2' 8" in height (Government Museum, Mathura No. 2885). (ii) A huge stone lihga attain ing a height of 6'6" (Government Museum, Mathura No. 15.652).44 It has a roughly-squared lower portion which was probably inserted into the yoni-pitha. The shaft rises from a floral base. The nut or glans is 2' across, and is decorated</page><page sequence="10">86 UNHINGING $IVA FROM THE INDUS CIVILIZATION with two thick jewelled bands which are joined together by a lotus medallion, (iii) Another large linga comes from Chauma (District Mathura); it has a lion, a jar, Irlmukha and a gana at the base.44 (iv) A plain linga set on an altar is depicted on a Mathura relief (Government Museum, Mathura No. 36.2661)45 showing foreign (i.e. Indo-Scythian) worshippers bringing garland offerings to the linga. All these free-standing lihgas appear to be quite large. All except the Chauma linga have the nut projecting beyond the shaft. Though the linga in worship nearly dispenses with the projection, it nevertheless differentiates the glans from the rest of the phallus by two distinctly incised curves meeting at a point and called the Brahmasutras. Thus the second phase in the evolution of the lihga-form begins the course leading to the later uninterrupted silhouette and unrealistic shape. These characteristics become dominant in the third phase, dating to the Gupta age,46 and are established by the fourth, the last phase comprising approximately the fifth century A.D. to the end of the medieval period.47 The first conclusion to be drawn from this quick survey is that the earlier the linga, the more realistic and larger its form. That is, the closer the time the linga approaches the prehistoric period, the less it looks like the cone shaped Indus objects. The second conclusion stems from the discreet geographical distribution of the early lingas. If the find-places of these lihgas are plotted on a historical map, then the region of all, except the Gudimallam linga, is precisely the area identified as Aryavarta ("the country of the Aryans") by the Mdnava Dharmaldstra.*8 Further, if we confine ourselves to examples in stone,49 the provenance narrows to a small group of urban centers around the Doab, having the Mathura region as centre. This region in the centuries around the Christian era was "the acknowledged standard bearer in the propagation of brahmanical life".50 The Mdnava Dharmasastra specifies that the tract in the Doab com prising the region around Delhi to Mathura, capital of the ancient Surasena, is designated as the country ofthe Brahmanical seers (brahmdrsidela; 11.19). On the other hand, in the entire region north of Mathura, extending north wards and northwestwards - into Sind, the Punjab, the Hindu Kush - to south ern Bactria and the Indo-Iranian borderlands, no representation of lingas are found in any medium during the early periods.51 To maintain that the Indus stones are the prototypes of the later Siva lingas one would need to explain not only their abstract shape vis-a-vis the realism of the early undisputed Siva-/z%fls, but also the absence of lihgas in the North for more than two millennia. Especially their absence in the North during the time of their presence in Aryavarta, a totally distinct culture, would need considerable explanation. This explanation would probably need to take into account the implications stemming from the site of Bhagwanpura in Eastern</page><page sequence="11">UNHINGING SlVA FROM THE INDUS CIVILIZATION 87 Punjab. This site shows stratigraphic connections between late Harappan pottery and Painted Grey Ware, the ware usually associated with the Aryans.52 Finally an important buttress for the lihga identification has also given way. I refer to the Mohenjo-daro chert or limestone ring stones, so often interpreted, as Marshall did, as the j&gt;om-rings associated with the lihga stones (Plate II, No. 6). When the archaeologist E. Mackay first described the 27 ring stones found in the HR area, he hesitatingly suggested their possible architectural use;53 in his later report, he clearly considers them as architectural stones, perhaps as parts of stone columns.54 The possibility for yet another function is introduced by George Dales in a forthcoming paper which discusses these stones. He reports that Dr. Michael Jansen, head of a German team making architectural studies at Mohenjo-daro, measured and studied all these ring stones in detail and feels that the rings may have been used in making astro nomical calculations.55 Dales correctly observes that if the stone objects, cones and rings, had cultic or religious functions within the Harappan religion, then one would expect that such stones would be found at all Harappan sites. But they are not. Dales does not consider the ring stones as yoni-rings and indeed concludes that "there is no archaeological evidence to support claims of special sexually oriented aspects of Harappan religion.56 The argument for Siva's origin in the Indus civilization has always rested mainly on the interpretation of the seal, and of the stones ? both the cones and the ring stones. The case presented here is that this argument should be dropped.

See John Allan, Catalogue of the coins of ancient India, London, 1936, 243, No. 19; PI. 36, No. 15. A humped bull faces the lihga on the reverse of the Arjunayana copper coin-type, 'variety b". See Allan, Catalogue, 121, PI. 14, No. 11.
