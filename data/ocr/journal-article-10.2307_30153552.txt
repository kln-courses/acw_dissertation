<plain_text><page sequence="1">Satyr at Play: Goethe's Satyros ERIC DENTON Wheaton College, Massachusetts In the summer of 1773, the young Goethe wrote a farce that bears an uncanny resemblance to satyr play, not least because the title character is a flamboyant satyr. While it is not my intention in this essay to enter a biographical zone that Joyce Carol Oates has appropriately called "pathog- raphy," it should also be noted that like satyr play, the origin of Goethe's farces has something to do with marriage rituals. In 1773, Goethe wrote under the anxiety and the influence of three weddings; his sister Cornelia, Herder, and Charlotte Buff and Kestner all married. In particular, Pater Brey has an occasional and public origin: it is written as a wedding present- a curious one, to be sure-and was performed for the Polterabend of Herder and Caroline Flachsland. Flachsland herself was a member of the initiated circle of friends and letter-writers among whom the farces were circulated and who became for them an implicit audience. Satyros is written in a similarly masque-like vein. In Hanswursts Hochzeit, this marriage clus- ter briefly crystallizes as explicit plot, only to shatter into fragments. Most notable for its scatological and pornographic dramatis personae, such fic- tionalized nuptial rites resemble nothing so much at times as a stag party. In Goethe's hands, pre-nuptial rites become anti-nuptial farces.' Given such a psychological constellation, it is perhaps less surprising that the plot of Satyros parallels so closely and specifically the rituals that stand behind Dionysian satyr play: the ceremonial rape and marriage of the wife of the high priest by Dionysos. It appears that the X6ec [the second day of the Anthesteria festival] culmi- nated in a ceremony in which the wife of the Archo Basileus, in association with a group of fourteen women, performed a secret sacrifice, saw something secret, and was given in sacred marriage to Dionysos.... It also seems likely that at the Anthesteria Dionysos was escorted to his sacred marriage by men dressed as satyrs, who although part of the public celebrations may have formed a distinct group or thiasos.2 Monatshefte, Vol. 88, No. 4, 1996 434 0026-9271/96/0004/0434 $01.50/0 c 1996 by The Board of Regents of The University of Wisconsin System</page><page sequence="2">Goethe's Satyros 435 In Goethe's "travesty" of this ritual, Eudora, the wife of the high priest Hermes, lures the satyr behind the altar, where the crowd will surprise them in flagrante delicto and finally recognize its god for what he is: an animal. In Satyros, the sacred marriage or sacred rape is interrupted; by way of farce, ritual becomes intrigue. Nevertheless, in a play precipitated by mar- riages and nuptials, under the influence of Hymen, as it were, Goethe pays much attention to eros, to seductions, and ultimately to (thwarted) acts of rape. Let me be quick to add: such ritual acts-literary, theatrical, socio- logical-are as much about the regularizing of norms as about "acting out," enactment, or even re-enactment. In this sense of literary "fertility rite," Goethe uses Satyros and his other farces to respond to sexual and nuptial anxieties in his own life: he privatizes the rituals that theater makes public. Goethe's "satyr-play-like"3 also bears a surprising resemblance to the play fragment Prometheus (and to the famous ode of the same name), so much so that Satyros has even been dubbed "a phony Prometheus."4 Goethe works on both plays in the summer of 1773; they share the same mythological source book: Benjamin Hederich's Griindliches Mytholo- gisches Lexikon.i In both plays, a mythological figure becomes the object of deification; both Prometheus and Satyros enter into an intimate rela- tionship with a young woman (Pandora; Psyche). Both plays have the con- struction (and deconstruction) of civilization as subject. Furthermore, the juxtaposition of satyr and hermit, as alternative points of view on nature in Goethe's farce, poses an essential "dialectic" within the farce itself. In Goethe's view, the satyr play provides "comic terror," not just "comic re- lief." And the cosmic terror that accompanies all these contrasts helps ex- plain what has puzzled most critics in their reading of Satyros: its existential and metaphysical anxieties, its self-parody, and an all-encompassing ambiv- alence.6 In his 1990 essay "Why Satyrs Are Good to Represent," Frangois Lissarrague suggests that satyr play is effective because it follows a simple recipe: "take one myth, add satyrs, observe the result."'7 With a wicked twist on Goethe's own "Parallelismus im Gegensatz,"8 Lissarrague argues that comedy results from a principle of "incongruity"; the satyr makes every- thing else in its vicinity seem out of place, especially myth and poetry. While the mechanics of contrast are the same as those the later Goethe pinpoints in Cyclops, the effect could hardly be more dissimilar: The presence of satyrs within the myth subverts tragedy by shattering its cohesiveness.... Satyric drama, by contrast [to tragedy], plays with culture by first distancing it and then reconstructing it through its antitypes, the sa- tyrs.9 This sounds more like the early Goethe's Satyros than the late Goethe's Euripides. To his conception of classical Greek culture, Goethe adds Saty-</page><page sequence="3">436 Denton ros, and what results is a comedy of reception. The hermit offers Satyros hospitality, which the satyr abuses by theft and desecration. Satyros repays Psyche's appreciation of his poetry by seducing her. Ultimately, das Volk, the inner chorus of the play, mistakes the satyr for the myth and deifies Satyros. This process of false deification mirrors that of the German literary public as a whole, which mistakes its own conception of Greek culture for the real thing. If the unwritten chapter in the German reception of Greek culture has to do with the appropriation of that culture as covert biography, then the early Goethe, after Winckelmann, is the major ghostwriter.10 In Lissarrague's terms, Goethe uses the incongruity of satyric cause and effect to create "a negative anthropology, an anthropology of laughter,"'' in which the satyr has the last laugh. In this essay, I wish to concentrate on issues of satyric appearance, of diet, of agon, and of the abuse of hospitality. First and foremost, there is, despite the title, an agon between the hermit and the satyr, which stands in for the larger agonistic struggle between Christian and classical cultures in this play. In their monologues, Satyros' songs and sermons, and in the her- mit's plea for his life, the two figures articulate competing philosophies of nature, which are particularly compelling due to their liminal relationship to it. There is also a persistent pattern of hospitality and its abuse through- out the play. The concept of xenia plays a crucial role in Greek culture (as evidenced in Homer's Odyssey) and in the satyr play, where satyrs prove to be flagrant abusers of hospitality. For a satyr, it is not far from abusing hospitality to acts of desecration: in Satyros, of altars, of conventions (sexual violation), and of entire cultures (cultural misrepresentation). Goethe's satyr has at least three distinctive features: physical appear- ance, mythic origins, and its comic function. Satyros' grotesque appearance advertises his overt sexuality. He comes with both a self-proclaimed and a literary ancestry and articulates his own sense of self in myth, which encom- passes his relationship to nature and his poetic aspirations. In his comic function, Satyros bears a resemblance to other comic figures in Goethe's works: Hanswurst and Mephistopheles. Curiously enough, the hermit makes no mention of the satyr's physical appearance. While eavesdropping, however, Arsinoe and Psyche comment specifically on that appearance. Psyche seems blinded by Satyros' poetry, even to the point of aestheticizing his otherness. Arsinoe, a realist at heart, notices his big ears: PSYCHE. Welch g6ttlich hohes Angesicht! ARSINOE. Siehst denn seine langen Ohren nicht? P. Wie glihend starck umher er schaut! A. Migt drum nicht seyn des Wunders Braut.'2 Psyche glimpses the daemonic and responds to it; she emphasizes the satyr's vision, his hypnotic eyes (gliihend), and his overall aura. Arsinoe persis-</page><page sequence="4">Goethe's Satyros 437 tently treats the satyr as a freak: "No way I want to be married to a thing like that." In a pre-emptive strike, Satyros himself draws attention to his ap- pearance. It comes as little surprise that he criticizes the appearance of human beings: their robes and Hermes' full beard.13 A more theoretical dismissal of clothing as an imprisoning convention follows soon afterwards. But at the outset, Satyros cleverly steals the issue of his own appearance by directly addressing it, deflecting any feelings of disgust (Ekel): Siehst an mein ungekimmtes Haar, Meine nackte Schultern, Brust und Lenden, Meine lange Nigel an den Hinden; Da ekelt dirs vielleicht dafiir? (221-24) In this self-mirroring, Satyros emphasizes his long, unkempt hair, his naked extremities, and his long fingernails, all ways in which he embodies the wildness of nature. In his Book of Imaginary Beings, Jorge Luis Borges (who should know) provides a generic description: "Satyrs were thickly covered with hair and had short horns, pointed ears, active eyes, and hooked noses."14 In Satyros, the girls' initial impression picks up on the ears and eyes. In Goethe's immediate reference, Benjamin Hederich's Griindliches Mythologisches Lexikon, satyri are described under "Bildung" as: Mannspersonen mit kleinen Ziegenhornern vorn am Kopfe, hatten auch der- gleichen Beine; und einen Schwanz, wie ein Pferdeschwanz, ob solcher gleich nicht eben so gar grol3 war. Dabey waren sie uiber und tiber rauch und r6th- lich, auch sonst im Gesichte lacherlich und schnakenhaft gebildet."5 All these sources agree that satyrs, unlike books, can definitely be judged by their covers. The theatrical persona of the satyr complicates the question of its appearance. The satyr's appearance corresponds at once to its multiple roles as actor, religious initiate, creature of nature, and demi-god: It seems that the ambiguity of belief about satyrs is associated with a similar ambiguity of satyrs in festival and ritual. On the one hand they are men and boys, dressed up for frolics at the festival; and on the other hand they are, within the thiasos, the attendants of the god and the initiated custodians of a solemn and secret tradition.16 In costume, actors wear "an ugly mask and the skin of a goat, panther, or deer over their naked bodies. Sometimes loin clothes with tails and an ar- tificial leather phallus of considerable size were also worn, with the total costume conveying the quality of a coarse, ugly rustic creature."'7 In its hairiness and its theatrically over-sized phallus, the appearance of the satyr immediately signals its "over-sexed" nature.</page><page sequence="5">438 Denton By the time he meets Psyche, Arsinoe, and Hermes, Satyros is already partially clothed, although it is his partial nudity that emphasizes his physi- cal attributes: "my naked shoulders, breast, and loins" (as the satyr himself stresses). When he first appears on stage and in the initial scenes with the hermit, Satyros is to be imagined nude. For that reason alone, Walther Kothe considered the play unsuitable for the stage: Satyros setzt sich Goethes Phantasie uiber Biuhnenforderungen hinweg. Der Szenenwechsel I. 1/2 unmiglich; ebenso Satyros' Erscheinung: er ist nackt.'8 That Goethe is aware of this dilemma, even turns it to his own theatrical advantage, is clear; he has Satyros steal the hermit's table-cloth in which to wrap himself: Kinnt ich nicht etwa brauchen was? Das Leinwand nu wir so ein Spas. Die Maidels laufen so vor mir; Ich denk ich binds so etwa fir. (114-17) Such a gesture is both an inside joke and an obscene one. "The girls run the other way," and the reason is clear. Satyros can cover up his phallus, but concealing its appearance does not change his behavior, as his subse- quent seduction of Psyche and the attempted rape of Eudora demonstrate. One should by no means minimize the phallic nature of this play. Goethe once remarked to Wieland that the roots of comedy lay in obscen- ities and allusions to sex, and he seems out to prove that point, prematurely, in Satyros: Goethe aiuferte Wieland gegentiber einmal prinzipiell, daB die ursprtingliche einzige vis comica in den "Obsconititen und Anspielungen auf Geschlechts- verhiltnisse" liege und von der Komodie gar nicht entfernt gedacht werden kinne.19 Phallic comedy is central to both the genres to which Satyros belongs, satyr play and carnival farce: Wie die griechische Komidie, so entwickelte sich also auch das deutsche Lustspiel in einer Atmosphire befreiter Treibhaftigkeit, mag diese nun-wie in Griechenland-stirker kultisch oder-wie in den deutschen Stidten des ausgehenden Mittelalters-eher sozial geprigt gewesen sein.20 Catholy is emphatic that sexuality is the dominating theme of the early Fastnachtspiele, where the phallus is always ready and willing.21 As a figure, it would seem impossible to emasculate the satyr, which maintains a per- sistent identity as "a symbol of mischief, buffoonery, cowardliness, drunk- enness, phallicism, fertility, lasciviousness, lechery, and irrationality."22 Fi- nally, if Goethe needed scholarly legitimization for a phallic depiction of Satyros, he would have found it close at hand in the etymologies in He-</page><page sequence="6">Goethe's Satyros 439 derich's Mythologisches Lexicon. Under "Namen," Hederich lists four pos- sible origins for the name satyr: Diese vermeynten Gotter haben ihren Namen, nach einigen, von dem do- rischen Worte sdtas, welches so viel, als schwirmen und spielen hei.t.... Nach andern kommt er von sdtthae, das miinnliche Glied, weil sie sehr un- ziuchtige und geile Korper waren ... nach den dritten von sathar, verborgen sein, weil sie sich meist in Hohlen und dergleichen Schlupflochern aufheilten ... und nach den vierten von Sair, ein Bock, weil sie diesem an Gestalt sehr gleich kamen.23 All four of these etymologies come into play in Satyros, but "the male member" motivates the unspoken gesture and Satyros' desires throughout this farce. Satyros not only looks grotesque, he also acts the part. Many of his actions in the play can be labeled along categories of the comic and gro- tesque: diet, violence and desecration, impersonation, sexuality. He substi- tutes for communion a diet of chestnuts. He impersonates a god, or at least allows himself to be worshipped as one. He desecrates altars. His seduction of Psyche is a good example of the grotesque incongruity of language and action prevalent throughout the play. Satyros seems an inappropriate mouthpiece for what he says; his appearance and actions contradict his sublime rhetoric, his poetry, and his charisma. His attempted rape of Eudora is grotesque because of similar incongruities: it occurs behind the altar in full view of his worshippers, who become voyeurs. In fact, it is the point at which those worshipers go from participation (in the hermit's execution) to voyeurism (as a result of Eudora's intrigue) that defines, in religious terms, the grotesque. Nothing, however, is more archetypically grotesque than Sa- tyros' entrance into the world of this play. Satyros falls onto stage, head-over-heels. In doing so, he mimics two grotesque actions: that of the clown and that of childbirth. A Bakhtian anthropology now becomes dramaturgy with a vengeance: The entire logic of the grotesque movements of the body (still to be seen in shows and circus performances) is of topographical nature. The system of these movements is oriented in relation to the upper and lower stratum; it is a system of flights and descents into the lower depths....24 In his fall into humanity, Satyros has in effect performed a cartwheel, "which by the continual rotation of the upper and lower parts suggests the rotation of earth and sky. This is manifested in other movements of the clown: the buttocks persistently trying to take the place of the head and the head that of the buttocks."25 Such mythological prat-falls are not without physical danger. In turning himself "inside out and upside down," Satyros has broken a leg: "Ich bin gestiirzt-entzwey mein Bein!" (62). This infor- mation is preceded by a primal scream, which mimics childbirth: "U! U!</page><page sequence="7">440 Denton Au! Au! Weh! Weh! Ai! Ai!" (56). It also mocks the motif of fallen angels: "Amilsant ist Goethes Einfuihrung des 'gefallenen Engels'; man kann sich ihn direkt vom Himmel herabgestirzt denken."26 Like so much of bur- lesque, carnivalesque pantomime, Satyros' "fall" marks a mythological and dramaturgical rite of passage. The low-grade anxiety that such cosmic gyrations display throughout Goethe's early work is particularly sexual in nature. Both Psyche in Satyros and Pandora in Prometheus suffer from an inchoate erotic terror that both Satyros and Prometheus articulate in a way that escalates, rather than as- suages it. In Prometheus, sexual awakening (if it is indeed that) leads im- mediately to mortal (not moral) thoughts, in short, death: ... Und all die Sinne dir vergehn, Und du dir zu vergehen scheinst Und sinckst, und alles um dich Her Versinckt in Nacht, und du, in inner eigenem Gefiihle, Umfassest eine Welt: Dann stirbt der Mensch.27 With his interest lying not in pedagogy, but in seduction, Satyros stops that escalation short, with a kiss: Es war so ahndungsvoll und schwer, Dann wieder ingstlich arm und leer; Es trieb dich oft in Wald hinaus, Dort Bangigkeit zu atmen aus; Und wollustsvolle Trinen flossen, Und heilge Schmerzen sich ergossen, Und um dich Himmel und Erde verging. (203-08) Unlike Prometheus, who reserves his cultic wisdom for a private audience, Satyros later exposes his cosmology of death and regeneration to a larger public: the adoring masses. In this sense, Satyros is a demonstration of the dangers of publicizing private feelings and hermetic knowledge. Yet true to his nature, the satyr persists in reducing the cosmic to the erotic. It is with irony that he now completes the seduction; he creates passion in Psyche by displacing his own, which is generic. Satyros has de- scribed his initial mood in the proto-Romantic extremes of ennui, humidity, coolness: Ich bin doch mild; 's ist hillisch schwiil. Der Brunn, der ist so schatten-kiihl. (120-21)28 His song assuages that feeling by articulating it, in poetry that is indistin- guishable from Goethe's own lyrics: Satyros singt. Dein Leben Herz, fiir wen ergliiht Dein Adler Auge was ersieht</page><page sequence="8">Goethe's Satyros 441 Dir huldigt rings um die Natur S' ist alles dein; Und bist allein! Bist elend nur. (134-39) One also gets a sense of a rapid modulation in values from Goethe's unusual compacting and compounding of nouns. When first alone with Psyche, he addresses her in the moral terms of lux et veritas, with the compound "vir- tue-truth-light": Von dir gliinzt Tugend-Wahrheits Licht Wie aus eines Engels Angesicht. (192-93) After embracing her, he turns up the rhetorical heat, emphasizing the sen- sual sensations of "love-heaven-bliss-warm," adding an adjective to the ex- tended expression: er umfasst sie Hab alles Gltick der Welt im Arm So Liebes-Himmel-Wonne warm! (196-97) The irony of Satyros' seduction is that he now places those same "burning" feelings into Psyche's own heart, much the same way he puts words in the mouths of the crowd that will later worship him. Like Prometheus with Pandora, he lays the groundwork in Psyche's soul for the same sexual de- sires he intends subsequently to take advantage of. The secret of Satyros' Casanova-like success is that he creates sexual anxieties, then exploits them; note, again, the choice of words: full of antic- ipation, heavy, anxious, empty. After Satyros kisses Psyche, "passionately," she responds with the same rhetoric of extremes: Er kiif3t sie miichtig. PSYCHE. LaB ab-mich schauderts-Wonn und Weh- O Gott im Himmel ich vergeh-(212-13) Vergehen is the response the satyr inspires throughout the play. As an act, the word has many meanings: in context, to lose one's senses-to faint. It is no coincidence, however, that a primary meaning is offense or crime, often a sexual one (violation). To be sure, there is a sense of just this es- calation of violence even in Goethe's literary models. Satyros begins his courtship in the sentimental vein of Gessner, continues in the sensual, anac- reontic mode of Wieland, only to end in the raw physicality of beauty and the beast. Based on response, the satyr is always a potential rapist. Vergehen represents the repressed sexuality with which two genres, both satyr play and pastoral, flirt.29 To the extent that the cosmic fear-and cosmic lust-evident in Pro- metheus and Satyros parallels Goethe's own, very real anxieties, the farce</page><page sequence="9">442 Denton provides a remedy: both in the writing and in any response to it. Unlike the crowd in Satyros, which reverts to idolatry and voluntarily re-enters the prison of religious oppression, Goethe's response- and the response of any implied audience-is to laugh. Goethe conquers his fears by making him- self and others break out into cosmic laughter: "In the sphere of imagery cosmic fear (as any other fear) is defeated by laughter."30 Within the play, Eudora turns the deification of the satyr into ridicule by correcting the vision of the spectators; she teaches them to see the satyr as an animal, where they had earlier perceived him to be a god. Outside the play, not just the satyr, but this miniature society and the very process of deification is the object of laughter. Goethe's audience laughs at itself without realizing it. In this way, the play is a microcosm. In a pattern of accepting appearances at face-value, the hermit poses no questions concerning Satyros' origins. Far from being surprised, he takes the presence of the satyr for granted. On the mythological edge between civilization and nature-and in the pages of Aesop's Fables and in Hans Sachs's Schwiinke-, such encounters are the rule, not the exception. Arsinoe and Psyche, by contrast, are extremely curious concerning Satyros' background. Psyche immediately poses the question: "Wie kommst du an den Brunnen hier?" (154). Satyros answers enigmatically: Woher ich komm kann ich nicht sagen Wohin ich gehe miist ihr nicht fragen. (155-56) The satyr has no origins, is ignorant of them, or suppresses them. As always with Satyros, there is a little bit of truth in each of these possibilities. The figure emerges from a cultural vacuum: a no-man's land of Dionysian reli- gious rituals. At the same time, the satyr is a figure blessed with a lack of self-awareness. Living in the eternal present, it is a profoundly ahistorical creature; its omnipresent manifestations in art and literature testify to that. Finally, the figure is not above making ingenious use of misinformation. Satyros encourages Psyche to mistake eroticism for romantic love. He does nothing to discourage the crowd from mistakenly deifying him. He allows humanity to misinterpret his divine aspects for a larger divinity (much as in Faust, where Mephistopheles encourages a misidentification of himself with a larger evil). Satyros shares the mystery of origin with Prometheus, who severs his common origin with the gods by calling it into question: Was Vater! Mutter! Weissest du, woher du kommst? (8-9)31 Pressed by Psyche, Satyros confesses to being an orphan, a creature without a pedigree:</page><page sequence="10">Goethe's Satyros 443 PSYCHE. O lieber Fremdling! sag uns recht, Welch ist dein Nam und dein Geschlecht? SATYROS. Meine Mutter hab ich nicht gekandt, Hat niemand mir mein'n Vater genannt. (159-62) Severing oneself from parentage-or lacking a parent in the first place- seems to be a pre-condition in the private mythology Goethe creates. In reading theater autobiographically, Fischer-Lamberg sees these parallels in myth-building as representative of Goethe's troubled relationship with his own parents: "Das Verhiltnis zu den Eltern, besonders zum Vater, scheint in dieser Zeit an Spannung zugenommen zu haben."32 It is characteristic of these two works that what requires a violent act of separation in Prometheus (the mythological figure's defiance of its own origins, the gods) is an ef- fortless, "done deal" in Satyros. The rest of Satyros' answer provides a generic marker of the satyr figure itself: Im fernen Land hoch Berg und Wald Ist mein beliebter Aufenthalt. Hab' weit und breit meinen Weg genommen. (164-65) Goethe's satyr is exotic (if nondescript) in origin, at home in mountains or in the forest, and is a nomadic wanderer. In extra-textual terms, the non- plussed reaction of the hermit and the curiosity of the girls parallel Goethe's immediate sources for the satyr: Aesop's Fables and the pastoral satyr tra- dition. I have already suggested that the tradition of the figure is distinct from that of the genre. While like any iconographical figure, the satyr is capable of transmitting information from a dead, almost entirely lost genre, the figure accumulates other, extraneous characteristics along the way. Goethe reinvents the genre of satyr play by way of the figure. One of the two main transmitters of the satyr figure is Aesop's Fables, which reached yet another wave of popularity in the early eighteenth cen- tury. These fables serve as a kind of literary bestiary, in which the figure is to some degree domesticated and turned into folk tale; in them, the satyr becomes a simpleton: "nach der Art gutherziger Heinzelminnchen oder Kobolde."33 In the fable directly cited by Goethe, "A Man and a Satyr," a satyr rebukes a hermit for inconsistency. The hermit blows on his hands to warm them and on porridge to cool it: A great intimacy was struck up between a Man and a Satyr.... Nay, says the Satyr, if you have got a trick for blowing hot and cold out of the same mouth, I have done with you.34 Like so many of the fables, this one has a moral: "There is no conversing with any man who carries two faces under one hood." Richardson notes</page><page sequence="11">444 Denton the "simplicity of the satyr," which allows him, however, to unmask a "dis- sembler." Hans Sachs depicts the same material in his "Fabel von dem Waldt- bruder mit dem Satyrus." Not just the name, Sachs' description of a satyr is of interest here: Diesen [einen Waldbruder] ein Satyrus ersach Das gar kleine waldtmannlein sein, Die haben geissfuss all gemein Und kleine hornlein an der stiern, Die wonen auffs birges refiern.35 Goethe has the motif of "hand-warming" from either or both sources, but he turns the moral in both to reductionism: SATYROS. Was blast ihr da so in die Hand? EINSIEDLER. Seyd ihr nicht mit der Kunst bekanndt? Ich hauch die Fingerspitzen warm. SATYROS. Ihr seyd doch auch verteufelt arm. (82-84) No longer a "forked-tongue" moral (Sachs himself uses the phrase "deiner zwyfachen zungen"), Goethe gives it a twist of realism and uses it as a derogatory comment on the hermit's impoverished life-style. This stylistic "footnote" provides us with an opportunity to examine Goethe's art of literary appropriation. Here he notes the detail, but, in taking it out of context, ignores the moral. More importantly, in what seems a joke of reception, he completely reverses the larger scenario in Hans Sachs's fable, where the satyr discovers the hermit freezing in the snow, carries him to his hut, and revives him with wine: Derhalb eylt er im zu von verrn Und fihrt im auss dem schne hinein In die elenden hitten sein, Nach dem so bracht er ihm besonder Ein kopff mit siedig-heisen wein, Das er die innern glieder sein Auch mit dem wein erwermen solt.36 Compare this with Goethe's revision, in which the hermit carries the injured satyr to his hut and offers him, instead of wine-milk and bread, which the satyr rejects disdainfully. Goethe notes a detail-the blowing on hands- and cites it, as if to legitimize his retelling, yet without its implications. He depicts a scene, then reverses the roles. In Sachs's version, the satyr provides the hospitality; in Goethe's version, the hermit returns it, after a fashion. Having borrowed this scenario, Goethe does two things with it. To all appearances, the moral has been omitted, but Goethe has in actuality</page><page sequence="12">Goethe's Satyros 445 shifted it to a different plane. In the satyr play, the satyr's role is to observe and to comment on something unique. Sometimes this something is trivial, like the custom of blowing on one's hands; sometimes it represents a major cultural advancement, like the Promethean gift of fire or the Dionysian gift of wine: The satyrs belong to the wild, and to the very point indeed at which culture is created out of nature: when wine is for the first time ever extracted by a god from the grapes, or the sound of the lyre from a dead tortoise, they are there as the first to enjoy the invention. This position gives them a special perspective on mankind.3 Goethe takes this satyric propensity to critique humanity from the outside and turns it into the massive attack Satyros makes on human conventions later in the play. The seed of this critique is to be found in Sachs's satyr complaint concerning "forked tongues" and his expulsion of the hermit: Darumb raum mir mein hiitten baldt Und disen grossen waldt gemein Und komb auch nimmermehr darein! Du machest uns woll alle yrr Mit deiner zwyfachen zungen geschirr. Derhalen bistu nicht zu leyden, Sonder zu vertreiben und meyden.38 Yet in Satyros, it is the hermit who unmasks the hypocrisy ("Heuchley," Sachs's word) of the crowd, and although it is the satyr who is expelled for it, its critique goes unanswered. Secondly, Aesop's scenario and the tradition that follows it occasion Goethe's juxtaposition of the hermit and satyr as alternative positions on nature. Without this debate, the detour to the satyr by way of the hermit makes little sense. Goethe reactivates the tension between the two figures that is rendered harmless or given a simplistic, moral meaning in the orig- inal. Without fleshing out the positions ideologically, Goethe enacts an agon between Christian and pagan cultures. Where he does present argumenta- tive positions, these fall along the lines of competing views of nature: hi- erarchy vs. process; alchemical knowledge vs. intuitive knowledge. Throughout Goethe's work, a configuration of pairing and doubling is evident: Faust and Mephisto are only the most prominent of Goethe's odd couples. In Satyros, Goethe pairs a hermit with a satyr: one would have thought that either figure would suffice, and that in any case, as figures, the satyr and the hermit would be mutually exclusive. Yet Goethe is obviously interested in both figures. While the satyr steals the show, the hermit-with the added help of Eudora's intrigue-wins the rhetorical argument. An outsider figure himself, the hermit mediates for the more extreme position in regard to nature. Yet both satyr and hermit inhabit the same borderland,</page><page sequence="13">446 Denton which lies on the edge between nature and civilization. In terms of civili- zation, however, they represent entirely different directions and reasons for flight. In a sense, these two "outsiders" are heading in opposite directions: one emerging from nature, the other fleeing civilization. The hermit retreats from society; in its attraction to the figure of the satyr, society retreats from itself. The hermit impinges on society by his absence; the satyr, by its pres- ence. In examining situations of isolation, withdrawal from society, and communion with nature, Goethe presents us two with two possible lifestyles. The satyr lives in unity with nature; in fact, he embodies it. The hermit lives in nature, separate from it, yet in intense observation of it. The relationship of the satyr to nature is inaccessible and has undesirable consequences for anyone attempting to imitate it; the effect the satyr has on humanity is disastrous.39 In the hermit, Goethe provides an alternative existence that is possible for human beings while leaving society undisrupted: not to be the chaos that is nature, but simply to observe it close up. While we may not care what Oedipus, Prometheus, or Faust had for breakfast, Satyros' dietary needs-diet as nourishment and parody of re- ligious ritual-are of immense importance in Satyros.40 Both grotesque comedy and satyr play stress food and the hunger for it, and Goethe follows this lead with almost unconscious assiduity, so insistent is the formal im- printing. For example, the archetypal satyr play, Euripides' Cyclops, depicts the anthropology of food in a way that exaggerates it to the point of can- nibalism: Kyklops does not merely reenact an exciting tale from Homer's Odyssey. It represents to the audience (and for the audience) a series of proper and deviant social relationships: the manner in which food is eaten or goods are exchanged sets up a pair of significant boundary lines, one separating proper human society from the undisciplined chorus of always-erect wild men who behave in (merely) unconventional ways, another separating those two forms of humanity from their monstrous, sacrilegious, and antisocial enemy.41 In Satyros, these boundary lines are drawn along lines of the diets of hermit and satyr, and of differences between diet and religious ritual.42 Let us begin by using the gargantuan diet of the cyclops in Euripides as a guideline. In David Konstan's analysis, Polyphemos enjoys a diet of dairy products, wild game, and human flesh.... He does not, however, eat satyrs. The reason he gives is that they would kill him with their dancing if they ever got inside his belly, an amusing allusion both to their Dionysian antics and to their function as chorus.43 In Satyros, the demands of the satyr are similar, if well this side of canni- balism. Satyros' immediate request is for food: wine and fruit (69). When</page><page sequence="14">Goethe's Satyros 447 rebuffed with milk and bread (70), he fondly recalls fresh goat's milk straight from the source: Da droben im G'birg die wilden Ziegen, Wenn ich eine bey'n Hornern thu kriegen, FaI3 mit dem Maul ihre vollen Zizen, Thu mir mit Macht die Gurgel bespritzen, Das ist bey Gott ein ander Wesen. (76-80) When the hermit goes in search of better provisions, Satyros once again wistfully recalls his normal regimen of wine, buttermilk, and cheese (100- 01). He later refers to his authority over wild game, birds, fruit, and fish (171-72); it is not clear if this role as fertility god includes sampling the wares. But the culinary agon between satyr and hermit is clearly drawn along these lines: bread and water vs. wine and cheese. While it is not absolutely clear that Satyros is a vegetarian, what is clear is that vegetarianism- eating chestnuts- is the main religious ritual he establishes following his deification.44 Both visually and conceptually, the dietary motif becomes the fundamental joke upon which this satyr play relies. As the epitome and epiphany of a natural order, it deflates Satyros' first Dionysian hymn to nature at the height of his enthusiasm: SATYROS. Der Baum wird zum Zelte, Zum Teppich das Gras, Und rohe Castanien Ein herrlicher FraB. (174-75) As a choral response, juxtaposed against the highest values, it is the extreme example of rhetorical incongruity, which thereby negates those values: Rohe Castanien! Jupiters Sohn! Rohe Castanien! Unser die Welt! (280; 284) The stage directions depict the comic tableau that immediately results from acting on this new dietary restriction. In a process of de-anthropomorphism, a descent of the evolutionary ladder, the crowd sits around like "squirrels," gnawing on chestnuts: Satyros, Hermes, Psyche, Arsinoe, das Volk sitzen in einem Kreise alle gekauert wie die Eichhorngen, haben Castanien in den Hiinden und nagen dran. (Act 4) Finally, diet provides one of two punch lines for the entire play; in an aside, Hermes admits to suffering from religious indigestion: HERMES fir sich. Sackerment ich habe schon Von der neuen Religion Eine verfluchte Indigestion. (285-87)</page><page sequence="15">448 Denton In a brilliantly grotesque mixed metaphor, Goethe criticizes religious en- thusiasm and cult-building by way of bodily malfunctions. I want to point out, however cautiously, that a visible act of blasphemy takes place in the depiction of this ritual as well. It is difficult to view this act of communion, no matter how parodic in intent, and not be reminded of the Christian ritual of transubstantiation and Eucharist. In a satyr play, the visual is not just figurative, even (especially) when at play. Konstan points this out in comparing Bacchus and wine: To be sure, the metonymy by which Bakkhos stood for wine was so common that it was usually, no doubt, semantically inert, although we must not forget that it was no mere metaphor, but rested, like the doctrine of wine and wafer in Catholicism, on beliefs in consubstantiality.45 The hint of blasphemy in communal ritual would also fit into a larger pattern of sacrilege and desecration of altars, which I will approach by way of di- gression: the abuse of hospitality. I have yet to discuss one more ritual practice, which has connections to diet only tangentially. As the figurative gallows reminds us in Die Mit- schuldigen, and the stage-scenery gallows in Jahrmarktsfest zu Plunders- weilern, the threat of execution looms behind Satyros. For his perceived blasphemy, the hermit is to be sacrificed, and this sacrifice is described, if symbolically, in "cannibalistic" terms. Hermes speaks of the "bloody sac- rifice" to come (353). In its sacrificial chorus, the crowd promises its idol the "smell" of the sacrifice: "Sieh herab, du wirst gerochen" (414). The hermit is potentially a dish fit for the gods: his "Gericht" (= judgment) becomes the last item (= dish) on Satyros' menu. Konstan argues that the anthropology of diet, as depicted in satyr play, is regulated by norms: in this case, the norm of hospitality. Much of Greek literature revolves around xenia, hospitality, and its abuse. We might call xenia the leitmotif of the Odyssey; it is the underlying code in Cyclops: In this morally polarized universe the standard device for distinguishing sym- pathetic and unsympathetic characters is hospitality. We are shown in almost every scene of the epic either instances of good hospitality or of hospitality abused by either guest or host, and hospitality serves as a moral litmus be- cause with rare exceptions (notably Circes) how a newly-introduced character acquits himself in the guest-friend relationship prefigures his function as sym- pathetic or unsympathetic character in the epic as a whole. Both the promi- nence of hospitality and its use as a moral yardstick anticipate its similar function in satyr plays.46 This concept and the literary structures in which it is encoded would have been familiar to Goethe from his reading of Homer, Aesop, and of Hans Sachs. It plays an important role in Euripides' Alcestis, the proper reception of which is very much on Goethe's mind at the time.47 Both Goethe's life</page><page sequence="16">Goethe's Satyros 449 and work revolve around issues of hospitality. His biography is notable for his own abuse of hospitality: in Sesenheim and, in particular, in Wetzlar.48 In poems like "Der Wanderer," the poet is constantly defining and redefin- ing the poetological boundaries of hospitality. Satyros abuses hospitality throughout the play. After the hermit car- ries him on his back to the refuge of his hut, he returns this kindness with insults, ridiculing the hermit's austere lifestyle. He subsequently vandalizes and robs the hut. Admired by Arsinoe and Psyche, he takes advantage of their confidence and seduces Psyche. Offered collegiality by the high priest Hermes, he usurps his altar, subverts his religion, and threatens to rape his wife. Far from having failed as a host, the hermit has his generosity taken advantage of; it almost costs him his life. In fact, society as a whole can be faulted for its over-generosity. It treats the stranger-in this case, a satyr- not as a guest, but as a god. Satyros even manages to turn his own exile into a gesture of abuse: he denies society the honor of his company. Having attempted to satisfy both the desire of humanity for knowledge and the unfulfilled sexual desires of women with no thanks for his efforts, he washes his hands, with a rhetorical flourish, of the lot of them: Ich thit euch Eseln eine Ehr an Wie mein Vater Jupiter vor mir getahn. Wollt eure dummen K6pf belehren Und eurem Weibern die Miicken wehren, Die ihr nicht gedenkt ihnen zu vertreiben. So mogt ihr denn im Dreck bekleiben. Ich zieh meine Hand von euch ab. (475-81) It being an honor to be insulted, toyed with, and abused by a satyr, this "son of Jupiter" banishes society and returns to the great outdoors. It is only one small conceptual step from abusing hospitality to abusing altars. In Satyros, we witness one act of sacrilege and desecration after an- other. In an act of vandalism, Satyros tears down the hermit's altar and throws away his crucifix: Seinen Herrgott will ich runter reisen Und drausen in den Giesbach schmeissen. (118-19) This act of iconoclasm has been preceded by Satyros' theological assessment of pietist Christianity: Da ist dem Kerl sein Platz zu beten. Es tut mir in den Augen weh, Wenn ich dem Narren seinen Herrgott seh. Wollt lieber eine Zwiebel anbeten, Bis mir die Trin in die Augen triten, Als offnen meines Herzens Schreien Einem Schnitzbildlein, Querholzelein. (103-09)</page><page sequence="17">450 Denton There are a number of points of interest here in this critique of Christianity, and it is not always possible to separate Goethe neatly from his ventrilo- quism, which moves so imperceptibly and fluidly from seriousness to par- ody. Satyros emphasizes the visual impact of the image, of the raw iconog- raphy of Christianity in general: material Christianity hurts his eyes. He criticizes the sentimentality of the pietist religious act and the sanctimo- niousness of a religion of tears. It is difficult not to see in these remarks a repudiation on Goethe's part of his own not-so-distant pietist leanings. Goethe, however, feels comfortable participating in secular forms of pie- tism-his sentimental circles of friends, the cult of feeling in his poetry and in Werther-while simultaneously rejecting it by way of parody.49 Satyros's iconoclasm does not consist merely of his desecration of the hermit's altar; it is consistent with his criticism of pietist cults of prayer and devotion. In a cult of feeling based on immediacy, evidence of which we see in the satyrs' desire for nature in the next act, the satyr mistrusts the mediation of the devotional object: its speaking to him. He conceptualizes his own heart as the organ of feeling, as a box or shrine, which he does not intend to open up for sculpted, "graven images." The sing-song, diminutive -lein makes his comic point: "Schnitzbildlein"; "Querholzelein." In the mid- dle of all the comedy, what Satyros rejects here is mediated religious feeling. The next act finds him in unmediated communion with nature. For visual inspiration, which he physically rejects here, he substitutes song-lyric po- etry-, which he both hears in nature and responds to by creating it himself. Satyros becomes both subject and object of his own religion. Satyros practices solipsism, not religious fraud or pretension. Most critics overlook the fact that he does not claim to be God; in an egotistically tautological manner, he merely claims to be himself: "Denn Gott ist Gott, und ich bin ich" (111). The satyr can afford to treat matters of divinity trivially, even flippantly. Despite its complicated etymology, the figure of the satyr is in this play the perfect counterpoint to Christianity -and to the figure of Prometheus, for that matter-because it does not suffer from re- ligious anxiety. The satyr is the object of its own religion, and, therefore, it does not surprise him when others worship him in the same way he worships himself. Unlike Prometheus, the satyr does not experience the anxiety of penis envy; its genius, unlike that of Sturm und Drang poets, is not threat- ened by competition with other creators, either divine or literary.50 Satyros' rejection of the visual image does not mean that Goethe as playwright rejects the tableau. On the contrary: as indicated by the stage directions, the play is built on a series of tableaux, still-lifes, and emblematic, relief-like scenes. Some of these have to do with Goethe's sources; it is hard to imagine that Goethe's Aesop did not come complete with an emblem of the satyr and the hermit, the latter warming his hands by blowing on them.5 Many of Goethe's stage directions set the stage and made a dramatic visual</page><page sequence="18">Goethe's Satyros 451 impact. But in all of his farces, there is a sense that he is making statements that can only be made theatrically and in theatrical terms. These neither warrant nor require, indeed hardly brook explication or commentary. This is not a play that invites identification with the characters, and what the audience sees are primarily spectacles and spectacular actions. In this the- atrical language of action, the main thing any audience sees in Satyros is an act of desecration: a crucifix being ripped down and tossed away like gar- bage. This is a powerfully psychological, intellectual, ritualistic act on the part of the playwright. It has to be read in the same way as Goethe's public read-and was encouraged to read-the ode "Prometheus": as a rejection of Christianity and an admission of atheism.52 In the context of the Spinoza debates, this is how Lessing chose to read it and in the same style; he let the poem speak for itself: Die orthodoxen Begriffe von der Gottheit sind nicht mehr fir mich; ich kann sie nicht genieBen. 'en kai pan! Ich weil3 nichts anders. Dahin geht auch dieses Gedicht; und ich muB bekennen, es gefaillt mir sehr.53 Similarly, Satyros' sacrilege says what Goethe could not say openly, what he was not yet ready to admit to himself privately, yet says it more dra- matically and eloquently than any confession. "Goethe had founded his own sense of identity by dethroning the divine Christ";54 in tearing down the crucifix, Goethe throws down the gauntlet to religion in this play. In a larger sense, the very deification of Satyros is an act of sacrilege, which leads to a chaos of actions along these lines. The crowd presses for the sacrifice of the hermit, as a result of his perceived blasphemy. He at least sees Satyros for what he is-an animal, and one with bad manners at that: "Du ungezogen schaindlich Tier! ... Du hinkender Teufel!" (333; 337). Another tableau shows how Satyros' deification violates the altar in reli- gious and comic incongruity: "Satyros sitzt ernst wild auf dem Altar" (stage directions: Act 5). In fact, it is Satyros' pattern of violating altars that leaves him vulnerable to Eudora's intrigue. Leaving the crowd to its sacrificial execution of the hermit, he retreats behind the altar, to the "Holy of Hol- ies," where he intends to consummate his relationship with Eudora. To cover his tracks, he even forbids his worshipers to enter the very sanctuary he himself intends to violate: Ich geh ins Heiligtum hinein; Und keiner soil sich unterstehn, Bei Lebensstraf, mir nachzugehen. (425-27) When Eudora's screams draw her husband and the crowd behind the altar, we witness the revelatory unmasking and unveiling: Eudora defending her- self against the embraces of a satyr, not a god. Yet once again, there are many layers of meaning here: some religious, some literary, some theatrical. In the iconic, theatrical sense, Goethe has</page><page sequence="19">452 Denton ripped down an altar. The act itself is dramatic enough: on the Greek stage, that altar and the holy place it represents would be inviolable. What hap- pens there could be at the very most narrated, yet never made visible.5 There is simultaneously an oblique, atheistic meaning: behind the altar is empty space, filled only by human beings and the deities they create. Fur- thermore, psychologically speaking, what an audience sees as occupying the "Holy of Holies" are sexual desires and aggressions. Behind sentimental, pietist belief lie sublimated sexual desires. It might be argued that comic terror has gone underground in the Enlightenment, which, on the surface, has dealt with many of the sources of that terror. It manifests itself in psy- chology, in the melancholy and hysteria that colors the age, in the "testic- ular" heart of sentimentality, and in a low-grade anxiety that especially haunts even Goethe's work. Any perspective audience would be hard pressed not to agree with Lichtenberg's conclusion concerning feeling, re- ligious or otherwise, in this age; it emits from "a heart with testicles": Wenn eine andere Generation den Menschen aus unsern empfindsamen Schriften restituieren sollte, so werden sie glauben es sei ein Herz mit Testi- keln gewesen. Ein Herz mit einem Hodensack.56 This sardonic moral to Satyros instructs an audience to mistrust the inter- mediaries of its religion, to dissect the overt, sexual motivations of its "false prophets," and to question the very act of deification itself-the process by which gods are created and feelings enshrined. As Lichtenberg tantalizingly suggests, "sentimentality" is really about, among other things, sexuality; the power of his comparison of heart and testicles is grotesque in its incongruity. Inversely, the satyr play is not really about the satisfaction of sexual desire. It postpones pleasure; it regulates sexual (courtship and marital) norms by threatening to violate them. In transgressing the limits of courtship, the satyr is actually defining the norms by delineating them. The satyr figure itself comes accompanied by a heavy baggage of excessive sexuality, and society, however implicitly, is faced with the problem of regulating that sexuality. We should remember that in Greek satyr play, the satyr exaggerates the norms of human beings according to a fixed rule: Satyrs' behavior is almost always an excess or a transgression, not only with regard to wine but in other areas as well.... Without multiplying examples, we may say that satyrs reproduce the "normal" values and activities of Greek males by transforming them, according to a set of rules that are never ran- dom.57 In Satyros, the exaggeration is of erotic feeling (and what to do about it). In the course of this play, Goethe poses a number of possible "sublima- tions," which the satyr then exposes and regulates by exaggeration. One of</page><page sequence="20">Goethe's Satyros 453 these is sublimation in religion; Satyros' violations of altar and priestesses indicates the danger of that. Another of these is sublimation in nature. Both the hermit's and the satyr's pantheism is highly erotically charged: the her- mit's by procreation and fertility; the satyr's by erotic love and seduction. Yet what is ultimately violated in Satyros is the figure of woman. Satyros seduces Psyche by way of poetic language. Eudora traps the satyr by virtue of a thwarted rape. I have already suggested that in this intrigue, the plot of Satyros both parallels and inverts the rituals that stand behind Dionysian satyr play: the ceremonial rape and marriage of the wife of the high priest by Dionysos. Goethe stops just short of that, but the satyr play does demand its sacrifice: the virgin ("Jungfrau") Psyche. Eudora is helpless to save Psy- che from becoming a willing victim: "Es geht doch wohl eine Jungfrau mit" (484). There is yet another, final level of cultural reference along which the discourse of Satyros moves: that of cultural reception. The early Goethe sees a danger in the unreflected return to ideas and artistic works of the past, in particular to that of classical Greece, and this danger is evident in his own efforts. In Satyros, Goethe performs an act of sacrilege and dese- cration in the guise of cultural reception. Simultaneous with his own recep- tion of the Greeks, Goethe is profoundly skeptical concerning the accessi- bility and reproduction of the past. This, as so often in Goethe, is the pow- erfully negative antithesis that accompanies and negates the thesis: in this case, Herder's thesis of the singularity and isolation of historically different periods and cultures. Moreover, Goethe's own sensibility is close enough to Rousseau's to necessitate Goethe defining himself against the latter. Goethe defines Rousseau by refining (through parody) his approach to the past. One does an injustice to the past by attempting, cult-like, to relive it, an attempt that inevitably becomes either intentional or unintentional par- ody. It seems a paradox, but Goethe's response to Wieland's Alcestis owes its fury to his indignation at Wieland's desecration and sacrilege of Greek culture. Martin Stern makes a very persuasive argument for this pattern of falsification and sacrilege in cultural reception: Zwar sind jene frtihen, als lebensvoller vorgestellten Zustande endgiiltig ver- loren; Versuche, sie wieder herzustellen, ftihren ins gesellschaftliche Chaos. Doch sollen die Zeugnisse jener Epochen der Menschkeit unangetastet blei- ben in ihrer "barbarischen" Urspriinglichkeit und Schdnheit. Aktualisierun- gensversuche, die sie verfilschen miissen, sind ein Sakrileg einer entarteten Zeit.58 Goethe makes this sense of Greek "otherness" a central issue in farces like Gotter Helden und Wieland, in which the Greek characters, mythological and otherwise, dwarf Wieland and speak a language almost incomprehen- sible to him (and to his contemporary German audience):</page><page sequence="21">454 Denton WIELAND. Ihr redet wie leute einer andern Welt, eine Sprache deren Worte ich vernehme, deren Sinn ich nicht fasse. ADMET. Wir reden Griechisch. Ist Euch das so unbegreiflich.59 In Satyros, both the language and the actions of the satyr remain incom- prehensible to the audience, both inside (das Volk) and outside the play, to an eighteenth-century German public. The satyr is out of place, and the cast and audience are divided up into those who recognize that anomaly and those who do not. Yet in its potential for blasphemy, cultural sacrilege be- comes profoundly comic. It confirms the picture's iconic status while si- multaneously defacing it. In Satyros, Goethe vacillates between the sacri- lege and the comedy of cultural reception. Much of the comedy, like that in Goethe's other farces, lies in incongruities of thought, type, feeling, and form. In Goethe's satyr play, we may subtly add one ingredient to Lissar- rague's original recipe: "take one cultural myth, add satyrs, observe the results." In Satyros, the result is a comedy of reception. Yet what is most original in Goethe's use of the satyr as a comic figure is its global aspect: his application of it to society-at-large. In his farces, Goethe applies satyric vices to Enlightenment virtues. He then observes the way in which satyric myths of individuality implode that society-the way in which comic principles short circuit and cause society to self-destruct. Traditionally, comedy divides along lines of participation or objectification of laughter: Mitlachen, laughing with, or Verlachen, laughing at.60 Goethe's comic principle seems best expressed as Oberlachen or Selbstlachen: isolated laughter, the laughter of isolation and self-isolation.61 Through comedy, Goethe distances himself-the playwright, misanthrope, Hanswurst, and satyr-from society. As comic figures, neither Hanswurst nor the satyr comes without bag- gage. In the past, the value of such figures lay in their lack of reality, in their fictitiousness and theatricality, and in their lack of origins or personal nar- ratives. By Goethe's time, Hanswurst is no longer just an intermediary of laughter; the figure is a response to aesthetic positions and considerations. The figure is typecast, and, like Gotz's "Er kann mich am Arsch lecken," expressly intended as a provocation. The satyr, something more of an enigma on the German stage, also carries with it considerable referential baggage: mythological, typological, and emblematic traditions, which some- times typecast, sometimes even pre-empt the comedy of the figure. Anticipating Mephisto, the satyr in Satyros functions as a spoiler (Spielverderber), who threatens the stability of the Enlightenment value system.62 Satyros refuses to play by the rules; in fact, his own rules are so powerful that they threaten to negate the rules of any society he enters. The only possible way to include his breaking of the rules-seduction, cri- tique of convention, the randomness of his actions-is to codify them and integrate him by deifying him. When this attempt at integration inevitably</page><page sequence="22">Goethe's Satyros 455 fails, by virtue of reducing this satyric cult to a travesty of religion, the only alternative is to unmask and exclude him. For those who can laugh, this is no problem, but for another kind of audience, Satyros proves radically dif- ferent from a Tartuffe. Despite being unmasked, the satyr-and what he represents -continues to exert an attraction on parts of the audience: those who continue to take the satyr seriously. Goethe brings to his comic figures a message and profundity that cannot be discounted by laughing at them. You can laugh at Herder, even Goethe himself, the figures they cut as hu- man beings, while continuing to respond to their writing with the utmost seriousness, even devotion. This is, of course, the same way Aristophanes- and Plato, despite himself-treats Socrates. Goethe ups the ante by making the spoiler (his satyr, Moliere's mis- anthrope) the other, with all the alien-ness and alienation that accompanies that concept. Yet even at the risk of absurdity, comedy continues to attempt to integrate the comic figure by domesticating him. In Greek pastoral, fam- ilies of satyrs appear; in order to rehabilitate the harlequin, Justus Moser marries him off, as his subtitle indicates: Die Tugend auf der Schaubiihne, oder Harlequins Heirath.63 Goethe struggles with this dilemma himself in Die Mitschuldigen, by marrying off his harlequin and threatening him with cuckoldry, and in the aborted wedding ceremonies in Hanswursts Hochzeit. By very definition, however, Satyros cannot be integrated into society (not by marriage to the high priest's daughter, not even by the extreme unction of adoration and deification). It is in the end a powerful indictment of so- ciety when it does not prove attractive enough to hold outsiders, even a satyr; conversely, society continues to be fatally attracted, cult-like, to the other, the outsider, and the spoiler who rejects it. Molibre's Tartuffe, by comparison, is profoundly unattractive; the audience immediately sees the blind mistake of those who continue to follow him despite their better judg- ment. Tartuffe's exclusion in the end has a real consequence: his impris- onment. Satyros, when unmasked, loses none of his attractiveness; he suf- fers no consequences, and, in fact, gets the girl as a reward for his misad- ventures: "Es geht doch wohl eine Jungfrau mit" (484). Martin Stern con- siders this Goethe's ultimate open ending, and a dialectical one at that: Das ist natiurlich zugleich Regieanweisung. Was bedeutet sie? Eben jenes genannte Auf-die-Schwelle-einer-Dialektik-Treten, und zwar einer im He- gelschen Sinne echten Wahl flillt der Vorhang. Aber der Zuschauer/Leser denkt nattirlich weiter.64 Satyros has the last extended word; Psyche has the last gesture. Both are powerful dramaturgical statements that shake society to its erotic founda- tions. The vaguely Greek, vaguely Christian society in Satyros suffers from "testosterone drain," not "brain drain." Goethe's anthropological, cosmo- logical, and mythological approaches to the comic figure leave it unable to</page><page sequence="23">456 Denton perform its social function: impotent, as it were, to do anything but leave. Confident in dealing with matters of the intellect (by way of Hanswurst and Mephisto), Goethe's comedy proves inadequate (by way of the satyr) to repair the testicular heart it so powerfully dissects. And yet easily overlooked in this criss-crossing of plots and morass of referentiality, Satyros is in the end a love story; the satyr and Psyche "elope" at the end of the play. Shall we presume this is a happy ending, in which satyr and girl live happily ever after? In this sense, Satyros under- studies the role of the love icon, Amor.65 In effect, Goethe rewrites one of his earliest anacreontic poems, "Ziblis, eine Erzihlung" (1767), in which the overtures of a "Waldgott" are rejected: Zartlich lacht das Ungeheuer, Ziblis wendet ihr Gesicht, Lauft, doch der gehornte Freyer Springt ihr wie ein hipfend Feuer Nach, und ruft: O flieh mich nicht.66 Subsequently, the satyr is vanquished by a human suitor, Emiren, who- and therein lies the rub-ravishes the girl himself. There, in anacreontic poetry, Goethe sets up a satyr-human agon similar to that of the satyr- hermit, only to turn the tables in terms of the duality of honor and lust. Here, in satyr play, appearance is reality, and Goethe reunites the dualistic principles of love and lust in one figure. Satyros is at once a refined, rococo cupid, especially romantic in his poetic language, and a sexually charged satyr, with only one thing on his mind. There is no way around it: Goethe's satyr can both love and fuck. This succinct difference illustrates the larger process of myth contamination by which Goethe works in Satyros (indeed, throughout his corpus): one myth is transformed or travestied, and then spliced, often with exposed seams, into another. In Satyros, Goethe begins with Aesop's (or Hans Sachs's) fable of the hermit and the satyr, then fo- cuses on the satyr in nature (the geography of Gessner's Idyllen, or that of his own anacreontic poetry), falls into Apuleius' love story of Psyche and Amor, before depicting a parody of a Dionysian orgy, the consequences of which are finally defused by a plot device borrowed from Moliere's Tartuffe, sexual entrapment. The satyr at play-and this is part of its cult appeal- never leaves Arcadia without packing a self-referential encyclopedia of my- thology.

In 1824 and 1826, the older Goethe composes fragmentary, theo- retical remarks concerning Euripides' Cyclops, in which he works out a principle of "contrast- ing parallelism": "Man denke sich beyde Kunstwerke nebeneinander! Hier ist weder Parodie noch Travestie, sondern ein von Natur Hohes und von Natur Niederes, beydes von gleichem Meister im gleich erhabenen Styl gearbeitet; es ist ein Parallelismus im Gegensatz..." (469). 9Lissarrague 236. 1oIn their article "Representing Homosexuality: Winckelmann and the Aesthetics of Friendship," Simon Richter and Patrick McGrath state: "One spoke of Greek or socratic (even platonic) love, or perhaps pederasty or Knabenliebe in its German form. The association with Greek antiquity was not a matter of euphemism; it designated a culture that was being imitated in many ways, not only in the literary and artistic efforts of the Deutsche Klassik" (Monatshefte 86 [1994]: 45-46). The early Goethe's indignation at Wieland's Alcestis, which occasions the powerful parody of Gotter Helden und Wieland, has its source in such cultural misperceptions. In matters of literary and sexual politics, it is not always easy to differentiate between imitation, inversion, and invention. "11Lissarrague 236. 12Der junge Goethe, ed. Fischer-Lamberg, vol. 3, lines 148-51. All further quotations from Satyros are by line number from this edition. 13Incidentally, Goethe thereby glosses theater costume. In letters, the early Goethe rejects attempts at period dress as ridiculous, examples of false reception: "Da meynen die Herren das fremde Costume sollte was thun! Wenn's Stick schlecht ist, was sind des Ackteurs</page><page sequence="25">458 Denton schdne Kleider!" (Der junge Goethe 1: 270-letter to Friederike Oeser, 13 Feb. 1769). All Goethe's farces are very conscious of the theater, uncommonly self-referential of theater prac- tice-although often in the text itself, not only in the stage directions. For Goethe's stagecraft, see Walther Kothe's astonishingly prescient dissertation, Der junge Goethe und die Biihne (Gottingen: Dieterich, 1910): "Die Vorschriften fir antikes Kostuim beim jungen Goethe ius- serst spirlich" (84). 14Quoted from Paul Grootkerk, "The Satyr," Mythical and Fabulous Creatures: A Source Book and Research Guide, ed.

Samuel Richardson (London, 1750) 145; an emblematic vignette accompanies the fable (facing 142). In Bellegarde's Aesop translation: "Der Satyr, da er den Bauer in seine Hinde blasen sah, fragte ihn nach der Ursache. Es geschieht, um sie zu erwar- men, antwortete er ihm" (quoted from Kayser 831). Both Kayser (821) and Fischer-Lamberg point out this Aesopean connection (Der junge Goethe 3: 464). It is a tribute to the lasting power of such traditions that this encounter between hermit and the grotesque (here the satyr) continues to be cited and reworked in literature and film. In Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, a hermit provides the monster with hospitality. In both the film with Boris Karloff and the parody, Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein, this encounter turns out to be comic (Aesopean humor in the former, slapstick parody in the latter). 35Hans Sachs, Werke, ed.

Walter Hinderer [Stuttgart: Reclam, 1980] 28). ""On the day he discovers that he is the murderer of his father, we need not know what Oedipus ate for breakfast (this is not a wholly flippant remark-a large number of satyric fragments, most of course quarried by Athenaeus, have to do with eating and drinking)" (Sutton 168). 41"Introduction," Winkler and Zeitlin 7. 42Compare W. Daniel Wilson, "Hunger/Artist: Goethe's Revolutionary Agitators in Gitz, Satyros, Egmont, and Der Biirgermeister," Monatshefte 86 (1994): 80-94. When Goethe "is not portraying hunger as a pitiable condition, or even as a viable legitimation of insurrec- tion, he stands it on its head. He does this by transferring hunger from the untutored masses to the pseudo-intellectual revolutionary, in whom hunger becomes a delegitimizer, an indica- tion of greediness and base motivations" (81). 43David Konstan, "An Anthology of Euripides' Kyklops," Winkler and Zeitlin 207-27; here 209. 44"We are not informed about the diet of the satyrs in our play; they appear to be interested solely in drink.... But perhaps this preference suffices to identify them as a third type. Just as they are outside the category of food both for Odysseus and for the kyklops, they are, in respect to their own appetites, indifferent to the line between edible and inedible flesh, since they apparently partake of neither" (Konstan 211). As a grotesque, Satyros plays the role of both giant and satyr in Goethe's play. 45Konstan 224. 46Sutton 174. 47"Another common satyric theme is hospitality and its abuse. Hospitality plays an equally important role in Alcestis, in which one of Euripides' interests is exploration of the guest-friend relationship of xenia. Whatever may be wrong with Admetus, which is probably plenty, he is a good host and the action of the play revolves around this fact" (Sutton 181). 48Throughout his 1773 letters, Goethe graphically abuses-steps over the boundaries- of his relationship with Kestner and Charlotte Buff. The most flagrant example of such abuse is his response to what we can only assume was an epistolary reprimand on Kestner's part; Goethe threatens to expose the pair to ridicule on stage: "wenn ihr euch einfallen lasst eifer- stichtig zu werden so halt ich mirs aus euch mit den treffendsten Ztigen auf die Biuhne zu bringen und Juden und Christen sollen tiber euch lachen" (Der junge Goethe 3: 32-letter to Kestner, 15 April 1773). In essence, that is exactly what Goethe ends up doing, if in another genre. Kestner's response is a masterpiece of understatement: "il est dangereux d'avoir un auteur pour ami" (Boyle 185). 49This tendency is yet another example of what Bakhtin calls dialogic thinking: enter- taining two contradictory positions simultaneously. From episodes in Dichtung und Wahrheit, we know Goethe composed many of his works using similarly dialogic exercises: "He created for himself (and the account in his autobiography is supported by contemporary evidence) a mental audience of those whom he was trying to address and win over.... In his ghostly conversations with these partners only semi-independent of himself, so similar, he felt, to the process of writing letters, he endeavoured to find roles for himself to act out which both had some general moral or historical significance and could be filled by him with a sense of self- hood: roles which fused both a character and a consciousness, the two functions of a personality which he had separately distributed to Gotz and to Weislingen. The wood-devil Satyros rep- resents Goethe himself, but as a Herderian, perhaps even as Herder, while the hermit in the farce represents him as Rousseauist" (Boyle 162). It is my assumption that Goethe's autobi- ographical depictions of his working methods can be trusted in a way his accounts and inter- pretations of his own works cannot. His early letters-and accounts by others of his working methods-lend credence to the procedures he remembers in his autobiography and continues to practice in his writing. If in nothing else in Goethe's life, there is a continuity in his working habits.</page><page sequence="27">460 Denton 5OHarold Bloom sees in Goethe one of the few modern poets who fails to suffer from literary anxiety; see The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry (New York: Oxford UP, 1975): "Nietzsche, as he always insisted, was the heir of Goethe in his strangely optimistic refusal to regard the poetical past as primarily an obstacle to fresh creation. Goethe, like Milton, absorbed precursors with a gusto evidently precluding anxiety" (50). 51"SATYROS. Was blast ihr da so in die Hand?/ EINSIEDLER. Seyd ihr nicht mit der Kunst bekanndt?/ Ich hauch die Fingerspitzen warm" (82-84). Almost every seventeenth- and eighteenth-century copy of the fables I have seen carries such vignettes; see, for example, the popular English edition translated by Samuel Richardson: Aesop's Fables (London, 1750): "A great intimacy was struck up between a Man and a Satyr.... Nay, says the Satyr, if you have got a trick for blowing hot and cold out of the same mouth, I have done with you" (145- emblem facing 142). Hans Sachs depicts the same material in his "Fabel von dem Waldtbruder mit dem Satyrus." Beutler emphasizes Goethe's propensity to dramatize based on relief im- ages, even when the source is descriptive: "Im einzelnen, wie er oft tut, lehnt Goethe sich an eine bildliche Darstellung an, an ein antikes Relief" (1038). In his Mythologisches Lexikon, Hederich describes Montfaucson's relief (col. 2092). Any number of satyr depictions would have been accessible to Goethe in book form: vignettes on title pages and in borders and illustrations. See, as only one example, Lessing's edition of Christlob Mylius' Vermischte Schrif- ten (Berlin: Haude und Spener, 1754), in which a satyr carrying a lantern is depicted twice as vignette (III; 444). Convolution and conflation abound in the eighteenth century; is this the philosopher Diogones' lantern, misappropriated by a satyr? 52In Boyle's gloss, "Neither Feuerbach nor Nietzsche will add anything of emotional or intellectual significance to this outburst of an Antichrist" (164); "[t]he extraordinary forceful diction of the 'Prometheus' poem is in part due to Goethe's resentful awareness that he is having to cut a path through a jungle of public, not personal issues, which none the less are fraught with extreme danger for the mind of the individual" (168). 53Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, Uber die Lehre des Spinoza (1785), Die Hauptschriften zum Pantheismusstreit zwischen Jacobi und Mendelssohn, ed. Heinrich Scholz (Berlin: Reuther &amp; Reichard, 1916) 77. Goethe's humorous response to a somewhat uncomfortable situation: "Herder findet lustig, dab ich bei dieser Gelegenheit mit Lessing auf Einen Scheiterhaufen zu sitzen komme" (Weimarer Ausgabe 4.7: 93-letter to E H. Jacobi, 11 Sept. 1785). 54Boyle 149. 55Ruth Padel, "Making Space Speak," Winkler and Zeitlin: "Behind the skene is an imagined space which the theater conceals but continually refers to. The important tragic act will happen unseen and mostly within. We think of unseen acts as performed offstage. For the Athenians it was within-stage, inside something within the spectators' field of vision, but into which they could not see" (345). 56Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, Schriften und Briefe, ed. Wolfgang Promies, vol. 1 (Miinchen: Hanser, 1968) 508 (F345). Boyle glosses this Lichtenberg quotation along just these lines of "impotent desire": "The implied analysis-that Sentimentalism interprets as 'feeling' what is no more than impotent desire-is far more than a coarse joke. The cult of feeling was not just an intellectual movement: it had clear implications for personal and even physical behavior, which went beyond a greater readiness to weep or read together or to dress and speak informally, and which were bound to conflict with the prevailing notions of decorum- and so to generate frustration and misery" (139). 57Lissarrague 235. 58Stern, "Die Schwinke der Sturm-und-Drang Periode," Goethes Dramen 31. 59Der junge Goethe 3: 352. 60"Es lassen sich in der Geschichte des Lustspiels zwei Formen der spielerischen Norm- abweichung erkennen .... Das Publikum lacht hier befreit mit der komischen Figur, weil es seine eigenen Wiinsche verkorpert sieht, ohne sich ihrer doch schimen zu miissen.... Das Publikum lacht hier uiber die Versuche einzelner Personen des Stiicks, von der Norm abzu- weichen-Versuche, die immer zum Scheitern verurteilt sind" (Catholy 1: 8-9). Catholy, how- ever, expresses doubts that this division is as clean in practice as it is in theory: "Deshalb wird es auch fraglich, ob sich wirklich-wie das in der Forschuing so haufig geschieht-eine sati- rische Verlach-Komodie streng vom Lustspiel des Mitlachens trennen liBt" (11). 61Martin Stern, "Ambivalenz und Dialektik": "So mischt sich hier, wie iibrigens fast durchwegs in diesem Genre bei Goethe, was einander im Grunde ausschlielen miiBte: das</page><page sequence="28">Goethe's Satyros 461 Lachen tiber und das Lachen mit deren Figuren, Satire, die einen kritischen eigenen Stand- punkt voraussetzt, und Humor, der keinen hat, weil er alles gelten 1lift" (99). 62Winfried Freund, ed., Deutsche Komodien: Vom Barock bis zur Gegenwart (Miinchen: Fink, 1988): "Heraufbeschworen wird der komische Konflikt hhiufig durch den Auftritt des Spielverderbers, der sich entweder weigert, tiberhaupt mitzuspielen, bzw. zum Mitspielen erst gar nicht zugelassen wird, oder zwar mitspielt, aber die Spielregeln nicht enthilt. Dabei reicht die Spannweite vom Falschspiel bis zum Gegenspiel.... Es gilt, den Spielverderber zu inte- grieren oder ihn zu entlarven, d.h. ihn zurechtzuweisen oder ihn im Extremfall von der wei- teren Teilnahme am Spiel auszuschliessen" (12). 63Written in 1763, in the wake of Mdser's Vertheidigung des Groteskekomischen (1761); first published by Nicolai in 1798. For Greek satyr families, see Seaford: "Just as satyric drama fails to resist gradual assimilation to tragedy and comedy, so in the satyrs themselves the element of animality (for example the equine proportions of their phalli) on the whole grad- ually diminishes from the sixth to the third century BC. It is not before the fifth century that we find evidence of the satyr-family, with three generations like the human, its younger mem- bers beardless but still balding" (31). See also Robert Storey's account of harlequin's remaking as a family man in eighteenth-century theater in Pierrot: A Critical History ofa Mask (Prince- ton: Princeton UP, 1978): "A doting father and husband, Harlequin is moved first to rage, then to ineffable sadness, when he suspects his wife of infidelity" (63). J. P. Claris de Florian wrote three plays between 1779 and 1790 depicting Harlequin "in the three most interesting states of life, those of the lover, the husband, and the father" (quoted in Storey: 62). 64"Ambivalenz und Dialektik" 100. If Hegel had read Satyros, he would have recognized in this farce the confirmation of the ultimate subjective power of comedy to negate and dissolve art itself, which he gestures at in the final pages of his Vorlesungen iuber die Aesthetik (Werke, ed. H. G. Hollo, vol. 10.3 [Berlin: Duncker und Humblot, 1838]): "Doch auf diesem Gipfel fiihrt die Kom6die zugleich zur Aufl6sung der Kunst tiberhaupt. Der Zweck aller Kunst ist die durch den Geist hervorgebrachte Identitat.... Stellt nun aber die Kom6die diese Einheit nur in ihrer Selbstzerstdrung dar,... so tritt die Gegenwart und Wirksamkeit des Absoluten nicht mehr in positiver Einigung mit den Charakteren und Zwecken des realen Daseyns hervor, sondern macht sich nur in der negativen Form geltend, da3 alles ihm nicht Entsprechende sich aufhebt, und nur die Subjektivitit als solche sich zugleich in dieser Auflosung als ihrer selbst gewiB und in sich gesichert zeigt" (580). As Satyros struts off stage, the embodiment of absolute subjectivity, he takes Geist, at least the Zeitgeist, with him. 65Der Name der Liebenden, Psyche, ist nur voll verstindlich, wenn man sich unter Rekurs auf Apuleis' Metamorphosen den Satyr als-travestierten-Amor denkt" (Borch- meyer 829). 66Der junge Goethe 1: 167-69.
