The fascination of their study is increased by the fact that the meaning of the scenes is usually obscure. Among the many gems that represent sanctuaries and acts of worship, but at the same time unique in subject matter, is one to which this paper is devoted, a gem which has pre- viously been described rather than interpreted (Fig. 1). It is a rock crystal lentoid from the Idaean Cave. Evans' de- scription of it 1 is as follows: "A female votary is seen blowing a conch-shell or triton before an altar of the usual Mycenaean shape. Above the altar is seen a group of three trees apparently cypresses, and immediately in front of them the 'horns of con- secration.' To the right of the altar is a rayed symbol, to the left is apparently another altar base, with a conical excrescence, and behind the votary another tree. " The description is fairly adequate, though scant, but Evans' interpretation of the object at the left of the altar is open to question, and, moreover, he has made no attempt to explain the meaning of the scene. Furtwiingler 2 wrongly interprets the object in the hand of the vo- tary as a large fruit to be presented as an offering. That Evans is correct in naming this a shell is clear from a clay seal impression 3 where two conch-shells of identically the same shape as the one on the gem are depicted. The curiously pointed object at the left of the altar Furtwiingler calls a symbol which occurs frequently in Cretan writing. He was perhaps misled in this interpretation by the picture in the Monumenti Antichi dei Lincei4 where the object has been drawn with a crossbar near the point. This makes it slightly resemble a pictograph which Evans calls a mallet, 5 though the proportions are somewhat different. But with- FIGURE 1. MINOAN GEM 1 J. H.

Nor can the star be considered a pictograph, as the five-pointed star never occurs in Cretan linear script, though the six- and eight- pointed forms are common. In my opinion there is represented on the gem the sanctuary of Aphrodite in her character as a fertility-goddess and a deity of the heavens and of the ocean. We know that Crete as well as Cyprus was a strong center of her cult, and she is so closely linked with the Mother Goddess, with Astarte and Ishtar as to be virtually the same deity under a different name. Her connection with the heavens- with the title Ourania-is eastern. Farnell2 tells us that the star was seen occasionally on Assyrian monuments and was perhaps the symbol of the Semitic goddess. It is certainly the symbol of Ishtar on an Assyrian gem 3 where she appears heavily armed riding on the back of a lion, with a star on the top of her elaborate headdress. Aphrodite apparently ceased to be an important goddess of the skies in later Hellenic worship, but that she was still so considered in some localities is clear from a coin of Ouranopolis, on which Aphrodite Ou- rania appears clad in a long chiton and peplos, her head surmounted by a star.4 Considering that Cretan worship was always strongly in- fluenced by Oriental cults it seems safe to interpret the star on the Idaean gem as a symbol of Aphrodite Ourania. Though stars gen- erally occur in the upper field of gems and cylinders, they do appear now and then in the lower corners.5 The trees behind the altar may likewise find their explanation in the cult of Aphrodite, as a vegetation-goddess. According to Hesy- chius trees were cut down and set up by the portal of the house as a dedication to Aphrodite, 6 and Lucian 7 tells us that at the festival of "the torch", in honor of the goddess of Hieropolis, large trees were erected in the courtyard of the temple. On the Cretan gem four trees occur, three immediately behind the altar and the other at the left. These may very likely stand within the sanctuary of the goddess. Perhaps the most important object in the scene on the gem is that which is represented at the left of the altar. This I believe to be a primitive image of Aphrodite herself. The resemblance to the fiddle-shaped Cycladic figurines of Neolithic times is striking indeed. A number of these are pictured in Figure 2, some with long necks and no indication of heads, like the figurine on the gem, some with the waist 1Knossos I, p. 222, fig. 167 from which the figure used here is reproduced.

Number 12 of the series is little more than a conical stone with slightly concave sides. Numbers 3 and 14 are also very crude. In fact they suggest a development from a simple, pointed stone, such as number 2 (Fig. 2). The sacred character of curiously shaped stones among primitive peoples is well known, and the pointed stone was sacred to a superlative degree. Moreover, in historical times we find it particularly associated with Astarte. The conical stone appears on coins of Mallus as her symbol,1 and on coins of Byblus it occurs within the temple as the divine image. A coin of Ouranopolis, already mentioned, shows beside the seated figure of FIGURE 2. CYCLADIC FIGURINES Aphrodite Ourania a conical stone capped with a star. The natural inference is that here Aphrodite is represented in two ways, in primi- tive aniconic form, and also as an anthropomorphic deity. The for- mer has lost its original importance and been relegated to a subordi- nate position as a symbol of the goddess. Farnell2 considers it probable that in many localities the earliest representations of Astarte were aniconic. The question readily sug- gests itself whether the Cycladic figurines may have developed from natural stones of approximately conical shape which were first of all considered as sacred to the fertility-deity, and which, little by little, came to be actually identified with the deity. It would be a simple step, then, to conceive of a human goddess and to translate the coni- cal stone into human form. Primitive man would easily think of the point of the stone as the head and neck, and the more bulbous por- 1 Head, Hist. Num. p. 606. 2Op. cit. II, p. 670.</page><page sequence="4">56 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY tion as the trunk of the body. Just as the conical stones had neither arms nor legs, so the earliest figurines are represented without ex- tremities. Gradually a closer approximation to the human form was reached. The neck was shortened, the waist and breasts indicated, and eventually, with the addition of legs, the original conical form became less obvious. The early anthropomorphic stage in the repre- sentation of Astarte is possibly supplied by the large marble "idols" of female form from the Cyclades.I The fact that these "idols" include nude female forms with arms crossed below the breasts con- firms the interpretation above given of the violin types as earlier rep- resentations of the fertility-goddess. Moreover, Astarte frequently appears nude in primitive times, as is attested by the terra cottas from Warka, where she is sometimes represented nude with her hands pressed against her breasts.2 The interpretation of the object on the Minoan gem as a primitive image of Aphrodite is further strengthened by the fact that such figu- rines have been found in Crete in Neolithic strata,3 and in Evans' words "it is impossible in Crete to dissociate these primitive images from those that appear in the shrines and sanctuaries of the Great Minoan Goddess." 4 Additional proof that the goddess might be represented in the form of a primitive idol is supplied by a Cypriote cylinder where the rayed object at the right has been recognized, by Perrot and Chipiez 5 as a figurine of Astarte. If the primitive Cycla- dic figurines can be identified as Aphrodite, a possible explanation is furnished for the presence of numerous figurines in graves both in Phoenicia and elsewhere. In the Cypriote necropolis at Dali they have been identified as statuettes of Astarte.6 There is some evi- dence of a mystery cult in Cyprus in which the image of the dead god- dess was restored to life, and in Assyrian religion Ishtar, after her descent to hell, was rescued and sprinkled with the water of life.7 What more appropriate for burial with the dead than figurines of the goddess whose resurrection may have suggested the possibility of a future life to mankind? The fact that a Neolithic figurine appears on a gem of the Bronze Age need disturb no one, since primitive images would be likely to survive because of their highly sacred nature. Moreover, the coni- cal form continued to be worshipped even under the Romans, as is seen on a coin of Byblus Struck by Marcrinus.8 Other coins of Cy- prus will demonstrate that the simple cone did not always occur, but 1See Fowler and Wheeler, Greek Archaeology, p. 43, fig. 1. 2 Frazer, Paus.

Some show, as the temple image, a conical base with rudimentary arms and head; 1 and inci- dentally furnish excellent evidence for the theory that the human representation of the deity developed slowly from the aniconic form, and that images of Aphrodite in all stages of development might be worshipped contemporaneously. To return to the gem (Fig. 1) the votary with the conch-shell de- serves some consideration, because this figure throws additional light on the significance of the subject. Shells were frequently used in re- ligious rites, particularly the conch-shell trumpet, for Evans has found specimens of these both at Phaestus and Cnossus,2 and his in- terpretation that they were used in religious ceremonies to summon the divinity seems plausible. I should like to go one step further and limit the use of the conch-shell trumpet to divinities of the ocean. It is particularly appropriate to Aphrodite as a goddess of the sea, a&amp;po-yev1s. Moreover, numerous cockle-shells, the type associated with Aphrodite in Greek art, have been found in Minoan sanctuaries, especially in the shrine of the Snake Goddess at Cnossus, where they seem to serve the purposes of cult rather than of decoration. Triton shells have also been found in Mycenaean beehive tombs in Crete.3 Can it be that they allude, as do the figurines found in tombs, to Aphrodite in her cthonic aspect? This raises the question whether Aphrodite was a divinity of the sea in Minoan times, since the actual evidence of her connection with the sea is late. Herodotus4 tells us that the oldest sanctuary of Aph- rodite Ourania was at Ascalon. In this sanctuary, which stood on the banks of a lake, full of fish, the goddess was represented as a woman from the hips upward, but as a fish from the hips downward.5 Here and throughout Syria fish were sacred to her. She was from very early times, then, a goddess of the water, perhaps first of the stream. However, the transition from stream to sea would be easy so soon as her worship was transferred across the sea to the inhabit- ants of the islands, such as the Cretans. The fish is the symbol of the Cretan Goddess on a bronze votive tablet from the Psychro Cave 6 where it appears together with the dove. This same tablet bears further marks of identification, the rayed disk and the moon, the usual marks of Aphrodite Ourania, thus combining the ideas of sky, air, and water. Here the sacred fish of Aphrodite would readily suggest the ocean, even though the goddess may not in the earliest 1 Per. and Chip. op. cit. III, p. 266, fig. 199. 2Knossos I, p. 221. 3Evans, J. H. S. 1901, p. 142. 41, 105. It is interesting to note in this connection that at Philistine Ascalon pot- tery of distinctly Mycenaean type has been found, showing close relationship be- tween the two regions. See E. Saussey Syria V, 1924, pp. 171-185 and pl. XLIII. 'Frazer, Paus. II, p. 130. 6Evans, Knossos I, p. 632, fig. 470 and p. 635.</page><page sequence="6">58 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY instance have been conceived as a sea-deity. A shell is as suitable to the Cretan Goddess as is the fish, and appears in Greek art with Aph- rodite to suggest her birth from the sea. The most famous example of this subject is the painting of Apelles. In Hellenistic art the shell and the dolphin are interchangeable attributes of Aphrodite. Cer- tainly the shells in the shrines at Cnossus are to be associated with the sea, for they are in no way appropriate to streams and lakes. The more one studies the development of Greek religion the clearer does it become that its origins must be sought in the remotest an- tiquity, and that the continuities are virtually unbroken. In Greek times Aphrodite's association with the sea is undisputed. At Hermion was a temple of Aphrodite, surnamed the Goddess of the Deep Sea and Goddess of the Haven.' On the Throne of Zeus, Aph- rodite was represented rising from the sea.2 The supposition is that this subject was by no means a new departure. Certainly on the Throne of Zeus at Olympia only the most conservative religious be- liefs would be expressed, beliefs which were supported by a long line of tradition. Aphrodite Ourania was also worshipped at Elis and was represented with her foot resting on a tortoise, in a statue by Phidias.3 This may be another indication of her mastery over the sea, as may likewise be the coins of Aegina with their sea-tortoises.4 Earlier than this, evidence for her worship as a sea-deity is wanting, but one is forced to believe that it did not originate spontaneously at a period when Greek religion was fully formed. Its origins must be looked for elsewhere, and it seems more than likely that earlier traces of this worship are to be seen in Crete. If the assumption is correct, then, that the shell in the hand of the votary indicates a deity of the sea, it is possible that we have Aph- rodite represented on the Idaean gem in three aspects. The star signifies her mastery over the heavens, the trees her power over the produce of the earth, and the shell suggests that she rules the waves from which she rose. KATE MCK.
