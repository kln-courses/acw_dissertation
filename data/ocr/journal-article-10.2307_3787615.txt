<plain_text><page sequence="1">580 journal of social history Rise from Want: A Peasant Family in the Machine Aige. By James C. Davis (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1986. xvii plus 165 pp.). This is microhistory with a vengeance ? the saga of the author's in-laws. The east of characters ends with his wife Elda and their meeting at an American army snack bar in Trieste in 1954, followed by a new life in America. She, her brother and her two surviving sisters, however, are merely bit players. Left behind in the old country is the story's hero, Elda's father Franc, denied an inheritance because he was a younger son and yet very successful in making the transition to becoming the modernized man we see in two of his proud photographs. By becoming a less energetic babymaker than her ancestors had been, his wife Lojza also did her part, but as with the other women in this history her feelings are recorded somewhat dimly, and of her we are offered only one rather anonymous group snapshot. Uncle Valentin, a conniving farmer who managed to buy out the family holdings inherited by his sissyish eldest brother, Uncle Jozef III, is not portrayed as a very likeable fellow; nor does one feel much sympathy for Uncle Emil, who drifted from casual labor and brushes with the law into chronic alcoholism, abandonment of his family, and a lonely death in a hospital ward. Franc's father, Jozef II, a shrewd peasant who managed to shift much of the labor burdens of his meager agricultural enterprise to his sharp-tongued and assertive wife Marija, increasingly devoted himself to quarrying and hauling services that paid well as railroad tracks were laid through the limestone Karst above Trieste where the family lived. Great-grandfather Jozef I apparently was cut of the same tough mold as his son; although protoindustrial opportunities were fewer in his day, he coped very well with changes wrought by the final emancipation from serfdom that came in the wake of the Revolution of 1848, and even abandoned traditional sheep raising in favor of quicker cash profits from carting. From parish registers, Davis is able to take us back three more generations, through Jozefs I father Matija and in turn his father Tomaz and his grandfather Luka, but already the documentation on their lifestyles becomes very thin. Even the scant entries of dates of birth and death then run out, and so it requires an assertion and a leap of common sense to graft the family tree onto the Jurij Zuzek and Gregor Gabrovic who appear in a 1578 document listing serfs and their obligations to the lord of Duino. Whereas in the above summary I have reversed the order of presentation so as to emphsize how the research strategy probably went, Davis tells his saga in the normal chronological order, and with an admirable narrative style ? not exactly Roots but really quite fascinating. He is not the first professional historian to write the history of his in-laws, or of his own ancestors as the case may be. What is remarkable about the book however, is how successfully and gracefully the author establishes the legitimacy of what he is doing, dives directly into giving an anthropomorphic dimension to all the ugly "izations" that plague more standard historical fare, and blithely sweeps past any potential grumblings about questions of typicality and scientific proof. The result is a work that should be of interest to all family historians - undergraduates, graduates, professors, genealogists. It is a first-rate model of one approach to deepening our</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 581 understanding of the past. Precisely because the book is so strong, it is opportune to raise questions about just where this approach may be taking us and what its limits are. The problem of affording proper confidentiality to people who hardly are capable of giving an informed consent is one Davis never addresses. Who can say whether the children of drunken Emil or tight-fisted Valentin would be entirely happy with what their cousin's husband has written about their fathers? Documentation raises related issues. That Davis did not encumber his endnotes with citations of every parish register he consulted is fine, since scholars familiar with this sort of material still would be able to retrace and confirm his findings. The fundamental reliance on oral sources for many of the most interesting aspects of the book is more troublesome. As one who has learned a lot about peasants while playing briscola with them and drinking homemade wine through the night, I am not about to suggest carrying around a tape recorder or busily scribbling into a notebook. And yet anyone who has done this sort of fieldwork even briefly, much less being married for over three decades to one of the "informants," would concede that the informants' own ways of expressing themselves, of thinking about their personal lives, and ofthe events around them are heavily shaped (distorted?) by the outside investigator. An example must suffice: much of what we know about the private and public world of fourteenth-century Tiiscan businessmen comes from the voluminous letters of Francesco di Marco Datini of Prato, with all the traditional problems such a source presents; if around the year 2500 scholars should turn to this book to learn how Franc and Lojza Zuzek adapted to modernization, they will be reading instead about how James C. Davis mediated their experiences. The kind of history, and of historical record, that Davis has created is extremely valuable, and yet the profession as a whole has done very little to come to grips with the need to develop appropriate standards for preserving and evaluating such evidence. Macrohistorians and quantifiers go their own way, effectively ignoring it as atypical and unverifiable even while using bits and pieces to leaven their more solid tomes. Microhistorians, on the other hand, neglect some of the most elementary methods of documentation and instead delight in telling a good story and in preserving for posterity, albeit secondhand, lives otherwise destined for oblivion. Finally, there is a presentist bias here that is very difficult to overcome, a variation of what Herbert Butterfield some time ago referred to as the history of the winners. While Davis's narrative moves ineluctably from back then until right now, both his research strategy and his evidence often go in the opposite direction. Uncle Jozef III's date of death is listed as unknown, an indication of a surprising lack of familial cohesion amont the Zuzeks, and yet the omissioh hardly matters since he appears to have been overly dependent upon his mother and mired in an economic system undergoing decay. We learn of Franc's purchase on credit of a bicycle and of how he took up smoking a pipe in imitation of the superior English, but not of the peasants in transition who resisted indoor plumbing and electricity. We are given a variety of reasons why Jozef I and Jozef II abandoned sheep raising, all of which make sense if in fact they were in tune with advancing industrialization but none of which shed light on the "profound</page><page sequence="3">582 journal of social history changes in the nature and rhythm of their lives" (p. 42) that Davis rightly senses must have been involved. To the best of my knowledge, caring for just fifteen sheep on the Karst should have been work done primarily by women, children, and the aged. In what ways were such people the protagonists of their own history? Modernization, industrialization, urbanization, peasantry ? all abstractions given a human dimension in this fine study, and yet the Zuzeks themselves remain elusive. The book's title is revealing. Davis and his wife, and perhaps her father in his later years, retrospectively view their family history as rising and the distant past as a time of want. Whether their forebears understood themselves in this way is another matter. Rutgers University Rudolph M. Bell</page></plain_text>
