<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTICES OF BOOKS sanctuary of Poseidon at Isthmia. Although plastic vases and heads attached to vases are briefly discussed, the lamps and terracottas are only mentioned in passing, so that the full extent of coroplastic dedications is not clear. The catalogue is divided into two sections, 'context groups' and 'fabric and decoration'. In the former, individual deposits are discussed, and in the latter, individual vases and questions of art-history and attribu- tion. Particularly welcome is the discussion of the Corinthian outline style (pp. 192-234), as a non-export style, and as a corrective to the view standardly expressed in handbooks that Corinthian figured wares end c.550. The book is liberally illustrated with both photographs and profile drawings, with some figure drawings. The small size of the photographs is of little consequence for much of the pottery, where repetitive and simply decorated types are illustrated perfectly adequately (e.g. the kalathiskoi on pls. 8-9). They are supported by a representative selection of profile drawings. The vases of art-historical interest, primarily the Archaic figured pottery, are much less well served by the photographs, and a more generous format would have been an improvement, particularly since there are few figure drawings, and those of a rather messy style. These criticisms are rather of the format of the series than of the present volume, which is both clear and useful. K.W. ARAFAT King's College London CARPENTER (T. H.) Art and myth in ancient Greece: a hand-book. (World of art.) London: Thames and Hudson, 1991. Pp. 256, [138] plates. ?6.95. Carpenter's Art and myth in ancient Greece is limited to a discussion of mythological illustrations created during the archaic and classical periods. Attic vases naturally hold the centre of the stage, but works in other media are also included. The abundant illustrations-a total of 356-are for the most part of very good quality, even including the black-figure vases, which are particu- larly difficult to reproduce. The text, presumably addressed primarily to beginners in the field, is commendable in pointing out that some stories found in images differ from those preserved in surviving literature, that certain elements (or even figures) in a picture are purely decorative and have no narrative significance and that the identification of a person or a story is not always simple and straightfor- ward. For instance, C. does well in explaining to the novice that an attribute does not always automatically identify a figure (e.g. torches may be held by Demeter, Persephone or Hecate). C. usually presents a brief summary of the story of a myth, followed by mention of how, when, where, in what media and how often it was represented. This somewhat dry enumeration tends to be informative rather than inspiring and C.'s treatment of myth is altogether more in the spirit of Apollodorus than that of Ovid. His method is, nevertheless, efficient in providing a great deal of essential information with laudable economy. Such information could be valuable to a wide range of readers and it is therefore unfortunate that C. sometimes appears to forget the needs of his intended audience. There is, for instance, much mention (without explanation) of the shapes of vases and names of painters, neither of which is necessarily familiar to the 'classicist in the street'-much less to a Renaissance historian or to the general public, who will also find the failure to add 'BC' to dates before Christ a distinct stumbling block to ready understanding. In such a wide-ranging work there are bound to be errors and oversights: red-figure vases are twice dated to the first half of the 6th century (pp. 205 and 207); a line of text has dropped out of the first paragraph on p. 195 robbing it of sense; Apollo, not Artemis (as stated in the caption), backs up Hektor in fig. 305; and the caption for fig. 240 has been omitted entirely; but such flaws are of minor importance. More disturbing are the occasions when clarity has been sacrificed to the rule of an arbitrarily imposed-sometimes ill-judged-principle of consistency. For instance, C.'s discussion of the iconography of Zeus and Ganymede begins awkwardly with the Ovidian version, then works back to the 4th century BC image of eagle abducting boy, and finally concludes with the earliest pictorial convention, namely an anthropomorphic Zeus pursuing a youth. The justifi- cation for such an illogical mode of presentation is that the story is subsumed under the rubric 'metamorphoses of Zeus'. Another example of where consistency in small matters obscures clarity in greater ones occurs in C.'s chapter on 'Portraits of the Gods'. C. introduces the gods following the order in which they appear as guests attending the wedding of Peleus and Thetis (on the vases painted by Sophilos and Kleitias)-a device presumably intended as a refreshing change from the usual presenta- tion according to the Hesiodic genealogy or the schema of a hierarchic family. The device is unsuccessful, however, because so many mythological nobodies are among the first to arrive, while so important a goddess as Athena virtually brings up the rear. This book will no doubt be used by many people in many fields, and it is, therefore, particularly disappoint- ing that it does so little to convey either the charm and power of the myths or the imagination and subtlety of the artists who illustrated them.

These two books share a single starting point, the relationship of art to contemporary political develop- ments, the underlying belief being that art reflects society and should be seen in conjunction with other manifestations of society. This reviewer wholeheartedly agrees, although it is hardly a new approach as Francis claims, and his final chapter shows how established such an approach is (the generality of the unnamed opposition [p. 6] is frustrating). 217</page></plain_text>
