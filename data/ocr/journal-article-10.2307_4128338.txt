<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cults and shrines in early historical Mathura (c. 200 BC-AD 200) Upinder Singh Abstract This paper uses archaeological evidence to identify some of the multiple religious strands and layers that mark the rich cultural landscape of ancient Mathura (in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh). Focusing on the four centuries between c. 200 BC and AD 200, it identifies what can be described in retrospect as an important stage in the early history of popular Hinduism. The paper highlights the importance of the old cults of the goddesses, yakshas, yakshis, nagas, nagis, and their interface with emerging Puranic pantheons. It delineates the architectural forms of early temples in the Mathura area, their sources of patronage and the religious dimensions of royal policy, bringing into focus the great resilience of some of the older cults. Keywords Religion; Hinduism; Mathura; temples; Vaishnavism; goddesses. The history of Hinduism has generally been constructed on the basis of frameworks provided by religious texts, which are not always accurately reflective of popular practice. Apart from their elite authorship and the notorious problems of dating, brahmanical texts reflect a phase when the practices they mention have been accorded brahmanical sanction, and hence conceal their much earlier origin. Further, traditions seeking to attain or having attained the position of cultural dominance try to marginalize other traditions that may have been very important at the time and in the process give us a distorted impression of prevailing religious practice. Regional or local variations are not always clearly reflected in early texts, and there are some widely pervasive practices that find no mention whatsoever. This paper argues that archaeology can be fruitfully used to identify the roots and early history of popular Hinduism. This includes the evidence of either polytheistic or monolatrous worship, deities that came to be assigned places of prominence or subordination in the Hindu pantheons, the devotional worship of images of deities in religious shrines and cults which had more than a local significance. Of course the limitation of the archaeological perspective is that, although it gives us ample information regarding the tangible forms, objects and material contexts of worship, it is less Rz Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group World Archaeology Vol. 36(3): 378-398 The Archaeology of Hinduism ( 2004 Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd ISSN 0043-8243 print/1470-1375 online DOI: 10.1080/0043824042000282803</page><page sequence="2">Cults and shrines in early historical Mathura 379 forthcoming when it comes to the experiential, spiritual, emotional and theological aspects of religious practice, and, like many texts, it tends to have an urban bias. The focus of the paper is on the Mathura district of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, especially on the city of Mathura and the sites of Sonkh and Mat (25km south-west and 14.5km north of Mathura respectively), between c. 200 BC and c. AD 200. In the sixth century BC, Mathura was the capital of the Shurasena kingdom. Absorbed into the Mauryan empire in the third century BC, Mathura's cultural efflorescence is particularly marked during the centuries when it came under the successive control of local rulers - the Mitras and Dattas (the late third century BC to the late first century BC), the Kshatrapas (late first century BC to the first quarter of the first century AD) and then the Kushanas (the first century AD to the late second/early third century AD). Strategically poised at the entrance to the fertile Gangetic plains, Mathura burst forth as a major cultural crossroad, a locus of the activity of political elites, a flourishing city noted for specialized craft production (especially its fine cotton textiles), a junction of major trans-regional trade routes, a centre of diverse religious establishments and a trend-setter of sophisticated sculptural styles. The archaeological profile of sites in the Mathura area The Yamuna divides Mathura district into an eastern and western part; most of the archaeological sites are located to the west of the river. The first somewhat systematic archaeological explorations, documentation and excavations (in Chaubara and Kankali Tila mounds) of the Mathura area (Fig. 1) were conducted by Alexander Cunningham between 1861 and 1882 (Cunningham, 1871, 1873, 1884, 1885). While other nineteenth- century archaeological accounts of Mathura (e.g. Growse 1882) focused on the Buddhist remains, Vogel's reports (1908-9, 1909-10, 1910-11, 1911-12) brought out other key aspects of the early religious history of the area, such as the worship of images of nagas, yakshas and brahmanical deities. In the post-independence decades, the Archaeological Survey of India carried out excavations in different parts of Mathura city in 1954-5 and between 1973 and 1977, but no full report has been so far published (IAR 1976-7: 88-9; Joshi 1989). A summary of its sequence is given in Table 1. Between 1966 and 1974, more intensive and extensive excavations were carried out at Sonkh (25km south west of Mathura) by the Indian Art and Archaeology Research Team of the Museum fur Indische Kunst, Berlin, under the direction of Herbert Hartel (Hartel 1993). Eight periods of occupation, divided into forty habitation levels, were identified. A summary of the archaeological sequence is given in Table 2.1 The Mathura region is most strongly associated with the legend and worship of Krishna, but between c. 200 BC and AD 200, its religious landscape was extremely diverse. The details of sculptural and inscriptional discoveries in nineteenth- and early twentieth- century accounts enable us to identify the location of some of the shrines, even though structural remains are absent or near-absent. To give a few examples, the Katra was the site of a Buddhist vihara from the early second century AD; the Jamalpur/Jail Mound was the site of a Buddhist establishment and a shrine of the naga deity Dadhikarna; a Jaina establishment stood on the Kankali Tila from the second century BC.

Goddesses, votive tanks and shrines The abundance of stone and terracotta images of early historical Mathura indicates goddesses, yakshas, yakshis, nagas and nagis formed important features of the religious landscape. The 'mother goddess' or 'goddess' label shelters a number of distinct and different goddesses, most of whom may always remain anonymous to us. These terms are used here only as a convenient abbreviation for female figurines whose attributes suggest some sort of cultic or ritualistic significance - as objects of worship, votive offerings, or as part of the paraphernalia of domestic rituals - with the additional caveat that the discernment of such a significance is often subjective. The importance of the worship of images of goddesses in early historical Mathura is represented in an abundance of carved ring stones and disc stones, terracotta images and plaques. A number of 'mother goddess' figurines have been discovered in stratified contexts in the course of Mathura excavations (Joshi and Margabandhu 1976-7).

II Late fourth-second century BC Beginnings of urbanism; pottery assemblage marked by northern black polished ware (NBP); size of settlement increases to about 3.9 sq. km with a mud fortification wall (the Dhulkot) flanking three sides and the river on the east; coinage, prolific specialized crafts such as terracottas, copper and iron working, and beads; NBP is found at sites such as the Katra, Saptarishi Tila, Bhuteshwar and Govindanagar, all of which seem to have been part of the urban settlement of Mathura. III Second-late first century BC Accentuation of urban features; ceramic assemblage dominated by a red ware, with some grey ware as well; beginning and gradual increase in the number of burnt brick structures; inscribed coins, seals and sealings; increased stylistic sophistication in terracottas and other craft items; fortification wall falls into disuse. IV First-third century AD Urban efflorescence; red wares, including pots with painted and stamped designs, a more limited quantity of fine red polished ware including sprinklers; great variety and technical finesse in artefacts; fortification wall strengthened, enlarged and supplemented with an inner fortification. V Fourth-sixth century AD No regular archaeological sequence identified or established for these or subsequent centuries. of Period II. The 'goddess' figurines of succeeding centuries display greater stylistic refinement, technical innovations and increase in number and variety. They usually have prominent breasts and broad hips, and wear ornaments such as applique necklaces, bracelets, ear-rings and girdles. Some are crowned by a profusion of rosettes, while others have more elaborate head-dresses consisting of a mass of conical sprouts or grass blades encircled by a cluster of cactus-like plants (Plate 1). At Sonkh, the first female figurines, some of which may have had a cultic significance, appear in Period II. The cultic significance is more discernible in Period III, whose finds include some terracottas depicting a female figure holding a fish and a female figure with an attendant in adoration. A plaque found in Period IV levels could represent the earliest depiction of Durga Mahishasuramardini (the goddess Durga killing the buffalo demon Mahisha) at the site. Yakshas and nagas, 'mother goddesses', and Durga are represented at subsequent levels (Hartel 1993: 88ff.). The 'goddesses' are sometimes associated with terracotta artefacts that are referred to in archaeological literature as votive tanks and shrines. The Sonkh excavations yielded 266 fragments of such objects (ibid.: 195ff.). The bulk of them belong to Period III, and Hartel</page><page sequence="5">382 Upinder Singh Table 2 The Sonkh cultural sequence Period Levels Description of Period Chronology Period I 40-37 PGW and BRW c. 800-400 BC Period II 36-29 Pre-and early Maurya,Maurya and c. 400-late second century BC 'ShungaCultural Phase' Period III 28-25 Mitras of Mathura Late second-late first century BC Period IV 24-23 Kshatrapas and Ramadatta End of first century BC-early first century AD Period V 22-16 Kushanas First-third century AD Period VI 15-12 Guptas to early medieval Fourth-tenth century Period VII 11-8 Medieval levels Tenth-sixteenth centuries Period VIII 7-1 Mughals to Jats, late fortress levels Sixteenth-eighteenth centuries Plate 1 A Mathura 'mother goddess' found at NBP levels in the 1974-5 excavations (courtesy: Archaeological Survey of India).</page><page sequence="6">Cults and shrines in early historical Mathura 383 describes the first century BC as the most inventive phase for votive tanks. These artefacts vary in shape and size and are associated with one or more of the following features: lamp- cups and/or birds and lamps on their rim; houses built around a courtyard structure or a structure (probably a shrine) raised on a platform supported with pillars and approached by a staircase or ladder; a lotus plant standing upright in the tank; figures of snake, frog or fish at the base of the tank; 'mother goddesses' seated along the wall, carrying a child in their arms and a bowl in their lap. Most of the varieties were clearly supposed to be filled with water. The votive shrines can be seen as miniature representations of popular shrines, apparently connected with the worship of goddesses and nagas. Votive tanks and shrines have been found at many other sites in the subcontinent, from Taxila in the north-west to Chirand in the east to Kolhapur in the south, in contexts ranging from the third century BC to the third century AD (Ghosh 1989: 277). At Sonkh on the other hand, they were discovered from the third century BC to medieval levels, showing that such objects were a part of the paraphernalia of domestic rituals or worship for over a thousand years.2 The worship of yakshas and yakshis The yakshas were deities connected with water, fertility, trees, the forest and the wilderness. The evidence of literature and sculpture graphically illustrates the metamor- phosis of the yaksha from a benevolent, powerful deity who was the focus of exclusive worship to a terrifying, demonic creature, reduced to the position of a subsidiary, attendant figure associated more with fertility than wealth (see Coomaraswamy 1980; Mitterwallner 1989). Yakshis or yakshinis, the feminine counterparts, were originally benign deities connected with fertility. Many of the Shalabhanjikas - a generic term for sensuous sculptural representations of women grasping the branches of a tree - of various ancient religious establishments were also yakshis. The literary image of the yakshi in the texts of the brahmanical, Buddhist and Jaina traditions, on the other hand, is generally demonic and frightening (Sutherland 1992: 137ff.). In spite of their eventual absorption, marginalization and demonization in the dominant religious traditions, the sheer pervasiveness of the presence of yakshas and yakshis in these texts illustrates just how important and widespread their worship once was. Although the worship of yakshas and yakshis probably goes back to an older rural milieu, between the third century BC and second century AD they occur in the urban landscape, and cannot be described or dismissed (as they often are) as the focus of minor, exclusively rural, 'folk' cults. The imposing stone images from the Mathura area and elsewhere were the products of urban ateliers, financed by affluent urban patrons. They reflect the existence of iconographic conventions and artisanal skills, and imply community worship in shrines. The money-bag that the yaksha sometimes holds in his left hand (in the images found at Besnagar and Pawaya in central India) connects him with wealth. The yaksha himself increasingly takes on an urbane look, and it is difficult to distinguish between some of the yaksha figures and portraits of sophisticated and wealthy mortal men of substance. The most celebrated of the Mathura yakshas is the colossal grey sandstone figure (2.59m high) discovered at Parkham village, south of Mathura city (Plate 2). Generally assigned</page><page sequence="7">384 Upinder Singh on stylistic grounds to the second/first century BC, the palaeography of the inscription on its pedestal, however, suggests a third century BC date. The inscription (Luders 1961: 177- 8) states that this image, made by Gomitaka, pupil of Kunika, was set up by eight brothers, members of the Manibhadra puga (congregation). It also indicates that it represents the yaksha Manibhadra, who, according to a variety of textual and epigraphic references, was a tutelary deity of merchants and travellers, and was especially worshipped in important trading centres. It may be added that the torso of a figure of Kubera (king of the yakshas) was found in Parkham village, and a relief figure of the same deity was obtained from somewhere in the same district (ibid.: 179). Two fragments of a colossal Yaksha image were found at Baroda, not far from Parkham which, when intact, must have been a towering figure, about 3.65m or so in height. Stylistically similar to the Parkham yaksha, it seems to belong to the same period or maybe a little earlier. Yaksha figures have also been discovered in a stratigraphic context in the course of excavations at Mathura (IAR 1976-7: 55). Plate 2 The Parkham yaksha (courtesy: Archaeological Survey of India).</page><page sequence="8">Cults and shrines in early historical Mathura 385 The worship of female deities associated with fertility and childbirth, protectresses of children who had the power of warding off disease, is an important aspect of popular Hinduism all over India today. In the early historical period, these functions were associated with a number of yakshis. A colossal 1.57m x 1.06m red sandstone image in the Mathura Museum represents the yakshi Lavaya seated on a wicker stool. The image was found at Jhinga-ka-nagla and can be assigned on stylistic grounds to the second/first century BC. Of the same period is the fragment of a colossal yakshi standing under an Ashoka tree that was obtained from Vrindaban (Srivastava and Misra 1973: 84). The synopsis of the 1974-5 Mathura excavations refers to two yakshi figures found in Period III levels (c. first-third century AD) (IAR 1974-5: 50). Yakshis are also very well represented in smaller stone and terracotta statuettes of the Mathura area. The colossal stone yakshas and the profusion of smaller stone and terracotta yakshas and yakshis indicate the importance of the yaksha cult both in the public and in the domestic domain. Although the earliest stone images of these deities can be dated to the third/second centuries BC, they seem to represent cults whose antiquity goes back to an earlier time, difficult to estimate. Colossal images of yakshas and yakshis disappear around the turn of the millennium, but small statuettes continue to be found in large numbers thereafter. Their worship had not died out but had been pushed from the public into the domestic sphere. The worship of nagas and nagis Another major aspect of iconic worship in the Mathura area was the worship of serpent deities - nagas and nagis (or naginis) - who, like the yakshas, were associated with water and fertility. Such images were found from different parts of the district such as Chhargaon, Khamni, Itauli and Baldev, all of which belong stylistically to the early centuries AD (Vogel 1908-9). Vogel noted that ancient naga images in the Mathura district were being worshipped as Dauji or the god Baladeva/Balarama and that modern images of Balarama which were being manufactured in large numbers at Mathura and Brindaban were in fact imitations of ancient naga images. He suggested that the plough-wielding, snake-canopied god Baladeva may have been a naga deity who came to be absorbed into the Krishna cult. The imposing nature of some of the naga images belonging to the early centuries AD and the technical finesse of their carving make it apparent that they represent more than a simple folk cult. The impressive seven-hooded Chhargaon naga image (dated in year 40 of the Kanishka era, i.e. AD 118, in king Huvishka's reign) was a majestic 2.33m in height (Plate 3). It bears an inscription recording its installation near a tank by Senahastin and Bhondaka. The Jamalpur mound yielded a profusion of Buddhist remains and was the site of a major vihara (monastery) established by the Kushana king Huvishka in AD 125. An inscription on a stone slab discovered here refers to its installation in the place sacred to Dadhikarna, lord of the nagas, by the Chandaka brothers, chief among whom was Nandibala, the sons of the actors or dancers of Mathura. The date on the inscription, tentatively read as the year 26 of the Kanishka era (AD 104), suggests that a naga shrine existed at this place before the setting up of the Buddhist vihara. An inscription on a pillar base, presumed to have belonged to the Buddhist vihara, records that this was the gift of</page><page sequence="9">386 Upinder Singh Plate 3 The Chhargaon Naga (courtesy: Archaeological Survey of India). Devila, a servant of the shrine of Dadhikarna. The fact that the donative inscription of the Dadhikarna shrine and Buddhist donative records here and elsewhere describe their aim in similar terms - the promotion of the welfare and happiness of all sentient beings - indicates an element of shared religious vocabulary and sentiment. Many other images and inscriptions indicate that the naga cult enjoyed considerable patronage in the Mathura region in the early centuries AD (Luders 1961: 38, No. 12; 126-7, No. 95; 148-9, No. 102; 164, No. 124; 208-9, No. 182). The inscribed base of a statuette of a standing naga figure was reportedly found on the Bhuteshwar mound. The pedestal of a headless naga statuette, inscribed with the name 'Dadhikarna' was recovered from the Yamuna. An epigraph on the pedestal of a naga image accompanied by two nagis from the mound of Ral Bhandar (c. 13km north-west of Mathura) refers to a tank and a garden having been made for the revered Bhuminaga.

An inscription on a sculpted stone slab in the British Museum, originally from Mathura, possibly representing a naga and nagi, records the construction of a small temple (harmya) in a village. Like the yakshas and yakshis, the nagas and nagis were the focus of an ancient cult that was prevalent in many parts of the subcontinent, and which attracted the patronage of urban elites. The nagas and nagis too were gradually dethroned (in about the third century AD, a little later than the yakshas) in urban centres from their position as major focuses of exclusive worship in the public realm to become attendants of other deities and objects of worship in the domestic sphere. In the story of Krishna subduing the Kaliya naga we can perhaps see an allegorical reference to the ultimate victory of Vaishnavism over the once very popular naga cult. Pantheons old and new The turn of the millennium was a momentous time from the point of view of the religious history of ancient India. Coomaraswamy (1980: 36 ) argued persuasively that the worship of the yakshas and yakshis implied temples, puja (devotional worship with offerings) and a cult, and that the worship of yakshas and yakshis, nagas and nagis and goddesses was the natural source of the bhakti (devotional) elements that became so pervasive in Indian religions during the ensuing centuries. The period between c. 200 BC and AD 200 was a time of equipoise, when the older cults of the yakshas, nagas and goddesses jostled with the cults of newer brahmanical deities and pantheons, and held their ground. But, during the succeeding centuries, they were eventually displaced as major focuses of worship in the urban public domain by the deities associated with Puranic Hinduism. A rough method of assessing the relative importance of various brahmanical and non- brahmanical focuses of worship in the Mathura area is by collating the details of acquisition of stone sculptures in the catalogues of the Mathura Museum (Srivastava 1999; Srivastava and Misra 1973; Vogel 1910, updated by Agrawala 1949). These catalogues arrange the images according to type and dynastic periods; the entries under the 'Shunga' and 'Kushana' period headings are relevant here, roughly corresponding to c. 200 BC and AD 200 (see Table 3). It may be noted that the stone images are dominated by yakshas, yakshis, nagas and representations of Kubera (king of the yakshas), Hariti (a yakshi, consort of Kubera), the Matrikas (the Mothers) and Vasudhara (a goddess associated with wealth and prosperity, usually represented in association with a vase or a fish). These were clearly very popular during the period up to the second century AD, but there is a marked decline in representations of all of these in stone sculptures of subsequent centuries. V. S. Agrawala (1965) has pointed out that the iconographic conventions of images of many brahmanical deities were settled by the first century AD. The most numerous images from the Mathura area are those of Shiva, Vishnu, Surya (the sun god) and the goddesses Durga and Lakshmi. The Shaiva images include representations of the deity in the anthropomorphic or linga (phallic) forms and in a combination of the two (the mukha-lingas and vigraha lingas). One of the earliest representations is an architectural fragment found at Bhuteshwar (c.</page><page sequence="11">388 Upinder Singh Table 3 Number of stone images and reliefs Yakshas (including Kubera, sometimes with goddesses/yakshis, including Hariti) 57 Nagas and nagis 46 Shiva (in anthropomorphic and linga forms) 30 Vishnu 28 Matrikas 26 The yakshi Hariti 22 Durga (including Durga-Mahishasuramardini) 18 Surya 16 Lakshmi (including Gaja-Lakshmi) 15 Vasudhara 10 Brahma 4 Balarama 4 Ganesha 3 Agni 3 Garuda 5 Navagrahas 2 Karttikeya 2 Indra 2 River goddesses 2 Sarasvati (?) 1 Kinship triads depicting Vasudeva-Krishna, Ekanamsha and Balarama 1 Krishna lila 1 second century BC) showing the worship of a lingam on a platform under a pipal tree encircled by railing, by two-winged figures (Srivastava 1999: 47, GMM 52.3625) (Plate 4). Shiva images of first and second centuries AD indicate an already diverse (albeit formative) iconographic base. The early Mathura images depict Shiva alone or with the bull, Shiva with his consort Parvati, and in various forms including Chaturvyuha Shiva (Shiva with his three emanations), Ardhanarishvara (the god who is half woman) and Harihara (Shiva with Vishnu). The Vasudeva-Krishna cult was an important connecting link between Mathura and the brahmanical tradition. That Mathura was an important centre of the worship of the Vrishni heroes in the early centuries AD is reflected in kinship triads depicting Vasudeva- Krishna, his brother Baladeva or Balarama and their sister Ekanamsha. Their relative size and position indicate that initially Balarama was more important than Krishna. An inscription found in the terrace of a well at Mora (Luders 1937-8: 194) refers to the installation of images of the five viras (heroes) by a woman named Tosha during the reign of king Shodasa (i.e. in the late first century BC-early first century AD). Fragmentary sculptures of two male and one female figures were also found at Mora. The male figures may represent two of the Vrishni heroes. The inscription on the pedestal of the female statue, dated in the reign of the Kushana king Kanishka, suggests that it may have been commissioned and installed at the place by one of Tosha's descendants about a century later, suggesting a custom of the installation of donor images at religious shrines. Tosha is described as the wife of a kalavada of Mathura. The meaning of the term kalavada is unclear. Luders (ibid.: 202) translates it as a high-ranking official, while Sircar (1966: 139) suggests a possible connection with the Sanskrit kalyapala, a vintner.</page><page sequence="12">Cults and shrines in early historical Mathura 389 Another inscription (possibly originally from Mora), inscribed on a door-jamb, belonging to the reign of the ruler Shodasa, refers to a torana (gateway) and vedika (railing) which formed part of a mahasthana (a large temple) of Vasudeva. Pandit Radha Krishna's excavations at Mora resulted in the discovery of several fragments of very large inscribed bricks of the third/second century BC (Vogel 1911-12: 127). The legend on one of the bricks reads: 'Made by order of Yashamata, daughter of Brihasvatimita, the king's consort and the mother of living sons.' Archaeological evidence indicates that Mora was an important religious centre in early historical Mathura, and that the shrine or shrines here attracted the patronage of urban social and political elites such as Tosha and Yashamata over several centuries. The Kushana period marks an explosion in the number and varieties of Vaishnava images produced in Mathura, and the city becomes the premier centre of the creation and dissemination of Vaishnava plastic art (Srinivasan 1989: 390). Most frequent are the depictions of Vasudeva-Krishna, but there are also a large number of small stone statuettes of the god Vishnu (usually four-armed), Vishnu on garuda (the mythical bird who is his vehicle) and in anthropomorphic varaha (boar) form. The avatara (incarnation) concept is in its infancy, and the chaturvyuha (the four emanations of Vishnu) concept becomes visible in the late Kushana period. Reference may also be made to a colossal Narayana image found at Mathura (ibid.: 389). Among the goddesses at Mathura, apart from the anonymous 'mother goddesses', Matrikas and yakshis, the benevolent Lakshmi and the militant Durga stand out. Lakshmi is also depicted on the coins of local kings of Mathura, and appears in her Gaja-Lakshmi Plate 4 Architectural fragment with relief carving of winged creatures worshipping a Shiva linga.</page><page sequence="13">390 Upinder Singh form (flanked by two elephants) on coins of Rajuvula, Shodasa and Toranadasa (Singh 1989: 147, 150). At Sonkh, a relief carving of Lakshmi on an architectural fragment was found at pre-Kushana levels, and seems to be the oldest stone sculptural piece found at the site (Hartel 1993: 247) (Plate 5). That the worship of this goddess associated with good fortune and prosperity was not a local phenomenon is indicated by the discovery of a terracotta Gaja-Lakshmi plaque in the context of an apsidal temple in a late NBP level (Phase IV D, dated c. 200-50 BC) at the site of Atranjikhera, in Uttar Pradesh. Special note may be taken of representations in which deities who formed the focus of independent worship are associated with each other, for instance a slab showing Lakshmi along with Hariti and child, and a stele with representations of Kubera, Lakshmi and Hariti (Srivastava and Misra 1973: 70, Nos. 57.4349, 61.5371). A relief sculpture, 71" in height and 10" in length, assigned to the first century AD, depicts four figures standing with their hands in abhayamudra - Shiva-Ardhanarishvara, Vishnu, Gaja-Lakshmi and Kubera (Agrawala 1949: 142, GMM. No. 2520). We can see in such sculptures the earliest signs of pantheon formation. While iconic worship dominated religious practice in early historical Mathura, there are some indications of the remains of sacrificial activity as well, in the form of pits containing ash, animal bones and pottery discovered in residential structures (IAR 1974-5: 49). The more dramatic and unequivocal evidence of the performance of brahmanical sacrifices comes from the stone yupas (sacrificial posts) discovered at Isapur, on the left bank of the Yamuna, opposite the Vishrant Ghat. A girdle rope with a noose at the end, representing the rope to which the sacrificial animal was tied, is clearly carved on both pillars. An inscription on one of the pillars - dated in year 24 in the Kushana king Vasishka's reign and in pure Sanskrit - states that the pillar was set up by a Brahmana named Dronala while performing a sattra (sacrifice) of twelve nights (Luders 1961: 125-6; Vogel 1910-11: 40-8). The stone yupas of Isapur were evidently stone copies of the wooden posts actually used in the sacrifice; they are suggestive of a grand sacrifice and a yajamana who had considerable resources. That Isapur had diverse religious associations is indicated by the discovery of three fragmentary donative inscriptions, one on a Jaina image (Luders 1961: 124-5, Nos. 91-3). The variety of stone images found at sites such as Isapur from the early centuries AD to the early medieval period illustrates the diverse focuses of popular worship in the Mathura area. Sonkh The discoveries at the site of Sonkh include the remains of two ancient temples. Located in the south-western section of the excavated area, Apsidal Temple No. 1 was the central focus of the residential structures and streets around it. The temple, oriented roughly in an east-west direction, was a small structure, renovated and enlarged over time (Hartel 1993: 64-7). Roughly nine structural phases, belonging to the first and second centuries AD were identified. The temple began as a small squarish structure, about 3.05 x 3.30m. It developed into an apsidal structure, about 9.70 x 8.85m, standing on a raised platform, enclosed by a thick wall on its northern, western and southern sides, with a room-like structure in the entrance area on the eastern side. On the floor of the apse was a 60cm-high</page><page sequence="14">Cults and shrines in early historical Mathura 391 Plate 5 Laksmi standing on lotus (courtesy: National Museum, New Delhi). plinth covered with a slab, probably used as an altar for an image. A Matrika plaque (19 x 13.6 x 3.7cm) carved on mottled red sandstone was found on the floor at its base, and may have been the central cult image which was probably re-installed in the various structural phases (Hartel 1993: 245). A large number of plaques depicting Durga as Mahishasur- amardini were found in or around the temple. In its last structural phase, just before it fell into disuse, the apsidal shrine seems to have reverted to its squarish shape, measuring about 3.80 x 3.80m. Remains of the much more elaborate Apsidal Temple No. 2 were discovered 400m north of the main excavated area at Sonkh. The structural phases of the temple ranged from the beginning of the first century BC to the second century AD and clearly reflect a stage when brick was supplemented by stone in early temple architecture. In its most developed form (Hartel 1993: 413-17), the brick temple can be visualized standing high above the surrounding buildings on a 15 x 11.50m brick platform, with a pond to its east.</page><page sequence="15">392 Upinder Singh The apsidal cella had a vaulted roof, and a slanting wooden roof probably ran around the temple and covered the space between the cella and the surrounding row of brick pillars (Fig. 2). Hartel suggests that the vault carried pinnacles, probably green-glazed. The entrance was furnished with an arch-shaped carved stone tympanum above the doorway. To the north of the temple was a row of cells arranged on three sides of a courtyard. The entire temple complex was enclosed by a stone railing, for the most part carved on both sides. The beautifully carved remains of a stone gateway, consisting of two pillars supporting a superstructure of three architraves with voluted ends, were found on the southern side of the railing. An architectural fragment belonging to the bottom lintel of the gateway bears a relief carving of a naga and nagi seated on thrones, surrounded by attendants and people with hands folded in obeisance. This and the other depictions of nagas in stone sculptures and reliefs, terracotta naga figurines and moulds, inscriptions found in the temple area and the discovery of the top half of a four-sided, seven-hooded stone naga image (143cm in height up to the stumps of the thighs) leave no doubt that Apsidal Temple No. 2 was a magnificent naga temple. Sonkh thus provides evidence of an early historical multi-temple urban complex and reveals the architectural form of the shrines. It also proves that naga and Matrika images were worshipped in structural temples, and we can infer that many of the images found in and around Mathura were similarly enshrined and worshipped. The devakula at Mat In the village of Mat, on a mound covered with jungle, locally known as Tokri Tila, Pandit Radha Krishna made the dramatic discovery of a number of fragments of colossal images, three bearing inscriptions, some of which clearly represented Kushana royalty, including the emperor Kanishka. A broken image of a majestic monarch seated on a lion-throne had an inscription at the base between the feet. The inscription belongs on palaeographic grounds to the early years of Kanishka's reign or a little earlier (first century AD), and its reading and translation is not free from problems. But its purport is clear - it records the construction of a temple (devakula), garden, tank, well, assembly hall and a gateway during the reign of a Kushana king whose name cannot be read with certainty (perhaps 'Vema') (Luders 1963: 131-2, No. 98). A later Sanskrit inscription inscribed on the pedestal of a broken image (probably representing a Kushana prince), belonging to the reign of the Kushana king Huvishka, appears to record the repair of the temple mentioned in the earlier inscription. The last line of the inscription refers to some sort of provision being made for the Brahmanas, described as regular guests at the place (Luders 1961: 139- 40, No. 99). Radha Krishna's excavations at Mat (described in Vogel 1911-12: 120-2) revealed the traces of a rectangular plinth, 100ft x 59ft, with remains of steps leading up to it on the south east. Traces of a circular temple were identified on the western part of the plinth. South of the plinth were the masonry foundations of a rectangular enclosure which may have contained a series of rooms, and to the west were the remains of a tank, constructed of large bricks of the same dimensions as the temple, within which some naga and other images were found.</page><page sequence="16">Cults and shrines in early historical Mathura 393 Figure 2 A reconstruction of what Apsidal Naga Temple at Sonkh might have looked like (after Hartel 1993: 422). Was the devakula a shrine where deified kings were worshipped (of the kind mentioned in Bhasa's drama, the Pratima-natakam) or was it a royal temple dedicated to some other deity or deities, also housing images of Kushana royalty? Vogel was quite definite on the point that the royal images were found outside the shrine proper. Further, there was the discovery of the almost life-size lower half of a dhoti-clad standing image (1.12m height), accompanied by a dwarf behind which is a lion, which, according to V. S. Agrawala, could possibly represent the god Shiva. Agrawala (1949: 126-7, 152) also suggested that another fragmentary image found at Mat, depicting the lower half of a female figure standing against a lion couchant, could perhaps be identified as Durga. These two images would suggest that the Mat shrine was a Shaiva shrine, perhaps built during the time of Vima Kadphises, who is known from his coins to have been a devotee of Shiva. The Shaiva affiliations of the shrine are further supported by the reference to Sarva and Chandishvara (i.e. Shiva) in the preamble to an inscription (No. 99) found at Mat. The evidence from Mat has to be seen in conjunction with that from two sites in Afghanistan - Rabatak and Surkh Kotal. The former has yielded an important inscription</page><page sequence="17">394 Upinder Singh in the Bactrian language and script, reflecting the claims of Kushana kings to divine status (Mukherjee 1995). There is a striking similarity between the devakula at Mat and the bago lango at Surkh Kotal (Fussman 1989). At Surkh Kotal, the statues of the Kushana kings were found in situ, not in the cella, but in the south-eastern corner of the courtyard. While two of the temples at Surkh Kotal seem to have been fire temples, there is uncertainty about the cultic affiliations of Temple A. The fact that an (admittedly small in size) image depicting Shiva, Parvati and Nandi has been found at the site together with the evidence of trishulas (tridents) engraved in a later period on the stone steps of the shrine's staircase is strongly suggestive that the main cult image in Temple 'A' was Shaiva. This would tie in with Agrawala's interpretation of the sculptural fragments at Mat with Shiva and Parvati, although the interpretation is not free from problems and there are other possibilities (Rosenfield 1993: 150-1). Whether the tantalizing but inconclusive evidence from Mat and Surkh Kotal reflects a Kushana tradition of royally endowed monumental temples where deified kings, or gods, or both, may have been worshipped, we are looking at a striking innovation in the theory and practice of kingship. Political elites and the patronage of Brahmanas The phenomenon of the Kushana kings spreading their munificence in different directions and the reputation of Kanishka as a patron of Buddhism have distracted attention from certain other facts, which anchor the kings of this dynasty to the brahmanical tradition. Although there are a handful of early Sanskrit inscriptions belonging to the first century BC, the use of Sanskrit, or a dialect very close to Sanskrit, as the language of epigraphs really took off in the first century AD, during the time of the Kshatrapas (cf. the inscriptions of the time of the Kshatrapa Shodasa) and the early Kushanas. Mathura seems to have been an important epicentre of this phenomenon. During the Kushana period, the use of Sanskrit gradually spread to Buddhist donative records as well (Salomon 1998: 87-8). The circuit between political elites, urban elites and Brahmanas is well revealed by a stone inscription found in a field opposite the Chaurasi Jaina Temple in Mathura in a well called Lal Kuan (Konow 1931-2). The inscription, in mixed Prakrit and Sanskrit, refers to the eastern hall of merit (punya-shala-prachini) being given as a permanent endowment under the custom of akshaya-nivi (an investment, the capital of which could not be touched) by a person described as the Kanasarukamana, lord of Kharasalera, and a Vakanapati. The donation was a monetary one - 500 coins called puranas were invested with a guild whose name is not clear and 550 puranas with a guild of samitakaras (perhaps flour-makers). From the interest of this endowment, 100 Brahmanas were to be served food in the open hall and a specified number of food items were to be provided to destitute, hungry and thirsty people. The fact that the inscription is dated in a Macedonian month of Gorpiaios in the year 28 suggests that the donor was a foreigner from the north- west. Judging from the fact that the merit accruing from the gift was to accrue to the Kushana emperor Huvishka, the donor seems to have been a subordinate of this Kushana king. The depiction of a great variety of deities on Kushana coins is conventionally interpreted as a reflection of their religious eclecticism, catholicism, or as indicative of an attitude of</page><page sequence="18">Cults and shrines in early historical Mathura 395 'toleration' (see, e.g., Mukherjee 1988: 289-90 ). Such an interpretation is premised on a misperception of ancient Indian cults as mutually exclusive, aggressively antagonistic religious denominations. It also displays a lack of reflection on the religious dimensions of royal policy and the political dimension of royal religious patronage. The dispersed patronage and the impressive variety of religious symbols that the Kushanas sought to identify themselves with can best be interpreted as a version of Hocart's (1970[1936]: 89) idea of 'incorporative kingship' associated with polities that were not highly centralized, in which the king incorporated the divinities worshipped not only by his subordinates but also his subjects. Seen in this way, Kushana policy was just an exaggerated version of the royal policies pursued by many other dynasties of ancient India. In later centuries, even in the case of dynasties that adopted consistent sectarian symbols on their coins and seals, royal patronage was not generally restricted by narrow sectarian boundaries. Conclusions The archaeological evidence from the Mathura area between c. 200 BC and AD 200 clearly indicates the importance of goddesses, yakshas, nagas and deities associated with Puranic Hinduism, in both temple and domestic contexts. The images display a certain level of iconographic standardization, and it is clear that certain cults had a trans-regional importance. While the earliest structural temples at Sonkh indicate they were an integral part of the urban settlement, at Mat there is striking evidence of a royal shrine, situated distant and aloof from the main settlement. The post-third-century period saw the displacement of these old cults and the eventual triumph of the brahmanical tradition. The historical processes that lay behind the multiple religious accommodations, incorporations, displacements and marginalizations are not easy to identify. At a general level, the features that gave brahmanism its position of dominance were the social dominance and prestige of the Brahmanas within the caste hierarchy and their links with political power. Royal patronage did play an important role in defining dominant cults, not as much by direct patronage of religious establishments, but indirectly through the patronage of Brahmanas. The fact that dynasties with as varied origins and backgrounds as the Kushanas in the north and the Satavahanas in the Deccan extended patronage towards Brahmanas points to an underlying thread that helps explain some of the patterns in the religious history of ancient and early medieval India. In spite of the many changes in the religious landscape of Mathura over the centuries, what is equally striking are certain elements of continuity. A large, eighteenth-century Shiva temple marks the spot of the second-century BC Shaiva shrine at Bhuteshwar. Even more striking is the evidence that, while the older cults and their images were jostled out of the urban milieu ('ruralized') by the gods and goddesses of Puranic Hinduism, they were not exterminated. Sometimes, the old images were reinterpreted. The Nagaraja once enshrined in Apsidal Temple No. 2 at Sonkh is still being worshipped in the village, but as the goddess Chamunda. Old naga images are today worshipped as Balarama. The nagas and the goddesses associated with fertility, children and the warding off of diseases have held their ground in villages across India. But the most amazing reflection of the</page><page sequence="19">396 Upinder Singh Plate 6 The modern Parkham yaksha. continuity and resilience of the older cults in popular Hinduism comes from the village of Parkham. The imposing colossal image of the yaksha, which once stood next to the village tank, was removed from the village to the Mathura Museum many years ago. But, in the month of Magh (January), a 'Jakhaiya Mela' (i.e. yaksha fair) is held in the village, and hundreds of people from surrounding villages converge at Parkham to worship the Jakhaiya. On this occasion, a small yaksha image - a poor substitute for the original - is brought out, placed in a makeshift enclosure next to the tank, and worshipped (Plate 6). The broken right hand of the colossal Parkham yaksha was probably raised in the protection-granting abhaya mudra. His diminutive modern incarnation raises his left hand in what looks like a cheerful wave. Nevertheless, on three consecutive Sundays in January in Parkham, the yaksha regains some of the importance he once enjoyed in the Mathura area over two thousand years ago. Notes 1 The Sonkh sequence is largely based on dynastic/political phases, which, according to the excavators, could in many cases be identified on the basis of numismatic finds and</page><page sequence="20">Cults and shrines in early historical Mathura 397 which, according to them, provided clear dividing lines between the various archaeological levels. The term 'Shunga cultural phase' is used instead of 'Shunga phase'. This is because of the possible objection that the rule of the Shungas did not extend to Mathura. The use of this term is the reason why there is a discrepancy between the chronology given in this table and the chronology of political history. 2 The making and use of such artefacts for household rituals continued till fairly recent times in Bengal (Dilip K.
