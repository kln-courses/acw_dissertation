<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vicente Ramos. Miguel Hernandez. Madrid. Gredos. 1973. 378 pages. Making frequent use of both primary and secondary sources, Ramos begins by characterizing the atmo- sphere of Orihuela and presenting the biographies of Hernandez and his friend "Ramon Sije." Well over half the volume is devoted to a description of the themes and attitudes found in Hernandez's work, sup- ported by brief quotations from that work. This description is generally sound, although it may over- stress the poet's vision of anthropomorphic nature and downplay his tragic outlook. The detailed description of themes, the abundance of quotations and of biographical data and the ex- tensive bibliography will make this book useful back- ground material for a student of Hernandez's work; the volume will not be of much help, however, in obtaining an understanding of the importance of Hernandez as an original poet and creative artist.
