Harle's excellent Gupta Sculpture, Indian Sculpture of the Fourth to Sixth Cen- turies A.D., Oxford [1974] for the appear- ance of a further comprehensive and more detailed study of the art which evolved in northern and western India during Gupta rule, or, more precisely, from the reign of Candragupta's succes- sor, Samudragupta, to the immediate post-Gupta period. Joanna Williams has taken on this task with courage and con- viction. The result is a work which is in many ways as unique and seminal as the art it investigates. The book is organised into chapters which treat the subject chronologically. After the Introduction and a useful dis- cussion entitled 'The Point of Depar- ture', Chapters II-V begin with an indispensable resume of historical back- ground and then proceed to deal with the art of the areas which fall within the periods concerned, which are: A.D. 370-415, 415-485, 485-550 and, charting the beginnings of the mediaeval phases, A.D. 550-650. It is satisfying to find that each chapter has a conclusion, and that the whole work has an epilogue. The reader will also find an appendix on 'Ajanta and the Art of the Vakatakas' (treated separately, in my view sadly, to conform with current trends in scholar- ship), a relevant bibliography, and an index (regrettably only of proper names, not ideas), followed by the 268 plates, the quality of which varies, but is on the whole acceptable. It is important to remark that the prose is readable and intelligently direct. Most points are made succinctly. A for- midable amount of scholarship is crisply presented, and teachers can safely recommend this book to their students: it is reliable and at the same time allows for discussion and encourages research into more specialised topics. The paperback edition is within the financial means of most students. I do not like the wide- page, double-column format, but this is a purely personal prejudice; the book is not big enough for deep shelving, and the alternative way to file it is vertically, on its spine. In her 184 pages of text, the author has not been able to dilate upon inter- pretations of the many architectural and iconographical forms mentioned. How- ever, some iconographical schemes of temples and stupas are briefly outlined, and these lists are exceptionally valuable. Despite evidence of a remarkably clear vision of Gupta India behind the writing, the book lacks a certain depth and takes on the character of a survey; this is what was required, but a satisfactory grasp of essential religious principles is lost in the haste to move on to the next site, the next sculpture. Of course one should not expect to have it both ways in a single study, yet I found the treatment of com- plex subjects such as the Visvarupa form of Visnu and the Caturmukha-linga too cursory. One is hurried along, aware of the need for continuity but still perplexed about the reasons for such widespread, intensely religious sculptural activity. If depth is necessarily lacking, however, sensitivity is not, and at the end of the book the reader has a renewed sense of familiarity with the Gupta and immedi- ate post-Gupta age. Those who wish to go deeper could. have no better starting point than this work. The occasional assumption - for example, that the association of the four faces of a Caturmukha-linga with certain elements is proven by reference to earlier anthropomorphic images in which an emanatory figure wields sun and moon as symbols of akasa (pp. 112-13) - which cannot be justified, does unfortunately jolt one's concentration in places. But one's general appreciation of this volume outweighs these matters. There will be grounds for dispute as to dates, inevitably, although I found Williams's reasoning acceptable in nearly all cases. Overall, I was particularly grateful for the ever-present, but not intrusive man- ner in which throughout the determined narrative the reader is kept aware of the political and socio-religious background, geographical relationships and the pres- sures on the artist.
