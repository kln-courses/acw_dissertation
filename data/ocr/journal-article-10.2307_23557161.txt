<plain_text><page sequence="1">ABORTION AND THE RIGHT TO LIFE I shall attempt to defend the following moderate view on the question of abortion. At some nonarbitrary point be tween conception and birth it is morally permissible to destroy a developing human being, and after this point is reached it is no longer morally permissible. The large prob lem for any moderate is to give arguments to show that this cutoff point, whatever it might turn out to be, is a nonarbi trary one. It is not enough just to choose a point in time, say six weeks, or twelve weeks, or seven months; for the mere passage of time is not a morally relevant consideration. If one does choose some calendar date, then one must show why that date is morally significant. Nor is it enough to support the choice of some calendar date to indicate a prop erty such as that of being an embryo, or being a fetus, or being viable, unless one is prepared to argue that the pos session of one of these properties gives a developing indi vidual a right to life.1 I shall later argue for what I consider to be such relevant properties, but I shall begin with an analysis of the concept of a right. This preliminary task will turn out to be crucial, since those who condemn abortion on moral grounds usu ally do so because it violates an individual's right to life; whereas, those who hold that there is nothing morally im permissible about abortion claim that no individual's right to life is being violated at all. In what follows I shall there fore assume both: (1) where there is no right to life, then — all else being equal — there is no moral case to be made against abortion as such, and (2) where there is a right to life, any case for abortion must present considerations weighty enough to override this right. *"1975 by Social Theory and Practice, Volume 3, Number 4 381</page><page sequence="2">382 Social Theory and Practice Making these two assumptions frees us from accepting the common claim that whatever has a right to life is a person.2 We can grant that people do have a right to live. But is it so clear that only people have this right? Other pri mates, and perhaps even lower organisms, might also have this right. But whatever we decide on these further ques tions, we can interpret a conservative's position on abortion as being, not that zygotes are persons, but merely that they are entities possessing the right to life. It will then be ir relevant to object that, since zygotes are not counted as persons on census reports or tax returns, they therefore have no right to live. Since it would needlessly warp the way we speak if we classified individuals other than human chil dren and adults as people, any analysis of having a right to life in terms of personhood would be untrue to our lan guage. An adequate analysis of what it is to have a right can be given without referring to people at all. Before presenting my analysis I must first emphasize that a right should not be defined as some simple property at tributable only to independently existing entities. Ifit were, then it would be false a priori to say that the dead and the unborn have rights; and saying this without further argu ment would be counterintuitive. Nor is the term "right" to be viewed as a name for some particular entity. In this respect it is like the word "lurch." If it is said of a rejected maiden that she was left in the church and left in the lurch all on the same Sunday, it does not follow that there were two places in which she was left. And when we say that we did it in the nick of time, or did it for John's sake, it does not follow that there are such things as nicks and sakes for us to discover. Talk of rights is similar to talk of lurches, nicks, and sakes. We can only explain what such terms mean within some wider context. A more important consideration is that the correct analysis will, in a sense, turn out to be trivial. That is, no substantive moral conclusion will flow immediately from it. But this is as it should be. No mere analysis of value terms should itself reveal the nonvalue property, or properties,</page><page sequence="3">Abortion 383 that anything must possess in order to have aright to life. No such properties will be directly revealed by my analysis, but that will be in its favor. My only concern is that the analysis be correct. Any arguments concerning what properties give an individual a right to life must be offered separately. The analysis is simply this: A has a right to X if and only if it would be wronging A to deprive A of X. Note that the analysis is completely general and is meant to apply whenever any singular term is substituted for "A" and any concrete or abstract noun is substituted for "X." I shall, however, be concerned mainly with cases in which "A" is replaced by a name or description of a living organism and "X" is replaced by the term "life." Some possible counterexamples to the analysis must now be neutralized. One might first object that the condition of the analysans is not sufficient, since there are some duties that do not entail rights. For example, though one has a duty to be benevolent, no one has a right to benevolence. My answer to this consists, first, in denying that one has a duty to be benevolent in any sense stronger than that of saying that one ought to be benevolent. That one ought to be benevolent, it seems clear, does not entail that anyone has a right to benevolence. But neither does it entail that one would be wronging an individual by depriving him of be nevolence. The injunction to be benevolent urges the adop tion of a general attitude, but it does not entail that we wrong an individual who fails to be the object of that attitude. If it did, then people would be wronging others whenever they did anything solely for themselves, for when we do some thing for ourselves we deprive someone else of being the object of some benevolent act of ours. The counterexamples more crucial for my analysis are those in which one denies that the analysans is necessary for A's having a right to X, for what is really important for me to defend is the view that wherever there is a right, there is a moral prohibition. One objection to my claim is that, al though some rights entail specific prohibitions, not all of them do; and though it may be true to say that A has a right to</page><page sequence="4">384 Social Theory and Practice X, this is not to say that it would be wronging A to deprive him of X. For example, I might have the right to the ten dollars you owe me, but one need not be wronging me if one prevented me from getting ten dollars from you, since get ting ten dollars from you without your consent would be stealing. The answer to this objection is that it confuses a general moral prohibition with what constitutes wronging another in specific circumstances. The case mentioned is a conflict case. I might have a right to the ten dollars in your pocket, since you owe it to me; but if I take it from you without your consent, then I violate your right of personal possession. Here is a case, then, in which you are wronging me by depriving me of that money, and I would be wronging you if I took it from you. This does nothing to damage my claim that wherever there is a right there is a moral prohibi tion, since here there are two prohibitions. The same sort of answer can be given to those, such as Michael Tooley, who would object that the analysans does not give a necessary condition for having a right to X unless it includes reference to the desire of the agent for X.3 A sample of this sort of objection is that, even when A has a right to live, it would not be wronging A to allow him to take his own life in case A has the rational desire to commit suicide. But this is another conflict case in which a person's right to life conflicts with his own right to liberty. If we think that we do what we ought in allowing A to take his own life when he rationally wishes to do so, then this is because we think that his right to liberty, in this case, has won out over his right to life. Here we would still wrong A to some degree by permitting him to take his life, although we would wrong him worse by not doing so. Since the statement of my analy sans is meant to express a general moral prohibition, one that can be overridden in its application to particular cases, the objection does not touch it. But what of the case in which A asks me to destroy some thing else to which he has a right? Does this show that there are some cases in which A has a right to X, but that I am not wronging A at all by depriving him of X? Not at all, since this is also a conflict case. One always wrongs another in some measure by depriving him of something to which he actu ally has a right, even when this prohibition is outweighed</page><page sequence="5">Abortion 385 by other considerations in the specific circumstances. Here such considerations might be that you ought to be loyal to a friend in doing what he asks you to do. There are also other sorts of cases in which one's rights can be relinquished. For example, one can give up the rights to one's possessions simply by offering them, in the appropriate circumstances, to another. But when a person gives away something to which he had a right, he does, by his very act, lose his right to it; and so one would then not be depriving him of that thing at all. The most important point of my analysis is that an indi vidual has a right to X if and only if it would be wronging that individual to deprive it of X. To say this is crucially different from analyzing one's right to X in terms of its being wrong of anyone to deprive that individual of X. The latter formulation would be too broad, in that it would attribute rights to individuals where no such rights exist. For exam ple, it would be wrong of anyone to deprive Michelangelo's statue of David of its head, because that would destroy a valuable work of art. But we should not wish to say that Michelangelo's David thereby has a right to its head. What we do wish to say is that art lovers have a right to view the unmutilated statue, but this is to say that it would be wrong ing them if anyone were to deprive them of this pleasure. Perhaps we should also want to say that Michelangelo him self has the right to having his works preserved intact, but that is to say that it would be wronging him to destroy his work. This feature of my analysis will turn out to be of paramount importance in arguing against those who con demn abortion on the grounds that it would wrong God, or wrong childless couples seeking to adopt children. Perhaps abortions do create such wrongs, but this just shows that those who are wronged have certain rights. It does nothing to show that an aborted fetus has the right to life, for this can only be shown by arguing that the fetus itself was wronged by depriving it of life. If my analysis is sound, then as a moderate I still face the problem of showing what property, or properties, give an</page><page sequence="6">386 Social Theory and Practice individual a right to life. Let me now merely state what I take one of these required properties to be. Simply put, it is the property of consciousness. I mean nothing esoteric by this, but just the ability to experience pleasure and pain, or any one of various sensations, or to have desires and feel ings, or to be the subject of any other mental state or process. On this account, to be conscious does not require that one be aware that one is in a particular conscious state, or even that one be aware that one is conscious at all. Consciousness, for me, does not entail ^//-consciousness, but only involves being the subject of some mental predicate.4 So if we can determine whether consciousness is present merely by be havioral evidence, which I think is possible, then we can also say that there is some time before birth that a fetus comes to possess consciousness. I do not know what that time is. That is for physiologists eventually to determine on the basis of sophisticated testing, perhaps on the basis of the sort of electrical activity present in the brain of the fetus. But there have already been other tests performed that allow us to estimate roughly the time at which consciousness is pre sent. These tests show that a fetus reacts voluntarily to painful stimuli shortly after eight weeks, that spontaneous movements may occur before ten weeks, and that desire is later evidenced by the ability of the fetus to suck its thumb. So if consciousness is the only property required for a living individual to have a right to life, and if the present be havioral evidence is accepted as indicating the time at which consciousness appears, then it would be morally wrong to abort a fetus but morally permissible to abort a mere embryo. There is a problem, however, in taking consciousness alone to be the property that gives an individual a right to life. For if this is the only relevant property, then we seem forced to say that any of the lower animals that possess consciousness also possess the right to life. But yet there seems to be something more involved which sets any human being apart from dogs and cats and which gives the former a more significant right to life. I think that something more is required, and I shall presently reveal what it is; but first I shall comment on how misguided is the claim that kittens, puppies, and the newborn of other lower species entirely lack the right to life.</page><page sequence="7">Abortion 387 This claim is made by Tooley, who says that although it is worse to kill a human adult than to torture him for an hour, it would be worse to torture a newborn kitten than to kill it.5 In fact, Tooley says that one would commit no serious moral offense at all in killing the kitten, but one would be hei nously evil in torturing it. For Tooley, this means that new born animals have a right not to be tortured, but not a right to life.6 The trouble with Tooley's claim is that it rests on biased evidence. In determining whether it is better for a man to be tortured for an hour, rather than killed, he im agines what that man would prefer to have happen. But in asking which alternative is worse in the case of the kitten, he does not imagine what that kitten might prefer. Of course, he cannot ask the kitten, as he can the man, but that does not prove that the kitten has no preferences at all. In fact, there seems to be good behavioral evidence for the view that mature animals can express their preferences and that, given a choice, they would prefer torture to death. A case in point is that of the trapped beaver who chews off his leg rather than starve to death. In the case of newborn kittens, no expression of such a preference is possible, but this is no reason to decide the kitten's fate on the basis of what we might prefer for it. This is not to say that Tooley considers no lower animals to possess a right to life. He actually thinks that mature cats and dogs might be self-conscious, and so, on that criterion, he classifies such animals with adult human beings.7 On the other hand, he groups human fetuses and infants with the fetuses and the young of other species as failing to have a right to life because they lack self-consciousness. But such a grouping has no intuitive appeal. What needs explaining is why we think that human fetuses, infants, and adults have a more significant right to life than do, respectively, the fetuses, neonates, and adults of the nonhuman species. On Tooley's criterion of self-consciousness, if a grown cat has this property, then that cat has just as significant a right to life as an adult human. But that is just what is so counterin tuitive. It might appear, however, that I am even worse off than Tooley with my criterion of consciousness. How am I to explain why we take it to be morally worse to kill a man than</page><page sequence="8">388 Social Theory and Practice to kill a cat? My answer to this requires me to appeal to various degrees of consciousness and to our belief that human consciousness is far richer and more complex than that of the nonhuman species. If this belief is true, then the various degrees of complexity and richness found in one's consciousness would correspond to the various degrees of injustice done to a conscious individual by destroying it. Such an appeal, however, does not solve the problem of explaining, on my account, why we consider it a more seri ous injustice to kill a human infant than to kill a baby chim panzee, and a more serious wrong to abort a human fetus rather than a chimp fetus. For the actual states of conscious ness enjoyed by a human infant seem on a par with those of the baby chimp, and the chimp fetus seems to have no less consciousness than does a human fetus. To explain the difference here, recourse to one's actual states of consciousness is not enough. Consciousness is a necessary condition for having a right to life in the degree possessed by human adults, but it is not sufficient. To pre vent equating the right to life of a human fetus with that of a chimp fetus, one must also mention the potentiality for having the sort of mental life enjoyed by a human adult and not by an adult chimpanzee. That is, a developing indi vidual must not only actually possess a bare consciousness, but must also possess potentially that heightened con sciousness necessary for learning a language, creating and enjoying art, music, and literature, and pursuing all those activities that are distinctively human. For an individual to possess such a property potentially is just to come to have that property in the normal course of its development. Since baby chimps and chimp fetuses do not possess such a prop erty of heightened consciousness, even potentially, whereas human fetuses and infants do, the former lack the more significant and serious right to life possessed by the latter. My case therefore depends upon the use of a potentiality principle. This priniciple is included in the following for mulation of conditions that underlie any individual's having a distinctively human right to life: There is some unknown property P, possessed</page><page sequence="9">Abortion 389 human fetuses and infants such that: (1) There is a scien tific law L to the effect that any organism with P will normally come to possess a distinctively human con sciousness at some later time. (2) Given the lawlike rela tionship between P and a distinctively human conscious ness, anything possessing both P and a basic, rudimentary consciousness has a right to life in the degree possessed by an adult human. (3) If P were not related to a distinc tively human consciousness in this lawlike way, then the possession of P itself would not suffice to give anything possessing P a right to life. (4) Even granting the lawlike connection between P and a distinctively human con sciousness, the possession of P alone does not suffice to grant its possessor a right to life.8 The inclusion of condition (4) highlights the difference between my moderate position and that of a conservative. For a conservative, the possession of P alone is sufficient to insure its possessor a right to life. Since the potentiality for a distinctively human consciousness was there since the time of conception, the conservative concludes that a zygote has a right to life. On my view the zygote has the requisite potentiality, but no actual consciousness; and, since the actual possession of some conscious state is required to have any right to life at all, the zygote does not have a right to life. On the other hand, killing a grown cat or even a newborn kitten is morally wrong to some degree; whereas it is not morally wrong at all to abort a human embryo before it reaches consciousness. Though my position differs markedly from that of the con servative, it still relies on the potentiality principle. The question now concerns whether we ought to accept such a potentiality as being relevant to the possession of a distinc tively human right to life. Tooley has argued that such a potentiality is not relevant. His argument turns on accepting what he calls the moral symmetry principle, which can be expressed as follows:</page><page sequence="10">390 Social Theory and Practice Let C be a causal process that normally leads to E. Let A be an action that initiates C, and B an action that stops C with minimal effort before E occurs. Assume that A and B do not have further consequences, and that E is the only morally significant result of the process C. Then, if we assume the same motivation of the agent in both cases, there is no moral difference between intentionally per forming B and intentionally refraining from performing A.9 I shall not give Tooley's own counterexample to show how the acceptance of the moral symmetry principle fal sifies the potentiality principle, since his example depends on his assumption that newborn animals lack any right to life. But his point can also be expressed by the following instantiations. Let E be an individual's coming to have a distinctively human adult consciousness. (It does not matter whether or not the individual actually is a human adult.) Let C be the natural gestation process that normally leads from the fertilization of a human ovum to the final result E. Let A fie the sexual act which initiates C. Let B be the act of destroying the individual in question before E occurs. Let the motivation of the agent be the same: the agent does not wish to undergo the trouble of raising a child to maturity. According to the moral symmetry principle, then, there is no moral difference between intentionally destroying the in dividual before E occurs and intentionally refraining from the action A which initiated the process. If the moral symmetry principle is true, it is clear what it does to one who accepts the potentiality principle. It would force one who said that killing a newborn infant was morally wrong to say, as well, that it was just as morally wrong to refrain from the sexual act which produced that infant. But since we do not consider the refraining from such a sexual act to be wrong at all, we should have to admit that the potentiality principle is false. The natural way to look at this example, however, in volves saying, not that it falsifies the potentiality principle, but that it falsifies the moral symmetry principle. But is there any independent evidence which clearly shows the latter principle to be false? Here is one sort of counterexam</page><page sequence="11">Abortion 391 pie. Consider C to be the causal process leading to E, which is Jack's taking Jill to the cinema. Let A be Jack's telephon ing Jill to ask her for a date. Let B be Jack's not getting out of bed on the day he was to take Jill to the cinema. Assume that A and B have no further consequences and that E is the only significant result of the process C. Now the moral symmetry principle would have us say, if we assume Jack's motivation to be the same in both cases, that refraining from telephon ing Jill in the first place is no less wrong than later breaking the date by staying in bed. Let us assume that Jack's motiva tion is the same in both cases: he just does not want to take Jill to the cinema. It seems clear in this case, however, given Jack's motivation, that refraining from telephoning Jill is the right thing to do, and making the date and later breaking it is the wrong thing to do. A similar counterexample can be constructed concerning the circumstances in which a soldier is the only one to volunteer for what he knows to be a dangerous mission. Here too, one's refraining from volunteering because one is frightened is not morally culpable. But if one volunteers, gets halfway through the mission, and then refrains from completing it, that action would be considered blamewor thy; and this is so even if the consequences of one's failing to complete the mission would be exactly the same as the consequences resulting from one's failing to volunteer in the first place. These examples do not show that there are no cases in which the moral symmetry principle is applicable. If a per son is constructing a cobalt bomb, then refraining from initiating the project might be just as praiseworthy as re fraining to continue it. And if the process is that of seeking a cure for cancer, then refraining from beginning the process might be just as blameworthy as terminating the process once it is started. But in a large number of cases the moral symmetry principle yields the wrong answer, and abortion is one of those cases.10 The gestation process seems analog ous to the process begun by volunteering for a mission. Just as there is a time between one's volunteering and one's actual undertaking of the mission in which one is not blamed for refusing to go, so there is a time between fertil ization and the stage of the conscious fetus when it is mor ally permissible to undergo an abortion.</page><page sequence="12">392 Social Theory and Practice In defending the potentiality principle, however, can one really stop short of defending the conservative position which attributes the right to life to zygote? I have claimed that potentiality alone in a developing organism is not enough to have us grant it a right to life and that a rudimen tary consciousness is also required. How plausible this claim is can only be decided by the defense one gives for saying that actual consciousness is also necessary. My de fense for this claim will consist in showing, first, that none of the other cutoff points usually mentioned by nonconserva tives are plausible, and, second, that there are cogent coun terexamples to the conservative view that takes mere poten tiality for human experience to be the only condition re quired for attributing to an individual the right to life. I shall now conduct the first part of my defense, which consists of a criticism of other moderate and radical views. A radical view is defended by Michael Tooley, who holds that the cutoff point is reached when an individual comes to possess the property of self-consciousness. To possess this property is to have the concept of a self as a continuing subject of experiences and other mental states and also to believe that one is such a self.11 Tooley's is an extreme position in that it sanctions, not only abortion, but also infanticide. Psychologists tell us that a child does not come to possess the concept of a self until after it has reached the age of at least one or two years. If so, then on Tooley's criterion it would be morally permissible to kill a child before it reached that stage. Though Tooley does not flinch from this result, the almost unanimous opinion of mankind is that this constitutes murder. Furthermore, there are some human adults who cannot make sense of the concept of a self as a continuing subject of experiences and other mental states; and, since they believe that there is no such concept, they also refuse to believe that they are such selves. If we take Hume at his word, he could not make sense of such a concept because he could not experience such a self, but only some perception or other. Hume therefore did not believe that he was such a self, and so, if Tooley were correct, it would have been morally permissible to kill</page><page sequence="13">Abortion 393 Hume in the midst of his writing the Treatise. There are also those who can understand Tooley's concept of a self, yet who deny that such a concept applies to them. So they, too, refuse to believe that they are such selves. Extreme be haviorists might fall into this category; and, since Tooley's account shows that they do not have a serious right to life, it would be morally permissible to kill them all off, as well.12 There are others who claim that birth itself is the cutoff point. But this would mean holding that there is a significant moral difference between the fetus of eight months and the newborn infant. The only nonspatial difference here, how ever, is perhaps that of weight, and this is no more a basis for attributing a right to life than is the color of one's hair. The only other difference is spatial: the eight month old fetus is inside the mother's uterus and the infant is outside. But this difference in location is morally insignificant. If we are involved in an automobile accident and, through no fault of my own, I wind up with my little finger in your mouth and unable to extricate it, this still gives you no right to bite down on my finger as hard as you can just because it is inside your mouth and not outside it. Others have opted for viability as the cutoff point. But it is clear that there are many people whose lives depend on kidney and heart machines. Such people are no more able to live without the aid of such machines than is a fetus of four months able to live outside the uterus. None of these indi viduals is viable in that sense; yet a person on a kidney machine has a right to life. If it be objected that "viability" means being able to survive with aid other than the mother's body, then this would result in no criterion at all; for medical science may one day progress to the stage in which even a newly fertilized egg is viable. But would such progress make abortion of a zygote any more wrong than we consider it to be now? Achieving the property of motion does not provide a cutoff point, either; for gnats, mosquitoes, and viruses by the millions are in motion, and we do not consider them to have any significant right to life. Nor is motion a necessary condition for one's having a right to life, since it would wrong a paralyzed adult to kill him. The attaining of human form is also neither necessary nor</page><page sequence="14">394 Social Theory and Practice sufficient. It is not necessary because we can imagine ra tional simian creatures, like those inhabiting the Planet of the Apes, whom we would consider to possess a distinctive right to life. Having human form is also not sufficient, since we can imagine a newborn infant in perfect human form whose brain was so severely defective that no mental predi cates at all could be ascribed to it. It seems clear to me that we would not be wronging such an individual by depriving it of life. Hence, by my analysis of the concept of a right, such an individual does not have any right to life. Of course, there might still be moral reasons for keeping such an infant alive, but these reasons must make appeal to the rights of others, for example, the parents, not to the rights of the individual in question. So far, my arguments have affected only those who have opted for some other cutoff point between conception and maturity to provide a basis for granting an individual the right to life. Two objections can now be made against my strategy: (1) there are other possible cutoff points that I have not mentioned, and (2) the mention of any cutoff point at all begs the question against a conservative position that con siders abortion and contraception to be equal moral evils. I have two answers to the first objection. First, the cutoff points I have mentioned are the only ones taken seriously in the literature, either by other moderates or by a radical such as Tooley; and it is only some actual proposal made that deserves an answer, not all the logically possible ones. If there is some other plausible cutoff point that I have missed, then I challenge its proponents to state it so that it will lie open to criticism. Second, some cutoff points mentioned, such as "quickening" (the time at which the mother feels the fetus move), do not make reference to properties of the individual whose right to life is in question, but to proper ties of the host; but these properties of others are irrelevant in determining when an individual has itself been wronged by depriving it of life. As for objection (2), my analysis makes it clear that any strictures against contraception must have a different basis than those against abortion; for in the former case there is yet no individual present to be wronged. So the only position left to criticize is the conser vative one in which conception itself provides the cutoff</page><page sequence="15">Abortion 395 point, and an individual's potentialities alone are said to be enough to grant it a right to life. This brings me to the second part of my defense, which consists in arguing that the mere potentiality for a distinc tively human consciousness is not sufficient for an individual's having any right to life. I shall first proceed by inviting you to conduct some thought experiments, not to explore the differences in other morally possible worlds, but instead to lay bare your moral sentiments with regard to the actual world.13 Imagine first that the story about Cadmus and the dragon's teeth is true. Cadmus plants the dragon's teeth and shortly afterwards they sprout into armed soldiers. Imagine that these soldiers are rational and that they pos sess that heightened consciousness that characterizes human adults. Surely we would be wronging them by cut ting off their heads as they pop up through the soil; that is, we would be violating their right to life. Yet it would be odd if we insisted that Cadmus was depriving someone of his right to life by failing to plant the teeth, full knowing their powers, but instead crushed them or threw them into the sea. If it be objected that the dragon's teeth before planting were completely inert, imagine that they possessed the sort of life present in a zygote. Even then I think it would be counterintuitive to say that Cadmus would be wronging prospective soldiers by destroying the teeth instead of planting them. Again, imagine that zygotes ceased to grow within a woman's body, but were instead deposited on the ground, like spores, and that in the normal length of time they matured into human infants. It seems to me that one would not be wronging any prospective people by destroying these fertilized eggs by stepping on them. Yet it does seem that we would violate an individual's right to life if we waited until it reached the fetus state and commenced to respond to stimuli, and then killed it. Once such an indi vidual reached this stage it would appear that the only proper thing to do would be to protect it from harm. If we do think that we wrong the individual by killing it at this stage, though not when we kill it earlier, then potentiality alone is not enough for us to attribute a right to life, and conscious ness is also required. If we also think that we do more of an</page><page sequence="16">396 Social Theory and Practice injustice by killing a human fetus than by killing a newborn kitten,then it would seem to be only because the fetus has some property, which, in the course of time, will result in its coming to have that characteristic type of experience en joyed by human adults. In other words, to have that distinc tive right to life possessed by human adults, a developing individual would have to possess both consciousness and the potentiality for that heightened consciousness actually possessed by human adults. The preceding thought experiments appear to me to be conclusive. Is this sheer prejudice? I do not think so, be cause of the following argument, which consists of three analytic claims. First, it follows from the analysis of the concept of a right that where there is no wrong done to an individual by depriving it of life, then that individual lacks the right to life. But it also seems clear that one cannot wrong an individual unless that individual has interests. (This is not to say that the individual must be cognizant of these interests, but just that such interests exist.) So, in a manner reminiscent of Locke, I take the following to be an analytic claim: where there are no interests there is no injustice. This is why we do not think that we can wrong inanimate objects by destroying them, or do injustice to trees by chopping them down. (Or, if someone thinks that we can wrong such objects, he also thinks that such objects do have interests that might be thwarted.) The final step of my argument consists of the claim that an individual has interests only if mental predicates can be applied to it. This seems a trivial step, for if we ascribe an interest to an indi vidual, then we are ipso facto making it the subject of a mental predicate. Hence, a necessary condition for A's hav ing the right to life is that A be the subject of mental predi cates, which is precisely the claim I have already made in saying that the property of consciousness is required in order to attribute to an individual the right to life. Potentiality alone is therefore too weak to carry the bur den the conservative demands of it. Of course, the conserva tive might still claim that the single-celled zygote has in terests, and can therefore be wronged. But if this is his claim, then the empirical evidence is against it. Most of us would deem it an anthropomorphism to attribute mental</page><page sequence="17">Abortion 397 predicates to trees, plants, and other simple biological or ganisms; and saying that a zygote has interests seems to be a brand of this type of thinking. If it be claimed instead that the zygote will have interests in the proper course of time, then this claim is irrelevant; for this is just to say that this individual will come to have rights. The claim made by conservatives, remember, was that abortion violates an individual's present right to life; their claim was not that abortion prevents such a right from coming into being. The conservative's case appears plausible, I think, only because of our tendency, in determining an individual's right to life, to smuggle in thoughts of the relations that this individual bears to other individuals. We think, for exam ple, not of the wronging of a zygote, but of its relationship to those who caused it to exist and to the society in which it might one day play a part. But all these relationships are irrelevant to determining the right to life of that individual. Such a right must be based on properties possessed by the individual alone, because only by reference to its own properties can we determine what constitutes an injustice done to it. Both of my thought experiments were designed to concentrate on the individual with its properties, apart from any such irrelevant relations into which it might enter, and apart from the rights possessed by others. Those religious thinkers who hold that any abortion constitutes an injustice done to God, or to society, may still mount a moral argu ment; but they should recognize that any such argument has nothing whatsoever to do with an individual's possessing the right to life. And without such a reference to the right to life, such further moral arguments seem too weak to stand on their own. Suppose that it is finally granted that an individual who possesses both consciousness and the potentiality for a heightened consciousness does have a distinctive right to life. This alone does nothing to show that a prospective mother cannot override such a right by asserting her right to do as she pleases with her body. Might it not be the case, then, that a woman's rights to liberty and privacy overrule a</page><page sequence="18">398 Social Theory and Practice fetus's right to life? Nothing in my argument so far serves to undermine this claim. But if this is the claim that is made, then it seems that the burden of proof lies with the one who claims the superiority of the right to liberty and privacy. In a vast number of other cases, it is commonly assumed that one's right to liberty and privacy can only be exercised when they do not violate another's right to life. In such cases we consider the right to life to win out over these other rights. Those who would defend abortion on the basis of liberty and privacy, while admitting that there is still something unjust about it, owe us a convincing explanation of how the case of abortion differs so much from these other cases. Judith Jarvis Thomson appears to take up this challenge by offering an analogy.14 She asks you to imagine that, be cause you have a rare blood type, you have been kidnapped by the Society of Music Lovers in order that your circulatory system be plugged into that of a famous violinist who would die of blood poisoning if he did not remain plugged into you for the next nine months. Clearly, the violinist has a right to life; but Thomson thinks that we should agree, in this case, that your right to do as you please with your body outweighs the violinist's right to life. So one would not do the wrong thing, everything being considered, by unplugging you from the violinist if you so wished it. One can agree with her conclusion in this case but still reject her suggestion that the case is analogous to that of a pregnant woman's decision to have an abortion. In Thomson's example you have been kidnapped, so an ele ment of coercion is present which is not normally present with pregnancies. Her case is thus more akin to that of a pregnancy caused by rape. But this should not lead us to think that in a pregnancy caused by rape the mother's rights to liberty and privacy always override the right to life of a fetus. Thomson's case shows at most that rape offers an extra consideration, but not one that is necessarily overriding; for even though a woman who is raped is coerced, she is not normally coerced into waiting until the fetus has a right to life before seeking an abortion. A more fitting analogy is one in which you are partly responsible for an accident in which an innocent bystander</page><page sequence="19">Abortion 399 is seriously hurt and will die unless you, with your rare blood type, agree to give him a series of blood transfusions over the next nine months and also agree to a special diet and program of exercise to insure that both you and the victim remain healthy. It seems to me that in this case you do owe the accident victim the use of your body and blood, because you are partly responsible for the fix that he is in, and only you can get him out of it. Is not this case morally similar to the normal case of pregnancy, and do we not think that a prospective mother should show moral concern for the continued existence of the conscious life which she is partly responsible for creating? If this is an analogous case, it shows that far more weighty considerations than liberty and privacy must be adduced in order to sanction the abor tion of an individual who has come to possess the right to life. NOTES 1. The 1973 Supreme Court decision in the cases that overturned the Texas and Georgia abortion laws (Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, respectively) suggests two cutoff points: the end of the first trimester of pregnancy and the achieving of viability (about seven months). Choice of the earlier date, however, was based on no property of the fetus, but merely on the state's interest in having abortions performed with no undue risk to the mother. The viability criterion was chosen to provide that "compelling" point at which the state takes an interest in protecting potential human life. But nowhere can one find the argument that makes viability so compelling. The Supreme Court ruling thus decides no moral issues, since it assumes, without proof, that the fetus itself has no right to life until it reaches viability; and it offers no further basis for choosing viability rather than some earlier or later time at which "potential human life" is also present. 2. Both Roger Wertheimer's "Understanding the Abortion Argu ment," Philosophy and Public Affairs 1 (1971): 69, and Judith Jarvis Thomson's "A Defense of Abortion," Philosophy and Public Affairs 1 (1971 ):47, interpret the conservative position on abortion in this way, though their accounts suffer from the added ambiguity of taking "person" to be interchangeable with "human being." Michael Tooley gets rid of the ambiguity in "Abortion and Infanticide," Philosophy and Public Affairs 2</page><page sequence="20">400 Social Theory and Practice (1972):40, by stipulating that "person" is to be understood as a purely moral concept synonymous with "an individual having a (serious) moral right to life." But Tooley's stipulation has no basis in common speech and is actually unnecessary for de lineating the differences among opposing views. 3. Tooley, 44-45. 4. This distinguishes my position from that of Tooley, who opts for self-consciousness (Tooley, 49). 5. Tooley, 40. 6. Ibid., 63. 7. Ibid., 65. 8. With the exception of condition (4), Tooley gives similar condi tions for the purpose of delineating the conservative position, see Tooley, 58. 9. Tooley, 58. 10. Tooley's moral symmetry principle serves to underline his con sequentialist approach to moral values. My counterexamples can thus be interpreted as a criticism of the doctrine that con sequences are the sole arbiters of right and wrong. These ex amples therefore serve the same general purpose as the more familiar ones used against consequentialism by W. D. Ross in chapter 2 of The Right and the Good (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1930), especially 17-18. 11. Tooley, 62. 12. Tooley has objected, in conversation, that his criterion of self consciousness presupposes no metaphysical view of the self, and he has suggested that all that need be meant by "self" is that it be a reidentifiable subject of both mental and physical predicates. But my criticism of Tooley's criterion does not depend upon saddling him with a Cartesian concept of the self. It depends upon the point that, whatever neutral notion of the self is selected, there may be people who do not believe that this notion applies to them. Tooley might object that, if we make the self-concept neutral enough, such people can only be insane. But even this can be admitted, for it is clear that insanity alone does not deprive one of a right to life. 13. There are two different kinds of motivation for using examples drawn from possible worlds. First, one might describe possible circumstances which, if actualized, would result in our holding different moral principles. Since values are supervenient on facts, a significant difference in facts might very well alter our values, too. A second kind of motivation behind describing pos sible states of affairs is to free one from habit and prejudice so that one may more readily discover just what one's moral principles are, or what they consistently could be. Here the use</page><page sequence="21">Abortion 401 of imagination aids in the screening off of ¡relevant detail and allows a person to see more clearly into his own soul. My thought experiments are attempts to provide cases of the second sort. 14. Thomson 48-49. L. S.
