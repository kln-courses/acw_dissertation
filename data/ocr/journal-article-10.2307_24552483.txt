<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOKS RECEIVED Arnell, Peter; Bickford, Ted; and Wheeler, Ka ren; eds. Michael Graves: Buildings and Projects, 1966-1981. New York, Rizzoli International Publica tions, 1982. 304 pp. 700 illustrations, 300 in color. S45 cloth; f29.95 paper. "While any architectural lan guage, to be built, will always exist within the tech nical realm," writes Graves in his introduction, "it is important to keep the technical expression paral lel to an equal and complementary expression of ritual and symbol." Modernism, Graves con tinues, did this with the machine as its paradigm, but the machine is out—"in its rejection of the human or anthropomorphic representation of pre vious architecture, the Modern Movement under mined the poetic form in favor of nonfigural, ab stract geometries." "The external language," he further argues, "which engages inventions of cul ture at large, is rooted in a figurative associational and anthropomorphic attitude." Examples of Graves' "figurative" and "anthropomorphic" are richly provided in this volume—a medical office interior in Fort Wayne, Indiana, complete with landscape murals, the Alexander House in Prince ton with a library with both "real" views out the windows and more murals (plus a thoroughly non functional, sculptural "open window" on the roof)—with models and elevations and sections and heaps and heaps of color. It's fascinating mate rial for a book; as Vincent Scully says in the essay, "Michael Graves' architecture more closely ap proximates a literary art than any other architec ture one can think of in history. ... It depends in fact upon two words: 'allusion' and 'illusion.'" Graves' allusions are to the whole history of archi tecture, and his illusions—like the site drawings and plans for the public library in San Juan Capis trano, California, which must "follow the indige nous Spanish mission style"—are extraordinary combinations of space and history, living realities and cultural myths. Any Graves lover or any archi tecture fan should eat this one up. Clausberg, Carl. Zeppelin: Die Geschichte eines un wahrscheinlichen Erfolges. Munich, Schirmer/Mosel, 1979. 296 pp. 223 illustrations. DM48. The inven tion of the zeppelin was an event of extraordinary importance in the popular culture of its day. This volume (in German) contains a biography of that most unusual man, Count Zeppelin, and a de tailed historical account of his invention, its magi cal beginnings and its extinction, much like the dinosaur, at the height of technical perfection. Without the marvelous collection of historical pho tographs—including some by Alfred Eisenstaedt, documenting this life story—it would be hard to understand the excitement it aroused. Views of three children watching the first flight, a shot down zeppelin sitting in a nest of trees, or the tail of this odd bird sticking out of a hangar on stilts in Lake Constance are treats. The book includes a history of the zeppelin industry, a discussion of the mass-psychological reaction to the invention in lit erature, and even a chapter on its sexual nature. The Goodyear blimp will never be the same. Crea, Enzo. Immagini di persons in Calabria. Rome, Edizioni dell'Elefante, 1982. 145 pp. 53 photographs. 128. "These pictures of people and landscapes and objects still evoke a world with its own harsh and astringent enchantment," says Enzo Crea of these photographs taken by him some 30 years ago. Créa, a book publisher, captures "the Southern Italian (Calabrian) reality of the fifties, .. . like signals from a remote and lost world," says histo rian Rosario Villari in an introduction. It is a world of peasant people caught up in postwar ten sions, yet oddly timeless, from the milkman of San Fili, a boy sitting on an ancient stone stairway with milk can against Mediterranean sky, or a mother and daughter caught in unspecified tragedy in Life Must Go On, to the shy joy of mother greeting growing son in cobbled streets in The Seminarist Comes Home. These photographs are enchanting, yes, but also moving in their depiction of a culture gone by, of men and women and children trapped in and exalted by their rustic surroundings. Dückers, Alexander. George Grosz: Das druck graphische Werk. Berlin, Ullstein-Propyläen, 1979. 264 pp. 402 illustrations. DM148. This book (in Ger man) is an extremely useful guide for the serious collector and student of Grosz' work and the first book to present Grosz' complete print oeuvre. Along with the usual information about dimen sions, technique, date, and size of edition, the au thor provides information about collectors, an ex planation of subject matter, and prices paid for each work, when available. Nearly 400 prints are catalogued by groups: etchings, individual litho graphs, lithographs from sets, from compilations, and from illustrated books. Since many of Grosz' prints are known by several titles, the index of works by all known titles is useful. In the course of his research, Dückers was able to determine whether a number of the prints can be classified as "originals," a question of much debate and a topic he addresses in his introduction. The prints, as anyone familiar with Grosz knows, are satiric, car icatural studies, revealing Grosz' perceptions of his culture and era. The reproductions are merely utilitarian, and the introductory essay is brief, but as a reference work this is excellent. Enyeart, James L. Jerry N. Uelsmann, Twenty-Fine Years: A Retrospective. Boston, Little, Brown (a New York Graphic Society Book), 1982. 231 pp. 177 illustra tions, two in color. $39.95. "Henry [Holmes Smith] was high priest at my photographic puberty rites," wrote Uelsmann, who also studied with Minor White. "I was forced to be real, to think about what I was doing." An early picture from 1954—a tie-and-suited man holding a cigarette in his up raised foot—was achieved without Uelsmann's later standard device of multiple printing, but, says James Enyeart, it foreshadows his later mode of "the persuasion of the viewer to believe in the unbelievable." Uelsmann can be outrightly funny—as in a hot dog with all-the-trimmings floating above four beach chairs on a beach in All American Sunset—but, as Enyeart claims, "the artist in Uelsmann is like the Dalai Lama, a giggling mystic with a very serious and complex intent," so complex, indeed, that critic William Parker could essayize on Uelsmann's work fully on the basis of Jungian archetypes. At times, Enyeart lapses into psychobabble. But generally the text is a lively in tellectual exposition of this photographer whose aim is to "disassociate known subject relationships .. . and reassociate them in new but perhaps mys terious ways...." The photographs prove the point: gulls flying above a garbage-strewn land scape with tattered teddy bear in armchair in the foreground; dislocations of height and space and gravity in a small-town scene with boy sitting on ladder and young man standing on truck; the fa mous Victorian dining room with cloud-swept sky as ceiling; a man in cutoffs floating in blackest space in which can be made out various classical statues. Disorientation leads to revelation. It's hard to say just what is being said, but this is as art should be. A poetic, protean 25-years'-worth, and a most handsome volume. Faxon, Alicia Craig.
