<plain_text><page sequence="1">Theater Techniques in an Aquarium or a Natural History Museum Patricia Rutowski Educational techniques using costumes and theatrical skits to portray animals other than Homo sapiens hold many rewards for aquariums and natural history museums and their audiences. But they also present practical and logisti- cal problems and raise philosophical questions that should be worked through before they are undertaken. At the Monterey Bay Aquarium in Monterey, California, we have used theatrical methods since 1985. Even as our program evolves we continue to refine both our techniques and our thinking about the purposes and uses of theater for mu- seum education. The issues we face fall into three areas of concern: issues about educational approaches for different audiences; issues about logistics and the mission of the aquarium; and issues about representing animals through theater. Educational Approaches and Dramatic Techniques The theater pieces we have developed use a variety of theatrical techniques and different plot lines to suit the needs of various audiences. Outreach Education, the pro- gram within the Education Department that uses theater, offers classroom programs for preschool groups and school children from kindergarten through gra&lt; ' 2 12 and assembly programs for elementary school students.xDuring the school year, 95 percent of Outreach's programs are presented for elementary school audiences. We also perform at public weekend events, such as festivals or conferences, and at aquarium events. We have found that different types of theatrical activities work well for different age groups. Children in preschool and primary school age groups live in a world of imagination. They want to touch, and they want to move. They are receptive to believing in puppets and to pantomiming the behaviors of animals, and these kinds of dramatic activities successfully involve them in learning about the way animals behave. Older elementary school students, aware of peer judg- ments, are unwilling to pantomime animals and unlikely Patricia Rutowski is coordinator of Outreach Education at the Monterey Bay Aquarium in Monterey, California. With a doctorate in science education, she has been involved for many years in museum education and teacher training in environmental education and marine science curriculum.

Yet they are often not only willing but eager to be dressed up as an animal in the classroom or on an auditorium stage. At this age level the students can respond to questions about which body parts allow an animal to survive certain envi- ronmental conditions. Behind a crab mask, they spontane- ously scuttle across the floor and imitate other arthropod gesticulations with abandon. High school students are, for the most part, not so willing to dress up like an animal, but they enjoy seeing their teacher turned into an angler fish or otter. Some teachers have had high school students write plays about marine animals and perform for younger students. A col- league in Florida visited classrooms and directed students in performing a simple play about the water cycle during an hour-long class period. We have yet to explore the full use of theater in upper grade levels. Theater techniques offer excellent ways to involve students who do not learn visu- ally or aurally. Pantomiming or dressing up allows kines- thetic learners to move like an animal or feel the animal's body parts in the costume around them. Assembly programs for elementary students represent animals in their natural context and present natural his- tory and habitat information. They generally last 30 min- utes for primary students and 45 minutes for upper elemen- tary students. Employing a more conservative strategy than public event pieces, they present animals interacting with a human who asks them about their life histories. In "An Otter Adventure" a young otter searches for her lost mother. On the way she learns what she needs to know to survive and recognizes how she is different from other ocean animals. Primary school audiences mime swimming along with the young otter and chant rhymes that briefly summarize what she learns in each of her encounters with other animals, including a shark: You're no otter nosirree You have big sharp teeth And want to eat me! Public event skits have to attract and hold audiences as they wander by the stage, and the approach clearly differs from that used in classroom and assembly settings. These skits have attention-getting introductions requiring audi- ence participation, and the plots make use of popular culture. "Squids in Space" opens with the musical theme from Star Wars, and the narrator sets the scene with these words: "Mysteriously drawn back to the waters of his birth, our hero, Luke Squidwalker, feels he must return to Mon- terey Bay." "Deep Side Story" uses the plot of Romeo and Juliet to teach about deep sea lantern fish and species recognition. Public event skits last only 15 to 20 minutes - just long enough to hold an audience in a festival setting. To keep the audience interested, there are quick appearances by many animal characters, and volunteers from the audience dress up like animals. In "Squids in Space," for example, "betentacled" youngsters help Luke fight the evil Shark Vader. The big question we continue to have as we reflect on our presentations for all these audiences is, Are we enter- tainment or education? The intent of our theatrical pieces is to make the audience excited about the information we present. In most school and library settings, the theater pieces set the scene for a face-to-face interview with live animals - the truly educational experience. Logistical Concerns Being theatrical presents practical and logistical problems that begin with the staff itself. The aquarium's Education Department hires marine biologists who are trained to interpret natural phenomena for children and the public generally. Adding theater requires that these people be actors as well as good public speakers. While we do on occasion enlist the aid of theater professionals in training and direction, we recognize that our programs do not always have the polish that trained actors and actresses could bring to a stage. We have chosen not to create elaborate sets, props, or costumes and have refrained from adding lighting and music. We have even cut back on the use of slides. Outreach Education staff go out to schools three and four times a week, 10 months of the year. Staff members haul carts of live animals in tubs and a variety of instructional props. If they had to haul tape decks, lights, and elaborate stages as well, this complex job would become even more stressful. Moreover, as available stage area differs from school to school, the addition of props would make presentations even more complicated. Making the decision to staff a theater program with content specialists and not with actors and to use a bare minimum of theatrical stage sets and props meant, for the Monterey Bay Aquarium, clearly defining the place and purpose of theater within the institution's educational mission. Representing Animals through Theater Logistical concerns seem relatively minor when compared to the philosophical questions raised by using theater to represent animals for educational purposes. Aquariums and natural history museums make hard choices when they decide to write a script to teach visitors about animals. Some naturalists and educators believe that animals are exciting enough to serve as their own attraction and that the best way to teach about an animal is to stand up in front of a group with the animal, or with pictures of it, and discuss its characteristics. These people maintain that any hoopla other than the straight facts upstages the creature itself, possibly distracting from the lesson in biology. Storytellers and some other educators believe that a plot emphasizing some of the real-life problems an animal faces builds empathy in the listeners. Theater helps people relate to the animal, and they can more easily absorb information about its habits. Theatrical techniques have the added advantage of offering a way to present animals that cannot be handled or used for demonstration. At the Monterey Bay Aquarium we have opted for this second approach. The students who see "An Otter Adven- ture" are invited to put themselves in the place of the young otter, and they empathize with her dilemma. In "Sea Stars on Vacation," written for young readers at libraries, a child brings a sea star (played by a human) home from the beach. The child and the sea star compare their strategies for filling basic needs for food, water, and shelter. Students learn that not all animals eat pizza or put their food into their mouths. Instead, sea stars stick their stomachs out of their mouths to slurp up and digest such délectables as gooey clams and 6 / Journal of Museum Education</page><page sequence="3">sea snails. In contrasting another animal's way of filling basic needs with their own, students relate information about sea stars to their own experience. At the same time, however, the plot of "Sea Stars on Vacation" involves a child's bringing a sea creature home from the beach. After debating whether we should depict this action on stage, we decided to go ahead with it only by emphasizing throughout the skit that sea creatures should be left where they are found. At the end of each program instructors ask the children what they would do if they found a sea star at the beach, and while young audiences seem to have gotten the message about not taking sea creatures home, we discovered that other confusions arose. After one performance, when we brought out live animals for the students to touch, a little girl looked up at me to exclaim, "My sea star won't talk!" We sometimes wonder if our theatrical pieces actually confuse young people still trying to develop the ability to tell the "imaginary" from the "real." Moreover, in the effort to make an animal as under- standable as possible it is always tempting to make it as human as possible. The balance between empathy and biological accuracy is often difficult to achieve. While the audience may be invited to empathize with the animal character, the "human" character given to the animal must not overshadow the animal itself. In one of our older pieces, "Billy the Squid: A Calamari Western," we may not have achieved the balance. We wanted to teach visitors that squid return to Monterey Bay in the late spring to mate, lay their eggs, and die. Our hero followed his life history accurately, but he wore cowboy boots, toted a holster filled with cephalopodan ink, and sought revenge for all the squids who never returned to the open ocean from Monterey Bay. In the bay's shallow waters, he confronted a shark in a pace-off and inky duel. Did the skit cause misconceptions? Did visitors leave with the impression, even subconscious, that squid have human motivations like seeking revenge? Did they think of sharks as "bad guys" even though the plot had stressed that sharks actually eat very few squid in Monterey Bay? These are hard questions for us to answer. It is clear that educational and dramatic impulses can sometimes be at cross-purposes. It is also clear that our staff can never be completely certain about what visitors actually learn from theater pieces. Research in science education has just be- gun to focus on misconceptions that people acquire in school, in museums, and from television programs. We can only hope to ferret out what we are really conveying about our animal stars and to avoid potential sources of miscon- ceptions in our programs. Theater and the Museum's Mission Theater serves a definite purpose in the educational pro- gram of the Monterey Bay Aquarium. The skits presented as public events allow us to reach people in "noneducational" settings with an educational message. The aquarium's public relations staff sees Outreach Education as creating a positive and "fun" community image for the aquarium as well. In the schools, the use of dramatic techniques in- volves students in plot lines and with animal stars in ways that they remember for years. The evolution of our program has been guided by our institution's mission. Before initiating theater in an aquar- ium or natural history museum, we believe it is important for staff to consider these questions: ■ What is the institution's mission? Does it empha- size education, or entertainment, or both? How would theater be viewed by those who work in the institution? In what arena or department could dramatic techniques be best used? What audiences would be best served by the use of theater? ■ What style should be selected to represent informa- tion about animals? Should animals be represented as anthropomorphic characters? Does the institution hold to a style of presenting natural history information that would prevent the artistic liberties that are sometimes necessary in dramatics? ■ How much support for theater is the institution willing to provide? There is a great difference between providing costumes for animal dress-ups and staging full productions. Who will write the scripts? Who will direct and perform skits and productions? Will these people also serve as naturalists on the staff? Are there local people with the talents needed? At Monterey Bay we continue to frame and answer hard questions about the use of theater for education. Our audi- ences and our own satisfaction testify to the worth of the endeavor.
