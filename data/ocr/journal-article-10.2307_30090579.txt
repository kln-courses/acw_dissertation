<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HIDDEN MESSAGES OF THE 'INFORMATION AGE' Arlene Krebs Ph.D. (Kansas), lecturer in New York University, School of Continuing Education We live in environments which are, for the most part, technologically constructed, dominated by electronic media and based on the electronic collection, storage, and transmission of in formation. Two significant technologies are responsible for creating and extending these electronic environments. They are communications satellites and computers. Words such as: 'informatics', 'cybergenics', 'telecomputations', and 'telecompubiquity' have been created specifi cally to express the convergence of telecommunications, and, in particular, the merging of computers with communications satellites. These two technologies make possible the transmission of information over enormous distances, in huge amounts, and at the speed of light. This fantastic merging of speed, information, and energy has been bundled into words and slogans which are used to popularize the potential of our current historical period. We live, we have been told, in the 'Information Age', the 'Post-Industrial Society', the 'Communica tions Revolution', the 'Cybernetic Era', and so on. Phrases like these serve to popularize the notion that our lives are being transformed by communications technologies. Commentators from academia, from the government, corporate and advertising sectors are equally glib at promoting positive and, often, exaggerated descriptions of a world linked by information networks. For example, since the first geosynchronous communications satellite was launched in 1965 (Intelsat I, known as Early Bird), commentators have hailed the potentials of the world-wide sharing of culture, of the dissemination of news, entertainment, and information programming to all nations and peoples. Satellites were described as neutral devices, indiscriminately relaying international messages. Slogans such as: 'the miracle of space communications', and 'the reach is universal' depict satellites as facilitating 'global har600y and understanding'. Marshall McLuhan, in one of his famous epigrams, proclaimed 'the world is a global village'.' Time magazine published an article, 'The Room-Sized World',' and like the metaphor in McLuhan's 'global village', this title indicated how satellites could shrink time and space, uniting the world into a com600, albeit electronic environment. These metaphors (including too Alvin Toffler's 'electronic cottage' connote decentralized communities, where comfort, ease, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness reign. These inferences contradict both the characteristics of urban society, as well as the centralized structure of the mass media. None Studies Autumn 1984</page><page sequence="2">theless, the symbolic intentions of these metaphors would have us believe that we can interact and communicate from our homes to persons throughout the globe. We are endowed, thereby, to create momentary and symbolic villages of mediated inhabitants. The most salient feature of the 'Room-Sized World' is its sheer positivism regardless of the existing (and future tensions between governments, the nuances of inter-cultural communications, and the real needs of people. The issues of national sovereignty and cultural integrity were ignored. Yet, the notion persisted that 'receiving dishes pointing at the sky will be able to collect the most sophisticated technical information for the most backward countries', and that educational television would guarantee that 'all the world's culture will be available to all the world '.3 These services are not as necessary for most of the world's oppressed as the essentials of food, water, clothing, shelter, and medical attention. Moreover, global television transmissions over the past twenty years, have been limited primarily to sporting events, coronations and assasinations, the moon landing, a royal wedding, news exchanges and religious rituals. MISREPRESENTATIONS Yet, articles like these, and the numerous slogans and metaphors which have followed, hide a fundamental misrepresentation, which equates technical capacity and capability with communications. That is, increased and sophisticated techniques of transmission, have not, necessarily, brought us increased understanding. While communications satellites (and computers can guarantee the accuracy of transmitting signals, they exert no control over the content over the meaning and effect of the message. Even UNESCO's Declaration of 1983 as World Communications Year promotes the notion that expanded information networks will provide us with better communications and, hence, an improved quality of life. UNESCO stated: 'So far-reaching do these transformations promise to be that historians of the future are likely to look back on the present decade as a turning point in the evolution of human society'.4 This exaggerated prediction is intended to evoke feelings of awe in us for technological advances, and to create feelings of respect for the technical capacity and capability of information networks. We are made to believe that we are active, objective participants in the 'information/communications revolution' which is under way for our benefits. There is little attempt at impact analysis, or to use another term, technology assessment. 212</page><page sequence="3">CONFUSIONS OF DEFINITION One of the most direct and immediate methods for technology assess ment, particularly as it relates to deciphering the promotion and popularization of the 'Information Society', is to analyse its language and its images. Our lives are described as dependent upon and sub jugated to the machine's speed and efficiency: 'Today's push-button world', where information technologies (not people 'solve tomorrow's problems today'. Resolution (or problem solving depends upon in stantaneous transmissions that 'beat the system' and help you win the 'information revolution'. Having 'real-time information' can 'win the battle', or 'defeat the competition'. Notice the militaristic connotations. Many of these advertisements are familiar to us all. One, on a glossy black magazine page, with bold white lettering reads: 'By the year 2000, information will be multiplying four times faster than popula tion.' What does this mean Information in bits, or bytes, or books The tone of the advertisement intentionally makes us feel powerless and ineffective. How can we possible keep up with this tremendous growth Will information overcome us Also, this advertisement endows information with anthropomorphic qualities. Information is capable of procreation. The whole statement makes no sense; that is, it is stupid talk' or nonsense. Even more significantly, this advertisement illustrates the varying and confusing definitions of the term, 'information'. Some liken information to energy, as an underlying force which motivates society. Others view information as a commodity, whereby it is equated with 600ey and economics. We speak of the 'information industry' or the knowledge economy. Information can be exchanged as 600ey. Note the merging of information with knowledge, and knowledge with 600ey, and, in its logical progression in our society, 600ey and know ledge (or 600ey and information with power. Informatioi, thereby, comes to mean power and control, representing the information one system (or company, or industry, or nation can use against another. Third World nations regard information (and information technologies as under the control of the advanced industrialized societies, and have raised serious international issues, regarding the uses of satellites, the free flow of inform'tion, the militarization nf Space, and technology transfer. The Third World has called for a New World Information Order, a term which expresses another popularized slogan: 'the in formation rich and the information poor'. This phrase denotes the possibility that society will be divided between those who do have access to information technologies and those who do not. This will create an underclass of those persons and nations deprived of the educational and entertainment potentials of communications media. These confusions of definition refer to the qualitative aspects of information as a con300t. But, included in its origins were the quantita 213</page><page sequence="4">tive and statistical aspects of information. Claude Shannon, Warren Weaver, and Norbert Weiner were mathematicians,6 and in Weiner's case, a philosopher, who were the first to develop information theory in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Shannon and Weaver wrote The Mathematical Theory of Communication in which they described information in its statistical nature, as a signal or bits to be transmitted by a machine, in particular, computers. This quantitative and statistical definition of information provided for a precise and rigorous study of communications, and of the engineering capacities of the machine. The message, that is, information is described not in terms of its quality, or meaning, but in terms of its quantity or amount. Separated from meaning and effect, information is understood in terms of its measure ment, and the accuracy of transmission techniques. Engineers and technicians readily understand this meaning of information, but for the most part, the word in its popular usage has been confused and abused. TECHNIQUE, TECHNOLOGY, AND COMMUNICATION The language and images which describe technology reflect our views of our world and of ourselves. Advertisements for everything from household cleansers to personal computers impress upon us their speed, efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. The use of hyperbole emphasizes technical capacity and capability. In particular for informa tion technologies, we emulate technique, and we equate technique with communication. Technique, described and defined by the eminent French sociologist, Jacques Ellul,7 refers to any complex of standardized means for attain ing a pre-determined result. Technique is deliberate, rationalized, standardized. Technique is reliable and has absolute efficiency. Technique applies to many different technologies from the nuclear bomb, to satellites, to computers. Technique integrates the machine into society, and the human to the machine. Technique has become the basis upon which technological society is constructed, and technique has become an ideal towards which technological society strives. Perhaps Ellul's most disturbing con300t is that technique now provides a model for human behaviour. It specifies values which have become internalized in us. The most accessible example is our fascination with, admiration for, and emulation of computers. Whereas previously we described computer technology as replicating the human mind, today we insist that we model ourselves on the machine's computing capacity. We should attempt to manipulate and transform information automatically as the computer does functions, lest we forget, we are capable of completing ourselves, although, perhaps, not as efficiently nor as quickly. Notable commentators state that 'no limits have been discovered to the potential scope of computer intelligence that are not also limits on human intelligence', but 'modern, fast computers can 214</page><page sequence="5">execute these processes more rapidly than can the human brain'." We are compared to and comparable with our machines. Even advertisements for Plato, the software programme now being promoted for educational purposes state: 'Let Plato Widen Your Child's Horizon. Let Plato Increase the Speed of Learning . . . in Your Own Home.' First, let the machine do it. Secondly, each of us who has spent time learning and teaching, spent time reading, reflecting, memorizing, and concentrating knows that speed is simply not a qualification nor a characteristic of learning. ASSESSING TECHNOLOGY Serious attempts at technology assessment begin with dissecting hyper bole. Critical evaluation of the language and the images used to promote information technologies and the technologically determined 'Information Society' can sensitize and alert us to propaganda. Technology assessment is not an easy task. It involves complex factors, and requires an integrated approach. History can be a guide, for it provides a perspective for analysis, and can de600strate patterns. We can extend the assessment by formulating questions about risks and benefits, and about those consequences which are predictable, and those which are unforeseen. Research structure, methodology, and the participants' motives also must be considered. And, most importantly, technology assessment extends to the social, economic, military, political, cultural, environmental, biological, psychological, educational, spiritual, and philosophical realms. Much debate has been generated about the implications of the 'Information Age' and the issues which have emerged are highly con troversial. Yet, one primary factor often is overlooked: information technologies are entrenched in militarism. World War 11 military requirements fostered the development of electronics, radar, computers, and rocketry technologies with direct applications to space flight, and consequently, to communications satellites. The Cold War further propelled both political and technological competition. The United States was prepared to protect the free world with superior arms technology. The ever-strengthening bond between the military and industry became so powerful that even President Eisenhower, in his Farewell Address, (January, 1961 felt compelled to comment. He described the unwarranted influence of the 'military-industrial complex' (the first such use of this term and of its economic, political, and even spiritual implications. He warned that 'the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist'.9 The launching of Sputnik in 1957, a date which marks the dawn of the Space Age, confirmed that the race for space was on. United States Senator John Stennis summed it up, when he stated in 1961: 'Space technology will eventually become the dominant factor in 215</page><page sequence="6">determining our national military strength. Whoever controls space, controls the world."0 And, in 1982, Lieutenant General C. Henry, Deputy Commander of the Air Force's newly created Space Command, reconfirmed. 'Space is not a mission. It is a place. It is a theatre of operations.' Satellites are used for the military, for surveillance, remote sensing, communications, and for early warning of missile attacks. Star Wars is a film, a video game, and a United States Department of Defense strategy. In March, 1983, President Reagan announced plans that the Department of Defence would begin developing anti-satellite laser warfare. The newspaper headlines read: 'Space War Brought One Step Closer' an unintended play, perhaps, on Armstrong's first words upon landing on the moon, about small and giant steps for humankind. A recent article, 'U.S. Plans Super Computer for Defense', inAviation Week and Space Technology, alerts us that an estimated 500 million will be spent over the next seven years to develop an 'nth generation' system of high speed integrated circuitry, 'a multi-processor capable of incorporating waferscale integration, knowledge bases, reasoning systems, and human-like interactions'. These super computers will be embedded in a weapon 'able to see, reason, plan and control actions, understand, interpret and represent. They will be autonomous systems, able to receive general instructions, navigate to the field of action, carry out a military mission and return for further instructions.'1 We are assured, however, that much of the technology developed for the super computer will filter its way eventually to the civil sector. Technology is developed within a particular cultural context of social, economic, political, and military requirements which affect the ways that research and development are conducted, how the technology is implemented, its role and its purposes, and to what effects. Technology can never be neutral. Technology assessment must proceed from this understanding. To avoid this fundamental assumption as many engineers, technicians, scientists, and commentators do is to ignore the constructs within which technology is determined. In our current historical period, with the promotion of information technologies and the encouragement to transform our social institutions (our places of work and our homes to fit the demands of the 'tele culture', we must recognize that our complex technological environ ments can facilitate or impede our chances of survival. Technology determines the quality of our life. Technology structures our roles and our relationships, and our values. The dominant technology in a culture and in our culture and time this refers to information technology shapes the character of per300tion and the very structure of the human mind. 216</page><page sequence="7">NOTES 1.
