<plain_text><page sequence="1">Arnold M. Rothstein* A GUIDE FOR MODIFICA TION OF E THNOPHA ULIST LANGUAGE On July 22, 1793, a player at the Opera Comique who had to make a public announcement made this unfortunate beginning: "Messieurs ..." "Say 'Citizens!' " came the roar from two thousand throats. "Citizens, Mile. Jenny. . ." "Say 'Citizenness!' " "Citizens, Citizenness Jenny is indisposed and we beg of you to ac- cept in her place Mlle. Chevalier." Then there was a perfect storm of protests. The unfortunate man in vain pleaded to be excused, blamed his absent-mindedness, the force of habit - the spectators threw their seats at him. (1) During the French Revolution, one had to shout " vive la Nation " in order to prove one's loyalty. If among its pages, history records humanity's crimes and follies, what we have to shout today may add to that record. Indeed, some publishers are telling us what the imper- missible locutions are! At least half a dozen, the most recent being the American Psychological Association (June, 1977), have produced guides for equal treatment of the sexes in textbooks.(2) Putatively, an objective is to introduce measured fairness, if not exact balance, in an endeavor to affect attitudes (usually referred to as "image"). The publishers appear to be concerned with the denigration and disparagement implicit in sexist language and the resulting malice in deed as well as word. It is, therefore, believed to be timely to establish •Arnold Rothstein is Professor of Educational Foundations, City College of the City University of New York. 269</page><page sequence="2">270 Etcetera • SEPTEMBER 1978 an alert regarding the more encompassing, subsuming, and resurgent dangers of an unlimited ethnophaulism.(S) The commentary which is offered in the succeeding pages extends the spirit of the non-sexist guides and is intended primarily as a spur to publishers towards pro- ducing a more formal elaboration and comprehensive treatment of our carefree ethnophaulist usages, as well as further recommendations for their alteration. There is, however, a basic difference between the recommendations offered here and those found in the non-sexist guides, particularly that of the American Psychological Association. The recommendations take into account, and are in keeping with, the psychological idea of outlet and venting. It appears to be a widely held view that the evolu- tion of the race has tended towards the gradual erosion of individual physical aggression, e.g., duelling, and its replacement by verbal substitutes. As suggested in Words and Women , obscenity is an ex- pression of "the deep-rooted need for symbols of the forbidden." Thus, one ought not suppress four- letter words; one cleanses them "through use in a non-pornographic manner. "(4) It seems plausible, then, that a function of the occasional use of what may be called tabu expressions is to be able to "let off steam" at an object or being which/ whom we perceive as blocking or injuring us. For example, is it entirely unsoothing for us to emit an expletive when bruising our thumb in striking it- not the nail - with a hammer? This suggests some kind of related justification for what may be characterized as in- offensive name-calling. If this were not so, a large part of what we, in America, tend to consider as humor, might disappear. Certainly, that species of humor on television, known as "the roast," by which an in- dividual is honored through insult is a case in point. Moreover, there appears to be a certain futility in the laundering of verbal expression with too strong a bleaching agent; one can be left with a non-distinctive costume or even just a remnant of one, ser- viceable, to be sure, as a loincloth. (One is reminded of the recent ac- tion of the government of Albania which ordered citizens "whose names do not conform to the country's political, ideological, and moral standards" - to change them.) Between such an extreme and no laundering at all, there is considerable distance- sufficient for an intermediate position serving a negative function. It is usually the position occupied by an anti -defamation organization, committed to dealing with the grosser forms of denigration and with calumny. Thus, rather than repeal words French Revolutionary or publisher style, i.e., through verbal legislation, substitutes are recommended which allow the human need for inoffensive name-calling to find some outlet. As the title of this article indicates, it is not a guide to</page><page sequence="3">Modification of Ethnophaulist Language 27 1 non-ethnophaulist language, but rather a guide for the modification of ethnophaulisms. I shall present here only some fairly common ethnophaulisms in random order and leave to scholars of the abstruse the task of uncover- ing the full glossary of words and expressions suitable for an Index of Prohibited Locutions. Following the listing of the questionable usage is some explanation regarding its ethnophaulist connections as well as recommendation for replacement or substitution - a cleansing as it were- not a tabu-ing. First, however, I have to speak of two principles and their derivatives which will be used fairly consistently to modify, not abolish, the ethnophaulist quality: the necrophobic principle and zoographisms. (It may be seen that the cause of mental health is served in the employment of these two principles in that they permit a psychological outlet.) The necrophobic principle is a recommendation for disparagement of those who are long dead, i.e. , an extinct culture. It is tolerable on at least two counts in that 1) it is in keeping with our particular cultural style to venerate the ongoing; 2) the dead cannot hear anyway. (The injunction in Leviticus 19:14 about not cursing the deaf refers, of course, to those living, not to those who cannot hear because they are not alive.) Frequent reference to this principle will be made as an ac- ceptable vent, in that it leaves us with some color in our expressions in- stead of leaching them out entirely. The zoographic principle is another acceptable vent for human an- tipathies towards others by which we refer to behavior or to the people themselves in animal terms. Some may prefer the zoographic solution rather than an unsoftened ethnophaulism which the necrophobic principle seems to imply- i.e., the aspersing of others, albeit dead, in purely human terms. Let me try to state the case for zoographisms at the outset. The case for the necrophobic principle may be better understood within the direct context of the commentary itself. First, there is precedence and continuity in zoographisms such as the following: "Male-chauvinist-pig," "he's a wolf with women," "he behaves like an ape," "he drinks like a fish," "he struts like a peacock," "he wormed his way in," "is he a man or a mouse?" "he's a son-of-a- bitch," "he's a dumb ox," "he's a snake-in- the-grass," "he's a perfect jackass." (5) (See important note on this, in Notes section.) Second, what may appear as derogation (of animals) may actually reveal our reverence for the unity of life. After all, we do praise the animal world too, as in: "he works like a beaver (or horse)," "busy as a bee," "swift as an eagle," "strong as a lion," "rising like a phoenix," "the memory of an elephant," "a foxy fellow," "a clever jackal," "shed- ding crocodile tears."</page><page sequence="4">272 Etcetera • September 1978 Third, we may recall that the game bird, turkey (however mispro- nounced and misnamed), still stands for the name of a country, that John Bull is a symbol for the doughty English, and that the pelican was a symbol for the Redeemer in Christianity. If further proof were needed of the acceptability of zoographisms, we have only to note how theriophilism (love of beasts) and therioanthropy (combining human and animal forms, e.g., centaurs) were elevated into theological systems in ancient Egypt, Crete, and India. Indeed, some may detect in the names given to football teams, automobiles, and motorboats in our day, a renascent theriophilism. It may be seen, then, that necrophobia and zoography, in not tampering with self-protective mechanisms, are psychologically un- damaging to the user. Of course, for those who are being characterized, the situation is otherwise. Perhaps psychologists can help us to deal with almost all negative circumstance in purely non-ethnophaulist terms. This could be a real challenge for the APA. As undisputed authorities on verbal release and logotherapy, they might be of particular help in producing the appropriate guide. And now, let us proceed to fifteen illustrations of ethnophaulism. 1. When someone speaks unintelligibly (or if we do not understand), it may be something of an historic recompense to the Hellenes (who regarded all non-Greeks equally as barbarians), to say: " It's Greek to mer For those who want to say simply: "I don't understand it," this might put a strain on the self-protective mechanism in that it requires control of a basic egocentrism which is extraordinary. For example, when it is we who do not hear a speaker, we are prone to shout: "Louder! Can't you speak up?" Or, if we cannot read (or understand) some words easily, we tend to blame the print, the lighting, or the author. In any event, the expression "I don't understand" is a challenging test of our humanism - of not ascribing our weakness or failing to someone else. For the time being, some simpler alternatives are proferred. Yet, appropriate modifications of " It's Greek to mei' are not as simple as might appear. To speak of "gibberish" or even "jibber- jabber," slurs the Arabs, to wit: the Arabic algarabía , whence the French word for nonsense, charabia. There are those who believe that "jibber jabber" came from aljebr (algebra), which study, for some, is not only onomatopoetically akin to gibberish, but still does not dispute the Arabic origin of the word. Even when it is fully demonstrated that</page><page sequence="5">Modification of Ethnnophaulist Language 273 it was the Persians, and not the Arabs, who invented algebra, gib- berish as a substitute would still be referring to a living people. In the meantime, until the scholarly dispute is settled, we have to search elsewhere. To say that someone "babbles, " although an affront to the ancient Babylonians (Babel) would, on the necrophobic principle, be acceptable. If one prefers to use the zoographic principle, "It's like buzzing (or croaking) to me" is an acceptable alternative. 2. To be a Gipsy in the sense of following a life pattern of wandering from place to place, and the notion of gypping, that is, fleecing some- one (the zoography may be noted), are ethnophaulisms of high quality. First, it is offensive to Gipsies (Gypsies?) to consider them as expellees from Egypt in some kind of Second Exodus (and, thereby, confusing them with the "wandering Jews"), as it is offensive to Egyp- tians to have their name corrupted and linked with a foreign people. (The people referred to as Gipsies originated, as did many Europeans, in India.) Second, in the case of the gipsy moth, there is a reversal of the zoographic principle: insects are made to take on the behavior of humans. (Similarly, in the plant known as "the wandering Jew," we have a reversal of a botanographism.) There is a distinction between giving people the names of insects, plants, òr animals and giving in- sects, plants, and animals names used to identify people. (See listing #14 in this regard.) And so, the problem is rather difficult. In this in- stance, it might be best to employ a variant of the necrophobic princi- ple, i.e., to revivify an ancient people like the Philistines, Lesbians, Boeotians, or Gepidae and to call the Gipsies by that name. After all, as the government of Albania would say, "what's in a name?" (A rose by any other name . . .)As for gypping someone and calling her/him a gyp, unless we discover that it is the name of an actually existing people, "swindler'* is an easy alternative. 3. The appellation, Scotchman, to denote miser is clearly a confusion with the beverage known as Scotch and, on this count alone, it is worthy of an interdict. A Scot is Scottish and, on un-neuterized occa- sions, a Scotsman. (6) What to do to indicate tight-fistedness more or less inoffensively? Zoography might be acceptable since squirrels do hoard; however, again it might be preferable to revive a non- flourishing people like the ancient Boeotians. Since they were the butt</page><page sequence="6">274 Etcetera • SEPTEMBER 1978 of so much disrespect in their own day, it may be well not to break with tradition. 4. It is now poor form to welsh on a debt. We simply are permanently in arrears- which is distinct from gypping someone. Changing the spell- ing and calling someone a welcher is but an orthographic disguise for a non- Yankee act. How to indicate the refusal to honor a debt? Since ethics do not enter into animal behavior, zoography would be inac- curate, hence, necrophobia - unspecified- is again recommended. 5. Going Dutch treat is now fairly innocuous in connotation but it was clearly derisive in its suggestion that the burghers of Holland were ungracious hosts. The practice of asking for separate bills in restaurants now clearly violates an important social convention in some instances, i.e., saving on income tax. Hence, to add this form of anachronism- past to present rather than present to past - to implied impoliteness is not in keeping with our liberal temper. If "pay your own way" is too forthright, the unspecified necrophobic principle is recommended on the theory that the dead, being dead, cannot be in- sulted. The next four designations are only mildly disparaging and, in some cases, have come to possess almost an affectionate quality. Yet, this very quality increases the necessity for alteration. If one is to ask why an interdict is now required on the employment of expressions characterizing another day and age, it is because of our regard for anachronistic symmetry. Merely to reform the present is insufficient. Verbally, at least, the past too must be cleansed and purged to support our present moral posture or else we stand accused of condoning it. Consider the French Revolutionaries. Not only did they do away with a reigning monarch but even dead kings in marble sarcophagi were under attack. Henry IV, preserved for 180 years, had his coffin opened and his beard cut off. (7) This would be an example of- among other things- an anachronism. Kings and Queens in ivory and ebony chess sets had their crowns broken. (8) This would be an ex- ample of- among other things- symmetry. Now, if we apply the idea of anachronistic symmetry to the APA Guide, for instance, we can understand better some suggestions: first year student at college is often more accurate than freshman. Similarly, perhaps "all men at</page><page sequence="7">MODIFICATION OF ETHNOPHAULIST LANGUAGE 275 battle stations/' as a relic of a darker age, can be up-dated to "all staff . . ." Thus, it is not without misgivings that the recommendations for circumlocution are made in the succeeding four listings. 6. To live a Bohemian life may intend to convey the idea of being color- fully unorthodox, but the expression clearly demeans Bohemians who might prefer to live a life as Bohemians without being derogated as Bohemian. After all, designations do cause problems and the way to resolve them is to remove the designation. Zoography is recommended or, perhaps botanography, as in "going to seed." 7. A Frog is an amphibian and not an accurate shorthand description of people of Gallic origin. It will be noted that in this usage, the zoographic principle had already been anticipated, but somehow this zoographism tends to offend, perhaps because of an aversion to cer- tain foods. On the other hand, gustatory appeal may account for Turkey remaining a geographic location. The solution here- logography- is decidedly different from all other recommendations. Taking a cue from the Australians, to describe the French as wi-wi (oui, oui) might even be considered tolerably cute. 8. Limey has been considered semi-endearing in that it provides us with accurate historical evidence of the sagacity of the Royal British Navy regarding the prevention of vitamin C deficiency. In this instance, too, we can see the anticipation of the botanographic principle. Yet, as do the opprobrious epithets, this designation focuses on but one characteristic - presumably a defect- and magnifies it (the dominant technique in almost all stereotyping). Allow it to stand and the march towards international good will will be impeded. For solution, taking a suggestion from #7 above, a logographic principle may be employed; for example, "By Jovians." As another alternative, the British respect for tradition may be honored and their own zoographic (or boanthropic) "John Bull " may be adopted. Before we take leave of the English (which is distinct from the French canard about taking English leave , i.e., not paying bills, or gypping), it is well to observe that some of us, at least, are disrespectful towards John Bull in that a privy is frequently referred to as a John .</page><page sequence="8">276 Etcetera • SEPTEMBER 1978 While we may euphemize, the Italians literalize and call a privy an Englishman. So, on the one hand, we have an ethnophaulic slur against the English and, on the other, a sexist depreciation of men, at least those called John. With a plethora of euphemisms for toilet already in existence - a room for laving, bathing, or resting- the problem should have received treatment by the preparers of non-sexist guides. 9. As with the preceding, the affectionate bugger has to be proscribed because of its kinship with buggery, a practice ascribed to Bulgarians (Bugari or Bougre). While the medieval Church could regard Bulgarians as heretics who were opposed to procreation (but not to coupling), were we to avoid noting the origins of this affectionate term, we would stand indicted of condoning a darker age. Thus, as the non-sexist guides enjoin us, anachronistic symmetry is the order of the day, and simple expunging is advised. The two appellations which follow are tolerable on the necrophobic principle- at least for the time being- until a descendant who is cer- tain of her/his(9) lineage lodges a complaint with the Commission on Human Rights. (Gascons have been known to complain about gascon- nada as a synonym for boasting. Thus far, textbooks and dictionaries have not been affected.) These are: 10. Philistine, as describing a loutish dolt who is anti-culture - a boor, like the ancient Boeotians. (Evidently, such residents of Boeotia as Hesiod, Pindar, and Plutarch were not considered typical.) It has to be pointed out, however, that objections may yet come to be raised because of the kinship of Philistine to the Arabic word for Palestine - Falastin. 11. Lesbian , as describing a female-of-the-human species who seeks sexual involvement with another female-of-the-human species. In anticipa- tion that a present-day resident of the isle of Lesbos may register a complaint, we should be prepared to substitute homosexuality for Les- bianism. Now, some may have considerable conceptual difficulty in exchanging Lesbian for homosexual, but these are probably sexists</page><page sequence="9">MODIFICATION OF ETHNOPHAULIST LANGUAGE 277 who confuse mankind with male. In deference to such, a simple way out of the difficulty is to use the Greek term, homoerotic ; after all, Lesbos was Hellenic in culture. 12. We come to some ethnophaulisms which seem unique within the classification itself, although there may be some resemblance to #7 in the employment of a variant of the zoographic principle: Jewess , Negress. There are no examples in English where the suffix "ess" (used to denote the female of a species, as in lioness or tigress), describes members of an ethnic or racial group. In both instances above, the small case is frequently employed for even further diminution. That French-ess, Dutch-ess, Albanian-ess, Muslim-ess, Mongol-ess would be "stenches in the ear" is evident; Jewess and negr ess have seemed to carry less odor. But, then, princess, duchess, countess, and goddess may be tolerable whereas sorceress, waitress, seamstress, and laundress are not. Is it the suffix or the social position which creates the prob- lem? (If "chairwoman" were not easily confused with "charwoman," would it be a permissible locution? In this instance, the non-sexist guides prefer the principle of neuterization.) It has to be recognized that all is fair (and logical) in a war. Historian Ruth Schwartz Cowan, commenting on Jacques Barzun's criticism of chairperson, wrote in a letter to the editor: "The feminist rationale for that barbarous neologism ... is neither linguistic or esthetic - but purely political." (10) Apparently, Cowan accounts for the martial quality which ac- companies some of the neologisms offered by guides dedicated to the diffusion of humanism: never use the language of the oppressor. (One is reminded of the refusal of some individuals- frequently performing artists such as singers and actors- to perform or speak in the language of a culture or people which has done their own ethnic group some in- jury.)(ll) Thus, in the confluence in #12 above, between a logically superordinate ethnophaulism and its tributary, sexism, it is the latter which is more apparent- since it is there that political organization has taken place. But the problem remains: what do we do with "jewess" and "negress" as aspects of ethnophaulism. The recommendation here is that all that needs to be done with an obscenity is to identify it as such, this being sufficient to modify it. Free-speech enthusiasts, while or- dinarily zealous about the necessity of maintaining other obscenities in a kind of ordnance store for use against certain other groups, might passionately rail against this variety, perhaps because of the con-</page><page sequence="10">278 Etcetera • SEPTEMBER 1978 fluence noted above. Yet, does passionate prudery justify expunction of so valuable a document from the archives of human history? IS. China-man is sui generis . Maybe the Chinese believe this about themselves, as do most of us. It is the only nationality which, in English, is referred to by the name of a country plus man . (Similarly, a designation is formed from a people or national grouping plus boy , as in the obscenity, Jew-boy.) Again, one may note the confluence of ethnophaulism and (a different species of) sexism. Turkey-man, India-man, Syria-man, Brazil-man, Poland-man, or America-man are not only flagrantly unmusical; they are unadjectival too. (Atten- tion is called to the distinction between Chinatown and Germantown.) To avoid sui generis , custom and usage in English dictate that the Chinese are better described by an adjective rather than by a noun (unless we are engaged in war!). There are, to be sure, some non -opprobrious and even non- humorous designations which can remain untouched; for instance, Turkish towels, Persian melons, and Chinese apples. Similarly, Greek olives, French toast, Hungarian goulash, and Jewish rye are not un- savory, and all ethnically-labelled salad dressings are equally non- pungent. 14. In the collection of ethnically or geographically-based diseases, we come to a sort of ultimate in ethnophaulist expression. It probably grew out of the honored imprecation: "A plague on your house!" Thus, we have German measles, Asian flu, Dutch Elm blight, and the naming of certain undesirable insects by their presumed country of origin, e.g., Japanese beetle. Older examples, such as English pox and French pox, seem to have fallen into desuetude, perhaps because of detente between the indicated governments. Maybe the moral is, if one wants to love, one invents the right words and if one wants to hate, one invents the right words. Be that as it may, a simple solution in the above cases is to apply the principle of non-existence or non-entity, i.e., attaching archaic geographic names of places that did not really exist; old maps are rich in this resource. It will be remembered that the ancients invented names for a variety of deities and it then became extremely simple to abolish existence, merely by name-erasure or name-change. One has only to recall that the Egyptian Pharoah Akhenaten destroyed the god Amen by changing his own name from</page><page sequence="11">Modification of Ethnophaulist Language 279 Amenhotep, and that the revolutionists after him destroyed the god Aten by erasing his name from buildings and statues. 15. More difficult than the foregoing is the laundering and dye-ing that would have to be done on colors as symbols. Is it accidental that the color symbol for purity, innocence, and goodness resembles snow while that of baseness, roguery, and evil resembles pitch? At one time, a necromancer or specialist in communicating with the dead through magic was held to be practicing a black art. Indeed, the practice was misspelled as nigromantia , rather than necromantia, in medieval Latin. To some, it is perhaps irrelevant that early race experiences - e.g., the noting of the contrasting phenomena of daylight and night - may have helped to fix color associations and have come to affect such practices as dressing brides in white, and devils in black, costumes. Such primeval and empirically-based associations and symbolisms are now being questioned out of regard for anachronistic symmetry. Perhaps a reified bog of one's own cultivation awaits experimentation with words denoting colors, e.g., "yellow-belly," "black sheep," "fair- haired boy." Thus, in this area, recognizing the bedrock upon which the matter rests, no recommendations are offered except the observa- tions that: "... speech asserts itself in its struggle with language," and it may well be, as the author suggests, that "imperfect language is preferable to the terror of speechlessness. "(12) Some Conclusions It will be noted that, in addition to the recommendations for transmuting ethnophaulisms- necrophobia and zoography, not to ex- clude botanography, entomography, and logography- there is a col- lection of well-established practices for venting a variety of feelings towards "others," from ridicule to contempt. These include jokes about dating oneself and similar references to accumulation of years, as well as the verbal jibes based on other kinds of infirmity, weakness, or deficiency such as baldness, fatness, lameness, slowness, or a non- home-grown accent. Then, too, our tendency to ascribe identity almost entirely on the nature of one's work, trade, or occupation ap- pears to enable us to perfect the art of focusing on but one aspect of a human being; it facilitates neat encapsulation to refer to "a shrink." Similarly, class- ism - such sociological groupings as bourgeois, middle class, and society- permits rapid collection and indexing of large</page><page sequence="12">280 Etcetera • SEPTEMBER 1978 agglomerated abstractions enveloped under a useful reification. Another automatic tongue-exerciser, the ever-popular denomina- tions, liberal/ conservative, allow as precise a means of identification as the uniforms of athletes enable us to recognize the competing teams without our getting confused. (Those who occupy themselves with developing sexist and racist glossaries will find the class-ist vents par- ticularly helpful in furthering bellicism - the on-going warfare against a subdivision of humanity. Indeed, it is noteworthy how reformers generally launch their attack under the banner of humanitarianism, yet, in the very utterance of their claims, they destroy the universalism which they purportedly would advance.) Finally, there is the bedrock of egoism in which the vertical pronoun becomes the absolute norm. It permits the attribution of one's feelings to others and allows us to iden- tify the world inside us with the world outside. Now, it may be that, as a result of having called attention to the matter, publishers and other humanitarians may begin to focus on the preparation of additional guides to expunge age-ism, class-ism, or some other "isms" from our thoughts. These may come to interfere with the venting processes described above, but it seems a small price to pay for achieving an ages-old dream of human-hood. For, as has been stated earlier, ethnophaulism is the linguistic ex- pression of xenophobia - fear of the stranger and of strangeness. Con- sequently, it is through proclamations of equality that we successfully attack the very concept of the strange . We like what we are like , and if there are no unlikes to display their differentiation, there can be no counter-response of not-liking. Therefore, popularization of non- differentiation, through proliferation of guides to permissible and im: permissible locutions, would treat the problem at its core: (14) each of us could then be certain that no conceptual strangeness (unlikeness) can arise to generate distrust and fear. (It may be recalled how, earlier, in speaking of bleaching agents which do away with distinctive garments and costumes, a similar idea was expressed.) Of course, it will take some time before conceptual likeness can be achieved, but as there will only be a gradually dwindling minority that will strive to protest its differentiation, in time it will be absorbed into the mass of likeness and, hence, of likeability. With an achievement such as this within our grasp - so-to- "speak" - it seems trivial to entertain the charge of language van- dalism so often attributed to verbal legislation. Yet, even here, we see that, to the contrary, the verbal legislation contained in proclama- tions and guides is actually a form of language development. It differs from good grammar guides only in that the latter, historically, point towards past usages and the former - concerned with what is yet to</page><page sequence="13">Modification of Ethnophaulist Language 28 1 be - towards future usages; however, the effectiveness of the function- ing of either kind of guide can hardly be disputed. If the experience of the French Revolutionaries is any indication - they destroyed the very conception of a king by an attack on playing cards wherein the kings, queens, and knaves were replaced by sages, virtues, and heroes(15)- at least the following will be achieved: 1. There will be developed a new species of sanctified utterance and, hence, a new species of profantiy. After all, the sin of blasphemy can only be perpetrated if certain ideas and expressions are con- sidered holy. (16) Moreover, since there is little fun in using dirty words if they no longer shock, we need a new stock of tabu expres- sions, the old ones having been drained of their force by various reform movements. 2. As a corollary of the foregoing, the invention of euphemisms will be stimulated. As we know, in all above-ground pruning, un- disturbed roots continue to throw out new branches and leaves. We are, therefore, protected against the staleness of but one word per object or idea. 3. We will have an ever-expanding mass of citizen-sentries, dedicated to verbal hygiene in atonement and expiation for historic wrongs. This will permit easy identification of the "goodies" and "bad- dies. " In addition, through persistent watchfulness over public linguistic morality, the sorry mistakes of the past can be reconstructed to conform with the new outlook. In sum, we are to be afforded an example of the tragi-comic: in the expansion and diffusion of that which is considered complimentary to human beings, there need not be, willy-nilly, an ineluctable expansion and diffusion of that which is considered opprobrious. Our sense of self will be enriched and deepened by yet another of humankind's historically recurrent efforts to control collective thought, and the record of follies in human history can be augmented. NOTES AND REFERENCES 1 . The replacing of the words Monsieur and Madame by the appellations Citoyen (Citizen) and Citoyenne (Citizenness) occurred a few months before vous (used as a singular pronoun) was banished from the language and tutoiement (the use of the second person singular pronoun) became obligatory. The usage was promulgated in a resolution issued by the Paris Commune, dated August 21, 1792.

If, as non-sexist guides indicate, we are now to have a "jill-of-all-trades," it would seem consistent to have a "jill-ass" too. Indeed, some guides seem to pick and choose only certain designations for disinfecting from bias, i.e., those that ap- pear to be complimentary. If angelic terms are to be diffused without regard to race, color, or previous condition of servitude, fairness would dictate the diffu- sion of diabolic terms and expressions as well. 6.

Cowan writes: "On the day that publishers' representatives who are trying to sell me textbooks . . . and colleagues who are requesting reprints all stop addressing me as 'Dear Sir' - on that day, and not before, I will allow Barzun to address me as Madam Chairman." Ibid. 12. N. L. Jacobs, Naming Day in Eden (New York: The Macmillan Co., 1959), p. 133. 13. The non-ethnophaulist guide par excellence is found in Exodus 22:20. In thirty- five other places in the Pentateuch, there is a similar admonition: "Do not wrong a stranger nor oppress him for you were strangers in the land of Egypt." This statement contrasts sharply with the absence of explicit proclamations of, and about, equality. It may be that empirical assertions that "all are equal" were considered less effective than moral admonitions to refrain from treating an alien in ways different from a resident. 14. As the Executive Director, Dictionary Division, of the American Heritage Publishing Company tells us: "Concerned people (women and men) are chang- ing the English language. We are modifying it in perfectly viable ways to eliminate its bias. To us, person and human are indeed words to be cherished for they are words that can include any member of the human race." (Alma Graham, Letter to the Editor, The Columbia Forum, Fall, 1974, Inside Cover.)</page><page sequence="15">Modification of Ethnophaulist Language 283 That language possesses bias may be a colloquially acceptable personification or anthropomorphism, but some other dangers seem not to be anticipated by writer Graham in her zeal. Cherished words that include "any member of the human race" can, on one hand, result in the transformation or dissolution of a particular human being into an airy quality even as cant and lip-service are mistaken for humane dealings. On the other hand, there is the expectation that only the "good" qualities are to be diffused and distributed to "any member of the human race." That the distribution of not-so-good qualities will not, perforce, be diffused by the same process of inclusion appears to reflect the view that actions have only intended consequences. However, perhaps it is necessary to satisfy our reformist needs through language reform, embracing the triune doctrine of fundamentalism, literalism, and scholasticism. 15. Henderson, op. cit., p. 264. 16. It appears to be necessary to disguise reality, at least linguistically, in order to show our mastery of it. "Scotch-on- the-rocks" (rather than "Scotch, on ice") may be more fashionable, more musical, more informal, more casual, more colorful. It is also a way of escaping staid rules and conventional morality- a way of saying one thing to mean something else. This creates the illusion of power, of alteration of what exists. Hence, the need for euphemisms, tabu- breakers, and circumlocutions of all kinds; these and other linguistic tools ob- viate the need for, or resort to, direct physical action or outlet.</page></plain_text>
