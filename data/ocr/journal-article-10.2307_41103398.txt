<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Possible Fluteplayer Pictograph Site Near Exshaw, Alberta Martin P. R. Magne* and Michael A. Klassen1 Abstract: Thirty-five years ago Thelma Hab- good described a faint pictograph at the Grotto Canyon site in southwestern Alberta as a possible "Kokopelli" image. Polarized light photography undertaken in 2001 has greatly enhanced the pictograph panel, clearly revealing a possible fluteplayer motif and anthropomorphs that resemble the southwestern Fremont style. Even though certain elements of the panel may have been created at different times, we conclude that the site may be related to Hopi traditions concerning northward travels of the Flute Clan, although other explanations certainly cannot be discounted. Résumé: II y a trente-cinq ans, Thelma Hab- good décrivit un pâle pictogramme sur le site de Grotto Canyon, dans le sud-ouest de l'Alberta, comme étant vraisemblable- ment une représentation de «Kokopelli». Une photographie sous lumière polarisée, prise en 2001, a sensiblement fait ressortir la paroi du pictogramme, révélant clairement l'image d'un joueur de flûte et des anthro- pomorphes illustrés dans le style Fremont du sud-ouest. Bien que certains éléments de la paroi puissent avoir été créés en diverses circonstances, nous concluons que le site peut confirmer les traditions des Hopi ayant trait aux voyages vers le nord du Flute Clan, même si d'autres explications semblent cer- tainement possibles. the past decade, the pictographs of Grotto Canyon (EgPt-9), in the Rocky Mountains near Exshaw, Alberta, have been the focus of debate among archaeologists interested in Alberta rock art (Figure 1). The site is located at the approximate boundary between the Columbia Plateau and Northwestern Plains rock art tradition regions (Keyser and Klassen 2001), but does not fit well with the rock art of either region. Although some pictographs at this site, namely the zoomorphs and several of the anthropomorphs, show similarities to the southeastern Columbia Plateau tradition, a number are unlike any other rock art in the Northwestern Plains or Columbia Plateau. The most striking of these is what appears to be a depiction of a fluteplayer. Overall, the images bear a striking resemblance to rock art of the American Southwest. Since 1992, the authors have explored various ways of explaining the origins of these pictographs, but our efforts have been hampered by the faintness of the images. Even under the best lighting conditions, the details of the pictographs are difficult to make out with the naked eye, due to the fading of the paint medium and to a thin, translucent min- eral deposit that obscures the images. These conditions also make the picto- graphs extremely difficult to discern with conventional photography. tParks Canada, 550-220-4 Ave SE, Calgary AB T2G 4X3 [marty_magne@pch.gc.ca] *Klahanee Heritage Research, 1-2812 Yukon Street, Vancouver BC V5Y 3R2 [mklassen@telus.net] Canadian Journal of Archaeology/Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 25: 1-24 (2001) H3</page><page sequence="2">2 • MAGNE AND KLASSEN / ALBERTA I Grotto Canyon -'# 0 Calgary EgPt-1 ' I .

These new pho- tographs give more weight to our argu- ment that some of the pictographs at Grotto Canyon resemble Southwest rock art motifs, including a fluteplayer and possible Fremont style anthropo- morphs. Setting The pictographs are reached by a dra- matic journey into Grotto Canyon. Visi- tors to the site must follow Grotto Creek, a tributary of the Bow River, into a small mountain valley that quickly becomes a narrow, twisting canyon. Imposing cliffs loom high overhead, topped by dark, overhanging pines - only a narrow strip of sky remains visible, and the rushing water nearly drowns out all other sound. Rounding a bend, the pictographs sud- denly become visible on a smooth, lime- stone wall at the canyon's narrowest point (Figure 2). Beyond the site, the canyon appears to dead end at a high cliff, but it actually makes a sharp bend to the left, then opens up into a broad, luxu- riant, alpine valley. This journey, pass- ing through a narrow canyon from one wide valley to another, is a passage between two mountain realms. That the pictographs occur at the narrowest point - the nexus between the two worlds - hardly seems coincidental. Indeed, the pictographs may mark a sacred place, and the physical setting is consistent with many other rock art sites in the region, suggesting that the landscape context is a significant com- ponent of the rock art symbolism.

However, the site was only brought to the notice of archaeolo- gists in 1955 when Douglas Leechman, the newly appointed Director of the Glenbow Foundation in Calgary, pub- lished a short overview of Alberta picto- graph sites in the Bulletin of the National Museum of Man (Leechman et al. 1955). Margaret Hess, a lawyer active in local archaeology, had reported the Grotto Canyon site to Leechman in 1952. Leech- man noted that the pictographs "are becoming obscured by a thin deposit of translucent calcite .... Even when they are wet, it is difficult to see them clearly, and satisfactory photography is almost impos- sible" (Leechman et al. 1955: 48-49). Leechman included a crude drawing of the site in the publication (Figure 3A), but this did not draw attention to the fluteplayer image.

Canadian Journal of Archaeology 26 (2002)</page><page sequence="5">A POSSIBLE FLUTEPLAYER PICTOGRAPH SITE • 5 In 1960, the Glenbow Foundation commissioned Selwyn Dewdney to make drawings of all then-known rock art sites in Alberta (Dewdney 1962). Combining rice paper tracing with freehand sketch- ing, Dewdney made a drawing of the site on August 3, 1962 (Figure 4). Although we now recognize additional images and details on the panel, Dewdney's rendi- tion of the pictographs is remarkably precise, and his drawing reveals the fluteplayer and anthropomorphs, as well as two lines of animals, fairly accurately for the first time. Neither Dewdney nor the Glenbow Foundation site record recognized the possible relationship of the Grotto Canyon motifs to Southwest rock art. This connection was first made by Thelma Habgood (1967) who published an over- view of Alberta rock art sites based largely on Dewdney's drawings. Although many of Habgood's interpretations of Alberta rock art are questionable by today's stan- dard, she did briefly note the resem- blance of some of the Grotto Canyon pictographs to similar images in South- west rock art. Indeed, she described one anthropomorphic figure as resembling "some pictographs of the hump-backed fluteplayer, the kachina "Kokopelli" from northeastern Arizona" (Figure 3b; Hab- good 1967: 15, Figure 43). The differ- ences between the drawings in Habgood (1967) andLeechmanetal. (1955) (Fig- ures 3A and B) illustrate the difficulty of accurately perceiving the images with the naked eye. Given the faintness of the images, it is perhaps not surprising that Habgood's intriguing observations were overlooked by subsequent researchers for many years. Except for the occasional site visit or brief mention in publications (e.g., Brink 1981), the Grotto Canyon picto- graphs were largely unnoticed by archae- ologists for the next 25 years. In 1992, the Alberta Historical Resources Founda- tion funded a project to revisit all known rock art sites in Alberta and update site records (Klassen 1994, 2002). During a 1992 visit by Klassen, the light condi- tions were ideal and the panel was wet from recent rain, which made the picto- graphs stand out clearly from the trans- lucent mineral deposit. Klassen (1994) recognized the similarity of the anthro- pomorphs at the site to Southwest fluteplayer and other ceremonial motifs, even though he was not familiar with Habgood's (1967) mention of a possible "Kokopelli" at the time. Because of the favourable light conditions, it was pos- sible to obtain reasonably clear photo- graphs and make accurate tracings of the anthropomorphs (Figure 5). The existence of a possible fluteplayer at Grotto Canyon was immediately brought to the attention of Magne, then at the Archaeological Survey of Alberta. Although both authors had been to the site before, the motif had not been rec- ognized. Initially, we both were unaware of the reference in Habgood's 1967 paper, but Jack Brink of the Archaeo- logical Survey of Alberta soon pointed this out. Since 1992, the authors, along with our colleague James D. Keyser, have been exploring possible explana- tions and interpretations for the Grotto Canyon pictographs. In particular, the resemblance to Southwest rock art imag- ery, including the fluteplayer motif, has been investigated (Klassen 1994; Keyser and Klassen 2001: 105-106). More recently, Magne has investigated Hopi traditions that may support this line of evidence. Nevertheless, until this year it has been difficult to support these interpretations due to the difficulty in photographing the pictographs.

THEPICTOGRAPHS All of the pictographs at Grotto Canyon are painted with a red, presum- ably hematite-based pigment. In terms of technique, hue, and condition, all of the pictographs on the panel appear to be associated and contemporaneous. There is no evidence to suggest that any of the figures were painted more recently than others. Most of the figures appear to have been painted using fingertips dipped in pigment. Many of the lines are finger width, and some clearly show a thinner layer of paint in the centre of the line where the fingertip pressure on the rock surface was greatest. Other line elements show extremely fine detail and could only have been painted using a thin "paintbrush" applicator. All of the figures are covered by a translucent mineral patina, which may be calcite, that has leached out of the limestone substrate due to rain and melt- water washing over the rock surface. In some places the mineral covering has spalled, often removing the underlying paint as well. Elsewhere lichen has grown Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 26 (2002)</page><page sequence="8">8 • MAGNE AND KLASSEN over the pictographs. Some of the patina has been polished smooth, presumably from many years of hands rubbing the surface in an effort to enhance the clar- ity of the images. The polished surfaces have often been assumed to be the result of someone using a varnish to preserve the images, but close inspection of the rock surface shows this to be incorrect. Some aspects of the Grotto Canyon pictographs resemble images found in other Northwestern Plains and Colum- bia Plateau rock art traditions (see Keyser [1992]; Keyser and Klassen [2001 ] ) . Other motifs, however, are rare or unknown from the region, including a variety of unusual anthropomorph and zoomorph figures (Figure 6). One anthropomorph with wide "rabbit ears" and a tapered torso holds a spear or staff (Colour Plate 1). This anthropo- morph is associated with two horizontal rows of animals that may be elk or car- ibou. Some of the animals have large antlers or bodies filled with a lattice pat- tern (Colour Plate 2). The rows of animals are similar in form and size, and follow imaginary ground lines, indi- cating that they were created at the same time as a unified composition. These zoomorphs, while distinct in some details, would not be out of place in Columbia Plateau rock art. Another group of three figures depicts highly abstracted humans, with tapered lower torsos ending in strange shapes instead of legs and feet (Colour Plate 3). Each wears a headdress and holds what may be clubs or other cere- monial objects. Although a few similar images are found on the Columbia Pla- teau at the Big Eddy site on the Snake River (see Keyser [1992: 106, 110]; Nes- bitt [1968]), these most closely resem- ble anthropomorphs found in Southwest rock art. Their unusual forms and details are reminiscent of shaman "transformer" art, suggesting a ceremonial relationship. The technique, degree of weathering, and the compositional arrangement of the figures - a row of similarly sized fig- ures along an imaginary ground line - indicates they were created at the same time as the other figures on the panel. Most intriguing, however, is a small, hunched-over human figure, with legs bent at the knees and arms reaching towards the head, placed below a verti- cal zig-zag line (Colour Plate 4). This figure has thin lines extending from the top front of its head and uses both hands to hold a thin object to its mouth. Although this image is unique in both Northwestern Plains and Columbia Pla- teau rock art (Keyser and Klassen 2001), if it occurred anywhere in the South- west it would be likely be recognized as a "fluteplayer" motif (Schaafsma 1980: 140; Slifer and Duffield 1994: 2-3) , often referred to improperly as "Kokopelli" (Malotki 2000). Immediately next to the fluteplayer are two faint images that are probably anthropomorphs. These are not as well executed as the other picto- graphs and are quite obscured by lichen and exfoliation. KOKOPELLI, KACfflNAS, AND THE FLUTEPLAYER In their popular book, Kokopelli: Ruteplayer Images in Rock Art, Slifer and Duffield (1994: 17-18) state that nearly 400 images of flute-playing humans are found at more than 80 rock art sites in Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and Col- orado, although thousands likely exist throughout the Southwest (Figure 1). The earliest fluteplayer images in the Southwest are considered to date from the Basketmaker III period (beginning about AD 500), and are most frequent in the Pueblo II and III periods after AD Canadian Journal of Archaeology 26 (2002)</page><page sequence="9">A POSSIBLE FLUTEPLAYER PICTOGRAPH SITE» 9 Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 26 (2002) .5 u a S ì 'S Ou O O&lt; § »y3 "ö CU a be L fi If ^ u ^ 2 a .S s.¡ 11 o ^ 0 O .S gag .S ä 1 Oh 2 rt Q § g X g § X 8 fe a</page><page sequence="10">10 • MAGNE AND KLASSEN 1000, although the motif is also known from rock art post-dating AD 1300 (Cole 1990: 144, 164; Schaafsma 1980: 122, 255). According to Malotki (2000: 136), "The fluteplayer rock art motif origi- nated in the Four Corners area around AD 800, reached its zenith from 1100 to 1400, and died out by 1600." The majority of fluteplayer images are found within the Anasazi culture region (Cole 1990; Schaafsma 1980: 122; Slifer and Duffield 1994: 4). The modern Pueblo groups, including the Hopi, are consid- ered the descendants of the Anasazi cul- ture (Plog 1997). Examples of this motif are also known from neighbouring cul- ture areas, including that of the Fre- mont (Figure 1). In Southwest rock art, the fluteplayer motif occurs in a number of rock art styles (Turner 1963; Wellmann 1979), and this motif is represented in many forms and with a great deal of variation (Figure 7). The Basketmaker III period fluteplayers are generally stick figures lacking a hump or phallus, and they are often shown seated or occasionally in pairs (Schaafsma 1980: 122). By AD Figure 7: Varieties of fluteplayers found in the Palavayu area of northeastern Arizona. Redrawn from McCreery and Malotki (1994: 157). Canadian Journal of Archaeology 26 (2002)</page><page sequence="11">A POSSIBLE FLUTEPLAYER PICTOGRAPH SITE • 1 1 1000, humpbacked and phallic fluteplay- ers have appeared, and both Schaafsma (1980: 136) and Cole (1990: 164) contend these Pueblo II and III period images are linked to the earlier Basketmaker period figures. These humpbacked fluteplayers may be shown reclining or "dancing," and some have insect attributes such as antennae (Schaafsma 1980: 141), or what may be feathers extending from their heads. Schaafsma (1980: 136) con- tends that some characteristics of the Pueblo II and III fluteplayers - includ- ing humpbacks and insect attributes - indicate supernatural qualities. They are sometimes associated with hunting scenes, while some representations of animals are shown playing flutes. The fluteplayer motif is often directly equated with "Kokopelli" (Schaafsma 1980: 140; Slifer and Duffield 1994: 2), or, more accurately, Kookopölö (Malotki 2000), a Hopi kachina or wu'ya (ances- tor spirit being). In the traditions of the Hopi people, Kookopölö is a hunch- backed trickster figure with special powers, who acts both as a fertility symbol and rain priest. In his hump, he carries seeds, blankets, and special gifts that he uses to seduce young women. In the contemporary Hopi kachina cult, masked dancers impersonate spirit beings and take on their characteris- tics. The Kookopölö kachina dancer has a hump and a long snout, and in the past he was phallic (Slifer and Duffield 1994: 8). Although Kookopölö does not play the flute (Schaafsma 1980: 141), in some Hopi rituals flutes are used to call in clouds and to attract rain. Kookopölö is also associated with the cicada, which is a totem of the Hopi Flute Society; in Hopi traditions, the cicada melted the snows when requested to by the snakes (Schaafsma 1980: 141). Largely due to KookopoWs characteris- tics, and his associations with the cicada and flutes, it is often popularly assumed that humpbacked, phallic, and insect- like fluteplayers in rock art have the same iconographie significance as the Kookopölö kachina. The conflation of rock art fluteplayers with Kookopölö may stem partly from early popularizations of Hopi traditions, such as Frank Waters' Book of the Hopi (1963: 45) where he states that "The locust mãhu is known as the Humpbacked Flute Player, the kachina named Kokopilau, because he looked like wood [koko - wood; pilau - humped]." On the other hand, some Hopi informants have identified fluteplayer images as a symbol of the Flute Clan (Slifer and Duffield 1994: 24-25), and others indicate that fluteplayer rock art images represent a cicada wu'ya. Malotki (2000: 137, 138) writes: "...older Hopis, when confronted with the fluteplayer in rock art, insist on calling him maahu, 'the cicada,' not 'Kokopelli.' The cicada.. .in Hopi cul- ture is considered to be 'fluting' when it makes its noise, thereby causing mumkiw, the gradual heating process that ripens crops. [T]he rock art fluteplayer more closely resembles the cicada in Hopi cul- ture than it does Kookopölö.n Malotki (2000: 13) also points out that the Kookopölö kachina is associated with the robber fly. To be precise, the cicada, also known as maahu, is a clan totem, or wu'ya, of the Flute clan. Certainly, some fluteplayers appear to have both insect and anthropomorphic attributes, includ- ing the Grotto Canyon figure. In the end, it is possible that fluteplayers represent a spirit being and clan symbol. However, the presumed age of most fluteplayer images precludes linking them directly to the Hopi or a specific Hopi clan; rather, it can only be suggested that the fluteplayer Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 26 (2002)</page><page sequence="12">12 • MAGNE AND KLASSEN motif is related to the ancestors of the contemporary Puebloan groups. The three "ceremonial" figures in the bottom right area of the panel at Grotto Canyon (Colour Plate 3) are nearly as intriguing as the fluteplayer. The details of their appearance are dissimilar to most anthropomorphs depicted in Northwest- ern Plains or Columbia Plateau rock art traditions (see Keyser and Klassen 2001: 100); indeed, like the fluteplayer, they are most similar to anthropomorphs in Southwest rock art (Figure 8), including "Basketmaker" anthropomorphs (McCre- ery and Malotki 1994), and particularly anthropomorphs depicted in "Fremont" rock art, which has resemblances to some Basketmaker anthropomorphs (Schaaf- sma 1971: 139). It is beyond the scope of this paper to fully explore the topic of the Fremont culture, but Jennings (1978) describes five Fremont culture variants, extending in time from AD 400 to later than AD 1350. While no exact copies of the Grotto "ceremonial" figures are illustrated in publications we have consulted to date, several of the key elements are often shown in Fremont images - sharply tapered waists, large headdresses, two- horn headdresses, strange foot configu- rations, batons or ceremonial items in the hands. They are perhaps most similar to the Western Utah Painted Style of Fremont (Figure 8B), which is "distinguished by the simple painted representation, usually in red, of a Fremont-style triangular-bodied horned anthropomorph" (Schaafsma 1971: 85, 88, Figures 81, 82). The figures illus- trated by Schaafsma include one-horn and two-horn examples, with the splayed lower body or short leg representations similar to those at Grotto Canyon. The closest occurrence of similar anthropo- morphs that we are aware of is at Buf- falo Eddy in the Lower Snake River area of Idaho and Washington (Figure 8C). The site includes two-horned and three- horned anthropomorphs, and some fig- ures wield "clubs" (Keyser 1992: Figures 76, 84; Nesbitt 1968: Figures 2, 27). Another intriguing example with a bear- ing on Grotto Canyon can be seen in Wellmann (1979: Figure 554), where he illustrates a humpbacked figure with a "staff alongside a horned anthropo- morph, in what he calls "Fremont style," at Molen, Utah. The attributes of the horned anthro- pomorphs at Grotto Canyon are sugges- tive of ceremonial regalia, such as that worn by Hopi kachina dancers1. Likewise, these anthropomorphs bear a resem- blance to figures that Waters (1963: 130) states are drawings of members of the One Horn and Two Horn societies; more- over, the anthropomorph closely associ- ated with the top row of animals at Grotto Canyon has a two-horn headdress. Finally, the "ceremonial" figures are similar in composition and in some details to rock art depictions of figures associated with Southwest fluteplayers (Figure 9A, B). In some cases, such as Figure 9B, fluteplay- ers are directly associated with what is considered to be typical Fremont rock art (e.g., Cordell 1997: 214). Another element of the Grotto Canyon site that has southwestern rock art connotations is the zigzag line imme- diately above the fluteplayer (Figure 6). Some fluteplayers in die Southwest are associated with one or more snakes, which are sometimes stylized into a zigzag (Schaafsma 1980: 141; Slifer and Duff- ield 1994: 21). According to Hopi tradi- tions, the cicada melted the snows when requested to do so by the snakes, which may explain the association with insect- like fluteplayers. At other sites, a zigzag stems from the head of fluteplayers Canadian Journal of Archaeology 26 (2002)</page><page sequence="13">A POSSIBLE FLUTEPLAYER PICTOGRAPH SITE • 13 B ^ ^w^ Figure 8: Fremont style anthropomorphs: (A) "Basketmaker" anthropomorphs, redrawn from McCreery and Malotki (1994: 17); (B) Fremont anthropomorphs, Western Utah Painted Style, from Schaafsma (1971: 88, Figure 81); (C) Two-horned anthropomorphs, Type-Variant TW1 A, from Nesbitt (1968: Figures 2, 27).

These zigzags may represent power lines symbolically linking the motifs with the spirit world. The complexities of the archaeolog- ical systematics applying to the Basket- maker and Fremont complexes are well beyond this paper, but clearly we have at Grotto Canyon a situation where several prominent elements of southwestern rock art are displayed in what appears to be an authentic archaeological context. At some future time, when it may be pos- sible to provide some absolute dates for both the Grotto Canyon site and some southwestern sites, additional discussion of stylistic minutiae may be feasible. INTERPRETATIONS It is our contention that the Grotto Canyon anthropomorphs most closely resemble rock art motifs of the American Southwest. Clearly, the Grotto Canyon anthropomorphs are anomalous, with few if any similar examples in the adja- cent rock art tradition regions. But how can we explain the presence of these motifs, so far north of similar Southwest rock art images? Several origins of the pictographs are possible: (a) the whole panel is a recent non-Aboriginal fake; (b) the similarities are simply coinci- dental; (c) the Stoney captured south- western people and the captives left the images; (d) the Stoney used their knowl- edge of southwestern imagery and cap- tured power to render the images; (e) other Aboriginal visitors to the Southwest painted the panel upon their return, using memories of what they saw, or images on objects they carried back, or; (f) it may be a physical substantiation of Hopi stories concerning the northward travels of the Flute Clan. The Grotto Canyon pictographs are clearly not a fake. Several lines of evi- dence support their authenticity as pre- contact Aboriginal rock art: • They have been known to archae- ologists since at least the early 1950s, and therefore predate the current "New Age" Kokopelli fad; • The landscape context is consistent with other rock art sites in the region. • The pigments and techniques used to make the pictographs are consistent with regional rock art traditions; • The panel composition is inter- nally consistent and all of the motifs appear to be associated and contempo- raneous; and • Most importantly, the pictographs are sealed behind a translucent mineral deposit, which can be assumed to have taken many years to accumulate, although the deposition rate has not been studied. It should be noted that the clarity of the pic- tographs apparently has not diminished since they were first documented in the 1950s, suggesting that the rate of mineral deposition is on the order of centuries. We believe that the resemblance of the Grotto Canyon figures to southwest- ern imagery is too detailed to be coin- cidental, and we are confident that one of the anthropomorphs is a fluteplayer. The identification of motifs, subjects, and objects depicted in rock art is inher- ently ambiguous, and there will often be some doubt or argument about what is represented. Certainly, the Grotto Canyon figure is not perfectly identical to any southwestern fluteplayer exam- ples that we have seen in publication to date; likewise, no two southwestern fig- ures identified as fluteplayers are exactly the same. While the Grotto Canyon figure is not phallic and does not have a humped back, neither are all southwest- ern examples humpbacked or phallic. Many, but not all, Southwest fluteplayers have headdresses or other projections extending from the head (insect anten- Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 26 (2002)</page><page sequence="16">16 • MAGNE AND KLASSEN nae? feathers?), like the narrow lines projecting from the top frontal portion of the Grotto Canyon figure's head. Not all southwestern fluteplayers have bent arms or bent legs like the Grotto Canyon figure, but many do. It cannot be proven that the object held in the hands of the Grotto Canyon figure is a flute (just as it would be impossible to prove the objects shown in Southwest images are flutes) , and the object does appear shorter than many published examples. Indeed, a plausible alternative is that it repre- sents a pipe (although a pipe bowl is not shown) , but humans with pipes are equally rare in Northwestern Plains and Columbia Plateau rock art. The main point we wish to make is that no rock art figures that we know of in the Northwest- ern Plains or Columbia Plateau regions of Canada or the United States even come close to looking like the Grotto Canyon "fluteplayer." The Stoney recognize the antiquity of the Grotto Canyon pictographs, and they have a number of stories describing how they were created. During a visit to the site in May 2001 with several Stoney elders, three stories were told to Magne. One story is that the Stoney returned with Hopi captives from a southern foray, and the captives subsequently painted the images. Another story states that the images were drawn by Stoney people, following one of their voyages south to the land of the "Rattlesnake people," who lived in cliffs and were difficult to attack. A third story is that the Stoney captors acquired the power from their southern captives that permitted them to create the images. As Reverend John Wesley, a Stoney elder, pointed out, the paintings "...baf- fle the anthropologists.... These are images that are common in the South- west, they are a way of communicating, a way of staying in touch." Indeed, South- west Puebloan traditions may have been familiar to Plains groups, as a result of travel, raids, and trading journeys. There is evidence that young men on the Plains often travelled great distances in search of adventure, war honors, and medicine powers, at times going as far as Mexico (see Thompson [1962: 269]; McClintock [1968: 435]). Such journeys on foot or horseback would have been arduous, but it is possible that the Old North Trail (McClintock 1968) extended along the east side of the Rocky Mountains from Canada to the Southwest. Perhaps a young man or a shaman's apprentice travelled from the Bow Valley far to the south, where he encountered the traditions of the Pueblo people. Upon returning home, he commemorated his encounter and experiences on the cliffs of Grotto Canyon. Peter Wesley, Stoney elder and his- torian, related during a television doc- umentary that the lower ceremonial figures resemble " . . .sacred clown people or contrary people and they dress up in these costumes, and they approach a Sun Dance from the south" (@discovery.ca 2001). He continued: "And it may tell you a different story, you know, it's a moving, living thing to some of us peo- ple. . .When I was much younger and my Dad used to tell me stories about how the Stoneys from here first journeyed to the Four Corner area and they met these shorter people who lived in holes in the ground and were strong...." Concerning the depiction of ceremo- nial objects, Peter Wesley said: "Often they would capture these items in war and war games and you capture the design and this belonged to you. Some- times when Stoneys lost... their eldest son or a youngster in the war, they would go to other tribes and capture somebody Canadian Journal of Archaeology 26 (2002)</page><page sequence="17">A POSSIBLE FLUTEPLAYER PICTOGRAPH SITE • 17 else, kidnap them to replace this lost son and as proof of this journey they wrote the representation of what they saw down there." The Stoney also have an oral history about the zoomorphs on the panels. Peter Wesley's cousin had told him: "They chased a moose up this canyon, people waited on a ledge, this one around the corner, and they jumped it and killed and fed these other people." This story raises the possibility that the entire panel may not have been painted during a single visit; perhaps some of the three or four main areas on the panel were painted separately, or more than one of them at one time, but by different artists. The Stoney stories are intriguing, and any one of the different explanations they offer is plausible. Yet, an equally plausible argument can be made for a direct Southwest origin for the picto- graphs. Perhaps a Puebloan shaman, war- rior, or group travelling far to the north left a reminder of their culture in a canyon deep in an unfamiliar land. Inter- estingly, this interpretation finds some support in Hopi oral traditions. The Hopi tell how the clans traveled far and wide: When the Flute Clan set out on its migration, its members took the cicada along as their pet. This insect is their clan ancestor. Finally they reached a place way in the northwest that was covered with snow. Since there was snow on the ground all the time, they failed to cope with it. The cicada, their pet, kept playing its flute constantly, but to no avail. It could not overpower the cold northwest wind. Mean- while, the cicada, poor thing, was shivering with cold. Eventually it was frozen to a point that it could only produce some chirping sounds. The Flute Clan members claim that this truly happened. So, having arrived at that place they had to turn back again. (Malotki 2000: 68-69) Emory Sekaqueptewa, a Hopi anthro- pologist at the University of Arizona interviewed on the Discovery Channel television production (@discovery.ca 2001), stated that "the fluteplayer is a representation of some cultural hero but spiritually a true person who brought his people to the Hopi country." Further- more, Sekaqueptewa related that: There are in fact one or two clans within Hopi who do claim that their people, their ancestors, went as far as to where there was a lot of snow and ice.... [T]hey were pioneers going out into various directions and by planting this par- ticular species of corn and some of these people went to where it was too hot for this corn to grow and others went to where it was too cold, the summer growing season was too short. Eventually these people found each other at the place we now call Hopl. These people, typically all clans, marked the places where they had been, even for short periods of time. The maahu or hunch-backed fluteplayer is a totem or an emblem of a par- ticular clan who made their marks in these various places eventually coming to Hopi, so by marking these places they would have to account to some divine power that they in fact followed this path. Frank Waters' (1963) Book of the Hopi provides a description of Hopi travels that closely parallels the passages quoted Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 26 (2002)</page><page sequence="18">18 • MAGNE AND KLASSEN above in a chapter entitled "North to the Back Door"2. Indeed, the illustration leading his discussion of the flute clan travels shows three fluteplayers, which he identifies as Kókopilau (Waters 1963: 45). Waters' account of the Hopi clan migrations explicitly refers to the pro- duction of rock art images, representing the clan wu'yas or totems, as a way of marking the route of the clan journeys: "Everywhere... the clans carved on rocks their signatures, pictographs and petro- glyphs which identified diem, revealed what round of their migration they were on, and related the history of the vil- lage" (Waters 1963: 42). Moreover, Waters' account identifies the hump-backed, flute-playing insect maahu accompanying the clans as the subject of the rock art representations. According to Waters (1963: 41-42), the Hopi clan migrations began when Másaw, Guardian spirit of the Fourth World, explained to each clan that they must make migrations to the four direc- tions, to where the lands meet the sea in each direction. ...the people began their migra- tions, climbing up a high moun- tain. They were accompanied by two insect people resembling the katydid or locust, the máhu [insect which has heat power].... In the hump on his back he carried seeds of plants and flowers and with the music of his flute he created warmth. When the people moved off on their migrations over the continent they carved pictographs of him on rocks all the way from the tip of South America up to Canada, and it was for these two máhus that the Blue Flute and Gray Flute clans and societies were named.... With those going to the north was the Blue Flute Clan, accompanied by one of the two máhus.... They traveled slowly up the length of the continent on the west side of the mountain wall.... Then the land became drier and colder.... They would make homes by digging holes in the ground and roofing them with brush and poles - which people now describe as "pit house." Then the star which was guiding them moved on, and they packed up again to follow it. The remains of these pit houses and the rock writings they made on their way are the "flags" and "footprints" mark- ing their long journey.... North- ward and still northward the star kept leading them until they came to a land of perpetual snow and ice. At night they burrowed into snowbanks and kept warm with the power of heat they were able to evoke. (Waters 1963: 44-47; emphasis added) When the travellers finally reached the Arctic, they could not cross the ice. They used their powers, but were unable to melt the ice. Their creator Sótuknang appeared to Spider Woman and pun- ished them for using their powers and threatening to flood the earth. The clans then returned along the east side of the mountains to the Colorado River, where the Spider Clan split from the rest, and then travelled to the Atlantic Ocean and back. Thus, Hopi traditions offer a possi- ble explanation for the appearance of southwestern pictographic motifs as far north as Canada. This is not to suggest that the Hopi, as a people, migrated to the Bow valley of Alberta, or even that individuals identifiable as Hopi were responsible for the pictographs. Indeed, the pictographs may predate the Hopi as an identifiable cultural entity, particu- Canadian Journal of Archaeology 26 (2002)</page><page sequence="19">A POSSIBLE FLUTEPLAYER PICTOGRAPH SITE • 19 larly if they are of similar age to those of the Southwest. Moreover, the picto- graphs most closely resemble Fremont images, but the Fremont culture is not considered ancestral to the Hopl. We also recognize that there are similar migration stories among other South- west Pueblo groups (J. Damp, pers. comm. 2001). Instead, we contend that it is plau- sible that one or more members of a southwestern group, perhaps ances- tral to the Hopi or another modern Pueblo group, travelled to the north, left a record of their journey at Grotto Canyon, and this event was subsequently mythologized within Pueblo traditions, including the Hopi clan migration story. The correspondence between Waters' narrative and what we see at Grotto Canyon is too striking to be ignored. The pictographs of Grotto Canyon may not be a confirmation of Hopi traditions, but the traditions do open an intriguing avenue for interpretation. CONCLUSIONS At this point, it is worthwhile review- ing what we do and do not know about the Grotto Canyon site. Certainly, we have definite pictographs, in a landscape setting that is typical for rock art sites in the area. Although we don't know how old they are, the pictographs are undoubtedly pre-contact in age as evi- denced by the mineral deposit. One bent-over anthropomorph has a thin object held to its mouth and thin pro- jections sticking out of its head. This anthropomorph has strong resemblance to the fluteplayer motif of Southwest rock art traditions. Three of the anthro- pomorphs are depicted in a row, and are represented with horns or headdresses, objects in their hands, and tapered torsos ending in strange shapes. With- out a doubt, the pictographs are anoma- lous; no other rock art figures similar to the bent-over anthropomorph holding the thin object are known in die adjacent Northwestern Plains and Columbia Pla- teau, and the nearest anthropomorphs similar to the ones with "horns" and tapered torsos occur in southern Idaho. Beyond these facts, we can say little more about the pictographs with any- thing approaching certainty. Under- standing this site would benefit greatly from physical analyses and dating of the pigments - which, if feasible, would require removal of some of the painting, the approval of the Stoney people, and permission of the Alberta government. In the absence of chronological, strati- graphic, and documentary contexts, Vas- tokas (1987: 24) has argued that the interpretation of rock art images must rely primarily on a systematic and rigor- ous investigation of internal evidence - subject matter, techniques, and formal qualities, the latter including "composi- tion, structure, line, colour [and] tex- ture." In this sense, the only option available for exploring the meaning of Grotto Canyon is the comparison of the pictographs to other imagery in the region and elsewhere. From this we can conclude that the strongest formal simi- larity of the pictographs is to Southwest rock art motifs. Likewise, the identity of the object held to the head of the bent- over anthropomorph could be a flute as easily as another object, although we will never know for certain. Unless we make these comparisons of internal evidence, and the subsequent theories it engen- ders, we can simply shrug our shoulders in bewilderment. Often overlooked in stylistic rock art studies, however, is the explanatory power of Aboriginal traditions. These traditions cannot be "proven" in the sci- JouRNAL Canadien d Archéologie 26 (2002)</page><page sequence="20">20 • MAGNE AND KLASSEN entific sense, nor can we assume that they offer an "absolute truth," but they do provide an alternative framework for obtaining insight into the meaning of rock art. In the case of Grotto Canyon, the Stoney people have plausi- ble explanations for the origins of the pictographs. Likewise, the Hopi have tra- ditions about travelling to the north and leaving the mark of a Flute clan on the rocks. We cannot discount the possibility of long-distance travel and the exchange of ideas - pre-contact cultures did not live in isolation behind fixed boundaries. Without reference to these traditions, we can make little progress towards unravel- ing the significance of the pictographs. In our view, then, a compelling hypothesis for the origin of the Grotto Canyon pictographs is that the entire panel is the result of a journey north- ward of a southwestern group, and pos- sibly that group was ancestral to a Hopi clan. We are not suggesting that an entire people migrated to the north; indeed, it could have involved a single individual. This hypothesis also suggests that the panel is equivalent in age to the Basketmaker III to Pueblo III periods (AD 500 to AD 1300). Undoubtedly, this explanation still relies on a number of assumptions: • the creators of some or all of the southwestern fluteplayers and ceremo- nial figures are the ancestors of the modern Pueblo groups, including the Hopi; • the fluteplayer motif represents a clan symbol or wu'ya, and is related to modern Puebloan traditions; • the Grotto Canyon pictographs are the same age as southwestern examples of the same motifs; • the Grotto Canyon fluteplayer has the same iconographie significance as fluteplayers of the Southwest. Despite these assumptions, the remarkable similarities to southwestern rock art are best explained by this inter- pretation - an hypothesis supported by Hopi traditions. In summary, there are several lines of evidence that support this interpretation, including: • the similarities of the fluteplayer motif and the anthropomorphic figures to southwestern rock art motifs; • the compositional associations of the various motifs, including the zigzag ele- ment, suggesting a single painting event; • Hopi traditions of a northward jour- ney to a land of ice and snow; and • Hopi traditions describing the cre- ation of wu'ya or totemic pictographs to mark the passage of the clans. We may never know for certain who painted the fluteplayer and other images at Grotto Canyon, or the exact reasons they were placed there. We also acknowledge that the fluteplayer identi- fication is not unequivocal, and we antic- ipate that this paper will provoke much additional discussion. Clearly, Grotto Canyon is a fascinating place with many stories still to tell. Acknowledgements.

NOTES 1. A pictograph site at Fish Creek, Montana, may be of Hopi Kachina Danc- ers. Stu Conner (pers. comm. 2002) has puzzled over this site for many years, not having seen similar motifs in his career studying Plains rock art. Upon seeing dancers in person at a Hopi ceremony, however, he was immediately struck by the close similarity of their ceremonial garb to that of the anthropomorphs at Fish Creek. 2. We recognize that many archaeolo- gists and anthropologists may take issue with our inclusion of Waters (1963), since his book is a popularization of Hopi traditions that may not be accepted in today's scholarly world. While we acknowledge the debate that may sur- round the authenticity of his work (e.g., Deloria 1993), readers should know that Waters lists 27 informants from whom he and his assistant gathered information (Waters 1963: xxi). The fact that several other sources quoted in this paper inde- pendently relate traditions that are virtu- ally identical in essence, if not in detail, also lends credence to Water's version of the Hopi migration stories.
