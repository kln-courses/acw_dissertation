Porcellio scaber I.atr. were used in this study. Specimens of weight Was 82.0 ± 4.oi mg (range 30 to 170 mg). the former were collected from Gotland, Sweden, in the summers of 1965 and 1966. The locality was Högklint, some 7 km south of Visby, at the top of a steep shore bank, where they were numerous among small stones. Porcellio specimens were collected from Parainen and Kustavi on the south west coast of Finland; they abound in the litter zone of the seashore. 4 The animals were reared successfully in plastic containers — about 15 x 15 x 6 cm in size provided with moist paper j" £ toweling. Only one end of the container was moistened with ^ a few drops of tap water every other day. It was found im- « r portant to avoid free water in the cultures, as it readily E proved fatal, especially to the younger stages. Fresh carrot was the only food provided. о» Evaporation of water in dry air was determined by x weighing the animals on a balance accurate to the nearest JJ O.i mg. Each animal was kept in a small cage at 0 % relative О humidity (R.H.) in still air in a desiccator and weighed at 15- or 30-min intervals for sufficient accuracy. To obtain 0 % R.H., dried silica gel with a moisture indicator was jj employed. Starvation for two days prior to testing ensured ^ that the animals had empty guts; hence practically all of the ^ decrease in body weight can be attributed to water loss. On О desiccation, the animals were considered dead when they ш no longer responded to agitation of the legs or antennae. &lt; The surface area was calculated according to the formula u A = kW2/3, where A is area in mm2, W is weight in mg and the constant к is 12.4 for P. scaber and 11.5 for A. vulgare (Edney 1951 a). However, one should be cautious about these constants, for at least in P. scaber there is a slight variation in body form. Activity at 0 % R.H. was recorded in round plastic chambers measuring 8.5 cm in diameter. There was dried Fig. 1.

This is further discussed on p. 290. 4. Discussion Both Gunn (1937) and Waloff (1941) noted that terrestrial isopods are active at low humid ities and nearly motionless in saturated air. The latter author concluded that the mechanisms whereby the animals collect in moist air consist of hygrokinesis, or a decrease in activity and speed in the moist, and of more frequent turn ing in areas of high humidity. Fraenkel &amp; Gunn (1940) called these mechanisms ortho kinesis (variation in speed and activity along a stimulus gradient) and klinokinesis (the fre- 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 quency of random turning depending on the time, min stimulus intensity), respectively.

Lindqvist if its speed is high; thus high speed would con tribute to a low reaction intensity. Second, it can be inferred, from the behavior in the various gradients above, that the receptor mechanism is related to differential evaporation rates (cf. Winston 1963); hence a high level of transpira tion would denote high sensitivity to external humidity, and vice versa. For instance, Bursell &amp; Ewer (1950) report that there is a decrease in the intensity of the wet reaction in the onycho phoran Peripatopsis during desiccation, which is partly related to a fall in the rate of water loss from the body. The effect of activity and evaporation on the humidity reaction may be different at different phases of desiccation. The change in the reaction from dry to wet after desiccation for 30 - 60 min is connected with high activity, though evapora tion is still relatively high; the trough in the evaporation rate at that time is masked by pas sive loss of water from the cuticle. The weak wet reaction at about 11-16 % (or about 120 min in Fig. 9) is probably brought about by the combined effect of low evaporation and the peak in the activity rhythm, though the influence of the increased activity level (Fig. 4) cannot be ruled out. After still further desicca tion, the greatly lowered level of activity may have contributed to the intense wet reaction. An important hint of the role of activity is seen in the experimental setup used by Gunn (1937); after each inspection of the alternative chamber the animals were stirred mechanically so that none of them remained motionless. This increased activity resulted in there being no humidity reaction at all if the gradient did not include a region of less than 65 % R.H., while in my study the same species (P. scaber) was able to discern even a 3 % difference in R.H. in the gradient 96-93 %. Lacher (1964) reported that the antennae of the honey bee bear pit pegs, some of which responded electrically to an increase in humidity, while others were shown to be cold receptors. Loftus (1966) identified cold receptors on the antennae of Periplaneta; a drop in temperature of 1° С elicited a maximum response in the sensilla that was five times the stationary discharge rate. Adaptation occurred within a few seconds. It is known that P. scaber at least possesses a variety of nerve terminations in its cuticle (Jans &amp; Ross 1963), and it is not impos sible that it could also make use of evaporative cooling in perceiving humidity. A high rate of evaporation and low activity were found to accompany high sensitivity in detecting humid ity differences. Considering the much higher rate of water loss in isopods than in insects, there should be no need, a priori, for the exis tence of specific humidity receptors, but the entire surface of the animal could be responsive to a temperature drop. The studies of Edney (1951 b, 1953) and Warburg (1965) have shown that the body temperature of terrestrial isopods may be several degrees lower than that of the ground or of the air. The degree of lowering is related to the differences in evaporation rates.1 Odor cues play a part in bunching in terrestrial isopods (Kuenen &amp; Nooteboom 1963; Fried lander 1964, 1965). This phenomenon probably heightens the intensity of the reaction in places. There is an evident disparity between the rate of water loss and its relation to the humidity reactions; the reactions follow the evaporation rhythm in spite of the fact that the reaction in tensities were means determined for a period of two hours. However, if the animals' activity is high at the beginning of a test in the alterna tive chamber, they first disperse around the chamber (low reaction intensity), and then gradually come to rest. If, on the other hand, the animals' activity is low at the beginning, they collect either on the dry or on the wet side, according to their need, and remain there (hence an intense reaction results). The onset of the resting state is facilitated by a relatively high humidity and also by bunching (Fried lander 1964). Thus the long period in the gradient enhances the measurement of the animals' initial state. With only the first half hour taken into account' the effect of chance variation on the outcome would be much greater. With a large water deficit the animals must stay longer in a humid environment to make it up. The data of den Boer (1961) reveal that the rate of water uptake in nearly saturated air is about 0.4 % of body weight per hour for a medium-sized Porcellio. This figure is about one tenth of the evaporation rate at 0 % R.H. Measurements of activity and transpiration at high humidities would possibly reveal to what extent these rhythms are endogenous and not 1 A quite recent paper of R. W. Winston &amp; С. C. Green (Naturwissenschaften 54, 499; 1967) shows that the anten nae of Leucophaea may contain two types of humidity re ceptors, which give an increased electric response to a shift from dry to wet air and from wet to dry air respectively.</page><page sequence="13">Ann.

In the antenna less isopods the reduction appeared to be de layed; their minimum occurred at 210 min, while in the flagellaless it was at 90 min.

However, it is not excluded that the in tensity is determined solely by the evaporation rate, as the exact mechanism of humidity per ception is still unknown. 4. Discussion A.

Summary It is shown that environmental humidity may induce changes in the level of evaporation in terrestrial isopods. These animals exhibit a short evaporation rhythm, which is inversely correla ted to activity; with high evaporation the sensi tivity to differences in external humidity is also increased. The amputation method often used in locating specific receptors in arthropods is criticized on the ground that a stress may be involved which causes disturbances at both the peripheral and the central level. The possible release of neurosecretory material from the sinus gland is correlated with heightened water movement through the integument. It is pro posed that an analysis of the various factors which affect the general activity level (through excitation and inhibition) should at least serve as a starting point for the physiological study of the behavior of arthorpods in a stimulus gradient.
