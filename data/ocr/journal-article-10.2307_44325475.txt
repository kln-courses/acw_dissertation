<plain_text><page sequence="1">LANDSCAPES OF THE INTERIOR: LIBERIAN- AMERICAN DIASPORA IN FOUNDATIONAL AND TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY WRITINGS OF EXPLORATION AND NATION By Richard Douglass-Chin Some of Liberia's earliest writing includes several nine- teenth-century African American narratives of exploration published as the fledgling quasi-American nation - America's little-acknowledged stepchild - sought to extend its provenance from the West African coast into the inte- rior. An examination of two such narratives - James Sims' "Scenes in the Interior of Liberia" (1858) and Benjamin Anderson's "Narrative of a Journey to Musardu"1 (1868), alongside two present-day Liberian poems, K-Moses Nagbe's "The Day Our Captain Died" (2005) and Patricia Jabbeh Wesley's "Around the Mountains" (2003) - raises complex questions concerning the evolution of Liberian literature and representations in that literature of Libe- rian nationhood and diaspora: what has been the trajec- tory of development of Liberian literature? From what sources do nineteenth- and twenty-first century Liberian writers derive their narrative authority as explorers and migratory wanderers in the Liberian diaspora? By "Libe- rian diaspora" I mean not only the representations of Li- beria created by African American explorers-turned- Liberian citizens2 in the mid-nineteenth-century, but also present-day America, to which West-African-born Liberi- ans such as Patricia Jabbeh Wesley have migrated. Are the diasporic texts' overarching presuppositions about na- tionhood, the new lands, and the inhabitants of those lands reinforced or unsettled by the writers' actual experi- ence of the landscapes and the quotidian lives of the peo- ple they encounter there? 238</page><page sequence="2">Landscapes of the Interior 239 S. Kpanbayeazee Duworko notes that in the twentieth- century, Liberia "lagged behind" other African countries such as Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya and Zimbabwe in "literary education, canon formation and literacy" ("Literary Educa- tion"). Both Duworko and prominent Liberian writer and critic Wilton Sankawulo argue that this lag has been the result of the early establishment in Liberia of a status quo that privileged the small, diasporic Americo-Liberian rul- ing elite3 at the expense of the indigenous majority. Sankawulo notes that 'Very little attention has been given to the creation of a respectable body of national [Liberian] literature" (qtd. in Naxela, "Against Annihilation"). Fur- thermore, as Naxela observes, the focus of that scant at- tention has been dictated consistently by the governing elite of the moment: "Liberian writers did not tackle the problems of the country for fear of offending the authori- ties." While Liberia's Tolbert administration (1971-80) contributed most to literacy, literary education, and free- dom of the press, the 1980 coup d'Ã©tat under Samuel Doe - the first indigenous Liberian to come to power since Liberia's establishment as a republic in 1847 - precip- itated the country into long periods of civil war, conditions which are nonconducive, to say the least, to literary devel- opment. Those conditions of instability have only recently begun to be alleviated with the 2005 election of Harvard- educated economist President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf to the Liberian presidency. The effect of this newly won and delicate political stability upon Liberian literary produc- tion is yet to be gauged, but critical and creative writing by and/or about Liberians has nevertheless continued, supported by diasporic initiatives such as the African Studies Association, African Studies centers and depart- ments on many campuses across the Americas, or Sea Breeze - a peer-reviewed electronic publication established in 2004, maintaining a Post Office box in Louisville, Ken- tucky, but describing itself as "publishing art, creative</page><page sequence="3">240 Richard Douglass-Chin non-fiction, short fiction narratives, poetry, interviews, book reviews, criticism, theory, and social and political commentary by Liberians arising out of Liberian life wher- ever we are [emphasis mine]" ("About Us," Sea Breeze). Sea Breeze has afforded a viable Internet forum for dias- poric Liberian writers such as Patricia Jabbeh Wesley4 and K-Moses Nagbe.5 However, in spite of such initiatives, and in spite of noted postcolonial critic Gareth Griffith's observation that Nagbe "has emerged as a writer with an original voice" in Liberia ( African Literatures), Ray Martin Toe recently noted that Nagbe's literary works have yet to receive scholarly criticism ("A Contemporary African Writer"). Similarly, the writings of authors such as Wesley or Wilton Sankawulo still await critical engage- ment on the part of diasporic literary scholars.6 I want to contribute to such an engagement by examining Nagbe's "The Day Our Captain Died" and Wesley's "Around the Mountains" for the ways in which these contemporary Li- berian writers refigure important aspects of the nine- teenth-century Liberian American exploration narrative. The nineteenth-century chronicles arise out of the tradi- tions of European and Euro-American7 narratives of dis- covery such as that of British explorer David Livingstone or the Americans Lewis and Clark in their exploration of the American west. Three salient characteristics8 of these Euro/American discovery narratives may be identified: 1. The narrator, through his very use of the genre of the explo- ration chronicle, asserts his connection to an authority higher than himself: he produces an enduring record of his exploration for the greater glory of the Euro/American state, missionary society, commercial or scientific enterprise. 2. The narrator records his daily interactions with local peo- ples. Here, he may begin to record his progress not in terms of overarching Euro/American authority, but of the logic and experience of the indigenous denizens of the land- scape. As such, this "local mode" of narration may starkly and unintentionally contradict the first mode of institu-</page><page sequence="4">Landscapes of the Interior 241 tional authority. This contradiction may remain unresolved in the narrative. 3. The narrator records his internal perception of the land- scape, bestowing upon it his own aesthetic responses. Those responses may be located in either a larger, appropri- ative, Euro/American Romantic aesthetic tradition,9 or a tradition of the dystopia in which the African landscape be- comes a nightmarish reflection of the dangerous and savage "other" who inhabits it.10 While James Sims financed his own journey from Amer- ica to Liberia as a trading endeavor (Fairhead 49), Benja- min Anderson, sponsored by the Liberian government, was directed to make a scientific exploration; but as we read Anderson's narrative, the other, more important pur- pose seems to have been to establish the authority of the new Liberian nation in the hinterlands. Both Sims and Anderson, therefore, appeal to some authority greater than themselves. That authority is a new Liberian nation, overwhelmingly influenced by Euro/American notions of "civilization," capitalism, science, religion, and bureau- cratic organization. Sims writes that indigenous Africans saw him as a "white man" (95); he parallels his mission to the "labors of those intrepid [white] men who first made known to the civilized world, the habits and customs of the people of this benighted continent" (97). As representative of the new Liberian government, Benjamin Anderson repeatedly employs military metaphors to describe his experience. Presenting military buttons as gifts to a group of young indigenous women, Anderson boasts that he has "done the state some service," having "labeled nearly all the pretty women in the Boozie country as the property of the Repub- lic of Liberia, with its military brass buttons" (188). Anderson appraises the indigenous people he meets in terms of their military potential in service of the new re- public: "In general physical appearance the Boozies are well built . . . with stoutly developed bodies, of sufficient</page><page sequence="5">242 Richard Douglass-Chin muscular strength to hold a United States musket, bayo- net fixed, at full arm's length in one hand" (191). In his journey to the territories of the Mandingo people, he will "march" north with "the tramp and speed of a soldier," in order to "quickly descend" into that country, and ulti- mately "take up our abode in their very capital - Musardu" (160-61). If Sims and Anderson relied upon Euro/American narra- tive authority, what was their response, on a local and personal level, to the indigenous Africans they encoun- tered daily? And in what manner did the explorers regard the African landscape? In spite of his initial descriptions of Africa as a "benighted continent," Sims frequently at- tests to the industriousness and advancement of the vari- ously identified African peoples he daily encounters. The Goulah people are "surrounded by plenty of all the neces- saries of life"; their "farms [are] well cultivated, and their towns literally stocked with fowls, goats and sheep" (95). Similarly, in the Barlain town of Jangay, "the beauty and the industry of the interior natives are to be seen every Saturday, the Jangay market day (109). Sims ends his narrative with the assertion that "[t]he morals of the inte- rior natives are far superior to those of the natives living near the beach, who have had intercourse with foreigners" (123). Sims' narrative abounds with Romantic visions of the African landscape rendered in terms of aesthetic interpre- tation: "On leaving the farms, we entered a beautiful coun- try - a country of hills and valleys, shady groves and me- andering streams. Here too a bird, With purple beak, and rainbow colors flung At random o'er his plumes, among the rest, Was one pre-eminent; his supple tongue A gift like human eloquence possessed, And with such art and copious numbers sung, That all who heard, a prodigy confessed." (100)</page><page sequence="6">Landscapes of the Interior 243 In another instance the "soul inspiring beauty" of the mountains, "clothed in a livery of the richest green," and dotted with "hundreds of tall, circular, thatched roofs glis- tening in the setting sun, presented a sight well worthy of an artist's pencil" (118). However, Sims' contemporary, Anderson, presents de- scriptions of a sullied countryside degraded by internecine war and indigenous over-cultivation: "Only here and there could be seen patches of large forest-trees. So completely had this section of the country [Zolu] been farmed over and over that only saplings of three or four years' growth covered the uncultivated parts. Nor will they be allowed to attain a greater age or size before the requirements of agriculture will clear them for rice and cotton-fields" (191). Anderson consistently regards Africans with contempt: his carriers disobey his orders and he ascribes the difficul- ties he encounters on his journey to Musardu to the fact that "I had not been able to get a single civilized person to accompany me . . ." (167). Observations of the villages of the interior, even when benign, are often qualified by Anderson's sense of his own separateness from and supe- riority to the indigenous people: "They would economize both time and labor if they would employ our large loom, instead of the narrow six-inch loom they use. I have no doubt they would do so, if any civilized person would in- terest himself to show them. These people are very sensi- ble of the superiority of every thing that comes from Mon- rovia, and they attempt to practice our civilization of themselves" (181). The music of the Mandingo he finds "intrinsically disagreeable," and the "careless, lounging habit of wasting time . . . an incurable one" (201); even the morning prayers of one of his Baptist Congo carriers is a source of "annoyance." "In matters of cleanliness and health," he observes, the indigenous people are also negli- gent (166). We may note that Anderson's rhetoric reflects a common latter-nineteenth-century Euro/American discourse that</page><page sequence="7">244 Richard Douglass-Chin constructed Africans and African Americans as inept, un- cultured, uncivilized, and untrustworthy.11 That Africa still persists in the minds of many Westerners today as a continent in danger of becoming a collection of "failed states," intent upon preserving its "uncivilized" barba- risms in the form of general ineptitude and brutal inter- necine war.12 A more sophisticated theorization of dias- poric Liberian-American connections necessitates ein ex- amination of not only Western and early Americo-Liberian writings, but also the works of present-day Liberians grappling with long-standing issues of narration and na- tion. If the nineteenth-century chronicles of Sims and Ander- son derive their narrative authority from the tradition of Euro/American exploration writing and that genre's ac- companying notions of Euro/American "civilization," K- Moses Nagbe's "The Day Our Captain Died" draws upon another genre of conquest - the epic - in which he as in- digenous national bard rehearses the exploits of the great warrior who helped to establish their Kru nation.13 While Africa possesses her own strong traditions of epic poetry,14 Nagbe's opening stanza pointedly recalls not these African traditions, but Western antecedents. Nagbe echoes Virgil's Aeneid: "I sing of arms and the man" (Nagbe, stanza I) - and figures the Kru epic hero in terms of West- ern warriors: "Our Achilles, our Samson,15 our Roland / We sing and dance" (Nagbe, Part I). But Nagbe problema- tizes the epic con/questing hero in the context of a Libe- rian nation still recovering from the havoc that decades of civil war have made quotidian. Thus, his poem becomes not a song of epic conquest, but a complex investigation of the double-edged nature of the epic as both poem of na- tional pride and problematic celebration of the devasta- tions of war. While the poem recounts the epic exploits of legendary Kru warrior JlÃ¨ Wlu WannÃª TÃ² in the Kru wars against the GbetaÃ´ people, "The Day Our Captain Died" is dedi-</page><page sequence="8">Landscapes of the Interior 245 cated to Liberian soccer legend Francis JargbÃ© Lawson, and ends with a gunshot and the "grave, immutable si- lence" that the implied death of the epic war hero engen- ders. The bardic speaker cautions us that the warrior hero of past epics will be silenced by the very instruments he has used to kill others. Such a warrior is no longer "palatable" to us: . . . the quaint bill always be the quaint; Would you dare visit his very own farm? Train your stomach to his delicacies - Grasshoppers and crickets and worms And centipedes and millipedes. (Part VIII) Nagbe suggests, then, that present-day conquest be fig- ured not in terms of warfare, but sport; the male warrior of a modern-day Liberia does battle not with weapons, but on the soccer field. As historian Charles Wordsworth writes: "[s]occer in Liberia has had and continues to have a profound effect on the unity and cohesion of its citi- zens. . . . Lord McCaulay tells us that 'a people which take no pride in the noble achievements of remote ancestors, will never achieve anything worthy to be remembered with pride by remote descendants'" ("Legends of the Lone Star"). Although Nagbe very consciously derives his nar- rative authority from European and African epic tradi- tions of war and conquest, the bardic speaker of his poem demonstrates a heightened awareness of himself as vi- sionary co-creator of a new twenty-first-century collective Liberia. This new Liberia is cognizant of the "noble achievements of remote ancestors," but also cognizant of the pitfalls of old historical patterns of the glorification of men of political conquest and war. Narrative authority in Patricia Jabbeh Wesley's "Around the Mountains" comes not from genres of nation- alistic conquest such as the exploration chronicle or the epic poem, but rather the lyric - a contemplative and per- sonal form. As a representation of the interior emotions of the speaker, Wesley's lyrical couplets explore a relation-</page><page sequence="9">246 Richard Douglass-Chin ship between women - an American and a Liberian - the latter of whom finds herself unwillingly inhabiting the American landscape as a refugee from Liberia's civil war. Here we find no celebration of nation or national pride, but rather direct observations upon the real, murderous repercussions of nationalism and civil warfare: the speaker ironically remembers the manner in which her family's patriotic act of "singing to America / on the Fourth of July" is disrupted when "a missile landed on our back porch" followed by "another missile bursting through con- crete walls" (25-27). Nationalism and its damaging effects are deeply felt in Wesley's juxtaposition of quotidian experiences in Liberia with those in America, the country of refuge: in Liberia missiles land on back porches where friends stand, in rooms where friends sleep. The speaker wistfully recalls her husband's physical warmth "before the war, before the children / came, before my strands of hair began to give way to / lost years, before the rebels came, before the sol- diers, / before our years were ambushed into memory" (46-49). However, in America, the speaker's quotidian life is constituted in acts of poetry-reading among friends: "I'm going to St. Bonaventure to read poetry, where / Matt is Sandy's three-year-old, and Paul, her husband. / Paul, such a strong name for a husband, Sandy" (33-35). Cele- brated in Wesley's poem are art, friendship, and maternal and conjugal love - quotidian occupations and relation- ships that bind the fabric of civil society rather than vio- lently unravel it. If Wesley dichotomizes peaceful quotidian activities against the brutal activities of war, Nagbe complicates such a dichotomization. In Nagbe's epic poem the alien people encountered by the wandering Kru become neighbors before they become enemies. The lives of both groups are knit by the quotidian years - "the yarn of time" that "looped them in with neighbors / With whom so long they'd battle / For land, for farms, for cattle. Conquest</page><page sequence="10">Landscapes of the Interior 247 beats in the human heart; / Survival taunts us all with its juicy taste" (Part I). Thus, for Nagbe, if to be human is to engage in the simple activities of the quotidian, it is also to engage in acts of conquest and war. Peace is always a "frothing peace" in which the people go "about farming and feasting," but "[b]eware of still waters, beware!" (Part XI). The epic hero is always his mother's "little boy" (Part V); and the poem is haunted by the repeated refrain, "the years crawled by" - years in which the Kru and their neighbors, even in the midst of doubt, contention and an- ticipated warfare, continue the activities of daily exis- tence: "women fetched water and sang; / Men mingled and tilled the earth. / Goats, sheep and cattle grazed" (Part III). In fact, it is these very quotidian activities that result in warfare - a "prized cow," ritually presented as a sacred gift to the hero's mother, is stolen and slaughtered by the neighboring GbetaÃ´ people: "Who did this thing? / It was the GbetaÃ´ again!" (Part IV). That it was the GbetaÃ´ "again" suggests the manner in which internecine friction is perhaps born out of the eternal challenges of mutual quotidian existence. For Nagbe such challenges are located in the ceaseless wanderings of peoples in and across the African landscape. If the nineteenth-century explorer James Sims constructs the new Liberian landscape in appropriative terms of the American Romantic, Nagbe's Kru also appropriate the lands they enter, investing those lands with a narrative of the legendary, sacred history of the Kru people. The Kru God awaits his people in the new land's many natural formations, but most powerfully in the presence of a gi- gantic mass of rocks at the mouth of the Dr0ye river: "Here the Jlao met their Force of all forces - / Their Suc- cor of all succors / Their Storm of all storms / The one who spoke and it was done / The one who spoke and pythons coiled as cushion seats. . . . The Pahn Jlao made for the coast, / Zigzagging to Ngmasno Klegbe, / A towering rock mass, / None but the Maker of all / Could have planted -</page><page sequence="11">248 Richard Douglass-Chin the hearth of Ngmasno, his wife" (Part I). To invest the new landscape with the story of the tribe's special rela- tionship to its gods is an act perhaps as old as the epic form itself. Such an investment, in Nagbe's poem, is inti- mately linked to conquest, and, ultimately, to war. It is through sacred ritual that the priests ask God to send them their hero, their chosen "One": "The Jlao trooped, drumming, dancing, singing / Singing his name - the Thunder of all thunders. / Without a wind, all was settled, all done. / The kpÃ twÃª, the Great River's priests, passed it all: / A son they'd soon have to captain their cause" (Part I). And it is the Gbetao flouting of the Kru sacred - their theft of the "prized" cow presented by the Kru to their hero's mother - that precipitates the violence: "flying bul- lets and spears," heads rolling, "others bursting open, / Brains flying like thickened sap" (Part VI). For Nagbe, men become the broken trees of the war-ravaged land; war is intimately connected to the landscape, to the people in- habiting that landscape, for war is one of the earth's natu- ral processes. The hero himself is killed by his own "seeds," sired upon a mysterious "alien" woman who leaves the Kru to return, pregnant, to her own people. This tragic outcome, perhaps as inevitable as the cycles of the diurnal, is constructed in terms of the movement of the sun, and of seasonal planting and agriculture: "Fast when the nuptial night had faded, / In set a seed, the sinister seed" (Part X). In the fatal attack upon the hero by his own "alien" offspring: "The sun was shedding beguiling rays - / Those which dumb lads from fields afar saw / And thought a new sun was rising. / But it was an old sun, the one never to rise / Upon all faces alike. / A shot! - Out leaped a pall of smoke / Ferrying seven dark seeds . . ." (Part XI). Francis JargbÃ© Lawson, Liberian soccer legend and "storehouse of cultural tales," to whose "evergreen memory" Nagbe's epic is dedicated, stands as a new hope for Liberia; the twenty-first-century Liberian hero, rooted to the landscape through his stories, must conduct his con-</page><page sequence="12">Landscapes of the Interior 249 tests of prowess upon the field of sportsmanship, and not of internecine warfare, if Liberia is to survive as a nation. Patricia Jabbeh Wesley's poem speaks more of Libe- rian/American diaspora than Liberian nationhood; "Around the Mountains" addresses the flight of Liberians from civil war to the shores of America as the circular journey, begun by Americo-Liberians such as Sims and Anderson, is completed. Wesley is painfully aware of that circularity as she constructs America as the "new" land, and her Liberian speaker as twenty-first-century explorer of the alien terrain. The speaker's representation of the Allegheny Mountains of New York State does not suggest the enthusiastic Romantic appropriation of James Sims - but neither does it suggest the dystopian rejections of a new landscape that we find in Benjamin Anderson. Rather, Wesley's speaker is much less certain of what her relationship to the landscape is - and much more self- conscious about her lack of certainty. This Liberian trav- eler finds herself "chasing the Alleghenies, bargaining with these / hills and cops along roadside exits" (23-23). The mountains themselves are "a maze . . . humping, chas- ing one another up / and down" (4-5). One bargains with this anthropomorphic landscape as one bargains with a difficult offspring; in fact, the elusive, mischievous moun- tains "lose us" and "our eyes lose the hills," until the speaker finds herself eventually "giving up so the skies can take possession, / like a teacher of my child" (7-9). This trope of the land as child acknowledges that both landscape and offspring as we perceive them are always already our mental creations. But these new mountains refuse to submit to the speaker's American companion's desire to create them as romantic vista: "Sandy says when the trees / come out, this place is a paradise, but this year / the snow was forever falling." This recalcitrance on the part of the Alleghenies results in the speaker's determina- tion to enter into dialogue with them, using Sandy as cul- tural intermediary: "When the trees / come out, tell the</page><page sequence="13">250 Richard Douglass-Chin trees, Sandy, to make the flowers / white and purple; to mourn the life, lost, the laughter / in Monrovia's streets, of people in the market places / and on the long beaches / to mourn my neighbors . . (15-19). In "Around the Moun- tains," the speaker's anguish at the loss of her Liberia, her American friend's desire to control the American land- scape as "paradise," and even the speaker's desire to "tell" the American mountains to produce flowers of mourning for Liberia, all contend with the speaker's ultimate, self- conscious knowledge that we create the landscape, even as it forever dances beyond the scope of our control: "We know that spring is just / for a season" (41-2), and that with nature's indifference - the mountains of the new country, the passing of seasons and the violence of war - we will forever bargain in our negotiations "around" that natural indifference. As writers of the twenty-first century, Nagbe and Wesley accomplish what nineteenth-century explorers Sims and Anderson do not - a self-conscious examination of the ways in which the landscapes of the Liberian dias- pora are constructed in the Liberian literary imagination. If James Sims's nineteenth-century exploration chronicle presented a hopeful and romantic vision of an Americo- Liberian landscape populated by both industrious and civi- lized aboriginals and the newly arrived African Ameri- cans, Benjamin Anderson constructed a dystopian Liberia whose people and landscape lay outside the pale of Euro/American "civilizing" influences. However, the works of contemporary Liberian poets Wesley and Nagbe challenge us to examine the ways in which Liberia has been constructed in both the Liberian and the American imaginations. The interior we explore is our own. We create the alien landscapes we encounter. If European ideas of imperial exploration and epic conquest inform the texts of explorers Sims and Anderson, Wesley and Nagbe question such narrative authority. Nagbe uses the epic form to create a nationalistic poem of Liberia, even as he</page><page sequence="14">Landscapes of the Interior 251 complicates and problematizes the phenomena of national pride, exploration, conquest, and warfare that underlie such a form. On the other hand, Patricia Jabbeh Wesley uses the intensely personal lyric to altogether challenge the impetuses that inform the exploration narrative or the epic poem. Wesley, a Liberian in America, unsettles the entire explorer-land relationship. In her poem, the land to be discovered is not Liberia, but America; and the black female explorer defines her mission not in terms of mili- tary conquest, but of the healing of the civil and civilized Liberian bonds of family and friendship - bonds destroyed by militarism. In the Western imagination, it is largely Benjamin Anderson's dystopian construction of Liberia that prevails today. However, if America is to sustain a serious and reciprocal dialogue with her little-acknowledged offspring, such dialogue must begin with the rigorous exploration of Liberian imaginings of Liberia and Liberian diaspora, alongside American ones. In my brief examination of the narratives of Americo-Liberi an explorers James Sims and Benjamin Anderson, and of the poems of contemporary Liberian writers Patricia Jabbeh Wesley and K. Moses Nagbe, that is the task I begin here. Notes 1 Benjamin Anderson's 1868 Narrative of a Journey to Musardu, the Capital of the Western Mandingoes is perhaps the best-known of the African American exploration chronicles; published by the Smithsonian Institution in 1870, it was ensconced by the National Geographic Society of London alongside the works of other "great explorers" of Africa such as David Livingstone. Other less arrogant and paternalistic narratives than Anderson's include the exploration chronicles of James Sims and George Seymour, which appeared only in Liberia's ephemera, The Liberia Herald , and the Star of Liberia, as well as in various state coloniza- tion journals. 2 Both Benjamin Anderson and James Sims, originally African Americans, became Liberian citizens. As such, they may be termed Americo-Liberians, that class of Liberians who were either born in America or descended from African American parents who had relocated to Liberia. Other citizens of Liberia in- cluded freed-persons born in the Caribbean, African "recaptives" - persons who</page><page sequence="15">252 Richard Douglass-Chin had been rescued from slaving ships by British or American sea patrols and deposited in Liberia, and indigenous people who had been absorbed into the new nation through mission school and other "civilizing" endeavors. For a history of Liberia, see Charles Morrow Wilson's Liberia: Black Africa in Microcosm. 3 That elite - initially African American freedmen who arrived in the new African settlement in 1821 - established hegemony early and continued to rule when Liberia formed its first government as a republic in 1847. The Americo- Liberian leadership for the most part patterned itself on Euro-American, Chris- tian value systems and methods of government. The government largely dis- missed the cultural and political importance of the indigenous people until 1980, when a rebel indigenous group, led by Samuel Doe, took power. Doe, a Krahn by ethnicity, became Liberia's first non-Americo-Liberian president in 1985. This marked the beginning of a long period of civil war in Liberia, during which thou- sands of Liberians fled the country. Civil war ended in 2003, and after two years of rule by a transitional government, Liberia held democratic elections in late 2005. The result of those elections was the establishment of Harvard-educated President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf as the country's new leader. 4 Wesley left Liberia in 1991 and now holds a faculty position at Pennsylvania State University. 5 Liberian-born Nagbe has taught at Prince George Community College and Montgomery College in Maryland, U.S.A., as well as at several West African postsecondary institutions, including the University of Liberia and the College of West Africa. He has in recent years been involved in the establishment of the Union of Liberian Associations in the Americas and the New Kru Town Associa- tion in the Americas. (See "New Kru Town Association Selects Powerful Orator" and Nagbe, "May a Nation Washed in Blood and Tears"). 6 The MLA Bibliography, the foremost reference tool for researchers of Eng- lish literature, cites no critical references on the work of Sankawulo, Nagbe, or Wesley. 7 For the sake of brevity, I will hereafter refer to "European and Euro- American" as Euro/American. 8 In my examination of characteristics of the exploration narrative, I have adapted my criteria from Bruce Greenfield's study on the Euro-American explo- ration chronicle - Narrating Discovery: The Explorer in American Literature, 1799-1855 - as well as Roy Bridges' "Exploration and Travel outside Europe (1720-1914)." For a further examination of representations of Liberia in nine- teenth-century African American exploration narratives, see R. Douglass-Chin, "Liberia as American Diaspora: The Transnational Scope of American Identity in the Mid-Nineteenth Century," Canadian Review of American Studies , forth- coming. 9 As part of a more general movement of Euro-expansion, this tendency to simultaneously colonize and romanticize landscapes and the indigenous peoples living there is termed "anti-conquest" writing by Mary Louise Pratt in her semi- nal study Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation (1992). Pratt refers to the development of European naturalist writings as "strategies of rep- resentation whereby European bourgeois subjects seek to secure their innocence in the same moment as they assert European hegemony. . . . The main protago-</page><page sequence="16">Landscapes of the Interior 253 nist of the anti-conquest is . . . the 'seeing-man,' ... he whose imperial eyes passively look out and possess" (7). I use the term "Euro/American Romanticism" to classify a category of litera- ture that valorized nature over urban environments that privileged the idea that one gained spiritual edification by searching out dramatic and aesthetically pleasing "views" of nature, that nature was to be viewed best by one who had ventured alone into its provenance, and who took time to contemplate the breath-taking scenes he witnessed there. I refrain from using the term "Tran- scendentalism," which would describe the American movement flourishing dur- ing Sims' and Andersons' time, because Transcendentalism incorporated other characteristics (for example, marked valorization of Eastern philosophies, desire for "self-improvement," bold experimentation with language, presentation of a distinctly American landscape) that we do not find so pronounced in European manifestations . 10 See Roy Bridges, "Exploration and Travel outside Europe (1720-1914)." Novels such as Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness also demonstrate this sensi- bility. See Chinua Achebe's "An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's Heart of Darkness ." 11 See "Brother Jonathan's Colonies," Harper's New Monthly Magazine 98.584 (Jan. 1899): 324; "The Capture of a Slaver "Atlantic Monthly 86.516 (Oct. 1900); "A Club Man in Africa," Harper's New Monthly Magazine 29.171 (Aug. 1864); "Uncle Tom at Home," Putnam's Monthly 3.43 (July 1856). Roy Bridges observes that the European scramble for Africa had destroyed the romance of the conti- nent (66). While a text such as Lord Stanley's Deepest Darkest Africa (1890) epitomizes European disdain and contempt for Africans at its most arrogant, other texts such as Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness (1902), while suggesting that the dream of European exploitation of Africa had become a nightmare, nevertheless continue to portray Africans as primordial savages. 12 See, for example, Michael Ignatieff, The Warrior's Honour: Ethnic War and Modern Consciousness ; Sebastian Mallaby, "The Reluctant Imperialist: Terror- ism, Failed States, and the Case for American Empire," or Niall Ferguson, Co- lossus : The Price of America's Empire. 13 About 95 % of Liberia's population consists of indigenous peoples. The Kru are only one of about sixteen tribes indigenous to the area. Americo-Liberians comprise about 2.5% of the population, and another 2.5% are descendants of nineteenth-century freed-persons who came to Liberia from the Caribbean. 14 See, for example, Stephen Belcher, Epic Traditions of Africa, or John Wil- liam Johnson, Son-Jara: The Mande Epic. 15 While the problematic relationship of Jews to Europe in realpolitik consti- tutes an entire field of study in itself, I refer to the Hebrew Samson as a Euro- pean epic hero because European Christians have appropriated the Hebrew Bible as their own "Old Testament."
