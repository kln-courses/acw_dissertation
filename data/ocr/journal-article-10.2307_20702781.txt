Yale University Press. Pages 8, 96, and map : Dollars 1.50. Dr. Buck has written with great and illuminating detail on the material culture of various Polynesian peoples, and in the course of his writing has often introduced with great effect the uttered meditations of the workmen who have been surprised by his sympa thetic fraternization into unwonted speech, when they have expressed or implied their reasons for various acts and observances; have shown that the manufacture of the various artifacts?vessel, weapon, or building?was no mere mechanical process, but had definite reasons for the shape and the method of producing that shape, and observ ances to be followed before the work was begun, during its progress, and after its completion. It is this mental and spiritual embroidery to his writing that has raised it to engage human interest much beyond what mere drawings and measurements and specifications could do, however useful and essential such material guides and dictators may be. It has made the difference to his writing that the application of ornament has made to the artifacts themselves; mere necessity has, in a measure, been disguised by the attractive features of art; we have work produced, not only through stark necessity, but with the enjoyment that abolishes tedium from labour. In ornamenting his artifacts man is but imitating living nature? nature with her mysterious but imperious urge, her infinitely complex, often strange, sometimes humorously grotesque, but usually beautiful manifestations, her artifacts of shell and plant and creature delicately touched with ornamentation?beauty and utility in perfect combination. Man unconsciously imitates the great living mother to whose breast he lives so closely ; and his suspicion or apprehension of a spirit or presence behind that living nature on which he was so dependent, expressed itself in his spiritual concepts. In the present volume Dr. Buck has left the material culture with its details capable of exact measurement, and depiction in drawing or photograph, and has entered with steps occasionally hesitant and uncertain that region which is unmeasurable as a whole or in its parts, which defies figures and all statistics, and which, immaterial itself, exerts tremendous influence on the material. The book comprises the substance of Dr. Buck's three lectures at Yale University, and is included in the series of Terry lectures dealing with " Religion in the Light of Science and Philosophy." It is in three chapters: 1, Man creates his Gods; 2, The Gods create Man; 3, The Death of the Gods. The third chapter, to follow the evolutionary sequence, might have been Man destroys his Gods.</page><page sequence="2">194 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY The first chapter elaborates the mot, quoted in the course of his chapter?" Man created God in his own image." The third chapter is excellently summarized in the brief incident in a Maori Land Court when a certain Maori was giving his evidence. He was tracing a line of ancestory down from the Polynesian gods, when he remarked: " But they are dead now." " Gods do not die," said the Judge. " Yes, they do," answered the Maori, " unless there are tohunga to keep them alive." Whence the title of the chapter, "The Death of the Gods"; a pathetic chapter; a Polynesian Goetterdaemmerung. The Polynesian religion was, like most others, partly what Max Mueller called anthropomorphic, partly what he called natural, the idea of immortality being fostered by the phenomenon of dream. As during sleep the world of dream was entered, so at death, the deeper sleep, the world of immortality. Man found that at death the Rubicon was not crossed; the dead could return to the world of dream and there associate with those still in the world of life. Could he then not also be recalled to the world of life? Apparently he could, by the art of the tohunga, and alas! also by the artifice of the medium. But who knows, when the vision comes to him, whether it comes through the gate of ivory or the gate of horn? Whilst the leaders during life departed, their influence remained; did it then proceed from the leader still moving in the dim world where he might be seen, and from which on shadowy occasion he might return, then he must in some way still be connected with those on whom he still exerted his influence. The leader became a spiritual leader; it was the beginning of deification. The creation of deities still lingers on in the creation of saints, distance in time weakening the human element, and strength ening the mystical divine. A few phrases come to mind : " The divine right of kings"; "The king can do no wrong"; "There's such divinity doth hedge a king . . . "?these and the like show how the idea still lingers; show how admiration still verges of adoration; and whilst the last English king who persisted in acting on the assump tion of his divinity was decapitated, the sentiment which had governed it did not fall with the head of the king. It is from seeing how a man may become a king, a king divine, that it is easy to see how time might take the further step and make the divine a divinity. Why else have we in our language the word apotheosis? It is begging the question to say that the meaning of the word has changed. Most words do change, as we ourselves change; but originally the words meant what they said, and expressed quite definite ideas. Originally a leader was the head of the tribe, literally the father of the tribe; the idea persists when a president is called the father of his country, a king the father of his people. There is also a direct connection between the words and the thought of the names Dyaus pitar through Zeus, Jupiter, Jehovah, to Our Father Which art in Heaven. To the simple there must be an intermediary between the unseen divine and the seen mortal, as there is usually an intermediary (or many intermediaries varying in degree from high to low) between the</page><page sequence="3">Review. 195 king and the people. With the Polynesian there was the tohungay the priestly expert. Was not Peter given the keys of heaven??and was not their custody handed on to his vice-regent on earth?the Father on Earth? For his title, Pope (Greek pappas, Latin papa), means Father. So do Heathenesse and Christianity meet on common ground; the same in inspiration, the same in idealization, and we trust the same in realization. Many people do not like these disturbing speculations ; they prefer faith without question ; they resemble Hood : " It was a childish ignorance, But now 'tis little joy To think I'm farther off from heaven Than when I was a boy." But we are never far from it; we are told it is within us; and we feel that it is around us?if we only would allow it to lap us in its peace. A suggestion of special interest in Dr. Buck's discourse is his suggestion that the major Polynesian deities?Tane, Tangaroa, Tu, and Rongo, were ancestors very far back in time, leaders of the Polynesians in their earliest migrations; they were leaders of various sections of the race, and on their gradual apotheosis Tane became the ascendant deity in one region, Tangaroa in another, but all were known, and as in community life there were experts in various departments, so the deities assumed departmental duties. " Tane was given Forestry, and hence controlled trees, birds, and insect life. He naturally became the tutelary deity of wood craftsmen ... Tu was given the depart ment of War, and warriors were dedicated to his service. Rongo presided over Horticulture and Food . . . Tangaroa ruled over the Marine department, and hence was appealed to by deep-sea voyagers and fishermen. This simple, straightforward pattern occurs in New Zealand, but, while the main principles also exist in other marginal groups, certain changes occur. Thus some gods are given greater influence and others are demoted." (p. 38). When these anectsors became deities?and the process is seen arrested in Maui, a later navigator and discoverer of a thousand years ago who is regarded as a semi-deity only?the necessity was seen of providing them with superhuman ancestory, and Rangi the Heaven-father, and Papa the Earth-mother, were created, with all the appertaining circumstances gradually added, and artistically added; they ornamented their myths as they ornamented their arti facts. Another interesting suggestion is that from the Polynesian tri angle in the Pacific whose points are at Hawaii, New Zealand, and Easter island, the traditional knowledge of these four principal deities indicates that the centre of radiation was Tahiti. Dr. Buck traces their distribution, variation, substitution; and concludes that whilst he does not think that the Polynesians were at one time monotheistic, becoming later polytheistic, indicating a Fall, he does think there are</page><page sequence="4">196 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY indications of a trend from polytheism to monotheism. The idea of a supreme deity, Io the parent, Io the fatherless, he considers may have originated in New Zealand, probably in the Wairarapa district. It may be so; but there apparently was, as he states, a similar monotheistic tendency apparent in the Tuamotu group, the name there being Kiho? which has no connection, he says, with the name Io, except in the philosophical idea of his attributes. It is a question as to how far the words of speech are affected by the organs of speech. There seems to be no doubt that the very first manifestations of human speech?mama, papa, and the like?are purely automatic; the question is as to how far automatism extends; how far the involuntary becomes the voluntary or is supplanted by the voluntary. What is at the root of the evolution of names? For here we have Io, and Kiho, and in the ancient part of the old world Iao. In Mangaia io is the name commonly used for a deity, Motoro being called Io ora (the living deity) because he would not permit his worshippers to be offered in sacrifice. The other deities were called Io mate (deities of death), as their worshippers might be offered on the alters of Kongo of the shades. " Most appropriately and beauti fully," wrote Gill, " do the natives transfer the name Io ora, or The li ving-god, to Jehovah." The old-world name Iao is a triliteral form of the name Jehovah.* We come nearer to a knowledge of the location of Hawaiki in Maori legend: Dr. Buck notes that the ancient name of Ra'iatea was Havai'i and Havai'i is the Hawaiki of the Maori. Dr. Buck uses the form taboo for the Maori tapu, but to show that he does so consciously, and his reason can be understood, he links the two?tapu (taboo), and thereafter uses taboo. There is no b in Polynesian, and oo is merely the sound in Polynesia that has been represented by u, so in New Zealand we have kept to tapu. The word " demote " is used by Dr. Buck, once in the passage quoted above, and twice subsequently?a transpacific coinage not yet adopted universally; "degrade" is better known; is there any particular difference in meaning? I have said little of the third chapter?a melancholy chapter to every lover of the Polynesians. It is written with restraint of feeling, restraint of expression, and Polynesian subtlety. Let part of the conclusion be quoted: " The death of the Polynesian gods was followed by profound changes that, commencing with religion, extended to the disorganiza tion of society and the wrecking of the native arts and crafts. The changes at first were tyrannical and but dimly understood . . . The Mangaians, as well as the rest of the Polynesians, have readjusted * For further discussions on this wide-spread name, see Andersen, Myths and Legends of the Polynesians, and on the implications of the universal adoption of " religion " in one form or another, the same writer's The Lamp of Psyche, was written to show that a heightening of hope has justification which a deepening of despair has not.</page><page sequence="5">Review. 197 themselves to the Christian religion. If Christianity is any evidence of Western culture, the island communities of Polynesia are more civilized to-day than the masses in the great cities of Europe and America. As an anthropologist, I see religion as an essential part of the culture of any people. Probably a psychologist or a theologian could phrase things better than I can, but I have attempted to avoid what has been termed ' the verbal bondage of a sterile and paralyzing metaphysics. ' I have a firm conviction that the things man has created with his mind and worshipped in the spirit are as real to him as the material things he has made with his hands. A system of ethics may be sufficient for the intellectual minority, but it is devoid of the feeling and emotion that appeals to the masses of the people. The belief in the supernatural and in the immortality of the soul must be accepted as real facts that have led to action and results. I am not concerned as to whether the supernatural can be proved or dis proved scientifically. As a student of the manners, customs, and thoughts of peoples, I am concerned with their beliefs. The belief in immortality is a living, vital fact that has brought and still brings comfort and happiness to large masses of people. But, though religion seems to be a necessary part of every culture, its value in Western civilization has been depreciating. Our present civilization is sick and fast losing its right to be called ' civilization ' . . . I believe that the Christian religion is an integral part of Western civilization or culture and that it is one of the few restraining forces that may yet guide us back to faith in goodness, truth, and justice. The death of the Christian gods would mean the collapse of the culture to which they belong just as surely as the death of the Polynesian gods led to the end of Polynesian culture. Religion needs no scientific proof, for it is based on faith. Faith to those who have it is a vivid reality. Could we but restore that faith, we might be able to say to a sick world in the words of the Great Master, ' Arise, go thy way ; thy faith hath made thee whole.' J. C. A.</page></plain_text>
