They etnphastze the poeqn's qnythologtcal alluszons, showing how the gypsy gtrl andv the sntrustve wtnd turn before the readeWs eyes snto nyrnph and satyr.

[D. B.] tN dealing with Ilorca's "Preciosa y el aire,"l critics tend to 1 assume that the poem is completely dominated by the same atmosphere of tension and tragedy to be found in poems like s ' Romance sonambulo " and in the poet 's rural tragedies. Our attention is called to the anthropomorphic figure of the wind, a gypsy version of Pan blown over from Africa, and to the panic fear of poor Preciosa as she stumbles up the Alhambra hill.2 'sPreciosa y el aire" is seen exclusivelyt it would appear, as a wild, romantic poem filled with nothing but the lightning flashes of a sensual, storm-tossed night, in which everyday people are turned into figures from ancient legend.3 But if this is exclusively the case, and if Preciosa and the intrusive wind are turned before our eyes into nymph and satyr, no satisfactory classical parallel has yet been proposed for another character in the poem, the British Consul.

The general rule is to ignore him; when he is mentioned, he is treated in a most gingerly faslaion, like a rather unsuitable guest no one knows quite what to do with. Roy Campbell, one honorable exception to the general rule of silence, finds nothing better to say than that Preciosa makes her escape from the wind into "the matter-of-fact atmosphere of the British consul's house."4 Gustavo Correa, in somewhat similar vein, says only that the gypsy girl "se acoge presurosa a la vecina casa de los ingleses, donde encuentra seguro abrigo y benevola acogida. " 5 Arturo Barea quotes a Spanish priest of his acquaintance as being shocked that Preciosa should betray her ancient heritage by seeking refuge in "the white tower of English civilization" and as rejoicing that "she didn't drink their lukewarm milk and gin," a refusal the priest apparently felt had patriotic overtones.6 All these writers seem to take the confrontation between Preci- osa and the consul completely for granted, as though it were an everyday event not worth a second glance. One gets the im- pression that feeding gin and milk to mythological figures is part of the normal evening routine of a British consular officer, and that the description of such a scene as this in no way changes the tone of a poem felt to be basically menacing and legendary. Only Jean-IJouis Schonberg notices that the presence of the Englishman is of decisive importance in the creation of the poem's total effect. Schonberg sees clearly that the consul does not belong in a Greek legend. But for Schonberg, convinced like the rest of the critics that "Preciosa y el aire" is a tragic legend, the introduction of the consul into the poem is a mistake, "una nota e2rtrana, quiza falsa, que parece desentonar en este lindo cuento, porque rompe su unidad poetica sobrenatural...." Schoenberg then goes on imperturbably to attribute this so-called mistake to an attempt on the part of the poet to follow orthodox surrealist doctrine "con objeto de mezelar los tonos y de confundir los planos, segun un principio de superposicion discutible, por otra parte." 7 4Roy CampbelI, Lorca, an ilppreciation of his Poetry (London, 1952), p. 42. 5 Op. cit., p. 27. 6 Arturo Barea, lorca: The Poet and Eis People (New York, 1949), pp. 70-71. 7 Loc. cit.</page><page sequence="3">D* avtd Bary 512 IR ZZEI (1969) If the British consul can lead such an eminent scholar so far astray, he may be worth closer study. In his "white towers" perched 'Xabove the pines," far above the residential quarter of the Alhambra in a remote area guarded by carobineros, the consul lives in an atmosphere we have no right to assume to be '&lt;matter- of-fact,tt like Roy Campbell. It is not matter-of-fact for Preciosa, of that we can be sure Nor would the consul himself, who is not, of course, described in the poem but merely presented, be a familiar, soothing presence half-nurse half-civil servant, for a frightened Spanish gypsy girl, as some Artglo-Sason writers seem to suppose. And what of the poet himself What image might the phrase "el consul de los ingleses't have eonveyed to the mind of Federico Garcia Ilorca The eharacter of the consul may of course be totally arbitrary bearing no relation to any real person.

We know, as will appear in a momentX that Federico was not only aware of their presence but in an excellent position to know salient details about their houses, characters, social lives and more obvious eeeentricities. An interesting aceount of the British colony in GEranada has been provided by Gerald Brenan in his eharming book South from Granada.9 With a single exception, Brenan tells us, they lived in a row of modest carqnenes on the southern edge of the Alhambra hill eaeh with its view of the city below. The real British consul at the time-a mere Vice-Consul in point of faet-was a Mr. William l:)avenhill, who lived with his charming and hospitable family in a house whose view was unfortately blocked when the Alhambra Palaee Hotel was built just in front of it.

This in itself, to be sure, would have been enough to single them out from the rest of the local residents. They were, so to speak, generically eccentric if not personally so. There was another Englishman in GEranada, however, who was personally as well as generically eccentric. He lived above the Alhambra quarter, 'sin a new, expensive house high up on the bare spur that adjoins the cemetery." Built on the site of some old F'rench fortifications, the house followed eccentric ideas on architecture held by its creator, Charles Temple, a former British colonial administrator called by Brenan an unusually fine e;- ample of the Edwardian governing class. Ijike his wife, who was a product of the same upbringing, he was liberal, broadminded, honest, responsible and high-principled; he was also, says Brenan, bleak, remote and aloof. The Temples, in Brenan 's view, be- longed to some sort of special race of "supermen, bred exlusively to bear the white man's burden and whose only faults were that they had so few weaknesses. " Unlike the rest of the British colony, Charles Temple did not fit into the life of Granada. In Brenan 's words, " his too obvious indiference to what people thought of him created a bad impression." In sllmmer he wore two felt hats, one on top of the other, to protect himself from the heat, a habit which led to his being followed around by groups of small boys with rags or broken pots on their heads. Recurrent attacks of fever forced him to wear an overcoat in the house; when this happened he wore a coat stained with paint and oil from his workshop, itself an eccentricity for a man of his class. He wore it over evening dress when the Ambassador came to dinner. He had built his house according to Mongol ideas as to the proper relationship between house and surrounding countryside, and had ordered the architect to avoid the use of right angles whenever possible and to place all the fireplaces four feet above the floor on a level with the face of a seated person. We have no record of what the British Ambassador may have thought of the Temple menage, but we owe Brenan a vote of thanks for preserving the reaction of a Spanish guest to one of the Temples ' most characteristic habits, their " sunset ceremony. " This can best be presented in Brenan's words:</page><page sequence="5">David Bary 514 ER, 2c2c2CVII (1969) The Temples had built their house on a hill high above the eity so that it might command a view of the snow mountains. Every evening after tea, at the hour when the sun was getting ready to set, Mrs. Temple would marshal her guests toward the veranda or, if it was eold, to the large window faeing south, and pronounce in her slow, emphatic, careful voice, "I dont think it will be long now." We looked and waited. Gradually the smooth, undulating summits, whieh up to that moment had seemed remote and unterrestrial, began to turn a pale rose, just as though the beaxn of a Teehnicolor projector had been turned on them. "There," she said. "Now." At once a silence fell upon all of us, and we sat without moving, watching the rose flush deepen and then fade away. As soon as it had completely gone everyone began talking again with the sense of relief felt by people who have just come out of ehurch and without any allusion to what they had just witnessed. Brenan himself became so used to the sunset ceremony that he came to take it for granted. But one day he left the Temples' after tea in the company of one of their Spanish friends. The Spaniard was greatly puzzled. " Can you tell me, " he asked Brenan as they walked down the hill, "what was going on when we all sat without speaking, looking at the pink spot on the moun- tain n " " Why, " continued the Spaniard, " was everyone so serious?" There seeming to be no way of ducking the question, Brenan explained that his friend had just witnessed "a mystical rite confined to the higher levels of the British Raj." "Here it's the sunset on the snow," said Brenan. "But in other places it may take the form of watching through field glasses some rare bird, a siskin, for e2rample, or a peregrine falcon, alighting on its nest. Our vieeroys and Foreign Ministers draw strength in difficult moments from such things." The Spaniard considered Brenan 's explanation. " I don 't understand, " he said. Now this Spaniard who did not understand was perhaps the least provineial and most broadminded man in Granada. He was Don Fernando de los Rios, then Professor of IJaw at the University of Granada and later Minister of Eduea- tion. If anybody in Granada could have understood the Temples, he should surely have been the man. Don F'ernando was dedi- eated to fighting narrow provincialism, both intellectual and politi- eal, in his native country. Nenophobia was not among his faults. The reaetion of Don Fernando de los Rios to his eecentrie English</page><page sequence="6">P* . . * . rectosa anol the Eng tsh 515 friends was one of polite bewilderment. What, we might ask, would have been the attitude of a younger and livelier person, such as Don lfernando's student and son-in-law, Francisco Gareia Ijorea? Or of Francisco's mischievous brother Federico, also a protege of Don Fernando's? We need not imagine that Federico, like Don Fernando, was in the habit of visiting the Temples. But he must have been familiar with the fact of their esistence and their eecentricity, just as he knew that a member of the British consular service lived on the Alhambra hill. They must have struck him as quite mad and as wildly funny, even as people worth putting in a poem, which might just possibly explain why the consul in the poem does not live down by the Alhambra, where Federico probably knew the real consul lived, but "up above the pines," in a position similar to that occupied by the Temples. But if there is by chance a touch of C:harles Temple in the make-up of IJorca's fictional consul7 his presumed influence could not have been decisive in the creation of the character. The char- acter would have been the same without him. Temple's impor- tance lies in another direction. His obvious eccentritity gives us English-speaking readers a clue to the probable nature and role of the consul in the poem. The poet7s undoubted inside knowledge about the oddness of the English colony on the hill ouly served to reinforce a stereotype which Roy Campbell overlooked when he spoke of the "matter-of-fact" atmosphere of the consul's house. The plain fact is that in the Spanish popular mind an English- man, particularly an English gentlemen, is pso facto a comic character. Ijorea's consul is not described in the poem, just as the three carabtneros are not described, because they are stock characters conforming to popular stereotypes. The poet assumes that the reader will share his vision of the British consul as necessarily comic; there was no need of special nudges and winks to prepare the reader for the idea that the consul's confrontation of the frightened gypsy girl fleeing from the wind is a comic scene. The words "aquella gente," applied in the last stanza to Preciosa 's mixed audience of Englishmen arld carabineros, are surely a laconic masterpiece of comic understatement. A more inappropriate audience for the tale of Preciosa's adventure with</page><page sequence="7">516 David Bary HR, L:X:VII (1969) the salacious wind could hardly be imagined than people like the Temples, or kindly Mr. Davenhill himself, for that matter. One could quibble about the degree of humor to be found in the scene; perhaps it is only droll. In any event} it does not fit the tone of a tragic legend, as Schonberg notes when he ateuses the poet of breaking the "supernatural unity77 of the lines pre- ceding the introduction of the consul. This observation of Sehon- berg's leads to an obvious question. Does Preciosa7s arrival at the Englishman's house mark a break in the poem's tone, a sudden shift from tragedy to farce? A convincing answer must be based on the evidenee of the text, of course, but the burden of proof would seem to lie on those who assume, simply because the Romaqlt- cero Xtano contains many violent and tragic poems, that "Preciosa y el aire7' is one of them. A re-reading of the poem does not seem to corroborate their assumption, as regards either the tone or the content of the poem. Violence and terror are present in "Preciosa y el aire," but in forms very different from those they assume in other ballads. The violence of the wind threatens to take the form of rape, but it remains nothing more than a threat, and even this threat is only a metaphor, after all. Preciosa's terror though real, is not shared by the reader, as it would have been in a poem like the 'zRomance del emplazado.27 The three carabtneros almost like toy soldiers here, are completely lacking in the menate which charat- terizes their counterparts in other poems. The rnenate felt by Preciosa herself does not pervade the tone of the poem, which is not without a certain lightness and playfulness. The themes of tragedy and terror are here used as playthungs; the mythological allusions are used as mythology might have been used in a seven- teenth-eentury rnasque as themes for a dteertzmerwto. There is no need, therefore, to be surprised that the entertainment should find a suitable conclusion in the incongruous visit of Preciosa to the house of the British consul, arld no necessity to invent gratuitous contrasts between a droll ending and a beginning that was never tragie, nor to aseribe the poetNs marvellous invention of the seene between the girl and the Englishman to a humorless attempt to follow orthodox surrealist doetrine. The British consul in short, is almost certainly that stock figure of the Spanish imagination, a comic Englishman; his meet-</page><page sequence="8">Preciosa and the English 517 ing with Preciosa, an amusing and incongruous vision, is a fitting climas to a playful poem whose tone, "amphibious" as the path followed by Preciosa herself, mises laughter and terror, legend and gossip into a marvellous eli2rir which promises to maintain its potency with the passing of the years.
