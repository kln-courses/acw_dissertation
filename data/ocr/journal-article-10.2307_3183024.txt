<plain_text><page sequence="1">SI s ABSTRACT In recent years, social studies of science have developed a deep interest in the conduct of science in the field. However, studies of controversial field science remain relatively rare. This paper presents an analysis of a controversy about the origin of primate infanticide that began in the 1970s, and discusses the ways in which controversies in the field differ from those in the laboratory. Particularly important here is the inability of researchers to control the behaviour of their research subjects; to an important extent, the conduct of their research is dependent on the agency of their research subjects. Finally, it also points to the r6le played by the sciences of animal behaviour in the constructions of stories about the biological basis of human culture, a r6le that means that the investigation of controversy in these sciences is of paramount public importance.

However, although there have been many studies of laboratory controversies, and an ever-increasing number of studies of field science,' there have been relatively few attempts to study examples of controversial field science. It can sometimes be difficult, of course, to draw a line between the field and the laboratory, particularly where the process of validating scientific knowledge moves aspects of that knowledge from the lab to the field and back again,2 but the experience of conducting science in the field is, none the less, very different from that of doing so in the laboratory. Henrika Kuklick and Robert Kohler's introduction to their edited volume of studies of field science expresses this point concisely in their reference to the fact that '[u]nlike laboratories, natural sites can never be exclusively scientific domains'.3 Field sites can face threats to their physical and epistemological integrity, and this is particularly the case when the site is based in areas of the globe where issues of conservation and development can conflict with research aims. When the site is used by ethologists, the navigation of the situation can become even more complex. At the heart of ethology is a commitment to Social Studies of Science 31/4(August 2001) 507-31 ?

This commitment can cause scientific controversy for one central reason: there is no theoretical consensus as to the place of humanity within a definition of the natural world. A general example of this can be seen in the way in which reported observations from a specific field site are frequently presented as representative of the typical behaviour of a particular species: but the degree to which these observations are accepted as such often seems to hang on the extent to which the observer has managed to steer his or her way through two important questions. First, have the animals under observation been affected either by human proximity or by the impact of humanity on the local environment? Second, is the reported behaviour an account of the researcher's observation of the animals, or is it solely a product of the researcher's interpretation of the animals' behaviour? This last question becomes even more important when the animals under investigation are the non-human primates. The problem is twofold, relating both to the way in which primatological studies intersect with stories about the origin of humanity, and to the problem of attributing human emotional and cognitive capacities to the non-human primates. First, it can be seen that several studies have documented the way in which the studies of hominids and non-human primates can become cultural resources for explaining human behaviour.4 Second, it is clear that the suggestion that the scientist has tended towards anthropomorphism in reporting the results of research can be an effective sanction when any ethological subject becomes controversial.5 Within primatology, there has been a particularly interesting example of a controversy where these questions surrounding the character of science in the field, the nature of authoritative observation and the problem of anthropomorphism were unusually well defined. Donna Haraway examined this controversy in 1983,6 when she demonstrated the extent to which the 'natural world' had been constructed in the field, and the degree to which debates featuring the non-human primates had been materially shaped by contemporary political discourse. As part of a wider project that investigated the character of field-based scientific research, I want to expand on Haraway's analysis of the controversy surrounding primate infanticide, since I view this specific debate as an interesting and distinctive case in the sociological study of controversy. I will argue that the nature of the debate surrounding the act of non- human primate infanticide, a debate that began in the mid-1 970s, provides an opportunity to examine the extent to which the field environment itself provides researchers involved in a controversy with the opportunity to challenge, or to ignore, assertions made by their opponents. It differs from previous studies of controversies in a number of ways, and I will expand on these points during the paper. However, for the moment, it is important to note just one of the most significant differences. Broadly, controversy studies have been conducted in one of two ways. Researchers have either chosen to study events long past,7 or they have followed the central actors in a debate as it progresses.8 In both cases, the concern of the researcher is</page><page sequence="3">Rees: Practising Infanticide, Observing Narrative 509 with the problem of resolution: impartiality is achieved either through historical distance or by the unknown outcome of the controversy. In either case, considerable interest is shown in exactly how the controversy reached conclusion: how did (and do) facts become factual? But in this example, while the events that inspired the debate were first observed to occur three or four decades ago, there is still some question as to whether the contro- versy can be said to be resolved. I will demonstrate that it is the character of the field environment itself that inhibits resolution in this instance. In addition, because the events of the controversy are both physically and temporally distant, occurring as they did in India and other parts of Asia several decades ago, and because infanticide is a relatively rare event among free-living non-human primates, I cannot watch the primatologists as they observe a potentially infanticidal male gazing in the direction of a vulnerable infant. But although this would approach one kind of socio- logical ideal, it would not be an accurate way of examining the nature of this controversy. The rarity of infanticide, the fact that primatologists seldom visited each other's sites to carry out research, and were unlikely to see an act of infanticide even if they did, the fact that no-one ever ques- tioned the existence of primate infanticide,9 only the correct explanation for infanticide, means that the controversy was conducted and exists as a series of claims about observations (and claimed observations), principally expressed in the form of scientific texts. That is to say, what was being contested was what one could write about one's observations, and what was to count as an observation. At the heart of the controversy was the issue of the correct interpretation of a sequence of observed and presumed events, which were reported to the interested Western communities via a number of different professional and popular journals. The controversy consisted of a series of attempts to privilege different events in the narrative of primate infanticide, successive efforts to moralize different versions of reality. The nature of this controversy makes it an ideal opportunity to explore the rhetorical nature of scientific textual discourse, and it is the nature of these claims, as they were played out against the background of the field environment, that I want to examine here. I will demonstrate the way in which the participants in the controversy made use of a number of textual and rhetorical devices in order to support their particular versions of what exactly was happening at these remote (from the perspective of the West) field sites. These devices centred on the construction of narrative sequences of events. At issue were the questions of who was observing these events, and what were their qualifications for doing so? What was to count as an observation of infanticide? At a point where the observational evidence seemed inconclusive, could theory be used in place of empirical data? And, most importantly, constructions of absent data provided an important resource for those involved in the infanticide debates. I will focus on five articles about infanticide, two published in a general science magazine (American Scientist), three published in more specialist</page><page sequence="4">510 Social Studies of Science 31/4 journals (Folia Primatologica, Ethology and Sociobiology, Krober Anthropo- logical Society Papers). Three of these were written by Sarah Blaffer Hrdy,'0 who is generally credited with being the first person publicly to argue for the interpretation of infanticide as an evolutionary strategy." The others were written by two of her opponents in the debate, Richard Curtin and Phyllis Dolhinow.'2 (I will embed references to quotations from these papers in the text.) I will also draw on a number of other papers from within the specialist primatological literature to illustrate the way in which the controversy affected the development of the rest of the field, and on a general text produced as a result of a 1982 Wenner Gren conference entitled 'Infanticide in Animals and in Man', which was intended to summarize current thinking on the theory and practice of infanticide.'3 I will also try to give some idea of the way in which the controversy was received by the rest of the ethological community through reference to a general textbook on animal behaviour.'4 Since much of the controversy hinged on the development of competing interpretive narratives, I will follow the narratives and consider the rival versions of events as they were related to the interested communities. The Genesis of the Infanticide Debate To begin at the beginning, it may be useful to give some background to the controversy. The debate was focused on the behaviour of a particular group of primates, the hanuman langurs (Presbytis entellus). These are relatively large bodied, leaf eating, semi-terrestrial monkeys that have lived in close proximity to humans in India for thousands of years. Their very name, 'hanuman', is derived from that of a monkey deity. Western observers had studied these creatures in the field since 1958, beginning with Phyllis Jay's original studies at field sites in Orcha and Kaukori,'5 but it was in the early 1960s that Yukimaru Sugiyama, a primatologist at a different site in Dharwar, first saw adult male langurs treating infants violently.'6 The research at Orcha and Kaukori differed from the studies at Dharwar in other ways, as well; Jay's research suggested that langur life was relatively peaceful, even idyllic, while Sugiyama noted that disruptive social change occurred frequently at his site. The adult male leaders of a particular group were often replaced, and that replacement appeared to be accompanied by the death or disappearance of infant or juvenile langurs. But as Sugiyama pointed out, these differences were probably related to the ecological differ- ences between the sites, specifically, the level of human interference and the troop population density.'7 Infanticide, if it occurred, was accounted accidental, or possibly pathological. A year later, KenjiYoshiba's summary article on variability in langur behaviour concluded that: Infant killing by the new leader was not confirmed in all cases of social change [and] the infants born after the change of the new leader male were never attacked by the new leader, although it was certain they had no genetic relation to him.18</page><page sequence="5">Rees: Practising Infanticide, Observing Narrative 511 Like Sugiyama, Yoshiba blamed the infant deaths on the high rate of social change, brought about by an abnormally high population density, which was the consequence of the human pressure on the natural environment. There seemed no reason to consider infanticide as anything other than abnormal. Certainly, Yoshiba's conclusion was that the 'adaptive value of a particular behaviour in a certain environment, such as the killing of infants by the new troop leader, is not yet clear'.'9 The consensus, at this point, seemed to be that there was evidence for strange behaviour by adult male langurs under particularly stressful conditions, conditions produced by the way in which human population increase and economic development had reduced the territory available to langur troops. Males found themselves in closer competitive proximity, and aggression became a more frequent element in troop life. Infanticide and Sociobiology This consensus was disrupted by the publication of Sarah Blaffer Hrdy's results in 1974. In 1971, inspired by the accounts of langur infanticide, she had set out for India, and her interpretations of her observations were to change the tone of the debate radically. In the opening paragraphs of her article, she puts forward the central plank of her thesis: that among langurs, infanticide occurs repeatedly and 'under conditions which now must be considered normal for this species' [Hrdy, 1974: 19-20] .20 That is to say, the event is not a pathological act, but an adaptive evolutionary strategy. The structure and style of Hrdy's article follow the introduction; infanticide is to be considered an utterly normal part of langur life. In her accounts of her observations, she refers to Sugiyama's description of the 'type case of langur infanticide' [Hrdy, 1974: 20, emphasis added]. She creates a 'hypothetical scenario of the life-cycle of a langur troop', a troop which normally consists of a single adult male and a number of females [25]. According to this scenario, the adult male of this troop will at some point find himself ejected by a coalition of bachelor males, one of whom will then drive off his erstwhile allies and establish himself as troop leader; in the process, he will kill off any infants fathered by his predecessor. Why would he do this? Because this will then cause the females to regain their fertility more quickly, thus allowing him to impregnate them sooner, and therefore maximizing the chances that his own offspring will have reached maturity before he himself is deposed as leader male by another bachelor coalition. In this way, a male maximizes his reproductive success by eliminating the progeny of his rivals and providing for the survival of his own offspring. Hrdy's innovation here is to argue that infanticide was simply the product of male-male competition (an idea originally put forward by Sugiyama), and hence the adaptive product of both sexual and natural selection. In this way, she ties her interpretation, her competition hypothesis, to evolutionary theory - a strategy which, given the rapidly</page><page sequence="6">512 Social Studies of Science 31/4 rising profile of sociobiology at that time, definitely had the potential to improve her article's chances on the academic savannah. What evidence does she put forward for this cyclical pattern of competitive usurpation? Observation conditions at the site were relatively good, and the article is replete with extremely detailed observations and measurements of the interactions between the adults, and between the adults and infants. However, at the outset, she informs her audience that her 'records for any one troop [were] interrupted' either by her absences from the site, absences of up to a year in length, or by the fact that she could only follow one troop at a time. However, she argues that these . . . drawbacks were in part offset by the fact that the langurs of Abu live in or near a town of 8,000 people. Unusual occurrences (such as leadership change or infant killing) were sometimes witnessed by local people. Where reports from reliable informants coincided with what I knew ... they were accepted by me as facts. [Hrdy, 1974: 23-24] Seven different troops were observed over the period of her research, but '[o]nly in the case of troops B-3 and B-6 was it possible to reconstruct transitional events with any degree of confidence' [27], and her reconstruc- tion, on which her 'hypothetical scenario of the life cycle of a langur troop' is based, is derived from the information of local people, and on presumed connections (for example, she states that 'the concurrence of these diverse clues led me to assume that the new male had killed at least two, and very probably all six infants' [28]). With regard to the observations of the local people, in a footnote on page 38, she notes the existence of a folk belief that 'langur males routinely kill all male infants'. Her conclusion firmly links 'political change and infanticide', and more tentatively 'political changes and population density' [42]. But she rejects the idea that langur infanticide 'is somehow pathological', because the attacks were 'highly goal-directed and organized', because they seemed to be carried out accord- ing 'to roughly accurate assessments of paternity', because females seemed to have evolved strategies for avoiding infanticidal attacks, and because 'high levels of aggression have been ongoing for at least 130 years' [45]. American Scientist and Infanticide Theories Before analysing the nature of these claims, I want to examine Hrdy's popularization of her thesis, because this issue of the historical precedent for observations of infanticide becomes an important resource in Hrdy's account of the theory of infanticide as an adaptive reproductive strategy [Hrdy, 1977].21 The subtitle to her article in the American Scientist is unequivocal, stating as it does that '[c] onflict is basic to all creatures that reproduce sexually [and that] infanticide among langurs illustrates an extreme form of this conflict'. She further notes that the earliest published accounts of langur aggression 'date back before the time of Darwin' [Hrdy, 1977: 40]. As in her earlier article, she begins by reviewing the physiology and socio-ecology of the langur species, stressing that</page><page sequence="7">Rees: Practising Infanticide, Observing Narrative 513 ... males typically leave their natal troop or are driven out by other males prior to maturity.... They will not return again to troop life unless as adults they are successful in invading a bisexual troop and usurping resident males. [40] Langur society is made up of 'closed social units' [40]. Lack of direct citation in this popular article makes it impossible to tell from which research this account of langur behaviour is drawn. But since the account is given in a popular science magazine, written for an interested, but non- specialist audience, the account clearly gives the impression that this view of the constituent elements of langur society - including the importance of the conflict between individual males - is held by the majority of modern researchers. However, it is also clear that Hrdy is presenting a novel argument, which might not be accepted by other researchers. She acknowledges that the generation of researchers who preceded her in the field did not stress the importance of aggression as a crucial aspect of langur life, but it would appear that the explanation for this is clear. She notes that 19th-century observers had reported langur aggression, and that Sugiyama had seen similar events at Dharwar. But she contrasts these accounts with those provided by those 'social scientists' who began the 'modern era of primate studies', and who were 'profoundly influenced by current social theory' - specifically, the integrative theories of Alfred R. Radcliffe-Brown [41, emphasis added]. Because of this pre-existing commitment to co-operation, these early modern researchers were convinced that 'primates behave as they do for the good of their group', and therefore they dismissed the accounts of aggression and competition as inaccurate and anecdotal [41]. Hrdy's implication is obvious; if these later researchers had not had their vision clouded by their commitment to a particular version of social reality then, like their predecessors and now their successor, they too would have realized the importance of aggression to stable langur society. Again, Hrdy's account of her empirical observations acknowledges the existence of gaps in her research, but it is coupled with a strong narrative account of the reconstructed events in the two troops, Bazaar and Hillside, and of their shifts in male dominance. Like the first, this article recognizes that her periods in the field were short (two or three months in length) and separated by periods of up to a year, and it is studded with sentences such as '[1] ocal inhabitants witnessed the killing of two infants by an adult male', or the 'killing of one [infant] had been observed by a local amateur ornithologist' [43]. In other cases, she describes attacks made on infants who 'eventually disappeared and [were] presumed dead' [44]. Again, she is reporting observations of others, and her interpretations of what might have happened when the animals were out of sight. It should be noted that the fact that she did not directly observe infant killing by adult males will play an important role in the light of the later attempts that were made to re-order Hrdy's narrative account of what was taking place at Abu - both in terms of her theoretical model and in the light of what she herself had been able to see.</page><page sequence="8">514 Social Studies of Science 31/4 Hrdy's inference and implication are that social change in langur troops tends to be accompanied by infant death - and she manages to render the potential empirical weakness of her account almost irrelevant by her theoretical justification. It no longer matters that she did not see males killing infants because she has shown the audience how males ought, under certain circumstances, to kill infants. She begins by stressing the advantages of infanticide for males who have only a short period of access to females: [I]nfanticide permits an incoming male to use his short reign more efficiently than if he allowed unweaned infants present in the troop at his entrance to survive, to continue to suckle and thus to delay the mother's next conception.... Once infant killing began, a usurper would be penalized for not committing infanticide. [45, emphasis in original] A non-infanticidal male would run the risk that his own offspring would remain unweaned and vulnerable when he himself was ousted from the troop. Not all male take-overs are accompanied by infant death (only nine out of 15 reported take-overs also reported infant disappearance); the crucial point Hrdy must make is that attacks on infants only occur when stranger males enter the troop - that is to say, by males who could not possibly have fathered the infants. It is because of this that she feels that rather than being examples of 'pathological' behaviour, 'attacks on infants were highly goal directed' [46]. In addition, and in lieu of other langur data, she cites reports of behaviour that might fit her model from other monkey and ape species, and again refers to the 19th-century reports of langur aggression. Her closing paragraphs form an attempt to restate the research agenda of primatology. Earlier, she had pointed out that an 'important area of future research will be learning exactly what means a langur male has at his disposal for discriminating infants probably his own from those probably sired by some other male' [46]. Now she moves to female counter-strategies: why do females tolerate infanticidal males? Why do they not form alliances against marauding males? Perhaps this is the result of female-female competition for representation within the next generation's gene pool, but the answer to the questions will presumably be for the next generation of researchers to answer. The organization of this article and the nature of the claims that are made in it tend to render Hrdy's competition hypothesis unproblematic in the following ways. First, her account of the current state of research, written for a non-specialist audience, presents a particular view of langur society as commanding general acceptance. Second, she sidelines her potential critics by implying that they are out of date (they are 'early workers' and their research was carried out when primatology was a 'fledgling science' [41]). Not only that, but they allowed their preconcep- tions about the basis of society to colour their perceptions in the field. Third, she eradicates alternatives: langur society is formed of closed social units where there can be many females but only one male. Therefore, in order to breed, the extra males must force their way into mixed troops. Her</page><page sequence="9">Rees: Practising Infanticide, Observing Narrative 515 development of this powerfully cyclical narrative of take-over and replace- ment is given far more space than either the apparently stable social structure of the other three troops which she observed in the district, or the discussion of the potential problems her competition model faces in the light of the fact that her field observation time was extremely limited. Her concentration on the Hillside and Bazaar troops is justified in her earlier article by the argument that they were the only troops for which it was 'possible to reconstruct transition events with any degree of confidence' [Hrdy, 1974: 27]. It is notable that this account is still a reconstruction, rather than the result of continuous monitoring. Finally, she closes her account with a number of questions for future researchers to investigate, in effect, rendering the issue of whether her interpretation of the (recon- structed?) events at Abu is accurate as moot; primatology must now move on to examine the details of how the individual primate is able to maximize his or her reproductive success in a context where infanticidal strategies are used by others.22 In a sense, Hrdy has little choice other than to order her account in this way, since she faces a number of related problems in both articles. First, she must deal with the absence of unequivocal observations of adult males attacking and killing an unrelated infant. She has seen only attacks on infants and the dead bodies of infants, not the full sequence of violent attack followed by infant death, although she uses the reports of local people to connect these events into an account of a fatal attack. Second, in order to put forward an adaptive explanation, an assumption is being made about the probable paternity of the dead infants. Since primate paternity is notoriously difficult to ascertain in the absence of DNA tests, how can she be sure that the attacks were carried out on non-related infants? Both problems are surmounted by the insistence on the single-male/many- female closed sexual pattern for langur troops: bachelor males do not have sexual access to troop females. Therefore they cannot have sired the infants that they are thought to have killed, and they can only reproduce by evicting the resident male. But in both cases, at the heart of the matter is her own inability to observe: how can she be sure about what happened in her absence? It is at this point that the nature of the field environment becomes important, in that these absences are unavoidable. Carrying out fieldwork is difficult, physically and emotionally demanding work. Gaining access to the field can be extremely difficult, particularly when that is combined with commitments to one's home country and institution. And no one person can follow all the activities of all of a group of animals at the same time.23 Any field worker in Hrdy's audience will know this. Hrdy supports her arguments by relying on the techniques that have been drawn out in the previous paragraphs, but also by drawing upon the weight of the detailed description of the activities which she did see, and on a range of accounts of infant killing in other non-human primate species, both caged and wild living, to convince her audience of her conclusion. Lethal attacks on the offspring of rivals are part of a highly advantageous strategy, which has</page><page sequence="10">516 Social Studies of Science 31/4 become part of the primate (in which category humans are included) repertoire. Re-Interpreting the Narrative But the American Scientist story did not end there. In 1978, Richard Curtin and Phyllis Dolhinow published their response to Hrdy's arguments. Recall that originally, one explanation for langur infanticide had been that it was a pathological response to overcrowding caused by the human impact on the natural environment. Hrdy had rejected this in favour of an evolutionary explanation based in inter-individual conflict. In fact, the subtitle of her 1977 article began with the word 'conflict'. Curtin and Dolhinow begin their attempt to reinterpret the events in India for a Western audience when they say in their own subtitle that '[h] uman alteration of the environment may be pushing the gray langur monkey of India beyond the limits of its adaptability' [Curtin &amp; Dolhinow, 1978: 468].24 In this case, therefore, what is being observed is not characteristic of the behaviours of langurs in general, but is a specific response to the impact of humanity on the natural environment; it is not natural, but the result of human influence that is driving the langurs to the limit of their ability to cope with territorial degradation. Despite this very different emphasis, in some ways Curtin and Dolhinow's account can be seen to mirror Hrdy's. Like her, they give an account of the history of langur observations but, this time, the account is one that focuses on the practical difficulties of field research and of watching the wild-living primates, and one that stresses the apparent existence of two patterns of langur social organization. Having acknowl- edged that the langur is at present the focus of 'heated controversy' [Curtin &amp; Dolhinow, 1978: 468], Curtin and Dolhinow draw attention to two points; first that it is very difficult to observe wild-living langurs success- fully, and second, that researchers have discovered at least two different patterns of langur social behaviour. According to their account of the history of langur observation, the species was 'neglected because most of them are forest dwellers and early studies concentrated on animals that could be easily seen' [468]. Now, however, the geographical range of studies has expanded, and it is possible to see that langur social organiza- tion can be divided into two patterns, one that 'probably occurs over the species' whole range and persist[s] under all but the most stressful environ- mental conditions', and another which is an unusual response to these stressful conditions [468-69]. The former pattern is characterized by the presence of more than one male in a bisexual troop, a 'multi-male' pattern that is 'as widespread as the species itself' and now is found where 'human influence on ecological conditions has been slight' [469]. In these troops, males can co-exist amicably or express rivalry through threat signals, fighting, or exclusion from the group on a temporary or permanent basis. In oestrus, females solicit the attention of 'several males if the group is large enough', not necessarily preferring the dominant male [470].</page><page sequence="11">Rees: Practising Infanticide, Observing Narrative 517 Clearly, this stands in direct opposition to Hrdy's central claim that bisexual langur groups are normally characterized by the presence of the single male, who is the only one who has the chance to breed. Recall that the existence of this single-male model is essential to the success of Hrdy's argument: if males share sexual access to females, then the hypo- thesized pressure to develop infanticidal strategies is eased. So Curtin and Dolhinow's review of the research record treats Hrdy's 'species-typical' social model as accurate only for those langur sites where human influence on the environment has been particularly strong, especially where this has resulted in overcrowding. It is only when troops lack space that 'male rivalry may produce new and maladaptive results' such as those seen at the infanticidal sites [Curtin &amp; Dolhinow, 1978: 471]. In this light, Curtin and Dolhinow go on to reinterpret Hrdy's account of the (now peculiar) langurs of Abu and the observations of infant attack at Dharwar and Jodhpur. They assert that the 'habitats at all three sites were greatly disturbed by human activities, and langur population densities were either absolutely or effectively extremely high', and they point out that the 'circumstances surrounding the disappearances of some forty infant langurs at these sites are known in varying degrees' [Curtin &amp; Dolhinow, 1978: 471]. That is to say, the sites are overcrowded, and there is a lack of clarity in defining what is to count as an infanticidal act. At Dharwar, only one attack by a male on an infant was observed, at Jodhpur only three were observed, and at Hrdy's site at Abu, where the 'events surrounding these dramatic levels of infant death remain somewhat obscure ... [o]nly the reports of casual bystanders linked male langurs to any infant deaths' [472]. Hrdy's 'local informants' have now become 'casual by- standers', and the status of their observations is discounted accordingly. Essentially, what is to count as observation has been recast, so as to exclude the testimony of non-professional observers.25 Curtin and Dolhinow go on to re-order the events of Hrdy's narrative. They challenge her presentation of cause and effect, and they provide their readers with a different cast of characters. In their narrative, the environ- ment now emerges as a key performer, profoundly affecting the outcome of the plot, despite its absence from Hrdy's account. In turn, they emphasize other absences in Hrdy's construction - the absence, for example, of professionally observed accounts of fatal male attacks on infants. In fact, they turn Hrdy's narrative around on itself, pointing out that an equally strong hypothesis could be built by reversing the model's connections. They accept that 'there is no question that males have definitely injured infants following some take-overs' but question 'whether infants are the targets of attack'. Perhaps the 'infant disappearances at Dharwar and Abu in fact may not have drastically altered female reproductive cycles' after all [Curtin &amp; Dolhinow, 1978: 472 (emphasis in original)]. Rather than the death of the infant bringing the mother to oestral receptivity, it is equally likely that the mother's sexual readiness, brought about by the appearance of a new male, may lead to the infant's accidental death in the excitement surrounding the act of mating. Finally, they suggest that Hrdy may have</page><page sequence="12">518 Social Studies of Science 31/4 fallen prey to hyperbole, in that 'langurs are credited with remarkable abilities' in this model of infanticide [473], since the mechanisms through which a male might recognize his offspring or deduce a rival's paternity are unclear. They conclude their discussion by stating unequivocally that the sexual selection model 'explains not the results of observation but the products of assumption', assumptions about whether the infant was deliber- ately killed, about which animal killed the infant, and about what effect the disappearance of the infant has on the maternal reproductive system [473]. The specificity of Hrdy's account is stressed, in that her one-male pattern 'has been observed only where langur population densities are high and where human influence on the ecology is immense' [474 (emphasis in original)]. Therefore, langur infanticide, where it exists, is not a natural fact of langur life, but an 'artefact' which has emerged as a result of human pressures on the local environment. Richard Curtin's 1977 paper makes a similar series of points in more detail for a smaller audience. His intent in this paper is to present a number of research strategies which will allow the research community to choose between the evolutionary or pathological explanation for this infant mortality. His text is accompanied by tables which attempt to compare evidence from the various langur research sites - for example, using categories such as 'Habitat and Human Influence', 'Home Range and Inter-Troop Relations', 'Evidence of Infanticide' and 'Eyewitness?' [Curtin, 1977: 28-29, 32].26These tabulations, he argues, will clearly demonstrate the existence of the two basic social patterns; patterns that may not be readily visible from an initial survey of the literature because of the nature of field research. The studies were carried out by different people, under different conditions, in different countries and at different periods. They need to be tabulated to facilitate comparison of the patterns, and Curtin has selected the variables that are significant to his preferred interpretation. In particular, he has emphasized the importance of human influence on the local environment. Like Hrdy in her American Scientist paper, Curtin ends his article by attempting to redefine the focus of research into langur infanticide. He calls for strategies which will combine 'long term observation and field and laboratory experiments', since it is only when these strategies are utilized that it will be possible to 'understand processes that occur over long time periods and to maximize opportunities of seeing rare, naturally occurring events' [Curtin, 1977: 34]. He notes that primatologists have attempted to use experimental designs in the field, but with varying degrees of success. Sugiyama tried to reproduce the conditions of a male take-over by remov- ing the resident male, but unfortunately 'the normal take-over pattern did not occur' and, although '[i]nfant injury and disappearance followed the experimental removal ... observers were unable to witness the actual events' [35]. However, Curtin raises hopes that eventually these techniques will be successfully refined. Essentially, he is attempting to recast the professional debate. He uses his tabulations to construct and textually demonstrate the existence of the two models of langur social organization.</page><page sequence="13">Rees: Practising Infanticide, Observing Narrative 519 He reveals his preference for the pathological rather than the adaptive explanation of infanticide through the use of words like 'attributed' or 'interpreted' when referring to the sexual selection model, and he insists that infanticide only occurs in sites disrupted by human influence. Finally, he tries, as Hrdy did, to move the debate along, this time by suggesting ways of moving beyond theory to empirical evidence. Professional Responses By the time of Curtin's 1977 publication, many other researchers had adopted Hrdy's model as a means of understanding their observational results, even to the extent of reinterpreting their previous observations. A number of reviews were published in specialized primate journals, popular science magazines and more general academic volumes.27 For example, in the same year that Curtin made his response public, W Angst and D. Thommen published a review of infant killing in Old World monkeys and apes in which they comment favourably on the competition model; interestingly, they account for the preponderance of theory over data in infanticide accounts by pointing out that 'extensive experiments on infant killing are ethically not justifiable'.28 Accordingly, it is acceptable to rely on the partial observations of naturally occurring field behaviour. Curtin's proposals for ending the controversy would not, it seems, be acceptable. Other, more specific, articles on particular populations of langurs (and other primate species) open with statements that stress the way in which infanticide is an evolutionary characteristic of langurs. S.M. Mohnot and his colleagues inform their readers that field studies of langurs 'have aroused special interest because of the documentation of male infanticides in this species ... [which] must be viewed from the perspective of their implications for the genetic fitness of the individuals concerned'.29 G. Agoramoorthy and S.M. Mohnot stress the number of species in which infanticide has occurred, the number of habitats in which langurs have been studied and the number of fieldworkers who have been involved in these studies.30 In the one case, the reader is being asked to take the genetic benefits of infanticide for granted; in the other, the sheer weight of observations is enough to create a climate of acceptance. If we step back from primatology and look at the first two editions of John Alcock's textbook, Animal Behaviour, a significant change has been made between 1975 and 1979. The first edition discusses the possibility that infanticide might be adaptive - but only in human beings, where it is an example of 'cutting an investment in reproduction earlier rather than later, thus saving energy for future attempts' [Alcock, 1975: 480].31 By 1979, there are three references to infanticide in the text, and the 'con- troversial case' of the langurs is mentioned in the first chapter [Alcock, 1979: 12]. While the book acknowledges that there is still room for debate over the interpretation of langur infanticide, it develops the competition hypothesis in detail and elaborates it as the ideal type of mammal infanticide.</page><page sequence="14">520 Social Studies of Science 31/4 In short, each of these accounts accepts the idea that infanticide probably functions as an adaptive part of primate social and genetic evolution. Most admit that there is a dearth of eyewitness accounts of deliberate killing of primate infants by males who are not their sires and who therefore have no stake in their continued survival. But each believes that the potential genetic advantage, which sociobiological theory predicts would be gained by primate males who kill unrelated infants, is large enough to make repeated, unequivocal observations of the event relatively irrelevant. Snatched observations, the descriptions of local people, and inferences from the context of infant disappearance are enough. Similarly, Sarah Hrdy's substantive 1979 review article deals with the existence and adaptive nature of infanticide as an established fact. Again, she tries to develop fresh research problems that could emerge from this new interpretation of infanticide. For example, she stresses that more 'field evidence on average birth spacing in different environments and under different conditions is needed to specify how much, in terms of repro- ductive effort by females, males gain from infanticide' [Hrdy, 1979: 18] .32 At the same time, she continues to emphasize that on a theoretical level males invariably benefit from infanticide. In particular, she refers to a computer simulation that suggests that 'the infanticidal trait, once evolved, should sweep through the population under those conditions' [19]. The article makes it plain that Hrdy is aware of the lack of empirical data. She acknowledges that 'much of the evidence on infanticide is based on isolated cases and on inferences derived from witnessed attacks which were followed by disappearances of infants' [Hrdy, 1979: 20], but empha- sizes that the observed conditions of most cases fit the male sexual selection hypothesis. Although most of the evidence comes from studies of hanuman langurs, she stresses that 'even from preliminary observations, it is apparent that male take-overs and infanticide occur in other colobines' [21].3 It may be, she suggests, that the highest levels of infanticide are found among the great apes. But most interestingly of all, her conclusion to this section takes the form of a question concerning the absence of reports of infanticide in baboons and macaques. She asks: 'What has countered selection pressure for infanticide in these species?' [23]. The absence of infanticide is now something that researchers need to question. Hrdy's conclusion, discussing as it does the impact of infanticidal traits on a population, tries to make the competition model even more impreg- nable by using it to explain some of the unanswered questions about human evolution. In a species under selection pressure for infanticide, females will in turn be under strong pressure to deceive males into thinking that they sired the infant in question. Female langurs, unlike other monkeys, do not show sexual swellings to demonstrate receptivity, but ovulate secretly. Hrdy points out that, because of this, '[fl emale langurs are then in a relatively good position (as are human females) to confuse the issue of paternity' [Hrdy, 1979: 33]. This brings her to two closely related issues of human evolution - why do women not advertise their ovulation through sexual signals in the way that our closest relatives the chimpanzees do?;</page><page sequence="15">Rees: Practising Infanticide, Observing Narrative 521 and why are women, unlike almost every other female primate, sexually receptive the whole year round? Anthropologists have explained the 'hidden' ovulation of women and their continuous sexual receptivity by citing a presumed need to maintain the pair bond with the male. In contrast, Hrdy argues that 'the strongest hypothesis to account for the emergence of continuous receptivity among primates is that it first evolved in social contexts where it was beneficial for females to confuse paternity, as in the case of infanticidal species' [34]. At this point, it would seem that the sexual selection model of infanticide is not limited to the explanation of an infrequent behaviour of a particular sub-population of langurs, but can be used to explain some of the most vexed questions of human evolution. The Wenner Gren Conference The supporters of the environment hypothesis were undaunted, however. Jane Boggess's article in Hausfater and Hrdy's 1984 textbook reiterated many of the points which were earlier made by Curtin and Dolhinow, and brought up new problems.34 In an earlier article, Boggess stressed that at least half of the examples of social change from Dharwar and Jodhpur 'cannot be termed "natural" social change ... [because] factors outside the troop had abruptly removed the adult males'.35 Infanticide therefore must be unnatural or maladaptive.36 In this later paper (1984), Boggess accepts that when Hrdy first presented her sexual selection model there were not enough long-term data available to refute it. Now, however, she argues that there are many studies from other areas of India and Nepal that have gathered no data on infant killing or on the type of rapid male social changes which have characterized Dharwar, Abu and Jodphur. She criticizes most of the other works that had been published on infanticide in langurs, not least because these new accounts frequently were not based on novel field observations or studies: rather, they were reinterpretations of old data in light of the new theory. As far as Curtin's proposals for testing the two different models is concerned, Boggess accepts that the testing of hypotheses concerning infanticide in primates is 'difficult if not presently impossible', but points out that, of all the theories, sexual selection is probably the easiest to examine because of the relatively precise predictions it makes.37 However, she again asserts that the kind of data that would be necessary to test it has not yet been collected - and crucially, the constraints of field-site research are partly to blame. There is a lack of long-term continuous studies on this species that would allow the observer to know with more certainty which male had fathered the infant,38 and that would increase the observer's chances of being able to see for themselves which male was responsible for the infant's death, and under what circumstances. Hrdy replied to this attack by accusing Boggess of maintaining a double standard when it came to evaluating the two models. She com- plained that the 'criteria for accepting negative evidence appears to be far less stringent than the criteria applied to data that support the sexual</page><page sequence="16">522 Social Studies of Science 31/4 selection model' and, while agreeing that 'scepticism is especially timely in the current climate of enthusiastic and occasionally overly credulous acceptance of any theory with a logical evolutionary ring to it', points out that 'it would not have occurred to [her] a few years ago to make the distinction that Boggess does between killing an infant and inflicting life threatening wounds'.39 Hrdy's conclusion, in 1984, sounds surprisingly similar to that of Curtin in 1977: [W]hat researchers see is affected by their expectation about the natural world and the way that biological and social systems 'ought' to work.40 At this point, it is interesting to note that, 10 years after the publication of Hrdy's original article on infanticide, writers in Hausfater and Hrdy's text cite that article as a crucial element in primatology's development as an independent scientific discipline. Hausfater argues that zoologists had initially dismissed the significance of infanticidal acts within the animal kingdom; however, as a direct result of Hrdy's 1974 article, this important category of behaviour came to be more generally recognized by researchers interested in animal behaviour. In this way, primatology's relation to the older and more established scientific disciplines matured; whilst initially theories and concepts were created by zoologists and picked up by primatologists, in the case of infanticide 'the flow of ideas and issues has been almost precisely the opposite'.4' Hausfater takes this argument a step further. He goes on to wonder if primatology's 'disciplinary schizophrenia' may have been superseded by the development and success of this new, powerful, evolutionary research paradigm.42 His proposal is that primato- logists trained in different research traditions will eventually learn to reject them in favour of this novel scheme for explaining social behaviour by reference to individual reproductive success. Sociobiology will provide the inspiration for the unification of primatology. So what we can see, a decade after the publication of the initial article, is a situation in which it is suggested that the development of an explanation for a (possibly) rare example of the behaviour of a species of Indian monkey is cited as one of the key elements in the disciplinary epiphany of behavioural primatology. The claim is made that the academic independence of primatology depends on the success of an evolutionary explanation of infanticide. In addition, the disciplinary unity as well as the independence of primatology is allowed to rest on the acceptance of the sociobiological explanation for langur infanticide. After the publication of the 1984 textbook, the debate surrounding langur infanticide subsided. However, this does not mean that adaptive explanations for infanticide died out; indeed, the sexual selection hypo- thesis is frequently used to explain the occurrence of infanticide in other animal species - for example, the Carnivores.43 Since the mid-1980s, reports of deliberate, adaptive infanticide among primates have been sporadic and infrequently cited - as have been reports of pathological infanticide. As an indication of the unresolved character of the debate, Alcock's discussion of the meaning of 'scientific testing' in the last edition</page><page sequence="17">Rees: Practising Infanticide, Observing Narrative 523 of his textbook uses the infanticide debate as an example of the different ways in which a researcher can interpret a phenomenon [Alcock, 1998: 1-23]. His discussion, while published in 1998, deals solely with the accounts given in the textbook that Hausfater and Hrdy published 14 years earlier. It would seem that this particular scientific controversy had ended at that point as a result of a general disinclination to engage in debate, rather than any decisive conclusions as to the applicability of the hypothesis. Commentary In a sense, there is no real disagreement about the events of this con- troversy. All of the participants agreed, and continue to agree, that langur males were observed to make attacks on infants of their own species that could potentially be fatal. The controversy itself turned on the inter- pretation that was given to this event, and on the question of which accounts were to be given the status of observations. Hayden White's argument about the nature of historical narrative is relevant here.44 White suggests that historical narrative has a problem: it is supposed to be an accurate description of past events, and therefore it cannot be subject to scientific tests of either the experimental or the observational type. His analysis of the historical text as literary narrative applies also to the scientific texts that made up the core of the infanticide controversy. White points out that the character of explanation is determined more by what we exclude than by what we put in, that certain events are privileged in our minds by having causatory or explanatory force attributed to them through the development of the narrative, and the narrative is the weft that weaves the reported events into what White refers to as 'pre-generic plot struc- tures'.45 Within the infanticide controversy, each participant had access to the same series of reported events, but each filtered these events through and into what their experience had taught them to consider 'relevant' - one set creating a narrative which related the events to the structure of evolution; the other, a narrative that led them back to the role of the environment and humanity's impact on 'the natural world'. As a result of this, the issue of trust became extremely significant in the interpretation of events that were reported from these distant sites. Both the audience and the participants had to make judgements about whose observations they would trust, and the conditions that needed to be satisfied before a clear-cut case of sexually selected infanticide could be certified. Were attacks on infants incidental to mating, or deliberately contrived so that mating could take place? Were langur troops to be considered closed breeding groups, or were the accounts of a more fluid social system to be taken as species-typical? What changes needed to be introduced by humans to the local environment before it could be con- sidered degraded? The controversy turned on the interpretation of observa- tion, certainly, but the question of what was to count as accurate observation was also raised at times.</page><page sequence="18">524 Social Studies of Science 31/4 Hrdy's work was dense with details of langur life, but lacked observa- tions of fatal attacks by langur males. She made use of amateur observations, eyewitness accounts by people who had happened to be at the right place at the right time, and she linked those accounts to her own notes through her cyclical narrative of langur troop history. She created a sense of pro- gressive coherence as she organized her (logically strong but empirically weak) competition-based account of langur life back into the distant past, while at the same time using it to cover an ever-widening range of the primate species. In tandem with this, she focused her account of langur social life on her 'one-male' pattern, ignoring the accounts of langur troops which were not closed breeding systems, accounts which had been pro- vided by her predecessors whom she dismissed as overly influenced by then-current social theory. As she ignored her predecessors, she tried to set the agenda for her successors, providing two different paths down which research could proceed. New students could examine female counter- infanticide strategies, or they could explain the absence of reported infanticide in other primate species. Finally, her work on infanticide was cited as the driving force behind the independence of primatology as a scientific discipline, and the theoretical consequences of that work were tied into the story of what made humans human: hidden ovulation and continuous sexual receptivity (two points that make human females unique among the primates) had evolved as a counter-strategy to male infanticide. Clearly, Hrdy and her supporters did their best to link her model of sexually selected infanticide to as many significant developments and arenas as they could. Other langur researchers responded by insisting on re-opening the black boxes that Hrdy and others had attempted to seal. They rejected the dominance of the 'one-male' pattern, and tried to demonstrate the exist- ence of two major patterns of langur social organization by constructing summative textual tabulations. They discarded Hrdy's attempt to define the work carried out at her site as species-typical for langurs, re-introducing the environment as a major element in the narrative, an environment forced into prominence by the activities of human beings. The degradation of the territory and the space available for langur troops created the conditions for violent attacks on infant langurs. These animals, they suggested, were not 'wild-living' in any pure sense - they lived next to towns, and were harassed by humans and domestic dogs [Curtin, 1977: 28-29], and so their behaviour could not be natural or typical of langurs. Finally, they reversed the order of cause and effect in Hrdy's narrative, arguing that it was at least as possible that infants were accidentally killed in the excitement surrounding mating as that they were deliberately killed in order to enable that mating. But rather than move the debate on to new topics, both Curtin and Boggess called for empirical tests of the adaptive infanticide hypothesis, tests that were not carried out. Of course, by calling for their opponents to demonstrate the accuracy of their model experimentally in a situation where such testing could not easily happen, Curtin and Boggess were also able to place their opponents in a situation</page><page sequence="19">Rees: Practising Infanticide, Observing Narrative 525 where it looked as if they were loath to make tests that might demonstrate the inaccuracy of the sexual selection model. Testing of the kind that Curtin and Boggess suggested could not reasonably take place within the field environment. Both sides in the controversy were theoretically and methodologically committed to the idea that they were observing and reporting on the 'natural' behaviour of langur troops. This commitment is evidenced by their concern to provide a definition of the typical langur troop that would be widely accepted as accurate. For example, while proponents of the competition model focused on one definition of the 'natural' langur, opponents insisted that this type of social pattern represented an aberration in the langur's evolutionary history, an aberration caused by human impact on the local ecology. In either case, the authority of observations stemmed from an ability to attach the words 'natural' or 'typical' to descriptions. This authority would have been damaged by any attempt to control or to alter experimentally the behaviour of the animals under observation. Curtin and Boggess both described ways in which the competition model might have been tested in the field, and claimed that theoretically the adaptive theory should have been the easiest explanatory model to test, but the constraints of field-site science made this impossible. Not only was it the case that a high value was placed on being able to observe the unaffected behaviour of the primates under observation, but research proposals that involved the necessary death of infants in an endangered species were unlikely to receive research funding.46 In fact, where an attempt had been made in the early years of research to alter the social condition of langurs, the results had been less than satisfactory and the observers had, once again, been unable to watch the consequences of their action.47 To reiterate, within the field environ- ment, researchers were not in control of the behaviour of the animals, and hence even when they were willing to intervene overtly in the lives of their subjects, they still could not ensure that the 'interesting' actions would take place where they could readily be seen. It is for this reason that both sides in the controversy called for the funding of more long-term studies. Crucially, it is also for this reason that the controversy has not yet reached closure. Frequently, controversies end when one side or another fails to get their funding renewed.48 However, the rarity of an infanticidal act meant that for the majority of those involved, infanticide reports were incidental to their reasons for being in the field. This also meant that observations of infant deaths or disappearances could readily be explained later by reference to the adaptive theory of infanticide. The more long-term studies there are, the greater the chances of observing this rare event, and the better the likelihood of knowing the genetic relation between the members of a given troop. However, long-term studies are no longer popular among funding agencies; most researchers tend to get funding for only a few field seasons at a time. For this reason, the contro- versy faded from public view without ever having reached resolution. As I suggested above, this does not mean that adaptive explanations for infanticide have died out: for other species, the idea that males have</page><page sequence="20">526 Social Studies of Science 31/4 been sexually selected to carry out infanticidal acts seems relatively un- problematic. However, in the case of primatology, the matter seems to have largely rested. The non-closure of the debate can be seen in the way in which the controversy could be used in ethology textbooks to demonstrate the role of interpretation in the making of observation.49 Conclusion As this paper acknowledged at the outset, controversy studies have been a wonderful resource for the sociology and the history of science. The interest in science as practice, as a series of situated actions (including the acts of thinking and of writing) has tremendously enriched our under- standing of the ways in which scientists understand, construct, apprehend and agree upon the natural world. But controversy studies have over- whelmingly focused on the ways in which action is made meaningful within the setting of the laboratory, even where it is acknowledged that meaning only becomes significant when it is translated to the world outside the laboratory walls. Controversy within the fieldwork sciences can be experi- enced in very different ways. Participants in this controversy, for example, could not reliably look to the creation of new empirical data to sustain or to refute their positions. They had taken up their positions as observers of the world of free-living wild primates, as eyewitnesses of animals behaving naturally and, as such, they could not easily decide to intervene in the lives of their research subjects in order to produce the data they needed. The idea of experiment functioned as a conceptual resource for at least some of the participants, but it was not relevant in the way in which it was ordinarily understood. While it was possible for researchers to discuss the possibility of ending the debate by resorting to experimental manipulation, and while the idea of replication remained implicit in the discussion through the attempt to tabulate and to compare the various studies and sites at which potentially infanticidal acts had been observed, these notions of experiment and replication, so central to laboratory studies of controversy, did not have major roles to play in the debate. We can begin to see another way in which the infanticide controversy can be made meaningful to the literature on scientific controversies. A decade ago, Harry Collins and Steven Yearley published their critique of Bruno Latour and Michel Callon's actor-network theory,50 pointing out that the attempt to establish non-human actants as intentional agents within scientific debates ran the risk of abolishing David Bloor's principles of impartiality and symmetry. Allowing non-humans a voice meant that people might forget that these non-humans are not speaking for them- selves, but are being spoken for. But as Andy Pickering pointed out, it is possible to draw a line between intentionality and agency, and to acknowl- edge that degrees of the latter are possible.5' In this case, while researchers clearly continued to speak for the non-human actants, it is equally clear that the major limiting resource for the development and non-resolution of</page><page sequence="21">Rees: Practising Infanticide, Observing Narrative 527 this controversy was the actions of the subjects of research, the non-human primates themselves. The controversy was one of observation and inter- pretation, but the researchers could only discuss what the langurs had possibly been seen, or not seen, to do. That is to say, the debate was bound by observations it was possible to make, or accept, and it was for this reason that participants found themselves dealing with questions about the theory-laden nature of behavioural observations. In particular, they faced the issue of what exactly one should do with incomplete or indirect observations of behaviour, especially when the behaviour is both unusual and interesting. In this light, one could argue that the most significant aspect of the infanticide debate seemed to centre on what could be called the shifting category of 'the natural' behavioural repertoire of non-human primates. Those who supported the competition hypothesis insisted that infanticide was part of the 'natural' behavioural repertoire of non-human primates. Those who opposed it argued that it was an 'unnatural' artefact produced by the human impact on the 'natural' environment, and contrasted it to the 'normal' behaviour which they observed at their own study sites. Through their use of the textual strategies identified in this paper, they tried to persuade the rest of the primatological and ethological communities of the accuracy of their characterization. Is it possible to suggest that primato- logists themselves were struggling with the problem of categorizing human and non-human agency? Given that great importance is attached to observing representative behaviour when conducting ethological field studies, the fact that both parties tried to lay claim to the moral high ground of 'the natural' is not surprising. But it appears to have been impossible for researchers to reach agreement on the characteristics of 'nature' and 'natural' behaviour, particularly for a species that we know to have been closely associated with humans for over a thousand years. Various studies of the rhetoric of science have demonstrated the way in which ordinary words can implicitly move important cultural values into the heart of scientific debate.52 Donna Haraway's work has shown how permeable is the boundary between nature and culture when one examines the activities of the non-human primates and their observers.53 In this paper, I have tried to indicate some of the ways in which this particular, local example of controversy within a field- based science has been affected by the shifting appreciations of what constitutes nature, and what constitutes human interference. In analysing one of the narratives of natural history, my own narrative is necessarily partial - but I hope that it has at least indicated that the observational, field-based sciences are different from those with which controversy studies have usually dealt. The expansion of controversy studies to include field-based scientific debates is needed, not just for the academic reasons I have outlined in this paper, but also because of the question of how to envision humanity as part of the natural world. For example, the idea that it is possible to examine human nature independently of human culture has a long and pervasive</page><page sequence="22">528 Social Studies of Science 31/4 history. While researchers once turned to primitive peoples in order to discover what humans were like before civilization, now increasingly people turn to examples of animal behaviour, particularly the behaviour of monkeys and apes. Just as sociologists of science have demonstrated the way in which science is socially constructed through laboratory contro- versy, there is now a need to perform a similar service for field-based studies. This is important - not least because of the significance of such potentially controversial stories about non-human primates to the attempts to develop a natural history of humanity.

It may be worth clarifying this point. No one questioned that adult male primates sometimes killed infant members of their own species. The controversy turned on the issue of whether these infant deaths were the result of a situation in which adult males had been selected to specifically target the offspring of other males in order to increase their own reproductive success at the expense of another. 10.

Jane Boggess, 'Infant Killing and Male Reproductive Strategies in Langurs (Presbytis entellus)', in Hausfater &amp; Hrdy (eds), op. cit. note 13, 283-310. It is worth noting that this oppositional article was still included in a text intended to display the normality of infanticide in the natural world (ibid., xi-xii). In fact, the section dealing with the non- human primates was introduced with the subtitle that acknowledged the ongoing controversy ('ATopic of Continuing Debate', 145). However, it is also notable that Boggess's article came after seven chapters describing infanticidal attacks in a number of monkey and ape species, and was immediately followed by two pieces written by Sugiyama and Hrdy with the subtitles 'A Reply to Boggess': Yoshima Sugiyama, 'Proximate Factors of Infanticide among Langurs at Dharwar: A Reply to Boggess', in Hausfater &amp; Hrdy (eds), op. cit. note 13, 311-14; Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, 'Assumptions and Evidence Regarding the Sexual Selection Hypothesis: A Reply to Boggess', ibid., 315-19. 35. Jane Boggess, 'Troop Male Membership Changes and Infant Killings in Langurs (Presbytis entellus)', Folia Primatologica, Vol. 32 (1979), 64-107, at 87. 36. Of course, one could argue that infanticide was an adaptive response to overpopulation and stress, but Boggess is stressing proximate rather than ultimate causes here. 37. Boggess, op. cit. note 34, 303. 38. It should not be forgotten that while it is usually clear which animal gives birth to the infant, determining the father is dependent on the existence of detailed mating observations - and it is obviously impossible to be sure that all mating events have been recorded in a situation where animals are free to roam at will.</page><page sequence="25">Rees: Practising Infanticide, Observing Narrative 531 39. Quotations from Hrdy, 'Reply', op. cit. note 34, respectively at 317, 315 and 319. This distinction is important to Boggess as a means of emphasizing the fact that adult males had not been seen to kill infants, only to attack them, and that therefore the assertion that a particular male was responsible for a particular dead infant had to remain a presumption. It was still possible that the death of the infant was due to other causes. 40. Ibid., 319. 41.

The phrase 'disciplinary schizophrenia' refers to the fact that primatologists have been drawn from a number of different research traditions, including psychology, zoology, anthropology, biology and even sociology, and that this has hindered the development of intra-disciplinary co-operation in the development of primatological theory and methodology. 43.

A recently published book on infanticide, which may awaken the debate within primatology, is Carel van Schaik and Charles Janson, Infanticide By Males and its Implications (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000). Interestingly, the web advertising for this text includes the following statement and question: 'Infanticide by males is relatively common . . . although it tends to be rare even in species where it occurs. Is this behaviour pathological or accidental, or does it reflect a conditional reproductive strategy for males in certain circumstances?' &lt; http:llwww.cup.org &gt; . 50. H.M.

An example of this can be found in Roger Smith, Inhibition: History and Meaning in the Sciences of Mind and Brain (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1992), where Smith discusses the way in which practitioners found it impossible to use the term 'inhibition' in a professionally specific way without also implying the word's more general public meaning.

Martin and Robert Veel (eds), Reading Science: Critical and Functional Perspectives on Discourses of Science (London &amp; New York: Routledge, 1998). 53. Haraway, opera cit. note 4. Amanda Rees is a Lecturer in Sociology at the University of York. Her main research interests are in the sociology and history of science, and her PhD (obtained from Cambridge University in July 1999) explored the nature of field-based scientific research in primatology. Currently, she is working on popular science and public understandings of science in relation to animal models of human experiences.
