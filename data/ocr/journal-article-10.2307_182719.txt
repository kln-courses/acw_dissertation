I994 Cambridge University Press EARLY METAL WORKING IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA: A REVIEW OF RECENT RESEARCH* BY DUNCAN E. MILLER AND NIKOLAAS J. VAN DER MERWE University of Cape Town T HIS paper is a review of the course of research during the past decade into the history of indigenous metal working in sub-Saharan Africa. It comprises three sections: a summary of the chronology of early metallurgy and the spread of metal working; a description of African metal working in terms of mining, smelting and smithing, with particular emphasis on recent inter- pretations of the iron-smelting technology; and a conclusion summarizing the main developments and some lines of future enquiry. A glossary of technical terms used in this paper is appended. In the first half of this century writing on African indigenous metallurgy was dominated by discussion of the possible role of Egypt in the advent of iron metallurgy in the old world and ethnographic accounts of smelting practice.' With the burgeoning of African Iron Age archaeology in the I96os more intense interest developed in the economic role of metals production in food producing and trading societies.2 Despite pioneering metallurgical analysis of southern African and Egyptian metal artefacts3 technical studies of the products of African metallurgy remained rare until the I98os, when the pace of publication on all aspects of African metal working increased dramatically. A major development during the past decade has been the * Financial support from the Foundation for Research Development, CSIR (South Africa) and from Anglo-American De Beers Chairman's Fund Educational Trust is acknowledged gratefully.

Deciphering the appearance and development of metal-working tech- nology in Africa has been a background to two interrelated strands of inquiry.6 One is concerned with the social, cultural, economic and en- vironmental aspects of the introduction and practice of metallurgy.7 The other describes the chronology, technology and mechanisms of indigenous metals production itself.8 Here we deal primarily with the second topic and of recent African iron-smelting practice to reconstructions of prehistoric smelting technology', MASCA Research Papers in Science and Technology, viii (I) (I99I), 47-54. 6 N.

VAN DER MERWE have restricted this discussion to the archaeology of the physical aspects of metals production.9 This includes the chronology of smelting in Africa, the process of smelting itself and the practice of forging or smithing. The intensification of research in the past I 2 years is due partly to the fact that African metal working reflects aspects of past technological and social organization central to current issues in African history.10 With the realiza- tion that all living memory of indigenous smelting is vanishing rapidly with the demise of the last of its former practitioners, there has been a vigorous attempt to record as much of this ethnographic information as possible, both in print and on film.11 Until the middle of the past decade a number of researchers emphasized the apparently unique or advanced nature of many indigenous African metal- working practices.12 With recent more rigorous re-evaluation there has been a reduction in emphasis of African technological primacy or uniqueness. This is evident in critical reviews of earlier claims of anomalously early or superior African metal working technology.13 With these more recent developments we are rescued from a proliferation P.

Processes conventionally described as forging have been shown to be an integral part of indigenous metals production.16 Nevertheless, the study of forging or smithing practice generally has been neglected in favour of studying the smelting process. Undoubtedly, the near-indestructibility of smelting slags has contributed to this situation but, as was pointed out by Stanley in I929, so has the understandable reluctance of curators to submit metal artefacts for destructive metallographic analysis.17 The sporadic publication of isolated analyses or the analysis of very small collections of artefacts has been the norm for the past fifty years. This situation has changed only recently, with the analysis of large assemblages from Zaire18 and Botswana."9 CHRONOLOGY OF EARLY METALLURGY IN AFRICA The radiocarbon-dated chronology of sub-Saharan prehistory is summarized conveniently in the lists of radiocarbon dates and their associated comments published intermittently in the Journal of African History.20 Other sub- 'Comparative perspective'; D.

The social turbulence of Egypt during the first half of the first millennium B.C. led to the widespread adoption of iron by the middle of the millennium, possibly stimulated by the invasion of the Assyrians, whose army was well equipped with iron, and by the Mediterranean mercenary settlements present in northern Egypt.33 By this time metallurgy was being practised in West Africa. Egypt does not appear to have had a direct formative influence on the advent of metallurgy elsewhere in Africa other than at Meroe.34 Copper and iron metallurgy seem to have appeared together in sub- Saharan Africa without a prior period of copper and bronze manufacture.35 The lack of any persuasive evidence for copper metallurgy in sub-Saharan Africa before the advent of iron working in the region implies the sim- ultaneous introduction of copper and iron smelting technology.36 During the past decade the discovery of structures interpreted as furnaces, found in the 25 R.

E. MILLER AND N. J. VAN DER MERWE Agadez region of Niger and dating to the late second and early third millennium B.C.,37 fueled speculation about an 'Early Copper Age' in North Africa.38 The interpretation of these structures and their associated radio- carbon dates has been reassessed in detail recently, with the telling conclusion that there is no substantial evidence of smelting activity before IOOO B.C. at Agadez.39 Some of the fused materials formerly identified as slags transpired to be vitrified soil. At least one of the assumed furnace structures was probably a burnt-out tree stump used two millennia later for iron smelting, and the possible use of 'old wood'40 may be responsible for the very early radiocarbon dates for smelting at Agadez.4" This latter source of potential error should be stressed, because it is relevant to the interpretation of all the charcoal radiocarbon dates used to construct the chronology of the in- troduction of metal working to Africa. In the future, the routine sampling of ceramic furnace materials for thermoluminescence dating may help to corroborate the more precise but not necessarily more accurate radiocarbon dates in studies of smelting technology.42 The independent discovery of iron smelting in sub-Saharan Africa has been postulated in a number of contexts.43 Nevertheless, the autochthonous development of iron smelting in central West Africa from a hypothetical earlier phase of copper smelting does not appear to be supported by the available archaeological evidence." In the light of the reassessment of evidence for very early smelting in Agadez45 it is reasonable to believe that the knowledge of metal working was introduced to sub-Saharan Africa from outside, despite the paucity of archaeological evidence in those areas that might have acted as conduits for the spread of this technological knowledge.46 Several possible routes have been suggested for the diffusion of metal-working technology to sub-Saharan Africa, based on geographical feasibility and classical references. The first is south and west from the Kushitic capital of Meroe on the Nile; the second is across the Sahara desert from the Gulf of Sirte in modern Libya to Gao 37 Calvocoressi and David, 'New survey'; Sutton, 'Archaeology'; R.

About 6oo km to the south, at the site of Debbat El Eheima on the White Nile, iron points have been dated by association with charcoal to the ninth or eighth century B.C., several centuries earlier than the earliest signs of iron working at Meroe.53 The iron smelting technology at Meroe relates to Egyptian and Roman technology and appears to have no bearing on the development of metallurgy in West or East Africa.54 At Akjoujt in western Mauritania there is evidence for large-scale copper smelting beginning in about the sixth century B.c.55 Iron smelting appears to have been practised contemporaneously at Do Dimmi and at Agadez in Niger,56 and the oldest iron-smelting furnaces of Taruga and Nsukka in Nigeria57 have been dated to approximately the sixth century B.C.58 The 'old wood' problem59 makes it impossible to know with certainty that the wood used to date any particular smelting furnace is contemporary with that furnace.

E. MILLER AND N. J. VAN DER MERWE carbon dating, militates against the clear resolution of the possible routes of introduction and the chronological sequence of the development of smelting technology. This is true even in West Africa, which has a fair number of sites with early dates for metal working.60 It is evident that on the basis of the available chronological evidence the introduction of copper smelting and iron smelting to West Africa cannot be distinguished. Copper and iron working were probably introduced sim- ultaneously to West Africa in the middle of the first millennium B.C., and along the same, but possibly multiple, routes from North Africa.6" The introduction of iron working has often been linked to the advent of agriculture. In West Africa the transition from Stone Age subsistence strategies to economies depending on iron has been recorded in the archaeological sequence between the mid first millennium B.C. and early first millennium A.D. at a number of sites: Daboya in northern Ghana and at Jenne-jeno in Mali,62 at Atwetwebooso in Ghana and at Daima in Nigeria.63 Nevertheless, at others, like the shell mound at N'Gaty in Ivory Coast, the introduction of iron does not appear to have led to major changes in subsistence economy.64 Evidently the economic and social impacts of the introduction of metals were not uniform in West Africa or, by implication, anywhere else in Africa. This is a potentially rich topic for further archaeological research. The cultural relationship between West and East Africa during the second half of the first millennium B.C. is obscure, but the spread of iron metallurgy, by whatever routes, to encompass the whole of western, central and eastern Africa must have taken place rapidly during the final centuries of the first millennium B.c.65 Dates associated with the earliest phase of iron smelting in Gabon lie between the seventh and first centuries B.C. with the most probable date for the inception of iron smelting being the second to third century B.c.67 This precedes the first reliable occurrences of iron smelting in the East African Interlacustrine Region. Despite the acknowledged archaeological obscurity of events in Central Africa during the late first millennium B.C., it is difficult to reconcile these relatively early dates in Gabon with the suggestion that 60 McIntosh and McIntosh, 'Stone to metal'; Kense, 'Initial diffusion'. 61 Tylecote, History; van der Merwe, 'Advent'; J.

The unqualified use of 'bricks' implies their intentional manufacture for furnace construction,70 rather than their being by-products which may have be re- used incidentally.7') Anomalously early dates ranging from late second millennium to mid-first millennium B.C. have also been reported for iron smelting sites in Rwanda and Burundi,72 but these may represent a forest fire stratum or the use of old wood.73 At present, claims for the seventh-century B.C. appearance of iron technology in the Interlacustrine Region74 appear to be unsupported. The evidence for early iron smelting in East Africa also dates from the close of the first millennium B.C.75 Iron artefacts were found associated with the floor of a house dated to about 200 B.C.,76 and a cluster of radiocarbon dates ranging from the first to the sixth centuries A.D. was associated with smelting furnaces at the sites of KM2 and KM3 in Tanzania.77 A furnace from Nkese in north-eastern Tanzania dated to between the first and the third centuries A.D.,78 and evidence of the earliest known iron production on the East African coast has been dated to between the first and the fourth centuries A.D.79 These dates concur with those of Matola tradition settlements located further south in Mocambique80 and attest to the rapid southward spread of Iron Age peoples on the east coast of Africa. 68 Digombe et al., 'Gabon', i i. 69 F. van Noten, 'The Early Iron Age in the Interlacustrine region: the diffusion of iron technology', Azania, XIV (I979), 6i-8o; F. van Noten, 'Ancient and modern iron smelting in Central Africa: Zaire, Rwanda and Burundi', in Haaland and Shinnie (eds.), African Iron Working, I02-20; J.

VAN DER MERWE The Early Iron Age archaeology of the Zaire basin and Central Africa proper is poorly understood, but the first Early Iron Age sites in the region appear to date from the fourth to first centuries B.c.81 The most recent summary of Early Iron Age archaeology of the West Central African region is that of Denbow.82 The introduction of iron at Tchissanga East on the coast of Congo has been dated to the early fourth century B.C. This early appearance of iron is succeeded at the nearby sites of Tandou-Youmbi, Meningue and Madingo-Kayes by mid-second-century B.C. to early third- century A.D. dates associated with ceramics distinct from Tchissanga East and with a more extensive metals assemblage. The ceramics from these and related sites appear to have similarities to those from the reportedly mid- second-century A.D. site of Benfica south of Luanda, possibly indicating a western origin for the southern African Early Iron Age. This proposition is strengthened by the fact that the ceramics and metal artefacts from the Early Iron Age site of Divuyu in the Tsodilo Hills west of the Okavango swamps in Botswana also appear to relate to those from the sites further north.83 Dates for the first appearance of Early Iron Age peoples in eastern Southern Africa range from the second to the third centuries A.D. at Matola, Enkwazini, Mzonjani, Silver Leaves and Eiland.84 The site of Zitundo on the southern border of Mocambique has large quantities of slag and tuyere fragments dating to the late second century A.D.85 Although iron smelting in the form of slag is clearly associated with the Matola tradition from the coast of Mocambique,86 the earliest known preserved metals in southern Africa are from the fifth-century A.D. site of Broederstroom in the Transvaal87 and from Divuyu in the Tsodilo Hills, with a range of dates from A.D. 550 to A.D. 730.88 Copper and iron beads have been found at Mabveni in Zimbabwe and may date to the second century A.D.,89 but two of the three dates from Mabveni are late sixth-century A.D.90 and the dating of this metal work is thus insecure. Trying to trace the detailed course of the spread of metal working through Africa from radiocarbon dates is frustrated by a number of systematic and interpretational problems. The possible use of old wood or ancient charcoal for smelting, or the contamination of archaeological samples with charcoal produced in forest fires, compound the interpretational problem of validating the archaeological association in the case of smelting furnaces and metal artefacts dated by contiguous charcoal. The systematic imprecision of radiocarbon dating often produces wide probability ranges for individual dates, and resolving the first occurrence of a phenomenon is not aided by calculating weighted averages where a number of supposedly related dates are available. The correlation of dates from different sites and regions is compromised by the uneven application of calibration, which can also alter any particular radiocarbon date and its standard deviation considerably. 81 Kense, 'Initial diffusion'; J.

The problem of the unavoidably poor resolution of radiocarbon dates has been discussed recently with a graphic illustration of the 'stunning imprecision of calibrated dates for early metallurgy in West Africa' and the conclusion that 'it is high time that the focus of early iron research ... shifted from when and where iron first appeared to how and why it spread and subsequently developed'."9 A broad trend is obvious though, with dates in the middle of the first millennium B.C. for the appearance of copper and iron working in Sahelian West Africa; the spread of metal working during the last centuries B.C. to encompass the whole of West Central Africa, the Interlacustrine Region and the East African coast; and the subsequent passage of metal working southward by eastern and western coastal routes to appear in Botswana, the northern Transvaal and Natal by the middle of the first millennium A.D. The paths travelled are no doubt ramified and complex,92 and considerably more work is required to establish a reliable detailed chronology. The necessary resolution will not be achieved with radiocarbon dating alone, and an increasing emphasis will have to be placed on thermoluminescence dating and ceramic typology to resolve cultural change.93 AFRICAN METAL WORKING TECHNOLOGY Mining It is not possible to present a detailed chronology of indigenous mining because not enough studies of African mining have been carried out to allow one to construct such a history. Nevertheless, there are numerous records of indigenous mining in Africa; indeed in southern Africa early European prospectors found that nearly every viable outcrop of gold- or copper-bearing rock had been exploited in the past.94 The earliest indigenous mining was probably for minerals used in cosmetics and body paint, including galena, malachite,95 pyrolusite, ochre, and specularite.9f Some of the southern African pigment mines have very early dates of about 40,000 B.C.,97 but the 91 McIntosh and McIntosh, 'Stone to metal', I07. 92 van der Merwe, 'Advent'; Kense, 'Initial diffusion'. 93 McIntosh and McIntosh, 'Stone to metal'. 9' R.

E. MILLER AND N. J. VAN DER MERWE dating is based on charcoal found lying on worked floors and has not been accepted universally.98 Not surprisingly the earliest available dates for mining with metallurgical intent are from West Africa, where there are indications that copper mining at Akjoujt began in the first millennium B.C.99 The onset of copper extraction at Agadez was roughly contemporaneous.100 The two other locations of extensive indigenous copper mining in North Africa, at Nioro-Siracoro in northern Mali and at Hufrat en-Nahas in the Sudan do not appear to have been dated.101 Historical records attest to the pre-colonial exploitation of the copper deposits of Niari in the Congo Republic, at Bembe and Benguela in Angola102 and at Tsumeb in Namibia, where supposedly 'Bushman' miners traded copper ore to the local Ovambo.103 At the time of the first European settlement at the Cape of Good Hope, the local indigenes traded copper, brass, and iron from the Dutch and the English.104 But in i66i the quantity of copper evident in the first contact with the Little Namaqua north of the colony was a surprise. Pieter van Meerhoff reported to the Cape governor Van Riebeeck: Their dress consists of all kind of beautifully prepared skins ... gorgeously ornamented with copper beads ... Their locks they thread with copper beads, covering their heads all over. Around their necks they have chains, slung round them fifteen or sixteen times. Many have round copper plates suspended from these chains. On their arms they have chains of copper and iron beads which go round their bodies thirty or forty times ... their legs are encased in plaited skins, ornamented with beads ... Their only industry is working in copper and iron, from which they make very neat beads and chains.105 It is unlikely that this represented material bartered from the Cape, because rumours of a 'copper mountain' in Namaqualand were borne out by Simon van der Stel's expedition of I685. No unequivocal evidence of indigenous mining or smelting is recorded from the area, although indications of pre- European mining in the Richtersveld have been reported anecdotally by the prospector Cornell.106 The situation in Namaqualand is archaeologically anomalous because almost all other major copper-producing areas in central Southern Africa have clear evidence of early exploitation.107 Mining and smelting rubble at Kansanshi, only one of a large number of prehistorically worked copper 98 R.

Malachite ore was transported about a kilometre to smelters operated by three successive cultural groups distinguished on the basis of distinctive pottery.109 Further records of copper mining in Central Africa have been summarized comprehensively by Herbert.110 The record of early copper mining in Zimbabwe, eastern Botswana and the Transvaal is particularly rich.

The mining was done by hand using stone hammers and iron gads. There is no archaeological evidence for mechanical aids for hoisting ore, and this must have been done manually, presumably in baskets. Wooden ladders and pit props have been found in situ in some workings, and charcoal attests to the use of fire-setting to break rock from the face or to produce updraughts for ventilation.120 It has been argued that these mining techniques relate to Indian mining practice121 but in reality their similarities simply reflect the geological constraints imposed on the ap- plication of a rudimentary mining technology. The southern African records of indigenous copper mining almost always include accounts of gold mining, and in some cases copper and gold were possibly recovered together.122 A small number of ancient gold mines have been reported from the Transvaal.123 By far the majority of the ancient mines in Zimbabwe, an estimated 4000, were for gold, which was recovered mainly from auriferous quartz veins.124 This gold played an integral role in the establishment of major trading towns like Mapungubwe and Great Zim- babwe, which dominated the Indian Ocean trade in southern Africa during the first half of the second millennium A.D.125 primitiewe koper-, yster-, en bronssmeltery in Oos Transvaal met besonder verwysing na Phalaborwa', Tegnikon, Ix (1956), 9I-I04; N.

All the metals required for the creation of the tenth-century A.D. bronzes from Igbo-Ukwu (and possibly also the later Nigerian bronzes) have been shown to be available locally in the Benue Rift zone of Nigeria.130 Recent research has been aimed at locating the ancient mines and sourcing the metals by trace element analysis.131 The extensive early tin mines at Rooiberg in the Transvaal received some attention early this century,132 but most of the evidence of early mining has been destroyed.133 Dates of about A.D. 1445 and A.D. 1485 have been obtained retrospectively from a log found in the mine and from charcoal embedded in a tin ingot.134 Much of the estimated i8,ooo tonnes of tin ore mined prehistorically at Rooiberg135 must have been exported, because very little tin or bronze has been found in local archaeological sites. Nevertheless some tin may have been used locally to make bronze and bronze-like alloys.136 A gold', Transvaal Museum Bulletin, XIX (I983), 24-6; A.

The variety of material mined, or collected, was considerable and ranged from high grade magnetite143 to low grade laterite.144 This range in composition necessitated a diversity of ore preparation and smelting techniques. In some cases lateritic ores apparently too low in grade to produce free iron by direct reduction were exploited. 145 These were partially reduced at relatively low temperatures to upgrade the ore in a prior pre-smelting process,146 or smelted without allowing the reaction between the iron oxide and the coarse quartz gangue to proceed to completion, hence excluding much of the gangue from the process.147 Iron ore mining techniques in Africa varied widely depending on the nature of the ore.148 For instance, at Sukur in north-eastern Nigeria, women Transvaal', J7ournal of the South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, LXXV (I 975), I85-9I. 137 L.

Smelting The literature describing indigenous smelting in Africa is vast and cannot be reviewed here comprehensively. For more extensive lists of references dealing with the topic, see the bibliographies of Cline"53 and Miller and Maggs.154 The operations of sub-Saharan smelters were associated almost ubiquit- ously with extensive ritual.155 The ethnographic record reveals that ritual was aimed primarily at warding off malevolent influences so as to protect the smelters involved in an enterprise perceived as dangerous and to ensure the successful outcome of the smelt. The smelter's role was identified as special, with the smelter accorded particular status, either elevated or in some cases as a member of an outsider caste. This reflected respect, and often fear, for the smelter's ability to manipulate the dangerous forces of generation. The reproductive symbolism of the smelting process was often made explicit by the anthropomorphic design of furnaces found ranging from Nigeria to southern Africa.156 Several detailed technical descriptions of various aspects of the processes involved in indigenous African copper and iron smelting are available,157 while a number of descriptions dealing specifically with the mechanism of the bloomery iron process are relevant here.158 This discussion will con- 149 H.

VAN DER MERWE centrate mainly on aspects of research into copper and iron smelting in Africa that are currently topical and will deal with the two metals separately. The furnaces used for copper smelting varied widely in their design and size and presumably in their operation. These included simple conical non- slag-tapping shaft furnaces of clay like those used in the first millennium B.C. in the Agadez region of Niger;"59 shallow basins surmounted by piles of anthills and more substantial clay brick ovens in Katanga;"60 the simple bowl and shaft construction identified at Phalaborwa;161 and the more complex domed furnaces described from Uitkomst Cave and Buispoort in the Transvaal."62 The ores used appear to have been exclusively the hydrous carbonates malachite and azurite.163 In some instances the ores were roasted before smelting, driving off the water and incidentally oxidising any sulphide fragments, but the systematic processing of massive sulphide ores by roasting seems to have been unknown.164 The number and form of the tufyres used in copper smelting also varied, from flared clay pipes165 to hollowed out anthills166 and tubes fashioned out of stone.167 Iron oxide was added on occasion as a flux,168 but the possible addition of other fluxes such as lime in the form of shells or calcrete is debatable.169 The mechanisms of copper smelting in Africa have received remarkably little attention despite the recognized indigenous importance of the metal.170 Successful experimental smelting of copper was carried out by Friede and Steel in a variety of furnace designs - a ceramic low shaft furnace, a crucible furnace with the crucible supported by rocks and a reconstruction of the domed, so-called Uitkomst type furnace.171 Nevertheless, there are no available data on yields or quantified comparisons between different tech- niques, and there is clearly the opportunity for far more experimental work. The chronological issues associated with the confusing claims for very early copper working in the Agadez region appear to have been resolved, but a technical puzzle remains.172 If copper smelting was introduced to Africa in the first millennium B.C. it postdated the knowledge of sulphide ore roasting, already being practised in Europe.173 Perhaps the relatively plentiful supply of surficial carbonate ore in Africa was sufficient to satisfy local needs, and the more complicated and hazardous mining techniques needed to mine the more deeply seated sulphide ores would have involved an unnecessarily taxing escalation in mining activity.174 Crafts of the Blacksmith (Belfast, I984), I9-27; N.

These differences reflect the diversity in ore types exploited. They also gave rise to products that vary significantly in form and carbon content. This technological diversity attests to local experimentation, regional specialization and a rich but largely unexplored history of tech- nological change. Iron smelting can be achieved by a continuum of processes ranging from the bloomery furnace producing low-carbon iron at one end of the scale to the blast furnace producing high-carbon cast iron at the other. Steel (i.e. an alloy of iron with various amounts of carbon up to about 2 per cent, which can be added either in the furnace or in the subsequent smithing process) of intermediate carbon content can be made in a variety of ways. These include hybrid smelting techniques, which produce inhomogeneous blooms of variable carbon composition; cementation in a reducing atmosphere to increase the carbon content of bloomery iron; decarburization of cast iron in an oxidizing atmosphere; and the addition of bloomery iron to cast iron to dilute the carbon content of the latter.175 The bloomery process for producing low-carbon iron has been termed the 'direct' process, and the routes using cast iron as the starting material have been called the 'indirect process',176 while the production of high-carbon blooms in Africa has been termed the 'African direct steel process '.17 The 'African direct steel process' has since been shown to be a normal variant of steel production in the bloomery furnace, and the term is redundant.178 The terms 'direct' and Iindirect' are used more precisely to classify the partial reduction reactions which take place in iron smelting.179 Direct reduction involves the reduction of the oxides of iron by solid carbon, in the form of added charcoal or precipitated lamp black180 according to the following suite of reactions: 6Fe2O3 + C 4Fe3O4 + C02 2Fe3O4+C-C6FeO+C02 2FeO+C-C2Fe+CO2 Indirect reduction takes place in the presence of an excess of carbon monoxide according to the following reactions: 181 3 Fe2O3 + CO 2Fe3O4 + C02 Fe3O4 + CO 3 FeO + CO2 FeO + CO Fe + C02 The practical validity of this distinction under furnace operating condi- tions is doubtful,182 and both sets of reactions may take place in volumes with 175 Rostoker and Bronson, Pre-industrial Iron. 176 van der Merwe, Carbon-I4 Dating; Rostoker and Bronson, Pre-industrial Iron. 177 van der Merwe, 'Production of high carbon steel'; van der Merwe and Avery, 'Pathways'. 178 Killick, 'A comparative perspective'; Killick and Gordon, 'The mechanism of iron production'. 179 G.

E. MILLER AND N. J. VAN DER MERWE differing atmospheric conditions in the same furnace. It is realistic to view the different steel producing processes as part of a continuum and to recognize that the distinction between the 'direct' and 'indirect' processes stems from the historical distinction in Europe between the production of bloomery iron (produced directly) or wrought iron (produced indirectly, through the decarburization of cast iron). The metallurgy of the iron bloomery is not simple. A complex set of interactive mechanisms must operate to various degrees in different parts of individual furnaces and in furnaces of different designs to accommodate the observed variations in the ore composition, the furnace operating parameters and the composition of the final bloomery product. There is still considerable divergence of opinion about these mechanisms, but the combination of archaeological description, ethnographic reconstruction and controlled experimentation is clarifying the picture.183 Indigenous African iron smelting produced material with a range of carbon compositions ranging from conventional, nearly carbon-free bloomery iron through steel to rare instances of cast iron.184 It has been recognized elsewhere from the archaeological record that ancient bloomeries must have been capable of producing steel,185 and this has been confirmed through experiment."'

African iron smelting took place in bloomery furnaces, producing het- erogeneous blooms with variable carbon content.192 The furnaces themselves display a wide range of forms, some of them adapted to processing specific ores and some constructed to take advantage of the flexibility of bloomery smelting to make specific products. Brief summaries of several smelting reconstructions, described fairly recently in the literature, will illustrate the point. Iron smelting by the Dimi of Ethiopia took place in a forced draught, non- slag-tapping furnace about i metre high with a o-5 metre pit below.193 This was filled with grass, which was burnt before the furnace was charged with alternate layers of ore and charcoal. Thirty-six tuyeres were used to direct air from clay pot bellows into the furnace. After four hours the furnace was allowed to cool and the bloom removed for forging in a separate oxidizing forge. A knife produced from this bloom had a carbon content that varied from o-8 per cent carbon to virtually carbon-free iron. The furnace used by the Haya in Tanzania was a forced draught bowl shaft furnace constructed out of slabs of refractory slag bound together with clay.194 Reeds were burnt in the furnace before inserting the tuyeres and charging the furnace with charcoal and roasted ore. Eight tuyeres were placed with much of their original length inside the furnace, which has led the investigators to believe that significant preheating of the incoming air had taken place.195 Their arguments have been criticized vigorously, particularly on thermodynamic grounds.196 The only experimental evaluation of this pre- 188 Clough, 'The bloomery process'. 189 Pleiner, 'Early iron metallurgy'. 190 Killick, 'A comparative perspective'; Rostocker and Bronson, Pre-industrial Iron. 191 Killick and Gordon, 'The mechanism of iron production'; R.

VAN DER MERWE heating hypothesis197 suffered from the same problems in measuring the air temperature in tuyeres as the field reconstruction and is not considered a valid test.198 The relatively high carbon content of the final bloom product from the Haya furnace was ascribed to carburization by carbon precipitated as lamp black in cracks in the ore during the prior roasting step and to entrapped charcoal from the charred grass.199 Despite claims by Avery and Schmidt to the contrary, the iron crystallization mechanism and products of this furnace were not significantly different from those of bloomery furnaces operated elsewhere.200 The bloom had a carbon content of 04 per cent carbon to o-6 per cent carbon, and the metal was almost completely decarburized in the forge. 201 Natural draught furnaces are not confined exclusively to Africa, as there is one example known from Burma,202 but they were used extensively in the West African forest, the savanna woodlands of the Sahel and in southern Central Africa,203 perhaps as far south as Zimbabwe.204 They vary widely in shape and size but tend to be larger than forced-draught furnaces. Most were slag-tapping, but some not, and they produced inhomogeneous blooms with up to o 8 per cent carbon.205 Particularly well described examples are from Oyo in Nigeria,206 Koni in the Ivory Coast207 and Kasungu in Malawi.208 Reconstructions involving two different types of natural draught furnace have been studied in Malawi. The Cewa furnace was a 25S-metre tall, two- chambered, non-slag-tapping clay furnace with nine tuyeres, loaded with a low grade lateritic ore and charcoal.209 After five days, and the consumption of about i,455 kilograms of charcoal, the furnace produced a bloom of low- carbon iron which was then resmelted in a small, forced draught furnace.210 The Phoka furnace was a IPs-metre high conical clay furnace with numerous tuyeres and was charged with specifically selected, very low grade laterite ore.211 The furnace was fired for five days, consuming i,ooo kilograms of charcoal, and produced a bloom which was broken up and most of it resmelted in a small forced draught furnace to produce a dense, metallic secondary bloom of unspecified carbon content. These two-stage processes are variants that accommodated the low-grade lateritic ore used and enabled the beneficiation of the ore in the natural draught furnace by separating iron- rich slag from unreacted gangue.212 197 S.

The tuyere had to be trimmed of viscous slag which blocked the air hole intermittently, and slag was also removed from a series of vent holes cut into the furnace wall at increasing heights, tracing the build-up of the bloom beneath the tuyere. After ten-and-a-half hours, and after con- suming 82-3 kilograms of charcoal, a I 57 kilogram bloom mass was recovered from i8-o kilograms of ore. The bloom varied from ferrite with less than o0os per cent carbon to cast iron with more than 4 per cent carbon. About half the mass was cast iron, decarburized in the oxidizing forge with unsorted fragments of the other metallic products in an open crucible. The final product, manufactured into a hoe, consisted of steel with a carbon content between 0o2 per cent carbon and o 8 per cent carbon.214 Attempts at describing the mechanisms operating in African bloomery furnaces which produce steel products began with that of Harbord, who recognized that the Oyo steel bloom consisted of partly decarburized cast iron.215 A hypothesized two-stage mechanism whereby a cast iron product was decarburized in the Oyo furnace was summarized by Rostocker and Bronson216 as follows. The high carbon flux was added every two hours. During the period between flux additions, there was a continuing reaction between the iron oxide-rich slag and the carbon dissolved in the metal pool below and in contact with the slag pool. The slag/metal reaction slowly removed the carbon present near the surface of the gradually accreting lump of iron. As the lump was decarburized, the iron oxide content of the slag was simultaneously reduced to iron, which helped to increase the metal yield. Since this decarburization reaction generated no heat, fuel had to be added with the flux to keep both slag and metal molten. If this interpretation is correct, then the technical distinction between bloomery and blast furnace is invalid in at least some African contexts. Four possible mechanisms for the direct production of steel in a bloom were described by Rostoker and Bronson.217 i. Charcoal fragments trapped in the bloom carburize the metal directly. ii. Reduced iron particles are carburized by gas in the stack, followed by rapid oxidation by the flame zone so that composite particles falling into the slag pool separate, with the oxides entering the slag and the carbon- rich iron cores accreting on the bloom. iii. High-carbon metal particles are coated with partially reduced slag, which protects the iron from the oxidizing flame. iv. Droplets of cast iron produced on the reducing periphery of the junction between the oxidizing high temperature flame and surrounding zone of carbon monoxide settle through the slag to form localized high-carbon regions in the predominantly lower-carbon bloom. The range of carbon dioxide concentration required to avoid the production 213 David et al.. 'Bloomerv and blast furnace'. 214 Ibid. 215 Bellamy.

VAN DER MERWE of either bloomery iron or cast iron (i.e. to produce steel) at I 200 ?C in a shaft furnace is very narrow (between about i per cent and 5 per cent), making the direct reduction of ore to steel very difficult to control. Thus, it is argued that it is likely that steel production in the bloomery furnace most probably results from the in situ secondary decarburization of cast iron.218 A generalized mechanism for bloomery iron production based on the East African and Malawian smelting reconstructions was presented by Avery et al.219 This involved the initial formation of iron spherules by a process of accretion into tiny spheres. At higher temperatures the partially reduced spherules were consumed by rapidly growing iron plates with a pure ferrite growth front. At yet higher temperatures this structure 'began to organize itself into islands ... These islands gradually assumed a concentric ar- rangement of platelets parallel to the surface, and the inner plates dis- solved ... leaving dense iron nodules of a few millimetres in diameter with hollow or internally fissured interiors'. 220 A general sequence was proposed of fine precipitation, platelet formation and nodule development. At higher temperatures still the smaller iron particles dissolved in the liquid slag and were reprecipitated onto larger particles. In the forced draught furnaces, attaining the highest temperature, direct reduction by finely divided carbon was thought to have taken place, enabling iron to precipitate out of the supersaturated slag to form large equiaxed grains. Fluctuating temperatures were seen as essential to this slag solution-transport-reprecipitation mech- anism. This account is probably erroneous because it failed to recognize the pisolitic structure of the lateritic ore. The spherical structures described by Avery et al. could have been inherited from the structure of the ore. The concentrically banded spherulitic structures illustrated by Avery et al.221 appear to be pseudomorphous after the concentrically banded iron oxide and silicate pisoliths and not to be the result of transport and accretion of iron in the furnace.222 The postulated mechanism of precipitation of iron from the slag is feasible, but it is not necessary to explain the observed microstructure of the bloom. Large equiaxed crystals are typical of iron cooled slowly from high temperatures, as these blooms were. Killick and Gordon223 have presented an alternative description of the mechanisms operating in the bloomery process, drawing on examples from Kasungu in Malawi, from the historic Adirondack bloomeries in New York State and from an experimental bloomery at Colonial Williamsburg. Their concise description of the bloomery process warrants being quoted in full.224 The accepted theoretical basis of the bloomery process is that the ore is reduced by carbon monoxide in the sequence, hydrated iron oxides - haematite - magnetite - wustite [sic] - iron. The equilibrium conditions for complete reduction are attained when the temperatures are greater than 8oo ?C and the CO/CO2 ratio greater than 218 Ibid. 219 Avery et al., 'Metallurgy'. 220 Ibid. 276. 221 Ibid. 278. 222 The reduced pisolith illustrated in Fig. I of Killick and Gordon ('The mechanism of iron production', I22), captioned 'Kasungu, Malawi.

To effect separation of the iron from the gangue in the ore, some of the iron oxide in the ore is sacrificed to form a fluid slag with a composition near that of fayalite so as to have a solidus temperature of about I200 ?C. If all of the gangue is to be removed in this way, and if slag-forming reactions approach equilibrium, the ore must contain at least 49 per cent iron for there to be any yield of metal. Because reduction of iron oxide to iron can be carried out in a bloomery at temperatures too low for elements such as manganese, silicon, and titianium that may be present in the ore to be reduced, relatively pure iron can be produced. Since the fuel used is always charcoal, bloomery iron is usually free of sulfur but phosphorus in either the ore or the fuel ash may be reduced and enter the iron. Either steel or iron can be made by adjusting the ore/fuel ratio and the temperature. According to Killick and Gordon225 the Malawian bloomeries were used for smelting low grade laterite ores with 20 per cent to 30 per cent elemental iron, too low to have produced any metallic iron if equilibrium conditions obtained in the furnaces. The concentrically banded pisoliths were reduced by carbon monoxide successively to magnetite-wuistite-iron and formed concentric bands of metallic iron in a nodular structure directly pseudo- morphous after the original pisolith. The fluid slags formed subsequently from the silicate groundmass consisted of fayalite, glass and unreacted quartz and drained easily from the reduced iron, which coalesced due to surface tension. The accretion and consolidation of the iron to form a bloom of variable carbon content took place under the weight of the material above it in the stack. This was summarized as an example of simple direct gas reduction of a porous lateritic ore.226 The diversity of mechanisms and the inherent variability in the bloomery process make it possible to produce iron, steel and cast iron in a wide variety of furnace types, operated in an equally wide variety of ways. Broad temporal and spatial trends in furnace and bellows design in the archaeological and ethnographic record for Africa as a whole have been identified by van der Merwe227 and Kense.22 Bowl furnaces predominated in the Interlacustrine Region and East Africa, with some recorded from the Congo basin and Angola. These were usually driven with valveless pot or drum bellows, although in some cases they were associated with bag bellows. Bowl furnaces are thought to have been replaced largely by shaft furnaces, at first possibly simple vertical extensions to the rim of the bowl and with no facility for slag tapping. Later developments may have included slag tapping and removal of the bloom through a lateral access hole. Low shaft furnaces, seen as the local survival of Early Iron Age technology associated with the initial spread of Bantu peoples, are found in more recent contexts predominantly in southern Africa. Tall shaft furnaces, operating on natural draught, are found through- out West Africa, parts of the Congo basin and in East Africa and were in use locally until the middle of this century. This may imply an African invention of these furnaces in Later Iron Age times.229 The more recent discussion of Kense230 emphasized the difficulty of making sense of the known distribution of furnace and bellows types in sub- Saharan Africa. The situation in West Africa is no less obscure, with a 225 Ibid. 226 Ibid. 227 van der Merwe.

VAN DER MERWE bewildering variety of furnace designs combining diverse elements that confound simple classification.231 Mere classification of furnace design is not very informative.232 The variations in furnace design will have to be studied chronologically, taking into account both ethnographic and technological variables, before any sense can be made of the conflicting evidence for the 'long temporal and spatial continuity' and the 'complications and divergent traditions ... temporal as well as spatial '233 from different parts of Africa. The variation in furnace types from southern Africa was described by Kiisel,234 who classified them morphologically into the Buispoort type, the Melvillekoppies type, the Venda type and the Loole type. In a survey of South African smelting sites and furnaces Friede235 noted the lack of information about Early Iron Age furnaces and presented a tripartite morphological classification of beehive- or oval-shaped furnaces, the Venda type and the Melville Koppies (sic) type. More recently Friede236 reviewed the distribution, typology and characteristics of iron smelting furnaces from southern Africa and classified them in terms of morphology, number of tuyeres and the nature of the draught. Early Iron Age bowl furnaces have been reported from Matola in Mocambique and further south as far as the Transkei.237 The furnace from Zimbabwe reported by Prendergast238 as a natural draught furnace may also date from the first millennium A.D.239 South of the Zambezi two furnace types predominate - various types of low shaft furnaces and what appear to be bowl furnaces. The known archaeological and historic distribution of furnace types does not allow for the recognition of any routes of introduction or dispersion.240 Evidently the history of smelting style and furnace design is complex, with the result that local developments have given rise to dramatic differences in close proximity to each other. Forging and smithing Traditional smithing and forging has received less attention in the technical literature than smelting,24' but there are numerous ethnographic accounts of smithing. After the demise of smelting in many regions smiths continued using scrap iron and still do. Selected accounts of forging, mostly using 231 Pole, 'Furnace design'; J. E. G.

Bellamy242 described the forging of an indigenous bloom and the smithing practice in the West African village of Oyo in detail. The forge was blown with a pair of valveless, circular, wooden bowl bellows covered with goat skin and pumped by centrally attached bamboo rods, feeding air to the open hearth through two wooden tuyeres. An iron hammer was used to beat the heated bloom first on a large stone anvil and then on a smaller metal one to fashion the required tools. The indigenous metal was considered to be superior and more durable than imported English iron.243 Smithing in the village of Sukur, north-eastern Nigeria, was described by Sassoon.244 Iron fragments were heated in the forge for about half an hour, removed with iron tongs and beaten on a rock anvil with large hammer stones. The consolidated lump was then reheated and forged into the required tools. A short account by Crawhill245 of smithing in the Sudan recorded that four valveless bellows were used, made of clay and covered with goat skin and operated by hand. Fragments of bloomery iron were heated in open clay crucibles until they were soft enough to be hammered together between stone anvils and then shaped further using a handleless iron hammer. The Dimi forge241 was a walled hearth driven by two drum bellows operated by hand and blowing air into a single tuyere. A blunt iron hammer and stones were used to fashion the desired implement by hammering the heated bloomery iron on a specially selected stone anvil. The final product was not quenched or tempered. Broken tools were also repaired at the forge. Iron smithing in southern Mbeere in Kenya was associated with intensive ritual, principally to ward off the evil influence of other smiths.247 This is significant because ritual is usually associated with smelting and not smithing. The forge was the same open bowl hearth that was used for smelting the ilmenite ore and was driven by a pair of goat-skin bag bellows with bifurcated nozzles, blowing air into a single baked clay tuyere. The tools used included a drinking horn and a millet brush for sprinkling ritually prepared quenching water on the anvil, the hammer, the tuyeres and the fire. The smelted lump of iron was removed from the open furnace with iron tongs and, with repeated heating, beaten with a wooden handled iron hammer into a small bar from which the desired tools or jewellery were fabricated. In I929 Dedekind recorded the operations of a Zulu blacksmith, Hloma Mathonsi, in Natal.248 Mathonsi used a pair of goat skin bag bellows to drive air through a single baked clay tuyere. The anvil was a specially selected rock, and the hammer a home-made one of iron. The only other metal-working tool mentioned was a very blunt file. Final shaping was done by abrasion using a stone. 242 Bellamy. 'West African smelting house'. 243 Ibid. 244 Sassoon, 'Iron-smelting'. 245 T. C.

VAN DER MERWE All of these accounts describe heating the metal in an oxidizing at- mosphere, which would have lowered the carbon content of the original metal, giving rise to the generally low carbon content of many indigenous artefacts. In the case of working high-carbon blooms this effect was not undesirable. For instance, the Mafa smith in North Cameroon heated an unsorted mixture of fragments of cast iron, steel and low carbon iron in an open crucible heated in an oxidizing flame to lower and homogenize the carbon content and produce workable material.249 While hot forging was used to produce agricultural implements, awls, spears, knives, bells and twisted rod jewellery out of iron, copper was subjected to far more varied fabrication techniques including wire drawing and casting.250 Wire drawing of copper appears to have been practised principally in central and southern Africa up until the present25' although its origins are not known.252 Wire drawing was done with a clamp vice to grip the copper rod, which was drawn through a perforated steel draw-plate wedged in a tree or attached to a pole.253 The wire was used for decorating weapons and for jewellery, usually in the form of wound bangles, also made from hammered strip or with ribbon cut from hammered plate.254 The casting of copper and copper alloys in Africa has been reviewed comprehensively by Herbert.255 The bronze, brass and copper castings of West Africa, in some cases employing the lost-wax process, represent the apogee of casting practice,256 although the origins of this technical expertise are unknown.257 In central and southern Africa copper ingots and tin ingots were cast in both open stone moulds and in sand. In Central Africa copper ingots were cast with characteristic cross shapes and traded widely.258 In southern Africa copper was cast into small nail-shaped ingots with flattened heads, larger golf club-shaped lerale ingots with heads frequently decorated with projecting rods and into top hat-shaped musuku ingots decorated with numerous projecting rods. The literature describing these ingots is extensive, but very little is known about the casting technology or the social significance of the objects so produced.259 Recently a unique tin lerale from the 249 TDavid e't a l i lnnnimiru -and I,at fiirna 250 Herbert RePd GnId. 251 K.

Ongoing sourcing studies focused on copper and tin26' and the recent discovery of a gold-processing site in the north-eastern Transvaal262 are promising developments. The more recent history of gold mining and the gold trade263 is still the subject of unresolved controversy concerning the extent of possible Indian involvement in southern African metallurgy.264 At present there is no technological evidence to support claims for extensive Indian influence in southern African mining or metals fabrication. What Indian influence existed appears to have been restricted to the importation of trade goods.265 CONCLUSION The major advance of the last decade in the field of African archaeo- metallurgy has been the development of an integrated approach in studying smelting technology. These studies are necessarily complex, requiring an eclectic mix of disciplines, including geology, archaeology, social anthro- pology, linguistics, materials science and process engineering. The product is a rich field of enquiry, rich both in potential information and in controversy. Not surprisingly, some of the early enthusiasms of the decade, particularly those associated with technical interpretations of the smelting process, have been subject to revision. The bloomery process as practised in Africa and elsewhere has been shown to be inherently extremely varied, routinely producing products ranging from nearly pure iron through carbon steel to cast iron. This mitigates claims for the early local development of metallurgically sophisticated smelting techniques of special historical significance.

E. MILLER AND N. J. VAN DER MERWE smelting technology involving pre-heated air have not won general support. The supposed mechanism for pre-heating has not been tested rigorously enough in the laboratory or smelting reconstructions to demonstrate its existence or any technological advantage. Because of the intrinsic variability of the bloomery process the notion of an 'African direct steel process' is redundant. The direct production of steel has been shown to be one of the options in a bloomery smelting operation. It is not unique to Africa and has no special technological significance. What is significant is the range of variation in African bloomery furnace design, operation and output. This speaks of a rich history of experimentation, local adaptation and a complex web of contact between smelting practitioners. Trying to unravel the legacy of this technological and social interplay is the rather daunting present task of African archaeometallurgy. The chronology of the spread of metal working in Africa continues to be problematic. The evidence for very early smelting at Agadez has not survived careful scrutiny. With it goes the strongest argument for the independent discovery of smelting in West Africa. This should encourage the rigorous analysis of metallurgical products, as well as searches for more persuasive evidence than that presently available for the introduction of metal working from the Mediterranean or Indian Ocean, or for more convincing evidence for the autochthonous development of smelting either in West or East Africa. The quest for a radiocarbon-dated chronology for the initial spread of metal working in Africa is frustrated by the unavoidable imprecision of radiocarbon dates. Thermoluminescence dating may help weed out spurious radiocarbon dates, but it is clear that radiometric dating alone is insufficient for the task. This may lead to a beneficial shift from chronologically orientated studies of African metal working to the more cultural ones needed to resolve the paths of metal-working people in any detail. Until recently, the activities of indigenous smiths have suffered relative neglect by archaeometallurgists in favour of the study of the more readily visible remains of smelting. This situation is changing with the systematic metallographic analysis of some large assemblages (mostly from central and southern Africa), chosen to reflect the regional and temporal differences as well as similarities in fabrication technology. This research work is laborious and slow but eventually will result in the large number of metallographic and chemical analyses necessary to compare fabrication technologies and eluci- date the history of indigenous metal-working enterprise. Distinguishing between smelting sites and smithing sites on the basis of archaeological residues is notoriously difficult, but it is an important aspect of archaeometallurgical research. The exclusion rituals and taboos associated ethnographically with iron smelting may not reflect earlier practice. Ongoing work attempting to distinguish smelting and smithing residues from their context and composition is crucial in the identification of metal working activity locations and the archaeological interpretation of the social aspects of metal production and use. It is evident that a social and technological history of African metal working can be established only through collaborative, interdisciplinary research. The past decade of research in this field has seen the inception of the very fruitful union of archaeology and materials science. This has gained potential impetus from the recent qualification of about half a dozen</page><page sequence="33">EARLY METAL WORKING 33 Africanist archaeologists with the requisite interdisciplinary skills. Over the next ten years we can look forward to a far more detailed and richer account of the social and technological history of African metallurgy. APPENDIX I.

In the case of carbon steels this can harden and embrittle the metal very significantly. Reducing atmosphere A gas atmosphere which promotes reduction by the presence of significant quantities of carbon monoxide relative to carbon dioxide. Reduction The chemical removal of oxygen from a compound. Roasting Relatively prolonged heating of ore nodules on open fires to induce drying, cracking, partial break-down of sulphides, and to facilitate subsequent smelting. Shaft furnace A smelting oven incorporating a cylindrical or conical chimney, or shaft. Slag pool A puddle of molten slag, either trapped in the bottom of a non slag- tapping furnace or drained to the outside from a slag-tapping furnace. Slag-tapping The practice of opening the base of a furnace during operation to drain the accumulated slag and allow the smelt to proceed without blocking the tuyere with slag. Slag The molten, or solidified, waste product of smelting, consisting of fused components derived from the ore, flux, fuel, and furnace lining. Slags can vary significantly in composition and microstructure, and contain chemical and mineralogical information crucial to the reconstruction of furnace operating conditions. Smelting The process of chemically reducing an oxide ore to a range of products including workable metal by the application of heat in a furnace. Smithing The process of physically modifying a hot or cold piece of metal with blows to fabricate a desired shape and to impart required physical properties to the material. Solidus temperature The temperature at which a melt of any particular composition solidifies by crystallization. Specularite Lustrous platy haematite, iron oxide (Fe203). Spherulitic structure A texture, commonly found in laterites, consisting of small spheres of iron oxides and silica often displaying a concentric internal structure. If the spherules are small the structure is described as pisolitic. Stack The conical or cylindrical shaft of a furnace, usually applied to a blast furnace.</page><page sequence="36">36 D. E. MILLER AND N. J. VAN DER MERWE Standard deviation A statistical measure of the precision of a measurement, which in radiocarbon dating is quoted usually as + I sigma, implying that the true measurement value lies between the stated limits with a probability of 68 per cent. Steel An alloy of carbon in iron in which the carbon content lies between about o0os and 2-0 per cent. Sulphide ore In the context of ancient metallurgy, copper sulphide ores typically found at some depth below the oxidized and leached surface outcrops which were the initial target of early mining. Surface tension The cohesive force associated with the surface of any liquid. Tempering The heat treatment of a quenched metal at a moderate temperature of about 500 ?C to allow partial recrystallization to take place in order to reduce the brittleness of the as-quenched material. Thermoluminescence A dating technique which relies on detecting the energy accumulated over time of radiation-induced defects in some crystalline materials which release this energy as light when heated. Tuyere An air pipe through which air is either pumped or drawn into a furnace. Valveless bellows Bellows without inlet valves, which rely on a loose fit between the bellows outlet and the tuyere to allow air to be sucked in through this gap. Wire drawing A technique for thinning a metal rod by drawing it through successively finer perforations in a plate. Wustite An oxide of iron with the approximate formula of Fe1-XO.</page></plain_text>
