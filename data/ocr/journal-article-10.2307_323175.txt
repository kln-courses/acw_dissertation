<plain_text><page sequence="1">KAHANE, HENRY AND RENEE, in collaboration with Angelina Pietrangeli. The Krater and the Grail: Hermetic Sources of the "Parzival." Illinois Studies in Language and Literature, Volume 56. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1965. Pp. xi+218, with 64 plates. $7.50, cloth; $6.50, paper. In the long chain of attempts to solve the mystery of the Grail, especially of its origin, this latest study is not only one of the most fascinating contributions in recent years, but also the most problematic and challenging one. The authors claim to provide an esoteric key for the whole work. Its application yields numerous new observations on indi- vidual passages, actions and characters as well as on the intellectual background. However, the price paid for the riches opened up by this key is high, for its rather inflexible use has also placed this book among the most one-sided works in Parzival scholarship. The basic hypothesis proposed by the authors: Wol- fram's Parzival is built around an "Urparzival" composed of religious elements from the Corpus Hermeticum (a collec- tion of treatises containing the essential doctrines of Her- metism, a Hellenistic mystery religion of Egyptian prove- nance). The religious action as a whole, with its focus on the Urparzival, is regarded as a faithful adaptation of the Hermetic tradition through the twelfth century, including its various modifications and additions. The core of Wol- fram's epic, the Grail story, appears as a poetic transforma- tion of the central Hermetic treatise, the Krater text. In fact, the Grail itself is identified with the Krater, the Hermetic symbol of gnosis and the pre-eminent cult object of the secret society, used among others as a baptismal vessel. Hence the title, which implies a virtually new and highly original solution of the Grail problem. Apart from this most crucial problem, a number of related issues are dauntlessly attacked. Among the ten items listed by the authors there are such puzzling ones as the figure of Kyot and his mysterious sources, and such basic ones as the concepts of zwivel and triuwe. Yet, while the list of problems keeps within the bounds of traditional Parzival scholarship, the methods employed in their at- tempted solution-(1) genetic; (2) etymological; (3) literal --are not commonly favored today, although they have all been fruitfully applied in previous generations; the genetic approach e.g. in the brilliant study of Jessie L. Weston (From Ritual to Romance); the etymological method es- pecially in the clarification of proper names; and the literal one by all scholars who refused to adopt the skeptical attitude regarding the reliability of Wolfram's statements about his alleged mediator Kyot, now shared by the ma- jority of Parzival scholars. Although some of these ap- proaches are not held in great esteem at the present time, they should be recognized as basically solid and perfectly legimate if pursued in true scholarly fashion. They should be especially appreciated as a welcome challenge to meth- odological complacency when it requires courage to follow up a line of argument regardless of the market value of specific methods. It the book nevertheless seems to fall short of what it promises, and if the reader fails to be con- vinced at the end that Parzival, along with Chritien's Perceval, is fundamentally an example of conversion litera- ture, it is not due to the methods applied nor to a lack of learning in general. It rather results from the exclusive concentration on the Hermetic materials and the deliberate neglect of almost all other possible sources of the Grail story accumulated over generations. The systematic presentation of the Hermetic hypothesis is divided into three major chapters: "The Story of a Myst" -"The Transmission"-"Wolfram's Hermetism." The first one-the most decisive one, since it has to provide the textual foundation for the entire construction-is a com- parative analysis of the religious development of the epic hero and the Hermetic aspirant. Numerous passages from the Parzival text are quoted to demonstrate the parallels between the two patterns and to underscore the analogous progress from agnosy (zwivel) to gnosis (heil, sael), from darkness to light, from test, failure, and confusion to reve- lation, initiation, and rebirth. The parallels are mostly in the category of descriptive passages related to religious actions and doctrines. But they also include etymological equivalents and correspondences in the major figures. "The Story of a Myst" starts out with a disposition of the basic constituents of the secret community and its beliefs, pointing out parallels in Parzival for each of them. This is, to be sure, a very logical way of introducing the reader to the heart of the matter. But since the analogies are, almost of necessity, drawn at random from all parts of the respective texts, and usually prove to be of a rather general nature, it hardly fails to arouse the critical reader to challenge the validity of the whole approach before he has become acquainted with better evidence. What, for example, is proven by listing such qualities of God as "not anthropomorphic," "infinite," "mysterious," "immutable," or, "God is light," is "truth," and "the carrier of intellec- tual principles" (pp. 8-13)? Could God, in almost any medieval text, be anything but all this? Thus, the Hermetic argument presents itself from the weakest side, especially since some of the parallels are not nearly as close as desired. Most readers will maintain their skeptical attitude when they proceed to the paragraphs on "baptism," on "the food-giving vessel," "the stone," "the female members," "procreation" (pp. 18-25), or to certain parts dealing with the individual phases of the aspirant's progress, such as</page><page sequence="2">180 BOOK REVIEWS "The New Road" (pp. 54-55), or "When evening had come... " (pp. 73-74), or "Knowledge of God" (pp. 80- 84). Even if we make generous allowance for poetic license, the textual basis in these specific cases is simply too thin for an equation of Parzival elements with the constituents of Hermetism. Sometimes the feature in common is even transplanted from a different context. Thus the discussion of baptism as a prerequisite for membership in the brotherhood obscures its lack in the Parzival story by substituting the baptism of Feirefiz (however revealing this act may be in its own right). Like- wise the lack of evidence for the Grail as a baptismal vessel is remedied by the emanation of baptismal water from the Grail in the same instance. In the treatment of the "food- giving vessel" it is neither established that Wolfram's Grail is a vessel nor that the Krater is endowed with the magic property of providing food. Instead, the gnostic passages quoted merely refer to food as a "divine nourish- ment of the mind" (p. 20) and to drinking in a spiritual sense, and this only in a rather loose connection with the Krater.-The "stone" feature of the Grail is conveniently reduced to a metaphor on account of the metaphoric use of the loadstone in the Krater treatise describing the at- traction of God's image for the initiate. And so one could go on: The functions of the female members and of procreation are essentially different in the two secret communities. The metaphor of the "new road" or, the road to God of the Hermetica, is hardly used sym- bolically in the Parzival passages quoted-besides the image is so common in early Christian tradition, so widespread in Medieval literature that its use would not reveal any de- pendence on a specific source. If the day of Hermetic in- doctrination ends with a prayer and a vegetarian meal, we are impressed with the analogy in Chr6tien, but when it comes to Parzival where "sleep alone is the terminal fea- ture" (p. 74), one can hardly help being slightly amused. Finally, the postulations regarding the Knowledge of God, achieved in Hermetism either through ecstasis or through baptism, are so astonishing that the critic is about to lose his patience-neither does Parzival undergo a special bap- tismal procedure in his spiritual development nor is it permissible to credit him with an ecstatic experience at the end of his journey. The enumeration of weaknesses in the presentation of parallels provides, however, hardly sufficient authorization to reject the hypothesis as a whole. It must be pointed out that the systematic comparison also yields results that are intriguing and hard to explain otherwise. If we may still disregard features like "immortality" (Titural, Amfortas), or the presence of nous in the eucharistic dove, and cer- tainly the use of the phoenix as a symbol of regeneration-- all quite compatible with other genetic theories-we cannot ignore the striking correspondences in such puzzling cases as the astral complex of the Grail or the order of the Grail procession. If one follows the authors in their assumption of the celestial origin of the Grail regardless of Ranke's famous and well-argued rejection of this popular theory, the Grail could be linked with the gnostic tradition of astral vessels, to which also the Hermetic Krater belongs. Even more important perhaps is Wolfram's derivation of the name of the Grail from the stars (454, 21-23), which seems to reflect the doctrine of Macrobius relating Crater as vessel to Crater as the constellation. Similarly, the very neat inter- pretation of the numerical proportions in the Grail proces- sion suggests certain ties with Hermetic thought, although the values assigned to the individual numbers are not derived directly from the Hermetica. The order of the virgins can be expressed by the formula 4+8+12+1=25. Each of the subgroups corresponds to a cosmic concept, the total of 25 signifying the completion of a cosmic journey, "the soul's journey toward the Monad" (p. 101), after passing the stations of the four elements, the eight spheres of planets and fixed stars, and the twelve signs of the zodiac. Even if one misses the direct relation to Parzival's spiritual journey, it remains a beautiful illumination of the secrets of the Grail community. Another type of comparison is engaged in finding the prototypes of Wolfram's major characters in the Hermetic tradition. Corresponding figures are especially proposed for Parzival and Feirefiz, for Titurel and Trevrizent, for Kyot and Flegetanis; not, however, for Amfortas or the female members of the Grail family. Wherever possible, the authors support the relationship with etymological evi- dence. Parzival is compared to the Hermetic disciple Tat. Feirefiz assumes the role of the secondary myst, assigned in the Hermetica to Hammon, likewise an African king. His blood relationship with Parzival would reflect a spiritual brotherhood. Probably the most intriguing prototype is the one offered for Trevrizent, the central and semi-divine per- sonage of the Hermetic treatises, Hermes Trismegistos himself. Apart from their common function as representa- tives of esoteric wisdom and initiators of the myst, they even seem to share their very name: Trevrizent is derived from OFr. Treble Escient &lt;Med. Lat. triplex scientia, a term used to characterize the philosophy of Hermes Trismegis- tos, the 'Thrice-Greatest' (and Thrice-Wisest). But if Trevrizent is pictured as Hermetic mystagogue, why does he actually discourage Parzival from pursuing the quest of the Grail? And when later Flegetanis is introduced as a second Hermes figure, as "Hermes the author" beside "Hermes the actor" (p. 118), the appeal of the theory is hardly enhanced. But it can, in our judgment, still claim far more probability than the equation Titurel= Kronos= Hermetic ecstatic (pp. 35-37). Of the etymologies presented in this volume, the most momentous one, the derivation of gral from Grk. KpaTrp [krat&amp;r] (via Lat. cratera, with suffix change: cratdlis) was already published in Zeitschrift ftir deutsches Altertum (1959). It is formally debatable but in my opinion not quite as acceptable as the more common ones operating with *cratdlis "bowl"&lt;crdtis "basket," or with Med. Lat. graddlis "graded vessel" (in which the food was arranged in steps). Next in importance is a new explanation of the defiant lapsit exillis crux. The authors adopt the familiar reading lapis exilis and associate exilis with the 'paltry' appearance of the magnet stone. This is of course subject to the same objection as the exploitation of the loadstone metaphor before. A more solid etymology is suggested for Amfortas, who is seen as a personification of the vice of &amp;Kpaara "incontinence" (Grk. Kpacrla = Lat. infirmitas&gt; OFr. enferti, Nom. enferts : MHG. Amforlds). But the formal part is not new, and the semantic interpretation</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 181 ("in favor of a more moral rather than physical connota- tion," p. 95), although in agreement with the story and very appealing, is hardly substantiated. Thus the main chapter leaves the reader with mixed impressions and numerous objections. The following chap- ter, discussing the intermediate stages in the historical continuity of the Hermetic heritage through the 12th century, is faced with the fact that "no traces ... exist of an uninterrupted knowledge of Greek Hermetism in the West during the Middle Ages" (p. 113). But the authors successfully restore some of the missing traces by including the Arabic civilization as a medium. Undoubtedly the high point of this investigation is the section on "Kyot's Iden- tity" (pp. 122-127) (also published previously in Zeit- schrift far deutsches Altertum, 1959). The Kahanes accept Wolfram's statements about Kyot as factual and arrive at a solution that will make it more difficult for future scholars to discard Wolfram's biographic information as plainly iron- ical and highly phantastic. The identification of Kyot as William of Tudela, the contemporary Spanish author of the Chanson de la croisade albigeoise, who spent part of his life in Southern France, would seem to account for the num- erous, often puzzling and seemingly contradictory data supplied by Wolfram (name, provenience, time, profession, religion, scholarship, language, secret knowledge); it would also solve the problem of the strange Catalan-Provengal traces in Wolfram's vocabulary and the mysterious echoes of some of the heretic doctrines of the Cathari. The argu- ment is impressively supplemented by a detailed investiga- tion into geomancy, demonstrating that William was cer- tainly familiar with this art, especially with its astrological branch, and that Wolfram was fully aware of it. The criti- cism this identification has met, especially on phonetic grounds (H. Kolb, Munsalvaesche, pp. 195-196), cannot be taken lightly and may well rule out this tempting solu- tion; but in any case it should be credited for preparing the way for a new literal approach to Wolfram's Kyot state- ments. The final chapter is essentially a brief summary of Wol- fram's use of Hermetic materials. For better comparison, the Krater treatise is printed in full. This chapter is fol- lowed by an elaborate technical apparatus containing the bibliographical references, an Index Locorum as well as an Index Nominum, Rerum, Vocabularum, all of which are very thorough and accurate. Errors were not noticed. The 64 plates at the end, with detailed description, are a very helpful addition. It should also be gratefully noted that all quotations from Greek, Latin, French, and German have been conscientiously translated, making the study much less esoteric to the non-comparatist. At the end, the question arises again: Is Wolfram's Parzival fundamentally a Hermetic book? We do not think so. From the germanistic point of view, the particular merits of this study would seem to be (1) the emphasis on the religious development of the hero, with a definition of the individual phases from ignorance to rebirth; (2) the courageous and fruitful discussion of Wolfram's sources (Kyot, Flegetanis). But neither of these merits can conceal the basic lack of conclusive evidence for an unmistakably Hermetic foundation. The so-called parallels are often too general for such evidence, and the spiritual action of Parzi- val, although readily recognized in its significance, could well be regarded in the light of fairly universal, if not archetypal concepts of the course of the hero. Also, too many details of the epic could never be accommodated to Hermetic terms. Even the important contribution to the Kyot problem does not strengthen the Hermetic point; it rather presses it to the extent that William of Tudela, whose affiliation with Hermetic religion could not be estab- lished with certainty, appears as the mediator of "some form of the Corpus Hermeticum in an Arabic version" (p. 154). Finally, there remains one basic objection: If Wol- fram's Parzival were nothing but an esoteric poetical metamorphosis of a body of secret religious doctrines into an Arthurian romance, the greater part of its unique artistic achievement would be overshadowed by the omnipresent allegorical frame of a pagan mystery and consequently reduced to irrelevance. It is not insignificant that the authors completely neglect all aspects of form and struc- ture. These objections should not devaluate the meritorious features of this study. It is a highly original, at times in- genious piece of scholarship with partly very valuable re- sults. It contributes a great deal of background information and, above all, opens a new perspective for exploring the mystical content of Parzival. ERNST S.
