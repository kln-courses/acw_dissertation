ABSTRACT: A PC based interactive program was developed to simulate the unfolding and deploying process of a driver side airbag in the sagittal plane. The airbag was represented by a series of nodes. The maximum allowable stretch was less or equal to one between any two nodes. We assumed that the airbag unfolding was pivoted about folded points. After the completion of the unfolding process the airbag would begin to deploy. During the deploying process, two parameters were used to determine the nodal priority of the inflation. The first parameter was the distance between the instantaneous and final positions of a node. Nodes with longer distances to travel will have to move faster. We also considered the distance between the current nodal position and the gas inlet location. For a node closer to the gas inlet, we assumed that the deploying speed was faster. A graphical procedure was used to calculate the area of the airbag. At each time step, this area was checked against four convergence criteria set up by the user, using an iterative procedure. INTRODUCTION: New Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) require all passenger cars to be equipped with a passive restraint system for both outboard front-seat occupants. Currently, automatic belts and airbag restraints are the only two systems which are being installed to comply with this safety standard. The airbag is being installed in increasing numbers in new cars as a supplemental restraint. The airbag is normally folded in the steering wheel or in the instrument panel. As it inflates, it first breaks out of its protective cover then unfolds and deploys. In about 40 ms, the airbag is fully inflated and actually begins to deflate, to minimize the force of rebound. During deployment, the airbag can interact with the occupant, before it is fully inflated. A full-scale sled or a barrier crash test is essential in the evaluation of any restraint system design. However, because of the high cost of making instrumented tests, the use of mathematical models for the simulation of crash victim dynamics has become a popular supplement to testing. Prasad and Chou (5) recently made an extensive review of crash victim simulation (CVS) general purpose programs. The programs either employ the principle of rigid body dynamics or use the finite element method. Among the programs reviewed, the most popular ones are CAL3D, MVMA2D, MADYMO and PAM-CRASH. CAL3D was originally developed by Dr. Fleck (2) while he was at Calspan Corporation. In the early seventies, the airbag deployment algorithm was integrated into CAL3D. Currently, the US Air Force continues to maintain and upgrade the software and makes it available to the general public. Computer modeling of the airbag restraint performance using CAL3D is an inexpensive means of simulation. In the CAL3D simulation, the airbag is represented by one or more ellipsoidal deformable bodies (9,10). Contact forces are generated when crash victim's body segments come into contact with the airbag. At each time step, a total decrease in volume of the airbag is calculated based on the interaction of the airbag with all of the contacting body segments. After the volume decrease of the bag is computed, ideal gas equations are used in the calculation of the airbag pressure. Corresponding forces and torques are calculated and applied to the various segments. Several successful simulations using CAL3D have been presented (4,7,8,9,10). Unfortunately, the airbag modelling capabilities are presently limited to occupants who contact the bag 1871</page><page sequence="2">after full inflation. fThe so called "out-of-position" occupant and "off-set" impact as well as the passenger side airbag can not be simulated properly. Another simulation program MADYMO using the same rigid body dynamics principle has similar disadvantages (1). Many CVS programs do not have a detailed airbag inflation subroutine to simulate the deployment process because a large amount of effort is needed to simulate the short time interval between impact and full deployment. However, it has to be borne in mind that some small female drivers tend to drive very close to the steering wheel (6). In such an event, airbag unfolding patterns can completely change the contact dynamics between the driver and the airbag. Also, CVS programs generally can only simulate simple geometries such as ellipsoids or planes. It is not feasible to model, for example, a passenger side airbag. Simulation of irregular geometrical shapes is more easily handled by the finite element method. The finite element method is a numerical procedure for obtaining solutions from a mathematical idealization of a real structure. Traditionally, a finite element code is not suitable to simulate rigid body motions such as the inflation of an airbag. Hoffmann et al. (3) developed an airbag algorithm and enhanced the functions of the PAM-CRASH, a finite element computer aided design program. Three-dimensional unfolding and deploying process of a simply folded airbag could be simulated. They also accounted for fabric stretch of the airbag material. Their simulation used the inertial principle to expand the bag by a stepwise increment in pressure. The interaction between a rigid dummy and an airbag was also simulated. Generally speaking, the finite element method requires more computer time, and, unlike CAL3D which is in public domains, programs like PAM-CRASH are not readily available to all potential users. The purpose of this study is to develop a geometric model which can be used with commonly available CVS programs and which can simulate the inflation process and detect an "out-of-position" occupant during all phases of unfolding and deploying. The idea of a nodal representation of an airbag is adapted from the finite element method. Before contacts occur, the unfolding and deploying processes are purely kinematic simulations. An "out-of-position" occupant contact will interfere with these processes. During contact, external forces will compress the airbag until all the elements are fully stretched and a reaction force is generated. At this stage, the model can be transferred to CAL3D or other established programs to obtain the complete occupant response simulation for the rest of the impact. OBSERVATION OF AN AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT Driver and passenger side airbags are normally folded and concealed behind a cover. Figure 1 shows a cross section of an airbag in its folded position. When the inflator is ignited, the airbag begins to unfold before deploying to its final shape. The initial 5 to 15 ms period is called the "unfolding" period. Let us consider the unfolding process using the analogy of the filling of a folded garden hose with water. After the water fills the initial unfolded space, the water pressure starts to increase. When the pressure is large enough, it will open the next folded area. The pressure is released as more space is made available. The process repeats itself until all the folds are opened up. During the process, the pressure-time history has a zigzag shape. For the folded airbag, at the time of gas release (ignition) the inertial effect of the incoming gas and the pressure generated from the explosion blows open the first compartment. Newly generated gas continues to fill the available space until this space is filled. At this time, the internal pressure in this compartment begins to build up. When the force generated from the pressure build up is enough to overcome the weight of the bag material, the folded portion will open up to create additional spaces and to reduce the pressure. The gas is immediately distributed to the newly available space and the pressure is reduced to the ambient level. More incoming gas soon fills the available space and pressure starts to increase again to open up the next fold. The process is repeated until all the folds are unfolded. After that, the airbag begins its deploying process. This process is similar to a group of children, holding hands to form a closed loop and stretching their arms to expand the perimeter to form a prescribed shape. No crossings and shortening of the arms are allowed. The distance between each child's current position and its final position will determine how fast this child has to run in order for all children to reach their final positions at the same time. PRINCIPLE OF NUMERICAL SIMULATION For this preliminary study, we used only the sagittal section of an airbag. There are several known parameters for our numerical simulation including the airbag folding pattern. Figure 1 shows the magnified initial folding pattern of an airbag. When the inflator is ignited, the gas begins to fill up the space between the first two turn-around points. The height of the first compartment is determined by the weight of the still folded portions as well as by 1872</page><page sequence="3">o . r o . i r ^ o 3 " " o o O o o 7 • • O en O &lt;j) " o -? t O) Ē ti o X o " 7 O ° o . , . 7 O 02 O* O O 02- OÎH (můj) A o o - ■ - ¡ - ' - r2 o u - o 10 : 'l :„í 4 L! &gt;s O L!

Using the ideal gas equation: p V = M R T (1) Where p is the pressure inside the bag, V is the instantaneous airbag volume, M is the mass of the gas that has flowed into the bag, R is the gas constant and T is the average temperature in the process. During the short unfolding process, it safe to assume that the variations of p and T are negligible. Hence the time derivative of this equation yields: p dV/dt = RT dM/dt (2) In a two-dimensional model: p dA/dt = R* T dM/dt (3) In which dA is the area increment and R* is a modified gas constant. It can be seen from Equation 3 that the inflation is controlled by the type of inflator or the mass flow rate, dM/dt. Figure 2 shows the mass flow rate from two different inflator designs, from which we can compare the unfolding pattern due to different flow rates. If p is held constant and assumed to be atmospheric in the Equation 3, then the area (volume) increase is a function of mass flow rate into the bag. When the available space is filled, the increase in pressure can be calculated by fixing the area. We can estimate the force required to open up the folds from the weight of the unfolding portions and that needed to overcome the cover. When the product of the pressure and contact area is greater than this estimated force, the folds open up. This process is continued until the unfolding process is complete. Following the unfolding process is the deployment period. We assumed that the internal pressure of the airbag remains at the atmospheric until its maximum volume is reached. Thus, volume change is controlled by the mass flow rate. Pressure can change under two conditions, when the airbag is fully deployed or it is contacted by another object, causing a reduction in volume and an increase in pressure to generate a reaction force. METHODS The two-dimensional airbag simulated was 620 mm in its vertical dimension and 272 mm in depth. The average temperature was 675 K. The folded airbag was represented by nodes connected in a certain pattern, as shown in Figure 1. We assumed that the first unfolding process was pivoted about the turning point C. The outside nodes of the second fold rotated about the turning point while the inside nodes were moved passively by the outside nodes. The allowable area (volume) was increased after the fold was opened. This process was repeated for the remaining folds. Some initial and boundary conditions were needed for the computer simulation. These include: 1 . The final shape of the airbag. 2. The maximum area. 3. The maximum circumference and the final position. 4. The original folding pattern. 5. The mass flow rate. Given these conditions, an iterative algorithm was developed to simulate airbag unfolding and deploying process. We further postulated the following assumptions for the airbag inflation: 1. The elastic effect of the airbag fabric can be neglected in this process. 2. No force is needed to deploy the airbag, i.e., the mass of airbag material is negligible. 3. The inertia effect of the deploying airbag which accounts for "bag slap" can be computed by multiplying the relative nodal position corresponding to the orifice by a weighted coefficient. 4. The internal pressure of the airbag remains at atmospheric until it reaches its final shape if there is no contact, or its surfaces are fully stretched by "out-of-position" contact. 5. An adiabatic process is assumed. Alternatively, an average temperature method can be used (T = constant). 6. The ideal gas equation is used to describe gas thermodynamics. The first three assumptions apply generally to the airbag. The last three assumptions are related to gas thermodynamics. They are the same ones used by Wang and Nefske (8) in their average temperature method. It was verified by Wang (9) in an airbag with ventilation holes and/or small leaks. Unlike blowing up a balloon, the shape of an airbag is irregular during the unfolding and deploying process. Great difficulty was encountered in the calculation of the enclosed area by traditional integration methods. Instead, we developed a graphics program which is capable of calculating the area of any arbitrary enclosed curve. The users first select either a high resolution mode which contains 320 by 240 pixels working space or a high speed mode which has 160 by 100 pixels working space. The program then defines the airbag boundary and subsequently searches and sums up pixels within the closed curve. The area can be calculated from the numbers of pixel and the horizontal and vertical scales. For visual observation, we divided the computer screen into two windows. The left window allows us to observe every iteration while the right window shows the shape of the airbag which satisfies 1874</page><page sequence="5">^ C'J ° i 1 ' 1 1 r s ^ 0 0 ^ p p ID (0 M i - I M- ^ c c ■H H g ô t a ¿ o a / ° ~~ / in / ^ 0 El o &lt;~~ fif ^ o o o o 0 JB / / - - ~ s o m o / m 0 JB 0] fif o ¿ ^ LU Z H o o h - s o o - E i ■ 1 ^ H- ° O'S o ' l O ' O (s/6&gt;ļ) s s v w œ co c O) co 0 *o V_ o &gt;*- ç c Q) 0 îfc "D O B E o TO 0 C CD ■4-» JD O CO 0 c3 w. 5 o »*- co CO CD e o Č c'i 0 '_ D O) Ll 1875</page><page sequence="6">the instantaneous convergence requirements described below. At each time step, the theoretical increment in area was calculated beforehand from the known mass flow rate. Each node was then moved a certain magnitude according to its assumed unfolding and deploying path. We then used an iterative procedure to adjust the nodal positions in order to attain the computed area increment. The iteration procedure was stopped when all the following criteria are satisfied: 1. The maximum discrepancy of the instantaneous area is less than the prescribed one. 2. The distance between any two adjacent points never exceeds the maximum allowable distance (no stretch). 3. No penetration of any node into a segment formed by any pair of nodes is allowed. This criterion is especially important during the unfolding process. 4. The instantaneous circumference never exceeds the final circumference. Only when there is an out-of-position contact, will the airbag reach its maximum circumference instead of its final shape. Based on the magnitude of the area discrepancy, the program adjusted itself in order to speed up convergence each iteration. The completion of the unfolding was based on angles formed by any three adjacent nodes in the rear side of the airbag. This angle can be determined by the user interactively. In this study, we assumed the unfolding process was done when all the angles were greater than 150 degrees. After that, we assumed that every point of the airbag deployd to its final position at the same time if no contact occurred. Hence, the instantaneous speed for each node was a function of the distance between its instantaneous and final positions. This effect was called the geometric effect. Intuitively, the deployment could also be affected by the incoming gas stream. The nodes near by the gas inlet point (orifice) would have to move faster than the nodes far away from the orifice. This effect was called the orifice effect. We used two uneven weighted coefficients to adjust the relative contributions of these two effects. Again, the mass flow rate was the ultimate determinating factor for the magnitude of nodal movements. The only constraint was that no stretch was allowed between any two adjacent nodes. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS Figure 3 compares the unfolding patterns of the airbag due to two different mass flow rates. It is clear that the mass flow rate dominates the speed of the airbag deployment. Otherwise, the unfolding processes are pretty similar in the two simulations. In real life, sliding on the airbag surface is quite possible when there is a contact by an out-of-position occupant. Our program assumes node-on-node nonslip penetration when contact occurs. More works remain to be done to model sliding contact. We have developed this program in order to understand the unfolding and deploying process which last approximately 40 milliseconds. However, the crash pulse of impact is much longer than that. The program is written in such a way as to allow the data to be transferred to established CVS programs such as CAL3D, MYDAMO or PAM-CRASH. Ideally, computational fluid dynamics theory should be used to accurately model the phenomenon. However, as pointed out by Hoffmann et al (3), such an approach requires enormous computational cost. Also, the irregular geometry will reduce the accuracy of this method. We believe our approach produced reasonable answers with minimal computation. This is only a preliminary 2-D simulation. We used compressed air and a targeted beach ball to validate our model. A high speed video was used to detect the movement of the targets. We found the targets overshot its final position then bouced back, very similar to the pattern predicted by our model. For an actual airbag deployment, experimental work is needed to adjust the coefficients and parameters we used. Experience gathered from this two dimensional model will be used to develop a three-dimensional model. For anyone who is interested in this 2-D program, it can be obtained through either of the authors. CONCLUSIONS A two-dimensional airbag inflation model has been developed. It can be used to simulate an airbag with any final shape and any folding pattern. This interactive program utilized the Quick-BASIC graphic language to allow the user to visualize the unfolding, deploying and contact process. Out-of-position contact is simulated.
