We identify energia only indirectly, by its effects: it is manifested in the capacity of certain verbal, aural, and visual trances to produce, shape, and organize collective physical and mental experiences. —Stephen Greenblatt (1988) There is no innocent eye, seeing is an active and not a passive process. —Hans Gerhard Kippenberg (1985–86) Introduction The fifth book of  Semus’ History of Delos (DhliavÍ), dating perhapsfrom the late third century b.c.e., features a certain Parmeniscus fromthe city of  Metapontum in southern Italy, a man distinguished by birth and wealth. Parmeniscus had consulted the oracle of  Trophonius in Lebadeia (Boeotia), a consultation that involved descending into a cave. One of  the well-attested effects of  the oracular procedure at this institution was the (temporary) loss of  the ability to laugh, and Parmeniscus was affected by this very symptom when he resurfaced from the cave.1 He referred to another, even more prominent, oracular institution in search of  a remedy. The priestess Pythia at the Delphic oracle, when approached concerning this matter, re- sponded, e≥r¬ m’ a ̊mfμ gevlwtoÍ, a ̊meÇlice, meilicÇoio: d∫sei soi mhvthr o≥koi: th;n eßxoca t∂e (“You, implacable one, ask me about soothing laughter; the mother will give it to you at home. Honor her greatly”).2 Parmeniscus re- turned to Metapontum, but still did not regain the ability to laugh. Had the oracle deceived him? A little later he happened to travel to the sacred island of  Delos, where he much enjoyed all the marvelous things the island had to offer. He also visited the temple of  Leto, Apollo’s mother, expecting that For Richard Gordon, on the occasion of  his sixty-fifth birthday. 1.

When he realized that the statue was nothing but a misshapen block of  wood he burst out laughing. He understood the meaning of  the oracle and, cured from his malady, he honored the goddess greatly. Unfortunately Semus’ History has not survived. His account of  Parme- niscus has come down to us only indirectly, via the third-century c.e. author Athenaeus, who included the episode in his Deipnosophistae (Ath. 14.614a– b), a loosely conceived collection of  learned tales and fragments of  earlier authors. A critically inclined mind might, of  course, point out that the story, as told by Athenaeus, shows suspicious signs of  literary fashioning. Above all, Parmeniscus’ adventure follows the set pattern of  human misinterpreta- tion of  divine language well known from oracle stories in Greek literature. It also features the revelation of  the meaning of  oracular ambiguity in a not entirely unexpected twist, a topos that features prominently within the oracular genre. Is this perhaps just another etiological story that explains a given dedi- cation, as Felix Jacoby and others have suggested?3 The inventory of  the Letoon of  the year 156/5 b.c.e. mentions a bronze plaque dedicated by a certain Parmiscus, generally believed to be identical with the Parmeniscus of  our story.4 Moreover, the historicity of  Parmeniscus is also attested by Diogenes Laertius (9.20), who describes him in passing as a Pythagorean philosopher. Athenaeus’ account has something interesting to say about Greek per- ceptions of  the divine because of, and not despite, its narrative shaping. As Robert Darnton has pointed out in another context, historical storytelling, like all storytelling, “sets the action in a frame of  reference; it assumes a certain repertory of  associations and responses on the part of  its audience; and it provides meaningful shape to the raw stuff  of  experience.”5 The way in which Athenaeus has framed and presented Parmeniscus’ experience of the divine, it shall be argued here, grants us an invaluable glimpse into Greek representations of  divinity—in both word and wood. Athenaeus’ account shows us that religious visuality is not limited to the physical act of  “look- ing on,” but is part of  a much broader spectrum of  “reading” divine images. At the same time, the story encourages us to expand our definition of  the religious gaze. Religious visuality is not necessarily always ritual-centered visuality, as some scholars have argued. It can also encompass what I shall call “cognitive visuality.” Theoria and the Greek Religious Gaze To start, let us look at the end of  the story: Parmeniscus gazes at the statue of the goddess Leto and, rather unexpectedly (paradovxwÍ), bursts into laughter. Jás Elsner and others have recently established the existence of  a specifi- cally religious way of  viewing in the ancient world.6 This religious gaze, 3. Jacoby 1923, 1358. 4.

This ritual-centered way of  “looking on” is different from other, competing forms of  visuality, most notably, perhaps, from the traditional subject of  Greek art history, the naturalism of  classical mimesis. Religious visuality is not primarily concerned with the aesthetic quality of objects and artifacts; its main focus is on their function in religious ritual. Religious gazing applies whenever a viewer finds himself  face-to-face with a material object (a sanctuary, a temple, a statue) that lends itself  as an entry point to religious and/or mythological reflection. It features prominently in Pausanias’ Description of Greece, for example, which is an account driven by the desire to ground the Greece of  Pausanias’ present in a mythical and divine landscape of  past glory through a focus on material objects.7 But religious visuality also features in a more institutionalized form, as a central aspect of  what Andrea Nightingale has recently referred to as the “cultural practice” of  theoria.8 In his survey of  theoria Ian Rutherford has sketched the semantic spectrum of  this complex concept.9 Theoria and related words (such as qewrovÍ and kata; qewrÇan) could be used in different contexts to refer to “a type of  festival or show,” “being a spectator at a festival,” “a sacred delegation,” “a consultant at an oracle,” “an official sent out to announce festivals,” and “a state official.” More general uses include “sight- seeing” and “exploration.” The core meaning of  the concept, however, seems to revolve around a key set of  elements: theoria typically involved travel (the theoric journey), a sacralized mode of  looking at a specific object or of  watching a theoric event, such as religious games, and, possibly, the return home and the reentry into society with a report of  the things per- ceived and learned.10 There are three typical purposes of  theoria: to visit a religious festival, to consult an oracle, and to undertake a journey for one’s own instruction. While the first two forms can be carried out by an indi- vidual or by a public delegation, the last form exists only as a purely per- sonal experience, of  which Solon’s travels after his reforms at Athens are an obvious example.11 Athenaeus does not explicitly refer to Parmeniscus’ adventures as theoria. In fact, the concept of  theoria is not mentioned at all, and the verb theorein is used only in regard to Parmeniscus’ activity at Delos prior to entering the temple of  Leto. But Athenaeus’ account features, even highlights, key ele- ments of  theoria: the travel to special religious sites, such as oracles and temples, and the gazing on a religious object (the statue). Of  course we do not hear whether Parmeniscus originally traveled to Trophonius on state business, or whether his question concerned religious or other matters, but in Athenaeus’ account it is certainly a deeply private concern that drives 7.

Athenaeus’ account of  Par- meniscus can therefore be read as a sequence of  multiple acts of  personal theoria.12 Parmeniscus’ first trip to the oracular institution of  Trophonius initiates, even necessitates, further contact with the divine. The oracular response he receives at Delphi seems at first to send him back home, but it is not until he has traveled a third time, to the sacred island of  Delos, that he reaches full insight and closure. Parmeniscus’ three acts of  theoria are linked to each other in a complex triangular relationship of  cross-reference and causation. The first two encounters with the gods share the formal identity of  oracle consultations. But it is only when he faces the statue of  Leto that his ability to laugh, a form of  expression that he has lost as a result of  his first encounter with the divine at Trophonius, is restored. In an explosive act of  parallel causation his newly regained ability to laugh brings with it insight into the meaning of  the Delphic oracle. But there are also differences between Parmeniscus’ three encounters with the gods. The first two journeys are intentional acts of  theoria, carried out to gain specific information from the gods. The third, the one that brings final insight, happens “by chance” (kata; tuvchn; Ath. 14.614b) and without his having a specific question in mind. Specifically, the way in which this third encounter with the gods features in the story contributes to the scholarly debate surrounding the problems involved in distinguishing between sacred and secular theoria.13 Parmeniscus’ final journey to Delos starts off  as a case of  secular theoria, directed toward the pure enjoyment of  the island’s touristic sites. Rather unexpectedly, it turns into a form of  religious theoria, when Parmeniscus gains insight into the poetics of  divine representation (in both word and wood) and, in doing so, into the inscrutable ways of  divinity. The story shows that what defines religious theoria is not necessarily where it unfolds, nor on what kind of  objects it is focused, as Rutherford and others have argued.14 Rather, it is defined by a certain form of  (religious) visuality, which is distinguished from other (worldly) ways of  looking on.15 Statues and the Inquiry into Divinity Statues of  Greek gods and goddesses are intriguing elements of  Greek re- ligious discourse. Housed in the temple of  their respective divinity, they represented this divinity in various ritual contexts associated with it. Some- times they were even considered to be identical with it. Once they were ceremoniously installed in their naos, they could become the focus of  in- tense prayer and worship.16 Some statues enjoyed offerings of  food and drink 12. Rutherford (2000, 138–39) refers to Athenaeus’ text in passing as an example of  a story that reports the viewing subject’s response to sacred objects. 13. See more on this below (with references). 14. See Rutherford 2000, 139; 2001, in particular 43–44. 15. At the same time religious theoria is also enacted and embodied in the most worldly and visceral of activities, namely, laughter (see below). 16. See Johnston 2008 on the ritualized animation of  statues. </page> <page sequence="5"> 256 Julia Kindt in their temples and on the altars outside. Others even received specially fabricated garments. Every now and then some statues also left their homes, in order to be carried through their host community in a sacred procession. As Deborah Steiner has pointed out, a statue served “as a vessel, a potential or actual container” for the god or goddess it embodied.17 This conceptualiza- tion of  the divine figure, however, has a profound impact on the production and representation of  statues as well as on their handling in ritual procedure.18 In particular, it raises the all-important question concerning the relationship between the statues’ surface (form) and their divine “content.” Cult statues of  gods and goddesses came in a variety of  forms and styles, negotiating the tension between exterior/form and interior/content in different ways. The act of  imagining and creating a material representation of  the divine in the human sphere was itself  part of  the Greek inquiry into the nature of  divinity. The most fundamental point of  reference in this material(ized) discourse on the nature of  the divine is, of  course, humanity itself. One of  the most in- teresting differences between different types of  statues representing the Greek gods is the extent to which they did or did not resemble the human body.19 While it is tempting to see a strict chronological transition from fairly simple Archaic xoana (cult statues carved out of  wood) to more com- plex anthropomorphic sculptures of  the Classical and later periods, crafted out of  marble, bronze, and ivory, this would be to simplify the complex semiotics of  divine representation in Greek religious discourse.20 While xoana were, even in ancient times, considered to be representative of  an early stage of  sculptural representation of  the Greek gods, they were never fully replaced or superseded by the artistic workmanship of  later periods.21 Iconic modes of  representation coexisted with more simple, semi- or aniconic sculp- tural representations of  the Greek gods.22 The Archaic xoana in particular enjoyed a special ritualistic status during the Classical and Hellenistic periods because of, and not despite, their archaizing qualities.23 New wooden xoana were crafted during the Hellenistic period that explicitly imitated the sim- plicity of  the Archaic xoana.24 Classical scholars have thus come to see different types of  sculptural rep- resentations of  the Greek gods as competing statements concerning the nature of  divinity.25 Semi- and aniconic statues with their cruder and less naturalistic form highlighted the discrepancy between divinity and its material represen- 17.

See Vernant 1991b, 35–36, for the interesting suggestion that Greek anthropomorphism did not imi- tate the human body, but in Greek thought “the human body reflects the divine model as the inexhaustible source of  a vital energy.” 20. In particular, older scholarship has argued for such an evolutionary scheme of  Greek sculptural representation. See, e.g., Richter 1949. See Donohue 1988 and Spivey 1996, 29, for criticism of  such a perspective. 21. See Donohue 1988 for a comprehensive century-by-century account of  the significance of  xoana. 22.

They virtually compelled the viewer to acknowledge the vessel-like quality of  the statue and the very fact that humanity can engage with divinity only in a mediated fashion. “Concealment and containment . . . form two dimen- sions of  the single enterprise: in assuming a form or body not his or her own, the god simultaneously masks and contains an untenable force.”26 Form and content did not cohere. The aniconic statue revealed the presence of  divinity, but it did so not by imitating the human body, but via a “container” that, through its crude form, captured and communicated the insurmountable gap separating the human from the divine sphere. By contrast, iconic sculptural representation of  divinity negotiated the tension between material form and divine content along different lines. The point here was to externalize the divine essence that the Archaic xoanon sought to conceal and to make it represent the otherworldliness of  the divine.27 The literary sources describing iconic sculpture abound in words expressing the shining radiance of  artistic workmanship. Materials such as gold, silver, bronze, and marble were used to bring out the otherworldly quality of  the gods in the very fabric of  their cult images.28 In the fifth century b.c.e., this form of  religious imagination and artistic workmanship saw its culmination in the famous chryselephantine statues, which featured golden robes draping the ivory bodies of  the divine that were fabricated around a wooden core.29 Statues like Pheidias’ acclaimed Zeus at Olympia (430 b.c.e.) and his Athena Parthenos on the Acropolis (440– 430 b.c.e.) did not just aspire to imitate the human bodily form, they fre- quently exceeded it not just in size (a feature also of  many older xoana), but also by turning the divine statue into something more perfect and gleaming than the human body. The agalma of  the god or goddess was both a dedi- cation to divinity and a representation and an evocation of  it, “glorious gifts in which the gods must also delight.”30 What does Parmeniscus see when he enters the temple of  Leto? Of  course we cannot know. Although the Letoon at Delos has been excavated by the French, the wooden statue of  the goddess had perished long before. But perhaps we can at least get an idea if  we look more carefully at what re- mains of  the temple and its owner. Cult statues, like the one of  the goddess Leto at Delos, were not just stashed away in some dark corner. They were typically placed on a pedestal in the middle of  the naos. Excavations at Delos have revealed the foundations of  the base on which Leto’s statue was placed, and from these foundations, which measured from 2.50 to 2.90 meters, we can infer that the statue was probably considerably larger than life-size.31 26.

This gleaming quality is sometimes also captured in white paint in depictions of statues on vases; see Schefold 1937, 66. 31. Romano 1980, 204. It is, of  course, also a possibility that a second pedestal with a much smaller statue was placed upon the foundations. </page> <page sequence="7"> 258 Julia Kindt Moreover, the very temple inventory of  the Letoon that mentions Parmiscus’ dedication (IDélos 1417 AI, 100–117) also provides a variety of  informa- tion on the cult statue. From the inscription we learn that Leto was indeed made of  wood, that she was clothed in a linen chiton and mantle, and that she was wearing sandals. We also read that she was seated on a wooden throne featuring tortoiseshell and ivory inlay.32 Intriguingly, the inventory refers to the statue as an agalma. In the account of  Athenaeus, however, her aniconic features are highlighted. All we hear about the statue’s appearance is that she was “just a misshapen piece of  wood” (xuvlon aßmorfon). Is Semus setting up the reader (who might know the statue by sight or by hearsay) just as much as Parmeniscus, his main protagonist? All we can say with cer- tainty is that for the purpose of  the story it seems to matter that Leto’s “looks” are, quite literally, presented as disappointing. Experience and Expectation When Parmeniscus crosses the threshold of  the temple of  Leto and looks at the statue of  the goddess, he enters a distinctly religious space. But in Athenaeus’ account he does not seem to find what he expected. The shape and quality of  the larger-than-life statue seem to direct Parmeniscus’ gaze to its crude materiality, rather than to its role as a representation of  divinity. The aesthetic dimension of  the statue (or rather, the lack of  it), at least at first sight, seems to deny it any role as the focal point of  religious discourse. Parmeniscus expected to find an agalma, a glorious and dazzling representa- tion of  Apollo’s mother: nomÇzwn thÅÍ ÂpovllwnoÍ mhtro;Í aßgalmav ti qewrhvsein a ̊xiovlogon (“He expected that the statue of  Apollo’s mother would be some- thing noteworthy,” Ath. 14.614b). What he found instead was an unsightly statue that alluded to the human bodily form, the wooden origins of  which were still all too visible: √døn d’ au ̊to; xuvlon o ̇n aßmorfon paradovxwÍ ejgevlasen (“But when he saw that it was just a misshapen piece of  wood he unexpect- edly burst into laughter,” Ath. 14.614b). In depicting the clash between Parmeniscus’ expectation of  the divine and his experience of  it, Athenaeus’ account reflects the tension between traditional aniconic and later iconic representations of  divinity. Elsner has rightly pointed out that “viewing the sacred is a process of divesting the spectator of  all the social and discursive elements which dis- tinguish his or her subjectivity from that of  the gods into whose space the viewer will come.”33 Religious visuality unfolds in and defines a distinctly religious space in which the experiences and expectations of  everyday life are temporarily set aside to enable a more immediate encounter with the divine, an encounter that follows its own (religious) rules and regulations. “Ritual-centred visuality denies the appropriateness of  . . . interpreting images through the rules and desires of  everyday life.”34 32. More information on Leto’s possessions appears in later epigraphic evidence: for example, that her himation was adorned with purple dye in the third century b.c.e. (see Romano 1980, 203). 33.

Elsner 2007, 25. </page> <page sequence="8"> Parmeniscus’ Journey 259 Parmeniscus’ experience at Delos, as told by Athenaeus, highlights the very moment of  “divesting” as a precondition of  experiencing the true nature of  the divine. The story hinges on the sudden, almost explosive transition Parmeniscus undergoes from a state of  ignorance to a state of  insight and learning. Parmeniscus first appreciates the island’s attractions from a purely aesthetic point of  view. The word used to describe his gaze prior to entering the temple of  Leto is thaumazein, “to wonder, to marvel at.” When Parme- niscus finally enters the temple, he extends this aesthetic visuality to the statue of  the goddess. But the statue of  Leto does not provide a trajectory for the aesthetic gaze. It redirects this gaze back to the viewing subject. The surprise springing from the apparent drastic mismatch between his expectation of  the divine statue and its actual manifestation triggers Parmeniscus’ laughter. In doing so it prepares Parmeniscus for the transition from an externalized gaze, focused on the surface of  things and on the ornamental, to a much deeper religious visuality, based on an aesthetics that appreciates the vessel- like quality of  the statue. The purely external appreciation of  aesthetic qual- ities turns into a deeper, more penetrating and complex vision focused on the quality of  divinity, in particular of  divine representation. This form of thaumazein does not precede the form of  understanding reached through theoria, but is part of  the theoric gaze.35 Parmeniscus’ laughter, we can sus- pect, changes in quality as it becomes self-reflective.36 It starts off  as a naïve and unreflective response to the apparent crudeness of  divine form. It turns into an astonished appreciation of  the complexities of  divine representation as Parmeniscus understands the meaning of  the oracle. What is interesting about Athenaeus’ account is that it draws direct and multiple links between representations of  divinity in word and in wood. The story directly juxtaposes the ambiguous oracle Parmeniscus receives at Delphi with the statue of  Leto and its way of  signification: the temporary breakdown of  divine representation (the statue) brings about the revelation of  divine meaning (the oracle). The story highlights the visual aspect of theoria as a cultural institution, but at the same time, it draws our attention to the very fact that religious visuality extends far beyond the physical act of gazing. For oracles, too, draw on elements of  pictorial signification. In the metaphors and other tropes they use as carriers (vessels) of  their meaning, oracles make use of  images in much the same way as divine statues do. The link between the semantics of  both types of  imagery is reflected through the perception of  the viewing subject. Parmeniscus responds to both representations of  divinity in the very same fashion. His encounters with the divine are driven by his expectations concerning the nature of  divinity, in particular of  divine representation in the human sphere. Parmeniscus expects oracles to speak in human language. Human language is characterized by the attempt to minimize ambiguity in order to maximize success in information 35. On thaumazein as part of  theoria, see Nightingale 2004, 261. 36. Halliwell (2008, 5) speaks of  the “double-sided character” of  laughter in Greek thought and litera- ture “at the interface between . . . body and mind, between instinct and intention.” In Athenaeus’ account, laughter appears likewise as a double-sided gesture that accompanies, even instigates, the transition from a state of  ignorance to a state of  insight. </page> <page sequence="9"> 260 Julia Kindt processing. Except, perhaps, in poetic language, which explicitly draws on polysemy, in the human sphere, ambiguity is nothing but a semantic possi- bility prior to its realization in actual speech. The fact that Parmeniscus is not yet ready to engage in this other type of  visuality that is, at least to some extent, disengaged from personal circumstance, is nicely expressed by the very fact that he can conceive of  the “mother” featuring in the oracular re- sponse as referring to his own mother only. Religious visuality involves a much broader and more detached way of  “reading” images. Just as Parmeniscus expects the oracle to speak in plain human language, he assumes that divine statues represent divinity in human form. Both ex- pectations are frustrated in the end. Parmeniscus’ first response is to suspect deception (o√ovmenoÍ ejxhpathÅsqai, “he believed that he had been deceived,” Ath. 14.614a). This suspicion is typical of  those mortals in Greek thought and literature who cannot (yet) read the poetics of  divine representation.37 Jean-Pierre Vernant speaks of  the “inevitable tension” that all forms of  divine representation must introduce: “The idea is to establish real contact with the world beyond, to actualize it, to make it present, and thereby to participate intimately in the divine; yet by the same move, it (the divine idol) must also emphasize what is inaccessible and mysterious in divinity, its alien quality, its otherness.”38 Parmeniscus does not yet understand the subtle balance be- tween identity and alterity that every divine representation must strike to remain a meaningful mediator between the human and divine spheres. Par- meniscus eventually learns to adopt a much deeper gaze, which penetrates the surface of  verbal and material images in order to capture what lies beneath. In visualizing Parmeniscus’ change of  perspective the story draws attention to larger questions concerning the identity of  divinity and its representation in the human sphere. It is significant that Parmeniscus learns that the gods are and are not like mortals by gazing at two images that both challenge and support the anthropomorphism of  the Greek gods. The oracular reference to Leto as Apollo’s mother confirms the idea that the pantheon, indeed, is structured in parallel to the human sphere, with its family and other rela- tions. Parmeniscus’ subsequent encounter with the wooden statue of  Apollo’s mother, in contrast, seems to relativize the notion of  anthropomorphic gods by drawing attention to the image’s (wooden) materiality. In making the connection between imagery crafted in word and in wood, the story encourages us to compare both forms of  divine representation.39 Plain oracular language and iconic sculptures of  gods and goddesses pro- vide a way of  representing divinity that emphasizes the likeness between the human and divine spheres. Both forms of  divine representation are oriented toward humanity as the ultimate point of  reference for the visualization and imagination of  the divine. Ambiguous divine language and the semi-iconic representation of  divinity, in contrast, direct attention to the fact that divinity 37. See, e.g., Croesus’ complaint at the Delphic oracle in Herodotus 1.90–91 and the Chorus’ suspicions toward the Delphic response in Euripides Ion 685. 38. Vernant 1991a, 153. See also Vernant 1991d, 314–17. 39. Vernant (1991a, 154) argues that Archaic idols are not images stricto sensu. </page> <page sequence="10"> Parmeniscus’ Journey 261 is and is not like humanity. According to the same logic, unintelligible sounds and utterances and the aniconic representation of  divinity finally emphasize alterity and the insurmountable gap that exists between gods and mortals. It is significant that the breakdown in the iconic sculptural representation of the statue brings about the insight into the ambiguous meaning of  the oracle. In juxtaposing both forms of  divine representation, Athenaeus’ account turns around much more than the simple point that images represent divinity in a way that may look surprisingly different from first sight. Parmeniscus’ en- counter with the gods defines religious visuality as a complex way of  engaging with the divine, which interacts with humanity in different and changing representations. Through its narrative appropriation of  the religious gaze, Athenaeus’ story reflects on the very semantics of  religion as a discourse of  “making sense.” The subject’s gaze on the divine statue becomes itself  a trope for reflection on the nature of  divinity and its relationship to humanity.40 Parmeniscus’ encounter with the divine turns into a commentary on the modalities of  re- ligious visuality.41 By referring to generally recognized religious authorities like the Delphic oracle, the story also gives a certain kind of  authority to the religious statements it makes in this respect. Religious Visuality as “Ritual-Centered Visuality” and “Cognitive Visuality” Elsner has recently defined religious viewing as a ritual-centered form of visuality.42 Religious gazing conceives of  sacred objects, such as altars and cult statues, by appreciating, even insisting on, the role these objects play in religious ritual. In other words, the religious gaze captures predominantly those qualities of  altars and cult statues that are significant for the part they play in religious ritual; other information pertaining to these objects that is not relevant to the way in which they feature in ritual, such as their aesthetic qualities, is left out. Elsner has further explored the ways in which religious gazing features in Greek literature. He has shown that the narrative structure of  a text itself  can follow (and hence describe) the physical act of  gazing. A prime example is Pausanias’ description of  sixty-nine altars at Olympia, which closely follows the liturgical order of  the Elean sacrificial procession and which highlights those features of  the altars that are relevant for their role in ritual.43 Athenaeus’ account, however, suggests that religious visuality should not be limited to ritual-centered visuality. In fact, ritual is conspicuously absent from Parmeniscus’ multiple encounters with the divine. We hear nothing 40. It is interesting that this story is built around Parmeniscus, a philosopher, as theoria (albeit more frequently in its civic form) was widely appropriated in philosophical discourse as a trope for understand- ing and learning (Nightingale 2004). 41.

Nor do we learn anything about the kind of  purifications, sacrifices, and prayers involved in the worship of  the goddess Leto at Delos. Instead, the story focuses on the impact of  the statue on the viewing subject, in particular on the gap be- tween its form and content that Parmeniscus needs to bridge. The structure of Athenaeus’ narrative turns entirely on the change of  perspective Parmeniscus undergoes as he learns to appreciate the nature of  divinity: his original ex- pectation of  divine representations that remains unfulfilled, his interpreta- tive disengagement from his own personal circumstances, and his insight into the versatility of  divinity and divine representation. In Athenaeus’ narra- tive at least, religious visuality is represented as a mental (cognitive) activity and not as a mere extension of  ritual. Religious gazing, we can conclude, should encompass both cognitive visuality and ritual-centered visuality— without, of  course, assuming a strict duality between the two. In tracing Parmeniscus’ change of  perspective, the story makes an inter- esting point about the problematic relationship between the sacred and the secular dimensions.44 One area in which this distinction is currently discussed is with regard to theoria and Greek pilgrimage more generally.45 Is it possible to distinguish sacred from secular (purely recreational) sightseeing? Ruther- ford suggests that whenever the places visited were religious centers we should speak of  “sacred sightseeing.”46 He further argues that the kind of  objects viewed may also help to differentiate sacred sightseeing from the secular variant. Religious objects were prime foci of  religious travel. For Rutherford their presence can hence serve as a prime marker of  theoria as sacred sight- seeing: “Because the viewing of  them took place against the background of  a network of  religious assumptions it can be described as a religious activity.”47 The passage from Athenaeus, however, complicates the story. It shows that neither the presence of  religious space nor that of  religious objects is a necessary indicator of  religious viewing. Parmeniscus employs both types of  visuality, religious visuality and another, more worldly, kind of  viewing (which, for lack of  a better word, one might want to call secular), spatially within strictly religious contexts such as the Delphic oracle and the temple of  Leto. Moreover, he extends both types of  visuality to distinctly religious representations: just as he misreads the oracle at Delphi, he at first looks at the divine statue in the temple with an aesthetic gaze. Parmeniscus’ first way of  looking is shaped less by religious than by worldly assumptions. What 44. The communis opinio now seems to be that Greek culture knew no absolute distinction between the two. Connor (1988) has shown the sacred and the secular to be two separate yet interrelated realms. Disagreement, however, then erupts concerning the way in which this relationship features in specific con- texts (see Scullion 2005). 45. See, e.g., Rutherford 2000; Elsner and Rutherford 2005, 21–22; Scullion 2005. As Rutherford (2000, 138 n. 26) has rightly observed, the visual is strangely absent from Dillon’s (1997) account of Greek pilgrimage. 46. Rutherford 2000, 135. See also the interesting sociological contribution of  Cohen (1992), who argues that pilgrims travel to the center of  their world and tourists to the periphery. 47. Rutherford 2000, 139. </page> <page sequence="12"> Parmeniscus’ Journey 263 finally enables him to make the transition from one type of  visuality to the other is his capacity to divest his interpretation from his own personal circum- stances. In Athenaeus’ account, at least, the distinction between the sacred and the secular (here expressed in the form of  different, yet related, types of visuality) is neither spatially configured nor object related, but cognitive. The frame of  mind with which one enters a given space and looks at a spe- cific object determines whether religious visuality (and hence information processing) applies or not. In short, it matters less what one looks at, or where one looks, but how. University of Sydney LITERATURE CITED Bill, C. P. 1901. Notes on the Greek Theoros and Theoria. TAPA 32: 196–204.
