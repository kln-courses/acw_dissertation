<plain_text><page sequence="1">28 A shrine-model from Galatas Georgios Rethemiotakis In one of his most influential studies on Minoan religion, Peter Warren presented evidence and set out the principles for evaluating the early stages of appearance of the Minoan goddess figure.1 This was made possible after the discovery of the famous figurine of the goddess of Myrtos (frontispiece), which 35 years after its publication still remains the earliest known figure of a household goddess, i.e. a goddess replica in clay placed in a small domestic shrine, apparently invested with protective and fertilising qualities for the sustenance of life and the procurement of staples. Similar features embodied in the standardised form of the goddess with upraised arms are to be encountered in much later times. Yet, despite progress in the excavation field, very little has been added to fill the considerable time span between the earliest version of the Prepalatial goddess image, excavated at Myrtos, and the much later cultic figures worshipped in the Postpalatial community shrines. Although similarities are obvious and many urban shrines — deserving this title with more or less probability — exist in both palatial periods, in not a single case has the replica of an anthropomorphic deity with diagnostic features regarding posture and attributes been reported among the cultic equipment uncovered in them.2 A find made during the 2007 excavation season at Galatas now contributes to the quest for the missing figure of the household goddess and helps to bridge the time span between the early and the later versions of the goddess figure. The first presentation of this new find is cordially dedicated to Professor Peter Warren, the eminent scholar, colleague and personal friend, whose pioneering work in so many fields of research has profoundly affected all aspects of Minoan studies. The object has the form of a rectangular single-room model,3 housing a seated figure (FIGS. 28.1-11). It comes from Building 6, a large mansion SW of the palace. This building, partly excavated in the 2007 season, yielded evidence for two construction phases, the earliest dating to MM IIIA and the latest in LM IA-B. Most of the excavated area is taken up by a Minoan Hall or polythyron with five door partitions and a column in front, belonging to the later phase. The early phase includes a lustral basin and some additional spaces to the west of the Minoan Hall, as well as another area east of the hall apparently intended for religious use. Its exterior walls and terraces inside incorporated in places the natural bedrock and surround a rectangular inner compartment with plastered floor. The NW corner of the inner space is occupied by a stone-built construction partly overlaid by the north wall of the Minoan Hall. A stone-lined cavity in the upper surface must have served as a receptacle of liquids as proven by the fragments of a jug found inside. The area around was packed with numerous broken vases and vessels of various shapes. Most were utilitarian types, but others were of undeniably religious function, such as miniature cups and an amphora, conical cups with perforated bases, obviously for discharging liquids, a cylindrical tube, a fragmentary rectangular stand or model with painted hanging semicircles, two anthropomorphic and four animal figurines of medium size. Some fine ware sherds, particularly of cylindrical cups with ribbed walls and thin-walled post-Kamares globular cups, provide secure dating in MM IIIA. In all likelihood the area was used as a domestic shrine with ritual activity focusing on the built structure. It was abandoned during MM III, certainly before the construction of the Minoan Hall, whose east wall was constructed over the altar-like structure. Yet the most explicit evidence for the cultic function of this space derives from the shrine-model, which was found therein and assembled from fragments that were scattered across the westward-sloping side of the natural rock. Fortunately most joining fragments were Warren 1973, 137-47. Marinatos 1993, 98-104. For the characterisation see Schoep 1994, 194,208. She cites two models in this category, yet from the description that follows, the very existence of the type appears to be rather problematic. That from Monastiraki Amari is rectangular with flat roof, doors and windows. It seems, however, that it is the upper part of a larger and more complex construction including a lower floor or enclosure. The other, found at Menelaion Sparta, is square in plan yet fragmentary and incomplete. Its Minoan origin is disputable. [Ed. note: for the Menelaion model see now, H. W.

The shrine-model, three-quarter front view (without the cover). shaped before firing (FIGS. 28.7-8, 10). They end up in a projecting outwards rim. The ledge represents a real, structural element in architecture: the cornice, i.e. a projecting course of ashlar blocks marking the roof level as may be seen in the model from Archanes.5 A strip of clay running along the outer edge of the rim's upper surface, reveals the existence of a cover, which would rest on the inner side of the rim and be kept in place by the projecting moulding. This feature indicates that the model was roofed and that its roof was movable. To this belongs a single fragment preserving its edge that matches the rim's inner contour (FIG. 28.3 d). Fragments of two horns of consecration made of the same clay were also recovered from that spot. Though 90% of the roof was lost, as also was the horizontal part of the horns, there can be no doubt that these were attached somewhere along the roof's edge, most probably in the front part over the entrance surmounting the fagade as attested in pictorial representations.6 Accordingly their restoration in plaster took account of such two-dimensional renditions of religious facades, as well as another recently discovered circular model of the same date from the peak sanctuary of Gournos Krousonas with horns of consecrations stuck on the eave over the entrance.7 In that way the model becomes replica of a shrine which houses the goddess image. The goddess figurine (FIGS. 28.8-11) sits directly opposite the entrance on a slab-shaped seat with roughly wavy outline and raised border, which is Fig. 28.5. The shrine-model, view from above (without the cover). positioned close to the back wall (fig. 28.6 a-c). Its upper side is modelled with a shallow depression to accommodate the figure's buttocks. The wall of the model, on which the figure's shoulders lean (FIG. 28.5) serves as the seat's back. Hence the figure appears in a reclining posture (figs. 28.10-11), rendering it visible in its entirety through the door. For the same reason it has the head tilted forwards with the face in an upright position, as if 'facing' those standing opposite. The face is schematically rendered with pinched sides. It is surmounted by a lunate applique, apparently a hair-band or a diadem. The modelling of the body is careless, the volumes rendered in a schematic and disproportionate fashion. The only indication of sex are the slack breasts, a graphic demonstration of ageing, perhaps also indicated by the slack yet bulging belly. The gesture of the arms to the belly was probably intended to lay emphasis on this particular part of the body, as directly linked to fertility and possibly the state of pregnancy. 5 Lebessi 1976, 28-9, pis. 6-12, figs. 4-7.

The foot-stool, front. Fig. 28.6. The seat: a) front; b) back; c) from above. Fig. 28.7. The foot-stool, front. The legs are rendered bare. This is not to be taken as an indication of nudity; it is rather a convention for seated figurines, as attested at a number of them dating from the MM times down to the Protogeometric period.8 The stumpy legs rest on a high footstool (FIG. 28.7). This feature is of particular importance, as suggested by the relevant iconography. It links seated or enthroned female figures with a divine or priestly status,9 which must also be the case for the figure sitting inside the model. The exceptional significance of the figure justifies the enlargement of the door opening so as to reveal it fully. To understand further the function of the model we have to restore the door panel that originally existed along with the opening and closing mechanism aimed at controlling visibility of the inner space. The existence of the door panel is indicated by the two clay protuberances in the upper and lower corner at the left side of the opening (FIGS. 28.1, 2,4). Albeit broken off and worn due to the soft texture of clay, the lower one still preserves a faint trace of a vertical perforation. This is the remains of the socket into which the door pivot, possibly a wooden stick, originally rotated (as reconstructed in FIG. 28.12 a-b). Fitting the other end of the stick into a corresponding hole in the upper protuberance would allow the panel to turn around the vertical axis and permit opening and closing at will. An intact parallel for this working mechanism may be seen at a house- or shrine-model from Elam.10 In that specific case the clay door panel imitates woodwork and the pivots turn in similar clay loops, placed above and below. What clearly emerges is that the mechanism copies a real and functional application in architecture, and this must also be the case for the example from Galatas. The fragility of the pivot holders may be an indication that the door panel was a thin piece of wood. Evidence of how the door was closed is provided by the two small holes in the wall at the right side of the opening (FIGS. 28.1,2,4). These must be the holes into which two pins, fitted in the panel, were inserted, thus securing the door upon closing (see the reconstruction of the door panel in FIGS. 28.12 a-b). The measures taken to control the door's closing and opening, as well as to keep it securely closed, were apparently intended to prevent untimely exposure of its interior and thus to enhance the effect created by Davaras 1976, fig. 138; Rethemiotakis 1998, 185: 'xaBiaxd eiScoiUa' pis. 1: 122, 8: 72, 84: 203, 77: 174; Dimopoulou Rethemiotaki 2005, 363 (the figurine in the circular 'house-model' from Archanes, originally in the Giamalakis Collection). The most elaborate case is that of the enthroned goddess on the Tiryns ring: CMS I no. 179. Footstools are represented twice in wall paintings. One fragment from Pylos shows the feet of a 'priestess' and the left side of a piece with bolster ends, apparently an elaborate footstool (Lang 1969, 85 n. 50, pi. 31 D, N). The second comes from Mycenae. It depicts a n-shape footstool under the feet of a priestly figure (Kritseli Providi 1982, 42-3, pi. 6b). Elaborate and costly examples with various inlays and fittings, accompanied by ideograms, are listed in Linear B tablets from Pylos (Ventris 1955, 109— 24). On the interpretation of the composition of ivory plaques from Tomb A at Archanes Phourni as inlays of a footstool see Sakellarakis and Sapouna-Sakellarakis 1997, 721-7.

Possibly this would be the nodal point of an epiphany ritual involving the sudden appearance of the goddess or her impersonator to the believers.11 Following the logic of a staged epiphany, a relevant point has been made for the parallel type of the circular 'hut' model.12 According to this view, the raison d'etre for this much-discussed type of model was to create an effective mechanism for concealing and revealing the goddess figurine by closing and opening its door. This proposal now gains more substance in light of the Galatas model. Indeed, the two essential functional features of'hut' models are both attested here and, furthermore, date to the early Neopalatial period. This is crucial in the development of elaborate religious patterns, with epiphany evidently the most prominent to judge from iconography.13 In this instance, the effect of epiphany is produced by the door closing and opening device, which allowed controlled visibility of the goddess figurine inside. More evidence on this issue came to light in the excavation of a looted peak sanctuary at Gournos Krousonas a few years ago.14 Among other objects that escaped looting some fragments of the circular-'hut' model, referred to above, similar in form to the later examples, were retrieved. Despite its fragmentary condition, its restoration in a drawing proved possible. The pottery collected from the site provides a secure MM III A date for the model, that is, contemporary with the Galatas example. The models share common features: they come from an undeniably religious context — the first belonging to the cultic equipment of a peak sanctuary and the second to a domestic shrine. Both have door openings and, in addition, horns of consecration attached to the eave and the roof, re spectively, above the entrance. Of utmost importance for the interpretation of the Gournos model, and its relation to Galatas example, is the fact that a seated female figurine had also been placed inside it; a head of a female figurine made of the same clay and part of a seat, derived from the same spot as the rest of the fragments, confirms the proposed combination. Now the Galatas model comes to lend more support to the arguments concerning the form and function of the Gournos model. To judge from the evidence now provided by the two examples, there is good reason to believe that both types were created in the same time to meet certain religious demands; yet over time, for unknown reasons, the circular type prevailed as proved by the long series of circular models dating from LM III A to the Proto geometric period. The linchpin between them is the emblematic figure of the seated goddess, which features in the earliest and latest examples, i.e. in the MM III A and PGB shrine-models from Galatas and Archanes.15 This is the so-called enacted or dramatised aspect of epiphany: Hagg 1986, 41-62; Niemeier 1986, 71-92. Especially in Hagg and Marinatos 1991, 301-08. Also Hagg 1990, 95-107; Mercereau 1993, 17-21. Hagg 1986; Warren 1988 passim; Dimopoulou and Rethemiotakis 2000, 50-6. Rethemiotakis 2009, 189-99. See above n. 8.</page><page sequence="9">A SHRINE-MODEL FROM GALATAS While the seated goddess in an outdoor setting is well attested in Neopalatial iconography,16 the two models clearly indicate that such epiphanies also took place in roofed spaces, despite the fact that no pictorial evidence exists. In addition, the broader Levantine region offers some good examples of shrine-models dating in the second millennium BC.17 They illustrate divinities inside rectangular or apsidal models thought to represent the cella or inner sanctuary in temple compounds, their form also being manifested in temple architecture. In my view there is no specific reason to postulate a direct Levantine influence. It seems more reasonable to assume, on account of the evidence provided by the models from Galatas and Gournos, that such concepts were in accordance with a broader spectrum of religious thought concerning the housing of the divine image in a permanent locus of cult to be approachable in an orderly fashion by the faithful. On the existing evidence, it seems that in the Neopalatial period the ritual of divine revelation became an elaborate public ceremony, a sort of religious drama with theatrical characteristics involv ing the 'goddess' — evidently represented by a priestess in her stead — appearing in a seated posture. Concurrently divine revelation seems to have taken a prominent place in cult enacted in roofed spaces with the goddess appearing in full grandeur in a ceremonial attitude, i.e. her feet resting on a footstool, as illustrated in the Galatas model (and possibly the one from Gournos). Positioning the goddess within her shrine entails the transference of a familiar iconographic formula within the domain of ritual practised indoors. Furthermore, the perception of housing the goddess and placing her on an elevated seat of honour paves the way towards the formation of the cultic idol. Standing on a bench, the replica of her holy image, the receiver of perpetual worship was to become a dominant feature in cult in the Postpalatial community shrines. In its temporal and notional setting, therefore, the Galatas model seems to give substance to the concept of enacted epiphany in the household context. It encapsulates an image of its time, but it also integrates past forms of domestic worship, particularly those pictorially and notionally expressed through the emblematic figure of the goddess of Myrtos. In parallel, it heralds the subsequent stages of evolution in Minoan religion, when the goddess idol eventually predominates. By picturing the ideal, most powerful figure in cult, i.e. the goddess sitting on a fixed seat, concealed in the darkness of her shrine and waiting to reveal herself in solemnity, the model commemorates a ritual instance. And, as a frozen image transcending time, it also functions as a symbol and a permanent testimony of faith for those who reverentially deposited the model of her sanctuary.
