<plain_text><page sequence="1">COMMENTS AND CRITICISM A REPLY TO PROFESSOR MANDELBAUM's NOTE 1 IN a recent issue of this JOURNAL a defense was made for anthropo- morphism in animal psychology. The author held that if it were not given full status, then the field would find itself in the paradoxi- cal position of denying that which it works so hard to establish, namely, behavioral continuity in the animal kingdom. It seems to me that Professor Mandelbaum has established his position through a basic misconception of his victim 's stand, a misunderstanding of scientific method, and by the creation of a straw man; he has not only missed the correct boat, but he has taken one that sailed eighty years ago. 1 Maurice Mandelbaum, "A Note on 'Anthropomorphism' in Psychology,&gt;" this JOURNAL, Vol. XL (1943), pp. 246-248.</page><page sequence="2">COMMENTS AND CRITICISM 375 Our author has attacked the one-way status of psychological explanation, which he feels is the dominant note in modern animal work. This attack is based upon the belief that the categories which he proposes are valid for man and therefore applicable to infra-humans. "What I am concerned to point out is the fact that concepts whose meaning is clear in the field of human experience may often be legitimately used in understanding animal behavior" (p. 248). (Certainly the author's example-shame-is not a very clear concept in human psychology.) This is precisely where the author has made his error, for a good portion of our modern psy- chologists believe that many of these categories are invalid even for man, and, therefore, if these terms are anthropomorphic, that there is no place for anthropomorphism in human psychology. In a recent article, Duffy 2 suggested a new orientation to the modern categories of psychology; she believes that these categories are a historical hangover which do nothing but create confusion and ob- scurity. The outcome of her position, to interpret, is a system of terms and principles applicable to both humans and the lowest forms-applicable because they are functional and sufficiently ab- stract. This is what modern psychology is attempting to do; 3 far from creating insuperable barriers it has attempted to break down those set up by its mentalistic predecessors. It is the express belief of the new behaviorism that the same principles and terminology should be applicable to both humans and infra-humans whenever possible; 4and this belief is based upon an early recognition of the subject of Professor Mandelbaum 's lesson-the meaning of sim- plicity. I frankly know of no modern objective psychologists who 2 Elizabeth Duffy, "The Conceptual Categories of Psychology: A sug- gestion for revision," Psychological Review, Vol. 48 (1941), pp. 177-203. 3 It is significant that many ' animal" psychologists are greatly interested in human psychology and spend considerable time investigating it. They see no basic differences and test hypotheses derived from one form upon another with no compunction. C. L. Hull, for instance, seems to work equally well with rats or humans, using the same principles wherever applicable. 4 Professor Mandelbaum seems to be misinformed as to the nature of a scientific theory. His main point seems to be that " It is paradoxical [the conflict] because it holds that we can understand human behavior in terms of animal behavior and yet that we can not understand animal behavior in terms which are familiar to us through our observations of human beings" (p. 246). No scientific theory attempts to understand one behavior in terms of another. There may be a science of analogy, but not an analogical science. The be- haviors observed serve only one function in a theory and that is to aid in the f ormulation of principles. Behavior is understood only in the light of prin- ciples, implicit or explicit, which describe the interrelation between the phe- nomena observed. Any other way would lead to an encyclopedic collection of facts which might be interesting, but would not constitute a theory of be- havior.</page><page sequence="3">376 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY would claim the position ascribed to them "en masse" by our author. There have been many studies which have demonstrated that the modern categories of feelings, emotions, and sentiments are very ambiguous ones and far from universally identifiable by different observers. They are very much conditioned by specific types of culture. Working with photographs and real life situations, judges asked to determine what emotion or feeling was being depicted have invariably disagreed; agreement only follows a very complex proce- dure which is quite impossible for animal psychology, including as it does the verbal report. How, then, can we expect to apply these terms to infra-humans with any profit when their status in human psychology is far from being determined. The author 's selection of shame is therefore an unfortunate choice; had he selected some other "phenomenon" he might have made a better case. As it is, his discussion of shame seems mean- ingless. It is a throwback to faculty psychology wherein we have an "ego," one of whose faculties is that of shame. This faculty is a constant companion and only the "when" of its occurrence is determined by the particular history of the individual and the environmental forces which have affected him. How the author proceeds from the argument that shame is affected by "social condi- tioning" only in the occasional sense to the statement that we must admit the existence of the "same" phenomenon in animals, is un- clear. "Shame" is known only when it occurs and criteria for its appearance must still be established; these criteria must be the same for animals as for man if they are to be applied to both. Certainly, to postulate a Wundtian feeling (as our author seems to do) is to return to an obfuscating terminology from which we are just beginning to escape and which did, and still does, defy opera- tional analysis. Professor Mandelbaum's position, it seems to me, is based upon a mientalism which does not permit him to see what modern workers are trying to do. His very terminology betrays that. Could he define and identify the "experience" of an animal which in some ways is like that of a human and in other ways is not? 5 Could he identify an "experience" in a person ? Can he demonstrate "cases of shame [which] seem to have a direct connection with [a dog's] ego" (footnote 1, p. 247) since that is the way he seems to define shame ? Objective psychology does not say that shame can not be demon- strated in animals. Its position is essentially a nominalist one. 5 See lines 8-18, page 247 of his article.</page><page sequence="4">COMMENTS AND CRITICISM 377 You may call any behavior you will "sharne" in both humans and infra-humans, if you make public a set of operations which are acceptably similar for both and which will define the relationship between them. It is my guess that with the present connotation of shame there will be little success; certainly, if the identification is achieved, it will bear little resemblance to the term for which our author pleads. That term is outside the pale of operationism, simi- larly the thousands of other nouns and adjectives so poetically used today. If these terms can be satisfactorily redefined, excellent. We are always in need of terms and it is a little troublesome to have to coin new ones; but they must be usable, not comforting. Summing up, there seem to be two main objections to Professor Mandelbaum's position. First, he has not shown how he would use the term "shame" (or any similar term) as he would like to have it used. This is a material objection, not one of principle. I, for one, would like nothing more than a single set of terms universally applicable; whether we shall have it is another matter. They shall, however, be gotten, if at all, only by hard thinking, not fiat, and they shall not be partly applicable here and completely applicable there. They will be used only where they fit.6 The second objection is perhaps more basic, for I do not think that the author adequately understands the position which he at- tacks. That position decries the use of terms under any conditions where they do not meet the criteria for scientific definition and use. And it is its belief that most of the terms in current usage are not capable of passing this ordeal. It wields Occam's Razor with a vengeance. RICHARD A. LITTMAN GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY 6 There are many terms which the objective animal man uses without hesi- tation. Grasping, biting, rage, quiet, experimental neurosis (an excellent ex- ample), and many others are regularly used. Their meaning is quite clear and does not depend upon a "feeling for" or a "sensitivity to" some kind of behavior, but rather upon acquaintance with the instrumental means of evok- ing such behavior and what the molar characteristics of that behavior are. (The terms in quotation-marks were not used by the author but they seem to be required by his position for it is not reasonable to assume that every in- vestigator will have sufficient acumen and subtlety to tell when enough of the particular quality is manifested by the animal to call it shame.) There is no need to postulate or to seek an "experience" held in common by both the human and infra-human; that, I submit, does not help matters very much. It is the great pity of the prodigious labors of M. F. Washburn that all her energies were directed at this chimera.</page></plain_text>
