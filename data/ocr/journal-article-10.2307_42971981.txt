<plain_text><page sequence="1">bishop Tuttle -- A portrait* By Edward L. Parsons ** We are sometimes appalled as we read of the size of the various territories over which the missionary bishops of this Church were given jurisdiction during the half century following 1835. The twenty bishops who met in New York on October 3, 1866, and the next day elected young Daniel Tuttle to be "Bishop of Montana with jurisdiction in Utah and Idaho," knew they were sending him to a vast territory. They say so, but it is very doubtful whether many of them realized that the new jurisdiction covered an area as large as that of the fourteen Atlantic states from Maine to South Carolina. Indeed, to come to nearer terri- tory, it covered almost exactly as much area as Washington, Oregon and California together. Traveling was in stages or on horseback. The first transcontinental railroads, moving in from East and West to meet in Utah, were still far from that territory. The 150,000 inhabitants of the vast area were not enough to make one good sized city. Schools and colleges were prac- tically non-existent, except in Salt Lake City and the other Mormon towns. The settlements were chiefly mining towns; toughness, law- lessness and viciousness were everywhere. Add to all this the torrential streams, the rugged and terrifying mountains, and the roaming bands of hostile Indians ! The new bishop might well in later days have quoted St. Paul to his eastern brethren: "Are they ministers of Christ? I more; in labors more abundant ... in deaths oft; in journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own country- men, ... in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in labors and travail, in watchings often, in cold and nakedness - beside those things that are without there is that which presseth upon me daily, the care of all the churches." ♦Daniel Sylvester Tuttle (January 26, 1837-April 17, 1923) was the first missionary bishop of Montana with jurisdiction in Utah and Idaho, 1867-1880; first missionary bishop of Utah with jurisdiction in Idaho, 1880-1886; third bishop of Missouri, 1886-1923; and presiding bishop, 1903-1923. He had the longest episcopate in the history of the American Church - two weeks short of 56 years. He was the consecrator of 80 bishops of the American Church: the first (No. 147 in the American succession) was John Mills Kendrick, on January 18, 1889, as third missionary bishop of New Mexico and Arizona; the last (No. 328), Harry Roberts Carson, on January 10, 1923, as first missionary bishop of Haiti. Bishop Tuttle was himself No. 84 in the American succession. **Dr. Parsons is the retired bishop of California. - Editor's note.</page><page sequence="2">BISHOP TUTTLE 141 But he was a modest young bishop and a modest old one. He did like to tell the story of his labors. He asked others to rejoice with him in what was accomplished. Now and again, with a touch of boyish pride, he would quote in a letter or in his book, Reminiscences, some words of praise. "In referring to my teaching at Columbia College Grammar School, I may be forgiven an extract from a book by General King," he says, and quotes a description of himself too long to read in full - "a splendid deep-voiced, deep-chested, long-limbed athlete with a soul as big as his massive frame and an energy as boundless as the skies. Truth, manliness, magnetism were in every glance of his clear eyes, every tone of his deep voice." That was the kind of man the bishops were sending out to the Rocky Mountain wilderness. Daniel Sylvester Tuttle was born in Windham, New . York, on January 26, 1837. His father was a blacksmith, later a farmer. Both his parents were Methodists, devout, sincere, Godfearing people. Re- ligion was the central fact in the life of the family. The Bible showed the way of God. Prayer and churchgoing were an integral part of that way. It was no mere chance, if chance ever rules in Goďs world, which led young Tuttle into the ministry. His intellectual qualities and his great capacity as a teacher appeared very early. Through the local school, a pupil teacher in Latin, Greek and algebra at 15 in the Delhi Academy, the next year the same at Scarsdale, entering Columbia College to graduate in 1857, teaching for two years in order to have means for his seminary course, he finally entered the General Seminary to graduate in '62. He had hoped for a summer of rest ; but the father of a seminary friend, rector of Zion Church, Morris, New York, had been stricken with paralysis and the vestry asked Tuttle to take charge temporarily. Bishop Horatio Potter backed the request and he went. He was called to be rector when Mr. Foote died a year or more later, and accepted. His salary was only $800. But Morris gave him what was far more important than salary : the wife who was to be his dearest and closest companion for more than thirty years. She was the daughter of the rector he had succeeded, and a sister of the Rev. George W. Foote, who was to be one of his most valued helpers in the work in Utah. He had been five years at work in Morris when, in September, 1866, he went to New York to attend the diocesan convention. A special meet- ing of the House of Bishops was held a day or two later, before the young rector had returned to Morris and his wife (just then the happy mother of their first child), when, as he tells it, into the house where he was staying walked Bishops Potter and Lay and informed him that the House of Bishops had elected him a missionary bishop. He did</page><page sequence="3">142 HISTORICAL MAGAZINE not know until a day or two later that it was Montana, Utah and Idaho for which he had been chosen. He was only 29, could not be consecrated for at least four months; fully believed that the standing committees would refuse to confirm him on account of his youth. But they did confirm him, and eighty-one years ago, on May 1, 1867, he was conse- crated bishop in Trinity Chapel, New York. Three weeks later he started west, leaving what he calls the "peace, rest, love, happiness" of Morris for the unknown. The great adventure was begun. Bishop Potter, whose boys he had tutored and who had been to him a father as well as a bishop, had made no mistake. Physi- cally, mentally, spiritually, Daniel Tuttle was the right man for the diffi- cult task which faced him. The story of the great adventure is fascinating as he tells it in his book, Reminiscences of a Missionary Bishop, and in the letters and reports which went year by year to the Church Missions House in New York. We cannot follow it step by step in this essay. We can do little more than touch a high point here and there, note some of his problems, and record the outward and visible signs of the fruitful nineteen years of his missionary episcopate. Even rail travel was slow in those days : 36 hours to Chicago from Albany; 30 hours from Chicago to Omaha, including "sliding down a steep bank of slippery sticky black mud" to the ferry boat across the Missouri River. The Union Pacific Railroad had been completed only as far as North Platte - thence by stage to Denver after waiting five days because of danger from hostile Indians, and on from Denver by stage to reach Salt Lake City on July 2, about six weeks from Albany. These six weeks were not all spent in travel. In Chicago, Omaha, and Denver, they stopped to visit the bishops and other Church friends. But that was travel in those days, leisurely on the one side, perilous on the other. It is a very familiar picture, but worth sketching again as the back- ground of the big task to which the bishop went. It was two years later that East and West met at Promontory Point in Utah. The railroad across the continent was completed ; but it was only very slowly that it became possible to reach other parts of the jurisdiction except by stage or on horseback. It was only slowly that it became possible for stages to run without guards; Indians and bandits were daily experiences. All this was very thrilling to the young man from New York - Indians creeping up in the darkness, stages rocking and jolting over the rough roads, guards galloping beside them, sleeping when one could, eating when one could, parched with alkali dust, fighting snow in the high mountains, fording streams in torrential rains, dirty, weary - forty thou-</page><page sequence="4">BISHOP TUTTLE 143 sand miles he tells us later on he had traveled by stage. Once only does he confess to being completely exhausted and that half jestingly. Riding in what was called a "jerker" from Salt Lake to Boise, he says: "I was past the point of grinning and bearing - all the forces of re- sistance seemed to be beaten down and disinegrated. I was ready to groan and cry." And the mountains : strange contrast to the peaceful hills and valleys of his New York homeland. He never ceases to rejoice in their grandeur and the story they tell of God and His creative power. "Ah, beautiful territory of the mountains ! What buoyant years to us both were those we passed together." But to come back to the first months of his work : In Salt Lake City he found Messrs. George W. Foote and T. W. Haskins, who had arrived six weeks ahead of him, a small Sunday School started by a layman a few months before, three communicants in a population of 400 Gentiles and 12,000 or 13,000 Mormons. He stopped long enough to get acquainted. But he was by title "bishop of Montana," and in six weeks he was off to Virginia City, then the capital of the territory, and Helena, the then largest town. In vivid contrast to agricultural Utah (Brigham Young would not let his people go into mining), Montana owed what population it had to that hazardous pursuit. "A mining com- munity is eminently excitable, unruly, defiant, without fear of God or man," says the bishop. There was a Roman Catholic priest in Virginia City, and there had been sporadic Protestant services. There was a Methodist parson in Helena. But nowhere had there been any work of the Episcopal Church. The bishop built there on no other man's foundation ; and in Montana for a long time he was the only worker of his own Church. He spent the first winter of his episcopate in Virginia City, living in a small cabin, his only company being his cat, Dick, doing his own laundry, and feeling constantly the need of a woman's hand. "No, I am no celibate," he con- fesses. But he was helped by the friends who gathered rapidly about him. He had his troubles: money to raise, land to buy, a church to build, vestrymen who gambled and drank, and a constant coping with the dis- orderly elements of the town. And speaking of vestries, even after cutting down the number, the bishop notes that except for one fine churchman, Major Veale, the rest of them "will have to be Unitarians, moderate drinkers and decent world's men." The last phrase is quaint ; but most of us know the kind. In July the work at Virginia City was left in the hands of the Rev. E. N. Goddard, the principal towns of that part of Montana were visited, and after a trip East to attend General Convention and bring his wife</page><page sequence="5">144 HISTORICAL MAGAZINE and baby back to the field with him, he reached Helena in December, 1868, to take up residence there, start the work and test the question of his future permanent home. The little city was not yet the capital, although it had taken a step towards that goal. It no longer rejoiced in the picturesque name of Last Chance Gulch. What a pity ! for think of the sensation when, the king and queen of England receiving the bishops at a Lambeth Conference, the bishop of Last Chance Gulch is announced! But there was nothing very picturesque about that win- ter except the great fire which in April devastated the little town. All night they fought the flames ; as dawn came they saw that the battle was won ; the fire was stopped. "The sun [I quote a newspaper report] as it rose over the shoulder of the mountain gilded the forms of three men who stood high on the parapet of the building where the fire had been stopped. They were the chiefs, self-chosen but acknowledged and obeyed. These three men with their visages begrimed and black with smoke, with hair and beards singed, their hands torn and bloody, their clothing ragged and awry and with the fire of battle in their eyes and grim and stern lines of resolution on their faces were terrible, almost ferocious. They looked at the smoking ruins, then at the homeless people below, they then turned and saluted each other, the two at the extremes regard- ing their companion in the center as if in some sort he was their superior. . . . The multitude gave a great shout, recog- nizing their deliverers." As, of course, you guess, the central figure was Bishop Tuttle; you probably have not guessed that on one side was Gentle Joe, a leading gambler ; on the other Bittter Root Bill, a noted desperado. It is need- less to say that the bishop counted in Helena. He bought land, he planned the church; he saw the work safely in the hands of the Rev. F. W. Floyd, of Wisconsin, and in July left with his family, they to stay in Virginia City while he visited the other settlements in Montana. They would then return to Salt Lake City. And what of Idaho? Unlike Utah and Montana there had been a little Church work done there before Bishop Tuttle had taken charge. The Rev. St. Michael Fackler had held services in Boise and built a small church. Bishop Scott had paid a visit or two coming over from Oregon. Mr. Fackler had gone, but the Rev. G. D. B. Miller, whose services had been secured by Bishop Tuttle, was already at work when in October of '6 7 the bishop arrived for his first visitation to that part of his great field. The trip by stage was one of the worst he had taken, but it was a joy to find the work established and the prospects good. He visited Silver City and Idaho City. In the latter place he found Kanakas from the Hawaiian Islands, and about 3,000 Chinese. The</page><page sequence="6">BISHOP TUTELE 145 Indians were hostile. The country seemed not so homelike nor so pros- perous as Montana. But he did get the work started well in Boise, with not only the church but a school also. The vestry, after a good deal of prodding, agreed to pay Mr. Miller $800 a year and a house, and to pay the new teacher for the school $140 a month in gold, an in- teresting contrast. But like everything else in those new mining dis- tricts, nothing was predictable. Prices were high enough in some places to put to shame the best efforts of those who are helping our present inflation. Work had started also in Silver City and slowly expanded to other places, but the growth of this southern area of Idaho, with which alone he was able to keep in close contact, was slow. Thus the pioneering was done and he had come to know at least the important places in the vast area of his jurisdiction. July of 1869, two years after reaching the field, saw an important decision. He came to Salt Lake City to make it his home. The reasons for his decision were cogent. He was in name "bishop of Montana with jurisdiction in Utah and Idaho" ; but practically that official designation was of no con- sequence. Salt Lake was in a certain sense central to the work. The stage lines all started there. The railroad was completed and from Ogden, only 40 miles away, one could go easily by rail to the Atlantic or Pacific coast. Indeed, in another year or so Brigham Young's branch line from Salt Lake to Ogden was completed. Salt Lake City was by far the largest town in the jurisdiction - 20,000 as against 4,000 at Helena, 1,500 to 2,000 at Boise City. But quite as important in the bishop's mind was the fact that in Salt Lake one was at the center of that strange new heresy, Mormonism. There one needed more than industry and devotion and the ability to lead. One needed wisdom from on high, careful statesmanlike planning. Bishop Tuttle was frank enough in his condemnation of Mormonism when it was necessary. "This monstrous error and wrong," he calls it ; and in another place, "gnostic, materialistic, anthropomorphic, poly- gamic" ; and still again, "this powerful hideous heresy." Again and again he emphasizes its power, its hold on the credulous people who had fol- lowed Brigham Young to the new land or were now flooding it, con- verts from the widespread missions of the sect. Mormonism was at the height of its power in the territory. Polygamy flourished. There were not as yet enough "Gentiles" to affect the life of the community. These various features combined to lead him to Salt Lake. There he lived for 17 years, until the diocese of Missouri elected him for the second time (the first was in '68 when he had been a bishop hardly a year) and he felt it was God's will to move. From the beginning of his work in Utah he laid down the lines of policy which I believe this Church has followed in that area ever since.</page><page sequence="7">146 HISTORICAL MAGAZINE Opposition upon the part of the Mormons (clear enough in the case of Brigham Young at the beginning) was to be met only by persevering in the work of preaching the Gospel; there was to be no campaign to convert Mormons, although all who turned to the Church would be welcomed ; there was to be every effort to bring the leaven of the pure Gospel into the life of the community; and there was to be always the distinction between the Mormons as individuals, open to friendship, to kindness, to service, and Mormonism as a system. I think it was Bishop Spalding who summed this all up in the phrase that "this Church aimed not to convert Mormons but Mormonism." That meant to bring to bear upon the Mormon community those influences which would slowly eat away its peculiar tenets and bring it little by little closer to normal Christianity. To an outsider, subject to the correction of those who know it better, that seems to be what is happening. It was as a means to such an end that the bishop supported from the start the school work which Foote and Haskins had begun. At first a few Gentiles, then a Mormon or two, ultimately many. At first there were three schools : St. Mark's Grammar School for boys and girls ; St Marks School for Girls ; and Rowland Hall, a boarding and day school for girls. As the public school system was gradually developed, the St. Mark's schools were dropped. Interest was centered in Rowland Hall, whose distinguished work is known everywhere in the Church. St. Mark's Hospital was another agency to serve in this campaign of education. There was nothing of the kind when Bishop Tuttle and his helpers came to Salt Lake. The Mormons cared for their own sick in rather primitive fashion - there was no provision for Gentiles. That there should be, became the conviction of one of the vestrymen of St. Mark's, Mr. Wilkes. He enlisted the interest of another, Mr. Hussey, and of the Rev. R. M. Kirby, assistant in the parish. The little hos- pital was opened in the spring of 1872. From that beginning grew the great St. Mark's Hospital of today. It was another way of showing this strange community what the Christian faith means in its care of the sick. In telling his own story of the work in Salt Lake, Bishop Tuttle devotes a chapter to St. Mark's Cathedral. The interest of the chapter does not, however, lie for most of us merely in the account of the growth of that one parish, of the building of the Church, and of the later estab- lishment of St. Paul's mission and its growth into a parish. The in- terest lies in the bishop's discussion of the problem of cathedral adminis- tration. If the cathedral is to be the bishop's church, just what does that mean ? What of the relation of bishop and dean, of general super- vision and pastoral responsibility, and of a diocesan church to the parishes of the diocese? to the convention? All these are problems which every</page><page sequence="8">BISHOP TUTTLE 147 American bishop has had to face. We are still in the experimental stage. Bishop Tuttle found practical solutions ad hoc, one might say, because of his great personality. All his wise, thoughtful discussion, although it offers no universal solution, is worth the study of those who are con- cerned with cathedrals. The years pass. The work is going well in limited scope in Idaho, well in Montana, in Utah well with schools in a number of places, the hospital and the growing churches. Everywhere Christian people felt the impress of the strength, courage, and devotion of this leader. Every- where the communities in these frontier territories had discovered that the Episcopal Church had brought them a man. He touched life, he touched it with power wherever he went. , I wish I had the pen to de- scribe him as he should be described. All I can do, alas, is to make some suggestions, draw some of the lines for the portrait which some one else can complete - perhaps has completed without my drawings, in some work I do not know. He was in Biblical language a mighty man of valor. His physical strength we have already noted. His digestion was perfect (pretty important for any bishop) . He could stand almost any amount of fatigue. In some of his reports and letters one gets the impression that he was continually surprising himself, being a modest man, at his own endur- ance. Once or twice he doubts his physical courage, but no one else doubted it. Nor concerning his intellectual attainments did anyone doubt. As we have already noted, he had been a successful teacher in Greek, Latin, and mathematics before entering the ministry. All through his missionary episcopate he could take a hand and help out in a school emergency. For one whole year he taught daily in St. Mark's School in Salt Lake. He had, of course, little opportunity for study and read- ing, but he lectured on Church history and Church doctrine with suc- cess. One critic preferred his style to that of Henry Ward Beecher. No doubt he was successful in these various ways because his mind and habits were orderly. He wrote his sermons, he took regular exercise. He tithed to be sure that he gave rightly to the Lord's work. There is an interesting contrast which that suggests. Sometimes an orderly, dis- ciplined habit means a routine pedantic personality. Bishop Tuttle was not even remotely that kind of man. He was adventurous, generous, outgoing and outgiving, warm-hearted, emotional, breaking into tears, touched by need and sorrow and by sin. His utter devotion to his wife and the tenderness with which he cherished her memory were often spoken of among his friends. It was this warm and loving heart which made him lay so much stress on pastoral work, the business of knowing people. Pastoral call- ing he says is the chief or most fruitful work of the minister of Christ.</page><page sequence="9">148 HISTORICAL MAGAZINE He loved all kinds of people. He felt the responsibility of the Church for all kinds of people. Bishop Walter Mitchell sends me a reminiscence which illustrates both points. I quote from his letter : "When he [Bishop Tuttle] came to visit in my first parish for confirmation, instead of coming on the last train before the service and leaving on the first, he spent several days. One afternoon we happened to be walking on the outskirts of the county-seat town. Reaching a hill which overlooked the town, in that booming voice of his he said, in effect : 'Now, you are the minister of all those people. Some of them do not know it and have gone off and gotten other ministers of their own. You have no responsibility for those people. But as to all the rest, you are responsible. That is the genius and theory of the Church.' " There was a good salty kind of wisdom running through all his comment on life and its problems. He was a typical upstate New Yorker. He discourses of the place and work of the school in American life with clear insight. He knows, as we have already seen, the problems of the the cathedral system. He is shrewdly in approval of the place of laymen in the Church. He cautions clergy to remember two precepts in deal- ing with vestries : "She stoops to conquer" and "He rides to ruin" - in other words, use common sense. His faith was as simple and direct as that of a child. "If I am perplexed and questioning I am also thankful." God was daily and hourly in his life. Prayer was meat and drink. This simple and humble faith, which was born and nurtured in his boyhood's Methodist home, found adequate expression as he came to maturity in the liturgy and sacra- mental worship of the Episcopal Church. He was, I think, what might be characterized paradoxically as an old-fashioned high church evangelical. He had the high church regard for authority, the binding nature of rubrics and canon, the feeling for the Church as apostolic and catholic. He had the evangelical's glad recognition of the working of the Holy Spirit in all kinds of people. He seems always to have interpreted the canonical questions referred to him with his mind on the persons affected more than on the legal aspects. The Sabbath was made for man ; not man for the Sabbath, he seems to quote. So at least he presents him- self to one who never had the privilege of hearing him preach from week to week nor listened to him debate on controverted ecclesiastical matters. But whether such a judgment is accurate or not makes comparatively lit- tle difference, for the thing that counted was that underlying profound faith, conveyed to the world through a great and strong and wholesome personality. He was a master and leader of men, and they knew him as one who had been with God. They loved him, and when the time came</page><page sequence="10">BISHOP TUTTLE 149 for him to leave his missionary field, not only his own people but every community which he had touched joined in the great outburst of sorrow. That was anticipated when he surrendered the charge of Montana. He found it impossible to cover adequately the area assigned to him. As population increased and new towns were born, the task was beyond the capacity of any one man. He could not get into eastern Montana nor northern Idaho. There simply was not time, with practically no rail- roads, and travel in the depth of winter almost out of the question. By 1876 he says he had begun to think that Montana should have a bishop of its own. He brings it to the attention of the Board of Missions with- out success. He could not get attention at the General Convention of 1877. But in 1880 he succeeded. He himself was named bishop of Utah with jurisdiction in Idaho. Bishop Leigh Richmond Brewer succeeded him in Montana. The twelve years of Bishop Tuttle's work had borne fruit. He could turn it over to Bishop Brewer with confidence. But it had been hard for him to do so. As he quaintly puts it, "When I was baptized into the episcopate the name Montana had been given me." Furthermore "the people of Montana seemed specially near and dear to me, I knew them nearly all by name and face." But his home had been in Salt Lake for many years. His children needed the schools; and the Mormon problem made the work in Utah especially difficult, and so he became bishop of Utah, still with jurisdiction in Idaho. But God had other use for him and in 1886 came the second call to Missouri. He did not want to leave his missionary field. Many of his friends and colleagues, including Bishop Williams, of Connecticut, advised him to stay. The then presiding bishop, Dr. Alfred Lee, of Delaware, could say no more than that it was Tuttle's responsibility. "The Church will be satisfied whichever way you determine," he wrote. After long consideration he accepted the call ; his chief ground for that decision being his age. Each year he felt would make him less able to do the exacting and exhausting traveling which the office demanded. He left Salt Lake in the late summer of 1886 to take up his residence in St. Louis. As with his family he journeyed by train up the forty miles to Ogden and then eastward over the Union Pacific Railroad, as he looked out the window at the familiar scenes, his thoughts must have gone back over those nineteen years. The mountains were unchanged. Echo Canyon, the torn slopes, the torrential streams, were the same. But the world of men - how different ! The comfort of the journey was witness. And the Church over which he had been chief pastor ! In Utah there had been only three communicants and the two clergymen of his own party to greet him ; in Idaho, one little weak church with no pastor. When he left those territories, there were two parishes and thirteen or-</page><page sequence="11">150 HISTORICAL MAGAZINE ganized missions, besides many preaching stations. There were twelve clergy and twelve church buildings with four rectories. There were nearly 1,000 communicants and over 1,000 Sunday school scholars. There were five parochial day schools with 800 scholars ; and in Salt Lake City, Row- land Hall and St. Mark's Hospital were already widely known and in- fluential. On these achievements he might dwell with gratitude to God. He might feel some certainty that thousands of souls had been strengthened in Christ during those nineteen years. But in his humility he could hardly understand how the spirit of this apostle of Christ brooded over those vast lands and brought God nearer to countless souls. It is beyond our thought today to trace the story of his long episco- pate in Missouri and his twenty years as presiding bishop. He never ceased to be a missionary. He pleaded always for the missionary work of the Church. They still talk of a great missionary sermon which stirred Sewanee, faculty and students alike. Three times he had temporary charge of his old field or parts of it. The diocese of Missouri grew under his leadership. The Church throughout the nation began to know him, and finally, as presiding bishop, to claim a share in him. His great figure, his patriarchial beard, his booming voice as he presided in a joint session of General Convention- all this accentuated by his deaf- ness ; his secretary or his coadjutor by his side, noting for him the ques- tions, the points at issue; his rare skill in keeping track in this way of a debate he could not hear; and the spirit of him, the childlike trust in God, the delight in people, the clear thinking and the common sense, which was really wisdom from on high. For more than twenty years I knew him, first when I went as a young deputy to General Convention, later as a young colleague in the House of Bishops. He was always kind, always thoughtful. In my memory of him there is nothing happier than the evening at his house in St. Louis during my first session in the House of Bishops. He had invited just a few of us juniors in the House; we dined with him and then he talked of our work, poured out for us counsel from the richness of his experience, and sent us off strengthened by his blessing. I like to think of him in that way - a Father in God ! I delight to think of him as he presided in General Convention. But since I have been living with him in this commemoration, I am not sure but that freshest and most characteristic in my memory is the picture of him in Helena after the great fire - on the parapet outlined against the sky, dirty, grimy, erect, victorious; on one side of him Gentle Joe, the gambler; on the other, Bitter Root Bill, the desperado - and the crowd below shouting their praise. He loved all kinds of people. He worked with all kinds of people. He was a mighty man of valor.</page></plain_text>
