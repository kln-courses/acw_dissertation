<plain_text><page sequence="1">Yoninilay? ? Concept and Application in South Indian Art by Raju Kalidos The linga 'phallus' and yoni or ?vudai 'vulva' are symbols that have got deep rooted values in Indian cult and artistic tradition. They may appear either independently or united, in the latter case called Linga and housed in the garbhagrha of temples of Siva, as the principal object of adoration. Though basically aniconic, iconographical forms of the Linga also developed in course of time in which case the 'phallic' part (*) came to be represented with human faces and called Caturmukha- or Pancamukha-Lingas (figs. 1-2). Needless to add that it represents the Masculine Principle (2). Its counterpart, representing the Feminine Principle, the yoni also acquired a figurative form in which case instead of just showing the face alone, as in the case of Mukhalingas, the entire figure of the Feminine Principle, with the focus of attention on yoni, came into vogue. There are several visual presentations of this form, to be elaborated below, of which one with a lotus in the place of the head and the body contracted with the legs formed into a circle and the Female Genital Organ prominently exhibited, has attracted the attention of art historians and has led to a lively discussion, mainly trying to identify the form. Among these writers H.D. Sankalia (1958: 111-73) has made the commendable effort to trace the rudiments of this concept from the prehistoric time onwards with reference to the oral traditions in Maharashtra and has arrived at some generalizations. His main thesis is that it represents Lajj? or Lajj?gauri whom he calls the 'shameless woman' (infra) perhaps keeping in mind the bizarre posture of the iconic subject. Stella Kramrisch (1956: 259-70) took up the study from a different angle and tried to trace its origins from the Vedic sources. (*) Sth?nu, the shaft section, which appears as fitted into the cylindrical yoni. (2) Basically the linga is square, octagonal and cylindrical in its vertical order from the base to the finial. The square base gets implanted on earth while the octagonal section is superimposed by the yoni and the circular or cylindrical part alone visible. These three geometrical shapes are supposed to represent Brahma (square), Visnu (octagonal) and Siva (circular) according to texts (K?syapa?lpas?stra 49.85, Silparatna 2.66). So, they are the respective amsas of the concerned deities and are sarv?msam, equal in all respects. [1] 115</page><page sequence="2">She has identified the image with ?diti, the mother of S?rya, thus suggesting a solar origin, and named it ?diti-?tt?nap?d, i.e., the Mother with up-lifted legs. Maybe both are right in their own way in as far as the figurative form of the image is concerned and the names that they gave also explain the iconographical constitution. It would be better we get deeper into the S?kta tradition and try to explain the real meaning and philosophical input of this important form of Devi which in my opinion seems to symbolize the cosmic form of the Mother Goddess. There are several textual correlations, especially the Lalit?sahasran?ma, a ritual prayer book containing the 1000 epithets of the Goddess, which support our interpretation. The common typology consists of a nude woman, recumbent, facing upwards as placed on a square plane in birth position, the legs spread out but drawn up laterally and bent at knees having the soles upward. A number of such images are found in the Alamp?r museum (Mahab?bnagar Dt., Andhra Pradesh) but none of the type found housed in either the cella or ko$tha of any of the temples there. In this regard we may notice such an image still housed in the garbhagrha of a small temple at D?r?suram (Kumbhak?nam taluk, Tamilnadu) which has been recently reported. H.D. SankahVs rapid survey lists a number of images of the type from v&amp;?bus parts of India, assigned to different chronological epochs, and also shows the Southeast Asian as well as Roman and Egyptian parallels. The origin may get back to the prehistoric roots of civilization but conceptually differ from period to period and region to region. This point will have to be borne in mind because the Indian tradition has its own symbolic attributes whether it falls in line with the world heritage or not. And so, there is a need to review the monumental remains from the Alamp?r saga onwards in the wake of the ideological input in texts like the Lalit?sahasran?ma and the Goddess cult as it finds a leap from the time of Adi Samkara who in his works like Soundaryalahari began to view the Feminine Principle as a World Mother, Bhuvanesvari, superior to even Siva, Visnu and Brahma. The author's documentation from the early medieval cave and structural temples to the later medieval wood carvings and some temples of the Vijayanagar-N?yak times has proved that not less than eleven different variations on the subject exist. We may add here that the basis (type I) for all these representations is the 'personified yonV in 'frog-like' posture as Sankalia (1960: 111-12) would call it, following Murray. This is the image that we come across in the Alamp?r and Ayhole museums (figs. 3-4). From this starting point the other typological variables may be listed as follows: II. The Goddess is seated on a pedestal in utkutik?sana (if laid up she will automatically be utt?nap?d) and has a human head in the place of the lotus. We find a monumental example of this type (fig. 7) in the plinth section of Nandi-mandapa of cave XXII (R?mesvara) at Ellora (figs. 5-9 ? cf. Rawson 1978: 55). III. The goddess is seated on a bhadr?sana in pralambap?da or lalit?sana attitude with the thighs apart and having the yoni visibly exposed. We have four important specimens of which two illustrate Gajalaksmi (Var?ha-mandapa of M?mallapuram and Kail?san?tha temple at K?nchipuram), one of Jyesth? (Tirupparankunram cave) and one of C?mund? 116 [2]</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 2 - Ekamukha Lihga, National Museum, Fig. 1 - Caturmukha Lihga, National Museum, Delhi. Delhi. (stray piece, little away from the open air has relief to its northeast at M?mallapuram) (figs. 10-13). IV. This seated posture is akin to type II but the Goddess is attended by two male figures, prominently showing their phalluses, which the Goddess holds. An example of the type is found in the plinth section of the mukha-mandapa in a structural temple at Ayhole, close to the R?vulaphadi cave to its right (fig. 14). V. This seated posture is akin to types II &amp; IV and illustrates cunnilingus. A number of such images are coming from the temple cars of Tamilnadu (Kalidos 1989: 214-15) (fig. 15). VI. Same as type V but the seated posture is slightly different, the legs being arranged in pralambap?da as in type III (fig. 16). VII. This is a standing image with the legs apart to form a partial circle, oval-like. A man sits in between the feet in the attitude of drinking something that oozes from the yoni (see Kalidos 1989: 394-95; 1986: figs. 10, 13, 14) (3) (figs. 17-18). (3) Mutual oral manipulation of the sexual organs by the partners engaged in it seems to have had its own implications (cf. Rawson 1983: fig. 29). This will have to be viewed from point of the Hindu belief that not only man ejaculates but the woman also emits a fluid which at the time of orgasm gets absorbed by the penis. This is to believe that both men and women get their potencies mutually transferred. [3] 117</page><page sequence="4">VIII. Akin to type VII, purports to illustrates child delivery with either the baby coming out or about to make a peep. The mother is helped by assistants (Zvelebil 1973: frontispiece) (fig. 19). IX. Same as type VIII but a cobra is found entering into the yoni (fig. 20). X. Same as types VIII &amp; IX but the cobra is coming out (figs. 21-22) (Rawson 1978: 97). XI. A giant-like man is engaged in sexual union with several pigmy women who all exhibit their yoni prominently (Rawson 1983; fig. 2). An assistant is supporting the scrotum of the vir?t-purusa (fig. 23). Apart from these symbols, the yoni also exists alone (Rawson 1978: fig. 31) which will have to be placed prior to type I, noted above. But our survey has not revealed the existence of such a form in any of the temples or cars surveyed. Despite this deficiency, the circular disc with a hole, fitted to the Linga found in most South Indian temples is the aniconic yoni. During the 6th-8th centuries A.D. an important development took place in Indian religious tradition as augmented by philosophical-metaphysical speculations adumbrated by Adi Sarhkara who viewed Devi as the Supreme Goddess equal to if not greater than Siva. This idea is laid down in Soundaryalahart, a work ascribed to the adhvaitin. In course of time it came to be believed that Siva is nothing but an inert mass who could function only if united with Devi. Siva without Sakti was useless or powerless and so the popular Tamil adage cakti illena civanenu iru (slang) 'if (you) have no energy (cakti) remain quite (civdf. The Devibh?gavata went on to add that Siva deprived of kundalini-sakti is but a sava (Bake 1939-42: 519). The historical development of the Sakti-superior concept around the 6th-8th centuries A.D. is significant because most of the early medieval specimens on our subject from Alampur, Ellora and Ayhole belong to this era. The line of thought initiated by Adi Samkara got firmly entrenched in the Hindu cult system through metaphysical notions, expressed by way of ritual books and visual artistic creations. The pioneer in this regard was the utt?nap?d type which continued to proliferate thematically till the later medieval period. Alongside, metaphysical ideas also kept pace with the artistic output till a level of summation could be reached in texts like the Lalit?sahasran?ma, part of the Brahm?nda Pur?nam, and the Tantric ritual texts which speak about the Sakti yantras and cakras. It is the bindu, the core and minutest particle, which expands macrocosmically in concentric circles. This is the basic idea behind all yantras and cakras in Indian religious tradition. The core, bindu, in Saktism is represented by the Universal Mother. As the Lalit?sahasran?ma (905) (4) would say she is baindav?san?, o^c who resides in bindu, being herself that 'spot', the centre which is everywhere and whose circumference (4) The text hereinafter is abbreviated into LSN. The numeral coming next stands for the number of the epithet in its serial order as arranged by Murthy (1975). 118 [4]</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 3 - Yoninilay?, Museum Collection, Alamp?r.

In this metaphor kula stands for the m?l?dh?racakra in the yogic system of approach. This is the basis of cosmic manifestations because all source of origins is to be found in the core. Kulam is the place where all earth category merges (Murthy 1975: 184). Kula means caste (varna) and so the core one is the founder of varndsrama dhanna. As a resident in and the master of cosmic core, the Mother called yoninilayd (LSN 895), is the custodian of cosmic activities. This idea is outspokenly vouchsafed in LSN, when Devi is called pancakrtyapardyand (LSN 274) which epithet entrusts with Her all the five cosmic activities. So, she is the pancabrahmasvar?pini(LSN 250) 'one who is an embodiment of the five Brahmas (in charge of the five functions)' and by virtue of this status of eminence she could as well devour the Five Brahmas and be pancapret?san?sin? (LSN 249) 'one who is seated on the five corpses (of Brahma, Visnu, Rudra, Isvara and Sad?siva)'. The eleven typological variations of the art form under study may differ from one another in their expressive character but are alike in exposing the 'spot' symbol. The focus of attention is in between the thighs, both iconographically and in ritual orgies (5). The utt?nap?d temple at D?r?suram gives Devi the name Cakkarattamman. Cakkaram is the disc (Skt. cakra) and Amman in Tamil means Mother. Sankalia's preference for Lajjd 'shameless' may be right from the elite point of view, but folk traditions, having deep roots in oral transmission of historical legacies, seem to be more significant. Even in Sankalia's case why he calls it 'shameless' is a base for debate because Lajjd as well means 'modesty' (cf. meaning of Lajj? in LSN 740; Murthy 1975: 161). Moreover, Lajjd stands for a state of final realization and 'blowing out' as it is a synonym for nirvikalpa samddhi. So, Devi in this form may be said to be 'modest' rather than 'shameless', which idea is confirmed by the M?rkandeya Pur?na (quoted by Murthy 1975: 161), sarvabh?tesu lajjd r?pena samsthit? 'she is present in all cosmic elements shyfully'. Lajjd here stands for 'shyness' which comes out of modesty and not 'shamelessness' (6). Anyhow, the focus of attention being on the yoni aspect, it is to be more fittingly called Yoninilay? rather than Lajj? or Utt?nap?d because neither the gundmsa aspect nor the arrangement of legs is in any way important. Postures are tools of abstraction and not the abstract principle itself. This is confirmed by several other epithets attributed to Devi in the LSN. She is called cakrar?jarath?r?dh? (LSN 68) 'one mounted on the chariot of sricakra'. The (5) Cultists used to apply butter at the yoni spot and eat the same with a view to beget children (cf. Rawson 1978: 32). Attention here is also drawn to a peculiar midnight worship or vrata undertaken by womenfolk of Kallar and Naidu castes in Tamilnadu. They adore a secret deity with offerings and eat the residue. This consists of peanut-like flour cakes, symbolic of semen (cf. Spratt 1977: 176), never even shown to men. I presume that the worship pertains to the yotfi-goddesses. (6) Devi is also called mugdh? (LSN 868) which means 'modest' and 'beautiful'. 124 [10]</page><page sequence="11">pivot in a chariot should be the central point (7). This is confirmed by another epithet (LSN 71), jv?l?m?linik?ksiptavahnipr?k?ramadhyag? 'one in the centre of the forest of fire (i.e., the srtcakra)\ It is interesting to note here that the personified disc of Visnu, in its aspect as Cakkaratt?lv?r in Tamilnadu, is encircled by a forest of fire (Kalidos 1990a). It is the m?l?dh?ra and so the epithet m?l?dh?raikanilay? (LSN, 99) which is none other than kundalini (LNS 110), the m?y?sakti (Maury 1969: 184). As yoninilayd she resides in the first triangle of the mcakra which is the 'abode of all origins', the 'cause and source of all causes'. So, the Mundakopanisad (3.1.3) calls her Brahmayoni; the golden hued, the doer, the ruler, the Self and the Mother of Creation (8). Yoni means 'generating cause', 'source', 'receptacle', 'fountain', and so on. It stands for the Mother and so she is called ayonih (LSN 894). Guhy? and guh?mb? are other epithets (LSN 624 &amp; 706) that point out the yoninilayd symbol. The guha is metaphor for yoni. Devi is one who dwells in the guha or who is the personified cave or cavity. The Mah?n?r?yanlya Upanisad (cited in Murthy 1975: 155) calls her the dweller in the cave of the heart of all creations, antascarati bh?tesu guh?y?m visvam?rtisu. It is now evident why the focus of attention in our iconographical ?typologies is on the cavity point. This may be the reason why cave temples also proliferated during a particular point of time in Indian tradition when the ideas of Adi Sarhkara were gaining prominence which perhaps had an impact over Tantric Buddhist cult also whose philosophy revolves around the om manipadme h?m concept (cf. Fouchet 1959: 12, om where the two sexes conjoin). Devi is Guhyar?pini'oi the form of the cave' and the Guhyopanisad (Murthy 1975: 155) is considered to be an embodiment of Devi herself. So, the guha is yoni-Devl and Guyhesvari, and her spouse Guhyesvara. Both coexist in the form of linga and yoni (9). This is also the reason why in temple architecture the cave symbol si brought out in respect of dv?ras, gopuras, mukha-bhadra k?du motifs and so on (infra). Images of Natar?ja (10) appearing within (7) The raison d'etre of Devi appearing on the hub circle of Kon?rak wheels (fig. 24) is explicit ? it symbolizes the yantra, taking the cosmic temple along its concourse in the Milky Way, again symbolized by the vast expanse of sea water, lying in proximity. We may also note here that the Tamil word for hub is kudam (Skt. kuta) and Devi is called saktikuta (LSN 87). In the anthropomorphic form of representation saktikuta stands for the part below the waist and so the yoni if we keep in mind the eleven typological variables under consideration. The face is v?gbhavakuta and the torso madhyakuta (LSN 85 &amp; 86) (fig. 10). Combination of these three constitutes the Vir?tsakti according to the Pancadast-mantra (Murthy 1975: 68). (8) Rukmavarnam kartdramisam purusam Brahmayonim [...]. (9) Enshrining the united linga and ?vadai in garbha grhas is highly suggestive because the word, garbhagrhanam, means 'impregnation'. The Pir?nmalai cave temple in Tamilnadu houses an image of Um?sahitam?rti in its cella, both perhaps engaged in erotic preplay, leading to kumdrasambhava (for details, see Kalidos 1990). (10) The Parasur?mesvar temple at Bhubaneswar houses an image of R?van?nugraham?rti in the same location (Mitra 1978: pi. Ill) whereas in the Vaital deul nearby we find Natar?ja (ibid.: pi. V, B). [11] 125</page><page sequence="12">the k?du part of the mukha-bhadra projection of the rekha-n?gara vimdnas have their own impregnate implications. The circle is the yoni and the deity therein what we may call Natesvari 'queen of dancers' (LSN 734). It is also interesting to note that the Daksin?m?rti-stotram, attributed to ?di Samkara, says that the Mother dances when about to create the Universe (Murthy 1975: 160). According to the Adbhuta-K?m?yana (Kalidos 1982: chap. Ill) Kali dances violently (fig. 25) at the time of destruction whose strokes even Bh?devi could not bear. We may ask why an object of adoration should be aniconic or abstract? taking into due account the several other anthropomorphic or therianthropic forms. In the mystic's way of approach either could be the case, depending upon his needs, because the Devi is basically nir?k?r? 'formless' (LSN 137) or nirgun? 'attributeless' (LSN 139). Moreover, such abstract symbols (e.g. the svastika) are supposed to be auspicious, i.e., sarvamangal? (LSN 200) (n), she being the source of all good. Thus utt?nap?d had its origin as a pure abstraction (Rawson 1978: fig. 33), later developments being conditioned by the growth of Tantric ideology. A factual review of the images under study is very outspoken in pointing out the influence of the panca-m?k?r? concept (Das 1981: 26). Tantricists believed that by consuming meat and fish, drinking spurious liquor, dancing and ritual sexual intercourse (Lorenzen 1972: 80), the presence of Devi could be felt. The Yogini temples (Dehejia 1986) in Khajur?ho and the erotic motifs in Central Indian and Eastern Indian temples support the view that these should have been strong centres of the esoteric orgies in bygone ages (Lai 1970, 1967: 49-50, M?nsterberg 1970: 98-110). Several of Devi's epithets also confirm this. Sivak?mesvari (LSN 52), K?m?ksi (LSN 62) (12), K?mad?yini, K?makal?r?p? (LSN 322), matt? 'intoxicated' (LSN 576) m?dvip?nalas? 'intoxicated with wine' (LSN 515), and v?runimadavivhal? 'one drunk with the wine of dates' (LSN 333) are few of the names which attest the Tantric orientation. Several of the epithets in the LSN (90-95) acclaim her as Goddess of the kaulam?rga or v?mac?ra 'left-hand practioners' who follow the panca-m?k?r?s. So, she is the kulayogini (LSN 95). Though the Mother is symbolized by the 'spot' (bindu) whose centre is everywhere, it actually has a location of its own at the peak of Meru, the axis mundi. So, she is (n) In Brahmanical marriages ritual offerings to the fire pit, symbolic of the yonikunda (cf. jv?l?m?linik?ksiptovahnipr?karamadhyag?, LSN 71, supra), include the recital of a verse from Durg?sapUisati (Chap. 11, v. 10) as follows: Sarvamahgala m?ftgalye siva sarv?rttha s?dhike / saranye trayarhbake gauri n?r?yanlnamostute // 'O! Mother, you (are) the all auspicious possessor of the sacred thread (tn?ngalyam) and that you get all (including physical pleasure) from Siva, I surrender unto you, Tryarhbaki, Gauri, O! N?r?yani (I) worship you'. The invocation has a Tantric orientation. (12) The famous K?m?k?amman temple at K?nchipuram even now houses a vulva-like slab within the inner circle of the garbhagrba to point out the links between the name and the form. 126 [12]</page><page sequence="13">[13] 127</page><page sequence="14">the Merunilay? (LSN 775), her abode being on the middle peak of the World mountain, sumer?srngamadhyasth? (LSN 55). At this higher level, she could show the cosmic form with a thousand heads (sahasrasirsavadan?, LSN 282), thousand eyes (sahasr?ksi, LSN 283) and thousand feet (sahasrap?d, LSN 284). Her residence is amidst a great lotus forest, mah?padm?tavisamsth? (LSN 59), and this may explain the artistic motif, illustrating a forest of lotuses below the padmapitha of Gajalaksmi, seated in padm?sana, at the main entrance to the Kail?sa (cave XVI) of Ellora and its subsidiary shrine, the Lankesvara (fig. 26) (13). As the universal Mother she is visvatomukhi (LSN 780) who faces the Cosmos, being its creatrix and endowed with faces in all directions. Mere she becomes Sad?sivi or Mah?sad?sivi so that the Svet?svataropanisad (3.3) could proclaim visvatas caksuruta visvatomukhah (Murthy 1975: 166). We have already noted her tripartite cosmic character (LSN 85-87, supra) which reveals the Universal form of Devi. Her feet are arched like the back of a tortoise, K?rmaprsthajayisnuprapad?nvit? (LSN 43), and the ankles hidden, gudhagulph? (LSN 42). The legs are like quivers of Cupid, studded with gems, Indragopapariksiptasmarat?n?bhajanghik? (LSN 41), and the knees decorated like crowns with precious gems, m?nikyamukut?k?raj?nudvayavir?jit? (LSN 40). Only K?mesa (Siva) knows how glorious and soft her thighs are K?tnesan? tasoubh?gyam?rdavorudvay?nvit? (LSN 39). She creates and destroys and could even resurrect K?ma, the god of love, turned into a heap of dust by the third eye of Siva, Haranetr?gnisarhdagdhak?masamjivanausadhih (LSN 84). She definitely is the Cosmic Mother who rules from the microcosmic and macrocosmic disc, srtcakrar?janilay? (LSN 996). Even if all modes of propitiation are not observed by an up?saka 'devotee', he may just worship the bindu, the Ultimate, and enjoy all kinds of blessings. Bindutarpanasamtust? (LSN 974), you get all when you offer bindu (semen?). Now, we see why so much care has been taken to adore the yoni from time immemorial and why this form has multiplied in so many typological variables through the ages. She is the Cosmic Mother, the yajnar?p? (LSN 769), and one who offers bindu need not have to undertake any other vrata, perform yajna and follow any kind of s?dhana to reach the Ultimate and yet be assured of all auspiciousness. Correlation of ideological fund of material through religious manuals with visual representations in art was supported by the historical developments of the S?kta cult tradition. The Mother-Superior concept, adumbrated by Adi Sariikara and appropriated by chroniclers of the Brahm?nda Pur?na and Devibh?gavata, led to further elaboration and assimilation of theoretical data. By about the 7th-8th centuries A.D. a definitive school of the S?ktas existed who believed in the cosmic personality of Devi and her propitiation through the sex-cult. The yoni concept of earlier times seems to have been adapted to the changing needs and thus gave shape to some visual forms as objects of adoration. The identification of Devi herself with the yoni should have (13) Compare the motifs with the Gajalaksmis that illustrate type III of our study (figs. 12-13). 128 [14]</page><page sequence="15">Fig. 19 - Mother about to deliver child, Min?ksi-sundaresvara temple, Madurai. taken place at about this time. Thus, the Yogini cult with its roots in yoni&gt; started germinating, leading to further equation of the bindu and guha with m?l?dh?ra and cakra, being the yantra or mandala. So, Devi came to be called with a number of epithets which emphasize her abode at the 'spot* symbol. These epithets are Yoninilay?, M?l?dh?ranilay?, Kundalini, Sricakranilay? and Merunilay?. The equation of approximately synonymous names led further to view the Goddess as a Cosmic Personality. Thus, she became Visvar?pini or Vir?tsakti who could perform the pancakrtyaSy establish her superiority over the Masculine Principle by destroying the pancabrahmds and attain a status par excellence by being the pancapretdsana (14). Her personality became thousandfold. She represents all the cosmic particles (sarvabh?tas) and sacrifices (sarvayajnas). Being the brahmayoni, by adoring her one could hope to attain transcendental bliss. The focus of attention having come to yoni back again from where she began during the prehistoric past (Zimmer 1955: 186), multiplication (14) The image of Kala (or K?lakantha), seated on a heap of savas, in the Saptam?trk?s enclave (Yajnas?l?) of Kail?sa (cave XVI) at EUora has to be recalled here. If Natesvari could be the equivalent (supra) of Natar?ja, we think of K?lakanthi at this place. [15] 129</page><page sequence="16">of the sublime abstraction of Yoninilay? started proliferating. Ritual offerings of butter ( = semen) (15) or what the philosopher may think of bindutarpana crystallized the Devi cult of the Mother-Superior Yoni. The uttdnapdd of Alamp?r (fig. 3) and Ayhole (fig. 4) are typical works on the subject, the Devi being laid up in pretdsana position, as to symbolize the eternally cyclic process of Hfe-unto-death-unto-life in tune with Adi Sarhkara's Bhajagovindam, punarapi jananatn punarapt maranam (16). The full breasts and stomach vis-?-vis the open vulva speak of motherly status. The legs and hands are arranged to form a circle, the centre of which is within the vulva, i.e., the vagina, the cave point, dvdra. The head is represented by a fully blossomed lotus (padmavaktva), indicative of the Cosmic personality, with a thousand eyes (sahasrdkst) (17). The Ellora (fig. 7) and Ayhole (fig. 14) pieces on Type II and IV make a radical departure typologically. The significant deviation is the replacement of the 'lotus' head by the actual human one. Devi in both cases is attended by two individuals. The thighs are wide apart, exposing the genital, and seem to accord invitation for an entry. The sexual tenor of the theme is outspokenly pin-pointed in the Ayhole piece by making Devi hold the phalluses of the men standing by her side. It is interesting to find another tiny Devi (cf. figs. 14 &amp; 23) appearing just above the head of the principal figure, seated in the same bizzare posture. Is it to point out the concentric process? to the macro through the micro. The Tantric orientation of the fifth mdkdrd, i.e., maithuna, is signified by these two types. Furthermore, the location of the Ellora piece on its Nandi-mandapa section is highly suggestive (figs. 5-6). Firstly, the image of Devi falls in axial alignment with the Linga housed in the garbhagrha of R?mesvara. Supposing we imagine an actual hole at the yoni point, a direct darsan 'visualisation' of the Linga in cella may be possible. The reason is obvious, being the symbol of moksa (cf. Kramrisch 1976: II, 346). Secondly, Nandi is both dhanna incarnate and an embodiment of sexual virility. So, the interlinks are obvious. The main cave itself is not open at the f a$ade level as is usually with most cave temples but fitted with a parapet and a row of pillars, the latter in turn decorated with s?rasundari bracket motifs. If one views the outer world from inside the cave (figs. 8-9) the rays (15) The white semen (sukla) is also silver (T. velli) in Tamil tradition while the vulva is gold (T. pon) (Tirumandiram, v. 814). The poet speaks of melt silver, poured into gold (velli urukki ponvali ?ttu [...]) (infra). (16) The verse continues to add punarapi jananijatare sayanam [...] 'O, thou reclining one on matted locks, it is all life and death and generation again [...]'. We are tempted to think whether utt?nap?d is reclining under such conditions. (17) Even in folkway of approach, where the astottharams (100 names) and sahasran?mas (1000 names) are unknown, the invocatory epithet (T.) ?yirankannudaiy?l 'Mother with 1000 eyes' is very common. 130 [16]</page><page sequence="17">Fig. 20 - Entry of the snake into yoni, Bh?skaresvara temple car, Parudiyap parkovil.

So, the dv?ra 'threshold' is the yoni 'fountain' of creative symbolism (18). This perhaps is also the reason why the Khajur?ho temples, built on a macrocosmic plan, are endowed with cave-like entry points, dv?ras (figs. 27-28) (19). In like manner the mukhabhadra section on the rekha n?gara vim?nas in Alamp?r, Pattadakkal and Ayhole are provided with a k?du-Xke, motif which is circular in shape with Natar?ja inside (cf. Natesvari supra, fn. 10) (figs. 29-30). The South Indian gopurams 'temple gateways' also conceptually fall in line with the Khajur?ho architecture (fig. 31). The dv?ras in these cases are cave-like. What is inside is the macrocosm and the entry point into it is through the macrocosmic hole. The four images (figs. 10-13) taken into account to illustrate type III, are further advancements on the subject. While in case of all other images, we have no definitive clues to identification with the Supreme Devi, we do find the Cosmic Mother aspect in these four. Basically all illustrate the yoni symbol. Though three of them (the two Gajalaksmis and Jyesth?) are dvibhuja, their identification presents no problem. In the other case (C?munda) Devi is actually caturbhuja with the back left hand broken (cf. Donaldson 1986: 138). The pralambapdda attitude which is a rare application in Hindu iconography, popular only with images of the Buddha, seems to have been deliberately followed to fix a kind of parallelism with the utt?nap?d types. C?mund? is actually seated on a bhadrapttha in lalit?sana attitude, a posture normally applied to Devi images of the period and in spite of that the yoni symbol is prominently exhibited. Devi in this image is fitted with a pretakundala in the right ear and also wears the kap?lam?l?. Keeping in mind the K?lakantha of Ellora (cave XVI in its Yajnas?l?, supra), seated on a pile of savas, we may presume that the Omnipotent aspect (18) The Tantric orientation of few of the early medieval South Indian caves has been emphasized by the author in another paper (Kalidos 1990a). Cave XXII of Ellora and Pir?nmalai (supra, fn. 9) are good examples. The Tirupparahkunram south cave is another milestone in the history of S?kta ritual and architectural tradition. Originally a cave meant for Siva and Visnu as a parallel to the Tiruchir?ppalli lower cave, later it was renovated and declared for Durg? (Indian Antiquary II: 67; 37). The cave consists of three principal cells whose format symbolically is a triangle. As one approaches the cave through the flight of steps, the first darsana is given by Devi. Close to this main cave, there is a small one for Mah?laksmi who in her cosmic form as Universal Mother is attended by a host of celestials and the Trim?rtis. Iconographically, this is one of the marvels of the age as we do not come across a parallel to it in the entire range of Pallava, Ch?lukya and R?strak?ta art. I am of the firm opinion that the re-dedication of the first cave to Devi and the installation of another image in her World Mother aspect at Tirupparahkunram strongly established the Tantric cult in this centre. It is also to be noted that the image of Jyesth? (fig, 11), falling under type III of our study, is from the same temple complex. (19) We may also view the temple itself in its vertical order as the Lihga ( = Meru, the axis mundi). This may be the reason why the ?k?sa-linga finial is fitted at the kalasa level in some of the North Indian temples (Dhaky 1974: 307-15). For association of the pancakrtya symolism with the architectural format of the Hindu temple, see Kalidos (1985: 205-11). 132 [18]</page><page sequence="19">Fig. 25 - K?li dancing on Siva's sava (from Rawson 1978: fig. 97).

Donaldson 1986: fig. 24). The images are also unique in as far as they could by all means be divided on iconometrical grounds into three integral sections so that the application of v?gbhava-, madhya- and sakti-kuta ideology is reasonably possible (fig. 10). The vital and most pertinent clue to our problem in the present study is provided by these four images. The identification of the uttdnapdd typology with Devi is established beyond dispute. Types V (fig. 15) and VI (fig. 16) are thematically one but the mode of presentation alone differes. One is in utkutikdsana (cf. figs. 7, 14, 15) and the other pralambapdda (20) (cf. figs. 11-13, 16). The action involved refers to the Tantric cult orgy of mithuna and maithuna. The seated postures, both pralambapdda and the other one uttdnapdd like, profess their affinity with the school of art under study. Though the belly is concave, the full breasts stand to the credit of the Mother aspect. Type VII (figs. 17-18) illustrates the standing Mother with her thighs apart. In between the legs a man is found seated or standing and consuming that which falls from the yoni. In one, another individual is standing nearby with hands folded in anjali bandha. This is an outspoken clue to the fact that the Mother is none other than Devi. In the same figure the Mother is holding the petticoat, arranged into a circle, so as to allow the consumer do his job without any hurdle. The subjet symbolically seems to suggest the sustaining character of Devi. She is the giver of food and water to aU. Others think that it may also pertain to Tantric orgies of certain sections of the S?ktas who believed that by in-taking menstruum (T. t?mai) (21) one could attain immortal powers (Kalidos 1989: 214-16). A group of siddhas in Tamilnadu also existed who followed such practices, drinking menstruum or semen on grounds of cult orgy or sex therapy (Kalidos 1986: 193-201, Donaldson 1986: 169-70). We may also recall here what cultists of uttdnapdd-T)zvl do who apply butter to the uterus and eat the same with a view to get progeny {supra). Whatever may be the idea behind this kind of practice, the basic concept that Devi is the nourisher of the world acquires more weight (22). So, the yoni-hU is symbolic of the vital energy that sustains the cosmic (20) The utkutik?sana and pralambap?da are ?sanas attributed to yogis in Indian tradition. Images of dhy?ni-BnddhsLS appear with pralambap?da in the Ellora and Ajant? caves. There are several examples of yogis, engaged in meditation, by the utkutik?sana method. We may refer to a piece in the Arjuna's Penance has relief at M?mallapuram. (21) The menstruum is nowadays believed to be impure but in ancient usage it seems to have been considered very pure. T?mai (t?y + mat) literally means 'pure', as immaculate as white (Tamil Lexicon IV: 2019). A folk vituperative phrase popular in rural circles is t?maiyakkudikki 'you (scoundrel), consumer of menstruum'. This means some were deliberately after a menstrual drink. (22) The statue of Mother Kaveri, the personified river, of T?milnadu in the Grand Anaikkattu 'dam', near Tiruchir?ppalli, receives our attention here. The Goddess stands holding a water pot in hands which appears at the yoni level. Medieval traditions are also not lacking because we find a seated 136 [22]</page><page sequence="23">elements {bh?tas) and thus it proves to be the Brahmayoni. Types VIII, IX, and X seem to be interlinked (figs. 19-22). The first purports to illustrate the goddess of maternity and fertility whose breasts and stomach are full (Zimmer quoted in Campbell 1974: 270). Being assisted by two women, her motherly status at the time of child-birth is very clear. In some specimens we also find the baby coming out (Kalidos 1989: 395; Rawson 1973: fig. 9). Type IX is rather enigmatic but with reference to type X in which a snake comes out, I think the former shows the snake going in. The hooded cobra in Indian tradition is accepted to be a symbol of kundalim-sakti. It resides in the m?l?dh?ra and ascends to sahasr?ra when aroused by yogic austerities. It is the bindu (sukld) 'semen', deposited into the yoni at the time of ritual intercourse. Consummation of the Masculine and Feminine energies results in creation which the Mother carries and also delivers. So, the yoni is the receptacle and the spot of delivery. However powerful, mighty and cosmic the linga might be ? we keep in mind Lihgodbhava in Indian art ? without yoni nothing happens and all is waste. The entry of the cobra (fig. 20) is a thematically novel subject and perhaps points out the in-going process of cosmic energy (cf. figs. 8-9), that which fertilizes. This is also suggested by a pigmy man, seated in between the widened legs of Devi. The snake coming out (fig. 21 illegible but see Rawson 1978: 97) to begin with is specific about the kundaliniaspect of the subject under review. Again, all that is deposited in yoni doesn't get absorbed there but a sizeable quantity also gets out. This is to prove that what we call by kundalim-sakti is nothing but semen (Sen 1972: 3) (23). The motif under study may also suggest that kundalini should not be wasted and it is a kind of warning to yogis. Certain of the Tamil siddhas were specific about this. Tirum?lar, author of Tirumandiram (v. 814), actually advocates not to waste semen {supra, fn. 15) velli urukki ponvali ?tt?me. Similarly, another poet called Pattinatt?r {c. 10th century A.D.) speaks discouragingly about sexual intercourse, finding fault with women for their infidelity, thus heralding the misogynist philosophy in Indian tradition. In few of the type X illustrations we also find a pied-piper who tries to entice the cobra coming out of yoni (fig. 21). The Sv?mi ter of the Mah?lingesvara temple at Per?r (Coimbatore Dt.) lodges a piece on the subject. This is to confirm the idea that kundalini should be sustained and not let out. woman and man with the yoni and hole of linga exposed which serve as waterchutes in the frontal mandapa of the Kon?rak temple (figs. 32-33). These indicate the persistent yoni tradition in the Indian way of life. (23) In its dormant or latent condition, it resides in the testicles which could by yogic austerities be aroused and uplifted to reach the sahasr?ra. The coiled nature of kun da lim is beautifully illustrated in the Ch?lukyan temples at Pattadakkal, Ayhole and Alamp?r (fig. 34). These motifs usually appear just above the dv?ra of the temple on the ceiling. The location and the subject chosen are full of symbolic implications, especially when we view the problem from the dv?ra-yoni point of view {supra). [23] 137</page><page sequence="24">Fig. 30 - Mukha-bhadra section (close up), Alamp?r. Type XI is actually a merger concept. If the yoni and linga remain apart, however unique and significant they may be in their own sphere, nothing comes out, that is to say the resultant is nil. When both merge, cosmic activity is assured (Anand 1960: 18). This is also the character of the Linga. In the motif under consideration, the inaccessible linga is represented by the vir?t who uses his fingers, tongue and penis as a key to open the mysterious yoni. The several pigmy women who copulate with the vir?t are personifications of the World Mother who are perpetually at union to symbolize the mingling of jtv?tmas with the param?tma (Mukherjee 1960: 80-1). A lady assistant stands below, supporting the scrotum, to signify the source of kundalini which moves upward (see the mode of portrayal in fig. 23) for final realization. The vir?t-purusa is Omnipotent while multifarious Saktis Omnipresent and their ritual congress symbolic of Omniscience. Following M.A. Murray, in classifying the typologies, H.D. Sankalia (1970: 111) drew a basic pattern which fits in his way of approach. The (1) Universal Mother, (2) Divine Woman, and (3) Personified yoni of Murray for Sankalia are (1) the full breast types, (2) mother with child in arms, and (3) the pregnant woman. In our pattern of approach, though there are eleven different typologies all basically suggest the personified yoni concept and thus the Yoninilay? of LSN. The symbol is both iconographical and architectural. The 'pregnant woman' at its base has the idea of 138 [24]</page><page sequence="25">Fig. 31 - South gopuram, Ek?rhresvara temple, K?nchi. kundalini. Ritual union purports to symbolize linga-yoni union without the merger of which cosmic activity is not possible. So, all are related to one another and ultimately there are only two types, the linga and yoni, existing either independently or at union. From yet another point of view the male symbol is subordinated to the female (e.g. types V, VI &amp; VII) or the female to the male (type XI). These two may represent the two sectarian schools who treated Siva or Sakti as the Primordial Deity. The Linga, a merger of the aniconic phallus and vulva, establishes a status of equality as is Ardhan?risvara, the anthropomorphic mode of illustration (24). At different levels (24) The united linga and yoni; the Linga may be treated as an aniconic Ardhan?risvara (cf. Kalidos 1988: 111). [25] 139</page><page sequence="26">Figs. 32-33 - Water-chutes in the form of linga and yoni, Sun temple, Kon?rak. of these developments, S?kta cult ideology, metaphysical notions and ritual concepts such as the m?k?r?s and kundalim had played a vital role. Taking its roots in the prehistoric past, the germ concept continued to expand till the late medieval times in South India. At its base whether the Devi concept was there or not, we cannot be sure, but by about the 7th-8th centuries A.D. the yoni symbol got definitely identified with the Cosmic Mother and she also came be treated as the Mother Superior. Furthermore, there was a level of thought in India to view the woman herself as personified Devi. There was a Tamil S?kta devotee called Abhir?mi-bhattar (18th century A.D.) who, it is believed, used to worship all women. His equation of earthly women with Sakti was a significant developmentjhough very late chronologically speaking. Nevertheless, his way of approach may be the outspoken exhibition of an inner current, prevalent in earlier times (cf. Eliade 1958: 259). So, the question whether the representation in these cult images actually relation to Devi or not, the symbol is there. 140 [26]</page><page sequence="27">Fig. 34 - Coiled snake (?disesa?), Alamp?r Museum. Another important note essential at this place is the chronological framework of the monumental evidences taken for the study. They range from the early medieval stone to very late medieval wood carvings. There seems to be a gap from about A.D. 1000 to A.D. 1500 and thus we have skipped over half a millennium. This does not undermine the basic question in any way because our study is more thematic than chronological. Again, the later medieval specimens serve to confirm the persistent existence and elaboration of an idea that got firmly established in South Indian tradition at about the 6th-7th century A.D. To sum up, Sankalia and Stella Kramrisch focussed their attention mainly on the factual form of the basic image and its iconographical mode but have failed to analyse the deep roots of S?kta tradition that led to developments from period to period. The basic assumption that she is the 'universal mother' or 'divine woman' or 'personified yoni' or utt?nap?d need not be questioned but why and how are the riddles that have to be solved in studying an enigmatic symbol. In this respect, our analysis of Lalit?sahasran?ma and the historical factors of development as adumbrated by Adi Sarhkara have very much helped in identifying the symbol with Yoninilay? or what we may otherwise call Sricakranilay?, M?l?dh?ranilay?, Merunilay? and Kundalini sakti. She is the Cosmic Mother, Bhuvanesvari, the cause and source of all causes, the nityakaly?niy Adipar?sakti. Sdkti-pithas were established in honour of Devi where ashes of the yoni part from the conflagrated body of Sati fell after the Daksayajiia episode, narrated in the pur?nas (Basham 1971: 314). Being auspicious, the yoni symbol by virtue of its utilitarian values from the cult point of view has continued to exist through the ages.
