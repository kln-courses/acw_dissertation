<plain_text><page sequence="1">IOSTEPHANOS. WHY was Athens called the City of the Violet Crown ? The question, though often asked, has not-so far as I am aware-been satisfactorily answered. Two widely divergent and mutually exclusive explanations al- ready hold the field :but the one is open to grave objections, and the other, though true, is not the whole truth. There is therefore room for a fresh at- tempt to throw light upon the matter. It will be advisable to begin by sum- marising the essential facts of the case, then to review the hypotheses that have been framed to account for them, and finally to propound, if possible, a more adequate solution of the problem. The admitted facts are these. Pindar in one of his dithyrambs com- posed later, perhaps several years later, than 480 B.c. praised Athens for her prowess in the war with Persia. Of this dithyramb three separately attested fragments survive (Nos. 76, 77, 78 in W. Christ's edition), connected together by the similarity of their subject-matter and of their metre. The first of these (preserved in schol. Aristoph. Ach. 637, Nub. 299, schol. Aristid. iii. 341 Dind.) contains the following invocation of Athens:- 'f r aa Xtrwapal Icalt ocrrcTavot iat oaol&amp;i.ot, 'EXXs8oq e'perua, cXetva 'AOaWvat, 8at/Lovtov rroX1t'6pov. The Athenians showed their gratitude for the eulogy in a practical way, by presenting the poet with 10,000 drachmas and making him their proxenos (Isocr. xv. 166). Subsequent writers regard the monetary payment as an indemnity voted to Pindar for a fine of 1,000 drachmas imposed by the jealous Thebans (Aeschines epist. iv. 3, Vit. Pind. ex Eustathii commentariis Pindaricis p. cvi, 1 ff. Chr., Tzetzes ad Hesiod. 104 B: cp. Christ Gesch. d. griech. Litt.3 p. 171). It is also asserted that a bronze statue of Pindar seated with lyre and roll was erected in front of the Stoa Basileios 1 (Aeschines epist. iv. 3): whether this was the statue seen by Pausanias is a moot point (Paus. i. 8, 4, with Frazer's note). However that may be, it is certain that the Athenians thoroughly appreciated the compliment. Aristophanes in the Knights makes Agoracritus announce that the rejuvenated Demus ,v rao'tvo, ior10a7ecdot0 oieE MTa? apxalatotv 'AOjvat; (1324). 1 No such honour was accorded to Pindar by the Thebans: Athen. i. 19n.

In the parabasis of the Acharnians too the Chorus say (633 ff.): 'Our poet deems that he deserves much good at your hands, in that he has stopped you from being befooled by new-fangled phrases and from enjoying fulsome flattery and from sitting in open-mouthed wonderment. Why, ere now the envoys from the states with their soft sawder started by calling you VIOLET-CROWNED (ioo-Tredvov9); and, as often as they said that, straightway struck by the CROWN you sat there on tip-tail! And whenever a man flattered your vanity by calling Athens SHINING (Xt7rapdv), he got all he wanted thanks to that same SHINING-as though you were a box of sardines!' The lasting popularity of the couplet' is further proved by a passage in the fourth epistle of the pseudo-Aeschines (Ep. iv. 2 f.): 'And if you have clean forgotten the lectures of Mantias (a y papparTta-7), at least you can hear for yourself how Melanopus, whenever there is a meeting of the Assembly, quotes the phrase &amp; oait Xvrnapa' icaoit dotpoot, 'EXXa`dog peto-p', 'AOi^vat and remarks that the line was written by Pindar the Theban.' .Nor was its fame diminished in Hellenistic times. Plutarch cites it repeatedly (de. glor. Ath. 7, apophth. Lac. 232 E, vit. 'Thes. 1), as do Lucian (Demn. enconm. 10), Aristides (Panath. i. 96), Athenaeus (v. 187D), Philostratus (imnagg. ii. 12, 2), Himerius (or. xvi. 2), Libanius (apol. Socr. i. 6571), adv. Aeschin. ii. 688D), Julian (or. i 8c), Damascius (ap. Suid. s.v. Zovvr-ptavo6), and Eustathius (ad II. ii. p. 284, 5). And so firmly has it become imbedded in modern literature that Robert Browning in his Aristophanes' Apology did not hesitate to use the word ' Iostephanos' as a recognised synonym for Athens. But wherein lay the special appropriateness of the title ? The popular view is that it was literally a piece of local colouring. According to Webster's International Dictionary, p. 1692, it referred to the situation of Athens 'in the central plain of Attica, surrounded by hills which are bathed in purple by the rising and setting sun.' That Hymettus and the nearer hills do indeed at sun-down become shot with a rich violet tint, while the distant ranges are of a dreamy blue, is a fact sufficiently familiar to all who have visited Athens. Mr. Frazer, though not committing himself to any such interpretation of iocro-dravoa, has painted the scene in eloquent language (Pausanias vol. ii. p. 425): 'Hymettus is still as of old...remarkable for the wonderful purple glow which comes over it as seen from Athens by evening light. When the sun is setting, a rosy flush spreads over the whole mountain, which, as the daylight fades and the shadows creep up the slope, passes by insensible transitions through all intermediate shades of colour into the deepest violet. This purple tinge is peculiar to Hymettus; none of the I1 say advisedly 'of the couplet,' not 'of the epithet.' For, as a rule, it is not the word joo..regavQ but the remainder of the sentence that is echoed by writers later than Aristo- phanes. Perhaps they failed to catch the full significrance ot the adjective.</page><page sequence="3">IOSTEPHANOS. 3 other mountains which encircle the plain of Athens assumes it at any hour of the day.1 It was. when the sunset glow was on Hymettus that Socrates drained the poisoned cup (Plato Phaedo 116 B, E).' It will be observed that Mr. Frazer tacitly corrects the writer in Webster's Dictionary with regard to one important point. Athens is not surrounded by this hue; Hymettus alone shows it to perfection. Consequently some further justification is needed for the compound locri4avos. This is supplied by Mr. F. W. H. Myers, again without explicit reference to the term. In his poem on St. Paul he tells how Damaris, having climbed the Acropolis at Athens,- 'Looked to Hymettus and the purple heather, Looked to Piraeus and the purple sea.' If we are to stickle for minute accuracy, the allusion to heather is, I believe, inexact2: however, hyacinths, lavender, and purple crocuses still grow on the sides of the mountain (Frazer, op. cit. vol. ii. p. 424), though not in such quantities as to give it a distinctive colouring.3 But the point of the quotation is that it extends the violet arc by matching the mountains with the sea. As a matter of fact, the colour of the straits between the Piraeus and Salamis is usually a smalt or sapphire blue; but towards night-fall it takes on a deeper tone from the shadows of the neighbouring mountains, cp. Byron in The Corsair (cant . iii init.): 'Descending fast the mountain shadows kiss Thy glorious gulf, unconquer'd Salamis! Their azure arches through the long expanse More deeply purpled meet his mellowing glance.' 4 It is then widely supposed that Pindar, when he described Athens as looa'r&amp;avos, had present to his mind's eye on the one hand the 'purpureos collis florentis Hymetti' (Ov. ars amat. iii. 687) and on the other the ioet&amp;La ro6vrov (Hom. II. xi. 298, alib., cp. Nic. Alex. 171 i6evra OaXaoo-av ).5 These he imagined as a violet crown worn by the city that they encompassed. So far as language is concerned, this might well be. When Tennyson in The Passing of Arthur speaks of 'bowery hollows crown'd with summer sea,' he recalls a whole. series of similar expressions in Greek poetry from Homer Cp. what Prof. Man (Pompeii p. 6) says of Vesuvius: 'the sun as it nears the horizon veils the bare ashen cone with a mantle of deep violet.' 2 Prof. Ernest Gardner informs me that there is no heather on Hymettus, but that wild thyme is abundant. 3 Philostratus in the early part of the third century A.D. connected the line with Hymettus in a still more fanciful way: he says (imagg. ii. 12, 2) of the bees that instilled their honey into the infant Pindar-- 'Tr?-rrov -'dX' fr ovKOVT Ka 7rb 'r4Iz hArap&amp;oP Kal coL0~i(wv" KCal yhp 'rov.' oliai ab rTs 6gcrdaL nlv'cadpp. 4 Prof. Ernest Gardner writes : 'At sunset, when Hymettus turns purple, the sea round Aegina usually turns a kind of light opalescent hue; all day it is blue. In the Aegean gener- ally, the sea becomes purple to the east, but opal to the west, at sunset.' J According to Schdmann opusc. ac. ii. 147 'Ide'n, the Oceanid mentioned in Hes. Theog. 349, alib., means 'violiflora.' Anacreont. 55, 21 Bgk. describes Aphrodite swimming in the sea: Kpivov, &amp;s1 os  LXOv.

The real difficulty attaches to the thought, not to the wording. Can it be seriously maintained that a Greek poet in the first half of the fifth century B. c. drew attention to subtle atmospheric phenomena of this sort ? Pindar was no Ruskin, and never rhapsodises about the chiaroscuro of natural scenery. Nobody now- a-days believes that ei8eleXov...Kpdvtov (01. i. 113 f.) means 'the sunset crag of Kronos.' In fact nothing really analogous to the proposed signification of loo-r&amp;kavoq can be cited from Greek literature. There is indeed one class of colour-epithets, which at first sight seems similar, but on closer consideration affords little or no support to the alleged usage. A few examples of it may be given here, and they might be multiplied. Dawn in Homer is Pjo60o8a- TVXO0 'HTC: in later poets she is 0o867rqlXv3 (h. homrn. xxxi. 6, Theocr. ii. 148, Paul. Sil. descr. S. Soph. 769) or Aosd6avpoT (Qu. Sm. i. 138, h. mag. ii. 2, 21 Abel) or AoW67re7rXo9 Qu. Sm. iii. 608) or-a nearer parallel to our phrase- pooo-arE 4n (Nonn. Dion. xxxiv. 106, xlviii. 681). Demeter in Pindar is ofrv1K6QreTa (01. vi. 95), just as Thetis in and after Homer is dpyvporre~a. Better still, Bacchylides actually speaks of loao-redvov Nqp-8Soc (xiii. 89 f.). This is presumably not one of his irrelevant epithets (on which see Mr. Farnell in the Class. Rev. xii. 343 ff.), but comparable with KvavoXalr'Ty as a name for the sea-god-witness the sequel (91 ff.) as restored by Prof. Jebb: ioF 7C , ecvavavO? i O[pa/ctog vea] 7rvTa Bpea9 V`7T ,0c] pao-tv Satete vcrT 7 daTaoa' avar[ avoao.vcov]. The phrase xvavavo8i 7 rriv7', is here in effect a commentary upon the phrase loo7r0Edcvov Nqpv o0.1 It might therefore be urged that, if Bacchylides could use the word ioo-ribavos of a Nereid because the surface of her native element was of a deep blue colour, why should not Pindar have applied the same word to Athens, a town which-like Tennyson's Eagle- was 'ring'd with the azure world' ? But the fact is that neither Bacchylides' usage of loa1-rbavos nor any of the other locutions given above warrants the interpretation put upon Pindar's line. For they are all cases in which the ordinary colour of a natural object is transferred to its mythological personification. Hence they represent under the thin disguise ot anthropomorphism only well-known and easily recognisable qualities. No 1 It is quite possible that Pindar himself in the context of frag. 76 Chr. supplied an excel- lent instance of the idiom in question, viz. N-pfltrwv &amp;ALtop4ipwv. Cp.

Boeckh (p. 580), Dissen (p. 622), and Donaldson (p. 346) concur in the opinion that Himer- ius is here applying to Constantinople expres- sions which Pindar had used of Athens in the dithyramb under discussion.</page><page sequence="5">IOSTEPHANOS. 5 one could possibly mistake the transparent allusion to the rosy flush of morning, the rich yellow of the corn-field, the silvery surface of the sea, the blueness of the water, etc. etc. But 'violet-crowned Athens,' if it denotes the purple glow upon Hymettits together with the more or less purple colouring of the sea off the Piraeus, is a recondite and artificial expression. It is a case of poetical, not mythological, prosopopoeia; and violet is the occasional, not the normal, colour of Attic scenery. Now it is just this subtlety and artificiality which are fatal to the view that such was in truth Pindar's meaning. For the topographical epithets found elsewhere in his Odes without exception refer to obvious external traits. Discounting ?/eyakXo7roXLe (applied to Syracuse in Pyth ii. 1, to Athens ibid. vii. 1) as a word of uncertain interpretation, we have Athens described as xpavaai (01. vii. 82, xiii. 38, Nem. viii. 11) or Xt7rapai (Neem. iv. 18 f., Isth. ii. 20), Thebes as Xt7rapal (Pyth. ii. 3,frag. 196 Chr.) or i-rd 7rvXot (Pyth. viii. 39 f., ix. 80, xi. 11, Nem: iv. 19, ix. 18, Isth. i. 66 f), Delphi as ab'retvd (Nern. ix. 5)-all examples belonging to the same simple category as Homer's Kol 0X AaKealmcov (II. ii. 581) or "IXtov i7vepoeo-o-a (II. viii. 499, alib.). For a genuine parallel to the supposed force of loore-r'avot...'AOa&amp;at we should probably seek in vain outside the limits of modern literature.' Others, who rightly set aside what may be called the picturesque interpretation of the phrase, believe that it contains a reference to local cult or ritual. Thus Mr. C. A. M. Fennell, following in the steps of Boeckh, Dissen, and Donaldson, connects the ioor-Tdavot...'AOcivat of frag. 76 with the mention of io8eTr^;...o-reqdavow in line 7 of frag. 75. The latter expression occurs in a dithyramb composed for performance at Athens during the Great or City Dionysia. The context is worth translating: 'Gods of Olympus, look upon our dance, and let your favour that maketh great rest thereon, ye who in holy Athens draw nigh to the city's centre-stone, where pilgrims throng and perfumes burn, and to her famed market-place, home of all artistry. Receive your guerdon of violet-twined garlands and all the wealth of the springtide poured forth. Look ye likewise upon me, who in the name of Zeus start my festal song. Hither ! to laud the ivy-wreathed god, whom we mortals call Bromios and Eriboas. To hymn the son of a Sire supreme and a mother Cadmean am I come. Manifest for all to see are the works of his hands, when the chamber of the crimson-kirtled Hours is thrown wide, and fragrant spring leads on the nectarous plants. Then, then are strown broad-cast over the ambrosial earth the lovely violet-tufts, and roses are bound in the hair, and the voice of singing and fluting is,heard abroad, yea the voice of dancers that honour Semele of the shining frontlet.' On this showing, then, Athens is loor-d;avot because at the vernal Dionysia violet-wreaths were presented to the gods.2 Now there is much to be said 1 Mr. William Watson's Purple East, and The Purple City as a sobriquet of Pekin, are the nearest that occur to me. But we should be tolerant of such a conceit as e.g. ' the rose- wreath'd Matterhorn,' which would be an exact parallel. 2 Donaldson, p. 345, thinks that they were 'probably hung up in chaplets at the temples and houses.' Ovid must have had such offer- ings in his mind when he wrote: 'siquis erat, factis prati de flore coronis qui posset violas addere, dives erat' (Fasti, i. 345 f.).</page><page sequence="6">6 ARTHUR BERNARD COOK in favour of this view. The correspondence between the two Pindaric fragments is certainly remarkable. Both are dithyrambic, i.e. Dionysiac; both refer to Athens; and both mention wreaths of violets, the one without, the other With, an explanatory context. What more reasonable than to conclude that the explanation indisputable in the latter case should hold good in the former also ? Besides, there is a certain amount of confirmatory evidence available. Simonides, in commemorating the dithyrambic victories of the Acamantid tribe, won probably at this same festival (J. Girard in Dar.-Sagl. Dict. Ant. II. i. 241), seems to echo the very words of Pindar: 'I2pat...P%&amp;o'v aT;ot I Ioofr(v o cimosv o 'owiaa-av Xkrwapv A Oetspav, ...ltoo-arivov OBeav gcart Moto'av (Sim. frag. 148 Bgk.). And Aristophanes, in a chorus written for the Great Dionysia of 423 B.C., consciously or unconsciously paraphrases the Pindaric line: EgOottev Xvrcdpyv X9ova IIaXXd80o...oi5 oCa3da apprwVV iLEPCov...io-TriavoC -re Octv Ova-at OaXkat Te I 7traVTo0arrati rv dopatr, Ipl 7" dTrepxopXO 'v") Bpopa Xadpr I f KEXs8YW TE Xop^v 6'i EpE Olo-aTa f/ Moi-ra 3ap;v3potPov aihXv (Clouds 300 ff.).

C.L.A. ii. no. 631), 'AvOev;' at Patrae (Paus. vii. 21, 6)-and seems to be definitely associated with violets in anon. h. in Ba. 10 Abel 'Iv8oXdrTyv, tLpepTOv, toTrXh~ov, Ipacftrqv. The allusions to wreaths are all the more pertinent if, as Philochorus says (ap. Athen. xi. 464 F), 'AOqvatot roLt V AtovvoataioZq acy~,o-ot...Eo-T'eIavto!bLOt Oe 'povv.

Aristophanes in a fragment of his 'O2pat (Meineke, ii. 1171) states that at Athens even in mid-winter one could get 0re/davov9 ''ov; and it would be natural enough to wear them at the vernal feast of flowers, 'when,' as Tennyson has it, 'the wreath of March has blossomed, I Crocus, anemone, violet.' Another vegetation-god closely connected with violets is Attis. According to one version of his legend (Arnob. adv. nat. v. 5 ff., Paus. vii. 17, 12) he mutilated himself beneath a pine-tree and perished from loss of blood: from the blood sprang violets. This was the story told at Pessinus, probably to account for the fact that at his festival on March 22nd a pine- sapling, decked with garlands of violets, woollen bands, and the effigy of a young man, was brought into the sanctuary of Cybele.' Again, violets are associated, though less clearly, with Persephone. Bacchylides, iii. 2, cele- brates Adauarpa toreavwi4v6v e Kodpav; and once more we must acquit him of employing the epithet inappropriately, when we compare the obscure lines of Nicander (frag. 2, 60 f.

Ovid, Fasti iv. 437, presumably following the h. horm. Cer. 6, names violets among the flowers that Proserpine was plucking when she was borne off by Dis. Thus, on the plausible assumption that frag. 76 was composed for an occasion resembling that spoken of in frag. 75, we obtain a rational meaning for the word ioo-)ravot as used by Pindar. Athens during the vernal Dionysia might be aptly described as 'garlanded with violets.' This interpretation has also the merit of explaining the adjacent epithets Xt7rapal and (~ol8tot. The City at a Dionysiac festival would be both 'bright of aspect' and 'celebrated in song.' 1 Cratinus in the Knights is represented as o-re'avov ..... 'Xov abov (534f when he ought Oeio-Oat Xt7rap'v 7raph T, 7 Atorno-pc (536). And we have already seen Simonides as well as Aristophanes combining the three ideas of sleek looks, and garlands, and singers, with express reference to the spring-tide festivities. But if the circumstances in which this particular dithyramb was performed suggested the wording of the line, is its meaning thereby exhausted ? I think not. The sentence would hardly have taken such a hold upon the popular fancy, if it had been merely a well-worded description of the Dionysia. It is quite possible that some further significance attached to the phrase and gave the adjective ioo-Treavoo its peculiar charm. For example, popular ety- mology may have contributed to the effect. It is notorious that unscientific, not to say childish, philology was extraordinarily active among the ancient Greeks. And the violet came in for its fair share of erroneous connexions. Pindar himself in the sixth Olympian Ode relates the tale of lamos, founder of the Iamidai, a famous clan of diviners, and says that he was so named because as an infant he lay rtov avOaUo-t cal wra propqYpots a?ta*'ot eI 8pEry/.zevoS 48p v atvpa (55 f.): the whole passage harps on the derivation and, to be honest, bristles with bad puns, cp. lines 30 i67rXo/ov, 38 i'v, 43 "JIa/ov, 47 i, 55 a ov. Again, it is not improbable that, when Iole is called ?avzO '6XeLta by Hesiod frag. 70 Goettl. and Callimachus epigr. 6, there is an intentional allusion to the yellow violet or pansy: see Roscher Lex. II. i. 289, 43 ff. Certainly Severus (Walz Rhett. i. 537, cp. Geopon. 11. 22) makes a futile attempt to derive f'ov from 'I', an attempt perpetuated in Herrick's lines: 'lo, the mild shape, Hidden by Jove's fears, Found us first i' the sward, when she For hunger stooped in tears; Wheresoe'er her lips she sets, Said Jove, be breaths called Violets.' There may, then, have been a fancied connexion between 'oy and "lov, which would serve to stamp ioo'~ azovs as an epithet peculiarly appropriate 1 Possibly aool8igos means here 'singing' rather than 'sung of' : aoratrp.os, 'rpo'dqpos, and perhaps ri'vortos, are active as well as passive ; ae'OL Losp, ??p7LbLOS', LLdXtAOS, /O'v.yLOS, VO'tlTOS, pailt'&amp;os, Ppo'vryos, are active only.

That the Athenians speculated on the origin of the word "Iov we know from Euripides' play (Ion, 661 f., 831). But there is better foundation for the surmise than mere analogy.

The Ion, from whom these Elean nymphs derived their name, was the son of Gargettos (Paus. vi. 22, 7); and Gargettos was an Attic township (Steph. Byz. s.v.). ,Seemingly, therefore, an Attic legend regarded violets as the ar'TrO c "a/vyv of Ion. Nevertheless, since there is no trace of this legend before the Hellenistic age, we must not lay stress upon the possibilities suggested by it. It will be safer to try and fix the connotation of io-r~'bavo4 apart from mythological ideas. In Greece the violet was a favourite flower, if not the favourite flower, for wreaths.

Athenaeus xv. 680 E, quoting from Theophrastus, assigns the first place among r0-eefavo 7Lpartu A\vOn to the violet. Plutarch, speaking of blossoms more suitable for gay garland-weavers than for thrifty bees, names violets, roses and hyacinths ('rept ro70i acoteetv 8). Pliny observes the same order in N.H. xxi. 14 (10): 'paucissima nostri genera coronamentorum inter hor- tensia novere ac paene violas rosasque tantum'; though elsewhere, from a Roman point of view, he a'rranges the flower peerage (' nobilitas') differently, viz. Rose, Lily, Violet, etc. (N.H. xxi. 27 (14)). Moralists like Clement of Alexandria 1 might urge that 'it is not suitable to fill the wanton hair with rose-leaves or violets or lilies or other such blossoms, stripping the sward of its flowers.' But Greeks and Romans alike disregarded rumrores senaum severiorum and continued the pretty practice. Alcibiades on a well-known occasion came to the house of Agathon wreathed trrofi r rTeve 4TM re rv~ 8aoet ial 'lcov (Plat. Syrtp. 212 E).

This, in all probability, is the simple and sufficient reason why the epithet loa-r&amp;Javo; was applied to some deities and not to others. It is never used of gods, nor again of the great august goddesses-Hera,1 Athena, Artemis,2 Demeter. But it is a fairly frequent appellation of the festal divinities :- Aphrodite3: h. hoem. vi. 18 elto0 Oav/uadovre ioTrecfadvov (v.1. VO'Tre- fdvov) KvOepe'lt. Solon frag. 19, 4 Bgk.

Folkard, Plant Lore, Legends and Lyrics, p. 579, quotes Lycophron's anagram 'Aprtvdl--="Hpas fov, and Shaksp. Winter's Talc, 'violets dim, I But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes, I Or Cytherea's breath.' 2 Artemis, or rather Diana, is associated with the violet only in spurious mythology. Rapin relates that 'This modest flower was once a charming maid, I Her name Ianthis, of Diana's train.' She sought in vain to avoid the impor- tunities of Apollo, till Diana 'stain'd with dusky blue the virgin's face' and changed her into a violet. Others say that la, a daughter of Midas, betrothed to Attis, was transformed by Diana into a violet, that she might be saved from Phoebus. See Folkard, op cit. p. 578 f. But neither lanthis nor Ia are genuine mythological characters. Nor is there any warrant for 'the old tradition which said that this flower was raised from the body of Io by the agency of Diana' (Hilderic Friend, op. cit. p. 201). 3 Violets were also appropriate to Aphrodite as a goddess of 'vegetativen Fruchtbarkeit' (Roscher, Lex. I. i. 397 f.). Among the Cnosians she was known as "Avesta (Hesych. s. v.) See further Farnell, Cults ii. 642 ff. By mediaeval astrologers the violet was held to be under the dominion of Venus. Its con- nexion with the goddess of love perhaps ex- plains why it was considered a token of faithful affection. Cl6mence Isaure at the beginning of the fourteenth century instituted at Toulouse floral games, which are still kept up : the prize awarded to the most skilful troubadour was a golden violet, the flower sent by the foundress to her lover during an enforced separation. A sixteenth century poem runs: ' Violet is for faithfulnesse, I Which in me shall abide ;I Hoping likewise that from your heart I You will not let it slide.' There is no ancient authority for Herrick's tale (in his Hesperides) that violets are the descendants of some unfor- tunate girls, who, having defeated Venus in a contest of sweetness, were beaten blue by the goddess in her jealous anger!

And Alcaeus frag. 55 Bgk. addresses Sappho as l7rroX ' ayva ILeXXtLXOueLG e drc wfot: here the alTyva is noticeable as an attempt to raise Sappho to the dignity of a quasi-immortal (cp. Anth. Pal. vii. 407, 9, alib.). - If we now consider the phrase ioo-riOavot . .. 'AOatvat in the light of these passages, we may detect a fresh significance in it. Pindar is personifying Athens as a divine or semi-divine being. She stands before us a brilliant figure, worthy to associate with Aphrodite or the Muses or the Graces.2 Is she not invested with their own attributes? She is Xtrapal, radiant with beauty; 1oo-r'Oavot, wreathed with festal flowers; o)s&amp;Zpot, fit theme for the poet's hymn-in short, a superhuman spectacle, veritably a 8atp~ovov wroXit0pov. Such a conception might well fire the enthusiasm of Pindar's contemporaries and appeal to the patriotism of suc- ceeding generations. Moreover, it was no purpureus pannus, but, as we have seen, wholly appropriate to the subject in hand, a dithyramb performed at the Great Dionysia, where perfumed heads and violet wreaths and tuneful choruses were the order of the day. Athens herself is presented as the ideal celebrant of the festival. ARTHUR BERNARD COOK. 1 The Graces had the same double title as Aphrodite to a violet crown. On their special connexion with spring-flowers, see Escher in Pauly-Wissowa III. ii. 2161, Stoll in Roscher, Lex. I. i. 876 f. 2 Cp. the later personification and deification of Demos. At Athens there was in fact a joint cult of Demos and the Graces (see Frazer, Pausanias, vol. ii. p. 28), and bas-reliefs repre- sent Demos clasping the hand of Athena (e.g. Bull. de corr. hell. 1878, P1. 10). The inter- mediate link between Pindar's apotheosis of Athens and the popular apotheosis of Demos is furnished by Aristophanes, Knights, 1329 ff. d ral Arapal Kal ioorTepavol Kia &amp;ptCAw'roL 'AOfvat, ... 5' Cevos (sc.

It has been shown in the course of the foregoing argument that violets were specially connected with three divinities of vegetation-Dionysus, Attis, Persephone. And naturally so: for such divinities are worshipped at the vernal equinox, and the violet ushers in the spring.1 It was on March 22, the actual equinox, that in the dendrophoria described above the pine tree was wreathed with violets in honour of Attis (Calend. Philoc., Julian or. v. 168c). This corresponds with the Great Dionysiac Festival at Athens, which commenced on the eighth of Elaphebolion and involved the presentation of violet crowns at the altar of the twelve gods. It is interesting to find that similar rites practised at the same season of the year have lasted on into modern times. Near Libchouric on the Eger in Bohemia it is customary on the fourth Sunday in Lent for a troop of girls, clad in white and decked with violets and daisies, to lead round the village a Krilovna or May-queen, like- wise crowned with flowers: see Mannhardt, Wald- und Feldckulte, i. 344. In some parts of England on Mothering-Sunday, i.e. the Sunday in Mid-Lent, country girls present a simnel cake and a bouquet of violets to their mother; this gave rise to the saying 'Go a-mothering and find violets in the lane' : Hilderic Friend, Flowers and Flower Lore, p. 218. It is not impossible that the mother here was originally the spirit of vegetation, the A-pt-/Lr p, and only by later confusion the girl's own mother. Finally, Mr. Frazer calls my attention to the following passage in Grimm, Deutsche Mythologie 4 ii. p. 636: 'Wer " den drsten viol " schaute, zeigte es an ; das ganze dorf lief hinzu, die bauern steckten die blume auf eine stange und tanzten darum: auch hiervon hat Nithart lebendige lieder gedichtet, MSH. 3, 298', 299a.b; vgl. 202a (den ersten viol schouwen).' One further suggestion. May not the idea of resurrection, so insepar- able from these vegetation-cults, account for the practice of decking graves once a year with violets? The Roman 'dies violaris' seems to have been analogous to the ' rosalia' (Inscr. Maffei in Mus. Veron. p. 146 no. 3), other- wise called 'rosales escae' (Inscr. Orelli 4419) or 'rosae et escae ' (ibid. 4418), an annual feast at the tomb which was similarly adorned with roses (see Facciolati-Forcellini s.vv. ' rosalis ', ' rosatio'). The two days are mentioned together in the following inscriptions:- Fabrettus inscrr. antig. p. 724 ff., cap. x. no. 443, a 'lex collegi Aesculapi et Hygiae,' which contains among other provisions the one subjoined: ITEM XI K ?

This coincidence cannot be accidental, and affords substantial ground for supposing that the offering of violets on the 'dies violaris' was a piece of symbolism, implying that the memory of the deceased, if not his life, was renewed from year to year. But the violet was a festal flower too -as we have already proved-and would therefore be doubly appropriate to an occasion when bread and wine were distributed (Inscr. Fabretti) and sacri- fices made (Inscr. Marini) on the dead man's behalf. Anyhow the custom gives point to more than one Greek epitaph:- C.I.G. add. 5875 g, found on Monte Casino: MtKph dAP'V XoW00 T'TV , i"Xe6 8' 78]eav orwcorqv evoV0 7T[ &amp;]V PAopprlj, io or dEV TaXapovt.

The lines of Persius Sat. i. 38 ff. 'laudant convivae: nunc non e manibus illis, I nunc non e tumulo fortunataque favilla j nascentur violae' may be illustrated by Shakspeare's 'Lay her i' the earth, And from her fair and unpolluted flesh May violets spring.' and by Tennyson's (In Memorianz xviii.) 'And from his ashes may be made The violet of his native land.' 1 Indeed from classical down to modern times the violet has been regarded as a flower most closely associated with burial. In the mediaeval ceremony of Ceeping to the Crosse, performed on Good Friday, priests clad in crimson and singing dolefully carried two images, one of the cross, another of a person just dead 'With tapers all the people come, And at the barriers stay, Where down upon their knees they fall, And night and day they pray; And Violets and ev'ry kind Of flowers about the grave They strawe, and bring in all The presents that they have.' (Quoted by R. Folkard, Plant Lore, Legends and Lyrics, p. 580).2 A Darmstadt tale tells how a pious girl was carried to heaven by three angels with a crown of violets on her head: A. de Gubernatis Mythologie des Plantes ii. 369. In Shelley's Lament we have 'Violets for a maiden dead.' In fact the funereal character3 of the flower is well established, and seems to be directly traceable to its connexion with the renascent powers of vegetation. A. B. C. 1 Cited by Prof. Ernest Gardner, who cp. Beethoven's 'Adelaide,' 'Auf jedem Purpur- blattchen,' etc. 2 Prof. Ernest Gardner states that, in the Carrying of the Bier on Good Friday in modern Greece, it is usually sprinkled with flowers, violets among others. 3 This accounts perhaps for the belief pre- valent in the province of Novara that, if you offer a man violets on a festal day, he will shed many tears : de Gubernatis, op. cit. ii, 369.</page></plain_text>
