<plain_text><page sequence="1">Soviet Scholarship on Chinese Literature of the Ming and Qing Dynasties Helmut Martin Ruhr University, Bochum I. Introduction At the beginning of this century it was considered quite natural that the young Alekseev had to further his education as a professional sinologist, student of Chinese literature and future professor of St. Petersburg, in Europe and mainly in France; Rus- sian China studies had only just entered their more academic phase. If we look back today from the distance of about seven decades, the deep changes which have taken place become obvious immediately. The center of classical and in particular of modern China studies has basically shifted from Europe to the United States. American China studies remain unchallenged since the thirties, whether judged in terms of quantity or quality, a result which has been achieved to a good part because of the additional This report concentrates on books, referring to articles only sporadically. To include such a perspective in a more satisfactory way would have necessitated a much lengthier study. Even the presentation of new books, published during the last two decades, is not without unwarranted accents. Works of originality, to be sure, have been emphasized, and minor accomplishments merely cited or completely relegated to the notes; frankly, however, the unavailability of pertinent books and materials may also have negatively influ- enced this process of weighing evidence. James J. Y. Liu's article, "The Study of Chinese Literature in the West: Recent Developments, Current Trends, Future Prospects," Journal of Asian Studies, 35.1(Nov. 1975), 21-30, has been a model for this essay. A comprehensive bibliography of research and translations on Chinese literature in the Soviet Union during the years 1970 to 1980 including books and articles has been published in N. T.

As China opens up again to Western scholars and their writings, this evaluation tacitly becomes more and more accepted also within the scholarly community of the PRC.' But in a larger European context, Soviet scholarship, especially in the field of Chinese literature, has an impressive record, probably matched only by French efforts; German and Italian research seems comparatively behind. (We may consider British sinological achievements in this context as a component of English-American scholarship at least for practical linguistic reasons.) Soviet translation activity and research in the field of Chinese literature, however, have up to now not become an integrated part of the efforts of the international scholarly community; in any case not in an adequate way. Language remains a formidable bound- ary; nearly all writing of Soviet scholars is, after all, done in Russian. Since the "local" language of a non-English-speaking country2 has become a vehicle today mainly for popularization, and English has established itself definitely as the lingua franca of scholarship, major difficulties remain in learning about the Russian and Soviet tradition. Furthermore, in the field of literature, scholarly analysis very seldom-and translation work hardly ever can be done in a language which is not the mother tongue of the respective writer, as English would be for the Russian scholar. To cite only one extreme example for these difficulties: One of the most thorough Western studies on traditional literary theory, Alekseev's Poem about the Poet3 by Sikong Tu was published shortly before the October Revolution. Alekseev's inclination to listen to the artist himself in all modesty, as well as the considerable influence his book was to exert in Russian and among scholars with access to Russian, should at least have guaranteed that later scholars interested in similar topics would take notice of this pioneer effort to explain the psychology of the traditional Chinese poet, have no illu- sions. Six decades after Alekseev's book, in 1976, a succinct study on [Sikong Tu:] A Poet-Critic of the T'ang4 was published in Hongkong, declaring itself with no qualms to be the first serious and systematic treatment of Sikong. One could possibly maintain that there is a need of more awareness of the intensity and comprehensiveness with which Russian scholars penetrated not only the literary scene of Ming and Qing China, but the more general evolution of Chinese literature in the last two decades, succeeding especially in making Russian society familiar with this great literary tradition. Since the end of the Stalinist period it has become considerably easier for them to keep aloof from pressures for emanating from uncritical friendship or politically inspired antag- onism. 'The PRC consequently has begun to translate writings on Chinese history and culture into Chinese, distributing such translations sometimes only through the internal channels (neibu faxing), often through the normal publishing houses. Two examples from history and linguistics I came across during three months of research in the PRC during summer of 1980 are F. C. Jones, H. Borton and B.R.

Alekseev and Soviet Studies on Chinese Literature A review of research on late traditional Chinese literature must pay tribute to aca- demician V. M. Alekseev, a well-trained, straightforward and original man whose impact has lasted for decades in the field of literature as well as in many other areas of Russian sinology. Distinguished scholars in Chinese literature, such as Fedorenko, Ejdlin, Fisman, Men'sikov, V. V. Petrov, Semanov, Riftin and others are proud even today to call themselves his students; Aleksee's influence has even increased during the last decade due to several posthumous publications that make his contributions and prolific ideas accessible to a broader circle of China scholars and readers interested in Asia in general. A comprehensive bibliography5 of Alekseev's published oeuvre and biographical materials became available in 1972. In 1958, one of his diaries, impressions of an expedition in 1907 undertaken with the French sinologue E. Chavannes through the northern provinces, was published under the title In old China.6 The value of this book lies in Alekseev's critical but sympathetic commentary on the last years of Man- chu-China, with its disintegrating educational system, and in the author's insights in the cultural scene and popular religion of the "transitional period" immediately before the revolution of 1911 and the May Fourth movement. During the same year 1958, the publication of a collection of essays and other pieces from classical Chinese7 recalled Alekseev's conscientious efforts to arrive at exact and readable literary renditions. In 1966, a profusely illustrated study on Chinese New Year Pictures8 was published. Alek- seev originally had collected the first part of material for this book during his early visits to China and intended to present the study as his thesis at Leningrad University. Owing mainly to technical reasons the study remained in manuscript form for decades. In it Alekseev gave important background information on Chinese folklore and mythol- ogy. Many items reproduce scenes familiar to the Chinese audience from popular xiaoshuo /J'} literature, particularly of the Ming and Qing period. Of greatest importance for understanding Alekseev's innovative approach is the volume on Chinese Literature (1978),9 edited by his daughter M. V. Ban'kovskaja and the Leningrad sinologists Men'sikov and V. V. Petrov. Here we find conveniently rearranged Alekseev's attempt to lay the groundwork for a future literary history, especially his unabated interest to approach Chinese aesthetics from the Chinese point of view, his life-long experimentation with the techniques of translation from classical wenyan and from poetical texts in particular, and his fascination with the stories of the supernatural by Pu Songling, concerns I will go into later on in more detail. We find here also the earliest Russian comparative studies, for instance, the confrontation of 5Alekseev's annotated bibliography of the years 1902-1970, compiled by V. V. Petrov, is included in Lit- eratura i kul'tura Kitaja Sbornik statej k 90-letiju so dnja rozdenija akademika Vasilja Mihajlovica Alekseeva (Literature and Culture of China), Moscow, 1972, pp. 161-198.

Even today the Alekseev-archives have not been exhausted. The same group of editors prepared a volume" focussing on international China studies and Soviet sin- ology as well as on well-known contemporary scholars. Autobiographical essays and material are added. The belatedly published oeuvre of Alekseev and its impact on Soviet China studies seems to me in considerable contrast to the writings of academician Konrad,12 a Japan- ologist who ventured into the Chinese field occasionally and whose erudite comparative approach aiming at integrating East Asian literatures into a broader prospect of world literature, has not succeeded in avoiding the danger of producing generalities. Some of his notions on the evolution of Chinese literature are either meaningless or even misleading for younger scholars13 who have tried his concepts of periodization on specific periods and Chinese writers or poets, as L. Z. Ejdlin14 pointed out. The posthumous emergence of Alekseev's considerable scholarly output is, of course, not devoid of political implications. In 1917, in his thirty-seventh year, Alekseev was not exactly the prototype of a revolutionary or a Marxist intellectual. But backed by scholars such as S. F. Oldenburg, an intimate of Lenin's, he rose rapidly to positions of "candidate" of the Academy in 1923 and "academician" in 1929. During the 1930s, however, Alekseev came under repeated and severe attacks; consequently, he had continuing difficulties in publishing his writings; political reasons are among the factors for the truncated publications of his work; other reasons being the difficult war years at the end of his life and the unwieldiness as well as the technicality of some of his manuscripts (such as the unfinished translation of Confucius' Analects).15 In particular his six lectures La Litterature Chinoise,16 held at the College de France in 1926 and published in Paris during the year of 1937, drew threatening Stalinist-inspired attacks of "cosmopolitanism." We can get a hint about the pressures exerted on Alekseev since the revolution for a period of twenty years, particularly during the Stalin era, when we try to weigh the grumbling remarks by Alekseev's former student, the well-known historian S. L. Tih- vinskij, made in 1972 while contributing in an article to a collection to commemorate Alekseev's ninetieth birthday. The Western reader cannot help wondering if posthu- mous activities of publishing Alekseev's writings and translations might not be seen as a kind of rehabilitation effort for the man and his basic scholarly convictions; his "'Alekseev, "Comparative Essays," in Literature, pp. 249-292.

Tihvinskij wrote: Even though V. M. Alekseev's historical views had been formed under the heavy influence of his close teacher-the French bourgeois sinologist E. Chavannes (1865-1918), and although an incorrectly understood "academism" held Vasilij Mihajlovic in its obstinate embrace, hindering him from studying and adapting Marxist-Leninist historical viewpoint-never- theless, under the influence of Soviet realities, living and working in a "kollektiv" of Soviet- Orientalist-scholars, Vasilij Mihajlovic gradually decided during the second half of the thirties to finally break with an artificial apoliticism to acknowledge the principles of party- oriented science (partijnost') and to dedicate all his strength and knowledge as a great scholar and sincere patriot to the goal of preparing new sinological cadres who completely accepted the position of Marxism-Leninism.17 Alekseev has formulated an amazing amount of fresh ideas for research topics, most of them fitting only with difficulty into a Marxist scheme of literary interpretation. His outline of several dozen essays'8 formulated during the very last years of his life are a vivid demonstration of Alekseev's influence on several generations of students. One focus was his continued interest in the aesthetic psychology for the multifaceted interpretative and evaluative aspects of a history of Chinese literature as it might be written. III. Literary Criticism-Literary Theory At least two factors have motivated Western scholars to ask questions about Chinese literary and art theory. On a more functional level, deeper insight into the traditional value system has been considered a necessary step in the evaluative process of the Western literary historian; only after weighing such evidence and placing Chinese literature in the context and the value preferences of our time, will one arrive at a more balanced and differentiated judgement and be able to formulate adequate interpreta- tions of Chinese literature for a reader of today. On a more theoretical comparative level, historians of the evolution of literary criticism and theory have begun to ask what kind of contribution Chinese literary thinking might have to offer from an inter- cultural diachronic and synchronic perspective. Sinologists have been the first guides in these explorations; in the Soviet Union we find, focussed on the Ming and the Qing, the more conservative approach of selecting a representative work of Chinese literary or art criticism, as well as the broader descriptive approach of following the evolution of theoretical thought chronologically through periods of importance. First steps have been made also in the comparative direction, using a more philosophical and systematic methodology. Scholars as Lisevic, Semanov, and Zavadskaja'9 have explored from different angles the vast terrain of traditional aesthetics.

During the sixties, Alek- seev chose to translate and interpret insights of the artist on his poetry or art, written down in a poetic form, probably because he became convinced that this would explain the traditional creative process much better than poetic "random notes" (shihua) by literary critics or erudite scholars. Alekseev's influence became even more visible, when his several translations were published again in 1978. Alekseev had presented Lu Ji's Wenfu Sc (Ode on Literature) comparing it with the versified Art of Poetry by Horace in 1944, to single out only one of his comparative etudes in this field. The Tang poet Sikong Tu's A9[] Shipin ini (Poem about the Poet) found admirers and imitators, as at the beginning of the nineteenth century the poet Huang Yue and the calligrapher Yang Jingzeng ; after translating these works, Alekseev left an unfinished book "Shipin, huapin, shupin (The Poet, Painter and Calligrapher)," now conveniently com- bined with other drafts in the section "Poet-Painter-Calligrapher: About the Mysteries of Their Inspiration" in the 1978 posthumous collection.20 From this perspective he also published, in 1934, the ideas of the Song poet Wang Yucheng TE^{f about music and the Tang poet Wang Wei's DiE treatise on the art of painting. The last two decades have brought about an increasing sophistication in the field of research on Chinese theories of painting.21 E. V. Zavadskaja widened the knowledge of the Russian reader in this field without, however, advancing beyond comparable efforts of Western scholars. The influential, somewhat mechanical encyclopedia and practical handbook for the young artist Jieziyuan huazhuan ?-Z[ifi (Painting Manual from the Mustard Seed Garden) presented in 1956, in a now obsolete English version by Sze Mai-mai. It was introduced in 1969 by Zavadskaja to the Soviet public in a carefully prepared and elegant edition;22 a more recent translation by Zavadskaja is the monk Shitao's T treatise on painting, Huayuluii 2,3 after a complete translation by P. Ryckmans into French had appeared in 1970 and a translation was included in Lin Yu-tang's 1967 anthology Chinese Theory of Art. Zavadskaja's book from 1978 is struc- tured very traditionally; it includes a biography of Shitao, the textual history of the treatise comparing the work with another textual version, published in China only in 1960, and a thorough interpretation, using the best sources in both Chinese and Western xiaoshuo fiction, as, for instance, his "Theory of Prose in China at the Turn of the 19th-20th Century," in Problemy teorii literatury i estetiki v stranah vostoka (Problems of Literary Theory and Aesthetics in the Countries of the East), Moscow, 1964, pp. 161-205.

The book includes a useful bibliography, leading to the most important Russian studies on painting and art theories of the Far East. Zavadskaja tries to interpret this treatise, much more philosophically inclined than the Mustard Garden, reviewing it from a general aesthetical perspective; rather than following the more narrow ter- minological traditions of Chinese art criticism. In her Aesthetical Problems of Traditional Chinese Painting (1975) she again explored aspects of Chinese art on a more theoretical level.24 A translation and analysis of another Qing treatise on art, a drama theory,25 was published by S. A. Serova in 1979. The first scholar to approach aesthetic thought from a historical perspective, since Alekseev ventured a systematical presentation of art theories, was K. I. Golygina.26 Instead of a monograph she presented a survey of art theories, concentrating on those more representative. The Slovak sinologist Marian Galik followed up this attempt to broaden our vision by historical treatment with his Genesis of Modern Chinese Literary Criticism,27 analysing the period 1871 to 1930. In this way, East European scholars began to cover selectively a field which Chinese authors such as Luo Genzi MN, Guo Shaoyu ,3S, and Zhu Dongrun X;M~ have tried to elucidate with histories of literay criticism (wenxue pipingshi)28 since the Republican period. While Lisevic29 in his Literary Thought of China concentrated on early concepts of literature, analysing traditional aesthetic key terms and early genres, Golygina gave a detailed picture of the late period of traditional literary theories, including the transi- tional period of first encounters with literary theories from the West, most likely intro- duced through Japan. Golygina's book on The Theory of Elegant Literature (1974) has a brief sketch of the development of classical literary thought from earliest times, before she concentrates on the so-called Tongcheng #t school of the Qing dynasty, influenced heavily by Neo-Confucian thought, their theories considered more or less an expression of the offical views of the Manchu court. This very conservative perspective dealt with the traditional ancient-style prose guwen t Z and did not really bother even to mention the thriving new genres of Xiaoshuo fiction and drama, insisting on upholding the accepted genre hierarchy. Concentrating on literary schools, Golygina's study should have added slightly more information on the social and political background and real- ities of the Tongcheng group. Golygina's book presents the literary theories of the early Tongcheng group of Fang Bao f, Liu Dakui ~U~, and the leading theoretician Yao Nal # K at the beginning of the nineteenth century. From the end of the century Golygina analyses Wu Rulong iMa, Fang Dongshu ; , and the politician Zeng 24Zavadskaja, Esteticeskie problemy zivopisi starogo Kitaja (Aesthetical Problems of Traditional Chinese Paint- ing), Moscow, 1975. 25On Serova's book see the section on theater below and note 101.

Finally the reader meets Lin Shu, otherwise famous for his many translations of Western fiction into classical Chinese wenyan tZ style, as a representative of the Tongcheng with two treatises in painting and literature. All the mentioned treatises concentrate on prose literature or wen. On poetry, Golygina presents the ideas of the Tongcheng theoretician Fang Dongshu, the views of the Changzhou school of ci-lyrics, especially Zhang Huiyan 3EM and his preface to a representative anthology and Cheng Tingzho 1k0 with his eclectic treatise on ci, and finally the shi-lyrics-school bent on imitating Sung poetry. A discussion On the Arts by Liu Xizai U1Wi leads Golygina to the conviction that the common view of decay in Chinese aesthetics at the end of the nineteenth century might be quite wrong in judging the written evidence. Golygina finally introduces the clash with the West which centers on the poetry reform of Huang Zongxian HX and on the Japan-influenced ideas of Liang Qichao 4J! on literature and xiaoshuo fiction which have been since studied in more detail by C. T. Hsia and others.30 The survey concludes with a section on Wang Guowei's EIh aesthetic thought and the literary world of the early Lu Xun *B under the influence of Japan-filtered romanticism. Wang, influenced by Schopenhauer, Kant, and Schiller, argued for the idea of the subjective poet. Golygina's study is the first monograph since Alekseev's synthesis to evaluate crit- ical thinking from a broader perspective. It concentrates on "reactionary and bourgeois theories," which would find in China a brief, tentative echo only during the early sixties. In general, however, Golygina lacks in this otherwise precise study the necessary distance from her sources, which are introduced historically and descriptively. Goly- gina's story thus tends to depend too much on the writings of Chinese and Japanese historians of literary criticism. Though the book probably is the first intensive study of this period, published even before James J. Y. Liu's survey, there is not much sys- tematic comparison with the development of Western criticism in this summary of selected seminal treatises and their very peculiar terminology. The book is handicapped furthermore, I feel, because it does not lead the non-sinological reader adequately to the already existing studies and translations in Western languages on Chinese literary theory and criticism. A precondition for reviewing Chinese theories of literature and art in an intercultural context seems to be a rearrangement of the system of traditional terms and concepts under a more general modem aesthetic terminology. Lisevic has chosen for his analysis of early Chinese Literary Thought (1979) a systematic approach, leading in this direction. He traces key terms during the genesis of traditional literary thought, essentially study- ing a period of six hundred years from the third century B.C. down to the Six Dynasties. Starting from general philosophical concepts of dao M, de M, wen 3Z, and qi i, to be defined in part as an anthropomorphic expression for creative extasis, Lisevic arrives at a definition of the canonical Six Categories feng A, fu X, bi tt, xing ^, song li, and ya I, carefully following their double function as categories and subgenres of shi poetry. The Chinese understanding of prose is also approached from the early xiaoshuo 3"Martin, "A Transitional Concept of Chinese Literature, 1897-1917, Liang Ch'i-ch'ao on Poetry Reform, Historical Drama and the Political Novel," Oriens Extremus, 20, (Dec., 1973), 175-216.</page><page sequence="9">MARTIN, Soviet Scholarship on Chinese Literature concept, leading after fundamental evolutionary changes and redefinitions towards that later derogatory evaluation of vernacular xiaoshuo literature; this prehistory of xiaoshuo is likely to have caused the dearth of later theoretical utterances on the genres of vernacular literature as independent entities. Lisevic shows convincingly the slow and cumbersome development from ethical to aesthetical criteria, the low emphasis on individualism in early Chinese literature, and the ramification of such characteristics for the later theoretical framework; the limitations in the evolution of traditional Chinese literary criticism in general became clear. This book, an independent discussion of major theories and authors, is a very bold and successful study. It can be read as an ideal starting point for comparative research involving Western and early East Asian literary criticism. T. P. Grigor'eva, a japanologist, has also explored this dimension. In her Japanese Artistic Tradition (1979)31 she tries to find a preliminary synthesis of our (especially Russian) knowledge about traditional literary theory, contrasting it with the Western tradition. We are free to discuss her research in the context of this chapter only because her presentation is heavily based on Chinese literary thought and its influence on Japanese writers and artists, and their theories, while aiming at isolating the charac- teristics of "Far Eastern" art theory in contrast to the Western tradition. For this purpose, Grigor'eva uses an eclectic thematical approach, describing from a philosophical point of view the early traditional Weltbild and its influence on the structural idiosyncracies of literature, music, architecture, on aesthetical categories and evolving notions of time and space. She singles out Chinese cyclical perceptions, the essence of terms as non- action wuwei A or naturalness ziran ?, the problem of the literary value of "imitation" (in contrast to modern Western "originality") or the "law of traditionalism," as she prefers to call it. Grigor'eva omits the social and historical perspective in her analysis because in her view a "disease of leftism" has befallen the literary historians who trace changes and evolutions, but who forget about those elements in the tradition which prove to remain stable through the centuries. It is no doubt a stimulating book, ostensibly influenced by Alekseev's basic premises and his work in Chinese aesthetics, as well as by Konrad's global comparative approach. As shortcomings of Grigor'eva's study might be seen its impressionistic ahistorical and associative character, a premature passion to arrive at once at a synthesis of two very complex literary traditions; her book certainly is thought-provoking, evading the philological haziness of early Chinese literary thought; it is also a very rare personal confession. Finally one should mention briefly a topic Russian scholars have been working on very actively which should be of a comparative perspective. This is the complex history of influence from Russian literature on China's modern literary scene. M. E. Shnejder did years of research in this field before he published his results in 1977. In his Russian Classical Literature in China32 he treats translations, their quality, and the motivation 3'T. P.

This book has a bibliography of translations of Russian writers into Chinese of about 400 selected titles; it gives about 250 Russian titles on literary relations between Russia and China, like A. I.

Snejder deplores the neglect of research on related topics by Chinese scholars. 159</page><page sequence="10">160 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 6 (1984) for beginning such work. Shnejder devotes entire chapters to the impact of such writings as Pushkin, Dostojevskij, Ostrovskij, Cechov, Andreev, and Gorkij on the formation of modem Chinese literature. Other authors such as Tolstoj, Turgenev, Gogol' or Maja- kovskij are not studied in this monograph, having already been treated in separate studies. Some Russian works have insisted on the influence of the October Revolution and of the young Soviet Union on China in order to show how unreasonable the Sino- Soviet rift since the sixties has been. Shnejder's book certainly might be also understood by the Chinese cultural bureaucracy as a hint that China has shown less than adequate gratitude for this intellectual ferment and enrichment.33 Apart from this conclusion, Shnejder has succeeded in presenting a thorough and informative study of Russia's "important role in the formation and development of the new Chinese literature of critical realism." IV. Literary History Soviet sinology so far has not produced a major history of Chinese literature which might be called more comprehensive or of a quality superior to counterparts in other Western languages. V. Sorokin and L. Ejdlin published in 196234 a well-balanced short survey as the first volume of a series of introductory histories of Oriental literatures. The emphasis adopted by Asian history and literatures at Russian universities and consequently on the highschool level created surveys like the textbooks for the uni- versity course "Literary History of the East,"35 published by Moscow University in several volumes in 1962, 1970, 1975, and 1977. It traces Chinese literary evolution in the context of other Oriental literatures from an Ancient period (up to Han) to "Middle Ages," modern times and a recent period focusing on Chinese literature between 1917 and 1945. The two volumes of literary history during the Middle Ages follow Konrad, discerning-somewhat controversially-an early Middle Age (third to seventh century), a period of Renaissance (eighth to twelveth century), the Mongol period and an Early Enlightenment (fourteenth to seventeenth century), etc. This history was originally under the editorship of academician Konrad. 33However, during several months in China in 1980, I came across some internal journals and periodicals reporting in an objective and well-informed manner about Russian or Soviet cultures and literature: Bianyi cankao (neibu kanwu) (Translation and Reference [Internal Periodicals]), by the Waiwen chubanju (Foreign Publications Office), rather general; Waiguo wenyi ziliao (Materials on Foreign Literature and Art), by the Institute of Literature and Arts of the Ministry of Culture in Peking, e.g., no. 11, 12 (1979) on Soviet films, on the dramatist Vampilov, on Stanislavskij and on a film festival in Moscow; Waiguo yanjiu zhongguo (Foreign Research on China, Internally released), by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Peking, e.g., vol. 3, 1979, on China-Conferences in the Soviet Union 1976-1978 and abstracts of several Russian books on China, such as Skackov's history of Russian sinology. It seems unnecessary to refer to open sources. 34V. Sorokin, L. Ejdlin, Kitajskaja literatura, Kratkij ocerk (Chinese Literature, a Short Survey), Moscow, 1962.

An earlier, not very successful attempt at a guide to Chinese texts in translation was the chrestomathy Chinese Literature with a condensed introductory history of Chinese literature by Konrad. Very well received were the volumes Classical Prose of the Far East (1973) and Classical Drama of the East (1976).36 The best introduction to Russian theories of literary evolution behind such efforts and an introduction to concrete research going on in the Soviet Union are collective volumes, especially the series Theoretical Problems of Research on the Literature of the Far East,37 reports of conferences held in Leningrad every two years. Concerning Ming and Qing literature, for instance, we find articles on literary theories of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, studies of the concept of loyalty in Shuihu 4I, on female roles in the Hongloumeng 1iE: , and a Leningrad manuscript of this novel, research on the Wudaishi pinghua, the Fengshen yanyi, the Jinpingmei, and Buddhist drama of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries or later theater plays by Tang Xianzu iSfm and Kong Shangren LfQS, evidence for continued emphasis on the xiaoshuo tradition. Earlier discussions38 published collectively can only be mentioned briefly: the fol- lowing topics were taken into consideration: Problems of periodization of literary his- tory (1968), Chinese literary theory (1964), a period of Humanism (1967), of Realism (1964) and (1966), genres and styles (1969), literary relations of Asia and the West (1967), and basic theoretical knowledge necessary for the student of Asian literature (1969). In the period under review there are no special studies on Ming and Qing poetry; nevertheless one should mention L. Z. Ejdlin who has to be considered the leading scholar to introduce Chinese poetry to the Soviet public. Several of his articles and essays explore the character of classical Chinese poetry and the evolution of the artists' conception in the literature of Medieval China.39 Influenced by years of research under Chinese scholars in the PRC, the younger generation has produced monographic studies and translations on an impressive scale; 36Kitajskaja literatura, Hrestomatija (Chinese Literature, A Chrestomathy), Moscow, 1959, Vol. I. This anthol- ogy is based on earlier translations. The anthology includes excerpts from the early philosophers as well as from novels and short stories in colloquial and wenyan language.

Olga Fisman, a Leningrad specialist, presented in 1966 a book on the development of The Chinese Satirical Novel.40 Her main thesis was to prove an "epoch of enlightement," documented to a great deal by this special brand of book length xiaoshuo. She tried to underline thus in a more concrete way ideas of identical worldwide phases in literary evolution, which N. I. Konrad4' had encouraged for many years. Fisman analysed in depth Rulin waishi fZW (The Scholars) and the feminist Jinghuayuan r tL (Romance of the Flowers in the Mirror) a novel she translated in 1959 together with I. E. Ciperovic and V. A. Vel'gus. These novels are seen as part of a satirical tradition, originating with Xiyouji AIME (The Journey to the West), the Ming novel Zhong Kui zhuaguizhuan Afi^l= (Zhong Kui Catches Ghosts)42 the outspoken Jin Ping Mei E 4t t(Golden Lotus) and partly Hongloumeng (The Dream of the Red Chamber); Fisman sees it successfully continued in short stories of the Pu Songling 7, Liao Studio or the Ji Yun *E Cottage type. The development of Fisman's research shows the same convincing thematical unity as the writings of Riftin and Semanov; a decade later, she published monographic studies and translations of the last mentioned two authors, Pu and Ji, as well as Yuan Mei. Fisman's analysis of the satirical novel is strongly influenced by Alekseev's ideas of literary scholarship; it is based especially on a solid knowledge of the Chinese sources. The only comparable effort in the West to approach this satirical tradition at that time, is research of scholars from Prusek's illfated Prague school such as that of 0. Kral.43 Fisman traces "enlightenment" tendencies from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century in the general intellectual history and attempts a comparison between this kind of literary "enlightenment" and its Western counterpart. There are, however, difficulties with this interpretation of the period, because the enlightenment, which Hou Wailu R-Mi analysed in his intellectual history, basing himself on thinkers as Huang Zongyi A ~, Gu Yanwu MAR, and Wang Fuzhi 3E5Z, is linked by Fisman in a forced way to the novels portrayed as protagonists of the enlightenment up to such authors as Pu and Ji. Such linking was easy only as long as generalities were discussed by comparatists like Konrad; the concept was later given up for the seventeenth century by scholars of this period like Semanov44 who finally only insisted on traits of a kind of "enlight- 40(. L. Fisman, Kitajskij satiriceskij roman, Epocha Prosvescenija (The Chinese Satirical Novel: the Period of Enlightenment), Moscow, 1966. 4'See N. I. Konrad, West-East Inseparable Twain, Moscow, 1967, a translation of Zapad i vostok, Moscow, 1966. Konrad looked for a general pattern of the historical process in Japan, China and the West, concentrating on the concept of an "Oriental Renaissance," an earlier "humanism," as well as periods of Enlightenment and Realism. Konrad is very much in danger of getting lost in generalities. Much of his concept was particularly propagated in connection with the compilation of the Russian history of Asian literature, see note 35. 42A new edition of the Zhong Kui novel published recently in East Germany has a postscript by Fisman. 43See Oldrich Kral, Umeni cinskeho romdnu (The Art of the Chinese Novel), Prague, 1965. This book treats the evolution of the novel and The Scholars, concentrating on its artistic features. After the destruction of the Czech sinological center, this type of research was continued outside the country by such scholars as Milena Dolezelova: the tragic history of the Prague school and its end in 1968/1969 still remains to be written. A new study on The Scholars has been published 1980 in Polish by Z. Slupski who has worked for many years in Prague. 44There is a handwritten remark in the copy of his Evolution of the Chinese Novel (1970) which Semanov</page><page sequence="13">MARTIN, Soviet Scholarship on Chinese Literature enment" at a time, the direct contact between East and West had forcefully begun at the turn of the century. This enforced linking, following superimposed European con- cepts, is very much apparent in Fisman's chapters on the role of China in European intellectual history, written in the tradition of Reichwein and other cultural historians; it is only superficially connected to the main theme of the book. Nevertheless, Fisman's study may be read as a stimulating history of important aspects of the classical Chinese novel. Fisman herself later turned to less theoretical research on the major collections of wenyan prose. Finally, in her synthesis Three Chinese Novelists of 1980,45 she aban- doned the concept of "enlightenment." V. I. Semanov, known outside the Soviet Union through a translation of his earlier study on Lu Xun and His Predecessors (1967), published in 1970 the first survey of the history of late traditional xiaoshuo literature, the Evolution of the Chinese Novel,46 focus- ing on the period from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century. If Evolution of the Chinese Novel had been published in English, it would certainly have been considered a pioneer effort comparable to C. T. Hsia's history of modem fiction, which has inspired and guided a whole generation of younger scholars of Chinese literature. Semanov states that this traditional period of the late nineteenth century has been neglected by literary historians even after the publication of A Ying's history of late Qing fiction; one reason for this has been the fact that from the viewpoint of literary quality, the late xiaoshuo genre cannot compete with the traditional novel; much more important, however, has been the fact that the radicals of the May Fourth Movement, who paved the way for China's modem literature, were more biased towards their immediate predecessors. Semanov defines the genres of late Qing fiction and their origin in close connection with a popular periodical press; he characterizes the erudite novel, satirical and fantastic fiction, adventure romances such as the Manchu Wen-kang's Ernuyingxiongzhuan % ~kX (Tale of Heroic Lovers)47 love stories and the subgenre of the political novel. Two authors get Semanov's special attention: Li Baojia AtN and Wu Woyao J^f. Semanov comments on Li's Gengzi gebian tanci z' :M lI(The Events of the Year 1900) about the Boxer uprisings, on Guanchang xianxingji V*Rfa (Our Officialdom),48 Huo diyu AtS (Living Hell) about merchants, shipbuilding and bureaucracy, finally on the Wenming xiaoshi 7c~'J~ (Short History of Civilization) describing the disturbing pro- cess of Europeanization going on in China. He also analyzes Wu Woyao's novel Ershi- nian mudu zhiguai xianzhuang -+f aW iSff (Twenty Years). They try, as all other writings of Wu, to explain and criticise the reasons for China's sudden and painful gave to me, stating the author was doubting that an "Oriental Enlightenment" took place around the sev- enteenth and eighteenth century, without however, having similar doubts about the turn of the present century. 45See note 92. 46Semanov, Lu Xun i ego predsestvenniki, Moscow, 1967, translated by C. I. Alber as Lu Hsin and His Predecessors, White Plains, 1980; V. I. Semanov, Evoljucija kitajskogo romana, konec 18 - nacalo 20 v. (Evolution of the Chinese Novel), Moscow, 1970. The Czech scholar M. Dolezelova-Velingerova has recently introduced this literature to a broader audience in the collection of essays she edited: The Chinese Novel at the Turn of the Century, Toronto, 1980. 47There is a German translation by F.

In two articles Semanov discusses Japanese and Western influence on Chinese fiction at the turn of the century.49 Semanov defines his work as an essay in literary history rather than in literary theory; nevertheless, he tries to support the concept of an "Oriental Enlightenment,"50 following the sinologist-historian Tihvinskij and 0. Fisman, who, in their turn, relied on Hou Wailu and other authors of the PRC. However, Semanov seems at places somewhat hesitating in applying a concept of "tendencies of enlightenment" beginning with the seventeenth century; he finds it more plausible with certain reservations for the late nineteenth century. But even then he does not forget to refer to Deng Tuo in the conceptual battle going on for some time between the Soviet promoters and critics of this attempt at periodization. Deng had ridiculed such overstrained hunting for parallels with Western literary periodization or for generalizations of periods in literary history as Konrad attempted, accusing Hou Wailu and others of a new kind of "slave psychology." Semanov has succeeded with his historical survey to give the reader an easier framework of reference, connecting it closely with Western and especially Russian literary history. Thus, a transitional kind of literary production is characterized from its most valuable side as a keen and detailed social commentary on this period of radical change. V. Vernacular Fiction The fifties and sixties introduced the Russian reader to full translations of many important novels and stories, those considered in China as "classical" as well as fiction from the late Qing. During the seventies this translation activity slowed down consid- erably; instead there was a notable redirection of energies towards scholarship in this field. Results of this research, especially by Riftin, Fisman, and others, might be con- sidered as important contributions to an international audience, if not for the initial obstacle, the language barrier. This is true also for the collected, posthumously pub- lished essays and articles of Alekseev written decades earlier, but once again, since 1978, exerting a considerable impact on Russian scholars in the field of literature in general and on specialists in the literature of the Far East in particular. Actually during the fifties, publishing classical xiaoshuo (two very popular stories being even distributed in 300,000 copies)51 was only one aspect of the thriving trans- lation effort in a more "relevant" area. In the Soviet Union nearly all modem Chinese writers considered acceptable in Peking were introduced, i.e. authors of the Republican era as well as of the early PRC. Translation work on such a large scale has been probably only matched by Japan with its tradition of translating and interpreting things Chinese. 49Semanov's articles are published in Iz istorii literaturnyh svjazej XIX veka (On the History of Literary Relations During the Nineteenth Century), Moscow, 1962. 50Semanov uses in a limiting sense the term "prosvetitel'stvo" instead of "prosvescenie," freely rendered "enlightening elements" instead of "enlightenment." See also Semanov, "Problems of Chinese Enlighten- ment," in Problemy prosvescenija v mirovoj literature (Problems of Enlightenment in World Literature), Mos- cow, 1970, pp. 237-260. S5For example, see note 73 in the booklet with two stories from the collections edited by Feng Menglong, translated by A. Tiskov. Popular tales have later on even reached broader distribution. B. Riftin's Kitajskije narodnyje skazki (Chinese Folktales), Moscow, 1972 has sold in several editions, pirated editions, and retrans- lations totaling one million copies.</page><page sequence="15">MARTIN, Soviet Scholarship on Chinese Literature In the Soviet Union, in any case, all this hectic activity inspired often by the political necessities and by much opportunism at the same time, broke down eventually; polem- ical books on the destruction of Chinese culture caused by the "deviation" of Maoism soon replaced most other efforts. Books like Nadeev's attack against the Cultural Revo- lution (1969) or Zhelohovcev's Literary Theory and Political Struggle in the PRC (1979)52 might be referred to in this context. Thus, in a way, the seventies left serious students of Chinese literature to continue their work, writing very uninhibited papers and doing research, often oriented towards the traditions of textual sinology or venturing into areas which would have been considered controversial during the fifties; an example might be Sorokin's translation of the novel Wei-cheng SS (The Fortress Besieged), by China's greatest living literary scholar Qian Zhongshu "*X.53 Major novels54 were translated and published in the fifties in editions of 30,000 copies on the average: Sanguozhi yanyi 4--.,lt (The Romance of the Three Kingdoms)-V.

Judged from the standards established by D. Hawkes or Anthony Yu,56 they must be regarded as mere predecessors even in a national context. Not only political considerations and shortage of paper have prevented new editions, the specialists obviously feel that the Russian public has to wait for more rigid and scholarly-minded translation versions.57 This silence thus seems in a way a commentary from quite another angle on the perennial dispute between the advocates of readable (and sometimes unfaithful) ver- sions and those preferring philologically exact and complete translations58 which in turn tend to be difficult to swallow for the average non-specialized reader. We will probably see a solution in the Soviet Union not so far different from that emerging slowly in the West. In the future there might coexist a scholarly translation of a classical Chinese novel side by side with a more popular edited version. This assumed process will be cumbersome, however, because first class sinologist-translators (who are needed for this job) tend to shun this task particularly after an "international" standard English translation has emerged. Though it is true that even today erotic novels like Li Yii's Rouputuan (Prayer Mat of Flesh) would not make their way through the screening committees, the Golden Lotus finally could be published in 1977,59 as the last of the classical novels in a carefully edited and abridged version. The original manuscript by the late V. Manuhin was condensed to a two-volume edition with a well-informed introduction and short com- mentaries by Boris Riftin with poetry renditions done by G. Jaroslavcev. Manuhin had already finished a dissertation on this novel in 1964.60 This Russian version, cutting out some of the more outright descriptions of sexual indulgence, following the con- ventions of official Soviet puritanism, is based on the earliest version of the Jinpingmei cihua (1617) in contrast to the existing earlier Western translations from later texts of the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries. In Manuhin's translation lyrical innuendos as well as many subplots have been omitted; regrettably, the book does not exactly indicate which parts of the original have been left out. The Russian edition published in 50,000 copies and addressing the general public soon was sold on the black market. Folklore and xiaoshuo fiction have been, since 1949, areas of research in China which were "correct" and safe ideologically, showing the creativity of the suppressed 56D.

Boris Riftin has done research for more than two decades on the early forms of the xiaoshuo genre and the evolution of its subgenres. He has thus been less interested in a literary aesthetic approach to the classical baihua novel; instead as an ethnographer and folklorist,61 he sought to discover the general characteristics of the genre in its entirety. Riftin probably has to be called the most prolific scholar among active sin- ologists concerned with literature. He has presented many'original and challenging insights, and it is to be regretted that for the time being, few scholars outside the Soviet Union have had access to his major books. Riftin's research on the outlined topic led him from a study of the tale about China's Great Wall (the Meng Jiangnu62 theme, 1961) to the Historical Romances and the Folklore tradition in China (1970), analyzing the evolution of the oral and written versions of the Three Kingdoms theme. His latest book broadened this perspective, focusing on the evolution of the presentation of personages in Chinese xiaoshuo and its predecessors: From Myth to Novel (1979).63 Riftin has combined this kind of research with a broad and energetic effort to publicize Chinese folklore and fiction as editor and translator,64 presenting and analyzing folktales of the Dungans, a Soviet minority of Chinese origin in Kirghizia and Kazachstan. Although Riftin's research is far-reaching, I shall comment on only one aspect of his work, particularly relevant for an understanding of the Soviet approach to Ming and Qing fiction, but even more so for the interrelation of oral and written versions65 6IThe oral literature of the Dungans, a Moslem minority living in the Soviet Union and originating partly from Gansu, partly from Shanxi, has been collected as Dunganskie narodnye skazki i predanija (Dungan Popular Tales and Traditions), Moscow, 1977. B. Riftin has participated in the preparation of this volume as translator, commentator, and editor. He has compared the differences between the known written Chinese sources and the oral Dungan versions, for instance of the drama Zhang sheng zhu hai (Dungan version no. 4) or of a story from the Sanyan cycle (Dungan version no. 71). 62Meng Jiangnu is the woman seeking her husband who died building China's Great Wall as one soldier among the thousands working for the First Qin Emperor. This thematic cycle had been singled out since the twenties for research by the historian Gu Jiegang, by Hu Shi, Lu Gong and others. An important subgenre of this plot theme appears in the baojuan VA (precious scroll) genre and has recently been translated: E. S. Stulova, Baojuan o Puming' (The Baojuan about Puming), Moscow, 1979. The author has analyzed a rare text preserved in Leningrad of the form of the baojuan, printed in 1599. This is the first translation of a baojuan in a Western language. The early Baojuan texts preached the doctrine of religious sects, and this kind of literature was consequently nearly destroyed under the Qing, which saw it as a rebelious threat to their rule. 63Riftin, Skazanie o velikoj stene i problema zanra v kitajskom folklore (The Tale about the Great Wall and the Problem of the Genre in the Chinese Folklore), Moscow, 1961; Riftin, Istori6eskaja epopeja ifol'klornaja tradicija v Kitae, Ustnye i kniznye versii "Troecarstvija" (The Historical Epos and the Folklore Tradition in China; Oral and Written Versions of the "Three Kingdoms"), Moscow, 1970; Riftin, Ot mifa k romanu, Evolucija izobrazenija personaza v kitajskoj literature (From Myth to the Novel.

Hasanov, and I Jusupov. 65The result of Riftin's research is an interesting commentary on Idema's thesis of the relative independence of different oral and written xiaoshuo subgenres (W. L. Idema, Chinese Vernacular Fiction, The Formative Period, Leiden, 1974). Riftin presented an article on problems of style in the Chinese written romances</page><page sequence="18">168 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 6 (1984) of plots and themes in a national epic tradition in general. Riftin's study of narrative fiction, focusing on Three Kingdoms, shows that the perspective of a development from oral forms to written texts (after which written version and growing literacy destroy the oral tradition, as Lord has observed on the Balkan), seems not to be the only possible outcome of this evolutionary process. In China there has continued to exist a late oral tradition of the Sanguo even after the popularization of Luo Guanzhong's fourteenth century version, which had used earlier folk books (pinghua) forms. Oral Sanguo ver- sions have been collected during the fifties and sixties in this century. After comparing these late oral forms with the written Luo version, Riftin comes to the conclusion that the later oral tradition has indeed been heavily influenced and formed by, or even based on the fourteenth century written model. The author proves convincingly this aspect of permanently existing written-oral interrelations, solving thus the much debated question as to whether the modern storyteller has been dependent on written sources, and if so, how much. Riftin has turned recently to research on the interrelations of Chinese fiction and Mongolian oral and written literature, especially on the process of translation from Chinese into Mongolian. The great classic novels have also been studied from some more specialized angles. The artist and scholar L. P. Sycev has analyzed the description of costumes and dresses worn by the heroes of the novel Dream of the Red Chamber. He found a distinct sym- bolical pattern of color, showing evident differences of attitude of the author Cao Xueqin and the writer of the final forty chapters, Gao E. This study has been incorporated in The Chinese Costume (1975) written by Sycev together with his son V. L. Sycev.66 The early development of the genre remains a challenging topic67 especially for the younger generation of Russian scholars. L. Pavlovskaja has done intensive research on the pinghua form. An analysis and translation of the reedited Pinghua of the Five Dynasties is currently in press. Pavlovskaja traced down and commented on the literary and historical sources of this popular romance; she is writing a second book about the Shihua on the Tang-monk who Procured the Holy Scriptures.68 E. Stulova published a facsimile edition of a sixteenth century woodprint Baojuan about Puming (1979).69 Her translation of and research on this baojuan text represents the first study of this interesting genre of popular literature and its structure in the West. Several secret societies, in this case the Huangtianjiao, used the baojuan term as propagandistic instrument for their religious beliefs. N. E. Boresvskaja has analyzed in several articles70 Luo Maodeng's novel Xiyangji AM E (Expedition to the Western Ocean) on the voyages of the eunuch Zheng Ho.

D. N. Voskresenskij has written several articles on the structure and style of Chinese prose literature, which also analyze such early Chinese prose theories.71 The short story in the baihua tradition was introduced in the Soviet Union mostly during the early sixties; earlier there had been more interest in translating them for a broader audience than in analyzing their evolution or other related problems. The predecessors of the Sanyan erpai 3=-X- collection (the so-called huaben72) have been the subject of a monograph by A. N. Zhelochovcev, Huaben-the Urban Short Story of Medieval China, Some Problems in the Genesis of the Genre (1969); the huaben collection Jingben tongsu xiaoshuo ,,SIJ ~S had been published some years earlier (1962) in a translation of I. T. Zograf, who analyzed the language of this compilation from a linguistic angle. K. J. Golygina analyzed The Short Story of Medieval China (1980). The essential parts of the short-story collections edited by Ling Mengchu and Feng Menglong have found a large and appreciative audience in Russia, as elsewhere in the West. In 1978 a selection of nine stories, edited by D. Voskresenskij, a specialist on the satirical novel The Scholars, reached a distribution of 100,000 copies; it was a selected reprint73 of an earlier collection with sixteen translated stories "representing all five collections being sources for Jingu qiguan 4~i4i ." The 1966 version of this collection was honored with an enthusiastic comparative preface by the writer and literary critic, Viktor Sklovskij. Voskresenskji's epilogue elaborating briefly on the origin and devel- opment of the genre has been reprinted basically unchanged in the 1978 edition. It also traces the history of Russian translations of baihua stories back to the early years of this century, beginning with A. I. Ivanov, B. A. Vasil'ev, and V. S. Kolokolov during the twenties.74 Single stories of the Sanyan apparently were so popular with the public that they could be printed during the fifties in editions of 300,000 copies. During the sixties, B. A. Vel'gus and I. E. Ciperovic finally presented a translation of twenty of the forty stories in Jingu qiguan. Voskresenskij suggests elsewhere75 that this forty-story selection from the Sanyan cycle was published continuously during the Qing period 71On D. N. Voskresenskij's articles see the bibliography in Fedorenko, Heritage. Voskresenskij has other interesting articles on Taoist and Buddhist concepts of prose literature, on the interrelation of historical writing and belles-lettres on individualism in Chinese literature, on the government examinations and their role in prose literature, on utopian motives in prose writing, and on Western-Chinese literary interrelations. 72A.

Voskresenskij has edited a collection of huaben and stories from the medieval compilations published in 1981. The same author has shown the further development of the xiaoshuo genre, analyzing Li Yu's collection Shierlou +-? (The Twelve Towers)76 and relating it to Li's novel Rouputuan eiS (The Prayer Mat of Flesh) from a structural angle. Vos- kresenskij notes that a new stage in the art of short story writing had been reached with the Tower cycle: for the first time an author is writing directly for his public, organizing his collection consciously as stories within a story, doing away with super- natural or heroic plots. Voskresenskij would have arrived at even more precise results had he taken into account the development of the writer Li Yu himself, which began with his first collection Wushengxi Xait (Theater Without Sound). Furthermore, Vos- kresenskij might have emphasized more clearly that The Twelve Towers did not influ- ence short story writing to the extent of giving the entire tradition of the following two centuries a direction similar to that Li chose for himself. Voskresenskij touched upon another interesting topic, leading us from the vernac- ular short story to stories written in classical wenyan style. He delved into the problem of how elements of the terse wenyan style77 entered vernacular baihua literature as soon as an author considered his xiaoshuo as vehicle for more "serious" assertions; this has to be considered as a particularly interesting linguistic phenomenon, as many xiaoshuo pieces originally could be traced back to at least one source written in wenyan. VI. Stories in Classical Language The Tang novelettes and the biji-tradition of random notes by literati might be called predecessors of the wenyan short stories, a genre which culminated in the col- lections of Pu Songling (seventeenth century), followed by Yuan Mei's and Ji Yun's selections from the eighteenth century. Translations of the chuanqi novelettes78 mainly presented by A. Tishkov and the Leningrad specialist of Chinese fiction in wenyan and baihua, 0. Fisman, have been received very well; an earlier scholarly edition by the editiorial house of the Academy of Science was soon republished in 1960 by a general publisher. A new selection of Tang stories was published in 1970 as Idler and Magician. I. Sokolova has written a dissertation about the Tang chuanqi.79 Following efforts at first translations, Russian scholars have entered a phase of more specialized research on this genre, beginning with L.

Superseding an earlier collection by A. Tishkov, an anthology of early classical prose under the title Purple Jade80 has gone into print covering the periods of Han, Wei and the Six Dynasties, including many texts translated for the first time. Another anthology is Classical Prose of the Far East (1975). K. J. Golygina in her Chinese Tales of the Miraculous (1980) has analyzed the collection Jiandeng xinhua ffi*MI (New Tales Under the Lamp) by the fourteenth century author Qu You Wti and the prehistory of the chuanqi xiaoshuo W4/J't genre. Of considerable interest is her research on the influence of this wenyan collection on Korean, Japanese, and especially Vietnamese literature.81 Liaozhai zhiyi P 0 t e f (Strange Stories from the Liao Studio), written down in well- balanced classical style by the unsuccessful official Pu Songling from Shandong prov- ince, must have exerted a tremendous influence on the Chinese mind since its publi- cation in the second half of the seventeenth century. Alekseev considered this collection of stories as stylistic masterpieces and devoted much of his time to collecting editions, doing research on the personality of Pu and his attitudes expressed through his writing, to translating this book and to teaching wenyan courses at the University of Leningrad with the Liaozhai as textbook. During his years in China from 1906 to 1909, which remain vivid before our eyes through his posthumously published diary,82 Alekseev became convinced that Pu's collection had to be considered the most popular book in China at the turn of the century, equally read by the educated and appreciated by the illiterate who had access through the versions of the storytellers. Alekseev admired the superior wenyan style and the versatility of Pu as a novelist and literati storyteller:83 eventually he was able to introduce these stories to the general reader in Russia, abandoning all boring sinological technical verbiage, commenting from a background of broad knowledge about China's "little tradition" and, with much intuition, placing Pu's collection into the broader context of world literature. Thus the Russian versions of Liaozhai have seen a great many editions, nearly all published in about 50,000 copies with each printing. Alekseev published within 15 years (1922, 1923, 1928, and 1937) four volumes covering about one third of the original collection; all four have been combined and republished84 for the public in 1970 and 80Rasskazy o neobycajnom Sbornik dotanskih novell (Tales about the Unusual, A Collection of Pre-Tang Stories), Moscow, 1977 is a second edition of A.

Pu's tales have been also presented to the Ukrainian public in an edition under the title Monks-Magicians (1980).85 Long before Ejdlin's 1970 edition there had been popular reprints for the press by the well-known diplomat and sinologist N. T. Fedorenko86 in 1955 and 1957 or the Ustin Fajngar edition of 1961. The Ejdlin edition preserves Alekseev's preface to his first volume of 1922 and in somewhat abridged form the main statements from the prefaces of the other three volumes, interesting particularly as evidence of Alekseev's theoretical thinking about the process of translating87 literary wenyan. Alekseev was a daring translator of classical Chinese texts throughout his life, as demonstrated for instance, in the posthumously published volume88 of wenyan prose (1958), which includes texts up to the Song dynasty. The growing Liaozhai collection in its four stages remains a vivid example of Alekseev's attempt to live up to his rigid ideal of abandoning the conventions of the Western translator who has tended to adapt somewhat and reconstruct the terse wenyan style. His versions became sometimes awkward, it is true, and the more extreme examples of this style have suffered under an approach that is too radical, as some sinologists readily concede today. Alekseev, especially in his last volume, settled down for a Russian prose more and more in the direction of a strictly philological rendering, without, however, letting it become a "laboratory translation." This approach reminds the reader very much of his several versions of translating which he produced in his famous seminal book of 1916 on the Tang poet Sikong Tu89 and the poet's views of the creative process. Alekseev's Russian prose90 finally comes so near to the original that he did tell his potential critics his version could easily be used as textbook samples for aspiring young scholars in the sinological field. 0. Fisman followed and broadened the tradition of Alekseev's research and trans- lation activity in the field of wenyan fiction. Already in 1963 she had published several stories by Yuan Mei in a more comprehensive collection of Asian short stories. In 1977 she published a translation and study of the New Qixie or What Confucius did not speak about,91 where she commented on all 1,023 pieces of this widely read collection of 85The selection in Ukranian was published by I.

Both took this title from Alekseev's first volume in 1922. Fedorenko republished 49 stories from the volumes of 1922 and 1928, omitting two. The Alekseev volumes of 1923 and 1937 were republished by Fedorenko in 1957 (105 stories). 87Alekseev comments on the problems of translation in his prefaces of 1928 and 1937. 88For other translations from wenyan see Alekseev's Kitajskaja klassiceskaja proza (Chinese Classical Prose), Moscow, 1958 likewise edited by L.

The more representative ones from the point of view of the plot, altogether some 360 stories, are fully translated. With this book she concluded her basic research for a study: Three Chinese Novelists: Pu Songling, Ji Yun, and Yuan Mei (1980);92 in 1974 she had already published as a preliminary step Ji Yun's Notes from the cottage "Great Within Small."93 The Yuan Mei book with its rather clumsy Russian title treats in about 100 pages several aspects besides the life and times of this talented writer, poet, and literary critic of the eighteenth century, who is well-known in the West, since A. Waley published his monographical problems of research on this genre; she presents the results of a statistical comparison of the short stories by Yuan Mei and Ji Yun; following S. Thomp- son's "Motif Index" and Eberhard's classification, Fisman has developed a plot index with a complex formula characterizing each story.94 In Yuan's collection, with its mocking and thus somewhat dangerous title (the collection presented the reader with all the stories about the supernatural Confucius "declined to talk about"), there are preserved many older stories and beliefs; L. Wieger and De Groot had already used this material for their books on Chinese folklore and religion at the beginning of the century, and W. Eberhard relied on it for his typology of Chinese short stories and "Volksmarchen." The collections of Pu, Ji and Yuan have a heavy local flavor, as Fisman proved by her statistics: Pu Songling's stories are basically from Shandong, Yuan Mei's from the provinces Zhejiang and Jiangsu. Fisman's comparison of Yuan's collection character- izing the lower level of religious beliefs in Qing China with Ji Yun's biji volume, combining narrative and non-narrative writings, shows basic differences in the attitude of both authors. Yuan Mei, more of an author than simply a kind of transmitter, saw entertainment as the basic function of his collection, mocking Confucian agnosticism and rationalism; Ji Yun, on the other hand, emphasized the didactic function. As he "thought in ethical and not in social categories, (he) used fantasy as a medium through which the reader could be taught." Pu Songling, however, used the fantastic themes of the supernatural as a "corrective to actuality" offering veiled criticism of his society and its institutions. Fisman has thus arrived with her step-by-step monographical approach at a clas- sification and systematisation of this type of wenyan literature, opening up new per- spectives for further research on the remaining rich biji materials of the Qing period. Monographical research on some of the more important minor forms as jokes (xiao- hua) or shorter essays (xiaopin) certainly would yield valuable and quite amusing insights into traditional literary psychology. The Leningrad sinologist I. E. Ciperovic, translator of Wonderful Stories New and Old (Jingu qiguan) has studied in much detail such a minor genre, the zazhuan ~4, sometimes comparable to G. C. Lichtenberg's or S. J. Lec's 920. L.

Ciperovic's booklet Zazhuan, Maxims of the Chinese Writers (1969)95 is based on her dissertation, finished the same year. She has translated all the consecutive versions of this peculiar literary form, which face- tiously mixes colloquial and wenyan style, subordinating several lines under a more general theme of the zazhuan. This form is said to have originated from the Tang poet Li Shangyin biE , finding such imitators as Su Shi during the Song or Wei Guangfu and a Lu Lu during the Qing dynasty. Ciperovic also traces the influence of the zazhuan form on the Japanese woman writer Sei Shonagon (tenth/eleventh century). Fresh and vivid, the zazhuan expresses sudden insights of everyday life. Ciperovic's study is particularly useful because this literary form has not attracted much interest in the PRC since Lu Xun treated it cursorily in his history of vernacular literature. In the Soviet Union before Ciperovic's rather exhausting study, academician Konrad and 0. Fisman had commented on it; in the West, there exist only renditions of those zazhuan, attrib- uted to Li, translated by E. D. Edwards and G. Bonmarchant. VII. Theater The history of Chinese drama has been presented in the Soviet Union in several works; major plays have been translated or introduced in abridged versions. More recent studies of the historical develoment were I. V. Gajda's Chinese Traditional Theatre Xiqu (1971) and S. A. Serova's Peking Opera From the Middle of the Nineteenth Century to the 1940s (1979). Sorokin published in 1979, after a decade of research on this topic, an admirably documented monograph on Yuan drama of the thirteenth-fourteenth century, the first serious presentation of this early form of Chinese theater96 in the Soviet Union. Among translations one should mention, concerning the pre-Ming period, an anthology of eleven Yuan plays, edited by the Leningrad sinologists V. V. Petrov and L. Men'sikov (1966), a version of the Xixiangji fWi (Western Chamber; 1960) and an anthology of Chinese drama from the Yuan to Qing in the volume Classical Theater of the East97, distributed in 303,000 copies: Sorokin and other collaborators present extracts of China's most famous plays Pipaji ~iM- (Record of the Lute), Changshengdian -li (The Palace of Eternity) and Taohuashan VMS (The Peach Blossom Fan). This collection includes full translations of Yuan dramas by Guan Hanqing, Ma Zhiyuan and Zhang Tingyu, as well as the anonymous Shagouji. =E (Record of the Dog Slain). In addition there is a full version of an one act zaju-play by Yang Chaoguan (eighteenth century). Collaborators of this collection were Men'sikov, who published an earlier book about the modernization of traditional theater, and T. A. Malinovskaja, who 95I. E.

Mali- novskaja has written, since her dissertation (1970) on Hong Sheng AiA, the author of The Palace of Eternity, a series of a dozen articles99 on Ming and Qing drama, particularly the late zaju genre. She has treated such authors as Feng Menglong, Meng Chengshun, Sun Renru, Xu Wei and Zhu Youdun. L. N. Guseva has written a series of articles?00 on Kong Shanren and his play The Peach Blossom Fan. The aesthetics of Chinese classical drama have been analysed through a mono- graphical approach by Serova. She chose to translate and interpret the dramatic the- oretical work Mingxinjing (Mirror of Enlightenment; 1979)101 by the actor and writer Huang Fanchuo from the end of the eighteenth century. This booklet, printed only in 1917, was used as theoretical and practical guide for the beginning actor; thus it might be called a small encyclopedia of the scenic arts, most useful also for Western students of the intricacies of late traditional Chinese drama. Important Chinese sources of Ser- ova's analysis have been the writings of Zhou Yibai Jl@B and Wu Xinlei AMW. In her analysis, Serova gives a survey of the history of Chinese dramatic theories and treatises, concentrating in more detail on the kunqu style. Strictly speaking, the cinema was not of much influence during the last years of the Qing. A short outline of the development of Chinese film102 between 1896 and 1966 by S. A. Toropcev (1979) thus has but a few pages on the early history of the art. The author concentrates mainly on the Chinese film of the PRC up to the Cultural Revolution. This book is more a political-ideological than an artistic commentary on the ups and downs of official policy in this field. VIII.

It is to be regretted that Toropcev, who has published before on this topic, Kinodramaturgija KNR 50-ch godov (Cine-dramaturgy of the PRC during the Fifties), Moscow, 1971, has omitted the radical policies in the decade up to 1976. His evaluation of the post-Mao era certainly is too rash, when he concludes that the "new leadership is in no way prepared to re-evaluate the Maoist policies of the last year." At least the growing influence of "bourgeois" Western films should be hinted at. China will certainly not "go back to the revolutionary traditions which developed in the cinematographic field during the first years of the PRC" (p. 204). Toropcev's book is useful because of its cinematographic chronology of film titles from 1905 to 1966. 175</page><page sequence="26">176 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 6 (1984) with a preface of the noted historian L. P. Deljusin.103 The booklet, using the form of a historical novel, is fluently written and well documented, relying on literary as well as other sources. It certainly does not pretend to be oblivious of the parallels which were drawn by the Shanghai faction around Mao's wife Jiang Qing :*t while she aspired to become the figurehead of a radical post-Mao government. While the pre- 1976 picture of Cixi was whitewashed and polished by the propagandists of the Leftist faction, Semanov opposed the apparent "tendency of rehabilitation" in earlier Western and more recent Chinese writing. He indicated the dark sides of this cunning, narrow- minded and cruel woman on the throne, thus evoking a disturbing picture of dark unrest for the future in the PRC. Luckily, the political implications of this book were to be forgotten the moment it was published, since the aims of China's radicals were thwarted in October 1976. Semanov's fictionalized report then became quite popular in its own right and was soon republished. IX. An Evaluation What are the characteristics of Soviet scholarship in the field of Chinese literature where broader trends and tendencies can be discerned, judging from the results of the sixties and the seventies? This question and any attempt at an answer lead away from the more narrow perspective of China's last two dynasties and its literature. A eval- uation has to take into account the complicated interrelationship between literary research and society, or sometimes even more clearly that between the scholarly community and the political elite. It is easy for the scholar working in the West to look down on certain peculiarities of Soviet research, no matter whether metholology, mastery of the sources, intensity, or neglect of topics and themes are concerned. A somewhat high-handed attitude, which colors E. S. Kirby's evaluation of Soviet studies (1975) to a certain extent, some- times cannot be avoided. In my own survey of China Studies in the Soviet Union (1972) which focuses on the years 1965 to 1971, it is true, I also came to the conclusion that "the value of historical writings on modern China at first place has to be seen in the fact that it states or restates the Soviet viewpoint." It is, however, dangerous to rely on such generalized conclusions too rigidly. Even in certain problem areas of contem- porary Chinese history some Western scholars have been able to challenge generally accepted earlier views by basing their research on newly published Soviet sources104 and documentation. In any case, I feel that a more reserved outlook of the Western scholar evaluating Soviet scholarship and writings on China, leading often to very superficial reading, should be essentially confined to the field where Soviet political expertise and the party's necessities have joined into an uneasy alliance. Soviet scholarship in the field of Chinese literature as well as the parallel activity of translating and popularizing works of Chinese authors are of high quality, as the 103V. I.

A Soviet evaluation, calling it "second only to research in China and possibly Japan" has, on the other hand, to be somewhat qualified as I tried to suggest in the introductory remarks of this chapter; but the record remains remarkable, at least from an European perspective. Among the concrete achievements one should single out, first of all, a successful dissemination to the non-sinological scholarly community in the Soviet Union, as well as to the general reader interested in Chinese literature. Secondly, a highly organized conference activity has stimulated scholarly output and the discussion of broader issues in a more systematic way. A resulting homogeneity of approach should not be automatically mistaken for imposed ideological guidance. Thirdly, bibliographical control of the results of Soviet scholarship has been very effectively established, as demonstrated by Skackov's bibliography or Miliband's handbook on the research of Soviet Orientalists. A growing self-consciousness has led to a retrospective interest, reviewing and re- evaluating Russian China studies. The publication of Alekseev's posthumous oeuvre shows this tendency clearly in the effort to recall the activities of such early Russian China scholars as P. J. Kafarov, academician V. P. Vasil'ev, and others. Russian sin- ological "pre-history" in general has been studied in a very scholarly way, without the usual self-congratulatory statements. Finally, it should be emphasized that the gov- ernment has followed a policy of introducing regular courses on Chinese history and literature at universities and in high schools. Teachers specializing in Asia are briefed by professional sinologists at regularly scheduled conferences about new developments in the area and about new publications in their respective fields; in specialized high schools (skcola-internat) Chinese is taught as the first foreign language. On the other side, we should mention elements isolating Soviet scholarship and influencing its development negatively. Seen from outside, the Russian language remains a tremendous obstacle to international exchange. But this is after all a problem only as far as pioneering efforts are concerned. In those areas where, for example, translations duplicate those already available in the West, a report such as this suffices to apprise Western specialists of the existence of such works. The outside world could be more aware of Soviet sinology if basic reference works such as those by Skackov or Miliband, for instance, or existing surveys of the devel- opment of Russian and Soviet scholarship on China and Chinese literature were more systematically translated into English. Such a line has up to now been followed by the authorities only from a viewpoint too narrowly political. The West should also follow up with a completementary interest to have original works such as Riftin's writings105 translated into English. A more clearly defined policy of scholarly exchange, devoted primarily to such goals, might indeed prove very helpful. The second handicap, besides the language problem and its repercussions, has been limited access to Western and certain other secondary sources. The problems here stem from the lack of foreign currency, more than politics. Instead of the resulting dangers of parochialism, however, it should be added, we sometimes find methodological and thematical originality, quite ironically, just because of limited scholarly communication. In which way now have political factors channelled the energies of Soviet scholars in the field of Chinese literature and determined priorities of research and translation 10SA translation of Riftin's book on the evolution of the Sanguo cycle (note 63) is in preparation by W. L. MacDonald. 177</page><page sequence="28">178 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 6 (1984) work? The fifteen years between the end of the Second World War and the Cultural Revolution (ca.1950-ca.1965) have meant a tremendous effort in the Soviet Union of popularizing modem China, and especially the China of the People's Republic. Hand- icapped by lingering Stalinist reservations against "cosmopolitanism," scholarship has tended to follow rather uncritically concepts and ideas accepted in China at that time. A tremendous number of literary works, accepted ideologically, from the formative period of modern Chinese literature before 1949 and from the first decade of the PRC were translated into Russian. A whole generation of younger Soviet scholars profited from years of studying and doing research in China. This phase of officially sanctioned China-enthusiasm thus deserves its own in-depth analysis of the Soviet explorations into contemporary Chinese literature. The subsequent fifteen years (ca.1966-ca.1980) saw an abrupt end to this large- scale literary vulgarization, because of the Sino-Soviet rift. Soviet scholars came to the decision to translate very selectively literary works from the twenties, thirties and forties. The Soviet research on Ming and Qing fiction outlined here has developed in this social-political atmosphere. People originally more oportunistically interested in the PRC found a new outlet as writers, contributing polemics for the heavy unfolding ideological battle against Maoism. Among literary scholars there emerged instead a noticeable redirection towards traditional Chinese literature. Scholars have come to concentrate in recent years on traditional literary theory or on classical fiction and drama. It might even be called an outright re-orientation towards "bourgeois" sinology, as represented by the Alekseev school. However, post '79 literature is translated and received with much enthusiasm by the Soviet public. It seems quite remarkable to me that the Sino-Soviet invectives did not spread into literary scholarship. They were merely transformed and channeled into harsh criticism of radical Maoist cultural pol- icies, criticism corroborated by the Chinese media themselves since 1977. Many sin- ologists since the sixties have devoted themselves to traditional literature, ignoring the current political upheavals as effectively as possible. This kind of development, in a way, is the Soviet version of the perennial conflict between "traditional" and "modem" studies in China, the conflict between a concept of "relevance" relying primarily on "partijnost"' and a broader mission of mutual cross- cultural understanding. A connotation of evasiveness can also be perceived, the wish of some scholars to stay aloof from the exigencies of the day with their often awkward twists and turns. To put it in Chinese terms, this development has certainly helped the formation of more "Confucian" or more "Taoist" inclined temperaments within the scholarly communities of Leningrad and Moscow. Witnessing the recent euphoria in the West concerning things Chinese in general and modem Chinese literature in particular, I am also sure that not only the Soviet literary scholar is fully aware of certain obvious parallels between the soviet Fifties and the American/European Eighties in this regard. Ironically, it seems that certain trends have to be experienced again separately and at different times in different social systems.</page></plain_text>
