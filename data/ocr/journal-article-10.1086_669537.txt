         <italic>What Are Little Boys and Girls Made Of?</italic> seeks to address “gender issues in children’s literature” in one slim volume, an ambitious goal that the contributors approach through diverse topics and approaches. This collection’s breadth is one of its many strengths but also at times contributes to a sense of scatteredness. Coeditor Paola Bottalla’s introduction reflects the volume’s variety and provides examples of the many roles and activities of girls and boys in fiction for young people. She draws upon nursery rhymes, fairy tales, and other children’s literature from across periods, genres, and cultural traditions, with an emphasis on British literature and tales from her native Italy. The introduction returns frequently to fairy tales and their literary successors and ultimately claims that “all the essays [in the volume] highlight different aspects of the dynamics between masculine and feminine principles in children’s fairy tales” (xiv). Given this apparent focus, an overview of the historical relationship between children’s literature and fairy tales would have helped to contextualize the chapters and alert the reader to differing views on this affiliation. The introduction expresses a Bettelheimian conviction that fairy tales (and all children’s literature) play an essential role in childhood development, <sup>1</sup> twice invoking the “psychic forces” that such stories presumably contain and convey (iv, vii). It does so, however, without interrogating its own ideological positioning and does not address conflicting claims, such as J. R. R. Tolkien’s contention that the association between children and fairy tales is “an accident of our domestic history” rather than a fundamental pairing, a view shared by Tolkien’s colleague C. S. Lewis. <sup>2</sup>

      <p>However, the essays cover much more territory than fairy tales alone. The contributors explore topics as disparate as the gendered implications of animal figures and stories for children (Francesca Orestano), boy protagonists’ conceptions of duty (Lisa Sainsbury), and girlhood in American neo-slave narratives (Anna Scacchi). Chapters by Alessandra Petrina and Monica Santini discuss the representation of adult femininity in two popular children’s fantasy series—J. K. Rowling’s <italic>Harry Potter</italic> books (1997–2007) and Philip Pullman’s <italic>His Dark Materials</italic> trilogy (1995–2000)—although, surprisingly, in light of the volume’s stated focus, they do not make arguments for grouping fantasy with fairy tale. As a result, the book embodies a tension between the desire to present a thematically continuous collection and the attempt to include as many angles on gender in children’s literature as possible, with a bias toward tales of the magical and fantastic.</p>
      <p>Peter Hunt’s essay, the first chapter after Bottalla’s introduction, provides a valuable overview for the scholar interested in the broader topic of gender representations in children’s literature. It outlines major works and trends in children’s literature gender norms since John Newbery’s foundational <italic>A Little Pretty Pocketbook</italic> (1744), which proclaims itself dedicated to “the Instruction and Amusement of little Master Tommy and Pretty Miss Polly” (4). The chapter also offers essential critical groundwork for the field, raising the classic problem of how adult critics can write about texts intended for children that were in turn written by other adults. These layers of interpretation and intent obscure access to the true “psychological impact” (13) that reading has on children, calling into question criticism that seeks to pass moral judgment on individual texts. Nevertheless, Hunt also asserts that “little boys and girls are made of the gendering that they absorb from the culture—and they absorb it directly from literature” (14). This statement alludes to the commonly held belief that children’s literature is necessarily didactic and therefore directly formative of gender identities, a belief that can compel the adult critic to read (and write) as if with nurturing, socializing intentions for potential child readers.</p>
      <p>This need not always be the case, however, and the remaining chapters in the collection represent not only a variety of children’s texts and approaches to gender but also a range of ideas about what it means to write children’s literature criticism. Orestano’s chapter on animal stories and figures provides an example of the kind of criticism that reads children’s literature as illustrative of adult attitudes toward childhood; in this case, the child is positioned between animal and civilized human. She weighs the “traditional symbolic morality” (23) of anthropomorphism against the rise in what she calls “evolutionary” descriptions of animals, especially since Darwin. Her analysis of animal characters and societies in works from Aesop’s fables to <italic>His Dark Materials</italic> argues for the possibility of resolving these often-opposing approaches, integrating scientific notions of animalism with a range of culturally formed gender identities.</p>
      <p>Laura Tosi’s chapter also surveys a number of texts, drawing attention to the polarization of gender roles in children’s literature from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as well as the subversion of these roles in Victorian fairy tales by Dinah Craik, Oscar Wilde, and Mary de Morgan. Tosi is forthright in advocating for these tales, arguing that their “empowered princesses and compassionate princes” offer “visions of a more equal, horizontal society” and the possibility of transcending traditional gender boundaries (51). Bottalla’s succeeding chapter on Wilde’s fairy tales is also largely a celebration of the author and his stories for children and asserts an innate connection between Wilde as “a poet in prose” (57) and youth, “singled out by their own nature to have their hearts broken” (61).</p>
      <p>In spite of the continuity between Tosi’s and Bottalla’s analyses of Wilde, most of the other chapters in the collection seem to function independent of one another, all focusing on just a few texts or authors. The major exception to this rule is Petrina’s and Santini’s differing views about Rowling’s treatment of female figures in <italic>Harry Potter</italic> : Petrina counters claims that Rowling’s books are sexist, arguing that the significance of Harry’s dead mother’s love can be read as a supernatural power that drive the series’s characters and narrative. This move, according to Petrina, places women and femininity at the heart of the saga, whereby Harry “deliberately copie[s] his mother’s sacrifice” (101) of her life for him in a way that also invokes the Christian story. In contrast, Santini’s enthusiastic chapter on the active and desiring witches of <italic>His Dark Materials</italic> establishes her position of advocacy for more direct forms of feminine agency in children’s fantasy. She continues in this vein in her afterword on Rowling’s <italic>Tales of Beedle the Bard</italic> (2008), a collection of fairy tales from Harry’s wizarding world. Santini laments the “conventional and passive” (146) female figures in these stories, as well as their relative scarcity.</p>
      <p>What unites Petrina’s and Santini’s readings of Rowling is a shared belief in the need for “positive” models of femininity in books for children, a noble cause that nonetheless relies upon adult presumptions about the uses and meanings of children’s literature. This prescriptivism enters into several of the chapters in this volume, as it often does in even the most scholarly children’s literature criticism. This book will be of interest to academics who are new to the study of gender in children’s literature, as well as to those looking to round out their reading on recent children’s fantasy and nineteenth-century fairy tales, especially those by Oscar Wilde.</p>
