Unlike the highland Maya Quiche, there is no detailed Popol Vuh epic describing the various gods involved in the cosmogonic acts of creation. Instead, narrative allusions to particular Yucatec gods must be garnered piecemeal from Yucatec and Spanish Colonial sources. Many of the deity names mentioned in these early accounts cannot even be identified in the pre-Hispanic corpus of Maya art. In part, the confusion derives from the eclectic nature of Post-Classic Yucatec religion. Yucatec religion was strongly polytheistic, with a myriad of divinities with frequently overlapping if not competing attributes and functions. Foreign deities were enthusiastically accepted into the Post-Classic pantheon, often with minimal modi- fication. A number of gods were clearly foreign Post-Classic introductions, although it is becom- ing increasingly evident that the great majority can be traced to the Classic Maya. Primary Sources for the Study of Post- Classic Maya Gods The most important corpus of imagery pertain- ing to ancient Maya gods is contained in a group of three pre-Hispanic Maya screenfold books, known as the Dresden, Paris, and Madrid cod- ices. A fourth recently reported codex, the Gro- lier, is but ten painted pages of a once larger screenfold. The Grolier fragment is concerned pri- marily with gods and calendrics pertaining to Ve- nus and is of comparatively limited use for the broader study of ancient Maya gods. All of the surviving codices are Post-Classic in date, and aside from the Grolier, it is clear that the group derives from the Peninsula of Yucatan. This provenience is indicated primarily by style, calendrical conventions, and the presence of Yucatecan words phonetically written in the hiero- glyphic codical texts (see Campbell 1984: 5). Maya codices are composed of folded bark pa- per painted on both sides with a thin layer of plaster. The text and figures painted upon the plaster surfaces tend to be in black and red, with particular passages delineated by vertical or hori- zontal red bands. Remains of Classic Maya cod- ices have been discovered at Uaxactun, San Agustin Acasaguastlan, Nebaj, Altun Ha, and Mirador (Lee 1985: 28). However, all of these examples are in very poor states of preservation and tell us little concerning the appearance and content of Classic Maya screenfold books. Iconographic research by Michael Coe (1977) has not only identified the presence of folded cod- ices in Classic Maya art, but also particular gods and tools pertaining to the scribal arts. Following a suggestion by Lin Crocker, Coe (1978: 16) sub- sequently suggested that a certain type of Late Classic black and white vessel was based on the format of codices. In this case, the red bands ap- pearing at the rim and base of the "codex style" vessel would correspond to the horizontal bands delineating distinct passages within a manuscript. Although these ceramic vessels do closely resem- ble the appearance of codices, it is still highly unlikely that they functioned in a similar context. Codices, and not vases, were surely the primary 1</page><page sequence="9">means of recording detailed religious and histori- cal information during the Classic period. More- over, it is now known that much of the hiero- glyphic writing appearing on Classic codex style vases and bowls pertains specifically to ceramic vessels, not screenfold books (Houston, Stuart, and Taube 1989). A terse account by Fray Diego de Landa sug- gests that both historical and ritual matters were recorded in the Maya screenfolds of Post-Classic Yucatan: These people also made use of certain characters or letters, with which they wrote in their books their ancient matters and their sciences, and by these and by drawings and by certain signs in these drawings, they understood their affairs and made others under- stand them and taught them, (in Tozzer 1941: 169) Although somewhat damaged, the Relation of Gaspar Antonio Chi also suggests the presence of historical information: "[They wrote in their books the] outstanding events which had occurred [in their history and prophesies] of their prophets, and the lives, [feasts and conquests] of the nobles" (translation and emendations by J. Thompson 1972: 6). However, the surviving pre-Hispanic codices do not contain detailed accounts of legends and history. They are divinatory almanacs dealing primarily with calendrical and ritual matters. The codices are largely composed of almanacs provid- ing prognostications for particular calendrical cy- cles, such as the 260-day calendar, the 365-day vague year, the 584-day Venus cycle, and the Tun and Katun periods. Thus, although the surviving screenfolds provide invaluable information on par- ticular gods, rituals, and cosmology, this informa- tion is not portrayed in a narrative mode. Each deity tends to appear in isolation, serving as a marker for a particular divinatory prognostica- tion. Moreover, it is often clear that many of the offering and objects appearing in a scene are not specific to the god illustrated, but rather refer to the augury. Thus a whole series of gods may ap- pear holding the same offering or engaged in the same sacrificial act. Even with the background pro- vided by ethnohistoric documents, such as the Yucatec books of Chilam Balam, the Quichean Popol Vuh, and the frequently narrative imagery on Classic Maya vessels, the codices provide little information on Post-Classic Yucatec mythology. Although the Post-Classic Maya codices con- tain only tangential allusions to mythic events, they constitute an unsurpassed corpus delineating the physical characteristics and attributes of par- ticular deities. Despite obvious stylistic differ- ences, the Dresden, Paris, and Madrid codices con- tain many of the same gods, usually with shared complexes of physical attributes and symbolic as- sociations. Thus the situation is analogous to the Late Post-Classic Borgia Group of Mexican cod- ices, where Tezcatlipoca, Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl, Chalchiuhtlicue, and other major deities can be identified easily in all of the five screenfolds (see Spranz 1973). 1 However, whereas most deities of the Borgia Group cannot be readily seen in earlier Classic iconography, the gods appearing in the Post-Classic Maya codices are generally of great antiquity and can be traced to the beginnings of the Classic Maya era. Thus the Maya gods occur- ring in the Post-Classic Yucatecan codices are of paramount importance for understanding the Clas- sic as well as the Post-Classic Maya pantheon. The codical series of Post-Classic deities serves as an excellent template on which to categorize the frequently complex divinities appearing in both Classic and Post-Classic Maya iconography. The Codex Dresden Of the three Yucatecan codices, the Codex Dresden provides the clearest and most precise information regarding the attributes and names of Maya gods. Although Thompson (1972: 15) ar- gues that the manuscript dates to the Early Post- Classic period, recent iconographic research indi- cates that this codex is probably Late Post-Classic 1 In the tradition of Seler, Spranz, Nicholson, and others, gods appearing in the Borgia Group of codices will be referred to by Nahuatl terminology. Although it is by no means cer- tain which linguistic groups fashioned the Borgia, Vaticanus B, Cospi, Fejervary-Mayer, and Laud codices, such Nahuatl names as Mictlantecuhtli, Cinteotl, and Tlaloc serve as conve- nient and concise means of referring to specific gods. Al- though they could also be labeled the Death God, Maize God, and Rain God, these general terms obscure the many specific characteristics of these deities, traits also found with their Az- tec Nahuatl counterparts. 2</page><page sequence="10">(Paxton 1986; Taube and Bade 1991). For the study of Maya gods, especially important sections are the series of gods ranging across pages 2 to 23, the Venus pages on pages 24 and 46 to 50, and the new year pages on pages 25 to 28. Purchased in Vienna in 1739, the codex was acquired by the Koniglichen Bibliothek zu Dresden in 1740 (Glass and Robertson 1975: 125). Unfortunately the Co- dex Dresden suffered extensive water damage dur- ing the bombing of Dresden in World War II, and for this reason much of my analysis will rely on the 1892 facsimile edition by Forstemann, repub- lished by Thompson (1972). The Codex Paris The first report of the Codex Paris was in 1859, when it was discovered in the Paris National Li- brary by Leon de Rosny; how and when the li- brary acquired the document is entirely un- known. Unfortunately the Codex Paris is poorly preserved, and much of the painted stucco surface has worn away, leaving only the central portion of each page. The succession of the roughly twenty-year Katuns on pages 1 to 12 constitutes the most useful passage pertaining to Maya gods, although valuable information can also be gleaned from other of the fragmentary scenes and texts. Sylvanus Morley (1920: 575-57 6) notes the strik- ing similarity between the Paris Katun pages and Mayapan Stela 9. Morley tentatively dates Stela 9 to 12.4.0.0.0 10 Ahau 18 Uo, the Katun immedi- ately preceding the abandonment of Mayapan in Katun 8 Ahau. Although its precise provenance remains unknown, the Codex Paris may well date to the height of the Mayapan confederacy, that is, during the early half of the fifteenth century. The Codex Madrid The Codex Madrid is also known as the Codex Tro-Cortesianus, owing to the fact that it was first considered as two separate screenfolds, the Codex Troano and the Codex Cortesianus. Both frag- ments appeared at approximately the same time, the Troano in 1866, and the Cortesianus in 1867 (Glass and Robertson 1975: 153). Leon de Rosny (1881) was the first to note that the two parts con- stituted a single manuscript. Although sloppily executed, the Madrid codex is an especially impor- tant source for the study of Late Post-Classic Yucatec gods. In part, its value derives from sheer size. It is the longest of the pre-Hispanic Maya codices, containing fifty-six leaves, in contrast to thirty-nine leaves in the Codex Dresden, eleven leaves in the Paris, and ten leaves in the Grolier. In addition, of the surviving codices, the Madrid is also the most similar to the early Colonial Spanish and Yucatec accounts. For example, Cyrus Thomas (1882) long ago noted the close correspon- dence between the yearbearer passages on pages 34 to 37 to Landa's sixteenth-century account of the rites heralding the new year. Of the four Maya screenfolds, the Madrid one seems to be especially late and may well derive from the northwestern portion of Yucatan, the region most extensively documented by Landa and other Colonial sources. Although the content of the Codex Madrid can be often compared to early ethnohistoric accounts, the quality of execu- tion is generally poor. This is not simply a matter of crude draftsmanship. In the case of the struc- tured and repetitive epigraphic texts, one can de- tect frequent scribal errors, and it is likely that there are also inaccuracies in the portrayal of Maya gods. For this reason, interpretations based on specific texts or iconographic details in the Codex Madrid should be made with caution, par- ticularly if they are based upon only a single scene. The Codex Grolier The Codex Grolier was first reported and pub- lished by Michael Coe (1973), who identified the manuscript as an authentic pre-Hispanic Maya co- dex. According to Coe (1973: 150), when the codex was discovered it was accompanied by a mosaic mask, currently in the collections at Dumbarton Oaks (see von Winning 1968: pl. 333). Although plaster covered both sides of the manuscript, only one side was painted with text. Coe numbered the surviving fragmentary pages 1 through 11, and suggested that the manuscript originally would have had at least twenty pages, 3</page><page sequence="11">the number required to complete the illustrated Venus section. John Carlson (1983) subsequently noted that page 1 1 is actually a fragment of page 10; thus only one half of the original twenty pages is represented. In contrast to the Venus pages in the pre-Hispanic Dresden, Vaticanus B, Borgia, and Cospi codices, the Grolier Venus illustrations do not correspond only to the heliacal rising of Venus as the morning star. In- stead, each Grolier page refers successively to one of the four Venus stations of Superior Con- junction, Evening Star, Inferior Conjunction, and Morning Star. Once repeated five times across the twenty pages, the cycle would begin again, eventually making a total of 65 Venus peri- ods, or 104 vague years of 365 days (Coe 1973: 150-151). Michael Coe (1973: 150) obtained a radiocarbon date of a.d. 1230 ± 130 from the Codex Grolier, placing it squarely in the Post-Classic period. Coe (1973: 151) notes that this date accords well with the style of the manuscript, which recalls the art of the Toltec period of Early Post-Classic Chichen Itza. J. Eric S. Thompson (1975), how- ever, points out that this date may only corre- spond to the age of the paper not to the painted manuscript. According to Thompson, the codex is probably a forgery fashioned from ancient un- painted pounded bark paper, which is relatively common in dry caves of highland Mexico (e.g., Moser 1975: fig. 10). Thompson (1975) argues that the well-known Venus cycle would be a rela- tively easy subject for a modern forger to repli- cate. However, if this be the case, why does the Codex Grolier not conform to the far better- known sequence illustrating only Venus at heliacal rising? As Coe notes, there is nothing in the Codex Grolier that suggests overt copying from other Maya sources - a common clue to forgeries. Recent studies by Carlson (1983) and Mora-Echeverria (1984) provide support that the Codex Grolier is actually authentic. Other Sources The Dresden, Paris, Madrid, and Grolier cod- ices are but one body of data pertaining to Post- Classic Maya gods. Aside from these pre- Hispanic Maya screenfolds, there are also the Post-Classic mural paintings, most notable those of Santa Rita, Tancah, and Tulum. In thematic content, the murals are frequently similar to the codices and depict gods in relation to calendrical prognostications. An example would be the mu- rals from Mound 1 at Santa Rita, which represent a series of gods oriented to the succession of the 360-day Tun cycle (J. Thompson 1950: 198). In many cases the mural scenes are as complex as any in the codices. Frequently the mural figures can be identified with particular gods known for the codices. In style, the murals of Tancah and Tulum are strikingly similar to the Paris, Dres- den, and especially Madrid codices. In addition to codices and mural painting, there is also the Late Post-Classic sculpture of the north- ern lowlands. The complex but little-studied Chen Mul Mayapan style incense burners found widely in Yucatan and Quintana Roo offer a wealth of detailed iconography. These anthropo- morphic ceramic censers are especially useful for identifying particular costume elements, since the dress and regalia appear in three-dimensional clar- ity. Although frequently crude and poorly pre- served, the limestone sculptures of Mayapan, Tulum, Santa Rita, and other Late Post-Classic sites are also useful sources, often with valuable contextual information. The Terminal Classic and Early Post-Classic ico- nography of Chichen Itza is a crucial corpus that bridges the gap between the gods of the Late Clas- sic and Late Post-Classic Maya. Images at Chichen can be related both to Terminal Classic iconogra- phy of the Puuc region and that of Late Post- Classic Yucatan. The art and iconography of Chichen Itza is highly syncretic and incorporates iconography of Central Mexico as well as that of the Maya region. In view of the complex history of contact and exchange between the Maya region and highland Mexico and the Gulf Coast, it is nec- essary to consider the Maya gods not as isolated phenomena but as integral parts in the greater ideo- logical system of ancient Mesoamerica. 4</page><page sequence="12">particular gods and scenes appearing in the Maya codices. For example, whereas Forstemann (1886, 1906) discovered the Venus passage on pages 24 and 46 to 50 of the Codex Dresden, it was Seler (1898, 1904c) who first recognized the close corre- spondence between these pages and the Venus lore of highland Mexico. Thus Seler compares the Dresden Venus pages to similar passages in the Borgia, Vaticanus B, and Cospi codices. In addi- tion, Seler explains these scenes in terms of Colo- nial Central Mexican texts, most notably the Anales de Cuauhtitlan. The work by Seler (1898, 1904c) on Maya and Mexican Venus Lore is an excellent example of the potential value of Mexican data for the analy- sis of ancient Maya religion. However, the pan- Mesoamerican approach of Seler is not always suc- cessful. A frequent source of error is the assumed degree of similarity between distinct cultures. Thus Seler commonly equates scenes from Mixtec codices with the iconography and gods of Central Mexico. According to Nancy Troike (1978), this assumption has been a major stum- bling block in our understanding of Mixtec his- tory and religion. A similar situation can be seen for Seler's studies and Maya religion, which often appears to be perceived and organized through a Central Mexican template. This problem is par- ticularly acute with his studies and Classic Maya iconography (e.g., Seler 1976). Nonetheless, it should be noted that, even during this early pe- riod of research, Seler was acknowledged as a "pioneer" (Forstemann 1906: 54). Although cer- tain of his comparisons have not been fruitful, many of Seler's contributions have proven to be fundamental to our understanding of ancient Me- soamerican religion. Paul Schellhas was one of the first to attempt the systematic identification of gods occurring in the Maya codices. In a work published in 1886, Schellhas identified the name glyphs of eight codical gods. However, as Seler (1887a) quickly pointed out, this by no means exhausts the total number of gods appearing in the Maya codices. Schellhas' (1897, 1904) subsequent publications, describing a total of fifteen gods, were the first major analyses of the deities appearing in the 5 The Study of Post-Classic Maya Gods In the latter half of the nineteenth century, a number of scholars began the difficult process of identifying the various deities found in the pre- Hispanic Maya screenfolds (e.g., Brasseur de Bourbourg 1869-70; Thomas 1882; Forstemann 1886, 1898, 1901, 1906; Fewkes 1894, 1895; Seler 1886, 1887b). The early work of Charles Brasseur de Bourbourg (1869-70) is substantially flawed, due to misconceptions concerning the nature and content of Maya writing. Nonetheless, Brasseur de Bourbourg made a number of valuable contri- butions, including the identification of the codical form of Chac, the god of rain and lightning. In these early works, the primary focus was less upon mythology than on the appearance of these gods in the codical almanacs. It was recognized that in the codices, the integration of gods with specific calendrical periods and cycles provides in- sights into the structural relationship of gods not only to calendrical events but also to cosmology, world directions, colors, and other gods. An ex- cellent example of this approach may be seen in the analysis by Cyrus Thomas (1882) of the Ma- drid and Dresden codices' new year pages. How- ever, much of the early success in delineating the structural relationships and identity of gods in the codices was due to the work of Ernst Forstemann (1886, 1906), head librarian of the Royal Public Library at Dresden. It was Forstemann who first solved the essential workings of ancient Maya calendrics. Although Forstemann initially focused upon the Codex Dresden, his work eventually encompassed the Madrid and Paris codices and Classic Maya monuments as well. Along with Forstemann, Eduard Seler clearly ranks as one of the most important scholars in the early era of Maya codical research. Seler pos- sessed a vast encyclopedic knowledge of not only Maya calendrics and belief but also of the com- plex religious lore and iconography of highland Mexico. Thus Seler can be considered as one of the first great Mesoamericanists, who was able to recognize shared cultural patterns over wide areas of Mexico and Central America. This remarkable breadth had direct bearing on the elucidation of</page><page sequence="13">Paris, Madrid, and Dresden codices. As in the previous work of 1886, Schellhas isolated and identified not only particular deities, but also their appellative glyphs. Some of Schellhas' original identifications and interpretations have proved to be incorrect, but the great bulk of his work re- mains widely accepted today. Rather than using specific Maya names, Schell- has adopted the noncommittal system of letter designation, in which each deity is labeled with a specific letter, beginning with A. This arbitrary system has proved to be of great value. For one, the label serves as a means of identification inde- pendent of the often poorly understood meaning and identity of a given deity. Moreover, many gods have not one but several names; an example is God A, known under such epithets as Yum Cimih, Cisin, or Uac Mitun Ahau in Yucatec. A great many of the codical deities also appear in the Classic period. It is unlikely that Yucatec was the dominant language of the Classic Maya low- lands, and thus the letter designations are usually more appropriate than Post-Classic or Colonial Yucatec terminology. The Schellhas system of deity classification was quickly adopted by other researchers, and appears in the early works of Seler (1904a), Forstemann (1906), and others. Fewkes (1894, 1895) was among the first to use the Schellhas system, de- scribing the identities of God B and God D. The Schellhas system of deity classification continues to be an essential element in the analysis of Maya deities. In ah important discussion of Maya gods, Gunter Zimmermann (1956) refers to the Schell- has system, but also proposes a distinct form of deity classification. However, Zimmermann's pro- posed system has not been widely adopted, and almost all recent studies of pre-Hispanic Maya gods cite the Schellhas letter system. J. Eric S. Thompson (1934, 1939, 1970a, 1970b, 1972) often refers to the Schellhas classification in his many discussions of Maya gods. In the tradition of Eduard Seler, Thompson frequently compares Maya gods to deities of highland Mexico. Like Thompson, Ferdinand Anders (1963), Da- vid Kelley (1965, 1972, 1976), and Michael Coe (1973, 1978, 1982) also make use of the Schellhas classificatory system, and frequently note parallels with iconographic conventions of highland Mex- ico. Das Pantheon der Maya by Anders (1963) is an ambitious study not only of Maya gods, but also of the nature of Maya religion. As in the case of the present study, Anders describes gods of both the Classic and Post-Classic Maya, as well as rele- vent data from the Colonial and contemporary periods. In his work Deciphering the Maya Script, Kelley (1976) devotes an entire chapter to ancient Maya gods and the Schellhas system. This useful analysis summarizes previous research of Maya divinities and provides emendations to Schellhas' letter classification. More recently, Linda Scheie and Mary Ellen Miller (1986) describe some of the current knowledge concerning major Classic Maya gods, many of which are referred to by the Schellhas system of letter classification. In the past two decades, there has been an ex- plosive growth in our understanding of ancient Maya religion. Much of the progress has been not with the Post-Classic codices, but with Classic Maya epigraphy and art. Because of our increased understanding of ancient Maya script, it is now possible to interpret accurately the scenes appear- ing on Classic Maya monuments. The work of Linda Scheie (e.g., 1974, 1^76, 1979, 1986) at Palenque is an example of the amount of detailed information now being gleaned from Classic Maya dynastic epigraphy and art. In addition to recent advances in epigraphic and iconographic research, a great deal of new material has come to light through scientific excavation and, unfortunately, looting. In her unpublished doctoral dissertation, Clemency Coggins (1975) analyzes the vast array of Classic epigraphy and art encountered during the University of Pennsylva- nia's excavations at Tikal. In 1973 a milestone of Classic Maya iconographic research was pub- lished: The Maya Scribe and His World by Michael D. Coe. In his analysis of a major corpus of un- provenanced Maya vessels, Coe (1973) calls atten- tion to the complexity and sophistication of Clas- sic Maya vessel scenes. An especially important contribution was the demonstration that a version of the Popol Vuh creation epic existed during the Classic era. Although Franz Blom (1950) had previ- 6</page><page sequence="14">ously noted the presence of Popol Vuh imagery on a Classic period plate, Coe was the first to note the extent of Popol Vuh characters and themes in Clas- sic Maya vessel iconography. In his studies, Coe (1973, 1975, 1977, 1978, 1982, 1989) describes in detail Classic analogues of Popol Vuh characters and the nature of the Maya underworld. In a recent publication, Nicholas Hellmuth (1987) elaborates upon a number of Coe's initial insights and, in addition, presents numerous new iconographic identifications and interpretations. In view of the many epigraphic and icono- graphic advances that recently have been made, it is clear that a fresh reappraisal of the Post-Classic codical gods and their Classic antecedents is now in order. The recognition of a Classic Popol Vuh epic has placed a very different light on ancient Maya mythology. For the first time, Classic Maya ideology and religion can be viewed and ordered in terms of sacred narrative. Many major Classic Maya gods have now been identified with Popol Vuh characters. Although a number of the comparisons may be unwarranted, it is becoming increasingly clear that the Popol Vuh creation epic is a useful means of interpreting and categorizing Classic Maya religion (see M. Coe 1989). Many of the deities now known to be part of the Classic Popol Vuh epic also appear in the Schellhas classifi- cation of Post-Classic codical deities. The Presence of Gods in Ancient Maya Religion In recent years there has been some debate con- cerning the fundamental nature of Classic Maya religion, namely, whether the Classic Maya actu- ally had a concept of specific gods or only the personification of natural forces. Essentially, the debate concerns whether Classic Maya religion was animistic - devoted to the worship of specific gods - or animatistic - based on the belief of a mana-like impersonal spiritual force residing in the surrounding material world. Tatiana Proskou- riakoff (1965, 1978, 1980) was skeptical of the presence of divinities in Classic Maya religion. In a discussion of zoomorphic "grotesques" in Clas- sic Maya art, Proskouriakoff (1965: 470-471) voices her doubts regarding specific Classic gods: the elements of which they [grotesques] are com- posed do not form stable associations but are recom- bined in such a protean manner that they cannot be conceived as describing definite entities. We are of necessity led to believe that they are not pictorial forms but compositions of ideograms, capable of ex- pressing very complex conceptions and differing from hieroglyphic writing only in their lack of serial arrangement and adherence to syntax. Joyce Marcus (1978: 180) also argues that the Clas- sic Maya lacked a deity complex: "I feel that we can challenge the notion that the Maya had a pan- theon of anthropomorphized gods during the Classic period (a.d. 250-950). Rather, supernatu- ral beings were depicted in Maya art by combin- ing parts from different animals (snake, iguana, crocodile, quetzal, parrot, jaguar, and so on) into fantastic creatures that would never have occurred in nature." In a similar line, Kubler (1969: 32) states that the series of Post-Classic codical gods identified by Schellhas does not appear in Classic Maya iconography: "In general the multiplicity of the deities in the manuscripts is lacking in Classic Maya iconography. There is no body of images of activities accompanied by suitable divine re- gents, and in place of the gods, we probably see images of spirits, whose attributes and characteris- tics vary according to place and period." According to Proskouriakoff (1978: 113; 1980: 9) and Porter (n.d.b), many of the grotesque or strange beings present in Classic Maya art are not gods but costumed performers personifying spe- cific forces of nature and abstract concepts. There are indeed many clear examples of impersonation in Classic Maya art. Thus it is frequently possible to distinguish masks, body suits, and other accou- terments of costume. However, it is an entirely different matter to interpret these scenes as imper- sonations of natural forces or concepts rather than gods. Thus deity impersonation is a widespread phenomena in ritual performances of Mesoamer- ica and the American Southwest. In the contempo- rary Pueblo dances of the American Southwest, the Kachina performers simultaneously represent forces of nature and sentient supernatural beings (E. Parsons 1939). In contrast to the Classic period, which ended 7</page><page sequence="15">more than 600 years before the Spanish Con- quest, Colonial sources are extremely relevant for the interpretation of Post-Classic Maya religion. The Colonial chroniclers make frequent reference to native gods, not only for the Maya region but for highland Mexico as well. According to those who advocate the absence of deities, however, these sources cannot be trusted, because the chroniclers were heavily biased by Classical or Judeo-Christian concepts of divinity (Marcus 1978; Proskouriakoff 1978, 1980). This is an a priori assumption, however, that is difficult to support or disprove. Although the early chroni- clers clearly had well-developed conceptions of divinity, there is no reason to assume that these were entirely incompatible with Mesoamerican be- lief. According to Fray Bernardino de Sahagun (see 1950-71, bk. 2), widely regarded as one of the first ethnographers of the New World, the Aztec did believe in specific gods. Sahagun was well versed in the subtleties of Aztec language and belief, and I find it difficult to dismiss his descriptions of Aztec gods as products of ethno- graphic bias or naivete. In a detailed discussion of Aztec conceptions of divinity and ritual impersonation, Arild Hvidt- feldt (1958: 140) states that, while the Aztec had a mana- like concept of sacredness, they also had gods, that is, "mythical figures with a life of their own." Hvidtfeldt (1958: 77-78) notes that the Nahuatl term teotl can refer both to god or divin- ity and the concept of sacredness. Similarly, the term ku or ch'u signifies deity or sacredness in Mayan languages. Recent advances in Classic epig- raphy demonstrate that this concept was present among the Classic Maya as well. In our discus- sion of God C, it will be noted that a particular Maya glyph, T1016, has the phonetic value ku or ch'u and can qualify the sacredness of certain ob- jects such as regalia, offerings, or temple struc- tures, or introduce particular deity names. In other words, it appears in Classic script that ku or ch'u can refer both to specific gods and to the general quality of sacredness. The argument that the Classic and perhaps even Post-Classic Maya lacked gods is a conserva- tive and now outmoded concept that arose during a time when Classic Maya religion was very poorly understood. In 1965, when Proskouriakoff published her description of Maya "grotesques," very few patterns were discerned in Classic Maya iconography. It is not surprising, therefore, that the iconography appeared "protean," with little clear meaning or form. In the following study, it will be noted that many of the Post-Classic fig- ures identified by Schellhas do appear in Classic Maya iconography, frequently with similar or identical name glyphs. The relative appearance or absence of gods in Maya iconography has much to do with the con- text and function of particular art forms. Both Proskouriakoff (1965, 1978, 1980) and Marcus (1978) focus their discussions on Classic Maya monuments rather than the elaborate narrative scenes appearing on Classic Maya vessels. Classic Maya monuments are primarily historical and po- litical in nature and clearly function to portray rulers in scenes of self-aggrandizement. Thus, rep- resentations of supernatural figures are frequently limited to costume and ornament or the cosmo- logical setting of the ruler. Such is not the case for the small and portable ceramic vessels, which of- ten display narrative scenes that can be related to the mythology of the Quichean Popol Vuh. In the present study, I will use the term god to refer to supernatural sentient beings that appear in sacred narrative. Aside from God C, who appears to be the embodiment of sacredness, I believe that this definition can apply to all of the entities that will be labeled as gods. Although I find the argument for a lack of gods among the Classic Maya untenable, it serves as a useful caveat. An uncritical use of such terms as god or deity can create a plethora of "gods," each distinguished by minute differences in appearance or context. There has, in fact, been an overuse of these terms. Animals in Classic Maya pottery scenes are frequently labeled as the Monkey God, Deer God, and so on, despite the fact there is little evidence these creatures are actually gods. In many instances anthropomorphized animals in Classic Maya art do not depict gods, but ritual clowns (Taube 1989b). But this is not the only significance of animal figures in Classic Maya iconography. In 8</page><page sequence="16">groundbreaking recent research, Stephen Houston and David Stuart (1989) note that many of the creatures appearing in Classic Maya vessel scenes portray supernatural co-essences of actual people, gods, and even polities. Houston and Stuart (1989) note the Classic Maya term for this co-essence was uay, a word referring to animal or spirit familiars in Colonial and contemporary Mayan languages. Because of the complexities involved in identify- ing animal figures as performers, spirit familiars, or gods, I will not consider these figures as distinct gods unless they are associated with a well-known mythic cycle. An example of such a creature would be the Principal Bird Deity, now known to be the Protoclassic and Classic period prototype of Vucub Caquix, the monster bird of the Popol Vuh. According to Proskouriakoff (1978: 113), Clas- sic Maya iconographic study should be less con- cerned with divinities than with social processes, such as sanctification of lineage and royal descent. Thus the study of Maya gods could be viewed as an epiphenomenal foray into a never-never world that has no basis in anthropological fact. How- ever, it should be stressed that, although divine, the gods should be viewed as models and meta- phors of the social and natural worlds. As such, they have everything to do with how the Maya interacted with themselves and their surrounding environment. For example, there are specific gods of subsistence, trade, and rulership. Moreover, through the study of Maya gods and mythology, it is possible to determine some of the underlying motivations of Maya social behavior. For exam- ple, Michael Coe (1989) argues that, like the Hindu Ramayana and Mahabharata, the Hero Twins saga of the Popol Vuh provided the divine charter for Classic Maya elite behavior. It is hoped that the present discussion of Maya gods will be used for interpreting not only ancient Maya religious belief but other aspects of Maya society as well. Ancient Maya Writing and Language The analysis of Maya iconography cannot be divorced from the hieroglyphic writing; both are inextricably combined, not only in terms of text and image but also in the fundamental nature of Maya epigraphy and iconography. Thus Maya writing is strongly pictographic and uses many motifs appearing in Maya art. However, it is now known that Maya writing is also phonetic and as such is linguistically bound to Mayan lan- guages (see Knorozov 1967; Justeson and Camp- bell 1984; Houston 1988). It is generally agreed that, whereas Yucatec was the language of the Dresden, Paris, and Madrid codices, the Classic Maya of the central and southern lowlands were primarily Cholan speakers (Campbell 1984). Due to the phonetic nature of the script, it is fre- quently possible to utter the Mayan names or epithets of particular gods. Moreover, the pres- ence of pictorial elements in the script can pro- vide important insights into iconographic conven- tions, since they are frequently labeled with known phonetic values. Although Cholan is especially important for de- ciphering Classic Maya script, Yucatec will be the most-cited language in this study. This is partly because the Paris, Madrid, and Dresden codices are written in Yucatecan - the language family currently comprising Yucatec, Lacandon, Itza, and Mopan. In addition, the majority of cited Colonial information pertains to Yucatec. In most recent studies of contemporary Yucatec, the lan- guage is transcribed phonetically. The most popu- lar system is that described by Rober Blair and Refugio Vermont-Salas (1965). However, until re- cently, Yucatec has been a written language with its own system of orthography based on the Latin alphabet. Because I will be relying heavily on Co- lonial documents, I will use an orthographic sys- tem based on that used for Colonial Yucatec. The system for consonants is as follows: Present study Blair and Vermont-Salas c k k k' t t tt t' z s X s b b p P 9</page><page sequence="17">Present study Blair and Vermont-Salas PP P' h h tz ts dz ts' ch c ch' c' m m n n 1 1 u w y y Proper names and widely known Colonial words, such as Katun, will be capitalized and retain the original Colonial orthography. Terms from other Mayan languages will not be altered but will keep the original orthography of the cited source. 10</page><page sequence="18">CHAPTER 2 The Schellhas God List Introduction The Schellhas (1897, 1904) god list focuses only upon the Post-Classic gods appearing in the few surviving pre-Hispanic screenfolds. At the time of Schellhas' pioneering investigations, this was a useful strategy: to isolate a series of gods by using a limited universe of highly similar scenes and texts. However, it is now possible to have a more comprehensive view based not only on the cod- ices but also on Post-Classic murals and sculpture and, in addition, Classic Maya epigraphy and art. In the following discussion of the major Post- Classic gods and their Classic antecedents, I will follow the letter designations proposed by Schell- has, although emendations and corrections to the Schellhas system will be noted frequently. Following the tradition of Schellhas, Seler, Thompson, Coe, and others, I believe that the Maya gods can be identified by specific visual attributes. These attributes can be corporeal, as costume, or as particular items held or associated with a given god. In the following discussion, I focus on attributes that I consider to be diagnostic of a particular god. The approach is similar to that adopted by Seler; that is, the Maya gods will be considered in the broader context of Meso- america. Thus, when relevant, particular gods and iconographic conventions of Veracruz or highland Mexico will be mentioned. When possi- ble, specific Maya gods will be traced back to Classic prototypes. This is not simply to docu- ment continuity but also to provide important insights into the identity and significance of par- ticular gods. Of course, the Schellhas system has its limita- tions, and it is by no means comprehensive of all Post-Classic Maya gods, much less those of the Classic period. Revisions and additions to the Schellhas system will be mentioned, among the more important of these corrections to be noted are the separation of God F into Gods Q and R, the name designations of Goddess O and Goddess I, and the addition of God A', God CH, and God S. After the discussion of Post-Classic codical gods, I review other Post-Classic deities of the northern Maya lowlands, in particular, those of Central Mexican origin. Gods A and A' The most readily discernable attribute of God A is his skeletal appearance, as he usually occurs with protruding ribs, rickety limbs, and a flesh- less grinning skull (Fig. 1). In both the Classic and Post-Classic periods, portrayals of this deity are studies in decay. Thus God A often has large black spots, which are probably putrification, and a large, grossly bloated belly. During the Classic period, his abdomen may be replaced with out- pouring swirls of blood or rotting matter (Fig. ig). A hairlike ruff with globular elements - aptly termed "death eyes" by Beyer (1937: 1 51-152) and others (e.g., J. Thompson 1950: 45; M. Coe 1973: 16) - frequently fringes his head, collar, and other elements of costume (Figs, if, g). Schellhas (1904: 11) identifies these devices as "globular bells or rattles." Many of the elements do resem- 1 1</page><page sequence="19">Fig. i God A in ancient Maya epigraphy and art.

Clearly, the Classic examples could not be metal, because metal bells were not common in the Maya region until the Post- Classic period. Circular elements almost identical to the Maya examples commonly appear in the hair of the Late Post-Classic Central Mexican death god, Mictlan- tecuhtli (Fig. ih). In this instance, the circular elements are clearly eyeballs. Thus, in the illus- trated example from Borgia page 15, the elements on the wrists, bracelets, and hair appear with a zone of red also found in the actual eye of the seated Mictlantecuhtli. Moreover, it can be seen that the eyes upon the front of the sandals are actually supplied with the red nerve stalk of the extruded eyeball. With the circular eyeballs, the hair of Mictlantecuhtli is virtually identical to the hair crest of God A and the "death collar" eyeball-and-ruff device commonly worn by Maya death gods (e.g., Figs, if, g; 2e, f). Although rarely depicted in scenes on Late Clas- sic stone monuments, God A commonly occurs in texts as the head variant of the number ten (Fig. ic). He also appears upon Late Classic poly- chrome vessels, frequently in execution scenes with the Classic Chac, eagerly awaiting the vic- tim with outstretched arms (Fig. 8b; see also Robicsek and Hales 1981: vessels 19-25, 27). The identification with sacrifice continues in the Post- Classic period. Thus in the Codex Madrid, God A is often found with God Q, a god of sacrifice. On Madrid page 76, Gods A and Q sit on either side of a sacrificial victim stretched over an altar. The Maya God A and Mictlantecuhtli of high- land Mexico are much alike in both form and function. Both are skeletal deities of death, the underworld, and sacrifice. In the Codex Borgia, Mictlantecuhtli usually wears a hafted sacrificial flint blade as a pectoral (Fig. ih). In a narrative scene on Borgia page 42, he greets a sacrificed victim. Thematically, this is quite similar to the Late Classic Maya vessel scenes in which God A receives a victim sacrificed upon a Cauac monster altar (e.g., Fig. 8b). In the Borgia scene, the vic- tim is first slain, then devoured by the caiman earth, only to meet Mictlantecuhtli seated on his netherworld throne. The Central Mexican god was known as a lord, or tecuhtli, and similarly, the Yucatec death god was referred to as Uac Mitun Ahau, ahau being the Yucatec title for lord or king (see Landa, in Tozzer 1941: 147). How- ever, this may have been a relatively recent bor- rowing from Central Mexico, since Mitun is sus- piciously similar to the Nahuatl Mictlan. On Dresden page 22c, God A twice appears with a glyphic compound composed of the T1048 skull sign followed by the T585a bi glyph (Fig. id). The skull glyph is marked with a series of dots around the eye. Stuart (1987b: 31) proposes that this skull sign is to be read xi. With this value, the two compounds on Dresden page 22c can be read xib(i). In Yucatec, the root xib has such connotations as "death" and "fright," clearly related to the Quichean term for the underworld, Xibalba. Thus, in the Colonial Yucatec dictionar- ies, xibalbail is glossed as "cosa infernal"; xibal- bayen, "cosa diabolica"; and xibib, "temor" (Barrera Vasquez 1980: 941). The compound on Dresden page 22c probably qualifies the death god as a frightful being. The use of the skull for the xi phonetic value may well derive from the common deathly and fearsome meanings of xib in Mayan languages. In Tzotzil, si' signifies "fright" (Laughlin 1975: 320). Although a repellent and frightful being, God A does not appear to have enjoyed an especially high status in the Maya pantheon. At times, his grotesque appearance is almost comical, and it seems that he was afforded little respect. In the codices, God A frequently has a ring of dots against his posterior (Fig. if). This is the phonetic mo sign first described by Floyd Lounsbury (1973). In contemporary Yucatec, a common term for sphincter is molo, and it is probable that the mo sign serves to delineate the anus, molo, of God A. In terms of his widespread association with filth and decomposition, it is not surprising that the sphincter is an important physical trait of God A. A common Colonial and contemporary Yucate- 13</page><page sequence="21">can name of the death god is Cizin, derived from the root ciz, meaning "flatulence. " Fox and Justeson (1984: 38-39) note that pages 85c and 87c of the Codex Madrid provide strong phonetic evidence that Cizin was a pre-Hispanic epithet for God A (Fig. ie). On Madrid page 87c, God A appears with three auguries oriented to the west, east, and north. Each text contains a directional glyph, a form of the God A appellative, a com- pound composed of T146. 102:1 16, and finally, the augury. The T146. 102:1 16 compound is com- posed of known phonetic values. Affix T146 is recognized to have the value zi; T102, the value ci; and T116, the value ni (see Justeson 1984: 323, 324, 326). The only ambiguity with this com- pound is the reading order. Because the T102 ci sign appears closest to the preceding compound, it is likely that this sign is to be read before the T146 affix. Given this reading order, Fox and Justeson (1984: 39) note that the entire compound is phonetically transparent as cizin(i), the name of the Yucatec death god. On Madrid page 85c, the suggested cizin appellative occurs once, here in association with a death deity displaying character- istics of God A and God Q. Michael Coe (1973: 15) notes that the pre- Hispanic God A may be compared with Cizin of the contemporary Lacandon. Rather than being the paramount lord of the underworld, the Lacan- don death deity has the subsidiary role of punish- ing the dead. Similarly, God A may have been the specific deity of corporal decomposition and the welfare of the deceased. Although not recognized by Schellhas, there is yet another important Post-Classic death god (Fig. 2). This deity occurs in the Paris (page 22), Madrid (pages 19b, 64c, 72b, 74b), and Dresden codices (pages 5b, 6a, 28b), as well as in Classic Maya inscriptions and art. Zimmermann (1956: 162-163; pl. 6) was the first to isolate this god in the Codex Dresden, and Thompson (1972: 38) subsequently noted his name glyph in Classic epigraphy (T1042). Noting that this entity was distinct from God A, Zimmermann (1956: 162- 163) termed this god A', or alternatively, Gla. The face of God A' is characterized by a division sign on his cheek and a blackened region around his eye, usually a broad vertical band. Often above this band is a pair of Akbal eyes, a sign of darkness (Figs. 2a, d-h). Quite frequently a large bone, presumably a human femur, is placed in the hair. Usually supplied with some sort of lashing in midsection, this bone appears with God A' from the Early Classic to the Late Post-Classic (Figs. 2e-f, h). The name glyph of God A' is usually a portrait glyph of the god, although in the Codex Dresden a jawless head (Ti038a) also occurs as the God A' appellative (Fig. 2b). During both the Classic and Post-Classic periods, the God A' portrait glyph may be accompanied by a T23 na sign (Figs. 2c, d, g). Although clearly a physically distinct deity, God A' does share roles with the skeletal death god, God A. Thus on the Codex Dresden new year pages 27 and 28, God A' alternates with God A. Michael Coe (1982: 111) notes that God A' is frequently shown in the act of self-decapitation in Classic Maya vessel scenes, and he is clearly a sinister figure of violent death and sacrifice. During the Late Classic period, God A' seems to have been impersonated during ritual perfor- mances. Some of the finest renderings of this be- ing appear to be actual people in the guise of God A'. One example appears on a fragmentary Late Classic polychrome vessel (Fig. 3a). Covered with abundant death signs, the figure has a face painted in the characteristic zones of white and black and also wears the large femur through his headdress. He is flanked by two women in obvi- ous positions of dance and holds a rattle, an excel- lent indicator of ritual or theatrical performances in Classic Maya art (Taube 1989b). A similar figure occurs on the renowned Altar de Sacrificios Vase, which also depicts explicitly dancing figures. The vessel scene depicts individu- als impersonating supernaturals, and it is readily apparent that they are wearing costumes with headdresses, leggings, mitts, and the like. One of the seated figures bears the facial markings of God A', complete with the white face, a black band through the eyes, and a division sign on the cheek (Fig. 3b). The figure grasps flint weapons in both hands, both a sacrificial blade and an axe. The axe arm is upraised as if the figure has com- 14</page><page sequence="22">Fig. 2 Classic and Post-Classic examples of God A'.

Both of these gods have obvious Classic antecedents. God A is invariably skeletal, with a prominent fleshless skull. He frequently appears with a hair ruff dotted with disembodied eyeballs; this element can appear both as a hair crest and as a collar worn around the neck. In both the Classic and Post-Classic periods, God A frequently appears with elements suggestive of pu- trescence and filth, and, in the codices, he often occurs with a prominent and exaggerated anus. Closely identified with human sacrifice, God A appears to be the preeminent god of death presid- (b) God A' impersonator engaged in mock self- execution; note knotted collar with hanging, bloodied paper pennants, detail of Altar de Sacrificios Vase (drawn after G. Stuart 1975: 774). mitted self-decapitation - a characteristic of God A'. In seeming confirmation of this act, streams of blood radiate from the neck. However, on close inspection it is clear that these "streams" are actually bloodied paper strips hanging upon a col- lar or ruff of pendant hair or other material ren- dered in fugitive gray. The small knot tying this unpleasant device can be seen on the upper chest. It is likely that with the bloodied ruff and the weapons, the figure is dressed as God A' in the act of self-decapitation. Both of these Late Classic vessel scenes appear to be performances portray- ing God A' and netherworld demons, perhaps analogous to the Late Post-Classic Yucatec xibalba okot, "dance of the devil," mentioned by Landa (Tozzer 1941: 147).

At times, his name glyph may also be prefixed by a yax sign standing for green and the middle place, suggesting that there was a fifth principal Chac at the center. The conventional glyph of God B (T668) is a profile face with a Tau- shaped ik sign serving as the eye (Fig. 4a). This curious glyph has a small notch at the back of the head, creating the impression of a thumb protruding from a clenched fist. Although less common, the actual portrait head of God B occurs in free variation with the Ik-eye appellative (Fig. 4b). Both ver- sions tend to be postfixed with the T102 ci sign, probably to provide the final consonant of chac(i). The T668:i02 chac compound is not limited to the Post-Classic period. Jeff Kowalski (1985) notes its presence at Terminal Classic Uxmal and Chichen Itza (Figs. 4e-f). David Stuart (cited in L. Scheie and M. E. Miller 1986: 49, note 55) has recently identified the appellative phrase chac xib chac on a Late Classic dish (Fig. 4c). A name spe- cifically mentioned by Landa and the Colonial Yucatec Chilam Balam books (Tozzer 1941: 138, note 642), it is also present on Dresden page 30c. A similar phrase appears on another Late Classic vessel, in this case a cylindrical vase depicting an anthropomorphized Chac figure (Fig. 4d). Here the individual is named chac xib, with the final sign being the youthful xib head found also on the aforementioned dish. In both cases, the xib face has a prominent spot upon the cheek. Although this is a diagnostic attribute of the personified day sign Ahau, cheek spots are also found with Co- dex Dresden examples of xib glyphs (e.g., Dresden pages 29c, 30b, 30c). Although the codex style dish labels the Classic entity as Chac Xib Chac, he is rarely referred to as Chac Xib Chac in the Classic script. It is thus unwarranted to call all images of the Classic deity as Chac Xib Chac. A more appropriate term for the entity would be the "Classic Chac," the name of the Post-Classic Yucatec counterpart supplied with a temporal qualifier. During the Classic pe- riod, the Chac appellative is usually not portrayed with the Ik-eye glyph typical of the Post-Classic codices. Instead, the portrait version is far more common (Figs. 4I1, 6e). 17 ing over the afterlife of the unfortunate deceased. God A is very similar to Mictlantecuhtli of Post- Classic Central Mexico, and in view of a number of specific shared traits, it is clear that they are historically related entities. It is quite possible that certain traits found with Mictlantecuhtli, includ- ing the death eye and hair ruff, ultimately derive from the Classic Maya. In contrast to God A, God A' has no obvious analogues in the Gulf Coast or highland Mexico. The most striking characteristic of this death god is the black horizontal band across the eyes, which contrasts sharply with the blanched white- ness of the rest of his face. God A' seems to be primarily a god of violent sacrifice and is identi- fied closely with the act of self-decapitation. Dur- ing the Late Classic period, God A' seems to be a popular character in ritual performances illustrat- ing gods and demons of the netherworld. God B One of the most important deities of the an- cient and contemporary Maya, God B permeates Post-Classic Yucatec ritual and cosmology. Be- cause of the frequent association of this deity with serpents, Schellhas (1904: 17-18) considers God B as the Maya version of Quetzalcoatl and noted that Fewkes, Forstemann, Thomas, and Die- seldorff had reached similar conclusions. How- ever, Schellhas also mentions that Brasseur de Bourbourg (1869-70: 117) and Seler (1886) inter- pret God B as Chac. There is now overwhelming evidence that this god is indeed Chac, the god of rain and lightning. It is now known that Chac and many of his associations are extremely old and may be traced back even to the beginnings of Classic Maya religion. During the Post-Classic period, God B is char- acterized by his long pendulous nose (Figs. 4b, 6a). Schellhas (1904: 16) notes that he is the most commonly represented deity in the codices and appears in a wide variety of activities. God B is often found wielding axes or serpents, both of which are widespread symbols of lightning in an- cient and contemporary Mesoamerica. A quadri- partite god, he is frequently oriented to the four</page><page sequence="25">Fig. 4 Classic and Post-Classic examples of Chac ap- pellative phrases.

Al- though the broad headdress is largely limited to Terminal Classic and Early Post-Classic mural paintings and sculpture, the curious paper or cloth cap occasionally worn by Chac in the Co- dex Dresden may well derive from this device (see Dresden pages 31a, 31b, 33a). Like many of the cited examples, the Dresden cap is crenelated and topped with one or more horizontal bow knots. A great many Classic and Early Post-Classic Chac figures have snakes held or dangling from their mouths (Figs. 5a, 5c-d, 6c-e, 8a). One ex- ample, from the Lower Temple of the Jaguars at Chichen Itza, bites the snake in midsection, with the head and tail hanging from the front and side of the face (Fig. 5d). In placement, this is quite similar to the two devices frequently curling out of the mouths of the Dresden Chacs (Fig. 6a). Although the mouth elements depicted in the Co- dex Dresden may no longer represent serpents, Chac is frequently depicted with snakes in the Dresden and Madrid codices (Fig. 6a). Fewkes (1894: 266) long ago suggested that snakes appear- ing with God B may represent lightning. How- ever, due to an admitted lack of supportive evi- dence, Fewkes preferred to consider the snake as a generalized symbol of moisture, thus siding with the Kukulcan identification of God B proposed by Schellhas. In his tentative identification of Maya serpents with lightning, Fewkes relied principally upon ethnographic data of the American Southwest. However, there is widespread evidence that snakes are widely identified with lightning in the Maya region both in the pre-Hispanic era and the ethnographic present. Citing Lenkersdorf (1979) and Montejo (1984), Joanne Spero (1987: 172) states that among the contemporary Jacaltec and Tojolabal Maya, lightning is considered as a fire serpent. Similarly, the serpents appearing with the Classic Chac frequently have a pair of smoke or flame volutes emerging from their mouths (Figs. 5c, 6d-e). Although these volutes may at times resemble serpent tongues, they are identical to the fiery volutes emerging from the forehead of God K (Figs. 32a-b, 34a, 37a). This is an icono- 19 Kowalski (1985: note 15) mentions two in- stances in which an individual glyphically named Chac appears with a large broad-brimmed head- dress. The cited examples are Uxmal Stela 14 and a figure from Structure 6E1, Chichen Itza (Figs. 4e-f). In both cases, the Chac appellative is com- posed of the codical Ik-eye version supplied with the ci complement. Dating to approximately the ninth or tenth centuries a.d., these two examples are important transitional forms between the Clas- sic and Post-Classic forms of Chac. The Chichen Itza appellative is preceded by two other com- pounds constituting part of the same name phrase. The initial compound is composed of the yax sign for green superfixed to a T126 ya sign, clearly indicating that the first compound is to be read yax. The second compound is more unusual and is formed of a curious three-pointed main sign followed by a possible inverted Ahau, provid- ing the phonetic value la, and possibly al. The same three-pointed glyph also appears in Termi- nal Classic Cotzumalhualpa epigraphy, here fre- quently with a coefficient of six (see Parsons 1969, 2: pls. 38a, 4ia-b, 52d, 54b, 59a). In the basal relief of the Lower Temple of the Jaguars at Chichen, it can be seen that this sign represents a water lily flower and is thus equivalent to the T501 sign for the day Imix (Fig. 4g). The Chichen phrase appears to be a variant of a com- mon Late Classic Chac appellative composed of a yax prefix followed by T501 and ending with the zoomorphic Chac sign (Fig. 4I1). David Stuart (personal communication, 1986) notes that the T501 water lily sign can have the phonetic value of ha, a Mayan term for water. The "Yax-Imix- Chac" phrase appearing at Chichen Itza and in Late Classic Maya epigraphy is probably to be read yaxha chac, or, yax(h)al chac. The broad headdress appearing with the epi- graphically named Terminal Classic Chac figures at Uxmal and Chichen Itza is a specific attribute of Chac in the northern Maya lowlands. On Itzimte Stela 12, there is a winged figure with the broad headdress, and in the accompanying text he is named Chac (Fig. 5b). Aside from appearing at Chichen Itza, Uxmal, and Itzimte, this headdress is also present on Oxkintok Stela 12 and in the</page><page sequence="27">Fig. 5 Terminal Classic and Early Post-Classic repre- sentations of Chac with broad headdress.

In Central Mexican codices, Tlaloc is frequently found with lightning serpents (e.g., Borgia pages 27, 28; Vaticanus B pages 43-48). Esther Pasztory (1974: 7) mentions that the identification of Tlaloc with lightning serpents was also present at Classic Teotihuacan. Seler (1963, 2: 34) and others (e.g., Anders 1963: 141; Bernal 1965: 2), have noted that the Central Mexican Xiuhcoatl fire serpent can refer to lightning as well as fire. As with Tlaloc of Central Mexico, the axe was and continues to be another lightning symbol of Chac (see J. Thompson 1970b: 253). In the Codex Dresden, God B may be found wielding both serpents and axes (e.g., Fig. 6a). At times, the flaming serpent and the Chac lightning axe are conflated into a single object (Figs. 5c, 6b, 35a). In the following discussion of God K, it will be seen that this composite object is actually the manikin scepter commonly wielded by Classic Maya rulers. The Classic and Post-Classic identification of Chac with lightning is entirely consistent with lightning terminology appearing in Colonial and contemporary Mayan languages. A common con- temporary Yucatec statement for lightning is tun lelem chaac, or "Chac is flashing" (Taube 1983 fieldnotes). In the seventeenth-century Moran dic- tionary of Manche Choi, uleem chahac is glossed as "resplandor de rayo." J. Eric S. Thompson (1970b: 251) notes that among the contemporary Choi in the region of Palenque, Chac is identical to lightning. Thus in contemporary Choi, xojob chajc is the term for the flash of lightning (Aulie and Aulie 1978: 176). In the sixteenth-century de Ara dictionary of Tzeltal, chahuc is translated as "rayo o trueno" (Humberto Ruz 1986: 265). Simi- larly, in Tzotzil, thunder and lightning are re- ferred to as cauk (Laughlin 1975: 463). Michael Coe (1978: 76) is the first to provide a detailed argument that one long-snouted Classic entity, frequently appearing with a long top-knot and a spondylus shell earpiece, is an ancestral form of the Post-Classic Yucatec Chac. Although Coe suggested that the Classic deity was a prototype of the Post-Classic god, he proposed the more non- committal term of Rain Beast. Due to the chac-xib- chac reading, David Stuart has established that this Classic deity was actually named Chac. Possibly by the beginnings of the Early Classic period, the Classic entity was phonetically known as chac. Stuart (1987a) has pointed out an interest- ing allograph of the T109 chac sign, an inverted bone jaw crossed with a series of parallel lines. In his study, Stuart is primarily concerned with his- torical names appearing in hieroglyphic texts. However, this jaw device also occurs in Early Classic iconography. It appears as part of the back belt assemblage worn by an especially early repre- sentation of Chac (Fig. 35a). Directly below the inverted jaw chac sign there is a peccary head marked with a trefoil element in the eye. A simi- lar Early Classic peccary - again with the trefoil eye element - may be seen on Tikal Stela 26. In both Yucatec and Cakchiquel, ak (ac) is the term for peccary (Barrera Vasquez 1980: 4; Coto 1983: 446, lxxxiv) . Similarly, aq in Quiche refers to "pig" (Edmonson 1965: 1). The Kekchi term for peccary is chacou or chacuo (Sedat 1955: 227). As either chac or more probably ac, the Early Classic peccary head serves as a phonetic complement to reinforce the chac reading. Together, the inverted bone jaw and peccary head beltpiece form the name of Chac, the god of rain and lightning. Chac is one of the oldest known gods in the Maya pantheon and can be traced back to the beginnings of Classic Maya civilization. Rafael Girard (1966: 40) notes that Chac is prominently displayed in Izapa Stela 1, a monument dating to the Late Preclassic period (ca. 100 b.c.-a.d. 100). The figure appears with a thick, downward curv- ing snout and a large top knot of hair, features commonly found with later Classic examples of Chac (Fig. 7a). In addition, he wears a serpent belt. Although not a common feature, serpent belts are also worn by Classic Chacs (see Taube 1986: fig. 4). Some sort of fluid spews in a broad fan out of the mouth of the Stela 1 Chac. In Late Classic vessel scenes, Chac can also be found spewing liquid, or vomiting (e.g., Fig. 37e). In a modern Yucatec ch'a chaac rain ceremony re- corded by John Sosa (1985: 386), falling rain is metaphorically described as vomit. Izapa Stela 1 22</page><page sequence="30">Fig. 7 Late Preclassic and Protoclassic representations of Chac. (a) Chac engaged in fishing, note serpent belt, Izapa Stela i (drawn after Norman 1973: pls. 1, 2) (b) Chac with lightning axe on flint blade tail of fire serpent, detail of Protoclassic Hauberg Stela (re- drawn after L. Scheie and M. E. Miller 1986: pl. 66). suggests that as early as the Late Preclassic era, falling rain may have been considered as the vomit of Chac. Linda Scheie and Mary Ellen Miller (1986: 191) note another early instance of Chac, here upon the Protoclassic Hauberg Stela, dating to approxi- mately the second or third century a.d. (Fig. 7b). This example also possesses the zoomorphic snout and large top knot and, in addition, wears a pointed headpiece, evidently an early form of the shell element cresting the head of the Classic Chac. He also has a beardlike device bracketing the cheek and chin, and it is probable that this is an antecedent of the long, fishlike barbel curling down the cheek of the Classic Chac. The Hauberg Chac wields an axe, an especially impor- tant attribute because it reveals that by the Protoclassic period, the stone axe was the light- ning weapon of Chac. Although possessing a long anthropomorphic nose rather than a thick zoomorphic snout, the codical God B shares many characteristics with the Classic Chac. Michael Coe (1978) notes that along with being quadripartite, both are identified with fishing. In the Codex Dresden, God B may be found fishing or grasping fish (see Dresden pages 44a, 44c). Coe compares the fishing Chac on Izapa Stela 1 to the Late Classic fishing scenes found upon certain of the incised bones of Tikal Burial 116. A contemporary Tzeltal belief pro- vides a rationale for the identification of Chac with fishing. In the town of Quaquitepec, San Angel is the god of fishing as well as lightning. The reason for this association is based on actual 23</page><page sequence="31">observation; when the thunderbolt strikes water, one only has to gather the dead and stunned fish (Maurer-Avalos 1979: 223). Both the Classic and Post-Classic Chacs are closely identified with war. The lightning axe wielded by these figures is frequently portrayed as a battle weapon. Thus, in the Classic and Post- Classic periods, a shield often accompanies the lightning axe (see mural of South Wall, Mulchic; Dresden pages 65a, 66a, 37c; Madrid page 33a). In the battle scene of Bonampak Lintel 3, the vic- torious ruler wears the Classic Chac in his head- dress (see Mathews 1980: fig. 7). Stela 14 of Uxmal is one of the most graphic representations of Chac as conqueror (Fig. 4e). Here Lord Chac is portrayed as his deity namesake, wearing the broad headdress and grasping an axe and conch, the latter a probable instrument of thunder. Be- low him are three supine and slain captives un- doubtedly taken in conquest. Sacrifice, frequently the result of war, is yet another trait shared between the Classic and Post- Classic forms of Chac. In a number of Late Clas- sic vessel scenes, the Classic Chac sacrifices a jag- uar infant upon a Cauac zoomorph altar (Fig. 8b). Although Lounsbury (1985) and others have inter- preted this as the Popol Vuh sacrifice of Xba- lanque by Hunahpu, the scene actually refers to the role of Chac as executioner. A similar scene is found in the mural painting at Mulchic, where a procession of Chac figures flank Cauac altars (Fig. 8a). A smoking figure, possibly an insect, tops the Mulchic altar, and this figure is probably a version of the smoking insect found in a num- ber of the vessel scenes (e.g., Fig. 8b). However, although the Mulchic scenes depict Chac, the smoking insect, and the Cauac altar, there is no reference to the jaguar infant - an integral part of the Popol Vuh interpretation. A series of Chacs brandishing axes also ap- pears on the circumference of Labna Altar 1 (see Proskouriakoff 1950: fig. 93 e). It is likely that these low cylindrical columns, found widely in the Puuc region, served as sacrificial altars. As such, they are probably the actual corollaries of the Cauac zoomorph altars appearing in Late Classic scenes. The identification of Chac with sacrifice was widespread in Post-Classic times, and it will be recalled that the assistants of hu- man sacrifices were called Chacs (Landa, in Tozzer 1941: 119). According to Landa (Tozzer 1 941: 11 2- 113), the principal executioner was the Nacom. J. Eric S. Thompson (1938: 596) notes the similarity of this term to Macon, the Manche Choi god of lightning. One major question that remains is the relation between the Classic Chac and GI of the Palenque Triad. Although first identified in the texts of Palenque by Heinrich Berlin (1963), GI is widely represented in both Early and Late Classic Maya epigraphy and art. Many of the features described by M. Coe for the Rain Beast are also found with GI, to such a degree that one could consider them as aspects of the same deity. In terms of physical attributes, each may have fish barbels upon the cheek. For the zoomorphic and anthropomorphic Chac figures, these elements tend to be long, like the "whiskers" of catfish (Figs. 7a, 8b). For GI, the barbels tend to be short, broad, and generally finlike (Fig. 9a). Along with similar cheek ele- ments, both gods frequently wear a knotted belt device (e.g., Fig. 8b). When GI appears on Clas- sic polychrome vessels, he is found in contexts similar to that of Chac. Thus in one vessel scene he is portrayed fishing (see M. Coe 1978: vase 12). Another vessel portrays GI seated in a swirl of smoke and flames holding an eccentric flint, possibly an allusion to lightning (see M. Coe 1975: 14). Thus, although the actual mythical role of GI is still poorly understood, this entity does share both physical and thematic traits with the Classic Chac. Several Late Preclassic masks suggest that GI is also identified with rain and lightning and indi- cate that GI and Cocijo, the Zapotec god of light- ning, derive from a single source. A stone mask attributed to Late Preclassic Veracruz displays at- tributes of both Cocijo and GI (Fig. 9b). Thus the mask possesses the brow piece of Cocijo - Zapotec Glyph C - along with the barbel cheek markings of GI. In fact, many of the early Monte Alban II depictions of Cocijo exhibit GI barbels (Fig. 9c). An Early Classic greenstone mask attrib- uted to the Peten site of Rio Azul seems to reveal 24</page><page sequence="32">Fig. 8 Chac as sacrificer.

In truth, the slightly anthropomorphic face of God C does not closely resemble any living creature. Moreover, his char- acteristics do not belie a close relation to any ani- mal or quality of the natural world. It has long been suggested that God C is the deity of the North Star (Schellhas 1904; Morley, Brainerd, and Sharer 1983: 475), but this identification is unwarranted. The primary evidence for an associa- tion with the North Star is the reputed presence of the God C glyph in the sign for north. How- ever, in the Codex Dresden, the most carefully painted of the Maya manuscripts, the God C glyph never serves as the main sign for north. Although possessing the same forehead bracket, the head in the compound for north lacks the small round nose and mouth of God C, which resemble two stacked balls. Schellhas (1904: 21) notes that on Dresden pages 29c to 30c the same head serving for north is associated with all four directions. This sign (T1008) has the phonetic value xib (see Justeson 1984: 360). In the Dresden text, it forms part of the appellatives zac-xib-chac, ek-xib-chac, kan-xib-chac, and chac-xib-chac, these being specific names provided by Landa (Tozzer 1941: note 638). Epigraphically, God C can be traced back as early as the Protoclassic period, that is, to the second and third centuries a.d. Although William Ringle (1988: fig. 2) mentions a possible Late Preclassic epigraphic example of God C on Kaminaljuyu Stela 10, James Porter (personal communication, 1988) notes that the drawing on which this interpretation is based is inaccurate. According to Porter, who has made a rubbing of the monument, the actual glyph does not repre- sent God C or any other deity portrait, but rather is an abstract sign. Clear examples of God C por- trait glyphs appear on the Protoclassic Hauberg Stela and on a roughly contemporaneous bone awl from Kichpanha, Belize (Figs. na-b). Al- though earlier, these examples are quite similar to glyphs of God C appearing on the Early Classic Tikal Stela 31 (Fig. 11c). Although the earliest epigraphic forms of God 27 an interesting stage in the divergent evolution of the Maya and Zapotec gods (Fig. 9a). Here the brow is marked not with the bowl-like form of Zapotec Glyph C, but the Maya Quadripartite Badge, three elements placed in a kin- marked bowl. In view of the many similarities shared be- tween the Rio Azul and Veracruz masks, it is possible that the Quadripartite Badge and the Zapotec Glyph C derive from a single Late Forma- tive iconographic element. Summary One of the oldest known gods in the Maya pantheon, God B can be traced in the Maya re- gion to at least the Late Preclassic period. Repre- sentations of this deity are extremely common in Classic Maya iconography. Accompanying Clas- sic epigraphy provides conclusive evidence that the Classic being was known phonetically as Chac, the same name found with the Post-Classic and contemporary Maya god. From the Late Preclassic and Protoclassic to the ethnographic present, Chac has been considered as a lightning god. Among the most common emblems of his lightning powers are serpents and hafted stone axes. Consonant with his association with one of the most violent and powerful forces in nature, Chac was closely identified with war and human sacrifice. God C Writing more than eighty years ago, Schellhas (1904: 19, 20) notes that God C is among the least understood deities appearing in the Maya codices: This is one of the most remarkable and difficult fig- ures in the Maya manuscripts, and shows, at the same time, how imperfect must be the information we have received in regard to the Maya mythology, since from the frequency of his representations he is obviously one of the most important deities and yet can be identified with none of the representations of gods handed down to us. Despite the ensuing years, this account still holds true today. Even the physical appearance of God C defies clear identification (Fig. 10).

Several examples can be ob- served on Kaminaljuyu Altars 9 and 10, which present nearly identical images of the Principal Bird Deity, the Late Preclassic and Classic proto- type of Vucub Caquix, the monster bird of the Popol Vuh (Figs. nd-f). The faces appear on the chest of the bird, and in a cartouche on the more intact Altar 9. Supplied with four tab-like ele- ments, the device is notably similar to the Akbal medallion worn on the brow of the Principal Bird Deity occurring on Altar 10. In the discussion of God D, it will be seen that the Akbal medallion represents a mirror, and it is likely that the Kaminaljuyu cartouche is also a mirror. During the Classic period, God C faces are fre- quently placed on the bodies of supernaturals; they are especially common on the back of the Uinal Toad, the patron of the period of twenty days (Fig. nh). Stela 11 of Late Preclassic Izapa displays an especially early example of this con- vention (Fig. ng). Here a God C face appears on the back of a squatting toad. During the Late Preclassic and Classic periods, God C seems to function more as a condensed symbolic sign than a deity with his own person- ality and mythic cycle. Representations are al- most entirely limited to the face, and Classic de- pictions of God C with a body are extremely rare. Thus, although God C may appear in Late Classic vessel scenes, he is usually attached to a tree or other object. In GI of the Supplementary Series, God C appears as a water group com- pound held in a hand prefixed by the coefficient of nine. In both Classic inscriptions and the Post-Classic codices, God C is an important com- ponent of the water group (Figs, ioa-b). A num- ber of scholars have identified the water group as a sign for blood (Seler 1902-23, 3: 649; Barthel 1968: 168; Stuart 1984). As an entity iden- tified with such varied items as maize offerings, growing trees, stone blades, mirrors, and blood, God C seems to represent an abstract quality or concept, such as preciousness, life, or divinity. There is a strong possibility that God C repre- sents godliness or divinity. In Classic and Post- Classic epigraphy, the God C water group often precedes the name of particular gods. On the Vase of the Seven Gods, this compound intro- duces the appellative of each of the seven deities (M. Coe 1973: no. 49). This pattern also occurs commonly in the Codex Madrid (e.g., Madrid pages 83b-84b, 105a). Thomas Barthel (1952: 94) originally suggested that T1016, the epigraphic form of God C, possesses the phonetic value of ku or ch'u, terms signifying god or sacredness in Yucatec and Cholan Mayan languages, respec- tively. This reading was based on the gloss pro- vided by Landa for the month Cumku, in which the month sign is preceded by a complementary phonetic compound composed of T528 and T1016. Together, the glyphs may be read cuku, a close gloss for Cumku. With this reading, the T1016 God C sign corresponds to the phonetic value ku, the Yucatec term for god. John Carlson (personal communication, 1987) and David Stuart (cited in Ringle 1988) have independently arrived at similar conclusions regarding Landa's gloss of the month Cumku, and there is growing consen- sus among epigraphers that T1016 has the value of ku or ch'u , with God C referring to sacredness or divinity. The most thorough published discus- sion of this argument is to be found in Ringle (1988). The use of God C as a generalized concept of divinity may explain the presence of this figure on many disparate objects. For example, Stephen Houston (personal communication, 1982) notes that the bowl-like object held by the aged god- dess on Dresden page 42a is a mirror (Fig. 52a). In the center of the device, corresponding to the face of the mirror, there is the face of God C. The presence of God C may serve to mark the concept of sacredness, in this case labeling the mirror as an instrument of divination. A more compelling case occurs on Dresden pages 8c and 35a, where diminutive God C figures appear in temple struc- tures. Because God C is not mentioned in either of the accompanying texts, it does not appear that he had a central role in the scenes; rather, he may serve to complement the particular structure de- picted. In Yucatec, the common word for temple is ku (Barrera Vasquez 1980: 416). 30</page><page sequence="38">fix (T152) of the Classic and Post-Classic God D appellative (Figs. I2g-h). One of the earliest ex- amples of the forehead element appears in a possi- ble portrait glyph of God D on the Protoclassic Hauberg Stela, although in this case the tasseled device lacks the Akbal infix (Fig. I2e). An Early Classic example of the device appears on Tikal Stela 26, there worn by a figure holding a proba- ble hoofed peccary (Fig. I2d). Although the face of the figure resembles God C as well as God D, the squint eye and the tasseled Akbal device both point to God D. The peccary probably also refers to God D, since Itzamna appears with the crea- ture in other Classic scenes (Fig. I2g; see L. Scheie and M. E. Miller 1986: 55; Hellmuth 1987: 235). In Classic epigraphy, the T152 Akbal device occurs with personal names, such as Ruler 2 of Dos Pilas, and Shield Jaguar of Yaxchilan (Figs. i3a-b). In the case of Shield Jaguar, this element is generally interpreted as a shield. However, the tasseled Akbal is almost identical to T151, which has been interpreted as a belt ornament (see Justeson 1984: 151). The center of T151 contains the nen mirror sign, and clearly this affix repre- sents a Maya version of the Central Mexican tezcacuitlapilli - back mirrors attached at the belt. Save for the beaded edge and the Akbal center, T152 is identical to T151, and it is likely that this sign also represents a mirror. The beaded or seg- mented edge is frequently found on Classic Cen- tral Mexican mirrors (see Berjonneau et al. 1985: pl. 172). On La Pasadita Lintel 2, Bird Jaguar wears a belt piece composed of a human head with a jag- uar headdress. The beaded medallion appears on the jaguar forehead; in this case, it is the nen mir- ror, here emanating some sort of vegetal smoke (Fig. 13c). Linda Scheie and Mary Ellen Miller (1986: pl. 76) equate the medallion with the Akbal "shield" and suggest that the belt assemblage rep- resents Shield Jaguar. The Akbal sign is also worn as a back mirror. An Early Classic shell carving depicts the Akbal device worn at the small of the back, precisely where tezcacuitlapilli are placed (Fig. 13d). Bird Jaguar wears an almost identical device on Yaxchilan Lintel 17, although there the 3i Summary Rather than being a specific deity with its own mythic cycle, God C appears to embody the an- cient Maya concept of godliness. Beginning as early as the Late Preclassic period, he is commonly found as a profile face on inanimate objects and the bodies of supernaturals. During the Classic and Post-Classic periods, there is phonetic evidence that the epigraphic form of God C, T1016, has the phonetic value of ku or ch'u, Mayan terms for sa- credness. Although full-figure forms of God C are relatively common during the Post-Classic period, they do not appear in narrative contexts. Instead, the god frequently presents or receives offerings or appears with temples and other toponyms. In many of these Post-Classic instances, he may func- tion either to express a generalized concept of god- liness or to qualify the sacredness of an offering, structure, or place. GodD God D is one of the most important and perhaps the major god of the Classic and Post-Classic Maya pantheon (Fig. 12). Schellhas (1904: 22-23) points out two important attributes of this deity; he is invariably aged and often possesses the T24. 533:24 Ahau title of rulership. Although a number of early investigators correctly identify the codical God D as Itzamna (e.g., Seler 1887b; Fewkes 1895), Schellhas considers him a god of the moon and night. The moon interpretation was partly based on the conventional name glyph of God D, an aged face prefixed by a device containing the Akbal sign, a symbol of blackness and night (Figs. I2a-b). However, it is probable that this serves as a phonetic device providing the value itz, the first portion of the Itzamna appellative. Although Michael Coe (1978: 46) originally iso- lated the identifying attributes of God D on Clas- sic Maya ceramics, Nicholas Hellmuth (see 1987: 303-312) was the first to recognize this entity as the Classic form of God D. Like the Post-Classic codical representations, the Classic period deity usually has a tasseled Akbal device upon the brow, the same form occurring as the Akbal pre-</page><page sequence="39">Fig. 12 Classic and Post-Classic representations of GodD.

Akbal sign is replaced by crosshatching, another means of representing black or darkness (Fig. i3e). Scheie (L. Scheie and J. Miller 1983: 14) suggests that the nen and Akbal signs seem to be in complementary opposition in reference to mir- rors, the former representing a bright shining mir- ror and the latter, a "dark or obsidian mirror." The Akbal medallion (T512) of God D represents an obsidian mirror, a device used for divinatory scrying. In ancient Mesoamerica, stone mirrors of py- rite, obsidian, hematite, and other materials were widely used in scrying. The term itz means divi- nation or witchcraft in Colonial Yucatec (Barrera Vasquez 1980: 271, 272), Cakchiquel (Coto 1983: 268), and Pokomchi (Miles 1957: 751). Barrera Vasquez (1980: 272) tentatively translates itzam as "brujo o mago de agua," further noting that the root na signifies to contemplate, understand, or divine in a number of Mayan languages. In Meso- 33</page><page sequence="41">collected from plants was afforded great respect by the Post-Classic Yucatec. The Relation de Valladolid states that during the benediction of a temple, the Ah kin aspersed dew previously gath- ered from leaves (de la Garza et al. 1983, 2: 38). The Relation de Valladolid (de la Garza et al. 1983, 2: 38) also mentions that, during a temple benediction, the Yucatec priest wore an alb, chasuble, and miter, and scattered dew ( itz ) with a hyssop. These same elements are mentioned in the following account of fire walking, although here there are important additional details. The "hyssop" is now described as having serpent tails, "un hisopo atadas en el muchas colas de vibora y culebras ponzoriosas" (de la Garza et al. 1983, 2: 39). Landa (in Tozzer 1941: 105) also mentions a serpent aspergillum carried by the priest during baptism; "in his hand he carried an aspergillum made of a short stick finely worked, and for the hairs or bristles of the hyssop there were certain tails of serpents which are like rattlesnakes." It is possible that the small, drilled jade rattlesnake-tail pendants from the Sacred Cenote at Chichen Itza were parts of serpent-tailed aspergilla (for exam- ples, see Coggins and Shane 1984: no. 141). Tozzer (1941: note 480) mentions that the ser- pent aspergillum is represented on page iood and 1 1 ib of the Codex Madrid. It also appears on Madrid pages 60c and 106a. In these two in- stances, and on Madrid Page iood, God D holds the object (Figs. I4a-c). A markedly similar scene occurs at Santa Rita, where God D again appears with the snake aspergillum (Fig. i4d). Whereas itz signifies "dew" in Yucatec, tzitz signifies "to bless" or "sprinkle." Moreover, the word for hys- sop or aspergillum is tzitzab (Barrera Vasquez 1980: 862). The Yucatec term tzab means "rattle- snake tail," thus tzitzab, or tzitz tzab, is probably the term for the serpent-tailed aspergillum. At Santa Rita and in the three Madrid scenes, God D wears a tall cylindrical headdress, proba- bly the priestly "miter" mentioned in the Relation de Valladolid (Fig. 14). In the Codex Madrid, God D is represented no less than fourteen times with the miter of the Ah Kin. An excellent in-the- round representation of God D wearing the miter can be seen on a Chen Mul effigy censer illus- 34 america, divinatory scrying was often performed with reflective pools of water as well as mirrors (Taube 1983: 112-113). In the Motul Dictionary, nenba is glossed as "mirarse al espejo, o en agua" (Barrera Vasquez 1980: 565). It is also noteworthy that nen, the Yucatec word for mirror, is present in the expression nen ol, signifying to "consider" or "contemplate," the same general meaning that Barrera Vasquez (1980: 565) provides for na. The term itz present in the name of Itzamna may be a Nahua loan word. In Classical Nahuatl, the root itz carries the meaning of both divination and obsidian. Thus, whereas obsidian is referred to as itztetl or itzli, itzpopolhuia signifies "prede- cir, anunciar lo por venir," and itztimotlalia , "mirar, observar, considerar una cosa, pre- meditar, reflexionar sobre lo que se debe hacer" (Simeon 1977: 210-21 1). The Nahuatl meanings of "foretell" or "contemplate" are virtually identi- cal to the cited Mayan meanings of itz. In Central Mexico, mirrors were frequently fashioned from obsidian. Thus an important attribute of Tezcatli- poca, the "smoking mirror," was the round obsid- ian mirror. During the Classic period, Teotihua- can was a major obsidian source for both Central Mexico and the Maya region. The presence of the itz obsidian mirror in the headdress and appella- tive glyph of the Classic God D suggests that this may be an especially early loan. Although it is a mirror plaque, the headdress device of God D also resembles a flower with a long outpouring stream (Figs. I2f-h). In the ico- nography of Teotihuacan, mirrors are frequently compared to flowers (Taube n.d.a). However, among the Maya, the identification may be partly phonetic. In Yucatec, itz also signifies dew, se- men, tears, resin, and other exuding liquids (Barrera Vasquez 1980: 271-272); the dew or nec- tar of flowers well accords with this meaning of itz. In a petition for abundant crops recorded in the Relation de Kanpocolche y Chochola, Itzamna is referred to as "senor grande del cielo y que estas puesto en las nubes y en el cielo" (de la Garza et al. 1983, 2: 323). Lizana mentions a similar text regarding Itzamat Ul: "I am the itz (dew or sub- stance) of heaven, I am the itz of the clouds" (translation by Thompson 1939: 152). The dew</page><page sequence="42">35 Fig. 14 Late Post-Classic representations of God D in office of priest with "miter," "chasuble," and tzitzab snake "hyssop."

Dressed in the miter and chasuble and brandish- ing the serpent-tailed hyssop, the Post-Classic God D was clearly considered as a paramount priest of the Yucatec Maya pantheon. The significance of Itzamna seems to have dif- fered little in the Classic and Post-Classic periods. In both periods, he was closely identified with wisdom and esoteric knowledge. Colonial ac- counts describe Itzamna as the high god of the Maya. Thus, in the Relation de Valladolid, Itzamna is referred to as the supreme ruler, or ah tepal, of the sky. Hernandez (in Saville 1921: 211) com- pares Itzamna to God the Father of the Christian trinity. According to the Relation de Ekbalam, 2 The vast majority of Chen Mul-style incensarios wear the upright cloth "miter," and it is quite possible that they are portrayed as surrogate priests, those who make the offerings to the actual gods. Thus the incensario figures often hold maize balls and copal bags; rather than being offerings received, these items may actually be goods presented by the incensario figures to the gods.</page><page sequence="43">Itzamna was the paramount god of the Yucatec; "adoraban un solo dios que habia por nombre Hunab y Zamna [Itzamna]" (de la Garza et al. 1983, 2: 139). In Classic vessel scenes, Itzamna is frequently seated upon a throne and faces a subsid- iary deity, such as God N or God L (e.g., Coggins 1975: fig. 127b). In these scenes, God D is clearly portrayed as a lord receiving a lesser dignitary. In the Colonial sources, it is also recorded that Itzamna was a god of divination and other eso- teric knowledge. In the Pocom ceremony during the month of Uo, the priests, physicians, and sor- cerers spread sacred screenfold books on fresh branches in homage to Kinich Ahau Itzamna, who is described as "the first priest" (Landa, in Tozzer 1941: 153). According to Cogolludo, Itzamna was credited with the invention of writ- ing (cited in Thompson 1939: 52). David Stuart (cited in L. Scheie and M. E. Miller 1986: 138, note 10) notes that at the Puuc site of Xcalumkin, the name phrase of God D appears in association with the title ah dzib, or "he of the writing." Linda Scheie and Mary Ellen Miller (1986: 138) mention that God D is often identified with the scribal arts on Classic Maya vessels. In one Late Classic vessel scene, God D appears to be por- trayed in the act of teaching writing (Robicsek and Hales 1981: vessel 56). Although the aged figure wears the netted headdress commonly found with God N, his large square eye identifies him as God D. There are strong indications that during the Clas- sic and Post-Classic periods, God D was consid- ered as an omnipresent god who resided in the heavens as well as on the earth. In Classic iconogra- phy, God D commonly appears with sacred world trees, frequently identified with the nadir, zenith, and four quarters in Mesoamerican thought (Fig. i2h; other examples, see W. R. Coe 1967: 100; M. D. Coe 1973: no. 20; 1978: no. 8; 1982: no. 10; Robicsek and Hales 1982: vessel 108). The identifi- cation of Itzamna with world trees continues into the Post-Classic period. On Dresden page 41b, the head of God D forms the lower trunk of a tree. Another example appears on the Dresden new year pages. Aside from the red tree of the east, the world directional trees on Dresden pages 26 to 28 are labeled as yax che ceiba trees with the yax and che signs affixed to a portrait glyph of Itzamna. On Madrid page 96a, the head of God D serves as the base of a twisted stone tree or column. This scene recalls the description by Andres de Avendano of the stone column at the late seventeenth-century town of Tayasal. Termed the yax cheil cab, or "first tree of the world," the column was said to have a sculptured face at the base. According to Aven- dano, the Itza revered this face as the god Ah Cocah Mut (Means 191 7: 135, 136). Also known as Yax Cocah Mut, this entity is an aspect of Itzamna (Tozzer 1941: note 695). Just as the world trees project into the heavens as well as into the earth, so God D is identified with both regions. Colonial accounts describe Itzamna as the supreme sky god; the celestial aspect of Itzamna was decidedly present during the Classic period as well. Hellmuth (1987: 364-367) notes that the Classic God D merges with a major deni- zen of the world tree and the heavens, the afore- mentioned Principal Bird Deity. Thus the figures share particular costume elements, such as the Akbal brow mirror, and in many instances God D has the serpent wings of the Principal Bird Deity (Hellmuth 1987: figs. 555-557). The association of God D and the Principal Bird Deity continues into the Late Post-Classic period. On the Codex Paris page 11, a rare Post-Classic form of the Principal Bird Deity appears in the scene corresponding to Katun 10 Ahau, a Katun concerning God D (Taube 1987). Although there is little direct evi- dence of a Classic identification of God D with the earth, for the Post-Classic and Colonial periods, it is both explicit and widespread. According to Thompson (1970b: 210, 218), one Yucatec term for Itzamna was Itzam Cab Ain, or "Itzam Earth Caiman." The great caiman was a widespread symbol of the earth in ancient Meso- america, highland Mexico, and the Maya region (Nicholson 1971: 403-404, Thompson 1950: 71). However, in the Colonial Yucatec dictionaries, the term itzam cab ain is glossed as "ballena" or whale (Barrera Vasquez 1980: 272), and it could be argued that Itzam Cab Ain simply refers to this beast, not to any cosmological concepts re- 36</page><page sequence="44">garding Itzamna and the earth. Nonetheless, it appears that the reference to whales does derive from the concept of an Itzamna caiman floating upon the sea. In Late Post-Classic iconography, there is strong evidence for the identification of Itzamna with the earth caiman. Thompson (1970b: fig. 4b) illustrates a scene from the Codex Dresden depict- ing Itzamna peering out of the face of a bicephalic caiman (Fig. 15a). Thompson (1970b: 215) also suggests that a number of cached figurines exca- vated by Thomas Gann at Santa Rita represent the caiman aspect of Itzamna. Two of the Santa Rita figurines illustrated by Gann (1900: pl. xxxiii) are bicephalic caimans with human faces emerging from the mouths. In at least one case, the figure is clearly aged, and it is likely that these figurines constitute three-dimensional versions of the Dresden scene (Fig. 15b). A mural within Structure 2 of the Pinturas Group at Coba suggests that the Dresden and Santa Rita caimans represent the earth. Although much damaged, the Late Post-Classic mural represents human figures standing upon the crested and scaly body of a caiman, as if it were the earth (see Lom- bardo de Ruiz et al. 1987: pl. 52). With its scales and back scutes, the caiman body is extremely similar to the Itzamna caiman represented in the Codex Dresden. A series of day signs runs in consecutive order along the caiman body (Fig. 15c). Although not mentioned by Thompson, there is another excellent representation of the Itzamna earth caiman at Late Post-Classic Santa Rita. In the famous Mound 1 murals at Santa Rita, the gods of the Tun cycle are positioned above a hori- zontal band which, in turn, runs above an area containing fish and marine shells. On close inspec- tion, it can be seen that the band is a caiman body, with the same back crest, vertical bands, and scales found on the Dresden example (see Gann 1990: pl. 31). In other words, the human figures are positioned over the caiman earth float- ing above the sea. The head of the creature ap- pears on both sides of the doorway, with the widely open jaws flanking the door. Although not drawn in full by Gann, the caiman was pro- vided with forelimbs and scaly claws (Fig. I5d). The headdress of this creature provides an espe- cially pertinent detail. It contains the aforemen- tioned priestly miter pierced with a stingray or bone perforator. A virtually identical miter, again with the same perforator, is worn by God D in the same mural at Santa Rita (Fig. I4d). Clearly, this is no ordinary caiman. Instead, as Itzam Cab Ain, the caiman wears priestly accouterments of Itzamna. In his initial identification of God D as Itzamna, Seler ([1887b]; 1902-23, 1: 379-381) notes that the Maya god is very similar to Tonacatecuhtli, "Lord of Our Sustenance," the Central Mexican old god of the earth and creation: For as the Mexican Tonacatecuhtli, the lord of gen- eration, is supposed to be in the topmost thirteenth heaven, and at the same time also he (or his feminine companion) appears as lord of the earth, so also the ideas of heaven and earth, below and above, seem to me present also in this Yucatec figure [Itzamna]. In the cult this god appears with the distinguishing marks of a fire god, which also among the Mexicans is the old god and coincides to a greater or lesser extent with the lord of generation, the lord of life, (translation from Thompson and Richardson 1939, 1: 68-69) Seler (1902-23), 1: 379-381) mentions that the Yucatec fire festival of Mac was dedicated to Itzamna (see Tozzer 1941: 162-164). The Ritual of the Bacabs, discovered after the early work of Seler, provides further support for the association of Itzamna with fire. In one passage, Itzam Cab is compared to the three-stone koben hearth (Roys 1965: 49-50). In another chant, concerning birth and the placenta, the placenta is said to be placed under the "bowels" ( homtan ) of Itzam Cab. Ralph Roys (1965: note 127) suggests that this area corre- sponds to the hearth, since among the contempo- rary Yucatec, the placenta is buried under the koben hearthstones. In fact, a more literal transla- tion of uhomtanil itzam cab would be "the central pit of Itzam Cab," which accords well with the koben hearth within the Maya house. In Central Mexico, Tonacatecuhtli is a god of birth and gen- eration and often appears with the primordial copulating human couple, and on Borgia page 61, he is in the squatting position of birth (Fig. 16a).

Seler (1963, 1: 67) interprets this as an allusion to fire; the making of fire is compared to the act of coitus, the making of life. Seler (1902-23, 1: 380) also notes that both Tonacatecuhtli and God D are identified with maize. Seler mentions that in the Maya codices, God D frequently appears with the maize god. One of the Colonial epithets of Itzamna is Itzamna Kauil, kauil being a Yucatec term refer- ring to abundance and sustenance. Stuart (1987b: 15) has recently supplied epigraphic evidence that during the Classic period, Kauil was a name for God K. In the following discussion of God E, it will be noted that during the Classic period, Gods 39</page><page sequence="47">D and K share a particular style of coiffure with an important Classic Maya god of maize. Both Itzamna and Tonacatecuhtli are aged cre- ator gods associated with earth and heavens, birth, creation, fire, and maize. Like Itzamna, Tonacatecuhtli was also identified with trees. On Borgia page 9 and Vaticanus B page 28, Tonacatecuhtli appears with a flowering tree sprouting from the top of his head (Seler 1963, 1: 64). In the Codex Borgia, the tips of the branches are supplied with round white elements, and it is possible that the scene depicts a silk-cotton tree (ceiba). It has been noted that as the sacred axis mundi, the ceiba was closely related to Itzamna. The concept of Tonacatecuhtli as a sacred tree may well relate to the most striking trait shared between the Mexican and Maya gods: the earth caiman. Tonacatecuhtli is not only the regent of Cipactli, meaning caiman, the first of the twenty day names, but also presides over the trecena 1- Cipactli (Caso 1971: 337-338). On Vaticanus B page 87, a caiman lies underneath the primordial couple appearing with Tonacatecuhtli. Seler (1963, 2: 28, 41) cites a number of instances in the Codex Borgia in which Tonacatecuhtli wears the spiny skin of the caiman. Of course, this immediately recalls the Dresden and Santa Rita representations of God D within the earth caiman. The example on Borgia pages 39 and 40 is one of the developed illustrations of Tonacatecuhtli as the earth caiman (Fig. 16b). Here Tonacatecuhtli appears as a great open- mouthed caiman whose spiny body encloses the entire scene on Borgia page 40. Whereas the head and forelimbs appear on page 39, the re- mains of the diminutive lower limbs can be seen at the base of the scene on page 40. Seler (1963, 2: 41) notes that Borgia page 40 depicts an under- world event enclosed by the caiman earth. But although the earth creature is supplied with a caiman mouth, the head is that of Tonacate- cuhtli, with the pointed chin, white hair, and feathered headdress found with other representa- tions of the aged creator god. Moreover, the col- ored bar on the cheek of the caiman mouth - an emblem of Xochipilli - is a characteristic also found with Tonacatecuhtli (Fig. 16a). A series of day signs pass within the body of the Tonacatecuhtli caiman. Seler (1963, 2: 42) points out that to the right side of the caiman head, the mouth of the second day sign, Ehecatl, can be discerned. The day signs then pass in con- secutive order, to the third day, Calli; the fourth, Cuetzpalin; the fifth, Coatl; and so on, all the way down the right side of the caiman body to end with Malinalli at the rear of the creature. An- other pattern of day signs continues from the rear up the left side of the creature to end near its head. Although Seler does not mention this, it is probable that the great Tonacatecuhtli caiman head serves as the first day sign, Cipactli, with the partially obscured Ehecatl head constituting the second day of the count. In concept, the place- ment of consecutive day signs along the body of the earth caiman is identical to the Pinturas Group mural at Coba. Summary Along with other Maya scenes, the Coba and Santa Rita murals reveal that the Post-Classic Yucatec conception of the earth caiman was very similar to that of highland Mexico. In both re- gions, the caiman was identified with an aged god of creation and sustenance. In both regions, the aged god also appears as a personified tree, quite probably the axis mundi. Because of the many spe- cific parallels, the Maya Itzamna and the Mexican Tonacatecuhtli should be regarded as historically related entities. It is possible that the caiman attri- butes of Itzamna derive from the iconography of Post-Classic Central Mexico. However, the im- mediate origins of Tonacatecuhtli are obscure, and this figure cannot be readily identified prior to the Late Post-Classic codices. This is not so for the Maya Itzamna. Representations of Itzamna are widespread during the Classic period and may be traced as early as the Protoclassic Hauberg Stela. However, during the Classic period, the zoomor- phic counterpart of God D is not a caiman but rather the Principal Bird Deity. During both the Classic and Post-Classic periods, Itzamna is closely identified with writing, divination, and other esoteric lore. In many Post-Classic scenes, 40</page><page sequence="48">sentation of maize sprouting out of the earth (Taube 1985, 1986, 1988). In the Classic scenes, the Tonsured Maize God appears rising out of a tortoise shell. However, Houston notes that on a carved cylindrical column from Uxmal, God C is the protagonist emerging from the tortoise shell (Fig. 1 of). The reference to corn is still explicit, for a clear maize sign is placed on the head of the God C figure. God E is extremely common in the iconogra- phy of Post-Classic Yucatan, appearing widely in the codices and in Late Post-Classic monumental sculpture and mural paintings. Depictions of God E are frequent in the murals of Tulum and Tancah. In Mural 1 of Tancah Structure 12, God E is seated directly on a sloping grinding stone (Fig. i7d). The vast majority of Late Post-Classic Maya diving gods - erroneously identified as "bee gods" by Roys (1933: 63) - are actually repre- sentations of the maize god (Fig. 18). Representa- tions of the diving god usually bear prominent maize foliation at the tops of their heads. In a number of examples, the diving figure has some sort of feather-like elements projecting from the arms (Figs. 18c). These elements are also found with an explicit God E on Madrid page 68a (Fig. i8e). In the scene corresponding to the yearbearer Kan on Madrid page 35, God E appears as a div- ing god with the same device projecting from the arms (Fig. i8d). The prominent jogged line pass- ing through the face explicitly identifies this fig- ure as God E. On the central column of Tulum Structure 1, there is a partially eroded representa- tion of a diving maize god rendered in profile (see A. G. Miller 1982: pl. 40). Victoria Bricker (1986: 147) notes that the foliated descending figures seen in profile on Dresden pages 15a and 15b are accompanied by a verbal compound to be read upakah, or "he planted it," a reading that accords well with the suggested agricultural significance of the diving god (Fig. i8f). The stucco diving god from Tulum Structure 16 is depicted with flowers rising behind his arms and feet (Fig. 18a). In the Chilam Balam of Chumayel description of Katun 1 1 Ahau, the de- scent of Bolon Mayel is mentioned in terms of flowers and agricultural fertility: 4i he is depicted as a priest, complete with the priestly regalia and accouterments described by the sixteenth-century Spanish chroniclers. In sum- mary, Itzamna is an extremely powerful and aged god, with a strength based on esoteric knowledge rather than physical prowess. GodE Schellhas (1897, 1904), the first to isolate the attributes and name glyph of God E, correctly identifies this figure as the maize god (Fig. 17). Schellhas notes that the large element curling off the top of the head is also found growing out of the Kan sign, and for this reason, he identifies it as a maize cob. Cyrus Thomas (1882: 80) had previously identified the Kan sign as maize grain. Although it has been found that this device actu- ally refers to the tamale (Love 1989; Taube 1989a), it nevertheless is a maize sign. According to Schellhas (1904: 24), God E is the Maya coun- terpart of Centeotl, the Central Mexican god of maize. The correspondence with Centeotl is cor- roborated by the vertical jogged line passing down the face of the Post-Classic God E (Figs. I7b-e, g). Seler (1963, 1: 167) notes that the same facial marking is found with contemporaneous representations of Centeotl. The Post-Classic appellative glyph of God E is the foliated head of the maize god supplied with the T24 prefix (Fig. 17a). The maize growth sprouts from the brow and curls back around the head to end over the cheek. Appearing with a series of black rectangular markings, the foliation is notably similar to the forehead bracket of the Post-Classic God C (Fig. 10). In fact, the conven- tional glyph of God E in the Codex Madrid is the head of God C with the T24 prefix (Fig. 17a, right). The curious conflation of corn with God C may be due to the extreme sacredness the Mayas ascribe to maize. Thus a common contem- porary Yucatec reverential term for corn is santo ixim, or "holy maize seed." Stephen Houston (per- sonal communication, 1983) has pointed out an interesting version of the Classic period "resurrec- tion scene," which has been identified as a repre-</page><page sequence="49">Fig. 17 Representations of God E in Post-Classic Maya epigraphy and art.

In many cases the death of maize may concern auguries of the yearly harvest, but the association with death appears to be more pervasive. In the Ritual of the Bacabs (Roys 1965: 9) the entrance to the underworld is identified with Ix Hun Ahau and Uaxac Yol Kauil. According to Landa (Tozzer 1941: 132), Hun Ahau was the lord of the underworld: "They maintained that there was in this place [Metnal] a devil, the prince of all the devils, whom all obeyed, and they call him in their language Hunhau." The second entity, Uaxac Yol Kauil, has been interpreted as the maize god by Roys (1965) and J. Thompson (1970b: 289). The Foliated Maize God, or God E, is not lim- ited to the Post-Classic Period; this deity is well represented in Late Classic Maya epigraphy and art (Fig. 19a). Seler (1902-23, 3: 593) was the first to note that the portrait appellative glyph of the Post-Classic codical God E is virtually identical to the Classic numeral eight head variant previously identified by Goodman (1897: 46). Herbert Spinden (191 3: fig. 123) describes a number of foliated maize gods on Classic Maya monuments. One of the figures, from the side of Quirigua Stela H, displays a long, flattened brow topped by a growth of hair (Fig. 19c). An almost identi- cal coiffure appears on an unprovenanced Late Classic monument (Fig. 19b). In this case, Foli- ated Maize God heads replace the conventional uah maize curls placed over the ear spools. Like the Quirigua example, each head has an elongated and bare forehead, with a segmented headband across the brow (see also Fig. 2ie). 3 On Dresden page 42c, Chac is in the act of pulling bowels out of the slashed abdomen of God E. The identification of maize with disembowelment appears in other regions of an- cient Mesoamerica. At the Temple of the Building Columns at El Tajin, there is a late Classic scene of growing maize flanking the strung bowels of a sacrificial victim (see Wilkerson 1980: 220-221). In addition, a curious Aztec phrase describes the disembowelment of maize: "Am I perchance an ear of green maize that one will break open my entrails?" (Sahagun 1950-71, bk. 6: 228). It appears that for the Aztec, some process in the harvesting of green corn was compared to disembowelment. Then the water descended, it came from the heart of the sky for the baptism of the House of Nine Bushes. With it descended Bolon Mayel; sweet was his mouth and the tip of his tongue. Sweet were his brains. Then descended the four mighty supernatural jars, this was the honey of the flowers. (Roys 1933: 104) In the Colonial Yucatec dictionaries, bolon mayel is glossed as either "fragrancia" or "agua bendita" (Barrera Vasquez 1980: 63). In the Motul Dictio- nary, this term also glossed as tzitzabil haa (Barrera Vasquez 1980: 63), that is, water thrown from the serpent-tailed aspergillum, or tzitzab. Al- though this detailed description of perfumed fall- ing water recalls the aged god of sustenance, Itzamna, it is also suggestive of the maize god, who is widely identified with flowers in ancient Mesoamerica. The Central Mexican Xochipilli, or "flower prince," was also a god of corn. Nich- olson (1971: 416) discusses Xochipilli and Cen- teotl under a single complex: "the cult which re- volved around the cultivation of the staple food plant, maize. " The diving god may be an embodi- ment of Bolon Mayel, a fragrant god of moisture and fertility. According to Schellhas (1904: 25) God E was solely a god of life and fertility and lacked any direct association with death and the underworld: god E has nothing to do with the powers of the underworld; he is a god of life, of prosperity and fruitfulness; symbols of death are never found in con- nection with him. However, God E is often affiliated with death and sacrifice in Post-Classic Yucatan. This may be partly due to the agricultural cycle of maize, the planting in the earth equivalent to death and burial, and the harvest, the severing of the maize cob head. On Dresden page 34a and Madrid page 34b, God E is represented as a severed head (Figs. I7e-f). In the Las Pinturas group at Coba, there is a Post-Classic mural depicting the head of God E placed upon a Kan sign (Fig. I7g). God E may even be found disemboweled. Dresden page 42c represents Chac pulling bowels out of the slashed abdomen of God E. On Paris page 19, entrails are also seen pulled from the slit belly of God E (Fig. 17b).3 Here and with many other examples of the 44</page><page sequence="52">Fig. 19 Classic representations of the Tonsured Maize God and Foliated Maize God.

In contrast to the foliated god, the Tonsured Maize God lacks cranial maize growth. Instead, his elongated head is shaved to resemble a mature maize cob (Figs, igd, 21). At times, a horizontal band of hair is left on the lower brow, creating two distinct zones of hair separated by a shaved region (Fig. 21a). The cap- ping hair crest of the Tonsured Maize God mim- ics the pollen tassel appearing at the top of the cob. Among the Yucatec Maya, maize silk is iden- tified with human hair. Thus in Yucatec, tzuc sig- nifies a crest of hair or the "silk" tassel at the top of the cob (Barrera Vasquez 1980: 866). In one of the Colonial Chilam Balam of Chumayel riddles, pibil nal, or baked green corn, is alluded to as a woman with twisted hair: "her hair is twisted into a tuft" (Roys 1933: 130). Although virtually absent in Post-Classic Maya iconography, the Tonsured Maize God is widely depicted in Classic Maya art, appearing on stone monuments and es- pecially, Late Classic ceramic vessels.4 Recent discoveries at the site of Cacaxtla, Tlaxcala, directly support my initial identification of the tonsured figure as a god of maize. Cacaxtla is perhaps best known for the remarkable polychrome murals from Stuctures A and B, paintings that exhibit clear elements of Maya cos- tume and iconography (Foncerrada de Molina 1980). However, in 1987 and 1988, additional mu- rals were discovered south of Structures A and B (Santana Sandoval et al. 1990). In one area, a pair of murals flanked a stairway. On both sides, there are depictions of growing maize with mature cobs portrayed as the head of the Tonsured Maize God (Fig. I9e). Thus the elongated head has a lower horizontal crest of hair and a capping tuft, 4 It has recently been suggested that the conventional name glyph of the Tonsured Maize God is to be read nal, a common Mayan term for "maize ear" (Scheie, Mathews, and Louns- bury 1990: 3-5). The authors note that among contemporary Choi, na'al is the term for "el dios de abundancia" (see Aulie and Aulie 1978: 85). According to Scheie, Mathews, and Lounsbury, the Classic Maya term for the Tonsured Maize God was hurt nal. clearly serving as the maize silk. In addition, yel- low maize kernels are carefully delineated on the brow. The Cacaxtla depictions of the Tonsured Maize God indicate that this figure probably repre- sents mature yellow maize, in contrast to the Foli- ated Maize God, who seems to embody the still green and tender growing corn. Both the foliated and tonsured forms of the maize god are present in the Early Classic period. An excellent example of the Tonsured Maize God can be found in the "Realistic Paintings" mural fragments from the Tetitla compound of Teoti- huacan. Foncerrada de Molina (1980: 189-191) notes that the "Realistic Paintings" are not wholly Teotihuacano, but rather, display explicit Maya conventions. One of the fragments depicts a fig- ure with a clear Maya profile and an especially elongated cranium marked with a single tuft of hair (Fig. 20a). Affixed to the side of his head are two ball-like devices, with the uppermost sup- plied with a sprout of maize growth. These balls are early forms of the corn curl element of Maya iconography, which I (Taube 1989a) consider to be a representation of the maize tamale, or uah. With his elongated tonsured head and the maize signs, the Tetitla figure can be safely identified as an Early Classic form of the Tonsured Maize God. Most Early Classic Maya representations of the maize god are similar to the Tetitla example in one special way - maize foliation does not sprout directly out of the cranium but rather emerges from a discrete maize device placed at the top of the head (e.g., Figs. 20a, d, f-g). Thus, on one Tikal carved vessel, the maize foliation is not an organic part of the head, but sprouts out of a maize seed cartouche (Fig. 2of). Another carved vessel depicts maize growth emerging out of a Kan sign in the zoomorphic headdress of the maize god (Fig. 20g). Maize sprouting out of a cranial Kan sign is also found on Post-Classic examples of God E (Figs. 17b, i8e). However, the foliation usually sprouts directly out of the head in Post-Classic representations. Although rare, this convention also appears in one Early Classic example (Fig. 20c). Like the conventional Late Classic head vari- 46</page><page sequence="54">Fig. 20 Early Classic representations of the maize god.

Both this example and other Early Classic maize gods display a T86 rial maize sign affixed to the top of the head (e.g., Fig. 20b). It is possible that the slightly effaced numeral eight head variant from Yaxchilan Lintel 48 repre- sents another Early Classic example of the foli- ated maize god (Fig. 2oe). However, the Pomona Flare numeral eight head variant identified by Justeson, Norman, and Hammond (1988) has maize growing out of a U-shaped element rather than the head itself (Fig. 2od). The Pomona Flare and other early examples of the maize god have a long, almost "Olmecoid" upper lip with downwardly projecting incisors (Figs. 2ob-e, g). On one Early Classic modeled vessel, the maize god's incisors are so large and protruding as to be termed buck teeth (Fig. 2oh). This example and many Early Classic maize god representations are supplied with whiskers, quite possibly alluding to the silk growing on the sides of the cob (e.g., Figs. 2od-f, h). It appears that both the tonsured and foliated Clas- sic forms of the maize god are quadripartite. A set of four foliated maize deities appears on the sides of Copan Stela H and on Lintel 3 of Tikal Temple IV (Fig. 19a). The Holmul Dancer, a red-painted form of the Tonsured Maize God, often occurs in pairs on Late Classic vessels. However, Michael Coe (1978: no. 14) illustrates one vessel depicting three of these figures, each identified with a particular emblem glyph. I suspect that the Holmul Dancer is actually quadripartite, but that the elaborate cos- tumes prevent four from being easily depicted on a single cylindrical vessel. A vessel excavated at Seacal, in the Coban drainage of central Alta Verapaz, depicts four distinct Tonsured Maize Gods, all of them apparently dancing (see Smith 1952: fig. 25a). In addition, a fine Late Classic in- cised vase from Copan depicts four Tonsured Maize Gods, evidently in the role of court artisans (see L. Scheie and M. E. Miller 1986: pl. 44a). In Classic vessel scenes, the Tonsured Maize God is closely identified with the Howler Mon- key artisans and the Headband Twins, Classic counterparts of the Popol Vuh Hero Twins, Xbalanque and Hunahpu. It is now clear that this figure is the Classic version of Hun Hunahpu, the father of the Hero Twins. In many Late Classic dishes, or lac , he appears as a severed head, recall- ing both the fate of the decapitated Hun Hunahpu and the aforementioned heads of the Post-Classic maize god. Although it is not mentioned explic- itly in the Popol Vuh, I (Taube 1986) have argued that the descent to the underworld for the re- mains of Hun Hunahpu is a version of the wide- spread emergence myth describing the origin of mankind. In the form of maize, the remains of Hun Hunahpu supply the substance from which people are made. One interesting Late Classic form of the maize god may represent corn as the idealized ancestor. In this case the deity is supplied with the conven- tional torch of God K, although at times, the outcurling elements more resemble vegetation than smoke (Fig. 21). Aside from the cranial torch element, the figure bears no overt character- istics of God K. Thus, rather than possessing saurian body scutes or a serpent foot, he is en- tirely human. On one carved bone from Copan, he is bearded and appears with a more feminine form of the Tonsured Maize God, as if the some- what androgenous deity had split into a male and female pair (Fig. 21c). Copan Stela 11 depicts the same bearded form, here standing upon a bony jaw-like device forming the upper portion of the Uayeb sign (Fig. 2 id). Quite likely this lunate death element serves to denote the entrance to the underworld, if not the netherworld itself. Linda Scheie and Mary Ellen Miller (1986: 152) note that both of the bearded figures appear to depict the Copan lord Yax Pac, with Stela 11 being a posthumous monument. Virtually the same situation occurs at Palenque. The sarcophagus lid of Pacal depicts the same God K form of the Tonsured Maize God (Fig. 2ie). Thus, while lacking the serpent foot, he has the forehead torch and a coiffure almost identical to the aforementioned maize god on the side of Quirigua Stela H. Moreover, the beaded belt and skirt are also attributes of the Tonsured Maize God and are worn by Chan Bahlum upon the Tablet of the Foliated Cross as he impersonates 48</page><page sequence="56">Fig. 21 Tonsured Maize God with cranial torch of GodK.

On a painted Chenes capstone, the more conventional form of the Tonsured Maize God appears in asso- ciation with the same skeletal device (Mayer 1980: pl. 70). Much as Ruz Lhuillier (1973: 225) origi- nally suggested, the sarcophagus scene portrays the deceased ruler as the maize god. Summary During the Post-Classic period, representations of God E are many. The Late Post-Classic diving god motif clearly represents the descending maize god, not a diving bee deity. In Post-Classic ico- nography, God E is commonly found in scenes of death as well as of life and abundance. Although some of the codical death associations are surely concerned with specific auguries of crop abun- dance and failure, other scenes allude to the agri- cultural cycle of maize. A clear example is the decapitation of God E, which surely alludes to the harvested maize cob. Many of the underworld and death associations of the Post-Classic God E are also present in classic iconography. One important Classic form of the corn deity, the Tonsured Maize God, is an ances- tral form of the sixteenth-century Quichean Hun Hunahpu, the father of the Hero Twins who was decapitated in the underworld. The two Late Clas- sic forms of the maize deity - the Tonsured Maize God and the Foliated Maize God - share many traits, and it appears that they derive from a single Early Classic form. During the Early Classic Pe- riod, the cranial maize growth does not usually sprout directly out of the head, but rather out of a maize sign placed on the head. Whereas this maize element is frequently fixed into the cranium of the Late Classic Tonsured Maize God, Late Classic and Post-Classic forms of the Foliated Maize God usually lack the discrete maize sign. Instead, the maize vegetation tends to sprout as a natural and integral extension of the head. God F (see Gods Q and R) In his discussion of God F, Schellhas (1904: 25- 27) seriously confuses three distinct gods. For Schellhas (1904: 26), the major distinguishing cri- terion for God F is a particular form of facial marking: "The characteristic mark of God F is a single black line usually running perpendicularly down the face in the vicinity of the eye." How- ever, although Schellhas correctly distinguishes this line from facial lines of Gods C and E, he fails to distinguish between the facial markings of three other deities. Thus one of his cited examples (fig. 34) is actually the face of God A'. The two other gods also display distinct facial markings. Whereas one deity has a prominent Caban curl sign upon the cheek (Schellhas 1904: figs. 30, 33), the other is supplied with a curving black or dot- ted band that passes down from the forehead through the eye to the back of the cheek. In his discussion of God F, Schellhas actually describes this last god, which he correctly considers to be a deity of war and human sacrifice. J. Eric S. Thompson (1950: 131-132) is the first to describe in detail the differences between these two gods. In this important discussion, Thomp- son suggests that the Schellhas God F designation should be entirely abandoned. According to Thompson, the two gods require entirely new letter designations. Thus Thompson labels the god of sacrifice as God Q, and the deity with the Caban facial curl, God R. To avoid any further confusion, I will follow the letter designation pro- posed by Thompson. Detailed discussion of these two gods will appear below under the headings of God Q and God R. God G Due to the prominent solar kin sign in the name glyph of God G, Schellhas (1904: 27) cor- rectly identifies this deity as the Sun God (Fig. 22). Floyd Lounsbury (1973: 138-139) states that the entire compound is to be read ahau kin and possibly, kinich ahau , the latter being a name often mentioned in the Colonial literature (Fig. 22a). Among the diagnostic attributes of the codical God G is the face, featuring a "Roman nose" and a large square eye. The Post-Classic God G tends to wear a beard, possibly an allusion to the 50</page><page sequence="58">Fig. 22 God G, the Maya Sun God.

However, Seler (1904b: 659) notes that the Yucatec referred to solar rays as u mex kin, or "beard of the sun. " Although the Co- dex Dresden examples of God G depict him as no more than middle-aged, God G is invariably ren- dered as an old man in the Codex Madrid. Thus he displays the same chapfallen and snaggle- toothed mouth found with God D and other aged gods (Fig. 22b). In general, Post-Classic representations of God G differ little from their Classic period proto- types. The epigraphic head variants of the num- ber four are among the clearest and most consis- tent representations of the Classic Sun God (Fig. 22e). Although J. Thompson (1950: 133) states that the Classic head variant of the number four is aged, he is actually shown as a mature man at his peak of strength. If aged, his face would be al- most identical to God D, who also possesses a large square eye and Roman nose. The same portrait glyph (T1010) found with the head variant of the number four occurs as the kin glyph in Long Count texts and as the patron of the month Yaxkin (Fig. 22d; see J. Thompson 1950: figs. 22, 27). Thompson (1950: no) notes that the month Yaxkin carries the same name in Tzeltal and Tzotzil as well as Yucatec. In both Classic and Post-Classic texts, the month is writ- ten phonetically as Yaxkin, and at times, the kin sign is replaced with the face of the sun god (Thompson 1950: fig. 17, nos. 5, 8). The Classic sun deity appears with a large square eye, and, in frontal views, it is clear that he is cross-eyed (Fig. 22h). Other important traits are his filed incisors, resembling the Greek tau when viewed face on, and rope-like elements curl- ing out of the corners of his mouth. This same mouth device can be found with Dresden repre- sentations of God G (Fig. 22c). Quite frequently, the Sun God will have the quatrefoil solar kin sign fixed in the cheek, brow, or other part of the body (e.g., Figs. 22b-e, g). The mature Sun God is widely depicted on Early and Late Classic Maya monuments. In his discussion of the Palenque Triad, Heinrich Berlin (1963: fig. 7) illustrates one form of the GIII appel- lative identical to the head variant of the number four. David Kelley (1965) notes that the Palenque Tablet of the Sun records the birth of this god. However, Kelly (1965) identifies GIII as the aged God L rather than the Classic form of God G. Floyd Lounsbury (1985: 50) claims that GIII is the Sun God and suggests that the portrait glyph is to be read Ahau Kin. At Palenque, GIII is specifically identified with the T184 prefix, a paramount title of Maya kings. According to Lounsbury (1985: 48-50), this title is to be read mah kinah. However, recent epigraphic research indicates that the T184 title is actually to be read kinich (Stephen Houston, personal communication, 1990). Lounsbury also notes that GIII has strong jaguar attributes and compares him to the Popol Vuh Xbalanque, which he translates as "jaguar sun." Taking this interpre- tation one step further, Lounsbury (1985: 53-56) identifies GI as Hunahpu and suggests that the mock execution of the Popol Vuh Hero Twins is depicted on the Primitive Art Vase (Fig. 8b). Al- though it is now evident that the Classic versions of the Hero Twins are the Headband Twins, not GI and GIII, the infant jaguar victim present on the Primitive Art Vase and other vessel scenes does appear to represent the sun. The identification of the Sun God with decapita- tion is common in Late Preclassic, Classic, and Post-Classic Maya iconography. The head of the Sun God frequently occurs on Classic belt assem- blages, as if it were a trophy head (Fig. 23c). On Tikal Stelae 1 and 31, a recumbent figure appears with the back belt assemblage (Fig. 23d). This figure is none other than the jaguar baby com- monly found in Classic scenes of decapitation (e.g., Fig. 8b). On Monument 1 of Chalchuapa, El Salvador, a seated figure holds a probable sev- ered jaguar head out before him (Fig. 23e). The bearded figure bears the kin sign on the cheek, identifying him as a Late Preclassic form of the Sun God. In the illustrated drawing by William Coe, it appears that the figure has a curious snout. However, in a photograph of a cast, it can be seen that the tip is actually a pair of beads placed at the tip of an entirely human nose (Fig. 23 f). Such nose beads are common in Late Preclassic and Early Classic Maya iconography (e.g., Fig. 22d). 52</page><page sequence="60">Fig. 23 Late Preclassic and Early Classic iconography pertaining to the Sun God.

An example can be seen in the mural paintings at Santa Rita, where the bearded jaguar Sun God occurs as a severed head (Fig. 22 f). However, although the decapitation of the jaguar Sun God is common in Maya art, the significance of this event is entirely unknown. Aside from GUI, a number of other Classic jag- uar entities are also identified with the sun. Floyd Lounsbury (1985: 55) considers GUI to be entirely distinct from the deity serving as the head variant of the number seven, lord of the day Akbal and patron of the month Uo. Rather than having the squint or crossed eyes of GUI, the eyes of this deity are spiraled and surrounded by the figure- eight "cruller" device passing over the bridge of the nose. Widely referred to as the Jaguar God of the Underworld, or JGU, this entity seems to depict the night sun. Linda Scheie and Mary Ellen Miller (1986: fig. 35) illustrate several examples that appear to be conflations of GUI and the JGU and thus display the cruller along with a kin mark- ing and squint eye (e.g., Fig. 23c). The night sun, or JGU, is more commonly represented than GUI and is often found displayed on shields, decorat- ing incensarios, and emerging from bicephalic ser- pent bars. Scheie and Miller (1986: 51) also consider the Water Lily Jaguar to be an aspect of GUI, noting that this figure can substitute for the infant GUI in scenes of decapitation. The Water Lily Jaguar, named for the water lily topping the jaguar head, appears not only in Classic imagery but also on Dresden page 8a, where he appears with the "good" glyph of Zimmermann ^61.507:24), re- cently read as utzil by David Stuart (1987b). Although still little understood, it appears that the Water Lily Jaguar is identified with fire and lineage through the male line. David Stuart (1987a) notes that a jaguar tail may substitute for the conventional smoking-capped Ahau (T535) oc- curring in parentage statements, a device inter- preted as "child of father" (Figs. 24a-b). The iden- tification of the jaguar with the male line goes further, because the head or tail of the Water Lily Jaguar is frequently capped by the same T535 smoking Ahau sign (Fig. 24c). This may be traced to Late Preclassic times; on Izapa Stela 12, there is a jaguar capped with a smoking Ahau (Fig. 24c). Flames appear to be emanating from his mouth, a convention seen with later Classic depictions of the Water Lily Jaguar (Fig. 24c). Another Late Preclassic monument, Abaj Takelik Stela 1, depicts a probable jaguar with flames curl- ing from its head (Fig. 24d). The Maya identification of the jaguar with fire continued even into the Colonial period. In the Chilam Balam of Chumayel, fire is referred to as "the beckoning tongue of the jaguar" (Roys 1933: 97). In Late Post-Classic Central Mexico, jaguars are also identified with fire. Thus in the Codex Borgia, jaguar tails are used to designate smoke or flames (Fig. 24Q. Similarly, a jaguar tail ap- pears as one of the flames depicted in the initial scene of the Vase of the Thirty-one Gods, a Late Classic Maya vessel (see M. Coe 1973: 82). Al- though it is difficult to explain why the jaguar is related to fire, the Classic Maya identification of this creature with male descent may be due to the widespread association of the jaguar sun with dy- nastic male power. Among both the Classic and Post-Classic Maya, the sun god was closely identified with elite rul- ership. It has been noted that an important title of Maya lords was kinich, or sun face. A title recorded for the sixteenth-century highland Maya, it is found widely in Classic Maya inscriptions (Lounsbury 198$: 48-49). Floyd Lounsbury (1985: 48-49) also mentions that terms derived from the word kin or "sun" are used to denote rulership and wealth in Yucatec ( kinil ) and Quiche (q'uinom, q'uinomal). In the codices, the "ben-ich" ahau com- pound, denoting "lord," appears as a specific title of God G (Fig. 22a). Lounsbury (1973: 117) cites two instances in which the codical appellative is prefixed by Landa's ca. This is probably to be read c(a)ahau kin (our lord sun). An almost identical phrase for lordship appears in the Cakchiquel Saenz Dictionary: kajawal ( cahaual ), "nuestro Se- nor, Dios" (cited in Lounsbury 1973: 135). Tikal Stela 31 contains one of the clearest ex- pressions of the Maya identification of the sun god with male dynastic rulership.

Early Classic ruler Stormy Sky, in the region cor- responding to the heavens, there is a representa- tion of his father, Curl Snout, apotheosized as the sun god (Fig. 23b). Although wearing the name of Curl Snout as a headdress, the figure has the Roman nose, squint eyes, and jaguar spot cheek markings found with the Sun God. In addition, the figure wears a sharply upcurving nose bar commonly appearing with Classic and Post- Classic representations of the sun god (e.g., Fig. 22 c). The celestial sun god motif is also found on Stela 2 of Abaj Takalik, a Cycle 7 monument dating to the first century B.C. (Fig. 23a). The position of the figure is almost identical to the apotheosized Curl Snout on Stela 31; he faces downward and holds a serpent in the crook of his right arm. However, in this case, the figure also 55</page><page sequence="63">wears a prominent kin solar sign on the cheek. The two individuals below the Late Preclassic sun god have every appearance of being actual his- toric rulers. As in the case of Tikal Stela 31, the floating solar figure probably serves as a dynastic expression, with an ancestral ruler apotheosized as the sun. Summary The Post-Classic form of the Maya Sun God, God G displays many conservative traits that can be traced to even before the beginnings of the Clas- sic era. These traits are represented by specific iconographic devices, such as the kin sign, and also by complex ideological concepts. For example, during the Late Preclassic, Classic, and Post- Classic eras, the Sun God was identified with jag- uars, decapitation, fire, rulership, and dynastic de- scent. Of course, such a list of traits is a somewhat artificial construct caused by our limited knowl- edge of pre-Hispanic Maya religion. To the an- cient Maya, these various traits were synthesized into a meaningful and dynamic whole. For exam- ple, the identification of the sun with fire and dy- nastic descent may have been expressed in fire of- ferings of blood, copal, and other sacred material to honored male rulers apotheosized as the sun. To be sure, the sixteenth-century Maya of Izamal made fire offerings to one of the mythical founders of Izamal, Kinich Kakmo, the Sun-Faced Macaw. This being was said to receive the burning offer- ings in the form of a macaw, or kakmo (Tozzer 1 941: notes 689, 902). Although it is beyond the scope of this study, precisely how the Sun God was integrated into the dynastic cult will be an important topic of future investigations. Gods H and CH In his discussion of the "Chicchan-God" Schellhas (1904: 28-31) confuses and thus con- flates two similarly appearing but distinct gods. Although each of the deity glyphs has a specific prefix and an infix at the back of the skull, Schellhas considers the signs to be equivalent. One of the appellative signs, that of the god termed "der junger Gott" by Seler (1902-23, 1: 698-700), is a youthful face with a beadlike prefix at the front of the face (Figs. 25a, 26f). This pre- fix may actually be part of the headdress of the god. In the Codex Madrid, God H frequently wears this device as a vertical element projecting from the top of the headdress (e.g., Madrid page 101b). In the parietal region of the God H portrait glyph, there is a cartouche resembling the T534 inverted Ahau sign. This infixed device tends to be rimmed by a beaded band that is also found curving across the temple region of the face (Figs. 25a, d). This band probably denotes textile edg- ing, such as is commonly found on examples in the Codex Dresden of cloth wrapped around the hips (e.g., Figs. 25c, e). Quite frequently, the fig- ure wears the cylindrical headdress or "miter" found with God D, and it is possible that, like the Post-Classic God D, God H is portrayed as a priest (Fig. 25b). In the codices, God H is closely identified with God D, the paramount priest of the Post-Classic Yucatec pantheon. On Dresden page 12c, the God H appellative glyph serves as the name of an aspect of God D wearing a Chac headdress (Fig. 25e). Moreover, the God H name glyph also ap- pears in a name phrase of God D on Dresden page 15c. In the Codex Madrid, God H can be labeled with the God D appellative glyph. An example occurs on Madrid page 88b, where the youthful God H is named God D in association with the Kan-Imix augury of "plenty. " An unusual example of God H appears on Dresden page 35b, where the God H appellative glyph serves to name a water serpent with the face of Chac (Fig. 26a). The name glyph is the conventional head of God H, although in this case it is also supplied with the wrapped-cloth turban affair commonly found worn by Dresden exam- ples of God H. The aquatic serpent of the accom- panying scene wears what appears to be a head- dress of a bound water lily pad. The front of the headdress displays the same beaded knot found in the name glyph of God H. In Classic period exam- ples of this headdress, this frontal element corre- sponds to a water lily flower (Fig. 26b). The wa- ter lily pad headdress is a diagnostic trait of an 56</page><page sequence="64">57 Fig. 25 God H in the Post-Classic codices, (a) God H appellative, Dresden page 12b (b) God H with "miter" headdress associated with Late Post-Classic Yucatec priests, Dresden page 7 c (c) God H with beaded device at side of head, Dresden page 12b (d) God H with beaded device at side of head, Madrid page 63a (e) God D with headdress of God B, figure named as God H, Dresden page 12c.</page><page sequence="65">Fig. 26 God H, the Classic head variants of the numer- als three and thirteen, and the Classic patron of the month Mac.

For this reason, Hellmuth (1987: 301) suggests that the Dresden serpent is a Post- Classic form of the Classic entity. In support of this identification, it should be noted that the wrapped turban worn by the God H appellative glyph on Dresden page 35a is also frequently found on Classic period examples of the serpent deity (Fig. 26b). The Water Lily Serpent is not the only head variant of the number thirteen. The god of the number three also appears in this context, al- though here with the bone jaw of the death god, the head variant of the number ten. Of course, it is not surprising that three and thirteen are re- lated. In Yucatec, the numerals thirteen to nine- teen are simply the numerals three to nine fol- lowed by the term for ten. Thus the Yucatec term for three is ox , and thirteen, oxlahun. Although there is no known instance of the Water Lily Ser- pent serving for the number three, there is a case where this serpent and the head variant of the numeral three are conflated into a single being. Thus, in the text of Stairway 3 at Yaxchilan, the numerical glyph for 13 Mol is the head variant of the numeral three with not only the bone jaw, but also the headdress of the serpent entity (Fig. 26c). It thus appears that the two gods are related, possibly as zoomorphic and human aspects of the same being. Since the work of Herman Beyer (193 1: 105, 108), it has been recognized that the Classic entity appearing as the head variant of three also occurs as the patron of the month Mac (Fig. 26e). Thus the figure has the same segmented headband and the circular brow element. In the illustrated Early Classic example, it can be seen that the round element clearly represents a flower. Another espe- cially important identifying element is the promi- nent taw-shaped Ik element, the Maya sign for wind. In certain examples of the Mac patron, the ik sign can directly substitute for the youthful head (e.g., Thompson 1950: 8, fig. 23). Stephen Houston (personal communication, 1989) notes that substitution between the youthful Classic en- tity and the ik sign is not limited to the Mac patron but is relatively common in the Classic script (e.g., Houston 1989a: fig. 5b, B7; fig. 5c, Di). The Classic Water Lily Serpent is also identified with the Ik wind sign. Thus, in one Late Classic vessel scene, two aged males with the headdress of the Water Lily Serpent wear large ik sign plaques on their chests (see Robicsek and Hales 1981: fig. 23a). A stucco relief in the Palace at Palenque depicts common elements of the Water Lily Serpent affixed to ik signs accompanied by a T23 na sign (see Maudslay 1889-1902, 4: pl. 18). Together, the ik and na signs may be read ik na, or "House of Wind." Both Hellmuth (1986, 1987) and I (Taube 1986) have independently noted that Dzibilchaltun Structure i-sub appears to be de- voted to the Water Lily Serpent. During Late Post-Classic reuse of this temple, an interior altar displayed a consecutive series of painted ik signs (see Andrews and Andrews 1980: figs. 125, 128). This structure may have been regarded as a house of wind, or wind temple, during the Late Post- Classic period. On close inspection, it is evident that the Post- Classic God H and the Classic entity appearing as the patron of Mac and the numeral three head variant share a number of traits. Thus the seg- mented rim headband of the Classic god - found also on the Classic Howler Monkey scribes - is quite similar to the beaded rim headpiece of God H (Fig. 26d). Moreover, the flower brow element appearing with the Classic entity compares closely to the beadlike device on the brow of the God H portrait glyph. In the Codex Dresden, the brow device can also be supplied with a beaded rim, as if it were a flower (Fig. 26f). It has been noted that on Dresden page 35b, this beaded de- vice corresponds to the flower worn in the center of the Classic water lily pad headdress (Figs. 26a- b). It is intriguing that both the illustrated exam- ple from Dresden page 6 and the God H portrait glyph on Dresden page 34c are prefixed by the numeral three. However, this may be simply coin- cidental, since on Dresden page 11 a, the God H name glyph is prefixed by the coefficient of six. Nonetheless, due to the similarities shared be- tween God H and the Classic head variants of the 59</page><page sequence="67">numbers three and thirteen, I suspect that the nu- meral three head variant is the Classic antecedent of God H. Seler (1902-23, 1: 698-700) contrasts the youth- ful God H with the individual found on Dresden page 4a, despite the fact that this figure has the identical name phrase (Fig. 27a). According to Seler, this individual is old, but actually he is of undetermined age. Because of the hand-held ser- pent, shell jewelry, and especially the probable quetzal on the back, Seler (1902-23, 1: 698) sug- gests that the figure on Dresden page 4a is Kukulcan, the Yucatec version of Quetzalcoatl. This identification is surely correct. Although Seler does not mention it, the specific headdress element this figure wears is identical to that of the Late Post-Classic Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl: a disk flanked by two knots, one partially obscured be- hind the bird head. This particular disk, the Aztec symbol of turquoise, is virtually identical to Xochicalco Glyph A, save that here the bow is infixed in the sign. Aztec representations of Quet- zalcoatl are frequently found with precisely the same elements, the turquoise disk and the flank- ing knots (Figs. 27b-c). Of course, Ehecatl- Quetzalcoatl was the Mexican god of wind, which immediately recalls the Classic Maya youthful being appearing as the patron of Mac and the head variant of the numeral three. Be- cause of the explicit accompanying God H name glyphs, it is clear that on Dresden page 4a, Quet- zalcoatl is described as an aspect of God H. Whereas "der junger Gott" continues to be re- ferred to as God H, Zimmermann (1956) termed the other figure God CH (Fig. 28). * Although God CH is also youthful, he can be readily identi- fied by his jaguar skin markings around the mouth and in patches on his body. In contrast to the beadlike affix of the God H portrait glyph, the God CH appellative is prefixed by the Yax sign (Fig. 28a). In addition, the back of the head is marked not with an inverted Ahau, but with a curious cross-hatched patterning, interpreted as serpent markings by Seler (1902-23, 1: 699). On Dresden page 3 a, there is a variant of the God CH glyph depicting the deity with the jag- uar skin facial markings. In this case, the portrait glyph is prefixed with the coefficient of one rather than the Yax sign (Fig. 28b). In the subse- quent discussion of God R, it will be noted that in the Codex Dresden, the twin counterpart of God CH - the spotted Hunahpu - also has the nu- meral one prefix. Hermann Beyer (1933: 678) was the first to recognize that God CH occurs in Clas- sic period monumental inscriptions as the head variants of the numbers nine and nineteen. Thus the Classic glyphs are prefixed with forms of the Yax sign and are supplied with jaguar spots around the mouth (Fig. 28d). Beyer also noted that in the Post-Classic Codex Dresden, the God CH appellative also serves as the coefficient for nine and nineteen (Fig. 28c). It is now known that the Classic God CH is one of the Headband Twins, Classic forms of the Popol Vuh Hero Twins commonly found on Late Classic ceramic vessels (see M. Coe 1978: no. 8; Robicsek and Hales 1981: 94; Coe 1982: 123; Taube 1985; L. Scheie and M. E. Miller 1986: 51). Although both twins wear the Ahau headband, one is marked with large black spots and the other with patches of jaguar pelt. Peter Mathews (cited in Coe 1978: 58, 60) is the first to suggest that the black-spotted figure is Hunahpu, and the individual with jaguar markings, Xbalanque. In the Classic vessel scenes, they frequently assist the Tonsured Maize God, whom I identify as their father. The close association of maize with God CH continues into the Late Post-Classic period. On Madrid page 28d, God CH is merged with God E, the god of corn (Fig. 28e). Thus although the appellative glyph has the Yax prefix and jag- uar skin facial markings of God CH, the figure has the cranial maize foliation of God E, along with a kan sign placed on the forehead. Nonethe- less, the composite deity still retains the jaguar skin markings, which appear as spots around the cheek. Following an earlier identification by Zimmer- mann (1956: 164), Fox and Justeson (1984: 39) 5 Kelly (1976: 65, 67) attributes the God CH designation to Eduard Seler. However, no precise citation is provided, and I have found no mention of God CH in the voluminous work of Seler. Thompson (1972: 32) credits the God CH term to Giinter Zimmermann, and this attribution appears to be correct. 60</page><page sequence="68">Fig. 27 Depictions of Quetzalcoatl in the Codex Dresden and Aztec manuscripts.

Zip, also known as Ek Zip or Uuc (wuc) Yol Zip, is a well-known Yucatec god of the hunt (J. Thomp- son 1970b: 308-309). In support of his association with hunting, the Paris figure wears a deer head- dress and stands before an atl-atl and javelins, but of more interest are the unusual markings around the mouth. A crenated edge filled in with spots, the device is identical to the jaguar pelt "patch" frequently placed around the mouth of the Classic Xbalanque. Certain of the hunters in the Codex Madrid deer pages also seem to display jaguar skin markings about the face (Figs. 28i-j). The text accompanying one of the figures on Madrid page 40b contains the phrase ah ceh uinic, or "deer hunter" (Fig. 28i). But although the Paris and Madrid hunting gods may refer to God CH as Zip, the representation of Uuc Zip on Dresden page 13c in no way resembles God CH.

It is thus likely that there were several forms of Uuc Zip in Post-Classic Yucatan, one in the form of God CH. Pre-Hispanic, ethnohistorical, and contempo- rary Maya lore suggests that Xbalanque was closely identified with hunting. In Classic vessel scenes, the Headband Twins are frequently found shooting down the Principal Bird Deity. Many have noted that this represents the destruction of the monster bird Vucub Caquix as described in the Popol Vuh (Blom 1950; Coe 1978: 58-60; Robicsek and Hales 1981: 147; Stone 1983; Cortez 1986; Taube 1987). In the Popol Vuh, the defeat of Vucub Caquix is not the only episode in which the Hero Twins are portrayed as hunters. The Popol Vuh describes the twins as great blow- gunners who frequently shoot birds in their forest travels (Recinos 1950: 105, 127-128). The Popol Vuh stresses their predilection for hunting in no uncertain terms: "These two [the Hero Twins] did nothing all day long but shoot their blow- guns" (Recinos 1950: 126). Then there is also the episode where Xbalanque and Hunahpu attempt to capture all the wild forest creatures endanger- ing their milpa (Recinos 1950: 131-133). In an important contemporary Mopan version of the Popol Vuh Hero Twins cycle, Lord Kin and Lord Xulab are great hunters who turn their brother, T'up, into a monkey (J. Thompson 1930). The principal hero and avatar of the sun, Lord Kin probably corresponds to the Popol Vuh Hunahpu. Lord Xulab is identified with the morn- ing star and is principally a god of hunting and fishing (J. Thompson 1930: 63). In the myth, Lord Xulab is described as a sort of master of animals: "Lord Xulab is owner of all the animals in the world" (J. Thompson 1930: 124). In the same passage, he is said to be bearded. One of the striking traits of the Classic God CH is that he frequently has a long, flowing beard. In view of descriptions in the contemporary Mopan myth, the Popol Vuh, and pre-Hispanic Maya epigraphy and art, it appears that Xbalanque, also known as God CH, the jaguar pelt Headband Twin, and the personified form of the number nine, was an im- portant god of the hunt. Summary Under the classification of God H, Schellhas conflates two distinct gods sharing a number of overt characteristics. Both are youthful males with portrait glyphs containing cartouches at the back of the head. However, on close inspection, the similarities quickly fade. Thus the infixed ele- ments in the portrait glyphs are quite distinct: in the case of God H, it is usually a form resembling an inverted Ahau; for God CH, it is a cross- hatched device also found in Classic and codical examples of the day Chicchan. God H appears to be closely identified with the paramount Post- Classic god of priests, God D, and gods of water, such as Chac and the Post-Classic form of the Water Lily Serpent. It is possible that the entity appearing as the patron of Mac and the head vari- ant of the number three is the Classic counterpart of God H. The Classic entity is closely identified with the ik sign and may function as a wind god. During the Classic period, the ik sign also appears with the Water Lily Serpent. On Dresden page 4a, God H is compared to Quetzalcoatl, the Mexi- can serpent god of wind. The identification with Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl evokes both the youthful Classic god and the Water Lily Serpent. How- ever, the correlations of God H with Classic gods is still uncertain, and God H remains one of the poorest known of the codical gods. At present, God H cannot be identified securely in the earlier Classic iconography nor with any named god of the Contact period and Colonial texts. In contrast to God H, God CH can be easily identified not only with a Contact period god, but also a major deity of the Classic period. It is clear that God CH is none other than a Yucatec form of Xbalanque, one of the Hero Twins de- scribed in the Quichean Popol Vuh. Scenes in Clas- sic Maya iconography reveal that this figure was fully present during the Classic period, and he frequently appears with his twin brother, Hu- nahpu, and his father, the Tonsured Maize God, the Classic form of Hun Hunahpu. In both Clas- sic text and the Dresden codex, God CH serves as the head variant of the numbers nine and nine- teen. Like the Classic examples of Xbalanque, the codical God CH tends to display patches of jaguar 63</page><page sequence="71">skin upon his body, especially around the mouth. Without the rich Classic imagery pertaining to Xbalanque, it would be extremely difficult to compare the codical God CH to Xbalanque of the early Colonial Quichean Popol Vuh. Codical por- trayals of God CH are sparse and tell little of the significance and complex lore surrounding this di- vinity. A possible exception are the scenes in the Paris and Madrid codices, which seem to depict God CH as a deity of the hunt. A Post-Classic Yucatec identification of God CH with hunting accords well with both the Classic and early Colo- nial forms of Xbalanque. Goddess I In comparison with Gods H and CH, Schell- has' description of Goddess I is more seriously muddled and has been a source of much confu- sion in subsequent studies (Fig. 29). According to Schellhas, Goddess I is an aged and frequently clawed water goddess who wears a serpent as a headdress. Oddly, Schellhas does not provide the appellative glyph corresponding to the goddess described. The suggested glyph, a youthful fe- male head prefixed with the zac white sign, is almost identical to the glyph assigned for God- dess O (see Schellhas 1904: figs. 41, 52). Schellhas (1904: 32) compares the aged deity to other fe- male figures with serpent headdresses, but sug- gests that these women are distinct and lack any direct allusion to water. Although not mentioned by Schellhas, these latter figures are not aged but young (Fig. 29e). The portrait glyph of this young goddess is composed of a main sign with a caban curl usually placed on the temple and the brow (Figs. 29a-c). The sign tends to carry one of two affixes, either the zac prefix or a T102 ci postfix. Zimmermann (1956: 167, pl. 7) labels the youthful entity as Goddess I and places the aged water goddess under the title of Goddess O. J. Eric S. Thompson (1972) generally agrees with this terminology, although he had previously noted that the Schellhas Goddess O and Goddess I seemed to be old and young aspects of the same being (1950: 83). Because it has become widely accepted in the literature, I will follow the same 64 nomenclature. Whereas Goddess I seems to have both youthful and aged aspects, Goddess O is invariably aged and is accompanied by a particu- lar appellative phrase. The young and beautiful aspect of Goddess I has been generally interpreted as the moon god- dess. Seler (1904: 50-52) was the first to suggest that the youthful head of Goddess I represents the moon deity. Due to the work of J. Eric S. Thompson (1939, 1950, 1970b, 1972: 47-48) this interpretation has received wide acceptance and popularity. Thompson (1950: 86) also notes that the Caban curl, an important identifying trait of the portrait glyph, is also present in Landa's alpha- bet. Here it corresponds to the phonetic value u, the Yucatec term for "moon." But although the young Goddess I is widely termed Ix Chel in the literature, there is no evidence that this was actu- ally her name. In fact, it will be seen that the term chel is associated primarily with the aged Goddess O. In the Post-Classic codices and other scenes, there is little explicit evidence for an identification of the young Goddess I with the moon. The only explicit example of the moon goddess in the Post- Classic codices occurs on Dresden page 49, here as one of the gods presiding over the heliacal ap- pearance of Venus as Morning Star (Fig. 30c). In this case, she appears with a lunar crescent project- ing from her back. It is noteworthy that neither the depicted moon goddess nor her appellative glyph appears with the Caban curl u sign. The clearest representations of the young moon goddess are to be found in Late Classic Maya epigraphy and art. However, not every Classic female deity is the moon goddess, and care must be taken in identifying this entity. The most im- portant identifying features are the lunar crescent and the rabbit, a well-known moon symbol (Figs. 3oa-b, d-e). In many Classic examples, the moon goddess also appears with a beaklike ap- pendage projecting out from the upper lip (Figs. 3oa-b, e). Almost invariably, the Classic moon deity is fe- male, but a number of possible male or dually sexed examples do exist (Fig. 31).

In the Initial Series introductory glyph on Copan Stela D, the sign corresponding to the month Ch'en is composed of a human figure accompanied by a moon crescent. Although the figure is somewhat eroded, it ap- pears to be male, with the spiral maize cranial infix found on the Tonsured Maize God (Fig. 31b). On an Early Classic incised conch trumpet, there is a young individual seated upon a phonetic po sign seat (Fig. 3 id). Due to the large U-shaped moon sign placed behind the individual, Michael 67</page><page sequence="75">Coe (1982: 122) tentatively suggests that the fig- ure represents the moon goddess. However, Linda Scheie and Mary Ellen Miller (1986: 309) consider the figure to be male and suggest that he is the Popol Vuh Hero Twin who becomes the moon. That the figure is identified with the moon is undebatable, all the more so because of the po sign seat; in Kekchi, Pokomchi, and Pokoman, po signifies "moon" (Thompson 1970b: 241). The Early Classic conch figure also possesses attributes of the Tonsured Maize God. Thus the elongated head and tuft of brow hair is identical to Early Classic examples of this entity (Fig. 20a). The beaded skirt worn by the conch figure fre- quently appears with individuals dressed as the Tonsured Maize God (see Taube 1985: 174). The same skirt is worn by the moon goddess on an incised vessel in the American Museum of Natu- ral History, New York (Fig. 3ie). There is no doubt that this figure represents the moon; she not only sits in the crescent but also holds a rab- bit. Nonetheless, her profile, facial markings, and coiffure are identical to the Tonsured Maize God. Moreover, there is a specific maize sign placed directly atop the lunar crescent. In contemporary Maya ethnography, the moon and maize are closely associated. Among the high- land Mam, the moon, earth, and maize are known collectively as "Our Mother" (Siegel 1941: 66; Valladares 1957: 196). Then there is the Popol Vuh Xquic, the wife of Hun Hunahpu and the mother of the Hero Twins. Tedlock (1985: 328) considers Xquic to be an aspect of the moon and notes that her name suggests the Quichean term for "moon." As previously mentioned, the Classic form of Hun Hunahpu is the Tonsured Maize God. Laughlin (1977: 245-246) compares Xquic to Thunderbolt Girl, a Tzotzil variant of the "Maize Girl" found widely in southern Meso- america. In part, the identification of the moon with maize may be due to the widespread use of the moon to time the planting of maize and other crops. For example, the Pipil of Izalco, El Salva- dor, plant during the waxing moon (J. Thomp- son 1939: 142). The highland Chorti Maya study the moon to learn the advent of the rainy season (Fought 1972: 387), whereas the Yucatec of Chan Kom plant root crops and fruit trees according to the phases of the moon (Redfield and Villa Rojas 1934: 205). It is intriguing that the Tzeltalan term for the aforementioned month Ch'en is Tzun, or "sowing" (Thompson 1950: 111). However, dur- ing the Late Classic period - the time of Copan Stela D - Ch'en was during July and August, too late for sowing at the onset of the spring rains. During the Post-Classic period, Goddess I is identified with weaving. The T58 zac or "white" prefix frequently accompanying her name glyph may refer to weaving as well as the whiteness of the moon (Figs. 29a, c-d).6 J. Thompson (1972: 47) notes that zac is the root for the Yucatec verb "to weave." In the Codex Madrid, T58 occurs with both young and old representations of God- dess I. The aged aspect of Goddess I is identified as a distinct deity by Schellhas (1904: 38), who terms her Goddess O. The portrait glyph of the aged goddess tends to have a series of short verti- cal lines, aptly interpreted as wrinkles by Schell- has (Fig. 29d). On Madrid page 32b, it can be clearly seen that this convention refers to wrin- kles, as it is placed on the stretched and hanging breasts of Goddess O. The name glyph of the aged deity on Madrid page 105a is identical to that of the youthful Goddess I on Dresden pages 15b and 20b. In the Codex Madrid, the aged God- dess I is often found weaving, and in a number of instances she wears a pair of horn-like elements on her head (Fig. 29I1). Although Seler (1902-23, 4: 738) interprets these elements as insect anten- nae, they are more probably spools of cotton. Similar pairs of cotton spindles are found in the headdress of Tlazolteotl and other Mexican god- desses (Figs. 65b-c). It will be seen that weaving is not unique to Goddess I, but is also a basic feature of Goddess O, the great genetrix. Summary Although often referred to as the moon god- dess Ix Chel, there is little direct evidence that 6 The Huichol also appear to identify the moon with cotton and weaving. Lumholtz (1900: 129-130) describes a Huichol model of the young waxing moon. It is formed of large netted hoop with wads of unspun cotton placed at intervals along the rim. The entire net is termed wi'ta, or "cotton thread." 68</page><page sequence="76">Goddess I was the moon or was named Ix Chel. In the one clear codical representation of the moon goddess on Dresden page 49, the deity lacks both the name glyph and the curling lock of hair of Goddess I. However, it is likely that both the Dresden page 49 example and Goddess I are related to the Classic period moon goddess. In the Post-Classic codices, Goddess I is usually a young woman, although at times, she is also aged. Dur- ing the Classic period, the moon goddess is also young, and frequently appears with a lunar cres- cent, the rabbit, and a beaklike nose piece. In a number of instances, the Classic moon goddess merges with the Tonsured Maize God. The Initial Series introductory glyph corresponding to the month Ch'en appears to be a conflation of the moon goddess with the god of corn. The Classic association of maize with the moon suggests that planting cycles based on phases of the moon could well be pre-Hispanic in origin. God K Schellhas (1904: 32) terms this deity "the god with the ornamented nose, " owing to the strangely irregular form of the long, upturned snout. In the codices and Post-Classic mural paint- ing, this is the principal identifying feature of God K (Fig. 32). Seler (1902-23, 1: 377) inter- prets the accompanying name glyph as a caiman- like creature with fire running out of the eyes (Figs. 32a-b). Although, at first sight, the deity face and name glyph appear to have little in com- mon, Classic epigraphic and iconographic repre- sentations of God K possess a long, upturned snout and the same fire element in the brow re- gion (Figs. 32c, 34a). In Classic depictions, this latter device usually represents a smoking torch or axe blade. During the Post-Classic period, God K lacks the cranial axe and serpent foot of the Classic deity. The earliest examples of the Post-Classic form of God K appear on X Fine Orange vessels from Chiapas and Yucatan. In Yucatan, these ves- sels form part of the Sotuta ceramic complex of Early Post-Classic Chichen Itza. An X Fine Orange vessel from Moxviquil, Chiapas, portrays an important link between the Classic and Post- Classic form of God K (Fig. 33a). Thus, although possessing the lumpy irregular snout of the Post- Classic God K, the figure also displays the smok- ing cranial element of the Classic form. The snout and curling front tooth of this figure are notably similar to representations of God K in the Grolier Codex, a manuscript attributed to Early Post- Classic Chiapas (Fig. 33d). According to J. Eric S. Thompson (1975: 7), the human-like teeth found in the Grolier examples do not appear with other known images of God K. Partly for this reason, Thompson (1975: 7) declared the Grolier a forgery. However, an X Fine Orange vessel attributed to Yaxchilan, Chiapas, portrays a crude but identifiable form of God K with similar an- thropomorphic teeth (Fig. 33b). Images of God K are especially common on X Fine Orange vases of the Sotuta complex of the northern Maya low- lands (Fig. 33c). A detailed study of God K im- ages appearing on Fine Orange pottery could shed much light on the chronological develop- ment of this god during the Terminal Classic and Early Post-Classic periods. In the Terminal Classic art of Yucatan, God K frequently appears with wings; clearly, this al- ludes to the celestial aspect of this diety (Fig. 34). In the recently discovered Xt'elhu bas-reliefs, winged God K figures appear floating in the up- per portions of the scenes (Fig. 34b). Moreover, representations of the winged God K frequently appear in the uppermost portions of architectural settings, that is, in the region corresponding to the sky. Excellent examples appear upon the lin- tels of Sayil Structure 4B1 (Fig. 34a). Winged God K figures are also frequently found on Puuc and Chenes capstones (e.g., Mayer 1983: figs. 11, 12, 24, 50, 51). Although the winged God K is absent in the Post-Classic Maya codices, this concept does con- tinue into the Late Post-Classic period. Thus, in Mural 1 of Tulum Structure 5, two winged God K figures serve as the ends of a sky band (Fig. 34c). Another possible example of a Late Post- Classic winged God K occurs on a stela discov- ered at Flores, Guatemala (Fig. 34d).

Moreover, although long and upturned, the snout lacks the protuberances found with the Post-Classic God K. The Classic period God K is often referred to as Gil of the Palenque Triad, owing to his importance in Palenque texts (Berlin 1963; Kelley 1965). In a number of studies, Coggins (1975; 1979; 1988) states that God K is a god of rain and light- ning, a Maya version of Tlaloc. In support of this interpretation, Coggins (1979: fig. 3-2) illustrates a figure from Copan displaying a syncretic merg- ing of Tlaloc and God K traits (Fig. 72a). Thus, although he possesses the large teeth and goggle eyes of Tlaloc, the figure also has the smoking torch and serpent foot. During the Classic period, the most diagnostic representations of God K are to be found in the form of the Manikin Scepter, an object frequently wielded by rulers on stelae and other monuments. Coggins (1979: 49) sug- gests that the God K Manikin Scepter is the per- sonification of the Mexican atl-atl as the "Light- ning Hurler." However, in a more recent study, Coggins (1988) states that the Manikin Scepter is a lightning axe. This later interpretation is surely correct; in many instances God K is depicted ex- plicitly as a zoomorphic axe (Fig. 35a): each of the four stucco-painted wooden images of God K from Tikal Burial 195 are provided with an axe blade set into a backward sweeping head (Fig. 36a). In profile, the head and axe blade mimic a Classic Maya wooden axe, which is frequently tipped with a backwardly curving element (e.g., Figs. 8, 37e). To reinforce the comparison to a hafted axe, the artisan carefully depicted the fore- head with wood che markings. A Terminal Clas- sic relief from Santa Rosa Xtampak depicts a God K axe with not only the forehead celt but also a large pointed axe blade transfixed through the chest and shoulders (see Proskouriakoff 1950: fig. 94a). An explicit lightning weapon, the burning God K axe is frequently wielded by the Maya god of rain and lightning. From the beginnings of the Classic to the Early Post-Classic period, Chac may be found holding a God K lightning axe. Thus one of the earliest known depictions of God 73 ment depicts a diving anthropomorphic figure flanked by Quetzal birds; the figure is winged and wears a God K headdress quite similar to exam- ples known through the codices. However, be- cause God K only occurs as the headdress and not the actual face, it is unclear whether the figure represents God K or a diving god wearing a God K headdress. According to Schellhas, God K is a star deity, but this interpretation is based primarily on a re- puted association with God C, erroneously identi- fied as the "god of the polar star." Seler (1902-23, I: 377) provides a far more convincing identifica- tion of God K as Ah Bolon Dzacab, equivalent to the Bolon Zacab mentioned by Landa for the year Kan (see Tozzer 1941: 13 9- 141). The identifica- tion of Bolon Dzacab, or "he of the nine genera- tions," as a Post-Classic Yucatec form of God K is widely accepted (e.g., Tozzer 1941: note 673; Thompson 1970b: 227; Kelley 1976: 6, 65, 97; L. Scheie and J. Miller 1983: 12). Eduard Seler (1976: 5) states that as a god of water and fertility, Ah Bolon Dzacab was strongly identified with Chac, the Yucatec coun- terpart of Tlaloc. Although Schellhas (1904: 32) does not recognize the actual symbolic meanings shared between Gods B and K, he notes that they are closely related. As an example, Schellhas (1904: 33) points out Dresden pages 34b and 65a, where God B wears a God K headdress; another instance of Chac wearing a God K headdress may be found in Mural 2 of Tulum Structure 16 (see Miller 1982: pl. 37). Eduard Seler (1902-23, 1: 377) notes that on Madrid page 31b, Chac rides on a serpent with the head of God K; he also mentions Dresden page 25a, where the carried image corresponding to God K of Dresden page 25b is not Bolon Dzacab, but Chac. More re- cently, it has been noted that Classic period 819- day cycle texts are quite like a passage on Dresden pages 30b and 31b, which contains the same verb and a similar reference to the four colors and direc- tions (Berlin and Kelley 1961). However, whereas God K is the subject of the Classic texts, it is God B in the Dresden passage. Images of God K abound in the Classic period; unlike the Post-Classic representations, he almost</page><page sequence="81">Fig. 35 Comparison of the God K scepter with the serpent lightning axe of Tlaloc.

K appears as a burning serpent lightning axe held by Chac (Fig. 35a). In concept, this God K light- ning axe is virtually identical to the smoking ser- pent lightning axe wielded by Tlaloc on Codex Laud page 2 (Fig. 35b). Smoke volutes may be seen pouring out of the serpent snout and blade of the axe. At Chichen Itza, Chac figures are fre- quently found holding burning, serpent-footed axes, clearly an allusion to God K (Fig. 5c). The frequently burning serpent foot of the Classic God K is a fire serpent, in other words, lightning. The mirror constitutes an important, recently discovered attribute of the Classic God K. The four wood figures from Tikal Burial 195 each portray God K holding a large mirror plaque be- fore himself (Fig. 36a). With their pendant ele- ments, these mirror assemblages are almost identi- cal to the tezcacuitlapilli worn on the back of the two-part effigy from Tikal Burial 10 (Fig. 36b). It is now known that the T6i7a element in the brow piece of God K is a shining mirror (see L. Scheie and J. Miller 1983: 9). Linda Scheie and Jeffrey Miller (1983: 9) suggest that the ocote wood torch frequently found in the center of the brow mirror serves as a phonetic marker for the reading of "obsidian mirror," as the words for "obsidian" and "torch" are generally homoph- onous in Mayan languages, usually designated as 75</page><page sequence="83">tah or toh. This dovetails nicely with Tohil, the Quichean god of lightning and storms. Dennis Tedlock (1985: 365) - who considers God K an ancestral form of the Quichean deity - notes that Tohil is an aspect of Hurakan, or "one leg." It has been noted that the Classic God K is essentially one-legged, one leg being human and the other serpentine. Linda Scheie and Jeffrey Miller (1983: 12) inter- pret the elements infixed to the head of God K as phonetic devices, but all may refer to lightning. The smoking celt, the earliest and probably most important form, is an obvious and widespread lightning symbol. Similarly, lightning is also iden- tified with burning torches and fire. Joanne Spero (1987) cites a number of Jacaltec and Tojolabal tales in which lightning becomes stuck in a pine tree, the material from which the fiercely burning ocote is derived. The smoking cigar may also allude to light- ning, in part because the Yucatec Chacs are re- ported to be great smokers. In one recorded tale, lighting the cigar with flint and steel causes thun- der and lightning (Thompson 1970b: 113, 171). The Pedrano Tzotzil closely identify tobacco with lightning. This plant is personified as an anhel, a rain and thunder deity, and it is believed that ground tobacco protects one from lightning (Thompson 1970b: 116). Along with axe blades, torches, and cigars, the forehead mirror also relates to lightning. Because of their bright, flashing quality, mirrors are widely identified with fire and lightning in Meso- america (Taube 1983, 1986, n.d.a). Whereas lem signifies "mirror" in Quiche, Cakchiquel, and Kekchi, the same term in Yucatec, Choi, and Tzeltal means "to shine" or "lightning" (L. Scheie and J. Miller 1983: 13). Yucatec speakers in the region of Chichen Itza and Ignacio Zaragoza have informed me that household mirrors are covered during thunderstorms to prevent Chac from strik- ing the reflective surface. Moreover, in the Early Post-Classic iconography of Tula and Chichen Itza, xiuhcoatl fire or lightning serpents frequently appear on mosaic turquoise and pyrite mirrors. A similar concept occurs in the mural paintings at Santa Rita and Tulum, where God B or God K 76 serpents emerge from mirrors worn at the back of the head (Taube n.d.a). In summary, all of the elements in the head of God K - mirrors, fire, burning axes, torches, and cigars - may allude to lightning. One of the clearest identifications of the Classic God K with lightning and rain is to be found with composite figures possessing attributes of both Chac and God K. On Naranjo Stela 22, ruler Smoking Squirrel wears a large Chac head- dress supplied with the smoking cranial torch of God K (Fig. 37a). Another composite example of Chac and God K appears in the form of Chac with the serpent foot of God K (Figs. 37b-e). A possible Protoclassic example of this being occurs as a beltpiece pendant worn by the lord on Abaj Takelik Stela 1 (Fig. 36b). Worn dangling behind the knees, this particular beltpiece ornament is usually a representation of Chac. Early Classic examples, to name a few, appear on Tikal Stelae 2, 28, 33, 35, Uolantun Stela 1 (Jones and Satterthwaite 1982: figs. 2, 48, 55b, 55d), and Yaxha Stela 4 (Fig. 6d). The Abaj Takelik exam- ple differs in one special way: the foot of this figure ends in a device that could well represent the fanged upturned snout of a serpent. In other words, the figure may bear the serpent foot of God K. Unfortunately, erosion prohibits a precise identification of this crucial area. If this is a God K serpent foot, it could constitute the earliest known example in the Maya region.7 The composite God K-Chac is fairly common in Maya iconography, and it appears that this be- ing functions as a form of Chac. The serpent- footed figure entity occurs on the Early Classic Tikal Stela 1, where he is paired opposite a con- ventional God K. Whereas God K has his charac- teristic cranial axe, the latter seems to have only a 7 Mary Ellen Miller (1986: 61) notes a possible example of a serpent-footed God K on a still earlier monument, Izapa Stela 3. The scene represents a figure brandishing a weapon over the upper portion of a serpent body. However, the leg region of the standing figure is badly eroded, and it is difficult to determine whether the serpent forms part of the human leg or is separate. In the photograph provided by V. Garth Norman (!973: pl- 5)&gt; it appears that the creature is not joined to the leg but rather, constitutes the upper half of a severed snake body. However, this does not necessarily contradict the God K identification, for it is possible that this scene may describe the mythical origin of the God K serpent foot.</page><page sequence="84">Fig. 37 Composite form of God K and Classic Chac.

On the roughly contemporaneous Tikal Stela 2, the figure occupy- ing the same position as the composite god of Stela 1 is an eroded but conventional axe- wielding Classic Chac. Thus, along with the axe, he wears a crenelated Spondylus shell earpiece, has the upturning shell brow element, and holds a snake within his mouth (see Jones and Satter- thwaite 1982: fig. 2). The composite God K-Chac is also found on Xultun Stelae 3 and 10, where he 77</page><page sequence="85">is held in the left arm of the ruler (Fig. 37d). In each case the figure is paired with a small jaguar held in the opposite hand. Xultun Stela 5 portrays an almost identical pairing. However, as in the case of Tikal Stela 2, a Classic Chac, with no evident attribute of God K, constitutes the left arm figure (see von Euw 1978: 23). In view of the substitution of the conventional Chac for the composite entity at Tikal and Xultun, it seems that the Chac and composite God K-Chac figures have similar, if not equiva- lent, meanings. In other words, the composite being functions as a form of Chac. The serpent- footed Chac also appears on a Late Classic vessel, wielding a hafted axe with a burning torch rather than a stone blade (Fig. 37e). His serpent foot penetrates a house marked with Caban curls, quite probably a representation of lightning pene- trating the earth (see Taube 1986). In this scene, the composite entity probably also refers to Chac. In related Classic scenes, Chac serves as the light- ning figure who splits open the earth (e.g., Taube 1986: figs. 3, 4). The identification of Chac with God K may extend into the ethnographic present. In the Tzeltal community of Amatenango del Valle, one aspect of the lightning god tatik cha'uk is San Pedro Martyr, who has a hatchet piercing his head (Nash 1970: 205). Aside from noting the close correspondence be- tween Gods B and K, Schellhas (1904: 32) also suggests an identification of God K with maize. Thus Schellhas mentions that the texts accompa- nying the representations of God K on Dresden pages 12a and 26c contain the God K name glyph followed by that of the maize god, God E. In the Chilam Balam books of Chumayel, Tizimin, and Mani, Bolon Dzacab is created from a bundle of edible seeds (Roys 1933: 99; Craine and Reindorp 1979: 118; Edmonson 1982: 46-47). Similarly, the Tizimin mentions bolon dzacab uah, the prepared tortilla, or more probably tamale, of the god Bolon Dzacab (Edmonson 1982: 62). In Terminal Classic painted Puuc capstones, God K is fre- quently found with tamales (Mayer 1983: figs. 11, !9» 36, 53)- Moreover, Glyph Y of the lunar se- ries and the 819-day count appears to be a tamale supplied with legs and the smoking head of God K; in other words, it is a tamale personified as God K (Taube 1989a). One of the most complex representations of Classic maize iconography, the Temple of the Foliated Cross, has as its principal event the birth of Gil, or God K (Kelley 1965). Along with the Classic God D, God K tends to have the elongated head and "double-domed" coiffure of the Tonsured Maize God. In the previ- ous discussion of God E, it is noted that the Ton- sured Maize God at times wears the smoking headpiece of God K. A recent phonetic reading at Chichen Itza pro- vides strong support for the identification of God K with maize. David Stuart (1987b) notes that at Chichen, the God K appellative is phonetically written as kauil. Stuart further suggests that kauil was a widespread Classic name for God K and cites supportive evidence at Yaxchilan and other sites. Stuart also notes that Kauil was a major deity of protohistoric Yucatan. Thompson (1970b: 289) stresses the close identification of this god with maize and translates Kauil as "Surplus of Our Daily Bread." In view of his direct association with lightning, rain, and maize, it is clear that God K is identified with the fertile forces of life. Linda Scheie (1976: 12) considers the Classic God K as a deity of lineages and royal descent. In this light, the Mani- kin Scepter is interpreted as an "icon of rulership and bloodletting" (L. Scheie and M. E. Miller 1986: 73). The Tablet of the Foliated Cross and its flanking jambs clearly associate God K with bloodletting, as three of the figures hold perfora- tors (Scheie 1976: fig. 10). Moreover, many of the blades or lancets found in Peten caches and burials contain incised representations of God K (e.g., see Trik 1963: fig. 11; Robicsek 1978: fig. 99). Scheie provides strong epigraphic evidence that God K is closely identified with the acquisi- tion of royal power. Thus the "Ahau in hand" and "God K in hand" glyphs usually denote the presentation of God K in dynastic scenes, fre- quently at the time of heir designation or acces- sion (Scheie 1982: 62-63, 118, 169). In support of Scheie, I should mention that the head of God K is frequently capped with the smoking Ahau, a sign designating male parentage in Classic texts. 78</page><page sequence="86">K pertains directly to elite power and dynastic descent. A deity identified with lightning, rain, and fertile maize, God K epitomizes the vital, en- gendering force from which life comes. God L Schellhas (1904: 34) notes that the primary attri- butes of God L are agedness and black body color- ation. Another important trait mentioned by Schellhas is the bird worn on the head of God L on Dresden page 14c (Fig. 38b). It was subse- quently demonstrated that this creature is the Moan screech owl, a bird closely identified with rain as well as the underworld (see J. Thompson 1950: 114-115). In the case of this Dresden scene and many Classic period representations, the Moan owl actually rests in a large-brimmed hat topped with broad, spotted feathers, undoubtedly those of the same bird (Figs. 38b-c; 39a-c; 40c, e; 4ia-b; 42a-b; 43a-d). According to Schellhas (1904: 35), God L is found in neither the Paris nor Madrid codices. In fact, he does appear on Paris page 21 and Madrid page 32a. God L is not a major deity of the Late Post-Classic period; in- stead, the vast majority of known God L represen- tations appear in earlier Classic scenes. Schellhas (1904: 35) states that the limited scenes of God L in the Codex Dresden provide no obvious clues to the identity of this divinity. However, Schellhas does point to Dresden page 46b, on which God L appears as a warrior sup- plied with spear-thrower and shield. Due to the important analysis of the Venus pages by Seler (1904c), it is known that God L is here portrayed as one of the Venus gods. The text establishes that he is responsible for spearing God K, who lies directly below the God L scene. During the Classic period, God L also appears with weapons or staffs, but with no clear Venus associations. Although Gunter Zimmermann (1956: 164- 165) views God L as a benevolent deity, Michael Coe (1973: 14; 1978: 16) identifies him as one of the principal lords of the underworld. One of the most striking images of his underworld office oc- curs on the Princeton Vase: God L sits in a 79 With the abundant epigraphic evidence found on Classic monuments, it is clear that God K is iden- tified with lineage and bloodletting. Michael Coe (1973: 16; 1981: 163; 1982: 47; cited in Robicsek 1978: 104-106; Carlson 1981: 125-126; L. Scheie and J. Miller 1983: 9) notes a striking series of correspondences between God K and the Aztec Tezcatlipoca: each is identified with rulership and royal descent, frequently displays a smoking mirror upon his head, and has a serpent foot. However, although there are many paral- lels, the two deities are also distinct in a number of important ways. Thus God K is decidedly a scaly reptilian figure, whereas Tezcatlipoca is iden- tified with the jaguar. Recent epigraphic work by Houston and Stuart (1989: 8) indicates that the serpent was considered as the uay, or co-essence, of God K. However, the co-essence of Tezcatli- poca was clearly the jaguar (Nicholson 1971 : 412). Moreover, whereas God K is strongly identi- fied with agriculture and maize, these traits are weakly displayed by Tezcatlipoca. Although Tezcatlipoca and God K are perhaps cognate in a general sense, there is not a direct one-to-one cor- respondence between the deities. Summary One of the more important gods of the Maya pantheon, God K is a complex figure with a broad range of iconographic and epigraphic asso- ciations. Many of these associations appear to re- volve around one of his most basic meanings, that of a celestial lightning god. In the Classic period, God K often appears as a lightning axe wielded by Chac, another major god of rain and lightning. The burning torch, smoking celt, ci- gar, and mirror inset into the forehead of God K are all recognized lightning symbols in contempo- rary Maya lore. In addition, the burning serpent foot is probably yet another allusion to lightning, for fire serpents are a widespread symbol of thun- derbolts in ancient and contemporary Mesoamer- ica. Along with his lightning and agricultural asso- ciations, God K was an important god of Classic Maya lineage and rulership. Although it has been little pursued, the agricultural dimension of God</page><page sequence="87">Fig. 38 God L and the Moan Owl.

In several Terminal Clas- sic examples from Yucatan, the staff appears to be an early form of the chicahuaztli rattle staff of Post-Classic Mesoamerica (Fig. 41). Along with the netted cylindrical bundle, staffs are one of the diagnostic attributes of merchants. In many scenes of the Post-Classic Borgia group of Mexi- can codices, merchants commonly appear with both the staff and the bundle, which may even be topped with a bird (Fig. 40a). It is clear that in the Classic period, God L is frequently portrayed as a merchant lord. The ambivalent, dual nature of God L - the deadly underworld and fertile riches - is also char- acterized by the Moan bird frequently appearing in his headdress. Schellhas (1904: 41) notes that the Moan is frequently depicted with the Cimi death sign. But although a messenger or avatar of the underworld, the Moan owl is also identified with maize and rain. Thus in the Classic and Post-Classic periods, the God L Moan bird is fre- quently accompanied with the kan sign or maize foliation (Figs. 38b, 42a-b, 43b). J. Eric S. Thompson (1950: 115) notes that in Yucatec, moan signifies "cloudy" or "drizzle." Because the Moan bird is frequently accompanied with a coef- ficient of thirteen, Seler (1902-23, 4: 615) sug- gests that it represents the thirteen layers of clouds composing the heavens. Thompson (1950: 115) considers the Moan to be closely related to Chac, as on Dresden page 38c, God B sits upon the head of the Moan. An even more striking scene occurs on Madrid page 73b, on which God B and the Moan are depicted in a cave, sinkhole, or well. Holding an ink pot and quill, God B is depicted painting the black tail feathers of the Moan (Fig. 38d). The identification of the Moan with Chac is also present in the Classic period; for example, there are scenes of the Classic Chac wearing a crest of spotted Moan feathers (Fig. 38e). The convention of Chac appearing with Moan feathers seems to have continued into Post- Classic times. Thus in the Codex Dresden, the long, spotted element rising out above the ear of Chac is probably a Moan feather (Fig. 6a). 81 curtain-swathed palace topped with jaguars and gleefully observes a rite of human decapitation (Fig. 39c). In another vessel scene, God L sits with a bundle on a jaguar throne as he presides over six subsidiary deities (Fig. 39b). This scene appears to be an event near the beginning of time, because it is associated with the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumku, the Long Count base of the present great cycle (Coe 1973: 108). In Classic scenes, God L has a large, squared eye, jaguar characteristics, and frequently appears smoking a cigar. He is a complex deity having both mortuary and life-giving attributes. Thus al- though a god of nether regions, he is also identi- fied with water, agricultural fertility, and riches. At times, God L appears with a wrapped bun- dle, evidently a form of the sacred bundle found over much of ancient Mesoamerica. On the afore- mentioned 4 Ahau 8 Cumku vessel (Fig. 39b), the cloth is marked with a glyphic compound identi- cal to that occasionally carried by the Classic Hero Twins and the Tonsured Maize God (see Taube 1985: fig. 7). The bundle compound is composed of a Spotted Kan main sign prefixed by Landa's i and ca. David Stuart (1987b) suggests that the Spotted Kan is read tzi. Both Stross (1988) and I (Taube 1989a: 42) have noted inde- pendently that this compound is to be read icatz(i), a term meaning bundle or burden in Tzeltalan languages. In many instances, God L appears with an- other form of bundle, here covered with a net- work of ropes. In this case, the bundle represents the carrying packs of Mesoamerican merchants, not ceremonial bundles (Figs. 40, 41b). At times, this merchant bundle is accompanied by a quet- zal or another long-feathered bird, suggesting that it contains feathers or other rare commodi- ties (Figs. 40c-d). A pyrite mirror discovered in a tomb at Uayma, Yucatan, represents God L and another figure with the merchant bundle, here evidently topped by a bird (Fig. 40b). Al- though Raymond Thompson (1962: 244) does not identify the principal figure as God L, he notes that the scene appears to depict a pair of merchants or merchant gods with a cargo of pre- cious plumes.</page><page sequence="89">Fig. 39 Classic portrayals of God L.

(a) God L with early form of chicahuaztli rattle staff; note God K carried on back; carving upon cylin- drical column, possibly from Santa Rosa Xtam- pak (drawn after rubbing courtesy of Merle Greene Robinson) (b) God L with chicahuaztli staff standing upon mer- chant bundle, bas-relief in Hopelchen reportedly from Dzehkatun (drawn after photograph cour- tesy of Flora Clancy). Both God L and the Moan are identified with the powers of rain and lightning. For one, the black coloring of God L may allude to rain. Con- temporary Maya peoples identify dark smoke as rain clouds, and the Lacandon collect the sabac or black soot from copal smoke for its use in the rain ritual or as black paint. The Lacandon god of rain is Mensabac (maker of sabac) (Tozzer 1907: 71). In the Codex Dresden, the sign of God L is a portrait glyph prefixed with an imix sign from which fall black beaded elements (Fig. 38a). These streams of beads, beginning with large dots that gradually diminish as they fall, are identical to the patterning frequently found in the Dresden codex and on Classic period Moan feathers. A representation of a water lily flower, the imix sign is a well-known water symbol, and it is probable that the black dots represent falling water or rain. It is possible that during the Late Classic period God L was identified with the western Maya area, a moist region of great produce and trade. Some of the most elaborate monumental representations 84</page><page sequence="92">of God L derive from the western Maya region of Palenque. In the Cross Group, he not only ap- pears in the Tablet of the Sun, but also as one of the jambs in the Temple of the Cross (Fig. 42b). In addition, a youthful figure wearing a God L headdress appears on a fragmentary tripartite scene panel displaying the Palenque emblem glyph (see Mayer 1989: pl. 75). The figure is backed by a tree sprouting cacao pods from the trunk (Fig. 42a). The deep soils of the western Maya area are well suited for cacao. For example, the region of Comalcalco, Tabasco, is still an im- portant cacao-producing region today. God L appears not only in the western Maya region but in southern Veracruz as well. God L is one of the few Maya gods appearing in the Clas- sic art of the Gulf coast. On one molded vessel from the Rio Blanco region of southern Veracruz, he appears as an aged man with a walking stick. However, his most striking attribute is the broad headdress topped by the bird head (Fig. 42c). In form and concept, the headdress is entirely compa- rable to the Moan bird headdress of God L. A figure wearing a markedly similar broad head- dress appears on Cerro de las Mesas Monument 2 (Fig. 42d). In this case, the bird displays a thick and curved owl-like beak. Like the Rio Blanco vessel figure, this figure probably represents a form of God L. It has been noted that the Moan bird appearing in the Classic Maya God L headdress is frequently accompanied by a sky sign. I suspect that to- gether, these two elements may have served as an epithet of God L. In Cholan - the language of the western Maya lowlands - the word for sky is chart. The Moan Owl and sky sign may spell out the term moan chart, or "misty sky." This immedi- ately brings to mind the legendary Nahuatl place of Tamoanchan. Michael Coe (1984: 62) notes that tamoanchan is actually a Mayan phrase signify- ing "Land of Rain and Mist." A number of re- searchers have placed Tamoanchan in the Gulf Coast region of Veracruz (e.g., Coe 1984: 62; Davies 1977: 105; Delhalle and Luykx 1986: 121). 8 A merchant god identified with rain and mist, the Classic God L may have been specifically identi- fied with the western Maya region and neighbor- ing Veracruz. One of the most striking and revealing appear- ances of God L derives not from the Maya region or the Gulf Coast but from still farther west, from the site of Cacaxtla, Puebla. During excava- tions in 1984, a series of murals were discovered in El Templo Rojo, flanking a staircase. One of the scenes depicts an individual impersonating God L (Santana Sandoval et al. 1990; John Carl- son, personal communication, 1990). Along with wearing a God L mask and shoulder cape, the Cacaxtla figure also displays a jaguar headdress, along with a jaguar skin kilt, boots, and mittens (see Santana Sandoval et al. 1990: figs. 3, 4). In addition, he wields a walking staff and merchant bundle, with packages containing feathers and other goods. The broad-brimmed Moan bird hat of God L is affixed to the side of the bundle. However, in this instance, the Moan bird is partly serpentine, with a snake-like snout and teeth. In many Mayan languages, the term chan refers to snake as well as sky. Quite probably, the serpent traits are substituting for the conventional sky sign of God L, here again to refer to moan chan. It is widely recognized that the Olmeca-Xicalanca inhabitants of Cacaxtla had close ties to the west- ern Maya region (e.g., Foncerrada de Molina 1980: 184). The Cacaxtla depiction of God L could well refer to the verdant western Maya area of Chiapas and Tabasco, the probable realm of Tamoanchan. In one vessel scene, a regal-looking rabbit holds a truncated form of a serpent staff before a nude and craven God L (Fig. 43b). Also in the rabbit's outstretched paw is the Moan bird headdress with a large necklace falling in two beaded streams. This scene is part of a poorly understood Classic myth concerning the theft of the regalia of God L. The rabbit, along with the Classic moon goddess, plays an important part in this event (Figs. 43c-d). 8 The upper portion of Borgia page 21 provides support for the identification of Tamoanchan with eastern Mexico. In the scene, the Red Tezcatlipoca appears as a merchant facing a prominent cleft tree, a conventional sign for Tamoanchan (e.g., Codex Borbonicus page 15). 85</page><page sequence="93">Fig. 42 Depictions of God L from the western Maya region and the neighboring Gulf Coast.

A Late Classic vessel scene represents the feathered Moan Owl head- dress of God L between God D and the moon goddess, who is provided with a crescent moon; an anthropomorphized rabbit stands nearby (Fig. 43 d). A Late Classic tripod bowl represents another scene of the God L headdress episode. Attributed to northern Belize, the vessel depicts a female fig- ure holding the feathered hat of God L before a male. The woman is clearly the Moon Goddess for she appears with both the crescent and a rabbit in the crook of her arm (Fig. 43 c). Eroded versions of the same scene also appear on the encircling rim (see Joyce 1927: 103). Hellmuth (1986: 280-281) notes that a Post-Classic form of this episode oc- curs on Dresden page 43 c, although here the princi- pal protagonist is not the rabbit but Chac, who carries the merchant bundle and Moan bird head- dress of God L in his canoe (Fig. 43 a). It has been noted that on Dresden page 46, God L appears as a god of the morning star. In view of the combined presence of the Moon Goddess and God L, it may be that the theft of the God L regalia was an epi- sode of cosmic importance. Summary God L is an aged black god with close ties to the underworld. This identification is reflected in two of his animal avatars, the jaguar and the Moan Owl, both creatures of caves and the night. In the Codex Dresden, God L also appears as one of the malevolent Venus Gods who appear at dawn after the disappearance of Venus into the underworld during inferior conjuction. However, God L was not simply a deity of death and de- struction. Instead, he is frequently depicted with riches, and often appears with a merchant bundle and a staff or spear. The Moan Owl and sky sign headdress may serve an an epithet of God L, here read moan chart, or "misty sky." God L may have been specifically identified with the verdant re- gion of the western Maya area and neighboring Veracruz. It has been suggested that the Nahuatl region of Tamoanchan may correspond to the southern Gulf Coast area, an important region of cacao and trade. It is clear that during the Classic period, God L was considered a merchant lord and should be regarded as a form of merchant god. His obviously regal status suggests that, like the Post-Classic Maya of Yucatan, the Classic Maya saw no contradiction between rulership and mercantilism. The many Classic scenes of the moon goddess taking the regalia of God L reveals that there was a complex body of mythic lore surrounding this being, most of which remains poorly known. God M Due to his long, Pinocchio-like nose, God M is one of the most easily recognized gods of the Post-Classic codices (Fig. 44). Schellhas (1904: 35) notes that God M appears but rarely in the Codex Dresden, but is frequently depicted in the Codex Madrid. In addition to the exaggerated nose, God M is usually black with a long, pendulous lower lip accentuated with red. The name glyph of this deity is an eye within a U-shaped element that recalls the device frequently encircling the eye of the god (Fig. 44a). The eye ornamentation resem- bles a broken circle with the two ends curling out at the back of the eye, like the eye piece of a hook-and-eye fastener. In short, God M is a strange and strikingly ugly entity, entirely alien to the canons of Maya beauty. In fact, it appears that he is a foreign deity, probably derived from Yacatecuhtli, the Central Mexican god of mer- chants. Schellhas (1904: 35-36) suggests that God M corresponds to the Contact period Ek Chuah, the Post-Classic Yucatec merchant god. In the Ma- drid codex, God M appears frequently with a car- rying pack and a spear. Schellhas (1904: 36) inter- prets the military aspect of God M as a reflection of the dangerous life of the merchant, who fre- quently must repel attacks while traveling in for- eign territories. As implied by the name, which contains the term for black (ek), Ek Chuah is a black god. He seems to be closely identified with cacao, because in the month of Muan, the owners of cacao groves performed a special festival in 88</page><page sequence="96">Fig. 44 The Post-Classic God M.

In view of the value of cacao, it is not surprising that the god of merchants was associ- ated with this esteemed commodity. In fact, ca- cao beans were an important form of currency not only in Yucatan but over much of Post- Classic Mesoamerica. But rather than being sim- ply a cacao god, Ek Chuah was a deity presiding over all traveling ventures. Landa (in Tozzer 1941: 107) notes that during a journey, one would 89</page><page sequence="97">offer incense at night to Ek Chuah to ensure a safe return. The same traits of militarism, cacao, and night fire ceremonies are to be found with the Yacatecuhtli merchant complex of Central Mex- ico. Although he is not black, Yacatecuhtli has the same elongated nose found on God M. To the Aztec, merchants were considered as front-line warriors or vanguards of the army. One particu- lar type, the naoaloztomeca, were disguised mer- chants, who penetrated enemy territory as spies (Sahagun 1950-71, bk. 9: 21-25). Before a jour- ney, Aztec merchants made a night offering of bloodied paper and copal to Yacatecuhtli and other gods (Sahagun 1950-71, bk. 9: 9-11). Upon their return, the merchants were offered a special drink of cacao (Sahagun 1950-71, bk. 9: 27-28). The complex ritual lore surrounding merchants was not limited to particular cultures or political boundaries. Instead, it was a symbolic language, a sort of "ritual pidgin" that could be readily shared among many differing groups engaged in trade. Precisely where the long-nosed merchant god originated is unknown, but it probably does not derive from the Maya region. Although decidedly ugly anthropomorphic gods do exist for the Classic period, representa- tions of the long, pointed merchant nose are vir- tually absent. A possible exception is the Chama vase. Following Seler (1904b), Michael Coe (1973: 13; 1978: no. 9) interprets the group of individuals with fans as a meeting of merchants. Coe states that one of the figures, depicted with black body paint and a somewhat long bulbous nose, is Ek Chuah. However, all of the figures have features exaggerated to the point of gro- tesque caricature. For example, although not black, the figure in front of the suggested Ek Chuah has an almost identical profile. The long-nosed Yacatecuhtli or Ek Chuah fig- ures generally do not appear in the Maya region until the Post-Classic period. Among the earliest examples are the stone masquettes excavated at an Early Post-Classic tomb at Chipal, Guatemala (see Kidder and Samayoa Chinchilla 1959: pl. 89). With the Post-Classic advent of metal working, representations of the long-nosed merchant god frequently appear on rings, pendants, and other metal jewelry (see Bray 1977: 15, 12, figs. 3, 7). An excellent depiction of God M occurs on an embossed gold disk from the sacred cenote at Chichen Itza (Fig. 45a). Rendered in the style of Santa Rita, Belize, the disk depicts God M with a tumpline, long beard, and the broken eye loop (see Coggins and Shane 1984: pl. 137). One scene in the famous murals of Santa Rita depicts God M three times: as a figure playing music, as a pen- dant occurring on the same individual, and fi- nally, as a severed head carried by another figure (Fig. 45b). At Mayapan, God M is frequently de- picted on ceramic incensarios, often with a long flowing beard (see Smith 1971: figs. 32I1; 68b, no. 9)- Michael Coe (1973: 14) notes that Gods L and M appear to be closely related entities. Because of the shared black body coloration, God M, God L, and black Chacs have frequently been confused. On Madrid pages 79a to 84, there is such a com- plex merging of God L with God M that it is difficult to keep them apart. Cyrus Thomas (1888: 358) identifies God L as Ek Chuah, the black merchant god. Thomas may not be far off the mark, God L was in large part the Classic Maya counterpart of God M. It appears that as God M became of increasing importance in the Maya region, he supplanted God L and in doing so, acquired some of his particular characteristics. Thus, although not a characteristic of Yacate- cuhtli, God M is often black, the conventional color of God L. Moreover, unlike Yacatecuhtli, God M is often found with aged, chapfallen fea- tures. In the Codex Madrid, God M frequently has a snaggle-toothed mouth (e.g., Madrid pages 52a, 53a), quite like the mouth of God L, God D, and other aged gods in the codex. At Mayapan, there is an excellent example of God M repre- sented as an aged black god; here the snaggle- toothed mouth is rendered in the round (Fig. 44e). Along with agedness and black body color- ation, the Post-Classic God M displays another physical aspect of God L: a face with jaguar attri- butes. Thus, on the aforementioned gold disk in 90</page><page sequence="98">Fig. 45 Depictions of God M rendered in Santa Rita style.

In the previously mentioned mural scene at Santa Rita, the full fig- ure God M also appears to have jaguar ears and spots around the mouth (Fig. 45b). The spotted mouth is also found with both Classic and Post- Classic representations of God L, and probably refers to jaguar markings (Figs. 38b, 39b, 40e). Summary Aside from physical attributes, Gods M and L have much in common. As a merchant deity, the symbolic domain of God M frequently overlaps with that of God L. It has been noted that the Classic God L is depicted with staffs and mer- chant bundles topped with long-tailed birds in Classic vessel scenes. The simple staff and cylin- drical bundle clearly represent the walking staff and goods of the traveling Pre-Columbian mer- chant. Tobacco, an important attribute of God L, is also associated with merchants. For example, Aztec merchants received tobacco as well as cacao on their return to Tenochtitlan (Sahagun 1950- 71, bk. 9: 28). Moreover, during the feast of the merchants, tobacco was ceremoniously offered to the Aztec lords (Sahagun 1950-71, bk. 9: 34). Like God L, God M is also identified with the Moan Owl. It will be recalled that the cacao cere- mony held in the honor of Ek Chuah and other gods was performed during the month of Moan. Moreover, the Moan on Dresden page 43 c bears the unmistakable eye marking of God M (Fig. 43 a). It is noteworthy that none of these four attributes (the black coloration, agedness, the jag- uar, and moan owl) appears in the Yacatecuhtli complex of Central Mexico. Instead, they seem to derive from the earlier God L, who served as a Classic Maya merchant god. God N Although God N is one of the major gods of the ancient Maya, his role and identity has been the source of much confusion and debate (Fig. 46). Since the pioneering work of Forstemann (1901: 189-192) and Schellhas (1904: 37, 38), it has been generally thought that God N was the god of the five-day Uayeb period. In a discussion of the Classic numeral five head variant, J. Eric S. Thompson (1950: 133-134) states that this aged face represents God N as the Mam, god of the Uayeb, and that the contemporary Kekchi and Pokomchi regard the Mam as an aged and power- ful earth deity. Thompson also notes a parallel to the Yucatec worhip of the Uayeb Mam in contem- porary Kekchi Easter ceremonies, where an im- age of Mam is buried during an "unlucky" five- day period. In a later recantation, Thompson (1970a: 473) states that God N was not the ma- levolent god of the dying year but rather the quadripartite Bacab supporting the heavens: "it is abundantly clear that Mam, the dressed up piece of wood with his five day rule and contemptuous end, had nothing in common with the four Bacabs." Michael Coe's phonetic reading (1973: 15) leaves no doubt that Pauahtun was the principal epithet of God N. Coe notes that the conven- tional name glyph of God N appears with a pho- netic pa superfix and a main sign composed of phonetic tun allographs (Fig. 46a). Together, these elements give the reading patun, quite simi- lar to the term pauahtun. However, I (Taube 1989a) have recently noted that the glyphic com- pound often contains a phonetic uah ( wah ), provid- ing a complete reading of pauahtun. The uah de- vice is a globular element appearing in the center of the pa superfix. This is a representation of the maize tamale, read uah in the Classic and Post- Classic Maya script (Taube 1989a). Post-Classic examples of God N often wear this maize device in their headdresses, and frequently the element sprouts maize foliage (Figs. 46b-c, e). The Pauahtuns mentioned in Landa's description of the Yucatec new year ceremonies are equated to the Bacabs and the Xib Chacs, all oriented to the four directions with their appropriate color (see Tozzer 1941: 137). Landa may actually be correct; the terms Bacab and Mam are probably aspects or simply epithets of Pauahtun. In both Classic and Post-Classic Maya iconogra- phy, God N is strongly quadripartite. Classic ves- 92</page><page sequence="100">Fig. 46 The Post-Classic God N.

At Late Post-Classic Maya- pan, Structure H-17 contained four sculptures of God N wearing a tortoise carapace (D. E. Thomp- son 1955: 282). Paris page 22 depicts four God N figures seated upon a sky band. Similarly, the upper "sky" register of a round column from Structure 6E1 at Chichen Itza contains four God N figures interspersed with star signs (see Proskouriakoff 1970: fig. 15). The remains of four God N figures can also be discerned in the uppermost register of Jaina Stela 1 (see Proskouria- koff 1950: fig. 45c). According to Landa (in Tozzer 1941: 135), the Bacabs support the sky. However, the only pre- Hispanic deity who assumes such a role is God N, named phonetically as Pauahtun. Whereas J. Eric S. Thompson views God N as the Bacab sky bearer, Michael Coe (1973, 1978) considers him to be the supporter of the earth, not the heavens. Coe interprets God N as a preeminently under- world god. But although God N does possess strong cthonic attributes, he is also closely identi- fied with the heavens. In Maya iconography, God N frequently appears as a denizen of the sky. The celestial scenes on Paris page 22 and at Chichen Itza have been mentioned, and there are many others. I know of no explicit example of God N sustaining the earth, and in a number of instances, he clearly holds up the sky. Thus, on a Late Clas- sic vessel, a pair of aged Pauahtun figures serve as the supporters of a sky band throne (Fig. 47a). The Pauahtun figures on Temples 11 and 22 at Copan are interpreted as sky bearers (L. Scheie and M. E. Miller 1986: 122). According to Scheie and Miller (ibid.), the Bacabs are simply young aspects of the Pauahtuns. Although I agree that both the Bacabs and Pauah- tuns are sky bearers, I see little reason for distin- guishing them by age. Instead, I suspect that Bacab is but a variant epithet for Pauahtun. Rather than making a sharp distinction between earth and sky bearers, it may be more appropriate to con- sider the Pauahtuns as sustainers of the world. This would be entirely in accord with contempo- rary Tzotzil belief. Among the Zinacantecos, there are the vasak men who, as the gods of the four corners, hold up the earth and apparently the sky as well (Vogt 1976: 15-16). Similarly, the Cha- mula earth bearers are supporters of the "universe" (Gossen 1974: 22). At San Andres Larrainzar, there are the Cuch Uinahel Balumil, or "sky-earth bear- ers" (Holland 1963: 92). At Early Post-Classic Chichen Itza, God N of- ten appears wearing a cut shell pendant and hang- ing crosshatched belt elements (Fig. 46f). This form of God N costume has been previously rec- ognized only at Chichen Itza. However, God N also appears wearing the shell pendant and hang- ing belt pieces on Yaxcopoil Stela 2 (Fig. 46g). In this Terminal Classic scene, God N supports a band of twisted serpents that probably refer to the sky; in Yucatec, ca'an is "sky" and can, serpent. In the North Colonnade at Chichen Itza, there is a group of fragmentary cylindrical columns bearing representations of four God N figures in the upper and lower registers (Fig. 48a). Each of the figures stands in the world-bearer posture while rising out of a cleft zoomorphic head. Quite similar split zoomorphic heads appear on a Terminal Classic vessel from Seibal, here marked with explicit cauac signs (Fig. 48b). The Chichen and Seibal examples are probably examples of the frequently cleft-headed Cauac Monster, an entity that David Stuart (1987b: 17-18) identifies as a mountain. Quite likely, the Chichen registers de- pict god N oriented to the four cosmic mountains of the Maya world. The identification of God N with mountains also occurs at the Classic site of Copan. On the sculptured doorway of Temple 22 and the hiero- glyphic bench from the House of the Bacabs there are seated God N figures marked with Cauac signs. In both cases, God N appears holding up the serpent sky. Like the Chichen columns, God N is here rendered as a personified mountain sup- porting the sky. The role of God N as a sacred mountain was probably widespread in the Classic Maya region. It will be subsequently noted that the contemporary form of God N, the Mam, is widely identified with mountains in the Maya re- gion and Veracruz. Many of the God N figures at Chichen wear a 94</page><page sequence="102">Fig. 47 Classic representations of God N.

Detail of in- cised vessel, Seibal (redrawn after Sabloff 1970: fig. 48). large spider web upon the back (Fig. 46f). God N spider figures also appear in Classic Maya iconog- raphy. The earliest known example occurs on a Tepeu 1 polychrome vessel depicting God N hold- ing the sun in one hand and the moon in the other (Fig. 47b). In another Late Classic scene, God N lies on his back in a spider web while holding a filament strand in each hand (Fig. 47c). In the aforementioned scene on Paris page 22, the celes- tial God N figures sit among twisted cords, quite possibly an allusion to spider thread. In Post- Classic Central Mexico, the spider was an impor- tant symbol of the tzitzimime, sky bearers who descended at eclipses and calendrical period end- ings to menace the world (Thompson 1934). Ac- cording to J. Eric S. Thompson (1934), God N is a Maya version of the tzitzimitl. Many of the overt characteristics of God N have been widely noted, such as his aged bearing, costume, and frequent appearance in conch or tor- toise shells, but there has been little interest in the relation of this deity to the natural world. It is becoming increasingly evident that the agricul- tural cycle was of great importance in Classic Maya religion, and deities of maize, rain, and lightning are commonplace. God N is frequently found with Chac in Classic Maya scenes. An ex- ample is the aforementioned Early Classic vessel depicting Chac with the God K lightning axe (Fig. 35a). This scene is actually placed on the conch worn by God N, who appears on the oppo- site side of the vessel (see M. Coe 1982: no. 33). One Late Classic vase represents a veritable orgy of music and drink, with four God N figures being accompanied by young women and four Chacs within a cave (M. Coe 1978: vase 11). The identification of God N with Chac continues in the Post-Classic period. On Dresden page 41b there are two separate scenes of God N and Chac, each deity surrounded by beads of water, proba- bly rain. In the texts immediately above, both are described as pauahtun chac. On Dresden page 37a, 96</page><page sequence="104">God N stands in rain as he holds an axe, the characteristic lightning weapon of Chac. The association of God N with Chac is entirely consistent with contemporary Maya conceptions of the Mam. J. Eric S. Thompson (1930) notes that in the village of San Antonio, Belize, the Mams are merged with the Chacs and the gods of wind. They are four in number, and their domain is the mountains and the underworld: "The Mams are gods of the mountains, of the plains, of the underground, of thunder and lightning, and, by extension, of the rain" (Thompson 1930: 57). The contemporary Choi also consider the aged lak mam as lightning, or chajk (Cruz Guzman, Josserand, and Hopkins 1986). However, the sons of lak mam are stronger, and, whereas these youths frequently throw lightning, lak mam is best known for his thunder (Cruz Guzman, Josserand, and Hopkins n.d.: 42). Both the San Antonio Maya and the Chiapas Choi consider the principal Mam to be extremely old, and this belief is also found with the Kekchi, in the intermediate region of Alta Verapaz. In one Kekchi tale, the thunder god is extremely old and lives in thirteen green hills; his harsh bellowing is thunder (Gordon 191 5: 108). Erwin Dieseldorff (1926) posits that the Kekchi have two distinct sets of gods in complementary opposition, one being the Tzultacaj, the young gods of lightning, and the other, the aged Mam. The Kekchi Mam is essentially malevolent and dangerous, and the thundering at the onset of the rains is thought to be Mam trying to escape his bonds in the under- world. E. Michael Mendelson (1959) makes a similar case for the Tzutuhil of Santiago Atitlan. In this case, the young benevolent god of rain and lightning is San Martin, and the aged god is known as Mam or Maximon. As with the Kekchi, the Maximon Mam idol is worshiped for five days of Holy Week. This widespread concept of young and old gods of lightning and thunder may be pre-Hispanic. Whereas Chac is the young axe-wielding god of lightning, the Pauahtun Mam is an aged thunder deity. But although the Chacs and Pauahtuns may thematically overlap, there is no evidence that they are simply young and old aspects of the same god. The Pauahtuns, rather than the Chacs, are inevitably depicted as the world bearers. The Huastec Maya of Veracruz also have a widespread belief in the Mamlab, aged and ma- levolent gods of thunder. Guy Stresser-Pean (1952) states that there are actually two forms of Mamlab, young and robust forms and old, degen- erate types known as Ocel. Janis Alcorn (1984: 58-59) mentions that in the Huastec community of Teenek Tsabal, the principal Mam is Muxi', who undergoes a process of aging over the solar year: Muxi' miraculously becomes a newborn baby at the beginning of the year when the sun once again "moves" away from the South. During the year he ages and by year's end he is an old man as the sun reaches the winter solstice. According to Stresser-Pean (1952), the Mamlab greatly love dance, drink, and music and have great parties in mountain caves with their female frog consorts. Even when floating down rivers as spent Ocel, they drum upon the bloated stomachs of drowned beasts. Stresser-Pean records that the Mamlab are the souls of ancestors drowned in the last creation. This is quite similar to the descrip- tion by Alcorn (1984: 57) of four drowned men who support the earth; as they age and break, they are replaced by another four at the new year. These drowned men eventually go to the eastern realm of Muxi'. Among the neighboring Sierra Totonac, there is a similar aged thunder god known as San Juan, or Aktsini'. Like the Huastec Mam, he is an aged god associated with moun- tains, thunder, and drowned humans. Moreover, he is the most important of the four thunder gods who support the world (Ichon 1973: 45, 123, 130, 137). Michael Coe (personal communication, 1984) notes that Kaminaljuyu Stela 17 appears to be a Late Preclassic rendering of God N (Fig. 49a). An old bearded man bent over his serpentine walking stick, the figure wears the diagnostic rolled cloth headdress of God N. In addition, the rear part of the headdress contains a bulbous netted element resembling the "spangled turban" frequently found at the base of Classic God N headdresses (e.g., Coe 1973: nos. 17, 70). Although I know of 97</page><page sequence="105">Fig. 49 The aged Mam, comparison of stone sculp- ture from Guatemala and the Gulf Coast.

A detail from a cylindri- cal bas-relief column, the scene represents an aged male holding a staff. With his wrapped-cloth head- dress, he is almost identical to Classic Maya repre- sentations of God N (Fig. 49b). The El Tajin figure seems to be an early form of an important genre of Post-Classic Huastec sculpture - an aged male leaning over his walking 98</page><page sequence="106">stick (Figs. 49c-d). Stresser-Pean (1971 : 596) iden- tifies this common sculptural type as the Mam, "the old god of the earth and of thunder, lord of the year, ancestor of the Huastec." In strong sup- port of this interpretation, one example has a wrin- kled face of Tlaloc, the Central Mexican god of rain and lightning (Fig. 49d). A recent account of the chief Huastec Mam could serve as a vivid de- scription of the pre-Hispanic sculptures: "Muxi' is generally thought of as a dangerous, powerful old man bent over his walking stick of ak' " (Alcorn 1984: 59). The stick held by the pre-Hispanic Mam figures can either be a simple shaft or a serpent. The latter variety probably alludes to a thunderbolt; it has been frequently noted in this study that the snake is a widespread symbol of lightning in Mesoamerica. Although somewhat eroded, it is quite possible that the undulating staff carried by the Kaminaljuyu figure is also a serpent. Summary The cited ethnographic material from Veracruz is strikingly similar to contemporary and ancient lore of the Maya region. In both areas, there is an old and often malevolent mountain god, a quadripartite supporter of the world identified with thunder, music, drunkenness, and the old year. The Huastec even call him Mam, the same name used for the deity in Guatemala, Belize, and Yucatan. This god appears to be of considerable antiquity and can be found on the Late Preclassic Stela 17 of Kaminaljuyu. Representations of Pauahtun are frequent in Classic Maya iconogra- phy, and in many scenes he is found in the sky or serves as a sky bearer. The tortoise shell and conch commonly worn by this being may refer to the association of this god with thunder, since both the conch and tortoise carapace are used as instruments to imitate the sound of thunder. Like the tzitzimime of Post-Classic Central Mexico, God N is not only a world supporter but also a malevolent god that threatens the world at particu- lar calendrical and celestial events. The Post- Classic Pauahtun seems to have differed little from the Classic god, and it appears that forms of this deity are still being worshiped in both the Maya region and Veracruz. Goddess O As I have mentioned in the discussion of God- dess I, this deity corresponds to the Goddess O described by Gunter Zimmermann (1956: pl. 7). Along with being aged, she is, in the Codex Dresden, frequently depicted with a red body. Moreover, her name is usually given with the T109 chac prefix, signifying "red" or "great" in Yucatec (Figs. 50a-c). The entire name glyph of Goddess I tends to be written as T109. 145:612, the two latter glyphs be- ing the h and I of the Landa alphabet. Pronounced in Spanish, these letters are read hache and ele. In addition, Landa also glosses T612 as le (see Tozzer 1941: 169-170). Yuri Knorozov (1958: 471, no. 27, and 475) reads the entire compound as chac ch'el(e). However, there is no indication that the second word is globalized. Thus Kelly (1976: 69) suggests that the name is to be read chac chel, not- ing that in the Ritual of the Bacabs there is mention of a Chacal Ix Chel and a Zacal Ix Chel (see Roys l9^S- 53)- Michael Coe (1977: 329) notes that the old creator couple of the sixteenth-century Pokoman were Xchel and Xtamna, clear cognates of the Yucatec Ix Chel and Itzamna. The phonetic reading of the Goddess O name glyph strongly suggests that this aged goddess is Ix Chel, just as Seler (1904a: 50) originally suggested. In Yucatec, the term chel or cheel signifies rain- bow (Barrera Vasquez 1980: 89). Although in popular Western thought, rainbows are consid- ered beautiful and auspicious, contemporary Yucatec regard them with a certain dread: The rainbow (chel) is spoken of as "the flatulence of the demons" (u ciz cizinob), because it is thought to arise out of dry wells (x-lah-chen) , and these are, as it were, the ani of Metnal. From these wells the rainbow spreads across the sky. (Redfield and Villa Rojas 1934: 206) In the Maya region, caves are commonly consid- ered to be sources of sickness, and among the Yucatec, the rainbow also seems to be identified with disease. Thus two chants from the Colonial 99</page><page sequence="107">Fig. 50 The Post-Classic Goddess O, the aged genetrix; note serpent headdress in d, e, and g.

This phrase recalls the name of Goddess O, Chac Chel, and in fact, Chacal Ix Chel is another name mentioned in the Ritual of the Bacabs (Roys 1965: 146). However, in the Colonial Yucatec San Francisco dictionary, cheel also signifies "termino, por fin" (Barrera Vasquez 1980: 89). Thus the name Chac Chel could also be glossed as "great (chac) end." Both meanings of rainbow and termination are consis- tent with Goddess O, for she appears to be a goddess of the flood and world destruction. Far from a kindly old grandmother, Goddess O is of fearful aspect. She frequently appears clawed and fanged and wears a skirt marked with crossed bones and other death symbols (Figs. 5oe, 51b- d). In one Late Classic vessel scene she is por- trayed as part jaguar, and bears a jaguar ear as well as the spotted Ix eye (Fig. 51c). This repre- sentation compares closely with the depiction of the Goddess O on Dresden page 67a (Fig. 5 id). In the Dresden scene, the goddess also has promi- nent claws and the jaguar eye commonly found on the day sign Ix. The crossed-bone skirt worn by the Late Classic Goddess O is also found with Post-Classic examples, such as on Dresden page 74 (Fig. 5oe). The same crossed-bone skirt is worn by a probable skeletalized version of God- dess O at Early Post-Classic Chichen Itza (Fig. 51b). This example appears with God N as a sup- porting Atlantean figure in the bas-relief columns of the Lower Temple of the Jaguars. She also occurs in non-skeletalized form with God N in the upper columns of the Temple of the Warriors (see Seler 1902-23, 5: 296-297, 300-301). It will be recalled that God N seems to be in part a Maya version of the Central Mexican tzitzimitl sky bearer, and a similar argument could be made for the aged female at Chichen. In Central Mexico, the tzitzimitl was often represented as a female deity. Moreover, it will be seen that Goddess O was identified with spiders, perhaps the most im- portant animal aspect of the Aztec tzitzimitl. During the Post-Classic period, Goddess O was clearly identified with storms and floods. Per- haps for this reason, in the Dresden and Madrid codices, she often wears a serpent headdress. In the Late Post-Classic murals of Tulum Structure 16, she wears the serpent headdress and holds an- other serpent in her hands (Fig. 51a). The signifi- cance of the snake headdress in unknown, but it may be partly due to the strong association of Goddess O with storms and water. In view of the name, Chac Chel, it is not surprising that God- dess O is closely identified with Chac, the preemi- nent god of lightning and rain. On Madrid page 30b, God B sits at the left foot of Goddess O, who stands with streams of blue water pouring from her loins and breasts (Fig. 50g). On Dresden page 42b, Goddess O and God B are engaged in an amorous interlude. Although badly eroded, a scene on Madrid page 61c may depict the same event. In the codices, Goddess O frequently pours water from an inverted jar (e.g., Figs. 5od- f, 5 id). The most complex of these scenes is on Dresden page 74, where she appears with God L or more probably, a black God B amidst great streams of outpouring water (Fig. 5oe). This page has long been interpreted as the deluge, the de- struction of the world by flood (e.g., Schellhas 1904: 31; Forstemann 1906: 266; J. Thompson 1972: 99). As in the ancient mythology of high- land Mexico, the flood figures prominently in the Colonial Yucatec Chilam Balam books of Chu- mayel (Roys 1933: 99-100), Mani (Soils Acala 1949: 230-233), and Tizimin (Edmonson 1982: 40-41, 45-48). It is likely that the scenes of God- dess O with the outpouring vase depict her as an extremely powerful world destroyer. Goddess O is identified with the forces of cre- ation as well as destruction. She appears to be the great genetrix and is closely identified with divina- tion, medicine, childbirth, and weaving. Accord- ing to Hernandez, Ix Chel is the mother of the goddess Ix Chebel Yax (Saville 1921: 214). Landa (in Tozzer 1941: 129) mentions that Ix Chel was the goddess of birthing: "For their child-births they had recourse to the sorceresses, who made them believe their lies, and put under their beds an idol of a goddess called Ix Chel whom they said was the goddess of making children." Dur- ing the month of Zip, the Yucatec priests opened their sacred bundles in honor of Ix Chel, who is 101</page><page sequence="109">Fig. 51 Classic and Post-Classic representations of Goddess O.

Among the contemporary Sierra Popoluca of Veracruz, the spider of the east weaves the navel of the infant (Ichon 1973: 74, 173-174). During the creation of the fetus, the spider is the assistant to grandmother Natsi'itni, the creator goddess whom Ichon (1973: 122) com- pares to Toci-Tlazolteotl of Post-Classic Mexico. Toci, the aged aspect of Tlazolteotl, was the su- preme genetrix of the Aztec pantheon, a deity identified with world creation as well as destruc- tion. Sahagun (1950-71, bk. 1: 15) describes her as the goddess of diviners, midwives, and curers. Like the spider, Toci was also identified with weaving. During the festival of Ochpaniztli, an impersonator of Toci spun and wove maguey fi- ber (Duran 1971 : 232). In her roles and attributes Goddess O compares closely to Toci-Tlazolteotl, a deity identified with creation and curing as well as spiders and divination. On Dresden page 42a, Goddess O sits upon a pyramidal structure holding a mirror bowl con- taining the face of God C (Fig. 52a). Although somewhat effaced, the compound chel appears as the second glyph in the accompanying text. With the circular mirror, the figure recalls highland Mexican stone monuments depicting female fig- ures holding disks to their abdomens (Figs. 52b- c). Both the illustrated examples wear zoomor- phic headdresses, which, in a recent study, I iden- tify as the head of the War Serpent (Taube n.d.b). I also argue that the disks represent mirrors, possi- bly allusions to tlalxicco, or the World Navel. A Contact period version of the female figure ap- pears in the Selden Roll, here as a personified place name (Fig. 52d). The central disk contains a bird, perhaps an allusion to the birds commonly used in divination and augury. The Selden Roll figure bears a headdress com- posed of two serpents - one with cloud markings and the other with flints - that cascade down ei- ther side of her swollen mountain body. The ser- pent headdress recalls not only Goddess O, but also a goddess appearing at Terminal Classic Bilbao. On Monument 21, an ancient woman, wearing the serpent headdress and seated upon a throne, receives sacrificial offerings (Fig. 52e). The same aged and wrinkled figure appears in the 103 described by Landa as "the goddess of medicine" (Tozzer 1941: 154). It is probable that Goddess O represents the aged female curer and diviner. In Mesoamerica, aged women frequently serve as midwives and curers. Tozzer (1941: note 598) cites two Colonial accounts describing the presence of aged female curers among the Yucatec Maya. As a goddess of creation, divination, and cur- ing, Ix Chel was also closely identified with the spider. Landa (Tozzer 1941: 154) states that along with small representations of Ix Chel, the Yucatec curers had ritual bundles containing stones used in divinatory sortilege. These stones were called am, the Yucatec word for spider. In the Ritual of the Bacabs there is an incantation in which the am spider is addressed: "four days were you beneath the garden plot. The cochineal of your grand- mother, the virgin Ix Chel, Chacal Ix Chel, Sacal Ix Chel is the symbol of the back of the green spider of wood, the green spider of stone" (Roys *965: 53). This passage not only identifies Ix Chel with spiders but also describes her as an aged grandmother, or chich. Brinton (1895: 40) sug- gests that Ix Kanleom, or "lady spider web" is the same as Ix Chel. According to Cogolludo, the Yucatec goddess of weaving was Ix Azal Uoh; with little justification, J. Eric S. Thompson (!939- 132) emends this term to Ix Zacal Nok. However, the original transcription may well be correct, as the root uoh seems to signify "taran- tula." Common Yucatec terms for this creature are chiuoh and cohuoh (Barrera Vasquez 1980: 340), which could be roughly paraphrased as "fanged uoh ." Moreover, in the Ritual of the Bacabs, the genetrix of asthma is described as a biting uoh: "Who is his mother? The uoh in the sky, the uoh in the clouds. The biter in the sky, the biter in the clouds" (Roys 1965: 23). Although not an orb weaver, the tarantula does produce silk. In view of her identification with spiders, it is not surpris- ing that Goddess O is often found weaving or with spools of cotton in her headdress (Figs. 50g, 51a). In many parts of Mesoamerica and especially the American Southwest, the spider is identified with weaving, childbirth, divination, creation,</page><page sequence="111">Fig. 52 Comparison of Goddess O with other god- desses of ancient Mesoamerica.

God Q In my brief discussion of God F, I mentioned that Schellhas confused three distinct deities under the rubric of God F. One of the deities, God A', has already been described with God A. J. Eric S. Thompson (1950: 131) termed the other two di- vinities Gods Q and R. The primary identifying element of God Q is the curving band passing down his forehead to the back of his cheek (Fig. 53). This band can appear either as a solid line or a series of dots; dotted lines frequently appear on the body as well. The facial band also appears in the name glyph of God Q, which is usually pre- fixed with a coefficient of ten (Figs. 53a-d). In the Dresden and Madrid codices, this coefficient of two vertical bars is frequently topped with a single dot, suggesting that the coefficient is to be read eleven rather than ten. However, Thompson (1950: 131) points out that the dot does not allude to the number one, but rather to a death sign - a disembodied eyeball. Thus in the Codex Madrid, the element is often clearly rendered as an eye. Moreover, in the Madrid and Paris codices, the prefixed coefficient of ten can appear without the dot (Fig. 53d). In terms of the attributes and associations of God Q, the coefficient of ten is entirely apt. It will be recalled that for the Classic period, the skeletal death deity God A was the personified head variant for the numeral ten. In the Codex Dresden, the numeral ten is identified with an- other death-related god. On Dresden page 47, the Venus God 10 Sky, or Lahun Chan, is ren- dered much like a skeletalized Chac, with a bone jaw and prominent fleshless ribs. It is possible that the association of the number ten with death is phonetic in origin. Whereas the Yucatec word for ten is lahun, lah signifies "fin o cabo" (Barrera Vasquez 1980: 430). Thus the skeletal death head and bone jaw may refer to comple- tion, or lah. Schellhas (1904: 27) is the first to note the wide- 105 upper portion of Bilbao Monument 8 (see Par- sons 1969: pl. 33a). In both cases, her bound- serpent headdress is virtually identical to that worn by Goddess O. According to J. Eric S. Thompson (1950: 83), Goddess O may be equiva- lent to the aged Aztec goddess Cihuacoatl, also known as Quilaztli and Ilamatecuhtli. Thompson notes that the term Cihuacoatl signifies "Serpent Woman," and thus recalls the serpent headdress of Goddess O. In the Florentine Codex, Cihua- coatl is described as a tecuani, a Nahuatl term signi- fying a stinging or devouring beast (Sahagun 1 950_7 bk. 1: 11). This term recalls not only the serpent headdress of Goddess O, but her clawed hands and feet, which are those of a fierce beast, as well. Moreover, the tzitzimime were also considered as devouring beasts. Summary Goddess O is a powerful, aged woman identi- fied with not only birth and creation but death and probably world destruction as well. In the codices, she is usually referred to as chel or chac chel, a term signifying "rainbow" or "end" in Yucatec. It is probable that this old goddess, rather than Goddess I, corresponds to the Ix Chel of ethnohistoric literature. During both the Late Classic and Post-Classic periods, Goddess O ap- pears with feline attributes, most notably, the Ix jaguar eye and clawed hands and feet. Like God N, Goddess O may be a Maya version of the Post-Classic Central Mexican tzitzimitl sky bear- ers, fierce demons that threaten the world at cer- tain calendrical and celestial events. Goddess O commonly wears a twisted-serpent headdress, and clear analogues can be seen in other regions of Mesoamerica. J. Eric S. Thompson (1950) sug- gests that Goddess O may be equivalent to the Central Mexican Cihuacoatl. The Selden Roll and Bilbao figures support Thompson's comparison, although these images also suggest that the con- cept of an aged goddess with a serpent headdress is fairly widespread and is by no means limited to only the Yucatec Maya and the Valley of Mexico. Among the Maya, this goddess is associated with weaving, curing, and divination and thus shares</page><page sequence="113">Fig. 53 The Post-Classic God Q.

This facial feature is a diagnostic element of the Classic Zapotec Xipe, and Alfonso Caso and Ignacio Ber- nal (1952: 249-257) have pointed out many exam- ples on Classic ceramic urns. It is possible that in the form of Caso's Glyph P, this deity can be traced back to the Monte Alban 1, and the Forma- tive beginnings of Zapotec writing (Caso and Ber- nal 1952: 249). An excellent Early Classic repre- sentation of Xipe was discovered upon a mural fragment in the Zacuala compound at Teotihua- can (Fig. 54b). The face is clearly dead, with shut eyes and pulled back lips. A similar Early Classic example was excavated in Burial 10 at Tikal (Fig. 54c). This figure is rendered in pure Teotihuacan style and, like the Zacuala example, the lips are widely open to expose the teeth. It is possible that this curious treatment of the mouth may allude to the tightly fitting mask of flayed human skin. When worn, the lips of flayed Xipe masks stretched widely around the mouth of the imper- sonator (see Pasztory 1983: pl. 199, 267, 298). Claude Baudez (1985: 204, 210) notes a possible Classic Maya representation of Xipe on Copan Stela 3 (Fig. 55a). The figure appears twice on the monument, in both instances with a vertical band crossing the shut eye and crosshatching over the center of the face. According to Baudez, this en- tity is a Classic form of God Q. Baudez also men- tions that the human hand over the jaw region of one of the faces probably refers to death, because the sign of completion or zero is a human face with a hand-covered jaw (Figs. 55e-f). The hand-covered jaw appears at Palenque on a shield containing an explicitly flayed human face. This shield can be found on the Palace Tablet and the Tablet of the Slaves with an eccentric flint, possibly a form of the "flint-shield" war expres- sion discussed by Houston (1983). Although these shields clearly depict flayed human faces, they are curiously spotted in the region of the mouth (Figs. 55b-c). Another example occurs on a sculpted stucco fragment discovered in the Palace (see Scheie and Mathews 1979: no. 71). In this case the spots near the mouth clearly resemble the print of an outstretched hand. This is confirmed 107 spread association of God Q with God A in the Codex Madrid. A clear example occurs on Ma- drid pages 84c to 88c (Fig. 53g). Whereas the god appearing on 84c is God Q, the two following scenes represent composites of Gods A and Q, with the final scenes on pages 87c and 88c being the death god, God A. On Madrid page 63c, God A appears with the appellative glyph of God Q, and in many scenes Gods A and Q appear to- gether. Thus J. Eric S. Thompson (1950: 131) notes that on Madrid page 76, Gods A and Q flank a slain victim in the region corresponding to the north. In accord with his close association with God A, God Q frequently exhibits elements of death and sacrifice. Thus God Q often appears with death eyes, the death collar, and a knotted headband of cloth or paper (e.g., Fig. 53e). This knotted headband is the same device Peter Joralemon (1974) has described for Classic scenes of sacrificial bloodletting. In the Codex Madrid, God Q is frequently shown in the guise of an executioner. The sacrifi- cial scene on Madrid page 76 has already been described. In the aforementioned passage occur- ring on Madrid pages 84c to 88c, Gods A and Q hold flint weapons in their hands (Fig. 53g). Moreover, on Madrid pages 50a, 54c, and 84a, God Q is shown attacking and slaying the black merchant deity, God M (Fig. 53h). On Madrid pages 50a and 54c, this violent event occurs on a road, and it appears that in these scenes, God Q embodies the dangers faced by merchants on their travels. It is possible that the facial patterning as well as the acts and accouterments of God Q refer to death and sacrifice. In the Post-Classic codices, the curving line passing through the face of God Q can either be solid black or dotted. The same lines tend to be found crossing the body in the form of diagonal bands. In the Codex Madrid, identical body markings frequently appear with God A. Schellhas (1904: 25) notes that the curv- ing line on the face of God Q resembles the facial line of the Late Post-Classic Xipe Totec (Fig. 54a). From at least as early as the Early Classic pe- riod, Xipe Totec, "our lord the flayed one," is</page><page sequence="115">Fig. 54 Classic and Post-Classic representations of the flayed god, Xipe Totec.

Coe 1967: 102). by an epigraphic form of the face shield from the Sarcophagus Lid, which shows the spots to be the print of a hand stretched across the face (Fig. 55d). A human face shield with a hand over the mouth also occurs on Tonina Monument 91, here in a form of the flint-shield expression (see Becquelin and Baudez 1982: fig. 130). This sign and the other images from Copan and Palenque reveal that the occurrence of the human hand over the mouth of a flayed human face is quite widespread during the Late Classic period. Also displaying the hand over the mouth, the personi- fied variant of zero may be a Classic Maya form of Xipe Totec. In a number of instances, the zero head variant seems to be wearing a mask, possi- bly of flayed human skin (Fig. 55e). Although there seems to have been a form of flayed god among the Classic Maya, it is not cer- tain that this entity is identical to God Q. In the subsequent discussion of Central Mexican gods, it will be seen that, although Xipe Totec figures are relatively common in Late Post-Classic Yucatan, they do not display the facial markings of God Q. 108</page><page sequence="116">Fig. 55 Flayed figures and the head variant of zero in Classic Maya epigraphy and art.

It is possible that the curving facial band of God Q does not refer to human skin, but to stone. Rendered in either lines, solid bands, or strings of dots, the banding is almost identical to Classic and Post-Classic Maya depictions of stone. Late Classic flint blades are frequently de- picted with similar markings (Fig. 56a). The T528 tun or cauac sign for stone is usually supplied with a band and a parallel series of dots. It is possible that this beaded banding refers to hard, stone-like materials. Thus this same marking also appears on the day sign Eb, signifying "tooth" in a num- ber of highland Maya languages. Post-Classic and early Colonial versions of this sign exhibit a facial patterning almost identical to God Q, save that the curving line and dots terminate in a point as they pass down the cheek (Fig. 56b). Although the Edznab marking is a more common means of delineating flint, stone blades are often marked with bands in the Codex Madrid (e.g., Figs. 53g- h). On Madrid pages 50a and 54c, God Q wields both a stone blade and a T528 stone sign in the other hand (Fig. 53h). An important variant of God Q occurs on Ma- drid page 60c (Fig. 56d). Although the figure is somewhat eroded, it can be seen that he holds a T528 stone sign in his hand and the "stacked bow tie" paper device on his head; the accompanying text explicitly labels him God Q. On close inspec- tion, it can be seen that the binding covers the eye region as well as the forehead. The Madrid figure is very similar to the Venus God appearing on Dresden page 50 (Fig. 56e). An aspect of Venus as the morning star, the Dresden example has the same stacked bow tie blindfold across the eyes, and in addition, he displays the diagonal dotted-band body markings found on Dresden representations of God Q. Seler (1963, 2: 251), J. Thompson (1942: 50; 1950: 220), and Reise (1982) identify this figure as a Maya form of Tezcatlipoca-Itzlacoliuhqui-Ixquimilli, the Cen- tral Mexican god of stone, cold, and castigation, who usually wears the same knotted device across no his eyes. In a later work, J. Eric S. Thompson (1972: 69) points out that the Dresden figure ap- pears to wear a pair of heron feathers. This heron feather bunch, known as aztaxelli in Nahuatl, fre- quently occurs with the Central Mexican god (e.g., Fig. 56f). Seler (1963; 2: 251) points out yet another striking feature shared between the Dres- den figure and the Central Mexican god: the red- tipped, hafted flint point projecting out of the top of the Dresden headdress (Fig. 56e). The Mexican god Tezcatlipoca-Itzlacoliuhqui-Ixquimilli is of- ten found with a stone-tipped dart piercing his headdress (Figs. 56g-h). The Dresden figure is almost surely a Maya form of the Mexican deity. Although T ezcatlipoca-Itzlacoliuhqui-Ixquimil- li frequently appears with the horizontal facial banding of Tezcatlipoca, in many instances, his facial marking is formed by vertical curving bands passing from the brow down across the cheek; in other words, the patterning is quite similar to that of God Q (Figs. 56f-h). Seler (1902-03: 261-262) suggests that this patterning refers to the banding found on such stones as "chert, flint, or ribbon agate." The Central Mexican Codex Cospi pro- vides support for this identification. On the lower portion of Cospi page 12, corresponding to the north, Tezcatlipoca-Itzlacoliuhqui-Ixquimilli stands on jagged stones with similar patterning (Fig. 56c). As a personification of stone, this deity was closely identified with castigation and execu- tion. For the Aztec, stoning was the form of pun- ishment for adultery (Seler 1902-03: 262). The same custom was present among the protohistoric Yucatec Maya. Landa (in Tozzer 1941: 124) notes that stoning was the usual means of executing male adulterers. As a god of stone, God Q may have been identified not only with sacrifice but also with execution, the meting out of punish- ment to guilty individuals. Summary God Q is a god of violent death and execution characterized by a curving band of solid or dotted lines passing from the brow to the cheek. The same banded pattern usually appears on the limbs of the god as well. Baudez has suggested that a</page><page sequence="118">Fig. 56 Stone markings, God Q, and the Central Mexican blindfolded god of stone and castigation.

An important clue to the identity of God R may lie in the coefficient frequently prefixed to the portrait glyph (Figs. 57a-b). Composed of a dot and two bars, the coefficient is clearly eleven, or buluc in Yucatec. The Classic period head vari- ant of the numeral eleven possesses the same fa- cial curl found with God R and for this reason, J. Eric S. Thompson (1950: 135) tentatively sug- gests that the numerical head variant is the Classic antecedent of the codical deity. In view of the shared facial patterning and association with the number eleven, this is a likely identification (Fig. 58a). However, Classic representations of God R are not limited to the numeral eleven head vari- ant. Thompson (1961: 14) mentions a probable Late Classic example on the well-known bloodlet- ting scene on the Huehuetenango Vase (Fig. 58b). Engaged in the act of phallus perforation, the youthful figure displays a prominent Caban curl on the cheek. This figure wears the Ahau cloth headband conventionally appearing with the Headband Twins - Classic forms of Hunahpu and Xba- lanque. Indeed, Hunahpu appears on the same vase, also wearing the Ahau headband. It is possi- ble that God R is an aspect of Hunahpu. A Late Classic codex style vessel depicts a pair of youth- ful figures, one with Caban curl markings and the other with an Ahau headband and a jaguar ear (Fig. 58c). The latter youth is probably Xbalanque, who frequently appears with jaguar attributes and the Ahau headband. It is thus pos- sible that the accompanying figure is Hunahpu, although here with Caban curls and other black markings substituting for the conventional black spots of Hunahpu. The Caban curls and black spots at times have similar if not identical mean- ings. The vessel figure has not only two Caban curls upon his body, but also a third before his face. In another Late Classic codex-style scene, Hunahpu appears with a similar Caban curl in front of the face but with spots upon his body (Fig. 58d). Classic epigraphy provides the clearest exam- ples of the Caban marking substituting for the Classic form of God Q appears on Copan Stela 3. Although this is a distinct possibility, the only cer- tain representations of this god are limited to the Post-Classic codices. Quite frequently, a stacked series of paper knots appears on the brow of God Q. On Madrid page 60c and Dresden page 50, this knotted device actually covers the eyes of the fig- ures. These two examples are probably Maya forms of the Central Mexican god of stone and execution, T ezcatlipoca-Itzlacoliuhqui-Ixquimilli. A personification of the stone of castigation and sacrifice, the face of the Central Mexican deity is often marked by vertical curving lines. The face of God Q is similarly marked, and these curved mark- ings commonly denote stone in pre-Hispanic Maya epigraphy and art. In the Codex Madrid, God Q commonly wields flint blades and the T528 sign for stone. Just as God Q appears with north on Madrid page 76, Tezcatlipoca-Itzlacoliuhqui- Ixquimilli is identified with the north in the Cen- tral Mexican codices (e.g., Cospi page 12, Borgia page 50, Fejervary-Mayer page 33). The facial markings and attributes of God Q do indeed point to a Central Mexican derivation. However, rather than being a Maya version of Xipe Totec, God Q may well derive from the Central Mexican god of stone and execution. God R The diagnostic mark of God R and his appella- tive glyph is a single prominent Caban curl that passes from the brow to the lower cheek (Fig. 57). Present in the day signs Caban and Cib, the Caban curl is the Maya sign for earth. For this reason J. Eric S. Thompson (1950: 131) considers God R to be the deity of the earth and maize. Thompson (1950: 135) also notes that in the Co- dex Madrid, the same curl appears not only with the portrait glyph of God R, but occasionally with the maize deity, God E, as well. In the Co- dex Madrid, the God R appellative is frequently prefixed by the same bead element found in the glyph of God H (Figs. 57b-c).

A personified variant of the Tikal emblem glyph features an Ahau head displaying both the headband and the facial spot. However, a Caban curl can appear in place of the Ahau spot (Fig. 59a). Moreover, the Caban curl also appears in conventional examples of the Tiooo Ahau sign, here with clear ahau phonetic complements (Figs. 59b-c). The use of the Caban curl for the Ahau sign facial marking is widespread during the Late Classic period and appears at Chichen Itza, in the northern Maya lowlands, as well as in the central Peten.

Summary Although appearing both in Classic and Post- Classic iconography, God R is a relatively rare and poorly understood god. During both the Clas- sic and Post-Classic periods he is identified with the numeral eleven, and in Classic epigraphy serves as the head variant of this numeral. His most striking attribute is the Caban curl marking, which appears on his face and body. It has been noted that these same markings can substitute for the black spots of the spotted Headband Twin, the Classic form of Hunahpu. However, although conventional forms of spotted Headband Twin do appear in the Codex Dresden, it remains to be seen whether God R is actually an aspect of this being. GodS Although the use of the Caban curl in the facial marking of the Ahau Headband Twin suggests that the codical God R may be a version of Hunahpu, God R would not be the only form of Hunahpu in the Post-Classic codices. In an unpub- lished compilation of Maya god iconography and epigraphy circulated in 1985, Linda Scheie notes the Post-Classic presence of the spotted Hunahpu on Dresden pages 2a, 3a, and 50a. The spotted figures on pages 2a and 50a are both accompanied by a portrait glyph featuring a spot on the cheek and a cartouche at the back of the head ringed with black circular tabs (Figs. 6od, e). In both cases the appellative is prefixed by the coefficient of 1. This appellative is virtually identical to the Classic name glyph of the spotted Headband Twin, who evidently was known as hurt ahau, or 1 Ahau (Figs. 6oa-c). In Classic Maya script, the spotted Headband Twin commonly appears as the personified form of the Ahau day sign (see Thompson 1950: 17-28, 36, fig. 11). Although Linda Scheie is surely correct in the identification of the spotted Headband Twin on Dresden pages 2a and 50a, the figure cited for page 3 a is clearly Xbalanque, or God CH, with a portrait glyph prefixed with the numeral one (Fig. 28b). However, a somewhat eroded repre- sentation of the spotted Headband Twin does ap- pear in the upper left corner of the same scene. Like the example from page 2a, this figure is bound and decapitated. Thus, on page 3a, both Hero Twins are represented in a single scene. Along with depicting Xbalanque and Hu- 115</page><page sequence="123">Fig. 60 Classic and Post-Classic examples of the appel- lative phrase 1 Hunahpu, the pre-Hispanic name of Hunahpu.

God E also appears with the spotted Headband Twin in the other two cited scenes, Dresden pages 2a and 50. The appear- ance of Hunahpu with the maize god is consistent with Classic Maya imagery pertaining to the Popol Vuh. In the discussion of God E, I noted that the Tonsured Maize God was the Classic ver- sion of Hun Hunahpu, the father of Hunahpu and Xbalanque (see Taube 1985). In the three Dresden scenes, the spotted Head- band Twin has clear connotations of death and sacrifice. Thus, he is decapitated on Dresden pages 2a and 3a, whereas on page 50a, he wears a skull headdress. Moreover, the spots found on the figure are undoubtedly the "death spots" found on God A, God A', and other death fig- ures. According to Landa, Hunhau, or 1 Ahau, was the preeminent lord of the underworld: "They maintained that there was in this place [Metnal] a devil, the prince of all the devils, whom all obeyed, and they call him in their lan- guage Hunhau" (Tozzer 1941: 132). In the Colo- nial Yucatec Ritual of the Bacabs, Uaxac Yol Kauil and Ix Hun Ahau are mentioned at the entrance to the underworld (Roys 1965: 9). J. Eric S. Thompson (1950: 299-300) notes that in the Chilam Balam books, the day 1 Ahau is identified with putrescence and the underworld. In both the Dresden codex and the ethnohistori- cal accounts, the 1 Ahau character is strongly iden- tified with sacrifice, death, and the underworld. These connotations are also known for the Classic period prototype, the spotted Headband Twin. 116</page><page sequence="124">Fig. 6 1 A Classic variant of the spotted Ahau Head- band Twin. (a) Ahau face with markings around mouth and eyes, Tablet of the 96 Glyphs, Palenque (b) Early Classic example with death crest (redrawn after Mayer 1984: pl. 27) Jeff Kowalski (1989) notes that the ball appearing on the Late Classic La Esperanza ball-court marker contains the incised head of Hunahpu, the spotted Headband Twin. This Classic scene re- calls the Popol Vuh episode in which Hunahpu literally loses his head during the ball game (Recinos 1950: 150-153). On Dresden pages 2a and 3 a, the decapitated spotted twin is repre- sented as a bound captive. This theme also ap- pears in Classic Maya iconography. Thus, on the side of Tikal Altar 10, the spotted Headband Twin appears as a hapless captive (see Jones and Satterthwaite 1982: fig. 34b). In a Tepeu 1 vessel scene, the spotted Headband Twin appears in an- other captive pose, here trampled by the Jaguar God of the Underworld (see M. Coe 1982: 33). Although the figure on Dresden page 50 is named 1 Ahau, he lacks the typical facial mark- ings found for the Classic spotted Headband Twin. Thus rather than having a single spot upon the cheek, this figure has markings ringing his eye and mouth. Nonetheless, similar markings are found with a previously unidentified Classic aspect of the spotted Headband Twin. This spot- ted Headband Twin variant appears on a Tepeu 1 vessel paired with the Classic form of Xbalanque, or God CH (Fig. 6id). Although possessing the diagnostic headband and black body spots, the figure displays U-shaped black elements around the mouth and eyes. This same character also ap- 117 (c) Early Classic example with death crest and spot on cheek (drawn after Mayer 1980: pl. 39) (d) Spotted Headband Twin variant with Xbalanque Headband Twin (drawn after Hellmuth 1983: fig.i).</page><page sequence="125">Fig. 62 Hunahpu with Principal Bird Diety head- dress.

It has been noted that this scene is very much like the accession monuments at Piedras Negras, which depict simi- lar structures topped by the Principal Bird Deity (Taube 1987). It is quite possible that during the Classic period, the taking of the Vucub Caquix headdress by Hunahpu formed part of the mythic charter for royal accession. Summary The spotted Headband Twin, the pre-Hispanic form of the Quichean Hunahpu, is a rare but im- portant god that warrants a letter designation dis- tinct from God R. God S is an appropriate term of the Post-Classic codical entity. In the Codex Dresden, the name glyph of God S, 1 Ahau, is virtually identical to examples known for the Clas- sic period. Moreover, many of the characteristics noted for the Dresden form are also present in the Quichean Popol Vuh and Classic Maya imagery. His exclusive appearance with God E agrees with Classic Maya scenes illustrating the spotted Head- band Twin with the Classic form of Hun Hunahpu, the Tonsured Maize God. It is clear that for the Post-Classic period of Yucatan, Hunahpu had strong connotations of death and sacrifice. The scenes of decapitation on Dresden pages 2a and 3 a almost surely correspond to the decapitation of Hunahpu mentioned in the Popol Vuh and illustrated in Classic Maya iconography. With his skull headdress and death crest, the fig- ure upon Dresden page 50a has especially strong mortuary attributes and is probably a form of a Classic period Hunahpu variant. pears in Classic epigraphy, and in a number of instances the curving mouth element is replaced by the conventional cheek spot of the Headband Twin (Figs. 6ia-c). In many examples, this entity has clear connotations of death and frequently dis- plays a "death crest" of hair and eyeballs across the top of the head (Fig. 6ib-c). The same crest appears on the skull headdress worn by the Dresden example (Fig. 6od). One of the most ambitious portrayals of the spotted Headband Twin variant occurs on Stela 31 of Tikal (Fig. 62b). Here the Early Classic ruler Stormy Sky impersonates this being. He ap- pears with the same eye and mouth elements and the death crest, here marked with bones. Al- though much eroded, it appears that the ruler upon Tikal Stela 29 is also dressed in this same aspect of the spotted Headband Twin. Thus, the same bone-marked death crest is clearly visible. In addition, a cord and large bead run down the cheek of both figures. This beaded cord is also found on the personified head variant of the Tikal emblem glyph, a sign represented with either the face of the spotted Headband Twin or the Caban curl variant (Fig. 59a). On Stela 31, Stormy Sky wields the headdress of the Principal Bird Deity, the Classic form of Vucub Caquix, aloft in his right hand (Fig. 62b). In another Early Classic scene, the spotted Head- band Twin appears actually wearing a Principal Bird Deity headdress (Fig. 62a). A finely carved bone depicts an enthroned Headband Twin with god markings receiving the bird headdress (Fig. 62c). The Principal Bird Deity appears perched in 119</page><page sequence="127">CHAPTER 3 Foreign Gods of Post-Classic Mexico Classic form of the skeletal Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli (Fig. 63b). The entity appears with a fleshless face wielding an atlatl, the weapon par excellence of Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli. Suspended over his thigh is a rare Early Post-Classic form of the cut conch "wind jewel" of Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl. There is good reason for Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli to display attributes of Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl. According to the Anales de Quauhtitlan, Quetzalcoatl was trans- formed into the skeletal Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli (Seler 1904c: 359-360). The headdress of the Chichen figure bears a striking resemblance to examples worn by the Late Post-Classic Tlahuiz- calpantecuhtli. Thus the series of long feathers projecting out of a shorter feather crest is also found in sixteenth-century representations of Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli (Fig. 63c). In addition, the Chichen headdress contains a series of elements lying across a headband. Similar elements are also found on the headbands of the sixteenth-century Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli (Fig. 63c). In a recent study, Gordon Whittaker (1986: 57) posits the phonetic spelling of tawisical on the Dresden Venus page 48. Whittaker notes that this reading corresponds closely to the first syllables of the Nahuatl name Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli. How- ever, the deity portrayed bears no direct resem- blance to the Mexican Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli. In- stead, it appears to be the Howler Monkey artisan, as previously identified by Michael Coe (1977: 341, 345). As of yet, there is no clear reason why the Howler Monkey artisan would be identified with either Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli or the morning star. Introduction The majority of known Post-Classic Yucatec gods have their origins in Classic Maya iconography, although a number of divinities may have been introduced in the Post-Classic period. Possible ex- amples are the merchant deity known as God M and God Q, who may be a Yucatec form of Tezcatlipoca-Itzlacoliuhqui-Ixquimilli. However, both these deities appear to have their own pecu- liarly Maya qualities, quite probably due to a syncretic merging of foreign deities with previous Maya gods inhabiting similar symbolic domains. There are a number of other deities that appear to derive directly from either the Gulf Coast or Cen- tral Mexico. These examples, many of them unique, are not found upon exotic trade goods but on locally fashioned objects. Nonetheless, their general rarity suggests that the deities portrayed were exotic and that their worship and display sig- naled a conscious link with foreign influence. Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli In an excellent study of Mayapan style incensar- ios, J. Eric S. Thompson (1957: 616-617) suggests that one censer fragment depicts Tlahuizcalpante- cuhtli, a particularly baneful Mexican form of Ve- nus as the morning star (Fig. 63a). Thompson notes that the fragment has a face marked by squares in regular zones and a fleshless mandible. Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli has almost identical facial markings and moreover, is frequently skeletal. A column from the Northwest Colonnade at Chichen Itza depicts a probably Early Post- 120</page><page sequence="128">Fig. 63 Representations of Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli in Post-Classic Yucatan.

Xipe Totec In the previous discussion of God Q, it was noted that a form of flayed god was present among the Classic Maya. Landa (in Tozzer 1941: 120) men- tions a Late Post-Classic Yucatec variant of the Xipe rite of donning the skin of the slain victim: "... they threw the body, now dead, rolling down the steps. The officials below took it and 121</page><page sequence="129">flayed it whole, taking off all the skin with the exception of the feet and hands, and the priest, all bare, covered himself, stripped naked as he was, and all others danced with him." Thompson (1957: 612) notes that Xipe Totec appears no fewer than six times in the corpus of Chen Mul deity censers from Late Post-Classic Mayapan (Fig. 64a). Five of the examples were fragmented heads from Structure Q-208, and along with these sherds, there were also limbs clearly wearing a suit of cut human skin (Thompson 1954: 78; 1957: 612-613, figs. 2a-b). The Mayapan incensario ex- amples all appear with shut crescent eyes and an open, slack mouth, quite like examples of flayed figures known for the Classic Maya and highland Mexico. Robert Smith (1971 : fig. 37d, legend) notes yet another Xipe example from Mayapan exhibiting these facial features (Fig. 64b). In this case, however, the figure is not an effigy incensario, but a hollow, mold-made figurine. The same shut eye and slack, open mouth ap- pear on a number of miniature ceramic masks at Mayapan (Fig. 64c). Because of their facial charac- teristics, Smith (1971: fig. 34) suggests that they may represent Xipe Totec. Averaging some 7 cm in height, these masquettes were clearly not to be worn. In scale, they are entirely comparable to two gold masquettes found in the Sacred Cenote at Chichen Itza (Fig. 64d). These faces, of ham- mered sheet gold, also possess slack mouths and shut eyes. Eight other examples of still smaller size were also found in the Sacred Well, and these too resemble the flayed face of Xipe Totec (see Lothrop 1952: fig. 50). The small ceramic masks at Mayapan may have been votive copies or poor man's versions of the sheet-gold masquettes found in the Sacred Cenote. One of the larger Chichen Itza gold masquettes bears a crosslike device on each eyelid (Fig. 64c). Lothrop (1952: 64) notes that this element is iden- tical to the Aztec symbol for gold, and in addi- tion, mentions that Xipe Totec was the patron god of Aztec goldsmiths. Thus according to Fran- cisco Clavigero, Xipe Totec was the god of pre- cious metal workers (Robelo 1980: 779). In part, this may be due to his flayed suit. In one Contact period Nahuatl song, the flayed skin is compared to a "suit of gold" (Seler 1963, 1: 128). It is quite possible that the Chichen Itza masquettes are the actual faces placed upon elite bags in Late Classic and Terminal Classic Maya iconography. On Uxmal Stela 14, Lord Chac holds such a bag, which displays an inverted face with shut eyes and an open, slack mouth (Figs. 4e, 64f). Other examples occur at Late Classic Piedras Negras, and it is intriguing that some of these bags have the same interlace cross sign serving as the Post- Classic Mexican sign for gold (Fig. 64g). How- ever, it is by no means certain that gold was even present at Late Classic Piedras Negras. Nonethe- less, for Post-Classic Yucatan, it is quite likely that the cited gold masquettes refer to Xipe Totec and his golden garment of human skin. Tlazolteotl J. Eric S. Thompson (1957: 614) identifies the face of another Mayapan incensario as that of Tlazolteotl, the Mexican goddess of earth and fer- tility (Fig. 65a), Thompson notes that the mouth region is blackened. This is a diagnostic attribute of Tlazolteotl, who may be found with a blackened mouth in the Late Classic sculpture of Veracruz (see M. E. Miller 1986: illus. 70). 9 This feature is especially common in Post-Classic repre- sentations of Tlazolteotl, both in Central Mexico and Veracruz (Figs. 65b-c). Thompson also states that the Mayapan fragment has a series of U- shaped elements on the brow as well. According to Thompson, these elements are a symbol of cot- ton and frequently appear on the costume of Tlazolteotl (Fig. 65c). Dienhart (1986: 53) agrees with the cotton signification of these U-shaped elements and notes that this identification was pre- viously made by Seler (1902-23, 1: 166). How- ever, it is by no means certain that all U-shaped elements represent cotton. Larger and thicker ex- amples found with Tlazolteotl are often lunate in form, and it is quite possible that these refer to the moon (e.g., Fig. 52c). In fact, the examples from 9 The cited figure not only has the black facial marking but also hanks of twisted cotton on the headdress and through the ears. In addition, she wears a serpent belt. In Post-Classic Mexico, Tlazolteotl is found wearing serpent belts as well as unwoven cotton (e.g., Codex Laud page 19). 122</page><page sequence="130">Fig. 64 Representations of Xipe Totec and flayed faces in Late Classic and Post-Classic Maya art.

However, although the Mayapan de- vices may not represent cotton, they nevertheless support the Tlazolteotl identification, as Tlazol- teotl is commonly found with the larger lunate sign (e.g., Codex Borbonicus page 13). It is note- worthy that neither Goddess I nor Goddess O oc- curs with the black facial paint or the U-shaped element. It appears that the Mayapan fragment de- picts an entirely foreign introduction, possibly from Veracruz or Central Mexico. 124</page><page sequence="132">Huehueteotl and Xiuhtecuhtli In his discussion of God D incensarios , Thomp- son (1957: 604) identifies the upper portion of one Mayapan specimen as a depiction of Itzamna (Fig. 66a). However, this figure is not the Maya Itzamna but Huehueteotl, the aged fire god fre- quently occurring in the Classic sculpture of Cen- tral Mexico and the Gulf Coast. With its high cheek bones and almost senile grin, the face is highly suggestive of Huehueteotl. However, the broad headband provides the most important identifying feature of the Mexican god. Supplied with a series of quincunxes, it is virtually identi- cal to the urn rims of many Huehueteotl incen- sarios (Fig. 66c). For the Aztec, the quincunx represented turquoise, xiuitl, an important mor- pheme in the name Xiuhtecuhtli, a closely re- lated fire god. Another Late Post-Classic Maya effigy incen- sario of Huehueteotl was discovered at Ichpaatun, a Late Post-Classic site situated slightly north of Chetumal, Quintana Roo (Fig. 66b). In this case, the fragment corresponds to only the uppermost part of the urn, with just the left eye and head- band intact. This headband, however, is clearly composed of two quincunxes and is nearly identi- cal to the Mayapan example. Although fragmen- tary, the remaining portion of the eye orbit is sunken, suggesting that the face had aged and craggy features (for a similar treatment of eye orbit, see Fig. 68c). According to Sahagun (1950-71, bk. 1: 29), Huehueteotl was an epithet of the fire god Xiuhtecuhtli. However, whereas Huehueteotl is invariably rendered as an aged and decrepit being, Xiuhtecuhtli appears relatively youthful, with none of the characteristics of infirm old age. Named turquoise ( xiuitl ) lord ( tecuhtli ), this entity was an important god of rulership as well as of fire (see Sahagun 1950-71, bk. 6). It has been recently noted that Xiuhtecuhtli ap- pears as one of the deities in the Dresden Venus pages (Taube and Bade 1991). The deity occurs on Dresden page 49 as the fearful manifestation of the morning star at heliacal rising. Like the Late Post-Classic Xiuhtecuhtli of highland Mexico, this figure displays horizontal facial banding and wears a form of the xiuhuitzolli crown with the xiuhtototl bird brow-piece (Fig. 67a). The medal- lion worn on the chest of the figure is the same device worn on the headdress of Quetzalcoatl on Dresden page 4a (Fig. 27a). In the discussion of God H, it was stated that this is the Aztec sign for turquoise, or xiuitl. In the iconography of Late Post-Classic Central Mexico, Xiuhtecuhtli com- monly appears wearing forms of turquoise chest pieces (e.g., Borgia pages 14, 50; Vaticanus B page 68; Borbonicus page 9). The appellative glyph accompanying the Dres- den figure provides strong phonetic evidence that this entity is Xiuhtecuhtli (Fig. 67b). The glyph compound is composed of a T109 chac prefix, the T1048 xi skull, a T277 ui suffix, followed by a sign identified by Whittaker (1986: 58) as te in the Landa alphabet, and finally, T679, Landa's i. With the recently proposed reading of the T 1048 beaded skull as xi (Stuart 1987b: 37), the entire compound can be read chac xiu(i)tei, a close gloss for the Nahuatl Xiuhtecuhtli (Taube and Bade 1991). With the appellative compound and the attendant iconography, it is clear that this entity is a Maya interpretation of the Nahuatl Xiuhtecuhtli. Aside from the figure on Dresden page 49, there is one other possible depiction of Xiuhte- cuhtli from Late Post-Classic Yucatan (Fig. 67d). Mural 5 from Tulum Structure i-sub depicts an entity with horizontal facial banding in yellow and blue (see A. G. Miller 1982, pl. 21). The facial patterning strongly resembles that of Xiuhtecuhtli (Fig. 67c). However, there is an ad- ditional detail: the three blue bands running across the forehead, nose, and chin are each bro- ken into a craze of circles and fine lines. The effect is clearly to depict turquoise, with the many short fine lines representing smaller tes- serae among larger disks of stone. It appears that the figure is depicted wearing a turquoise mosaic mask of Xiuhtecuhtli. The God K headdress worn by the figure may also allude to fire. It has been previously noted that God K was closely identified with fire and lightning. On Paris page 9a, the head of God K lies within a cartouche of flames. 125</page><page sequence="133">Fig. 66 Depictions of Huehueteotl.

Mary Ellen Miller (1986: 189) attributes the piece to San Antonio, Quintana Roo. Like the majority of Late Post-Classic effigy burners, the figure wears the cloth "miter" headdress associated with priests and Itzamna. However, the figure also wears two projecting maize cobs on either side of the headdress. This figure is very much like an entity appearing in an Aztec group of stone sculp- tures from Tenochtitlan (Fig. 68d). Termed the Two-Horned God by Debra Nagao (1985), the Aztec figure is seated, usually with the arms crossed and placed over the upraised knees. The aged figure is provided with two projecting ele- ments at the top of the head; at times, these de- vices are clearly corn cobs (Nagao 1985: 12). The Aztec Two-Horned God invariably has two pro- jecting teeth, giving the impression of a snaggle- toothed mouth. The Maya example also has a prominent pair of teeth, as well as a probable beard. The Aztec Two-Horned God may also be bearded, although facial hair was not a common trait. The limited context in which he occurs makes identification of the Aztec Two-Horned God uncertain. Among the possible identities of this deity are Tonacatecuhtli, Tepeyolotl, Huehue- teotl, and Xiuhtecuhtli (see Nicholson and Keber 1983; Nagao 1985; Lopez Austin 1987). Two Fine Orange effigy vessel fragments from the Monjas at Chichen Itza may depict a Terminal Classic or Early Post-Classic form of the Two- Horned God (Figs. 68a-b). The vessel fragments represent a human head with two horn-like ele- ments projecting from the sides of the skull. The more intact specimen appears to be aged, with peaked features and wrinkled lips (Fig. 68c). Both display curving bands around the eyes, which re- call the eye cruller of the Classic Maya Jaguar God of the underworld, also known as the nu- merical seven head variant. The bewhiskered Late Post-Classic effigy censer also suggests the jag- uar, and it will be recalled that beards are a jaguar attribute in Classic and Post-Classic Maya iconog- raphy. The Chichen Itza and San Antonio exam- ples of two-horned deities suggest that the Aztec Two-Horned God may actually be Tepeyolotl, the jaguar god of the earth's interior. The Tlaltecuhtli Earth Deity One of the major figures of Late Post-Classic Aztec sculpture is a monstrous anthropomorphic figure in a splayed and squatting posture (see Pasztory 1983: pls. 97, 98, 109, 113, 115, 117, 130, 216, color pl. 46). The splayed position of the limbs has given rise to the term of hocker, a German word signifying a squatting position. It is generally believed that the Aztec figure, fre- quently supplied with claws and an open, fanged mouth, is a representation of Tlaltecuhtli, the fe- male earth goddess (see Klein 1976: 55-56; Nich- olson and Keber 1983: 61). At Mayapan, there is a sculpture that closely resembles the Aztec Tlaltecuhtli figure (Fig. 69a). Carved from a fine limestone block roughly 90 X 85 cm, the sculpture was discovered in a small shrine (Structure H-i8a) next to a round temple (Chowning 1956). The piece represents a splayed anthropomorphic figure with the arms and legs bent at right angles and, like the Aztec sculptures, skulls appear at the knees and elbows. Citing Proskouriakoff, Chowning (1956: 453) notes the similarity of this piece to the Aztec earth monster. The earth figure overlies two intertwined ser- pents, which recalls the Aztec Histoire du Mechique account of creation. In this episode, Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatnpoca tear Tlaltecuhtli in half by trans- forming themselves into two great serpents (Garibay 1979: 108). However, although clearly influenced by Mexican iconography, the sculp- ture may also derive from Maya traditions. The Classic Altar T of Copan represents a large caiman, a well-known earth symbol, in a similar hocker position (Fig. 69c). A probable reference to the Tlaltecuhtli cre- ation episode appears in Mural 7 of Tulum Struc- ture 16 (Fig. 69b). In this mural scene there is a figure in typical splayed Tlaltecuhtli stance: squat- ting with arms upraised. The entity is transfixed by a pair of twisting elements that pass through 128</page><page sequence="136">Fig. 68 The aged two-horned god in Post-Classic Mesoamerica.

In the Structure 16 mu- rals, these twisting elements are rendered as ser- pents (see A. G. Miller 1982: pls. 37-40). Arthur Miller (1982: pl. 94, legend) describes Mural 7 entity as "an earth monster-like creature spewing forth serpentine borders." Rather than vomiting serpents, I suspect that, as Tlaltecuhtli, this entity is being pierced and torn apart by the two cosmic serpents. A number of scenes from Chichen Itza may 130</page><page sequence="138">represent a still older Early Post-Classic version of the Histoire du Mechique creation episode (Figs. 7oa-c). In these scenes, a pair of serpents emerges out of the abdomen of a reclining woman. The heads of the serpents are provided with blades, as if they had slashed open her abdomen. According to Coggins (1984: 160), this female figure repre- sents the earth. In view of the prominent pair of serpents, her identification appears to be correct. Thus the Chichen motif depicts the same Histoire du Mechique Tlaltecuhtli episode illustrated by the Mayapan sculpture and the mural from Tulum Structure 16. In another Aztec creation account, here appear- ing in the Historia de los Mexicanos por sus pinturas, Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca transform them- selves into a pair of trees to raise the heavens (Garibay 1979: 32). In the two columns from the North Temple of the Great Ball Court at Chichen Itza, trees covered with flowering vines emerge from the navel of the recumbent goddess (Figs. 7ob-c). These columns immediately recall Mexi- can scenes of world trees growing out of the abdo- mens of reclining figures, frequently Tlaltecuhtli (Figs. 7od-e). It is probable that the North Tem- ple columns represent two creation events: the sacrifice and dismemberment of the earth goddess and the raising of the heavens by the world trees. Mural 1 of Tulum Structure 5 may represent a Late Post-Classic version of the North Temple scenes (Fig. 71). Here a pair of twisted serpents form three flowering columns that support the prominent sky band immediately above. The heads of the serpents appear at the far left and right. One displays the head of God B and the other, God K. In the lowest portion of the scene, there is a pair of God B serpents in what appears to be water. Thus they are flanked by a probable conch on the left and a coiled snake on the right. In the center of this scene, between the twisted ser- pents, there is a clawed entity that appears to be swimming. Quite possibly, this figure represents the Tlaltecuhtli monster. Unfortunately, consider- able erosion prohibits its precise identification. The discussed Tlaltecuhtli imagery from Maya- pan, Chichen Itza, and Tulum indicates that a form of the Tlaltecuhtli myth was well known in Post-Classic Yucatan. In this suggested creation myth, the earth goddess was killed by a pair of cosmic serpents who then, as world trees, raised the heavens. Such an episode is consistent with ethnohistoric creation accounts appearing in the Chilam Balam books of Mani, Tizimin, and Chumayel (Craine and Reindorp 1979: 118-119; Edmonson 1982: 40-41; Roys 1933: 101). In the Mani and Tizimin passages, the earth caiman, Itzam Cab Ain, is slain to make the earth. Along with mention of Itzam Cab Ain, the three cre- ation accounts also describe the erection of trees to sustain the heavens (Craine and Reindorp 1979: 119; Edmonson 1982: 49; Roys 1933: 100-102). Martinez Hernandez (191 3: 165-166) compares the Itzam Cab Ain episode to the killing of Cipactli in the Aztec Historia de los Mexicanos por sus pinturas. In the Aztec account, Cipactli is equated with Tlaltecuhtli: "... hicieron del peje Cipactli la tierra, a la qual dijeron Tlaltecuhtli, y pintalo como dios de la tierra, tendido sobre un pescado, por haberse hecho de el" (Garibay 1979: 26). Following the creation of the earth, the Histo- ria describes the raising of the heavens by Tezcatlipoca and Quetzalcoatl in the form of trees (Garibay 1979: 32). In view of the North Building of the Great Ball-Court at Chichen Itza, it would appear that the dismemberment of Tlaltecuhtli by a pair of serpents and the raising of the heavens by trees is an ancient creation account antedating the Late Post-Classic Aztec. Tlaloc One of the oldest known deities of the Mexican pantheon, Tlaloc can be traced as early as the Late Preclassic ceramics of Tlapacoya (Barba de Pina Chan 1956). Known for their goggle eyes and large jaguar teeth, the images of this god are wide- spread at Early Classic Teotihuacan (Pasztory 1974) and in the later iconography of Xochicalco, Cacaxtla, and El Tajin. Representations of Tlaloc are fairly common in Classic Maya art, although Scheie (1986b) notes that the Classic examples ap- pear primarily in the context of war. However, it does appear that the Classic Maya did recognize Tlaloc as a god of rain and lightning. Thus, in 131</page><page sequence="139">Fig. 70 Post-Classic representations of earth god- desses.

G. Miller 1982: pl. 28). one Copan scene, Tlaloc with a War Serpent leg substitutes for God K, a Maya god of lightning and rain (Fig. 72a). In contrast to the anthropo- morphic nose of the Teotihuacan Tlaloc, the ma- jority of Late Classic Maya Tlaloc representations have a sharply upturning snout or lip (e.g., Fig. 72a). This same convention also occurs in the ico- nography of Late Classic El Tajin and other Veracruz sites (Fig. 72b) and in that of Late Post- Classic Mexico (Fig. 35b). Depictions of Tlaloc are common in the iconog- raphy of Terminal Classic and Early Post-Classic Chichen Itza. In one scene, a Tlaloc with the up- turned lip wields an undulating lightning bolt (Fig. 72c). At the outskirts of Chichen Itza, the cave of Balankanche contained a series of contem- poraneous Tlaloc censers (Fig. 72d). These ce- ramic censers display the conventional goggle eyes, large teeth, and upturned snout of the Mexi- can rain god. However, these were not the only rain god censers found in the cave. Another form of censer was carved of local limestone, with full- figured gods sculpted on the sides (see Andrews 1970: figs. 22-23). Although a number of the carved figures have been identified as Xipe Totec (Andrews 1970: 32, 57), they appear with the char- acteristic face, headdress, and lightning weapons of Chac. Thus it appears that during the Early Post-Classic of Chichen Itza, both Chac and Tlaloc were invoked in the cave at Balankanche. The presence of Tlaloc and Chac censers in the Balankanche cave suggests that the symbolic do- main of these two gods overlapped in Post- Classic Yucatan. As early as the Terminal Classic period, Chac appears with characteristics of Tla- loc. Thus the Chac figure on Oxkintok Stela 12 displays the goggle eye of Tlaloc (Fig. 5a). Dur- ing the Late Post-Classic period, the syncretic merging of Chac and Tlaloc is widespread in Yu- catan. A number of Chac effigy vessels from Mayapan appear with goggle eyes and fanged mouths (Figs. 73b-d). One example bears an ele- ment at the bridge of the nose, which closely resembles the prominent nose beads of the Balan- kanche Tlaloc censers (Figs. 72d, 73c). The large teeth of the Mayapan Chac vessels resemble those 133</page><page sequence="141">Fig. 72 Representations of Tlaloc in Late Classic and Post-Classic Mesoamerica.

Diane Chase (1985: fig. 5) identifies the Santa Rita example as Tlaloc; the precise identity of the second example is uncertain. The mouths of the Mayapan, Mayflower, and Santa Rita examples all suggest the jaguar maw of Tlaloc, which is frequently supplied with long incisors and curving canines at the sides. How- ever, such a mouth is not a characteristic of the Classic Chac (see Figs. 4-8). It appears that dur- ing the Late Post-Classic period, the elements curl- ing out of the corner of the Chac mouth were reinterpreted in terms of canines. A transitional form appears on Stela 2 of Cozumel (Fig. 73 e). In this case, the element is sinuous like the Classic examples, but appears to function as a canine in a Tlaloc mouth. Like the Mayapan examples and Oxkintok Stela 12, the Cozumel Chac displays the goggle eye of Tlaloc. Quetzalcoatl For the northern Maya lowlands, there is no foreign god as famous as Quetzalcoatl. In part, this is due to Central Mexican and Yucatec ethnohistorical accounts chronicling the journey of Quetzalcoatl from Tollan to Yucatan (Seler 1902-23, 1: 669-705). In the Yucatec sources, Quetzalcoatl is usually referred to as Kukulcan, meaning plumed or quetzal serpent in Yucatec. According to Landa (in Tozzer 1941: 21), Kukulcan first arrived at Chichen Itza from a re- gion in the west. In view of his direct link with Chichen Itza, it is not surprising that images of Quetzalcoatl abound at this site. The prevalence of Quetzalcoatl imagery at Chichen Itza is espe- cially intriguing since this site shares many spe- cific architectural and iconographic traits with the site of Tula, Hidalgo, generally regarded to be the legendary Tollan (Jimenez Moreno 1941). At Chichen Itza, Quetzalcoatl appears in both zoomorphic and anthropomorphic form. Thus, feathered serpents are extremely common at Early Post-Classic Chichen Itza and frequently ap- pear in architectonic contexts upon columns, cor- nices, and balustrades. Where paint is preserved, the serpents are provided with the green feathers of the quetzal. In the Lower and Upper Temples of the Jaguars at Chichen Itza, the feathered ser- pent often accompanies a particular individual wearing a mask with clearly demarcated regions around the mouth and eyes (Fig. 74a). Remark- ably, the gold portion of such a mask was found in the Sacred Well at Chichen Itza (Fig. 74b). In this case, the goggles demarcating the eye region are supplied with feathered serpents. At Chichen Itza, either the feathered serpent or an associated human figure can appear with star markings (Figs. 74c, d). Clemency Coggins (1984) and Virginia Miller (1989) note that these star-marked figures probably refer to Quetzal- coatl as an aspect of Venus. It will be recalled that according to the Anales de Quauhtitlan, Quetzal- coatl was transformed into Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, and it is likely that these figures refer to Quetzal- coatl as the morning star. A similar figure also appears in the Toltec style rock painting at Ixtapantango, in the State of Mexico (Fig. 74d). Although badly eroded, the scene represents a fig- ure with a star-marked serpent. Another partially preserved star sign seems to cover the abdomen of the human figure, much like examples known for Chichen Itza (Fig. 74c). At Chichen, star signs also appear against the undulating bodies of feathered serpents (Fig. 75a). The earliest known example of a plumed serpent appearing with the star sign occurs in the rock relief carving at Maltrata, Veracruz (Fig. 75b). Rendered in a style strongly reminiscent of Xochi- calco, the scene probably dates to the Late Classic period. The presence of stars on feathered ser- pents occurs as far north as the American South- west. In the remarkable kiva murals from Pottery Mound, New Mexico, there is a depiction of a star sign placed on the undulating body of a feath- ered serpent (Fig. 75c). The Pottery Mound mu- rals date to Pueblo IV, that is, roughly equivalent to the Late Post-Classic period of Mesoamerica. Quite probably, the star-marked feathered ser- pents appearing at Chichen and the American Southwest derive from a single source, Classic Veracruz or Central Mexico. Aside from Chichen Itza, anthropomorphic rep- 136</page><page sequence="144">Fig. 74 Early Post-Classic representations of Quetzal- coatl.

In the discussion of God H, a striking example was noted for Dresden page 4a (Fig. 27a). On Edzna Stela 16, a plumed serpent curls behind a seated individual (Fig. 76a). As in the case of Chichen Itza, it is quite possible that this figure represents an anthropomorphic form of Quetzalcoatl. However, zoomorphic representa- tions of Quetzalcoatl are far more widespread in the northern Maya lowlands.

One of the most ambitious portrayals of the plumed serpent appears on the West Structure of the Nunnery Quadrangle at Uxmal. The head of Chac appears in the mouth of this serpent, which also bears a prominent feather crest on its brow (Fig. 76b). A recently discovered pair of serpent balustrade sculptures from San Angel, Quintana Roo, appear to have been supplied originally with 138</page><page sequence="146">Fig. 76 Terminal Classic and Post-Classic representa- tions of the plumed serpent in the northern Maya low- lands.

Although the appearance of the feathered serpent at Mayapan, San Angel, and other sites may reflect a self-conscious evocation of Chichen Itza and perhaps even distant Tula, it is clear that this being was also identified with water and Chac. The Post-Classic crested serpent recalls the Chicchan rain serpents of the contemporary Chorti Maya, which overlap considerably with Chac of the northern lowlands (see J. Thompson 1970b: 262-265). The lake-dwelling Chicchan ser- pents are also similar to a serpent being of contem- porary Yucatec belief. During a year of residence in the village of San Juan de Dios, Quintana Roo, I was informed of the great noh can serpents that at certain times fly out of the lakes of Coba. Tonatiuh One of the great gods of Late Post-Classic Cen- tral Mexico, Tonatiuh generally corresponds in symbolic role to God G, the sun god of Post- Classic Yucatan. However, the two deities differ widely in appearance. Thus, whereas God G tends to share physical attributes with the jaguar and God D, Tonatiuh is rendered as a youthful lord with no overt feline characteristics. In addi- tion, Tonatiuh frequently appears within a promi- nent solar disk marked with pointed ray signs. Although solar disks are known for the Classic and Post-Classic Maya (e.g., Tikal Stela 1, Paris page 21), disks with pointed rays are notably rare in the Maya region. One of the earliest examples appears on El Castillo Monument 1 (Fig. 77a). Here the disk backs a male individual, probably a form of the sun god. Rendered in pure Cotzumal- huapa style, the monument probably dates to the Terminal Classic period. Rayed solar disks are also found in the Late Post-Classic murals of Santa Rita. In one scene, a human face wearing a serpent headdress peers out of the sun disk (Fig. 77b). Quite probably, this figure represents the sun god. Figures with rayed solar disks are fairly com- mon during the Early Post-Classic period. The similar feathered crests (Fig. 76c). Rendered in stone, the crests would have been held in a hole cut in the central brow of the serpent. Supplied with this feathered crest, the San Angel sculptures are probably Late Post-Classic analogues of the well-known Early Post-Classic balustrades at Chichen Itza. However, the San Angel sculptures also recall contemporaneous representations of ser- pents. The crested balustrades are notably similar to a probable Late Post-Classic graffito from Chichen Itza (Fig. 76d). Manuel Perez (personal communication, 1988) notes that the San Angel examples are also like the great crested serpents stretched over pages 12 to 18 of the Codex Ma- drid (Fig. 76e). Although five of the six serpents on Madrid pages 12 to 18 are supplied with prominent feather crests, their bodies are covered with ser- pent markings rather than feathers. Nonetheless, as in the case of the Nunnery Quadrangle exam- ple, these serpents also appear with Chac. Thus these pages are filled with gouts of water and scenes of the rain god. Quite probably, these crested serpents were considered as geniuses of water. It will be recalled from the discussion of God D that the tzitzab serpent-tailed aspergillum was used to sprinkle sacred water. In the mural scene of God D at Santa Rita, the serpent aspergillum is supplied with a prominent feather crest, as if it were a miniature form of the crested serpent (Fig. I4d). During the Post-Classic period of Yucatan, there were two forms of Quetzalcoatl: one an an- thropomorphic being and the other a feathered serpent. Whereas the anthropomorphic form is fairly rare outside of Chichen Itza, zoomorphic forms are common over much of Post-Classic Yu- catan. It is quite possible that the human aspect of Quetzalcoatl was more closely integrated into po- litical and historical processes in Post-Classic Yu- catan. For example, the human aspect may closely reflect political titles or offices at Chichen Itza (see Lincoln n.d.). The appearance of an an- thropomorphic form at Edzna may have implica- tions for the political geography of the northern lowlands during the Terminal Classic and Early Post-Classic periods. 140</page><page sequence="148">Fig. 77 Representations of solar figures in Terminal Classic and Early Post-Classic Mesoamerica.

The same fig- ure also appears at Chichen Itza, Yucatan. As in the case of the Ixtapantango scene, the solar fig- ure is paired with the anthropomorphic form of Quetzalcoatl (Fig. 77d, e). According to a num- ber of researchers (e.g., A. Miller 1977: 220; Coggins 1984: 160- 161), the Chichen Itza figure is portrayed as a Maya lord. Clemency Coggins (1984: 56-57, 160) notes that the figure wears Maya jade ornaments, such as the nose bar and, more importantly, the Jester God brow-piece, an important Classic Maya symbol of rulership. The element on the brow of the Ixtapantango figure is probably also a form of the Jester God. The jade collar, chest-piece, bracelets, and anklets found with the Chichen Itza figure are also typical of Terminal Classic Maya elite dress. This solar fig- ure sits on a jaguar throne - a clear allusion to Maya rulership. Although unknown in the ico- nography of highland Mexico, jaguar thrones are relatively common in Classic Maya art (e.g., Tikal Stela 20, Palenque Oval Palace Tablet). In several of the polychrome murals from the Upper Temple of the Jaguars, the Chichen Itza figure is represented with a striking iconographic trait, yellow hair (see Coggins 1984: figs. 17-19). An excellent example of the yellow-haired solar figure appears on a mural fragment from the Tem- ple of Chacmool (Fig. 78a). The remains of the solar disk can be seen curving behind the head and shoulders of the figure. He is clearly Maya, and in fact, Ann Morris (193 1: 444) uses this ex- ample to represent Maya figures in the murals. The figure wears a prominent pair of black-tipped feathers in his headdress. The same feather device appears in another Chichen Itza depiction of the solar figure, as well as in the Ixtapantango scene (Figs. 77c, 78b). All of the important traits of the Chichen Itza solar figure can be found with the Late Post- Classic Tonatiuh of highland Mexico. Thus, along with possessing the rayed solar disk, Tonatiuh is usually golden-haired, with a promi- nent pair of black-tipped eagle plumes in his head- dress (Figs. 78c-d). In addition, he wears a nose bar and abundant jade jewelry. His jade headband usually has a prominent zoomorphic mask on the brow. In form, this jade brow-piece is very much like the Classic Maya Jester God. It is quite possi- ble that this Mexican device ultimately derives from Maya conventions. Although the precise ori- gins of the Late Post-Classic brow-piece await further study, one fact seems reasonably clear: many of the attributes of the Late Post-Classic Tonatiuh derive from the Early Post-Classic solar entity appearing at Chichen Itza and Ixtapan- tango, a figure portrayed as a Terminal Classic Maya king. In the Maya region, individuals appearing in rayed solar disks do not appear until the Terminal Classic period, that is, during the ninth and tenth centuries a.d. At Chichen Itza and Ixtapantango, the solar entity is paired with the anthropomor- phic Quetzalcoatl. Like the Quetzalcoatl figure, the solar being may refer to a particular office or title of the Early Post-Classic period (see Lincoln n.d.). In contrast to the anthropomorphic Quetzal- coatl, the solar figure displays the costume and regalia of Terminal Classic Maya kings. How- ever, although ethnically Maya, the solar figure bears no attributes of the Maya sun deity, God G. Instead, he is an entirely different solar being, a blending of Maya and Central Mexican iconogra- phy. It appears that this entity is the direct ante- cedent of the Late Post-Classic Tonatiuh. Al- though it is by no means certain that the Late Post-Classic Tonatiuh was considered to be a Maya prince, this would not be inconsistent with Central Mexican cosmography. In terms of Cen- tral Mexico, Yucatan corresponds to the red land of the east, the realm of Tonatiuh. 142</page><page sequence="150">Fig. 78 The Maya solar figure and Tonatiuh.

The particular gods described are primarily those found in the Post-Classic Maya codices. Many of these figures can be related to Colonial Yucatec and Spanish ethnographic accounts. How- ever, aside from the omnipresent Chac, most of these deities are not readily discerned among con- temporary Maya peoples. It is far easier to trace the Post-Classic gods, not forward into the ethno- graphic present, but back to Classic Maya iconog- raphy. It has been shown that the majority of known Post-Classic Yucatec deities - Gods A, B, C, D, E, CH, G, I, K, L, N, O, R, and S- are clearly present in the preceding Classic Period. Furthermore, forms of Gods B, C, and G can be traced as early as the Late Preclassic Period. Due to the highly realistic and narrative nature of the Classic imagery - particularly that found on carved and painted vases - Classic iconography and epigraphy provide vivid insights into the meanings of particular Post-Classic deities. Thus, for example, the frequent appearance of God L with merchant staffs and bundles in Classic ico- nography reveals that this deity was at least in part a merchant god. Or there is the Classic occur- rence of God K as the burning lightning axe of Chac - a very strong indication that God K is a lightning god. To study the complex and all too frequently bewildering array of gods, symbolic elements, and forms appearing in pre-Hispanic Maya ico- nography, structured sets of recurring and predict- able complexes are indispensible. Thus in the in- troduction it was noted that the Schellhas set of Post-Classic codical gods serves as an excellent means of distinguishing Classic deities. Of course, such sets of known entities can also be projected from the Classic period into the Post- Classic. In the present study, the Classic personi- fied numerals have proved to be of great use in interpreting Post-Classic as well as Classic Maya gods. Thus the Classic head variant of the nu- meral four is God G; five is God N; eight, God E; nine, God CH; ten, God A; and eleven, God R. Furthermore, I have suggested that God H is the Post-Classic form of the youthful deity appearing as the head variant of three and the patron of the month of Mac. Far more than simply faces, these Classic personified numerals provide complex constellations of recurrent and definable traits. However, since the work of J. Eric S. Thompson (1950) there has been no systematic study of these gods. In the light of recent finds and interpreta- tions, a detailed compilation and analysis of the Classic head variants should provide important insights into the identity and nature of the Classic and Post-Classic Maya gods. Aside from the personified variants of num- bers, there is another important form of emic clas- sification, the Quichean Popol Vuh. A great many of the deities appearing in the codices can be corre- lated with characters of the sixteenth-century Popol Vuh, as well as Classic period antecedents. Thus God CH is clearly the codical form of Xbalanque. The brother of Xbalanque, Hunahpu, appears as the codical God S. During the Classic and Post-Classic periods, Hunahpu was epi- graphically named 1 Ahau. In the Codex Dres- den, God S is clearly identified with death, decapi- tation, and the maize god - attributes consistent with the Quichean and Classic Maya forms of Hunahpu. Quite possibly, God R is another as- pect of Hunahpu, although his precise identifica- 144</page><page sequence="152">readings may be, it should be borne in mind that each ancient god probably had a series of epithets that varied according to context. The phoneticism of Maya script also provides secondary characteristics to Maya gods, provid- ing depth and character to otherwise poorly known figures. Thus in the Codex Dresden, God A is provided with the epithet xib , a term bearing strong connotations of fright and death in Mayan languages. The cited reading by David Stuart of God D as an ah dzib, or "scribe" at Xcalumkin indicates that God D was a patron of the scribal arts by as early as the Terminal Classic period. In the codices, God G frequently bears the title of Ahau, or lord, and it is clear that he was closely tied to the office of rulership. Through ethnohistorical accounts, Maya epigra- phy, and scenes in ancient Maya art, it is possible to discern something of the social domains of par- ticular gods. Thus, for example, from at least the Classic period to the early Colonial era, God D was considered as a scribe. However, during the Classic period, he was also portrayed as para- mount lord presiding over lesser divinities. Dur- ing the Post-Classic and Colonial eras, however, he appears more often in the role of a priest, fre- quently with the ritual accouterments of priests. Commonly bearing the title of lord, or Ahau, it is clear that God G was considered as a powerful king. During the Classic period, Gods E and N appear to have been identified less with rulership than with subsidiary positions in the elite court. Thus in one Classic aspect of God E, the Ton- sured Maize God often appears as a courtly artist and entertainer. Although also an entertainer, God N appears more in the role of mummer or buffoon than an elegant dancer. Both Gods L and M are depicted as merchants, frequently with staffs and carrying packs. It would appear that for the Classic period, God L was considered as a merchant king, a wealthy and powerful owner of riches. The two major female divinities, Goddess I and Goddess O, represent distinct roles of Maya women. The lovely Goddess I appears to embody a youthful wife and to preside over matters of marriage, human fertility, and physical love. God- 145 tion and meaning remains to be established. One Classic Maya form of God E, the Tonsured Maize God, is the prototype of the Quichean Hun Hunahpu, the father of the Hero Twins. The con- sistent appearance of God E with God S in the Codex Dresden suggests that God E may have had a similar role during the Post-Classic period as well. During the Classic period, God D was identi- fied with one of the major characters of the Popol Vuh creation epic, the monster bird, Vucub Caquix. Often referred to as the Principal Bird Deity, this being appears to be no less than an avian aspect of God D. Paris page 11 suggests that the Principal Bird Deity was similarly related to God D in Late Post-Classic Yucatan. Consider- ing the ignominious defeat of Vucub Caquix, it is curious that the omnipotent God D is so closely identified with this being. Nonetheless, it does appear that the relations between God D and the Hero Twins were not always amicable. In the aforementioned Classic vessel scene illustrating Hunahpu as a captive, the Hero Twin lies before an enthroned God D (see Coe 1982: 33). Maya epigraphy constitutes one of the most important tools for the identification and interpre- tation of ancient Maya gods. For one, the god appellatives serve as an extremely direct and ele- gant means of identifying particular gods. At times, these name glyphs serve to link physically disparate entities with conventional forms of a god. An example occurs on Dresden page 4a, where a form of Quetzalcoatl is epigraphically labeled as God H. But aside from logographic signs, the phonetic component of the Maya script presents explicit information regarding the actual names and characteristics of the ancient gods. Thus it is now known that God A was termed Cizin by the writers of the Codex Madrid. Maya epigraphy also reveals that from the beginnings of the Classic period, Chac was the uttered name of God B, as it continues to be to this day. Through epigraphic research, it is now known that God C was referred to as Ku or Ch'u, God D as Itzamna, God G as Kinich Ahau or Ahau Kin, God K as Kauil, God N as Pauahtun, and Goddess O as Chac Chel. Nonetheless, however satisfying these</page><page sequence="153">dess O, on the other hand, appears as an old woman. Rather than appearing as a wife coupled with various gods, Goddess O is portrayed as an aged female diviner and curer. Considering the social roles of various gods, it is clear that old age is not antithetical to power. Thus both the aged God D and Goddess O are portrayed as extremely powerful beings. At least in part, their power appears to derive from wis- dom in the form of learned esoteric knowledge. The identification of aged people with power and respect is also consistent with contemporary Maya conceptions. For example, a common Yucatec term for an old individual is nohoch mac, meaning "great person." In many instances, the social roles of particular gods correspond to specific religious functions. For example, Gods L and M are depicted as mer- chants because they were gods of commerce and trade. Similarly, it is probable that God G bears the title of kings because he embodied the con- cepts of elite power and rulership. However, it is also true that the social roles of deities serve as indicators of relative rank and power. Thus the Classic period Itzamna appears as a paramount lord not because he was the god of kings, but because he was the king of gods. Careful atten- tion to such distinctions in rank could provide considerable insights into the structure of the an- cient Maya pantheon. In viewing the gods of the ancient Maya, what one sees is striking continuity over at least a mil- lennium. Despite the Classic collapse and strong Mexican influence in Post-Classic Yucatan, the Post-Classic pantheon is remarkably similar to that of the Classic period. The process of change can be considered more in the nature of gradual, natural drift rather than episodes of sharp disjunc- tion by internal innovation or acculturation from foreign influence. Of the discussed major codical gods, only two can be considered as being rela- tively late Mexican introductions. These are God M, the Maya version of Yacatecuhtli, and God Q, a possible form of Tezcatlipoca-Itzlacoliuhqui- Ixquimilli, or less likely, Xipe Totec. Of the markedly foreign gods appearing in Post-Classic Yucatan, most tend to be quite localized in occur- rence and are primarily at Chichen Itza and Mayapan - sites that seem to have intentionally displayed foreign Mexican traits. It appears that the most geographically re- stricted Mexican gods are those representing spe- cific political offices or titles. Examples are the anthropomorphic Quetzalcoatl and Maya Tona- tiuh at Chichen Itza. In contrast, Mexican gods associated with agricultural fertility seem to have been more readily incorporated into Post-Classic Maya religion. Thus the feathered serpent appears with Chac as a deity of water, whereas attributes of the Mexican rain god Tlaloc frequently merge with the Maya Chac. In order to understand the particular processes and events that created the special character of the Maya gods it is necessary to recognize the Maya as active participants in the greater co-tradition of Mesoamerica. Many Mexican gods are function- ally equivalent to the major Maya deities. Clear examples are the death gods, Mictlantecuhtli and God A, and the gods of rain and lightning, Tlaloc and God B. Due to the underlying meanings of these gods, particular attributes were readily ex- changed. Thus the Post-Classic Mictlantecuhtli displays elements first found with the Classic God A, whereas during the Late Post-Classic period, Chac frequently appears with characteristics of Tlaloc. However, certain shared traits do not ap- pear to be direct borrowing but rather seem to derive from older, shared traditions common throughout Mesoamerica. These basic concepts can also offer important clues to the meaning and significance of particular gods. For example, the widespread identification of lightning with ser- pents and axes in Mesoamerica provides impor- tant insights into the agricultural roles of Gods B and K. Aside from the Maya gods I have described, there may be other important deities not repre- sented in the Post-Classic corpus of iconographic imagery. In discussions of pre-Hispanic Maya gods, we are limited to what has survived and, in addition, to what the ancient Maya chose to have rendered. Thus, it is possible that there is also a supreme omnipotent god analogous to Ometeotl in Central Mexico, a deity that is not readily iden- 146</page><page sequence="154">and describe the association of God B and God K with rain and lightning. Moreover, many of the Maya gods can be identified with particular social positions, such as occupations and offices. Gods L and M appear with merchant bundles and staffs, making them, at least partially, merchant gods. In terms of political offices, it has been seen that in Classic imagery God D is frequently portrayed as an omnipotent ruler seated on his throne. In Post- Classic Yucatan, this being is often found as an ah kin priest. However rich or complex these many associations may appear, it should be always borne in mind that we are seeing only a small part of the entire spectrum of meanings associated with the ancient Maya gods. tifiable in the iconographic record. However, this calls attention to another issue: the varied Post- Classic deities have a wide range of thematic meanings and offices that vary according to con- text. For example, Itzamna, or God D, may at times represent the omnipotent creator, whereas in other instances he may be identified with agri- cultural fertility, curing, or the esoteric knowl- edge of priests. Many of the more subtle mean- ings of the ancient gods, such as their relation to the moral code or philosophy are largely un- known. There has been greater success in identify- ing the more material aspects of the Maya gods, especially their roles in the natural world. Thus it is possible to note the maize component of God E 147</page><page sequence="155">to 3 O O C/5 OS "53 o on -a &lt;u w '&gt; &lt;u &lt;u .£ .5 bD .5 'C OS 1) Oh Oh &lt; C/i • Sh '53 P o t/3 C o .2 'C3 o t/i f/i &lt; "O C nJ C/J &lt;U £ 'C &lt; o &gt;&gt; &gt;-i oJ a a 3 on w i-i « &lt; H . i-. c/a ^ ^ ° ^ W Qw UwOI OQW QW2i Q % S &gt;r T3 T3T3 T3 "C T3 T3 T3 T3 T3 U 13 2 T3 rH £ o oo oooo ooo oo^o u £ 2 o OO oooo ooo oo o ^ Tj T-C 13 JI 3 ^ as 1) c/j ^ U 3 S £ £ H ^ r2 -£ ■ rt ^ n^-1 O.^H .2 ZJ *3 13 u (J O.^H ZJ N 13 ti '*5 J3 o .5o O 3 u S H H U X H C/ «S . &lt;L&gt; 3 £ ■"■* £ J3 . -•-&gt; « § -s 3 f nj ■"■* £ -•-&gt; 3 nj o§« £ -•-&gt; U "§1 3 § nj o c &lt;-&gt; 3U r j C!T! ^ ^ £ o o 3 ^ &lt;-&gt; 3U r j C!T! 3 ^ ^ o DC^ ^ &gt; X "O &lt;u V5 *"5 i3 '2-5 o 2 o jj ^ H °° tJ- m CJ C P-i "73 c/5 C - 1 2 "3 £ c a-ri ^ £ gl °- s ss's^'c^s a-ri !jr § s J &lt; S •§ &lt;* s ^ | 20cuO&lt; | -S m Q ■§ | | Q 8 ^ |s § &lt; &lt;* oo u* 20cuO&lt; &lt; Q ^ c/&gt; I , , £ .
