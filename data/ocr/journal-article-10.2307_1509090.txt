<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NON-EXISTENCE OF GOD: TILLICH, AQUINAS, AND THE PSEUDO-DIONYSIUS ROBERT R. N. Ross DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY, SKIDMORE COLLEGE SARATOGA SPRINGS, NEW YORK Because the notions of finitude and temporality often get associated with the concept of "existence," theologians have sometimes found cause to worry about what we are doing when we assert the existence of God. Perhaps the most radical ,expression of this worry occurs in Paul Tillich's Systematic Theology where he claims, paradoxically, that "God does not exist."' Despite the fact that the remark appears in a book written both within the tradition of, and about, Christian theology, Tillich spends considerable effort trying to convince us why the affirmation that God does exist must be stricken from Christian discourse. Tillich tells us, for example, that "however it is defined, the 'existence of God' contradicts the idea of a creative ground of essence and existence."2 Therefore, "to argue that God exists is to deny him."3 Not only would it be "a great victory for Christian apologetics if the words 'God' and 'existence' were very definitely separated";4 indeed, theology "must eliminate the combination of the words 'existence' and 'God."'5 In short, "it is as atheistic to affirm the existence of God as it is to deny it."6 While the effect of remarks such as these gives one reason to wonder just how Tillich could be doing anything else but some form of a-theology, I think it is clear this is not Tillich's intention. The purpose of this paper, then, will be to show not only that Tillich is committed to the existence of God, but indeed that it is Tillich's intention to affirm one of the important doctrines of classical Christianity. Specifically, it will be argued that when God is understood to be beyond the distinction between essence 'Paul Tillich, Systematic Theology (3 vols.; Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1951-63) 1. 205.

In the course of this paper reference will be made to two other representatives of the tradition in which the worry about asserting God's existence gets expressed: Aquinas and the Pseudo- Dionysius. By examining them on this matter I hope to make more explicit the nature of Tillich's motive behind the claim "God does not exist," and to suggest that it would be wrong to interpret this remark as an intention to deny there is a God. I Tillich was not the first Christian theologian to see that there might arise some semantic necessity for suggesting that God does not "exist." In the Summa Theologiae Aquinas notes that the Pseudo-Dionysius also had said God does not exist, that "God ... is not there: he is beyond what is there."' This remark arises in Aquinas' discussion of the possibility of our knowledge of God, and the question of whether any created mind can see God's essence. According to Aquinas, the purpose of the Pseudo- Dionysius' claim was to describe the situation of the finiteness of the human mind and the limits of possible knowledge of God. Since the human mind can only know "what is already there to be known"8 and since God is "beyond what is there,... he is not intelligible, he is beyond understanding."9 In the Mystical Theology the Pseudo-Dionysius refers to our acknowledgment of this circumstance as the "darkness of unknowing," the "divine gloom," in which, after the mind has removed the inadequate and anthropomorphic images from its concept of God, it renounces all apprehension of God by the understanding and becomes mystically united to the God who is wholly unknowable by the finite mind. 10 Aquinas saw the Pseudo-Dionysius' point, but felt this way of speaking was dangerous. For while Aquinas agreed that we cannot in this life know God's essence, even after the proofs," 7Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae Ia.

Indeed, we do know and can prove that God exists and that his essence is identical with his existence.12 Thus, although God's essence is itself beyond our mortal apprehension, nevertheless, it can be shown that certain propositions we frame about God are true. In particular, according to Aquinas, it can be proven that in the affirmation "God exists" subject and predicate stand for the same thing. Consequently, Aquinas tried to make the Pseudo- Dionysius' point in a different way by saying: "God is not said to be 'not there' in the sense that he does not exist at all, but because being his own existence he transcends all that is there."'13 Aquinas clearly acknowledged the infinite distance between the human mind and God. Yet he did not want to be committed to an absolute discontinuity between them. Specifically, Aquinas wanted not to be forced, as he suspected the Pseudo-Dionysius was, into having to deny one can have any knowledge of God at all - into having to claim God is simply unintelligible. For Aquinas, God in himself is infinitely intelligible; it is we who do not have infinite understanding.14 But in this position Aquinas believed it was possible to hold both to the radical difference between God and the human mind, yet also retain the demonstrability of some knowledge of God. To do this required proof: proof that God does exist and that God is his own being. Nevertheless, knowing that meant that we could know something about the way in which God differs from ordinary existing things. It did not, as it had for the Pseudo-Dionysius, represent the total absence of knowledge. It was not a void, a blank, nor was it a mystical union in which rationality was totally renounced. When God is understood by Aquinas to exist above all that exists because he is his "own being," then it is clear Aquinas is also saying God just isn't an ordinary existing thing, a "being among others." Indeed, it is in this sense that Aquinas recognizes a certain justice to the Pseudo-Dionysius' claim. For like Aquinas, the Pseudo-Dionysius was attempting to make the suggestion that it lies in the concept of "God" itself that God is necessarily beyond existence. The Pseudo-Dionysius, however, drew from this the conclusion that, if God is necessarily "above" all existing things, then it may even be better to say God doesn't exist. But the 12Ibid., Ia.

For no matter how inscrutable one might believe the nature of the object of religion must be, it would be absurd to suggest that what we are worshipping is, after all, something non-actual. Nevertheless, in setting the limits of any religious epistemology, Aquinas was aware that part of the logic required laying out certain claims about God which prohibit one from understanding God as just another existing thing "out there" whose nature can be inferred from these existing things "here." In particular, if it is a claim about God that God is his "own" being, then it is analytic that God cannot be thought of in terms of ordinary existing things, since it is precisely denied about "things" that they can be their "own" being. For this reason there can be no possibility of any inference to God's nature from ordinary existing things - their natures in this respect are contradictory. Indeed, even before the proofs Aquinas is careful to warn that while God's effects can serve to demonstrate that God is, this does not mean they can help us to know what God is.5" The limits of our religious knowledge, then, are established by virtue of the fact that God's nature must be conceived of as contrary to our own, and one expression for this difference has been the claim that God "transcends" all existence. But from the notion that God transcends existence, it does not follow that God is "without" existence, as the Pseudo- Dionysius had implied. It is at this point that Aquinas believed the Pseudo-Dionysius to have fallen into error, and I will want to return to this matter in the course of my discussion of Tillich. For Aquinas there is a sense in which the only possibility of asserting God's existence depends upon our acknowledgment of the doctrine that God's essence and existence are identical. Whereas ordinary existing things exist by virtue of something other than their own essence, it is God's nature to exist. God's nature is primarily to be.16 Thus, if it can be proven that God's essence is identical with his existence, then, Aquinas believes, God's existence can be asserted without contradiction, even though it is this very doctrine that establishes the radical difference in nature between God and created beings and poses the problem of asserting God's existence in the first place. For the '15bid., Ia.

N. ROSS 145 notion of a being whose essence and existence are identical with him and with each other is the notion of a being about which it would be absurd to say it didn't exist. The doctrine, in short, is about a being whose existence is in some sense necessary. Perhaps even more important, however, is the fact that it is also from this doctrine that Aquinas draws the conclusion that it is not the case that God cannot be known; rather, "... he is beyond all that can be known of him."17 From the doctrine that God's essence and existence are identical, that is, Aquinas draws both the basis of, and the conditions for, the possibility of making any intelligible statements about God at all. The doctrine of the identity of God's essence and existence establishes, first of all, an infinite difference in kind between God and ordinary existing things. Its subject is a being of whose nature we have no clear apprehension because, unlike ourselves, it is a being whose existence is nonderivative. But if it can be shown that the concept of such a being is not incoherent - if we can know what is meant by the notions of "essence" and "existence," and also prove that there is a being, God, who verifies those predicates simultaneously, 18 then one can allow for the possibility of making intelligible statements about such a being. According to Aquinas, it is not the case that God is unknowable, or beyond all knowledge, in the sense that the concept of God is unintelligible. Even though God is beyond what can be known of him, assertions using the concept "God" do not involve one in any immediate contradiction. If it were true that God was unknowable, simply unknowable, the implication would be that one ought to stop talking about there being such a thing as God altogether. However, Aquinas' point is that God's nature transcends the finiteness of the human mind; or, as the Pseudo-Dionysius sometimes suggested, the human mind is "rendered blind" by the intensity of the divine light. Thus, while it is one thing to say God is beyond knowledge, it is quite another to say the concept "God" has no place in knowledge because it is unintelligible. But it was the former, Aquinas argued, that was what the Pseudo-Dionysius really meant - or ought to have meant - by saying God "cannot be comprehended."19 '7Aquinas, Summa Theologiae Ia.

Q. 12, art. 1, reply to obj. 3.</page><page sequence="6">146 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW It would be misleading, however, to suggest that the Pseudo- Dionysius himself flatly denies God's existence. God is more often said to be something not existing but "super-existing." The transcendent Godhead does not belong to the category of existence, but neither does it belong to the category of non- existence.20 Now, at least once, Tillich also uses the neo-Platonic formula of "super-existence" in order to explain what he means by saying that God is "above" existence or "beyond" existence. According to Tillich, God "is not an existing thing" not because there is no God, but because God "is ... the Super-existing, that which is at the same time the absolute Nothing and the absolute Something."21 With respect to ordinary existing substances, God is wholly other --the absolute Nothing (i.e., absolutely "unlike"). But in the sense that God himself is the creative ground of all being, the source of being in everything that is, God is the absolute Something. It seems reasonable, then, to suggest that Tillich's claim "God does not exist" expresses fundamentally the same worry as we have seen expressed by the Pseudo-Dionysius and Aquinas. The question now before us is: does Tillich's solution to that problem fundamentally differ from that of Aquinas? II It has been suggested that for Aquinas the ability to assert God's existence rests on an acknowledgment of the doctrine that in God essence and existence are identical because God is his "own" being. The presupposition of this doctrine is the implicit condition for asserting God's existence. Does Tillich also hold this? Does Tillich also hold, like Aquinas, that one can assert God's existence if God's essence and existence are understood to be identical? I will argue that he does. One way this can be brought out involves the classical distinction between "essence" and "existence" which has been referred to but not yet made explicit. In general, for any given thing which is said to exist or have being, one can roughly mark off a distinction signified by the applicability of two questions: 20Cf. Dionysius the Areopagite, Mystical Theology V. 21Paul Tillich, "Ober die Idee einer Theologie der Kultur," Religions- philosophie der Kultur; Zwei Entwirfe von Gustav Radbruch und Paul Tillich (Berlin: Reuther und Reichard, 1919) 35, quoted in James Luther Adams, Paul Tillich's Philosophy of Culture, Science, and Religion (New York: Schocken, 1970) 43-44.</page><page sequence="7">ROBERT R. N. ROSS 147 (1) whether a thing exists (an sit), its "existence" corresponding to what is asserted by the fact that it is, and (2) what a thing is (quidditas), what the nature or essence of a thing is, what kind of thing it is by which it differs from other species of things. "Existence" is sometimes said to refer to the "act" by which an individual thing actually has the essence which is constitutive of its particular form.22 It is the act which individuates a thing. "Essence," on the other hand, is something there to be referred to whether it exists or not. Essence is that by which something can be said to be of a certain kind and by which it is able to be associated with other things of the same kind. Now sometimes Tillich implies that to assert that something exists is to specify that "something" as a member of the class of "the totality of beings,"23 from which it follows that it is "subject to the categories of finitude, especially to space and substance,"24 or that it is "conditioned"25 - i.e., dependent on something else for its existence. In other words, Tillich sometimes seems to be suggesting that to assert the existence of something entails that it is a finite, particular being in the sense he calls "a being among others." But if something is a being among others, it would seem to be subject to the applicability of the distinction between its essence and its existence - between what it is and the fact that it is. However, it is not clear how one ought to take this "entailment." Does Tillich hold that the distinction between essence and existence necessarily follows from the meaning of "exists" alone? Unfortunately it is far from clear just what Tillich believes follows from the concept of "exists." Nevertheless, if, for Tillich, it is analytic or part of the meaning of "exists" so that to assert the existence of x necessarily means that for every x its essence is distinct from its existence, then clearly Tillich cannot, as Aquinas believed he could, consistently assert the existence of God and also hold that in God there is no distinction between his essence and existence because God is "beyond" that distinction (i.e., that God is not a being "among" others). But Tillich does hold that in God there is no distinction between his essence and existence, for he accepts as true26 the scholastic doctrine that "in God there is no difference between 22Aquinas, Summa Theologiae Ia. Q. 3, art. 4, reply to obj. 2, for example. 23ST 1. 205. 24ST 1. 235. 25ST 1. 173. 26ST 2. 23.</page><page sequence="8">148 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW essential and existential being. This implies that the split [between essence and existence] . . . has no relevance for the ground of being itself."27 God, Tillich continues, "is not subjected to a conflict between essence and existing. He is not a being beside others ... His existence, his standing out of his essence, is an expression of his essence. Essentially he actualizes himself. He is beyond the split ... God alone is 'perfect,' a word which is exactly defined as being beyond the gap between essential and existential being."28 Consequently, if there is to be any way that Tillich might allow it as permissible to assert God's existence, then it would seem Tillich cannot hold it is analytic, or from the meaning of "exists" alone that for every x its essence is distinct from its existence. Indeed, Tillich himself never says this distinction is part of the meaning of the word "exists." Later, we will see that Tillich associates an idea similar to the distinction between essence and existence - which carries with it notions of spatial and temporal finitude - with the term "exists." This, however, does not arise from a direct inspection of the meaning of exists. For now let us assume it is only when one asserts the existence of an x that is what Tillich calls "a being among others," that it follows its essence and existence are distinct. One can ask of a being "among" others both what it is and whether it is. But since Tillich denies that God is a being "among" others, he is still in a position, at least in principle, to affirm God's existence without contradiction. It must be admitted that this seems to go against some of Tillich's own words - words which suggest that to assert the existence of God is "a contradiction in terms."29 But in judging that Tillich means to leave it open that there is a way one can sensibly affirm God's existence - indeed, that Tillich himself presupposes throughout his entire theology that there is a God - I considered the following. First, as I have suggested, if Tillich held that it was analytic, or part of the meaning of the word "exists," that essence and existence are, for every x, distinct, then Tillich would have to regard the doctrine that in God essence and existence are identical - a doctrine which, as it were, is a permission to assert God's existence - as either false or unintelligible. But Tillich 27ST 2. 22. 28ST 2. 23. 29Cf. ST 1. 207.</page><page sequence="9">ROBERT R. N. ROSS 149 does not regard that doctrine as false. He explicitly claims it as true. Moreover, for Tillich, it does not seem to be part of the meaning of the word "exists" that essence and existence are distinct. Thus it remains open as at least logically possible that there should be a case for which this distinction has no application. Therefore, it also remains possible for Tillich to assert the existence of God without involving ourselves in "a contradiction in terms." Secondly, if Tillich really believed asserting God's existence were a contradiction, so that from any use of "exist" it followed that to assert God's existence were to utter something false or meaningless, then any remark in which the existence of God were implied or presupposed would also be meaningless. Yet it should be equally obvious that Tillich is far from drawing the conclusion that there is no God or that writing theology is meaningless. Indeed, to the contrary, the abundance of dogmatic claims about God which Tillich affirms forces one to conclude that his entire theology simply presupposes the existence of God. What one finds Tillich most typically saying is that discussions or arguments about the existence or non-existence of God are meaningless.30 This, however, is quite a different matter, and it may only be a way of indicating that he finds such arguments pointless, religiously. Thus, even if Tillich does find the question of the existence of God meaningless, it is in any case not because he regards the concept of God "unintelligible." But if the claim that to assert the existence of God is a "contradiction in terms" does not prohibit Tillich, in his theology from presupposing the existence of God, just what, one wants to know, does Tillich believe to be contradictory about affirming God's existence? In brief, it is the idea of an argument for the existence of an unconditioned being "within reality."33 Tillich's assumption here - warranted or otherwise - is that in arguing for God's existence we are somehow forced to conceive of God as a being within reality where "within" seems to have the force of meaning "an individual part of reality," or, perhaps, "the universe" itself. According to Tillich, the God argued for by the "reasoning" used in arguments for his existence is "less than God"32 for his nature is "derived from the world."33 But this 3oCf. Paul Tillich, Dynamics of Faith (Harper Torchbooks; New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1957) 67. 31ST 1. 207. 32ST 1. 74. 33ST 1. 205.</page><page sequence="10">150 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW "brings God's existence down to the level of that of a stone or a star . . ."34 The result is that God becomes identified as "a particular being,"35 "a being alongside others ... something conditioned by something else which is also conditioned."36 But when we "bring him down to the level of a thing in the world ...,37 the term 'God' becomes interchangeable with the universe and therefore is semantically superfluous."38 The outcome of Tillich's worry about what he thinks happens when we speak of God as "existing" is this: not only does bringing God "into" the world make it easier to deny his existence;39 indeed, he says, it "makes atheism . .. almost unavoidable."40 But why is Tillich worried that our affirming that God "exists" entails "bringing him into the world"? Why does Tillich suggest, with an air of deliberate paradox, that the God who exists ". ceases to be the God who is really God";41 he ceases to be an object of "ultimate concern"?42 Just what does this worry mean? It means, for one thing, that if we were talking about things like stones and stars when we argue for God's existence, we would not be talking about God. And, of course, one can quite agree with Tillich that if all we meant by "God" were simply a very large and hard-to-get-rid-of physical object (say, "the universe"), then God might just as well be, as Kierkegaard once quipped, a "tremendously large green bird, with a red beak."43 But whether the "ordinary theist"44 -one, presumably, for whom the arguments for God are at least relevant to faith - has ever meant by "God" any of the things Tillich suggests he does is another story. It may be that certain arguments turn out that way, although Tillich never shows this. But that the "ordinary theist" 34Paul Tillich, "The Two Types of Philosophy of Religion," Theology of Culture (ed. Robert C.

ROSS 151 necessarily begins by thinking of God as such an object (however large or however hard-to-get-rid-of) is an assumption which is in need of some justification. Does it follow, after all, from the claim "God exists" that "God" must therefore refer to some finite, conditioned entity in the world (or even to "the entire world")? It does not seem immediately obvious that it does. Since Tillich holds Aquinas' doctrine that God's essence and existence are identical to be true, and, consequently, there is nothing which rules out at least one way for Tillich to be in a position to assert God's existence without contradiction, the question which must now be asked is this: is there anywhere in Tillich's theology evidence which suggests Tillich himself allows that there are conditions under which the concept of "existence" can meaningfully be applied to God, under which God's existence can be affirmed? The answer is that there is. At several points Tillich explicitly indicates that the concept of existence can be applied to God.45 Indeed, as for Aquinas the acknowledgment of the doctrine that in God essence and existence are identical is a condition for asserting God's existence, for Tillich it is also a condition for asserting God's existence. But the point is that Tillich explicitly admits that if we acknowledge this doctrine as true, then we can affirm God's existence. Tillich says this: "If existence in God is thought of as united with his essence, I could apply this concept to the divine life."46 Further, since Tillich holds it as true that essence and existence "are not separated in God as in finite beings,"47 the conclusion that he means to allow for us to affirm God's existence seems clear. I suspect that part of what for Tillich is "half blasphemous" about asserting God's existence is that in doing so we should think of ourselves as asserting an ordinary empirical fact - in the sense in which the methods of an empirical investigation would be relevant to the discovery of that "fact." For if it is part of the concept of God that God cannot be "a being among others," then God cannot be a member of the universe of "things." But if God is not a member of the class of "things," then the methods of empirical investigation are not applicable to the question of his 45For example, ST2. 23; The Theology of Paul Tillich (eds.

As Tillich puts it: "God does not exist factually." It is "in this sense I call the assertion of the existence of God blasphemous."49 Clearly, however, this qualifies Tillich's claim that "God does not exist" in a rather significant way. For it makes it clear that it is not Tillich's intention to deny there is a God, but rather to reaffirm the classical theological claim that God is not a physical object.50 Aquinas' doctrine of the identity of God's essence and existence can now be brought into relation with what I believe we have discovered about Tillich's claim "God does not exist." When Aquinas held one could assert the "existence" of God, it presupposed his having denied that the distinction between essence and existence could be applied in the case of God. God exists but he exists as a being infinitely "other" than ordinary existing things. Tillich's denial that God is a being, a being "among others," is his restatement of this doctrine. I suggest, moreover, that Tillich's claim "God does not exist" amounts to a misguided attempt to reinforce this same point. Seen in a sympathetic light, I think it becomes possible to understand Tillich's claim "God does not exist" not as a denial that there is a God, but, to the contrary, as a statement of the radically unique manner by which God does exist - so unique, however, that for Tillich the term "exists" itself has become "inadequate" for the concept of God,5' in some way suspect. Less sympathetically, though, one can argue that "exists" is a perfectly valid word to express the purported reality of something - be it God or otherwise. Why, for example, does Tillich sometimes associate finite, spatio-temporal connotations with the term "exists,"52 making it grammatically improper to apply the term to God? For it is false that the word "exists" has finite, spatio- temporal connotations. If, say, a winged horse existed, it would indeed be a finite, spatio-temporal object, but only because "winged horse" has spatio-temporal connotations, not because 48Cf. Tillich, "The Idea of God," 85: "... if God is not a being ... he is not within the context of finite things which are open to scientific research .. ." 49Kegley and Bretall, Theology of Tillich, 339, my emphasis. 50See, e.g., Aquinas, Summa Theologiae Ia.

ROSS 153 "exists" does.53 When one affirms the existence of God one is not affirming the existence of a finite, spatio-temporal object. And if the connotation of spatio-temporal reference is absent (as it is) when one does affirm God's existence, this is because God is not a spatio-temporal object, and not because one is inappropriately using the term "exists." We could, of course, invent a new word to replace "exists" - or, even worse, as Tillich does, simply assume there is a God while denying he "exists." But how are we the better for these added confusions? While suggesting that Tillich's restatement of Aquinas' position is perhaps "misguided," I do not, on the other hand, mean to imply it is simply unintelligible. At least, I think it is possible to see what Tillich is trying to do. Consider his claim that God is not a being "among others." The denial that God is a being "among others" is relevant to asserting God's existence in this sense: it becomes part of the logic of asserting God's existence that God is at the same time denied to be an ordinary existing thing whose nature or essence can in some sense be referred to whether or not it exists. In the case of God it makes no sense to speak of God's nature without, at the same time, referring to it as an existing nature.54 One can sensibly assert that something should be an F without implying there is or ever was one. But one cannot affirm that it is possible there should be a God without implying that God must exist, if indeed there is a God. It is important to note that we are not here saying anything about whether or not God does exist. That is, from this claim about the concept "God" it does not follow that there actually is a God, as some supporters of the ontological argument have wanted to maintain.55 It is, 53Cf. Willard Van Orman Quine, "On What There Is," From a Logical Point of View (Harper Torchbooks; 2d ed.; New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1963) 3. 54This is not the same, however, as saying one can infer God's existence from his nature. That is a different matter, and, at least for Aquinas, requires a proof from God's effects. But when Tillich adds to this doctrine the claim that one cannot sensibly even raise the question of God's existence, his position seems suspiciously close to some form of ontological argument. Tillich, that is, sometimes appears to regard it as a feature of the concept of "God" itself that it is senseless to think of God as not existing. Aquinas, however, specifically rejects the ontological argument, and his "proofs" of God's existence are themselves evidence that he regards the question "Is there a being whose nature is to exist?" as meaningful - one whose answer must take the form of a demonstration. 55See, e.g., Norman Malcolm, "Anselm's Ontological Arguments," The Philosophical Review 69 (1960) 41-62, reprinted in The Many-Faced Argument (eds.

McGill; New York: Macmillan, 1967) 301-21, especially 316-17.</page><page sequence="14">154 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW however, a classical Christian claim about God's unique nature. It is what one might call a significant "grammatical" claim about the meaning of "God," because it tells us what kind of concept the concept "God" is. It tells us what features about the concept "God" we must accept if we are to meaningfully use the concept at all, and it is "grammatical" in the sense that it informs us of the conditions for our use of this word. At least this is one possible interpretation of what is meant by Aquinas' doctrine that in God there is no distinction between his essence and his existence because God is his own being. God has his being not from something other than himself. Every being that is some F - some kind of thing - however, is a created being. It has its being from something other than itself. Whether or not it exists, whether or not there is some F which actually has the form constitutive of its essence is not a consequence of its own nature. Rather, it is a consequence of God's creation. An individual existing thing - what Aquinas calls a "substance" - must be of such a nature that it canpossibly exist. A purported object whose nature is such that it could not possibly have that nature (a round square, for example) cannot possibly exist. Nevertheless, a substance which is a possible object is not something which can exist of itself. From the fact that a given nature is one which can possibly exist, it does not follow that it does exist nor that it must exist if, in fact, there actually is one. As Aquinas puts it, the nature of a substance "is not itself the thing's existence."56 Only God, then, is the being whose nature is primarily to be. The nature of created substances is to be F or to be G, but not essentially to be. Whether created substances exist is dependent upon something other than their own nature or essence. And that upon which everything is dependent for its existence, according to Aquinas, is God. But Aquinas also says that God's being is that to which "no addition" can be made.57 God, in other words, is not some kind of thing but is "existence itself.""58 God's nature is simply to be59 in the sense that the divine being is without the addition of any form by which it can be identified as of a certain type of thing within the category of substance. "God does not belong to the category of substance."60 "God is not even a 56Aquinas, Summa Theologiae Ia. Q. 3, art. 5, reply to obj. 1. 57Ibid., Ia.

ROSS 155 prototype within the genus of substance, but the prototype of all being, transcending all genera."61 Now, when Tillich says that God is not a being, it is essentially Aquinas' doctrine that God is utterly simple - the doctrine that God's essence and existence are identical because God "transcends" all genera - which I believe him to have in mind. Tillich's claim that God is not a being among others reaffirms the classic theological notion that God does not "fall under" the category of substance. God transcends the distinction between essence and existence which otherwise applies to every substance.62 But if Tillich is fundamentally restating Aquinas' position here, as I believe he is, then in his claim that "God does not exist," certainly Tillich has come to use "exist" in a deliberately ambiguous way. The notions of spatial and temporal finitude which Tillich at times associates with the meaning of "exists" play on the language of essence and existence (what Tillich calls "essential" and "existential" being).63 Nevertheless, Tillich's peculiar use of "exists" seems to develop from what one might call a religious interpretation of the nature of existence, rather than from a direct analysis of the meaning of "essence" and "existence" or of the word "exists" itself.64 Generally, when Tillich speaks of something "existing," this is understood from the standpoint of a religious interpretation he places on the creation and fall of existence,65 from which it follows that something "existing" is subject to the "conditions" of existence: namely, the "disruptions" of the fall from essential being to existential estrangement.66 "Exists" in this sense refers to a particular state of existence, a particular historical condition of existence, one might say. It is informed from the perspective of the Christian doctrine of the fall, in which in everything there is an ontological separation from what Tillich calls essential or "true" being. Tillich's name for this state is "estrangement" ("The state of existence is the state of 61Aquinas, Summa Theologiae Ia. Q. 3, art. 6, reply to obj. 2. 62Cf. Ultimate Concern (ed. D.

This state is variously characterized by Tillich as being one of blindness, distortion, falling into non-being, self-destruction, disruption, disintegration, loneliness, and ambiguity. But clearly "exists" in this sense does not apply to God; it is a sense of "exists" which could not apply to God since God does not number among those created beings who participate in the fall.68 When Tillich denies that God exists because the concept of existence is said to be inadequate for God, it is this special sense of "exists" he has in mind. Moreover, the connection between Tillich's claim "God does not exist" and his denial that God is "a being among others" comes clearer. For ultimately Tillich's denial that God "exists" amounts to nothing more than a rejection of the false idea that God could be a finite being - an individual created substance. Given Tillich's religiously "weighted" sense of "exists," one can see on what basis he is led to make the claim "God does not exist." Yet the cost of the questionable forcefulness gained in making it comes high. In affirming the reality of God there is a confusion - a confusion Aquinas appreciated but sought to avoid. But because the confusion is a genuine one, it cannot be removed, as Tillich thought, by merely attempting to remove the concept of "existence," or by somehow making it inoperative. Thus, in the case of Tillich, and perhaps the Pseudo-Dyonysius as well, the price paid for (sometimes) disallowing the possibility of asserting God's existence is that of losing sight of where to focus our confusion. Ultimately, I believe, Tillich has reduced what is a real problem to one of semantics. For if the concept of God is intelligible - as Tillich certainly maintains - then the problem is not that of whether we can say, verbally, God "exists." Rather, the problem lies in what follows, religiously, from the fact that we do. 67ST2. 44. In Tillich's theology existential "estrangement" is also regarded, in some sense, as a consequence of creation: "creation and the fall coincide ... Actualized creation and estranged existence are identical" (Ibid.). Tillich's point, apparently, is to emphasize the universality of the fall. (Cf. Kegley and Bretall, Theology of Tillich, 343.) The ethical difficulties of this view - that sin is made into an ontological necessity instead of our personal responsi- bility - are discussed in an essay by Reinhold Niebuhr: "Biblical Thought and Ontological Speculation" (ibid., 216-27). 68Tillich sometimes allows that there is a sense in which God does participate in the results of the fall. (Cf. ST 1. 245, 270.) But even so, it is not as a created being.</page><page sequence="17">ROBERT R. N. ROSS 157 Indeed, it is hard to imagine what it would even be like to hold on to religion while giving up all possibility of affirming the existence of God. Tillich is not, however, any more than Aquinas, suggesting we give up religion. Yet for Tillich it seems a more crucial question just how he thinks it can be maintained that religion is, after all, the subject of his form of "theology." I can only suggest that the confusion in asserting God's existence should for Tillich, more than it does, be cause for us to look at what follows, in terms of our religious belief, from acknowledging our inability to make it known how God is living even though his life is qualitatively different from creaturely existence.69 The solution Tillich sometimes proposes to this dilemma - to simply give up asserting God's existence - is wrong. And the fact that he assumes all along the existence of that which he claims we must deny only prolongs the discomfort. III Tillich attaches to the claim "God does not exist" - apparently as an explanation for it - the statement that God is "beyond essence and existence."70 Unfortunately this statement has the tendency to add to the feeling that Tillich commits himself to some form of atheism. The remark is semantically unclear because it gives the impression that Tillich means to suggest not merely, in the manner of Aquinas, that God is beyond the distinction between essence and existence because in him they are identical,7' but that God is "beyond" existence altogether. Now to say that God is beyond the distinction between essence and existence is one thing. But to say that God is beyond essence and existence simpliciter is quite another. For from the latter, though not the former, it can only follow that there is no God. The impression that Tillich is suggesting the latter is just that, however, for Tillich himself later qualifies the remark, when, in a reply to one of his critics, he emphasizes that "the phrase 'beyond essence and existence' does not mean without it."72 Indeed, Tillich tells us that "there is of course that being which is beyond essence and existence, which, in the tradition of the classical theology of all centuries, we call God - or, if you prefer, 'being-itself'. . .73 69Cf.

What he is denying, rather, is only a "false" construction put on the concept of God by which God turns out to be nothing more than a finite entity, characterized by the distinction between what it is and the fact that it is. Moreover, according to Tillich, to deny that God is finite is precisely the purpose of the phrase "beyond essence and existence": namely, that God "does not merely exist and is not merely essential but transcends that differentiation, which otherwise belongs to everything finite."74 The confusion generated by Tillich's expression "beyond essence and existence," then, is largely verbal and can be removed in the following way. "Beyond essence and existence," taken literally, appears to be a straight claim about God - one quite different from the claim that would be made by saying it is part of the concept "God" that God is beyond the differentiation between essence and existence. The latter claim is a "grammatical" remark about what can and can't be said about God, given the currency of the concepts "essence" and "existence": to say of God "there is a distinction between his nature and his existing" does not make sense. The unclarity of the former claim, however, derives from the fact that it reads like a negative existential. That is, if God is "beyond" existence - one might so interpret - then it follows that he does not exist, that there is no God. But when Tillich tells us that in the phrase "beyond essence and existence" "beyond" is not meant to imply without existence, that interpretation must be ruled out. Thus, it is some sense of "beyond" which does not mean "as if without" that Tillich has in mind. For Tillich to say God is "beyond" existence is not to imply that God is a being who has in some way "outgrown" existence. Rather, it suggests a certain sense in which Tillich has "outgrown" the concept of existence - or in which it has outgrown him - for it no longer has a clear or unambiguous use for him. Nevertheless, it remains that by "beyond essence and existence" Tillich does not mean something fundamentally different from what Aquinas meant by saying that in God essence and existence are identical, where the implication is that.God is "beyond" that contrast. Indeed, Tillich himself sometimes puts it just that way: "As being-itself God is beyond the contrast of essential and existential being."75 Despite appearances, then, Tillich and 74Ibid., 45. 75ST 1. 236.</page><page sequence="19">ROBERT R. N. ROSS 159 Aquinas are fundamentally in accord in asserting God's existence. IV For all of Tillich's apparent "atheism" and for all of Tillich's complaints about the conceptual incompatibility of "God" and "existence," it thus seems clear that Tillich is by no means intending to deny there is a God. While affirming that "God exists" may be theologically unsatisfying to Tillich, all the same, it does not follow that Tillich regards the statement "God does not exist" as true. Indeed, when Tillich tells us that "of course" there is that being which we call God, one suspects that for Tillich the idea that there might not be a God is literally inconceivable, and that the existence of God is simply the presupposition of Tillich's entire theology. For how could it be "conceivable" when it is said by Tillich that God is the "presupposition" of any question of God,76 or that the object of religion "can never itself be the object of doubt,"77 or, finally, that the very basis of man's being is "the God Whom he cannot flee . ..,"78 because "in every creature God is ... more present than the creature is to himself. .."79 Tillich makes the statement: "The scholastics were right when they asserted that in God there is no difference between essence and existence. But they perverted their insight when in spite of this assertion they spoke of the existence of God and tried to argue in favor of it."80 Just what, however, is it that Tillich thinks 76Tillich, "The Two Types of Philosophy of Religion," 13, 16. With this remark Tillich is not simply saying, as one commentator suggests, that "questions about God, if they are meaningful, must have their place in the language of a community in which the word 'God' has a meaningful use" (Edward Cell, Language, Existence, and God[Nashville: Abingdon, 1971] 48). That is, Tillich is not simply saying that (knowing the meaning of) the word "God" is the presupposition of the question of God. Rather, Tillich is asserting a much stronger thesis: namely, that the reality of God is a presupposition of that question. This is perhaps brought out more clearly elsewhere when Tillich says "an awareness of God is present in the question of God. This awareness precedes the question" (ST 1. 206, my emphasis). 77Paul Tillich, "The Philosophy of Religion," What Is Religion (ed.

I suggest it is this. If God, for Tillich, is something of which we must already be aware because, as being-itself, he is the "presupposition" of any possible question of his existence, then clearly to argue for his existence is not only perverse - indeed it is meaningless. But it is just this point - that discussion of the question of God's existence is meaningless - which Tillich often couples with his claim that God cannot be said to "exist." One finds Tillich saying, for example, that "the question of the existence of God can neither be asked nor answered. If it is asked ... the answer - whether negative or affirmative - implicitly denies the nature of God."8 Or again, "the discussions about the existence or non-existence of God [are] meaningless."82 What Tillich's claim that God's existence cannot be discussed amounts to is an attempt to separate the possibility of raising theological questions about God from the necessity of having to construct arguments for his existence. Yet there is more to this than simply the idea, also suggested by Aquinas, that we can (and must) know what the word "God" means before any attempt to prove his existence.83 Tillich insists that "the method of arguing through a conclusion . .. contradicts the idea of God"84 because, in Tillich's mind, once one even raises the question of God - viz., even a question about the meaning of the concept "God" - then the question of God's existence has, a priori, already been settled. How does this come about? Suppose we examine why Tillich takes the position of denying that the arguments for God's existence are really "arguments" after all. According to Tillich: "The arguments for the existence of God neither are arguments nor are they proof of the existence of God."85 They are not arguments, Tillich continues, because "they are expressions of the question of God which is implied in human finitude. This question is their truth; every answer they give is untrue. This is the sense in which theology must deal with these arguments, which are the solid body of any natural theology. It must deprive them of their argumentative character ..."86 Why does Tillich attach 81ST 1. 237. 82Tillich, Dynamics of Faith, 46. 83Aquinas, Summa Theologiae Ia.

N. ROSS 161 such significance to our being able to raise the "question" of God? In brief, the fact that the "question" of God should arise in our experience is significant because it reveals that we are already responsive to that which we are asking after. It reveals that we are already responsive to God, who, as being-itself, is the object of our ultimate concern. Tillich's analysis of what a question is invites certain comparisons with Heidegger which are useful. For both Heidegger and Tillich the question of "being" (for Tillich this is identical with "the question of God") is not just asking about something. It is also asking after (seeking) something because one is concerned with it. Heidegger makes the remark that "every asking is an asking after,"87 the point being that something that is asked "after" is an issue for us. It is a matter of concern for us. For Tillich, of course, the question of God is a question of our "ultimate concern." Heidegger begins with an analysis of Dasein, the entity we are. According to Heidegger,88 we are ontically distinctive in that we are "ontological." That is, we already possess some interpretation of being, we are responsive to being. Thus, if we can find out what we are responsive to, we find out what being-itself, the object of our concern, is. Tillich also begins with an analysis of ourselves and tells us that "man is the being who is able to ask questions."89 Similarly, for Tillich, if we can know what is at issue for man, we will discover what God (being-itself) is. To this end Tillich invites us to "think ... what it means to ask a question."90 Tillich's answer is worth quoting at length: It implies ... that we do not have that for which we ask. If we had it, we would not ask for it. But, in order to be able to ask for something, we must have it partially; otherwise it could not be the object of a question. He who asks has and has not at the same time. If man is that being who asks the question of being, he has and has not the being for which he asks. Certainly we belong to being - its power is in us - otherwise we would not be. But we are also separated from it; we do not possess it fully. Our power of being is limited ... This is precisely what is meant when we say 87Martin Heidegger, Being and Time (trans. John Macquarrie and Edward Robinson; New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1962) 24. 88Ibid., 32. 89Paul Tillich, Biblical Religion and the Searchfor Ultimate Reality (Phoenix Books; Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1955) 11. Indeed, ". . . man ... cannot avoid asking, because he belongs to the power of being..." (ibid., 12, my emphasis). 9Ibid., 11.</page><page sequence="22">162 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW that we are finite ... But man can and must ask; he cannot avoid asking, because he belongs to the power of being from which he is separated, and he knows both that he belongs to it and that he is separated from it.91 For Tillich, "being-itself" just is what we discover to be of ultimate concern for ourselves. On the other hand, we also learn what we are - what man is - when we know what is of ultimate concern for us. This circularity92 is important, because for Tillich (as for Heidegger) the first step in any ontological inquiry is to remember what has "passed into forgetfulness" - i.e., to remember what has become hidden from ourselves. In the case of Tillich, we must remember that what is at stake for us is also the question of being-itself, the question of God. But this can only mean, according to Tillich, that we are already moved, stirred, by our ultimate concern. It means that we already in part "belong," as Tillich puts it, to God - to the "power of being" from which we are estranged but which, nevertheless, is also already present in us. It is in this way, I believe, that Tillich regards our having raised the question of God as already, in a sense, settling the matter of his reality. For once we become aware of the fact that the question of the nature of God, who is being-itself, is ontologically bound up with the question of the nature of ourselves, then we see that God is that being of the reality of which it is impossible not to be aware, even though we cannot fully comprehend his nature. The task of ontological inquiry is to bring this awareness out of its "hiddenness." But it cannot be to establish the reality of that after which we seek. For its reality - the reality of being-itself - has already been established by the fact of our "seeking." Once we can get ourselves to the point of framing the ontological question - What is being-itself? - we have reached the point of awareness of that which is the presupposition of our having been able to raise the question at all.93 This must be part of what motivates Tillich's perplexing statement: "The question of God is possible because an awareness of God is present in the question of God. This awareness precedes the question. It is not the result of the argument but its presupposition."94 When we come to ask the question which is of 91Ibid., 11-12. 92Note, e.g., that Tillich employs the same term "power of being" to refer both to God and to the power of being in us. 93Cf. ST 1. 163. 94ST 1. 206.</page><page sequence="23">ROBERT R. N. ROSS 163 "ultimate concern" to us - a question Tillich claims we cannot avoid asking - what we discover is that we already in part "have" that which we are asking after. For the subject of the awareness which "precedes" the question - making the question possible - is precisely the God to whom we are already responsive. But if this is true, then it becomes clear that Tillich's remark "God does not exist" must be regarded as entirely gratuitous. Far from saying what it appears to say, it only masks the sense in which the existence of God is the underlying assumption of Tillich's entire theology. But what is perhaps even more disturbing is the ease with which Tillich moves from denying the applicability of the concept of existence of God to ruling out as meaningless the possibility of discussing the question of God's existence at all. Insofar as Tillich's suggestion that the concept of existence is inadequate for God becomes a move to heighten our awareness of God's otherness, then at least one can appreciate Tillich's intention, if not his execution. However, when the move begins to look more like an attempt simply to eliminate any possibility of intelligibly discussing the question of God's existence at all, then the situation looks more ominous. When Tillich tells us that an awareness of God precedes any question of his existence,95 what this means, I suggest, is that with respect to the question of whether there is a God, Tillich regards the question as meaningless only because he has already begged the question. That is, one cannot sensibly raise the question of God's existence because of the assumption by Tillich that it is a necessary feature of any concept of God that we should always have an awareness of God. But since this awareness, as Tillich says, always "precedes" any question of God's existence, the question of whether God exists is rendered "meaningless" only because Tillich has assumed there is just one possible answer to it even before it is asked. It might be said, then, that Tillich is offering some form of argument which runs: if one properly understands the concept "God" as meaning "that being which is always present in human awareness," then it is senseless to raise the question of God's existence because it is senseless to raise such a question about that of which it is impossible not to be aware. That Tillich does mean to be doing something like this is perhaps most explicit in an early work where he says: 95ST 1. 206.</page><page sequence="24">164 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW It is meaningless to ask ... whether the Unconditional "exists,".. For the question whether the Unconditional exists presupposes already ... that which exists unconditionally. The certainty of the Unconditional is the grounding certainty from which all doubt can proceed, but it can never itself be the object of doubt. Therefore the object of religion is not only real, but is also the presupposition of every affirmation of reality.96 Tillich has built into his concept of God the necessity of our awareness of God, and it is as a result of this that he regards it as senseless to raise the question of God's existence. Tillich, however, has not shown the question of God's existence to be meaningless, nor does anything he says about how we must conceive the nature of God make it meaningless. Given a concept of God from which it necessarily follows that one cannot "escape" the awareness of God's presence in his life, one can see the force of the suggestion that the existence of God cannot be discussed. Yet it is, I believe, still an intelligible response to say (or simply admit) that one just does not share any such awareness - that one does not have it. Moreover, while one may grant that, if there is a God, it may be necessary that one should have awareness of him, one can still raise the question: "But is there such a God?" For it is a rule of logic that from (x) (Fx4 Gx) one cannot infer (9x) (Fx).97 That is, from "If something is God, then God is that of which one must be aware" it does not follow that there is a God of whom we must be aware. Tillich's making the necessity of our awareness of God a property of God, as it were, does not alter the basic problem that has been thought to render such an argument invalid - namely, that one cannot infer the fact of something's existence from any property intrinsic to its concept. In Tillich's case, I believe discussions of God's existence turn out to be pointless, because he has reduced the situation to that in which one can only deny he has an awareness another claims. There is, in other words, no "room" for discussion. For ultimately, it is not the question.,of whether God exists that is unintelligible, but rather the circumstances under which Tillich thinks that discussion must take place. The discussion is pointless, because in Tillich's presentation of the issue it turns out 96Tillich, "The Philosophy of Religion," 71. 97See, e.g., G. E. M. Anscombe, An Introduction to Wittgenstein's Tractatus (Harper Torchbooks; 2d ed., revised; New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1959) 15.</page><page sequence="25">ROBERT R. N. ROSS 165 that there is no room for one who acknowledges God's presence and one who denies it to differ with each other - to have any basis on which to differ. By reducing the question of God's existence to the situation where one can only deny he has an awareness of something another claims he must have, the two parties will simply be unintelligible to each other. There is one aspect of Tillich's claim that we cannot discuss the existence of God - as if we were discussing the existence of some finite object - that seems right and even useful, insofar as it is true that people actually do believe God is an infinitely superior but ultimately finite thing. It is right insofar as people do confuse belief in God with idolatry and treat God as "a partner with whom one collaborates or as a superior power whom one influences by rites and prayers."'98 That would be an "insult to the divine holiness,"99 for one would not be believing in God if one believed that. One would be believing in "a nothing." On the other hand, Tillich's claim that God's existence cannot be "discussed" also derives from a position which, while it denies the possibility of constructing any argument for God's existence, at the same time, constantly makes theological assertions which presuppose it. Yet this position, I suggest, clearly weakens the apologetic task Tillich sees himself as trying to fulfill. The question "Is there a God?" is intelligible because both answers to it are intelligible. Furthermore, both answers are intelligible whether one shares another's awareness or not. Tillich has not given us any independent argument showing how the awareness of God must be shared. Nevertheless, it is clear that Tillich believes that a religious awareness of God is in some way intrinsic to every member of the human species. Tillich says, e.g., that even though it may not be our intention to have this religious awareness, "there is no consciousness unreligious in substance ... Every act of self-apprehension contains, as its foundation within reality, the relation to the Unconditional ... Objectively considered, all consciousness is related to God " . .00 But if an awareness of God is in some way intrinsic to everyone, then all the Christian apologist need do is to point out to the unbeliever what he has possessed all along. 98ST 1. 272. 99ST 1. 271-72. 0O'Paul Tillich, "The Conquest of the Concept of Religion in the Philosophy of Religion," What Is Religion?(ed.

In short, for Tillich there can simply be no atheism, as it is generally understood. What is substituted for it, by implication, is the notion that in a curious way "disbelief" is identical with "inhumanity." Precisely for this reason, however, Tillich's tendency to regard religious awareness of God as somehow intrinsic to every member of the human race has the effect of merely insulating the question of God's existence from criticism. But the attempt to insulate the question of God's existence from criticism in this way is wrong. For the answer which denies there is a God (as well as that which affirms it) is an intelligible position even within religious discourse, and when someone stops believing in God, it may not be because he has just not understood the concept of God "correctly." '01"It is the religious function of atheism ever to remind us that the religious act has to do with the unconditioned transcendent, and that the representations of the Unconditioned are not objects concerning whose 'existence' or 'non- existence' a discussion would be possible." Paul Tillich, Religi6se Verwirklichung (Berlin: Furche, 1929) 102, quoted in James Luther Adams, Paul Tillich's Philosophy of Culture, Science, and Religion, 247.</page></plain_text>
