Goodpaster Published online: 17 January 2012 © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012 Abstract If we read the central message of Caritas in Veritate (CV) through the lens of contemporary business ethics - and the encyclical does seem to invite such a reading (CV 40-41, and 45-47) - there is first of all a diagnosis of a crisis. Then, we are offered a response to the diagnosis: charity in truth , "the principle around which the Church's social doctrine turns, a principle that takes on practical form in the criteria that govern moral action ." (CV 6) In business ethics, the norms of personal and (especially) corporate responsibility are the natural corre- lates to "the criteria that govern moral action." Using this as a point of departure, I propose to relate some recent scholarship in business ethics to the message of CV - with the suggestion that there is significant convergence. I argue, further, that the encyclical breaks new ground with its suggestion that, at the center of our moral thinking in business ethics lies a logic of contribution or gift. I discuss Benedict's understanding of the crisis, and his exhortation to reach beyond conventional interpretations of corporate responsibility, under the following four headings: Diag- nosing a Crisis , Institutionalizing Conscience , A Tripartite View of Corporate Responsibility , and Comprehensive Moral Thinking.

Goodpaster (El) David and Barbara Koch Endowed Chair in Business Ethics, Ethics and Business Law Department, University of St. Thomas, Minneapolis, MN, USA e-mail : kegoodpaster @ stthomas.edu It is clear that today the problem is not only one of supplying people with a sufficient quantity of goods, but also of responding to a demand for quality: the quality of the goods to be produced and consumed, the quality of the services to be enjoyed, the quality of the environment and of life in general. John Paul II (1991, p. 36)' Introduction2 We often refer to the economic or commercial sector in society as the sector that "provides goods and services." Yet, business behavior in recent decades has caused us to question whether the goods are truly good (hazardous consumer products, violent and sexually explicit video games, unhealthy foods, and fuel-inefficient automobiles) and whether we are really being well-served (scandals in accounting, deceptive credit card practices, Ponzi schemes in investments, and greed in mortgage finance). Caritas in Veritate (CV) (Benedict XVI 2009), echoing the social encyclical by John Paul II's Centesimus Annus , 20 years earlier, offers to all persons of goodwill an insightful extended meditation on the kind of political economy that is urgently needed for our contemporary globalized world. Caritas in Veritate is a "wake-up call" in the aftermath of a crisis, unlike Centesimus Annus , which was a forward- looking caution for a "victorious" free market system. Benedict XVI sees in the current economic crisis "an opportunity for discernment, in which to shape a new vision for the future." (CV 21) CV is an appeal based on 1 This and other encyclical letters mentioned here are available online in www.vatican.va. 2 This article is an invited contribution for this special issue. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="2">10 К. E. Goodpaster faith and reason - an appeal for integral human develop- ment "of the whole man and of all men."3 (CV 8) It is a plea for goods that are truly good and services that truly serve. Diagnosing a Crisis The development of societies depends on three broad institutional subsystems, and all three are featured in CV. These subsystems, following Michael Novak, are the eco- nomic subsystem (markets, corporations, and a commercial logic of exchange), the political subsystem (laws, regula- tions, and a state logic of public obligation), and the "moral-cultural" subsystem (family, education, religion, media, with a fraternal logic of "gift" or contribution) (Novak 1991, pp. 56-57) (see Fig. 1). Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, through the globalization of the 1990s, the scandals of Enron, Arthur Andersen, and WorldCom, and most recently in the financial markets, driven by the mortgage crisis - the deficiencies of capitalism have been substantial. They have even called into question the cre- dentials of the free market economic subsystem - espe- cially in relation to the need for authentic human development (material and spiritual).4 The encyclical points out that we cannot rely on the economic subsystem alone for a positive unfolding of globalization and integral human development.5 The eco- nomic subsystem has shown itself to be untrustworthy: "Without internal forms of solidarity and mutual trust, the market cannot completely fulfill its proper economic function. And today it is this trust which has ceased to exist, and the loss of trust is a grave loss." (CV 35) But adding the political subsystem affords insufficient conso- lation: "the exclusively binary model of market-plus-State is corrosive of society, while economic forms based on solidarity, which find their natural home in civil society without being restricted to it, build up society." (CV 39) A widely quoted article in business ethics, "The Parable of the Sadhu," describes a Wall Street executive who (by his own acknowledgment) lost his sense of humanity on a Himalayan mountain-climbing expedition (McCoy 1983). Because his group was concerned to reach the summit, he left a holy man that they had found, a sadhu, to die on the slope. Later he lamented, "Why were we so reluctant to try 3 The use of "man" and "men" in a gender-neutral way continues to be the convention in encyclical letters. 4 Paul VI indicates that the essential quality of "authentic" devel- opment is that it must be "integral, that is, it has to promote the good of every man and of the whole man." (1967, p. 14, cf CV 18). 5 Benedict writes: "What the Church's social doctrine has always sustained, on the basis of its vision of man and society, is corroborated today by the dynamics of globalization." (CV 39). Fig. 1 Three intersecting systems of society the lower path, the ambiguous trail? Perhaps because we did not have a leader who could reveal the greater purpose of the trip to us." This parable offers us a way to appreciate the diagnosis of the economic crisis. The pursuit of the objective of reaching the summit is allowed by the climbers to override the unequivocal human need that they met at 18,000 feet. There was a fixation on reaching the summit, a rationali- zation of continuing on ("We did our bit") and eventually a kind of detachment or acceptance of the way in which the sadhu was treated.6 There are several passages in CV where the character- istics of fixation, rationalization, and detachment are part of the diagnosis of our economic crisis, often in the context of allowing objectives like maximization of profit, consoli- dation of power, or the findings of research technology to "entrance" us, blinding us to authentic responses to human development: • Once profit becomes the exclusive goal, if it is produced by improper means and without the common good as its ultimate end, it risks destroying wealth and creating poverty (CV 21). • When technology is allowed to take over, the result is confusion between ends and means, such that the sole criterion for action in business is thought to be the maximization of profit, in politics the consolidation of power, and in science the findings of research (CV 71). • Entranced by an exclusive reliance on technology , reason without faith is doomed to flounder in an illusion of its own omnipotence. Faith without reason risks being cut off from everyday life (CV 74, emphasis in original). Personal and corporate responsibility are at risk when- ever they fail to appreciate the task of promoting the true 6 See Goodpaster (2007a) where fixation, rationalization, and detachment are described and developed. â Springer / Moral- ' I Cultural ' 1 System J j Economic [ j Political ] I System ' J System J</page><page sequence="3">Goods That are Truly Good and Services 1 1 good of the whole person: " There cannot be holistic development and universal common good unless people's spiritual and moral welfare is taken into account , consid- ered in their totality as body and soul." (CV 76) The "goods and services" that often drive our economic and political subsystems can be counterfeit, uncritical surro- gates for goods that are truly good and services that truly serve. The central feature of this diagnosis is a kind of reductionism, a "settling for less" by fixating on goods that fall short of authenticity. There are no doubt times when the institutions (and "logics") of the economic and political subsystems can and should press back against criticism from the moral-cultural subsystem, such as when the cultural institutions (and "logics") of a society have become corrupted by prejudice and hatred (Nazi Germany in the 1930s). But corruption can be evident in economic and political subsystems as well, and when this happens, one can hope that the moral- cultural subsystem - in this context, through the exhorta- tions of the Church - will speak out in the public square with an appropriate critique. Institutionalizing Conscience There can be no question that the economic challenges of the twenty-first century call for conscience on the part of individual persons making decisions. And it is clear from CV that conscience is not to be understood as relativists would have us understand it. "The truth of ourselves, of our personal conscience, is first of all given to us." (CV 34) Conscience in the individual means charity in truth.7 The nature of that truth is implied later: "Development is impossible without upright men and women, without financiers and politicians whose consciences are finely attuned to the requirements of the common good." (CV 71) And the requirements of the common good are not defined simply by markets and ballot boxes: "God reveals man to himself; reason and faith work hand in hand to demonstrate to us what is good, provided we want to see it; the natural law... reveals our greatness, but also our wretchedness insofar as we fail to recognize the call to moral truth." (CV 75) This being said, there can also be no question that economic decision makers exercise their influence in and through organizations - institutional structures. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine human history without a proliferation 7 "In every cognitive process, truth is not something that we produce; it is always found, or better, received." (CV 34) Later we are warned "While the poor of the world continue knocking on the doors of the rich, the world of affluence runs the risk of no longer hearing those knocks, on account of a conscience that can no longer distinguish what is human." (CV 75). of institutional forms, beginning with the family, but continuing with voluntary associations, economic enter- prises, municipalities, and larger governmental and non- governmental units (provincial, national, and eventually transnational).8 We might say in a phrase reminiscent of Aristotle that "man is an institution-making animal." Attention to personal responsibility alone is not enough for understanding (and influencing) marketplace dynamics. The actors on the global stage include both individuals and organizations (enterprises). We live our lives in an insti- tutionalized environment. Institutionalization and techno- logical sophistication walk hand-in-hand with globalization as distinctive characteristics of our twenty-first century world. Therefore, even though CV talks of conscience with primary reference to the individual, the idea of "corporate conscience" is analogically useful for understanding what Peter Drucker called a society of organizations (Drucker 1994). The idea that organizations can be seen as macro-ver- sions of individuals is at least as old as Plato's Republic . It has been applied not only to the descriptive meaningfulness of corporate attributes, but also to the normative respon- sibility of leaders to cultivate corporate virtues (Goodpaster 1997, p. 141) Philip Selznick, in his classic Leadership in Administration , described institutional character by draw- ing upon the analogy with individual personality: The study of institutions is in some ways comparable to the clinical study of personality. It requires a genetic and developmental approach, an emphasis on historical origins and growth stages. There is a need to see the enterprise as a whole and to see how it is transformed as new ways of dealing with a changing environment evolve (Selznick 1957, p. 141). Exploring the analogical predication of human traits to institutions need not entail careless anthropomorphism. Business research has been enriched by exploring the parallels between individual psychology and the attributes of organizations. Indeed, the idea of "corporate con- science" is firmly anchored in the literature of business ethics and CSR (Goodpaster 1982).9 8 Alexis de Tocqueville marveled in the mid-nineteenth Century at the American cultural tendency to multiply "voluntary associations" in response to various social needs - associations that are neither public sector nor private sector. See de Tocqueville 2000, Part Two, Chap. 5, pp. 489-492). 9 Also see Goodpaster (2007b), Chaps. 2 and 4. Harvard's Lynn Sharp Paine concurs: "A company, as a moral actor in society, has commitments, values, and responsibilities, such as duties to its lenders or contractual obligations to its customers that are distinct from those of its individual members. These corporate responsibilities survive even when a company's individual members and agents change." (2003, p. 145). 4^ Springer</page><page sequence="4">12 К. E. Goodpaster Shaping the "conscience of a corporation" calls for both external and internal initiatives. Externally , society places legal, regulatory, and reputational constraints on corpora- tions to influence their behavior, reducing the risk of harm to those affected (employees, consumers, suppliers, and local communities). Internally , corporate conscience (like personal conscience) means managing an organization's integrity, its shared cultural norms, values, and expecta- tions that guide decision making.10 Corporate leaders must place moral considerations in a position of salience and authority alongside considerations of strategy, marketing, and finance in an organization's pursuit of its mission. They must also communicate the spirit of this effort to future leaders of the organization and to the surrounding network of institutions that make up the social system. Leaders who act as architects of corporate conscience accomplish this work through mission state- ments, codes of conduct, ethics officers, employee educa- tion, recruitment and promotion practices, succession planning, and other forms of cultural influence. As with individual persons, an organization's character formation can lead to a fundamental revision of its understanding of success. For every organization must inevitably confront Charles Handy' s fundamental question: "Whom and what is a business for?" The purpose of a business... is not to make a profit, full stop. It is to make a profit so that the business can do something more or better. That "something" becomes the real justification for the business. Owners know this. Investors need not care (2002, p. 51).n Handy's observation aligns well with the spirit of CV: "Charity in truth ... requires that shape and structure be given to those types of economic initiative which, without rejecting profit, aim at a higher goal than the mere logic of the exchange of equivalents, of profit as an end in itself." (CV 38) The "something" to which Handy refers (and the "higher goal" to which Benedict refers) must ultimately contribute to authentic human development as communi- cated through "the fundamental norms of the natural moral 10 Caritas in Ventate calls this pursuit "the institutional path - we might also call it the political path - of charity, no less excellent and effective than the kind of charity which encounters the neighbor directly, outside the institutional mediation of the polis." (CV 7). 1 1 Handy also affirms: "We cannot escape the fundamental question, whom and what is a business for? The answer once seemed clear, but no longer. The terms of business have changed. Ownership has been replaced by investment, and a company's assets are increasingly found in its people, not in its buildings and machinery. In light of this transformation, we need to rethink our assumptions about the purpose of business." (2002, p. 51). law which God has written on our hearts. "(CV 68)12 The task of the leader is to clarify and sustain, but most importantly to institutionalize the core values of the orga- nization - mindful of its mission - its contribution - to human dignity and the common good. This task extends beyond the conventional logics of marketplace success and legal compliance (Goodpaster 2011). Personal virtue and responsibility is essential for the cultural renewal to which we are called, but it is not suf- ficient. The renewal must be institutional as well as per- sonal, fostering conscience in the corporation. This requires external constraints on market activities from the public sector, but it also requires an internal transformation of decision making in private sector organizations - a new "logic of contribution (or gift)." The conscience of the corporation calls for its leaders to advance its contribution - its gift - to the larger commu- nity. The language and logic of contribution, of gratuity, of gift - is a language and logic that calls for discerning what is best for human persons - goods that are truly good and services that truly serve. A Tripartite View of Corporate Responsibility Many interpretations of corporate responsibility use a version of "stakeholder thinking" as shorthand for "ethical thinking in business." Commentators often point out that publicly held business organizations need to move beyond a preoccupation with stockholders and guide their behavior with attention to all stakeholders , parties whose interests and/or rights are affected by corporate decision making. Typically these parties include - in addition to owner/ investors - employees, customers, suppliers, competitors, local communities, and "the environment." Some argue for the displacement of stockholder thinking by stakeholder thinking, while others insist upon retaining both perspec- tives in a somewhat dualistic relationship. Caritas in Veritate sometimes seems to suggest a stakeholder view, but I believe this interpretation may be premature: There is... a growing conviction that business man- agement cannot concern itself only with the interests of the proprietors, but must also assume responsibil- ity for all the other stakeholders who contribute to the life of the business: the workers, the clients, the suppliers of various elements of production, the community of reference. (CV 40) 12 See Paul's Letter to the Romans , 2:14 ff. (Bible). For an extended discussion of conscience, both theologically and philosophically, see Ratzinger (1991). Ratzinger is today Pope Benedict XVI. â Springer</page><page sequence="5">Goods That are Truly Good and Services 13 Moving beyond stockholder thinking to stakeholders is surely a salutary step in the direction of forming a con- science for the corporation, but it is not sufficient.13 Nor is it finally the view that Benedict XVI is recommending in CV. For, there is more to institutionalizing ethical values in the marketplace than satisfying the wants and needs of multiple constituencies. The pursuit of stakeholder satis- faction is no more immune to moral critique than the pursuit of stockholder satisfaction - if the satisfactions in question fail to embrace the true good of the human person. Indeed, Caritas in Ventate helps us to appreciate that we risk losing something essential if we simply stop at stakeholder thinking in our account of corporate responsibility.14 The fact that stakeholder thinking often reveals what is ethically lacking in a preoccupation with profit-making obligations to stockholders does not mean that it is the last word on business ethics or corporate responsibility. For, while it is a cliché to say that "the customer is always right," we know that market demand can be as strong for pornography as it is for public education. And while employee well-being is a positive business concern, we know that sometimes labor union demands are unreason- able. Finally, while environmental protection is essential, it often carries significant social costs. In each of these examples, we can see that the test of stakeholder satisfac- tion can miss morally relevant information (Goodpaster 2010). For these reasons, I have argued for a tripartite model of corporate responsibility, rather than a dualistic one (see Fig. 2). Stakeholder thinking is an advance upon the narrow construction of corporate responsibility that limits it to a fiduciary duty to providers of capital (stockholders, own- ers). But while managing their relationships with multiple interested parties, corporations can overlook the challenges of participation in a global human community and their obligations to foster authentic human development. The different aspects of the crisis, its solutions, and any new development that the future may bring, are increasingly interconnected, they imply one another, they require new efforts of holistic understanding and a new humanistic synthesis. (CV 21) In 1991, John Paul II, in Centesimus Annus ,15 insisted that economic systems need to be guided by "a 13 I have argued more fully elsewhere that conventional appeals to "stakeholder thinking" are useful, but insufficient for an adequate account of corporate conscience (Goodpaster 2009). 14 See CV 34, CV 40, CV 51, CV 61, and CV 64-67 for examples of moral critique applied to stakeholder groups, such as consumers, employees, investors, managers, and the environment. 15 "Of itself, an economic system does not possess criteria for correctly distinguishing new and higher forms of satisfying human Comprehensive Moral Thinking / Stakeholder J ' ' ' J Stockholder 1 J J Fig. 2 Tripartite model of corporate responsibility comprehensive picture of man which respects all the dimensions of his being and which subordinates his material and instinctive dimensions to his interior and spiritual ones."(CV 36) Benedict XVI, in Caritas in Veritate , echoes this conviction: "The truth of development consists in its completeness: if it does not involve the whole man and every man, it is not true development" (CV 18). Too often, stakeholder thinking accepts at face value the interests and claims of various stakeholder groups inde- pendently - in isolation from one another - without con- sidering their deeper connections as part of the larger human community. And unless it is embedded in a "comprehensive" view of humanity, the stakeholder model can fail to consider each stakeholder as a person, sub- ordinating "his material and instinctive dimensions to his interior and spiritual ones," (John Paul II). Ordinary met- rics of stakeholder consideration can overlook what Ben- edict XVI calls the fulfillment of "the whole man and every man."16 Responsibility includes looking at the economic sub- system as a whole in order to fully appreciate its Footnote 15 continued needs from artificial new needs which hinder the formation of a mature personality. Thus, a great deal of educational and cultural work is urgently needed, including the education of consumers in the responsible use of their power of choice, the formation of a strong sense of responsibility among producers and among people in the mass media in particular, as well as the necessary intervention by public authorities." (John Paul II 1991, p. 36). 16 Benedict cites Paul VI in Populorum Progressio : "The ultimate goal is a full-bodied humanism. And does this not mean the fulfillment of the whole man and of every mani A narrow humanism, closed in on itself and not open to the values of the spirit and to God who is their source, could achieve apparent success, for man can set about organizing terrestrial realities without God." (Emphasis added) (Paul VI 1967, p. 14). ^ Springer</page><page sequence="6">14 К. E. Goodpaster implications for human life. Just as democracy as a polit- ical subsystem can be dysfunctional if the voters are poorly educated or poorly informed, so too the market subsystem can become dysfunctional if producers, consumers, inves- tors and other stakeholders fail to appreciate one another's full humanity. Business leaders must guide corporations with a more robust mindset than the duality that has guided them in the past: stockholder thinking versus stakeholder thinking. Such an expanded mindset implies a tripartite view of corporate responsibility. The third (and key) element of the tripartite view is "comprehensive moral thinking" - which means expanding both the subject and the object of cor- porate responsibility. Without comprehensive moral thinking, we cannot discern goods that are truly good and services that truly serve. Comprehensive Moral Thinking In the "Tripartite Model," comprehensive moral thinking includes two elements: 1) Attention to the possibility of private sector collabo- ration with other institutions (e.g., governments or non-governmental organizations); and 2) Attention to human dignity and the just community as overarching social ideals that may exceed the reach of conventional approaches to stakeholder satisfaction. Our economic future calls for significant attention to both of these elements. The imperative to collaborate stems from the increasing complexity of institutional problems facing our global society, from the recent finan- cial crisis to environmental protection and more. Compa- nies are increasingly called upon to expand their ethical attention beyond their normally accepted spans of influence and control (pollution, immigration reform, discrimina- tion). Even if certain problems cannot be solved solely by corporate initiatives, such problems may still call on the consciences of business leaders to collaborate with gov- ernments or community groups. Even if a company does not have a responsibility to resolve the moral challenge on its own, it can still have a conditional responsibility to make an effort - to participate in the efforts of others in seeking a collaborative resolution.17 CV indicates the source of this collaborative imperative: The development of peoples depends, above all, on a recognition that the human race is a single family working together in true communion, not simply a group of subjects who happen to live side by side. (CV 53) 17 "Ought categorically" implies "can" - but "ought conditionally" simply implies "can try." It may be tempting for a video game company to dis- claim responsibility for negative social effects on youth because other factors also contribute (e.g., parents, TV networks, and Hollywood). But is this a satisfactory response? Is there not an obligation to make an effort to collaborate with other institutions (governments, competi- tors, and nongovernment organizations) for the sake of the common good? There are many examples that illustrate this challenge, including escalating consumer debt, and appropriate levels of direct foreign investment by more developed countries in developing countries. Comprehen- sive moral thinking is evident when corporate boards and industry leaders ask questions: • About the full effects of a company's products on society or the environment, from production through recycling; • About the desirability of operations that reinforce dysfunctional consumer habits (e.g., spending beyond resources, driving and texting, and tobacco advertising outside the U.S.); • About sourcing policies (e.g., encouraging harm or rights violations in connection with coffee and cacao farming, and pesticide sales); • About employment policies (honoring workers' physi- cal and emotional safety, but also affirming spiritual practices, providing meditation rooms, encouraging interfaith understanding) and community involvement (enterprise zones where there is poverty and high unemployment, support of education, and environmen- tal protection). Resolving such challenges, associated with consumers, suppliers, and employees often calls for collaborative efforts with industry associations and with non-business institutions (NGOs or government agencies representing credit counseling, public health, and safety, "fair trade" practices, religious leaders, taxing authorities, public and private school associations, and environmental groups). Comprehensive moral thinking asks business leaders to discern opportunities for collaboration and to respond affirmatively to invitations to collaborate. It invites busi- nesses to look at their roles not solely in insular economic terms, but also in social or civic terms. Companies and industries on this view have stockholders and stakeholders, to be sure, but they also have vocations to participate in realistic ways with other institutions in building a better world, in fostering what Benedict describes as authentic human development (CV 11). If we consider the proposition: "Corporations are responsible for their stakeholders," comprehensive moral thinking can be understood as expanding and enriching both its subject and its object. The expansion and enrich- ment of the subject calls for collaboration with other Springer</page><page sequence="7">Goods That are Truly Good and Services 15 Fig. 3 Corporations [subject] are responsible for their stakeholders [object] responsible parties, shifting from "Business alone is responsible" to "Business is responsible together with the state and other institutions (family, school, media, church)," even if no one of these institutions can accom- plish the common good alone. The expansion and enrich- ment of the object calls for more than the satisfaction of multiple stakeholders.18 (See Fig. 3) Regarding compre- hensive moral responsibility (shared by individuals and institutions according to their capacities), the encyclical emphasizes the importance of balancing two fundamental principles: The principle of subsidiarity must remain closely linked to the principle of solidarity and vice versa, since the former without the latter gives way to social privatism, while the latter without the former gives way to paternalist social assistance that is demeaning to those in need. (CV 58)19 The principle of subsidiarity is anchored in a bedrock belief in the dignity of the human person. In organizational settings, this means according respect to intermediate subgroups as well as individuals, and avoiding unnecessary centralization of authority (Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace 2004, pp. 186-203). The principle of solidarity 18 "In an increasingly globalized society, the common good and the effort to obtain it cannot fail to assume the dimensions of the whole human family, that is to say, the community of peoples and nations, in such a way as to shape the earthly city in unity and peace, rendering it to some degree an anticipation and a préfiguration of the undivided city of God." (CV 7). 19 Definitions within Caritas in Ve rítate: "Subsidiarity is first and foremost a form of assistance to the human person via the autonomy of intermediate bodies. Such assistance is offered when individuals or groups are unable to accomplish something on their own, and it is always designed to achieve their emancipation, because it fosters freedom and participation through assumption of responsibility." (CV 57) " Solidarity is first and foremost a sense of responsibility on the part of everyone with regard to everyone." (CV 38) [It is clear from the context that solidarity is meant to include responsibility of developed countries for less developed countries.]. is anchored in fidelity to social justice and the common good, but it avoids the kind of statism that stifles creativity and innovation. One central message of CV is that unless individuals and institutions embrace these two guiding ideals, our world will not achieve the "profound cultural renewal" needed to build a better future (CV 21). Expanding and enriching the subject of corporate responsibility means thinking more collaboratively in addressing social needs, not shrinking from partnership with governmental and nongovernmental sectors. Expanding and enriching the object of corporate responsibility means that corporate leaders must embrace principles of subsidiarity and solidarity as they seek goods that are truly good and services that truly serve.20 Conclusion: A Bold Challenge As we conclude these reflections on CV, there is an aspect of "comprehensive moral thinking" that is worth revisit- ing, since it poses a bold challenge to conventional busi- ness ethics. As we have seen, Benedict XVI cites the encyclical Populorum Progressio by Paul VI, which urges that in the delivery of goods and services, economic institutions embrace a "full-bodied" rather than a "nar- row" humanism that is "closed in on itself and not open to the values of the spirit and to God who is their source." (Paul VI 1967, p. 42) The implication is that a purely materialistic view of humankind is insufficient, especially for a global economy.21 Such a conviction may not seem surprising coming from the leader of the largest Christian community in the world, but it is presented in the public square to "all people of good will," not simply as a private message to Catholics.22 It challenges those who reflect on ethics, markets, and business organizations to consider seriously their assumptions about human happiness and human communities. 20 Laying a responsibility with the magnitude of authentic human development at the feet of corporations surely requires expanding (through collaboration) the co-responsible parties. 21 "The risk for our time is that the de facto interdependence of people and nations is not matched by ethical interaction of consciences and minds that would give rise to truly human development. Only in charity , illumined by the light of reason and faith , is it possible to pursue development goals that possess a more humane and humanizing value." (CV 9). 22 "[The Church] has a public role over and above her charitable and educational activities: all the energy she brings to the advancement of humanity and of universal fraternity is manifested when she is able to operate in a climate of freedom. In not a few cases, that freedom is impeded by prohibitions and persecutions, or it is limited when the Church's public presence is reduced to her charitable activities alone." (CV 11). Springer</page><page sequence="8">16 К. E. Goodpaster What is the significance of a spiritual perspective on humankind in the management of public, private, and moral-cultural institutions? Can recent business scandals and the economic crisis be fully understood (and avoided in the future) without understanding the mindsets or world- views of those whose decisions gave rise to them? Does one's practical view of "goods that are truly good and services that truly serve" depend importantly on one's view of human nature and human destiny - on one's con- ception of wealth, material acquisition, debt, fiduciary duty, and social justice? Josiah Royce, writing at the end of the nineteenth cen- tury, insisted that all of ethics was grounded in what he called the moral insight (a gateway to what later philoso- phers have called the "moral point of view"). Royce described the moral insight as "the realization of one's neighbor," a release from the illusion that one's neighbor is unreal or less worthy of consideration than oneself, the "illusion of selfishness." (Royce 1885, pp. 155-156) A natural institutional analogue to Royce' s discussion of a self-centered "illusion" is a publicly traded company that is preoccupied with the economic interests of its own shareholders.23 And a plausible organizational interpreta- tion of Royce' s "realization of one's neighbor" is stake- holder consideration on the part of management. But what is it to "realize" one's neighbor? A normative view in business ethics (what philosophers call a theory of the right) is not comprehensive if it fails to offer a vision of human wellbeing (what philosophers call a theory of the good). CV asks both practitioners and scholars in business ethics to think more deeply about authentic human devel- opment and to appreciate not only its material but also its spiritual aspects: As society becomes ever more globalized, it makes us neighbors but does not make us brothers. Reason, by itself, is capable of grasping the equality between men and of giving stability to their civic coexistence, but it cannot establish fraternity. This originates in a transcendent vocation from God the Father, who loved us first, teaching us through the Son what fra- ternal charity is. (CV 19) (Emphasis added.) Our institution-building must maintain a line of sight to a deeper view of human fulfillment and human relation- ships. As McCoy said in the Parable of the Sadhu , we need leaders who can reveal to their organizations "the greater purpose of the trip." Perhaps in CV, Benedict XVI has modeled this kind of leadership for the rest of us. 23 In the case of private or closely-held firms, the analogue might be preoccupation by management with the interests of the controlling group or family.
