<plain_text><page sequence="1">HENRY JAMES'S "THE STORY IN IT" AND GABRIELE D'ANNUNZIO rrfir Adeline R. Tintner "THE STORY In It" (1900) marks a serious alteration in James's work in that now he no longer judges an affair between a man and a woman, "the 'great' relation," moralistically. Written a few months before The Ambassadors, "The Story In It" appears to reflect a change in James's own relation to love. Edel speculates that James's feelings for Henrik Andersen, whom he met in Rome the summer of 1899, were the prob able source for such a change. Be that as it may, in "The Story In It" a decent woman is having a passionate relation with a married man, and no judgmental attitude is assumed. The Golden Bowl was to continue this new attitude toward the "good woman" involved in adultery in the character of Charlotte Stant and to show sympathy for her doomed suf fering, like that of Madame de Vionnet, her predecessor. There is an interesting consanguinity between the tiny capsule story, "The Story In It," The Ambassadors, and The Golden Bowl of three years later that this paper attempts to explain through a clue which James offers to the reader of the short story. That clue is the word "D'Annunzio." It is revealed on the third page of the story, when Maud Blessingbourne, a young widow with a tendency to find romance in French novels rather than in life, is asked by Mrs. Dyott, her friend and hostess, "And are they the only ones you Modern Fiction Studies, Volume 28, Number 2, Summer 1982.

Her friend answers, "And what is that?"1 The reader of the story of James's day would surely be amused by the provinciality of Mrs. Dyott, who had never heard of D'An nunzio. For by 1900 the thirty-seven-year-old D'Annunzio had written his most successful novels: II Piacere, followed by L'Innocente, Il Trionfo delle Morte, Le Virgine delle Rocce, and II Fuoco. His affair with II Duse was the talk of Europe. D'Annunzio's close friend, Count Primoli, also a friend of Bourget's, knew James, and the latter saw him frequently Elfter meeting him in the 1880s in Italy, where the American novelist has been when D'Annunzio started living near II Duse just outside Florence.2 II Piacere (1889), through the French translation, L'Enfant de Volupté, by Hérrelle (1893), had made D'Annunzio popular throughout Europe. The reader must understand that when Maud Blessingbourne reads her French novels, the novels of D'Annunzio would be counted among them, for Hérrelle's translations were famous. (Hérrelle was a friend of Bourget's, and James's friendship with Bourget was very strong until 1907 and the Dreyfus case.) James owned all of D'Annunzio's novels, reading them in the Italian edi tions of the early 1890s,3 and they were "heavily marked."4 James, who spoke fluent Italian,5 was well aware of D'Annunzio's success in France and that he was the extreme exemplar of the French novel of passion. In March 1899 James had visited Mrs. Ward and the Villa Barberini. (He was to deplore D'Annunzio's indiscretion in naming the villa in II Piacere.) In 1899 D'Annunzio made a triumphant trip to France, where women lined up to meet him. His sexual conquests were phenomenal, and everyone was aware of his appearance from news photos. His bald head might appear tightly cropped, and his moustache and small beard gave him an "un-English" look that was part of the physiognomy of Col onel Voyt, the third member of James's romantic triangle in his tale. The fact that Mrs. Dyott had never heard of him shows that her isolation from cosmopolitan centers matches the isolation of D'Annunzio's characters, who live only in their sexual relations. The introduction of that one word, "D'Annunzio," is doubly signifi cant because it relates the story to the essay James was to write shortly after on the Italian novelist. D'Annunzio, therefore, acts as an annun ciatory angel, which his name, Gabriele D'Annunzio, actually means. And not only does it announce to the reader that this is the kind of novel that Maud is reading, but that "The Story In It" is a D'Annunzian story, corrected by James but recognizable through the icons made famous by '"The Story in It," in The Complete Tales of Henry James, ed. Leon Edel (Philadelphia, PA: J. B. Lippincott, 1964), XI, 309.

Beyond that, the word also heralds James's critical tribute to D'An nunzio's great gifts, written a year after the story itself appeared in the Anglo-American Magazine of January 1902. The essay was finally published in the Quarterly Review for April 1904. The forty-eight page piece of criticism devotes three-quarters of its careful analysis to unblemished praise of the author. Attention to the fundamental "flaw" that James finds in the five novels whose English and French translations were the pretext for the review essay takes up only the remaining fourth of the essay. Nor does this flaw, as recent critics of the essay have uniformly misunderstood, rest on moralistic grounds.6 It is not a question at all of morality but of the fact that "the sexual passion from which he [D'Annunzio] extracts such admirable detached pictures insists on remaining for him only the act of a moment, beginning and ending in itself. . . ." James continues: For what it represents, precisely, it is poetically interesting; it finds its extension and con summation only in the rest of life. . . . What the participants do with their agitation, in short, or even what it does with them, that is the stuff of poetry, and it is never really interesting save when something finely contributive in themselves makes it so.7 For James, D'Annunzio represents the "case full-blown" of the writer of the "esthetic consciousness," because he is the "one masterful specimen" who has "assuaged our curiosity" about the "esthetic type" (N, p. 247). In spite of the fundamental flaw of the isolation of the sensibility from any other relation, it is only in D'Annunzio's novels that we find "the 'great' relation" for intimacy, as we shall nowhere else find it presented" (N, p. 292). The defect resides not in any moral predisposition on James's part when confronted with sexual intercourse expressed in a most intense literary fashion, but because he sees undermined "the charm of that achievement" because it is "related, in its own turn, to nothing in heaven above or the earth beneath" (N, p. 292). The closing words of the essay bring us back to James's own tale: Need the esthetic adventure, in a word, organized for real discovery, give us no more comforting news of success? Are there not, so to speak, finer possible combinations? Are there not safeguards against futility that in the example before us were but too presumably absent? (N, p. 293) James answered his own query just after he raised it, for The Golden Bowl, also written during this year, 1903, can be considered a corrected D'Annunzian novel of adultery, with his own "safeguards against futility." 6See, for instance, Giorgio Melchiori, "Cups of Gold for The Sacred Fount: Aspects of James's Symbolism," Critical Quarterly, 7 (Winter 1965), 301-316, and Paul Maixner, "James on D'Annunzio— 'A High Example of Exclusive Estheticism,' " Criticism, 13 (1971), 291-311. 7Henry James, Notes on Novelists (New York: Scribner's, 1914), p. 292. Future references, ab breviated N, will be included parenthetically within the text. JAMES AND D'ANNUNZIO 203</page><page sequence="4">In "The Story In It" James has the same kind of debate with D'An nunzio as he had in his essay. In his New York Edition Preface to the volume in which this story is reprinted, he tells of having heard about a discussion concerning "the honest woman" and the modern French novelists' inability to put her into a story of modern romance. It had been reported to him "by a distinguished friend, a novelist not to our manner born or bred," presumably Bourget, who had answered a ques tion put to him about why "the adventures imputed to his heroines were . . . impossible to ladies respecting themselves."8 The French writer had replied that "ladies who respected themselves took particular care never to have adventures." James comments that "a personal 'adventure' is . . . no positive and absolute and inelastic thing, but just a matter of relation and appreciation . . ." (P, p. 286). Colonel Voyt is not Bourget because we know that James would never have violated his friendship with the French novelist in this fashion, although at one point in Voyt's debate with Maud he acts as if he were indeed a novelist. He has a military past and a present seat in the House of Commons. His "fighting Liberalism in the House of Commons" ("SI," p. 310) suggests D'Annunzio's political stance. II "The Story In It" is perhaps the most sophisticated teile Henry James ever wrote, which he was proud enough to include in The New York Edition. In his Preface of 1909, he called it "one of my briefest composi tions," a tightly compressed six thousand words. In it he refuses to define what a "personal adventure" is, for it can be judged only "as a matter of relation and appreciation, a name we give to any situation that has added the sharp taste of uncertainty to a quickened sense of life" (P, p. 286). It remains a "matter of interpretation of the particular condi tions; without a view of which latter some of the most prodigious adven tures . . . may vulgarly show for nothing" (P, pp. 285-286). These words echo those he wrote about five years before in his review of the novels of D'Annunzio: "we have a right in such matters to our preference, a right to choose the kind of adventure of the imagination we like best. No obligation whatever rests on us in respect to a given kind" (N, pp. 265-266). In "The Story In It" the adventures are those of three people—Mrs. Dyott; Colonel Voyt, whose mistress she is; and Maud Blessingbourne, who is in love with the Colonel but who has no intention of ever telling 8Henry James, The Art of Fiction (New York: Scribner's, 1934), p. 285. Future references, ab breviated P, will be included parenthetically within the text. 204 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="5">him, or anyone, and who considers it an adventure to love him without his knowledge. James is telling us that even Maud Blessingbourne can have an adventure, but what she is not having is what he defines quite carefully in his D'Annunzio essay as the " 'great' relation," the relation between a man and a woman. Of the three kinds of relations—one between Mrs. Dyott and the Col onel, the second between the Colonel and Mrs. Dyott, and the third be tween Maud and Voyt—the last one is only a partial relation. The adven ture Maud is having is her own personell consciousness of her love, but the 'great relation' she does not even want to have, showing great wisdom in this instance because Mrs. Dyott is clearly shown as suffering in her affair. The story is divided into three parts, each functioning as a short act in which dialogue mimics the play form. The first opens in Mrs. Dyott's country house while a fierce storm rages outside. Mrs. Dyott and Maud Blessingbourne, her house guest, are in the esthetically arranged living room; while Mrs. Dyott writes letters, Maud reads a French novel. The latter tells her hostess that she is disappointed both in French novels and in the novels of D'Annunzio because there are no good women in them. She shows that she is anxiously awaiting the Colonel, who arrives in spite of the storm. The second act is a matter chiefly between Maud and the Colonel, the two engaging in a discussion of why French novelists never show a respectable woman in their fiction, concluding that the reason is that a respectable woman does not get involved in sexual adventures. During this discussion the Colonel flirts with Maud, although he knows he will never get her to bed. The third act shows us that Maud is in love with the Colonel but wishes it to remain simply an affair of her own consciousness. At the end of the week, Mrs. Dyott and the Colonel meet again when she reveals Maud's feelings for him. They both come to the conclusion that her so called love affair with him, "small, scared and starved," could not possibly compare to a "romance like their own, a thing to make the fortune of any author up to the mark," and that only "a duffer . . . would see the shadow of a 'story' in it" ("SI," p. 326). James wrote in his Preface in 1908 that the discussion with Bourget had given him the idea for the story, but he adds that at the time he heard it it was "just a subject, clearly, although I couldn't immediately tell which or what. To find out I had to get a little closer to it, and 'The Story In It' precisely represents that undertaking" (P, p. 286). It is the getting closer to it that concerns us because James's final version differs considerably from the outline of the story in his Notebooks (15 February 1899). There he has a man of letters and his mistress criticize her friend's one-sided romance. She declares "a romance is a relation. . . . There is none" in her friend's, to which the man answers, "But mayn't JAMES AND D'ANNUNZIO 205</page><page sequence="6">it after all be also a (sort of) consciousness? //«just says he has one too."9 But the "lost" woman thinks that a relation has to begin with the sexual relation that exists between her and the man. In this version the man, too, has the consciousness of a relation with Maud. Beyond that skeletal outline, the relation of the adulterous couple in James's story is shown as hardly a bed of roses. Mrs. Dyott is clearly suffering, the Colonel is a flirt, and this is neither the first nor the last of his affairs. Within the story are sheltered many D'Annunzian icons which reveal themselves in the great similarity between the material in this tale and the material in the essay James wrote the next year on the Italian novelist. The relation of "The Story In It" to James's reading of the Italian's novels is first announced to us by "D'Annunzio," the only named author in a story which discusses the French novel of love. But, one may ask, why is D'Annunzio, an Italian, named and not a French author? One reason is that he was translated almost immediately into French, thus becoming available to educated English-speaking readers and so classifiable as the most "French" novelist of them all, one that went the furthest in the direction of complete eroticism. The second reason is that James's story, related in the most revealing sense to his appreciative essay on D'An nunzio, embodies James's great interest in his recent reading of the Italian's novels. The story and the essay seem to have been intertwined, perhaps un consciously, in James's mind. This is apparent in the peculiar mistakes as to the dates of each piece of writing. In his New York Edition Preface James claims that the tale, "The Story In It," was published in 1903 after it had "haunted, a graceless beggar, for a couple of years, the cold avenues of publicity; till finally an old acquaintance . . . published it (1903)" (P, p. 285). This is incorrect, because the story was actually published in 1902 in the Anglo-American Magazine. The essay "D'Annun zio" was published, on the other hand, in The Quarterly Review of April 1904, yet in the collection of reprinted essays that James gathered for his Notes on Novelists of 1914, the D'Annunzio essay is dated in the table of contents and in the text as 1902, which is also incorrect. Because so far there is no other explanation for the faulty datings, we can conclude that they were somehow bound together in James's mind. To understand the form of "The Story In It," one must not only read it at least twice, as James always advised his readers, but one must read it in connection with the essay. In addition, the reader should be familiar with the five great novels by D'Annunzio, or at least should recognize those idiosyncratic icons which always appear in the Italian 9The Notebooks of Henry James, ed. F. O. Matthiessen (New York: Oxford Unversity Press, 1947), p. 276. 206 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="7">novelist's dramas of intolerable and all-consuming erotic passion. They are drenched at once in nature and in the most sophisticated Italian culture; they have been subjected to a total aesthetic immersion. Ill It is to this aesthetic element that James calls attention when he calls D'Annunzio the "case" of the novelist who has most completely applied the "conception of the 'esthetic' law of life" to the novel. Because of our "timidities and penuries," James wrote, the English have failed in this direction. For D'Annunzio, "beauty at any price is an old story to him; art and form and style as the aim of the superior life are a matter of course," and "the play of the esthetic instinct in him takes on, for positive extravagance and as a last refinement of freedom, the crown of solicitude and anxiety" (N, p. 248). His talent has "concentrated almost wholly on the life of the senses," and "the only ideas he urges upon us are the erotic and the plastic," for he "makes them interchangeable faces of the same figure" (jV, p. 249). The bulk of the essay is praise for the consummate way in which D'Annunzio reports the "unbridled surrender to the life of the senses" of Count Andrea Sperelli, "L'Enfant de Volupté," or, as in his native title (translated in English as The Child of Pleasure) II Piacere, and of the other heroes and heroines of the five novels. D'Annunzio's "faculty" is "admirable" because it makes us feel . . . the whole category of the phenomena of 'passion,' as passion prevails between his men and women—and scarcely anything else prevails; the states of feeling, of ecstasy and suffering engendered, the play of sensibility from end to end of the scale. (N, p. 256) James's concluding criticism is "[t]hat sexual passion from which he ex tracts such admirable, detached pictures insists on remaining for him only the act of a moment. . . . From the moment it depends on itself alone for its beauty it endangers extremely its distinction, so precarious at the best" (N, p. 292). It is interesting that in the essay the most recurrent word is relation, appearing fifteen times. The next is sense, which occurs fourteen times. They are followed in frequency by romance, eleven times, and passion, ten. One could almost create a Jamesian axiom out of these ingredients that would make a shorthand criticism of the novels of D'Annunzio, so ad mirable in what they take on to do but so basically flawed because of what they leave out. The sentence would be: the romance inherent in a passion involving the senses must have relations with other parts of life to become really a full-blown romance. It is also interesting to see that in the short story the words mentioned above occur almost as fre quently as in the long piece. The word sense and romance occur twelve JAMES AND D'ANNUNZIO 207</page><page sequence="8">times each. The word relation comes next, occurring ten times. One of the outstanding characteristics of D'Annunzio's novels is their anthropomorphic attitude toward nature. The wetness of the weather in the famous auction scene in II Piacere and the storm in II Trionfo della Morte (which James thought one of D'Annunzio's greatest works) are ex amples. Weather in its extreme forms combines always with the rich, hothouse interior of a palace like the Barberini, the home of Eleanor Muti, the enchantress of Sperelli in II Piacere, the cultivated interior with its precious objects acting as a kind of art-soaked medium for the sensual passions of the suffering lovers. In L'Innocente, the growth of tree and the sickness of Juliana (the heroine) and her doomed infant pervade the atmosphere and give her—a wife who has had her own reproachable mo ment of adultery blighted by the arrival of the unwanted child—her pitiful morbidity. This pathetic fallacy James has wittily and succinctly imitated in the opening lines of his tale. "The weather had turned so much worse that the rest of the day was certainly lost. The wind had risen and the storm gathered force" ("SI," p. 307). A "cliff" is mentioned at the beginning of the story, which may remind the reader on his second reading of the cliff from which Georgio Aurispa in II Trionfo della Morte throws himself and his mistress to end the torment of their love affair, a torment (at least for the woman in the relationship) that James's story, for all its civil ized tone, conceals and reveals at the same time. James has in addition introduced into his annunciatory paragraph the importance that the senses will play. The sense of sound is given in the "thump" of the wind; "the noise of the wind" is repeated in "the sharp scratch of Mrs. Dyott's pen at the table where she was busy with letters." The sense of sight is included, as "the great wet brush of the sky" adds a touch of a painter's metaphor to the "vicious splotches of rain" and "the troubled light." The second paragraph, as if in a play, encapsulates in a few words "the finer aesthetic evolutions" that made up "the special tone of the room" in which the two women are seated, a room which includes "a small sofa ... a palm-tree, a screen, a stool, a stand, a bowl of flowers and three photographs in silver frames" which had been "arranged ... as a choice 'corner.' " The number "three" of the elegantly framed photographs seems to be symbolic of the three persons in this little condensed D'Annunzian play. The "ancient French furniture" of the hostess, Mrs. Dyott, is counterbalanced by the "modern French authors" of her guest, Maud Blessingbourne. The particular trait of D'Annunzio's novels, esthetic eroticism, has been economically sug gested by the "consistent air of selection and suppression" of this setting ("SI," pp. 307-308). "D'Annunzio" is the annunciatory signal not only for the type of "romance" which is about to be launched but also for alerting the reader 208 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="9">to the presence of a character who is described very much like the Italian novelist himself. First, the scene has been ushered in with "a sense of the weather" in its most violent form as well as with "a sense" of the "nature" of "the silence" with which the two women await the man's arrival. The French novel Maud is reading is surcharged with the same adjectives that apply to the weather—"mild" or "wild." "It never rains but it pours" is how Maud puns on her great number of French romances ("SI," p. 309). The "tension" and "intensity" of the two women underline the "elements" as Colonel Voyt, who is a double for D'Annunzio himself, enters: "he looked, as was usually said, un-English." His hair is "cropped close" and his "dense glossy grey" èyes were "tinted with blue," as were D'Annunzio's. As soon as he enters and after the servant has gone, he embraces Mrs. Dyott to show he is having a typically D'Annunzian pas sionate relation with her. Like his model he is vain, for he "wiped, before the glass, his wet moustache" not only once but twice. He is chided by his mistress for having incautiously sent her a letter, an act of impulse which might, she thought, be one of a series of "calculations." He answers, "because when small children are too awfully good they die? Well, I am a small child compared to you—but I'm not dead yet. I cling to life" ("SI," pp. 310-312). The last two sentences are opaque unless we keep in mind the title, II Piacere. That novel has a hero, Count Andrea Sperelli, who seems to be the model for Colonel Voyt, a man also with a title of sorts. Andrea has childlike impulses that become indeed calculations. He, too, is caught in a relation with two women, one who wishes, at the start, to conceal her passion from her lover. Maria Ferrés, then, would correspond to Maud Blessingbourne whose name, with its symbolic overtones, reminds one of another mistress of Sperelli's, Bianca Dolcebuono: "Her name [Bianca] suited her admirably."10 Maud's love for Colonel Voyt seems to have begun just as Sperelli's temporary passion for Bianca had. "Who can say by what mysterious process some contact . . . between a man and a woman may generate ... a sentiment which, latent and unsuspected for long, may suddenly wake to life through unforeseen circumstances?" (C, p. 68). The excessive elegance of interior furnishings has been encapsulated in the introductory page of II Piacere. Certain specifics, like the dressing table of Sperelli, have been used by James as a model for the tiny microcosmic clues to the aesthetic life of his heroine. The end of the auc tion room scene that begins with the rain storm ends with a description 10Gabriele D'Annunzio, The Child of Pleasure, trans. Georgina Harding, with an Introduction by Arthur Symons (Boston, MA: The Page Company, 1898), p. 69. Future references, abbreviated C, will be included parenthetically within the text. JAMES AND D'ANNUNZIO 209</page><page sequence="10">of Andrea's dressing room table in II Piacere: On a great Roman sarcophagus, transformed with much taste into a toilet table, were ranged a selection of cambric handkerchiefs, evening gloves, card and cigarette cases, bottles of scent, and five or six fresh gardenias in separate little pale blue china vases—all these frivolous and fragile things on this mass of stone, on which a funeral cortège was sculptured by a masterly hand! (C, p. 37) James's version of this, also coming directly after the description of the storm and appearing in the second paragraph of the tale, is as follows: "Her visitor, settled on a small sofa that, with a palm tree, a screen, a stool, a stand, a bowl of flowers and three photographs in silver frames, had been arranged near the light wood-fire as a choice 'corner' " ("SI," p. 307). Maud Blessingbourne's "book covered in lemon coloured paper" went "happily with the special tone of the room, a consistent air of selection and suppression, one of the finer aesthetic evolutions." And then we are told that the furniture is "ancient French furniture" ("SI," p. 308). The insistence on the appeal to the senses is made to emphasize "the sensibility of . . . nerves" that inhabits James's tale as well as an early scene when Sperelli makes his first visit to the Palazzo Barberini where Elena Muti lives. As he approaches, "the sensibility of his nerves was so acute that the most trivial impression conveyed to them by external means assumed the gravity of a wound" (C, p. 45). And as he leaves her sickroom, his senses are so alert he thinks he hears Elena breathe. As he leaves, the visual presence of the outside world smites him: "the gentle splash of the fountain . . . the whole firmament glittered with stars . . . carriage lamps flitted . . . bells ringing far and near" (C, p. 50). His "nervous exaltation" (C, p. 133) increases after he recovers from the wound inflicted in his duel, and the seaside country prepares him for the love of a "good woman." (It is interesting to note that the Latin phrase turris eburnea, or "ivory tower," occurs in this novel as well as in L'Innocente and describes the more noble of the two women Andrea Sperelli loves: "Maria Ferrés is a turris eburnea"', "And I am now a vas spiritual' (C, p. 112). James had read these novels with care and was soon to write his own turris eburnea, the novel The Ivory Tower, the title of which may have been suggested by D'Annunzio's repeated references.) The nervous sensibility with its accompanying tension affects "The Story In It." Mrs. Dyott creates a "snap" of Maud's and her "tension" as the curtain opens ("SI," p. 308). The "agitation" that besets D'Annun zian men and women is reflected in the description of Maud as "a pea on a pan" ("SI," p. 312) as she awaits Voyt's arrival. Maud calls their discussion "intense" ("SI," p. 322), and intensity is a commodity freely existing in the D'Annunzian fantasy world. However, the story's most striking relation is not so much with the novels of D'Annunzio themselves as with the essay that James wrote on 210 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="11">the Italian novelist.11 The signifying words in the essay correspond to the signifying words in the story. The main themes reside in the often repeated words: "sense," "relation," "romantic passion," and "state." The last word, "state," had been used by Arthur Symons in his In troduction to the 1898 English translation of II Piacere. He epitomized its thrust as "the mere progression of states of mind" (C, p. xii). That word is used by James in his story at its close when Mrs. Dyott gives Maud's "state" as evidence to the Colonel of Maud's passion for him. She had observed her "state before you come in. . . . And her state after it. . . . And her state . . . while you were here." He answers, "But her state while I was here was charming" ("SI," p. 326). James uses the word again in his essay on D'Annunzio when he discusses the particular "case" of the novelist. He recognizes as well "how the state of being full-blown comes above all from the achievement of consistency" (N, p. 246) and uses it six more times. James mentions the first of "the author's three sharpest signs" as "his rare notations of states of excited sensibility" (N, p. 254), which are evidenced in Maud's "infatuation" with the Colonel as observed by Mrs. Dyott, and in her keeping of her friend "in the dark about the real one" whom she loves (like Maria in II Piacere). The three "states" that Mrs. Dyott observed in her friend all point to "a kind of shy romance" ("SI," p. 326). The word "case" itself is used six times in the essay, for James finds D'Annunzio to be that "case" of the esthetic writer par excellence. The word is used by James in his story just once, when it refers to "the case" Voyt makes for his analysis of his mistress's description of Maud's passion for him ("SI," p. 325). But there is more evidence that James in his essay on D'Annunzio remembered that the tale he had written had dealt with D'Annunzian material. When in the story the "French" novel Maud has left on the table is judged "awful," Voyt implies it is by a specific author and is "like his other" ("SI," p. 313). However, although it is "awful," Maud is reported as having spoken of it as "terribly tame." He then says to Maud, "You don't feel the extraordinary force of the fellow?" ("SI," p. 314). Apparently, she did feel the force of the fellow, but she had her reserves and reactions, which interest Voyt ("SI," p. 314), just as James, too, had felt "the special force" of II Fuoco (N, p. 275), which came out in 1900, the year he wrote his own tale. He also specifies in his essay that the Italian novelist's characters are "embarrassed not so much by "Although the list of books to be reviewed in James's article was not kept in his 1914 Notes on Novelists, it was prefaced in its periodical form as follows: "Art.

JAMES AND D'ANNUNZIO 211</page><page sequence="12">any force they possess as by a force—a force of temperament—that they lack" (N, p. 283). The word "force" leaps to his mind when thinking about D'Annunzio. So although pronouncing the Italian's books "awful," probably because D'Annunzio's characters regret leading the kind of life that James's character seems to be cheerfully leading, Voyt in the story still has to admit "the force of the fellow." James also implies that the Italian's novels that Voyt refers to were part of the French novelistic scene, because at that time they were more widely read in French than in Italian. D'Annunzio himself preferred II Piacere in French and told Arthur Symons that he wished he had read it in that language rather than in the original. The fact that Maud reads D'Annunzio as a French novel seems to be supported by the word of Symons who, on the first page of his Introduction to the English transla tion of II Piacere, tells us that he had suggested to Georgina Harding that "she should run the risk of being told that she has translated an Italian novel from the French, by using both the French title and the French sequence of chapters" (C, p. v). James observed in his critical piece that in addition to D'Annunzio's "rare notation of states of excited sensibility," there is his "splendid visual sense, ... his response to the message ... of aspects and appearances, to the beauty of places and things," helped by "his ample and exquisite style," his always "active employment of language as a means of com munication and representation" (N, p. 254). Within those three categories, James's analysis places itself and itemizes the crucial words that deter mine the process by which the characters become embroiled in their erotic and plastic submissions to states of feeling. The novels are the novels of the senses that produce "romances," but they are criticized by James for being remote and divorced from life, having, in other words, no "relation" with it. This word is mentioned in his essay more than any other, for it is the critical lack of extended relations that James finds flawing D'Annunzio's work, which is "Shut out from the rest of life" (N, p. 292). We should expect to and do find these crucial words in the tale that is devoted to a D'Annunzian type of Romance. In fact, the word "relation" occurs less often in the story than it does in the critical essay because the tale is not a piece of criticism but a representation. The " 'great' relation" itself, however, the relation between a man and a woman, is presented in D'Annunzio's novels, as James admits, "for intimacy as we shall nowhere else find it represented; but, he demurs, "to see it related, in its own turn, to nothing in the heaven above or the earth beneath, this undermines, we definitely learn, the charm of that achievement" (N, p. 293). James, however, is in a sense optimistic about a possible resolution of D'Annunzio's aesthetic form because he wonders whether D'Annunzio's presentation of the "esthetic case" is 212 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="13">. . . the only case of the kind conceivable. . . . Are there not, so to speak, finer possible combinations. ... To which the sole answer probably is that no man can say. It is Signor D'Annunzio alone who has really sailed the sea and brought back the booty. The actual case is so good that all the potential fade beside it. It has for it that it exists, and that, whether for the strength of the original outfit or for the weight of the final testimony, it could scarce thinkably be bettered. (N, p. 293) Other telltale verbal carry-overs from the earlier James story into the critical essay can be found in the reoccurrence of the word "flounder." Colonel Voyt argues that "If a relation stops, where's the story? If it doesn't stop, where's the innocence? It seems to me you must choose. It would be very pretty if it were otherwise, but that's how we flounder. Art is our flounderings shown" ("SI," p. 320). In his essay, we find that James repeats the same figure. When describing how the couples in D'Annunzio's world live in "a cage of golden wire, the nature and the art of Italy," he comments on how "the great shining element in which the characters flounder and suffer becomes rich and beautiful for them ... by the action of the writer's mind" (N, p. 262). Because James wrote that II Piacere "has ... the merit of giving us strongly ... the author's scale and range of view. ... so constituting a sort of prophetic summary of his elements" (N, p. 253), it is not sur prising that the miniature "correction" of D'Annunzio that "The Story In It" really is, seems to point to 11 Piacere as the tale to be corrected. We know from the few but clear hints James throws to us that Colonel Voyt is "a child" of pleasure ("SI," p. 311), that he is having his fun at the expense of Mrs. Dyott, that he is clearly flirting with Maud Bless ingbourne, and that he is caught between two women but is stopped short by virtuous Maud's theory that a love affair for her is solely a matter of her own consciousness and no one else's. James prevents the embroil ment between Maud and Voyt because Jamesian people do not live only in their erotic and plastic senses. The ending of the story shows clearly that the D'Annunzian couple pity the Jamesian heroine for her "small, scared, starved subjective satisfac tion" ("SI," p. 326). We know, too, from Colonel Voyt's remark that he would expect Maud to "flounder out" and from Mrs. Dyott's com ment, "He has . . . seen it come so often; and he has always waited for it and met it" ("SI," p. 320), that the Colonel is a man of many love affairs, just as Andrea Sperelli was. From Voyt's impulsive note and his clandestine caress of the hostess, we also know he is as passionate as was his D'Annunzian model. However, this characterization must be seen as a correction by James of the D'Annunzian self-destructive hero. Voyt is not going to involve Maud the way Sperelli did Maria Ferrés, nor is he going to lose control of the distinct identities of each of his two women as Sperelli did at the end of II Piacere. The reader knows at the end of the James tale where JAMES AND D'ANNUNZIO 213</page><page sequence="14">his and the writer's sympathies lie, just the way the reader of D'Annun zio's novel also knows that total submergence in the erotic life will end in the dissolution of a man's character. The sympathies of writer and reader in "The Story In It" are unmistakably with the secret, one-sided passion of Maud. A few months after James wrote "The Story In It" he contributed to a book written in aid of the Charing Cross Hospital an essay called "The Saint's Afternoon" (May 1901), in which his visit to Anacapri during the feast day of St. Anthony is recorded. The striking effect of the coast line of Capri induced in James the tourist the following observations: "For a certain art of asking Italy till she can give, you must doubtless be a rare raffiné or a rare genius, a sophisticated Norseman or just a Gabriele D'Annunzio."12 That he was invoking the northern Ibsen to join hands with the southern D'Annunzio seems the probable meaning of his lines. It is doubly interesting that these words of praise for the Italian novelist were written some time between "The Story In It" and the critical essay devoted to him. This allusion seems to justify the point made here that James ad mired the genius of D'Annunzio to the extent that his name, iconography, vocabulary, and attitude toward love and beauty inform one of his most ingenious short stories. Tiny as it is, it packs into its hold a cargo filled with suggestions calculated to turn the reader's attention to the idiosyn cratic talents of an imagination more congenial to James than one would expect D'Annunzio's purely sensual approach to experience to be. Through mimickry and argument James attempted to harness and to control this prime example of an esthetic "case." A microcosmic rendering of a typi cally D'Annunzian situation in his own very different tale is the happy result. 12Henry James, Italian Hours (Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin, 1909), p. 486.
