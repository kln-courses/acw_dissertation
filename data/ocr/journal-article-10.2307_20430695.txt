Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2007. Pp. 750. ISBN 978-90-04-I5258-8. ?I45.oo/US$I95.oo. In this ambitious work, Cadotte investigates the continuity of pre-Roman cults in Roman North Africa. Through the process of interpretatio romana, a Punic or native African deity received a Roman name and veneer (such as iconography or formulaic invocations), yet the underlying nature of the deity remained essentially unchanged. To explore this process, C. scrutinizes the pre-Roman and Roman expressions of eleven cults individually (chs i-II): Baal Hammon/Saturn, Tanit/Caelestis, Baal Addir/Mercury Silvanus, Eshmoun/Aesculapius and Apollo, Astarte/Venus, Shadrapha/Liber, Melqart/Hercules, the African forms of Pluto and Neptune, the Cereres (a Punicized version of the Greek cult), and astral cults. Although the basis for this study is primarily epigraphic, C. is to be commended for undertaking a holistic study of the written, archaeological, and iconographic evidence for each cult. C.'s particular skill lies in dissecting the abundant epigraphic evidence on several levels. The catalogue of Latin votive inscriptions (4z6-667) will be useful to researchers; it is arranged geographically and for each entry includes a description of the stone, the expanded Latin inscription, date, brief commentary, and publication references. The individual chapters each contain a table listing the epigraphic attestations of the relevant deity, organized by findspot and dated by either internal information or style. A topographic distribution map emphasizes the intensive zones of worship for each cult (though the odd numbering system is not explained). C. also uses additional tables and maps to demonstrate that a parallel process of interpretatio africana was occurring; that is, the worship of imported Roman gods, such as Magna Mater (Cybele) and Minerva, was being adapted to suit African proclivities for the siting of a sanctuary, the local pantheon, and so on. This breakdown continues in the thematic bibliography, with the addition of certain related headings such as African syncretism, literary sources, and African coinage. Since the bibliography is in chronological rather than alphabetical order, the reader gains a quick snapshot of the history of scholarship on each subject. Each inscription offers a wealth of evidence. The Roman names, epithets, and characteristics of a given Libyco-Punic deity could vary by both location and date, often explicable by ancient Phoenician and/or local African usage with occasional Hellenic intrusions. Broad trends are nevertheless detectable (ch. iz). For instance, the earliest gods to appear in Latin inscriptions (in the first century A.D.) are generally the key Carthaginian divinities, given Roman names: Saturn, Caelestis, Aesculapius, and the Cereres. At the beginning of the second century, Latin inscriptions naming local gods or genii become common, followed by pairings of gods who had been twinned in pre-Roman times. Dedications to groupings of gods increase over the second century and peak in the Severan period, marking a renaissance of Libyco-Punic cults (4zz). Finally, after the Severan period, foreign influences give rise to unprecedented pantheons of deities as well as new epithets such as invictus and aeternus. Upon observing that Latin inscriptions were relatively uncommon before the second century, C. suggests that Romanization and interpretatio romana were at an incipient stage until then, while the inhabitants had not yet become habituated to the Roman usage of ex-votos (414, 417). Here one might have expected a nod to studies of the Latin 'epigraphic habit/culture' (cf. Greg Woolf, 'Monumental writing and the expansion of Roman society in the early Empire', JRS 86 (I996), 2z-39, especially zz n. I), as well as greater recognition of the parallel Punic and 'Libyco-Berber' epigraphic traditions, with their own forms of interpretatio africana. Although the author frequently uses sculptural iconography to elucidate the nature of the deities, there are no illustrations apart from a plan of the sanctuary at Thinissut (68). This</page><page sequence="2">214 REVIEWS omission may have been a factor of expense, since this book is already costly without them. If so, the author had an obligation to ensure that he described the images clearly and prudently. Three examples will suffice. First, readers who are unfamiliar with characteristic symbols such as the so called 'sign of Tanit' will be frustrated that they are neither illustrated nor explained, though they form the basis for some arguments and indeed are not well understood even by specialists. Second, on p. 486, the assertion that Mercury was depicted on 'certaines des steles dites de la Ghorfa' not only propagates but compounds an error made by C. Gilbert Picard about one stele from that series (Catalogue du Musee Alaoui (c. 1954-I955), I, 270 Cb-970). The figure in question is an anthropomorphic 'sign of Tanit' wearing a wreath and ankle bracelets, not Hermes with a petasus and winged ankles. Third, the frequent appearance of Sol and Luna in sculptural reliefs is significant enough to warrant a table 5.5 pages long (375-80), but no illustrations. Accordingly, when on p. 71 C. uses images of Tanit with a crescent 'moon' to equate her lunar nature with that of Diana/Artemis, one might well question the basic assumption that the female on those stelae is Tanit. Despite such criticisms, the presentation of the iconography is broadly correct and well-integrated. Overall, C.'s effort highlights the inadequacies of Romanization studies that have tried to impose generalizing and monolithic forms of religious syncretism. At the same time, this book bridges the divide between previous studies of specific deities and general surveys of the Romanization of ancient North Africa. Doubtless this work will become a standard reference for those who study pre-Roman and Roman Africa, while scholars of Romanization, epigraphy, and ancient religion will be interested in incorporating the author's findings into broader studies of their field.
