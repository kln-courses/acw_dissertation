<plain_text><page sequence="1">A CONUNDRUM IN THE MS. READINGS TO MOSES KIMHI'S JOB COMMENTARY HERBERTW. BASSER The common function of the Jewish exegesis of sacred texts is to limit the possibility of extending the import of texts beyond the contours of the sanctioned beliefs of the community. Interestingly, this feature characterizes the grammatical commentaries to Scripture of the medieval exegetes. However, even in these works it is possible to find esoteric meanings buried beneath the seemingly mundane and it is to this possibility that we wish to turn our attention in examining the approach of the much neglected 12th c. exegete, Moses Kimhi. Moses Kimhi is best known as the conduit of instruction from his father Joseph to his younger brother,. David. When we begin to look at Moses' work in its own light we find that he was a very powerful exegete and original thinker in his own right. Some of his commentaries are now beginning to appear in critical editions. His mastery of Hebrew and his terse style mark him as one who is worthy to enter the pages next to Rashi and Nachmanides as is the case in the Angelica manuscript of miqra'ot gedolot . His commentary to Job is more extensive than his father's and is rather independent of his father's ideas although the method of commentary is closely related. It was not in vain that his brother David referred to him as "my brother, my teacher." However, we will soon see that the difficulties encountered in studying the commentary are so acute and suggest extensive previous interpolation and emendation. We know then that his commentary was seriously studied but, in places, lacked sufficient exposition so that clarifications fell into the work, perhaps some by his own hand. We shall demonstrate here the many blind alleys one encounters in trying to unravel the knots in the current witnesses. His commentary to Job is witnessed in three versions. The Oxford (0) manuscript has never been published. It is characterized by scribal glosses citing other Kimhis and by unique comments to short passages, comments which may be original. The almost illegible Rome 183</page><page sequence="2">HERBERTW. BASSER (R) manuscript is of a different orthographic type than the Oxford in that its spelling is plene. It also represents a somewhat longer version in that it contains unique elucidations of biblical metaphorsl which appear to have philosophic or mystical allusions. These elucidations are absent in the other versions and some of them appear to be interpolations. One such comment will be the focus of the present discussion. Finally the version printed by Schwarz (S) in Tikvat Enosh, 1858, is reported to be based on a Rome ms of 1410, no longer extant. At places it is marred by faulty copying and printing so that it is of little critical use. In general, Moses' Job commentary reflects the style of medieval grammarians who wrote their works in two sections. The first section taught biblical grammar while the second explained the meaning and usage of biblical vocabulary. Rabbi Moses Kimhi first teaches the grammatical forms, verse by verse of one chapter in a grammatical commentary, and then proceeds to analyze and paraphrase the essential content of that chapter in an expository commentary. To appreciate the problems involved in reading the Job commentary we note that the manuscripts of the commentary vary so widely that critical editions are necessary. In the Job commentary, R and 0 vary so often that where they do agree, it is almost certain that these preserve original readings. To some lesser degree, there is reason to accept agreements between R and S as original also. Where 0 and S agree against R we may have some grounds for consideration of orginality but not without careful analysis of all the readings. According to F. Talmage, Moses wrote grammars and marked his commentaries with his interests in philology and grammar rather than philosophic or historical inquiry. Nevertheless, Talmage points out, it is to be assumed that Moses shared his father's notion of the relationship between philology and philosophy2. In line with this assumption we note in our commentary that Moses is concerned with anthropomorphism, God's eyes are his knowledge, his hand is his power, his place is his spiritual level. We also note his comment in 3:20 concerning the soul which emanates from the supernal light: והקרוב אלי להיות אוד רמז לנפש הנאצלת מאוד העליון וכמוהו ♦אור צדיקים ישמח. We are also intrigued by other passages found in the commentary such as the following. We read Job 4: 7-11: 7 זכר-נא מי הוא נקי אבד ואיפה ישרים נכחדו 8 כאשד ראיתי חדשי און וזרעי עמל יקצרהו 9 מנשמת אלוה יאבדו ומרוח אפו יכלו 10 שאגת אדיה וקול שחל ושני כפירים נתעו 11 ליש אבד מבלי-מרף ובני לביא יתפרדו 184</page><page sequence="3">A CONUNDRUM IN THE MS. READINGS TO MOSES KIMHI'S JOB COMMENTARY I suggest that Moses Kimhi would render this as: Consider now: does a saint perish, are innocents destroyed! But I see plowers of sin, sowers of evil do reap this; namely, From the divine anima are abandoned— from his angry spirit wither— they, who have The lion-pant,the lion-roar, the cub-teeth; they are at a loss. The lion perishes without any prey; the young are separated. Rabbi Moses Kimhi comments: [פרק די] 71) זכור גא: כי אני לא אדע נקי אובד. 8) חודשי: דומה המעשה הרע לחרישה שהיא עסק האדם. יקצרוהו : יקבלו ®כדם וזהו מנשמת אלוה יאבדו— וטעם הנשמה גבורתו הפועלת ועושה רצונו בעולמו כנשמה הפועלת בגוף. 8/9/10/11) (ו)חודשי 5און שהיה להם קול כשאגת אריה ושניהם, שני כפירים, [נתעו: 0] הם יתעו לבלי אוכל— (0, S) ( « גלתעו: פי 1 עקירת המלתעות ונפילתן כמו ישרש עקירת השורש » וזכר גבורת הכפיר שהוא גור עדיין ושיניו עשו שורש. והם חזקים ולא תועיל גבורתם אלא מנשמת אלוהי יאבדו-- [ליש אובד:] הלא ליש 0!גבוד בבהמה «®ר לא יזדמן לו טורפו מן השמים לא תועיל לו גבורתו- ובני לביא יתפרדו— לבקש טורפם-- R ) {ו)ליש [אובד]/ ובגי לביא: טעם התקיפים החומסים הנמשלים לליש ולביא מנשמת, היא הנשמה הפועלת הוא המלאך עושה רצונו כי המלאכים נפשות קיימות וכן נשמת ה' כנחל גפרית, יאבדו 5!ויתפרדו במותם. ויש אומי יכלו בשאגת אריה שיביאם השם לטרפה ויש אומדים אף השם כשאגת אריה והפירוש הדזמטון נכון מאד. חילופי נוסח 2 י קבל ו] ל י קבל ד 0— 3 לטעם/ —S חל דשי/ חל דשי אלן | S 'n [1 אני בגל ף/ בגל ף לאללי | s R הנשמה] נשמת 0— 4 כנשמה] בנשמה | S לחטעם 5 קול] ח' —MT זה רמו למלאך בטעם שלחני ורוחו 0 \ והורש'] הורשי 6 ד.פ יתעו לבלי אוכל] נלתננו פי י —S R 'נתעו] ח S 5| כשאגת/ שאגת —R עקירת המלתעות ונפילתן במו ישרש עקירת השורש... לבקש טזדפם 14 —R ן היא] ח' S 13 מנשמת.. .כנחל נכרית] ח' —S 012 טעם/ ה |s 16 ויש אומי יכלו בשאגת אריה] ח'--S '15 במותם] ח --R יאבדו] ח' 17 --0 1 יש אומרים אף השם כשאגת אריה] ח'|s 0 'שיביאם השם לטרפד./ ח —s מאד] ח' We analyze the first unit of these comments as follows: 7) Consider that I do not know of an abandoned saint. 8/9/10/11) The plowers of sin: the evil deed is like an act of plowing in that it is human labor for gain. Do reap this: They get their just deserts; namely, "fro■ the anima of the 185</page><page sequence="4">HERBERTW. BASSER Lord they are abandoned."— This anima is his active dynaais and performs His will in His world like the active soul in the body3. And it is the plowers of sin who have the voice of a panting lion and whose teeth are teeth of kefiri■,(Are at a loss:) it is they who wander without food (0,S). | «Are fanged: The sense is that of the fangs loosing and falling out in the way " root out" refers to "uprooting" (!).* Scripture mentions the power of a kefir, still a young whelp, whose teeth have just taken root. Although these people are strong, their power is of no use to them— for "fro■ the anima of the Lord they are abandoned." Behold also the layish, the most powerful of all animals. Yet when his prey is not prepared by Providence, his power is useless; and the bnei lavi are separated — to search out their food. (R)| We note that Kimhi calls the instrument of Providence the "neshamah ha-poelet" and identified it with God's "gevurah". An entire monograph on the history of the mystical and philosophic usages of "kavod and gevurah" would be helpful to establish the precise sense of "gevurah" in these comments. Suffice it, at present, to note that the term here does not refer to punitive powers but to some type of active Will Power, perhaps akin to the על ארעא עובד גבורתה in the Targum to Isaiah 6:3 recited daily in the kedushah desidra. It seems to me that one could argue on the basis of this unit that this Active Soul only operates within the confines of the natural world. However, its repetition in the passage below leads me to think otherwise. Both R and 0 refer to Is 30:33, the commentaries there suggesting the tortures of hell. Both R and 0 refer to some kind of separation at death. It is true that S is missing the entire section and does not refer to "separation". This may reflect the tendency in S to be economical by omitting a section which has been treated above and seems awkward. Nevertheless, I would argue that where 0 and R agree the reading is original. 0 and R are the most apt to disagree in readings throughout the commentary. It still remains somewhat unclear whether the references are to early death or to loss of afterlife. We will take up the question again when we discuss the next unit. The bracketed sections are problematic. The note on לתע in E. ben Yehudah's Thesaurus shows us that some medievals took נתעו in Job 4:10 to mean נלתעו and this was given two senses. It could mean "to be strongly toothed (akin to Arabic תעל)"; it could also mean "to be toothless". Saadia Gaon, in his commentary to Job, maintains, in accord with the first possibility, that Scripture portrays fanged (גלתעו), hungry and mobile beasts. These descriptions were stated, he notes, to portray their very 186</page><page sequence="5">A CONUNDRUM IN THE MS. READINGS TO MOSES KIMHI'S JOB COMMENTARY dangerous state as they attack the wicked. Gersonides sees the wicked portrayed as dangerous beasts who will be destroyed. Rashi, attuned to the royal stature of the lion, sees him as symbolic of royalty and nobility. In his Commentary to the Torah (Kafah, 189), Saadia refers to this verse as symbolizing the wicked who are plundered by the more wicked and finally destroyed by God. Abraham ibn Ezra cites a number of comments: Rabbi Moses HaCohen understands that the message is that God will send wild beasts to prey upon the wicked. (The Nachmanides commentary refers to this position approvingly although he prefers to consider the beasts as typical of all sudden calamities.) Ibn Ezra also refers to Rabbi Jonah ibn Janah who sees the animals as "detoothed", a position confirmed in Wilenski's edition of sefer hariqma I ,258. Ibn Ezra dismisses these approaches. He maintains that it is God's anger which is compared to the lion panting for its prey. He refers us to Job 38:41 and understands that the kefir's teeth is a metonym for the roaming kefir, the divine wrath, which seeks its prey. Joseph Kimhi mentions two explanations, the toothless lion (נלתעו) he unenthusiastically ascribes to "some say", the second understanding (יתעו לבלי אכל) , more grammatically sound, he questions on the basis that teeth do not wander like lions4. Radak, Joseph's younger son, wrote in Mikhlol, ed Rittenberg, 76: לתע— הנפעל נוגע, נמעמי וכולי כי מצאנו ושני כפירים נתעו שהוא מן «?לתעות כפירים וכן כתב ר"י ( לפנינו דבי יהודה ואם הכוונה לאבן חיוג לא מצאתי ועיי ההערה בשורשים מהדורת 4.ed. Biesenthal, Lebrecht 414,n שהכוונה לדי יונה) המדקדק ז"ל, ויש אומרים שהוא מן תעה והיה נמפמו נ תעו במשקל נראו רז«!, ההרים, ובא בקמץ התי"ו מפגי ההפסק והדגש לתפארת. ויש אומרים שהוא מורכב מן עבד ועתיד, ואחי רבי משה כתב כי הוא מורכב מן נפעל והתפעל כמו :וגכ#ר להם הדם; ומשפטו נתתעו. Here Rabbi David Kimhi places himself in the camp of ibn Janah by positing the root of גתעו to be לתע. He rejects his brother's comments, which actually occurs in the grammatical section of our commentary to ch. 4 of Job. Since Rabbi Moses accepted the root to be תעה it is unlikely that R preserves the words of Moses. We know that Moses did not change his mind because Radak again cites this passage from the commentary in his Shorashim (ed. Biesenthal and Lebrecht 184) telling us that his deceased brother, ז"ל, took the root to be תעה while he, himself, took it to be לתע. The commentary found in R suspiciously reflects almost word for word the entry of Radak in Shorashim: 187</page><page sequence="6">HERBERTW. BASSER לתע— ... והנפעל מזה ושני כפירים נתצו פשפטו "נלתעו ורצונו לומר עקירת המלתעות ונפילתם כמו ישלש שהוא עקירת השורש". The sectioned marked by quotation marks refelects what we find in R: נלתעו: פי' עקידת המלתעות ונפילתן כמי ישלש עקירת השורש The argument is to be made that at least this section is dependent upon Radak's comments in Shorashim (לתע) . But what of the remainder of R in this section. First we notice that the sense of נלתעו appears to have shifted. Contrary to the previous sentence we learn that the cubs do have firmly rooted teeth. Does this signal a return to Moses1 commentary? Moses did not understand נתעו to be derived from נלתעו. So we might think that we have here another interpolation. On the other hand, perhaps Moses was simply describing שיני כפירים; the wicked are cub-toothed, and still they wander without food (נתעו) until they perish. It is possible that this is part of Moses' original commentary. However, there are reasons to dismiss it as well. In a section, which I will argue below is orginal, we find יתפרדו במותם, "and they are separated" describes what happens to the bnei lavi at the time of their death. On the other hand, the questioned section in R ends with the notation about the bnei lavi ויתפרדו לבקש טורפם, they are separated to search out their food, apparently very much alive. On the basis of apparently irreconcilable statements it could be argued that we dismiss the whole section as a gloss from some other commentary. It is worthwhile noting that we find in Nachmanides commentary a similar passage. The commentary cites this as "and some explain". If it is original, we have to assume that the bnei lavi are sent in hopeless search of their food and soon die. If this is the case, perhaps the food represents long life or eternal blessing of some kind. We now proceed to discuss the next unit. And the layish...and the bnei lavi: The violent and the criminal, likened to the layish and the lavi, "from the anima of the Lord," —[take note:] The active soul refers to the angel who performs His will, for angels are spiritual realities; and likewise Scripture says: And the anima of the Lord is like a stream of brimstone (Is. 30:33). — "they are abandoned" and they are separated in their deaths. Some explain it to mean, "They perish at the hands of a panting lion," that is, God has made them into its prey. Others explain it to mean, "(They perish by) the wrath of God which is like a lion-pant." The first interpretation is superior. We should consider the prooftext, Is. 30:33, which mentions a stream of brimstone. It is likely that Kimhi has a given subtle twist to the passage. It may be that untimely death is signaled by יאבדו. One wonder־', if the separation of the soul from its eternal reward is 188</page><page sequence="7">A CONUNDRUM IN THE MS. READINGS TO MOSES KIMHI'S JOB COMMENTARY noted by ויתפרדו. The lament commemorating the deaths of Saul and Jonathan in 2Sam 1:23, ובמותם לא נפרדו Is cited in the medieval אב הרחמים prayer. The medieval commentaries suggest, that נפרד had a special connotation. This connotation may have been related to some ideas reflecting the loss of providential care and so to ultimate destructions_ ^e should also note that the juxtaposition of יאבדו and יתפרדו here appears to reflect the influence of Psalm 92:10 which speaks of the utter destruction of the wicked. Psalm 92:10 juxtaposes the same terms and it is noteworthy that the Targum tradition to Psalms explains them to mean that the wicked are extirpated from the afterlife, from the company of the righteous. Kimhi tells us in this passage that the "Active Soul" is the rod of punishment. The relatively late Targum to Job calls the "anima" the "memar of the Lord". We also note Kimhi's description of the intellect in his comment to אמדי קדוש - Job 6:10: "These (words) are spoken by the (active- ?) intellect for it is the intercessor (מליץ) between himself and Him; holy in that its words are holy and pure as He is." The description fits Kimhi's angels, the "bnei elohim" of Job 1:6— ובי ותם צורות טהורות וקדושים נקראים בניו. His comment to 10:12 is illuminating: ופקדתך: מצותך שציוית לשמר דוחי והיא הנפש המשכלת. A study of the idea of angel, intellect, providence in Moses Kimhi's works is surely warranted. It does appear possible that he wishes to teach us here not only that the wicked are cut off from their physical sustenance in this world, but also that they are separated from their spiritual life in the next. Now we come to the layish and the lavi, the physical and base symbols of strength. Brute strength is incapable of achieving the goal. The wicked are deprived of providential protection in death. Still it remains unclear whether Moses Kimhi himself considered the abandonment, mentioned in Scripture, to be only in this life, both in this life and the next, or only in the next. He ends by suggesting that others have seen here, in one way or another, the sudden punishment of the wicked in this world. He rejects these approaches in favor of seeing the image as the anguish of the wicked in their quest for fulfillment. Primarily on the evidence of R we may speculate that Kimhi linked this unrealized quest to the futile mechanism of the kefir's teeth. In this view, the lion is not roaring frightfully but sounding his hunt call, for an ill-fated hunt. The natural hunt is for food, not necessarily to wantonly destroy. If we can learn anything from R's addition, which may contain Kimhi's later gloss on his own commentary, it is that the kefir's teeth are the worthy tool which grasps the sought after item. They possibly represent the purified soul or intellect. But the teeth of the wicked are useless. Although the soul or intellect is strong, it is in an immature and undisciplined seating, precisely like the kefir's teeth which are not able to reach their prey. The soul or 189</page><page sequence="8">HERBERT W. BASSER intellect is unrealized. Is it indeed to be thought that Moses Kimhi understood abandonment and separation in this passage of Job in neoplatonic terms? The unresolved questions we have raised are important if we are to understand the method of discourse in Medieval commentaries. The commentaries of Moses Kimhi deserve careful study. The variants in the manuscripts demonstrate that they were copied many times, glossed by (possibly himself as well as) thoughtful and perplexed students who grappled with the complexity of Rabbi Moses' notions beneath the poetic simplicity of his language. NOTES 1 Eg. in the R ms we find his comment to Job 3:18 suggestive of the soul's suffering. קול גובש: דרך העולם לשום האסירים בבור אחד על ידי שומר ובבוקר שוכרי ן אותך ולערב מכריז הנוגש מי ששכר אסיר שישיבהו לבור כי רוצה לסגרו והאסירים כאשד ישמעו מקול נוגש ישבר לבס כי רצונם שיטרחו בחוץ מלהכגם בבור שיגוש אותם ושיענם על פדיון נפשם. 2 Frank Talmage, David Kimhi: The Man and his Commentaries. Harvard University Press, Cambridge 1975, 8. In the Job commentary we find definite allusions to Medieval philosophical concepts; e.g. on Job 9:8,"He stretches out the heavens," he says:הס הגלגלים המקיפים אשר בתנועתם עומדים הארץ וצבאותם. In discussing ll:8's unfathomable dimensions of the universe, he divulges these interests by citing Sefer Yetsira as an authority: ובעל ספר היצירה הזכירם ואמר אשר שאין להם סוף ומהם עומק רום ועמק תחת. 3 According to certain medieval philosophers such as Abraham ibn Ezra,"man is a microcosm, a universe in little, for like the great universe he consists of a body animated by a soul". See I. Husik, A History of Medieval Jewish Philosophy, Atheneum, New York, 1969, 191. 4 See J. Kimhi, Sepher Sikkaron, Berlin, 1888, 6. 5 For ibn Ezra only the rational soul is immortal and may return to the world soul at death. Wisdom, the knowledge of God, is the form of the soul. Undisciplined souls, which are overly suppressed by indulging the body, are destroyed (אבד) and are not reabsorbed in the world soul. Even in this lifetime union of the soul with the world soul is possible and man can escape evil. See Husik 291-2. A somewhat similar notion, albeit in different terms, is found in Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed 111,23 as an explanation of key passages in Job. 190</page></plain_text>
