Suddenly, pressure on what he knows is the brake seems to make the vehicle go faster. It is the panic of discovering that it (the system, self plus vehicle) is bigger than he is....

As Gravity's Rainbow opens, something is approaching London. Whatever is coming, it is not quite a scream, nor is it necessarily a screaming person or a screaming rocket; it is rather a screaming, a bodily expression of panic so disembodied that it only hints at a cause beyond itself. In short, the first line of the novel contains an agency dilemma characteristic of those to follow: an unsettling bodily phenomenon manifests itself; its cause has been obscured from sight; and the difficulty of reading it has to do with the way a comforting metaphysical separation between cause and For their comments and advice about earlier drafts of this essay, I would like to thank Mark Seltzer, Stephanie Vaughn, Naomi Morgenstern, Paul Downes, and especially Molly Hite.

Materially speaking, it is a letter. It is, as British agent Pirate Prentice says to himself, "incoming mail" (6)-not just military slang for the Nazi V-2 rocket about to arrive in London, but, quite literally, incoming mail, for hidden in a capsule aboard that rocket is a letter, sent to Prentice by a double agent in Holland. The consider- able "bodiliness" of this letter-which I will take up momen- tarily-is rivaled only by the bodily correspondence which appears to mark its delivery: like every V-2 in Gravity's Rainbow, this initial rocket arrives in London exactly where American lieutenant Tyrone Slothrop has had sex not long before. Not only, then, does the rocket deliver mail; it appears to have been delivered as if it were mail. This latter form of correspondence-the bizarre but unmistak- able geographical relation between Slothrop's penis and the subse- quent landing of the rockets-is the novel's most significant, and most commented upon, agency problem. In the pages to follow, I will suggest that this agency problem and others like it mark a new way of thinking about the status of the body in relation to global communications and social systems, a radical reimagining of the relations between persons, bodies, and discursive structures. I will also suggest how agency panic-the crisis of apparently imperiled individual autonomy-both registers anxieties about threatening systems of mass control and helps to sustain the idea of autono- mous individuality against such threats. For now, I want to sketch out the main features of the novel's agency dilemmas by looking at the brief scene in which Pirate Prentice anxiously reads his airborne letter-or, rather, writes it, since what arrives via rocket is only a blank scrap of paper. On that paper, a coded message has been written in "kryptosam," an invisi- ble chemical reagent that becomes visible skin pigment upon re- action with seminal fluid. The reading of this mail must therefore be mediated by male sexual desire: Prentice has to ejaculate onto the scrap of paper in order to decipher the message, and an erotic drawing of a woman is enclosed to provide the "proper stimulus" 1. For an interesting account of some of the theoretical problems generated by the novel's opening, see Redfield.</page><page sequence="3">M E L L EY ? 7 11 for the reading. But there is something uncanny about the effi- ciency of this drawing in producing desire. It has come from some- one who does not know Prentice intimately, and yet it depicts a personal fantasy he has never mentioned, an erotic idea closely allied with his sense of individuality. This odd coincidence (coinci- dence?) produces a moment of panic. The drawing, which features "a dead ringer" for one of Prentice's old flames, presents a complex scene that he daydreamed about often enough but never- No, of course he never told her. He never told anyone. Like every young man growing up in England, he was conditioned to get a hardon in the presence of certain fetishes, and then conditioned to feel shame about his new reflexes. Could there be, somewhere, a dossier, could They (They?) somehow have managed to monitor everything he saw and read since puberty . . . how else would They know?2 (71-72) At the center of this melodrama of agents and reagents is a serious question about agency, about what it means to be in control of one's own actions. Prentice's panic turns on the uncanny sense that he is not only out of control-he "barely gets his cock out of his trousers before he's spurting all over the place" (72)-but that he is under the control of someone or something else. I say "uncanny" because, as in Freud's treatment of the unheimlich, something which "ought to have remained secret and hidden. . . has come to light," and it "forces upon us the idea of something fateful and inescapable when otherwise we should have spoken only of 'chance'" ("Uncanny" 225,237). That utterly familiar "something," in this case, is a fantasy which forms a significant part of Prentice's identity as an individ- ual. Although it is heimlich-both "familiar" and "concealed, kept from sight" ("Uncanny" 222-23)-it nonetheless arrives at, or is returned to, its place via airmail. Not long afterward, Prentice is figured as an automaton (the quintessential embodiment of the un- canny and its theory), his "robot hands" (72) searching for vouchers 2.

But perhaps this is to understand agency, as recent cultural criti- cism has done, too much as a "property" of the subject-a sort of "pure" autonomy and volition-and to forget an older sense of the agent as "middleman," or "factor." In fact, the passage I have been discussing registers some of the tension present in the terms "agent" and "agency" themselves-terms which have historically signified both autonomous action and instrumentality.4 What is unusually uncanny about Prentice's apparent loss of autonomy (or "agency" in the dominant current sense) is the way his body becomes a factor (or "agent" in the older sense) assisting in the return of the (un)fa- miliar to its place: he must reconstruct the message using his penis as a pen or prosthesis, so that he can, in turn, read a message written in the bodily medium of skin pigment. This mode of com- munication has serious consequences for a model of persons as autonomous individuals. If Prentice's body can be used as a factor (or facteur, postman) in the transmission of information around the globe, then, at very least, his autonomy is not as great as he thought. At most, his person-that which defines and controls him-has 3. The sensation of the uncanny turns on a difficulty in recognizing whether trou- bling and apparently significant events are wholly internal (that is, "familiar" or "homely"), or whether they are external and "unfamiliar "-an uncertainty also central to paranoia. (In fact, Freud relates the sense of "doubling" in the uncanny to the self-critical func- tions of mind that are central to "the pathological case of delusions of being watched" [235].) Of course, Freud argues that such splits and uncertain moments are internal to the subject, who only experiences them as strange or unfamiliar after "alienating" them from consciousness "through the process of repression" (241). I return to these issues in the fourth part of this essay. 4. In the Oxford English Dictionary, "agency" usually means either "active working" and "action" or "instrumentality" and "intermediation." In 1830, Coleridge wrote of "personal free agency," a coupling which appears to govern the recent sense of "agency" as autonomy and freedom. For a concise history of the legal concept of agency, see James Beniger (132-42). In mid-nineteenth-century America, Beniger explains, the "general laws of agency" (135) were established precisely because agents had become too autono- mous and needed to be held legally responsible for actions which departed from the explicit demands of their (often distant) principles. In other words, the general laws of "agency" made agents anything but autonomous.</page><page sequence="5">ME L L EY ? 713 been dispersed into a network extending far beyond his individual, material body. The narrative itself appears to offer two competing explanations for this uncanny invasion of privacy. The first is that a dangerous, monolithic "They" may mysteriously gain access to an individual's private fantasies for regulatory purposes. The second is that sexual desire is, in fact, mass-produced, by something like Pavlovian con- ditioning: desire is first given an object when young men are "con- ditioned to get a hardon" in the presence of generic representations of the female body, and then it is driven into secret when they are "conditioned to feel shame." In such a regime, desire is generic but seems nonetheless to be individual, because each individual is con- ditioned in private. In other words, Prentice's "individual" fantasy may be knowable precisely because it is not individual at all. More than anything else, these opposed accounts register the difficulty of "locating" agency or control in either individuals or social systems. Together they mark the response I am calling "agency panic"-the melodrama of apparently depleted individual self- control, often, but misleadingly, conflated with a more general paranoia.5 This response typically involves both a recognition of 5. My discussion of this response is indebted to Mark Seltzer's extraordinary study of "the problem of the body in machine culture"-particularly to his sense of the cultural work done by what he terms "melodramas of uncertain agency" (Bodies and Machines, esp. 17-21, 84,155-56). "Paranoia" is a favorite term of Pynchon's and a perennial subject in Pynchon criticism, but its implications of mental illness risk trivializing the most serious ontological and rhetorical difficulties of Pynchon's novel. As Leo Bersani puts it, paranoid thinking in Gravity's Rainbow "is probably justified, and therefore-at least in the traditional sense of the word-really not paranoid at all" (101). Bersani goes on to illustrate powerfully the ways in which theory itself continually threatens to be "a paranoid symptom," because "The theoretician's distrust of theory-the sense that what theory seeks to signify is hidden somewhere behind it-repeats the paranoid's distrust of the visible" (101). Paranoia thus comes into alignment with interpretation in general. The moments I am concerned with in this paper revolve around a narrower set of concerns, concerns clearly related to paranoia's frenetic impulse toward interpretation, but more fruitfully specified through the categories of action and self-control. Though not the case with Bersani and other recent work (B6rube, McHoul and Wills, Berressem), the category of paranoia has often been used in Pynchon criticism as a way of short- circuiting these issues. Scott Sanders, for example, continually implies that Pynchon's characters suffer from pathological delusions. But the fact that the characters are ob- sessed with and paranoid about their paranoia suggests that agency dilemmas in this novel are designed to keep accounts like Sanders's in constant play with those of readers</page><page sequence="6">71 4 CON T E MPORARY LITERATURE the way subjects may be controlled by social formations (including discourses, narratives, and institutions) and a rejection of that knowledge. In the scene at hand, for example, the explanation based on cultural conditioning is a systemic description of the way entire populations of individuals may be both created and controlled by the dissemination of certain cultural forms-an account which begins to erode notions of individual action and motive. The first explanation, on the other hand-Prentice's attribution of control to a mysterious "Them"-centers on an individual experience. Paradox- ically, this explanation conserves the very concepts of individuality and autonomous subjectivity apparently under threat, and it does so by assigning the most threatened qualities of that subjectivity- intention and coherent action-to a social or systemic level. There is, of course, a third possible explanation for the uncanny events in this scene. They could be accidents or coincidences, and Prentice's fears about them could be mere paranoia. To stabilize the uncertain status of agency in the passage would mean choosing between these alternatives, taking a position-but that is just what the passage seems designed to prevent. The narrator slides surrep- titiously between Prentice's "private" thoughts and a position of rather detached, but still limited, omniscience. A similar ambiva- lence is written into the thematics of the scene: a nearly unreadable correspondence between Prentice's person and a global network comes to light through the production of nearly unreadable episto- lary correspondence. In reading the latter, Prentice appears to be receiving information from the outside and, simultaneously, to be producing it with his person; he does not have a stable position as either reader or writer. By analogy, any attempt to read the former correspondence-to decide whether the whole uncanny set of events is motivated or accidental-might result in the same thing: the transformation of this veiled correspondence into a more visible message, but a message whose "production" has been mediated by the desire of its reader. Given all of this, it is significant that this little scene of agency panic is provoked by the arrival of a letter "at its destination" like Deborah Madsen, who claims, for example, that "Slothrop is ... an explicit case of a pervasive programme of cultural conditioning" (85).</page><page sequence="7">MELLEY ? 715 (Lacan 53). That trope was central to Pynchon's second novel, in which a subterranean postal system, glimpsed through unsettling "chance" events and uncanny patterns, appeared to be sorting and distributing secret information as if it had motives of its own.6 But the trope of arriving letters has also been important to literary theory-particularly to a debate over the agency of letters in Edgar Allan Poe's "Purloined Letter"-because it functions as a figure for problems of agency in signification. Like Prentice's letter, the pur- loined letter is what Jacques Lacan calls a nonfunctional signifier, because "the tale leaves us in virtually total ignorance of the sender, no less than of the contents, of the letter" (41); yet, Lacan notes, the movement of the letter "determines the subjects in their acts, in their destiny" (43)-again, in much the same way that Prentice and Slothrop appear to be defined and controlled by the arrival of in- coming mail. I say "appear" because Gravity's Rainbow only puts into question whether persons are controlled or "constructed" by discursive or social systems: the uncanny sense of control conveyed by all of the novel's "mail" (rockets and letters alike) may be only the result of a paranoid reading of accidents. Jacques Derrida sug- gests largely the same thing about Lacan's reading of Poe: Lacan's assertion that "a letter always arrives at its destination" (53)-that certain patterns of meaning and behavior are inevitable-cannot, in Derrida's view, account for the possibility of accidental, lost, or residual meaning. Derrida goes on to accuse Lacan of "finding" the truth of psychoanalysis (the "law of the signifier and of castration as the contract of truth" [Post Card 441-42]) wherever he looks, by ignoring the disseminating power of language.7 Again, Gravity's Rainbow appears uncannily to literalize the terms of this debate: Slothrop narrowly and accidentally misses being castrated, only to be disseminated bodily across a continent. But I draw attention to these parallels less for thematic reasons than to suggest that issues of bodily control and threatened individ- 6. See McHoul and Wills for a sophisticated reading of "postal systems" in Pynchon's Crying of Lot 49 and Derrida's Post Card. 7. It is impossible for me to do justice to the scope or intricacy of this debate between Lacan and Derrida, which has itself inspired a large and impressive body of critical writing. For a collection of some of this work, see Muller and Richardson.</page><page sequence="8">716 * CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE ual autonomy in Gravity's Rainbow are closely related to interpretive questions which have been of interest to recent critical theory.8 In the instances I just sketched, the central interpretive question seems to be whether meaningful events are directed by a supremely compe- tent mailman-a symbolic order or a "Them"-or whether they are merely made meaningful by a discourse (psychology) or a psychosis (paranoia) which finds everything significant. This problem-the absence of a "Real Text" (Gravity's Rainbow 520) or metanarrative that would stabilize signification and control the endless play of language-has been foundational for poststructuralism. Perhaps not surprisingly, poststructuralist solutions to these problems have given rise to melodramas of lost agency similar in structure to the one I outlined earlier; in these theoretical dramas, poststructural accounts of signifying systems come into conflict with accounts critical of the apparent transfer of agency from individual authors and readers to texts or textuality in general. As M. H. Abrams recently said in a defense of humanist criticism, poststructuralist practice results in a "theory world, in which people are not agents but agencies, not users of language but used by language, not effectors but themselves only effects" (13). But to say that a discourse has its own "secret workings" (Abrams 7) or "tactics" (Foucault 95)-that it appears, in short, to be a "Them"-is only another way of formulating the problem of agency dramatized bodily in Gravity's Rainbow. And this is not sim- ply because "there is nothing outside of the text" (Derrida, Gram- matology 158), but because in Gravity's Rainbow the body is already a medium of communication. The Body We Can Measure Reading the body is an essential act in Gravity's Rainbow, and the novel's bodies signify in many ways: spies tattoo messages under their moustaches (16); Thanatz reads the scars on Greta Erdmann's back (484); a colonel's hair is a "perfect grating" on which various messages have been "written" (643); and Rollo Groast suggests that 8. For an account of the ways critical theory (primarily that of Lacan, Derrida, and Baudrillard) may be used to rethink subjectivity in Pynchon's novels, see Berressem, esp. 15-50.</page><page sequence="9">ME L L EY ? 7 17 all bodily oddities may be part of a "clandestine drama for which the human body serves only as a set of very allusive, often cryptic programme-notes-it's as if the body we can measure is a scrap of this programme found outside in the street, near a magnificent stone theatre we cannot enter" (147-48). The notion that the body could signify in unimaginable ways underwrites much of Gravity's Rainbow. Slothrop's body, in particular, is a source of intense interest and intense anxiety because it appears to be a locus in which global information and individual sexual desire have been coordinated in a single, hidden, regulatory formula.9 The secret it holds promises to be the truth of the novel, and much of Gravity's Rainbow is a narrative of the various tactics employed to discover and control this truth. Molly Hite has pointed out that this investigatory ap- paratus-indeed, nearly every element of the novel-falls into an "austere metaphysical binarism" (13). A number of critics have mapped this scheme in detail, suggesting that it is part of a range of world views, a snapshot of the "full range of knowledge and be- liefs" of a culture (Mendelson 162).10 What such important map- pings often overlook, however, is the way opposed approaches are coordinated in a single "regulatory" capacity, designed not only to frustrate the hermeneutical questions posed by the text, but also to dramatize uncertainty about how to understand individual human agency in relation to social systems. To illustrate the work done by the novel's binarism, I will briefly consider two of the most prominent sciences applied to Slothrop's body, Pavlovian psychology and statistics, which attempt to ac- 9. The idea that a body could be coordinated with the movement of rockets is not confined to Gravity's Rainbow. In 1948, Norbert Wiener claimed that the self-propelled rockets of World War II were modeled on the human body and that the body was indispensable in accounting for them: "They contain sense-organs, effectors and the equivalent of a nervous system to integrate the transfer of information from the one to the other. They lend themselves very well to description in physiological terms. It is scarcely a miracle that they can be subsumed under one theory with the mechanisms of physiology" (55). 10. See also Friedman and Puetz, and Cooper. Alec McHoul and David Wills offer a radically different account of the way binary oppositions function in this novel, suggest- ing that each rhetorical pair comes into "equivalence" with an object. This equivalence (or "material typonymy") is not final-but rather may come, itself, into equivalence with another object, and so on, so that an origin or governing final term is endlessly deferred.</page><page sequence="10">71 8 CON T E MPORARY LITERATURE count for the behavior of individuals and populations, respectively. Edward Pointsman and Roger Mexico, the respective practitioners of these two sciences, frequently debate the merits of each in read- ing the Slothrop problem. While Pointsman expresses his faith in "true mechanical explanation"-"no effect without cause, and a clear train of linkages"-Mexico argues that "the next great break- through may come when we have the courage to junk cause-and- effect entirely, and strike off at some other angle" (89). As other readers have noted, the rather schematic antithesis embodied in these two men points to their function as surrogate readers stand- ing in for radically different attitudes toward the production of meaning. One of these attitudes, represented by Pointsman, is a hermeneutics: a dizzying pursuit of clues, a peeling away of layers in search of a cause, a linear movement toward points of origin. The other, represented by Mexico, is a poetics: an examination of maps, a search for explanatory schemes and metaphors, a horizontal movement from one set of coordinates to another. Pynchon is quite explicit about the roles of other characters in this binary reading scheme. As Franz and Leni Pokler argue, for example, we are told that Franz is "the cause-and-effect man," while Leni favors correla- tive explanatory schemes: "It all goes together," she says. "Parallel, not series. Metaphor. Signs and symptoms. Mapping on to different coordinate systems" (159). Here, correlation is related to its linguistic counterparts, metaphor and paradigm, while causality is linked to metonymy and syntax. These relations suggest an interesting conse- quence. If correlative and causal models are really analogous to the semantic axes of language, then they cannot function independently of each other. Furthermore, to choose between rival readings would be like trying to choose between metonymy and metaphor, paradigm and syntax-an absurd proposition, since one cannot read unless both semantic functions are simultaneously at work.11 I want to suggest, then, that these opposed reading positions func- tion as elements of a single strategy: first a secret appears, then the two rival discursive approaches revolve around this central secret in apparent investigative competition, while, in fact, each requires and 11. For a very different reading of this passage, see Joseph Tabbi, who argues that Pynchon privileges "signs and symptoms" over "causes" (165).</page><page sequence="11">ME L L E Y 7 19 reinforces the other as much as it requires that the secret remain a secret. And what is significant about the central secret of Gravity's Rainbow-Slothrop's odd relation to the rocket-is not only that it generates uneasiness about agency or signification, but that it is a sexual secret. As Michel Foucault has suggested, sex has long been "a general signification, a universal secret, an omnipresent cause" (69); it has become "the stamp of individuality," and thus "a means of access both to the life of the body and the life of the species" (146). This is precisely what the novel's odd premise registers: Slothrop's most individuating. feature is sexual in nature, and yet that feature appears to be coordinated with the life of an entire population. In other words, much like Prentice's erotic fantasy, Slothrop's sexual be- havior begins to make visible the relation between individual bodies and social bodies. By using the very "stamp of individuality" as the medium in which information is moved across the globe, Pynchon throws into question where persons end and populations begin. To put the matter somewhat differently, if, as Foucault suggests, sex has become the focus of diverse tactics applied to both individ- ual bodies and whole populations, then in Gravity's Rainbow diverse tactics may be applied to a single person, whose most private acts, or private parts, already appear to be tied to the life of a vast population. These "tactics" are embodied in the two discourses that form the binary reading scheme I outlined above. Pynchon's binary scheme thus bears an uncanny resemblance to the "great bi-polar technology" which Foucault claims reinvented the subject, using sex as a central site of discipline and regulation: On the one hand [sex] was tied to the disciplines of the body.... On the other hand, it was applied to the regulation of populations .... It fitted in both categories at once, giving rise to infinitesimal surveillances, perma- nent controls, extremely meticulous orderings of space, indeterminate medical or psychological examinations, to an entire micro-power con- cerned with the body. But it gave rise as well to comprehensive measures, statistical assessments, and interventions aimed at the entire social body or at groups taken as a whole. (145-46) In Foucault's account, the individual body and the social body structure these two sets of interventions, respectively. Although the "body" in each case is different, the shared term is essential, be-</page><page sequence="12">720 * CON T E MPORARY LITERATURE cause it suggests that the disciplines and the regulations are essen- tially similar, that they are each part of a single strategy applied to analogous objects. The same is true in Gravity's Rainbow. While Pointsman focuses on the individual, material body of Slothrop, Mexico focuses on the figurative, social body, "Lady London." While Pointsman "imagines the cortex of the brain as a mosaic of tiny on/off elements," Mexico views London as a mosaic of rocket strikes spread across a ruled map (55). In fact, neither science can do without the other. The true object of their mutual interest is a relation between the bodies each of them is studying. They appear then to constitute complementary aspects of a single strategy at work reconceptualizing the person. But a strategy articulated by whom? This is a question repeatedly inspired by Foucault's work (and a question to which I shall re- turn). It is also what Roger Mexico begins to wonder one day while he and Pointsman walk along the cliffs of Dover, arguing. As Mex- ico realizes the congruity of their "rival" activities, he begins to panic, imagining that they themselves are data on some ineffably large "cortex," a bodily site of information-processing: They've paused in their walking. Roger stares back at [Pointsman]. The Antimexico. "Ideas of the opposite" themselves, but on what cortex, what winter hemisphere? What ruinous mosaic, facing outward into the Waste ... outward from the sheltering city . . . readable only to those who journey outside ... eyes in the distance ... barbarians ... riders.... (89) In this brief fantasy, it is hard to tell whether the narration is coming from deep inside Mexico or is detached and speculative. In fact, the instability of the narrator's position dramatizes the central feature of agency panic itself: the difficulty of locating where actions origi- nate and who or what controls them. Mexico's panic, like Prentice's, arises in a moment in which his material body seems like nothing more than information in a much larger network. From his own perspective, he and Pointsman are persons who hold diametrically opposed positions on the interpretation of certain data-"if ever the Antipointsman existed, Roger Mexico is the man" (55)-but, from the perspective eventually obtained here, they themselves are data, in binary form, on a larger "cortex," a massive body.</page><page sequence="13">ME L L E Y ? 721 This latter perspective-the perspective of "eyes" gazing down and finding a binary data to be "readable" information-is of course the perspective of readers, the view which sees Pynchon's binary reading scheme. But it is also the perspective of "Them." Agency panic, in other words, may be understood as a moment in which characters suspect that they are, in fact, characters, being constructed and observed by agents beyond their control. More generally, it is a moment in which persons feel subject to the very modes of control they themselves have exercised. Here, as Points- man ("the Antimexico") reads a mosaic of binary-coded neural switches on the surface of individual brains, and Mexico ("the Anti- pointsman") reads a mosaic of binary-coded rocket strikes on the surface of Lady London, we are reading a mosaic of binary-coded characters on the "cortex" of the novel, a "ruinous mosaic, facing outward into the Waste." The object of study at each level is either a person or a personification-but the question is, which? Each object is equally unstable, always threatening to reveal itself a mere cog in a larger, determining "consciousness." This instability is a constant feature of Gravity's Rainbow, and it can become quite extreme. Later, the novel will dramatize the journey of skin cells to the epidermal layer as if cells were persons (148), and later still, it will suggest that Earth "is a living critter," that the globe itself has "a body and psyche" (590). In such moments the novel embraces what Dorion Sagan has termed the new biology's "radical re-rendering of the body": "a breakdown of the medically proper animal body" sug- gesting "correspondences among prokaryotic, eukaryotic, zoologi- cal and geophysiological (Gaian) levels. It now appears that a type of individuality has appeared at each of these levels" (363). In other words, it is difficult to read this novel and hold to an account of individual agency in which, as Max Weber puts it, 'Action in the sense of a subjectively understandable orientation of behaviour ex- ists only as the behaviour of one or more individual human beings . . . since these alone can be treated as agents" (101). Rather, as systems theorist Niklas Luhmann has suggested, "cells and soci- eties, maybe physical atoms, certainly immune systems and brains, are all individuals. Conscious systems have no exceptional status. They are a particular type" (116). Gravity's Rainbow regularly denies the conscious systems of individual persons such "exceptional sta-</page><page sequence="14">722 CON T E MPORAR Y LITERATURE tus." But its characters and its narrator often take Luhmann's in- sight in a different direction: they retain the "exceptional status" of conscious systems by attributing consciousness to all kinds of sys- tems, including atoms, cells, cartels, and economies. This response typifies the crisis of threatened agency in this novel. A self-regu- lating (social) system appears to threaten a model of personhood in which the individual human body is the privileged site of autono- mous, original, motivated social action; in an attempt to conserve the attributes of this model of individuality, individuals assign those attributes to the system as a whole; but they also recognize that the system may govern itself through aggregate effects and that the logic of individual motive and agency will not quite work to explain it. The result is panic about the difficulty of locating control at any one level of existence-the difficulty, in other words, in deciding what a person is. Pornographies of Deduction I have sketched some of the ways in which the scientific apparatus deployed to study Slothrop only produces, or reproduces at a higher level, the problems of agency it set out to study in the first place. One register of this pattern is the degree to which the scien- tific discourses applied to the novel's sexual secret are themselves continually eroticized, even treated as forms of pornography or "pornographies of deduction" (155).12 Pointsman views "The Book" (a collection of Pavlov's letters) as "a rare work of erotica" (87-88). Mexico finds himself displaying "a pornography customer's reflex" to the acquisition of microfilms relevant to his work (35). And the technologically miraculous V-2 rocket is continually figured as a phallus engaged with "Lady London" in intercourse so violent that it ends in "terminal orgasm" (223). In the peculiar case of Slothrop, the structural similarity between the ideologies of "external" obser- 12. Michael Berube, following Leo Bersani, aligns paranoia with interpretation in general and goes on to suggest that when the paranoid search for an organic whole comes to rest, "it is no longer a paranoia but, in Pynchon's terms, a pornography" (238). For Berube, Pynchon's use of the term "pornography" indicates "a regressive anamnesia that recreates illusory, prelapsarian (or prelinguistic) unities through a complex mecha- nism of dismemberment and reconfiguration" (248).</page><page sequence="15">ME L L EY ? 7 23 vation common to science and pornography is obvious. The variety of experiments designed to expose, explain, and control Slothrop's body share in the very erotics which are their object-if only because their central dogma requires a methodological structure barely sep- arable from voyeurism. Stephen Dodson-Truck, for example, eventu- ally confesses that his task has been to watch Slothrop have sex with an operative named Katje: "My 'function' is to observe you. That's my function. You like my function? You like it? Your 'function' . . . is, learn the rocket, inch by inch. I have ... to send in a daily log of your progress. And that's all I know" (216). In moments like this the desire to measure erotic desire gets at the potential circularity of the project; desire is incited by the use of Katje so that desire can in turn be measured by a hidden "recording eye" (216). And measurement "without passion" is not so easy; even the impotent Dodson-Truck admits that he masturbates about "half the time" during these keyhole observations (216). But who is watching whom is the salient issue here, for as Dod- son-Truck blunders through his confession, he and Slothrop are under the gaze of enormous "robed figures" on the horizon, hundreds of miles tall-their faces, serene, unattached, like the Buddha's, bending over the sea, impassive, indeed, as the Angel that stood over Lii- beck during the Palm Sunday raid, come that day neither to destroy nor to protect, but to bear witness to a game of seduction. It was the next-to-last step London took before her submission ... because sending the RAF to make a terror raid against civilian Liibeck was the unmistakable long look that said hurry up and fuck me, that brought the rockets hard and screaming. (214-15; ellipsis added) As the narrative shuttles us between individual and population, between Dodson-Truck's surveillance of Slothrop and this super- natural surveillance of the world, it begins to figure the war itself in sexual terms. Not only do the figures function by a male rape logic-in this account Lady London begs for the violence of the German technological phallus-but they posit another observer who has no intention of acting ("to destroy or protect"), only of watching the sexual spectacle. This novel insists upon locating geo- political conflict in the body, whether it is the signifying body of Slothrop or the figurative "bodies politic" of the sort exemplified</page><page sequence="16">724 * CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE above. In each case, it raises the bodies in question to the level of erotic spectacle-as though the secret of the war were the secret of sexuality itself and that secret might be gleaned by a voyeuristic fascination with the pornographized body. The fundamental prem- ises of the book ensure that the desire to understand Slothrop's odd talent is the desire to understand desire itself-to access the inmost reaches of an individual in an attempt to stabilize the plaguing problem of uncertain agency-and that to do so one must assume the position of an "external" observer: a scientist, a voyeur, a reader. But I have already suggested how this novel complicates one's ability to assume a position. In the passage above, as parallel local and global scenes unfold around him, Dodson-Truck, attempting to account for a hidden relation between local and global, feels himself subject to the very same visual technology he employed to study Slothrop. At a moment in which he publicly recognizes the voyeuris- tic nature of his official "function," his position as sole overseer of a body becomes unstable-and, more importantly, so does his status as a person. He nervously repeats the word "function" because he feels subject to a power structure that controls persons-or maybe even constructs them-with mathematical precision. "We're all such mechanical men," he says. "I'm an impotent man" (216). These sexual spectacles reveal both his sexual inadequacy and his more general powerlessness in the terrifying and vague bureaucracy he serves. Slothrop feels something of the same dynamic in trying to under- stand his own sexual desire. When he runs into Margherita Erd- mann, for example, he reveals that he has been given false identity papers naming him Max Schlepzig, Erdmann's old counterpart in the pornographic film Alpdriicken. "The name's just a random alias," he says, but she disagrees: "Random.... Another fairy-tale word. The signature on your card is Max's.... Don't you think I know that Latin z, crossed engineer-style, the flower he made out of the g at the end? You could hunt all the Zone for your 'forger.' They wouldn't let you find him. They want you right here, right now." (395; ellipses added) Before he knows it, Slothrop finds himself engaged in a sadomas- ochistic encounter reminiscent of those in Alpdriicken. Although he has never met Erdmann before or seen her on film, he finds "some-</page><page sequence="17">ME L L EY ? 7 25 body has already educated him" in how to torture her perfectly (396). What is in question, then, is either his autonomy or his indi- viduality-just as was the case with Prentice. Simply by moving to a new position in the Zone, Slothrop finds himself behaving as though he were the person who occupied it formerly-in the most personal, apparently individual way. Perhaps more importantly, though, he finds himself acting out-or being acted out by-a sexual fantasy of violent control. In the story of sadomasochism derived from Hegel's account of master and slave, the fantasy of erotic domination is about the affirmation of individuality and agency. As Jessica Benjamin has argued, sadomasochism is about the need for recognition as an autonomous agent-precisely the status Slothrop finds challenged here. But the paradoxical logic of recognition is that the more one demands recognition as an agent, the more one is dependent upon another for that recognition. In other words, the contradictory dy- namics of agency panic appear to be built into the fantasy of domi- nation. "In adult erotic domination," Benjamin says, "both partners are involved in controlling the other to conform to a fantasy.... The aliveness and spontaneity that come from an unscripted relation- ship is missing" (293). The desire to "act out" one's agency appears to undermine the possibility of individual agency; the more Slothrop asserts his control over Erdmann, the more he submits to a pre- scripted role in a pornographic film. Like Bateson's alcoholic, his attempt at "self-control" only propels him further out of control- leading to a state of panic in which he recognizes that "the system ... is bigger than he is" (330). These dynamics also suggest why Dodson-Truck, Prentice, Pokler, Erdmann, Slothrop, and many of Pynchon's other characters become so anxious about their auton- omy in moments of erotic desire. Desires that should be the "stamp of [their] individuality" (Foucault 146) turn out to be precisely the opposite. Indeed, when Alpdriicken was first released, the narrator tells us, countless men (Pokler included) "carried the same image" home and impersonated Schlepzig, re-enacting the film's violent in- tercourse with their wives (396). The film itself, by this account, supervised the mass-production of children. In moments of "impersonation" like these, characters often imag- ine their actions to be governed by cultural or discursive systems.</page><page sequence="18">72 6 CON T E MPORARY LITERATURE In the sadomasochistic scene I just described, the narrator suggests that Slothrop's desire is produced by women's lingerie-a condi- tioned stimulus which, like film, has an explicitly mathematical structure governing a whole range of aesthetically pleasing images: It's easy for non-fetishists to sneer about Pavlovian conditioning and let it go at that, but any underwear enthusiast worth his unwholesome giggle can tell you there is much more here-there is a cosmology: of nodes and cusps and points of osculation, mathematical kisses ... singularities! (396) Here the narrative expands upon Dodson-Truck's earlier sugges- tion that a set of mathematical "functions" could be embedded in social structures for the purpose of regulating individual behavior. The specific mathematics at work producing Slothrop's desire is that of "singularities": points in a function where the rate of change of one variable becomes infinite, and thus "the behavior of the function ceases to be mathematically expressible, except in a purely formal way" (Hayles 191). In other words, the graph of such a function would only be approximate: two curves rising asymp- totically toward a point but never meeting, leaving a textual ab- sence at the singular point. Singularities exceed representation and are thus a mathematical version of the sublime. "Singularities!," says the narrator, "the change from point to no-point carries a luminosity and enigma at which something in us must leap and sing, or withdraw in fright" (396). In other words, textual absence, and the inadequacy of the imagination in its presence, is what provokes the sublime emotions of elation or terror. In a case where a subject's imagination is inadequate to account for an apparent loss of his or her own autonomy, sublime object and awed subject come together in the sublime erotics of agency panic. In the case at hand, that panic is marked in part by the apparent transfer of individual- ity-or "singularity"-from the body of a person to the discourse of mathematics. In the narrator's account of Slothrop's increasing desire, the mathematical rigor of Erdmann's lingerie, and the erotic enigma it represents, appears to determine Slothrop's behavior with her; but for Slothrop the truly terrifying, singular absence in the scene is Slothrop-his absence from himself, his inability to under- stand his own uncontrollable response.</page><page sequence="19">ME L L EY ? 7 27 Writing about how a "symbol only of an absence"-in this case not a mathematical singularity, but a letter-can "determine" a series of subjects in relation to it, Lacan says, between letter and place exist relations for which no French word has quite the extension of the English adjective odd. Bizarre, by which Baudelaire regularly translates it, is only approximate. Let us say that these relations are . . . singuliers, for they are the very ones maintained with place by the signifier. (38; ellipsis in original) "Singuliers," because "bizarre" does not get at the mathematical na- ture of individuation, the power of place within a structure to determine the subject.13 Slothrop's place in the Zone appears to determine his actions throughout the novel, but now the mathe- matical model at hand specifies the "nature" which allows these continual impersonations: Slothrop himself is a singularity. His bodily oddity represents a structure exceeding his ability to repre- sent it adequately, and that structure, in turn, appears to be respon- sible for determining, or constructing, his person. But the direction of these intriguing relays is never clear, because the nature of Slothrop's "nature" is eroticized absence-eroticized not merely in that his body is studied pornographically, or that his most unique quality is sexual in nature, but in that his sublime body keeps its own truth hidden so that a game of hermeneutical flirtation must be played in the process of unveiling it. Could In and Out Be Part of the Same Field? Discourses which claim to resolve problems of agency and deter- minism usually rely on a model of material individuality with a strictly controlled rhetoric of inside and outside. Consider, for ex- ample, Freud's own early remarks on agency and chance: 13. In fact, Lacan argues that even matters of chance may be said to have a mathe- matically describable pattern. In one of several essays appended to his "Seminar on 'The Purloined Letter,'" he attempts to sketch the way laws of the unconscious might be mathematically formulated using cybernetic principles-the assumption being that "randomness" may always be said to fall into a mathematically describable pattern, and specifically into a sequence of O's and l's, which makes it possible to think of symbolic place as either presence or absence. The very notion of so-called free association, for example, depends heavily upon this idea of unconscious determination. (See Muller and Richardson 67-75.)</page><page sequence="20">728 CO N T E M P O R A RY IT E R AT URE I believe in external (real) chance, it is true, but not in internal (psychical) accidental events. With the superstitious person it is the other way round.... He has a tendency to ascribe to external chance happenings a meaning which will become manifest in real events, and to regard such chance happenings as a means of expressing something that is hidden from him in the external world. (Psychopathology 257) Freud's self-sure distinction between rational and superstitious per- sons depends upon a careful separation of internal and external, psychic and physical-a separation marked by the border of the individual material body. I have already pointed to moments in Gravity's Rainbow where a "bad fit" between body and person is dramatized through panic about agency. But the novel at times challenges these categories explicitly. One morning in Berlin, for example: "Everything's been turned inside out.... The civilians are outside now, the uniforms inside. . . . Old men with their tins searching the ground for cigarette butts wear their lungs on their breasts" (373; ellipses added). This kind of radically embodied re- versal of the metaphysical underpinnings of individuality is re- peated throughout Gravity's Rainbow, and it is what allows Pynchon's characters to ascribe meanings to "external" happenings without merely being "superstitious" or "paranoid" in the pathological sense. Borders, fronts, lines, and boundaries are the structures most under question in this novel. Its mode of narration is "transmargi- nal," moving without transition from one character to the next and, as Molly Hite observes, effectively offering "multiple 'inside' per- spectives with no 'outside' standard against which to measure them" (144). After an early obsession with rhetorical and symbolic oppositions ("ideas of the opposite" [89]), the narrative moves through the Zone (a place where "categories have been blurred badly" [303]), and into a state of extreme metaphysical confusion in which "Outside and Inside [are] interpiercing one another too fast, too finely labyrinthine, for either category to have much hegemony any more" (681). This confusion helps explain the conflicted accounts of agency continually offered by Pynchon's characters. Prentice, for instance, when reading his letter, invokes the idea of external control, or "Them," despite the fact that he appears to understand the logic of</page><page sequence="21">ME L L EY ? 7 29 an immanent, culturally produced control. Similarly, Mexico finds that accidents with no clear cause tend to disable the very discipline which defines them as accidental: Mexico thinks [the Slothrop problem] a statistical oddity. But he feels the foundations of that discipline trembling a bit now, deeper than oddity ought to drive. Odd, odd, odd-think of the word: such white finality in its closing clap of tongue. It implies moving past the tongue-stop-be- yond the zero-and into the other realm. (85) This is the paradoxical logic of a statistics whose ontological foun- dations have been shaken: it counts on there being a very small percentage of oddities or "singularities" by chance, but when they appear they nonetheless seem to imply a hidden cause. Slothrop finds himself confronting the same difficulties when trying, during a game of roulette, to understand if "something was done to him" long ago: he's been snuggling up, masturbatorily scared-elated, to the disagreeable chance that exactly such Control might already have been put over him.... all in his life of what has looked free or random, is discovered to've been under some Control, all the time, the same as a fixed roulette wheel-where only destinations are important, attention is to long-term statistics, not individuals: and where the House always does, of course, keep turning a profit.... (209; first ellipsis added) It is significant that Slothrop's first sustained doubts about his au- tonomy come in a casino-a model of the way random individual events fall into regular patterns, if allowed to transpire within a "fixed" structure or system. Inside the casino, events appear vari- able, uncontrollable; outside, in the back office, however, balance sheets would suggest otherwise. Slothrop finds himself torn be- tween these two views when using the casino as a model of his own experience. On the one hand, he feels that "Their odds were never probabilities, but frequencies already observed" (208); on the other hand, he can only begin to understand the idea of his total deter- mination, and of chancelessness, as a "disagreeable chance." The structure of Slothrop's panic is significant: he can only un- derstand his own person by invoking the idea of embodied, exter-</page><page sequence="22">73 0 * CON T E MPORAR Y LITERATURE nal control, "Them"-and yet he does so in a casino, which he fully appreciates as a mathematical model of normative regulation through "attention to long-term statistics, not individuals." This conflicted response parallels the responses of Prentice, Dodson- Truck, Erdmann, and others to the same kind of situation. In each case, an individual arrives at a crisis in trying to theorize power. It is unclear in these moments whether power is located in an individ- ual agency or dispersed through the body politic; whether it is external to the subjects it governs, or immanent in those subjects; whether it is selective and prohibitive, or normative and regulatory. Foucault has delineated these alternate forms of power in detail, arguing that while a prohibitive, monarchical power gave way, cen- turies ago, to normative forms of power, we still conceive of power in the old way, "we still have not cut off the head of the king" (88- 89). In its modern form, according to Foucault, power is "a multi- plicity of force relations" in constant motion and interaction, "always local and unstable" (92, 93). It is "not in superstructural positions" but "comes from below" and "is everywhere" (94). Interestingly, this disembodied, mathematically modeled notion of power gives rise to an account of agency conflicted in much the same way as the accounts offered in Gravity's Rainbow: Power relations are both intentional and nonsubjective.... There is no power that is exercised without a series of aims and objectives. But this does not mean that it results from the choice or decision of an individual subject; let us not look for the headquarters that presides over its rational- ity.... The rationality of power is characterized by tactics that are often quite explicit at the restricted level where they are inscribed . . . yet it is often the case that no one is there to have invented them, and few who can be said to have formulated them. (94-95) The insistent language of intention in Foucault's writing-the con- stant reference to power's "tactics," "strategies," "aims and objec- tives"-offers to power the attributes of subjectivity, as if it consti- tuted a higher form of consciousness, a "Them"-precisely the idea Foucault is working so hard to deny in this passage. In fact, Foucault's frequent assertions that power is neither centralized nor has "at its apex an element which at least is not wholly bureau- cratic," as Weber claimed (Moore 124), are necessary to counter the</page><page sequence="23">ME L L E Y ? 731 rhetoric of personification in his own narratives, in which power and resistance are treated as subjects, tirelessly exfoliating and re- grouping across vague mathematical spaces, "furrowing across in- dividuals themselves" and eventually "forming a dense web that passes through apparatuses and institutions, without being exactly localized in them" (96). This superstructural view of power reduces an entire population to a mathematical grid, or cortex, on which the effects of power are visible. "Individual unities" appear only to be areas on the grid across which the flows and counterflows of power move. From the point of view which takes an interest in the flows of power, the category of the individual drops out in favor of fields of abstractly modeled information-functions, or "cosmologies of nodes and cusps and points of osculation" (Gravity's Rainbow 396). In the boundariless confusion of Gravity's Rainbow, when charac- ters imagine this viewpoint they find themselves unable to accept the sort of advice Foucault offers: faced with a power which seems "intentional," they assume a power which is also "subjective," even though it is never visible as a subject. Their panic then turns endlessly on whether control comes from inside or out-or, to say the same thing another way, on where their persons are bounded. As the panicked narrator asks late in the novel, "What if They find it convenient to preach an island of life surrounded by a void? Not just the Earth in space, but your own individual life in time? What if it's in Their interest to have you believing that?" (697). Without stable boundaries, the notion of persons as discrete individuals becomes suspect and finally threatens to fall away, leaving what Thomas Schaub calls "a continuity" (49) that transcends the individual, re- placing the idea of "'self' as consciousness and memory" with "'self' as intersection" (50). What is so troubling about this "continu- ity" is the way it resists theorization, the way it appears simul- taneously to be a vague mathematical grid and an immense in- dividual. Personalities Replaced by Abstractions of Power There is a moment in Pynchon's V in which Itague rebukes Kholsky. "Your beliefs are non-human," he says, "You talk of people as if they were point-clusters or curves on a graph." Kholsky replies, "So</page><page sequence="24">732 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE they are" (380). Gravity's Rainbow continually works along such trou- bling lines. How else can one come to terms with Slothrop, whose primary mode of interaction with others is impersonation, whose person is ultimately distributed across a continent, and whose most salient feature is a set of points on a map of London, a graphic representation of that which seems to be his most internal, individ- ual quality? The notion that persons may be understood or even produced by mathematical models is nothing new. Mark Seltzer has described in detail how American realism-naturalism employs "the deindivid- ualizing tendencies of statistics" to "provide models of individual- ization: models for the generic, typical or average man-what we might describe as the production of individuals as statistical per- sons" ("Statistical Persons" 90). While the "statistical persons" of realism embody the social by displaying an impossibly representa- tive combination of average qualities in a single body, Pynchon's characters embody the social by being statistical impossibilities, freaks, oddities: a man whose erections appear to predict rocket strikes, a spy who experiences other people's fantasies, a man who can change the color of his skin, and so on. The "individuality," or uniqueness, of these characters depends almost entirely upon the way they violate the notion of the individual, material body as the basis for a separate, autonomous, inviolable personhood. To put the same thing somewhat differently, these individual characters don't merely stand in for classes of persons; rather, nu- merous persons appear to stand in-or move through-these indi- vidual bodies. Take Pokler's daughter, Ilse, for example. After being conceived during a re-enactment of Alpdriicken, she later only exists for Pokler as a film, visiting him montage-fashion, one day, one frame, a year: "The rapid flashing of successive stills to counterfeit movement" used originally "in the process of inventing calculus ... had been extended past images on film, to human lives" (407; ellipsis added). Ilse's yearly visits create the "illusion of a single child" (422), even though Pokler is not quite sure if the Nazis send the same girl each time. "Ilse, some Ilse, has persisted beyond her cinema mother, beyond film's end" (429), he thinks. Yet, from his point of view, her existence as an individual body is less certain than her existence as a montage of individual bodies, an illusion</page><page sequence="25">ME L L EY ? 7 33 articulated by a calculus of personhood, by the very equations undergirding the technology of film. The same problems afflict Pokler himself, who eventually feels he is being abstracted from his material body into vaguer spaces: he would become aware of a drifting-away ... some assumption of Pokler into the calculations, drawings, graphs, and even what raw hardware there was ... each time, soon as it happened, he would panic, and draw back into the redoubt of waking Pokler, heart pounding, hands and feet aching, his breath catching in a small voiced hunh-Something was out to get him, something here, among the paper. (405-6) Here, the set of relays between a mathematical discourse and a person is clear: Pokler imagines himself both to inhabit and to be invaded by the mathematics he has developed. This contradictory effacement and return to the material body is marked most clearly by Pokler's "panic"; he "draws back" into his body just as an ab- stracting system of his own invention seems to pose a threat, to move outside his control. The business of rethinking the person along such abstract lines is heavily thematized in Gravity's Rainbow, primarily through the work of White Visitation scientists, who run statistical analyses, make maps of brain activity, use personality tests like the "Minne- sota Multiphasic Personality Inventory," and so on. At a seance one evening, psychological operations man Milton Gloaming explains that by plotting the frequency of words uttered during these se- ances he will be able to "develop a vocabulary of curves" for "cer- tain pathologies" and, in so doing, categorize spirits for the pur- pose of control: "Schizophrenics for example," he says, "tend to run a bit flatter in the upper part then progressively steeper-a sort of bow shape ... I think with this chap, this Roland, that we're onto a classical paranoiac" (32). The regulatory possibilities of a science which could redraw the lines around types of persons-healthy and ill, paranoid and rational-are immense. Or they would be, if Gloaming's project were not undermined by the contradictory rela- tions of persons and bodies implicit in the seance. In the seance's economy of psychic and physical division, the Control, Peter Sachsa, is the spiritual agent coordinating what amounts to a use of</page><page sequence="26">734 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE the Medium's body by the mind of the Spirit, Roland Feldspath. The medium, Carroll Eventyr, is literally not himself. Agency, or control, is distributed among several "persons," along mathemati- cal lines (from "beyond the Zero"). This poses a serious challenge to the notion of individual persons altogether, a challenge crippling to Gloaming's project. In short, if the Medium is the message in any way, then his assumption that he's graphing single individuals is wrong. As a number of readers have pointed out, the rationale for Gloaming's project-and for the many projects of his group-is what Weber called the "routinization of charisma."14 It was widely believed in those days that behind the War-all the death, savagery, and destruction-lay the Ffihrer-principle. But if personalities could be replaced by abstractions of power, if techniques developed by the corporations could be brought to bear, might not nations live rationally? One of the dearest Postwar hopes: that there should be no room for a terrible disease like charisma . . . (81) In essence a rationalization of rationalization, this plan proposes to complete the already substantial shift, described by Foucault, from monarchical to discursive forms of power. Interestingly enough, such rationalizations are precisely the subject of Roland Feldspath's otherworldly advice at the seance Gloaming is studying: 'All these things arise from one difficulty: control. For the first time it was inside, do you see. The control is put inside. No more need to suffer passively under 'outside forces.' ... A market needed no longer be run by the Invisible Hand, but now could create itself-its own logic, momentum, style, from inside.... But you had taken on a greater, and more harmful, illusion. The illusion of control. That A could do B. But that was false. Completely. No one can do. Things only happen." (30; ellipses added) This account of control-which could be applied to a person as well as an economy-illustrates the difficulty of modeling control as 14. See Weber 363-73. For a detailed account of Pynchon's use of Weber, see espe- cially Schaub 57-63, and Moore 116-48.</page><page sequence="27">ME L L EY ? 7 35 wholly internal or wholly external to a system.15 In fact, this view reverses the usual dynamics of agency panic. Rather than imagin- ing agency to reside in an external personification, like the "Invisi- ble Hand" of the market, Feldspath imagines a thoroughly ratio- nalized, immanent sort of control. But like earlier moments of panic, this attempt to stabilize absolutely the "location" of control leads to problems. "Putting control inside" the system only creates the "illusion of control"-and appears, at the same time, to deny the possibility of motivated action or agency altogether: "No one can do. Things only happen." What Feldspath's account cannot con- ceive is the overlap between an economy and the individuals which comprise it-a relation made visible everywhere in Gravity's Rain- bow. In other words, "putting" control inside a market would mean putting control inside the persons whose bodies, bodily needs, and individual desires compose and control that market at its most basic level.16 Gravity's Rainbow is full of characters, like Feldspath, whose all- or-nothing accounts of agency are inadequate to grasp how discur- sive or social structures might impinge upon individuals without depriving them of all capacity for autonomous action. But the novel itself continually dramatizes these relations in a more sophisticated fashion, using uncertainty about agency to illustrate both the ways in which human subjectivity is socially constructed and the ways individual bodies and actions in turn constitute and regulate "the social." Nothing makes these complex relays more clear than the 15. David Seed says there is general agreement among Pynchon's critics that Norman 0. Brown's Life against Death "exerted a strong influence over Gravity's Rainbow partic- ularly in presenting history and economics as neurosis" and in understanding culture as dominated by the death instinct (168). This source also indicates that Pynchon imagines persons and economies to be related. Not only are they self-controlling in roughly the same way; they also appear, in places, to be continuous with one another. In other words, it is not always clear, in Gravity's Rainbow, whether the qualities of personhood would be better represented by an economy or by an individual human being. 16. James Beniger describes the ways "teleonomic explanations obviate the need to attribute consciousness, planning, purpose, or any other anthropomorphic qualities to aggregate levels, the special problem of reification. Adam Smith's 'invisible hand' of market forces, for example, can be seen to result from the interconnected programming of individuals and their organizations, including individual tactics, strategies, and util- ities, on the one hand, and organizational procedures, written law, and cultural norms on the other" (41).</page><page sequence="28">736 * CON T E MPORA RY LITERATURE novel's topsy-turvy ontology of persons, in which individual bodies appear to register the presence of large controlling structures even as those structures themselves appear to behave like persons. Slothrop is the ultimate instance of this logic of personation. He enters the novel as a kind of singularity, a locus which appears to represent something well beyond itself, but he is eventually dissem- inated across a continent. Before long, "it's doubtful if he can ever be 'found' again, in the conventional sense of 'positively identified and detained'" (712). As in Pokler's case, the abstracting mathemat- ics behind this process takes material form. Slothrop begins to fall apart near a "colossal curved embankment" (509), a material Gaus- sian distribution curve in which he is a point so close to the margins that when the curve finally "herniates toward the excellent" he "will have already been weeded out" (508). Before long, he is "bro- ken down" and "scattered" (738) across the Zone, across the novel. What is significant about this process is not merely that Slothrop disintegrates, but that his material body is transformed into a geo- graphical distribution similar to the map he once made of his inner- most experiences. In this movement from singular locus to statisti- cal distribution, from eroticized absence to scattered presence, from sublime body to disseminated person, the novel's main character finally displays, in a less panicky fashion, the way he impersonates, or is impersonated by, social structures. But this is only to make more visible the machinery of mathematical personation operating throughout Gravity's Rainbow. To be a person in this novel means to recognize, continually and with great anxiety, that your "person- ality" might not be yours, that it constitutes and is constituted by global control structures, and that as it moves in and out of your body, it marks certain lines of discursive production and regulation and moves information through immense but invisible networks.
