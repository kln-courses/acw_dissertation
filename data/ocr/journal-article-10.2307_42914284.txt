<plain_text><page sequence="1">DR. ROBERT A. MILLIKAN ADDRESSES THE PHI BETA KAPPA ALUMNI IN NEW YORK The first of the season's meetings of the Phi Beta Kappa Alumni in New York was held on December 16 at the Savoy-Plaza Hotel. After reports by the Secretary and Treasurer, John Kirkland Clark, Yale '99, and the Chairman of the Auditing Committee, Prof. Nelson G. McCrea, Columbia '85, the President, Charles Evans Hughes, Jr., Brown '09, intro- duced the speaker, Dr. Robert A. Millikan, Oberlin '91, President of the California Institute of Technology. Following the address refreshments were served. About three hundred members were present. This meeting begins the fifty- fourth season during which has per- sisted the practice of holding three meetings each year with an address by an invited speaker followed by a discussion and a collation. The association published in March, 1930, a booklet giving the constitution, historical note, list of addresses and officers since 1877, and lists of mem- bers arranged alphabetically and by chapters. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS By Charles Evans Hughes, Jr., LL.B., Brown '09 President of the Phi Beta Kappa Alumni in New York The size of this gathering attests in striking fashion the extent of popular appreciation of the importance of any utterance on the part of our speaker of the evening. For this is, to him, a popular audience. You well know, Doctor Millikan, that your brothers in Phi Beta Kappa are not a body of scientists. We are philistines, engaged for the most part in callings whose content thus far defies demonstrable separation of the true from the false. But we are educated philistines. We know that the reason why our generation is different from any other generation in all history is the advance of research in pure science. Science, as if in answer to Tennyson's aspersions on its progress, has moved "headlong, headlong, rushing on from point to point." While most of us are in- capable of understanding the processes of that research, or even its discoveries themselves, we can at least appreciate its significance. As Doctor Millikan has himself said, in the conduct of his daily life and his manner of thought, he is more remote from his own grandfather than his grandfather was from the earliest man mentioned in recorded history. If humanity's new-found knowledge of the world in which we live and the universe of which our world is a part is to be of real benefit to humanity, there is nothing more vital than for educated men to try to understand the bearing of pure science upon daily human life and human thought. 644</page><page sequence="2">1931 Dr. Millikan Addresses Phi Beta Kappa Alumni 645 It is for this purpose that we sit at Doctor Millikan's feet. Of his eminence in his own field there is no need to speak. He is acknowledged to be one of the leading scientists of the world. A mere recital of his honors from universities and scientific societies in this country and in Europe would exceed any time properly to be allotted to a presiding officer. The Nobel Prize in physics in 1923 for isolating and measuring the electron, and the gold medal of the Society of Arts and Sciences in 1929 for the discovery of the cosmic ray, are only more noteworthy exam- ples. But with his recognized primacy in science he combines a Weltan- schauung which makes his choice of subject for tonight's address - "Sci- ence and Humanism" - peculiarly appropriate. He is the supreme ex- positor of science to the layman. A darky clergyman, in introducing the speaker of the evening, once referred to his eloquence and said, "He will describe the undescribable, he will depict the undepictable, he will unscrew the unscrutible." For years Doctor Millikan has been unscrewing the unscrutible for the benefit of bewildered bachelors of arts. Not only has he the faculty of presenting the most abstruse conception in terms so limpid that even the most unin- formed can comprehend (or is persuaded that he can, which is to the same purpose), but he approaches scientific discussion from the philo- sophic viewpoint in the truest sense. For he insists that research in pure science be interpreted in its relation to all human civilization - to the social sciences, to economics, to politics in the large sense, to morals, to religion. Treating philosophy as the science of sciences, he is a philosopher, and in the grand manner. It is well for America that at this unique period in the development of the race science should have a spokesman of such vision. To the leadership of such men as he we must turn for the hope that human intel- ligence may be directed to the use of new knowledge and new instruments for the benefit, rather than the hurt, of humanity. And so, without more, I introduce to you Dr. Robert A. Millikan, Director of the Norman Bridge Laboratory of Physics and Chairman of the Executive Council of the California Institute of Technology. SCIENCE AND HUMANISM By Robert Andrews Millikan, Oberlin '91, Ph.D., Sc.D., LL.D. i I am somewhat aghast at the nature of this introduction, and also at the necessity of talking upon a subject which is outside the field of my knowledge. I have a great deal of sympathy with a remark that one of</page><page sequence="3">646 The Phi Beta Kappa Key January my sons made to me when I had the temerity to accept President Angell's invitation to deliver the Terry Lectures at New Haven. My boy was the president of a so-called Liberal Club at Harvard at that time, and he wrote me that he had doubts about the legitimacy of a man's using a scientific reputation to gain an audience in a field in which he had no competence. I completely agree with my boy. However, I replied: "Guilty, three times guilty of having come up out of the hole in which I have been burrowing for forty years, for the sake of trying to see what the world looks like, instead of telephoning up to the Harvard Liberal Club to telephone down to me what it looks like." I do not know of any way in which, in this highly specialized civili- zation in which we are living today - and it is going to become more spe- cialized still - we can get any common viewpoints except by swapping ideas as to how the world looks to us, in spite of the fact that we are likely to make blunders and seem to arrogate to ourselves a knowledge which we do not have. I hope none of you will think that I feel able to treat with competence a general subject of this kind, but at any rate I am going to attempt to give an individual viewpoint which you can compare with your own and make suitable discounts for. In glancing over the list of subjects that have been treated in Phi Beta Kappa addresses in New York during the past fifty years, I find that a relatively small proportion of them are by scientists, and also that when a scientist has spoken, he has in general tried to show the breadth of his interest by choosing a non-scientific subject. This is altogether natural since the traditions of the Phi Beta Kappa have been primarily those of classical scholarship. Nor could this very well have been otherwise, since at the time the society was founded and during the period in which its traditions were being formed, it is hardly too much to say that there was no other than classical scholarship in the United States. ii Among the stupendous changes that have taken place, not only in our material lives, but in our intellectual outlooks also, in our university activi- ties and curricula during the past amazing century, perhaps the most con- spicuous is that which has to do with the position of science in the field of scholarship. And it is about this that I wish to say a word tonight, not at all in the way of raising the ghost of the old conflict between science and the classics, but rather for the sake of attempting to analyze what sort of influences, from my point of view, seem actually to have brought about</page><page sequence="4">1931 Dr. Millikan Addresses Phi Beta Kappa Alumni 64 7 the enormous changes that have taken place during the past hundred years and that are taking place right now under our very eyes. How thoroughly I ought to recognize and actually do recognize the absolute necessity of the humanistic studies is revealed by the following facts better than by any protestations that I might make either of affection or of dislike. First, not only do I myself hold the Bachelor of Arts degree, and not only have my sons absorbed between them nine years of Latin, but I never entered upon nor even tasted scientific studies in any thorough-going way until after I had graduated from college. My injection into the life of a scientist was a pure accident. If I had any aptitude or even leanings in that direction I did not know it until I was in my twenty-second year, and I was in my twenty-sixth year before I decided to make an effort to get the training which would permit me to hope to become some day a physicist. It was in the fall of that year, of 1893, that I began my graduate study of physics. I was exposed altogether to five years of Latin and three years of Greek, and the accident by which I was catapulted into physics came about thus : I had liked my work in Greek with Prof. John Fisher Peck at Oberlin, and he had liked either me or my work in his classes sufficiently to come to me at the end of my sophomore year and ask me to teach, the following fall, a class in elementary physics in the preparatory department, for which he had just been given the responsibility of selecting teachers. I told him I knew nothing about physics, had never had any. He, an en- thusiastic classicist, replied that that did not make any difference; if I had enough head to pass his courses in Greek, that was all that was neces- sary. "All right," said I, "if you can stand it, I can, for I need the money." So I went immediately to my father's home, which was then in Wichita, Kansas, and spent most of the summer - that was in June, 1889 - working through every problem in Avery's "Physics," a pretty compendious, at that time a very compendious book, full of rather stiff problems, and as I pro- ceeded further and further with the problems, I began to thank my stars that a really vital and intrinsically interesting subject had been assigned to me to teach. Also, my most vivid memory of my next year's teaching, which was done as a side issue to full junior college work, is my continual chortling, as I watched my fellow teachers, over the fact that my job was so much easier than theirs, since my subject carried its own interest, as some of theirs seemed to me not to do. And even after three years of that sort of teaching, I found myself wondering whether I ought to go into the life of teaching or not, since I had serious doubts as to whether I had the ca-</page><page sequence="5">648 The Phi Beta Kappa Key January pacity to teach any subject, which, unlike physics, did not teach itself, for I had tried no other. hi I am going to digress at this point just a moment from my theme, to make a reflection or two on the foregoing preparation for a teaching and scientific career. An orthodox professor of pedagogy would say, "Scan- dalous; it could not be worse," and I could give him more data thus far suppressed to support his view. I had had just a touch of physics in my high school course in Iowa, but just the worst touch that could be imag- ined. It was given by a man who spent his summer vacations locating water by a witch hazel divining rod. That is a fact. A man who, when we came to the subject of sound and read in our text that sound is a wave motion communicated from particle to particle of the sound-transmitting medium, said to his class : "Let me show you how foolish an explanation it is that is given in your text. How far have you ever heard a katydid? You say a mile. Compute the weight of that sphere of air a mile in radius. It weighs ten thousand tons. Now your books say that that katydid can kick those ten thousand tons of air so as to make it all move, when you know that you yourselves could not budge ten thousand tons a hair's breadth. Nonsense, your book doesn't know what it is talking about." When I once mentioned this bit of history to my friend, Prof. John Manley of the University of Chicago, his comment was, "You know, Millikan, the encouraging thing about education is that you cannot spoil a good man, no matter how bad the system is." But that is not quite the sort of pedagogical comment I wish to make. I have narrated these facts, first for the sake of showing that my own history has not been such as to give me any excuse for being a narrow- gauge scientist, one whose training and interests have been such as to tend to develop a man of one idea ; and, second, to enable me to assert that in spite of that history, I actually had a first-rate training for teaching physics, or, for that matter, for teaching any analytical subject; for in high school, the college preparatory school, and in college, I had had excellent teachers of algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and analytics, who kept me hard at work solving problems from the time I was thirteen up to the age of twenty-one, and who gave me thereby vastly more sound training for teaching physics than I could have acquired by any number of courses in pedagogy. For that kind of problem-solving was the supreme thing I needed to understand, or to make others understand, the spirit, the method, and the subject-matter of physics, and it did not make any difference whether I got it in physics itself or in mathematics, or in any other essen-</page><page sequence="6">1931 Dr. Millikan Addresses Phi Beta Kappa Alumni 649 tially analytical subject. Drill in the old-fashioned problem method, in its pristine, undiluted, unemasculated form - that was what I needed and got as a preparation for a career in physics, whether in teaching it or in apply- ing it. Now, my comment is that I myself could not today break into, as I did forty years ago, the teaching of secondary school physics, because our states, many of them, have passed laws under the stimulus of teachers' college labor unions, which actually are working, so it seems to me - and I know I am right in at least a few individual instances - to prevent the ablest and best trained of our younger minds from getting into secondary school teaching at all. A hundred years of pedagogical lectures do not, in my judgment, even begin to yield the training for teaching physics that I got from the problem method as it was used in my early training in mathematics forty-five and fifty years ago. One can, of course, use that method in physics as well - perhaps even better than in mathematics, and I think it is used everywhere where physics is well taught. But enough of that digression. IV The second basis that I have for laying claim to a breadth of interest in humanistic as well as in scientific studies is found in the fact that in the institution with which I am associated, the so-called humanities are pur- sued with an intensity and a devotion such as characterizes, so far as I can discover, no other institution that calls itself a school of technology, or that emphasises in any way a professional objective. When the trustees of the California Institute of Technology first set up their objectives, they formulated them somewhat as follows : To train a small, carefully selected group of young men in the fundamentals of effec- tive living and achieving in this essentially scientific twentieth-century world. And they defined these fundamentals as, first, mathematics, physics, and chemistry, the fundamental sciences; and, second, history, literature, ethics, and economics, the studies that teach one best how man has in the past reacted to his environment, and how he is likely in the future to react. Every man who goes to the California Institute takes there four years of mathematics, physics, and chemistry and not less than four years in those subjects are prerequisite for entering, and also four straight years of literature and history in the broad sense of these terms. In other words, in a school that is thought of primarily as a scientific school, the human- istic studies, those that deal with man and his relations and motivations, are given larger emphasis than in any collegiate institution that I know of, and that curriculum, mind you, has been organized primarily by scientists,</page><page sequence="7">650 The Phi Beta Kappa Key January too; namely, by Arthur A. Noyes, a chemist, by George E. Hale, an as- tronomer, by Thomas Hunt Morgan, a biologist, by E. C. Watson, a physicist, and by William B. Munro, an historian. Under the stimulus of Doctor Munro, one of the finest buildings on the campus, called the Dab- ney Hall of the Humanities, has been built and well provided with all the accessories of the humanistic studies, including a fine-arts treasure room and an olive grove reminiscent of that at Plato's Academy, but, nota bene, sealed tight against the intrusion of a single engineering slipstick, physical formula, or chemical odor. Behind all this effort you will at once see the deep conviction that though this is indeed an age that has its mainsprings in the sciences, as your President says, and one which needs more than anything else the scientific method, and which, furthermore, demands a high degree of specialization, yet for real effectiveness in solving man's coming problems, a broad basis of human understanding must be provided for the man who, even though he be scientist or engineer, is to be the leader and the inspirer of the com- ing generation. v If now I may be considered, through the foregoing, to have estab- lished my credentials as one who has tried not to wear scientific blinders, one who at least does not glory in being a lop-sided specialist, let me pro- ceed to present what seems to me to have been the most essential contri- bution of science to the intellectual life of the past century. This lies, in one phrase, in the discovery of the scientific method. I think there can be no shadow of doubt that the great characteristic feature of our times, the one thing that does distinguish our civilization from all that have preceded, is this discovery of the scientific method and the results that have followed upon its application. That discovery was indeed not made in our generation. It was made some three hundred years ago, but its cumulative effects have come only within the last cen- tury. But now just what is the scientific method that I talk about, and what was the change in mode of approach that Galileo so conspicuously em- ployed, and which resulted in what Professor Whitehead calls "the most intimate change in outlook which the human race had yet encountered" ? The method consisted in not starting at all with a priori postulates about the nature of reality, or with any complete philosophic systems, such as all the philosophers of the ancient world, idealists and atomists alike, had started with, and indeed had quarreled interminably over ; in discard- ing likewise all intuitive axioms on the one hand and authority on the other</page><page sequence="8">1931 Dr. Millikan Addresses Phi Beta Kappa Alumni 651 such as had been the foundation of the medieval scholasticism of Thomas Aquinas and of his successors ; and appealing by the experimental method, as Whetham says in his new "History of Science," "to the tribunal of brute facts, facts which bore no relation to any phi- losophic synthesis then possible. Natural science may use deductive rea- soning at an intermediate stage of its inquiries, and inductive theories are an essential part of its procedure, but primarily it is empirical, and its ulti- mate appeal is to observation and experiment. "It is not too much to say that Galileo started modern physical science on the course which has extended unbroken to our own day. In a very real sense, he is the first of the moderns. As we read his writings, we in- stinctively feel at home. We know that we have reached the method of experimental science which still is in use today. The old assumption of a complete and rationalized scheme of knowledge has been given up. Facts are no longer deduced from, and obliged to conform with, an authoritative and rational synthesis as in scholasticism; no longer are they even given meaning thereby as they were in the mind of Kepler. Each fact acquired by observation and experiment is accepted as it stands, with its immediate and inevitable consequences, irrespective of the human desire to make the whole of nature at once amenable to reason. "Concordances between the isolated facts appear but slowly, and the little spheres of knowledge surrounding each fact come into touch here and there, and perhaps coalesce into larger spheres, but the welding of all knowledge, scientific or philosophical, into an all-embracing unity, if not seen to be forever impossible, is relegated to the distant future. Medieval scholasticism was rational; modern science is in essence empirical. The former worshiped the human reason acting within the bounds of authority ; the latter accepts brute facts, whether reasonable or not." Galileo, unlike some who followed him, and founded systems upon his work, like the French Encyclopedists of the eighteenth century, "was content to wait in acknowledged ignorance upon questions that can only be answered by rash speculation or deduced from philosophic systems." He confessed that he knew nothing about the nature of force (though he had studied it all his life), the cause of gravity, or the origin of the uni- verse. Rather than express extravagances, he declared it better to pro- nounce that wise, ingenious, and modest sentence, "I know not." vi Now, that is the scientific method. What has resulted from its appli- cation ? First, practically the whole of modern material civilization in so far as it differs from ancient civilization. It is easy to trace the pedigree of practically every modern industrial or scientific device back to the new knowledge which has come from the application of Galileo's method, and, indeed, from his own experimental researches.</page><page sequence="9">652 The Phi Beta Kappa Key January Let me take two illustrations. For thousands, perhaps for tens of thousands, of years - we do not know how long before his time - men had pushed carts and pulled wagons, but not one of them had any correct idea about the actual relations between the force exerted and the motions pro- duced. That was just what Galileo found by studying the way his marbles acquired velocity as they rolled down his inclined plane. With- out the formula which we in elementary physics write in the form f=ma, force is equal to mass times acceleration - without that formula, which came into the knowledge of mankind through his work, not one single steam engine, automobile, airplane, or any other power machine could be designed today. Further, it was precisely this formula, as everybody knows, which seventy-five years later, in the hands of Newton, made the discovery of the law of gravitation possible, because it was simply by equating what he got from that formula, as applied to centrifugal motion, to the results of the inverse square law that he found the explanation of the moon's motion. And with that law has come the whole development of celestial me- chanics, for obviously you cannot even make a start in celestial mechanics without that law, and it is the successes of celestial mechanics which have at last weaned the whole world away from treating with anything but ridi- cule, to use Kipling's phrase, "the village that voted the earth was flat, flat as my hat, flatter than that," and opened the eyes of the world to the glories and mysteries of modern astronomy. Take one other illustration. Through hundreds of thousands of years, alike in the epochs of savagery and barbarism, and in those of amazing Greek and Latin civilizations, man had warmed himself at his camp fire and at his grate without ever stopping to wonder what heat was ; or, if he wondered, without having any idea of how to set to work to find out. More than that, it was impossible for him to find out before the idea or concept of the energy of molecular motion had been formulated, and this idea came from Galilean and Newtonian mechanics. I do not know how many of you Phi Beta Kappa men know that the word "energy" as a precise physical concept was not in the English dic- tionary until about 1850. When Helmholtz wrote his remarkable essay in 1847 - and this was one of the essays that set the principle of conserva- tion of energy going - in the title of this essay he confused two ideas, those of force and energy, which we would not allow a sophomore in a high school to confuse today. I mention it to show that the idea of energy had not been formulated and crystalized by the middle of the nineteenth cen- tury.</page><page sequence="10">1931 Dr. Millikan Addresses Phi Beta Kappa Alumni 653 Now, it was absolutely impossible to begin to get the idea of the rela- tions between heat and work before the concept of kinetic energy of molec- ular motion as an exact physical concept had been created, and that was not until about that time. It was an analytical thing which came directly from Galilean and Newtonian mechanics. It came directly from the work of Galileo and Newton, who had laid the foundations for the development of the modern steam engine ; and the steam engine, in its turn, begot the internal combustion engine. In exactly the same way through the work of Franklin, Volta, Faraday, and Maxwell, all utilizing the method and the results of their scientific ancestors, has the age of electricity within my own lifetime been ushered in. Also the same method applied to the study of the earth's crust, with its fossil records of age-long development from lower to higher biological forms, and the further study of the anatomical relations between these forms have brought to light brute facts which must tell their own tale, no matter what preconceived philosophies or world systems they may en- counter. VII This whole group of observed facts about the universe around us is what I think is responsible for the enormous change in human outlook that has been characteristic of our century. In that sentence I have touched the second advance, much more im- portant than the material one which I have been talking about, which has come into human thought and life as the result of the application of the scientific method. Let me follow the idea a little further. As I read history, through all primitive thinking, and some of it not so primitive, nature is regarded as essentially capricious. Things happen because the god of the mountain or the god of the forest or the god of the river or the god of the sea wills to have them happen, and that god is usually endowed, too, with all human frailties. That god's will can be supplicated, pleased, enraged, appeased, cajoled, but that it operates in any systematic way or in accordance with fixed principles which man by study can come to understand, that was an idea which, while it was adumbrated indeed in the Greek world, notably in the work of Aristarchus of Samos, Archimedes of Syracuse, and Hipparchus of Alexandria, was, after all, practically without influence in human life before the real advent of the scientific method in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Galileo, in establishing the laws of force and motion, assumed the principle of uniformity and laid down regularities or laws which made</page><page sequence="11">654 The Phi Beta Kappa Key January prediction of astronomical events and of some terrestrial events a possi- bility. The continued and ever-increasing success of these predictions soon began inevitably to change man's thinking about the fundamental nature of the universe. With increasing knowledge man's ideas of God, the integrating factor in the universe, of course began to change. The days of childlike anthro- pomorphic Santa Clauslike conceptions began to draw to a close, and man- kind began to move forward to a more satisfying conception. The God of caprice and whim began to be replaced in human thinking by a God who rules through law. A universe which was not worth knowing because it could not be counted upon - or in Plato's philosophy, because it did not exist, because with him ideas were the only reality - began to be replaced by a nature which is dependable and to some extent, at least, understand- able, even controllable by man. Man began to be no longer merely a play- thing in the hands of a blind fate or of a capricious Deity. Rather he be- gan to become himself a vital agent in the march of things. And with that changed conception, ideas of duty and therefore of religion began to change. Under the old conception man's chief duty had been to propitiate his anthropomorphic Deity; under the new conception duty came to be to try to understand God's laws, and to bring one's life and the lives of all mankind into harmony with them. Most important of all, in the old days men had made a wholly artificial and irrational distinc- tion between the natural and the supernatural. Events which were suffi- ciently common and familiar were thought of as natural, and events which were uncommon and not understood were called supernatural. The idea of the uniformity or repeatability of events abolished completely all such childlike distinctions. All events without exception are worthy of study and of attempts at understanding, because nature is assumed to be depend- able, not at all capricious. Familiarity or unfamiliarity has nothing to do with it. Call all events natural, if you will, or supernatural, if you prefer, but forget - so says Galileo's method - either one term or the other. No wonder Whitehead called it "the most intimate change in outlook the human race had yet encountered." That is what has brought about this stupendous change in outlook of the past century, at least as I see it. Now this group of ideas, of course, did not spring into existence spontaneously about 1600. It did, however, begin to influence human life and conduct about then, and it has influenced them most profoundly since the very recent development that is characteristic of our century of the means of dissemination of ideas. These ideas had a history, however, which goes back of 1600, for practically all ideas and all movements have a pedigree. Those ideas were themselves begotten by what is properly</page><page sequence="12">1931 Dr. Millikan Addresses Phi Beta Kappa Alumni 655 called the humanistic movement, which historically just preceded them - so that you can put the whole credit for it upon humanism, if you will - for this constituted the essential spirit of the Renaissance, a spirit, under the stimulus of which men, beginning about 1350, especially in the city-states of northern Italy, sought to recover, after the period of medievalism, the freedom of classical thought and the other cultural humanizing influences of Greek and Latin civilizations. It was especially after the capture of Constantinople in 1453 that Greek teachers, Greek manuscripts, and Greek ideas began to flood North- ern Europe, and thus the language and the spirit of ancient philosophy and science became familiar to western scholars. It was because of this so- called humanistic movement that Copernicus, Leonardo da Vinci, and Galileo became thoroughly familiar with, indeed, very careful students of, the work of Archimedes and of his Alexandrian contemporaries and successors. So that modern science itself unquestionably owes its very birth to humanism. One inevitable result of this survey that I have attempted to give is to raise the question as to whether science and humanism should not be, and cannot be linked together more intimately in our thinking and acting during the next generation than has been the case during the past half century. The narrowing influences of one-sided education and overspe- cialization are just exactly as obvious today in the humanistic field as they are obvious - and we admit it - in the scientific field. I have indeed known scientists whom I regarded as wholly one-sided, uncultured, and essen- tially uneducated men. But they have usually had enough intelligence to be more or less conscious of it; I have also known so-called humanists who were simply intellectual illiterates, and who sometimes have been most blissfully unconscious of it. Both these groups need badly to be mixed. Possibly the Phi Beta Kappa Society can act as the melting pot, for scholarship is essentially one thing, whether it is in science or whether it is in the humanities. Per- sonally, I regret that it has ever been found or thought necessary to or- ganize two undergraduate scholarship societies, the Phi Beta Kappa and the essentially scientific honor society, the Tau Beta Pi, and I suggest to the officers of these societies the desirability of attempting to bring about a marriage between them in which the older member should have the rights of the male ; that is, the right of giving his name to the family.</page></plain_text>
