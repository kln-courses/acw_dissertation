<plain_text><page sequence="1">REPORTS LONG-TERM TRENDS IN PREHISTORIC FISHING AND HUNTING ON TOBAGO, WEST INDIES David W. Steadman and Sharyn Jones We compare the bone assemblages ofMilford 1 (TOB-3) and Golden Grove (TOB-13) in Tobago, West Indies. Milford 1 is a small preceramic occupation (ca. 3000-2800 cal B.P), whereas Golden Grove is a large ceramic-period village (ca. 1700-900 cal B.P). Species richness at TOB-13 is greater than at TOB-3, both in marine (67 vs. 39 fishes) and terrestrial (32 vs. 9) taxa. Major shifts in marine exploitation from the preceramic to ceramic periods can be seen in relative abun dance of tuna, toadfishes, and in fishes inhabiting mangrove and brackish water environments, and decreases in relative abundance of parrotfish, carnivorous reef fishes, and sea turtles. The abundance of tuna bones at TOB-13 is uniquely high among West Indian archaeological sites. For terrestrial taxa, the difference in species richness exceeds the expected, includ ing decreased specialization on big game (peccaries) at TOB-13, with a greater tendency to hunt reptiles, birds, and mam mals of all sizes at TOB-3. Factors underlying the shifts in fishing and hunting may include different collection methods and food preferences of non-Arawakan (preceramic) vs. Arawakan (ceramic) peoples, as well as human-induced declines in populations of peccaries, sea turtles, and selected fish species. Another possible factor is site setting, with the inhabitants of TOB-13 having enhanced access to mangrove habitats. Comparamos los conjuntos ?seos de Milford 1 (TOB-3) y Golden Grove (TOB-13) en Tobago, Antillas Occidentales. TOB-3 es una peque?a ocupaci?n precer?mica (ca. 3000-2800 calAP) mientras que TOB-13 es una gran villa del per?odo cer?mico (ca. 1700-900 calAP). La riqueza de especies en TOB-13 es mayor que en TOB-3, ya sean marinas (67 vs. 39peces) o te rrestres (32 vs. 9). Los cambios en la explotaci?n de recursos marinos del precer?mico al cer?mico se ven en la mayor abun dancia relativa de at?n, pez sapo, y de otros peces que habitan los mangles y ambientes de aguas salobres, y en la menor abundancia relativa de pez loro, peces carn?voros de arrecifes, y tortugas marinas. La abundancia de at?n en TOB-13, con seis especies de mar adentro, es ?nica en sitios arqueol?gicos de las Antillas Occidentales. Para los taxa terrestres, sorprende la diferencia en la riqueza de especies; los cambios incluyen una disminuci?n en los animales de caza mayor (pecar?es) en TOB-13, con un aumento en la caza de reptiles, aves, y mam?feros de diferentes tama?os en TOB-3. Factores que inciden en los cambios pudieron ser la implementaci?n de diferentes m?todos de recolecci?n-caza y en las preferencias alimenticias entre los grupos no-Arawak (precer?micos) versus los Arawak (cer?micos), as? como por disminuciones inducidas por humanos en las poblaciones de pecar?es, tortugas marinas, y algunas especies de peces. Adem?s los habitantes de TOB-13 pudieron haber tenido mejor acceso a los habitats de los manglares. A proliferation of archaeological research has occurred in the Caribbean over the last 20 years. While much of this work has focused on classifying prehistoric ceramics through space and time, more recent research has con tributed to understanding how people used biolog ical and other resources (Deagan 2004; deFrance et al. 1996; Newsom and Wing 2004; Watters 1998). Nevertheless, in the southern Caribbean, including Trinidad and Tobago, where peoples first moved into the West Indian region from South America, we still have little detailed information about how prehistoric humans interacted with their environments. Banwari Trace and St. John, the old est archaeological sites in the region (ca. 8000 to 6000 cal B.P.), have yielded a record indicating a shift in subsistence during preceramic times on Trinidad. This featured an increased frequency through time offish bones (especially of fishes that inhabit marine banks and reefs) and a decreased frequency of bones from large- and medium-sized mammals (Boomert 2000:58; Wing and Reitz David W.

Tobago. The archaeological sites we report are in the coral lowlands of western Tobago. 1982). This paper will focus on the nearby island of Tobago, where no sites have been discovered that are older than ca. 3000 cal B.P. In comparing fau nal data from two sites on Tobago, one preceramic in age and other from the ceramic period, we will examine how patterns of fishing and hunting changed through time, and then hypothesize about the factors that may have fueled these shifts. Tobago (Figure 1) is smaller (298 km2) and more isolated from South America than Trinidad (4578 km2). Lying on the continental shelf, Tobago's ter restrial flora and fauna are more closely related to those of South America (Beard 1944; Comeau 1991; Eisenberg 1989; ffrench 1991; Graves and Gotelli 1983; Hardy 1982; Murphy 1997) than to the truly oceanic biotas of the Lesser Antillean islands from Grenada northward (Pregill et al. 1994; Schwartz and Henderson 1991; Steadman et al. 1984; Wunderle 1985). Tobago's generally rugged topography, hot and humid climate, and historic land-use patterns were described by Niddrie (1980). Tobago has diverse Mesozoic igneous, volcanic, and metamorphic bedrock, with Neogene sedi mentary rocks exposed on its western end (Snoke et al. 2001a, 2001b). It is on Tobago's relatively flat western end that most precolumbian archaeological research has taken place. Much of this has been dedicated to developing a chronological sequence of ceramic styles and settlement patterns (Boomert 1996, 2000; Clement 2000; Harris 1991). The only detailed analysis of Tobago's prehistoric vertebrates was by Steadman and Stokes (2002), who studied the non-fish remains from the preceramic Milford 1 site and the ceramic Golden Grove site. Infor mation on prehistoric fishing on Tobago has been limited to unqualified, family-level observations of bones from several sites (Boomert 1996). We now expand the zooarchaeological analysis of the Milford 1 and Golden Grove sites by including fishes (all of which are marine or estuarine) and greater chrono-stratigraphic coverage of the ter restrial vertebrates from the Golden Grove site. Our new data, from similar midden contexts at both sites, provide an opportunity to compare the species procured by hunters and fishers from different time periods on a single island. Methods Our field research (9-11 July 1999,15-22 Novem ber 1999, 12 January-3 February 2000, 21-26</page><page sequence="3">318 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 17, No. 3, 2006] Figure 2. The coral lowlands of western Tobago, showing the location of the prehistoric sites mentioned in this paper. Gray shading is Mangrove Woodlands. The numbering system for sites (e.g., TOB-3) follows Boomert (1996). March 2002, 23 February-8 March 2004) com prised surface-surveys and excavations of midden deposits in prehistoric sites on the uplifted Qua ternary limestone ("coral lowlands") of western Tobago (Figure 2). For both Milford 1 (TOB-3) and Golden Grove (TOB-13), the site setting, methods of excavation and analysis, stratigraphy, preliminary chronology, and general nature of the ceramic and lithic artifact assemblages were described in Steadman and Stokes (2002). Exca vations at both sites took place in stratified mid den contexts. The ceramics from earlier excavations at TOB-13 were described in Boomert (1996). All excavation was done by trowel except for the most compacted parts of site TOB-3, where the shell-packed sediment (dominated by Strom bus spp. conch) had to be loosened for trowel exca vation by gently prying it with a pick. Excavations followed the natural stratigraphy, with arbitrary levels designated within most strata. Depths were taken relative to an established datum (cm below datum "cmbd"), later converted to cmbs (cm below the surface). All excavated sediment was water screened through sieves of 1/8-inch mesh, and sub sampled (25 percent by volume) with sieves of 1/16-inch mesh. The bones are curated at the Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida, Gainesville (FLMNH). Each identification is based on direct comparison with modern skeletal speci mens offish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mam mals in the FLMNH collections. Some of the bone at both sites was encased in carbonate-cemented sediment, making an accurate weight (mass) of the bone itself difficult to obtain. Therefore, our data and interpretations are based on values for NISP (number of identified specimens). Identification and analysis of fish bones (by S J) follow methods used for other tropical islands in the Caribbean and Pacific, described in detail by O'Day (2001,2002). Fish bones that could not be identified to family, genus, or species were assigned to "Osteichthyes" and were not considered in habitat-based analyses of the prehistoric fish fauna. Assignment to "Per ciformes" was made when an element could not be identified to family, but was likely from a species of Serranidae, Carangidae, Lutjanidae, or Haemul idae. Because of the abundance offish remains, sub</page><page sequence="4">REPORTS 319 samples were drawn for detailed analysis from four layers at TOB-13 as follows: Layer II (levels 2,4), Layer in (levels 7, 10), Layer IV (levels 12, 14), Layer IV/V (Level 16), andLayer V (levels 17-21). The larger number of levels from Layer V is because bone was scarcer here than in overlying strata. At TOB-3, fish bones were analyzed from levels 3,4,5, and 6 of Layer II. Each subsample is representative of that particular layer and consists of all fish bones from the Level. Non-fish bone was identified from all levels at both sites. Habitat classifications for fishes are based on information from Fischer ( 1978), Froese and Pauly (2004), and Lieske and Myers (2002). The terms "reef," "pelagic," "inshore," and "mangrove" or "brackish" are used here to refer to specific envi ronments inhabited by the identified fishes. Reef species are those that live in and around coral reefs. Pelagic species inhabit the open ocean; they swim on the surface of the water, usually in schools, stay ing either offshore or inshore, depending on the species. Mangrove species live in brackish water around the intertidal shorelines of estuaries and river mouths. Mangroves and seagrass habitats are required by the young of various marine fishes, especially reef species (Lieske and Myers 2002). Chronology of the sites is based on accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) radiocarbon (14C) dates on purified collagen from an individual bone of a terrestrial mammal or reptile identified to species (concepts and methods summarized in Stafford et al. 1991; Steadman et al. 1997). Setting, Stratigraphy, and Chronology of the Sites Milford 1 Site (TOB-3) The only subsurface preceramic site known on Tobago (Boomert 1996:78-80,2000:75-77), TOB 3 lies at an elevation of 4-5 m on a gentle bluff 60 m from a small beach at Milford Bay. Using the habitat classification of Beard (1944), this currently suburban area probably would have sustained Lit toral Woodland and Deciduous Seasonal Forest in a less undisturbed state, with extensive Mangrove Woodlands (as exist today) immediately to the north. Extensive residential (houses) and commer cial (a hotel, restaurant, and paved road) develop ment make it impossible to determine the precise shape and size of the site. Based on surface arti facts and test excavations, we crudely estimate that this single-component site is at least 35 m north south and 20 m east-west. Our primary excavation at TOB-3 consisted of two adjoining 1 m2 units in the densest portion of the midden, which thins out to the east, south, and west. Layer I is a topsoil with artifacts, shell, and bone reworked from Layer II, which is the in situ cultural deposit. We excavated and wet-sieved .46 m3 of Layer II, which is a compacted, organic, very cobbly, very pebbly silt (Munsell Soil Color Chart 10YR 3/3 dark brown-dry; 10YR 2/2 very dark brown-wet) with bedding defined mainly by the abundant marine shell, especially conchs (Strom bus spp.). The clasts in Layer II are mostly of shell in upper levels but with depth include more cob bles and pebbles (limestone as well as diverse non local rock types). Charcoal is rare, small, and unconcentrated. In situ pottery is absent from Layer II, whereas the fairly common lithic artifacts fea ture stone pounders (see Boomert 2000:Figure 12) and probable slingstones of various igneous and metamorphic rocks. Shell beads, bone beads, and bone awls are present as well. No adzes, projectile points, or fishhooks were found. None of our testing away from the primary exca vation revealed evidence of activities other than midden deposition. The only reliable absolute age determination for TOB-3 is an AMS14C date (Beta 153151) from the hum?rus of a peccary (Tayassu tajacu) from Layer II, Level 3 (Table 1), which yielded a 2a-age of 2950-2770 cal B.P. Golden Grove (site TOB-13) TOB-13 lies 3.8 km east-northeast of TOB-3, at 7-10 m elevation on the Golden Grove Estate, cur rently a partially wooded cattle ranch (formerly a sugar plantation [Niddrie 1980:121]). This multi component village site begins on the southwestern slope of a stream valley and mainly occupies a flat limestone terrace (see Boomert 1996:Figure 9). Based on 16 test excavations as well as surface contours and artifacts, site TOB-13 seems to have been a circular plaza village of characteristic Arawakan design (Heckenberger et al. 1999 2003). Nearest access to the ocean, via the stream, is 1.1 km northwest at Buccoo Bay. In a less disturbed condition, the Golden Grove area would have sus tained Deciduous Seasonal Forest (Beard 1944).</page><page sequence="5">CO to o Table 1.

Stratigraphie profile of the west wall of excavation unit 1, Golden Grove site (TOB-13), Tobago. Freshwater Wetlands and Mangrove Woodlands still exist along the stream, as near as 200 m west and northwest of the site. Our faunal analyses are based on a 1-x-l-m excavation in the deepest, richest section of mid den that encircles the site. Other than their extremely high density, the faunal material and arti facts recovered here are representative of what occurs throughout the extensive midden deposits at TOB-13. The density of artifacts (pottery, lithic, shell, and bone) and faunal material (marine shell, bones) is extremely high in the midden deposits at TOB-13 (Boomert 1996:49-60, 2000:345-367; Steadman and Stokes 2002). We found no post holes, hearths, or charcoal concentrations in the midden, although at least 10 percent of the shell and bone is burnt. Our 1 m2 excavation unit reached an average depth of 1.26 m Five major strata are represented (layers I-V; Figure 3). Layer I (Level 1) is a very compacted, pebbly, sandy, clayey topsoil (7.5YR 3/2 dark brown-dry; 10YR 2/2 very dark brown-wet). We subdivided Layer II into ILA (levels 2-3) and IIB (levels 4-5). Layer IIA is a compacted, slightly cobbly, very pebbly, sandy, clayey silt (10YR 3/3 dark brown-dry; 10YR 2/2 very dark brown-wet) with most clasts being marine shells, potsherds, or lithic artifacts. Layer IIB (10YR 4/3 brown/dark brown-dry; 10YR 3/3 dark brown-wet) is more compacted and has more marine shells, especially oysters. Layer III (levels 6-10; 10YR 4/4 dark yel lowish brown-dry; 10YR 3/4 dark yellowish brown-wet) is siltier than Layer II, lacks clay, and has a highly variable shell content. Portions of Layer III are nearly solid shell, especially oysters that are burned and often fused to bones. The parts of Layer III with fewer shells are less compacted, but still contain abundant bones. Layer IV is a compacted to uncompacted, slightly pebbly, slightly sandy silt becoming slightly clayier with depth (levels 11-14; 10YR 4/4 dark yellowish brown-dry; 10YR 3/4 dark yel lowish brown-wet). Layer IV/V (levels 15-16; 10YR 4/6 dark yellowish brown-dry; 10YR 3/6 dark yellowish brown-wet) is more compacted, clayier, and more cobbly than Layer IV. Layer IV/V represents a gradational transition between layers IV and V; other stratigraphie breaks at TOB-13 are</page><page sequence="7">322 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 17, No. 3, 2006] more abrupt. Layer V (levels 17-21; 10YR 4/6 dark yellowish brown to 10YR 5/8 yellowish brown-dry; 10YR 3/6 to 4/6 dark yellowish brown-wet) is a very compacted cobbly, clayey, slightly pebbly, slightly sandy silt that overlies the limestone bedrock. Weathered limestone dominates the clasts in Layer V, which is somewhat saprolitic and thus has poorer preservation of bone and shell than over lying strata. Non-ceramic artifacts from TOB-13 include stone pounders, a crude chert blade, quartz flakes, shell beads, bone beads, bone awls, and quartz dior ite beads. No projectile points or fishhooks were found. Each except the lowest of the 21 levels at TOB-13 has potsherds (abundant in levels 1-12, decreasing in levels 13-19) with diagnostic features that can be related to Tobago's ceramic sequence (see Boomert 1996, 2000; Clement 2000; Harris 1991). Layer I (Level 1) has a mixture of younger (Suazoid) "Plymouth" and slightly older "Golden Grove" ceramics. In Plymouth style (based on pot tery from the Plymouth site, TOB-70), the temper averages coarser and more abundant than in pot tery from lower strata, and the vessel exteriors usu ally are poorly smoothed. One large sherd with geometric incising has a spirally incised conical lug. Other incised sherds from Layer I, conjoining with those from Layer ILA, are of Golden Grove style with parallel scallop incising and ornate geomet ric incising. Some sherds from Layer IIA are still of Plymouth style with poorly smoothed or lightly scratched surfaces. Bowls are the predominant ves sel form in layers I, HA, and IIB. The ceramics in Layer IIB have more precise incising than in lay ers I or ILA. The modeling is characteristic of the "Friendship" series, based on pottery from the Friendship site (TOB-15; Figure 2). Incised designs include circle-dot and curvilinear patterns. Two sherds from Layer ?B, a modeled foot and a red painted anthropomorphic adorno, show the "Bar rancoid influence" that was present in ceramics on many Lesser Antillean islands after 1500-1400 cal B.P. The potsherds from layers III, IV, and IY/V also belong to the Friendship series, but have more mod eling and incising. Red and white paint, some in zones divided by incising, and burnishing are more common than in layers I or II. Broad-line incising gives way to fine-line incising within Layer III, and the variety of vessel forms increases to include bowls with restricted necks, inturned (carinated) bowls, and spouted vessels. Also present are ring bases, D-strap handles, and rim sherds with paral lel incising on or below the rim. Potsherds decline markedly in abundance within layers IV and IV/V. They also are relatively rare (and small) in Layer V, although having diagnostic Mount Irvine (Sal adoid) characteristics such as being thin, hard, tem pered with fine sand, and often painted red. These features are most evident in levels 18-20; the lim ited pottery from Level 17 seems to be more char acteristic of the Friendship than Mount Irvine series. Our designation of the Golden Grove as multi component is based, at this time, on ceramic typol ogy. While the ceramics at TOB-13 do represent four of the styles recognized by Boomert (1996, 2000), many of the changes are subtle (especially "Golden Grove" vs. "Friendship"), and many ves sel types and decorative styles can be found through most of the stratigraphie sequence. Considering as well that the most obvious ceramic changes at TOB 13 seldom correspond with the major stratigraphie changes (layer designations), we suggest an over all trend of cultural continuity at TOB-13 rather than one of replacement. At 95.4 percent confidence, our five AMS 14C dates on terrestrial mammal or reptile bone from TOB-13 range from 970-890, 870-800 cal B.P. (Layer IIA, Level 2) to as old as 1820-1580 cal B.P. (Layer V, Level 19; Table 1). Levels 20 and 21 did not yield enough well preserved bone for AMS 14C dating. The AMS 14C dates from levels 10,13, and 16 would suggest that layers III, IV, and IV/V are very similar in age at ca. 1250 to 1000 cal B.P. (cal A.D. 700-950). Results Fishes Fish bones, which were not identified in Steadman and Stokes (2002), make up &gt;90 percent NISP at each site.

The Scaridae (parrotfishes), Scombridae (tunas), and Exocoetidae (flyingfishes) together contribute 70.2 percent of fish NISP at TOB-3 (Table 3). Carnivorous inshore species that inhabit reef edges and patch reefs are another important part (22.5 percent NISP) of the fish assemblage. This group includes Carangidae (jacks), Lutjanidae (snappers), Haemulidae (grunts), and Serranidae (groupers). Species from mangroves and other brackish water habitats make up only 3.3 percent of fish NISP at TOB-3; these are Albulidae (bonefishes), Batrachoididae (toad fishes), Belonidae (needlefishes), Centropomidae (snooks), and Mugilidae (mullets). Of 12,546 fish NISP at Golden Grove (TOB 13), 4,069 (32 percent) were identified at least to the family level, representing 28 families, 54 gen era, and 67 species. The three most common fam ilies are Scombridae, Scaridae, and Belonidae (total 64.3 percent; Table 3). Vertebrae make up 97+ per cent of the scombrid bones, suggesting that the heads of tuna were discarded elsewhere. Other identified taxa, represented by a variety of elements including &gt;5 percent cranial bones, lack a strong indication of patterned skeletal representation. (Note that recent taphonomic studies, such as Hoff man et al. 2000, have explored the complexities of interpreting element frequencies.) Although over all fish NISP per volume of excavated sediment declines with depth, the intra-site taxonomic vari ation at TOB-13 is minimal. Of the five most fre quent families, percent NISP per layer varies only from 24 to 38 percent in scombrids, 18 to 25 per cent in scarids, 3 to 13 percent in exocoetids, 3.5 to 11 percent in batrachoidids, and 4 to 11 percent in carangids (Table 2). The anterior widths of vertebral centra of all fishes, including identified and unidentified speci mens, indicate that the fishes taken at TOB-3 ranged widely in size (4.0-21.4 mm, mean 10.5 mm, N = 143). This is expected where people used either a technology that is not highly size selective (such as nets) or multiple technologies (such as nets, traps, and hook-and-line). The anterior widths of vertebral centra of all taxa (identified and uniden tified) at TOB-13 vary from 2.3-29.4 mm (mean 8.3 ? 3.5 mm, N = 401), which is even more than at TOB-3. Vertebrae from Layer II at TOB-13 were on average smaller (5.7 ? 3.0 mm, range 2.3-16.4 mm, N = 37) than those from Layer III (8.4 ? 3.4 mm, range 33-29A mm, N = 364). These mea surements suggest a slight decrease in mean fish size over time, both between sites and within TOB 13. Nevertheless, the highly variable vertebral widths at both sites imply the use of multiple tech nologies. Most tuna bones from TOB-13 represent relatively large fishes (&gt;60-75 cm TL), based on comparison with FLMNH specimens of known size. Although tuna vertebral anterior widths range from 3.6 to 29.4 mm (N = 205), their mean size (9.7 mm) represents fishes that likely were caught outside the reef or from boats, along or beyond the island's 100 m bathym?trie contour line. Sea Turtles Bones of sea turtle (Cheloniidae sp.; possible species are Chelonia mydas, Caretta caretta, and Eretmochelys imbricata) occur throughout both sites, but are relatively more common at prece ramic TOB-3 (Tables 4, 5). The bones represent adults/subadults and thus may have been taken on nesting beaches or at sea. While the leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys cori?cea; Dermocheliidae) nests on several beaches on Tobago today, no che loniid sea turtles are known to nest (Murphy 1997:103-110). Terrestrial Vertebrates The bone assemblage at TOB-3 represents only nine non-marine species, dominated by the peccary Tayas su tajacu (Table 4). Most of the broken bones listed as "Medium/large mammal" may be from T. tajacu as well. This species is extremely rare on Tobago today and certainly is gone from the west ern part of the island (Garcia et al. 2005:41 ; Hardy 1982). Two other species of mammals recorded from both sites certainly no longer occur on Tobago, namely the red howler monkey (Alouatta senicu lus) and paca (Agoutipaca). These forest-dwelling species still inhabit Trinidad and the South Amer ican mainland (Eisenberg 1989). The large snake Boa constrictor is the first- or second-most com mon non-marine reptile from either site; all known Tobagonian records of B. constrictor are from the eastern part of the island (Murphy 1997:159-161). The bone assemblage from TOB-13 represents 32 species of small-, medium-, and large-sized amphibians, non-marine reptiles, birds, and mam mals (Table 4).

The rodents from TOB-13 consist of seven small species (Heteromys anomalus through Echimys armatus) as well as the agouti and the extirpated paca. The local status of the seven small rodents is unstudied in the Golden Grove region, although each species is believed still to inhabit some part of Tobago (Eshelman and Morgan 1985; Hardy 1982). The small mammal fauna of Tobago is very poorly documented; to begin a thorough survey of them is a priority of future research. No amphibians or birds were recovered at TOB 3. Their absence in the lowest strata at TOB -13 may be a sampling artifact, with terrestrial NISP being only 16 in Layer V and 17 in Layer IV/V. The 10 taxa of birds from TOB-13 all still exist on Tobago (ffrench 1991). They range from small species of the forest and forest-edge such as the flycatcher Cnemotriccus fuscatus to large species character istic of wetlands (the herons ?rdea alba, Nyc tanassa viol?cea) and forest/forest-edge/swamp forest (the hawk Buteogallus urubitinga and chachalaca Ortalis ruficauda).

Overall bone influx (NISP per m3 of excavated sediment) is greater at TOB-13 than at TOB-3 for fish (6,939 vs. 2,317), sea turtle (289 vs. 138), and terrestrial species (801 vs. 393). Therefore we use relative abundance (percent frequencies) for much of our inter-site comparison. Changes in Fishing Although Tobago lies on the continental shelf, TOB-3 and TOB-13 are both within several kilo meters of the deep Atlantic Ocean where pelagic fishes are available. Sandy bays, coral reefs, man groves, and estuarine rivers are other marine habi tats that would have been easily accessible to the inhabitants of both sites. Within this environmen tal setting, we see five main chronological shifts in fishing, based on data in Tables 2 and 3. 1. The NISP of tuna increases from 12 percent to 30 percent of the fish assemblage. The Little Tunny (Euthynnus alletteratus) is common at both sites, although more so at TOB-13. Two other tunas that tend to inhabit deeper water than E. allettera tus are Katsuwonus pelamis and Thunnus sp., both of which are recorded at TOB-13 but not TOB-3. 2. Toadfishes (Batrachoididae) NISP increase from 0.1 percent at TOB-3 to 8 percent at TOB-13. 3. Taxa that inhabit mangrove and brackish water environments increase in NISP from 3.3 per cent to 24.3 percent (Figure 4). These include (in decreasing order of abundance at TOB-13) Belonidae, Batrachoididae, Centropomidae, Mugilidae, Sciaenidae, Albulidae, Tetraodontidae, and Elopidae. 4. The NISP of parrotfish declines from 45 per cent at TOB-3 to 22 percent at TOB-13. 5. Carnivorous inshore fishes inhabiting reef edge and patch reef (Carangidae, Haemulidae, Ser ranidae, and Lutjanidae) decline in NISP from 23 percent to 8 percent. Although we recorded 39 species offish at TOB 3 vs. 67 species at TOB-13, the variety of exploited fish did not necessarily increase over time. When the TOB-13 assemblage is broken down to com parable samples of NISP (individual layers; Table 2), the apparent difference in species richness dis sipates, becoming a product of sampling. Four of the five species recorded at TOB-3 but not TOB 13 are reef species, whereas the 33 species recorded at TOB-13 but not TOB-3 are highly diverse taxo nomically and ecologically. Many researchers have explored changes in fish ing over time at localities worldwide, and in the Caribbean specifically (e.g., Allen 2002; deFrance et al. 1996; Jackson et al. 2001 ;Newsom and Wing 2004; Reitz 2004; Wing 2001; Wing and Reitz 1982). Examining fish bone assemblages from 14 ceramic-age (&lt;2500 cal B.P; Keegan 1994) sites across the Caribbean, Wing (2001:516) found a temporal shift in focus from reef fishes to inshore and pelagic fishes, especially tuna. She attributed</page><page sequence="14">REPORTS 329 Table 5.

We see a similar trend on Tobago, with reef fishes and inshore/pelagics accounting for 69 and 31 percent of the fish NISP from TOB-3, compared to 32 and 68 percent at TOB-13 (Figure 4). We note, how ever, that the TOB-3 fauna is from a preceramic (3000-2800 cal B.P.) rather than ceramic (&lt;2500 cal B.P.) context. Thus, the shift in marine subsis tence may have occurred on Tobago earlier than on islands to the north. TOB-3 is Tobago's oldest known archaeological site, although given the much earlier habitation sites on Trinidad (to ca. 8000 cal B.P.; Boomert 2000), people probably inhabited Tobago well before the time of TOB-3. It is impor tant to realize, therefore, that the fish fauna exploited by the inhabitants of TOB-3 probably already had a history of human exploitation. The increase in mangrove-inhabiting fish taxa at TOB-13 may be related in part to a geographi cal rather than cultural factor. The primary means of access to the sea from TOB-13 is along a stream than bisects a mangrove swamp for several hun dred meters. TOB-3, on the other hand, lies on a small bluff above a beach, providing direct access to the ocean without entering mangrove habitats. Toadfishes, nearly absent at TOB-3 but common at TOB-13, are bottom-dwellers that range from shallow inshore areas to deep waters, although some species also enter mangroves, brackish water, and rivers (Fisher 1978; Froese and Pauly 2004). The frequency of toadfishes and other probable mangrove and brackish water taxa at Golden Grove may be related to the site's proximity to a fresh water stream and mangroves. On Tobago today, we have observed that toadfishes are caught primarily with traps (Fisher 1978). Following Brown (1945), we believe that traps were the most likely method of prehistoric capture as well. In sum, the fish bone assemblages from Milford 1 and Golden Grove suggest that nets, traps, hook and-line, and canoes were all employed by occu pants of both sites to fish Tobago's bays, lagoons, mangroves, reefs, and deep water. Nevertheless, the focus of these activities changed through time. The abundance of tuna in the ceramic period exceeds that at other Caribbean sites, which are dominated by a combination of reef and inshore taxa (e.g., Drewett 1991; O'Day 2002; Versteeg and Rostain 1997; Wing 2001). The hook-and-line fishing required to catch these pelagic fishes must have been practiced from highly seaworthy water craft, suggesting better seafaring technology dur ing ceramic than preceramic times. The greater relative abundance of cheloniid sea turtle bones at TOB-3 than TOB-13 (Tables 4 and 5) hints at resource depression of a large marine animal that is known to be easily over-exploited on its nesting beaches (Frazier 2004). In leading a mainly marine existence but being highly vulner able to human pr?dation on its terrestrial nesting grounds, sea turtles resemble sea birds (albatrosses, petrels, shearwaters, boobies, tropicbirds, terns, etc.), which also have undergone major reductions in global distribution and population since prehis toric human arrival on islands (Steadman 2006). Changes in Hunting The 181 bones of terrestrial vertebrates at TOB-3 represent nine species, compared to 32 species among the 1,009 bones of terrestrial vertebrates from TOB-13 (Table 4, Figure 5). Even in sub samples of NISP from TOB-13 comparable to 181, species richness remains greater than at TOB-3. For example, 205 bones from Layer IV of TOB-13 rep resent 14 species, and 22 species are revealed in 205 bones from Layer III at TOB-13. Layer I at TOB-13, where the NISP is only 44, yielded nine terrestrial species, the same number as from all of TOB-3. Among the four classes of terrestrial vertebrates, the largest difference in species richness was in birds, with 10 at TOB-13 (two herons, hawk, chachalaca, dowitcher, two doves, parrot, fly catcher, and passerine) versus none at TOB-3.

Percentages calculated considering only marine taxa for fish and sea turtles, and only terrestrial taxa for amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. 3 are the richer sets of amphibians (2 vs. 0 species), lizards (4 vs. 1 species), and small rodents (7 vs. 1 species). Both sites yielded bones of two species of mammal that no longer occur on Tobago (red howler monkey Alouatta seniculus, paca Agouti paca). That each of the terrestrial species from TOB-3 was recorded as well at TOB-13 suggests that human impact (hunting, habitat loss) was not sufficient during late preceramic times to extin guish many if any species. This idea can be tested through further excavation at TOB-3 (Tobago's only subsurface preceramic site) and at preceramic sites yet to be discovered. The percent NISP of reptiles is much lower, and that of mammals much higher, at TOB-3 than at TOB-13 (Figure 6). Considering the four most abundant mammals, the collared peccary Tayassu tajacu has an influx value (bones per m3 of sedi ment) more than double, and a percent NISP more than 13 times greater, at TOB-3 than TOB-13 (Table 4, Figure 7). The opposite trend applies to the three common species of medium-sized mammals, each of which is more poorly represented at TOB-3 than at TOB-13. At 17-30 kg, the nearly extirpated Tayassu tajacu is the largest mammal from either site. Next largest are the two extirpated species, Agouti paca (5-13 kg) and Alouatta seniculus (3.6-11.1 kg), followed by the extant (but rare) nine-banded armadillo Dasypus novemcinctus and the less rare agouti Dasyprocta leporina, each of which weighs ca. 3 to 6 kg. Bones from each of these mammals have been reported as well from archaeological sites on Trinidad (Wing and Reitz 1982). When not fishing or capturing sea turtles, exploitation of vertebrates in late preceramic times on Tobago focused on hunting big game (pecca ries). The non-marine species at TOB-3 comprise only three reptiles and six mammals, whereas the 32 non-marine species at TOB-13 mostly represent small- to medium-sized vertebrates (&lt; 10 kg, often &lt; 1 kg) such as a toad, lizards, snakes, birds, opos sum, armadillo, and eight species of rodents. These differences may be due to a local or island-wide scarcity of big game (peccaries) in ceramic times, which would have promoted diversification of hunt ing practices. Related to this may have been a much higher human population in ceramic times. Based on surveys, the coral lowlands of western Tobago have only one subsurface preceramic site but seven subsurface ceramic sites, each much larger than TOB-3.

When not at sea, Tobago's ceramic ( Arawakan) peoples appear to have main tained a more sedentary way of life, with increased agriculture leading to more opportunistic hunting of any sort of game near where they lived, and with less time devoted to longer distance big-game hunt ing. That peccaries also became scarcer within the ceramic era is suggested by the percent NISP at TOB-13, which declines from 12 in layers IV-V to 5 in layers I-III (Figure 7). The combined peccary data from both sites suggests a population depres sion of highly ranked prey, as has been evidenced in the archaeological record in a number of situa tions, whether insular or continental, temperate or tropical (Broughton 1994,1997; Butler 2001 ; Carl son and Keegan 2004; Steadman 1995). We do not believe that site location is responsible for the dif ference in hunting peccaries. If anything, one would expect less rather than more big-game hunting at a coastal site (TOB-3) than an inland site (TOB-13). A Final Word Collaborating with other archaeologists, biologists, and geologists, we plan to continue studying the prehistory of Tobago. Our future research priori ties include the following. (1) Survey for other pre ceramic sites, with the possibility of finding sites older than TOB-3, such as those already known on Trinidad. (2) Make detailed comparisons of prece ramic vs. ceramic-era lithic assemblages, shell and bone artifacts, marine invertebrate remains, and site size, configuration, and setting. Such informa tion is needed to enhance the cultural context of the abundant vertebrate remains. (3) Explore the cur rently unknown archaeobotanical record of Tobago. Evidence of deforestation and horticulture (or lack thereof) might support or challenge our hypothe sized prehistoric decline in forest-dwelling mam mals. We eventually hope to develop a comprehensive coverage of at least the last 3,000 years of prehistory on this continental island, which undoubtedly was involved in the peopling of oceanic islands to the north. Given the rapid pace of land development on Tobago today, there is no time to lose. Lastly, we would like to stress that the nature and extent of the contact between preceramic and ceramic peoples on Tobago (and across the Caribbean region) is poorly understood. Similari ties and differences in their fishing and hunting techniques are largely speculative because, as can be the case in continental settings as well (e.g., Stothert et al. 2003), little if any fishing or hunting gear is recovered from most archaeological sites. We are forced to make common-sense inferences about how these people fished and hunted primar ily from the taxonomic composition of the faunal assemblages. Acknowledgments.

We thank our coworkers in the field (Robert Austin, Michael Heckenberger, Micah Mones, Patrick O'Day, David J. Steadman, Edward Steadman, Norman Steadman, Anne Stokes, Ruth Stokes, and Joshua Toney). For access to FLMNH specimens, we thank scientists in the Herpetology, Ornithology, Mammalogy, and Zooarchaeology collections at the Florida Museum of Natural History. Robert Robins checked nomenclature of fishes. Matthew Reetz helped to prepare the tables and figures. The fieldwork was funded by the Foundation for Exploration and Research on Cultural Origins (FERCO) through a grant to Anne V. Stokes and DWS, and by the Florida Museum of Natural History Director's Office (from Graig Shaak and Douglas Jones to DWS). Funding for radiocarbon dating was provided by the University of Florida Research Foundation. The manuscript was improved through criticism by Michael Heckenberger and Anne Stokes.
