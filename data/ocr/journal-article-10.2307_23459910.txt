Abstract A robot is an electro-mechanical device that uses microprocessor technology and information received from one or more sensors to manipulate objects within its immediate environment. Today such devices are being used in rehabilitation to provide increased opportunities for independent functioning to the severely physically disabled. This paper consists of an overview of the current state of the art of robots in rehabilitation. This is accomplished by 1) describing robots in terms of their components parts, 2) comparing rehabilitation robots to their industrial counterparts and 3) describing the chief commercially available rehabilitation robots. It is anticipated that this information will provide clinicians and potential users with a realistic appreciation of the value and feasibility of robotics in rehabilitation. ♦ ♦ ♦ Introduction To the average layman the word robot evokes images of Star Wars' R2D2, the Bionic man and the Space Shuttle arm.

The result of such programs are calls to the local rehabilitation facility with demands for "that wonderful electronic gadget that will let me walk again". Clinicians are more restrained in their enthusiasm. Their professional experience and knowledge render them able to perceive the functional limitations, technical hazards and high costs associated with such devices. Unfortunately, at least part of their skeptism results from a lack of awareness of some very real progress that has been made in this field in recent years. One of the first steps on the road to awareness is the realization that robotic aids are only one more in a natural progression of technological developments that have taken place in rehabilitation within the last forty years. The first significant application of "high" technology to rehabilitation occurred in the 1940s when the value of electromyography to the measurement of human muscle function was recognized (Licht, 1980). Although this technique was initially developed as a tool for the diagnosis of muscle and nerve pathology, its potential as an external measure of muscle activation for the control of artificial limbs was almost immediately recognized. The development of a variety of myoelectric prostheses such as the Utah arm ensued (Jacobson, Knutti, Johnson &amp; Sears, 1982). Concepts and techniques pioneered throughout the evolution of myoelectric prosthesis were applied to robotics as soon as the cost, size and power of microprocessor components became feasible within the clinical milieu. The fact that therapists and potential users were already sensitized to personal (e.g. home and office work) and therapeutic (e.g. cognitive assessment) applications of the computer contributed to the psychological acceptance of robotic use. The objective of this paper is to present an overview of the current state of the art of robots in rehabilitation. This will be</page><page sequence="3">The Israel Journal of Occupational Therapy E3 accomplished by 1) describing a robot in terms of its components parts, 2) comparing rehabilitation robots to their industrial counterparts and 3) presenting summaries of the chief commercially available rehabilitation robots. It is anticipated that this information will provide both clinicians and potential users with a realistic appreciation of the virtues and limitations of rehabilitation robotics. Factors to be considered when designing and fabricating a robot. A robot is an electro-mechanical device that uses microprocessor technology and information received from one or more sensors to manipulate objects within its immediate environment (Preising, Hsia £ Mittelstadt, 1991). In order to create a device that is readily comprehended by users (without the need for extensive training) and that has universal esthetic acceptability, most robots are anthropomorphic in appearance and behaviour (Jacobsen, 1990). That is, their appearance, design and function are based on a human model. For this reason, a realistic portrayal of a robot's complexity and limitations is best achieved by comparing its components to the human equivalent. As shown in Table I six major factors must be considered when designing and fabricating a robot. An actuator and power source are needed to manipulate objects and to react to both anticipated and unexpected disturbances in the vicinity. The human body's metabolic capacity ensures the proper functioning of tendons and muscles. Batteries and motors are used to achieve a similar, although less efficent, capability in robots. The difficulty in providing both a large and persistent source of energy to motors capable of lifting sufficient loads and, simultaneously, limiting the weight of such components, represents a serious restriction to robot capacity. To date, the efficiency of electro-mechanical or hydraulic motors in terms of work duration, load capacity and component size is far</page><page sequence="4">E4 February 1993, Vol. 2, No. 1 less than that of the human body (Jacobsen, Wood, Knutti fe Biggers, 1984).

For example, the disabled user may command a robotic arm to place an item in a particular location. The initial command set is based on the distance needed to be traversed and on an estimation of the weight of the item. If the item is heavier than anticipated, force sensors in the gripper (the robot's "hand") will notify the motor via feedback circuitry thereby causing the motor to generate more force. The human body's diverse and complex array of sensory receptors as well as its intricate system of neural networks have not yet been replicated in robotic devices. It is therefore unrealistic to expect a robot to perform with comparable rapidity and precision. Nevertheless, the relatively small number of strategically placed force and position sensors currently found in today's robots ensure a satisfactory ability to move smoothly and to adapt to unanticipated disturbances. The human body makes use of the passive and reflex properites of its skin, muscles, tendons and ligaments to decrease the need to expend energy when reacting to unexpected disturbances. The visco-elastic characteristics of these tissues prevent such disturbances from moving a limb beyond a physiologically safe range of motion. Reflex responses to heavy loads and large displacements help to protect the integrity of the body's parts by causing the limb to minimize its response to potentially dangerous inputs. The passive properties of a robot's metal and plastic materials are less responsive to disturbances, a fact that limits their capacity to deflect shocks and prevent injury (Jacobsen, 1990). Moreover they are not linked via sensory receptors to reflex circuits. The apparent strength of the metal and plastic materials that comprise robot components and packaging misrepresents the robot's ability to withstand damage. Indeed, the rigidity of metal and plastic materials and the lack of</page><page sequence="6">E6 February 1993, Vol. 2, No. 1 reflex response make them more susceptible to breakage than human limbs. Whereas the human limb will be moved to avoid injury, its robotic counterpart will remain in place and break. The link between the disabled individual and the robot is known as the user interface. There is no human equivalent to this element since the link between motor plan and motor performance is inherent. In robotics, the user interface permits the human "master" to command the robot "slave" to carry out specific functions. The user interface must be constructed to provide a clear association between command and performance and yet be within the physical capacity of the user. Factors to be considered in the design of the user interface include the number of independent control switches, the use of a discrete or continuous range of control, the dimension and magnitude of control (e.g. force or position), and whether the user will control individual joint movements or the position of the end unit (i.e. the gripper) (van Vliet and Wing, 1991). In modern robots user interfaces can be operated by a variety of input devices including speech recognition, joystick manipulation and switches (e.g. puff-and-sip) to manipulate the robot with up to ten degrees of freedom including vertical and horizontal translation, gripper opening and closing, and "wrist", "elbow" and "shoulder" rotation. In this way, many diverse tasks such as computer operator functions, environmental control unit, eating and drinking, and avocational activities (e.g. reading, playing games) are achievable. Industrial versus rehabilitation robots A major impetus in the development of rehabilitation robots was the technical innovations acquired during the fabrication of industrial manipulators. There are, however, significant differences between the two types of robots which must be recognized (Preising et al., 1991; van Vliet ä Wing, 1991). These</page><page sequence="7">The Israel Journal of Occupational Therapy E7 differences relate to the robot's mobility, adaptability to multiple tasks, durability, appearance, safety, and cost. As shown in Table II, certain factors have greater or lesser importance according to whether they are applied to a robot designed for industrial or rehabilitation purposes. For example, the typical industrial robot can be placed in a fixed location where it executes a particular task. Thus neither mobility nor task flexibility have great importance in the automobile industry where each robot manipulator carries out a specific assignment in a fixed site on the assembly line. In contrast, a rehabilitation manipulator will be minimally useful unless it is capable of carrying out a variety of tasks within a reasonably sized work envelope (the area within which the robot arm moves).

Cost is less important to</page><page sequence="8">E8 February 1993, Vol. 2, No. 1 industrial applications since it is compared to savings achieved by the need to employ fewer workers. Rehabilitation robots also save money by reducing attendant care salaries and by enabling greater numbers of disabled users to become vocationally independent. However, the high cost of a robot adapted for a specific user and its maintenance still acts as a deterrent to the agencies responsible for funding such devices. Robot durability is important to both applications although there is a greater need to construct industrial robots from highly resistant materials, especially in the case of contact with toxic substances. Note, that although safety plays an important role in both applications, industrial robots are often located at a distance from human workers (van Vliet 8z Wing, 1991). Their potential to cause injury via unexpectedly rapid movements or breakage is therefore smaller. In contrast, rehabilitation robots are generally programmed to operate at extremely slow velocities when in the near vicinity of the human operator. Some examples of major rehabilitation robots In recent years a number of prominent rehabilititation research centers have made significant strides in the development or adaptation of robotic aids for the disabled (Pullin and Gammie, 1991). At its 1992 annual conference, RESNA, an interdisciplinary association for the advancement of rehabilitation and assisitive technology, organized a full day international symposium on applications of robotic manipulators in rehabilitation practice (Presperin, 1992). The chief robotic systems presented at that conference are briefly described below. There appear to be three main approaches to the design of a rehabilitation robot: fixed, single purpose units; fixed, multi-purpose units; and mobile, multi-purpose units. Fixed, single purpose units consist of robots that have been designed to carry out one specific function. For example, the Handi 1 robotic aid to eating currently provides the capacity for independent</page><page sequence="9">The Israel Journal of Occupational Therapy E9 feeding to more than 30 disabled children and adults in school, residential and clinical settings (Whittaker, 1992). Handy 1 is used on a regular basis by most of the users who indicated that their satisfaction with the device's efficiency as a feeder, its safety and esthetics was generally high. Fixed, multi-purpose robots are typically designed to fit into customized office workstations. The fact that these robots are used in fixed locations simplifies the user's task of operating the unit. Since the unit is always operated within a pre-defined workspace, commands consist of much simpler relational directives (e.g. "up", "down") rather than absolute locations in space (e.g. ordering the gripper to move to a particular site). The Stanford University DeVAR workstation is one of the most successful examples of such a unit (Van der Loos, 1992). This is a desktop vocational assistant robot that is capable of executing activities of daily living (e.g. feeding, drinking, hygiene), vocational tasks (e.g. material handling, computer access) and recreational pursuits (e.g. video access, board games). The CEA Master, developed in France by the Commissariat ä l'energie atomique, is another example of a robotic workstation and is used to manipulate objects and carrying out tasks such as telephoning, eating, inserting computer disks into the appropriate drive and removing single sheets of paper from a printer (Detriche and Lesigne, 1992). Items of varying sizes are moved with the aid of smaller or larger grippers. The user commands the unit via switches, proportional sensors (e.g. joysticks) or speech recognition. The Regenesis robotic assistive appliance is a third example (Birch and Fengler, 1992). This relatively low cost workstation permits most functions associated with computerized office work. The third type of robot manipulator is the mobile, multi-purpose unit. The Manus Manipulator is the most popular and successful example of such a robot (Oderud and Bastiansen, 1992; Kwee, Thonnissen, Cremers, Duimel Sc Westgeest, 1992;</page><page sequence="10">E10 February 1993, Vol. 2, No. 1 Verberg, Milner, Nauman, Bishop ä Sas, 1992). This is a wheelchair mounted manipulator that provides disabled individuals with robotic control in any location in which they choose to be. It is a relatively compact unit that can be folded away when not in use and can be fitted to many different types of wheelchairs. Mobile robots tend to be more complex to control and to cost more. Nevertheless, they have been used with considerable success by a variety of different disabled users. In summary, it is evident that there are numerous examples of applications of robotic aids in rehabilitation that have been used with physically disabled adults (e.g. Seamone 8c Schmeisser, 1985; Hillman, Pullin, Gammie, Stammers 8c Orpwood, 1991) and children (e.g. Gosine et al., 1989). Although the number of users in most of these studies are still quite small, the results are encouraging. Given adequate training and technical support most users report satisfaction with their robotic aids. Nevertheless, serious limitations remain. The speed with which tasks can be carried out (due to the time required command the manipulator and for the robot itself to execute the task), the inability to ensure complete reliability and accuracy, limited sensor feedback to the user and the high cost of the more flexible and robust units can be significant deterrents in many rehabilitation applications. Future Trends Despite the considerable advances that have taken place in this field over the last ten years, robotic aids are still far from being available to any potential physically disabled user. Serious limitations of affordability, training time and the need for extensive maintenance must be acknowledged when discussing the possibility of recommending that a specific client be provided with and trained in the use of a robot. Nevetheless, robotic aids are undergoing constant development including improvements in both design and implementation. Continued technical advances</page><page sequence="11">The Israel Journal of Occupational Therapy E11 including the miniaturization of microprocessor componenets, the development of better sensors, the fabrication of new packaging and connector materials, the construction of smaller and more efficient actuators will have a major impact on robotic aids within the next five to ten years. As robotic aids become more reliable and available, consumer demand will increase and this will, in turn, lower the costs of such units. References Birch, G.E. 8c Fengler, M. (1992).
