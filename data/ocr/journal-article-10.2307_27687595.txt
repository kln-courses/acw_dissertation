<plain_text><page sequence="1">Odysseus Tsagarakis : Nature and Background of Major Concepts of Divine Power in Homer. Amsterdam: Gr?ner 1977. XVIII, 160 S. 60 hfl. Somewhat in opposition to the too psychological and agnostic Dodds, or others too literary, T. has attempted to trace the religious experience of Homeric man as religious experience. The purpose, however, is somewhat nobler than the result. Perhaps the medium affects the message. His chap ter headings are: Zeus, Apollo, Athena, Theoi, Theos, Daimon, Moira; under each topic are subdivisions such as ?aids man, harms man, fulfills wishes, inspires?, etc. Besides limiting the scope of his treatment, this index card approach contributes toward blurring distinctions between dif ferent Homeric poems and their parts, or at least treating passages out of context. The author's somewhat formulaic style contributes to the effect: statement of the contents of the material, small block of Greek text, rea sonably modest and usually uninspired discussion - all in a rather predic table fashion. Though he has read voluminously, some recent work like Griffin's on the epic cycle and Homer, JHS 97, 1977, 39~54, Suerbaum on the Ich Erz?hlung, Po?tica 2, 1968, 150-177, and Vermeule's G?tterkult would have helped. Rather than enlarge upon the work of excellent scholars like Chantraine, Wilford, Adkins, Fauth, Nilsson, Dodds, and others he tends to snub or pick fights with them. (He needlessly thrusts at Heden's ancient shade \G?tterStudien, 1912].) Methodologically he ignores distinctions between the prologue to the Odyssey, the Nostos, and Ithakan parts, and the Iliad. This is only part of a general tendency toward oversimplification. At times he is on the right track with distinctions between Zeus, daimon, theos, and other Olympian gods, at other times quite adrift. The attempt to take Homeric religion seriously is admirable, and he is right in his assertion that the contemporary treatments are sometimes too psychological or literary, but he evokes an unnecessary opposition bet ween religious psychology and religion (for example, Athena in A as a projection of Achilleus). Again and again he appears to sense where prob lems lie in the traditional or standard treatments - perhaps based on his own appreciation for religious belief, but fails to pursue his instincts to a satisfying conclusion. For example, he senses that something is wrong with J?rgensen's indispensable observations but misguided deduction on the use of theos, daimon, theoi and Zeus in books t-(Aof the Odyssey (Hermes 39, 1904, 357?382) ; yet later in his own book seems to be operat ing very much like J?rgensen. (T. never really indicates the thrust of J?r gensen s article). The trouble is that T. does not come to grips with the religious structure of the Nostos and with the importance of daimon in these books; e. g., the non-appearance of Olympian gods as helpers (or villains) in the way they operate in the Iliad, and the type of divine justice and vengeance operative. (Here his bibliography could be better.) Wil ford (Numen 13, 1965, 217-232), who sees a different and more likely 33 Gnomon 1980</page><page sequence="2">5io F. E. Brenk : Tsagarakis, Divine Power in Homer older pre-anthropomorphic religious structure working in most manifesta tions of daimon, is more convincing. T. seems oblivious to the possibility of different layers of religious systems at work in the Homeric poems. Though he mentions Homer's rationalizing of the divine, we find little on bird or human epiphanies, and levels of divine encounter. (On this see Bannert, WSt 12, 1978, 29-42.) Generally his application of material later than the Homeric poems is not very helpful, though the idea is good. Do we really need to know that there are parallels for (iiyiaTs as a title of Zeus in later Greek cult practice, that the modern Greek God lives in heaven, that Zeus is more than just an agent of elemental forces (3,7), or Spartan evidence that Zeus gives victory to mortals (11)? A lack of precision is evident in the technical details, something not enhanced by three pages of errata at the beginning of the book - themselves more a prologue than a complete listing. For example in the Greek - which in general is accurate, p. 11, P 176 leaves out voo?; p. 12, P 565, Srji?cov should be Syj?ocov; p. 12, O 11 &amp;r?ai should be aj?ai. The notes are not accurate enough; e. g. note 1, p. VII Motivation', not ?Motivierung?, in Lesky's article; note 34 p. XII, T. N. Wade-Gery should be H. T. Wade-Gery; the quote markers are inconsistent in note 13 (3). Like the notes, the index leaves something to be desired: e. g., W. Kullmann, XI n. 78, should be IX n. 18; J?rgensen, XI, n. 16 n. 17, should be IX n. 15, n. 16; the index gives Wilford, 100, but on that page we find a note with op. cit. (nor is the article cited in the biblio graphy). Inconsistencies occur in the text such as themistas and themistes, daimones and daimons, and he has forgotten to underline some Greek words on occasion, e. g. Algea (14) and olbos (62). Most of these things are petty, but with a consistency to be annoying. In general his English is quite respectable, but falling prey to the irresistible temptation of Greeks used to German, he unnecessarily capitalized such things as 'life* and literature' (43, note 15). English purists may be a little ruffled by ?Agamem non is fooled up by a dream? (1), Odysseus ?prays for help and is given a sleep? (32), ?a shocking attitude of a god-fearing man like Achilles? (41); ?No sooner had left Polyphemus the cave for his daily shepherding than Odysseus laid out a plan to deal with him later on that evening? (114). He seems to be saying in 53, note 33 that be cause yXauxcom? is a cult epithet in later Greek religion that it must have been so in Homer, and that in I 390 gpya implies the cult of Athene Ergane. He states (48) that the Linear B tablets at Pylos attest the worship of Athena at Pylos. ( Vermeule [G?tter kult], 65 does not list Athena as one of the gods in the Pylos tablets, and [77] - seeing A tana as not necessarily Athens or Athena - denotes Athena as only possibly being in the Linear B tablets.) As mentioned above, part of the author's difficulties comes from a failure to estimate the complexity of his subject, to distinguish different parts of the Homeric epics and adequately to isolate key concepts. One can cite the discussion on crime and punishment (25 ff), i. e., Nestor's speech y 132 ff on the punishment meted out to the heroes on their homecoming. There he takes the expression oi&gt; tl vovjfxove? ouS? Stxociot, to indicate the omission of sacrifice, and that they ?sinned in other ways?, based on other Homeric texts in which these words appear. But not enough atten tion is given to the identifiable crimes in this section. Can we really attri bute the punishment which followed upon eating the cattle of Helios to disobedience (26)? The structure of crime and punishment in the Nostos is quite complex, but in general is closer to that of the Iliad than that of the Odyssey prologue; i. e. transgression upon the domain or privileges of</page><page sequence="3">F. E. Brenk : Tsagarakis, Divine Power in Homer 511 a god is a more important cause for worry than moral transgressions. (At least this is the more obvious framework, though another moral one seems to be running as an undercurrent through the Nostos.) In any case it is too simple just to say that Zeus punishes wrongdoers. T. is uncertain of the medicinal role of Apollo (36 ff), but his part in the plague in A and in the Niobe story suggests his power over disease. T. should have given more attention to the term oXa&gt;T&lt;XTs used for Apollo (see Scodel, HarvSt 81, 1977, 55?57). Homer brings out this aspect in the death of Patroklos. Chantraine's understanding of the divine interventions and epiphanies as rooted in the human experience of putting a religious inter pretation on natural phenomena - e. g. that a person we saw was really a god in disguise - would resolve many of the author's difficulties in this area. Here is one place where parallels with modern Greek religion could be very helpful, but we learn little more than of their existence. Throughout the treatment of theos and daimon, the author's failure to see daimon religion as operating somewhat independently of anthropo morphic religion results in an inadequate portrayal of Homeric religious psychology. At &lt;p 280 Odysseus says that the god {theos) will give power to whom he wishes - referring to the archery contest. T. feels compelled to identify this god with Apollo (265 ff) based on Antinoos' reference to Apollo in connection with the contest. At 1 42 some god {tis theos) brings Odysseus to the island of the Cyclops. T. rightly suggests that this concept is very close to that of the operation of a daimon (88), but in note 11 where he discusses similar contexts, the theos ?is in all probability Zeus?. Similarly at 1 338 if, where the Cyclops leaves the sheep in the cave ^ ti o?aajxevo? 9] xai &amp;eo? ?? ?x?Xeuaev, he takes this theos to be Athena, on the basis of 317 e? tuco? Tiaoc?jxTjv, So?tq S? [loi so^o? 9A&amp;r?vr? (95). The rather startling introduction of Athena at this point in the Nostos receives no comment. Lacking also is even a hint of the abnormally psycholo gical role of Athena in the Ithakan part, particularly in her relationship to Penelope. T. objects to Dodds' and Nilsson's correct understanding that daimon is used when the author is faced with vagueness or ignorance as to the exact spiritual force (better, the character expresses it as a vague spiritual force - something well analyzed by Wilford). Unconvincing are his asser tions that daimon is used in place of Zeus, for formulaic reasons (108), that the daimon which sends a sea monster (s 421) must be Poseidon (110), or that the harmful function of the daimon is identical to that of the gods (110). Yet, the discussion on 111 suggests that kakos daimon is something vague and unidentifiable. (He makes the interesting observation that kakos is never used for a god.) Later again, (140) daimon seems to be un derstood both as the identifiable god and as a vague force: ?For Homeric man daimon seems to be no more than another term of reference to his gods with some of whom he may still be identified.? Properly understood, this is an excellent formulation; i. e., the daimon religion is competing with anthropomorphic religion and there is some confusion. But the drift of T.'s book is that the daimon always has to be identified with some an thropomorphic god. Matters are made worse when he links the Homeric daimon to the later cult of the daimon. The formulation gives him one 33*</page><page sequence="4">512 E. Degani: West, Studies in Greek Elegy and Iambus last chance for an implicit snub of Wilford and other Freudian* interpre tations of the daimons role. Finally, the discussion on moira is not all that clear, though he does elucidate different aspects. He understands it as the fulfillment of certain things in one's life, both pleasant and unpleasant. But one wonders if he gives enough attention here to the idea of allotment, and the obviously close relationship between moira and death in the Iliadic Homer. Possibly the criticisms levelled here simply represent a difference of viewpoint. The merit of the book is that it puts within a small compass texts and discussion of very important material. But overall one feels that it is a step backward, a movement toward oversimplification, a failure to appreciate the work of other Homeric scholars, a too narrow approach to the subject. The greatest value of the work may be propagandistic, a call to scholars to study in depth the phenomena of Homeric religion not as a sociological system or study in religious psychology, but as religious feel ing and instinct. Several years ago the point was made by Michael Jame son in a review for this journal, complaining about Nilsson's distaste ?for the misty quagmires of mystical interpretation?: ?He could not stomach the 'G?tterapparat* of Homer and there is a certain chill solemnity that declares it to be a debasing of religion? (42, 1970, 53). T. certainly does not err in this direction. Milwaukee, Wis. Frederick E. Brenk *</page></plain_text>
