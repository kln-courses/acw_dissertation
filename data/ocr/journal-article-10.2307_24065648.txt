<plain_text><page sequence="1">36 r Current I Science REVIEWS The Evolution of Development. By J. T. Bonner. (Cambridge University Press, Bentley House, 200, Euston Road, London, N.W. 1), 1958. Pp. 102. Price 17 s. 6 d. Dr. Bonner's controversial lectures given at University College, London, less than two years ago have now been printed. They were con troversial because they demanded imagination and humility. His critics were whisked from subjects about which they had never heard, and therefore had no previous interest, to those about which they were so convinced that "they knew it all before" that they switched off mentally, and so did not recognise that it was at least being said "inside out", and often in consequence, it was not only surprising but constructive. For example, Dr. Bonner's main attack is one of the most well-tried in biology. He examines the efficient causes of an evolutionary advance by the method of comparing the many unsatis factory attempts to solve it; as for example, an understanding of the function of the reptilian-avian egg may be sought in a compari son of the many kinds of terrestrial eggs of amphibia and fishes; and discussion of the "conquest of the land" requires an understand ing of the stimuli that bring so many fish species up to gulp atmospheric air. But Dr. Bonner applies this method to the very general problem of a repeated develop ment of multicellularity from a unicellular zygote by each individual (Sensu lato) in every generation, and he can speak of the solutions not in this anthropomorphic, creationist, final istic vocabulary which I have used, but as the result of past and continuing selection pres sures. The nature of embryologist's material makes this especially difficult for themâ€”witness their leanings towards Lysenkoism. I think many young people may (perhaps) overestimate Dr. Bonner, because they will remember all their lives the excitement with which they read this book. It is especially recommended to Indian readers because it gives some glimpse of the bhakti which is insepar able from this sort of biological research in the West, and is so sadly rare in this country.
