<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nuruddin Farah is a writerfrom Somali. We came into correspondence after the publication of his first novel in London From a Crooked Rib. Since then he has continued to write in many styles-poems, a play, a new novel to be called A Naked Needle from the Arabic proverb "The needle that stitches the clothes of people remains naked itself." He continues to experiment with "mind tricks" and wrote this short story for African Arts. "I hope you like it," he wrote "because if you don't like it, I'll be disappointed as I re-touched on it keeping your magazine in mind." "Of Silence, of Noise" is an extraordinary piece of work. Resisting the temptation to attempt even minimal editing, we have allowed its curious and casually idiomatic style to stand as the writer intended it, with its evocative and unexpected vocabulary: the woman "niddle- noddled her head"; the man "beat my heels on the floor like an angry cow." There is a paradoxical mixture of artifice and colloquial simplicity in this language. He writes, "Truth is strange and bitter." This dictum becomes the motive for his haunting and confident narrative. NURUDDIN FARAH PW e found each other convenient, my wife and I, and that was why we got married. My and her parents were very happy about the arrangement, and somehow it appeared to them that they had foreseen the "blessings" of an event. Two years ago today, she and I met, looked at each other, weighed each other in the texture of a tempo of a given temperament, and without saying a word to each other, each agreed that the other would do. And the excitement of an official introduction by a mutual friend with words concocted solely to convey a better impression for each had pre- ceded my call on her. Letters were exchanged, affec- tionate New-Year and Idd-cards, dating followed, and in the space of six months, marriage. During the court- ing period, she spoke ever softly, ever so gently that I was terribly impressed. I was fond of her, no doubt. But a contract of matrimony, God! I hadn't thought it possible. Monday it was, the day of this narrative, Monday, my free day, free from labouring on the plantation, for I was the manager of a large banana plantation in the vicinity of Merca. The plantation was in the possession of a handful of rogues, members of the Dissolved National Assembly, and the pay wasn't bad at all. My wife and I resided in Mogadiscio and from and to Merca I commuted daily by busses or in my Fiat 600. Merca, she said, she wouldn't live in Merca, for Merca, she said, was very unexciting and small, only one and a half a kilometre of a town; Merca, a town on a desert in the sown, a town that provided an outing for the resi- dents of Mogadiscio, she had said, a town of a port of import-export importance to the nation, and she had laughed. We fought on this. She won with her tears and God's wears. So we rented a villa in Mogadiscio. However, things being what they were, and being in a virtually Muslim-controlled state, one would have thought that Friday would be my off-day, but like the barbers, my day was Monday. The only reason why they wished that I remained on the plantation on Fridays was that they came round with their friends for a short visit, for a show-down with their foreign businessmen whom they had invited to lunch and what have you. A clause in the unwritten contract between myself and the Co-operative affirmed that I stayed at the farm on Fridays, that I entertained the guests of my bosses, and that I showed them places of interest in and around Merca. Only God knows how boring it was to answer the same questions once-weekly. I had my nightmares on Thursdays, and, for the large part, I just couldn't have a wink of sleep. Besides, my wife's comment "This is a whole-sale sell-out of body, liberty and soul" haunted me. I had scooted into town early this morning and having had a hard time with several share-holders, I decided I would return home, in spite of my fore- knowledge that I would not find a peace of mind there as well. Maybe it was for lack of something better to do, and I needed, I thought, to take a refuge in the bosom of a beloved person. But as soon as I came into our compound and parked my car in the garage, my wife took on me. And I wished I could bury myself in the bed covers like a kid of six in order to peacefully cry to the heavens for comfort. Yes! She and I had had an argument before I scooted to town. We had had this bickering, this argument, our normal everyday argu- ment, my wife and I, our unnecessarily elaborated-on argument that is bound to arise from the marriage of a couple who cannot... Pardon, Patron!, this later! Our maid-servant had gone to town to get the grocery, and the house was terrifyingly empty, so empty and hol- low, it reminded me of unmusicated bamboos on the periphery of a swamp in Gelib. And since my wife and I had had this bickering over, what I could call, an insignificant issue, there was this horrifying silence also. This type of sordid silence ruins my spirit, deadens my liveliness and spoils my mood. I must admit that I am moody, very moody, indeed. I am happy about one thing this moment and I may be un- 14</page><page sequence="2">happy about the same thing the very next instant. This is the routine of my existence, a part of my nature, in short, the residue of a life's uncertainty. Silence, as a rule, kills me more than anything else I know of. I dread it more than I dread death. I fear it more than I fear the Almighty. It sounds strange, but this is the truth, and truth is strange and bitter. My wife's and my argument dwelt upon God and His creations. It revolved around Him that creates, Him that gives and Him that takes. The accusation my wife levelled against Him was that He alone was responsible for our inability to proginate. She found God very unkind in that He blesses unjustly the down- trodden poor with babies, while we, who can care for children more constructively, as she put it, were offered none. To the suggestion that we adopted one or two on our own, from the street-corners of Merca or Mogadiscio, from the down-trodden people who couldn't afford to sustain their off-springs splendidly, she would vehemently protest. After a while, she would turn on me. She would alternately blame God and me for absence of human produce. And so... As I entered the house, and before I had had time to adjust myself to the heat inside the rooms and the darkness and the mosquitoes that buzzed in the nooks of the rooms and the stench and the disarranged double bed (we had made an unprecedented love the night before, in several positions, with the accompaniment of religious recitations, a last attempt, as it were, to extract from our unified juices the miracles of pro- geny!); before I had had time to distinguish the sounds my foot made from that of water dripping into the drops already in the sink in the kitchenette, before I had got accustomed to the weeping silence surround- ing me, I heard my wife cursing, calling someone names, speaking in the third person, condemning a certain "he", and she bellowed as if she were on a battle-field near Lorengo Marques, as if she were facing the biggest enemy of Portugal's inhumanity. Perturbed, I looked around me and I sighted nobody. Then she looked at me, my wife just looked at me, she looked at me, down at me, if I may say, she looked at me right in the face, downed me with her stare which was full of hate, and as though she would scratch my eyes out of their bone shells, she moved towards me, steps as sure as a donkey's, and she approached a little more. A little nearer and I though she wished to in- timidate me. She continued cursing in a language of langour and anguish that I didn't understand in the least, and then she shouted and screamed as if it were her final breath. Silence followed this. It had become part of me, I mean this patience with my wife. I let her have her way, and I let her have the upper hand when the issue at hand is about issues of our own. I had got used to her moods, and she to mine. But I don't like people who shout at, into my face, or even into my ears, for that is the worst. One breaks the chastity of one's ear-drums, and the ears, helpless that they are, cry and bleed. Whatever the case is (for the world is all that which is not the case: Barth's!), I don't like anyone to shout at me for whatever reason; I would prefer being hit in the jaw, etcetera. "What's the matter now," I asked, undoing the buttons of my shirt. There was a special emphasis on the word "now". "Nothing," she replied, choking with hatred. She then marched away. I followed her. I followed her into the kitchenette, in which she didn't stop for long. She walked out of the kitchenette. I walked after her, following her, with my shirt hanging on my shoulders, one sleeve nearly undone. Again she walked out onto the outside yard, which was between the main living quarters and the toilet. And as though she were intent upon solving the mystery of humanity, she murmured something to herself, something that was, to me, inaudible, she niddle-noddled her head, and without showing the least impression of having noticed my presence, walked in a hurry past me, and brushed me aside. I turned around to follow her. She turned around to face me. And for a second or so, we faced each other. Her eyes went, so to speak, looked beyond me rather twitteringly and unsteadily. She twisted her lips out of mockery. All this time, she kept talking to herself in grumbling whispers. Then she flew past me, wings and all, into the toilet. I hesitated: should I or shouldn't I? A few seconds of indecision, and I did. "Get out of here," she yelled, trying to bolt the door. "I won't," I responded, my foot planted on the floor to frustrate her intentions of bolting the door. She gave way. "Get out, I said," she repeated in the same tone. It's too small for both of us. We cannot fit in here, the two of us. Just get out." I readjusted my shirt and said: "I won't, until you speak some sense and be humane again, I won't, I say, my dear little wife, until you offer a prospect of betterness in your behaviour hereafter- wards. You are neurotic!" That must have annoyed her, for she said: "I didn't come in here to listen to your commands from the lower circles of your indignity. You cannot... y'know... but I could... y'know... given the possibility to... er... produce an issue... to... er... propagate. The right proportion of stamina, the right strength of sperm, the right amount and tic of a man's anomaly to a woman of his own... you don't have that. I could... y'know... and I have every right... y'know... to... er... Agh! What a mess! Che maladizione! Him and I, where and when we meet face to face to compare notes, when He is no more in hiding, there will be much dust in the offing, I assure you." I was furious. I readied to slap her to keep her quiet. My hand went up, my lips trembled to say the un- sayable. "I came in here, I came into the toilet to...," she said and halted. "I know," I said. I lowered my hand and my head. With shame, I beat my heels on the floor like an angry cow. I chewed the cud of my misery. "Listen, I came in here to...," she trailed off again. "I know," I repeated. "What do you know?" "That you want to...!" "To what? To do what?" I looked at her. She had her dress by the corners and her legs showed, and I was afraid she might con- tinue yelling, hollering and roaring and at the same Continued on page 57 15</page><page sequence="3">stylistic variation when he suggests that Bijago tradi- tional statuary became increasingly less abstract in time, progressing from the conical style to the detailed, seated figure.11 It is equally possible, however, that currently observed stylistic differences are the result of other factors. The relationship between style and function in Bijago statuary is not entirely clear; however, some agreement as to function seems evident with regard to at least two styles. In 1930-1931, Bernatzik referred to the statues he saw as either "fetiches" or as "figures representing the souls of deceased persons". The "fetiches" he also defined in the Bijago dialect of certain islands: Rande-Bubaque, Erandi-Caraxa, and Ramdi-Orango Grande. In 1946, Santos Lima referred to the statues as Iras and as Orrebuco images. He did not make a functional distinction between the two, although in one passage he described an Ira as a repository for the soul of an ancestor, and Orrebuco- Ocoto as the Supreme Being. Portuguese ethnographers now assign the following nomenclature to traditional Bijago statuary: (1) Eraminde': A divinity symbolizing indeterminate spirits which are tied to divinatory practices and fetichistic medicine. These sculptures preside prin- cipally at ceremonies destined to understand the cause of misfortune12; (2) Eraminho: Figures which incarnate the spirits of deceased family members.13 Bernatzik's references to Erandi, Rande, and Ramdi (fetiches) were to the statues now called Eraminde'.4 His figures "representing the souls of deceased ones" were Eraminh6s. Santos Lima's Orrebuco images are probably Eramindes, and his Iras the Eraminhos. In terms of the relationship between form and function, it seems clear that the conical style described above (Fig. 8), is that of the Eraminh6.15'16 It is probable, also, that the style resembling a bust mounted on an hourglass-shaped base is also that of the Eraminho.17,18 But what of the seated figures, the naturalistic head mounted on a cylindrical base (Fig. 1), or the standing figures? The figures representing a naturalistic head mounted on a cylindrical base is referred to by one professor as an Unika.19 Quintino indicates that no precise data are available on the function of this piece, nor the Unika divinity itself.20 Bernatzik describes the seated figures as being "repositories for the souls of deceased ancestors", but of a later date than the more abstract Eraminhos.21 He also shows a photo- graph of several statues representing both the seated style and the "bust mounted on an hourglass base" style, resting together in a villager's hut. He refers to all the statues in the photograph as receptacles for the souls of deceased ancestors.22 However, in at least one other photograph, a figure referred to as a "fetiche" (Eraminde) is a seated anthropomorphic figure.23 To date, there are no observations to suggest that by virtue of its form, the seated figure is necessarily an Eraminde or an Eraminho or something else. Thus, questions of form, meaning, function, and most of all the context within which traditional Bijago statuary came to be, are still, for the most part, without answers. Perhaps other investigators will one day tell us more. [ Notes, page 88 Of Silence, Of Noise Continuedfrom page 15 time undress herself. But what would I do in that case? I asked myself. I hate shouting, I thought. I hate silence as well. My wife always shouts or is silent, as if per- manently. I think I don't dislike my wife, a part of her demeanour at least, and I think I like the incommuni- cable quietness of a cold night in summer. But my wife's shouting hysteria about my, only my, inability to create with the right amount of water-matter, with the right proportion of wasted-yeast, and the night's silence's allure to woo the hairy wound of my wife's: that I couldn't look forward to with any feeling other than horror. Now I was halfway into the toilet. It was suffocating what with the small space provided for the bowel's braying, the heat, the noise that had preceded the sickening silence. I knew that something had gone awry inside of me. And I thought about child-delivery; about the drooling cry of a mother in labour, which is tempered with a pin-drop silence of all senses during and after pull-out of manufacture, and the manufac- ture's commencing to cry into the world immediately thereafter. The beauty, the lack of this exchange of moods of mother, manufacture and manufacturer and the latter's anxiety walking up and down the corridors of a dirty go-down. I couldn't my wife had observed, my God! There was a blank silence. seati n.y.c./212 362-0669/by appointment 57</page><page sequence="4">I couldn't control myself. I couldn't bear this sordid, ugly and inexplicable silence. I thought I must say something to keep life going. Otherwise, I thought, silence might overwhelm the whole atmosphere and death might creep in. For isn't silence synonymous with death, the first sign of death being the party who dies? "Say something," I said. Nothing doing. She stood statue-like, serenely silent. "Say something, something, anything. Call me anything, call me names, any name you wish to call me. But speak. And say it from your soul, the soul that ebbs within you. Come on, bitch, COME ON BITCH, SAY SOMETHING IN THE NAME OF CHRIST AND MOHAMED. SAY SOMETHING, DAMN YOU!" I moved in her direction. She retreated misken-like. "Not from your lips," I tried to mesmerise her. "FROM YOUR HEART, DAMN YOU!" She bit her lower lip, and kept silent, her dress slightly up. And I moved no more towards her. In- stead, I ogled at the birth-mark on her left thigh. The doom of desire descended on me, and it dawned upon me, and I thought... nothing, I thought nothing. "Please say something," I said. She wouldn't open her mouth. To kill the quietness, I pulled down the flush, and for a few moments, the noise of the running water was soothing. After a while, I looked at her. She beckoned to me to leave her alone. Silence still. I hit the door to 12. HEAD OF A GIRIAMA GRAVEPOST bring this silence to an end. It only made a noise that I dreadedjust as much. And she beckoned to me afresh. No noise this time, no silence either. Something be- tween the two. A low murmur of voice, her voice. A beckoning, a talking beckoning. A sign by hand and head. A promise in a compromise, all in all. A move- ment of her lips and then mine in unison. And a slow pulling-up of her dress. The pulling-up made a divine friction: a communion between the God-made and the man-made. This was followed by a hushing silence. And death of voices in the Growth of Misgivings in my heart. And I walked out of the toilet. I rocked out into the outside world. The virgin wind that was warm blew against my cold cheeks. My wife began working mir- acles in the toilet. Doop, doop, doop! was all I could hear, wishing that I had more than two ears. And like the noise, the snorting noise we make when we come out of our mother's wombs, and the silence we enter into when we die and we are put in the tombs, I walked into silence in front of me and noise from be- hind me. And I realised the reality: that I had become the living corpse of a compromise in a promise of my wife's. The heavy weight of my heaving soul saddened me no more. I resolved on the strength of the prece- dents and I reached, I drew a certain conclusion. My pendulum of a heart panicked hearing the resound of a recommendation from my lips to my whole system. What materialised out of this my mind's decision is another story in the making. D Traditional Sculpture In Kenya Continuedfrom page 20 These resemble the very simple peglike dolls carved by Giriama mothers for their children. Such dolls are also sometimes carried on the backs of young women who have not yet been able to conceive. The Duruma carve the only wooden masks which are made in Kenya. The only ones which have so far found their way into the National Museum collections are two donated by Mrs. Adamson which are said to have been worn by men mimicking slave catchers. One masker, dressed as a man, wore a mask of square- jawed masculine mein with a beard to emphasize its masculinity (Fig. 8), and was out to trick men into slavery. The other masker, disguised as a woman and wearing a mask intended to be that of a woman, (Fig. 11) was apparently thereby hoping to deceive women and so catch them as slaves.5 The Duruma also use leather masks. The one illustrated here (Fig. 7) was worn by a medicine man who specialised in curing snake bite.6 Such leather masks are not peculiar to the coastal Bantu. They are also found among certain tribes of the Interlacustrine Bantu in western Kenya, notably the Samia of the Abaluyia group, and the Kuria or Watende. Generally such masks tend to be crude flat pieces of leather (Fig. 4) with teeth, feathers, or often lucky bean (abrus precatorius) seeds stuck on with hardened honey. Occasionally they are made more carefully with attempts at showing expression (Figs. 9 and 10). They bear quite a close resemblance to masks I have seen among the Konso of Southwestern Ethiopia.
