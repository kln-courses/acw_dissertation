On the walls were seven gold- leafed monochromes, measuring the height of a man and asymmetrically arranged: four on the right-hand wall, one on the far wall, two on the wall at the left. Within the room stood two cases, or rather, glass caskets-one displaced to a position near the left-hand wall, the other right in the middle. The first contained the pathetic implements of a transient or bum, these arranged in a vaguely anthropomorphic manner: a backpack serving as "head," two bronze canes, one rolled in felt, doubling as "arms," two rolls of fat and a roll of copper bound with twine standing for "chest," and a slab of lard for "legs." Alongside this dismembered body ran a bronze crutch to which were attached two large electrical clamps.

Two cymbals (used in the performance Titus /Iphigenia) stood in at the place where, in the other coffin, the electric clamps with their supporting crutch were located. There lay the artist as tragic monarch, clad in the regalia of his office. The installation was, moreover, titled Palazzo Regale.1 It is as vain to try to choose between the two images of himself the artist has wished to bequeath us as it would be mistaken to think that-as if retracing the career of Beuys -they map a trajectory from the marginality of his beginnings to the triumph of his end. Like the faces of Janus, the two gisants are inseparable. And they are mutually indispensible for understanding what Beuys, throughout his whole life as an artist, wished to incarnate. The ruler and the tramp, the king and his fool, are but one of the bi-cephalic avatars of the artist.

The name of this country- where strollers and dandies cross paths with peddlers and ragpickers; where art students and medical students thumb their noses at philistines; where the sins of the streetwalker are redeemed by the love of a young poet; where humanity is more humane in the brothel than in the church or palace; where the underworld is the true aristocracy, tuberculosis the pardon for syphilis, and talent the only riches-the name of this country that rings with all the cries of injustice and where - radically - the only one denied a visa is the bourgeois, the name of this country is of course bohemia. It is a literary and imaginary country where, in a deformed image at once tragic and ideal, there was dreamed a humanity to replace the real humankind that peopled the Europe of the nineteenth century, and that industrial capitalism had pitilessly set against itself by dividing it into two new antagonistic classes, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Doubtlessly, the real name of bohemia is the lumpenproletariat, or at least, the name of its correlate within the actual world: a no-man's land into which there fell a certain number of people incapable of finding a place within the new social divisions- expropriated farmers, out-of-work craftsmen, penniless aristocrats, country girls forced into prostitution. Dickens and Zola have described this dark fringe of industrialization, these shady interstices of urbanization. But, like Baudelaire, Hugo, and many other novelists who hardly professed naturalism, they poured their inspiration into it, contributing to the fabrication of the image of this marginal, lumpenproletariat society transposed into bohemia, functioning all the more as the figure of a humanity of replacement in that it is a suffering humanity, such that nothing but true human values--liberty, justice, compassion--can survive there, and such that it contains the seeds of a promise of reconciliation. To the denizens of bohemia, to Daumier, Degas, Toulouse-Lautrec, to the 2. Whereas Beuys claimed a forward-looking, emancipatory theory of social sculpture, he often gave his work an archaic, purportedly timeless look. In fact both the theory and the look are dated. Annette Michelson noted that Beuys's fascination with electrical energy refers to both theories of electricity and formal aspects of electrical contraptions that leave off around 1830, "just after Faraday." This precise date is a symptom indeed. See "Joseph Beuys at the Guggenheim," a conversation between Benjamin H. D. Buchloh, Rosalind Krauss, and Annette Michelson, October, no. 12 (Spring 1980).</page><page sequence="6">52 OCTOBER Picasso of the Rose and Blue Periods, to Rouault, and many others, there were presented the faces of Don Quixote and Scapin, of laundresses and opera dancers, of dwarfs and nightclub singers, of saltimbanques and harlequins, the face of Mary Magdalene and that of Christ. It is to this gallery of portraits that Beuys adds his own, it is this gallery that he recapitulates and brings full circle, and which he reconnects - perhaps unwittingly - to its conditions of emer- gence. All these portraits show the artist as bohemian, the incarnation of suffer- ing humanity and of the just man of the future. All are portraits of the artist as a proletarian. The proletarian-a term that transcodes the bohemian as a social type that excludes the bourgeois but includes all the rest of humanity suffering from indus- trial capitalism - is not (or not necessarily) a member of the proletariat, that is, the working class. Of this latter, the myth of bohemia offers a displaced and transposed image; it creates of a transnational reality an imaginary land, a quasi-nation, without real territorial frontiers, since it is peopled with nomads and gypsies, unreal, like Jarry's Poland. The worker himself is rarely an inhabi- tant. The image of bohemia, one could say, is ideological to the extent that it occults the reality that it is precisely charged with transposing: the massive proletarianization of all the men and women who did not belong to the bour- geoisie. But the proletarian is a construction no less ideological - or mythical - of the same personage or social type that the bohemian expresses in the discourse of art and of literature. Simply, it expresses it in the discourse of political economy, that of Marx, and even more specifically, of the young Marx. What, then, is a proletarian for Marx? He is someone-no matter who -who finds himself to have everything to lose from the capitalist regime and everything to gain from its overthrow. Everything to lose-which is to say, his very humanity--and everything to gain - this same humanity. The proletarian is, then, from the origins of industrial capitalism, a figure torn from the future horizon of his own disappearance. He is literally the prototype of the universal man of the future, the anticipated type of the free and autonomous man, of the emancipated man, of the man who will have fully realized his human essence. This essence lies in the two things that define man ontologically, as both a productive being and a social being. He is also a historical being. But as historical changes are only conceivable against the ground of an invariant substrate, they postulate an ontology, and the history of men can be nothing but the growth of productive forces and the progress of the relations of production. For Marx only conceives of man as homofaber: labor - the faculty of producing - is what makes him man, and the consciousness he has of it is the import of his humanity. It transforms the simple biological belonging to the human species into conscious- ness of participating in humankind, and thus makes of all products of labor the privileged place of collective living. This is why the social relation is the essence of the individual as Gattungswesen (species-being), and why as well, in turn, all social relations are, in the last instance, reduced to relations of production. These</page><page sequence="7">Joseph Beuys, or The Last of the Proletarians 53 latter will only be free and autonomous with the advent of the classless and stateless society, the communist society of which the proletariat is the avant- garde. In the meantime the class struggle will be the order, since the proletariat is exploited and alienated by the capitalist regime to which it is subjected, or, to put it another way, since the proletarian, dispossessed of his human essence by social relations of production which admit of nothing but the regime of private prop- erty, still needs to reappropriate it through struggle. Even while already being, in anticipation, the type or prototype of man-in- general, the proletarian suffers under the yoke of capitalism from being ex- ploited and alienated. Exploitation, which consists in the fact that surplus value is extracted from the unpaid labor time that the worker is constrained to offer to the owner of the means of production who employs him, is a damage he sustains, a damage which a regrouping of the working forces - as in unionization - could make amends for or lessen, to a certain degree. But alienation is not a damage that can be made up for; it is a wrong that must be righted.3 It derives from the nature of the transaction between wageworker and employer meeting on the capitalist labor market, as if each were in possession of a ware in which the other is interested, in order to proceed to their exchange. The capitalist offers a sal- ary and the worker his labor power. Now labor power - Arbeitskraft or Arbeitsvermogen--is, par excellence, that which defines or will define man as productive and social being, universal man in his essence. To have to sell his being as if it were a belonging is precisely what alienates homofaber and makes the worker into a proletarian. All languages distinguish the auxiliary verbs to be and to have; these are verbs that do not translate one into the other. But this is what the regime of private property pretends to do where it treats labor power as a commodity, "neither more nor less than sugar," Marx says. Therein rests the irreparable wrong that Marx calls alienation and that only the abolition of private ownership of the means of production could right. To say that the proletarian suffers from a confusion between two auxiliary verbs might seem rather light in view of what the working class has had to endure. Marx is much more concrete: it's his life that the worker alienates in selling his labor power to the capitalist; it's his muscular and cerebral force that he cedes to him; his blood that he spills for him; his skin that he wears out; his flesh that he exhausts. But this loss follows from exploitation; it does not involve a change of essence. After all, the salary that his boss pays him allows the worker to reconstitute his lost energies; it is even exactly calculated for a reproduction of his labor power to make up for the expenditure. It is true that the worker wears himself out, but, like everyone else, he is subjected to the irreversible march of time. It is also true that he gives away more time--labor time, that is, sole 3. For the difference between a damage and a wrong, see Jean-Frangis Lyotard, Le differend, Paris, Editions de Minuit, 1983, pp. 18ff (forthcoming in English translation, Minneapolis, Minnesota University Press).</page><page sequence="8">54 OCTOBER measure of the value of the commodities he produces - than he receives back in the form of wages, but this is precisely because he is exploited. Once again, there is no case for calling that alienation. In fact, the Hegelian concept of alienation disappears from the writings of Marx after the manuscripts of 1844. As for that of labor power, it does not appear before 1865, in Wages, Prices, and Profit. In the first edition of Wage-Labor and Capital, which dates from 1849, it is not his labor power that the wageworker sells to the capitalist, but his labor itself. It is only in the posthumous edition of 1891, amended by Engels (who accounts for it in the preface) to take account of the theoretical advances of Capital, that labor power takes the place of labor. This last conception is hard to support as such -unless one understands that Marx rehabilitates it under the table - without the concept of alienation, at least the ontological and dialectical sense that this concept carries and which remains from one end to the other essential to Marxist thought, lest one see the essential protagonist of the class struggle, the proletarian, vanish like a ghost. The 1849 conception was, moreover, more logical and more exact: the measure of ex- change value being labor, and the measure of labor being time, it is obviously time that the capitalist treats as commodity and "measures with the clock, as he measures sugar with a scale." But once the concept of alienation is abandoned, whether it be his labor or his labor time that the wageworker sells, no wrong is done him. He suffers the injury that is exploitation, but that is reparable. A better distributive justice could render exploitation tolerable, and it is this that has effectively occurred in the Western democracies. To justify the revolution and to write the abolition of capitalism onto the political agenda, it is necessary that the wageworker suffer a wrong that affects him in his human essence. If it is his labor power that he sells, if he is forced to part with the very thing that constitutes him in his humanity, then he suffers this wrong, then he is a proletar- ian and not simply a salaried worker, then this wrong must be righted for him to reappropriate his essence, his labor power. (The word "appropriation" betrays the embarrassment of a Marx caught in the trap of his own thought and forced to treat the essence of homo faber in theory in the same manner as the capitalist treats it in practice.)4 4. The interpretation I have offered of alienation thus conflates two separate moments of Marx's thought in a way that suggests that it is essential for the "romantic" Marx to survive in between the lines of the later, "scientific" Marx, in order to uphold the emancipatory horizon of Marxism. Only if the concept of labor power (i.e., the ability to deliver work at large, what Marx calls "simple, homogeneous, general, and abstract labor") is given the same ontological meaning-defining man in his essence as a species-being- as, in the manuscripts of 1844, the concepts of life-activity, productive life, i.e., species-life, can it be said that: "From the relation of alienated labor to private property it also follows that the emancipation of society from private property, from servitude, takes the political form of the emancipation of the workers, not in the sense that only the latter's emancipation is involved, but because this emancipation includes the emancipation of humanity as a whole" (Karl Marx, Early Writings, trans. and ed. T. B. Bottomore, New York, McGraw Hill, 1964, p. 132).</page><page sequence="9">Joseph Beuys, or The Last of the Proletarians 55 Whether the messianic import was religious, political, or cultural in color- ation, an enormous part of modern art and all its utopias have demanded that the wrong done to the proletariat be righted. In thus insisting that the labor power of man-in-general (the individual as Gattungswesen) be liberated and "dis-alienated," they have focused on the sense in which man has this power in himself, yet remains dispossessed to the extent, precisely, that he can merely have it, whereas it constitutes him, or will constitute him, in his being, in his belonging, at once unique and universal, to humankind. It is to this demand that modern or avant- garde artists (those at least who fully claimed those titles) have testified, by incarnating the proletarian. Obviously what is at stake here has nothing to do with certain ideological alignments by artists with proletarian positions - this existed, but remains the exception -and is not in contradiction with the objective eco- nomic situation of artists, which is more akin to that of a small entrepreneur than to that of a wageworker. But subjectively speaking the modern artist is the proletarian par excellence, because the regime of private property forces him to place on the art market things which will be treated as commodities, but which, in order to have an aesthetic value, must be productions and concretions of his labor power and, if possible, of nothing else. Even the bourgeois conception of art "reifies" the work (via the market) on the one hand and, on the other, judges it (via the aesthetic) for the way that it manifests this faculty of producing value, which, in order to be authentic, must be unique to the artist and must promise value for all, and thus must have its seat in the very nature of the artist as individual human-in-general. Marx calls this universal faculty of producing value labor power; Beuys calls it creativity. Beuys is certainly not the first to give it this name, far from it. He is more like the last to be able to do it with conviction. Beuys's art, his discourse, his attitude, and above all the two faces presented by his persona-the suffering face and the utopian face--constitute the swan song of creativity, the most powerful of the modern myths. Perched on a threshold that he called "the end of modernity," he was in effect its doorman, but the postmodernity onto which he hoped to open the door was as black as his own death. For this tragic and optimistic Janus is above all pathetic; both his faces are turned backward, toward the modernity that he brings to a close. It could not be otherwise, since that which Beuys promised by creativity is what all of artistic modernity never ceased to promise, to hope for, to invoke as the emancipatory horizon of its achieve- ment. "Everyone is an artist." Rimbaud already said it and Novalis already thought it long ago. The students of 1968, in Paris, in California, and gathered around Beuys in Dusseldorf, proclaimed it once again and wrote it on the walls. It always meant, and this since the German romantics: "power to the imagination." It has never become a reality, at least not in that sense. But all that the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have implied for the will to emancipation and the desire for dis-alienation has always meant: everyone is an artist, but the masses don't have the power to actualize this potential because they are oppressed, alienated,</page><page sequence="10">56 OCTOBER and exploited; only those few, whom we stupidly call professional artists, know that in reality their vocation is to incarnate this unactualized potential. Hence the two faces of modernity, of which it is Beuys's pathetic grandeur to have worn both: the public, revolutionary, and pedagogical face, the one that is convinced that an adequate teaching will liberate creativity; and the secret, insane, and rebellious face, the one that claims that creativity is already of this world precisely there where it lies fallow and in waiting, crude and savage: in the art of madmen, children, and primitives. If he had lived in the Germany of Weimar, Beuys could have been at one and the same time Gropius and Beckmann, or perhaps a Klee amended by his teacher Lehmbruck. Joseph Beuys.

Creativity is to the cultural field what labor power is to the field of political economy. The two fields imbricate throughout the course of modernity, and in all possible manners. With Beuys, this is why the translation attempted here is so easy - the two fields precisely overlap -and this is what signals to us that their dialectic is over. For, during the last decade of his life and work, Beuys constructed an actual political economy on which he hoped to found his theory of social sculpture. Its anchor point was, of course, creativity, which is a universal faculty of man, and even the singular one that makes him man. "Der Mensch ist das kreative Wesen," Beuys said, as if echoing Marx. Like labor power, but unlike talent-a notion on which classical aesthetics is based- creativity is the potential of each and every one, and it precedes the division of labor: being the capacity to produce, in general. From this it follows that everyone is an artist and that art is not a profession. All productive activity, whether of goods or of services, can be called art; creativity is the true capital, and the exchange of goods is to the flow of creativity within the social body what the circulatory system is to the flow of vital forces in the individual body. (This is what the Honigpumpe from the 1977 Documenta sym- bolized.)5 In order that this utopia become reality and that creativity be "dis- alienated," goods, money included, must not be commodities. Money, called "production capital," will thus be created from scratch by a central bank (it embodies neither time nor labor power) and distributed democratically. Once placed in the hands of social agents, it would become "consumption capital," a kind of paper money with no value but that of representing a certain purchasing- power, a value that it will lose in the course of the transaction before returning to the central bank and being reinjected into the economic circuit. Beuys intended in this way to neutralize the private ownership of the means of production.6 This utopia is pretty, naive, and hardly original. It has Fourierist and Proudhonnist overtones, and Marx had already denounced something similar proposed by John Gray. It is difficult to see more than an involuntary caricature of numerous broken promises of modernity in it, a slightly grotesque farce with nothing but a 5. Which suggests that, if Beuys's "electricity theory" refers back to Faraday, his "physiology" refers back to Harvey (as does his "medicine" to Paracelsus). But to translate the economic flow of merchandise into the image of the blood circulation is, again, very much a nineteenth-century idea. 6. See Caroline Tisdall, Joseph Beuys, New York, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1979, p. 264. From Tisdall's account, it is not, however, absolutely clear to what extent Beuys is indebted for his political economy to his former student and secretary, Johannes Stdittgen. His own account is best expressed in the "Munich discourse": "CAPITAL is not money (means of production); CAPI- TAL is ability and the product of ability. Here there appear further proofs of the idea that 'Everyone is an Artist,' proofs of the fact that ability really is a lever. Money is not an economic value! . . . That approach will logically develop the social totality, taking as its starting-point the creative human being as the creator of the world, and proceeding from freedom by way of law to new economic laws and a credit system for the public good" (Joseph Beuys, "Talking about One's Own Country: Germany," in In Memoriam Joseph Beuys: Obituaries, Essays, Speeches, Bonn, Inter Nationes, 1986, pp. 50-51).</page><page sequence="12">58 OCTOBER retrospective meaning. The last of the proletarians has tried to right the wrong of his condition, which is that of artists and of everyman, by mapping the hopes and prophecies of the modern cultural field onto the field of political economy, in order to revive them. But he has not seen that if they in fact find a part of their historical truth there, it is in the past tense, in terms of the translations made possible by this mapping, and not in the future tense, in terms of the emancipa- tion it was the proletarian's vocation to promise. There remains the suffering of the proletarian and the pathetic irony that means that if the promise of emancipation should be abandoned, the character of the proletarian would vanish. Beuys, the sculptor, knew how, with pain and humor alike, to work out the contradictions that Beuys, the charlatan economist, pretended with utter seriousness to dissolve. The talented artist didn't do the same thing as the prophet of creativity.

At this level Beuys was coddled: alienated, perhaps, but not exploited.

Useless and used-up, the drums will be treated none- theless as precious objects by the commercial gallery that shows them, wholly aware of their exchange value. But by arranging them as unaesthetically as possible (they don't even make an interesting formal configuration), Beuys suc- ceeds in making their presence incongruous and frustrating. They are different sizes and filled to different levels with scraps of aluminum slag that have been fused together. One of them overflows, and a ladle is attached to the mound of debris. The staging is allegorical, and the allegory is pessimistic: under the conditions of industrial capitalism (the containers), artists' creativity (the con- tents) can only congeal into commodities and become alienated in their exchange value. The artist is supposed to draw from the well of his labor power, but the alchemy that turns it into gold for the dealer leaves him nothing but slag ("coagulated labor-time," Marx would say). In a corner of the room, facing this arrangement, is crammed a large copper bathtub filled to the brim with a solution of sulfuric acid. This is another allegory of the artist, and this time the well is alive. Under the conditions of a renewal (the container: the theme of the bathtub has autobiographical reso- nances of baptism and rebirth within Beuys's work), artists' creativity (the con-</page><page sequence="15">:: :::: :::::-:::- _:::::::::-:::: .:-.. . -::: j:-:i:-::::: :_,:-:-:--::::-::~-:-:::: i:_:-~_,_s-_,-___:-,,-',-- -:c-:_~s:8'a-:"a m,::::- :;:: -.:- ::::: 3-.-:: -___li::l~i::i-:__liiijiij~~iii~i~ii_ ).~i_]~~ii-iii :l::::~t:-:iiiiiili~i~i: -:-------:? :~:-::--a:;:i:.P rei::: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .::: : i: iiiiii-ii ---?:i -i:::-:::- :: --:::::i:l---~i :::i-~ii:i:::-: ::: -:::'-- :::: ::::::' '- ?i-i;i::ii tents: as corrosive as the original contents of the drums was polluting) preserves its subversive potential. But the container is itself contained, the bathtub is not bare but enveloped by a thick layer of terra cotta that seems to protect it and to hide in the depths of its material some strange pouches that the sculptor has modelled as if they were the pockets of a beggar's wallet, or of the artist's famous vest. The dialectic of contained containers (of conditioning conditions) does not stop there, and, even overflowing with corrosive labor power, the bathtub does not escape exchange value. Getting the jump on the dealer, Beuys gouged the price of the work into the still-damp clay: 90.000 DM. Illusion has no foothold. Time gets the last word. Beuys, who understood materials like no one else, knew that, in drying, the clay would contract and would end by cracking. Whether by chance or by design, it happened that one of the fissures has neatly sliced through the price and separated the nine from the zeros, symbolically canceling the monetary value of the work. The bathtub of creativity breaks out of its sheath of reification and the artist strips off his old-man's cloak, ready to bear the novices of a Beuysian utopia to the baptismal font. The ensemble is more ridiculous than sublime and, formally, only semiconvincing. To the left of the bathtub, negli- gently pinned to the wall, a collage of notes and sketches mounted between two sheets of glass pretends to explain the work and, of course, explains nothing.</page><page sequence="16">62 OCTOBER Time always has the last word, in effect, and time cracks the statues and corrodes utopia more surely than sulfuric acid. Creativity has nothing subversive left; that myth is dated. Raum 90.000 DM subscribes to it, but also exposes its extreme vulnerability, witness to the hope of the proletarian but attesting as well the comic aspect of this character. With Beuys gone, and the concretions of his talent (and not of his creativity) more than ever fetishized by a necrophilic art market, time will decide if his sculpture should survive the ruin of social sculpture, this modern Kunstwollen that he ignited one last time. In counterpoint to Joseph Beuys, one is tempted to place Andy Warhol, to oppose to the vitalism and populism of the former, the morbidezza and worldli- ness of the latter. In the art of the past twenty years, only Warhol equals Beuys in legend-value--that is, media-value--and the shadow of both of them hovers equally over the art of the younger generation. But Beuys is a hero and Warhol is a star. The first had to immolate himself on a stage dating from the Comedie humaine, and his aesthetic is theatrical, confusing art and life in the same authen- ticity. He lived and died, a perfectly cast character of bohemia. The second died as though by mistake, after having survived, as though by necessity, an assassina- tion attempt, made useless by the fact that all the front pages were already taken up, on that day, by the real assassination of Robert Kennedy. His life and his art were projections of the same life-style, and his aesthetic is that of the simulacrum. Beuys's art demands a myth of origin and a historical telos, that of Warhol the fiction of the eternal return and the steady state of posthistory. For one, capital- ism remained the cultural horizon to leave behind; for the other, it was simply nature. Beuys, like Marx a bourgeois German, wanted to incarnate the proletar- ian; Warhol, an American immigrant of working-class origins, wanted to be a machine. At the center of all these oppositions is the fact that Beuys based art on will and thus on a principle of production, and Warhol on desire and thus on a principle of consumption; that Beuys believed in creativity and Warhol did not; and that for Beuys art was labor while for Warhol it was commerce. Nevertheless, labor and commerce have this in common: the domain of these notions is that of political economy. Indeed political economy is divided up by these concepts that, beyond this field, also divide up the anthropological one: either labor or ex- change is primary and defines the social essence of man. Either history or structure. The opposition not only opposes Marxist to liberal economics; it traverses all the human sciences and colors them with economism. That art is available to be decoded by means of political economy does not mean that it is absorbed into it. That, with Beuys and Warhol, art is decoded so obviously by political economy would mean instead that the time has come to decode the code rather than to decode messages by means of it, and that economic values--and the very notion of value -are nothing but a dated translation, neither the most natural nor the most fruitful, of what we must continue to call, lacking a better term, aesthetic judgment.</page></plain_text>
