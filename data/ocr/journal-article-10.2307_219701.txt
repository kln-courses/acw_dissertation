Andrew Porter's study of Donald Currie opens up the prospect that more research will be done dealing with the role and influence of the financier not only in colonial ventures but in British society as well. As a reader one would have liked to know Currie more intimately, but businessmen and financiers in the nineteenth century frequently were not prone to self-reflection, making them difficult psychological studies. Currie's contemporaries and frequent competitors, Edmund Davis and the German Julius Scharlach, are not easy men to understand or study, but the effort, as in the case of Currie, would yield new insights into the world of late-nineteenth-century finance and society. The book concludes with an impressive bibliography that indicates the thoroughness of the author's research into his subject. RICHARD A. VOELTZ Utah State University Uintah Basin THE ARTS OF ZAIRE, VOLUME II, EASTERN ZAIRE. By Daniel Biebuyck. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1986. Pp. xiii, 314. $55.00. The contribution this book makes to historical studies of Eastern Zaire is greater than is indicated by the title. Among the Lega, who form the chief subject of this volume, visual and verbal arts are integral to the higher levels of the Bwami association. Bwami is a hierarchical society of men and a few elite women, access to which is gained by elaborate secret initiation rites accompanied by distribution of gifts. Detailed knowledge of its structure and ritual organization enables the author to recognize historically significant traces of Bwami in surrounding or more distant regional groups (pp. 210-259). Especially if these similar graded societies employ Lega-like objects in their ceremonies, the likelihood of historical links is enhanced. To this end Biebuyck discusses the social structure and arts of numerous other, ethnically composite groups in both forested and savannah areas lying south of Kisangani on both sides of the Lwalaba River and south and eastward of Legaland. These include the Bembe, Nyanga, Mbole, Mitoko, Lengola, and twelve other less familiar groups. In addition to tracing historical links through similar institutions and art forms, Biebuyck summarizes oral accounts of their origins and migrations, using his own and others' recent research and, in the appendix, provides remarkably detailed charts of the descent histories of major Lega groups, and of the spread of kindi, the highest grade of Bwami, from the Babongolo among the southern Lega to the northern and western Lega. However, Biebuyck postulates that the basic structure and organization of Bwami antedate the emergence of the Lega as a distinct people. Some of the material on the Bwami and its visual and verbal arts was presented in Biebuyck's Lega Culture: Art, Initiation, and Moral Philosophy among a Central African People (Berkeley, 1973), which is a recommended background for</page><page sequence="2">516 BOOK REVIEWS this volume. (For example, it offers general information on Lega society, and on informants and conditions of research.) This Arts volume focuses on an extremely valuable, detailed examination of Lega sculpture, going over many kinds of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines, masks, and various objects of wood, ivory or, less often, other materials. Biebuyck discerns the kind of formal categories that we like to find - that is, according to size, materials and shape (for example, flat-faced figures or round headed ones) - but he organizes the topics for discussion according to indigenous classifications. Based on his own observation and research with Lega informants in the 1950s, he gives excellent accounts of ownership, acquisition and transfer of objects, on modes and contexts of presentation within the two higher level rites of Bwami, and he is able to identify many figurines and interpret the aphorisms that accompany them. This voluminous information is history, the history of those regional Bwami ceremonies in the 1949-1959 decade. As for the meaning of the arts and their initiation context, Biebuyck favors a strongly positive functional view. They stand for the unity and interdependence of Bwami members and their solidarity with their predecessors, for harmony within marriage and within kin groups, and for proper behavior which emphasizes the faithfulness of wives, restraint of violence, and gift-giving. This perspective also informs his interpretation of particular features of the sculpture. For example, after noting that figurines illustrating morally depraved persons tend to deemphasize ideal features and overemphasize undesirable physical aspects, he cautions that it would be erroneous to think that sculptors were inspired only by codes of beauty and ugliness, the strong emphasis in the sculpture on the large head and massive legs and feet seems to him directly related to philosophical ideas cherished by the initiates: they are thinkers and they are elephants - that is, solid and powerful (p. 64). Especially valuable, in view of stereotypes about African figural sculpture, is Biebuyck's emphasis that the masks and figurines are not representations of divinities, ancestors or spirits, nor are they devices through which undefined powers are harnessed for divining, healing, inflicting harm, oath-taking or cursing. The messages conveyed relate to concepts about good and bad people in a didactic and moralizing context (p. 263). In Biebuyck's objective manner of reporting his conclusions, one almost misses the power of certain of his insights (pp. 266-267), such as linking the elaborate display and exegesis of Bwami sculptures to the didactic procedures and images in puberty rites for girls and boys situated in southern Zaire, Zambia and Tanzania: or that, in societies of Eastern Zaire with statelike systems, such institutions as initiation, enthronement, and burial rites for chiefs exhibit striking similarities to their counterparts for high-ranking members of voluntary associations such as Bwami. In the end he presents his vision of past cultural development in Eastern Zaire by looking not simply to local diffusion of traits but to common ancestral institutions introduced by Lega or Lega-related populations and modified by preestablished hunters.
