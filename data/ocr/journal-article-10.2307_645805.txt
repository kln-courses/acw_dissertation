The possi- bility of comparative insight is marred here by the evaluative prominence given to authenticity (about objects) and appropriateness (about contexts). In his valuable and well-wrought concluding es- say on "the production of locality," Arjun Ap- padurai notes that "much of the ethnographic re- cord can be rewritten, and reread, from this point of view" (p. 205), namely, with attention to the many ways in which the production of locality has been a long-standing human project. This retrospection dovetails with the ethnographic concerns of the es- says that precede Appadurai's. If culture and knowledge are at stake in the apparently contempo- rary trend toward globalization, how then to do an- thropology, if at all? The contributors go a long way in answering such questions. And if Fardon concludes his intro- duction by presenting the possibility that the "sub- version [of 'culture'] may be timely" (p. 18), the fol- lowing contributors take a diversity of positions. This is a collection of first order, showing us by ex- ample how anthropology can make an ethno- graphic contribution to the ubiquitous interest in lo- cal and global relations. Things as They Are: New Directions in Pheno- menological Anthropology. MICHAEL JACK- SON, ed. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1996. x + 287 pp., notes, references, contributors. BRAD WEISS College of William and Mary In his preface to this anthology of 11 ethno- graphic chapters and a lengthy introduction, Mi- chael Jackson indicates that phenomenology has had a rather diffuse influence on anthropology, pro- viding, as he puts it, "a repertoire of developing ideas" (p. vii). Yet no consistent and definitive phe- nomenological perspective has emerged, and none is offered here: "No consensus is reached, or reached for" (p. vii). As one might imagine, such willful eclecticism is both a strength and a weak- ness of the collection as a whole. Insights into the particulars of lived experience abound at every turn in these essays, but there is little overall coherence to the volume, and it is often difficult to see the broad potential that a phenomenological perspec- tive affords anthropology. In his wide-ranging introduction Jackson at- tempts (among other intentions) to show the rele- vance of phenomenology for some of the most con- temporary anthropological concerns. He traces a diverse genealogy of phenomenology, articulating the positions of American pragmatists Dewey and James with those of Dilthey, Husserl, and Merleau- Ponty. In weaving these connections Jackson fo- cuses on the central themes of phenomenology that have been especially relevant for anthropology: Husserl's epoche (or "bracketing") of the ontologi- cal status of ideas, the lifeworld, subjectivity and in- tersubjectivity, embodiment, practice, and habitus. Jackson further suggests that recent interests in subalternity and poetics take their cue from pheno- menological interests in ordinary experience, and an insistence on a subject-centered approach to so- cial forms. As valuable and eloquent as Jackson's survey is, his avowedly "anti-intellectual" (in the Jamesian sense) and antistructuralist position occa- sionally entails his granting greater emphasis to the subjective experience of the world than he does to the ineluctable grounding of being-in-the-world. In- tersubjectivity, in this view, is more often shared in common than weighted with inequalities, and the objects of experience appear as immediate exten- sions of the subject rather than as conditions with which subjectivity must grapple. To cite a brief but telling example: in his discussion of Marx (p. 28), Jackson emphasizes the anthropomorphic nature of the objects generated by the laboring body but never addresses the alienating effects of this labor process that were of especial interest to Marx. Nev- ertheless, while these are important concerns and many phenomenologists have struggled with the "givenness" of existence, Jackson's essay certainly provides an illuminating and stimulating overview. The promise of Jackson's intriguing introduction is not always fully realized in the ethnographic es- says. These contributions, arranged alphabetically by author, consist of a discussion of two worlds faced by educated Bedouin women upon marriage (Abu-Lughod); an exploration of the fragmentary nature of "experience" for residents of a homeless shelter in Boston (Desjarlais); a "praxiological" ap- proach to fertility and life transmission in the former Zaire (Devisch); the articulation of self in the life world as embodied in Umeda accounts of taboo (Gell); a rethinking of longhouse organization that focuses on the perceptual (primarily auditory) di- mensions of Dayak sociality (Helliwell); an ap- proach to the poetics of lamentation, highlighting the potential agency that such performative con- texts may provide a young, dispossessed Cretan woman (Herzfeld); a consideration of the eviscera- tion of suffering by the discourse of both clinical psychiatry and medical anthropology, grounded in the traumatic experiences of those who endured China's cultural revolution (A. and J. Kleinman); an exploration of bodiliness as revealed in the efforts of an American graduate student learning how to hand-drum (Lindsey); a discussion of the intersub- jective character of suffering and dying among Iqwaye (New Guinea) in the grip of habitual and prolonged sickness (Mimica); a rumination on the practical and ambiguous cultivation of empathic friendship between fieldworker and host in alpine Italy (Ridler); and a simultaneously ironic and ro- mantic disquisition on virtual ethnography organ- ized by aesthetic criteria of fracture, juxtaposition, and iconoclasm as tangibly embodied by anthro- pologists-as-lovers (Wafer). Part of the volume's evident lack of integrity stems from the fact that 7 of the 11 chapters have been published previously, and many of these do not really speak directly to the issues raised by Jack- son. In fact, in some cases I would argue that the authors' claims run counter to those that Jackson characterizes as phenomenological. Abu-Lughod, for example, insists that educated Bedouins lead a double life, thereby asserting precisely the kind of 504 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="2">contrast (between "Egyptian" and "Bedouin") that a "bracketing" would suspend in its consideration of a lifeworld. Indeed, it is difficult to see the pheno- menological import of this chapter, unless we make all description that eschews systematicity equivalent to phenomenology. In his altogether intriguing essay Desjarlais, moreover, poses a subtle critique of the way in which Jackson describes experience in claiming that modes of being-in-the-world may be emerging in which authentic, integrated experience is not relevant or possible. These observations are not meant as criticisms of one perspective or the other but simply to point out that some readers may be struck by the contradictory character of the book as a whole. Of course, some may find such inconsistency ap- pealing. Those who are drawn to the possibilities of a phenomenologically informed anthropology will in any case find much of use here. Gell's chapter is an absolute treasure: a model of how an ethno- graphic insistence on cultural specificities can be wedded to the formulation of intersubjectivity. Hel- liwell's essay is extraordinarily insightful and lucid and clearly demonstrates how phenomenology can contribute to an understanding of such age-old an- thropological concerns as kinship and social or- ganization. A few of the essays, in particular Her- zfeld's and Desjarlais's, also indicate the potential that phenomenology has for elucidating the ways in which profound structural inequalities are forcefully realized in lifeworlds. I was disappointed, however, to see that none of these contributors fully explore processes of objectification or consider linguistic practice (perhaps a consequence of Jackson's, to my mind, problematic insistence, following Ricoeur, that phenomenology addresses "structures of expe- rience which precede connected expression in lan- guage" [p. 2]), as phenomenological discussions of subject-object relations and language are among the most vibrant in anthropology today. In any event, this collection will be of interest to a wide range of anthropologists. Jackson's introduction is a useful and readable resource on this important approach, and those who teach courses on poetics and performance, suffering and affliction, or embodi- ment and practice could readily incorporate a judi- cious selection of these essays into their curricula. Tense Past: Cultural Essays in Trauma and Memory. PAUL ANTZE and MICHAEL LAM- BEK, eds. New York: Routledge, 1996. xxxvii + 266 pp., notes, references, contributors, in- dexes. BRAD WEISS College of William and Mary From monumental museums that are dedicated to global tragedies to television talk shows that so- licit intimate recollections of molestation, memory has captured contemporary imaginations. All the contributors to this always interesting collection of- fer engaging interventions on the burgeoning dis- courses, and practices, of memory. The best of them not only explore this concern but also ask why memory should become the locus around which claims to authority, expertise, personhood, and identity are increasingly contested. As Paul Antze and Michael Lambek put it, this book "is about how the 'very idea of memory' comes into play in society and culture and about the uses of 'memory' in collective and individual practice" (p. xv). A cultural critique challenging the complex apparatuses (juridical, medical, and psy- chiatric) that increasingly constitute discourses of memory is thereby wedded to an ethnographic ex- ploration of multiple uses of remembering (and for- getting) by people who are organizing, consolidat- ing, and unmaking various dimensions of identity. A central theme of the volume concerns the ways in which "the very idea of memory" has become in- creasingly embroiled in accounts of trauma, as "memory worth remembering ... is memory of trauma" (p. xii). This entanglement poses special problems for our understanding of memory, as it has tended to encourage the participation of legal and medical experts, both groups whose members are interested in and authorized to ascertain the "truth" or "falsity" of traumatic memories. In their introduction Antze and Lambek spell out a forceful alternative to such simplistic visions of memory and, instead, insist that memory is best grasped as a form of practice, "not as the pregiven object of our gaze, but as the act of gazing and the objects it gen- erates" (p. xii). The fundamental problem identified here is that the very acts of narrating, invoking, and reimagining a past (acts that are always central to the constitution of identities) may also serve to un- dermine those same identities. A "recovered" mem- ory, for example, may either confirm a sense of enti- tlement or codify one's status as a victim. Practices of remembering and forgetting are therefore de- scribed as morally complex, and it is this moral complexity that lies at the heart of these discussions. The contributors to part 1, "Remembering Trauma, Remaking the Self," explore narratives of traumatic memories. In his essay on multiple personality dis- order (MPD), Antze examines this phenomenon as a cultural idiom for self-articulation. While not dis- missing the discursive construction of MPD as a psychiatric category that can serve as a powerful formulation of the identities of those so diagnosed, Antze suggests that narratives organized around "discoveries" and "flashbacks" may provide the dis- tressed a means by which they are able to "share knowledge about a reality they experience in com- mon" (p. 5). Donna J. Young and Glynis George both address personal narratives of remembered abuse offered by women in eastern Canada. Both of these authors add a crucial collective context to these narratives, linking the traumas they discuss to the social and economic oppression that pervades the communities in question. At times, however, they suggest that the discourse of "trauma" itself has generated a form of false consciousness that im- pedes the victims of abuse from seeing the "histori- cal realities" (in Young's phrase, p. 42) that underlie personal suffering. Part 2 concerns the medicalization of memory and its political implications. lan Hacking's essay is a detailed and complex archaeology of the sciences of memory. He argues that these sciences have come to replace discourses of the soul as experimental reviews 505</page></plain_text>
