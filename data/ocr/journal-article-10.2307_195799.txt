UNIVERSITY OF DURHAM JANET C. E. WATSON DER NEUARAMAISCHE DIALEKT VON MLAHSO. Semitica Viva Vol. 14. By OTTO JASTROW. Wiesbaden, Harrassowitz, 1994. xiv, 195 pp. Aramaic is still spoken in various parts of the Near East in the form of several different dialects. Most of these neo-Aramaic dialects, however, are on the verge of extinction, on account of political disturbances during this century which have forced large numbers of speakers to leave their original language communities. The majority of the dialects have not been written down in any literary form. Linguistic description of these spoken dialects is urgently needed to maintain a record of them before their total disappearance. The publication of this volume by Otto Jastrow is, therefore, most welcome. The neo-Aramaic dialect that is the subject of this book was spoken by the Christian population of a village in the Diyarbakir province of southern Turkey. The name of the village as used by the Aramaic speakers was Mlahs6 (apparently derived from earlier Aramaic malahta 'salt marsh'). The Kurdish form of its name was Mele. Its official Turkish name is now Yiinliice. The Christian community was virtually completely destroyed in massacres during World War I. The description of the dialect is based on material gathered by Jastrow from informants in 1968-69. These informants belonged to Christian families that originated in Mlahs6. None of the informants were resident in Mlahso itself. Their families had emigrated to the neighbouring village of 'Ansa, in some cases more than a generation ago. Most had ceased to use the Aramaic dialect as a vernacular for many years. The main informant, however, had spoken the dialect in his home, although he had left Turkey and had settled in Syria. Fieldwork with such informants has many difficulties. In the introduction to the volume Jastrow describes how he had to undertake long journeys in Syria and Lebanon to fix a meeting with his main informant. When the informant was finally tracked down it was not possible to work with him for more than a brief period. Twenty years later, in 1989, Jastrow was able to meet with this informant again. This man, one of the last surviving speakers of the dialect, was by now, however, almost totally deaf and unable to articulate clearly. This book, therefore, has captured the final phases of a dialect, which now, it seems, has disappeared. The relatively small corpus of material has not permitted the author to make a maximal description of the dialect. The book, nevertheless, presents all the main details of the dialect's phonology and morphology and is a remarkable example of what can be extracted from such a corpus by a skilled linguist. In addition to the description of the grammar, the book contains a transcription of the spoken texts recorded from the informants. These include reminiscences concerning the history of the villages of Mlahso and 'Ansa and traditional folk tales. All lexical items that occur in the texts and also those that were collected from the informants separately are presented in a glossary. The entries of the glossary include an indication of the etymological background of the words, either in Classical Syriac or in one of the languages from which the word was borrowed (Kurdish, Turkish, Arabic). The dialect of Mlahso is closely related to Turoyo, the dialect of the Christian 299</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS: GENERAL community of Tur 'Abdin, which is still widely spoken and has been well described by scholars, including Jastrow himself. There are, however, important differences and these are pointed out in comparisons between the two dialects at various places in the grammatical description. In some respects the Mlahso dialect represents an older stage of development than Turoyo. This is particularly clear in the vocabulary, where a larger range of originally Aramaic words have been preserved in the Mlahso dialect, and also in certain features of phonology. Many of the differences in grammatical features represent independent developments in the two dialects. Of particular interest is the development of the verbal forms qtile and qatil. In Turoyo the first expresses the preterite of transitive verbs and the second the preterite of intransitive verbs. In Mlahs6 the two forms express different tenses without any distinction due to the transitivity of the verb. The first is the preterite form, whereas the second expresses the present perfect tense. Overall, however, the Mlahs6 dialect is much closer to Turoyo than any other known dialect and the two should now be grouped together in the classification of neo- Aramaic. UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE GEOFFREY KHAN ANTHROPOMORPHISM AND INTERPRETATION OF THE QUR'AN IN THE THEOLOGY OF AL-QASIM IBN IBRAHIM, KITAB AL-MUSTARSHID. Edited by BINYAMIN ABRAHAMOV (Islamic Philosophy Theology and Science, Texts and Studies, Vol. 26). Leiden, E. J. Brill, 1996. xvii, 154 pp. Index. The ZaydT Imam al-Qasim ibn Ibrahim al-Hasani al-Rassi, who died in 246/860, is one of the earliest Muslim theologians whose works have survived in any quantity. He was a contemporary of the great Mu tazill scholars of the early Abbasid era, and is credited with introducing many of their ideas and methods into Zaydi theological thought. Most of al-Qasim's works are relatively brief. But they are tremendously valuable both for the insights they afford into the development of Muslim theological thinking in one of its most vigorous phases, and for the glimpses they preserve of an agile mind engaged in the task of discovering and expounding the truth about God. Al-Qasim was concerned to defend God's oneness above everything else, and in his various writings he used impressive arrays of arguments which reveal wide knowledge and surprising sensitivity towards opposing views: the description of the Trinity, for example, in his Radd ala al-Nasara is one of the clearest and closest to patristic models known from an early Muslim author. In the brief work edited here, 'The Epistle of whoever seeks Guidance', al-Qasim maintains the distinctive uniqueness of God against Qur'an teachings which may appear to suggest he resembles other beings. He examines a number of difficult verses, and shows that, when they are given the correct interpretation, they do not contradict the doctrine but rather enforce it. And to sustain his case he employs a number of methods seen also in other authors, including elucidation from other verses (tafsrr al-Qur'an bi- al-Qur'an), reference to the familiar or poetic usage of a word, and appeal to reason. He does not seem to have any single method of interpretation, but proceeding from the premise that the doctrine of tawhTd is unquestionably right, he shapes the meanings of the texts to fit. This approach marks out the Epistle as an exercise in the application of 300</page></plain_text>
