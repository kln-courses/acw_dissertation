<plain_text><page sequence="1">Delivered as a lecture at Hitotsubashi University, Tokyo, in March 2013, on the eve of the second anniversary of "the events," as Royle's host called them, this essay is, in part, about Fukushima. It focuses in a timely/untimely way on Conrad's remarkable story "Typhoon." The essay also connects to various themes raised in the preceding "Quick Fictions" lecture, including in particular the notion of quick fiction. Reading Joseph Conrad: Episodes from the Coast NICHOLAS ROYLE Trailer Who decades makes reads only integral Joseph fleeting Conrad to appearances what today? F. R. Leavis And in the how called pages is he of "the to Harold great be read? Bloom tradition," Having s The his been Western work for decades integral to what F. R. Leavis called "the great tradition," his work makes only fleeting appearances in the pages of Harold Bloom s The Western Canon. The most detailed discussion consists of just a couple of sentences near the beginning. Bloom writes: "The anxiety of influence cripples weaker talents but stim- ulates canonical genius. What intimately allies the three most vibrant American nov- elists of the Chaotic Age - Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and Faulkner - is that all of them emerge from Joseph Conrad s influence but temper it cunningly by mingling Conrad with an American precursor - Mark Twain for Hemingway, Henry James for Fitzgerald, Herman Melville for Faulkner" (11). Whatever we may think of this Bloomian schema, Conrad's role is curiously enigmatic. His influence is enormous, we might infer, and yet it goes underground, it gets mixed up, disappearing behind the smoke screens of "Mark Twain," "Henry James," "Herman Melville." Conrad shows up Mosaic 47/1 0027-1 276-07/04 1028$02.00Â©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">42 Mosaic 47/1 (March 2014) again in the celebrated Appendix to The Western Canony as we would expect, where five of his works are duly listed: Lord Jim , The Secret Agent, Nostromo , Under Western Eyes , and Victory (553). In the course of Bloom's monumental book, however, Conrad's work scarcely figures beyond a few rather disparaging references - to the "obscurantist metaphor" of the notorious Conradian phrase "heart of darkness" (121), to the inferi- ority of Conrad's Nostromo in comparison to Tolstoy's Hadji Murad (338-39), to "the moral element in Conrad [again, specifically, in Heart of Darkness]" (473). One of the things that Bloom has perhaps taught us is to be alert to forms of defensiveness and to be wary of peremptory dismissals, in critics as well as in poets, dramatists, and novelists. The "disappearing" of Conrad from The Western Canon invites further reflection and analysis. Conrad can easily seem an under-read or undervalued author at present. His Heart of Darkness may still be regularly taught, especially in university courses about literature and colonialism, but there is a notable sense of exhaustion. (Must we really be teaching Heart of Darkness again? Hasn't it all been done to death a thousand times?) Bloom lists only novels in his personal hall of fame estimation of Conrad, but what of shorter works, less discussed, dissected, or deliberated over than Heart of Darkness? In the pages ahead I propose to give partic- ular attention to a couple of such works, written about ten years apart: "Typhoon," published in 1902, and "The Secret Sharer," published in 1910. In the course of doing so, I hope to suggest there is indeed - and perhaps more than ever - great pleasure and value to be got from reading Conrad. The peculiarly ghostly role of Conrad in Bloom's account of the canon prompts three hypotheses: (1) The notion of canon and canonicity has, in recent decades, undergone a sort of spectralization. The outline not only of a "great tradition," but also of "alternative" or "minor" traditions, has lost solidity. The case of Conrad intimates, in perhaps exemplary fashion, that ghostliness has emerged as a necessary dimension in thinking about literature and culture. If, as Jacques Derrida suggests in Specters of Marx, the great work or masterpiece "always moves [. . .] in the manner of a ghost" (18), we might reasonably suppose that the "greatness" of Conrad's work has to do with its capacity to function as a valuable resource for exploring the logic and nature of spec- iality itself. In more general ways, however, it might enable us to engage with the spectral nature of nation and nationality, sovereignty and the archive, as well as the uncanny decentering of the human in relation to desire and language, the environ- ment and climate change, and what is called "the animal turn."1 (2) The ghostly character of the great work or masterpiece, what makes such a work endure, what makes it especially haunting, has to do not only with its historic</page><page sequence="3">Nicholas Royle 43 value and significance (in relation, for example, to a past tradition, movement, topos or concept), but also with what I propose to call its futurological power , with its propensity to come back (precisely in the manner of a revenant ), with its capacity to cast light on what comes later, on what ostensibly post-dates the work. Reading Conrad can help us think afresh about today, about the relations between history and fiction, about the nature of literary history, as well as about a futurological strange- ness of the literary work. My concerns, then, lie with the enduring power of literature (Bloom would talk of "canonicity," I will speak of "cryptaesthetic resistance") and, above all perhaps, with the untimely nature of works that last. With the notion of futurological power I am thinking, in particular, of the ways in which the literary work "sees" or "knows" its own future, carries its own future in itself. (Perspective - narratorial, poetic, or dramaturgic - is clairvoyant.) There is something uncanny in play, akin to what Peter Boxali has recently talked about in the context of "the future of the novel" - namely, "the future that the novel contains within it, the apprehension or prevision of a time to come that the novel harbours" (211) - and to what Rita Felski refers to as the ability of the literary work "to traverse temporal boundaries and to generate new and unanticipated resonances, including those that cannot be pre- dicted by its original circumstances" (10). (3) The form of the critical response itself cannot be unaffected by these per- spectivai shifts concerning spectrality and temporality. With the spectralization of the canon new challenges and responsibilities emerge, regarding the question of how crit- ical writing should proceed, what a critical essay or discourse should be like, what sorts of tone or register, voice or position should be adopted. In contradistinction to a reading that insists on fixity and solidity (the literary critical equivalent, say, of a Richter scale or Geiger counter reading), it is necessary to reckon with new possibili- ties, ways of reading that seek to respond in kind to the forms of ghostliness at issue. As my subtitle might suggest, then, I proceed in episodic fashion, treating the question of the episode in Conrad's work. You might like to imagine what follows as a literary critical mini-series, in six episodes. Episode 1: Episode Impossible Originally the word "episode" referred to "the interlocutory parts between two choric songs" in ancient Greek drama (see OED , "episode," sense 1). Nowadays in English the word tends to be used in the context of an instalment in a TV or radio series. (While this essay in six episodes is on neither TV nor radio, you might care to picture it com- ing to you nonetheless through a certain form of telephony or radiophony, or even a sort of "speaking tube" such as Conrad refers to in "Typhoon" and about which I will</page><page sequence="4">44 Mosaic 47/1 (March 2014) try to say a little more later.) "Episode" also has a musical sense, referring to a passage containing distinct material or a new subject. In addition, especially in recent years, "episode" has become a term used in a medical context to refer to a bout or spell of ill- ness. Principally, however, in the context of Conrad s work, "episode" has the sense of "An incidental narrative or digression in a poem, story, etc., separable from the main subject, yet arising naturally from it" (OED, sense 2); and "transf An incidental 'passage' in a person's life, in the history of a country, the world, an institution, etc." (sense 3). A significant ambiguity or duplicity, then, may be remarked here: the word "episode" comports at once a specific literary sense (an incidental narrative or digression in a story) and a non-literary sense (a "passage" in someone's life or in history). Conrad plays on this double reference, I want to argue; indeed, his writing plays havoc with it. In order to begin to explore this, I propose to look at one of his critical essays, "Henry James: An Appreciation," and at two short passages in particular. Here is the first: "Fiction is history, human history, or it is nothing. But it is also more than that; it stands on firmer ground, being based on the reality of forms and the observation of social phenomena, whereas history is based on documents, and the reading of print and handwriting - on second-hand impression. Thus fiction is nearer truth. But let that pass. A historian may be an artist too, and a novelist is a historian, the preserver, the keeper, the expounder, of human experience" (65). This passage affirms the social value of fiction, proclaiming the "reality" and primacy of fiction as against the "second-hand impression [ism]" of written history. At the same time, Conrad asserts a forceful yoking or identity - "fiction is history [. . .] or it is nothing" - and in doing so commits a nice sleight of hand, characterizing history as based on "the reading of print," among other things, as if fiction were not that also. Integral to what Conrad is saying about fiction and history is the importance of writing. In the event of an earthquake, fiction might seem better protected. It "stands on firmer ground," as he says. But this firmness also entails a greater flexibility. The work of fiction is more bendy, we might say, and thus more resistant. In emphasizing a sort of figurative earthquake in this passage (where one kind of writing is less liable to collapse than another), I want to draw out the ways in which Conrad's writing (and his fictional writing in particular) embodies forms of literary seismism. This involves not only the more dramatic kinds of danger - regarding what he refers to in Lord Jim as "a sense of utter insecurity as during an earthquake" (347) - but so many other less obvious sorts of unsettling feeling and realization, vibrations, reverberations, and after-effects. We may recall in this context his suggestion in the Preface to The Nigger of the " Narcissus " that his task as a writer is "to snatch in a moment of courage [. . .] a passing phase of life" and "to show its vibrations" (34). If in comparison with history,</page><page sequence="5">Nicholas Royle 45 "fiction is nearer truth," as Conrad puts it, this is perhaps because - in its work of pre- serving, keeping, and expounding human experience - it makes such experience tremble. Fiction shows "the reality of forms" and "social phenomena" in their imme- diate mortal fragility and instability. It makes the sense of time itself tremble. The figure and concept of the episode provide a means of elucidating these ideas. These are the closing words of Conrad's essay on James: Perhaps the only true desire of mankind, coming thus to light in its hours of leisure, is to be set at rest. One is never set at rest by Mr. Henry James's novels. His books end as an episode in life ends. You remain with the sense of the life still going on; and even the sub- tle presence of the dead is felt in that silence that comes upon the artist- creation when the last word has been read. It is eminently satisfying, but it is not final. Mr. Henry James, great artist and faithful historian, never attempts the impossible. (66) Fifteen years or so before Freud's Beyond the Pleasure Principle , Conrad adumbrates a theory of the human correspondingly based on the hypothesis that the greatest desire is "to be set at rest." Or as Freud will later put it: "The dominating tendency of men- tal life, and perhaps of nervous life in general, is the effort to reduce, to keep constant or to remove internal tension due to stimuli" (55-56). This is the silent dominating work of what Freud called the death instincts. Bringing it all to an end would be, in Hamlet's words, "a consummation / Devoutly to be wished" (3.1.63-64). "Perhaps the only true desire of mankind," Conrad says, is "the desire for finality," the desire in other words to, in the end, splitting a last infinitive, be dead. By critical consensus Conrad's "appreciation" of James is solidly eulogistic, if not adulatory. But here, as elsewhere, the relations between Conrad and James are enig- matic, divided, reserved. And crucial evidence is missing. As Ian Watt observes, "Conrad habitually destroyed his letters; James burned most of his papers before his death: and less than a dozen letters survive from what must have been a fairly large correspondence" (133). There is doubtless intense ambivalence on both sides. If we paused at this moment in Conrad's essay ("to be set at rest"), we might be forgiven for supposing that he is suggesting that reading Henry James makes you want to kill your- self. For it is, he says, precisely in these "hours of leisure," when we find ourselves with time to read novels, that this death wish "com [es] thus to light." But the succeeding sentence immediately reverses any such inference: "One is never set at rest by Mr. Henry James's novels." James's novels, after all, affirm life; he is one of the major authors in the realm of the restless.</page><page sequence="6">46 Mosaic 47/1 (March 2014) "His books end as an episode in life ends. You remain with the sense of the life still going on; and even the subtle presence of the dead is felt in that silence that comes upon the artist-creation when the last word has been read." These words tell us as much about reading Conrad as about reading James. A work of fiction can end as an episode in life ends: what links "fiction" and "life," what makes them in some sense the same, indistinguishable or interchangeable, is the episode. Here, then, Conrad explicidy marks out the peculiar duplicity of the word "episode" as being at once life and fiction. Moreover the episode is strangely unfinished: one is left with the sense of something "still going on." And the conception of the episode here does, after all, carry something of death s sting, or death's thing, the strange thing that is not a thing. "The subtle pres- ence of the dead" might sound like a quotation from The Turn of the Screw (it is not, in fact), but, in any event, it testifies to a fascination with the eerie survival techniques of writing, with a ghostly conception of episode in which death has a "subtle presence." What about the last word of Conrad's own text? It seems simple enough: "Mr. Henry James, great artist and faithful historian, never attempts the impossible." That is to say, James does not attempt anything so silly as a finale or solution. This closing sen- tence hearkens back to Conrad's earlier ridiculing of novels that work with "the usual methods of solution by rewards and punishments" and thus end with "crowned love," "fortune," "a broken leg" or "sudden death" (66). Henry James "never attempts the impossible." The impossible here would then be a sort of bathos - James never attempts anything as banal as what E. M. Forster would later call "the idiotic use of mar- riage as a finale" (50). But Conrad's closing sentences have prepared us for a certain curiosity and over- determination - he has specifically, if surreptitiously, alerted us to the sense of silence that comes "when the last word has been read." Henry James never attempts the impossible. This statement pitches, perhaps, beyond the merely bathetic. Without turning this sentence into too much of a ghost of itself, without letting its shadow overwhelm, but recalling nonetheless another distinction that Conrad makes between himself and James in this same final paragraph, namely that Conrad himself is one of those who, like "most of us," lives "in a sort of intellectual moon- light," in the sorts of "shadows so firmly renounced by Mr Henry James's men and women" (66), it remains difficult to ignore the silhouette of another reading. Such at least would be my hypothesis here: in certain important respects, James indeed never attempts the impossible, whereas Conrad hardly ever does anything else. The Master has to live up to his name, however impossible that might in truth be. James's writ- ings are so controlled, so eloquent and calculating, even in their articulations of what cannot be said. They are so achieved, so finely levelled, so meticulously overseen. James's work gives off nothing of the physical danger and disorder, the precarious haphazardness and madness that erupt from Conrad's texts. In a manner that is rad-</page><page sequence="7">Nicholas Royle 47 ically different to James's, the episodes of Conrad's fiction, the episodic nature of his fiction, call to be read in relation to the impossible, to experiencing the impossible. I am not sure whether this last phrase has set off any alarm bells, but "the expe- rience of the impossible" is a definition of deconstruction. It is indeed described by Derrida, on at least one occasion, as "the least bad definition" of "deconstruction" ("Afterw.rds" 200). In this context, too, we might recall his contention that "decon- struction" entails "a coming-to-terms with literature" ("Deconstruction" 9). If decon- struction entails a certain experience of the impossible, this would be something in the literary work, in "The Secret Sharer" or "Typhoon." Episode 2: Cryptaesthetic Resistance It is necessary to reckon with Conrad at the time of writing. This phrase can be under- stood in several ways. First, it can refer to the time when Conrad was writing. Thus we speak of how his essay on James in 1904 comes a couple of years after the publication of "Typhoon" and fifteen or so years before Freud's Beyond the Pleasure Principley and so on. Second, it can be read in more or less contrary fashion as referring to the time of this writing, this text that I am now writing about Conrad, in 2013. Here the phrase would refer to the question of reading Conrad now, today, at the time of writing. Third, "Conrad at the time of writing" could be taken as referring to the kind of understand- ing of writing and time that has been elaborated by Derrida. I am thinking here of the consequences and effects of his contention, in Of Grammatology , that "writing opens the field of history" (27). The strangeness of writing has to do with the fact that it escapes the organization of past or present or future tenses. As Derrida also observes, "writing as such does not consist in any of these tenses (present, past or future insofar as they are all modified presents)" ("Outwork" 7). It is in this untimely context, it seems to me, that we can trace deep affinities between Conrad and Derrida. There is something ghostly about writing. A text is not a presence, it is structured by a logic of living on or sur-viving. As Conrad noted in his Preface to The Nigger of the "Narcissus/' "Art is long and life is short" (35). "Conrad at the time of writing," then, can also refer to the after-life of his work, including the sense of a time not yet. The force and value of literary texts have to do in part, perhaps, with what they prompt us to think or feel about the future. Conrad at the time of writing would then open on to a thinking of another ghostly time - the experience of the coming of the entirely other. This strange, even impossible figure of "the time of writing" is not arbi- trarily imposed here. Certain texts, I want to argue, have a special capacity (which can take the form of passivity, weakness, or humility) in exposing us to a sense of the ghostly, to uncanny feelings of upheaval and alteration, in throwing strange new light on the future, on what nobody was to know.</page><page sequence="8">48 Mosaic 47/1 (March 2014) Certain literary texts have remarkable after-lives or perhaps (with reference to the period of time in which activity of a radioactive substance falls to half its original value) half-lives. What is a masterpiece? What makes one literary work live on, endure, resist erosion, better than another? What makes certain works by Conrad (such as "The Secret Sharer" and "Typhoon") seem enduring, what makes them per- sist and continue to insist, to remain compelling and even urgent? Derrida meditates on this question in a fragmentary text published in English in 1989 under the title "BiodÃ©gradables": the great work or masterpiece, he suggests, "must be assimilated as inassimilable, kept in reserve, unforgettable because irreceiv- able, capable of inducing meaning without being exhausted by meaning, incompre- hensibly elliptical, secret." The great work "resists erosion," he says, it cannot "be reduced to a totality" and "always exceeds interpretation." It is in this context that he speaks of the "enigmatic kinship" between the masterpiece and "nuclear waste" (845). What leads us to consider a work "great" or "canonical" involves what I call cryptaes- thetic resistance. Cryptaesthetic resistance is related to Derrida's characterization of the work as "capable of inducing meaning without being exhausted by meaning," the work as that which "resists erosion," resists being turned into a totality, resists the possibility of a final interpretation, and so on. More specifically, however, the term cryptaesthetic resist- ance is offered as part of an effort to think anew about the performative, magical char- acter of literary works, starting with a reconsideration of the telepathic and clairvoyant in the realm of literature. The adjective "cryptaesthetic" is not in widespread use - in fact, according to the OED, it doesn't exist. I believe I made it up. "Cryptaesthesia," how- ever, does appear in the OED (3rd edition, 2011), where it is defined as "Extrasensory perception, esp. telepathy or clairvoyance; a faculty for this." And indeed the dictionary goes on to refer (via Caroline Rooney's African Literaturey Animism and Politics) to my reading of this term in Telepathy and Literature. As far as I am aware, this is the first ref- erence to my work in the OED and I can readily imagine that it will also be the last. I must make the best of it while I can, at the time of writing. I propose "cryptaesthetic" as a neologism that condenses several meanings and possibilities: ( 1 ) It is a compound that refers to the capacity of a literary work variously to combine the cryptic and the aesthetic, secrecy and the senses, hiddenness and beauty. What is happening in a literary text, and what is beautiful, sublime, or uncanny, is doubtless in some sense all on the surface; but what constitutes an event, an experi- ence of the senses, or of the beautiful and so on, is never simply a given. The cryptaes- thetic force of a work requires a reading or countersignature that responds to what is</page><page sequence="9">Nicholas Royle 49 elliptical, oblique, hidden away even in the obvious. If the task of the writer is, in Conrad's celebrated formulation in the Preface to The Nigger of the "Narcissus," "by the power of the written word," to "make you see" (34, emph. mine), it is also to make you not see, to divert your attention, to preserve and play with forms of blindness, to keep hiding . (2) In a more specifically psychoanalytic orientation, the crypt of "cryptaesthetic" points toward the theory of the crypt elaborated by Nicolas Abraham and Maria Torok, and others. In this regard, emphasis falls on the notion of the crypt as a figure of impossible or refused mourning and of trans-generational haunting. (3) "Cryptaesthetic" entails an appropriation and reinscription of the spiritualist or parapsychological usage, specifically for the purpose of referring to the ways in which a literary work might be said to see its reader coming, or (put slightly differ- ently) the ways in which narrative fictions, in particular, know or can seem to know their own futures, even if their readers do not. Just to make things clear: my concern is not to set out a parapsychological account of literature. If anything, it is the other way round, in other words to show that the discourse and concepts of parapsychology are irreducibly literary. I am not crazy, I do not believe that I am crazy, but literature is crazy. No critical discourse should deceive itself or its readers on this front: a literary criticism or literary theory that tries to ignore, repress, or sidestep the fact that literature is mad is, I believe, not really engaging with literature. Analysis of the cryptaesthetic, then, means exploring the inextricable links between literature and so-called "magical thinking" (i.e., "I can hear voices in my head," "others can hear what I am thinking," and so on). As I have argued in "The 'Telepathy Effect'" and elsewhere, there is no "realist fiction" without telepathy, clairvoyance, and clairaudience. As soon as you have a first-person narra- tor who is not the same as the author, as soon as you have a third-person narrative that tells you what a certain character is thinking or feeling, you have a scene of "tele- pathic thinking." Correspondingly, analysis of the cryptaesthetic is intimately aligned with spec- iality, another thing that, in a different context, might of course readily lend itself to suppositions of lunacy. I am thinking here, especially, of tuning in to the voices and desires of the dead, conversing with ghosts, affirming and committing oneself to an analysis of the experience of being haunted, and so on. Mourning, in this respect, is not a theme or motif of literary works, but their condition of possibility. We come back to that "subtle presence of the dead" evoked by Conrad - not to suggest self- immersion in melancholia, but to acknowledge the irreducible strangeness of writing and living on, to affirm what survives in us and survives us.</page><page sequence="10">50 Mosaic 47/1 (March 2014) A "cryptaesthetics of literature" ( Telepathy 61), as I have called it, offers a differ- ent way of exploring what makes texts such as "The Secret Sharer" or "Typhoon" so rich and provoking, not only for thinking about "What is literature?" or "What makes a particular text last?" but also for thinking about what is happening in the world now, at the time of writing. What the notion of cryptaesthetic resistance opens on to, above all perhaps, is the question of a sort of mind-reading in reverse - in other words, the idea that certain texts can read their readers as well as, or even better than, their read- ers can read them. Bloom makes that claim, in particular, about Shakespeare: "We are read by works we cannot resist. We need to exert ourselves and read Shakespeare as strenuously as we can, while knowing that his plays will read us more energetically still. They read us definitively" ( Shakespeare xx). Something similar operates in the case of the short stories of Franz Kafka. If you ask someone what they think "The Burrow" is about, or how they read "Before the Law," their response will usually tell you more about them than about Kafka's text. Great works of literature read their readers at least as well as readers read them. I believe that a similar logic operates in certain texts by Conrad. Conrad writes quick fiction - quick in the sense of something fleeting and alive, but also fictive, "a moment of life" that would be the time of writing, a singular med- itation as fast as thought, ahead of us reading as ever, meditating on the book as hav- ing a life or afterlife just as precarious as that of its author. "Of all the inanimate objects, of all men's creations, books are the nearest to us, for they contain our very thought," he writes in the essay entitled "Books": "Most of all they resemble us in their precarious hold on life" (68). He relates the construction of a work of fiction to that of a bridge: "A bridge constructed according to the rules of the art of bridge-building is certain of a long, honourable, and useful career. But a book as good in its way as the bridge may perish obscurely on the very day of its birth." The metaphor hardly holds up. The hope is that the construction can withstand an earthquake - the novel or short story is designed, dreamed, engineered, and built to be "worthy of enduring life" - but all the writer can do is give birth to the work, give it "a moment of life." Thereafter, even the best books lie "under the menace of an early death" (69). That sense of menace and danger is just what makes Conrad's work quick fiction, fiction that makes the distinction between life and text tremble, holding the reader in ani- mated suspense, and making commentary itself verge on the impossible. Episode 3: The Secret Sharer Conrad does not necessarily decide on a title for a story and stick to it. The final title often comes only later. The story now known as "The Secret Sharer" had various other</page><page sequence="11">Nicholas Royle 5 i working titles, including "The Secret Self," "The Other Self," and "The Second Self." Telling Pinker about its completion in a letter dated 15 December 1909, he added the postscript: "What do you think for title of the story The Second Self. An Episode from the SeÄ ( Letters IV: 299). When first published in Harper's Monthly Magazine (New York) in 1910, it was "The Secret-Sharer" with a hyphen. As Cedric Watts has noted, the hyphenation suggests "the sharer of a secret" rather than "the person who secretly shares" ("Typhoon" 228n). The hyphenation is bad enough; "The Other Self" or "The Second Self" would have been far worse. They would doubtless have made too obvi- ous the sense that, as Marvin Mudrick observed, this is a story in which Conrad is "not only anticipating psychoanalysis but showing how to vulgarize it" (qtd. in Watt 131). Strange evocation: Mudrick offers us a Conrad at the time of writing, anticipating Otto Rank's The Double: A Psychoanalytic Study, and anticipating Freud's further dis- cussion of the double in "The Uncanny," while also anticipating the consequences or effects of reading those texts, or perhaps failing to read them, a vulgarization which has not yet occurred. At least implicit here is the possibility that "The Secret Sharer" has something to say about the future of psychoanalysis or, to put it more boldly perhaps, that it reads psychoanalytic knowledge in advance, critiquing and subsum- ing that knowledge - knowledge, for example, based on the concept of projective identification - through the subtlety, intricacy, and limpidity of its own workings. The story seems easy enough to summarize. The narrator relates an episode con- cerning his first experience in command of a ship, just setting out on its "homeward journey" to England. He tells how, prior even to starting the long journey home, alone on deck on his first night aboard, he sees a body in the water, a figure who transpires to be a man called Leggatt. The captain-narrator allows him to come on board. The stranger explains that he has fled from another ship, the Sephora: he has killed a man, an unpremeditated act, in overwhelmingly difficult circumstances, and he wants to avoid going back to England to face "an old judge and a respectable jury." The narra- tor decides that Leggatt is "no homicidal ruffian" (187) and lets him hide away in his stateroom. Despite the immense challenges and risks involved, the captain succeeds in keeping Leggatt hidden until the point that the ship has to negotiate a perilous, seem- ingly impossible manoeuvre, steered in too close to the coast, enabling the stranger surreptitiously to swim off unseen, "a free man," as the final words of the story put it, "a proud swimmer striking out for a new destiny" (217). But there is also something laughable and silly about such a summary as this - it recalls Bill Readings's nice observation that paraphrase is "a philosophical joke" (xxi). What infinitely complicates and estranges a reading of "The Secret Sharer" is the narrator's insistent sense of the other man, the killer, as his "double," his "grey ghost"</page><page sequence="12">52 Mosaic 47/1 (March 2014) (188), his "other self" (194), his "second self" (196, 211). "The Secret Sharer" is one of the great "double" stories in Western literature - reminiscent of Edgar Allen Poe's "William Wilson," Dostoevsky's early novel The Double , James Hogg's Confessions of a Justified SinneVy and Stevenson's "Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde." But Conrad's story has a peculiar grace and serenity that distinguishes it from these other works. It is markedly less dramatic or melodramatic, its feeling of psychological disturbance at once irrefutable and muted. And at the same time it is in various ways trickier, less credulous than these other famous "double" stories in relation to the supernatural. Conrad could hardly be said to leave the supernatural out of things, but the ghostliness of this text is of a singularly pacific and subtle kind. And there is no straining for rationalization, for what E. J. Clery and others term "the supernatural explained": the experience of the double here is more in the spirit of Keats's "negative capability." Conrad knew that he had written something extraordinary. As he confided in a letter to Edward Garnett (5 Nov. 1912), "the Secret Sharer, between you and me, is it. Eh? . . . Every word fits and there's not a single uncertain note. Luck my boy. Pure luck" (Letters V: 128, emph. Conrad's). Everything is so shipshape, tight, devious, and duplic- itous at the same time. You read the opening and it's seen you coming a mile off: On my right hand there were lines of fishing stakes resembling a mysterious system of half- submerged bamboo fences, incomprehensible in its division of the domain of tropical fishes, and crazy of aspect as if abandoned forever by some nomad tribe of fishermen now gone to the other end of the ocean; for there was no sign of human habitation as far as the eye could reach. To the left a group of barren islets, suggesting ruins of stone walls, towers, and blockhouses, had its foundations set in a blue sea that itself looked solid, so still and stable did it lie below my feet; even the track of light from the westering sun shone smoothly, without that animated glitter which tells of an imperceptible ripple. And when I turned my head to take a parting glance at the tug which had just left us anchored outside the bar, I saw the straight line of the flat shore joined to the stable sea, edge to edge, with a perfect and unmarked closeness, in one levelled floor half brown, half blue under the enor- mous dome of the sky. Corresponding in their insignificance to the islets of the sea, two small clumps of trees, one on each side of the only fault in the impeccable joint, marked the mouth of the river Meinam we had just left on the first preparatory stage of our homeward journey; and, far back on the inland level, a larger and loftier mass, the grove surrounding the great Paknam pagoda, was the only thing on which the eye could rest from the vain task of exploring the monotonous sweep of the horizon. Here and there gleams as of a few scat- tered pieces of silver marked the windings of the great river; and on the nearest of them, just within the bar, the tug steaming right into the land became lost to my sight, hull and funnel and masts, as though the impassive earth had swallowed her up without an effort, without a tremor. My eye followed the light cloud of her smoke, now here, now there, above the plain, according to the devious curves of the stream, but always fainter and farther away,</page><page sequence="13">Nicholas Royle 53 till I lost it at last behind the mitre-shaped hill of the great pagoda. And then I was left alone with my ship, anchored at the head of the Gulf of Siam. She floated at the starting point of a long journey, very still in an immense stillness, the shadows of her spars flung far to the eastward by the setting sun. At that moment I was alone on her decks. There was not a sound in her - and around us nothing moved, noth- ing lived, not a canoe on the water, not a bird in the air, not a cloud in the sky. In this breath- less pause at the threshold of a long passage we seemed to be measuring our fitness for a long and arduous enterprise, the appointed task of both our existences to be carried out, far from all human eyes, with only sky and sea for spectators and for judges. (179-80) Reading Conrad means you are already at sea, from the very start, your thinking is at sea, reading at sea, you are veering and the text is already away. Everything is rigged. Nothing is how it seems. It is a scene that looks back (with "sky and sea" as "specta- tors"), that looks at its narrator (and, by extension, also at the reader) and might tell. Everything appears exact, "on my right hand," and then "to the left." Everything is "solid," "flat," "stable," "monotonous," "the straight line of the flat shore joined to the stable sea, edge to edge." But nothing in fact is itself, nothing is quite right. It's a seething madness, "mysterious," "incomprehensible," "crazy of aspect." It is like the end of the world. It is the end of the world - the scene "as if abandoned forever by some nomad tribe of fishermen now gone to the other end of the ocean." "Now gone" - that now, so easily thrown in, like a still-smoldering cigar into the night ocean. And soon enough "now" returns, another now, seemingly insignificant - impossible figure at the time of writing. "Now here, now there": the narrator is fol- lowing the smoke left by "the tug steaming right into the land [. . .] as though the impassive earth had swallowed her up without an effort, without a tremor." Without a tremor: this is one of the more striking rhetorical devices that Conrad plants in his opening. It goes along with the phrase "without that animated glitter which tells of an imperceptible ripple," a preposition with a deprivative force that summons what it purports to dismiss. The denial of a tremor is a tremor of another, perhaps more insidious and haunting kind. We think of the tremor, as much as its absence, and we think of the strangely "animated glitter" - especially when told through a metaphor of "tellÄ¼ingÄ¼" that leads to a similarly elusive "imperceptible ripple." The reader does not know - but the text knows - that this tug being monstrously swallowed up by "the impassive earth" is a ghostly prefiguring of the end of the narrative, when the captain-narrator's ship seems to have gone in "too close" to the land. As he will later observe, "Was she close enough? Already she was, I won't say in the shadow of the land, but in the very blackness of it, already swallowed up as it were, gone too close to be recalled, gone from me altogether" (214). The swallowing up of the tug in the</page><page sequence="14">54 Mosaic 47/1 (March 2014) opening paragraph becomes eerie after the fact. It is an instance of what might be called the retrolexic uncanny: on rereading it appears as a foreshadowing that is at once literal and metaphorical, intradiegetic and narcological. What would an "animated glitter" be, if one could be seen? This is one of at least two moments in the opening page or so where Conrad appears to draw on the phan- tasmagoric supernaturalism of Coleridge's "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner." Another moment would be the narrator's sense of being "alone with [his] ship," in a space where "nothing moved, nothing lived" (179-80). The spectral "glittering" of the Ancient Mariner's eye (3, 228) and his loneliness at sea ("Alone on a wide wide sea!" [233] ) perhaps come to mind, but here, as elsewhere in "The Secret Sharer," Coleridge's poem is suggested only in momentary flickers or flashes. It is quite different, that is to say, from the explicit intertextual intercourse between "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" and The Shadow-Line. In his various non-fictional writings, Conrad fre- quently affirms what he calls the magical character of art. "All creative art is magic," he remarks in the essay on lames; it is "evocation of the unseen" (63). What is at issue here is not, however, an affirmation of the supernatural so much as of a superficial but unfathomable haunting. It has to do with "strange power of speech" (to borrow the words of Coleridge's Mariner [586]), and with the uncanny effects of writing. As the "Author's Note to The Shadow-Line " makes clear, Conrad has strong reser- vations about what he calls "the mere supernatural": the world has enough "mystery and terror in itself" (111). And yet from its very title onwards, "The Secret Sharer" works to unsettle such distinctions. You are invited to join the calmness of this open- ing but you find you are already caught up in an experience of the impossible - episode impossible. The episode is part of life, the world, the real, and at the same time inextricably bound up with the ghostly and uncanny, with the frenetic literary indus- try of telepathy and clairvoyance. Anthropomorphism, a sense of fatefulness, a toying with something supernatural - these are all feverishly at work in the cryptaesthetic mine of Conrad's writing. Perhaps precisely because they seem largely hinted, off to one side, the correspondences between "The Secret Sharer" and "The Ancient Mariner" loom and persist. As the example of the swallowing up of the ship suggests, the Coleridgean figure of the ouroboros seems to lurk or curl around here. Conrad's open- ing comes strangely to bear the tale's ending, the tale sending its tail-end to be swal- lowed up in its mouth. The episode encrypts, circles back into retelling and rereading. Let us linger a moment longer on the final sentence of this opening passage: "In this breathless pause at the threshold of a long passage we seemed to be measuring our fitness for a long and arduous enterprise, the appointed task of both our exis- tences to be carried out, far from all human eyes, with only sky and sea for spectators</page><page sequence="15">Nicholas Royle 55 and for judges." The description relies on anthropomorphism - the sky and sea as spectators and judges, the "we" as the narrator and the "she" that is the ship - but, in its hushed or muted character, this is quite different from the supernaturalism of Coleridge's poem. "Measuring our fitness": cryptaesthetic resistance has to do with encouraging readers to measure their fitness, with tracing "devious curves" around what they might wish to fix as a final, definitive reading. The narrator presumably means by "fitness" something like "suitability," "worthiness," or "appropriateness," but the peculiarities of what is "fit," and what "fit" is, hang over this "breathless pause." The weirdness of the moment is perhaps easily passed over: a narrator recounts a "pause" in which he and his ship seem to confer on the question of fitness. The "seem- ing" ("we seemed to be measuring") at once affirms the bizarreness of the anthropo- morphism and implies a peculiar dissociation of the "I" from itself - as if they might not actually be "measuring their fitness" but doing something else, instead or in addi- tion. There is some sort of cover-up going on, the text is hiding itself from us: the nar- rator is well-aware that he is to undergo an "arduous enterprise" but does not here confirm it. Its status is anticipated, marked, as something fateful, "the appointed task of both our existences." A knowledge of the future is at once affirmed and effaced. The cryptaesthetic, in this manner, makes itself resistant. "Every word fits," to recall Conrad's phrase in his letter to Garnett. A separate essay, perhaps an entire book, might be devoted to an analysis of the workings of the Conradian "fit." But it would be just one of the innumerable strangely improper words through which the cryptaesthetic force of "The Secret Sharer" might be explored. "Fit" is also a recurrent figure in "The Ancient Mariner," primarily in the sense of a seizure, a paroxysm or attack. We might think, for instance, of that unset- tling, cryptic exclamation: "How long in that same fit I lay / I have not to declare" (393-94). (And "fit," of course, in the context of Coleridge's poem, also seems to play on the metadiscursive level - where "fit" is a sort of poetic episode, referring to "a part or section of a poem" [OED fit, n.l, sense 1].) The event encrypted at the heart of "The Secret Sharer" is the killing. When Leggatt talks about this, it is as if he is some- one else: "I had him by the throat, and went on shaking him like a rat [. . .] It's clear that I meant business, because I was holding him by the throat still when they picked us up. He was black in the face" (187). But before Leggatt has even recounted this, the captain has proffered an explanation: "Fit of temper" (186), he suggests confidently. In the end - and doubtless all along - the Conradian "fit" is related to whisper- ing. In a sort of valedictory or summative remark, Leggatt whispers to the narrator: "'You seem to have been there on purpose.'" The narrator goes on: "And in the same whisper, as if we two whenever we talked had to say things to each other which were</page><page sequence="16">56 Mosaic 47/1 (March 2014) not fit for the world to hear, he added, 'It s very wonderful"' (209). The strangeness of what is "not fit for the world to hear" spooks the work. Everything seems to happen in silence or at the level of the ghostly whisper. "The Secret Sharer" is a remarkable exam- ple of what I have elsewhere called the "whispering text" ("Ouijamiflip" 239). Conrad makes an art of whispering: as he says in his Preface to The Nigger of the "Narcissus," the cry of art is finally to be "heard only as a whisper" (35). How should a critical read- ing respond to this whispering? What would be a fitting tone or register? Conrad's text invites us to dream of a new critical discourse, whispering criticism or whisper theory. There is something funny about whispering and about the double. The figure of the double can be frightening: it is, as Freud says, an "uncanny harbinger of death" ("Uncanny" 235). But it can also be a comic figure (as in Shakespeare's comedies): the double can be pleasing. Such is the hint given by Leggatt's recalling that when the nar- rator first looked at him, naked in the water, "I didn't mind being looked at. I - I liked it." Likewise, what Leggatt is first drawn to in the narrator is the quietness of his voice - "you speaking so quietly - as if you had expected me" (193). But whispering may be fearful as well as erotic. Whispering is forced on the two men on account of the perilous circumstances - life amid all "the scares" (205), as the narrator terms them. Whispering is in fear, for fear, out of fear, to the end: "The time had come to exchange our last whispers, for neither of us was ever to hear each other's natural voice" (212). "The Secret Sharer" is a weird double-act and double-reading from its title onward. The narrator is an anonymous sea-captain - not Joseph Conrad but another "I." The narrator is not the same as the author, even as Conrad's text plays on this duplicity. It is a dangerous work of what might be called split-first-person or multi- ple split-first-person. What makes "The Secret Sharer" an exemplary work of cryptaesthetic resistance has to do with the ways in which it solicits so many different kinds of possible, but not exhaustive, readings. It is a story about conscience, about authority and responsibility, about legacy (being a "Leggatt" or legate, and so on), about madness, about psychoanalysis, about the homoerotic, about hospitality (as Kaoru Yamamoto has recently argued), about what Watt calls "joint opposition to the law" (131) and thus about civil disobedience. It is a story about being at sea, about the uncanny, and about the supernatural. But coming alongside or in addition to all these (and to so many others), "The Secret Sharer" is about the eruptive, impossible expe- rience of being two, and about this ghostly experience as the very condition or "secret" of literary fiction. It is about literature itself as ghostly double, a voicing and experiencing of, in Derrida's words, "the altogether bare device of being-two-to- speak" ( Given 153). It is uncertainly grave and funny double-talk about the double in language and language as double.</page><page sequence="17">Nicholas Royle 57 If "every word fits," this has to do with the strange felicities of "pure luck" as much as any so-called authorial genius. The cryptaesthetic, as I have outlined it, is as much about the effects of what Conrad's A Personal Record calls "the genius of the lan- guage" (v) as it is about what an author calculates or intends. At issue here is a con- ception of genius as, in Derrida's fine phrase, what "gives without knowing it" ( Geneses 75), or what I have elsewhere ventured as "wordlife" ( Veering 162). There is something peculiarly English about "The Secret Sharer," as Conrad observes in a let- ter to Edith Wharton in December 1912, apropos its possible translation into French. It cannot really be translated, he suggests, because the text is "so particularly English, in moral atmosphere, in feeling and even in detail" ( Letters V: 152). If "The Secret Sharer" is about a captain who is a stranger to his own ship and a stranger to himself ("what I felt most was my being a stranger to the ship; and if all the truth must be told, I was somewhat of a stranger to myself" [181]), a stranger who goes on to dou- ble that strangeness by relating the experience of having his own double on board (unseen by anyone else), it is tempting also to construe this duplicity in terms of a haunted relation to language itself, and in particular to Conrad's "strange and over- whelming feeling that [the English language] had always been an inherent part of myself" ( Personal v). Strange and overwhelming, the double would be embroiled in an experience of English as ghostly - at once inherent and foreign to oneself. Finally, let us consider just one other example of the trompe VoeÃ¯l wordlife of the dou- ble in this remarkable Conradian episode. The captain is standing less than a foot away from Leggatt, both of them resting an arm on the skylight, neither of them "stir [ring] a limb" (188), both of them identically dressed (since the narrator has furnished the new- comer with "a sleeping-suit of the same grey-stripe pattern as the one [he himself] was wearing" (185). It now occurs to the narrator that, if his chief mate "were to put his head up the companion and catch sight of [them], he would think he was seeing double, or imagine himself come upon a scene of weird witchcraft; the strange captain having a quiet confabulation by the wheel with his own grey ghost" (188). The alliteration of "weird" with "witchcraft" intimates the hushed but polytonal texture of Conrad's writing. There is already an air of comedy in the thought of the chief mate, with his "round eyes and fright- ful whiskers" (181) and his Dickensian caricatured uBless my soul - you dont say so" (188) manner of speaking. "Weird" is, however, both hyperbolic and quirky - on the one hand it recalls Shakespeare's Macbeth , the murderous, miasmic masterpiece in which witches and the weird appear together and, on the other, it invites us to think (with a half-smile) that there might be such a thing as witchcraft of a non- weird variety. The narrator's phrasing, in any event, seems irreducibly bound to double busi- ness, as it evokes an "or" that makes his imagining of the chief mater's seeing double</page><page sequence="18">58 Mosaic 47/1 (March 2014) itself a double vision. The mate "would think he was seeing double, or imagine him- self come upon a scene of weird witchcraft." "Seeing double" or seeing the captain with his double: what is the difference? There is an affinity here with the sort of nar- rative delirium we encounter in Dostoevsky. A comic tone ("seeing double" on account of being alcoholically inebriated, for example) is in quiet confabulation , as it were, with a quite other tone: fearful, spectral, deadly, paralyzing. And we might note that there is also perhaps a peculiar echo here of another kind of confabulation, that is to say deriving from the verb "to confabulate," meaning "to invent past experiences, either consciously or unconsciously, to compensate for loss of memory" (Chambers Dictionary). Cryptaesthetic resistance in "The Secret Sharer" concerns not just the wiles of a text that makes us see and makes us not see, but also a writing that makes us see double, see doubles seed doubles, letting words come or go with a fitful strange life of their own. I conclude these remarks on "The Secret Sharer" with an observation regarding its subtitle: "An Episode from the Coast." The word "coast" occurs five times in the text itself, twice in the original exchanges between the narrator and Leggatt, when the lat- ter is telling him how he killed a man, and three times in the closing paragraphs of the text, when the narrator is bringing the boat in dangerously close to land in order to facilitate LeggatÅ¥s discreet departure. Conrad's tale sounds a curious resonance vis-Ã - vis "coast." The English word comes from the French cÃ´te. The coast is the side (or rib). Conrad is a coast- writer, I would suggest, rather than any teller of sea tales - a coast-writer not only in the sense that he is always concerned with what is 'twixt land and sea, the shore, with what arrives (we may recall that "arriving" in English is liter- ally what comes to shore, what comes to the coast), but also in the sense of a coastal thinking, or side-thinking, thinking of what is to the side, of what is coming from the side. It is as if the writing gives without knowing it - such is the genius of cryptaes- thetic resistance. Another essay would be required in order to elaborate on side-effects in "The Secret Sharer," from the play of "each side" (right and left, inside and outside) in the opening paragraph (179), to the "side-ladder" (183) that introduces the dou- ble, to the ghostly whispering "side by side" (189, 209) that is at the heart of the tale s telling. I leave that aside for now. "The Secret Sharer" is an episode from the coast, a phrasing that suggests, how- ever oddly, that the coast writes, it is an episode from there. The word "episode" itself, so the OED tells us, derives from the ancient Greek Ã¨neicÃ³Ã´iov , neuter of Ã¨TteiaÃ³Ã´ioÃ§ coming in besides, &lt; ini in addition + eÃ¯aoÃ´oÃ§ entering, &lt; eiÃ§ into + Ã²Ã³Ã³Ã§ way (see OED, episode, n.). It is as if the double were the reality of the episode - the coming in of the double, coming into one from one's side.</page><page sequence="19">Nicholas Royle 59 Episode 4: Meanwhile, in Folkestone I have to report this episode - very brief but, as Virginia Woolf might say, engulphing. She spells the word with "ph," when she declares in a letter to Pernel Strachey (3 Aug. 1923) that she is, at the time of writing, "engulphed in the works of Conrad" (62). Here it is, my own very tiny "episode from the coast" - for I should tell you that I live by the sea, a couple of hundred metres from the English Channel (or what the French, from the other side, call la Manche). When the wind is up I can hear the waves crash- ing and withdrawing from the room where I sleep. I wake up from I don't know what, the waves crashing, the wind, the rain, or the words in my head, in a dream, very dis- tinctly, a voice has said just four words. Are they spoken in my own voice? I don't know whether one ever hears one's own voice in a dream - unless it is the only time, the time one's voice comes home to one, if one were one, but if so it was doubtless as much a woman as a man, the voice of a child or ageless. Too late to identify, it had already come to shore, an arrival case of portmanteau-de-vie weirdness, I lay without moving for some time as if flattened and immobilized, the peculiar lump I felt, the sense of these words as something washed up, debris cast up out of the jaws of sleep, demonic, like a riddle or joke delivered abruptly, out of context, a gift inadvertently intercepted or a found object in another lifetime. Nellie, I am Conrad. It might have been "Nellie" or "Nelly" - the four words came in as a sound, as I say, not as writing. I lay without moving, stunned. Who said those words? Was it the sea? I recognized it, of course, as a twisted reworking of the most vivid and memorable phrase from Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights - but what was it about? It was flung across my mind like a slop of unearthly paint, and woke me up: Nellie , I am Conrad. Where did it come from? What was I doing, like a character out of a book, imagining that I was Catherine Earnshaw denying that I was Catherine Earnshaw, while affirming myself as Conrad, addressing myself to Nellie or, possibly, addressing myself as Nellie? Waking to this bizarre phrase, now visualizing the words I had heard, like ghostly graffiti reminiscent of the air swarming with the ghostly names of Catherine in Lockwood's dream, com- ing to realize that this "nell" might be with a "-y," as is the case in Bronte's novel, or with an "-ie." A true knell. The Nellie to whom I was speaking, in the dream, then, coming to, in the hypnagoggles foisted on my face, was perhaps not so much the housekeeper at Wuthering Heights as the name of the yawl in Heart of Darkness. What was I doing talking to a ship - and who was I? It has already begun to recede. My own memory disarms me. I am no longer sure, when I woke to these words, whether they were enunciated loud and clear (like Bronte's Lockwood's Nelly's Catherine's "Nelly, I am Heathcliff" [64]) or only whispered. In a letter to Helen Sanderson, in October 1910, Conrad recalls the French translation of a fragment from Menander: La nuit</page><page sequence="20">60 Mosaic 47/1 (March 2014) porte conseil ( Letters IV: 374). The night carries counsel. The night bears wisdom if we can bear to hear it. How to listen to what the night whispers? I have to let this go, return to the sea. But let me close this episode by recalling an odd coincidence, some- thing I did not know when this feverish little fragment came to me. With hindsight we know that Conrad was on the verge of "a complete nervous breakdown" (as his wife called it in January 1910 [qtd. in Ingram 1]). He stopped work on Under Western Eyes in order to write "The Secret Sharer." He wrote the thing very fast - in ten days or less - precisely as if he were having an episode. The writing is the episode. As he says in a letter to Pinker on 15 December 1909, "I've despatched the end of the story by rail this morning, being anxious to have it typed and returned for correction so as to close this episode at once and return wholly to the other work" ( Letters IV: 297). And in the same letter, he indicates to Pinker why he had to write "The Secret Sharer" - simply, he needed the money, fast. He "started looking for a subject," he says, "and this one turned up" (297-98). "The Secret Sharer" turned up, like the dou- ble in that "episode from the coast." He needed the money because the family maid was ill and he needed to cover the costs of her treatment in hospital. He writes to Pinker: "At the time (a fortnight ago) [in other words, just as he is getting to work on 'The Secret Sharer'], we had the faithful maid Nellie (who has been with us nearly eleven years) lying dangerously ill in Folkestone Hospital" (297). At the time of writ- ing "The Secret Sharer," Conrad is thinking of Nellie: he's writing his episode from the coast for Nellie. Episode 5: Typhoon If the episode, in Conrad, is this singular thing, this singular coming in alongside, in addition, it is not simply classifiable by a linear series or by reference to a conception of discrete instalments but is rather perhaps, and in addition, about a thinking of what is to come, of what remains to come of a reading or thinking. Reading Conrad opens us to the experience of that episode, an exposure to the unforeseeable of what is coming in. I want to conclude with a brief consideration of "Typhoon" in this con- text. At the heart of the "immense stillness" of "The Secret Sharer" is an encrypted narrative, the "narrative" from Leggati that, in the narrator's own opinion, "made comment impossible" (192). This episode within the episode is about one man killing another man with his bare hands, strangling him to death, but it is intimately related to what Leggatt calls "a sea fit to turn your hair grey only a-looking on it," "an awful sea" that is, in his phrase, "mak[ing] for the ship," making for it, coming towards it, coming in. "All hands saw it coming" (187), he says. At odds perhaps with any right- thinking sense of literary history or chronological ordering, this "awful sea," I would</page><page sequence="21">Nicholas Royle 61 like to suggest - this sea "fit to turn your hair grey only a-looking at it" - contains or rather opens onto the awful sea of "Typhoon," as if it were coming in again, coming now: "'Awful sea,' [says Captain Mac Whirr] [. . .] 'Don't let me drive her under,' bark[s] Solomon Rout up the pipe. 'Dark and rain. Can't see what's coming,' utter [s] the voice" (48). Typhoon: what a word! It brings together the ancient Greek r v(/&gt;wv and the Chinese tai jung (big wind), but it appears to have Persian and Arabic mixed up in it too: the OED refers in this context to "Arabic tÃ£fa , to turn round." It is a whirl of a word, a true veerer. And as the name of a text! Conrad's "Typhoon" is a typhoonology - poised to immerse, pull, plunge, and batten you down in a sort of wild and whirling typhoonetics. Shakespeare's King Lear - with its "Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage, blow / You cataracts and hurricanoes," with its "all-shaking thunder" sum- moned up by Lear to "Strike flat the thick rotundity o' th' world," and "Crack nature's moulds" (3.2.18) - is inevitably one of the literary ghosts here, but there is no storm- writing in English that has the rushing sense of peril, the sinister force and immensity of "Typhoon." As with "The Secret Sharer," Conrad contemplated other titles, including "Equitable Division" ( Letters II: 169) and "A Skittish Cargo" (237). These alternatives may seem dull, even whimsical, but they testify to the sense that the typhoon itself is inextricably bound up with what the text calls the "horribly repugnant" (58) reality of the "two hundred Chinese coolies" battened down in "the fore 'tween-deck" (37) of the ship, each of them "carrying with him all he had in the world" (5). It is, in other words, an extraordinary story not just about a ship being "looted by [a] storm" (32), but about the sickening fantasy or presumption of "racial superiority" (10) (these Chinamen on board who, in the Captain's view, couldn't possibly be thought of as "passengers" [23]) and the de-humanizing nature of servitude and slavery, and about justice and what is "equitable" - about what to do when all the Chinamen's silver dollars, saved up for years, "amassed patiently, guarded with care, cherished fiercely" (6), go flying everywhere in the whirling chaos of the typhoon. The typhoon is also below deck, battened down, buried alive. So we read of how the boatswain "pulled back the bolt [. . .] and it was as though he had opened the door to the sounds of the tempest. A gust of hoarse yelling met him: the air was still; and the rushing of water overhead was covered by a tumult of strangled, throaty shrieks that produced an effect of desperate confusion" (41). If "The Secret Sharer" is a whispering work, "Typhoon" is a howling booming shrieking screaming yelling in a black hole, "as though the entire world were one black gully" (31). The text is a pit, buried alive in a hole, as if at once a typhoon of words, a world-whirled whirr, and a cryptic vessel with</page><page sequence="22">62 Mosaic 47/1 (March 2014) secret holds. In the same letter (to David Meldrum, 3 January 1900) in which Conrad makes reference to "Typhoon" as "a Skittish Cargo" he evokes the image of his writ- ing "fallÄ¼ing] into the bottomless hole" before adding: "Well never mind. Some day, something will come up out of the pit" ( Letters II: 237). The narrative structure concerns "a typhoon coming on" (20): it is about "some- thing out of the common coming" (24). In this way it at once describes and produces "the suspense of an interminably culminating catastrophe" (37). But it also hides itself. It encrypts this traumatic sense of what is coming, of what is coming in or com- ing in addition, through the ghostly figure, among others, of what nobody was to know. Let us take a single sentence from the beginning of section V (I note in passing that "Typhoon" comprises six sections, it is like a text in six episodes): "Nobody - not even Captain MacWhirr, who alone on deck had caught sight of a white line of foam coming on at such a height that he couldn't believe his eyes - nobody was to know the steepness of that sea and the awful depth of the hollow the hurricane had scooped out behind the running wall of water" (53). Here is the coming on or coming in, once again, "a white line of foam coming on at such a height that he couldn't believe his eyes" - an incredible wave, not just a wave too high to be believable but of a steepness and a scooped-out hollowness that "nobody was to know." Nobody was to know: cryptaesthetic force of the episode as what is not seen in the seen, of a writing concerned to make you see (that incredible "white line of foam com- ing on at such a height") and not see, plunged into blackness, at the same time. "Nobody was to know": this is the sort of colloquial phrase that one might hear after a catastrophe. Nobody was to know how major the earthquake was going to be, or how high the wave in its wake. Nobody was to know: this phrase recurs very near the end of "Typhoon," now specifically in the context of being a reader. That "Captain MacWhirr did actually think that his ship could not possibly live another hour in such a sea, and that he would never see his wife and children again" (68) is something, we are told, that MacWhirr did word, he worded it in a letter to his wife. (The transegmental drifting here - between "MacWhirr" and "did" - provides a micrological instance of the play of whirring and whirling, of the whirred and whirled world of Conrad's words, letters, and spacings more generally.)2 But Mrs MacWhirr never read the letter. The narrator confides: "Nobody was to know this (his letters got mislaid so quickly) - nobody what- ever but the steward, who had been greatly impressed by the disclosure" (68). This might be a fitting moment to return to Henry James and the notion of phantom letters and phantom reading. Elsa Nettels has observed that "James and Conrad were always interested in the psychology of letter- writers. They were equally preoccupied with the effects of letters, particularly those that are never seen by the</page><page sequence="23">Nicholas Royle 63 protagonist or the reader of the novel" (69, emph. Nettels's). Nettels does not talk about "Typhoon," yet it seems a striking example of a text that seduces, that generates its energy and suspense, and its cryptaesthetic resistance, through a singular, cryptic epistolary relay. It is a work of multiple voices - for instance, in the space of just a cou- ple of pages "bark[ing]," "cr[ying] out," "mutter [ing]," "mild," "shout[ing]" or "mat- ter-of-fact" (48-49), broken up or fragmentary, lost or sounding through "speaking-tubes" (47 ff) - all of which come to us, finally, through a disorienting, cryptic presentation and de-presentation of the epistolary. We might think, in partic- ular, of the writings of MacWhirr and Jukes, in documenting "Every appearance of a typhoon coming on," in section II (see 19-20), or of the various letters written by MacWhirr, Jukes, and Solomon Rout - letters that produce an effect in part because they get mislaid, or read by someone for whom they were not intended, and in part precisely because they are not presented or are presented only in fragmentary form. "Nobody was to know [. . .] nobody whatever but. . .": this repetition is also a linger- ing over the question of who knows what nobody knows. Somebody besides the stew- ard knows, and it has been a convention to seek to control and domesticate this ghostly figure by calling it "the narrator." "Typhoon" itself is a spectral letter, then, coming in through weird literary speaking-tubes, to be heard or read or not. And this letter is an episode from the coast: the Nan-Shan is one of those "ships coming from the far ends of the world," we are told in the closing pages: "In her short passage she had been very far; sighting, verily, even the coast of the Great Beyond, whence no ship ever returns to give up her crew to the dust of the earth" (66). Hamlets "undiscovered country from whose bourn / No traveller returns" (3.1.79-80) is Conrad's coast. Episode 6: Afterword , After-Whirred. , After-Whirledy and After-Effects J. Hillis Miller gives a poignant account of what it was like reading Conrad for the first time. He came upon a copy of "Typhoon" when he was about thirteen or fourteen (in around 1941 or 1942), "rummaging around one day in my father's library." He was looking for something to read, "some story" of some kind: The only such book I could find was "Typhoon." I opened the book and read, and then read and read, with fascinated attention. I became "lost in the book," as they say. I can still remember that I found "Typhoon" enchanting, in the literal sense. I was carried away. The words on the page exerted a magic power to take me to an imaginary place and to cause me to relive an imaginary action. It seemed to me, when I finally raised my head from the book, that I had lived through that storm, in all its fury, and had been with Captain MacWhirr, Mr Jukes, and the rest, sharing their experience [. . .] This kind of reading is a primordial and authentic way to be related to a literary work. All the superstructure of criticism, analy- sis, and commentary is erected on the foundations of such an "enchanted" reading. (9-10)</page><page sequence="24">64 Mosaic 47/1 (March 2014) In these pages I have tried to talk about this sense of "magic power" in reading Conrad. I have sought to relate it to the notion of cryptaesthetic resistance, to uncanny strangeness and multiple voices, to the enchantment of a whispering or shouting or writing in double, indeed innumerable voices, tones, registers. I have tried to explore the duplicitous and ghostly nature of the episode, and what is dangerous, trembling, threatening to erupt or go to pieces in ConraÄs practice of quick fiction. Cryptaesthetic resistance, as I have tried to sketch it here, has to do not just with the immense pleasure of reading Conrad, but also with an experience of mortal fragility and danger, with Conrad's provocation to thinking in and about the present, about what is coming, what remains to come back, what haunts. With considerable trepida- tion and unease, I had wanted to try to say something, finally, about what happened almost two years ago, and what is doubtless still unfolding - about what might have appeared to some, at least initially, as a mere "episode from the coast" but in truth involves the entire world, joined in mourning and in an urgent reckoning with what Timothy Morton has called "the ecological thought." Today, at the time of writing, a rapid internet search informs me that there is a demonstration going on in Shinjuku, "to evacuate the children from Fukushima." Conrad's "Typhoon" seems, in certain respects, uncannily prescient of aspects of what can still perhaps hardly be given a name. There are numerous weird correlations - fitting or "out of joint" (like "the time," in Hamlet's phrase), fitting and out of joint - from the Chinamen battened down in that ship coming from the far ends of the world to the so-called "Fukushima Fifty," described in a recent article in the Guardian newspaper as "Shunned: the heroes who saved Japan" (McCurry 21), from the blithe enthusiasm for shopping at the end of "Typhoon" (69) to the Japanese government's current attempt "to resell the nuclear dream" (to quote Justin McCurry in that Guardian report) (21). If "Typhoon" is an episode from "the coast of the Great Beyond" about the experience of "the entire world" whirled in "a black gully," in "the pit," in the "awful depth" of "a hollow" that "nobody was to know," there is an additional hollow in the work. It follows shortly after the remark (made in the voice, that is to say the double voicing of Captain MacWhirr and the so-called "nar- rator") that "the worst was to come, then" (61). I am referring to the formidable ellipsis whereby this "worst" is missing from the text. With the coming in of the typhoon in full force we are given to read virtually nothing. Regarding the prospective loss of the Captain's ship, everything is collapsed into a single litotic, five-word sentence at the end of section V: "He was spared that annoyance" (65). "Typhoon" thus encrypts "the worst to come," and hauntingly inscribes a figure of the traumatic as what comes back. As Derrida remarks in Philosophy in a Time of Terror , "traumatism is produced by the future , by the to comey by the threat of the worst to come, rather than by an aggression that is over and done with'" ("Autoimmunity" 97, emph. Derrida's).</page><page sequence="25">I Nicholas Royle ! 65 ! Seaford, East Sussex 23 February 2013 This essay, episodic and epistolary in structure, was originally delivered as a lecture at the University of Hitotsubashi, Tokyo, in March 2013, on the eve of the second anniver- sary of what some call "3/11," others "Fukushima," others simply "the earthquake." I am very grateful to Asako Nakai, Satoshi Ukai, and Nozomi Uematsu for inviting me to speak on this occasion. This essay appears in Mosaic for the first time in English. NOTES 1/ Inevitably, the following pages make only a preliminary and fragmentary contribution to an exploration of these issues. For some further reflections, in particular apropos Conrad's "Amy Foster," see "Even the Title: On the State of Narrative Theory Today" ( Narrative 22.1 [2014]: 1-16. Print). 2/ For the notion of transegmental drifting, see Garrett Stewart's remarkable study, Reading Voices: Literature and the Phonotext (Berkeley: U of California P, 1990), especially 25 and 293-94. He proffers an appropriately striking instance in Heart of Darkness: "When the helmsman in Heart of Darkness is fatally speared through the chest, 'the luster of inquiring glance faded swiftly into vacant glassiness.' Conrad's phrasing produces a paronomastic gradience that suggests fatal blankness as merely a hairbreadth away from the stare of life, and this even at the textual surface - as if death were the transition precipitated by the 'lance' hiding in the elided noun of 'inquiring glance'" (220).
