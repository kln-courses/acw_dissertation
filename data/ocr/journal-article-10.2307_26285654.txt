Le Guin, "It Was a Dark and Stormy Night; Or, Why Are We Huddling About the Campfire?" In the quotation above, Ursula Le Guin recommends "tak[ing] the tale in your teeth . . . [with the hope that] it's not poison." Teeter ing between the past and the futuristic novel, Le Guin hopes the nar rative might bring with it a cultural communion at the end of its journey. But Teresa de Lauretis, in Alice Doesn't, confirms the toxicolo gist's dread that the tale is poison. At the top of her now oft-quoted chapter on desire in narrative, de Lauretis posts this warning from Laura Mulvey: "sadism demands a story" (qtd. in de Lauretis 103). Returning to both the mythical and the psychoanalytic Oedipus, de Lauretis traces the gendering processes in narratives that "waylay" women. The hero, the subject of the story, is masculinized, and the object of his quest is femininized. Caught in the web of oedipalization, the narrative can only lead to a bad end for women. They can never get in the driver's seat of narrative action.

Ending her chapter with a poem from Muriel Rukeyser ("Myth") that tells of a later encounter between the Sphinx and Oedipus, de Lauretis quotes this exchange: "'When I asked, What walks on four legs in the morning, two at noon, and three in the evening, you answered, Man. You didn't say anything about woman.' 'When you say Man,' said Oedipus, 'You include women too. Everyone knows that.' She said, 'That's what you think'" (157). Although de Lauretis critiques narrative, she cannot imagine anything but narrative, suggesting, then, the disruptive strategy for women to be "narrative with a vengeance." In other words, narra tive with a vengeance suggests taking the tale in your teeth and deploy ing its poison elsewhere. Rather than remaining within this bleak, pathological environment for fictional production, women might rather look to altered states of fiction for a healing process. Poisoned by the story, as it structured gendered roles in the cultural imagination, women might reel happily away from the traditional conventions of narrative into a new technol ogy of writing, which disrupts the linear hold not only of the story, but also of its engine—print culture. Hypertext fiction offers myriad alter native conditions to the narrative regime: multiple paths through the fictional terrain that break with the linear path of story: online collec tive authorship, which opens out the singularized production in the direction of new, accretional possibilities; and an electronic environ ment which adds new dimensions to earlier conventions of time and space. These are only a few of the possibly healing properties hyper text fiction might offer women. As readers and writers, they may dis cover a new "freedom of choice" as they happily click among multiple screen links rather than trudge along the forced march of print. All together, these functions comprise the sense of an interactive environ ment. In contrast to what de Lauretis has described as the gendering of subject and object positions, this interactive environment promotes an exchange of agency, which makes those once-rigid positions more porous and interchangeable. Moreover, collective production offers the discovery of different voices within the subject position. Understanding how a subject position, or something like subjec tivity, appears within electronic flow, however, both opens up new pos sibilities and offers itself up to the reinscription of traditional narrative strategies. The new mode of production might also find itself operat</page><page sequence="3">Case 633 ing within the same old cultural imaginary that once told the tale. Memories of gendered operations might haunt the new forms, rein scribing old traditions onto new experiments. An ambivalent form of fiction appears, bearing traces of promised relief from the same old story, while also making a nostalgic return to its gendered structures. There are many examples of this process on the Net and in the print lore that imagines the Net. Here, however, I would like to turn to one that writes its ambivalence into its fictive world through both its struc ture and its controlling tropes. Apple, Write! The project is entitled My name is scibe. It is a collaboratively cre ated hypertext by (in order of appearances) Judy Malloy, Tom Igoe, Chris Abraham, and others. Malloy informs the reader in her opening title screen that she devised this project while in a rehabilitation cen ter, where she was recovering from a terrible accident. She claims that she was suffering great physical pain and lay isolated "with no human contact." So she asked others to come to her aid in producing an online fiction to help her through the difficult healing process. Malloy's set-up resonates with other currently popular tropes, such as the movie The English Patient, where the near-dysfunctional body, burnt beyond recognition, is hauled through the desert on the backs of camels (like the Pentateuch itself) to become the site of the production of a story. The relationship between the wounded, disabled, unrecog nizable body in pain and the spinning of the narrative seems capable of carrying great cultural weight at this time. Perhaps it captures the new, ancillary role assigned to the body in virtual space. The body is still ref erenced while its condition is transcended. As wounded, the body is imagined as restricting agency, performing incapacity. In the case of Malloy's call to the electronic to compensate for this incapacity, the medium is inscribed with potency and fertility. This trope of the body in pain, which incites narrative, invites a gendering of the body and of the responses to it. As scibe, Malloy's body is displaced by a pattern of electronic sig nals through two chosen sites: Arts Wire and The Well. Unlike the sere desert of The English Patient, or the isolation of a rehab unit, these elec tronic sites promise productivity and fertility. The Well and Arts Wire</page><page sequence="4">634 Eve's Apple, or Women's Narrative Bytes notoriously draw creative and interesting messages to their servers. Virtual space transcends failed flesh. My name is scibe begins, if you click "forward," with the following screen: My name is scibe, I asked for scribe, but the wizards sent back scibe. Perhaps there was already a scribe on Lambda Moo. Or, perhaps I asked for scibe. I don't spell very well. After the accident I began to remember inaccurately. Scibe begins by offering a clever play on authorship within electronic processes. Asking for a name in order to enter the dialogue is a com mon practice "on the boards." The initiate petitions an unmarked operation of the server to be assigned an identity within its virtual space. In this case, it "names" the author herself, perhaps misrecogniz ing her petition or refusing it. She ponders on the cause: her own typ ing error, a mark of her keyboard habits, or the préexistence of a scribe, which preordains its singularity of signature. "Scibe" is not the scribe she would want to be, but something proximate. The naming of the "protagonist" is thus caught in the Net, as is authorship itself, altered within the conditions of electronic writing. The engine of inscription is no longer the "tool" of authorship, but an active player in the process. Authorship is "in the Net," then, organizing a kind of sub ject position there. Malloy has set up the sense of an interactive sub ject position, both as author and as protagonist in the response and call form of the fiction-making. Likewise, those who respond share the position as subject, but only on the Net. As the subject position begins to emerge as an effect of the Net, so does the sense of narrative. The linear process of story is both emu lated and simulated by the mode of collective production on the Net: 2nd screen My story is as true as any story that telnets from csl.org to csn.org to well.sf.ca.us to tmn.com to uclink.berkeley.edu to there are undoubtedly other nodes where I can take my mind that I have forgotten</page><page sequence="5">Case 635 my body is in a place they call rehabilitation I call it hell. Instead of a narrative line, this screen offers a genealogy of sites on the Net. The story seems to travel and to accrete itself through this travel. Accretion replaces plot line as the signature of fiction-writing on the Net. The traditional linear ordering of time and space gives way to an absorptive electronic space, eddying different places into a common pool, which, while emulating the sequential in sites, overcomes its tem poral axis. Malloy's call for company also promises an accretional, col lecting cultural production. However, while Malloy calls for collective authorship, she nevertheless constructs an "I" that is traveling through these sites, continuing to reference her singular body. The trope of the body in "hell" continues to provoke the flight through electronic sig nals. In this way, nostalgia for origins haunts the new migrant housing. Thus, while the Net offers a radical new way to construct a fic tion, with nodes arriving from varying sites, linking in multiple ways, nostalgia for the traditional functions and cultural associations of nar rative continues to mark its mode. The wounded female body pro motes a call and response mode of production that is gendered. For it is men, or at least the names of men, who respond to Malloy's call. As in The English Patient, the heteronormative couple, emanating from the site of a wounded body, produce the story and mark the production of fiction with traditional gender roles. The accretional flow through sites constitutes the most radical of Net processes. It is within this stricture that something like a new sub ject position, or even subjectivity, may be situated. The ambivalence it is capable of producing between data flow and flesh, in itself, conjoins the two orders. Caught up in the data flow, the flesh, as referent, cre ates an oscillation between accretional fertility and material loss. Per haps the operative wound to the body resides in this promise of electronic collectivity and random response. At the same time, dura tion, marked in scibe by the trope of recuperation in a rehabilitation unit, is confounded by the elastic time processes of the electronic Net Several print novels have celebrated this conjunction as a new form of subjectivity. One of the most recent, mainstream accounts may be found in William Gibson's Idoru. Within a heady confluence of postna tional identities, all converging in Japan (the imaginary of future-tech), the process of constructing celebrity narrates just how subjectivity may</page><page sequence="6">636 Eve's Apple, or Women's Narrative Bytes be inscribed within data flow. An aging rock star, Rez (his group is called Lo/Rez to underscore the pun on resolution), whose celebrity status is of the old order—enduring and of great magnitude—is chal lenged by the new sense that the referent of cultural production may accrete, then disappear. The new mode of celebrity is an effect of the electronic rather than its source. Rez, the person, the fleshly referent of celebrity is already beginning to shrink in comparison to the Rez his fans are constructing within Internet exchange. As a product of elec tronic accretion, celebrity acts "as a subtle fluid . . . prone now to accrete, under specific conditions" and then dissolve (7). Celebrity, in this sense, animates an effect like subjectivity in the flow as the sign of Rez's aging rock-star body remains obdurate in its constitution. To underscore how celebrity is a mode of new Net subjectivity, Gibson introduces a character named Laney (interesting pun) who can read subjectivity in data flow, recognizing the "nodal points" of some thing like "presence" within the electronic trail of Net activity. So Gib son sets up this new, emerging subjectivity on the Net against the aging flesh. His resolution lies in the age-old trope of a marriage. Rez is determined to "marry" an idoru—a celebrity constructed entirely of data flow—a "living" nodal point. Gibson thus feminizes Net flow and masculinizes fleshly bulk.1 The idoru is a sort of hologram that can absorb images and data into itself, gaining agency within the flow. She is pure simulacrum, pure informational collectivity, defined by her flow. Her feminization is reminiscent of how sirens were once imagined as luring sailors onto reefs—absorptive, destructive figures who mislead the traveler, destroying his craft. Gibson's print novel joins the elec tronic scibe to narrativize digital flow through a gendered, romantic vision of subjectivity. The heteronormative model is used to control the new subject position and to determine, through traditional social structures, how subjectivity might be governed within the flow. At the same time, the body is successfully wedded to the Net in a trope that obfuscates its ultimate demise. The fleshly Rez is already out of date. His seeming marriage is actually a capitulation. De Lauretis locates the binding of story onto gender and sexual ity in the ancient model of Oedipus and in the power of that myth's organizing principles to continue in the imaginary of twentieth-century Western culture. Another ancient myth binds the ordering of time and</page><page sequence="7">Case 637 space to the efficacy of the narrative string, implying gender and het eronormative processes in its production. As the ancients told it, there was a maze: the figure of border confusions between inside and out. The maze was the figure that would make of spatial confusion a tem poral journey. During the duration of traversing the maze, humans became confused, lost, and finally devoured, for inside that maze was a monster born of intercourse between a woman and a beast. The mon ster, a special cyborg, half man/half beast, was called the minotaur. Now, Ariadne devised a solution for overcoming the outside/inside confusion that somehow led to a man/beast amalgam. She gave a long thread to Theseus so that he might successfully transit the confusions of the maze in order to slay the minotaur. Hence, the narrative thread itself—the discovery of story, a linear path through deadly exchanges— marks the freeing up of Greek civilization from its monstrous mazes. At the same time, it slays cross-species desire and disciplines any space/time cavorting into a regimented march. As the minotaur is slain and the maze is conquered, the string outlines inside/outside and aligns male hero/female aide to deter unnatural gender/sexual/spatial prac 2 tices. Women, then, are disciplined out of the subject position as linear impositions discipline the orders of time and space. Bipolar order takes hold in many dimensions. The orders are codependent, linked, or articulated (as Stuart Hall would put it) in such a way as to ensnare women in a narrative net that seems to be produced by the entire old "world order."3 In addition to the nostalgia such itineraries perform of narrative and gendered myths, the anxiety around collective production and the maintenance of individualism also play into this confluence. In the sec ond screen of scibe, one could also perceive the flow from "csl.org to csn.org to uclink.berkeley.edu" as a record of the new ways in which commercial ventures and cultural ones are linked. The story accretes its meaning as it moves through commercial and academic sites— places where capital provides workers with technological prowess and know-how. The Critical Art Ensemble, a group that writes collective works on technology, describes hypertext as "living the dream of cap italism that is still being refined in the area of manufacture" (114). For them, reading hypertext simulates</page><page sequence="8">638 Eve's Apple, or Women's Narrative Bytes [t]he Japanese notion of "just in time delivery," in which the units of assembly are delivered to the assembly line just as they are called for.... In such a system, there is no seden tary capital, but a constant flow of raw commodities In this way, production, distribution, and consumption are imploded into a single act, with no beginning and end, just unbroken circulation. In the same manner, the online text flows in an unbroken stream through the electronic net work. (114) In other words, part of the "narrative" pleasure emulated by this text as it moves from site to site, resides in the "living dream of capitalism" that manufacturing might produce without pause, making money work at all times. Moreover, this particular hypertext fiction dreams of the easy connection between commercial sites and the academy—org and edu—that new collusions of the academy with the commercial adminis trations are currently putting into effect. As material value becomes information, cultural production and manufacturing will be drawn closer together, with fewer differences in modes or even pools of capital. While this new union is hoped for among many of these orgs and edus, it is precisely what publishing companies fear. This electronic form of collective text, which is not based on originality or single source "closes the gap between production and consumption, and opens the industry to those other than the literary celebrity. If the industry is unable to differentiate its product through the spectacle of originality and uniqueness, its profitability collapses" (Critical Ensemble 115). Malloy's text seems to celebrate the way in which accidents com mon to electronic communication ("scibe") or decisions at the server take the text-making process away from authorial intent. Likewise, its "flow" marks its potential to "dream." In contrast, print production today "slows down production, while it speeds up media advertising, creating celebrities" (Critical Ensemble 115). Gibson's Idoru, then, is right on target, placing celebrity at the center of how cultural produc tion and intellectual property will survive within the electronic. Collective production, after decades of anticommunism, can only seem a frightening prospect for the future. Subjectivity, the subject position, identified as individual, with the attendant notion of intellec tual property, is threatened by this flow, requiring the slower processes of publishing and the accelerated ones of celebrity advertising to keep</page><page sequence="9">Case 639 it intact. On the other side, the collapse of cultural and material pro duction has frightening consequences as well. The loss of the academy's relative autonomy from corporate ownership seems configured in this flow and thus leads to the reconfiguration of culture into corporately produced entertainment Unfortunately, many of the critics who would stem this "flow" produce unhelpful conclusions, as Sven Birkerts in his book The Gutenberg Elegies illustrates: "My core fear is that we are, as a culture, as a species, becoming shallower: that we have turned from depth—from the Judeo-Christian premise of unfathomable mystery— and are adapting ourselves to the ersatz security of a vast lateral con nectedness" (228). It seems nostalgia is the controlling principle of history at this particular juncture. Johnny Appleseed Others, closer to electronic production, deploy references to "nature" in promoting forms of linking materials in the electronic field. Avoiding considerations linked to manufacture and economic struc tures, they seek to devise an electronic space that is more "ecological," in hopes of maintaining a culturally satisfying interface. Subject-object relations are between the user and the software, rather than within the flow itself. Rather than economic hierarchies, hierarchies of power are situated in the interface itself, which reinscribes the relation between user and software within an unequal distribution of power. In other words, apart from consideration of just how orgs and edus are linked, the user's relation to the "flow" may inure him or her to an object status in the interface. Simon Penny deploys just such a sense of "nature" in modes of electronic circuitry to surpass "[a]n interactive work as currently conceived ... as pre-set responses to user naviga tion through an ossified database" (65). Penny regards this current form as being "firmly within the Top-Down camp... " (65). Moreover, its form of interaction, completely designed for the user, participates in a "deterministic paradigm" in which "exchange" is simply that of bits (65-66). Instead, Penny offers "a contingent and unconnected chain of triggers" (66). He offers the example of a piece called Boids by Craig Reynolds, in which, rather than animating a cartoon flock of birds, Reynolds equipped "a virtual space with terrestrial physics and</page><page sequence="10">640 Eve's Apple, or Women's Narrative Bytes equipped individual 'boids' with some basic flocking behavior" (66). Speculating on Reynolds's work, Penny imagines "a self-evolving user interface, in which the environment it adapted to was the habits and interests of the individual user. . . . [Y]ou'd never know what your interface would look like" (66). This would make art practice "a virtual horticulture" of "evolutionary models" (67). The artist is not making the surface of the work, or its present appearance, but is creating an environment with possibilities and constraints in which things "grow." Within this environment, the user has more agency—the interface is more permeable to an exchange of subject/object positions, rather than deterministically dominating the user. The fictive element is freed from emulation of narrative strings or other traditional forms. But it is freed by virtue of a mimetic relationship to the "laws of nature." Penny addresses the question of mimesis. He proffers a systematic rather than optical nemesis: "Numerous works employ 'nature' not as a rep resentation but in the structure of the systems: biological growth algo rithms, simulated ecosystems or communities, genetic algorithms, neural networks" (67). While Penny cannily notes that he has instru mentalized a very particular notion of evolution, he still maintains that this form of interface offers a more liberative interface for the user (68). Malloy's set-up of call and response does seem more structurally naive than Penny's suggestion. For scibe still retains a passive role of sorts for the "reader." Its sense of experimentation lies in the realm of production rather than use. Penny's "ecological" model seeks to bring a greater sophistication into the structure of the interface itself. The Many Faces of Eve My name is scibe only illustrates one of many forms women's writ ing takes in the new forms of hypertext fiction. It exists within a field of experiments. Fan/celebrity functions are prominent, with pages for authors such as Rita Mae Brown. Photos, biographies, bibliographies, and redactions of narratives lure the reader toward the print books by celebrity authors.4 As in the Gibson novel, they bring, say, Rita Mae Brown into the Net, where her status is discussed as well as sightings of her "live" body, etc. Lesbian "fans" are created and produced by these sites, circulating their identity through confusions of celebrity.</page><page sequence="11">Case 641 The "grrl" phenomenon is so inclusive that it really requires an article of its own, but let me make just a few notes toward its con struction. "Grrl" is the '90s angry, aggressive term that would over write the earlier feminist creation of "womyn." The misspelling plays with the gender assignment, in this case putting an aggressive "grr" in the middle of it. It comes from the club scene of postpunk bands. There are numerous "grrl" sites on the Net. One offers an interesting combination of serial photography and comix. "The Adventures of Cybergrrl" allows the user to trace its narrative through episodes of luminous photos etched against a dark surround or through comix episodes in the Lichtenstein mode. "Grrl" emerges from the realms of the dark, unknown "cyber," where she wanders alone and frightened until she finds a butch-looking female friend to rescue her. Certain of the data at this site can be accessed only after filling out a question naire, which asks the user's salary, level of education, etc. Another screen advertises for sponsors, using this information to lure prospect ing producers to a site visited by women with middle incomes and edu cations. The fiction is securely buried within a commercial enterprise. The pleasure is immediately commodified by the design of the site. Yet it does present a liberatory fantasy for women confronting the cyber as solo, aggressive, active subjects, supported by other women. Is it simply, as Donald Lowe suggests in The Body in Late Capitalist USA, that any identity, or identification, such as that of women/feminism, has become a decontextualized sign for a lifestyle, in the service of a prod uct (67)? It may be that this "grrl" site, evolving from the club-fan scene, is friendlier to the process of commodification, presuming its participation in constructing a subculture. In one sense, it is more sophisticated about the power of the market and less naive about imagining "alternative" cultures. Still, there are other sites that seem less invested in commodify ing their pleasures. Interestingly, their relation to a "cause" or "iden tity" is more obtuse. Their mode of referencing the material is one of an indirect, complex construction. For example, one of the sites con structed around the issues of Brandon Teena, as she is known among transgender circles, or Teena Brandon by the press, exemplifies how the user's knowledge of the issues is presumed and circulated through images and words that refer to Brandon only within their second or</page><page sequence="12">642 Eve's Apple, or Women's Narrative Bytes third tier of associations. Brandon, a poor white who lived in the Mid west, pursued a life of cross-gender identification, passing as a boy/man in rural Nebraska towns. As a boy, "she" seduced many women, pub licly performing their erotic relationship in bars and on the streets. Brandon's lovers were often the sought-after beauties of their towns, making Brandon the object of envy among many of the men. The social environment in these towns was conservative about gender identifica tion and heteronormative sexual relations. It was not attuned to the new, liberative environment surrounding sexual orientation and trans sexual operations, which is common in many urban centers. Eventually, some violent men discovered Brandon's "true" gender and brutally murdered her in a homophobic, sexist rage (see Dunne). The trial became a cause célèbre for various groups in support of transgender identification. The multiple sites on the Net dedicated to discussions about Brandon cycle her story through broader discussions of trans gender choices. At the Brandon link within the Banff Centre site, however, the user discovers a chart called "Teatrum Anatomicum," which consists of a circle bisected by two lines.5 Divided on the horizontal plane are the terms: meat market/operation table on one side and virtue trial/dis secting lessons on the other. At the lower corner, there is a mark of "authorship" by Shu Lea Cheang, 1996. Cheang is a noted lesbian video artist, whose montage-like videos explore interracial dynamics. Click ing around the chart, one can go to a "rape in cyberspace" document, a simulated MOO, and chatlines. One screen offers a photomontage of parts of a photo of Brandon, overwritten by drawings of a penis or dildo, along with words pasted in from newspaper headlines surround ing the case, such as: "SHE'S A HE," "Identity charade ended," "Romance, Deceit, Rage," and "Cross-dresser killed." Another screen offers the ground plan for the "Teatrum Anatomicum," which reveals a circular operating theater with the words "spectacle, surveillance, dis course" at its center. The screen "web tripping" is another collage with a close-up shot of a nipple next to the term "doll space." At the top, "doll yoke" is followed by "@ gender Female doll, @describe me as Gender set to female, and Your Pronouns: she, her, hers, herself." The website offers various screens of montage, indirectly sug gesting Brandon in an environment, citing the strict regime of gender identification, the collusion of medical practices with surveillance and</page><page sequence="13">Case 643 spectacle, and the inscription of pronouns onto body parts. Even the screen entitled "the shooting gallery" does not directly reference Bran don's execution-style murder, by two bullets to the brain, but shows, instead, a collage environment of "surgical alterations" alongside close ups of a doll's anatomy. The work is neither a documentation nor a fic tion of Brandon's situation. As a montage, it combines the two orders to construct a third term, "theatricum anatomicum," which refers both to new medical constructions of sex-assignment surgery within an environment of cross-gender identification and the spectacle of gender within the social "screen." Navigating the semiotics of the site pre sumes knowledge of both current activist causes in the transgender movement and the critiques that write them out. Rather than upload ing or inviting linear narration, this site constructs a sort of Fou cauldian "archaeology of sexuality." It would not be fair to set a site that may have to support its own efforts by seeking producers, such as "Cybergrrl," against the oppor tunities for cyber-artists provided by the Banff Centre—one of the most generous and prominent producers of the new cyber-arts. Some thing like "high" and "low" cultural assumptions begin to emerge from such comparisons, which would be unhelpful in imagining a liberatory terrain of cultural production for women in the Web. CD Novel Websites and Internet fictions are only two of several forms of hypertext fiction. Another major form is the CD-ROM, into which many novels are currently being translated. Uploading traditional linear narratives into the linked format may serve neither the novel nor the format itself. The pleasures of the page and of linear construction may only become degraded when cut into screen-sized bytes or strung through the slings and arrows of scrolling. By now, however, numerous original works have been created for the CD-ROM format, inventing a new form for the novel. Their fictive pleasure is designed to move through clicking on objects to enter a variety of other kinds of screen spaces. A sense of a new form of the novel, which predated the invention of hypertext, also heralded its properties as vital to the continuing effi cacy of the novel form in the twentieth century. In 1956, Alain Robbe</page><page sequence="14">644 Eve's Apple, or Women's Narrative Bytes Grillet, author of several novels that established the nouvelle vague (new wave) movement in France, wrote a seminal essay entitled "A Future for the Novel." Key to his notion of a novel form that would break with traditional nineteenth-century conceptions was a new role for "objects" to play in regard to the creation of character and narra tive. Robbe-Grillet insisted that, in traditional novels, "objects and ges tures forming the very fabric of the plot disappeared completely, leaving behind only their significations: the empty chair became only absence or expansion ..." (20). In other words, in the novel, objects had no pertinence in themselves, no power in the telling. They were simply used as relays of reference for the development either of plot and character or of the broader meaning of the novel. Against this practice, Robbe-Grillet imagined that in the "future universe of the novel, gestures and objects will be there ..." (21). He perceived objects as working in the manner of evidence in a detective case—a place to which any narrative, or, indeed, character, must return. Objects would become the endpoint of the referential relay rather than its source. They would constitute a there, which would never be "transcended in the direction of a profound human truth, a morality, or a metaphysic" (42). Fittingly, Robbe-Grillet's novel L'année dernière à Marienbad (Last Year at Marienbad) became a classic underground film, in which the camera obsessively returns to certain places within the hotel at Marienbad. That return is what constitutes the form of the film. The hallways, the rooms, the furniture locate agency in the film. Camera movement through their locations constitutes something like narrative flow. Robbe-Grillet understood cinema to strengthen what the tradi tional novel had weakened: "in the cinema one sees the chair, the movement of the hand. . . . [W]hat affects us, what remains in our memory, what appears as essential and irreducible to vague intellectual concepts are the gestures themselves, the objects ..(20). In his novel Jalousie (the term for a kind of window blind as well as jealousy), the window seems to do the looking. It navigates the excruciating distance between desire and its unobtainable object. Hypertext fiction breaks with the traditional novel in the manner Robbe-Grillet proffered within print. By setting images, or gestures, within a print text as the sites, as the gateways to other screens, they take on the kind of power Robbe-Grillet sought for them. It is the</page><page sequence="15">Case 645 object to which the user must obsessively return in order to navigate the fiction. Even if that object is print of another color, the phrase or word takes on a role as an integer, a discrete unit within the text that emulates the role of object. Text, cartoon, photograph, or even a brief video establishes a sense of "presence" obdurate to signification through its function. Whether Robbe-Grillet was actually capable of escaping the processes of anthropomorphism in his novels is debatable. It was his desire to do so that was most prescient. The CD-ROM ver sion of Mauve Desert provides an example of how objects may work to their full functional and lyrical potential. They signify, but without giving way to a different order of signification. Mauve Desert Adriene Jenik was kind enough to allow me to preview her CD ROM version of Nicole Brassard's novel, Mauve Desert. Jenik is known as a lesbian/activist/video-maker, whose works explore lesbian interra cial desire alongside avant-garde interventions into video production. For this reason, I was eager to discover how she would treat a work by Brassard, who enjoys the status of a literary icon in some Canadian and American literary circles and especially among lesbian critics. Like Jenik, Brassard's works invent new strategies of representation within tradi tional genres, such as the novel and poetry. This particular novel has several features that render it apt for translation into the new format. In fact, translation is a key force in the construction of the print novel Mauve Desert. The first section opens onto a title page of a novel entitled Mauve Desert by the fictive author, Laure Angstelle. Here, the story is told. The second part is "A Book to Translate," in which a translator, Maude Laures, becomes fascinated with the novel and drawn into the process of its translation. The organization of part three, "Places and Things," is perhaps most similar to the CD-ROM format, which operates by clicking among places and things. Brassard describes "The Revolver," "The Car," "The Motel," etc. A section on "Characters" follows, which includes a mock-up of a file folder, open ing onto a series of photos of the character Longman. "Dimensions" follows, and finally, the novel concludes with the full "translation" of the first story now entitled Mauve the Horizon. Both the foregrounding of translation and the division into things</page><page sequence="16">646 Eve's Apple, or Women's Narrative Bytes and characters would seem to suggest that Jenik might simply upload such a novel, providing the reader with the option to click among these already discrete sites at will, thus amplifying the novel's own structure with the functions of hypertext. Instead, jenik has created her own sophisticated impression of the world of the novel, citing its passages in several ways as part of the terrain of its fictive world. Her CD-ROM version both reflects her own obsession with the Brossard novel, as translator, and offers another complete translation of the novel. These elements of the novel function as leitmotifs through the links. Even the interface between print and the new format is foregrounded. Jenik both emulates the print novel and performs her distance from its medium in her "translation." The opening screen reveals a blinking motel sign, Mauve Desert, accompanied by the sounds of crickets and passing cars. Since the action of Brossard's story occurs in cheap motels in the desert, this seems an apt representation of the novel as terrain. A fragment of the text, in French, may be seen in the background, somewhat obscured by the sign. Various "driving instructions" introduce the text if you choose to visit "navigation." The reader is instructed to "follow your instincts, along with sound and sight" to "signify when you can choose to move on to another screen." The screens, then, must be explored for the object that will animate the narrative movement. They offer a field of different possibilities among which the user is free to choose. Then the warning: "Just as Melanie [the protagonist of the storyline] is learning the consequences of her actions, so you will learn that these exist, even in interactive media." The "freedom of choice" so widely pro claimed by those who would elevate hypertext environments by plac ing them in proximity to "democratic processes" have consequences here—not the kind of sequential sense of consequences which pro ceed through cause and effect, but those produced by proximity. For the desert is not only a kind of lyric place, which occasions "mauve" passages in Brossard's writing and lyric videos of cacti and distant hori zons in the CD-ROM, but it is also where nuclear test sites and waste dumps are located. Proximity to these sites brings contamination, rep resented in both the novel and the CD-ROM by the character "Long man," who performs a kind of "Oppenheimer effect." On the CD-ROM, certain sites prompt the "Longman" to appear, as he does in the novel, through a series of black and white still photographs. He</page><page sequence="17">Case 647 contaminates the "freedom" and "security" one enjoys, while clicking through the hypertext environment, as the federal projects of nuclear testing and waste dumps have contaminated the desert. In contrast to emulating narrative movement as if by a process of contamination, the CD-ROM version of the text keeps returning to screens that display pages of the print novel as if to a loved object The print pages are underlined and otherwise marked with signs indicating favorite, oft-read passages. One screen is dedicated to the author, Brossard. It includes photos of her in full "butch" drag, accompanied by the sounds of deep breathing, suggesting intense desire. The appear ance of Brossard is marked by the panting of the creator of the CD ROM. Letters and faxes between Jenik and Brossard further evidence a kind of "crush" on the author and on the work. The CD-ROM ver sion performs an obsession with the text and with Brossard more than any simple replication of the text itself could. It is these same elements that mark desire, which also enable a "lesbian" reading of the CD ROM to be performed. Other signs that help to confirm this reading are books in the library with titles suggesting a lesbian reading of Brassard's work, videos of the production of the CD-ROM with Jenik and her butch lover in the scenes, and, ultimately, the central image that "drives" the text: a young "grrl" with a backwards baseball cap and tattoos driving a car. This "grrl" is the major image to navigate the user through the hypertext links. The user is positioned behind the girl, able to see videos of passing desert landscapes through the windshield. Only the girl's eyes are reflected in the rearview mirror. Clicking on the girl's hand, the user can tune in the radio, where translations of the print novel can be heard in French, English, and Spanish, or open the glove compartment, which contains a gun, maps, notebooks, etc. The image of the girl in the car constructs a there, the primary evidence to which all the reading returns. She occupies the center of every page of the text. Her image organizes the interface between the user of the CD ROM and the print version. She is Melanie, the protagonist in the novel-within-the-novel. As interface, the image represents the way in which a protagonist of a novel leads the reader through a text. She performs the role of protagonist. But this image is also the intersection through which various screens must pass. As the user aids her deci sions by moving her arm, she becomes complicit in the decisions. On</page><page sequence="18">648 Eve's Apple, or Women's Narrative Bytes another level, she is a hot-looking "grrl," who represents a young dyke on the move. Her eyes are looking back at the user. Clicking on her eyes occasions videos of her memories, including a fight with her mother and a slow dance with another woman. The user can also manipulate one of Melanie's hands to point to the words in the print text. As if reading, then, through Melanie, the reader points to the words in sentences already underlined or other wise marked by another reader—presumably the creator of the CD ROM. One heavily marked passage reads: "reality was rushing by . .. huge in her breasts, ten times ... her loins, onto her thighs." Reading the passage, one can then maneuver the screen to play a video of the passing desert, replete with the sounds of crickets. You are driving through the terrain of the novel as through the terrain of the obsessed reader. The young "grrl's" eyes in the rearview mirror are looking back at you. The situation is coded with a desire that is distributed across several different orders of function, suture, and gesture. Jenik's CD-ROM version of Mauve Desert brilliantly re-produces much of the lyricism of the novel and its obtuse organization of ele ments. It produces the suggestion of lesbian desire without depicting it in a literal manner. There is no suggestion of heteronormativity in the content or images on the disk and no traditional ordering of elements in the production of its fiction. Its hypertext elements are used accord ing to their own design, even foregrounding their production in videos that record the shooting of the scenes and in the reproduction of notes to Brossard about the process. The pleasures of the text are located neither in plot nor in character, but in an obsession with a prior print text that performs its own obsession with a depiction of a particular terrain and images of people and things within it. The desert offers both Brossard and Jenik what Robbe-Grillet developed in Marienbad. The objects themselves represent agency and sites of desire without giving way to an abstract signification. Their "presence" produces an obsessive return in the reader or user. As a landscape in itself, one that is both contaminated and satu rated with lyric beauty, the Mauve Desert is an apt terrain for women to explore within the new format of hypertext environments. Certain uses of technology are contaminated—dangerous by proximity. Yet they also provide new opportunities for a liberation from nineteenth century traditions of fiction-making. The desert is sere and yet full of</page><page sequence="19">Case 649 blooming cacti. It is not a terrain to excite the production of narrative, or the wounding of the body, as in The English Patient, but a terrain to be explored for its alternative sites, never free from contamination, but promising as a place set somewhat distant from the old machinery of gender and heteronormativity. Notes I. In an interview, Gibson refers to the actual idorus in Japan as "girls" who produce a factory-line production of music for CDs (see Rosen berg). He exchanges this underpaid workforce of women for a femi nized data flow. 2.
