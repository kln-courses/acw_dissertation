<plain_text><page sequence="1">Maya Textiles of Guatemala. By Margot Blum Schevill. Austin: University of Texas Press, 1993. 295pp. Colour and b/w illus. ISBN 0 292 75143 5. This comprehensive work deals in detail with the material culture of the Mayan people, with particular reference to their clothing. It is principally an anthropological study and the major part of the book consists of an illustrated cata- logue of the collection of textiles in the Eisen collection held by the Hearst Museum of Anthropology at Berkeley Califor- nia. Gustavus A. Eisen was an anthropologist who, in 1902, was hired to go to Guatemala by Phoebe Apperson Hearst to investigate sources of ancient jades, discover potential archaeological sites and collect Indian clothing and artefacts. The 222 textiles and textile related objects which he brought back are the focus of this book. The textiles themselves, together with Eisen's photographs and notes, provide a unique insight into the social and working life of the Maya in Guatemala at this period. In addition to the catalogue raisonnd, which is particularly well illustrated, mainly in colour, there are five essays which establish the context of the collection and discuss communication in cloth and clothing, the influence of fashion on the Maya textiles. There is an interesting thesis on the idea of a collection as an artefact in itself and the way in which collections, both personal and museum, can reflect the attitudes and social customs of the times.

This is also linked to the cosmological view of women as mother- weavers, and the anthropomorphic view of the loom is discussed along with the connection of weaving with fertility and childbirth. A review of past, current and future research into the Guatemalan Maya adds further context to the Eisen collection. The book is a model of its type and an example to all historians and ethnographers in the way in which all available sources should be used in the study and presenta- tion of material culture. C.
