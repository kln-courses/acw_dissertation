See my book, Nothing Less than Literal: Architecture After Minimalism (MIT Press, 2005), for the details of this argu- ment. Contrary to the all too common criticism, architecture can never be "too literal." Over and over we hear critics say, as if sophistication always trumps the obvious and subtlety always beats crudity, "I like what you're trying to do but it's too lit- eral." Pve come to believe that 90 percent of the time what the critic really means is that the work is too reductive , and the problem is not that it's too literal but that it's not literal enough . If architects would aspire to produce work that is nothing less than literal, they would cease to perpetuate a peculiar denial that is deeply imprinted on the architect's psyche and embedded in the discipline's techniques and dis- courses. We architects have innumerable design processes and modes of interpretation and representation that are extraordinarily effective at masking architecture's most salient, and sometimes salacious, means and effects: its liter- alness. That denial is perverse: architecture relies upon its literalness to achieve credibility. It is entirely understand- able, but still more bewildering, and even more futile, how persistent architects have been and continue to be in their desire to defeat literalness. To embrace literalness may be the most radical and empowering position in architecture. A new literalism in architecture might grow out of a rereading of Michael Fried's wrongheaded thesis in "Art and Objecthood," his 1967 polemic against minimalism, that says art must acknowledge but defeat literalness to achieve and compel conviction. We might make Fried right by saying: first, he was correct to identify literalism (even more than object- hood, presence, latent anthropomorphism, or theatricality) as the salient characteristic of the work he attacks, and sec- ond, the desire to defeat literalness is nothing less than a denial of both possible and necessary relationships between art and architecture.1 Fried's emphasis on the literalist traits of minimalism, as opposed to its minimal means, located a curious site of transaction between art and architecture. His identification of literalism as the enemy of modernist art was in effect a recognition of the latent potential of architec- ture to overwhelm any painting or sculpture. Thus his refusal of literalism is nothing less than a denial of architec- 83</page><page sequence="3">84 Wall, not window: SURFACE</page><page sequence="4">Block, not object: BOX Figure, not form: ROOM 85</page><page sequence="5">ture, and the potential, so clearly grasped by the literalist artists of the 1960s, to exploit both that refusal and that denial. By adapting architectural conventions, concepts, and techniques, the literalists constructed a new identity for the artist that both accepted the modernist emphasis on autono- my and abstraction and engaged the architectural relation- ships that those emphases denied. What I'm suggesting is not that we simply should favor the literal over other terms, or that literalism is not subject to the kinds of critiques and failings that other approaches are. The point is that with the literalism of the 1960s, archi- tecture emerged in a new relationship to the visual and per- forming arts. Literalness, or literalism, was the primary engine driving the disciplinary and discursive realignments of art and architecture in the 1960s. It is even possible to understand the time of minimalism as the moment of an "architectural turn" in the art world, and that that evolution, or alteration, is the major reconfiguration of the arts in the last 50 years. Yet the potential of the literal to open up trans- disciplinary practices remains largely unexploited by archi- tects and consistently repressed by still pervasive fears that enforce stark distinctions between architecture and other arts.
