<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE WALL-PAINTINGS OF INDIA, CENTRAL ASIA, AND CEYLON. A Comparative Study, with an Introductory Essay on the Nature of Buddhist Art by Ananda K. Coomaraswamy. By Benjamin Rowland, 7r. xiv, 94 pp.; 6 pls., 30 pls. in color. Boston, The Merrymount Press, 1938. Almost half the text of this study is occupied by the learned introductory essay on the nature of Buddhist art, wherein Dr. Coomaraswamy seeks to prove the entirely symbolic character of the anthropomorphic representation of Buddha. This author, intimately familiar both with the relevant Indian literature and with the mystic literature of the West from antiquity to the Middle Ages, makes plausi- ble and convincing use of his knowledge. Coomaraswamy is right when asserting (p. 4) that the problems of Buddhist art are "rather those of Indian art in a Buddhist applica- tion, and in the last analysis the problems of art uni- versally." He dwells then on the aniconic character of early Buddhist art, a well-known fact, and proves that the roots of this reach back into Vedic ritual. The restraint upon the presentation of Buddha in human shape would have been clarified had the author pointed out that this attitude was reserved solely for the last existence of the Tathigata; when illustrating the Jdtakas, the stories of Buddha's former lives, the sculptor did not shrink at all from giving him the likeness of man, in case the story de- manded it. It is true that it is a central problem "how it came about that the Buddha has been represented at all in an anthropomorphic form"; but I should rather say that this is not the central problem of Buddhist art, but of Buddhist theology. Coomaraswamy says twice that a need must have been actually felt for a representation in human form, and that this was the case at about the beginning of the Christian era. This phenomenon cannot, I think, be explained only by evidence referring to India. It is certainly not pure accident that it happened just at that Christian epoch, and in a definite area. It seems to me to be inseparably connected with the advent and spread of the Sakas and Kushans in Northwestern and Northern India. I still re- gard as the earliest monument the Bimaran reliquary, despite the efforts made by Rowland in The Art Bulletin, XVIII, 1936, PP. 387 ff., to discount the extraordinarily well established circumstances of its discovery. It is cer- tainly but a slip made in the ardor of argument when Coomaraswamy refers to Buddha images as "invariably represented iconographically as supported by a lotus" (p. 29), for a scholar of his vast knowledge of monuments is, of course, as aware as anybody else that only very few Buddha figures were placed on a lotus socle before the sixth century A.D. But it set me wondering what specific meaning might have been attached to those few representa- tions; very likely Amitabha is pictured. In any event, this essay of Coomaraswamy's belongs among the best ever written about the religious aspect of Buddhist art. The aim of the publication proper is stated in the fore- word by A. Townshend Johnson: "It has been our purpose to take advantage of the utility of having examples of Buddhist painting in one volume to allow by selection and arrangement a study of the interrelation and growth of the various styles ... " The explanatory text to the plates was written by Dr. Benjamin Rowland, Jr.; each group, Miran, Bamiyan, Ajanta, Bagh, Badami, Ceylon, Bezeklik, and China is</page><page sequence="2">NOTES AND REVIEWS 231 headed by a quite extensive introduction on the history of the site and the position of its works within the wider com- plex of Buddhist painting. Each plate is described and the pertinent problems discussed. P1. I shows a worshipper and a garland bearer from Shrine V at Miran, far east on the southern route of Cen- tral Asia leading from Khotin to Tun-huang. Rowland is right in describing these wall paintings as the easternmost examples of late antique art, and in comparing the piece with the Fayyum portraits. These frescoes are the work of a Westerner calling himself Titus whom fate had led far beyond the eastern and southern shores of the Mediter- ranean, the home of this variety of Roman ReichsstiL This means, however, that these pictures are not especially sig- nificant for Central Asia, nor for "Graeco-Buddhist" paint- ing; they only demonstrate the international character of the traders and their company, and are the jetsam brought to Miran by the waves of commerce. Pls. 2-14 are devoted to the paintings in the caves at Bamiyan where the D616gation Archeologique Frangaise en Afghanistan has been working since 1922. The site has been famous throughout Asia during a millenium and a half for the two colossal Buddha statues, 53 m. and 35 m. high, around which the cliff is honeycombed with caves. Rowland, who rightly pays much attention to the question of date, is of the opinion that the time when the two giant figures were hewn out can be deduced on the basis of style, and that this time then serves as a terminus ante quem. I should think, rather, that it provides a terminus post quem, in view of his saying: "It seems likely, furthermore, that the painting would logically have been carried out as soon as the statue was complete" (p. 51). Using ante instead of post is certainly a slip, but a very embarrassing one, the more so, as another one occurs in the same paragraph when the date of the Lucknow Buddha (549-550) is given as 449-450 A. D., thus making the confusion complete. The author thinks that the smaller Buddha is not earlier than 450 A. D. and that the larger one dates from the fifth or sixth century. The paintings of the niche of the 35 m. Buddha and those of groups B, C, and D, situated around this statue, are considered by Rowland as works of one period, dating from the time of a Hephthalite prince, ?ri Vasudeva, who reigned from 595 to 627 A. D. (p. 62). The reasons given for dating these groups at this epoch are, first, that the coins of ?ri Vasudeva display a headdress copying those of Khusrau II (590-628) which, according to the author, appear on the summit of the ogee arches in the dome of the Assembly Hall, Group C (pl. 4), and have as countermark a boar's head; a boar's head is, among other motives, painted on the ceiling of the Vestibule, Group D (pl. 5). Secondly, in discussing a painting from Group B, Rowland says that "the decoration in and around the niches of the two colossi were done at the same period by workers of Iranian and Indian origin" (p. 63). The reasons "that the pictorial ensembles of the two great Buddhas are chronologically and stylistically related [are that] on the back wall of the niche of the 115 foot [135 m.] image are badly damaged fragments of Buddhas under Bodhi trees that are in exactly the same style as the well- known examples of this type in the niche of the large colossus" (pp. 69 f.). I do not think it advisable to draw too heavily on the argument involving the boar's head, which is too weak a basis for a chronological structure. On the other hand the discovery of the winged and ribboned crescent upholding a tiny globe, in the dicor of the Assembly Hall, Group C, is much to the credit of Rowland, though in pl. 4 of his book it is not possible to make the motive out beyond doubt, nor in the corresponding plates 7-9 in J. Hackin and J. Carl, Nouvelles recherches archiologiques d BmiyJan, Paris, 1933; it is a pity that no drawing of this important ornament has been included. But the reference to the coin of Khusrau II in F. Sarre, Kunst des alten Persien, Berlin, 1922, pi. 143, fig. 13, is not to the point, as the emblem of this king consists of a crescent surmounted by a star; and the famous silver salver in the Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris, which is also cited (ib., pl. 107), does not represent Khusrau II, but Firuz (457-484 A. D.). Further material bearing on this subject will be found in the paper by Kurt Erdmann: Das Datum des Tdk-i-Bustan, in Ars Islamica, 1937, PP. 79 ff. That the paintings of Bamiyan are related to those of Kuchi, especially to the wall paintings in the Ming-Oi of Kyzil, was recognized from the beginning. But it is Row- land's merit to have studied them closely and circumspectly thus enabling him to tell which paintings are related to Kucha, and in what respects. I think he is right in saying: "Together with the decorations of Cave I the frescoes in the niche of the Great Buddha are actually the closest in point of style to the cycle at Kyzil. Such paintings as the 'Queen's dance' from the Rudray~na story in the 'Treasure Cave' and the 'Maya Cave' have the same combination of Indian and Sasanian forms, the same symbolic-plastic use of light and shade as these late works at Bmrniyan." Speaking of the Bodhisattva on the soffit of the niche of the 53 m. Buddha at Bimiydn, the author even finds that "the figure of the Bodhisattva, too, in physical type and, again, notably in the orange shading of the torso, seems a work of the same school as the Buddhas in the 'Peacock Cave' at Kyzil" (p. 68). Who gave and who received is correctly stated: "It is evident, at all events, that, although probably not separated by any great space of time, it was the cycle of painting at Bamiya-n that influenced these works at Kyzil and even further east along the avenue of caravan and pilgrim" (p. 48). This road led to Tun-huang, "the Westernmost, and hence the first Chinese site to re- ceive the onrushing flood of Indian culture, [where] the paintings of the Six Dynasties period in Caves I I I and 135 have the same Indian forms with heavily shaded outlines that we have studied in the niche of the Great Buddha at B~miy~n" (p. 91). When, in 1931, I gave a tentative chronology of the caves of Tun-huang in a paper of wider range (Die Raumdarstellung in der chinesischen Malerei des ersten 7ahrtausends, in Miinchner 7ahrbuch der bildenden Kunst, N. F. VIII) I pointed out that the caves decorated between c. 450 and 550 A. D. are, in their paintings, wholly dependent on the so-called Thokharian style of Kuchd. Cave 135 may be safely ascribed to the period 520-540 A.D. Cave I I belongs definitely to the second half of the fifth century. Sculpture and painting of this cave use the language of form spoken at Kuchd. Moreover, the wall paintings are done in what may be described as a direct derivation of the "second style" of Kuchd, and of its very latest phase at that. The change from the first to the second style around Kuchi was long ago admirably de- scribed by Alfred Griinwedel; that it required time is ob- vious. At any rate, the second half of the fifth century is the terminus ante quem of this evolution. Now the "Pfauensh6hle" (Peacock Cave) and the "Schatzh6hle" (Treasure Cave), named by Rowland as closest in style to Bamiyan were decorated in the first style. These caves are not, I believe, "generally dated about 650 A. D.," as the author boldly states. Wald- schmidt ranges them, in his Tabellarische Ubersicht, in Bud- dhistische Spatantike, VII, Berlin, I932, P. 29, correctly under Style I, and assigns them to "c. 500 A. D." Even this is too late, for the reasons indicated above. I need not explain what this means to Rowland's conclusions. It is very unfortunate that the date of the visit paid by the Korean priest Hui-ch'ao to Bimiyan is given on p. 49 as "a century after Hsiian-tsang" (who was there in 629 A. D.), on p. 50 as "827 A. D.," on p. 55 as "eighth cen- tury," and on p. 90 as "early ninth century." Hui--ch'ao visited Bimiyan in 727 A. D. P1. 29 shows a well-known group of monks the pro- venience of which is given in the heading on p. 88 as "from</page><page sequence="3">232 THE ART BULLETIN the Ming-ii Site, Kharashar, Western Turkestan," whereas in the text (p. 93) it is referred to as "from Ming- Oi from the Khotan region." That this is not a mere slip becomes clear when the author goes on to say that it "cor- responds remarkably well to the description of the style of the Khotanese Wei-chih I-seng," a painter working in China in the second quarter of the seventh century. This is too much, since the fragment actually comes from Sharchuk near Kharashar, which is situated in the north- western corner of Eastern Turkestan, Western Turkestan lying to the west of the Pamirs; it has, therefore, nothing to do with Khotin, nor with the Khotanese painter, its style indicating that it is a typical work of UIgur painting, dating from the tenth century. A glance at pl. 30 suffices to convince one. Rowland is whipping a dead horse when discussing at length the various theories about the probable nationality of the artist who painted the famous frescoes in the Kond6 of the Harytji. Most of the scholars in the field agree that they are the work of a Chinese, and that they have their exact counterparts in the wonderful Paradises of Cave 146 in Tun-huang, as, indeed, I have previously pointed out (op. cit., pl. I I, p. 218). What Rowland writes about painting in India and Ceylon is more convincing. He is familiar with the litera- ture on the subject and finds remarkably fine words when describing the charm and beauty of these works. With very little left of ancient Indian painting the problems for the art historian are almost simple compared with the extra- ordinarily complex problems in Central Asia. The author was evidently hurried when writing his text. Had he been permitted, by himself or others, to ponder over his material a couple of years and to examine the literature dealing with its manifold aspects, the result would have been much more satisfactory. But, according to the foreword, the idea of publishing this book was con- ceived in the spring of 1936; then the authors traveled to Bgmiyan and through India, and, in the first days of February, 1938, the volume was out. This is quick work, as is revealed to the book's disadvantage. In conclusion, it remains to say that the book is very well printed and the plates excellent. LUDWIG BACHHOFER</page></plain_text>
