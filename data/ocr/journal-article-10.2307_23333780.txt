<plain_text><page sequence="1">WHAT SRI AUROBINDO MEANS TO ME 5 MAYADHAR MANSINHA As An Indian and a Hindu, I feel no shame in admitting before all and sundry that there definitely is an element of infatuation in me for the occult and the mystic. If long years ago it was vague and amorphous, now it is certain and stabilised, imparting liberation and expansion to a consciousness that was contemptible and pitiable before, for its very limited and stunted dimensions. And it has been this writer's faith of late that interest in the mystic and the occult is not only very much needed for a gracious and harmonious flowering of the human personality, but inescapably necessary also for a clean and rational way of living in our dusty day-to-day world. And that a man with an inalienable fascination for and deep interest in the mystic shall meet Sri Aurobindo for a fuller or farther understanding of this most elusive of human searches, may be taken for granted. For, Sri Aurobindo has most ad mirably readjusted Yoga, Inda's unique science of mysticism, to these modern rational times of ours, placing his thesis on revolutionary scientific discoveries of the twentieth century, even while linking the whole process to the truths contained in our most ancient scriptures. The Indian Yoga has never claimed to be a revelation. Like any other great or small discovery of science, such as, the Law of Gravitation by Newton or that of Relativity by Einstein, Yoga too may be taken to be the sudden inexplicable brain-wave of an unknown Indian genius of pre historic times. For, the Yogi is found sitting in deep meditation among the archaeological finds of Mohenjo-daro which civilisa tion is taken by world-historians to be no younger than at least seven thousand years. And all through these seventy centuries or more, India, of all countries of the world, has been assiduously 95</page><page sequence="2">INDIAN LITERATURE experimenting on perfecting the human personality, making and keeping it pleasurable as well as rational and worthwhile in and through its ephemerality. India's indigenous system of physical exercise, her own system of medicine, her religjous rituals and her literature as a whole—all tend towards an ideal of living for the Homo Sapiens, of which harmony and symmetry may be taken to be the main golden ingredient as well as the total objective. Few realise the astounding breadth of cons ciousness and deep sense of unity with the cosmos which are so beautifully expressed when a Hindu, while offering libational waters to his own ancestors, liberally offers the same also to not only all other souls still suffering beyond the living, irrespective of caste and creed, but even also to creatures that crawl, swim or live invisible, as a unique symbol of concern for the pacifica tion of all their souls. But even this sublimest of all requiems observed in any world religion or society, is never claimed also to be a revelation by any Hindu. This is part of Smriti, the Hindu's social guidance promulgated by various saintly law-givers in different periods of history, changed and amended for adjustments to contemporary conditions. Starting with prehistoric Manu, the string of the great Hindu Smriti-makcTS is quite long, extending right up to the twentieth century whose unimaginably confused social conditions brought about by the impact of Western civilisation on the Indian, psychically deeper and physically more sweeping by far than what had happened on contacts with Islam, brought out also a fresh Smriti intriguingly entitled as Kalyapaddharma sarvaswam ('The treasures of religious behaviours of men in this critical time of Kali Yuga') by the late Mahamahopadhyaya Pandit Sadasiva Kavyakantha of Puri. Like the Smiritis, the Indian Yoga system also may be taken as an evolved discipline. Patanjali the great is perhaps no more than a brilliant arranger of ideas and practices that were long prevalent in India in an unsystematic, nebulous fashion, varying from Guru to Guru. The Buddha, soon after he left home in search of Light, is known to have practised some sort öf Yoga to start with, and if he failed to get any spiritual asnwers 96</page><page sequence="3">WHAT SRI AUROBTNDO MEANS TO ME to his cosmic queries out of these austerities and physical con tortions, most probably "Yoga was not yet so systematically and gradedly written down as was done perhaps later by Patan jali, based on his personal experiments as well as verified experie nces of others in the field. But what has attracted most people towards Yoga in India and elsewhere is not so much the spiritual transformation that is said to descend on the practitioner after a spell of tiringly prolonged struggle, but it is mostly occult powers acquired from Hatha Yoga which became an excellent handmaiden to abomi nable Tan trie sexual perversities in medieval times. Great Ramakrishna had gone through only the Divya or the transcen dental branch of it, but realising its utter inadequacy for gai ning spiritual heights, gave stern warnings to all his disciples not to dabble in such provocative but spiritually-damaging practices. And so also did great Buddha twenty-five centuries back. For, Yoga is not, in its essence and its total objective, the capacity to stand on one's head or swallowing nitric acid with impunity or walking on water. Yoga is essentially a spiritual course, meant to put an end to man's sufferings by disabusing his mind of the illusory and inhibiting concepts of time and space and liberating his limited consciousness inalienably bound to sense-objects of a delusive phenomenal world, to facilitate its unity with the universal consciousness. That is true Yoga, which etymologically means 'union',—union of the Small with the Great, of the Part with the Whole, of the little Drop with the vast Ocean, and of the alone with the Alone, the Absolute. As the final flowering of the Vedas in which the early Aryan man is seen in the midst of his gropings for truths about life and the universe, to crave mostly for the evanescent pleasures of the earthly existence and beyond, the Upanishads proclaimed: naipe sukhamasti ('there cannot be real happiness within small limitations'); and bhumaiva sukham ('real happiness can be attained only in the Absolute, the Vast'). Maybe, Patanjali lived in the post-Buddhistic rational period of Indian thinking. There are but one or two obligingly 97</page><page sequence="4">INDIAN LITERATURE permissive mentions of a personal God in his whole treatise. The plain aim of his so-called philosophy is just to teach the psycho-physical means by which the human soul may be fully united with the Supreme Soul, thus getting liberated and free as the natural consequence of that freedom, of all earthly miseries. His whole treatise contains only elabórate rules for such physical and mental exercises, as will lead finally to samadhi or deep meditation in which such liberation and union are supposed to take place. This is a state in which a live man appears to be dead to the phenomenal world for all practical purposes, though psychically alive in the fullest sense, enjoying the supreme beatific experience of union with the Divine. But few Indians ever realise that many well-known non-Indian historical personalities used to have such trance-states without knowing a word of Yoga. If Chaitanya and Ramakrishna had it off and on, so did Mohammed. And both Chaitanya and Mohammed are known to have been epileptic cases. They say, most of the Qoran in unsurapassingly beautiful Arabic is nothing but illiterate Mohammed's oracular trance utterances. Poet Shelley too had occasional samadhi or trance as well as Blake and Wordsworth. And experiences during samadhi of the Indian yogis still remain vague. It was the questioning French genius of Romain Rolland that first raised this most vital issue in his excellent biography of Ramakrishna. The saint at Dakshineswar had for years been soulfully yearning to 'see' his Mother. At last, while going to commit suicide out of sheer frustration, he dropped into a prolonged trance. Rollland has most pertinently asked at this point, what actually did the great Paramahansa 'see'? Did he really see an anthro pomorphic Mother? Transparently honest and truthful, Ramakrishna later reported again and again that he saw no Mother at all but only felt that he was floating most joyously on the waves, of an ocean of Light. But experiences of other Yogis in samadhi are not exactly like Ramakrishna's, nor so definite either. And it is well-known now that samádhi like psychic experiences are easily induced through drugs like mes caline with which the late Aldous Huxley, a great admirer of 98</page><page sequence="5">WHAT SRI AUROBINDO MEANS TO ME Indian Yoga and philosophy, is said to have been frequently experimenting during the last part of his life. And it is perhaps not very widely known either how many aspirants have had their health shattered because of pranayam or breath-controlling practices as elaborated in books by Patan jali and others. Sri Aurobindo has rescued Yoga from all such chaotic ^id scaring conditions and put it on a plainly psycho-scientific level. It was a great and good event for all concerned that a supremely brilliant savant like him, deeply acquainted with the best of Eastern and Western cultures, decided all on a sudden, in res ponse to an inner call, to abandon all the provocative gains and glamours of Indian politics in which he was already shining like the rising sun, propounding the most original and practical ideas for breaking the most powerful colonial empire in history, to go in for the lonely, austere and cloistered life of a Yogi. He too, like the Buddha, had to resort to nostril-pressures, to start with, as quick means to attain his spiritual end. And he is said to have obtained also some unusual occult powers out of some Yogic practices. But to a superbly brilliant and cul tured mind like Sri Aurobindo's, religion or spiritual living must be in conformity with the latest scientific discovries to stand in respect and dignity as a modern way of life. It must carry its raison d'etre with it, and not merely harp on faith or ancientness. The concept of evolution is perhaps the greatest of the theo retical scientific discovries of the twentieth century. Disproving the puerile concepts of this world coming out of nothing, all on a sudden, on the mandate of an anthropomorphic god, as given in the Bible, Darwin proved to the hilt that this Creation is the result of slow transformation extending over millions of years. And stunningly enough this 20th-century discovery of Europe superbly conformed to the age-old concepts of tile Hindus regarding the genesis and dissolution of the phenomenal world as well as of the human life. The Hindu has never con ceived of his earthly existence as independent in itself, unrelated 99</page><page sequence="6">INDIAN LITERATURE to anything before or after, but takes it as the natural evolved culmination of a long series of existence as trees, plants and animals as well as human beings. The whole Hindu theory of Karma is nothing but an acceptance of the concept of evolution as the basic infra-structural principle in the entire Creation. Sri Aurobindo was not also a mere politician or Yogi of the commonplace genre. He was, besides being a great Yogi and statesman of the supreme order, a seer, a visionary, a prophet of the future of the world and mankind. He has visualised and emphatically promised a better world for us all. If Yoga has all along been individualistic so far, it was Sri Aurobindo who for the first time proclaimed that it could be collective also for the desirable metamorphosis of this planet. In other words, if individualistic Yoga helped evolve a man into perfection, the collective Yoga can evolve this misery-ridden planet of our» into a real paradise. And he argues scientifically. Man has slowly evolved out of minerals, plants and animals. In other words, what was mere life in the lower stages, in man it has evolved a Mind. And there is no gainsaying the fact that the human Mind has been able to create super-marvels in arts and sciences and technology. But for lack of some balancing factor, the Homo Sapiens has been terrifically blundering also, practically destroy ing what he creates, making life on earth more and more intolerable in his attempts to make it more and more beautiful and comfortable. Sri Aurobindo has declared that just as man has slowly evolved out of plants and animals, he has still to climb another rung in the ladder of evolution. Out of the brilliant but blun dering Mind, he has to grow into the Supermind. And unlike in the case of plants and aimals, Man's evolution, both indivi dual and collective, is entirely his responsibility. Plants and animals only react to environmental conditions whereas Man endowed with a Mind is able to act independently and change his conditions and environments. Hence, whether Man goes up the ladder of evolution or goes down, is entirely his respon sibility. And it is within man's capacity to accelerate this 100</page><page sequence="7">WHAT SRI AUROBINDO MEANS TO ME upward process of evolution, to rise from a blundering mind to a Supermind that shall see Truth of things and events in their entirety. And only thus shall be established the kingdom of Heaven on earth. And as the surest and the quickest means of achieving this glorious end, this total transformation of Man and his world as well, Sri Aurobindo has boldly propounded his Purnanga Toga or Integral Yoga, as this process is expected to bring about a complete transformation of Man including even his physical body that shall one day defy old age and death. It is really a most vital matter that Sri Aurobindo has rid the Indian Yogic system of many of the unquestioned accretions of ages, such as, the rituals of initiation, change of costumes, and leaving the work-a-day world of man for the sake of reli gion and also of the hazardous breath-controls. Alone in Sri Aurobindo's Yogic process are there no initiation rituals. Anybody of any religion anywhere on the earth can proceed on Sri Aurobindo's simple scientific process of Yoga from excatly . the point where he stands at present. But though it sounds simple, it is the most difficult of all the Yogic processes. A complete surrender of the human ego at the feet of the Divine with the sincere and spontaneous urge for the upward evolution or full ungrudging acceptance of what the Divine desires the sadhaka to be, is certainly not easy doing. Genuine egolessness alone is genuie saintliness. India's great modern Mahatma had it and, maybe, the millions bowed at his feet just because of this real divine quality in his personality,—a quality most rare to come across not only in the average man or woman, but even in most of those who are glibly described as Great. Like individual transformation, man should try also for the total transformation of the existence on this planet. Mankind may keep its million hearts open to receive the descending Supramental which alone can change the blundering and suffe ring humans into divines. Tatah abhyudaya-nihsreyasah-siddhih, sa dharmah. 'That alone should be called Religion which endows on the aspirant Release in and through earthly Prosperity.' So had declared India's 101</page><page sequence="8">INDIAN LITERATURE Vaishesika philosophy many centuries ago. But perhaps through mainly the implied impact and practices of the last two of the four prescribed stages of the Vedic Aryan's life— sannyasa (renunciation of the world) and yatibrata (life of a wandering mendicant) as well as that of the Buddhist Sangha— religion or Yoga has meant in India all these centuries an indi fference to social life, by and large. But in keeping with its total objective, it is. Sri Aurobindo's Yoga for the first time in India's age-old, Yogic tradition that has taken as much note of improvements of the material as of the spiritual side of man. The Ashram at Pondicherry is a superb sample of what is being looked forward to on the material side, through path-breaking experiments in education, agri culture, animal husbandry, various crafts and, most of all, in the most orderly and peaceful and contented community-living to be seen anywhere in India. The concept of Auroville as a universal village combining all modern amenities with rural peace in which the international inhabitants shall carry on their aesthetic and benevolent pursuits, is really a bold projec tion into the 21st century and after, far ahead of the nuclear power-mad nations of today. Though in no way directly connected with the Pondicherry Ashram and not an avowed follower of Sri Aurobindo or- a disciple of the Mother but only an objective-minded searcher of spiritual light in the encompassing dense darkness of un understanding that is this, our worldly life, Sri Aurobindo's writings have meant a lot to this humble writer, for the fact that he has not only simplified Yoga but has put the emphasis on only its fine quintessence in keeping with the contemporary hectic conditions of man, for the fact that he has squarly based his new Yoga on an impeccable scientific basis, for the fact that he, by breaking down the unquestioned Yogic traditions in India accepted for centuries, has rid Yoga of the initiation rituals, insisting on Yoga to be not a series of physico-psychic exercises only resulting in occult powers, but primarily an ardent inner urge and aspiration in the individual for spiritual uplift and creativeness, and, lastly, for the fact that it is Sri Auro 102</page><page sequence="9">WHAT SRI AUROBINDO MEANS TO ME bindo, of all the long line of Yogic masters of India, who has taken the material and environments also to be as serious a part of his Purnanga Toga as the individual and collective psychic transformation of Man.</page></plain_text>
