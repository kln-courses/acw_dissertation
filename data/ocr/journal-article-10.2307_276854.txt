<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CHALCHIHUITES CULTURE OF NORTHWESTERN MEXICO ROBERT H. LISTER AND AGNES M. HOWARD * FOR MANY YEARS a Chalchihuites type of culture has been designated for a number of archaeological sites in the western parts of the states of Durango and Zacatecas, Mexico (Hrdlicka 1903; Gamio 1910; Noguera 1930; Mason 1937; Brand 1939). The culture takes its name from the early-studied and partially- tested site of the same name located in north- western Zacatecas. Chalchihuites culture has been noted by Mason to extend as far south as the great site of La Quemada, or Chicomostoc as it is also called, some 35 miles southwest of Zacatecas, Zacatecas (Mason 1937). It is prevalent in southern Durango in the vicinity of the city of Durango, and Mason and Brand believe that at Zape, Durango, 150 miles to the north, it had reached its northern limit. At Zape it had become peripheral and attenuated, having lost much of its fine quality. As more information is obtained, it is possible that the culture may be extended to a group of sites in northern Jalisco. There are indications that certain elements typical of the culture are found in that locality. Thus, it appears that a Chalchihuites culture province was widespread over a fairly large area east of the Sierra Madre Occidental on the northwestern Mexican plateau. This brief paper will not redescribe the archi- tectural remains or material culture of La Quemada or Chalchihuites or the sites reported upon by Mason. It will comment upon certain elements that are quite common to the Chal- chihuites culture in the vicinity of Durango, and which appear to be typical of the culture generally. Some of these elements were con- sidered by Mason and earlier writers, but war- rant mentioning again. A few apparent simi- larities between Chalchihuites and other cul- tures will be pointed out. Our information is based almost entirely upon surface archaeology or collections ob- tained from the surfaces of several large sites in the immediate vicinity of Durango. There- fore, we possibly group together cultural re- mains which may prove to have been non- * Mrs. Howard collaborated in the study of the arti- facts and R. H. Lister is responsible for the discussion and comparisons. contemporaneous when controlled excavations are undertaken. However, all of the items to be mentioned would appear to have been characteristic of Chalchihuites culture at one time or another, and all are found together on the surfaces of the sites near Durango. Analysis of the collection of Mrs. Agnes M. Howard and an examination of the collection of Frederico Schroeder, both of Durango, fur- nished most of the information presented here. Most Chalchihuites sites near Durango are located on the slopes and tops of good-sized hills, over and surrounding which cultural re- mains are found scattered for several acres indi- cating former large settlements. Hillside ter- racing, rectangular house outlines of stones, and a rich assortment of potsherds, stone chips, and artifacts and ornaments of stone, bone, and shell mark the sites. Urn burials of noncre- mated remains occur. POTTERY Potsherds are found in large numbers. Simply classi- fied, they may be divided into 6 types. Heavy Brown Ware. Sherds of this heavy plain pot- tery are recovered in such quantity that it is probable that it was the common utility ware. The paste is coarse, with abundant sand temper which ranges in size up to small pebbles. The ware has thick walls which are fairly soft and crumbly. It frequently exhibits a black core. There is a large variation in surface color, ranging from light tan to dark gray. A few sherds of what ap- pears to be the same ware have a dull red slip. Surfaces are uneven and commonly show smoothing marks. A few fragments have a profusion of shallow curved inden- tations resembling fingernail impressions. Sherds indi- cate that bowls and large ollas were made. The bottoms of some bowls are incised in a manner suggesting their use as chili grinders or molcajetes. Some vessels have large tripod supports and handles or lugs shaped like human heads are attached to the rim of one bowl. Red on Brown Ware. This is the most frequent type of decorated ware found. There is quite a variation in both surface and design colors. The slip color ranges from tan to brown to almost orange; designs from red to brown. The tan paste is fine and hard, and it shows a black core in many instances. Surfaces are well smoothed and polished over the designs. Polishing over the deco- ration sometimes causes the design to be blurred. Vessel shapes, determined from an examination of several complete vessels as well as a great many sherds, include jars or small ollas, shallow bowls, bowls with 122</page><page sequence="2">LISTER AND HOWARD ] CHALCHIHUITES CULTURE OF NORTHWESTERN MEXICO SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF CHALCHIHUITES CULTURE DURANGO, MEXICO RED ON BROWN POTTERY Shapes.

A typical example of the latter form consists of a shallow bowl, approximately 8 inches in diameter. It has a sharp angular shoulder and is supported by tripod legs. These legs, in profile, are wide at the top because of the presence of a distinc- tive knob, and taper to a narrow bottom upon which they rest. They are about 2 inches high. Arching above the vessel to a height of 5 inches is a heavy, solid basket handle. It is oval in cross section and about 3/4 inch in width. The handle flattens markedly at either side where it attaches to the rim of the bowl. On the ex- terior surface of the handle, about an inch above the bowl rim on either side, there are small protruding knobs. Naturally there is some variation, especially in size, from the typical vessel described above. Fragments of handles show an assortment of sizes extending from 5/8 to 11/4 inches in cross section. Knobs on the sides of the handles may be modified to form small animal effigy heads. It appears that tripod bowls with basket handles were decorated only in bands around the exterior sides of bowls and on the exterior surfaces of the handles. Usu- ally rims are red. Below the rim the decorative band, characteristically outlined by 1 or 2 horizontal lines, extends down to the sharp shoulder of the bowl. Within this encircling band are various designs, made up pri- marily of geometric elements and naturalistic animal figures. Parallel lines, lines edged with ticking, stepped lines, solid triangles or stepped triangles, frets, S-shaped elements, circles, pattee crosses, and dots are placed in various combinations. Naturalistic figures are frequently combined with the geometric motives. The outer sur- faces of the basket handles are decorated with designs similar to those placed on the sides of the bowls. The designs extend in a band completely across the handle from one side of the vessel to the other. The knobs protruding from either side of the handles are sometimes incorporated into the depiction of a human face. The knob serves as a nose and the other facial features are painted about it. Shallow bowls, bowls with annular bases, and jars appear to have been decorated only with geometric elements, principally parallel lines. Bowls show both interior and exterior decoration. Brush work is not very neat, and lines vary from fine to fairly broad. However, the over-all appearance of the designs is quite pleasing, and they probably contained considerable sym- bolism. Some sherds of red on brown are thicker walled and have broader design lines than have been described above. These sherds apparently constitute a coarse vari- ant of red on brown ware, possibly representing a separate type. However, in this general discussion such a distinction will not be made. Grooved Red Ware. Sherds of this type are numerous enough in collections to set them apart as a ware. In paste they resemble red on brown. The surface usually has a dull red slip, occasionally showing some polishing. Sherds are from shallow bowls and small jars with an angular shoulder. Tripod legs are employed on at least some bowls. Decoration consists of an encircling band of vertical grooves about the sides of bowls and on the bodies of jars above the shoulders. The grooves are about 1/4 inch in width and 1/16 inch deep, and they appear to have been made with a round-ended imple- ment. On jars the grooved band is unslipped, so it stands out in color as well as in texture. White on Red Ware. Sherds of this ware are not found as frequently as are red on brown sherds. This type has a hard, tan paste, sometimes showing a black core. A fairly well polished red slip covers the smooth surfaces. The white designs are drawn over the polish in a matte paint thick enough to be felt with the finger. Bowls, jars, and rarely tripod bowls with basket handles occur. Some jars have small conical tripod supports. Brush work is fairly neat; lines are usually fine. Decora- tion seems to be limited to vessel exteriors. Many of the geometric elements used on red on brown ware are also employed on this pottery. Bowls sometimes have a decorated band around the sides just below the rims. Motifs include stepped or zigzag lines, parallel lines fre- quently arranged in triangles, lines with ticking, circles, and checkerboard. A few small designs may be con- ventionalized animals or insects. Incised Ware. This characteristic ware does not occur in great quantity. Its tan paste is the hardest and finest of the wares examined. Walls of vessels are thin and the surfaces are extremely well smoothed and highly polished. Slip color ranges from tan to dark gray, with the latter color predominating. The only shape noted is a small shallow bowl, approximately 5 inches in diameter, with tripod supports. Rims of bowls are often raised and perforated at 2 opposite points, apparently for suspension. The tripod legs are small, 11/2 inches in height, and resemble the wide-top style described for red on brown tripod vessels, although the knobs on the upper exterior surfaces are not as pronounced. Decoration is in a band on the exteriors of bowls, just below the rim. The designs are made by fine in- cisions, or carvings, most of which appear to have been polished. Red or white pigments fill the incisions, evi- dently placed after the vessel had been fired since they are fugitive in nature. This practice causes the design or decorated area to stand out distinctly. In some instances the incised lines form the designs, but more often, the incised area serves as the background for a design con- sisting of unremoved parts of the slip. Thus the incisions comprise a sort of negative element in the design. Motifs such as stepped lines, frets, S-shaped elements, triangles, dots, and some conventionalized animal figures are depicted. Cloisonne Ware. Perhaps the outstanding element heretofore associated with Chalchihuites culture is cloi- sonne pottery. Vessels of this very distinctive ware have been recovered at the site of Chalchihuites and at sev- eral sites in northern Jalisco. Sherds of this type occur at La Quemada (Ekholm 1942: 94). The ware exhibits a unique technic of decoration whereby designs are [ XXI, 2, 1955 124</page><page sequence="4">LISTER AND HOWARD ] CHALCHIHUITES CULTURE OF NORTHWESTERN MEXICO formed by placing a layer of paint on the vessel, cutting out the design, and refilling it with another color. The process is repeated for each color added to the design. As many as 6 colors are utilized in the preparation of intricate designs which included complex symbolic fig- ures. No examples of this ware were observed in collections at Durango, but reliable informants report its occurrence there. It is rarely recognized on the surface of sites, probably due to the fact that the paint weathers rapidly from sherds once they are exposed to the elements. Trade Wares. A very few sherds are recovered from sites in the vicinity of Durango which probably represent trade wares. Since the sherds are not numerous, and most of them are quite small, description is difficult. A polychrome type is present. It resembles red on brown ware, but in addition, has white lines incorporated in the designs. There is also an incised red and white on brown polychrome type on which a very fine-lined design has been cut into a band of red paint encircling the exteriors of bowls. A single brown sherd has an incised design apparently depicting the head of a feathered serpent. The figure is conventionalized, but it shows a serpent head with open mouth, the eye, and a crest of feathers above the eye. These trade wares, as well as those which comprise the pottery complex of Chalchihuites culture, suggest strong central Mexican affiliations. Whether such a con- nection was directly with the central area of Mexico, or with the west coast of Mexico where influence from central Mexico was felt, cannot definitely be stated. This problem will be considered in the final section of this paper. Spindle Whorls. Several types occur rather commonly. One group is made of fine grained clay. The surfaces are usually well smoothed and polished and vary in color from brown to almost black. They average about 1 /2V inches in diameter and are decorated with finely incised lines and dots. Incisions possibly had been filled with a pigment of a fugitive nature. Shapes include biconical, conical, and a variation of the conical type which possesses a circular base. The second group of spindle whorls is not nearly as well made as the first. They are fashioned from a coarse, heavily tempered clay. The surfaces are uneven and poorly polished, usually tan or brown in color. Like the first group, they also average about 112 inches in di- ameter. The only decoration is a series of notches around the edges. They are shaped like thick discs with the addition of low conical protuberances on one or both surfaces, making them appear either conical or biconical. Smoking Pipes. Fragments indicate that an elbow variety was typical. The bowl extends upward, almost at a right angle to the stem. They are made of fine clay, having tan to brown polished surfaces. The stems are short and, in some cases, have a thick oval cross section, flattened on the bottom. In other examples the stem is circular in cross section. Both types of stems taper to a blunt point at the mouthpiece. The front end of the stem is flattened horizontally forming a sort of plat- form upon which the bowl rests. The platform usually is wider than the base of the bowl. It may simply be rounded in front, or it can have notches which cause the front of the platform to be lobed. Some pipe bowls taper from the opening at the rim to a smaller base, but others appear to have been more globular with an angu- lar shoulder. Most examples have no decoration, but one cylindrical stem has a neatly incised design. A typi- cal pipe measures 31/2 inches in length with a bowl 11/4 inches high. Beads. Tubular clay beads are found in numbers. They vary somewhat in size but all are fashioned in the same manner. It is likely that they were made by rolling flattened pieces of fine clay about hollow grass stems of small diameter. The clay was shaped so that the tube had a larger diameter in the center and tapered to either end. Usually they were polished. The firing process burned out the grass stems, leaving a small perforation extending through the beads. They normally are tan in surface color. These beads average 11/4 inches in length and V4 inch in greatest diameter. The hole for stringing is 1/16 inch or smaller in diameter. Effigy. One hollow effigy figure has been collected. It is a seated figure, with legs drawn up in front of the body and knees sharply bent. Arms are folded across the chest, resting on the bent knees. The head and facial features are well modeled and are quite large in propor- tion to the rest of the figure. Its left cheek has a de- cided bulge as though something was held in the mouth. The remainder of the bodily features are shown in rudi- mentary fashion. Sex is doubtful, although possibly it is intended to represent a male. It may have been employed as a container since the top of the head has a large opening. Unfortunately the upper arms and lower legs are missing. It is apparent that the legs were broken while the effigy was being used since the broken surfaces had been ground very smooth. It is brown in color and is moderately well polished. No painted decoration appears, except on the face which had been colored red. Perforations in the ears and nose suggest that ornaments might have been attached to those fea- tures. It is 9 inches high. Figurines. A few fragments of hand-modeled, solid clay figurines have been found. These specimens do not show resemblances to any described types. The heads of some are flat slabs with raised noses and eyebrows and incised eyes and mouths. A red-line decoration is painted on the face. Another variety has coffee-bean type eyes, a raised nose, and protruding lips. An assort- ment of torsos and legs is in the collections. Most figurines are of brown clay, polished or unpolished. Some carry a red painted decoration. 125</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY STONE An assortment of stone artifacts occur in sufficient frequency to be considered typical of Chalchihuites culture. Axes. Ground stone axes are very prevalent at sites in southern Durango, seemingly indicating a great em- phasis upon wood working. A variety of axes was made; full-grooved and three-quarter grooved types predomi- nate and are found about in equal numbers. Several double-grooved axes have been observed. Most axes have a rounded butt, a slightly convex cutting edge, and are oval in cross section. In size they exhibit a wide range. Mauls. Round-bitted stone implements, most likely employed as mauls, occasionally are found. Normally they have full encircling grooves for hafting purposes. Metates and Manos. Grinding tools, undoubtedly as- sociated with maize agriculture, also are common. The metates are troughed, closed at one end as a rule, and legless. Manos are generally rectangular with rounded corners. Both grinding surfaces may be flat and parallel; or one surface may be flat and the other curved. Both metates and manos are of vesicular basalt. Mortars and Pestles. This style of grinding or crushing device was not nearly as commonly used as the metate and mano. Some mortars are almost cylindrical in out- line and well made. Others are much simpler, having been prepared by making a depression in a small rock. A few effigy mortars are known. They sometimes have a human face depicted on the outside of the vessel. Pestles are cylindrical shaped. Basalt was used for both mortars and pestles. Carved Figures. Another cultural element which ap- pears to be characteristic of Chalchihuites culture was the carving of stone effigy figures. As a rule they are anthropomorphic and not well executed. Most of them were made of basalt or tuff, materials that do not lend themselves to fine detailed work. Frequently only the head and facial features are shown with any degree of reality; other parts of the body are highly conventional- ized or not indicated. The objects are usually cylindrical in over-all outline with the upper portion, or head, being rounded. They are fairly small, having a spread in height from 3 to 7 inches. Projectile Points. Projectile points are numerous. Sev- eral types are recognized, but most of the specimens can be placed in one or the other of 2 groups: side notched or side and basal notched. The blades of a number are serrated. Many very small points, averaging about 1/2 inch in length, are collected. They are so small that their employment as arrowpoints is ques- tioned. Perhaps some may have been used ornamentally. Other examples are as much as 11/2 inches in length. A large number of points fall in between the 2 extremes. Various materials such as flint, chert, chalcedony, and obsidian were used. Obsidian Flake Blades. Single flake obsidian blades, highly characteristic of the central Mexican cultures, are present at Chalchihuites culture sites. From surface indications, they possibly are not as numerous as in areas farther to the south. Scrapers. A distinctive type of scraper is assignable to the culture. It is shaped like an end scraper, or snub- nosed variety, but has a narrow extension projecting away from the circular working area. It therefore re- sembles a banjo in shape, being circular with a narrow parallel-sided extension which probably served as a handle. The majority of the specimens are small, about 11/2 inches in length. They have flat undersurfaces and are retouched around the edges of the circular portion. Cruciform-shaped Stones. Small, flat stone objects with 4 projections placed at right angles to one another occasionally are collected. Surfaces usually are well smoothed by grinding and polishing, but a few are shaped by chipping. They measure about an inch across. Use is unknown. Ornaments. Stone beads and pendants were employed as ornaments. Small disc-shaped beads frequently are found. Less numerous are small, neatly-carved flat beads in animal and human effigy shapes. Miscellaneous. Polishing stones of several varieties, stone balls, shaft polishers, drills, cylinder stamps, and a number of items of indeterminate shape are found in the collections from sites in this area. Pieces of pol- ished iron pyrites may have been employed in mosaics. SHELL Ornaments. Shell appears to have been a favorite material from which ornaments were carved. Bracelets were made by cutting the centers from Glycymeris shells. Sometimes the umbo was carved to represent a face. An assortment of beads and pendants has been found. Outstanding are flat effigy beads representing human and animal forms. Some such specimens are extremely well executed. A number of ornaments were made from nacreous shells; others were prepared from the less shiny kinds. COPPER Ornaments. Bells probably were used as beads. They were made by casting, have globular bodies and stone clappers, and appear identical to those found in the cultures of central Mexico. Small hook-shaped objects of copper also may have been used as ornaments since in one instance 6 of them were found about the skull of a burial. Possibly they were used as ear or nose ornaments. DISCUSSION As is pointed out several times in the above descriptive account, many of the characteristic Chalchihuites traits were widespread in central Mexico in aboriginal times. The idea that the Chalchihuites province represents perhaps the most northerly extension of the Mesoamerican culture area has been advanced for many years. 126 [ XXI, 2, 1955</page><page sequence="6">LISTER AND HOWARD ] CHALCHIHUITES CULTURE OF NORTHWESTERN MEXICO Our analysis of material from southern Du- rango certainly substantiates this concept. A more or less continuous distribution of Meso- american cultures can be traced from Durango and Sinaloa southward into Central America. Chalchihuites culture elements which show affiliation with other cultures of the Meso- american area include the following: 1. Red on brown pottery. A tradition for making brown pottery with red decoration seems to have been widely spread over a large part of western Mexico. The distribution of such wares can be traced from Oaxaca to the valleys of Mexico and Toluca, and northward to highland Michoacan, northern Jalisco, Sina- loa, Zacatecas, and Durango. All of the red on brown wares found over this vast area have a certain uniformity of color, designs, shapes, and temporal spread suggestive of some rela- tionship. In fact, even the red on brown wares of the Hohokam and Mogollon cultures of the American Southwest may possibly be included in this tradition, although it is realized that such wares seem to be earlier in the South- west than in Mexico. In western Mexico red on brown pottery is quite characteristic of the Toltec, or Chichimec, horizon dated in a general way from A.D. 900 to 1200. Specifically, Chalchihuites red on brown shows a number of similarities with Sinaloa red on buff which is found along the coast of Sinaloa and northern Nayarit. Many of the design elements and the arrangements of de. signs in a band about the exteriors of vessels are almost identical in the 2 areas (Ekholm 1942: 46-8; Kelly 1938: 18-19, P1. 7). Many years ago Kelly commented on the basic simi- larity between Chalchihuites sherds collected by Mason in Durango and red on brown sherds from coastal Sinaloa. She noted that this simi- larity may prove to be a fundamental bond between the plateau and the coast (Kelly 1938: 42, footnote). Brand also has written of the similarity between the red on brown of north- ern Durango and the red on brown of the Aztatlan complex (Brand 1939: 102). 2. Cloisonne pottery. The cloisonne technic of decoration, both on pottery and gourd ves- sels, seems to have had an important center in western Mexico (Ekholm 1942: 94-5). This style of paint decoration also was used in the Valley of Mexico and Yucatan. Where paint cloisonne appears in datable Mesoamerican cul- tures, it is assignable to the Toltec horizon. 3. Pottery trade wares. Both the polychrome and incised polychrome sherds from the Du- rango sites resemble wares of the Aztatlan com- plex of coastal Sinaloa very closely (Kelly 1938: 18-19, P1. 4). Likewise, a sherd bearing the incised figure of a feathered serpent is sug- gestive of feathered serpent designs on vessels found at Cojumatlan, Michoacan (Lister 1949: 27-8). The feathered serpent motif employed on pottery is characteristic of the culture of the Mixteca-Puebla area of central Mexico. Mixteca-Puebla influence has been demon- strated to have spread northward from its home in the Puebla-Oaxaca area to the central high- lands of Mexico, to the Lake Chapala area, Michoacan, to Nayarit, and to coastal Sinaloa, during the latter part of the Toltec horizon. The Aztatlan complex of Sinaloa contains many elements traceable to the Mixteca-Puebla. 4. Smoking pipes. This is another element in which similarity between the plateau of southern Durango and the Sinaloa coast may be pointed out. The Chalchihuites pipes, both the undecorated variety and the style with incised stem, are strikingly like those from Guasave, Sinaloa, which is an Aztatlan com- plex site (Ekholm 1942: 83-5). 5. Hollow effigy. Although not known to occur commonly in the Chalchihuites culture, the one specimen examined is reminiscent of large hollow figurines from the Nayarit-Colima area. 6. Copper. Metal working is said not to have reached Mexico until Toltec times. How- ever, once the technics were introduced from Central America, they spread northward throughout the area of Mesoamerican cultures. The Chalchihuites-culture copper ornaments are definitely in the tradition of central and western Mexico metallurgy. Whether they were worked locally or were trade pieces can- not be stated. 7. A number of the Chalchihuites traits cannot be compared with specific Mesoameri. can cultures since they are so widely distributed as not to be diagnostic. However, some such items may be listed since they tend to show that Chalchihuites culture is predominately Mesoamerican. Typical elements of Meso- american culture found in the Chalchihuites province, which have not been previously listed, consist of such items as: brown utility pottery, 127</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY tripod vessel supports, annular bases for ves- sels, the chile grinder, spindle whorls, clay figurines, and obsidian flake blades. From the above discussions of Chalchihuites traits it is apparent that the culture flourished, at least in part, during the Toltec horizon which has been dated A.D. 900 to 1200. Some of the outstanding characteristics which have been listed as appearing during this horizon in Meso- america include, among others: the appearance of metal, the rise of Mixteca-Puebla culture to prominence, and large scale movements of peoples (Caso 1953). When the archaeology of the whole of western Mexico is considered, it becomes evi- dent that it was during the Toltec horizon that the most widespread cultural development took place. It appears that during this period many cultural provinces existed in western Mexico. They each had distinguishing features, but also there was an underlying similarity throughout the area which may be explained by tribal movement causing contact, trade, and ex- changes of intellectual achievements. The Chalchihuites province was but one of several such cultural manifestations which flourished at that time. The question of the direction of contacts between Chalchihuites culture and other Meso- american cultures should be considered. Were the contacts made directly south along the eastern edge of the Sierra Madre Occidental with the lake region of Jalisco and Michoacan, or was there communication westward with the culture of coastal Sinaloa, which possessed many central Mexican traits? It appears to me that Chalchihuites culture was influenced from both directions, and also to a lesser degree from the north, as will be pointed out shortly. I visualize the basic Chalchihuites culture as hav- ing spread from, or having received strong in- fluence from, central Mexico by way of high- land Michoacan and Jalisco. Also, I believe that there was considerable communication be- tween the Chalchihuites area and the Sinaloa- Nayarit coast. This, despite the formidable bar- rier presented by the rugged Sierra Madre Oc- cidental. Several rivers, such as the Vueltes- Culiacan, Remedios-San Lorenzo, Presidio, and Mesquital-San Pedro, cut through the moun- tains from the plateau to the coast. The valleys and canyons of these rivers could have served as connecting links between the 2 areas. Even routes over and through the mountains should not be overlooked. Today the Huichols walk long distances through these same mountains. Enough specific resemblances occur between the Chalchihuites culture and the Aztatlan complex of the coast to show cultural contact. It is not believed at this time that Aztatlan culture received its central Mexican traits by way of Zacatecas and Durango, although it is a possibility. A case for the spread of culture, specifically Mixteca-Puebla, from the central Mexican highlands to the west coast by way of the lake country of Michoacan and Jalisco, through the mountains in the vicinity of Tepic, Nayarit, and then up the coast as far as north- ern Sinaloa has been presented by Ekholm (Ekholm 1942: 130). There is no apparent reason to differ with this concept. Therefore, the northern spread of culture from central Mexico in Toltec times appears, generally speaking, to have been in the form of a Y. The stem divided in the vicinity of Lake Chapala; the left branch went up the west coast and the right branch stayed east of the Sierra Madre Occidental. Once the influence reached its northern limits in Sinaloa and Durango, a certain amount of intercourse took place over and through the mountains. Finally, a few observations may be made in regard to Chalchihuites-Southwestern connec- tions. Although Chalchihuites culture is pre- dominately Mesoamerican, a few elements oc- curring in it are more typical of the Southwest than of Mesoamerica, which may represent in- fluence from the Southwestern area. Since the traits in question appear to be more highly developed in the Southwest than in Zacatecas and Durango, it is felt that the direction of influence was from north to south. Stone axes may be a Southwestern trait which spread into Mexico; however, both the three-quarter-grooved and full-grooved axes are more widely spread throughout western Mexico than has generally been assumed. Both types are found as far south as the Middle Rio Balsas basin of Guerrero. Nevertheless, axes do ap- pear more commonly in northwestern Mexico than in more southerly areas. We have noted the abundance of axes in the Chalchihuites culture. This fact, especially in light of the scarcity of celts which were commonly used as wood working implements in Mesoamerica, points to the presence of the ax in the Chalchi- huites province as being due to Southwestern influence. 128 [ XXI, 2, 1955</page><page sequence="8">LISTER AND HOWARD] CHALCHIHUITES CULTURE OF NORTHWESTERN MEXICO Shell ornaments are abundant in the Chal- chihuites area. Shells also were used exten- sively for ornaments at Guasave, Sinaloa. Ek- holm has shown several likenesses to exist between the Guasave shell work and that of the Hohokam culture of southern Arizona, and he believes that certain shell carving styles, and perhaps the idea of using shells as a medium, may have come from the Southwest (Ekholm 1942: 109-11). In the Chalchihuites shell work also there are resemblances to that of the Hohokam. The circular bracelets with carved umbo and the well-formed human and animal effigy beads especially correspond to those found in the Southwest and probably indicate connections between the 2 regions. The practice of painting small naturalistic human and animal figures on red on brown pottery in the Chalchihuites province also is reminiscent of the Hohokam culture of the Southwest. The designs are not identical, but the Durango examples are suggestive of those of the Hohokam. Once again the question of the route of contact arises when Chalchihuites-Southwest- ern connections, or the larger problem of Mexi- can-Southwestern connections, are considered. Ekholm's survey in Sonora has shown that a west coast corridor does not seem a likely route, unless it is assumed that traits were transferred by travelers or traders who crossed great areas inhabited by peoples of relatively low culture (Ekholm 1942: 136). On the basis of present information, the plateau area of Chihuahua does not seem to have been the route. Might the great mountain range of western Mexico, the Sierra Madre Occidental, have served as a corridor for the spread of cultures both north and south? Such mountainous masses usually are considered to be barriers to movement rather than corridors, but in dealing with aborigines who were great foot travelers, would the mountains have been such a great barrier? They have a north-south axis with many longi- tudinal valleys, contain permanent water, and are cooler than the areas on either side because of the greater elevation. Could aborigines have used the mountains for communication pur- poses, and spread out onto the adjacent plateau and coast for permanent settlement? The problem of correlating certain cultural elements common to the Southwest and Mexico, including those mentioned in this paper as well as others, is becoming less dif- ficult as the Mesoamerican chronology is pushed back in time.
