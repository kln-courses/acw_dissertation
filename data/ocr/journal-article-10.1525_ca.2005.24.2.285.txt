<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> MICHAEL KOORTBOJIAN Mimesis or Phantasia? Two Representational Modes in Roman Commemorative Art The commemorative forms of the Romans are marked by the ubiquity of two contrasting presentational modes: one essentially mimetic, rooted in the representational power of artistic forms, the other abstract and Wgurative, dependent on the presentation of cues for the summoning of absent yet necessary images. The mimetic mode was thoroughly conventional, and thus posed few problems of interpretation; the Wgurative knew no such orthodoxy and required a diVerent and distinctive form of attention. At the tomb, epigraphic and sculptural forms, each in its characteristic manner, addressed an audience habituated by tradition to respond to both of these modes, to grasp their diVerences, and to rise to the challenge implicit in the very fact of their contrast. In his Ars Poetica, amidst his discussion of the theatre, Horace remarked that sight was the most reliable of senses: “things impressed on the mind by means of the ears stimulate it less actively than those presented to it by the trustworthy eyes 1, which the spectator can see for himself.” But as Horace went on to point out, certain things should not be depicted—merely described— so as to insure a sense of propriety: “let not Medea butcher her sons before the eyes of the people, nor nefarious Atreus cook human entrails in public.” Aspects of this discussion have been presented, over the course of the last decade, in Seattle, Rome, London, Baltimore, New York, and Toronto; comment and criticism on all those occasions have contributed to its present state, and for advice and assistance of various kinds I would like to thank, in particular, Bettina Bergmann, Richard Brilliant, Christina Corsiglia, Elaine Gazda, Christine Kondoleon, Miranda Marvin, Susanna Muth, Ellen Perry, Will Stenhouse, and Paul Zanker; it should not need to be said that they bear no responsibility for what follows.

So, for example, in a well-known painting of Pompeii’s “House of the Fatal Loves” [Wg. 1], those unseemly events so central to Medea’s story are only signaled proleptically by her brooding pose, which is in such stark contrast to the carefree image of her children who are unaware of what their mother contemplates; similarly, in this picture’s pendants, Phaedra contemplates the course of her actions, and the horriWc denouement of her unbridled lust for Hippolytus has yet to lead to his tragic death; and, in the third of the room’s paintings, Helen contemplates Paris’ invitation—an event whose ultimate consequence, the Trojan War, would inevitably have been called to mind by any ancient observer 2. Horace’s commentary distinguished between two diVerent categories of ex- perience. While things both seen by the eyes and heard by the ears are rooted in perception, he declared that the visual impresses itself upon the mind more forcefully and more importantly more directly 3— — . The distinction suggests a belief that while vision perceives reality, in the case of hearing, in those in- stances in which one hears a narrative, description mediates reality: in the con- text of the theatre, what is merely heard would need to be reconceived by the mind, as sense perception was transformed by the imagination. Thus, implicit in Horace’s prescriptions for the stage are a characterization of two distinc- tive representational modes, one that depends primarily on the mimetic power of visual representation, the other on the capacity of spectators to mentally transform verbal description into an adequate (albeit not too powerful) repre- sentation of the narrated scene. This was a fundamentally Greek tradition. The ancients understood this sort of mental transformation and its cognitive repre- sentations, which they termed phantasiai; they distinguished these from what was presented to the senses, and which they understood as a form of imitation of reality, something they knew as mimesis. As ancient theatre and painting made plain, these two diVerent aspects of mental life, mimesis and phantasia, played a distinctive role in ancient representations; one was grounded in exter- nal reality, the other expanded on that reality by means of the powers of mind. In the arts of antiquity the visual arts in particular both played roles;4, , , the nature of those roles, however, and the character of their eVects in any given case, require explication and explanation—something the present essay hopes to provide 5. 2.

AN ANCIENT DISTINCTION The ancient sources oVer some direction. Horace’s comments, and their context, recall another apposite example. In his account of ancient painters in his Natural History, Pliny tells of Timanthes and his portrayal of the “SacriWce of Iphigenia”: orators have sung the praises of his Iphigenia . . . awaiting her doom; the artist has shown all present full of sorrow, and especially her uncle [Menelaus], and has exhausted all the indications of grief, yet has veiled the countenance of her father [Agamemnon] himself whom he was unable adequately to portray 6. Like the painted tragedies of the “House of the Fatal Loves,” Timanthes’ Iphigenia was also reXected in the repertory of subjects that adorned the walls of Pompeian houses [Wg 2] 7. , and it too Wgured a response to our distinction between mimesis and phantasia. Cicero had long before employed the example of Timanthes’ Iphigenia in his discussion of decorum, similarly arguing that, “Agamemnon’s head must be veiled because he could not portray that supreme sorrow with his brush 8.” Agamemnon’s veiled head is an iconographic motif with a very long history, but this is not our concern here. Nor is the problem of decorum, the context in which these anecdotes from our sources almost exclusively Wgure;9 decorum does not do these anecdotes justice—for there is more at stake here. In fact, Quintilian points the way towards a fuller appreciation of these matters. In his discussion of the same theme, he presses the issue to its full conclusion and signals the properly theoretical framework in which this bit of ancient art criticism took its rightful place—theoretical in the ancient sense of an adequate intellectual account of a given natural phenomenon’s logic and structure. As Quintilian states it: He [sc. Timanthes] had given Menelaus an agony of sorrow beyond which his art could not go. Having exhausted his powers of emotional expression he was at a loss to portray the father’s face as it deserved, and solved the problem by veiling his head and leaving his sorrow to the estimation of each individual spectator [emphasis added] 10. 6. Plin. H.N. 35.73–74: eius enim est Iphigenia oratorum laudibus celebrata, qua stante ad aras peritura cum maestos pinxisset omnes praecipueque patruum et tristitiae omnem imaginem consumpsisset, patris ipsius voltum velavit, quem digne non poterat ostendere. 7.

For Quintilian, the full horror of Agamemnon’s expression, dictated by the tragic circumstances, was more powerful as suggestion than depiction—better imagined than represented. Ultimately, the real lesson of Timanthes’ painting (as Quintilian, and also Valerius Maximus 11, had recognized) was that the spectator played a necessary and active role in establishing not only such a painting’s aVect and its meaning, but in the fullest possible sense, what it represented. The ancients themselves provide eloquent testimony to this artistic phe- nomenon of leaving the fulWllment of imagery to the memory and imagination of the spectator. But this expressive strategy was not always acknowledged, since in discussions of memory and imagination in relationship to the visual arts, fol- lowing the precepts of the ancient rhetoricians, imagination is generally seen as fundamentally dependent on memory—hence, by implication, on experience, sense perception and ultimately mimesis 12, , . Often it is a famous series of archi- tectural metaphors that is evoked, metaphors rooted in the legendary account of Simonides’ ability to recall the seating arrangements of guests at a banquet after the hall in which they were dining collapsed, burying and disWguring them. Just as Roman oratorical tradition exploited this story by enlisting the architectural analogy to organize the material of a speech in such a way that it might be recalled, serially, as Simonides had done, by associating its parts with the various rooms of a house 13, art historical treatments of memory have generally literalized those metaphors in the discussion of architectural ensembles. Such analyses, while in some instances of great interest and insight, merely extend the discussion of the famed loci et imagines, reversing the process of their rhetorical metaphorization, and now focus on real architecture, employing the memory-system as a cue to discerning meaning 14. Yet this renowned system of loci et imagines tells only part of the story of ancient mnemotechnics; its predominance in accounts of ancient memory demonstrates how the Greek philosophical tradition’s fundamental concern with the epistemological and physiological aspects of memory, while not entirely 11. Val. Max. 8.11, ext. 6: “Did he not confess by veiling Agamemnon’s head that the bitterness of deepest grief cannot be expressed in art? So his painting is wet with the tears of the soothsayer and the friend and the brother, but left the father’s weeping to be judged by the emotion of the spectator.” 12. Webb 1997: 123–24 (following Pedrick and Rabinowitz 1986). 13. Simonides’ feat is related at Quint. 11.2.11–13; the memory system is the subject of Quint. 11.2.1–50; see the fundamental treatments of Yates 1966; Carruthers 1990; Coleman 1993. 14. For sophisticated application of these ancient ideas to the painted decoration of Roman domestic interiors, see Bergmann 1994 and Rouveret 1989: 303–79; Bodel 1997 provides an alternative approach. </page> <page sequence="5"> koortbojian: Mimesis or Phantasia? 289 forgotten, was subordinated in the rhetorical and oratorical treatises to the more practical issue of “memorization.” By contrast, the realization that visual or verbal images might prompt or engender such mental images was a staple of Aristotelian tradition. The ancients, astutely aware of the apparent presence of things recalled, did not hesitate to recognize that so often memory functioned, as Aristotle had put it by means of some such thing as a picture 15, “ .” Indeed, reminiscence provides us, quite literally, with mental images that seemingly represent the material “actuality” of the past, as memory imitates sense perception. Aristotle, however, was also acutely aware of the immediacy of phantasiai, mental images that were distinguished indeed divorced from sense perception 16— — . The diVerence is essential. For Aristotle, imagination was dependent on memory for its material, but not limited to memory for its speciWc content; while memory might be regarded as a mimetic faculty, the imagination knew no such limitations. Although on the one hand memory images were powerfully mimetic, as when visual sense perceptions might be recalled (for instance, I am moved when I recall and, as it were, picture in my mind what my childhood home looked like), on the other hand, mental images might not be mimetic at all, as when we have a phantasia of something fearful and yet remain unaVected (as we may be unmoved when we look at a painting of a horriWc scene). This comparison (drawn from Arist. De Anima 3.3 = 427b) demonstrates that while the form of the phantasia (which is likened to a painting) is mimetic, its content, not speciWcally the product of sense perception, is not. The distinction, between what was visible to the eye and what was conceivable to the mind, played a role in early aesthetics and is already fully articulated by the third century bc; Plutarch reports that: most people, as Arcesilaus said, think it right to examine poems and paintings and statues of others with the eyes of both the mind and the body, poring over them minutely and in every detail. . . . Plut. De tranq. anim. 470 Similar and related ancient testimonia are well known: one need only recall Horace’s famous castigation of centaurs, mermaids, and the like—all of which might exist in the mind, or in art, but never in life; or Vitruvius’ excoriation of “those monsters [that] are now painted in frescoes rather than reliable images of deWnite things 17.” And by the beginning of the third century AD, the contrast between mimesis and phantasia in artistic practice might be made explicit; in a dialogue in Philostratus we read: 15. De memoria et reminiscentia 450a. Such visual memories are to be distinguished, however, from other forms of reminiscence which persist without the aid of mental imagery (e.g., sensations). 16. Amid a huge bibliography, see SchoWeld 1978/1992; Frede 1992; and Watson 1982. The recent account oVered in Perry 2004: 150–71 does not pay suYcient attention to this fundamental distinction. 17. Hor. A.P. 1; Vitr. 7.5.3; cf., however, Lucretius’ materialist explanation at 4.732–48. </page> <page sequence="6"> 290 classical antiquity Volume 24/No. 2 /October 2005 – Did Phidias and Praxiteles and the rest go up to heaven, then, and take an impression of the gods’ appearances so as to reproduce it, or was there some other inXuence controlling their work? – Indeed, there was—something rich in wisdom. – What? You can’t Wnd anything other than imitation (mimesis) surely. – Yes; phantasia did this work, a more cunning craftsman than your imitation. Mimesis will fashion what she has seen, phantasia also what she has not seen 18. Now it need hardly be emphasized that a fascination with those aspects of mind that have been underscored here was not a strictly ancient phenomenon. Clearly, the structural dynamics of spectator response is a fundamental concern for the interpretation of art of all periods;19 but despite some signiWcant eVorts 20, , these matters—as they pertain to the art of the Romans—have not received their due, with respect to either their historical contextualization, or to their theoretical elaboration. The focus of what follows, a series of works of art whose imagery—indeed, whose very structure—was designed so as to encourage the solicitation of mental imagery, is merely one aspect of the larger question of spectatorship. While not only, or even primarily, a Roman artistic phenomenon, for the sake of coherence and concision, the following pages address such a solicitation of mental imagery in a discussion of two related Roman aspects of the commemorative arts. While the speciWc examples diVer in genre, in format, and in time period—and purposely so—all exploit the phenomenon of mind that is implicated in Horace’s comments on Medea and Quintilian’s account of Timanthes’ Iphigenia. For in the private sphere of commemorative practice, despite the genre’s demonstrable conventions and formulae, artistic productions were free from the restraints imposed on public monuments and might at times move beyond the uniformity and conventionality of established modes of Selbstdarstellung 21. The personalization of commemorative practices vouchsafed memory’s ability to provide—with all the vividness at its command— what was required not only for a monument’s comprehension, but for its most commanding aVect. Indeed, commemorative imagery held for its prospective audience—especially for those immediate descendants who were its primary audience, if not its patrons—it held for them a distinctive authenticity, since such imagery so often testiWed to their own experience and invoked their personal memories in the form of mimetic images; for others (that is, those who had no 18.

The two sets of examples presented here—which concern the funerary monument and the tomb—are to be regarded as an initial attempt to sketch the breadth of such a practice’s purchase and the scope of its employ. II. MONUMENT AND EPITAPH On a well-known relief, now in the Capitoline Museum [Wg. 3], a woman mourns the death of her son who reclines, as if still alive, beneath the imago clipeata of his dead father 22. Under the watchful eyes of the older man, who no doubt served as an exemplum virtutis in death as in life, mother embraces son as if to declare that the bonds between them were not yet fully severed, to signal her refusal to acknowledge that Death should have been allowed to take him so quickly, and to represent her desire to remain bound to him in death as in life. Given its size and format, the relief most likely graced the facade of the tomb, where its representation of an interior setting advertised the omnipresent funerary metaphor that regarded the tomb as the “house” of the dead (cf. Section III, below). The sentiment such a scene was intended to instill may be recuperated. By the end of the Wrst century AD when the Capitoline relief was produced, such imagines clipeatae, originally military in their signiWcance, would have been a well known Wxture in the domestic setting if we are to believe the elder Pliny 23- . The broader sense of the relief’s imagery depends not only on our comprehension of the diVering status of mother, father, and son—that is, who is alive and who is dead, and for how long—but on our recognition that the ancients’ representations continued to play a living role in the experience of those who survived them 24“ ” . Indeed, it is imagery like that on the Capitoline relief that Tacitus evokes when, in his discussion of the mourning for Germanicus, he asks, “Where were those images of the ancients the image placed at the head of the couch? 25, ” Such a setting no doubt enhanced the shield portraits’ anthropomorphism, if not their verisimilitude, 22. Winkes 1969: 213–15; Winkes 1979; Becatti 1942; Wrede 1977: esp. 404V.; and most recently D’Ambra 1995. 23. Military origin: Plin. N.H. 35.12 (at the Temple of Bellona, ca. 495 BC: anachronistic and incorrect—see LTUR 1 [1993], s.v. Bellona, Aedes in Circo [A. Viscogliosi], for a restoration by Ap. Claudius Pulcher, tr. 33 BC); origin of domestic usage, ibid. (in the house of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, ca. 78 BC). For painted portraits on gilded shields set up in public in Wrst-century Sardis, see IGR iv.1756, lines 48, 71, 79 = Buckler and Robinson 1914: 331–33; further, Blanck 1968, and for the public role of such clipei, cf. the golden image of Germanicus set up in the portico of the Temple of Apollo on the Palatine: evidence and discussion in Corbier 1992: 893–900. 24. Cf. D’Ambra 1995: 672 on the conventionality of such “family portraits” amongst the freedman class, and 674 for the probable status of the group on the Capitoline relief—freedman father and freeborn son. 25. Tac. Ann. 3.5. </page> <page sequence="8"> 292 classical antiquity Volume 24/No. 2 /October 2005 as it so evidently made the life of the domus the focus of their gaze. Tilted out from their position high on the wall—as can be seen in their representations in Campanian painting26—the setting of these portraits of the ancestors must have seemed as if designed to allow them to enact a common metaphor, as they literally “watch over” the lives of their descendants, thus fulWlling an apotropaic notion implicit in the shields’ form. The Romans continually cast the dead in such a role. The idea of their “watching over” the living helps to evoke the full potency of the Capitoline relief’s imagery, which oVers visible testimony to the power of the paterfamilias and, in its own modest way, a demonstration of that hereditary dignity that was the essence of mos maiorum; as the dead might be so conceived, so too the living were obliged to watch over them with continued enactment of the traditional sacra and care for their tombs 27. Yet, one rightly asks, can the relief’s visualized claim—that such familial bonds might extend beyond the boundary of life and death28—be anything other than a dream? Indeed, this imagery fulWlls such a dream of uniting the dead with the living; it gives this dream both form and permanence, and thus provides its visual corollary. Such imagery is echoed when Propertius recounts the dream in which his lover appears to him and he tells of how “Cynthia seemed to bend over my couch’s head, Cynthia so lately buried beside the roaring road, as fresh from love’s entombment I slept a broken sleep. . . .” Ovid similarly describes how Morpheus appears in the form of Ceyx and “stands before the couch of his despairing wife,” Alcyone. Or again, according to Ovid, how Aesculapius might appear in a dream, standing before the sleeper’s couch, as he had traditionally in the imagery of the incubation rite 29. And it is again the same when the illustrator of the Vatican Vergil [Wg. 4] would depict how Hector would appear to Aeneas in his dream in somnis ante oculos 30, . . . . These correspondences—the relief’s domestic setting denoted by the kline, the couch’s implication of sleep, and implicitly, of dreams, and the watchful role of one already deceased—suggest that the presence in the domus of such real imagery provided the model, not only for our relief, but for the phantasiai of dreams. That is, since real clipei were accustomed to be so displayed, one dreamed of their reviviWcation, as lived reality conditioned imagination and guaranteed its vividness. 26. Winkes 1979: 483; cf. Ling 1991: 157 and Wg. 168 (Pompeii I,9,1: House of the Beautiful Impluvium), Wg. 25 (Oplontis, room 23, east wall). 27. Cf.

Verg. Aen. 2.269–71 = MS Vat. Lat. 3225, fol. xxiv) or the similar visual formula employed for the apparition of the Penates to Aeneas (Aen. 3.147–52 = Vat. Lat. 3225, fol. xxviii). </page> <page sequence="9"> koortbojian: Mimesis or Phantasia? 293 Such dreams were a comfort, and portraits like the clipeus seen on the Capitoline relief were intended to provide solace—as, no doubt, was the Capitoline relief itself. Other monuments make the claim explicitly; thus an epitaph from Rome declares, In place of you I keep a likeness, as a comfort for us, which we piously cherish and many a garland is oVered [to it] 31, . Or, on another, When [your parents] gaze upon your features you will give solace 32, . But, at times, such real, sculpted imagery might oVer little consolation, and in such instances the dead would live on solely in memory, in interior images that might bring the only true solace. Statius invokes once again the same imagery of portrait hanging over couch when he writes, as though speaking to a friend newly deceased of the wife he has left behind: But you she worships, with you she has communion in her being’s inmost depths; she wins but empty solace from your countenance which, carved to your likeness in gold, shines above her couch and broods over her untroubled slumbers 33. So we see that while visual images were capable of encouraging the Xeeting illusion that the dead might still live, their power might give way to emotions, and to those emotions’ imagined correlative: one felt the enduring presentness of the dead in the solace such mental images might continually aVord. What Statius evokes is not only a profound sentiment of unassuageable grief, but a realization of how a portrait’s ability to manifest the “presentness” of one now lost pales beside the imagistic power of memory and the immediacy of those emotions that memory brings in its train. The same might be said for phantasiai and dreams—so Cicero acknowledged in the Somnium Scipionis, when he had the younger Africanus relate how the elder Scipio came to him in a dream: “[he] revealed himself in the form that I knew from his imago rather than from his 31.

Indeed, Cicero’s account provides eloquent testimony to the interrelationship of those topoi evoked by the Capitoline relief—ancestors’ portraits, the “leaning over the couch,” the presence of the dead in dreams—and the vividness these might customarily conjure. The sculpted and epigraphic funerary monuments might acknowledge both of these aspects—the tangibly visual and the ineVably imagined—at once. For example, on a monument from North Africa we read: Here lies Varius Frontonianus, whom his charming wife Cornelia Galla has buried here. To revive the sweet solaces of their earlier life, she added his marble image, so that for a long time she would be able to satisfy her eyes and her soul with his dear form. This sight will be her comfort. For a pledge of love is preserved in the breast (pectore) by the sweetness of mind; nor will his lips be lost in easy oblivion; but while life remains, her husband is totally within her heart (toto in corde) 35. On Varius’ monument, his portrait had a two-fold purpose. His imago not only brought him before his wife’s eyes, as the sculpted form feigned his appearance; more importantly, it was to function here as a visual cue for a whole host of images Cornelia preserved within her. These were her memories, those “sweet solaces” which were to be called forth by the vision of her husband’s features. Varius’ portrait we are told will be her comfort 36, , “ ” —yet its true vividness was not to be found carved upon the marble of his funerary plaque, but harbored within Cornelia’s breast. The portrait enshrined upon his memorial served to prompt not only an emotive response, but this in turn unleashed a Xood of powerful mental images. To call these memory images forth was a fundamental purpose of the commemorative monuments. The locus of such powerful feelings—and the memories that accompany them—was variously reported. Varius’ wife preserved them in her breast, within her heart. Similarly, Ovid held that they were evoked by love and linked to the 34. Cic. Rep. 6.10V.; cf. the same reference to the recognizability of the portrait at De Fin. 5.2.4, on the memory of Carneades, quem videre videor (est enim nota imago); cf. Lucr. 4.1061–62. 35.

Here, in an eVort to evoke even greater vividness, the conventional analogy to sight—“the eye of the mind”—is connected to a more corporeal metaphorics. Sorrow, like love or virtue, was thought to be sealed within the breast, and the physical eVects of each of these feelings might be considered the substantive and forceful aspect of memory. So Cicero declared in the Wrst of his Philippics that, although the tyrannicides, Brutus and Cassius, were unable to be present in the gathered assembly, “they were yet present, held fast within the marrow (in medullis) and innermost Xesh (in visceribus) of the Roman people 38.” In similar fashion, according to Dio, Maecenas told Augustus: You must depend on your good deeds to provide for you any additional splendor. And you should never permit gold or silver images of yourself to be made, for they are not only costly but also invite destruction and last only a brief time. Rather, by your benefactions fashion other images in the souls (ψυχ ) of your people, images that will never tarnish or perish. And likewise, Tacitus reports that Tiberius, as he declined the honor of a Temple to his divinity, proclaimed to the Senate his accomplishments and officia, saying: These are my temples, within your spirits (in animis), these my fairest and abiding eYgies: for those that are reared of stone, should the judgment of the future turn to hatred are scorned as sepulchers 39, . While the idea of memories held in the heart, in the breast, or in the marrow was a topos 40, it nonetheless served to express, at times in the most moving fashion, the fully physical anguish that might accompany commemoration: that anguish was memory s powerful correlative one that might last forever 41’ , . Thus does Lucan recount Cornelia’s plaint, which gives voice to the power of her memory and proclaims the vividness and force of her interior vision: Shall I never be allowed to give due burial to a husband? Shall I never mourn over an urn that contains ashes? But what need is there of a grave, or why does grief require any trappings? Do I not . . . carry Pompey 37. Ov. Pont. 1.9.7–9.

Does not his image cling to my innermost being (imis visceribus)?42 Such images—taken to heart and held in the breast—were memories of life. As they were recalled from experience, these fundamentally mimetic images supplied the quintessential bond that linked loved ones across the boundary that divided the dead from the living 43. Yet the wholly distinctive quality of mental images is that they can ex- ceed the brute facts of our daily, material, existence; they can exist purely in the ideal. As we have seen, the Romans, like the Greeks, were fully aware that the mind has the power not only to create but to retain images that are unfettered by the contingencies that deWne our relations with the real world around us. Such imagery belongs not to the objective world outside, but to the personal world within, and is, eVectively, a part of us. Thus, perhaps not so paradoxically, one might abjure a portrait likeness in order to transform the experience of a monument, and to heighten the role of one’s memory, or the force of one’s phantasia, in that experience. A “real” imago might give way to a more powerful imagined one, as is proclaimed on a funerary inscription from Etruria: Here lies the lifeless body of my cherished step-daughter, an innocent, whom the Fates have overwhelmed by a bitter death (for not yet had she fulWlled her tenth year); to me the Fates have cruelly granted a sad old age. For I shall seek you continually, my darling Asiatica, and in my sadness I shall continually imagine your features: and this will be my comfort, that now and again I shall see you. And when my life is Wnished, I will join my shade to yours 44. In this instance sculptural forms were forsaken altogether, and the commemorative inscription demands a more focused form of attention. The sentiments here given voice were the province of memory or of imagination, which would provide 42. Luc. 9.67–72. Cf. Apul. Met. 8.8–9. 43. Cf. further AEp 1913: 134, lines 55–59, where L.

Thus these “images” might not only be varied, but plentiful, as the young girl is remembered now from one context, now another. She might be variously imagined—as she looked shortly before she died, as a ten-year old girl, or as she appeared in her early childhood years. And while one’s memories might be limited by experience, one’s phantasiai knew no such bounds. This representational form was not unique. Asiatica’s inscription, as it recalls, in both mode and diction, Ovid’s letter written from Pontus to Graecinus at Rome, suggests a widespread practice. Ovid imagines himself at his friend’s inauguration as consul and thus demonstrates that one could think in this fashion of the living, not just the dead: Yet I will use my mind, which alone is not exiled, to behold your robe and fasces. [My mind] shall see you now dispensing justice to the people, and shall fancy itself present unseen at your actions; now it shall believe that you are bringing beneath the spear the revenues of the long lustrum and contracting for everything with minute good faith; now that you are uttering eloquent words before the senate, seeking what the interest of the state demands; now that you are proposing thanks on behalf of the godlike Caesars or smiting for them the white throats of choice oxen 46, . . . . As Graecinus might be imagined on the Capitol, so Asiatica might be, once again, among the living; these were quintessentially vivid images, and the presentness they aVorded—in the sense of both hic et nunc—was conceived of as palpable. As Quintilian would declare, when explaining the vividness of the advocate’s language, the recourse to memory allowed the past to seem as though relived: When I am complaining [in court] that a man has been murdered, shall I not bring before my eyes all the circumstances which it is reasonable to imagine must have occurred in such a connection? Shall I not see the assassin burst suddenly from his hiding-place, the victim tremble, cry for help, beg for mercy, or turn to run? Shall I not see the fatal blow delivered and the stricken body fall? Will not the blood, the deathly pallor, the groan of agony the death rattle be indelibly impressed upon my mind?47, - , In all these examples—in Ovid, in Quintilian, and in the inscription for Asiatica— mental images partake of, indeed vie with, the character of life itself. For in all these instances, whether the workings of the imagination or of memory, everything takes place with profound immediacy and in the lived present, hic 45. Cf. Vitr. 9, pr. 16: “And thus those who have minds imbued with the joys of literature cannot fail to have the image (simulacrum) of Ennius the poet consecrated in their breasts (in suis pectoribus dedicatum) as if he were one of the gods. Those who devotedly delight in the poems of Accius not only seem to have the power of his words but also his portrait (figuram) present along with them” (trans. Rowland). 46. Ov.

So it was to be for Asiatica’s father: “now and again I shall see you. . . .” In these memories—and perhaps, phantasiai—Asiatica might move, live, and breathe. All those things that the Romans say about statues, all of which are never more than mere metaphor, now they would take on the vivacity of experience, if only in the mind: this would take place “now and again,” repeatedly 49, and this would be a comfort. Beyond the privileged role in which it cast her step-father, Asiatica’s epitaph evoked a commemorative image that depended on the participation of all its spectators: they were enjoined, upon reading her epitaph, to imagine themselves in the role of her parent—not only to empathize with his grief, but to imagine his memories. As a result, in the case of such a monument, both its content and the form of that content have become indistinguishable. III. THE TOMB While highly evocative, the epigraphic monument dedicated to Asiatica Wnds relatively few comparanda; for those who could aVord it, sculpture was both the conventional form and the established norm: in contrast to even the most stirring of epitaphs, it allowed one to see a monument’s content. In this sense the preference for images over texts corresponded, mutatis mutandis, to the hierarchi- cal evaluations of seeing and hearing espoused by Horace with which this essay began. The extreme case is presented by those instances in which the tomb itself became a representation, when its sculpted decor bridged a presumptive divide between art and architecture to eVect a greater verisimilitude. At times, however, even the most resplendently naturalistic decor might have served as merely the mimetic setting for a deliberate appeal to the spectators’ capacity to imagine. The tradition of elaborately appointed architectural interiors in tombs was long known in Italy. For example, ancient visitors to the large and sumptuous mid-fourth-century Tomb of the Reliefs at Cerveteri [Wg. 5] were overwhelmed by its remarkable display 50. Huge columns supported mock ceiling beams, all cut from the rock, and the tomb’s many surfaces were covered with painted stucco reliefs depicting the military and religious paraphernalia of aristocratic life. The chamber’s central niche was elaborated as a funerary couch, formed in relief. The couch’s cushions and mattress were rendered with great care, and between its carved legs the wall illusionistically receded, as though a real void lay beneath. Here, so it seems, the actual bodies of the dead once reclined, as if asleep, in aeternitate. 48. Cf. McCrone 2004. 49. Cf. Plin. Ep. 2.1.11–12: “For he lives and will live forever, and in a wider sense in our memories and on our lips, now that he has left our sight. . . . I see him (video), and in these dreams, so vivid and so vain, I speak to him, he answers, and I feel his presence near (audio adloquor teneo).” 50. See Blanck and Proietti 1986. </page> <page sequence="15"> koortbojian: Mimesis or Phantasia? 299 The funeral couch on which one was depicted reclining—either to sleep or to dine was a long established and ubiquitous symbol of the afterlife 51— - . Not only did it transform the dead’s eternal home in the tomb into the mirror of that they had enjoyed in life, but this speciWc imagery allowed a distinctive commentary on the relative advantages of the two abodes. Nowhere is this more evident than on the monument of one Rubrius Urbanus [Wg. 6], where his epitaph cynically points up the diVerence between art and life: He who, while life was granted him, always lived as a miser, parsimonious to his heir and envious even of himself, ordered that after he met his fate he should be artfully carved reclining here amiably, by a skilled hand. This was so that at least recumbent in death he might be able to rest, and reclining, he might enjoy peace and quiet. His son, who died following the camp before the sad last rites of his father, sits to his right. And so what do the dead have to gain from this amiable image? They should rather have lived in this way 52. Gaius Rubrius’ inscription aYrmed for all eternity those pleasures that had been but Xeeting in life. Yet his body was merely an image; those that once lay in the Tomb of the Reliefs made a larger claim. Their recumbent bodies were originally displayed in a fashion that one not only recognizes from so many painted and sculpted Etruscan works that preserve the motif, but from a famously evocative account of the mid-nineteenth-century discovery of the François Tomb at Vulci: The light of our torches lit those hollow rooms whose silence and darkness had not been troubled for more than twenty centuries. Everything was still the way it had been on the day the entrance had been closed, and ancient Etruria appeared to us just as when it was in its glory. On their funeral couches warriors, covered by their armor, seemed to be resting from the battles they had been waging against the Romans and our ancestors the Gauls. Shapes, garments, cloth, color, all were clearly distinguished for some minutes, then everything disappeared as the outside air came 51. Dentzer 1982. For the imagery of sleep, cf. also AEp 1966: 404, the epitaph of the freedwoman Scandilia Pamphila: Hospes, noli admirari quod sic me in lecto vid&lt;es&gt; recubante&lt;m&gt;, dormiente&lt;m&gt;, mortua sum simi [. . . dormire puta&lt;s&gt;. . . . 52.

The past which had been conjured up lasted no longer than a dream, and disappeared, as . . . these frail remnants turned to dust upon contact with the air 53. While this account of the evanescent vision of the tomb has been criticized as a romantic Wction it is echoed in reports of other such discoveries 54, , and the excavator himself had originally reported seeing pairs of corpses atop the four funerary couches 55. It is clear from other Etruscan works depicting funerary banquets that in the fourth century BC, on a visit to the tomb, the chamber’s representations would have left little to the imagination 56. This now empty tomb still has a profound—albeit diVerent—eVect on its beholders, and the reasons for this may be gleaned by a comparison. At a late Wrst-century AD tomb outside Cologne [Wg. 7], visitors were greeted by just such an empty subterranean chamber 57. At the center of the three main walls were large arcosolia, the bases of which were decorated so that they would appear as couches 58. From these details it is clear that they were to be understood as forming a triclinium, and that the room was designed to evoke a funerary banquet an imagery with a long history as we have seen 59— , . While one recognizes that at the Cerveteri tomb, where carved pillows atop the couches (and the absence of dining imagery) suggested sleep, on the relief of Rubrius Urbanus and in Cologne they Wgured the banquet; yet together all three of these examples demonstrate both the mutual relevance and common ground of the two metaphors invoked. In Cologne the banquet imagery was conWrmed [Wg. 8] by the presence of two elaborately carved stone chairs—precisely like those seen on contemporary funerary reliefs [Wg. 9], where the wife of the heroized deceased 53.

Here [Wg. 7] chairs and couches together served as the “stage-props” of a dramatic tableau, one whose imagery was realized on human scale, and whose implicit theatricality shared its space with its spectators. Such an interpretation of the Cologne tomb is conWrmed by the presence of triclinia at other tombs 61, and by funerary inscriptions that summon the visitors to join the dead in feasting 62 at times in perpetuum 63, , . But not always so. On a well-known monument now in Indianapolis [Wg. 10], the stretched-out form of the deceased, dressed in the himation, cup in hand, adjusts his crown, as if in preparation for the symposium; his inscription declares: Tiber was my home, I am called Agricola, also Flavius. I am reclining here for you to see. In this fashion, and in those past years which the fates gave me, I cultivated my soul, and never lacked Lyaeus [wine]. . . . Friends, you who read this, I admonish you, mix wine, and drink from afar, crowning your temples with Xowers, and don’t deny sex to beautiful girls: Whatever else is [left] after death the earth and Wre consume 64, . Like the epitaph of Rubrius Urbanus, that of Flavius, as it strikes its note of carpe diem, employs the image of one reclining on the couch to signal those pleasures of the living that were lost with one’s demise. No inscriptions were found at the Cologne site, and the traditional funerary banquet seems to have been evoked by the architectural and sculptural imagery 60.

Henzen 1858: 116–18; Hopkins 1983: 233. The idea of such “fellowship” with the dead is long-standing; cf. Nock 1944/1986: 152–55; it could be parodied as well: cf. CIL 6.2357 = ILS 8204, which concludes, Hospes, ad hunc tumulum / ne meias ossa precantur / tecta hominis, sed si gratus / homo es, misce bibe da mi (“Stranger, the buried bones of a man request you not to piss at this tomb, but, if you are an agreeable man, mix a drink, drink it, and give me some” [trans.

The dead themselves, while clearly the focus of that imagery, do not appear: the beholders were compelled by the tomb’s decoration to imagine their presence 65. Here the empty couches suggest that the place of honor was reserved for the dead so they might enjoy the companionship, the “table-fellowship,” of the celebrants who would come to remember them. Whether the imagery was meant to allude precisely to the funeral feast known as the silicernium, the dinner held at the tomb on the ninth day after death called the cena novendialis, the days of puriWcation celebrated by the survivors’ sitting amongst the dead, termed denicales feriae—or was a common factor among them all—matters little; what is striking is that here, at the tomb, the living sat while the dead reclined, as though the latter were now in deorum numero 66. Thus, at the Cologne tomb, a traditional metaphor of the after-life as a banquet was transposed into idiosyncratic visual form. Here the dead were evoked by an appeal either to memory or to imagination: the crucial aspect of this tomb’s imagery was mental imagery, and it was provided—as it were, projected—by the spectators, who animated those empty spaces in an interior vision, be it an act of recollection or one of imagination. That aVective bond between object and audience, essential to the meaningful experience of the tomb as a vehicle of cultural expression, was ultimately dependent on the active participation of those who not only beheld the tomb’s imagery, but augmented and fulWlled its representational claims. This was a monument that sought to recall life not by means of its imitation, but by engendering in the minds of its spectators a wholly distinctive series of representations, regardless of whether they depended on mimesis or phantasia. This distinctive form of attention and the representational mode that elicited it demonstrate in a singular manner the fundamental contrast proposed here be- tween monuments that re-present a once-lived actuality and those whose imagery demands the participation of the spectators’ imagination, independent of former experience. This may be gleaned from a comparison of the Cologne tomb’s im- agery [Wg. 7] with the experience of our Etruscan example [Wg. 5], the Tomb of the Reliefs—an experience that was originally rooted in a display of a striking realism. The Etruscan tomb’s conspicuously familiar setting exploited the pres- ence of real bodies, which were posed as if to enact—in perpetuity—a readily recognizable aspect of life that was immediately called forth by the elaborately confected setting. Yet time’s eVects have long since transformed that experience: as the bodies turned to dust, indeed vanished, the tomb’s demands on its spec- 65.

As Cicero’s comments reveal, the fact that the dead were represented as reclining assimilated them to the rite of the lectisternium, the imaginary feast shared with the deities whose images were set atop couches (a relationship to the lectisternium was suggested by one of the journal’s anonymous readers). </page> <page sequence="19"> koortbojian: Mimesis or Phantasia? 303 tators’ attention have been formulated anew. The vacant couches one Wnds today ask for something more than an acknowledgement that we witness a moment of the past, as if frozen in time. The central focus of the tomb—as a representational tableau—has become those now-empty spaces that had once housed the scene’s protagonists: their presence is not remembered, nor merely intuited, but wholly supplied, in the spectators’ imaginations. The fate of the Tomb of the Reliefs is that it has become what the Cologne tomb originally was—a distinctive mode of expression whose vividness is an index of both its spectators’ participation and their ability to form a mental image that complements, and fulWlls, the scene. * * * What has been sketched here, by means of these several examples of com- memorative forms, is the ubiquity, indeed the fundamentality, of two contrasting presentational modes: one essentially mimetic and, in the conventional sense, illusionistic, rooted in the representational power of artistic forms; the other, by contrast, abstract and Wgurative, depended on the presentation of cues for the summoning of the absent, yet necessary images—again, whether visual or verbal that were required for the realization of a monument s signiWcance 67— ’ . In the case of each of these examples, their function and meaning required more than their mere visibility, and more than an acknowledgment of their commemorative character. The various epitaphs demonstrated the fundamental pictorialism of poetic language, and its ability to evoke for its audience the powerful presentness of mental images, while the kline-tombs suggested how deliberate absences amid visual forms required of the spectator not only an obvious, and necessary, ful- Wllment, but the distinctive form of attention such a practice demanded. Each of the examples presented here shares with the others a common representational structure, one that demands that its audience rise to the challenge of its artistic language, respond to the cues they each oVered to memory and the imagination, and ultimately fulWll each monument’s purpose by the active participation in the manifestation of its meaning.
