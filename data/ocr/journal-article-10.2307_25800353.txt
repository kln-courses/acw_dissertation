It has been only in the last decade, perhaps, that a public and critical reception has been able to intimate, fully, Yvonne Rainer 's range as an artist. Until recently, most interpreta tions tended to segregate her art according to medium or genre (dance, film, and per formance), critical thematics (e.g., of femi nism and psychoanalysis in the films of the 1970s), or cultural and social issues (the interminable legacy of the 1960s as a vanish ing point of communal and participatory politics), or to collapse the stages of her work into more general aesthetic categories (postmodernism, post-Minimalism, New York's avant-garde, and the more recent durational or "time-based" art).' Sadly, Rainer's key early text, Work 1961-73, remains out of print.2 Yet this lag in reception is also due to Rainer's ongoing and changing pro duction, as she continues to choreograph, teach, and occasionally perform, and to make films, give lectures, and produce new critical essays alongside the republications of older manifestoes, interviews, and film scripts, rendering hers a still-living body of work in the most complex sense of the phrase. Consolidating this discussion are three recent books: Rainer's own memoir and two scholarly studies of differing scope and emphasis. Rainer's autobiographical account covers the period of her childhood (she was born in 1934) through the early 1980s, and concludes with anecdotes from the last few years that reflect on the hiatus between a renewed public interest in her practice as the product of an established cultural icon and the lived exigencies that were necessary to its development and are largely absent from its renewed recep tion. Lambert-Beatty's art-historical volume surveys Rainer's dance-based projects of the 1960s, to end with a brief discussion of Rainers early films of the 1970s, while Catherine Wood's short book focuses on the influential 1968 program, The Mind is a Muscle. Of necessity, Rainer's own book shifts emphasis decade by decade. Her life during the 1940s and 1950s divagates through family dynamics (anarchist parents trying to assimilate in WASPish society), singular moments of cultural formation (a passion for European films instilled by her father), diverse intellectual apprenticeships, and a somewhat conflicted but measured sense of promiscuity. Recounting her late adolescence and early adulthood, she evokes as historical texture the faces and shifting enclaves of an increasingly depoliticized Left, factionalized ethnicities, inchoate and covert sexualities, and sundry creative communities and non professionalized labor activities. Glimpses of lovers and intellectual role models intersect on a 1950s psychic landscape haunted, often tragically, by more and less crude intima tions and deeply entrenched realizations of an exiled and impoverished Freudian ego psychology. Rainer evokes this terrain with equal parts dissatisfaction and anxiety, a position that drove her toward the practice of dance, and away from engaged political activity and formalized intellectual pursuits. By all accounts her prowess in dance was never a matter of conventional training, but rather a pragmatic laboriousness that stood her past physically brilliant contemporaries. Dance, for her, was less a craft to be fetishized than an exercise to which one submitted. For Rainer it was initially an exercise in for getting the pull of social obligations in order to better realize a singularity that recurred between discrete public and institutional sites and transected a range of social con cerns without explicitly yielding her affini ties to any particular one. Such categorical resistance and self fashioning are not separable from larger critical and aesthetic questions raised by all three books. First, what was the historical specificity and critical engagement of avant garde performance at this time? How does Rainer's mostly deadpan art figure alongside painting and sculpture of the period, and in advance of much video and film? What are 131 art journal</page><page sequence="2">the terms of convergence and resistance (if any) of dance and performance in the emerging media landscape? How did perfor mance enable some artists to transect a range of social concerns without explicitly yield ing their affinities to any particular one? Most fundamentally, where and how does one locate the materiality and operations of performance during this period?what are the more extensive social regimes of the period that enable performance to appear as a mode of both representation and contesta tion? Providing an account of Rainer s cho reography that orients it insistently toward questions of spectatorship and mediated subjectivity, Lambert-Beatty offers the most explicit and sustained elaboration of these questions. Her book elaborates such issues through the rubric of what she terms "see ing difficulties," a phrase meant to call atten tion to the self-reflexivity of Rainer s art as it worked to forestall, on the one hand, the technical aspects of dance that yield dancers to viewers through illusionistic poses and movements, and, on the other, to refuse audiences a sustained, embodied engage ment with dance, in that its live temporality renders a cumulative synthesis nearly impos sible. Lambert-Beatty also means for the phrase to elaborate an elusive set of percep tual conditions not given directly under the postwar conditions of spectacle culture as theorized by Guy Debord and others. This double valence allows her to mine from Rainer's work a range of effects and concerns that open up old questions of representation. At the same time, its aestheti cizing ambiguity allows her to avoid more probing historical speculation, by reducing the disjunctions between bodily action and referentiality to a matter of aesthetic privi lege. Avant-garde dance would thus recon figure the terms of advanced artistic practice and perhaps broaden its points of contesta tion while leaving its social function and historical role more or less in place as an aesthetic aporia. In some cases, these impasses seem to be the stakes of the work itself, even if their implications point elsewhere. This is appreciable in the first chapter, "Judson Dance Theater in Hindsight," which eschews monographic treatment of Rainer s early work to acknowledge, instead, the genera tive environment around the Judson Dance Theater in the early 1960s, and to give credit to Rainer's early collaborators and immedi ate sources of inspiration. Through this tack, Lambert-Beatty mostly avoids discussions of the individual dancers and reveals instead shared sets of concerns that were worked through collectively, and from which Rainer's practice would steadily emerge. Being Watched Yvonne Rainer and the 1960s Carrie Lambert-Beatty Somewhat inevitably, the experimental com poser (and Merce Cunningham collaborator) John Cage appears as a guiding influence for dancers who adapted his anti-expressive compositional methods, chance, and found materials to de-instrumentalize bodily movement and uncouple physical technique from intention, expression, and definitive visual outcomes. The dancer Elaine Summers realized her Newspaper Dance through the lay out of newspaper page, an impersonal frame that established onstage coordinates for each performer; transitions in movement were signaled by line and paragraph breaks and other variations. Similarly, Steve Paxton choreographed a piece using poses drawn from sports photographs, cartoons, and other pop-cultural sources. While much literature on postwar art tends to emphasize the elements of deskilling and dismantling of convention at work in such methods, it might be asked, what are the implications of deskilling the performing, theatricalized body itself? Lambert-Beatty points toward one answer by grouping the effects of early Judson work under headings such as Memories, Slow Motion, Repetitions, and Stills, filmic terms that suggest a portable set of abstract actions, conditions?states rather than motifs?that achieve their radicality through their misalignment of source mate rial and the referential vehicle of the dancer's body.3 The "seeing difficulties" that result from these choreographies and the works that follow might be said to comprise a set of asymmetrical perceptual encounters for the audience that produces a series of socio-mechanical effects. These would be irreducible either to the individual body or organizational dictates of a given dance piece, nor locatable within the mass-cultural ephemera from which the work is derived. During the years 1963-65, Rainer s work and that of her colleagues is largely under ground, aimed at the development of a neu tralized language for dance (an antagonism motivated first by the mythic and expressive underpinnings of American modern dance.) By 1965, this practice is understood as a mode of contestation against larger institu tional forms and doxa, and then, eventually, against larger historical and political forces. Much of the strength of Lambert-Beatty s book, then, lies in its methodical organiza tion of Rainer's work and the foils the author chooses in order to accentuate these encounters and identify their points of ten sion. Her second and third chapters focus their discussions on one work each, Parts of Some Sextets and Trio A, posed in relation to postwar forms of social engineering and the Vietnam mediascape, respectively. Chapter 4 considers a suite of short films made by Rainer in relation to the legacy of Minimalism, while the fifth chapter explores Rainer's antiwar demonstrations and non dance performances. As conceptual organiza tion gives way to chronology in the fourth and fifth chapters, Rainer's films are ade quately analyzed, but their role in the devel opment of her thought and ambition is given rather than explained. The book also suffers from its selective and rather formal ized organization and curtailed field of ques tioning. Sometimes Lambert-Beatty locates Rainer's practice within the larger period rubric of the "avant-garde." Such a move is potentially welcome and problematic in that it drops the prefix "neo" that, until quite recently, has lingered over much chal lenging art made during this time in New York (thereby marginalizing those practices excluded by this designation and institution alizing others in advance), but it nonetheless fails to formulate new terms of contestation 132 FALL 20I0</page><page sequence="3">by which this second avant-garde might be distinguished. The social implications opened up by many of the works and analy ses are closed over by what are now the routine but airtight conventions specific to various disciplinary and academic genres in the humanities. Time is spent rehearsing various claims in order to extricate Rainer's work from problematics inherited from the field of performance studies and positivist history in general. The early chapters in par ticular worry over the inaccessibility of past performances and the difficulty of treating such a historical object, and then compen sate by way of archival documentation and a reliance on the Derridean trace that is mostly assumed, rather than developed historically within the period it is used to analyze. This approach is most evident in the second chapter, which is inescapably ori ented by a "performance photograph" of the rigorously organized Parts of Some Sextets, a work that resolved for Rainer certain Cagean and Minimalist tensions of method and syn tax. By this time Rainer, at least, had moved away from determining movement through mass-cultural imagery and forms and turned to task- and prop-based activities along with anthropomorphic interpretations such as "human fly." Dance in this instance is not set against its own conventions, but mobilized against the social conditions of the moment. The classic photograph by Peter Moore shows ten dancers arrayed across the stage in five groups, each performing a specific activity?peeling mattresses, dancing a duet, flying as a group of "airplanes"?that bears little relation to those around it, other than that of adjacency. Rainer scored the work on graph paper with the vertical axis taken up by thirty-one choices of "movement mate rial" and arrayed over eighty-four horizontal units of consecutive thirty-second intervals. The result was a rigorous but inconclusive structure of several "continuous simultane ous actions." Nonsynthetic but temporally regimented, the activities were anodyne singly but disquieting cumulatively, even for advocates who endured the work. To account for this effect, Lambert-Beatty turns to Mary Ann Doane's The Emergence of Cinematic Time: Modernity, Contingency, the Archive and Doane's opposition of two time systems: one rational and universal, the other systemically resis tant, a matter of contingency and particular ity. Over the course of early modernization, Doane posits, chance and contingency were taken up as philosophical and ideological exits from the standardized and the manda tory, such that by the early twentieth cen tury, photography and film come to stand as the sanctioned venues of release from the mundane constraints of everyday life.4 Without qualification, Lambert-Beatty extends this argument to claim that Rainer's dance provided a similar service to viewing audiences in the 1960s. Yet there are prob lems with this approach. Doane (and then Lambert-Beatty) tends to privilege the mark ing of the index and the traces of the archive as the paradigmatic models by which to comprehend and elaborate the relationship of contingency to life under modernity. By implication, this argument renders time in the early 1900s into so many spatialized object fossils in preparation for the more widespread acquiescence of the present to even more fragmented and atemporal condi tions of objective representation. By exten sion, Parts of Some Sextets is understood as one last space of refuge for this type of meta physical release, although the rather differ ent formation of viewing conditions and subjects is left unexplored. Lambert-Beatty does acknowledge this complication by sug gesting that the unyielding field effect of Parts of Some Sextets is meant to evoke the regu larized temporal conditions of late Fordism in an attempt to suspend their forward impetus and to create a performance work of noninvolvement. One implication of Rainer s work that emerges from this reading is its impulse to establish a visual condition of noninvolvement, but also a nonjudgmental space of watching, to the extent that viewers may be disinclined to identify actions seen strictly on the basis of their own identifications and histories?to look without anxiety, expectation, or even comprehension of a possessible experience. As such, photography from the 1960s should stand as a relative function of these concerns, not their residual tomb or mere evidence. This still leaves questions open about the conditions of release and restraint targeted by Parts of Some Sextets, in its juxtaposition of rational structure and purposeless move ment. At which levels of societal organiza tion should their existence be determined? And to what ends? Pointing toward these problems amounts to more than a criticism of methodology and philosophical models. That these issues belong to a set of larger historical questions specific to the 1960s and 1970s is made evi dent by a letter to Rainer from the writer Ted Castle, in which he describes a late 1965 piece by Paxton. Sections of the work were performed with a tape recording of Army-McCarthy hearings emanating from a speaker attached to his head, and then, "when Paxton left the room to let the tape play, the audience had no longer anything to do, no reason to behave as audiences do, nothing to command its attention. Young ladies became mildly hysterical, people looked around and bit their nails. I was quite interested in the tapes though, and I was annoyed that I couldn't hear the words very often" (quoted in Feelings Are Facts, 271). The situation Castle describes is one that reso nates with the reception of much art of the period, but it also isolates a link between aesthetic concerns and societal address. The hysteria recounted by Castle is a recur rent condition of the 1960s: it erupted at rock concerts, political rallies, and demon strations, as well as media-driven events. Although it occurred at different levels of passion, passivity, and aggression, in response to markedly different situations and politicized venues, there remains a shared set of determinations that may under write the intensity of many such confronta tions. In his most formulaic writings of the time, Marshall McLuhan claimed that media and technology were altering and replacing the relations of children to parents, neighbor 133 artjournal</page><page sequence="4">to neighbor, and individual to state, genera tion to generation.5 While the accuracy of McLuhan's diagnostics and conclusions have been challenged and even ridiculed, what seems more important for us now is the symptomatology of which he was a part as much as a critic. Among other things, this period witnessed a widespread public cathexis of identificatory and politicized affect onto diffuse figures and technological apparatuses to vastly differentiated degrees of engagement. The larger implication here is that a certain set of thresholds had been reached for public engagement in terms of continuous and passive watching. This can readily be characterized as an accelerated set of disconnections, but the question would remain open: disconnections from what and onto what?6 Then dislocated, this breach in the cultural order is now pervasive and mostly reabsorbed, but as part of what trans formed economic and political constellation? Aspects of this problematic are raised by Lambert-Beatty in relation to Parts of Some Sextets, Rainer s Trio A, and media coverage of the war in Vietnam. As has much recent art history, her critique relies on Samuel Weber's deconstructive account of television, an intervention that surpassed previous socio logical, semiotic, and Marxist readings of television?as well as analyses of cultural content?by demonstrating at a visual level the potential imbrication of the viewer's bodily presence with the technology of tele vision: a relation that severs viewers from both their location and the events that they witness, detaching their frame of judgment while simultaneously attenuating and fram ing their perceptual capabilities.7 Trio A's seemingly phraseless continuum would resist resolution into any single photo graphic "image" or mental snapshot that would make it complicit with the commer cialization of experience, even as its appar ently dehumanized, mechanical, and almost unconscious movements would convey the potential and literal impotence and apathy afforded to and accepted by television view ers in exchange for other activities and engagements. Television has been a relative fixture in many different spaces: a repository of anticipation, aggression, desire, and deferment, one that conditioned its viewers to accept these states as natural and, increas ingly, to differentiate their application to other aspects of everyday life. At the same time, it diminishes the capacity for response (as it came to serve during the 1970s and 1980s as a black hole in the national psyche and eventually to demand the wrong responses when they are needed elsewhere). The complexity of phrasing and degree of control required to make Trio A appear con tinuous and detached may have been a response to this more enveloping somatic condition. Unfortunately, Lambert-Beatty s reliance on Weber means that his insights are mostly applied and fixed as historical examples, rather than interrogated and extended. This is especially the case with his remarks about seeing and vision, which are never directly developed and are left almost global in their application.8 What do terms like "sight," "seeing," "watching," and "being watched" really mean when one discusses the 1960s (let alone now)? What other faculties, political aptitudes, and the diminishment thereof are implied in a world? This lapse points, perhaps, to the pervasive shortcoming in Lambert-Beatty's book. It wants to have Rainer's work (and performance more generally) not be strictly about the body. Yet at the same time, it uses the physicality of Rainer's practice to coordi nate but also to elide the quite significant differences between the nature and function of television, photography, and film beneath the broader rubrics of media and technol ogy, and sets Rainer's practice, as an image form in its own right, in opposition to one or all of these at once. For much recent art history, this is a borrowed claim, that of characterizing images as uniform extensions and ciphers or points of resistance to ram pant economic expansion.9 If a dance or another historical work of art is somehow complicit with or resistant to the character istics of photography, or suggestive of film, it may be the case that an elaboration of the artwork's greater shared referential operations and aesthetic features is one of the more pressing concerns for much work done on postwar and contemporary art. Rainer's body too is considered largely in terms of labor alone: of time spent, move ments acquired, and so forth. Little consid eration is given, though, to the different terms of looking and appearing that were being set in place. By whom, by what, and in anticipation of which inexistent viewers were various images constructed? Media at this moment participated not simply in expanding the effects in the world to look at, but in recalibrating the relative value of the human body?simultaneously reducing and multiplying the uses to which it could be put, reinforcing but also dismantling the management of individuals.10 Images, from this moment on, are increasingly the end point of a larger ecology of advertising, eco nomic, political, and social interests. These are less a matter of breaks and upheavals than of recalibrations of awareness and distraction, and like much art made during this period, they tend to bypass or exceed more easily readable cultural investments and responses. What were the psychic and social investments in place around the body at the same time that the body was being differently emplaced? Catherine Wood's short book, published in Afterall's One Work series, is in some ways most attuned to this aspect of Rainer's art. As Wood observes, dance is "the simplest and most economical meeting point between behavior and aes thetics" (Wood, i). In treating this work alone, which had an earlier, partial gestation in 1966 but was realized in more complex form in the spring of 1968, Wood is perhaps the most direct of the three authors in her attempt to find political application (rather than just motivation) in Rainer's practice. Unlike Lambert-Beatty, Wood downplays the audience reception and documentary resi due of the performance to focus more on its hybrid levels of construction through a reliance on what Rainer called "mobile blocks" of material. As Wood notes, these took the form not only of a repertoire of established everyday and overlooked move ments (e.g., stepping on and off a stool), but also of the props and foils used in Rainer's performances, objects that could be used to modify and augment action. In other cases, objects were meant to disrupt the visual field of onstage action just as dancers idling onstage, rather than backstage, lent porosity to performances while altering the audi ence's connection to the work. As Rainer put it in 1969, "What was beginning to interest me was the possibility of producing sponta neous behavior within a formal setting" (Feelings Are Facts, 318). The political formation of Rainer's youth resurfaces in her work and in her memoir most explicitly in 1968, a watershed year of intensified civic unrest, domestic violence, and media saturation, and it persists at least 134 FALL 2010</page><page sequence="5">through 1970, following the intractable and embittered salvage attempt of the Nixon administration to extend the war in Vietnam across the Cambodian border by claiming national and ideological victory over inherited material loss. Enmeshed in such a pressurized cultural climate and having exhausted the possibilities of differ entiating dance from the conditions of entertainment and media imagery, Rainer moved away from choreographed and scored pieces toward more open-ended per formances of manifold structure and ongo ing temporal realization such as The Mind is a Muscle. Wood pushes the potential of move ment material out of the realm of media and into that of the social to suggest that often, in Rainer's later work, the near-recognizability of certain actions was meant to evoke social identities not bound to a particular function. The significance of improvisational decision making would then be to represent demo cratic participation within parameters strictly set by the choreographer. Wood argues that the invocation of relations in The Mind is a Muscle opened up the "interval between iden tities" that the philosopher Jacques Ranciere has said might "reconfigure the distributions of the public and the private, the universal and the particular" (Wood, 96)." Wood is surely right in reading the work as an inter val. But it is difficult to know exactly what to make of her use of Ranciere's work? especially these signature oppositions that have been applied to so much art over the past several years. Private and public have become increasingly relative terms: legis lated and debased on one side, ineffectual and irrelevant on the other. To appeal to them as such stark and uninflected absolutes in the present feels at best too relative and dismissively Utopian, and, at worst, too liberal?in all the ways that that term has cumulatively come home to rest.12 To the extent that Wood is excellent and meticulous in her attention to the lived materiality of The Mind is a Muscle, it may be that she also asks that it be able to do too much?which it does?without making many of the broader connections that Lambert-Beatty's book attempts. What in fact, seems to have happened with Rainer's work at this time is that The Mind is a Muscle?as is also evident in Rainer's discussion of Trio A with Flags and Continuous Project-Altered Daily (Feelings Are Facts, 313-51)? put into play asymmetrical conditions of risk and vulnerability for the performers and audiences, particularly when audience members were given choices not simply of orientation, but also of rooms and activities with which to engage. At the least, it is not sufficient to suggest that performance from feelings are facts this period came to serve as a hybrid set of artifacts in which the experience of watching and being there can never be fully known. Perhaps the reverse phenomenon should be stressed instead: the fact that we appear to be exiting a period, at least in this country, when performances and spon taneous political actions capable of having any effect could still be only partially docu mented and remain largely unknown (let alone conceived of and executed in the name of anything but the most circum scribed and tired interests) and that their threat could still arise from such levels of physicality and uncertain identity. This possibility opens onto a related problem, one that is something more of an art-historical and aesthetic corollary and that is left mostly assumed and untouched by all three authors: that of theorizing the deter minants in Rainer s move from performance to film. More broadly, the unclear conditions of her transition between artforms suggest that we ask how to understand the relation ship and relays between the two, both in that period and, increasingly, in our own. In the wake of the intellectual, artistic, literary, and cultural developments of the 1960s, the contours of the field left to advanced artists wanting or needing to work in film has been little developed. Both mediums?or conjunctions of practices, audiences, and means?are emerging in recent years as compelling modes for contemporary work, critical, popular, and retrospective. So too have the more hybrid conditions of pro gramming and curating that determined The Mind is a Muscle and the formatting of Continuous Project-Altered Daily. As well, perfor mance and film have shown themselves to be reproducible and transmittable?often to complementary but opposite effects?in ways not imagined in the 1960s and early 1970s. While a strategic intent is at work in certain remakes of films and performances first made in the latter half of the twentieth century, most acquire a new valence in their sitedness that goes beyond a narrowly ranged condition of historical pastiche, as manifested either in the triumphalism that accompanies their resurrection or in the innocence of their audiences. Something is acquired in certain remakes in the work that is done in and on the materials themselves. Could it be also that The Mind is a Muscle and Continuous Project-Altered Daily, through their incongruous presentations and often a-signifying materials, as well as Parts of Some Sextets, in its juxtaposition of the score's rational structure and purposeless move ment, were able to open a new mnemonic field? This image space would nod toward the potential of photographs and films, in that they comprise new means not merely of delimiting and organizing time, but of showing its myriad physical operations? its speeds, elevations, and intentions. In this event, images would not simply bring the past forward, but push time ahead. Memory as a viewing condition of Rainer's later multiform and film-based performances would already also be composed of multiple temporalities and temporal possibilities occurring outside the viewer, such that the political potential would reside in the way that those works neutralize and suspend the vulgar exchangeability of the bodies, spaces, actions, and even voices that otherwise comprise the performances. This suspension of looking, of anticipation, and of identity? particularly in the films?may be said to have had the potential, in turn, to activate viewers in terms that were neither strictly individual, nor collective, but nonetheless shared. 135 artjournal</page><page sequence="6">William McManus is preparing to defend a disser tation at Princeton University on the paintings and films of Andy Warhol from 1962 to 1968.

The significance of this approach was first identified by Michael Kirby in his early attempt to characterize the "postmodern" conditions and effects of Judson dance: "The choreographer does not apply visual standards to the work.
