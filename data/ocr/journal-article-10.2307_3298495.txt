<plain_text><page sequence="1">ZEUS AND AGAMEMNON AT AULIS Agamemnon's decision at Aulis is as enigmatic as it is essential to Aeschylus' conception of Zeus. The Aeschylean Zeus is a perplexing, apparently flawed deity who ordains a war that men censure and willfully abandons his agent to unavoidable crime in executing it. My purpose is to approach through a discussion of the meaning of Aulis the meaning of Aeschylus' Zeus. Zeus for Aeschylus is panaitios panergetis, the causal force without whom nothing is accomplished for man.' He put man on the way to wis- dom in accordance with his law pathei mathos. Zeus has himself tra- versed this way as the Aeschylean Hymn to Zeus reveals. The Hymn's first antistrophe shows that it was the way taken by the Uranidae (Ag. 168-75): The one who was great before, swelling with invincible boldness, will not be reckoned as once existing. He who came next, having met his match, is gone. Whoever cries wholeheartedly the victory of Zeus will hit the mark of wisdom full on. F. Solmsen realized the importance of Hesiod's House of Uranus for understanding the House of Atreus, an insight D. Clay elaborated in ex- plaining the significance of the phrase triger6n mythos (Ch. 314) for human history.2 The paths of god and man, as Clay pointed out, are each 'Ag. 1485-88: IrPe'oltov 7roTepyfrcI" ,r yap fpo00ro a'Ev Alt' TEXEirce; 7i T cr6' oi OleKpotVT76J a'rt~L; These lines refer to the etymology of the name Zeus derived in lines 160-66. From the etymology of its oblique form Dios-as if from 6i 0, as in Hesiod Op. 3: 6v -e 6ld--Zeus is revealed as the name given to the force that accomplishes. As Dodds pointed out, lines 1485-88 indicate Aeschylus' belief that Zeus' purpose for men is present in the universe ("Morals and Politics in the 'Oresteia',' PCPS 6 [1960] 27). For the etymology see E. Norden, Agnostos Theos (Leipzig and Berlin 1923) 164 note 4 and 259 note 1; E. Fraenkel, Aeschylus: Agamemnon (Oxford 1950) III 704. For Zeus as the amoral force that is the ultimate causal agent in the universe, see L. Golden, "Zeus, whoever he is . . .," TAPA 92 (1961) 156-67, and In Praise of Prometheus (Chapel Hill 1962) 121-24. Unless otherwise specified the text is that of J. D. Denniston and D.

Zeus emerged victorious. Man must retrace that path. Aeschylus is clearly thinking in this way. The Chorus in the Choephori (866-68) associate Orestes with Zeus as males of the third generation through language drawn from wvrestling. The Hymn (171-74) identifies Zeus as triakter, the one who throws his opponent three times and gains the victory. Orestes enters a wrestling match (pale) which the Chorus pray will be for victory (with Ch. 868: eri viPK echoing i~rLviKtKa of Ag. 174).' Before Aulis the distinction between man qua animal and man qua man is not yet made.4 Man for Aeschylus is continuous with the beasts who, according to Hesiod (Op. 276-78), eat one another because there is no justice among them.5 Man, like the eagles who externalize his nature, preys on young (Ag. 1219-22). "In virtually every area of life shown in Aeschylus' trilogy," Segal says, "savagery has replaced civiliza- tion."' When the Chorus sing the parodos, however, we can have no notion that civilization ever existed. Atreus' sacrifice of the children and Thyestes' seduction of his brother's wife--cannibalism and adultery-- have erased the demarcations separating man from the beasts.' Anthro- pomorphic language and consciously ambiguous grammar blend the worlds of beast and man. Stolen eaglets are called "children" (Ag. 50) and their nest, a "bed" (Ag. 50). Their parents, metics of the sky, scream forth in lament of the dead the gods proper only to humans (Ag. 57).' A god sends an Erinys to avenge them (Ag. 55-59). Language also ob- scures the boundary separating omen from recipients, kings of birds from kings of ships (Ag. 114-15). Grammatically, both the eagles and the Atreidae can be warlike, devourers of the hare and escort leaders.9 A maiden girl is a heifer (Ag. 245), sacrificed to balance the loss of another creature. Unlike the beasts, however, man is favored by Zeus with wis- dom (Ag. 182-83). It is to the end of fully individuating man that Zeus dispatches the Atreidae against Paris and Troy. 3For wrestling language, see Fraenkel (above, note 1) II 104. and H. J.

Scholars charge betrayal, cruelty, primitivism.10 Not so. Zeus is not savage, neither is he merciful. Through Agamemnon man must be exposed to the conflict and make the same kind of choice that began the way for the Uranidae. As sceptered king, Agamemnon enjoys the favor of Zeus before and after his death. His murder follows from the sacrifice of Iphigenia and is perpetrated by forces outside Zeus' control." But to raise the question of Zeus' abandonment of his agent raises a false issue. Events at Aulis transcend the individual. Zeus' purpose in sending Agamemnon is that one day there may be an Orestes. Agamemnon is but one step on the way to that goal. The conflict is one between the male and the female arising from male willingness to subordinate life to policy. This is the primal crime of the male, prototypically embodied in Uranus' repression of his children out of fear perhaps of overthrow and in the sending of the eagles by Zeus.'2 The male's crime is followed inevitably by the wrath of the female pro- tecting or avenging her young. Conflict between Uranus and Gaia is re- solved in Cronus' decision to castrate his father. His is a morally ambiva- lent decision, a good and an evil at once. In taking the mother's part against the father's atasthalia (Th. 164), "presumptuous sin" or "reck- lessness," and so in permitting birth, he is right. That Uranus conceived shameful deeds first is twice mentioned as justification (Th. 166; 172). But Gaia's scheme is a "cunning and evil trick" (Th. 160) and the Titans' deed itself one of atasthalia (Th. 209). For their monstrous plot they will someday have to pay recompense (Th. 210), an eventuality ex- pressed mythically by the birth of the Erinyes, born to avenge the father's curse.3" To his father's Erinyes Cronus later pays redress (Th. 472-73). Since the claims of the father and the mother are both valid and irre- ducible, a violent solution to their conflict has to result in guilt and the need for atonement. Moreover, all that the male is and accomplishes derives or is taken from Gaia."4 The diminution of her power thus creates in Hesiod's uni- 10Notably: H.

It is stated that Cronus feared overthrow by one of his children (Th. 463-65). On Agamemnon's choice and the ensuing conflict, see also J. H. Finley, Pindar and Aeschylus (Cambridge 1955) 253: "His choice is in fact between the calm and quiet sequence of the family and the glory of conquest. It accordingly harbors a conflict between female and male, family and army, and the relationship between just kingship and the peace which it should foster is broken in a father's act of killing his daughter." 13Birth of Erinyes: Solmsen (above, note 2) 159; 180. 14Totality is represented by Chaos and Gaia, the sources of all that is possible in the universe.

It is worked out across three generations of cosmic rulers through the interaction of female pro- creativity and the male's willingness to subordinate her life to his policy. The atasthalia and deceit of Uranus and Gaia have greater than personal significance. They are the first manifestation of a conflict that is innate to the universe. Tension is relieved, and conflict resolved on the divine plane by Zeus.15 The same must be done on the human. The way for man begins therefore with a choice similar to Cronus'. Hence the enigma of Aulis: to carry out the just purpose of Zeus, Agamemnon must com- mit an act he knows to be abominable. Zeus sends the eagles to be an omen of the expedition's success. A hare and its young are sacrificed so that his will be made known. For Zeus the pregnant hare counts less than his purpose. It is an act of the very sort that led to conflict between Uranus and Gaia. Artemis, kindly and lovely potnia thir5n, is indignant over the break in the stream of life caused by their premature death. She is a separate godhead, independent of Zeus. To her equally important are the young of all beasts. She be- grudges the eagles their feasting, and as Calchas fears (Ag. 150-54), de- mands another sacrifice." Common to the Hesiodic and Aeschylean prototypes are the motifs of king's business over parenthood, the un- naturalness of this preference since it is against the generative process, and the anger of the female who protects her young. This conflict is an inescapable part of the universe as the divine actors of the drama of the omen prove. That man might come to know this condition of his existence did Zeus put him on the way to wisdom. The primal conflict has been latent in the House of Atreus since his slaughter of the children (Ag. 154-55): Osloenses, Suppl. VII (1936) as reprinted in Wege der Forschung 44, ed. E. Heitsch (Darmstadt 1966) 665. By contrast, the children of Chaos, especially those of Night (Th. 211-32), affect men, not the gods. 15Zeus brings to an end the conflict with female procreativity by giving birth to Athena after swallowing the pregnant Metis (Th. 886-900), thus ending the suc- cession, by granting his children sexual freedom and by adopting marriage and the siring of children as a means of expressing aspects of his own rule. See Solmsen (above, note 2) 34-45; 55; N. O. Brown, Hesiod. Theogony (Indianapolis and New York 1953) 23. For a discussion of the Metis-episode as an integral part of the succession myth, see H. Schwabl, RE s.v. "Weltsch6pfung," Suppl. ix. 1453- 54. 16Artemis is characterized as potnia thirbn, a pre-Hellenic goddess; except for patros (Ag. 135) there is no trace of her as an Olympian. Aga (Ag. 131) is "the feeling (indignation, horror, astonishment) aroused by such a violation of a tabu" (Rose [above, note 3] 2.14). The transgression is the killing of creatures before their time-the implication of blapsante loisthibn drom6n (Ag. 120). Aga ex- plains why Artemis demands a second sacrifice, and the lack of distinction at this stage between man qua man and man qua animal explains why she would demand human sacrifice. It does not account for her anger against Agamemnon. See next note.</page><page sequence="5">332 WMV. BLAKE TYRELL There remains a fearful, recurring, house-dwelling, deceitful, unforgetting Wrath that avenges children. Artemis, affronted at Zeus' eagles and the male's careless disregard for life, demands a balancing for the hare and its young from Atreus' sons. The ties of association behind her demand are hidden in the past. Only Calchas perceives the harmony between the loss of Thyestes' children, the sacrifice of the hare, and another sacrifice, neikedn tektona sym- phyton, ou deisinora (Ag. 151). To Artemis there is no distinction be- tween eagles and Atreidae; both are animals who prey on young." Since her wrath is inevitable, she becomes part, though one beyond Zeus' con- trol, of his plan that Agamemnon face a decision parallel to Cronus'. Agamemnon must knowingly commit the male crime of subordinating life to policy. Knowledge marks the difference between Artemis and Zeus. Both impose suffering. With Zeus it may lead to knowledge of how to avoid future suffering. Agamemnon understands the impossibility of the choice. He himself frames it as a choice between a king's duty to act (to mi pithesthai) and the blood ties of a father to his child. The father makes no attempt to mitigate the horror or to palliate the unnaturalness of the act he contem- plates (Ag. 206-11):1" Not to be persuaded is a heavy doom, but heavy too, if I slaughter my child, the delight of my house, polluting with streams of maiden's gore the father's hands beside the altar. Which of these is without evils? There follow the deliberations of the king for whom desertion is as im- possible as failing through inactivity an alliance already ravaged (Ag. 192-98) by hunger and bad weather (Ag. 212-17): 17The hidden link between the eagles' feast and the sacrifice of Iphigeneia is Atreus' slaughter of the children (Ag. 1096-97; 1186-93; 1217-22). Artemis is angry at the eagles, and presumably at Zeus who sent them, as well as at the Atreidae, for each has committed the primal crime of the male. Her anger may be motivated in part by the destruction that Agamemnon will inflict on the inno- cent at Troy. Such an assumption, however, connotes the alteration of Zeus' law drasanti pathein to drasonti pathein, rightly deemed unacceptable by Fraenkel (above, note 1) II 97. Greek gods punish misdeeds, not intentions. It is better to attribute her anger to acts already committed against life and to the male's general disregard for life. On Artemis' anger, see W. Whallon, "Why is Artemis Angry?" AJP 82 (1961) 78-88; Peradotto (above, note 5) 249-61, especially 256-57; Lebeck (above, note 5) 35-36.

To desire the sacrifice that stops the wind and the maiden's blood passionately with passion is right. May all be well.'9 To sacrifice the maiden is themis, "right and proper," because Aga- memnon passionately wants to do it. He stresses the rightness of one course, not seeing it the way Orestes will, as a clash of rights (Ch. 461). All hesitancy is dismissed with the prayer, eu gar eii. He is compelled to choose, but the compulsion comes from within, from his role as king, and is directed toward sacrifice by his character as Atreides.20 The Zeus of Aeschylus, though panaitios panergetis, is not divine providence. He does not guide all things.21 It is Agamemnon's choice; he could have refused to put on the strap.22 Aulis is a moment in the genesis of man. In choosing to put on the yokestrap, Agamemnon breaks with his bestial nature, for animals act by instinct, not choice. He becomes a volitive human being who must ac- cept responsibility for his actions. At Aulis the outer reality of the con- flict between Zeus and Artemis and the inner reality of the mnaman Minis teknopoinos first meet. Calchas alone perceives their oneness. Agamemnon begins the way to that knowledge for all men. The meaning and mystery of Aulis lies not in a god who, as Page concludes,23 creates a fault in man. It lies in a universe that has only one way of becoming, 19The text is Fraenkel's.

The emendation sphe loses the subtlety of Agamemnon's reluctance to state his own desire for the sacrifice, while creating a problem not otherwise in the text, viz., that of the allies' determination, Agamemnone invito, to carry out the sacrifice and war. It is better to leave the subject of epithymein vague (Fraeknel, II 126) and to keep in mind that it is Agamemnon's expedition, not the allies', to carry out or abandon before the sacrifice. 200n Agamemnon's decision, see in particular Dodds (above, note 1) 27-28; A. Lesky, "Decision and Responsibility in the Tragedy of Aeschylus," JHS 86 (1966) 78-85; Peradotto (above, note 5) 250-56. It was to highlight the moment of choice that Aeschylus omitted any apparent grounds for Artemis' anger, thus seeming to sever her anger from the stream of causality (Fraenkel [above, note 1] II 99). 21Presumably Zeus, as Fontenrose (above, note 8) 83-86 pointed out, did not want Agamemnon killed. More certain indications that Zeus' will is not the only purpose in the cosmos are the prayer of the Chorus in the Choephori (306-8) and the final hymn of the Eumenides (1045-46). 22B.
