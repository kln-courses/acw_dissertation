<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Foundations Must Stand. By P. E. KRETZMANN. St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1936. 123 pages. What is taken to be the "foundations" is the views concerning the infallibility of the Bible supported by a host of ancient and modern theologians like R. A. Torrey and Dr. Machen, who defend the view that the Bible does not only contain but is the word of God and that inspiration implies "plenary," verbal," and "inerrant" conveyance of divine truth. The main evidence given for this view is that God "said" or "spoke," illustrated by thirty pages of an Appendix in which such phrases occur in the Bible. True, but is it still necessary to tell that such language is anthropomorphic?</page></plain_text>
