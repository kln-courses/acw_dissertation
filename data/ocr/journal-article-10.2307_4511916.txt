She moves away from an early con- ception of nature "red in tooth and claw" toward an intense interest in animal behavior and a gradual understanding of ecology. Throughout the book she clings to the fight or flee dichotomy as an overused explanation for most everything. " . I began to take notes, naively written as if I were speaking to the birds directly.... This seemed to lead us, the birds and me, into a more intimate re- lationship. It also led me into an entirely anthropomorphic appreciation of the birds and their behavior. But for a long time I remained blissfully ignorant of even the existence of that long word and certainly of its meaning and the impedi- ments it posed to the art of objective observation." She never really escapes her anthropomorphic tendencies, although she later minimizes them and, despite all, her observations are extraordinarily detailed, extraordinarily sensitive. Her use of the present tense to relate observations combines well with her descriptive abilities and attention to detail to give the reader a sense of making the observation himself. The change to past tense for interpretation or reflection lends a meditative, even wistful mood to the text. In addition to the fine text the book is amply and beautifully illustrated by Glen Loates. The pen and ink sketch- es, mostly of animals, convey a sense of warmth and vitality that alone is worth the price of the book. The book closes with a discussion of animal population trends about her home in the Pimisi Bay region of Ontario over the past 25 years. It is a discussion made all the more meaningful by the vivid pictures that have gone before. "Silent spring! Has Rachel Carson's prevision really come true? Let scientific research take care of the complexity of its causes. Here I am dealing only with a trend that in this one region emerges with convincing insistence from the events I have observed and recorded over the past two and a half decades. If by silent spring we mean the stillness that has descended upon the forest where formerly the voices of the woodland birds used to fill the dawn and the morning hours with their continuous and varied chorus, then, indeed, Rachel Carson's silent spring is upon us today, a portentous reality."-Edward H. Burtt, Jr. 69. The morphology of the syrinx in passerine birds. P. L. Ames. 1971. Peabody Mus. Nat. Hist. Bull., 37: 1-194.-The long awaited publication of Ames' Ph.D. dissertation on the passerine syrinx will be greeted with mixed feelings by avian morphologists and systematists. On the one hand, the paper is undoubtedly the most comprehensive survey of the structure of the avian syrinx to be published, and his conclusions will be cited by many future workers. How- ever, many will probably find his discussions rough going because of poor organ- ization. Furthermore, because of the complexity of his presentation, many of his systematic and evolutionary conclusions will have to be viewed with measured skepticism until such time as they can be analysed in more detail. Before proceeding to my main comments, it should be pointed out that certain editorial policies apparently account for some of the problems encountered in the organization of Ames' paper. I refer especially to the placing of all the illustrations in plates at the end of the text. In numerous instances this will in- convenience the reader and prohibit efficient reading of the paper. Placing plates together might be necessary and justifiable with photographs but is questionable with line drawings such as used here. Ames begins with a brief history of syringeal morphology, methods of study, and nomenclature. The bulk of the paper follows these sections and includes a detailed description of the syrinx in the suboscines, with only eight pages being devoted to all the oscines. There are short sections on development, variations, and then a rather detailed summary of the morphology characteristic of each suboscine group. Finally, there is a brief review of passerine classification, an out-of-place section on adjectives of syringeal morphology ("-myodean," "tra- cheal," and "bronchial"), and sections on the evolution and taxonomic value of the syrinx. My first major criticism is that there is no general introduction to the paper. Why did the author undertake this study? Was his main goal descriptive, evolu- tionary, taxonomic, or all three? One has to wait until the section on variation (p. 100) before reading "Although the main purpose of this study is to establish relationships among genera and higher categories. . . ." If one assumes he was</page><page sequence="2">Bird-Badg 3061 Recent Literature October, 1972 attempting to examine all three aspects, it would have been better if he had dis- cussed early in the paper some of the theoretical aspects underlying the inter- pretations of his data. Prior to undertaking the description of the syrinx in the various passerine taxa, Ames has a short discussion (p. 14-16) of the nomenclature to be used. The reader will immediately run into difficulties. His most glaring omission at this point is a discussion of the "intrinsic" musculature although he repeatedly men- tions these muscles later in the text. Some intrinsic muscles are pictured in plate 1 to which the reader is referred, and they should have been discussed on p. 16 with the extrinsic muscles. On p. 20 Ames has additional nomenclatural comments for the Furnarioidea, on p. 33 for the Tyrannoidea, and on p. 87-91 for the oscines. Although it is a personal preference, I think that consolidation of all the basic descriptions, definitions, and nomenclature along with adequate illustrations, in one place would have facilitated understanding of the paper. The bulk of the data is presented in a section some 77 pages in length. Ames records an incredible amount of detail on syringeal morphology but most of this will be unintelligible even to the expert morphologist. The synthesis of these data is to be found in two later sections. I was disappointed that the syringes of more species were not illustrated. Thus Ames pictures one dendrocolaptid (50 species in family), one furnariid (20 spp.), four formicariids (234 spp.), two cotingids (92 spp.), and 19 tyrannids (364 app.), to give some idea of the coverage. It is highly questionable whether this is sufficient to illustrate adequately the variation present in the suboscines. Most of us interested in studies such as this one depend a great deal on the illustrations to give us some notion of the reliability of the author's methods and results; in general, morphological description is deadly even to the morphologist. Thus even though Ames' illustrations are of excellent quality, one would have liked more of them. Perhaps the most useful section of the paper is the morphological summary (p. 108-126) in which there is a detailed outline of each aspect of syringeal morph- ology and the taxa characterizing each subdivision of the outline. Once we have a better understanding of the probable primitive-derived sequences of the various syringeal characters (see below), then this summary will be extremely valuable for interpreting certain relationships. The two final sections of Ames' monograph discuss the evolution of the syrinx and his systematic conclusions. In general, I think Ames has produced a well-reasoned and even-tempered approach to these subjects. Unlike some work- ers dealing with what is essentially a "single character" Ames does not attempt to provide quotable conclusions regarding the systematic position of all the groups he studied. Indeed, in several cases he states the syrinx is taxonomically worthless within certain groups. Ames presents a very interesting and stimulating account of the probable evolutionary trends for the various features of the passer- ine syrinx. Even if future workers take issue with him, Ames at least has provided the basis for a meaningful discussion, and more systematists should include such a treatment for their characters (e.g., in bones, muscles, proteins, etc.). I think he provides a reasonably valid argument for recognition of the primitive "pico- passerine" syrinx, and most importantly, he does not attempt to relate those passerine groups having this primitive syrinx. This is a welcome change from many previous anatomical studies in which various workers have followed this line of incorrect reasoning, It will take much more detailed analysis than is possible here to offer comments on most of his systematic conclusions, but my general "feeling" is that we probably can have a reasonable degree of confidence in them. Once again, I think the use of some illustrations would have greatly strengthened his evolutionary arguments. Some figures showing the postulated evolutionary sequences of the different cartilages and muscles would have made the paper much more understandable. In conclusion, there is much to praise in this paper but one should not try to minimize the shortcomings. The poor organization and lack of illustrations will hamper its critical study for all but the most diligent systematists. On the other hand, the paper does contain some extremely valuable systematic data, and for his patience and thorough work Ames is to be congratulated. We can only hope that he will continue to produce additional studies on syringeal morphology.- Joel Cracraft.</page></plain_text>
