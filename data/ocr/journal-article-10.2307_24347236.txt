<plain_text><page sequence="1">KANT'S COPERNICAN ANALOGY: BEYOND THE NON-SPECIFIC READING* Dennis Schulung î. Introduction: Kant's Copernican Analogy In the preface to the second edition (hereafter: B-preface) of the Critique of Pure Reason (henceforth Critique for short, or KrV when quoted) Kant invokes the well known Copernican image that is often associated with the subjective turn that the so called critical philosophy inaugurated in metaphysics. The passage where Kant makes the analogy with Copernicus reads: This would be just like the first thoughts of Copernicus, who, when he did not make good progress in the explanation of the celestial motions [Himmelsbewegungen] if he assumed that the entire celestial host [das garnie Sternheer] revolves around the observer, tried to see if he might not have greater success if he made the observer revolve and left the stars at rest. Now in metaphysics we can try in a similar way regarding the intuition of objects.1 In the past, some interpreters2 contended that there is some ambiguity as to whether l. Kant actually speaks of an analogy with Copernicus here and 2. he indeed herewith refers to the Copernican revolution, more in particular the postulation of the helio centric universe, which some have deemed irrelevant for Kant's analogy.3 As regards 1, it should be observed that plainly Kant does not use the literal words 'Copernican analogy', neither here nor anywhere else in the Critique nor in his other works for that matter (notice that he does use the word 'analogy' with reference to the sciences a few lines prior to the quoted passage). However, that in the above passage Kant does effectively make an analogy is, to my mind, evident from his use of the phrases «[tjhis would be just like [...]»- Kant refers to his hypothesis concerning the possibility of a priori knowledge - and «in a similar way». Also, in a note close to the above-cited pas sage (KrV, B xxii, note) Kant explicitly speaks of an «analogical» relation between the * This article is based on a shorter Dutch version, which appeared in «Algemeen Nederlands Tijdschrift voor Wijsbegeerte» («antw»), too, 1, januari 2008, pp. 41-66.1 hereby gratefully acknowledge permission of the publishers of antw to publish in translation material contained therein.

Hanson even goes so far as to claim that Kant's réf érencé to a revolution «has nothing whatever to do with Copernicus» (op. cit., p. 276; original emphasis) but merely refers to the success of the sciences of which Kant speaks in the paragraphs preceding the Copernicus passage. As Hanson (op. cit., pp. 276, 278) noted correctly, neither in the preface nor anywhere else in the Kantian cor pus does Kant himself employ the phrase 'Copernican revolution'. He does speak however, in general terms, of a revolution in the sciences3 and a revolution in meta physics modelled after it (KrV, B xxn), which is clearly an allusion to his own philos ophy that he advances in the Critique. I believe that the référencé to Copernicus must be seen in that context.4 I also believe that in above-quoted passage Kant implicitly refers to the Copernican revolution by explicitly asserting that the acceptance of the hypothesis of earth rotation yielded an improvement in the calculation of planetary cycles (Kant speaks, less accurately, of «the celestial motions [Himmelsbewegungen]»).s It is precisely this acceptance that kick-started the Copernican revolution. Conse quently, given that in the above-quoted passage Kant, to my mind, indeed makes an analogy with Copernicus, a prima fade connection is thereby made between Coper nicus' revolution and Kant's own revolution in metaphysics. In light of these remarks, I fully concur with the observation recently made by Mur ray Miles in regard to the question apropos of the above-quoted passage as to whether it is justified to speak of an analogy, and if so whether the analogy must be seen as 1 In The Conflict of the Faculties Kant also refers to the «Copernican hypothesis», by way of analogy with «the Standpoint taken from the sun», which is the Standpoint of Reason, that contrasts with our own, empiri cal «choice of Standpoint» regarding «the course of human things», that is, as seen from the earth (AA vu 83; my translation). 2 See again N. R. Hanson, op. cit.; see M. Miles, op. cit., p. 1, esp. note 3, for references to the debate in the Anglophone literature. See further note 3 on p. 42 below. 3 Miles (op. cit., p. 1) notes that the term 'revolution' appears no less than six times in the second-edition preface alone. 4 Notice that elsewhere in the Critique (A 257 B 313) Kant speaks of the «Copernican world system», which is to be associated with a «contemplative astronomy», leaving aside here the context in which he makes this re mark. In a Reflexion that is part of a sériés of reflections on the indispensability in philosophy of hypothèses, Kant explicitly relates the phrasing «Das Copernicanische Weltsystem» to the hypothesis of earth rotation (R 2680, AA xvi 468; also R 2675, AA xvi 463). One should also acknowledge that Kant was well versed in cos mology and surely must have been well informed about the implications of the Copernican revolution for as tronomy given an early publication in which he argued for an early version of what is now known as the Kant Laplace nebular hypothesis about the origin of our solar system. See NTH (1755), in AA 1 215-368. For a brief account of Kant's version of the nebular hypothesis see M. Friedman, Philosophy of Natural Science, in The Cambridge Companion to Kant and Modern Philosophy, ed. P. Guyer, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2006, pp. 309 ff. Also PG, from § 7 (AA ix 166 ff), published by Theodor Rink in 1802 based on Kant's lecture notes (probably without Kant's express authorization), which are set to be published soon as volume xxvi in the Akademie Ausgabe, shows that Kant was well versed in the mathematics involved in astronomy. Of special interest here is § 9 (AA ix 170 ff.) 5 This gainsays, quite clearly, Miles' remark that «the heliocentric world picture is not even alluded to in the key passage of the Preface in which the reference to Copernicus occurs» (op. cit., p. 3).</page><page sequence="3">KANT'S COPERNIC AN ANALOGY: BEYOND THE NON-SPECIFIC READING 41 linked to the Copernican revolution: «[T]he philological point made with such fanfare by the commentators [among whom Hanson, D. S.] may be philosophically moot after ali».1 The communis opinio among Kant interpreters now is that, in the passage at Bxvi, (a) Kant de facto makes an analogy with Copernicus, which (b) by implication refers, in some way, to the Copernican revolution, and that (c) consequently it is justified to speak of Kant's own Copernican revolution (in some sense). Today, Kant commenta tors ffeely use the Copernican image in accounts of, or references to, Kant's thought without having much concern for the earlier controversies concerning the very ap propriateness of Kant's reference to Copernicus or the Copernican revolution.21 fol low this practice and shall henceforth simply assume the connection between the Copernican analogy and the Copernican revolution. I shall also speak of Kant's Coper nicanism, by which I mean his own Copernican revolution in metaphysics, though it should be noted that Kant never labels his philosophy in this way. Having clarified what Kant did or did not say, the question regarding the meaning or sense of Kant's Coper nicanism and how the analogy with Copernicus3 should be read, and also the question as to what extent there is a parallel between Kant and Copernicus are of course still in need of answering. This then is the subject of my exposition here. My central con tention is that no commentator up until now, including Miles, has been able to cash out Kant's reference to Copernicus so as to explain the key aspect of his proposed «al tération in our way of thinking» (KrV, B xix) in metaphysics. It has become virtually a commonplace in both Kant commentaries and more gen eral references to his thought4 that the essence of the analogy that Kant makes with Copernicus' breakthrough in astronomy lies in a change of perspective that Kant in troduces in the way we relate to the world of objects. Many, if not the majority of, Kant commentators5 assume that the meaning of the Copernican analogy must pri 1 M. Miles, op. cit., p. 1. See also p. 6. 2 Cf. M. Miles, op. cit., p. 7, note 18. 3 Hereafter, I shall equally refer to Kant's or the Copernican analogy, Kant's or the analogy with Coperni cus, and Kant's analogy for short. 4 Sometimes more general references to Kant's Copernicanism are made with the perspectival nature of our experience in mind. See, e.g., H. Price, Causal Perspectivalism., in H. Price, R. Corry (eds.), Causation, Physics, and the Constitution of Reality. Russell's Republic Revisited, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2007, pp. 250 292. Price refers to Kant's Copernican analogy in the light of his thesis of causal perspectivalism and, strikingly, even suggests that the analogy would consist in the fact that Kant points to an anthropocentric element in Copernicus' alleged cosmological perspectivism. Notice that Allison also speaks of Kant's «anthropocentric model of Cognition» (H. E. Allison, Kant's Transcendcntal Idealism. An Interpretation and Defense, rev. and en larged edn., New Häven, Princeton University Press, 2004, p. 37). s See, e.g., H. E. Allison, op. cit., p. 36, and P. Guyer, Kant, London-New York, Routledge, 2006, pp. 49-50. Cf. M. Miles, op. cit., p. 6, note 17; p. 7, note 18. Likewise, Miles himself intimâtes that Kant's reference to Coper nicus' «first thoughts» (Bxvi) has to do with a «reversai of the ontological realism of common sense» (op. cit., p. 13, 29; cf. p. 3, note 10 where, whilst referring to Hanson, Miles quotes a remark regarding common sense from the preface of Copernicus- On the Révolutions; cf. N. Copernicus, On the Révolutions, new edn., transi, and ed. by E. Rosen, Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992, p. 4; Idem, Das Neue Weltbild. Drei Texte. Com mentariolus, Brief gegen Werne, De revolutionibus, Latin-German edn., ed. H. G. Zekl, Hamburg, Meiner, 1990, p. 70). According to Miles, the aptness of Kant's analogy with Copernicus lies precisely in the fact that «as in the case of Copernicus, the key innovations involved in Kant's "veränderte Methode der Denkungsart" constitute a quite deliberate inversion of the familiar Standpoint of sound common sense» (p. 3). S. Gardner, Kant and the Critique of Pure Reason, London-New York, Routledge, 1999, p. 42 appears to suggest the same. I believe that Copernicus' mention of «common sense» in the preface to On the Révolutions is so incidental to pleading his case that it does not warrant resting one's interprétation of the Copernican turn on it.</page><page sequence="4">42 DENNIS SCHULUNG marily be sought in the simple fact that Kant has in mind a change in Standpoint or view, or stipulâtes a choice between either a realist or idealist - Kant's own alterna tive - view of the world. This suggests that one should attach no deeper meaning to the analogy with Copernicus. The analogy would merely allude to the fact of a change from an object oriented ontological metaphysics to a subject-centred de-on tologized epistemology, analogous to the way in which Copernicus' investigations brought about a change from a geocentric to a heliocentric worldview. Kant's Coper nicanism would on this view merely consist in the notion of his new philosophy be ing as revolutionary in effect as Copernicus' explorations were in astronomy. But then one must ask: apart from its revolutionary character, what is actually Copernican about Kant's Copernican revolution? Hanson suggests that «Kant's reference to Copernicus in B xvn [sic] may not stand in any primary relation to the main thrust of his argument».1 Hanson believes - and Allison,2 Guyer, and a host of others, appear to follow him in this respect - that «Kant openly asserts a similarity between himself and Copernicus in but one respect; each of them made trial of an alternative hypothesis when existent théories proved unsatis factory», whereby it is emphasized that «[t]he révolutions in thought with which Kant explicitly compares his own revolution have nothing specifically to do with Coperni cus».3 Let us cali this minimal, non-specific reading of Kant's Copernican analogy the 'alternative hypothesis' reading (ah), ah asserts that the analogy simply lies in the fact that both Kant and Copernicus propose a change in respective position or perspective. ah is related to a commonly held view of Kant's Copernicanism. This view sees Kant's Copernicanism in terms of perspectivism, whereby perspectivism is defined as the epistemological theory that ali knowledge or experience of any object x is neces sarily constrained by the context in which, or the viewpoint from which, that knowl edge is claimed or the experience occurs. Perspectivism implies context dependence and a certain extent of subjectivism, partiality and/or préjudice. Perspectivism (itali cized) is the abbreviation I use henceforth for the reading of Kant's Copernicanism in terms of perspectivism. Perspectivism itself is not strictly speaking an identifiable in terprétation of the Copernican analogy, with which any one commentator or school of interprétation could be associated. It rather refers to a certain widespread tenden cy in interpreting Kant's revolution in metaphysics, his Copernicanism so to speak. This tendency concerns an insistence on the subjective or epistemic aspect as the pri mary characteristic of Kant's Copernicanism (see below, section 2).4 As will become 1 Op. cit., p. 278. 2 Cf. H. E. Allison, op. cit., p. 456, note 36. 3 N. R. Hanson, op. cit., p. 278; italics mine. Hanson believes that Kant's mention of a revolution in the B-preface «has nothing whatever to do with Copernicus» (p. 276) but only points to the scientific révolutions in mathematics and more explicitly, in physics. That Kant does refer to Copernicus is, according to Hanson, on ly because Kant, just like Copernicus, tries another hypothesis. Hanson opines: «The name 'Copernicus' is brought in here only to illustrate the propriety of making trial of an untested hypothesis, particularly when extant théories seem ffuitless. Any of a number of other scientists could, and in fact do, illustrate this point for Kant. Further parallel between Copernicus and himself are not central to Kant's exposition at this point.» (p. 277). And further: «Kant was never concerned, even in the Preface to the second édition, to stress the doc trinal similarity between his own epistemological teachings and the astronomical theses of De Revolutionibus» (p. 278; emphasis added). 4 See, e.g., K. Ameriks, Kant and the Historical Turn. Philosophy as Criticai Interpretation, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 2006, p. 78.</page><page sequence="5">KANT'S COPERNIC AN ANALOGY! BEYOND THE NON-SPECIFIC READING 43 clear in due course, ah is a compromise solution, a concession in response to the fail ure of perspectivem as an adequate take on Kant's Copernicanism. However, whilst avoiding the patent faults of perspectivism, ah is not capable of explaining how the mere fact of a putative turn in perspective relates to what that turn substantially typ ifies and makes necessary, viz., the epistemic relevance of subjectivity. Consequently, ah is not a viable candidate for interpreting Kant's analogy. As I shall argue, the deeper meaning behind Kant's analogy has nothing to do with perspectivism as such. Nor is the analogy to do with the simple historical fact of a change in perspective, as ah believes. For if the analogy were indeed merely to be about perspectivism, or concern the generalization of a paradigm shift, then it would be clear, as has been pointed out many times by other commentators, that the anal ogy is not particularly apt. At first blush, Kant's change in perspective appears to be the inverse of Copernicus' cosmological revolution.1 Whereas in Kant's epistemo logica! revolution the subject becomes the centre of the cognitive framework, Coper nicus' astronomy would appear to highlight precisely the move away firom any an thropocentrically centred worldview. In the literature, this conspicuous discrepancy is sometimes referred to as Kant's 'anthropocentric fallacy'.2 It is considered charac teristic of Kant's so-called criticai philosophy to consider the human being the meas ure of ali things, whereas in a real Copernican paradigm it would exactly not be the human observer, casting her eyes onto the heavens above her, who provides the stan dard with which to determine the laws of the cosmos. Thus, if we were to read the analogy simply in terms of a change in perspective or perspectivism tout court, then we would better agree with Russell's snide remark3 that Kant's revolution resembles more a Ptolemaic reaction or contra-revolution than a Copernican revolution. To avoid unnecessary confusion it would in that case be recommendable no longer to link Kant's revolutionary thought to the Copernican revolution. However, if, for some important reason, we do not want to give up characterizing Kant's thought as Copernican - and the practice in Kant interprétation indicates we do not - then, I contend, perspectivism must be abandoned; and lest the term 'Coper nican' be meaningless, ah must equally be given up. This is what I shall argue. The core of my argument consists in pointing out that Kant's Copernican analogy should not be read in terms of a mere allusion to the trial of an alternative hypothesis (ah), but shows up a systematic connection between Kant's and Copernicus' explorations. For if the analogy is to be taken seriously at ali, that is, taken as indicating a likeness of sorts between Kant's and Copernicus' systems of thought, then the connection be tween them must be more substantial than the non-specific link that ah suggests and, given Russell's criticism, différent in nature fforn perspectivism. To shore up my ar 1 Cf. P. Guyer, op. cit., p. 50. 2 This critique is often attributed to Bertrand Russell (see note below). However, the British Kant com mentator Norman Kemp Smith observed already in 1913 that, at first blush, Kant's revolution resembles more a «Ptolemaic-anthropocentric metaphysics» (N. Kemp Smith, The Meaning of Kant's Copernican Analogy, «Mind», n. s., xxii, 88,1913, pp. 549-551; repeated in Idem, Commentary to Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason". Second Edition, Amherst (ny), Humanity Books-Prometheus, 1999, pp. 22 ff). 3 B. Russell, Human Knowledge, Its Scope and Limits, London, Allen &amp; Unwin, 1948. Russell writes: «Kant spoke of himself as having effected a 'Copernican revolution', but he would have been more accurate if he had spoken of a 'Ptolemaic counter-revolution' since he put Man back at the centre from which Copernicus had dethroned him.» (as quoted by M. Miles, op. cit., p. 28).</page><page sequence="6">44 DENNIS SCHULTING gument concerning ah I first want to assess perspectivem, the view that is in some way related to it. In section 2, I examine perspectivem. I give reasons why I think that approach to Kant's Copernicanism is mistaken and why ah fails to provide an adequate interpré tation of the analogy. In section 3,1 speli out some general features of Kant's novel strategy in the Critique, which suggest a différent interprétation of Kant's reference to Copernicus. In that context, I briefly address the meaning of the so-called 'transcen dental turn'. Next I expound, very broadly, the general characteristics of Copernicus' revolution in light of its importance for the progress in planetary astronomy. In the subséquent section I show the extent to which Kant's revolution in metaphysics is typ ically Copernican and why, therefore, Kant's analogy should be considered apt. I con clude with a short note on the broadly hypothetico-experimental conception behind Kant's idea of rationality, which reinforces the aptness of the Copernican analogy. 2. PERSPECTIVISM AND THE COPERNICAN ANALOGY Before jettisoning perspectivem, let us consider some of the aspects that might seem to commend it as an appropriate take on Kant's Copernicanism. Although many have faulted perspectivism for its misleading picture of Kant's thought, some of its assump tions still hold sway considering the popularity of ah. It is important to expose them. The first impression one has when reading above-quoted passage from the B-pref ace, where Kant makes the analogy with Copernicus, suggests that Kant alludes to the ostensible fact that Copernicus, making no headway in his calculations of the planetary orbits, had a flash of insight: instead of supposing that the observer is the centre around which the galaxy, and in particular the sun, revolves we suppose that the cosmos is the stationary centre in which the observer takes her place. In the common picture, the sun moves across the horizon plane from east to west. There is nothing illusory about what the observer sees. But - and this is what, according to perspectivem, we imagine Copernicus thinking - the observer is not justified, based on her observations, to conclude that the earth and, therefore, her own geographical location is the stationary centre of the universe and that the sun in fact revolves in a sphere of which the earth is the centre. One ostensible reason for Copernicus to deny the, philosophically speaking, 'ob jective validity' of our perception of the apparent movement of the sun lies in the fact that, if it were the case that the earth orbited a (relatively) stationary sun (which - as we now, post-Copernicus, take for granted - is in fact the case), then the observed phe nomena would be exactly the same as in the converse Ptolemaic scenario of a sta tionary earth around which the sun circles. Put differently, the différences in the an gular distance between the sun and the horizon, which can be determined during a solar day can be caused by either the movement of the horizon or the apparent move ment of the sun.1 In other words, the observer, from the vantage point of her obser 1 Cf. PG, § 9 (AA ix 170): «The movement of the starry sky is only apparent, for because we do not observe the movement of the earth, upon which we are, we have an apparent movement of the sky but do not know whether the sky or the earth moves [...]. [We do not know] whether the starry sky or we change our position. The démonstration [Beweis] that the earth is not at rest but that precisely it is the earth that moves had to be given with exceptional subtlety.» (my transi.).</page><page sequence="7">KANT'S COPERNIC AN ANALOGY: BEYOND THE NON-SPECIFIC READING AS vation, that is, purely on the basis of the data delivered through perception, does not have at her disposai the adequate criteria for objectively establishing the truth of ei ther perspective. This situation suggests that the perspective that the observer adopts détermines, or more appropriately, constrains her knowledge of reality. The constraint concerns a necessary functional condition of her perception of reality. Consequently, the straightforward reading of Kant's Copernicanism, viz., perspectivem, insists on the necessarily perspectival nature of our relation to objective reality: objects must be ex plained in terms of our perceptual point of view; in other words, they must be taken in a point-of-viewish way. This is taken to explain the subjective turn of Kant's phi losophy, for all experience of reality rests on the necessary subjective condition, a transcendental condition, under which experience is first possible (with respect to the meaning of the term 'transcendental' see further below, section 3).1 To be sure, Kant himself seems to suggest such a perspectivalist reading in another passage where he makes an analogy with Copernicus, who hypothesized, as Kant writes, that we «seek for the observed movements not in the objects of the heavens, but in their observer» (KrV, B xxii, note; emphasis added).2 One could argue that notwithstanding the fact that we now take for granted that it is not the case that the earth is the centre of the cosmos, we do hold on, as if per habitum infusum, to the picture of a sun that moves ffom east to west across the hori zon plane. Of course, this is not because of a habit we cannot give up. That we cling to this picture rather issues ffom the incontrovertible contingent fact that our per ceptive abilities are constrained by our characteristic spacetime-perception (and therefore by our location in space and time) and ffom certain optical considérations.3 The scientific détermination that the resulting représentation of the sun moving across the horizon plane is merely an appearance does nothing to detract ffom that fact. In other words, the scientific worldview is not simply a Substitute for the mani fest worldview. For one thing, our perceptual constitution is such that it eo ipso constrains the number of stars that in any arbitrary observation, at some point during the night, can be observed. At a particular moment on any given night two fifths of the amount of stars in the galaxy are located below the horizon beyond which they would be ob servable. Furthermore, the possibility of observing a particular star is determined by the particular point in time at which the observation takes place. These are both empirical constraints that have to do with the observer's perceptual constitution and geographical position vis-à-vis the constellation of the stars.4 Perspectivism refers to these unmistakable features of our human perceptual capacity. However, perspectivism is problematic as a reading of Kant's Copernicanism. On this reading, important aspects of both Copernicus' 'invention' and Kant's reasons for referring to it by way of analogy remain unexplained or are entirely neglected. I list frve reasons why I believe that perspectivism is misguided or at least inadequate for ex 1 Cf. P. F. Strawson, The Bounds of Sense, London, Methuen, 1966, pp. 22 ff. 2 See also G.

It would be scarcely originai if Kant's intention with the analogy were (merely) to concern the necessary subjective nature of a description of reality, that is, the thought that we necessarily relate to the world in a point-of-viewish way, say. Strictly speaking, it is Descartes, not Kant, who should be credited for introducing the origi nai subjective viewpoint in philosophy,1 first made manifest in the publication of his Discours de la méthode in 1637. Taken at face value, the subjective turn in philosophy took place some 150 years prior to Kant's Critique. Kant's Copernicanism therefore cannot consist merely in a certain necessary subjectivism. 2. Perspectivism (and a fortiori ah; see below) does not explain the reasons both Copernicus and Kant had for bringing about the respective paradigm shifts through their «altered method of [...] way of thinking» (KrV, B xvm, B xix).2 The changes in cosmology, in Copernicus' case, and in epistemology, in Kant's, are not the result of a trivial claim concerning the conceptual necessity of adopting a perspective. Nor is it the case that those changes refer simply to the historical fact that another per spective has been adopted (this is ali too often the association that one has with the notion of a paradigm shift). The respective changes are motivated by what they can accomplish in terms of solving a lingering problem in a related field of research, i.e., a problem in mathematical astronomy for Copernicus and a problem of meta physics for Kant. Perspectivism cannot accommodate this two-tier feature of Coper nicanism. 3. Whereas perspectivism might at first sight seem appropriate as an interprétation of the Kantian story (that is, on a certain phenomenalistic reading of it; see point 4 below), it quite clearly does not sit well with Copernicus' intentions, for perspec tivism could not explain why we should Substitute a heliocentric worldview for a geo centric one (this hangs together with what was said under point 2 and earlier on in this section).3 There must be another reason for Copernicus to stipulate heliocen trism other than the simple idea of perspectivism. Perspectivism as such does not dif ferentiate between the geocentric view and the heliocentric one; in both cases the ce lestial host is observed empirically in the same way, given spatiotemporal conditions, 1 Cf. K. Ameriks, op. cit., p. 296. 2 Bird's intimation that the «altération in our way of thinking», of which Kant speaks (e.g., KrV, B xix; B xxn, note), is to do simply with «a change front one point of view to another» (op. cit., p. 30) is typical of the lack, in the literature, of an account of Kant's motivation to argue for changing the point of view, which is pre cisely what any interested reader of Kant's ostensibly revolutionary philosophy would wish to know. To be fair, Bird does go on to give a more balanced view of the matter than is suggested by his remark. But, notwith standing an interesting general account of the second édition preface, Bird, like most commentators, fails to exploit the Copernican analogy itself by probing the similarities between Kant's and Copernicus' methods of reasoning. 3 This explains why in the past commentators have argued that the heliocentric conséquences of the Coper nican revolution are of no relevance to Kant's analogy, which supposedly is merely concerned with explaining apparently objective phenomena in terms of subjective conditions (cf. M. Miles, op. cit., pp. 2 ff., 28; Miles gives Kemp Smith and Paton as illustrations of this view); but the dissociation of Kant's interest in making the analogy from the postulation of a heliocentric universe is of course dépendent on what I contend is the mis taken notion of Kant's main concern as having to do with perspectivism. It is clear at any rate that on perspec tivism the central feature of the Copernican revolution, i.e., the necessary truth of heliocentrism, cannot be accounted for.</page><page sequence="9">KANT'S COPERNIC AN ANALOGY: BEYOND THE NON-SPECIFIC READING 47 so that from a purely conceptual point of view both perspectives are equally possible and equally valid. Put differently, at a time when the geocentric worldview was in force, in 150 ad say, one observed exactly the same phenomenon - viz., the sun mov ing across the horizon plane - as we do in our post-1543 heliocentric worldview. Worldviews do not in any way change the physio-psychological structure of our mode of perception. They have the function of giving cohérence to our observations against the backdrop of the whole of our opinions and views. Thus, if perspectivem seems to fit Kant's story, but at any rate not Copernicus', then at least perspectivism cannot claim on account of the theory of perspectivism that there is any significant analogy between Kant and Copernicus; and so, even generally, perspectivism fails as a relevant approach to Copernicanism. 4. Perspectivism falsely implies a psychologistic reading of Kant's representational ism and of his notorious thesis of the ideal nature of objects, as if the most impor tant resuit of Kant's revolution in metaphysics lie in an acknowledgment of the lim itations of our Cognition of things. Inevitably, perspectivism issues in cognitive relativism. This is conveyed by the strongly phenomenalist (read: Berkeleyan) inter prétation of Kant's idealism.1 The standard phenomenalistic reading of Kant comes down to an empirical construal of the 'appearances', Kant's technical term for the objects of perception, which as such would be reducible to our mere représentations and would not be the things themselves.2 According to this reading, we have only knowledge of these appearances (as mere représentations), not of the things them selves.3 Although I cannot address here the ongoing controversies surrounding Kant's idealism and the specific meaning of Kant's theory of the phenomenality of material bodies, I should like to note that there appears to be an internal relation be tween perspectivism and the strong phenomenalistic interprétation of Kant's idealism (this is not to say that Van Cleve is a perspectivist in his reading of Kant's Coperni can turn). 5. It would be reasonable to conclude that, if perspectivism (with its aforementioned phenomenalistic connotations) is right, Copernicus' revolution in astronomy and Kant's rather Ptolemaic approach are at radical variance, a criticism already made by Russell (1948) and earlier by Kemp Smith (1913). That perspectivism is stili, explicitly or implicidy, a populär strategy for reading Kant's Copernicanism is odd to say the least, 1 Cf. J. Van Cleve, Problems from Kant, New York, Oxford University Press, 1999, pp. 5-12. See K. Ameriks, op. cit., pp. 77-88 for a critique of Van Cleve's phenomenalistic reading of Kant's idealism in the context of a general study of Berkeleyan interprétations of Kant's idealism. I am not sure if Van Cleve's complex interpré tation can indeed be qualified as a standard phenomenalistic, let alone Berkeleyan reading of Kant's idealism. I discuss elements of Van Cleve's interprétation of Kantian idealism in D. Schulting, Kant's Idealism: The Current Debate, in Kant's Idealism, eds. D. Schulting and J. Verbürgt, Dordrecht, Springer, forthcoming. 2 Cf. the often-maligned passage in the fourth paralogism in Kant's Critique at A 369, where Kant claims that «ali appearances must be considered mere représentations». 3 Cf. P. Guyer, op. cit., p. 51. Guyer notes a conflict between the Copernican analogy and Kant's doctrine of idealism; but there is only a conflict, because typically Guyer argues that «[o]n Kant's theory [...] we are sup posed to downgrade our experience of objects to mere appearance without knowing anything about the real character of those objects at ali», which supposedly contrasts with the Copernican idea of downgrading «our observations of the motions of the planets [...] to merely apparent motions» by way of «deriv[ing] the appar ent motions of the planets from a Substantive and ultimately well-grounded hypothesis about the real motions of the planets around the sun» (italics mine).</page><page sequence="10">48 DENNIS SCHULUNG for Russell's critique should have made clear that the analogy must be read different ly, lest the term 'Copernican' be vacuous.1 Here, I want to concentrate on what I indicated under 2, i.e., the thought that both Copernicus and Kant should have had specific reasons for bringing about their re spective révolutions. This implies that we should take the analogy in a more system atic fashion and not as just a broad indication of the historical fact of a paradigm shift (ah); and that accordingly Kant's Copernicanism cannot be interpreted in the mere ly conceptual sense of the necessity of adopting a perspective (perspectivism). As said earlier, the historical reading of Kant's analogy in terms of a proposai to change par adigm (ah) is a compromise solution meant to deflate Russell's misplaced criticism against Kant's alleged Ptolemaicism (in the vein of: 'since there indeed seems to be a fundamental dissimilarity between Copernicus' heliocentric perspective and Kant's anthropomorphism, the analogy should be taken in a loose sense only'). ah seems still determined by perspectivism. Instead of acceding to Russell's critique by pointing out, as Allison and others do, that Kant's reference to Copernicus is meant purely fig uratively, as merely a façon de parler,2 we would do better to reject perspectivism alto gether and seek another explanation of Kant's Copernicanism. I contend that Kant's Copernican analogy (and, equally, his references to Galileo, Bacon, Torricelli and, less felicitously, Stahl and his references to mathematics, logie and physics in general; cf. KrV, B xv-xvi) has a more than figurative, historical func tion. I argue that the analogy points to a rational-reconstructive strategy for solving a lingering problem, an approach that Kant copies from the expérimental, hypo thetico-deductive method that since the days of Bacon is the prototypical method of the empirical sciences.3 What is at issue here is what Kant characterizes as «the essen 1 Although ostensibly equally unconvinced of what I cali ah (cf. M. Miles, op. cit., p. 20) as the analogy is, as Miles justly notes, «far more illuminating than is generally recognized» (p. 4), effectively Miles' recent in terprétation of Kant's Copernican turn does not, to my mind, differ significantly from the standard reading. As noted earlier (see note 5 on p. 41 above), Miles (p. 25) sees the analogy in Kant's and Copernicus' attack on common sense, but even if this were the case, pointing this out would not explain both their motivations to launch such an attack. Only insight into the motivation or reasons behind it could establish the aptness of the analogy. Furthermore, although he rightly notes the importance of experiment for Kant's thought, I find Miles' interprétation of central tenets of Kant's thought so off the mark, in particular his talk of the mind imposing its conditions or laws on things or nature (pp. 4, 7,10,13) and of Kant's supposed «transcendental turn toward ontological idealism» (p. 10), that I am unsure as to whether he can cash out what he claims to be the central motifs behind the Copernican analogy (see for a summary of his account M. Miles, op. cit., pp. 4-7). 2 Cf. M. Miles, op. cit., p. 7, note 18. 3 The analogy with the expérimental method of the empirical exact sciences holds only insofar as the typ ical form of the experiment is concerned, not its specific content, for, as Kant himself asserts, reason does not work with empirical facts, but with her own abstract forms, i.e., «concepts and principles» (cf. KrV, B xvm, note). It is thus inappropriate to criticize, as Karl Popper (K. Popper, Conjectures and Réfutations, London-New York, Routledge, 2002, pp. 268, 271) seems to do, Kant's reference to the expérimental method for his failure to adopt the falsification model of science. Other than in a scientific experiment Kant's philosophical experiment, and philosophy in general, do not concern falsifiable empirical laws but logicai principles for experience in gen eral, which can (and must) be apodictically demonstrated. One may well ask whether Kant is capable of prov ing the universal, apodictic validity of such principles; but criticisms against this do not rest on falsification. Falsification (in the sense that Popper has in mind for the sciences) cannot be an appropriate criterion for phi losophy, for in philosophy there are no facts that contradict theory. Philosophical critique consists in the scruti ny of a certain form of reasoning as to its inner rational cohérence (cf. M. Miles, op. cit., pp. 19 ff.: see p. 20, note 44 for a reference to a very crude reading of Kant's appeal to the expérimental method). It is also impor</page><page sequence="11">KANT'S COPERNIC AN ANALOGY: BEYOND THE NON-SPECIFIC READING 49 rial element in the change in the ways of thinking that has been so advantageous to [the sciences]» (KrV, B xvi; italics mine); and so, by implication, the analogy that Kant makes points to the essential element of the Copernican revolution. An important additional advantage of my proposai is that alleged problems con cerning Kant's idealism can thus be avoided. If it becomes clear that Kant's Coperni canism has nothing to do with perspectivism or perspectival change per se, but in stead concerns a methodological approach comparable to that of Copernicus, which charts our knowledge in a more 'scientifìcally' cogent and rational manner, then phe nomenalistic préoccupations with Kant's idealism, which I noted are inherently re lated to perspectivism, rest on premises that are foreign to Kant's Copernicanism. For reasons of space I must leave a study of the thorny issues concerning Kant's idealism for another occasion. 3. Transcendental Reflection, 'How possible'-questions AND Kant's «ALTERATION IN OUR WAY OF THINKING» Before I discuss, in section 5, that which characterizes Kant's revolution in meta physics as typically Copernican, I want to give a broad outline of some general, basic features of Kant's new way of thinking. This will be somewhat sketchy. I provide a more extensive account of these features, in the context of a reading of Kant's Tran scendental Déduction, elsewhere.1 These features concern Kant's view of what a crit icai metaphysics, which will be able to come forward as a rigorous science that proves to be the equal of the exact sciences, should be like. To state it sweepingly, a centrai feature of Kant's thought is a certain amount of self-reflexiveness. This is already made manifest by the very title of Kant's Critique of PureReason. The title indicates a subjective as well as an objective genitive declension, which implies that it concerns both a critique of pure reasoning insofar as reason threatens to become speculative and a critique that is self-reflexively being performed by reason itself - it is in this context that in the preface to the first édition of the Critique Kant speaks strikingly of the «self-knowledge» of reason (KrV, A xi; see also A 849 B 877; cf. R 4284, AA xvii 495). It concerns two aspects of one and the same act of reasoning: explication of the conditions for objective, non-speculative, knowledge and self-explication or a self-awareness of sorts. I come back to this below. The second, related, element that I want to stress might strike one as obvious, which though it is not: Kant's project concerns both a theory of experience or knowl tant to note that although Kant's method bears an intimate relation with the method of science, clearly the systematicity that Kant has in mind for metaphysics is of a différent kind than that which science aims for; the method of philosophy can therefore not be the same method that science employs in regard to its ohject, which for philosophy is not empirical and a posteriori but formai and a priori. Although 1 believe that for the pur poses of introducing a new kind of philosophy, Kant adopts a style of reasoning that is a close analogue of the hypothetico-deductive procedure of science, it would be mistaken straightforwardly to label the philosophical method, as conceived of by Kant and adopted throughout the Critique, hypothetico-deductive, much less to consider the outcome of his proper philosophical arguments as merely hypothetical. This explains the fact that Kant was adamant not to consider the proofs provided in the body of the Critique as anything less than apod ictic (see, e.g., the note to KrV, B xxn). 1 thank Claudio La Rocca for rightfully insisting on this important point. See further below, note 1 at p. 53, note 2 at p. 59 and section 5. 1 See D. Schulting, Kant's Déduction From Apperception. On Explaining the Catégories, forthcoming.</page><page sequence="12">50 DENNIS SCHULTING edge and a metaphysics. A theory of knowledge traditionally deals with the condi tions of the Cognition of things or events in the world. Metaphysics traditionally con cerns the most fundamental déterminations of being in reality, of the things or their properties and events themselves. Very broadly speaking, Kant's Copernican turn consists in the fact, apart from its obvious criticai aspect, that the theory of knowl edge and metaphysics can no longer he kept separate as a matter of course. In Kant's view, it is no longer the case that the object, as it is presented in reality, comes apart from the way we represent it. Nor is it the case that, purely epistemically, the manner in which we talk about the object is separable front the way the object, qua object, is. The thought of an object is reflected in the object itself, whilst the object is first made manifest in thought. The object is always an objecter thought. In other words, the objectivity of an object is a characteristic attributed to it by thought. In this way, one discerns a certain conceptual reciprocity between thought and object to the extent that the object is an object for thought. This mutuai aspect reflects two sides of the same func tion that reason or thought operates by means of self-reflection. This actuality nec essarily arises, according to Kant, from the notion that the thought itself about the relation between thought and the world of things logically assumes the privileged po sition in that relation (the relation is therefore a three-place relation). In the same vein should we understand Kant's oft-cited remark (KrV, B 303 ff.) that «the proud name of an ontology, which présumés to offer synthetic a priori cogni tions of things in general in a systematic doctrine (e.g., the principle of causality), must give way to the modest one of a mere analytic of the pure understanding.» In the late, unpublished text What Real Progress has Metaphysics made in Germany since the Time of Leibniz an^ Woljfi, Kant uses the term «ontology» or also «Wesenlehre» for what in the Critique he calls analytic of experience, which is often conveniently inter preted as Kant's description for theory of knowledge.1 One could argue, therefore, that the meaning of the term 'ontology' changes with Kant. That is, it is not the case, as many interpreters believe, that Kant's transcendental philosophy, the label for his particular criticai reflection of reason, has discarded ontology once and for all. Kant's transcendental philosophy rather focuses on a diffèrent outlook on what is tradition ally covered by ontology, viz., the fundamental predicates of being.2 Transcendental philosophy is an ontology of sorts. More generally, any theory of knowledge présupposés a certain metaphysical out look, and no metaphysics is meaningful without incorporating a theory of knowl edge. This last aspect concerns the requirement of a reflexive stance toward one's own assumptions or beliefs, of a reflection on the capacity for Cognition as such, which is always in the background whilst putting forward any arbitrary metaphysical 1 Kant writes: «Ontology is that science (as part of metaphysics) which consists in a system of ali concepts of the understanding and principles, but only so far as they refer to objects that can be given to the senses, and thus confirmed by experience.» (FM, AA xx 260; trans. H. E. Allison et ahi: I. Kant, Theoretical Philosophy after 1781, ed. by H. E. Allison and P. Heath, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 354). According to Kant, in the same passage, ontology is also called «transcendental philosophy, because it contains the conditions and first elements of ali our knowledge a priori» (cf. KrV, A 845 B 873; FM, AA xx 286:1. Kant, Theoretical Philoso phy after ìy Si, p. 376). 2 Significandy, Kant labels the «pure concepts of the understanding», «e.g., [...] substance», «ontological predicates» in the first introduction to the Critique of the Power of Judgment (AA v 181). Cf. AA viti 190, note.</page><page sequence="13">KANT'S COPERNIC AN ANALOGY: BEYOND THE NON-SPECIFIC READING 51 postulate or adopting any stance apropos of the world. Particularly in metaphysics, which according to Kant suffers ffom a lack of scientific standard (no continuity and consolidation of success, no general, uniform criteria, etc.; see further section 5 be low), such self-reflection regarding its speculative pretensions is called for. Through self-reflection Kant aims to delimit the boundaries of metaphysical spéc ulation, for by virtue of reason's continuous self-examination one is always remind ed of the necessary conditions under which claims about reality are justifiable.1 Ai ready early on, in a letter ffom 1771 to his most important Student Marcus Herz, Kant referred to his new project, which was eventually to become the Critique of Pure Reason, as «The bounds of sensibility and of reason».2 For the greater part, the reflection on metaphysics consists, according to Kant, in delimiting the domain within which its a priori concepts are applicable, that is, delimiting them to what is capable of being sensibly perceived. This délimitation of the applicability of a priori concepts is congruent with determining the legitimacy of the de facto employment of fundamental, metaphysical concepts (the a priori concepts or catégories, of which Kant speaks) and the a priori principles in which these concepts are typically expressed. In the chapter of the Critique in which he accuses Leibniz of an ambiguous use of the concepts of reflection, Kant calls such a kind of reflection «transcendental re flection» (KrV, A 261 B 317). A transcendental reflection is a reflection on the déter mination whether the représentations one has belong to either the pure intellect or sensible intuition. Without elaborating on the particularities of Kant's critique of Leibniz's rationalism, it may be argued that Kant's criticai project as a whole is such an exercise in transcendental reflection, a reflection namely on the relation of con cepts and représentations to their respective cognitive faculties, intuition and the un derstanding, between which, famously, Kant makes an irreducible distinction but which he also claims are inextricably related (cf. the off-quoted passage at KrV, B 75: «Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind»). This reflection takes place, not ffom within an untainted, innate faculty in abstraction ffom experience. Rather, transcendental reflection is a dynamical process of thought, which thought executes in its very relation to objective reality, thus in ex perience itself. In other words, the critique that this reflection enacts is a mode of reasoning which consistently examines or explicates itselP critically to the extent that whilst experiencing reality self-reflective thought is aware of the centrai con cern of metaphysics, viz., explicating the fundamental predicates of being, of the very things that are being experienced. 1 In Prol § 40 (AA iv 328) Kant directly associâtes a «safeguard against the aberrations into which reason falls when it mistakes its destination», and illusorily holds «the subjective ground of our judgments to be objective», with «a self-knowledge of pure reason». 2 Br AA x 123 (I. Kant, Correspondence, transi, and ed. A. Zweig, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1999, P-127). 3 R 4284, AA xvii 495 (I. Kant, Notes and Fragments, ed. and transi. P. Guyer et adii, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, p. 125; italics added): «Metaphysics is not a science, not scholarship, but rather merely under standing acquainted with itself[blos der sich selbst kennende Verstand], hence it is merely a correction of the healthy understanding and reason. [...] Metaphysics serves to decide the boundaries of other sciences and keeps manktnd at its vocation, which concerns the use and the limits of reason; it is logicai self-cognition [logische Selbst erkenntnis].»</page><page sequence="14">52 DENNIS SCHULTING The question that now arises is: what is exactly understood by 'transcendental'? Kant himself says that all that Cognition is transcendental «that is occupied not so much with objects but rather with our mode of Cognition of objects insofar as this is to be possible a priori» (KrV, B 25). From this one might be inclined to infer that Kant keeps a certain distance from the objects, fforn reality as such. This would sug gest that Kant articulâtes an epistemological preference at the cost of metaphysical interests. In this respect one often speaks of Kant's transcendental turn, but such talk reveals unexplained assumptions with regard to the Kantian position more than clarifies it. Moreover, in the Strawsonian school of Kantianism the term 'transcen dental' underwent a transformation in the debate on transcendental arguments. There, 'transcendental' no longer has the specific meaning that Kant lends it - Cog nition insofar as it is a priori - but becomes a kind of marker for a type of argument that, by virtue of conceptual analysis, stipulâtes a necessary condition y for some ob ject or event x, that is, something that must be presupposed for something else to be possible. This type of argument concerns epistemological questions of the 'how possible' kind.1 Now it is certainly the case that Kant's transcendental philosophy can be charac terized in terms of a 'how possible'-question, if only because Kant himself couches the centrai concern of the criticai project in these terms (see the very chapter titles of the Prolegomena). It concerns indeed the inquiry into the conditions of possibili ty of having experience or Cognition of objects. This question hangs together with the issue of which I spoke above, viz., the question of delineating the domain of possible Cognition and establishing the legitimacy of the employment of a priori concepts (such as cause) and the principles in which these concepts find expression (e.g., the causality principle). But more is at stake than merely a question concern ing conditions of the possibility of experience or knowledge. Kant's strategy in the Critique resides precisely in proposing an «altération in our way of thinking» (KrV, B xix; emphasis added), that is, an alternative method to explain truth and knowledge (which, to be sure, is more than explaining what justifies claims to knowledge, the prerogative of standard epistemology). The novelty of Kant's thought is not just about a new kind of argument, which can be added to the arsenal of arguments in the textbooks of metaphysics. Put differently, it is not about a problem hitherto un covered. Kant's transcendental thinking rather introduces a new approach to an age old question. That is why the transcendental concerns not just the object of inquiry, but also the manner in which the inquiry is launched and progresses. In particular, it relates to the way in which the argument for the explanation of truth and knowl edge is launched and reasoned. That which is specifically transcendental about Kant's investigation does not merely boil down to what is characterizable as a 'how possible'-question, as is insisted upon in the debate on transcendental arguments. Transcendental philosophy is just as well about how the 'how possible'-question is itself posed and how that question leads to newer, better results in philosophical in 1 I derive this label front Q. Cassam, The Possibility cf Knowledge, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 2007, pp. 1-9. See ibidem, pp. 51-84 for a précis of transcendental arguments that have some connection to Kant's Déduction ar gument. Cassam himself offers a criticai account of transcendental arguments, which sees them as différent from epistemologica! how-possible questions in the way that Cassam interprets the latter.</page><page sequence="15">KANT'S COPERNIC AN ANALOGYI BEYOND THE NON-SPECIFIC READING 53 quiry (I come back to this in the context of explicating what makes Kant's episte mologica! revolution typically Copernican). The manner in which this question must be posed relates to the fact that the transcendental regards the possibility of a priori Cognition of objects, i.e., insofar as thought fforn within itself (a priori), through «self-knowledge», provides the foundation for the possibility of knowledge in general. What is new about Kant's transcendental approach in metaphysics is that the analysis of the conditions of the ground of truth and knowledge must, in some sense, be able to explain itself, that is, seì/:explain its procedure. The analysis is 'self explanatory' (in the sense of self-explicatory or self-clarificatory) and as such self-re flexive. More expressively put: given that analysis is the way of thinking, in the analysis of knowledge thought itself relates to itself in order to account for its man ner of analyzing or explicating. There is a lot here that needs élaboration and ex egetical backup but this is at any rate the general idea behind Kant's talk about the Critique being «a treatise on the method» (KrV, B xxn). More in particular, the Cri tique is a treatise on how the method of explication must be made explicit in the ex position of the matter in hand. The explication of the conditions of possibility of knowledge or experience thus has a double, reflexive aspect, parallel to the dual as pect of the very title of the Critique of Pure Reason, which I indicated at the begin ning of this section. The explication is an explanation of the conditions of experience or knowledge, certainly, but equally it is an explanation, an exposition, of the method of such an explanation.1 In a word, it is «the understanding knowing itself [der sich selbst kennende Verstand]».2 4. Copernicus' Hypothesis Before I relate Kant's general methodical approach to his Copernicanism, let us look at Copernicus' hypothesis, which led to the now standard astronomy that bears his 1 A philosophical exposition of knowledge cannot simply rely on a pre-given method, which it subsequently applies axiomatically. Why not? In order that a philosophical argument have probative force, the corrélation between the method of reasoning and that for which it serves as such, viz., the explication or analysis of knowl edge or experience, must be demonstrated in the explication itself as to its necessary application. In other words, the method must he accounted for in the explication itself. Philosophical analysis is a graduai process in which the elements of knowledge are shown in their interrelatedness, literally 'on the way' (meta hodos). Hence, the methodical procedure of philosophical analysis must be ostensive (cf. KrV, A 789 B 817). An ax iomatic approach in philosophy, on the other hand, would rely on the assumption of principles (or external grounds) that are not further determinable and for which it does not account or give legitimate internai grounds. This can only lead to an infinite regress - the methodical foundation calls forth a further ground and so on ad infinitum. More disturbingly, with an axiomatic approach no account is given for the relation between the method adopted and the exposition itself. To what extent is, on the axiomatic approach, the particular method adopted appropriate for the kind of analysis that is being provided? Could other methods (and what kind) do an equally good job? If applied to the particular case of Kant's epistemology, one discerns that an axiomatic approach would leave doubtful whether the stipulated necessary conditions of possibility for knowl edge are indeed as necessary and a priori as Kant claims. Such a doubtful outcome is always the result of apa gogie proof, for such a proof does «never [produce] comprehensibility of the truth in regard to its connection with the grounds of its possibility», that is, it does not give «insight into [the] sources [of truth]» (KrV, A 789 B 817). To avoid doubt, therefore, philosophical proofs cannot be apagogie (abductive) nor epagogic (inductive), as in the empirical sciences, but must be ostensive (deductive). 2 R 4284 AA xvii 495 (I.

The reasoning underlying Copernicus' basic proposition concerning a helio centric universe, whichhe formulateci in hook i of his seminai On the Révolutions,1 can be schematized as follows:2 (A) Astronomy calculâtes the planetary cycles in accordance with a standard calcula tive model (B) Ali sorts of modifications are added to the standard model, which should clarify or explain away observed irregularities in the circular motion of celestial bodies3 (C) The sun circles around the observer [geocentric paradigm]; taking (A) and (B) as indications of the initial de facto situation in standard Ptolemaic astronomy and accepting (C) as the paradigmatic basic background assumption, which gives rise to (B), results in (D) No uniform explanation can be found for the irregularities in planetary cycles; but suppose we deny (C) and instead put forward the hypothesis that (E) The observer (and the planet earth on which she is positioned) circles around the sun [hypothesis of earth rotation/heliocentric universe]; now if we accept (E), then it appears that (D) does not resuit, for on (E) we get (F) A more coherent, uniform calculative model provides a better, more precise explanation of planetary cycles, and also clarifies the apparent irregularities of their orbits; since (F) means that (B) no longer applies, and thus (C) is disconfirmed by implica tion, the hypothesis (E) is to be accepted on the grounds of it yielding a more parsi monious and coherent theory showing greater explanatory power than on (C). What is signifkant here is that the thesis of a heliocentric perspective or earth ro tation is not even the primary goal of Copernicus' revolution, but merely a means to an end. Copernicus' aim was an increase in the cohérence of astronomical computa tion, so that the orbits of the planets could be calculated more precisely. The under lying premise of Copernicus' reasoning concerned mainly a lack of cohérence in the 1 See N. Copernicus, On the Révolutions, pp. ti ff. The book's full title in Latin is De revolutionibtis orbium caelestium, published in Nuremberg in 1543. Copernicus espoused the heliocentric theory essentially already in the earlier Commentariolus, which he distributed among peers but which remained unpublished. Also just pri or to the publication of On the Révolutions, Copernicus' supporter G. J. Rheticus summarised the heliocentric theory in his Narratio prima (1541). For these works see N. Copernicus, Das Neue Weltbild. 2 All sorts of technical detail in Copernicus' complex argumentation have evidently been omitted, not least because, as is well known, the greater part of Copernicus' classic consists of abstruse, now (partially) obsolete, mathematical calculations, which are entirely beyond the grasp of the uninitiated, not excluding myself. More over, Copernicus' innovations in mathematical astronomy were just the start of a mathematically simplified 'Copernican* astronomy, for which later Kepler and others, improving on and modifying Copernicus' inven tions, were as much responsible as Copernicus himself (this is also noted by P. Guyer, op. cit., p. 385, note 11). Here, I am merely interested in the general, philosophical, thrust behind Copernicus"first thoughts', which must be seen as underpinning his calculations. See for more technical detail Kuhns magisterial The Copernican Revo lution.

This point was brought up in discussion at the aforementioned Siegen Tagung on Kant and Copernicus.</page><page sequence="17">KANT'S COPERNIC AN ANALOGY1 BEYOND THE NON-SPECIFIC READING 55 existing mathematica! models or astronomy. Thomas Kuhn observes that the Coper nican revolution must primarily be considered a revolution in that it constituted an improvement upon the techniques employed by astronomers in order to determine the position of celestial bodies. Copernicus was concerned with astronomical reform more than with cosmological change. The notion of a heliocentric universe, more specifically the cosmological thesis of the earth's being in orbit around the sun, was in the first instance, as Kuhn avers, «an anomalous by-product of a proficient and devoted astronomer's attempt to reform the techniques employed in computing planetary position».1 In fact, the postulate itself of a rotating earth (the hypothesis actually concerned a threefold postulate: the earth's diurnal rotation, conical-axial rotation and orbital revolution, the last two annually)2 was, as Kuhn remarks (op. cit., p. 144), not without precedent, for long before Copernicus, in the in Century bc, the Greek mathematician Aristarchus of Samos had already advanced the notion of a heliocentric universe.3 In general, one may say that, as Kuhn writes in The Structure of Scientific Révolutions, «probably the single most prévalent claim advanced by the proponents of a new paradigm is that they can solve the problems that have led the old one to a crisis». Kuhn continues: «When it can legitimately be made, this claim is offen the most ef fective one possible.».4 Paradigm shiffs are correlative with the need to solve persist ent problems in a particular field of inquiry in the most economic way possible (though of course economy is not the only reason). As Kuhn asserts, paradigm shiffs characteristically result from an awareness of an anomaly.5 What caused the change in cosmological perspective (from geocentric to heliocentric) was Copernicus' growing discontent, being a technically proficient astronomer, with the accumulation of mathematical imprécision in the fundamental concepts of traditional planetary astronomy, which in essence was Ptolemaic.6 Kuhn refers to Copernicus' «profession al awareness of technical fallacy». As Kuhn pithily notes, «[a] feit necessity was the mother of Copernicus' invention.»7 It was thus a technical fallacy of mathematical astronomy that gave rise to a change in cosmology. For in the course of centuries a raff of modifications was added to the 1 T. S. Kuhn, The Copernican Revolution, p. 137. 2 See N. Copernici, On the Révolutions, pp. 22 ff. Cf. PG, § 9 (AA ix, pp. 171 ff.). It appears that Kant only distinguishes two motions, «one namely around [the earth's] own axis or its daily [motion], the other one around the sun or its yearly motion» (translation and emphasis mine). Kuhn suggests that the reason that Copernicus still required three circular motions for the earth has to do with his traditional (Aristotelian) belief that «the earth is a planet which is carried about the central sun by a sphere just like the one that used to car ry the sun about the central earth.» (T. S. Kuhn, The Copernican Revolution, p. 164). 3 More precisely, it was the Pythagorean Philolaus of Croton (ca. 470 to ca. 385 bc) who already advanced a cosmology, in which the earth was removed from the center, although in Philolaus' system the earth did not orbit the sun but rather the central fire. It is this Philolaus to whom Kant himself refers as Copernicus' precursor in a Reflexion (R 5064, AA xvin 77), where Kant writes: «Just like when philolaus said that the earth moves and copernick proved it.» (my translation). In the preface to On the Révolutions, Copernicus also, in a quoted remark front Plutarch, mentions Philolaus as a precursor who floated the idea of the earth's motion (N. Copernicus, On the Révolutions, pp. 5,12). 4 T. S. Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Révolutions, p. 153. 5 Ibidem, pp. 67 ff. 6 See, e.g., N. Copernicus, On the Révolutions, p. 8.

As a conséquence, there was effectively not just one Ptolemaic system, but many différent versions of it. (Notice the parallel here with the German school metaphysics prior to Kant, in which various schools advanced différent versions of an essentially identical rationalist out look on reality.) Kuhn speaks metaphorically of an astronomical «monster».1 The Ptolemaic system had lost its inner cohérence and mathematical précision. Coperni cus' central problem with the Ptolemaic astronomy related to the diffuse nature of ail its various computational models and the différent techniques invented to amend it, which effectively yielded great inaccuracy insofar as the détermination of plane tary cycles was concerned. Kuhn writes in this respect: «The astronomical tradition had become diffuse; it no longer fully specified the techniques that an astronomer might employ in computing planetary position, and it could not therefore specify the results that he would obtain ffom his computations».2 Now the revolutionary nature of Copernicus' invention lies in the use he made of the postulate of earth rotation for the benefit of refining mathematical computation of the planetary orbital system. Copernicus became aware of the possibility that the hypothesis of a rotating earth could well solve a lingering astronomical problem. How? Kuhn writes, paraphrasing a passage ffom Copernicus' On the Révolutions: «If the earth moves in an orbital circle around the center as well as spinning on its axis, then, at least qualitatively, the retrogade motions and the différent times required for a planet's successive journeys around the ecliptic can be explained without the use of epicycles».3 Copernicus' hypothesis proved useful because, whereas previously the addition of epicycles in the computations of the orbits of the planets - especially the sun bound planets Mercury and Venus - was an extra device, an ad hoc addendum to the geome try of geocentric astronomy, such an arbitrary addition was found to be unnecessary on the hypothesis of a rotating earth. In contrast to the scenario of an immobile earth, the orbital rotation of the earth in the heliocentric model eo ipso explains the irregularity of the retrograde planetary cycles without having to rely on too many epicycles (the scientific principle of parsimony!). Kuhn writes: «Retrograde motion and the variation of the time required to circle the ecliptic are the two gross plane tary irregularities which in antiquity had led astronomers to employ epicycles and deferents in treating the problem of the planets. Copernicus' system explains these same gross irregularities, and it does so without resorting to epicycles, or at least to major epicycles».4 The reason, therefore, for the correctness or the plausibility of Copernicus' hypothesis of a rotating earth lies in the fact that it is capable of ex plaining planetary orbits without the use of (too many) epicycles and deferents, whilst on that hypothesis it also becomes clear that observed irregularities only seem to be that as a conséquence of earth rotation. 1 T.

Mutatis mutandis, Kant's revolution in the ways of thinking in metaphysics suggests an alternative approach to an existing problem in a way very similar to Copernicus' innovation. Kant's particular problem concerns the question: How can knowledge be justified, that is, when can we be sure that our claims to knowledge are legitimate? And, concomitant with that question, how is metaphysics itself possible as a science? This approach, however, is not just the fairly novel thought that everything that we experience is subject to certain necessary constraints or so-called transcendental con ditions that relate to our subjective point of view (a question of the 'how possible' sort). It lies rather in the idea that the analysis that purports to explain these tran scendental conditions must itself be capable of being clarified, in an a priori manner, as the more cohérent explanation, comparable to the way in which the hypothesis of earth notation enabled Copernicus to do away with the ad hoc revisions of the stan dard model and put forward a more cohérent and stable explanatory model for plan etary astronomy. In Kant's own case the increased cohérence concerns a self-expla nation, a self-reflection or, as he himself calls it, «self-knowledge» of reason with regard to its own analysis of the necessary conditions of knowledge. And it is this thought that is Kant's unique 'invention', which ushered in an entirely new way of doing philosophy. In the next section, the specific connection between this invention of Kant's and his Copernicanism will be explored further. 5. KANT'S VERITABLE COPERNICANISM What now has Kant's 'altération in our way of thinking' got to do with what was of inestimable importance for the development of modem astronomy, the Copernican Revolution? What makes Kant's revolution in metaphysics typically Copernican? Can one consider Kant's analogy with Copernicus an apt one? Kant's Copernicanism turns out to concern his view of science and its model func tion for philosophy. This does not mean that what is at issue in the B-preface in gen eral and in the Analytic of the Critique more in particular concerns Kant's putative foundation of the sciences, specifically physical science. This is a view of Kant's the oretical philosophy made populär by the Marburg branch of the neo-Kantian school of thought (Hermann Cohen et alii), but I believe it is fundamentally mistaken. Kant's interest in science, here in the B-preface and in the Critique (and also in the Prolegome na, for that matter), relates to the exemplary function it may have for metaphysics. The central question thus concerns the extent to which metaphysics amounts to sci ence, not the metaphysical foundation of science. It is important to recognize that Kant's putative philosophy of science, articulated in his Metaphysical Foundations of Ibidem, p. 177. 2 As quoted ibidem, pp. 177-181.</page><page sequence="20">58 DENNIS SCHULTING Natural Science (1786), présupposés, as a separate prior investigation, a formal metaphysics of nature, i.e., his transcendental philosophy, for which he argued in the Critique. However, it is important to notice also that it is not the case that Kant simply adopts the scientific method for philosophy unmodified and without qualification; Kant is in terested in a properly metaphysical analogue of science's method.1 In the B-preface, Kant alludes to the criteria for «the secure course of a science» (KrV, B vii), of the «royal path» (KrV, B x) of science. These are: 1. a commonly agreed upon goal (unanimity), 2. steady progress, 3. consolidation of success and 4. univer sal access (science must be exoteric, not esoteric).2 Traditional metaphysics does not appear to comply with any of these standards for science - and one would argue that, given the current state of afifairs in philosophy, philosophy has still not met the re quirements of rigorous science. According to Kant, metaphysics is still characterized by a «battlefield», where various parochial factions and competing schools are en gaged in «mock combat» (KrV, B xv). Kant thinks that logie and mathematics, and al so the newer physical science, set the example, having reached a level of success very early on, although in the case of physics this took a little longer - notwithstanding the various competing théories, also in the sciences; however, in contrast to philosophy ail these schools of thought share the same single, incontestable basic scientific method, with which they conduct their research. As regards the sciences, Kant points out (KrV, B xm ff.) that «a sudden revolution in the way of thinking» (KrV, B xii) enabled these disciplines to establish themselves as rigorous sciences. The fundamental principle of the sciences rests on a general pat tern of thought by virtue of which one acquires an understanding of the object in their respective fields of inquiry. Such an insight is possible to the extent that certain results hang together in conformity with previously stipulated rules. For a physicist it holds that the laws of nature cannot simply be read off nature. Nature must obey the way in which the scientist charts nature, détermines it in accord with predetermined procédures.3 Paradigmatically, the physicist formulâtes a hypothesis concerning a connected whole of data, framed in theoretical terminology, which is subsequendy put to the test, whereby one establishes whether the test data conform to the hy pothesized theoretical framework. This results in the formation of a theory or law that becomes standard unless the hypothesis is falsified by counterevidence. Kant in terprets this in such a way that also the physicist, albeit implicitly,4 understands that the rationally acquired insight is obtained only because the resuit is produced or brought forth «according to its [i.e., the physicist's reasoning, D. S.] own design» (KrV, B xm). The rationality of the expérimental procedure lies precisely in the fact that the 1 I thank Claudio La Rocca for pressing this point.

See also KrV, A 125: «Thus we ourselves bring into the appearances that order and regularity in them that we call nature, and moreover we would not be able tofind it there if we, or the nature of our mind, had not originally put it there. For this unity of nature should be a necessary, i.e., a priori certain unity of the connection of appearances» (emphasis added). 4 Cf. M. Miles, Kant's "Copernican Revolution", p. 19, note 43. Evidently, the scientist need not have a firm grasp of the methodological underpinnings of his practice, let alone of its philosophical groundwork, in order to be able to do what he does. Cf.

The experiment that a scientist carries out is characterized by a certain non-trivial tautology: what is determinately known as law-governed is known in accord with pre-determined, pre-given, rules or procédures. Mutatis mu tandis, the same holds for mathematics and any science modelled after the mathe matical method.1 This is significant for an appréciation of the exact sciences and mathematics as exemplars for Kant's own thought apropos of the status of meta physics (or philosophy more generally).2 Kant's Copernicanism résides precisely in there being a philosophical analogue of this rational-experimental procedure that is characteristic of the sciences. Analogous to the exact sciences and to Copernicus' thought-experiment in partic ular, Kant introduces, in the passages in the B-preface just prior and directly following the passage quoted at the outset of this article, a thought-experiment for metaphysics («[tjhis experiment of pure reason» KrV, B xx, note; cf. B xvi), so that in a similar way metaphysics pursue the secure course of science. The passage in question reads: Up to now it has been assumed that [C] all our Cognition must conform to the objects; but [D] all attempts to find out something about them a priori through concepts that would extend our Cognition have, on this presupposition, come to nothing. Hence let us once try whether we do not get farther with [A] the problems of metaphysics by [E] assuming that the objects must conform to our Cognition, which would agree better with [B] the requested possibility of an a priori Cognition of them, which is to establish something about objects before they are given to us [...].3 [D] If intuition has to conform to the constitution of the objects, then I do not see how we can know anything of them a priori; but if [E] the object (as an object of the senses) conforms to the constitution of our faculty of intuition, then [F] I can very well rep resent this possibility to myself.4 The thought-experiment expressed in this quotation can be put in the following way (the letters that have been intercalated in above passage are presented in the order of the argument): (A) Metaphysics is a priori Cognition of objects (B) In order to have a priori Cognition of objects we must know something about ob jects before we experience them (C) Knowledge corresponds to objects in the way we experience them as empirical ly given [standard correspondence theory of truth]; 1 Evidently, for mathematics the expérimental method as such does not apply. However, as Kant points out in the B-preface, for the mathematician holds too, just as for the physicist (cf. KrV, B xiii ff.), that he does not «trace what he [sees] in this figure [i.e., "the isosceles triangle"], or even trace its mere concept, and read off, as it were, from the properties of the figure; but rather [...] producejs] the latter from what he himself thought into the object and presented (through construction) according to a priori concepts, and that in order to know some thing securely a priori he had to ascribe to the thing nothing except what followed necessarily from what he himself had put into it in accordance with its concept» (KrV, B xii; emphasis added). Cf. KrV, A 713 B 741. 2 There is of course also a dear disanalogy with the scientific hypothetico-deductive method: the typical scientist's practice consists in positing falsifiable theses, whereas the philosopher does not posit falsifiable thè ses but puts forward hypothèses with a view to apodictically proving principles that hold a priori and neces sarily (see note 3 on p. 48 above). 3 The omitted passage is the one where Kant makes the Copernican analogy, quoted at the outset of this article. 4 KrV, B xvi-xvn. In the passage following this one, Kant argues that, mutatis mutandis, the same holds re garding the object's conformity to conceptual conditions.</page><page sequence="22">60 DENNIS SCHULTING taking (A) as the standard view of metaphysics (which Kant accepts), (B) as implied by définition and (C) as the paradigmatic background assumption of traditional epis temology, which in some way is thought to underwrite (B), results in (D) If knowledge of an object x conforms to x as it is experienced as empirically giv en (viz., a posteriori), then ex hypothesi knowledge cannot be a priori; we discern in (D) that on (C) a contradiction with (B) results. In fact, on (C) a priori Cognition, and thus metaphysics, is impossible. Now suppose that instead of (C) we advance hypothesis (E) Objects correspond to our manner of cognizing them [hypothesis of transcenden tal Cognition]; if we accept (E), we can avoid the contradiction shown in (D), for (F) «we can cognize of things a priori only what we ourselves have put into them» (KrV, B xviii), that is, we have a priori Cognition of things insofar as they corre spond with the a priori forms of Cognition, or, have some kind of Cognition of them before we experience them; since (F) means that the contradiction shown in (D) is avoided and (C) is thereby dis confirmed, the hypothesis (E) is to be accepted on the grounds of it yielding a more logically coherent theory showing greater explanatory force than on (C). In this thought-experiment Kant shows to be in basic agreement with the traditional view of true knowledge: to wit truth as adaequatio rei et intellectus.1 Yet according to the traditional interprétation of adaequatio thought must correspond to the thing (as in C), such that, given certain empirical conditions, the thing x, which affects the sens es, must be seen as isomorphically identical to the forms of the understanding y, so that y maps on x. Ys représentation of x is in fact an exact copy of, and as such pro duced or caused by, represented x. However, the relation between x and y can on such a causal account of knowledge only be an a posteriori knowable one, for x must first affect the senses in order for the relation to y to obtain, so that y corresponds to x (only a divine mind could know a priori a thing's properties).2 With a view to the possibil 1 Cf. KrV, B 82 ff. A 58 ff. 2 Cf. Prol, § 9; KrV, B125 and A128 ff. Cf. K. Ameriks, Interpreting Kant's Critiques, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 2003, pp. 99-101. in the context of explicating the «Criticai problem of knowledge» (p. 99), Ameriks usefully con trasts what he labels the ectypal hypothesis with the archetypical hypothesis regarding the relation between représentation and object. The ectypal hypothesis would represent, among other broadly realist positions, the view of «dogmatic realists [who] say that objects direcdy produce our représentations»; the archetypal hy pothesis, on the other hand, holds that «it is our représentations that produce objects» (p. 100). Ameriks notes: «One problem with the ectypal hypothesis [...] is that by itself it is insufficient to explain the peculiarity of epis temic représentation as such. To say that a particular représentation somehow cornes into being as the resuit of the world's impact or 'affection' is not yet to say how that représentation cornes to have the complexity req uisite for being considered a human cognitive state, i.e., a state that does not simply 'match' the world in some sense - as a mirror image might match something - but is such that it can be true or false, justifìed or unjusti fied» (ibidem). Importantly, as Ameriks points out, «any such causal account would appear at best to be able to explain only contingent effects». Given that Kant believes, as Ameriks continues, «that our représentations in clude a priori knowledge, and that a prioricity brings necessity with it, then the ectypal hypothesis appears in sufficient for an extra 'modal' reason» (ibidem). I believe that Ameriks is furthermore right to point out, with reference to Prol, § 9, that for Kant it is not only a priori knowledge that is seen to be impossible on a causal ac count of experience, but even in «mm-apriori cases» it remains «mysterious» how «accidents of objects» might be thought of as «migrat[ing] into finite intuiting subjects» (p. 101). In other words, Kant has «a general objec tion to empiricism», although the problem could lie in «ectypalism of any sort», namely any type of theory</page><page sequence="23">KANT'S COPERNIC AN ANALOGYI BEYOND THE NON-SPECIFIC READING 6l ity of an a priori analysis of truth Kant inverts the above perspective, without how ever relinquishing the notion of truth as correspondence. This concerns his so-called 'transcendental turn: we must take the thing such that it conforms to thought. The reversai of thought implies that, from within thought, a rigorous relation is established between, on the one hand, the necessary conditions or rules' under which a thing x must stand in order to first count as an object for me, the cognizing or thinking sub jecty, and, on the other hand, the conditions or rules of thought or the understand ing itself (y). Only in this case, Kant argues, is a priori Cognition of x possible and in fact ex hypothesi, for those two sets of conditions or rules are specifìed by the under standing itself (y) and thus the relation of correspondence between them can be grasped logically by the cognizing subject, that is, the understanding (F). This idea is in agreement with the thought that «nothing can be ascribed to the objects except what the thinking subject takes out of itself» (KrV, B xxin).2 By means of this thought-experiment of pure reason Kant believes he has provid ed a «touchstone» (KrV, B xvm) for establishing the legitimacy of metaphysical claims, and establishing it apodictically to boot. The hypothesis of inverting the rela tion between the intellect (understanding) and object first makes possible meta physics as a genuine a priori mode of Cognition. In this way, ffom within the purview of reason itself, through the 'self-knowledge' of the understanding, a one-to-one re lation can be identified between the elements of Cognition, that is, between on the one hand the a priori, necessary concepts employed by the cognizing subject and, on the other, the pure forms of the empirical object which she cognizes. This one-to-one relation obtains if objects conform to a priori concepts, more precisely, if an isomor phic relation exists between the form of knowledge, which by définition is conceptu al, and the necessary form of objects of our experience (i.e., pure intuition). Only in this way can the claim to truth (as correspondence, adaequatio), with which meta physics is essentially concerned, be legitimated. The most important outcome of this thought-experiment is that thus a more har monious, indeed rational cohérence can be discerned between the various elements of Cognition ffom the perspective of a priori analysis, hence from within the 'self knowing' perspective of pure reason, precisely as metaphysics claims to be doing as regards a priori Cognition.3 It is exactly herein that we must locate Kant's Coperni which asserts that «a représentation com[es] to 'copy' some object outside it because of the causal 'impression' of that object», which could equally be empirical and non-empirical (ibidem). Notice, however, that by contrast Kant's hypothesis regarding the problem of a priori Cognition, which I explain below, is not simply the arche typal hypothesis, where the subject causally produces the object (cf. VT, AA vili 391 -1. Kant, Theoretical Phi losophy after 1781, p. 432 -, where Kant links the archetypal-ectypal distinction to Plato's recollection theory). 1 At B xvii ff. Kant speaks of a «rule [of the understanding] I have to presuppose in myself before any ob ject is given to me», and «which rule is expressed in concepts a priori, to which ali objects of experience must therefore necessarily conform, and with which they must agree.» (emphasis added) 2 Cf. KrV, A xiv: «I have to do merely with reason itself and its pure thinking; to gain exhaustive acquain tance with them I need not seek far beyond myself, because it is in myself that I encounter them». 3 Regarding the 'self-knowledge' of reason and the demand of systematìcity in metaphysics, which is at issue here, see M. Baum, Systemform und Selbsterkenntnis der Vernunft bei Kant, in System der Vernunft. Kant und der deutsche Idealismus, Bd. 1, Architektonik und System in der Philosophie Kants, eds. H.-F. Fulda, J. Stolzenberg, Hamburg, Meiner, pp. 25-40. Baum (p. 40) rightly points out that such self-knowledge involves a dérivation of the dementai fonctions of judging (and thus the catégories) frorn a principle. I address this issue in D. Schult - ing, Kant's Déduction From Apperception, forthcoming.</page><page sequence="24">62 DENNIS SCHULUNG canism. The resuit of the analysis of knowledge with a view to determining truth is inextricably bound up with the way the analysis is manifested in and by thought itself (hence my characterization 'self-explanation' or Kant's 'self-knowledge'). Put differ ently, the insight acquired regarding the relation between thought and object, i.e., truth as correspondence, is connected to the way the object must be considered con formable to how thought conceives it in accord with its own self-understanding, just as with Copernicus the hypothesis of earth rotation, more in general, the inversion ffom geocentrism to heliocentrism, yielded greater insight into planetary motion and moreover could clarify not a few irregularities in the existing astronomical models. The great similarity between Copernicus' revolution and Kant's lies uniquely in a sig nificant increase in rationality, understood in its root sense as proportion or relation, within the explanatory ffamework as a direct resuit of a change in perspective. For Copernicus, this meant that a more secure astronomy became possible, which was no longer vulnerable to ad hoc revisions. Kant's fundamental concern was the possi bility of a priori insight into the grounds of knowledge, indeed the possibility of ra tionality as such. In the closing section I briefly elaborate on the aspect of rationality in respect of Kant. The analogy between Kant's and Copernicus's way of reasoning therefore lies in the two-fold feature of hypothetico-deductive reasoning, which concerns 1. a pro posai to change the perspective or ffame of reference, which, when accepted, 2. leads to an increase in insight into a particular technical problem, that is, yields more ra tionality in terms of explaining pressing problems in a particular field of inquiry. The result 2 confìrms the propriety of the hypothesis 1 and justifies its acceptance. It is clear that, on this reading of the analogy, Kant's Copernicanism is not about a theo ry of perspectivism per se (perspectivism), nor merely a proposai for a paradigm shift (ah), for both readings entirely neglect to account for what appears important for Kant and Copernicus in equal measure: an increase in rationality in respect of solv ing a technical problem, which is expressed by 2. It is this methodical likeness that warrants Kant's analogy with Copernicus. 6. Conclusion: Rationality, A Priori Cognition, and Kant's Analogue of the Hypothetico-Deductive Method of Science By way of conclusion, I would like to bring to mind Kant's paradigmatic formula, in troduced in the B-preface of the Critique, which is often cited, but seldom understood. This is the earlier quoted thought «that we can cognize of things a priori only what we ourselves have put into them» (KrV, B xxm). This passage expresses the hypo thetico-deductive way of thinking underlying Kant's Copernicanism. What this means is that the structure of the analysis of the relation between thought and object (the question of truth) takes on a conditional form, whereby the acquired insight log ically implies a certain limitation.1 In other words, the modality of the argument re 1 This limitation is related to Kant's notorious distinction between appearance and thing in itself. In a note in the B-preface of the Critique (KrV, B xvni-xix), Kant suggests that the experiment of pure reason is con cerned with this distinction in order to demonstrate that the moral faith of the human being may kept up, while at the same time a thoroughgoing determinism can be maintained in the realm of material, phénomé nal nature. It is this distinction which Kant associâtes with the touchstone for the justification of transcendental</page><page sequence="25">KANT'S COPERNIC AN ANALOGY! BEYOND THE NON-SPECIFIC READING 63 garding truth concerns a conditional necessity, even though the conclusion of the ar gument is anything but hypothetical, that is, vulnerable to revision (cf. KrV, A xv, where Kant likens hypothèses to «forbidden commodity [verbotene Ware]»).1 This is af firmed by Kant's assertion that this attempt [Versuch] [i.e., the "altération in our way of thinking", D. S.] succeeds as well as we could wish, and it promises to metaphysics the secure course of a science [...]. For after this altération in our way of thinking we can very well explain the possibility of a Cognition a priori, and what is stili more, we can provide satisfactory [genugtuenden] proofs of the laws that are the a priori ground of nature [...] which were both impossible according to the earlier way of proceeding. (KrV, B xvni-xix, translation amended) The hypothesis or «attempt" of a reversai of procedure, of «our way of thinking», en ables us to give a satisfactory philosophical proof of the possibility of a priori Cogni tion, which was not possible before. However, that Kant's reasoning manifests an im plicit hypothetical structure does not in the least prevent the résultant proof itself, to be given in the body of the Critique (B xxii), to be stili a «déduction of our faculty [Ver mögen] of cognizing a priori» (B xix; emphasis added) and not, as is the case in the em pirical sciences, a démonstration merely based on induction (epagogic).2 This hypothetico-deductive or conditional form of reasoning was already ex pressed by the way in which Kant's thought-experiment, which we analyzed above, proceeded. I shall attempt to clarify this point somewhat more by having recourse to a dictum that Kant cites in a late essay, titled On a Recently Prominent Tone of Superior ity in Philosophy.3 This at first blush highly rhetorical essay is customarily ignored in the literature on Kant's theoretical philosophy. However, it contains some interesting allusions, which throw light on the centrai planks of Kant's theoretical thought. In idealism; this might appear to be a différent distinction than the distinction between two ways of considering the correspondence relation between thought and object, but this is only seemingly so. Kant's transcendental distinction between appearance and thing in itself is directly proportionate to this latter distinction. Put differently, Kant's idealism follows logically from the Copernican turn of the criticai position regarding truth. How the inner connection between these two distinctions must be characterized precisely is a matter for further study. 1 As Brigitte Falkenburg noted during discussion at the earlier mentioned Siegen Tagung, Kant must be taken to distinguish between the negative and positive senses of the notion of hypothesis. For Kant, as here in the A-preface, hypothesis usually has the connotation of mere probability or taking something to be true on subjective grounds, and can therefore never be a ground for apodictic certainty due to its mode of inference, which is to infer ffom the conséquences to their ground. See R 2687, AA xvi 471; cf. Log, AA ix 84-85 (I. Kant, Lectures on Logic, ed. and transi, by J. M. Young, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004, pp. 585-587); in terestingly, Kant points out here in the Jäsche logie that, in contrast to the majority of hypothèses in science, «[t]he Copernican system, on the other hand, is an hypothesis ffom which everything can be explained that ought to be explained therefrom» (AA 1x86; Lectures on Logic, pp. 586-587), which brings it close to being «apode ictically certain» (AA ix 85; Lectures on Logic, p. 586). Nevertheless, in the B-preface - when he makes the anal ogy with Copernicus and speaks of reason's analogue of experiment in science, which he associâtes with rea son's own «attempt», as he puts it (see below), to alter its way of thinking - Kant clearly values hypothesis positively insofar as it leads to an increase in rationality (cf. again B xxn). Although they are not grounds for apodictic certainty, hypothèses help us to get to the truth. As he puts it in a Reflexion (R 2675, AA xvi 463; 1. Kant, Notes and Fragments, p. 47), «[hjypotheses are indispensable. I. They are experiments of the understand ing. One must approach many a truth along the path of probability». 2 See again note 3 at p. 48, note 1 at p. 53 and note 2 at p. 77 above. I expand on the complex proof form of Kant's Déduction in D. Schulting, Kant's Déduction from Apperception, fortheoming. 3 This essay of Kant's was published in the Berlinische Monatsschrift of May 1796. See AA vm 387-406.</page><page sequence="26">64 DENNIS SCHULTING this respect, it is worthy of note that Kant there cites the scholastic dictum forma dat esse rei, which he accepts in principle. Kant reads this dictum such that «in the form lies the essence of the thing [Sache]1 insofar as this [i.e., the essence of the thing, D. S.] is to be known through reason».2 What does Kant mean here? What Kant has in mind can be rephrased as a conditional: If and only if the thinking self or the epistemic agent provides a certain form to that which it cognizes, viz., the thing or state of af fairs (res, the Sache), in accordance with the general principles of reason itself, then the thinking self is able to know something essentially about the thing (i.e., to know the esse of the res). In that case the thinking self knows the thing through reason, which for Kant means as much as necessarily and a priori (B 4), and hence apodictically (but not in a mathematical sense). The implication of this is that the form (forma) that the thinking self puts into, or gives to (dat), the thing (res), in conformity with the rules of reason, corresponds with the essence (esse) of the thing that is being cognized (by the thinking self). Thus, thought corresponds with the thing insofar asitis being cog nized. The form of thought is therefore the essence of the known thing. That is why Kant believes that reason détermines the form of what it knows with certainty and a priori, for it itself puts in the form, to which the known object must conform; this is in line with what Kant says in above-quoted passage at B xvm. Con sequently, we may claim that as thinkers, and mutatis mutandis as moral agents, we are our own authors of the conditions under which we know things or act according to maxims respectively. In the context of his practical philosophy, Kant asserts that we are subject to no law or cognitive constraint, which we have not legislated or pre scribed to ourselves.3 It is in this sense that, taken generally, reason is self-legitimat ing, and accordingly self-explanatory. That is to say, reason a priori puts a structure in to that which it perceives or posits, the object of thought (and mutatis mutandis the object of the moral will) in order to subsequently legitimize that structure as the nec essary form both of what is cognized, the thing as object, and the manner in which it is cognized. Kant thus demonstrates that a self-legitimating analysis, a 'self-knowledge' of sorts, is the kind of explanatory model for adequate and coherent philosophical Cognition, which may lay claim to being scientific in the same way that Copernicus' hypotheti cal construction by way of the postulate of earth rotation yielded a new, more co herent, standard in astronomy in terms of computing planetary motion. Therefore, Kant's allusion to Copernicus' «first thoughts» (KrV, B xvi) is not, as many interpreters of Kant claim or intimate, just a façon de parler concerning the introduction of a new paradigm. It rather indicates a systematic, substantial connection with Copernicus' scientific hypothetico-deductive methodology, which Kant considered paradigmatic for any science, and thus, mutatis mutandis, also for metaphysics. 1 Peter Heath's translation in the Cambridge édition gives 'matter' for Sache. However, almost always when, in conformity with its usage in the Schulphilosophie, Kant uses the term Sache he means the really existing thing, i.e., the thing qua its Being. Cf.

It is commonly thought that Kant makes the Copernican analogy solely in order to point out the fact as such of a paradigm shift in philosophy. This is too historical an inter prétation of the analogy. It leaves unexplained both Kant's and Copernicus' reasons for ad vancing their respective hypothèses, which brought about major changes in the conceptual schemes of philosophy and astronomy. My contention is that something much more specific, systematic is at issue, which contrary to received understanding makes Kant's analogy in fact particularly apt.</page></plain_text>
