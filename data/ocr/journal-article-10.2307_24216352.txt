<plain_text><page sequence="1">Elliot R. Wolfson NEGATIVE THEOLOGY AND POSITIVE ASSERTION IN THE EARLY KABBALAH In memory of Abraham Nuriel, who quietly understood the disquietude of the philosophical quest In this paper I shall explore a fundamental problem that challenges any theological system influenced by Neoplatonism, for one of the basic tenets of the latter is the insistence on the unknowability, indescribability, and ineffability of the One, the ultimate ground of all being. In the standard Neoplatonic ontology the One cannot be delimited in any way without undermining its status as the One, i.e., the absolute simple unity that comprehends within itself all being even though it itself is beyond being. Insofar as the One is unlimited all terms used in reference to it cannot be taken referentially. Such an assumption inevitably results in a via negativa or what Plotinus called apophasis (literally, speaking away) which entails, as Michael Sells put it, a "regress spiralling infinitely back away from saying anything."1 From the vantage point of historical Judaism it is evident that such extreme expressions of God,s inexpressibility and transcendence are due to the influence of Platonic thought both in the case of Philo of Alexandria and the later medieval Jewish philosophers, e.g., Isaac Israeli, Dunash ibn Tamim, Bahya ibn Paquda, Solomon ibn Gabirol, and Maimonides, to name a few of the better known proponents of a negative theology. Despite occasional examples to the contrary, the dominant tendency 1 Μ. Sells. "Apophasis in Plotinus: A Critical Approach."

Wolfson of the monotheistic orientation expressed in the biblical and rabbinic corpora has been to stress the positive attributions of God. As scholars have long noted, biblical thinking, and the rabbinic theology based thereon, posits a theisitc notion of God as a personality endowed with human characteristics and in some cases even capable of iconic manifestation. By contrast, the Plotinian conception of the One is that of an impersonal entity that is beyond being and predication. There would seem to be an essential incompatibility of the kataphatic bias of monotheism and the apophatic orientation of Neoplatonism. Indeed, to the extent that one translates the Neoplatonic One into modes of theological discourse, the apophatic tradition recedes to the background and is overshadowed by the kataphatic assumptions of theistic systems of belief.2 In this study I am primarily interested in exploring the problematic of negative theology versus positive assertion in select theosophic kabbalistic texts from the late-twelfth and thirteenth centuries originating in Provence and Northern Spain. To what extent is the philosophical principle of an unknowable and unnameable One tenable for these mystics? That such statements are made in this period by kabbalists influenced by Neoplatonism, e.g., Isaac the Blind of Provence and his disciples in Gerona, Ezra, Azriel, and Jacob ben Sheshet, as well as his nephew, Asher ben David, cannot be denied.3 One of the clearest expressions of the apophatic orientation is the following comment of Azriel on the statement of Pharaoh in Exod. 5:2. "And I did not know the Lord": "There is no comprehension of Him except through the negative way ('ein hassagato ki 'im 'al derekh 10'), i.e., the nothing and the absence that cannot be fathomed."4 Azriel thus transformed the obviously heretical statement attributed to Pharaoh in the Bible, 10' yada'ti 'etyhwh, "I did not know the Lord," into an affirmation of a profound mystical truth, "the way to know the Lord is through negation." That the formulation is based on technical philosophical terminology is The point is well expressed by Sells, ibid., pp. 49-50: "Rigorous apophasis is obscured when treated from an ambiguous apophatic perspective, when, for example, the Plotinian One is translated as 'God,' and that term is then used in a nonapophatic way. Formal or nonapophatic lenses result in a nonapophatic picture. A self-sustaining process of reversion to the normative sets in. Critical methods based upon nonapophatic premises render the rigorous apophatic tradition the more invisible." See G.

If it is without limit, then there is nothing outside it, and if it is exalted and hidden, then it is the essence of all that is hidden and revealed. Since it is hidden it is the root of faith and the root of rebelliousness... And the philosophers (hakhme ha-mehqar) admit to those who say that our comprehension [of Him] is only through the negative way ('ein hassagatenu ki 'im 'alderekh 10'), and the things that emanate from the Ein-Sof are the ten seflrot.5 In an interesting reversal of historical and textual infuence, Azriel claims that the philosophers are in accord with the kabbalists, while it is obviously the case that the kabbalists are influenced, at least in terms of this particular formulation, by philosophical concepts. Thus in another passage from the same work Azriel describes the Ein-Sof as "hidden, without end or limit, unfathomable, and there is nothing outside Him. The philosophers (hakhme mehqar) admit to this fact that the Cause of Causes (illat ha-'illot we-sibbat ha sibbot) is infinite, unfathomable, and without limit."6 The general approach here is consistent with Azriel's view, articulated explicitly in another composition, that there is perfect harmony between the philosophers and kabbalists, the only difference being one of nomenclature.7 Still, what is intriguing is the way that he reverses the influence such that it appears that the philosophers are in agreement with the kabbalists instead of the other way around, thereby leaving the impression that the Jewish mystical tradition should be accorded a privileged status as the primary expression of truth that is verified and validated by philosophy. In any event, it is evident that within the Proven9al-Geronese setting the Ein Sof is characterized negatively as that which cannot be comprehended or defined. It is the case, moreover, that in these sources not only is the Ein-Sof characterized in negative terms, but the first of the emanations, Keter, identified either as divine Thought or Will, was also described apophatically as 'Ayin, the Nothing, which thought cannot comprehend {mah she-'ein ha-mahshavah masseget).' Thus we find, as Gershom Scholem already noted, that even in the 5 Perush 'Eser Sefirot printed together with Meir ibn Gabbai, Derekh 'Emunah (Warsaw, 1890), la. 6 Ibid. 7 See Commentary on Talmudic Aggadoth by Rabbi Azriel of Gerona, ed.

Wolfson Sefer ha-Bahir, the collection of textual fragments and tradition-complexes redacted in twelfth-century Provence, the description of divine Thought as limitless and unfathomable likely reflects the Neoplatonic influence that would have been current in the immediate context of the book's final redaction.® Prima facie, it would seem that the ontic distinction between the Ein-Sof and the sefirot allows the kabbalists to adopt an apophatic and kataphatic orientation simultaneously, i.e., while the Infinite and the first of the sefirot lie entirely beyond the ken of human understanding, the other emanations constitute the positive attributes of the divine that are known through visual contemplation. If such a position were defensible then the antinomical problematic set by the title of this essay, negative theology and positive assertion in the early kabbalah, would be resolved. But can this dichotomization between deus absconditus and deus revelatus be upheld within the overall ontological framework adopted by the theosophic kabbalists predicated on the unbroken unity of the emanator and that which is emanated? Following the old adage that a picture is worth a thousand words, let me illustrate the point by mentioning a diagram that I came upon in a kabbaiistic manuscript depicting the relationship of Ein-Sof and the sefirot: the sefirotic powers, designated as circles, are alligned linearly in the form of a tree and atop the first of the sefirot, Keter, is a circle inscribed with the expression Ein-Sof. The circle is divided into two halves: the lower half that is contiguous with Keter is darkened and the upper half is white.10 The ontological implication of the diagram is clear: Ein Sof and the sefirot comprise one tree which indicates that there is no ontic separation of the two. Even though the point of contact between Ein-Sof and the sefirotic potencies lies beyond human comprehension — iconically represented by the fact that the lower half of the circle is black — the fact is that there is only one divine reality here. The point is underscored by the discursive passage explaining the diagram: The universal powers (ha-kohot ha-kelaliyot) in all reality are the ten sefirot belimah that are with God, blessed be He, for the number ten is glorious insofar as it is the beginning and end, i.e., the first of the tens and in Jewish Mysticism," in The Problem of Pure Consciousness: Mysticism and Philosophy, ed. R. K. C. Forman (Oxford, 1990), pp. 121-159. Origins, pp. 126-127. It must be noted, however, that Scholem's attempt to distinguish two possible sources for the bahiric notion of the hidden and limitless Thought as Gnosticism or Neoplatonism is no longer tenable given current research on the common intellectual bonds of these two Hellenistic currents. See the essays collected in Neoplatonism and Gnosticism, ed. R. T. Wallis (Albany, 1992), especially C. L. Hancock, "Negative Theology in Gnosticism and Neoplatonism, pp. 167-186. MS Vatican 441, fol. 111b.</page><page sequence="5">Negative Theology and Positive Assertion IX the last of the ones. Thus they ascribed to God, blessed be He, His powers that are united ('aduqot) to Him, for He is the first and He is the last without any end, and so His beginningness has no beginning. This division is not from the aspect of His essence, blessed be He, but rather from the aspect of those who receive. Thus they attributed to Him, blessed be He, sefirot according to the actions and also the middot. You know that the author of Sefer Yesirah said, "Ten that have no end/' and also "their end is fixed in their beginning," and he also said, sefirot belimah, without substance (beli mahut), i.e., without being corporealized (beli mugshamot).11 The ten potencies are said to be within God or to be united to Him in a unity that is only rendered multiple from the vantage point of those that receive the divine efflux. If that is the case, then, it follows logically that one cannot really posit a kataphatic theology with respect to the deus revelatus (the sefirot) and an apophatic theology with respect to the deus absconditus (Ein-Sof). That is, the logical implications of the emanative scheme — which represents the theoretical expression of the myth of divine autogenesis — necessitates the further presumption that ontically the different circles are part of one reality. Consider, for example, the following passage in an anonymous commentary on the ten sefirot that was written in all likelihood in Castile sometime in the last decades of the thirteenth century, but which conceptually and terminologically reflects earlier Geronese traditions: At the beginning of everything He was the first and that which proceeds everything, and He is hidden from everything, and He is called the Cause of Causes. With regard to Him one cannot say something or nothing (we 'ein 10'mar 'alav 10' yesh we-lo' 'ayin) for He is hidden from the angels and how much more so from us. Concerning Him it says, "do not seek out that which is hidden from you." We know that everything is comprised in Him, and with respect to Him nothing is new... It arose in His Thought to bring forth and to emanate the ten sefirot, but He, blessed be He, has no change of will or desire. The philosophers call Him that which thought cannot comprehend, and some of them call Him the Active Intellect (sekhel ha-po'el) for everything is from Him.12 On the one hand, the author of this text clearly adopts an apophatic position by stressing the concealed nature of the Infinite as well as the fact that all predication (negative or positive) is inappropriate in relation to it. I note in passing that the statement, "With regard to Him one cannot say something or nothing" (we-'ein 10'mar 'alavlo' yesh we-lo' 'ayiri), echoes a passage in Plotinus 11 Ibid., fols. lllb-112a. 12 The text was published by Scholem in Madda'e ha-Yahadut 2 (1927): 68.</page><page sequence="6">Elliot R. Wolfson concerning the unlimited: "The one who sees it cannot say 'in this way' or again 'not in this way'."13 On the other hand, the author asserts that everything is contained in the Infinite — referred to by the technical philosophical ternisekhel ha-po'el, the Active Intellect, which here represents the first rather than the tenth of the separate intellects14 — such that the emanation of the sefirot does not constitute a change in the divine will. To carry the logic of this position to its conclusion: if one asserts that everything is comprised within the Infinite, then one cannot attribute to the latter absolute incomprehensibility and ineffability. It may be suggested, as Plotinus himself does in the continuation of the aforecited passage, that even though all is contained in the One, and indeed all being is a projection of the One outside itself, the unlimited still remains greater than anything predicated of it. In Plotinus' own language: "But, since you see it as without definition, you will be able to speak of all the things which come after it, but you will affirm that it is none of these, but, if anything at all, that it is all power, really master of itself, being what it wills to be."15 This phenomenon is aptly labeled by Sells disontology for underlying the "ontological self-mastery" (αυτής όντως κυρίαν) of which Plotinus speaks is the claim that the One transcends all attempts at reification implied by acts of predication and reference including that of being.16 Echoing this Plotinian notion Azriel of Gerona states that the "One is the foundation of the many; but He is more than them."17 In another composition Azriel reiterates this idea in slightly different terminology wherein he says of the Creator that "He exceeds everything (yeter min ha-kol) for nothing proceeded Him. He brought forth something from nothing and He is equal to everything (,shaveh la-kof) for nothing is outside Him, not with respect to something or nothing."18 Scholem already related Azriel's terminology to the concept of Enneads 6.8.9. 40. The identification of the Ein-Sof as the Active Intellect is noteworthy. Even if we are to assume that in this case the Active Intellect is the first rather than the last of the intellects, it is nevertheless unusual for the Ein-Sof itself to be described in this way. In this connection it is of interest to consider another apparently early kabbalistic text, entitled in one manuscript as Perush ha-Yihudmi-PerushSitreha-Torahba-Qabbalah 'alderekh ha-'emet ("The Commentary on Unity from the Explication of the Mysteries of Torah according to the True Tradition"), wherein God is described as the intellect that is hidden from everything.

It seems to me that in this case that which is projected by the One outside itself is ontically identical to the unlimited One. To say that the Ein-Sof is χ is to delimit it by marking χ off from not-x, but the kabbalists who presume that the sefirot are God's essence are precisely delimiting the unlimited. At the end of the thirteenth century and the beginning of the fourteenth we find a theoretical debate in kabbalistic literature regarding the nature of the sefirot as either essential or instrumental.20 Although this terminology is based on earlier sources, it is evident that when the image of instruments (kelim) is used by kabbalists such as Asher ben David and Ezra of Gerona to describe the sefirot, the philosophical assumption is that these hypostatic gradations are to be viewed as the divine essence. Herein lies the core paradox of theosophic kabbalah as it evolved in the Provengal-Geronese writings: the sefirot are the delimited predication of the unlimited. Already in Sefer Ye fir ah a paradoxical turn of phrase is used to describe the sefirot: middatan Sefer she-'ein lahen sof, i.e., "their measure is ten without limit." When the term sefirot is interpreted theosophically, the paradoxical nature of this statement is brought into sharp relief: the ten sefirot are the limited powers that express God's unlimited force, they are at once finite and infinite. The full dialectical implication of the kabbalistic perspective is articulated by Azriel: "I have already informed you that the Ein-Sof is perfection without deficiency, and He has a finite power that is unlimited (koah bi-gevul mi-beli gevuf), and the limitation emanating from Him that delimits all existent beings is the sefirot, which have the power to act in perfection and imperfection."21 To put the matter in somewhat different terms: one may conceptually distinguish Ein-Sof and the sefirot, but in the moment of religious experience they are inseparable. The point is underscored in an image from Sefer Yesirah used frequently by kabbalists themselves to describe the relation of the Ein-Sof and the sefirot: "like a flame bound to the coal."22 In the mind's eye one can differentiate the flame and the Ibid., p. 207, η. 11; and in more detail in Origins, pp. 423-425. See discussion in M. Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives (New Haven and London, 1988), pp. 136-144. Perush 'Eser Sefirot, 2d. This expression is used precisely in the way that I have suggested in a passage in Ms Oxford Bodleian 2239, fol. 90b: "The one who enters this orchard must understand that the ten sefirot are one unity, and they are the essence of divinity ('efem ha-'elohut), for they are in the Ein-Sof,</page><page sequence="8">XII Elliot R. Wolfson coal, but in the experiential moment of burning it is not possible to separate the two. Given the ontic identity of Ein-Sof and the sefirot, is it really possible to maintain an apophatic theology predicated on the radical inexpressibility or unknowability of God? Is it not rather the case that the theosophic kabbalists in an essential manner affirm the knowability and effability of God? Is not the positive assertion about the divine nature what constitutes the very essence of their kabbalah, i.e., an esoteric tradition that posits secret knowledge of God that is expressed through mythological as well as philosophical modes of discourse? Indeed, what distinguishes the theosophic kabbalists in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries from other practioners of Judaism, including most importantly talmudists and philosophers, is that they claim to possess, either through oral transmission or supernatural revelation, this gnosis about God (or in the case of Azriel the proper means of discourse to express that gnosis that is shared as well by the philosophers). Central to the theosophic kabbalah is the belief that the esoteric knowledge of God involved a kind of illumination; this is the force of the term maskilim used by the kabbalists to refer to themselves, i.e., they visually contemplate the inner workings and structures of the divine. God is not known in some abstract, theoretical way, but He is experienced in a prophet like visualization attained primarily through prayer and Torah-study. If that is the case, then again we must pose the question: what is the role accorded negative theology in a religious worldview dominated by positive assertion? In a recently published essay Steven Katz sets out to demonstrate some logical and theological shortcomings in the classical Neoplatonic apophatic claim by citing a variety of examples from philosophical and mystical literature that predicate positive qualities to God despite the formal acceptance of a negative theology. Most relevant to my analysis is Katz's observation regarding the "ontological implications of an emanationist metaphysics, i.e., that cause and effect are in some primal and definitive sense the same/'23 When this is applied to the relation of the One, what the kabbalists call the Cause of Causes or the Infinite, to the hypostases that emanate from the One, the sefirot, it becomes obvious that one cannot totally separate the negative One, the source of all being, and the positive attributes of God. By the logic of its own ontology the blessed be He, like a flame bound to the coal, and He is in the form of a soul in a human body. 'From my flesh I will see God' (Job 19:26), and there is no separation there." Regarding this important codex of kabbalistic material, and its relationship to Joseph Harms, see I.

Goodman (Albany, 1992), p. 290.</page><page sequence="9">Negative Theology and Positive Assertion XIII Neoplatonized theosophy articulated by the kabbalists necessitates that the utter negation associated with the Ein-Sof be somewhat qualified. As Katz puts it: "Plotinian emanation implicates the One cataphatically as a consequence of its ontological choreography."24 It may be possible to respond to Katz's challenge in the Neoplatonic sources wherein the dialectic position of the radical apophasis implies that the One is all things but no one thing. However, it is clear, as Katz himself goes on to assert, that his observation applies to the kabbalists who formulated their theosophies in light of a Neoplatonic ontology. That is, inasmuch as the kabbalists consider the seflrotic potencies to represent the manifestation of the infinite power of the Godhead, symbolized by the identification of the sefirot as the Tetragrammaton, it follows that it cannot be said that the Ein-Sof is not that which overflows from it or projects out of it. Some kabbalists in the late-thirteenth and early-fourteenth centuries, e.g., David ben Yehudah he-Hasid and Joseph ben Shalom Ashkenazi, used an expression similar to the one invoked by Katz to characterize the relation of the Ein-Sof and Keter. "there is no difference between the cause and that which is caused except that one is the cause and the other caused."25 The point of this pithy observation is that, while the cause is logically primary to and hence distinguishable from the effect, ontically they are one and the same. With respect to this issue too one may assume that the kabbalists formulate their views on the basis of philosophical texts. Indeed, this very principle regarding the essential unity of cause and effect is articulated in the classical Neoplatonic tradition as we find, for example, in the Liber de Causis, the medieval summary of Proclus Elements of Theology. "And indeed, the First Cause is signified only by the second cause, which is Intelligence; and it is called by the name of its first effect but only in a higher and better manner, because what belongs to the effect also belongs to the cause, although in a more sublime, better, and more noble manner."26 A second passage from this work is also relevant in this context: "Therefore, the effect is in the cause after the mode of the cause, and the cause is in the effect after the mode of the effect."27 Although the kabbalists that I mentioned above specifically apply this principle to the relationship between Ein-Sof and Keter, which presents a perfect parallel to the first statement from the Liber de Causis, I do not think one would be committing a logical flaw by extending it to all the sefirot, for if the kabbalists wish to maintain the ontic unity Ibid.

Wolfson of all ten potencies, a point that is emphasized time and again in kabbalistic literature, then it follows that what applies to Ein-Sof and Keter applies to Ein Sof and all the sefirot. Logically, the Ein-Sof as cause can be distinguished from the sefirot which are the effect, but ontically they are one and the same. A passage in Isaac the Blind's commentary on Sefer Yesirah alludes to this point. Commenting on the description of the measure of the sefirot being ten, middatan 'eser, Isaac writes: "Every thing (or word, davar) is a measure (middah) and that which is above it is its fullness, for the measure is the potency that emanates from the measure that metes out the essences (middah ha-moded hawwayot), the measure and emanation of the essence within the Infinite (middah wa-'asilut hawwayah be-'ein sof.)"1* The sefirot, therefore, represent the measure of the essence that is comprised within the Infinite; there is no ontic fissure separating the Infinite and the sefirot for the latter are the measure of the essence (hawwayot) that are within the Infinite. The cause is in the effect as the effect is in the cause. The continuity of the ontic chain is explicitly affirmed by Isaac in the following observation: "Each and every cause receives from the cause above it, for the measure draws from that which is hewn, and that which is hewn from the engraved, and that which is engraved from the inscribed, and that which is inscribed from that which is hidden. Everything is one within the other."29 If there are no breaks in the chain of being, then it follows that the first link of that chain, the hidden and unlimited Infinite, can be known from the subsequent links that comprise the sefirotic realms in its various levels. Going beyond Katz I would say that the mythologization of the Neoplatonic emanative scheme in theosophic kabbalah renders it even more difficult to detach the Infinite from any predication. It is commonly held by scholars of kabbalah based on some explicit claims of the kabbalists that the Ein-Sof is beyond all predication and therefore depersonalized. In several studies I have argued, however, that the portrayal of the Ein-Sof is much more mythical in kabbalistic sources; the personalized depiction of the Ein-Sof even involves the attribution of gender at the highest level of the Godhead. While the explicit language might suggest otherwise, the sexualized mythos in kabbalistic theosophy extends to the Infinite itself.30 Thus, I have suggested that the Ha-Qabbalah be-Provans (Jerusalem, 1970), p. 4 (Appendix). Fora different rendering of this passage, see Scholem, Origins, p. 285. It is clear, as Scholem himself admits, that he did not comprehend the meaning of this difficult text. Ibid., p. 5. See E. R.

My understanding is predicated, therefore, on a conception of Ein-Sof as a personalized entity to whom specific gender characteristics may be attributed. The explicit formulation of this mythical depiction reaches a high pitch in late thirteenth-century Castilian kabbalah, especially the zoharic circle, but it is already implicit in the earlier sources in a relatively muted and more philosophical form. It is in order here to recall as well the view of Moshe Idel who notes the affinity between Neoplatonism and early kabbalah by discussing several key motifs employed to describe the process of emanation of the upper sefirot, especially in the writings of Azriel of Gerona and Jacob ben Sheshet.31 On the other hand, Idel is more critical of the view, expressed by Scholem, concerning the affinity of Neoplatonic negative theology and the kabbalistic conception of the Ein-Sof. By contrast, Idel emphasizes the "more positive conceptions of the kabbalistic Infinite — the anthropomorphical rather than the philosophical-theological concepts connected to the Eyn-Sof."32 Idel thus sets up an esoteric/exoteric dichotomy: the more philosophically oriented expressions of a Neoplatonic negative theology represent the exoteric theory, whereas the anthropomorphic description of the Infinite is the more esoteric. The notion of a positive Infinite, configured in the form of an anthropos, is treated more elaborately in several other studies by Idel wherein he traces this motif both backwards to earlier Jewish mythologoumena expressed in Gnostic sources from the second and third centuries and forwards in the complicated theosophic myth of Lurianic kabbalah formulated in the sixteenth century.33 Indeed, a careful scrutiny of the usage of the term Ein-Sof in the Provencal and Geronese material indicates that we are not talking about a formless, indeterminate, and unlimited Infinite that eludes all predication. Firstly, it should be recalled, as Scholem himself emphasized, that conceptually the term Ein-Sof as used by Isaac the Blind and his disciples reflects the transition from Transmissions et passage en judaisme, ed. E. Benbassa (Paris, 1994) and in an extended English version in a collection of my articles, Along the Path: Studies in Kabbalistic Myth, Symbolism, and Hermeneutics (forthcoming). 31 M.

Wolfson adverbial expressions like 'adle-'ein sof, infinitely, to the nominative sense, Ein Sof, the Infinite. Yet, as Scholem reminds us, in the earliest material the ambiguity of the adverbial and nominative cases is preserved such that one cannot really speak of an Infinite with a definite article, ha-'ein-sof, implying thereby that the Infinite is ontically (reflecting the grammatical syntax) set apart.34 While it is the case that in this material one confronts an hypostasized Ein-Sof, the adverbial connotation forces us to consider the dynamic relation of the Infinite and that which emanates from it, especially the first of the sefirot but in a sense all of them inasmuch as they constitute one unity. Kabbalistic ontology prevents the reification of the Ein-Sof as a distinct subject. Hence, it is impossible to separate the Ein-Sof and the sefirot in such a way that negative theology is appropriate for the former and positive attribution for the latter. The logic of the ontological presumption leads one to reject this manner of treating the problem at hand. Let us consider, for example, the opening remark of Isaac the Blind in his commentary on Sefer Yesirah, reflecting on why that text begins with the letter bet, the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet: "The bet alludes to Wisdom (Hokhmah) and intelligere {haskel), and it alludes to all that Thought comprehends to the Infinite and all the more so what is contained within itself."35 The key expression, kol mah she-hassagat ha-mahshavah masseget 'ad 'ein sof, "all that Thought comprehends to the Infinite/' is what I would like to examine in detail. According to this text, there is no break in the chain connecting Ein-Sof and Thought, the Infinite and the first gradation. On the contrary, the intrinsic unity of the two is underscored by the fact that Thought comprehends up to the Infinite, i.e., the first emanation extends infinitely such that there is no ontic gap separating cause and effect. In the same way that in Plotinus the Nous is realized when it gazes beyond itself to the One — the self contemplation of Nous is in reality contemplation of the One — so in Isaac's theosophical scheme Thought is actualized when it contemplates the Ein-Sof beyond thought. Isaac links this theme to the expression in Sefer Yesirah, the "depth of the beginning," 'omeq reshit: "The depth ('omeq) refers to that which intellectualizes to the Infinite (ha-haskel 'ad 'ein sof). The beginning (reshit) refers to the emanation of the power of the depth, which is Wisdom, and the depth is from the Infinite {ha-'omeq me-ein sof): everything is one {we-ha-kol 'ehad)... The depth is the end of the comprehension of Thought to the Infinite {sof hassagat mahshavah le-'ein sof)."36 34 Origins, pp. 266-269. 35 Ha-Qabbalah be-Provans, p. 1 (Appendix). 36 Ibid., p. 4 (Appendix).</page><page sequence="13">Negative Theology and Positive Assertion XVII The dynamic relationship of the Infinite and the first emanation is made as well in the following statement of Isaac's disciple, Jacob ben Sheshet, commenting on the first word of Scripture, bereshit, "In the beginning": Every enlightened person and sage knows that it is impossible for a small or large thing to be in actuality until it was first in potentiality, and that potentiality has to have a subject. It is explained here that the first emanated entity, which emanated from the hidden Cause, was the subject of the potentiality of all the other things, and it is a very subtle essence from which the straight line proceeds and spreads out. [Scripture] was silent about mentioning the beginning of the existence of that which emanated, and it began from the potentiality that is in it for that is the limit of what we can comprehend. From it and above thought is forbidden... This matter we call that which thought cannot comprehend until the Infinite (mah she-'ein ha-mahshavah masseget 'ad ein sof)." There is no ontic breach separating the Infinite and the first emanation. Jacob ben Sheshet conveys this by the dense expression mah she-'ein ha-mahshavah masseget 'ad 'ein sof, that which thought cannot comprehend to the Infinite. In another one of his works he expresses the same idea in more succinct language. Commenting on the letters of the word 'ayin, nothing, he writes: The 'alef alludes to the will to the Infinite (rason 'ad 'ein sof), and from it is the power of arousal {koah ha-mit'orer). The yod alludes to the wisdom to discern good and evil, and from it is the power of thought {koah ha mahshavah). And the straight nun is the emanation of things from Wisdom, and it is called Faith ('emunah).3' The critical point for this analysis is the description of the 'alef as alluding to the Will that extends to the Infinite. The latter cannot be ontically (or terminologically) differentiated from the former. For his part Isaac illustrates the dialectical identity of Ein-Sof and Keter through several images that relate the idea of returning to the source or root of something by way of some intermediary means. The implication is that divine Thought extends into the Infinite and thereby returns to its source. What, then, is one to do with Isaac's explanation that the hidden subject of the verb haqaq, engrave, in Sefer Ye sir ah, signifies that which Thought cannot comprehend, mah she-'ein ha-mahshavah masseget? Scholem remarked that this phrase appeared like a rendering of the Greek term akatalepton or its Latin equivalent incomprehensibilis, used in Neoplatonic contexts to designate the 37 Sefer Meshiv Devarim Nekhohim, ed. G. Vajda (Jerusalem, 1968), pp. 113-114. 38 Kitve Ramban, ed. C. Chavel (Jerusalem, 1968), 2:385-386. 39 Origins, p. 270.</page><page sequence="14">XVIII Elliot R. Wolfson One.39 If we accept this interpretation it would follow that the intent of Isaac's statement is that the Infinite is that which divine Thought cannot comprehend. That reading, however, is very problematic in light of the other passage that I have discussed wherein it is stated emphatically that divine Thought comprehends that which is within itself and that which is within the Infinite. Perhaps, then, one should opt for the second explanation offered by Scholem that the expression, "that which thought cannot comprehend," refers to the divine Thought itself which cannot be comprehended by human thought. But even this explanation is problematic in light of the continuation of Isaac's text wherein he distinguishes between the subtle essences that have no boundary (hawwayot daqot she-'ein lahem gevul) and the essences that are fixed and engraved (hawwayot ha-qevu'ot ha-haquqot) within Wisdom, the second gradation. The latter, also referred to as the wondrous paths {netivot ha-peli'ot) specified by Sefer Yesirah, are described as burrows within the core of the tree (mehilot be-tokh 'iqqar ha-'illan) of which Wisdom is the root. "No human creatures," writes Isaac, "can comprehend except one that suckles (yoneq) from it, for the way of contemplation (derekh hitbonenut) is by way of suckling (derekh yeniqah) and not by way of knowledge (derekh yedi'ah)."40 According to this text the essences are within Thought, whereas in another text mentioned above they were described as being within the Ein-Sof. There is no contradiction here, but rather a deliberate ambivalence with respect to the ontological grading of Ein-Sof and Thought. The transition from the one to the other involves no traversing of ontic boundaries for Thought extends to the Infinite. It follows from these passages that Isaac did maintain the possibility of an intuitive comprehension of the subtle essences comprised within the Ein-Sof or the first emanation which he designates as a kind of suckling, yeniqah, a term used with the obvious intent of emphasizing the immediacy and intimacy that characterize mystical contemplation. If one can have this kind of intimate knowledge of the subtle essences, as opposed to a discursive knowledge {derekhyedi'ah), it follows that one can extend one's thought up to the Infinite just as divine Thought itself is so extended. Thus, in one of the most difficult passages in Isaac's commentary he notes: "We discern from the power of the allusion of Thought [mi-koah remez mahshavah, i.e., from that at which Thought can hint] what we can comprehend and what we must leave, because, from that point on, there is no comprehension of the allusive Thought (hassagat remez ha-mahshavah). For the created being does not have the power to comprehend the interiority of the allusive Thought to comprehend the Infinite (hassagat penimiyut remez ha-mahshavah le-hasig be 40 Ha-Qabbalah be-Provans, p. 1 (Appendix).</page><page sequence="15">Negative Theology and Positive Assertion XIX 'ein sof)."41 It would seem from this text that Isaac categorically denies the possibility of knowledge of the Ein-Sof identified as the interiority of the allusive Thought. Yet, the text continues with the following comment: "All contemplation {hitbonenut) of Wisdom is from the intelligere (haskel) which is the subtlety of the allusion of His Thought in the Infinite (daqut remez mahshavto be-'ein sof). Therefore it says [in Sefer Yesirah concerning the ten sefirot] 'ten and not nine', for thought does not comprehend and does not give a measure above Wisdom or in Wisdom except by means of contemplation {hitbonenut)."42 The possibilty of mystical contemplation allows one to gain access to what is above Wisdom, viz., Thought which itself is characterized by the infinite potencies or the subtle essences. This is affirmed explicitly by Isaac: Since there is no end to the cause of the thought of the beginning of speech ('ein sof le-sibbat mahshevet tehilat ha-dibbur) how can it [Thought] be placed as a sefirahl Do not say that they are eleven or nine. Even though speech is in the Infinite (ha-dibbur be-'ein-sof) there is nonetheless a subtle cause (sibbah daqah) or subtle essence (hawwayah daqah) which Thought comprehends in contemplation of an allusion of it (ha-mahshavah masseget bah be-hitbonenut remez mimenah). Therefore there is a sefirah in Thought which is a subtle essence in which there are ten (hawwayah daqah she-bah 'eser). The words (devarim) have measurements and a dimension but Thought has no limit. Thus they go ten in ten. Therefore from the subtle ones are those that are inscribed, for there are ten from ten, the subtle ones from the inwardly subtle ones (ki 'eser me-'eser, daqot mi penimiyot ha-daqot).43 The upshot of this complex passage is that Isaac maintains the possibility of one's contemplation of the ten essences in divine Thought which are the paradigms for the ten lower sefirot. The lower emanations are said to have a measure and limit whereas Thought is limitless. Yet, Thought is also described as comprising within itself the ten subtle essences that together constitute the configuration of the Godhead. These ten essences mark the transition from the Infinite to the finite, from the unlimited to that which is limited. Having granted the possibility of contemplation of these ten essences within Thought, and assuming further that the Infinite cannot be separated from the first emanation, it is not possible to deny all positive knowledge of the Infinite. The latter is contemplated through divine Thought by means of a mystical intuition that is described in terms of the metaphor of yeniqah. 41 Ibid., p. 3 (Appendix). The translation is my own but I have been assisted by Scholem's rendering in Origins, p. 275. 42 Ha-Qabbalah be-Provans, p. 3 (Appendix). 43 Ibid.</page><page sequence="16">XX Elliot R. Wolfson It must be concluded, therefore, that the rigorously apophatic notion of the unlimited One is not indicative of the complex mystical theosophy regarding the Infinite as put forth by Isaac or his disciples. Given the ontological unity of the Ein-Sof and the sefirot, it must follow logically that positive attribution in the case of the latter affects the former. Without a framework of ontological dualism how can one maintain an ontic distinction such that apophasis applies to the Ein-Sof and kataphasis to the sefirot? The monistic and even panentheistic orientation of theosophic kabbalah as it developed in Provence and Northern Spain, largely due to Neoplatonic influences, precludes any such bifurcation. In the final analysis, according to these kabbalists, discursive reason gives way to an intuitive contemplation that breaks open into the Infinite. The challenge of positive assertion over against the via negativa is enhanced as well by the mythic characterization of the Ein-Sof that is predicated on the attribution of personal and anthropomorphic attributes to the Infinite. The view that I have put forth strengthens and is strengthened by Idel's thesis that a more recondite treatment of the Infinite in the early theosophic kabbalah indicates the essential difference between the Neoplatonic and kabbalistic approaches: the Ein-Sof is comprised of ten subtle essences that are configured as an anthropomorphic shape above the ten lower sefirot that constitute an independent anthropos. There is no dualism between the hidden Ein-Sof and the personal Demiurge of Scripture or any attempt to transform the impersonal Ein-Sof into the personal God of the Bible.44 These formulations are inappropriate for the early kabbalistic texts. The issue rather is the move from one anthropomorphic configuration to another; speculation about the first was treated as one of the most recondite aspects of the kabbalistic tradition for it imputed an anthropomorphic and gendered image to the Infinite. The full force of the theosophic myth precluded any theological attempt to remove anthropomorphic imagery from the Godhead. One final note. The significant challenge to negative theology that I have underscored in the kabbalistic sources is evident as well in the notion of mystical intention (kawwanah) in prayer put forth by Isaac and some of his disciples. In the earliest kabbalistic fragments there was a debate between those who maintained the possibility of intention in prayer reaching the Infinite and those who argued that it reaches a lower ontic level. It is evident from the following passage that Isaac affirmed the former position against traditions attributed to his father in manuscript45: 44 See Scholem, Major Trends, p. 12. For a formulation on the relationship of the Ein-Sof and the sefirot that is closer to the position that I have taken in this study, see G. Scholem. On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism, trans. R. Manheim (New York, 1965), p. 35. 45 See Origins, pp. 209-210.</page><page sequence="17">Negative Theology and Positive Assertion XXI Therefore the potencies {middot)arose, for language can comprehend only that which comes out from Him,46 since a man cannot comprehend the potency of the [divine] speech and the letters (middat ha-dibbur we-ha 'otiyyot) but only the potency [of language] itself (middatah be-'asmah). There is no potency outside the letters. All the sublime potencies are given to be meditated upon (le-hitbonen), for each potency receives from the potency above it, and they are given to Israel, to contemplate from the attribute seen in the heart, to contemplate to the Infinite, for there is no way to pray except by means of the entities that are limited (devarim ha mugbalim) a person is received and ascends in Thought to the Infinite ('adam mitqabbel u-mit'aleh ba-mahshavah 'ad 'ein sof).47 There can be no question that in this text Isaac explicitly affirms the possibility of one contemplating to the Infinite through the intermediary of the sefirot. R. Ezra extends the scope of Isaac's mystical teaching and reinterprets the basic precept in Judaism in light of it: the duty to unify God is understood in terms of the need "to unite Him in the ten sefirot in the Infinite."48 The task of unifying the ten sefirotic potencies in the Infinite is not only the lofty goal of mystical contemplation, but it is the religious obligation of all Jews. This again underscores the fact that the ontological presumption of the Geronese kabbalists precludes the possiblity of separating Ein-Sof from the sefirot. Even Azriel who lowers the locus of mystical contemplation through prayer to the second sefirah so that the goal is to unite human thought with divine Thought, and who explicitly warns against rising beyond the level of Thought, is forced by his own ontological assumptions to undermine this position. That is, inasmuch as Thought is intrinsically related to that which is above it, Keter, and the latter to the Infinite, it follows that one cannot be united with Thought without ipsofacto rising to the higher grades of being, even to the Infinite. Hence, in one of his works Azriel embraces the full dialectical and paradoxical nature of the Ein-Sof in terms that Johann Reuchlin already compared to the doctrine of the coincidentia oppositorum of Nicholas Cusanus: If someone were to ask you, 'Is there something outside Him?' Respond to him, 'There is nothing outside Him.' If he asks you, 'How does He bring forth something out of nothing when there is a great difference between something and nothing?' Respond to him, '1 have already informed you On this difficult phrase, see the extensive discussion in Scholem, "The Concept of Kavvanah in the Early Kabbalah," in Studies in Jewish Thought: An Anthology of German Jewish Scholarship (Detroit, 1981), pp. 175-176, n. 13. Ha-Qabbalah be-Provans, pp. 5-6. Cf. Scholem, "The Concept of Kavvanah," pp. 165-166; idem Origins, pp. 300-301. Kitve Ramban, 2:521.</page><page sequence="18">XXII Elliot R. Wolfson that the One who brings forth something out of nothing is not deficient, for the something is in the nothing in the aspect of the nothing and the nothing is in the something in the aspect of something. Thus they said, He made His nothing into something, and they did not say, He made something from nothing, in order to teach that the nothing is something and the something nothing.49 The coincidentia oppositorum supports the contention that the theosophic kabbalists inevitably slip into positive predication of the Godhead even when they attempt to portray the Ein-Sof in negative terms. From both a logical and mythical perspective the negative depictions of the Ein-Sof in kabbalistic literature are challenged by a more positive portrayal. The apophatic orientation gives way to a kataphatic theological posture. In the final analysis, the theosophic kabbalist is prepared to live in the paradoxical situation wherein the unlimited is limited by the force that renders the limited unlimited. It is this paradox that opens the Infinite in the heart of the mystic in the moment of visual contemplation through prayer or Torah-study. That opening, in turn, floods the mystic's heart with knowledge of the Godhead. 49 "Seridim Hadashim," p. 207. Cf. Azriel's statement in his commentary on Sefer Yefirah 1:5, in Kitve Ramban, 2:454: "Therefore these attributes were made, in order to contemplate through them to the Infinite."</page></plain_text>
