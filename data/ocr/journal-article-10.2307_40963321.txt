Previous scholarship on antinomian Sufism has tended to focus on earlier centuries and on Persian- and Turkish-speaking groups. Evidence suggests that there is also a history to be written of anti- nomian mystical groups in the Arabic-speaking world in later centuries. On the eve of modernity in the Arabic-speaking Middle East, groups and individuals existed who rejected or ignored the prevalent scholarly interpretation of Islam and challenged the authority of the class of religious scholars (culamd *). A number of sources from the period, usually hostile and/or satirical, attest to the existence of such groups and allow us to reconstruct the overall contours of their outlook. Laconic, dismissive and hostile accounts by self-styled upholders of orthodoxy are not ideal sources for uncovering the views of "heretics" (zanddiqa) in the Islamic world. Nevertheless, they are often all that is available to modern histor- ians. In what follows, I will discuss a number of sources from the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries that discuss contemporary "heretics" in the Arabic-Islamic world. These include an account of a trial and execution in Damascus in 1610, a number of polemics by Islamic religious scholars from Egypt and Syria, and a satirical work from late-seventeenth-century Egypt. Together, they give at least some information on individuals and movements deemed heretical from the perspective of Islamic religious scholars (culamd '). This information suggests that the accusation of "heresy" (zandaqa or ilhdd) tended primarily to be made against certain Sufi groups, at least in Syria and Egypt in the period from the mid-sixteenth to the mid-eighteenth centuries. This is not of course to say that the terms zandaqa and ilhdd came to be seman- tically restricted to heterodox Sufism.1 However, from around 1550 to 1750, the * The present article was written while I was a recipient of an Andrew W.

These groups have not yet received sustained scholarly attention. The few available studies of anti- nomian or "deviant" Sufism tend to focus on earlier centuries and on Turkish- and Persian-speaking groups. Yet there is abundant evidence suggesting that there is also a history to be written about "deviant" Sufism in the Arabic-speak- ing world in the early modern period. The present paper is a preliminary discus- sion of some of this evidence. I In late January 1610, a man named Yahya ibn cIsa from the province of Karak (in what is today Jordan) appeared in Damascus. Within a few days - on 2 February - he was executed as a heretic (zindiq) in the presence of the Chief Judge of Damascus and some of the leading religious scholars of the city. The prominent Damascene scholar Najm al-DIn al-GhazzT (d. 1651), who played a prominent role in the trial and condemnation, has left a first-hand account of the event.2 GhazzT wrote that Yahya al-Karakl started to preach upon his arrival in the city, and that some of his writings started to circulate among local students. He apparently caused some commotion by his preaching in the Umayyad mosque on 29 January, and was as a consequence placed in the city hospital (Bimdristdri) by the Chief Judge. The placement may have indi- cated some initial uncertainty about whether the man was fully sane. It soon transpired, however, that he had written letters explicating his ideas to at least one local scholar. Other writings by al-Karakl were shown to another local scho- lar by a student who had read and been impressed by them. GhazzT wrote that some of these writings were shown to him, and that they included a number of abominations: denigrating the Prophet Muhammad; insulting the class of reli- gious scholars; criticisms of religion (i.e. Islam) and its followers; denying the existence of God; calumniating God and ascribing to Him perplexity and impo- tence; declaring the prophets to be ignorant; insulting the Damascene scholar TaqI al-DIn al-Hisnl (d. 1426) and the venerable founder of the Hanbali school of law Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (d. 855); belief in "immanentism" (i.e. that God is mainstream theology, law and popular religion Ibn Taymiyya (d. 1328) and his student Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya (d. 1350) - two heroes of modern Sunni fundamentalism - as mulhidun; see his al-Fatdwd al-hadithiyya (Cairo: Mustafa al-Babl al-Halabl, 1970), 203. Ibn Taymiyya was also called a zindiq by TaqI al-DIn al-Hisnl (d. 1426); see the latter's Daf shubah man shabbaha wa tamarrada (n.p., 1418/1997), for example pp. 126, 131, 189. 2 Najm al-DIn Ghazzi, Lutf al-samar wa qatf al-thamar min tarajim a^ydn al-tabaqa al-'uld min al-qarn al-hddT cashar, ed.

GhazzT added that he became disheartened at the fact that such brazen impieties could be expressed in Damascus with impunity, and rallied a number of his fellow scholars to join him in calling for the execution of the heretic. GhazzT and a number of other scholars went to the Chief Judge and accused Yahya al-Karakl of a number of ideas that they claimed amounted to plain unbelief (kufr). The accused confessed to having these ideas, and a demand for his execution was sent to the Ottoman Governor of the city, who - apparently after some hesitation - sent his permission. The idea that the heretic be pilloried and executed in public was abandoned for fear that his sympathizers in the city would cause problems, and he was beheaded then and there in the court of the Chief Judge. He was buried on the banks of a stream notorious for being polluted with the waste and refuse of Damascus. GhazzT expressed his satisfaction with the outcome, and recorded three lines of poetry he composed celebrating the happy end to the affair. GhazzT's account, though related first-hand, is laconic. We are not told, for example, why Yahya al-Karakl insulted the late fourteenthVearly fifteenth- century scholar Taqi al-Dln al-Hisnl. Hisnl was a scholar of the ShafIcI school of law and a follower of mainstream Ashcan theology who was notorious in his day for his vehement hostility to the ideas of the iconoclastic critic of scho- lastic jurisprudence, theology, mysticism and popular religion Ibn Taymiyya (d. 1328).3 However, a follower of Ibn Taymiyya would hardly have been accused of also insulting Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (the founder of the legal school to which Ibn Taymiyya belonged), nor is it likely that his ideas would have been found so unacceptable that they would lead to execution within a few days. The account is also perplexing because the various elements in GhazzT's account do not cohere. We are told that al-Karakl denied the existence of God and yet affirmed that God is immanent in worldly things and that God may be described as perplexed and ignorant. We are told that he insulted God, the Prophet Muhammad and religion in general, and yet that a number of students, janissary soldiers and commoners reacted to his ideas positively and that he had written letters to some religious scholars in Damascus hoping to win their support. Obviously, GhazzT was not interested in giving his readers anything like a detailed and dispassionate exposition of the views of Yahya al-KarakT. In this respect, the account left by GhazzT may be contrasted with the sources that have made possible such classic studies of heresy in late medieval and early modern Europe as Carlo Ginzburg's The Cheese and the Worms and Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie's Montaillou.4 Both studies are based on records of the Inquisition, that early precursor of what Michel Foucault called "disciplinary" 3 Ibn Qadi Shuhba, Tabaqat al-shaffiyya (Silsilah al-jadidah min matbucat Dacirat al-Macarif al-cUthmanIyah, 5/j/7/l-5/j/7/4.

Bray (New York: Vintage Books, 1979).</page><page sequence="4">360 KHALED EL-ROUAYHEB power.5 These records are of extraordinary richness, giving very detailed infor- mation about the thoughts and lives of the accused. The Inquisitors remained in the background, recording the prompted answers of the heretics at great length. The account of GhazzT, by contrast, bears no trace of a disciplinary power characterized by objectification, surveillance and "incitement to discourse". On the contrary, the ideas of the heretic were so distasteful to him that he wasted few words on them. The narrative focus in GhazzT' s account of the trial is on the prosecutors and their reactions and discussions, whereas the heretic himself is silent, and whatever he said at his trial is not quoted. His narrative role is merely to affirm or deny a few questions put to him. The contrast with the Inquisition records utilized by Ginzburg and Le Roy Ladurie could hardly be more striking. A few pieces of information that are incidentally revealed by GhazzT' s account offer additional clues to the tenor of Yahya al-KarakT's ideas. GhazzT mentioned in passing that al-KarakT claimed that his writings had been penned while he was in a trance {ft waqt al-ghayba). GhazzT also mentioned that some of those who hesitated to denounce the man held that his expressions could be given a charitable, non-literal interpretation (ta fwil). This strongly suggests that Yahya al-KarakT was a mystic of some sort, for it was quite typical of defenders of the ecstatic utterances of mystics to emphasize that they were said while in a state of ecstasy and that it is possible to give them a non-literal and theologically acceptable interpretation. The supposition that al-KarakT's ideas were rooted in mysticism is supported by additional information that we owe to another scholar involved in the trial and condemnation, Hasan al-BurinT (d. 1615). BurfnT, whose account is briefer and at least as hostile and laconic as that of GhazzT, wrote that Yahya al-KarakT had written that he had seen the Divine Throne (carsh), and seen God on it, and then a higher god, and a still higher god.6 BurinT added that KarakT had thereby made explicit a belief in polytheism. Again, it defies belief that a person who was literally and openly a polytheist should have obtained a following in Damascus, preached at the Umayyad Mosque, and enter- tained hopes of winning over local scholars by writing to them. BunnT's account is almost certainly an uncharitable rendering of the view - familiar from the writings of several prominent Islamic mystics - that there are experientially dis- tinct levels of the Godhead.7 BunnT also accused KarakT of having written that 5 In his classic studies Discipline and Punish: The Birth of Prison (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1975) and The History of Sexuality. Volume I: An Introduction (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1978) Foucault argued that a distinct form of "disciplinary" power appeared in early modern Europe in various institutions such as the military, schools and prisons. He acknowledged that this form of power had precursors in medie- val Christian confessional techniques. For a modern study that argues that many features of "disciplinary" power are found in the fourteenth-century Inquisition, see Inquisition and Medieval Society: Power, Discipline, and Resistance in Languedoc (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2001). 6 Bunni, Tardjim al-acyan min abna" al-zamdn (MS.

This also seems to be an uncharitable rendering of speculations like those of the prominent Egyptian mystic CAU Wafa' (d. 1405) on Sura 18 of the Quran, according to which al-Khidr' s actions would have been transgressive and con- demnable had he been subject to exoteric law, and Moses was ignorant of other aspects of al-Khidr's actions until he rose from the level of mere prophecy to the level of a prophet-saint.8 KarakT's criticism of TaqI al-DIn al-Hisnl may on this account have been a reaction not to HisnT's criticisms of Ibn Taymiyya but to his stern criticisms of the Sufis of his time, criticisms that were still cited by sixteenth-century Syrian scholars.9 Yet another indication of KarakT's Sufi connections is GhazzT's statement that the "heretic" had gone to Egypt in his youth and had probably imbibed his ideas from there. Egypt seems to have been host to a number of Sufi groups that were held in disrepute by mainstream religious scholars, and some of which were accused of believing in "immanentism" and the transmigration of souls. One of the disrepu- table orders whose existence is attested in Egypt in the early modern period was called the Mutawica. Significantly, GhazzT reported that he said to the Chief Judge while they were eagerly awaiting the permission of the Governor for the execution, that the unrepentant heretic "who chants in the manner of the Mutawica" (wa-yunshidu cald tanqat al-Mutdwfa) fully deserved to die.10 The Mutawica order is little known to modern scholarship.1 x However, it must have flourished in Egypt between the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries, for it is repeatedly denounced by Egyptian religious scholars in that period. Muhammad al-Ghamn (d. 1445), Muhammad al-Dajjanl (d. 1660) and CAU al-cAdawT al-Sac!dI (d. 1775) all penned tracts denouncing the order, particularly for what the scholars claimed was improper conduct with beardless teenage novices.12 Such was its reputation in some circles that the Egyptian scholar Studies in Islamic Mysticism (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1921), 97-103, 125-30. 8 R.

New York: SUNY Press, 2004), 132-41. 9 For example, Hisni's statement that "The Devil plays with the Sufis of our time like chil- dren play with each other" was cited by the Syrian mystic and scholar cAlwan al-HamawT (d. 1530); see E. Geoffroy, Le Soufisme en Egypte et en Syrie sous les derniers Mamelouks et les premiers Ottomans (Damascus: Institut francais d'etudes arabes de Damas, 1995), 177. Berger sees KarakT's hostility to Hisnl as being due to the latter's opposition to anthropomorphism; see Gesellschaft und Individuum, 292. 10 Ghazzi, Lutf al-samar, 2: 706. Berger, who also concludes that Yahya al-Karaki was a mystic of sorts, does not note or discuss this reference to the Mutawica. 1 1 Its existence has been noted by Tawfiq al-Tawil, al-Tasawwuf fi Misr ibbdn al-casr al-cuthmdnT (Cairo: n.p., 1946), 76, 85; M. Winter, Society and Religion in Early Ottoman Egypt: Studies in the Writings of cAbd al-Wahhdb al-Shacrdni (Studies in Islamic Culture and History. New Brunswick and London: Transaction Books, 1982), 80-2; Geoffroy, Le Soufisme en Egypte et en Syrie, 206, 340. Winter speculates that it could have been a heretical offshoot of the Ahmadiyya order. Geoffroy presents this as a settled fact though he only cites Winter in its support. 1 2 See cAbd al-Wahhab al-Shacram, al-Anwar al-qudsiyyafi macrifat qawaHd al-sufiyya, ed. Surur^and al-ShaficT (Cairo: al-Maktabah al-cllmlyah, n.d.), 1: 47 (citing an unpublished</page><page sequence="6">362 KHALED EL-ROUAYHEB and Sufi cAbd. al-Wahhab al-ShacranI (d. 1565) urged his readers not to denounce everyone who belonged to that order, since it - like the Ahmadiyya and Rifaciyya orders - contained both "the good and the bad". Shacranl described the Mutawica order as active in Upper Egypt and in the Sharqiyya pro- vince (east of the Nile Delta).13 The prominent Egyptian scholar and mystic cAbd al-Ra'uf al-MunawT (d. 1622) apparently agreed with Shacranl that the order included both "the good and the bad". On the one hand, he devoted a num- ber of sympathetic entries to individuals belonging to the order in his volumi- nous biographical dictionary of Sufis.14 These entries suggest that the order's members tended not to be scholars, were often of rural or lower-class origin, and that they - at least at some times of the year - led an itinerant lifestyle and relied on the charity of laymen. Their religious devotions tended to centre on the charismatic miracle-working saint, visiting shrines and experiencing states of mystic ecstasy. The order also included some "holy fools", i.e. people who displayed usually mild degrees of mental disorder and were revered as liv- ing saints. On the other hand, MunawT also cited one other Sufi master who con- demned the order for its hostility to the class of religious scholars, which supposedly led "some of them" to be utterly ignorant of the stipulations of Islamic law and thus indulge in actions such as prostrating themselves to the sun, and using urine instead of water for ritual purification.15 From other con- demnations of the order by jurists, it would seem that the Mutawica were known for wandering in groups with flags, drums, water-pitchers for performing ablutions and large rosaries. During their sessions of mystical chanting (dhikr), young beardless novices would wait on them and embrace them from behind if the participating men worked themselves into a trance. This embrace was appar- ently known as the "repose of the fakirs" (rdhat al-fuqara')}6 The Mutawica was only one of several groups of Sufis that were reckoned problematic by mainstream religious scholars but were nevertheless active in Egypt during the lifetime of Najm al-DIn al-GhazzT (1570-1651) and whom he may have had in mind when he claimed that Yahya al-Karakl probably imbibed his ideas from heretics while in Egypt. The Egyptian jurist Mansur al-Buhutl (d. 1641), a contemporary of GhazzT, wrote that pantheist groups had become "a general scourge" in his time (wa-qad cammat al-balwd work by Ghamn); Abu al-Fath Muhammad al-Dajjanl, al-cIqd al-mufrad ft hukm al-amrad (MS.

The last of these entries is devoted to a man with the attributive "al-Abhan", which suggests Iranian origin (Abhar is a town near Qazvin).

These heretical groups based their antinomianism - or so Fariskun wrote - on exagger- ated claims of their spiritual station: They have claimed to reach the ultimate station in the blink of an eye, and that the point of separation (ghayn) has been effaced, in addition to a num- ber of other lies and abominations . . . Thus many of the people of this time have been corrupted, and this is all too visible for the eye to see. The dis- obedience of The Powerful has become their motto, and the rejection of His commands and prohibitions their garment (dithdr).19 The root of these heresies - according to Fariskun - was the corruption of their creedal beliefs by the Devil. The Devil succeeds in doing so either because they follow in the footsteps of other heretics, or because they follow their whim and caprice, or because they take certain ecstatic utterances of venerable mystics out of context and mistake their meaning. Fariskun proceeded to divide his tract into seven sections, corresponding to seven heretical beliefs that he wished to denounce. Parts of the first section, including the section title, are missing from the extant manuscript of the work. It is clear, however, that in the section Fariskun discussed, the controver- sial idea of the "unity of existence" (wahdat al-wujiid) and the related claim that God is absolute existence (al-wujud al-mutlaq) were prevalent in some Sufi cir- cles, particularly those influenced by the prominent mystic Ibn cArabI (d. 1240). Ibn cArabI and his ideas had been the source of considerable controversy in the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.20 The controversy seems to have become less intense after a number of prominent Sunni scholars in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century had pronounced in favour of the mystic, such as the widely respected Egyptian jurist and Chief Judge Zakariyya al-Ansarl (d. 1519), the Egyptian scholar Jalal al-DIn al-Suyutl (d. 1505) and the Ottoman Grand Mufti Kemalpasa-zade (d. 1534).21 The conquest of Syria and Egypt in 1516-17 by the Ottomans - who for a number of reasons tended 17 Mansur al-Buhuti, Kashshdf al-qindc can matn al-Iqnd' ed.

One of the first actions taken by the Ottoman Sultan SelTm I (r. 1512-20) after his conquest of Damascus was to pay homage to the tomb of Ibn cArabI and order a mosque built at the site.22 By the time Fariskurl was writing, there were few scholars in the Ottoman Empire who would denounce Ibn cArabI outright. However, his ideas continued to elicit anxiety, and often the ideas were pronounced beyond the pale, even while their author was considered a saint. This position frequently resorted to the idea that Ibn cArabT's writings had been corrupted by heretical interpolations, or that they ought to be given a charitable but non-literal interpretation and hence should not be made available to novices and others who were liable to misunderstand their meaning. Fariskun presented the various verdicts of earlier religious scholars on Ibn cArabI, ranging from outright excommunication to wholehearted acceptance, and added - tendentiously - that this disagreement only related to the person of Ibn cArabI. As for the writings attributed to him, there was no disagreement amongst respectable religious scholars that they should not be given a literal interpretation and that one should not rely in matters of doctrine on what they seem to be saying.23 In the second section, Fariskun turned to the belief in "immanentism" (hulul) - one of the charges brought against Yahya al-Karakl in Damascus. Following the extremely influential fourteenth-century theologian Sacd al-DIn al-Taftazanl (d. 1390), he wrote that in a sense there could be no "immanence" if - as claimed by the partisans of the "unity of existence" - only God exists. However, he added that in another sense belief in immanentism follows directly from the belief in the unity of existence, for it implies that all perceived phenom- ena are in fact manifestations and reflections of the one divine substance.24 In support of his argument, Fariskun cited an author whom he claimed was a par- tisan of the "unity of existence" who had written in a work entitled al-MTzdn - about which more will be said below - that the "unification" (ittihdd) of God with creation was an idea that was both compelling and abundantly attested in the poetry of Sufis.25 This author cited in support of his contention a number of poems by the prominent Arabic mystical poets of the post-classical age, such as Ibn al-Farid (d. 1235), Abu al-Hasan al-Shushtan (d. 1268) and CAH Wafa' (d. 1405). Fariskun denounced the idea that "unification" is possible, let alone compelling, and he characteristically added that the cited mystical poets had said these lines in a state of mystic intoxication and as such were inno- cent of the heretical doctrinal views.26 In the third section, Fariskun turned to the belief in the eternity of the world. This belief was usually associated with the Islamic Aristotelian/Neoplatonist (Cairo: Bulaq: al-Matbacah al-Kubra, 1272/1855-56), 3: 294 (citing the opinion of SuyutT and Kemalpasa-zade); Winter, Society and Religion, 125-7. 22 Geoffroy, Le Soufisme en Egypte et en Syrie, 79-80. 23 Fariskun, al-Suyuf al-murhafa, fol. 60v. 24 Ibid., fol. 64r. 25 Ibid, fol. 64r-v. 26 Ibid., fol. 65r.</page><page sequence="9">HERESY AND SUFISM 365 "Philosophers" (Faldsifa), but Fariskun pointed out that it was also implied by the pantheism of the heretical Sufis. The doctrine of the Philosophers was, according to Fariskuri, less abominable since they conceded that the world, though eternal, is only possible-of-existence in itself and needs something else (a Necessary Existent, i.e. God) to actualize this possibility. The heretical Sufis, by contrast, were committed to the view that what we take to be the phenomenal world is in fact the uncreated Necessary Existent Himself.27 Fariskun added that this eternity of the world was not only logically implied (Idzim) by their doctrines but explicitly endorsed in their discourse, since they often spoke of the uncreated, ideal prototypes (acydn thdbita) of created things.28 In the fourth section, Fariskun discussed the belief that God will not fulfil His threats to the unbelievers, and that no-one will suffer eternal punishment. This was obviously a claim that particularly incensed Fariskun, for his tone is particu- larly acerbic when refuting it. He exclaimed: They have challenged the Word of God with the swords of falsity and have encroached upon It with falsification and corruption . . . One can only won- der how they clutch at the hems of the Book of God when it so clearly refutes their idea . . . If you cite to them the verses mentioning punishment they shield themselves with the armor of the esoteric sect, and if you men- tion to them the verses mentioning repentance they hold on to the ropes of the literalists.29 Fariskun distinguished between four different grounds for holding the abomin- able belief that non-believers will not suffer eternal torment in Hell. One such ground is the view that there is no free will and all actions are predetermined by God. Fariskun countered by expounding the standard view of the prevalent Ashcan school of theology that while it is true that God creates all events in the world, there is nevertheless a subclass of behaviour which can be classified as voluntary insofar as it is accompanied by our intentions. Our intentions are - like all things except God - inert and have no causal power, but their accompa- nying our actions means that we acquire responsibility for these actions.30 In the fifth section, Fariskun discussed another possible ground for denying the reality of eternal damnation: the view that the external rites and regulations of religion are stages upon the path of spiritual progress, and may be discarded once true monotheism and love of God is attained. Fariskun added that "some claim that the external religious obligations no longer apply to him [the accom- plished mystic] and his servitude becomes contemplation" (wa-zacama baQdu- hum annahu yasqutu canhu al-Hbdddt al-zahira wa-takunu Hbddatuhu al-tafakkur)?1 Fariskuri did not, however, explain how and why this belief leads to a denial of eternal punishment for unbelievers. 27 Ibid., fol. 66v. 28 Ibid., fols 66v-67r. 29 Ibid., fol. 68r-v. 30 Ibid., fol. 68v. 31 Ibid., fol. 69r-v.</page><page sequence="10">366 KHALED EL-ROUAYHEB In the sixth section, Fariskun discussed yet another ground for denying the reality of eternal punishment: that the seeker can reach such a stage that God becomes united with him and it would be true to say "He is I and I am Him". At that stage, religious obligations no longer apply.32 Again, Fariskun did not elaborate on exactly how and why this belief in "immanentism" leads to the denial of eternal punishment for unbelievers. In the seventh and final section, Fariskun discussed once more the belief that God is absolute existence. Fariskun connected this belief with the view that there will be no eternal punishment and damnation, though yet again without making clear the logical connection between the two positions. It is evident that the thrust of this last section is directed at the views of Ibn cArabI, for Fariskun cited several lines of Ibn cArabT's verse, as well as passages from his famous prose work Fusils al-Hikam, which express the view that God's wrath is not eternal, and that God's "not carrying out the threat" (khulf al-wacid) that He made in Scripture in no way implies any imperfection in God, quite the contrary. Again, FariskurT added that Ibn cArabI is innocent of these heretical views, and that the relevant sections of his Fusils al-Hikam are apocryphal.33 Fariskun' s work was ostensibly aimed at Egyptian Sufis during his lifetime whose views included a belief that God is the only existent and that the phenom- enal world is a substance-less reflection or manifestation of Him, and who were inclined to doubt the prevalent Islamic doctrine that eternal torment would be the lot of unbelievers. The connection between these two ideas is not made clear in Fariskun' s work. Presumably the view that only God exists and the phenomenal world is a mirage, though it does not logically imply any position on the fate of unbelievers, would nevertheless often be associated with the view that the exter- nal rites and regulations of religion are merely stages along the path of spiritual enlightenment, and that once that stage is reached these rites and regulations - and with them the distinction between believer and unbeliever - lose their point. Certainly, there is some evidence - to be presented below - that a number of Sufi groups in the early modern Arab-Islamic world embraced such views and thought that they went hand-in-hand with a monistic metaphysics. There is also abundant evidence, however, that a number of Sufis of the period viewed the ideas of Ibn cArabi favourably and yet denied that antinomian conclusions follow from them. One such Sufi was the Egyptian cAbd al-Wahhab al-ShacranI (d. 1565). He is the author of the work entitled al-MTzan that was cited and refuted by Fariskun. It is surprising that Shacranl should have been cited as an example of a "heretic Sufi-aster", for he is presented in modern scho- larship - with good reason - as a paradigm example of a "moderate" and law- abiding Sufi who shied away from anything that smacked of antinomianism and who - while defending Ibn cArabI as a venerable saint - refrained from explicitly endorsing the more controversial aspects of his teachings.34 Fariskun had in fact clearly removed the passage that he cited from its context, and thus distorted 32 Ibid., fol. 69v. 33 Ibid., fol. 69v-70r.

In the cited work, Shacranl expounded the standard mystical (and indeed mainstream Islamic) view that God manifests Himself (yatajalld), but added explicitly that this does not mean that God becomes immanent in, or united with, worldly things. However, it does mean that belief in divine immanence becomes something of a necessary illusion. A mystic who in a state of ecstasy witnesses God's epiphanies must willy-nilly express "immanentist" or "unificationist" ideas, even though on closer consider- ation these ideas are not accurate and in fact self-refuting.35 Fariskuri's discus- sion of the passage from ShacranT's book is a disturbing example of wilful misrepresentation followed by condemnation. He would not have been out of place at the trial of Yahya al-Karakl. Shacranl was in fact eager to dissociate himself from what he saw as heretical Sufi groups active in his own time. In one of his major works, he warned his readers thus: Be sure you do not associate with the group that has donned the appear- ance of Sufis in the second half of the tenth century [i.e. second half of the sixteenth century CE] without knowing the stipulations of religious law. They have gone astray and been led astray by reading the books of the Sufis pertaining to divine unity without knowing their meaning. One person of this group came to me while I was sick and there was no one with me. I asked him who he was and he said "I am God". I said, "You lie!" Then he said, "I am Muhammad the Prophet of God". I said "You lie!" Then he said, "I am the Devil and I am the Jew". I replied, "You are right!" By God, had there been people with me who would testify against him I would have led him to the religious scholars and they would have beheaded him in accordance with the noble Law.36 Incidentally, ShacranT's statement to the effect that antinomian Sufis appeared in the second half of the sixteenth century can safely be discounted as being in line with the well-known topos of "the decline of the times". There is too much evi- dence for the existence of antinomian Sufis in Egypt during the thirteenth, four- teenth and fifteenth centuries to make ShacranT's claim even remotely plausible.37 Rather, the comment should be seen as part of a regular and homi- letic emphasis in his writings on the supposed deterioration of Sufi life in his own day compared to the exemplary piety of the Sufis of times past.38 The mystical works that Shacranl claimed were misunderstood by these here- tical Sufis would seem to be the very same works that he had - just a few lines 35 cAbd al-Wahhab al-Shacrani, al-Mizdn al-dharriyya al-mubayyina li-caqd'id al-firaq al-caliyya, ed.

These included the poetry of Ibn al-Farid (d. 1235), Muhammad Wafa' (d. 1364) and cAbd al-Karim al-JTlT (d. 1428), as well as the prose works of the Andalusian mystics Ibn cArabI and Ibn Sabcln (d. 1270).39 To this list we can probably also add the writings of Muhammad Wafa"s son CAH Wafa' (d. 1405) and Ibn Sabcln's associate and follower Abu al-Hasan al-Shushtan (d. 1268), both of whom Shacranl had mentioned elsewhere as expressing "unifica- tionist" ideas in poetry. The mentioned figures were widely believed to have expressed - poetically or in prose - the basic view of the "unity of existence". Several of these mystics had also expressed other ideas that were deemed pro- blematic from the perspective of mainstream religious scholars. The idiosyn- cratic views of Ibn cArabI on the fate of unbelievers in the hereafter have already been mentioned. JUT, in his major prose work al-Insdn al-kdmil, seemed to assert that the theological errors of the Christians were instances of mistaken ijtihdd (independent opinion formed on the basis of scripture) that would - with the intercession of Jesus - eventually be forgiven.40 This was utterly out of bounds for many religious jurists, many of whom deemed it apostasy merely to doubt whether Christians and Jews were unbelievers, to say that God is worshipped in churches and synagogues or to say that the prayers of Christians and Jews are acts of piety.41 Ibn Sabcln's circle included both the controversial poet al-Shushtari and the intriguing figure of Ibn Hud al-MursT (d. 1299 or 1300), who taught Maimonides' Guide to the Perplexed to Jewish students, and who reportedly once scandalized a scholar who had asked to be initiated into his order by replying, "Into which order, that of Moses, Jesus or Muhammad?"42 The Egyptian mystic and poet cAlI Wafa' had once been criticized by the well- known scholar Ibn Hajar al-cAsqalanI (d. 1449) for allowing his followers to pros- trate themselves towards him during the ritual sessions of music and dance (samdc). To this Wafa' reportedly answered by citing the following verse of the Quran: "Wheresoever you turn, there is the face of God" (2:1 15), and was duly accused of unbelief (kufr) by some of the people present at the exchange.43 The legacy of such figures was vigorously contested in the Arabic-Islamic world in the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It appears that very few religious scholars were prepared to condemn outright these prominent mystics of the past. Like both FariskQri and Shacranl, they were more likely to insist that the words of these venerable saints should not be taken at face-value and were liable to be "misunderstood" by the untrained novice, and were in fact "misunderstood" by groups they deemed heretical. This view was buttressed by various interpretive strategies, such as appealing to the intoxicated state of the author or poet, or pos- tulating heretical interpolations in certain works, or simply explaining away the 39 Shacrani, Laid 'if, 2: 29. 40 cAbd al-Karim al-JTlT, al-Insdn al-kdmil fi mcfrifat al-awdkhir wa l-awd il (Cairo: al-Matbacah al-Azhariyah al-Misriyah, 1328/1910-11), 74-5.

As an example of this last strategy, one may consider the following attack on the class of religious scholars by CAU Wafa': The saints are in truth the inheritors of the Prophets. As for those who carry exoteric knowledge and invent issues for mundane reasons and in pursuit of their fancies, they have nothing to do with this rank. Rather, they are like those described [in the Quran (62:5)] as having been made to carry the Torah and then not carrying it out [like a donkey carrying books]. The correct position is to make use of what they carry, but without acknowledging their authority or their opinions and without allowing them to have their way. The donkey is supposed to carry loads and be used, not to rule, nor to be listened to and obeyed. ShacranT, who devoted to CAU Wafa' a lengthy and admiring entry in his biogra- phical dictionary of Sufis, commented on the passage thus: I say: Perhaps the Shaykh intends people who support their fanciful beliefs by lies, such as those who fabricate sayings of the Prophet (hadith) to embellish their innovations. The intention is not those scholars whom God has ordained to set up the religious law.44 ShacranT's interpretation is, to put it mildly, far-fetched. Wafa' obviously cannot have intended fabricators of hadith, for he explicitly endorsed "making use" (al-intifac) of the knowledge borne by the scholars he was comparing to pack animals. On this point at least, it would seem that the Mutawica - whose hostility to the religious scholars has been mentioned above - had reason to believe that they, and not Shacranl, were faithful to the legacy of the venerable CAU Wafa'. II The Aleppine scholar and mystic of the KhalwatI order Qasim al-Khanl (d. 1697) was, like ShacranT, both positively inclined towards the ideas of Ibn cArabI and eager to reject what he saw as heretical views that could arise from misunderstandings of Sufi writings. In his short treatise al-Tahqiq fi al-radd cald al-zindiq (The Verified Truth in Rebutting the Heretic) he rejected the view that the relationship of God to the world is best compared to the relationship of water to ice, or cotton to cloth, i.e. that God is the underlying rea- lity behind the changeable phenomena that constitute the world.45 The rejected view is abundantly attested in Sufi poetry and prose, and closely related to at least one common understanding of the theory of "the unity of existence". It had already been condemned in the treatise of Fariskurl as making God equiv- alent to the Aristotelian "prime matter" (hayuli) of the universe.46 KhanI also 44 cAbd al-Wahhab Shacrani, Lawaqih al-anwdr fi tabaqat al-akhyar (Cairo: Sharikat Maktabat wa Matbacat Mustafa al-Babl al-Halabl, 1954), 2: 57. 45 Qasim al-Khani, al-Tahqiq fi al-radd cala al-zindiq (MS.

The "heretic" takes their statement literally, and considers his own "filthy" self and identifies it with God. This, according to KhanI, leads him to abandon religious duties and to permit himself what the religious law forbids. "May God kill him and cleanse the countries from him, and killing him is in order to save the weak-minded of God's servants from him".47 It is clear that the "heretic" here is a pantheist antinomian, though KhanI did not make it clear whether he was thinking of contemporary heretical groups or simply head- ing off possible misunderstandings of the venerable Sufi masters. The Damascene Mustafa al-Bakri (d. 1749) was another admirer of Ibn cArabI who was eager to dissociate himself from antinomian groups. Bakri was a pro- minent and influential mystic of the KhalwatI order who succeeded in spreading the order widely in Syria, western Arabia and Egypt. One of his works is entitled al-Suyuf al-hidad ft acndq ahl al-zandaqa wa'l-ilhdd (The Sharp Swords in the Necks of the People of Heresy and Unbelief).48 In it, Bakri made it clear that he was condemning existing groups in his time which: collected the ecstatic utterances of the Sufi Gnostics and have made it their way, and have memorized some of their saying . . . They claim to believe in the "unity of existence" and misunderstand the words of the Sufi Gnostics . . . They hold fast to the words of the intoxicated and appeal to the sayings of the perplexed . . . even though these ecstatic utterances must be given a charitable interpretation and must be turned away from the literal meaning towards that which is appropriate.49 The theme is familiar from Fariskun's earlier Egyptian work, though it is noteworthy that Bakri - in contrast to Fariskuri - did not consider the belief in the "unity of existence" to be itself heretical, only misunderstandings of the doctrine. Neither was the aforementioned Qasim al-Khanl opposed to the idea of the "unity of existence"; he stressed that it should be experienced after exten- sive spiritual exertions. Merely affirming it theoretically could lead to "heresy" {al-zandaqa).50 This difference reflects the increasing influence of the idea of the "unity of existence" in the Arab-Islamic parts of the Ottoman Empire. A number of orders which were, on the whole, positively inclined towards the idea, such as the Indian Shattari and Naqshbandl orders and the Turkish KhalwatI order, had become increasingly influential in Arabic-speaking 47 KhanI, al-Tahqiq, fol. 107r [Yahuda 3355]; fol. 6v [Yahuda 4598]. 48 Mustafa al-Bakri, al-Suyuf al-hidad ft acndq ahl al-zandaqa wa 'l-ilhdd, ed.

In the introduction to his treatise, Bakn wrote that it had been written to coun- ter what he saw as the wide diffusion of antinomian ideas in Damascus in his time, and to prevent individuals with such ideas from seeking affiliation to his KhalwatI sub-order or from corrupting the beliefs of its members.52 Bakn wrote that one of those whose writings were invoked by these heretical groups was Ibn cArabI, "the most dazzling light and the Greatest Master".53 Bakn went well beyond the grudging concession of the saintly character of Ibn cArabI made by Fariskuri, and considered himself a follower of the Andalusian mystic. Unlike both Fariskuri and Shacranl, he did not resort to crude notions of heretical inter- polations in the works of Ibn cArabI. Being very well versed in these works - and a student of al-NabulusT who was perhaps the foremost commentator on Ibn cArabI of his time - he instead urged that particular passages are liable to be misunderstood when taken out of context, and that their proper meaning only becomes clear when juxtaposed to other passages, such as Ibn cArabI's repeated insistence on the necessity of following the letter of the religious law. Bakri accordingly cited copiously from the works of Ibn cArabI in refutation of the views of the heretical groups. One of the views that Bakri condemned was that the religious law is the appearance that spiritual truth takes for the sake of commoners, but that for the accomplished mystic: there is no meaning to prayer except being connected with God, and no meaning to fasting except that of abstaining from seeing what is other than God, and no meaning to pilgrimage except that of turning one's intent to God, and no meaning to ascending Mt Arafat [during the pilgrimage] except ascending the mountain of gnosis.54 Bakri also condemned the belief - which he attributed to these heretics - that their spiritual rank was such that the Devil no longer had any means of leading them astray. I heard one of them say: "We do not know the Devil (IblTs) and there is only God the Exalted". To him the following should be said: Do you mean that the Devil has ceased to exist, or that he exists but you cannot 51 See D. Le Gall, A Culture of Suflsm: NaqshbandTs in the Ottoman World, 1450-1700 (Albany: SUNY Press, 2005); and my "Opening the gate of verification: the forgotten Arabic-Islamic florescence of the seventeenth century", International Journal of Middle East Studies 38, 2006, 263-81. 52 Bakn, al-Suyuf al-hiddd, 26. 53 Bakri, al-Suyuf al-hiddd, 44. 54 Ibid., 48. lhe tormulation ot the position is exploiting the similarity between the Arabic words for "prayer" (saldt) and "connection" (sila), and the similarity between the name ^Arafat and the verb "to know" (carafa).</page><page sequence="16">372 KHALED EL-ROUAYHEB see him because of your own limitations? He cannot say the former, for in that case he repudiates the Great Quran.55 Bakn added that the hubristic idea that the Devil no longer posed a threat led these heretics to let down their guard and become infatuated with beardless teen- aged youths, whose beauty they claimed was the beauty of God. Since they have claimed that they are secure from the Devil and only see God, he [the Devil] has afflicted them - behind their backs - with infatua- tion . . . and suggested to them gazing at handsome faces which leads to sin and transgression. And they argue that such gazing is licit and appeal to the saying of one of the Sufi Gnostics in colloquial verse: "All beauty is the beauty of God, there is no doubt".56 This is a standard accusation that had been raised for centuries. As mentioned above, the charge of improprieties with beardless teenage novices was repeat- edly made against certain Sufis - such as the Egyptian Mutawica - by religious scholars and often also by more ascetic and law-abiding Sufis. The underlying idea with which such groups were associated was that human beauty is the most perfect manifestation of divine beauty, and that the Platonic contemplation of this beauty is a means of directly witnessing the overwhelming beauty of God.57 The mistake of denying the reality of the Devil was, Bakri added, sympto- matic of the basic error of these heretics. They had not learnt, as his teacher Nabulusi had written, "to see with both eyes": they had not learnt that the denial of the substantiality of what is other than God is only part of the truth, and should be conjoined to the simultaneous affirmation of creation and its impor- tance. Denying creation was the mistake of heretical mystics, while not realizing the insubstantiality of the phenomenal world and its character as divine epiphany was the mistake of exoteric, anti-mystical scholars.58 Like Fariskun, Bakn also accused the heretics of presuming to interpret the Islamic scriptural texts (the Quran and the canonical sayings of the Prophet Muhammad) without having the requisite scholarly background for doing so, "for the explication of the Book and the Prophetic Tradition requires [mastery of] several sciences, as well as divine favor".59 Towards the end of the tract, Bakn reiterated the view that the denial of cre- ation is unbelief (kufr) and that venerable mystics who expressed pantheist ideas were in a state of intoxication and would not have affirmed such ideas in a sober 55 Ibid., 91. 56 Ibid, 105. 57 A classic study of this theme that focuses on the earlier Persian tradition is H.

The person who insists on denying creation and who attributes his heretical views to these mystics commits a heinous error on both counts. "The one who kills him and restrains him and punishes him does a meritorious deed".60 Balm's treatise clearly indicates the existence of pantheist and antinomian groups in Damascus during his lifetime. It is unlikely that this was a new phenomenon, for we have evidence of antinomian Sufis in the city from the thir- teenth and fourteenth centuries.61 This means that such groups probably existed in Damascus at the time of the trial and execution of Yahya al-Karakl. This situ- ation may at first sight seem odd, but is presumably also related to the non- existence of anything like the Inquisition in early-modern Syria and Egypt. People who in word or deed openly and loudly challenged the prevalent scho- larly interpretation of Islam could be, and sometimes were, tried and executed. Yet, there appears to have been no systematic attempt to search for such heretical groups, or to instigate investigations of the beliefs of individuals and groups who maintained a low profile. This was in line with a deep-rooted ethos amongst the scholarly class, well-attested in matters relating to the enforcement of morality, according to which vice should be repressed when it appears in a flagrant manner, but should not be actively sought out.62 Again, the contrast with the "disciplinary" power so memorably discussed by Foucault is striking. Ill As sources for heretical ideas and practices, the tracts of Fariskuri, KhanI, and Bakn leave much to be desired. The vehemence with which they condemned here- tical ideas seems to have precluded lengthy and dispassionate exposition. Nevertheless, they provide evidence for the existence of Sufi groups in the early- modern Arab-Islamic Middle East that were deemed heretical by contemporary Islamic religious scholars, and the basic contours of their world view can be inferred from their writings. The remarkable work Hazz al-quhuffi shark qasid Abi Shdduf (The Nodding of Heads in Commenting on the Ode of Abl Shaduf) by the Egyptian scholar Yusuf al-Shirblnl (fl. 1 664-87) offers a lively but satirical portrait of some of these groups in seventeenth-century Egypt.63 Shirblnl's work is an extended satire on the coarseness of Egyptian rural life, in the course of which the author gives rare glimpses of the elusive world of the pre-modern Islamic village, far removed from the urban, literary culture to which Islamic authors normally belonged. The author devoted a section of his work to the rural dervishes, whom he saw as overwhelmingly ignorant and inclined to here- tical views and antinomian and sexually licentious behaviour. The topic of several of ShirbTnl's anecdotes was the rural dervishes' utter ignorance of the basic tenets of Islamic law: one of them could not read the opening verse of the Quran 60 Ibid., 299. 61 A.

The Islamic scriptural texts appear to have played a mar- ginal role in the religious life of these rural groups, which seems instead to have been centred on the charismatic spiritual master and saint, on miracles (kardmdt), ecstatic states and speaking in tongues {tar jama bi'l-lisdn), and on activities such as visiting shrines and participating in saints' festivals and sessions of mystical music and dance. These groups were nominally Muslim, and did not normally challenge outright the sanctity of the sacred texts. However, their critics repeatedly denounced them for in effect ignoring these texts in favour of the max- ims and ecstatic poetry of the Sufis, and for rejecting the authority of the class of religious scholars whose legitimacy was based on the ability to interpret and expound the scriptural texts and the religious law. According to Bakri, the here- tical groups had no "proof (dalil) for what they claimed, and merely engaged in "babble" (shaqshaqat al-lisdri). It is clear that Bakn was not incensed by a lack of rational argument on the side of the "heretics", but by what he saw as their dis- regard for proof-texts from scripture (i.e. the Quran and the canonical sayings of the Prophet Muhammad). He cited an earlier scholar who had said in verse: If you say: "God has said, the Prophet has said", they sneer at you with murderous disapproval And say: My heart relates to me, from its secret core, from the secret core of my secret core, from the purity of my states; From my spiritual level, from my thought, from my spiritual retreat, from my transfiguration, from my witness, from my state; From the serenity of my time, from the truth of my wisdom, from the essence of my essence, from the attributes of my deeds; [. . .]67 Shirblni also wrote in the opening passages of the section in his work dealing with rural dervishes: As for their fakirs, they have no path except the nodding of heads and the clapping of hands and jumping and shouting and the rosary and the water- jar ... and ignoring the teaching of the basic conditions of obedience to God . . . and chattering with their tongues and saying: The saint so-and-so 64 Ibid., 177. 65 Ibid., 180-1. 66 Ibid, 195. 67 Bakn, al-Suyuf al-murhafa, 33-4.

They do not defer to the people of excellence and talk only as the ignorant do. They do not know any issue in religion, and have no cer- titude in their path. They commit the most heinous sins, and their status is that of brutes.68 This charisma- and saint-oriented Islam seems sometimes - to judge from ShirbTnl's account - to have been based on sheer ignorance of an alternative. He related a number of instances in which the dervishes were amenable to being "corrected" once scholars - the author or some of his acquaintances - pointed out the corrupt nature of their beliefs and practices. One presumes that there were also dervishes who respected the basics of Islamic law but rejected the authority of the religious scholars on matters that can be described as non- basic: for example, in the juridical responses (fatdwd) against the Mutawica order cited by Muhammad al-GhamiT in the early fifteenth century, the order is not charged with, for example, not praying or fasting. Rather, they are accused of insisting that their mixing freely with women and beardless youths, and allow- ing them to participate in mystical sessions of music and dance, is permissible, and that dancing, singing and the accompanying clapping of hands in mosques is also permissible. The jurists' response was that anyone who insists that some- thing is licit when the religious scholars agree that it is not licit is thereby an unbeliever.69 This was of course a serious charge, but the Mutawica order can hardly on that account alone be described as antinomian. Shirblnl, however, described dervish groups that apparently rejected the authority of Islamic law in a more radical manner in his work. One such group he called the "Khawamis", a term that does not seem to be attested elsewhere. He described them as not dis- tinguishing between the religiously prohibited (hardm) and the religiously licit (haldl), and as freely indulging in fornication and the drinking of wine and ignor- ing the prescribed fast during the month of Ramadan: An upright person has related that he saw a group of them eating during Ramadan without a legally acceptable excuse. He asked them about this and they said: "We are a people no longer bound by religious-legal regu- lations for we are in the station of witnessing God the Exalted and are in the state of self-annihilation in God, and if a person's self is annihilated religious duties cease to apply to him".70 Another story had a Sufi acquaintance of the author host members of this group in his lodge, only to throw them out when they expressed their surprise at his praying even though "you have reached a stage of freedom from religious obligations (wa-anta qad saqata canka al-taklif)".71 The sexual improprieties of the Khawamis was the topic of several of ShirbTnT's anecdotes, some of which clearly sacrifice any concern with 68 Shirbini, Hazz al-quhuf, 164. 69 Muhammad al-Ghamn, al-Hukm al-madbut fi tahrim fi'l qawm Lut (Cairo: Dar al-Sahabah lil-Turath, 1988),' 111-14. 70 Shirblnl, Hazz al-quhuf, 165. 71 Ibid., 180.</page><page sequence="20">376 KHALED EL-ROUAYHEB verisimilitude to the aim of satire: for example, we are told of these groups hold- ing music sessions during which the fakirs enter a trance and are considered "dead" and to have entered "paradise" and hence offered either handsome youths or beautiful women, as the Quran promises paradisiacal youths and beau- tiful houris to male believers in the Hereafter. Those who divulge these secret rites are killed and sometimes cooked and eaten.72 We are told of a woman of this group who was seen fornicating during Ramadan and said that it was merely her vagina that had broken the fast.73 We are told two anecdotes of der- vishes who sodomize teenage boys with the pretence of wishing to transmit their supernatural powers by means of "the miraculous drop" or "the water of life".74 We are even told a story of a son who discovers that his father - a reputed saint - was actually worshipping a genie in the cellar of his house and that the genie in return gave the father extrasensory information that could be used to impress others and buttress the father's saintly reputation.75 Despite the author's lack of concern with verisimilitude, it would nevertheless be too hasty to dismiss his work as having no connection to actual beliefs and practices. The stories of dervishes sodomizing boys as a means of transmitting miraculous abilities, though doubtless embellished for good effect, may for example have had some basis in views that circulated among some dervish groups. The Finnish anthropologist Edward Westermarck noted a widespread belief in early twentieth-century Morocco that the blessings (baraka) of a saint could be trans- ferred though homo- or heterosexual intercourse.76 E. W. Lane, in his magisterial description of Egypt in the 1830s, also noted, while speaking of the "holy fools" that were widely venerated in the pre-modern Islamic world, that "the women, instead of avoiding them, sometimes suffer these wretches to take any liberty with them in the public street; and, by the lower orders, are not considered dis- graced by such actions".77 Other anecdotes related by Shirblnl about the Khawamis are of particular interest since they purport to be based on first-hand experience. For instance, he once overheard "a man from this group" discuss his views with "one of the notable people". The dervish supposedly told the man that there is no need to pray and fast since "you are Him and He is you, thus you are God and you are the Provider and the Living One and the Throne and the Chair and the Tablet and the Pen". He supplemented this view by citing lines from the poetry of Ibn cArabI and cAbd al-Kanm al-JTII. Furthermore, the dervish told the man, the creation of humans is from earth and there is nothing illicit in earth touching earth. Hence, there is nothing prohibited in fornication or sod- omy, for it is merely the rubbing of physical bodies and the mixing of dust. Shirblnl related that at this point he took a knife and approached the dervish with the intent 72 Ibid, 167-8. 73 Ibid., 166. 74 Ibid., 183-5, 196-8. 75 Ibid, 173-4. 76 E.

Shirblnl explained to the dervish's interlocutor that the statements amounted to unbelief and that the dervish could therefore be killed with impunity. He then expounded to the man the correct view on these matters, thus saving him from the influence of the heretic. Shirblnl added that he had heard others relate of the very same dervish that he had led many people astray, and that he - when he saw a bull or cow - would exclaim, "You are God! You are He!" and would recite: My beloved pervades existence, And appears in White and Black, And in Christians and Jews, And in dogs and cats. The lines were obviously by some respected mystical poet, for Shirblnl added that the heretic did not know the meaning of these words, nor the intentions behind them. Shirblnl went on to relate gleefully that the dervish in question died poor and blind and was buried in a ground that was later discovered to be an old cesspit. Like the Damascene prosecutors of Yahya al-Karakl, Shirblnl thought that burial "in shit" was the appropriate end for heretics.78 Shirblnl also related a number of anecdotes featuring what he described as "clean-shaven dervishes". He seems to have considered this group to be distinct from the "Khawamis", for at one point he noted that an adolescent boy who becomes a dervish is liable to be sexually exploited "by some of the fakirs or the sect of heretics who shave their beards or the sect of the Khawamis".79 He related, for example, that he had once hosted a dervish generously, and that the dervish, wishing to return the favours, invited him to a private home. Shirblnl soon discovered that the meeting featured a number of clean-shaven dervishes and a woman. The woman sat on the laps of the men in turn, and responded pas- sionately to their kissing and fondling. When they noticed ShirbTnT's discomfort, they became worried that he was not "on their path" (laysa cala madhhabina) and threatened to kill him unless he fornicated with the woman in front of them. The of course virtuous Shirblnl managed to escape, and just outside the house had the fortune of running into a police lieutenant (muqaddam al-darak) who knew him well and who duly arrested the entire gang. Shirblnl added that the woman was later set free since it transpired that she was the wife of a notable man.80 ShirbTnT's testimony should be approached with caution, especially in light of the lack of concern with accuracy that he so clearly exhibits elsewhere in the work. However, his story receives some support from the travel account of James Silk Buckingham in the early nineteenth century. Buckingham's guide 78 Shirbini, Hazz al-quhiif, 168-71. Note that the line of verse by Jih is misattributed to "al-JabullT" in the edited text (p. 169). The line in question is from the well-known cAyniyya of JTlT; see Nicholson, Studies in Islamic Mysticism, 143 (line 9). 79 Ibid., 198. The edited text has: jamdcatun min al-fuqara" aw min td'ifat al-mulhidin al-muhallaqin al-dhuqun aw al-ta'ifa al-khawamis [sic]. The last words are grammati- cally corrupt, and there are several variants in the extant printings and manuscripts, some of which do not mention the "Khawamis". 80 Ibid., 171-3.</page><page sequence="22">378 KHALED EL-ROUAYHEB "Ismael", an Afghan he met in Baghdad, was a dervish whom Buckingham described as having abandoned belief in any particular religion, and combined hedonism with an itinerant lifestyle as a dervish. He and his associates in Baghdad had, Buckingham wrote, formed a secret society consisting of freethink- ing Christians, Shiis and Sunnis, who were "in agreement in philosophy" (muttafiqun bVl-falsafd) and devoted themselves to pleasure. They had, or so "Ismael" claimed, the financial means to purchase the sexual services of daughters and wives of notables in the city. Buckingham wrote: During the late Ramadan, nearly a thousand pounds sterling was expended, among this knot of philosophers, for women only; by which, however, they procured those of the first distinction in the place, both wives and daughters of those high in office and in wealth. That such things are practicable and practised, is beyond a doubt.81 Despite Buckingham's assurances, the truth of such reports is certainly not beyond doubt, but it also cannot be excluded a priori that such circles and activi- ties existed in the pre-modern Middle East. Shirblni related that he heard another clean-shaven dervish say that there is no resurrection and afterlife, and that hell and heaven are within us, and that the world does not end. The dervish cited in support of his view a short poem by the renowned sceptical poet Abu al-cAla' al-Macarn (d. 1057). He also expressed belief in the transmigration of souls - one of the beliefs attributed to Yahya al-Karakl in Damascus.82 Shirblnl also related that a group of dervishes once challenged one of his acquaintances about the Quran and denied that it is the Speech of God, insisting that it instead contained what the Christian monk Bahira had taught Muhammad.83 Shirblnl did not explicitly state what kind of dervishes these were, but the anecdote immediately followed that of the clean-shaven dervish who denied the afterlife. Shaving the beard is a familiar characteristic of antinomian dervish groups attested in earlier centuries, such as the Qalandariyya, a name that does not appear in ShirbTnT's work.84 Judging from ShirbTnT's anecdotes, the "clean-shaven dervishes" may have been closer to the sceptical "free-thinking" associated with earlier figures like Abu al-cAla' al-Macarn than to the monistic mysticism of Ibn cArabi and the charisma- and ecstasy-centred outlook of the Khawamis.85 However, this is a preliminary impression that will need to be sub- stantiated by future research. ShirbTnT's work certainly raises a number of issues that cannot be adequately addressed given the present state of scholarship. It is 81 J. S.

Colburn, 1829), 84. 82 ShirbTnT, Hazz al-quhuf, 193-4. 83 Ibid., 194. 84 See Karamustafa, God's Unruly Friends, which deals with the Qalandariyya and related groups from the thirteenth century to the early sixteenth.

There are not even any references to the "Mutawica", perhaps because the author was not writing in Upper Egypt or in the Sharqiyya province where that order was active. Instead, we encounter unfamiliar designations such as the "Khawamis" and vaguely familiar terms such as the "clean-shaven der- vishes", both terms with which the author expected his readers to be familiar. The similarities and differences between these groups are not made explicit in ShirbTnT's work, and their relationship to orders and movements that are more familiar to modern scholarship is not clear. IV Some of the ideas and practices described by Fariskun, Bakri and Shirblnl were unambiguous and conscious rejections of Islamic law and dominant interpret- ations of Islamic doctrine. Yet, the boundaries of heresy were for a number of reasons not always so clear-cut. This was partially due to disagreements internal to the class of religious scholars. The status of Ibn cArabI, for example, was - and still is - a heatedly debated topic amongst religious scholars. It has already been mentioned above that Fariskun seems to have considered cAbd al-Wahhab al-ShacranI to be a "heretical Sufi-aster", a view that was far from being standard amongst his scholarly contemporaries. Even Najm al-DIn al-GhazzT - one of the Damascene prosecutors of Yahya al-Karakl - included a sympathetic entry on Shacranl in his biographical dictionary of Muslim notables who died in the tenth century of the Islamic calendar (1495-1592 ce).86 Another factor that tends to blur the boundaries of heresy is that the main- stream or majority opinion among Islamic scholars on particular issues was liable to change over time. By the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century, prominent members of the scholarly establishment were endorsing views that Fariskun had condemned as heretical in the late sixteenth century. For example, cAbd al-Ghanl al-NabulusT (d. 1731) - one of the most prominent scholars of Damascus in his lifetime - explicitly defended the idea of the "unity of exist- ence" and also endorsed Ibn cArabT's views on the fate of unbelievers in the hereafter.87 Al-Bakn - who counted some of the most prominent Egyptian scho- lars of the eighteenth century as his disciples - also considered himself a fol- lower of Ibn cArabI and would almost certainly have dissented from Fariskun 's view that sections of the work Fusus al-Hikam were pure heresy that should therefore not be attributed to Ibn cArabI. An additional factor that complicates the simple juxtaposition of "orthodox" and "heretical" Islam is the well-attested fact that scholars - particularly those of 86 GhazzT, al-Kawdkib al-sd'ira, 3: 176-7. 87 See cAbd al-Ghani al-Nabulusi, al-Wujud al-haqq, ed. B. cAla' al-DIn (Publications de l'IFEAD, 153. Damascus: Machad al-cllml al-FaransT lil-Dirasat al-cArab!yah, 1995); M. Winter, "A polemical treatise by cAbd al-Ganl al-NabulusT against a Turkish scholar on the religious status of the Dhimmis", Arabica 35, 1988, 92-103.</page><page sequence="24">380 KHALED EL-ROUAYHEB a mystical bent - would sometimes publicly condemn views that they them- selves would express in more esoteric writings. A case in point is Mustafa al-Bakn's condemnation of heretical Sufi groups for admiring and loving hand- some beardless youths as manifestations of divine beauty. Bakn mentioned that they would invoke the saying that "all beauty is the beauty of God, there is no doubt", but did not mention that the words were those of Ayyub al-cAdawT (d. 1660), a prominent Damascene mystic of the same KhalwatI order as Bakn. Ayyub was in his day well known for his fondness for handsome beardless youths, an inclination that is mentioned even in sympathetic accounts by his contemporaries.88 Bakn could also hardly have failed to know that his teacher cAbd al-Ghanl al-NabulusI had vigorously defended the mystical adoration of handsome male youths both in poetry and in prose. He himself had described without any trace of disapproval Nabulusl's passionate love for Muhammad al-DikdikjT (d. 1719), a student of NabulusT and later one of the teachers of Bakn.89 It would seem that Bakn - like his mentor NabulusT - considered this particular aspect of mystical love to be permissible and even praiseworthy, but not something that should be divulged to all and sundry. Yet other factors that blurred the boundaries of heresy were the notions of "ecstatic utterances" {shatahdf) and "holy fools" (majddhib). The hermeneutic principle that the poetry and ecstatic utterances of venerable mystics of the past should not be taken at face-value seems to amount to the view that a saint or venerable mystic could at times make statements that would be heretical if taken literally. It was also a well-established juridical principle that adults who were not fully sane were not subject to religious stipulations. Many such "fools" were venerated as living saints in the pre-modern Islamic world, by both com- moners and scholars, despite the fact that they often behaved in a manner that flouted religious law.90 Both of these concepts were brought into play in the case of Yahya al-Karakl in Damascus in 1610. His initial placement in a hospital suggests that it was not a foregone conclusion that he would be prosecuted as a heretic rather than venerated as a holy fool. However, the fact that he had written a number of works seems to have tipped the scales in favour of prosecution. The accused tried to defend himself by saying that his writings had been composed in a state of ecstasy, and his supporters in the city reportedly held that his utter- ances could and should be given a charitable and non-literal interpretation. His prosecutors almost certainly recognized the "charitable, non-literal interpret- ation" of "ecstatic utterances" as an interpretive strategy that was legitimate in principle. However, they refused to apply it to the case at hand. Unless specta- cular new evidence comes to light, we will not know for certain why they refused. Presumably, exoteric scholars were prepared to condone the ecstatic utterances of long-dead mystics whose stature tended to be enhanced by the very passage of time. It was another thing entirely when an outsider arrived in their city, openly engaged in daring theosophical speculations and challenged their position as the repositories of religious knowledge and authority. 88 See my Before Homosexuality in the Arab-Islamic World, 1500-1800, 99-100. 89 Ibid., 10&lt;M. 90 See Dols, Majnun, 366-422; Geoffroy, Le Soufisme en Egypte et en Syrie, 309-33; Berger, Gesellschaft und Individuum, 306-20.</page></plain_text>
