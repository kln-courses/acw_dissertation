<plain_text><page sequence="1">An Oracular Scene from the Pozo Moro Funerary Monument One of the most intriguing finds from Phoenician Spain is a funerary monument from Pozo Moro, which lies about 125 km southwest of Valencia. This turriform monument, now housed in the Museo Arqueologico Nacional in Madrid, rests on a stepped base that supports several rows of ashlar blocks. Its hollow inte- rior held the remains of a funeral pyre and a variety of funeral gifts, among them an Attic kylix and a lekythos, which allow us to date the monument to ca. 5 oo BCE. The second row of ashlar blocks contains a band of friezes, some of which survive in a very frag- mentary state. However, two of the most detailed ones are relatively intact. One of these depicts a scene of child sacrifice, which has been discussed by many scholars. The other is more difficult to interpret and has been largely ignored. This panel is intact, with the exception of a missing section in the center of the left edge, which almost certainly depicted the torso of a man. The relief has two foci. The first is a tree with large branches. A group of small men stand under the lower branch and prod it with pitchforks, possibly in an attempt to disturb the birds resting there. The second focus is a large male who approaches a fire-breathing mon- ster. Traces of flames appear at the other side of the tree as well, which suggests that another monster is present at the right. Interpretation of this scene has proved difficult, especially since it has no obvious connection to Phoenician myth or cult. Almagro- Gorbea suggests that the relief represents a myth in which a superhuman figure attempts to steal the tree of life, which is guarded by monsters; the short men touch the tree in order to get something from it, possibly life itself (1978: 201-2). While this is not unreasonable, another interpretation emerges from a comparison of the iconog- raphy of this relief with the myths and rituals surrounding the Greek sanctuaries at Delphi and Dodona. Context of the Iconography Dodona has a long and complex history (Parke 1967). The earliest stage is described in the Iliad (16.233-235), where Achilles prays to "Lord Zeus of Dodona, Pelasgian, dwelling afar, ruling over hard- wintered Dodona-and around dwell the Selloi, your interpreters with unwashed feet, sleeping on the ground." Additional informa- tion is found in the Odyssey (14.327-30; 19.296-99), where Odysseus, disguised as a Cretan stranger, tells the swineherd that "Odysseus was going to Dodona, so that from the god's high-foliaged oak tree TOP:The Phoenician Pozo Moro funerary monument.

These passages indicate that unshod priests called "Selloi" heard the will of Zeus from a sacred oak and provided interpretations of what they heard. Later sources also refer to the sacred oak: Aeschylus (Prometheus Vinctus 832) men- tions talking oaks at Dodona and Apollonius Rhodius (4.580-85) says that a speaking beam taken from the sacred oak of Zeus enabled the Argo to talk (for references, see Parke 1967: 18, n. 31). Of course, the tree at Dodona did not speak in a human voice. A number of ancient authors tell us that cultic officials interpreted the noises made by the rustling of the leaves or the creaking of the branches, the "voice" of the tree (Parke 1967: 27-29). References to the Selloi as functioning priests disappear by the fifth century BCE, when our sources begin to speak of priestesses (Parke 1967: 53-55). Herodotus (2.52) says that Egyptian priests told him that Phoenicians had carried off two priestesses from Egyptian Thebes and sold one of them in Greece, where she founded the sanctuary at Dodona. The priestesses at Dodona, however, told a different story: they said that a black dove had flown from Thebes to their sanctuary, where it sat on an oak and proclaimed in a human voice that the tree was to become an oracle of Zeus. Sophocles (Trachiniae 171-72, 1166-69), who mentions the Selloi and "the oak with many tongues" in an archaizing nod to Homer, says that the oracle was delivered by two "peleides," which can be translated as "doves" or "old women." Unfortunately, Sophocles does not indicate which he means (Parke 1967: 59-64). Later authors, however, are more spe- cific. Dionysius of Halicarnassus (1.14.5) says that the doves that sat in the oak at Dodona actually prophesied, while Strabo (Epit- ome 7, fr. la-c Jones) says that the priestesses attached to the sanctuary interpreted the flight of these birds (Parke 1967: 64-66).' So just as the Selloi had earlier interpreted the noises that issued from the oak, the priestess who replaced them interpreted the chirping or the flight of the sacred doves. Myths and the Pozo Moro Relief The myths surrounding Delphi also shed light on the Pozo Moro relief. According to tradition, Delphi was originally controlled by a goddess, whose identity varies in our sources. Those authors who attribute ownership to Gaia tell us that a giant snake guarded the site.2 The Homeric Hymn toApollo (300-546) says that, when the god arrived and decided to establish his own oracle there, he first had to fight the serpent and kill it. Then he began searching for priests to oversee his rites. Instead of selecting them from the Greeks of the surrounding area, he boarded a Cretan ship and installed its crew as his first priests. Although priestesses deliv- ered inspired utterances at Delphi (as at Dodona) during the historical period, there is evidence that other methods of divina- tion may have been employed in earlier stages in the development of the oracle. The Homeric Hymn toApollo (395-96) says that the god spoke from his laurel tree, just as the Odyssey says that Zeus spoke from the oak at Dodona.3 This may explain why the Pythia shakes the laurel tree before delivering her prophecies; perhaps the sound of the leaves was once believed to transmit the will of the god (Bouche-Leclerc 1879: 83, n. 2). Pausanias (10.24.6) adds that a stone was present at the site, which the people of Delphi deemed sacred; they anointed it with oil every day and decorated it with wool during festivals. West's conjecture that it had mantic powers (1966: 303) is supported by a number of lexicographers, who call it a baetyl, a type of sacred stone that was sometimes endowed with oracular powers.4 This may be the same stone to which Nonnus (Dionysiaca 9.284) refers when he tells of how Ino established dances for Bacchus "next to the prophetic rock" at Del- phi. Priscian (Institutiones Grammaticae 7.32) reveals that this 68 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 64:1-2 (2001)  - - - </page><page sequence="3">baetyl had the name abaddir, a Semitic word that means "father of the Powerful One" and may refer to the Phoenician god El (Ribi- chini 1985: 115-25). This strongly suggests that some elements of the early stages of the Delphic cult were not Greek, but Near Eastern (Sourvinou-Inwood 1987:225, 233-35). Foreign Influence Traces of foreign influence are even more numerous at Dodona. Both modern and ancient commentators offer a number of dis- parate and unsatisfactory explanations for the origin of its unshod priests, who were such an anomaly in Greek religion that Strabo (7.7.10) called them "barbarians" (Parke 1967: 8-10). Alexan- der of Pleuron (Scholiast A on Iliad 16.235), a Hellenistic scholar, traced the origin of the Selloi to the Etruscans (who were influenced by the Phoenicians) and tells us that they "worship Zeus in this way through an ancestral practice."5 This custom is also mentioned in the Old Testament, where Moses was told by Yahweh to take off his shoes before walking on holy ground (Exo- dus 3.5); Joshua received the same command from an angel (Joshua 5.15).6 The Near Eastern origin of this cult practice is confirmed by the tophet stelae of North Africa, which fre- quently depict priests without sandals (Leglay 1966: 371-73). Just as unshod priests are an anomaly in Greece, so is Zeus' own- ership of an oracular oak. However, oracular trees, especially oaks, are frequently associated with the storm god in the Levant (O'Bry- him 1996: 131-39). According to the Hebrew prophets, sacred trees stood in Canaanite sanctuaries and were a popular source of oracles. They were deemed so effective that they were sometimes utilized by the Israelites themselves, who appro- priated several for Yahweh, most notably the terebinth of Ophrah (Judges 6.11-32), the oak of Moreh (Genesis 12.6-7), the oak of Mamre (Genesis 13.18 and 18.1-15), and the "Diviner's Oak" at Shechem (Judges 9.37).7 Thus, both unshod oracular priests with unwashed feet and mantic oaks have strong parallels in the Levant. They also appear in Phoenician oracular sanctuaries in Spain. Delcor has sug- gested that the word "Sellol" may derive from the Phoenician word s'l, "to ask," which appears in an inscription from Spain that refers to mantic priests in a sanctuary of Astarte (Delcor 1976:116-17). Phoenician oracular sanctuaries in Spain are also connected with Melkart.8 The most famous of these stood in a grove at Gades and was controlled by priests (Dio Cassius 37.52 and 77.20). Silius Italicus (Punica 3.8-11, 28) goes into great detail about their cult practices: no women or swine are allowed in the sanctuary, the robes of the priests are linen and are marked with a broad stripe, they wear a headband of flax, they offer incense with unbelted robes, their heads are shaved, and they wear no san- dals. His accuracy is confirmed in part by North African tophet stelae that depict priests who wear this type of costume (Leglay 1966:370-71). The Key to the Relief The cult practices and myths of Delphi and Dodona, along with their Near Eastern analogues, provide the key to the Pozo Moro relief. At Dodona, either the behavior of birds in the sacred oak or the noises produced by the tree itself were interpreted by priests or priestesses. At Delphi, the divine founder of the sanctuary, which originally had a mantic laurel, had to free the oracular site from a monstrous serpent. Both of these elements are present on the Pozo Moro relief. An anthropomorphic figure, whose divine or heroic status is revealed by his size, advances toward a fire-breathing monster near a large tree inhabited by birds. Under the limb on which these birds sit are men of short stature, which indicates that they are humans as opposed to the much larger, superhuman figure. They are pushing the limb with pitchforks, apparently in an attempt to make the birds fly. This would enable them to observe their behavior and, thereby, to deliver prophecies. It seems likely that these figures represent either the oracular priests themselves or the functionaries who assist them in obtaining oracles.9 The Pozo Moro relief, then, appears to depict a mythical event. The tree, the birds, and the men with pitchforks are not its main focus, but serve to indicate that the action takes place in an oracular sanctuary. The primary focus of the relief is the combat between the monster and the large, anthropo- morphic figure, who may be attempting to appropriate the oracle just as Apollo did at Delphi. Almagro-Gorbea suggests that the panels from the Pozo Moro monument do not depict isolated myths, but constitute a pictorial narrative related to the function of the monument (1978:195). They may represent a mythic cycle related to the divine or heroic figure depicted in this relief. It is also possible that the superhuman figure in this and other reliefs, or the myths depicted in the reliefs as a group, had some relevance either to the owner of the tomb or to the afterlife. Unfortunately, we cannot piece the answer together until we have a better understanding of the remaining panels. Perhaps the suggestion presented here will be of some help in this task.

Fontenrose (1959: 13-29) and Sourvinou-Inwood (1987: 215-41). 3 Arisophanes, Ploutos 213 with scholia, Aristonous 1.10, and Ovid, Metamorphoses 15.634. See also Parke and Wormell (1956: 26).Amandry, however, believes that the shaking of the laurel is purificatory (1950: 126-34) and also suggests that ornithomancywas practiced at Delphi (1950:57-59). 4 For sacred rocks in the Levant, see Genesis 28.10-22 and 31.45-54 along with Exodus 24.3-8 and 34.12. For sanctuaries that contain sacred trees and rocks, see Deuteronomy 7.5 and 12.2-3 Joshua 24.26-27, Judges 6.25 and 9.6, and Micah 5.12-14. For a mantic stone, see Habakkuk 2.19. Damascius (apud Photius 242, fr. 203 = Migne, Patrologia Graeca 103, column 1292) speaks of a Levantine priest named Eusebius who interpreted the whistle that emanated from a small stone sphere. See also Joseph, Hypomnesticon in Migne, Patrologia Graeca 106, column 162. NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 64/1-2 (2001) 69 </page><page sequence="4">5 There is an inscription from Caria (ca. 200 CE) that refers to a priestess of Zeus, who was descended from "concubines with unwashed feet" (Ramsay 1883: 276-27). 6 For barefoot priests in the sanctuaries of the Levant, see Cumont (1927: 330). 7 Porter (1981: 91-213) provides a general account of divination in Israel. Loretz (1990:143-50) lists some of the types of divination that the Israelites borrowed from the Canaanites. For oracular trees, see de Moor (1976: 243-44) and Smith (1990: 84-85). 8 For Melkart in Spain, see Bonnet (1988:203-41) and Garcia-Bellido (1987: 135-55). Melkart was associated with Hercules, whom Clement of Alexandria (Stromata 1.15.73) describes as a diviner. 9 Greek mythological analogues are found in the stories of Mopsus, a prophet from Dodona, and the prophet Melampus (whose name, "Black Foot," is reminiscent of the Selloi), both of whom interpreted the language of birds (see Parke 1967:16 n. 33 and 164-71).
