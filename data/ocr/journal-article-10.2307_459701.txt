<plain_text><page sequence="1">HISTORY AND CRITICISM: A PROBLEMATIC RELATIONSHIP* BY W. K. WIMSATT, JR. THE TOPIC which I am undertaking to discuss-that of the rela- tion between history and literary criticism-is one which today apparently invites the polemic style. I wish, however, to forego that style and at the same time to refrain from the special defence of, or at- tack upon, any critic or historian or any school of critics or historians. What I have in mind is the delineation of a certain issue which arises between literary criticism and historical scholarship. This issue I look upon as something unavoidably problematic, part of a troublesome op- position which runs through all our experience-between the particular and the universal, between the contingent and what is in any sense necessary, probable, or ideal, between what merely was and what in any way is. We may think Aristotle's statement that poetry is a more serious and a more philosophic thing than history only a rude beginning of theory (unhappily antithetical), but it is a beginning of something which can scarcely be left alone. The problematic relation between history and criticism has always existed. It may have been adjusted during one long epoch of our tradition, the classical, by a certain neglect of the claims of history. The modern advance of historical techniques and consequent sharpening of historical conscience have, however, sufficiently reasserted the problem and sufficiently increased its difficulty. Let me offer the preliminary explanation that I am concerned to de- fine and vindicate the role of history in criticism, and this, for one thing, by asserting a distinction between history in its several antecedent or causal relations to the writing of literature and history as meaning in works of literature. Whether antecedents themselves, if viewed in a certain light, do not become meanings, may often be difficult to say. But in so far as the distinction between the two may be maintained, it is highly relevant to this discussion. To offer one instance: the fact, so amply documented by Alexander Beljame, that English writers in the age of Addison and Swift were dependent on political rather than on courtly patronage helped to produce the further fact that these writers dissipated a good deal of their energy in pamphlet and newspaper con- troversy, partisan assaults and panegyrics. Here I should say that practical motivation, though very closely related to literary expression, may be readily enough distinguished from the quality of that expression. On the other hand, consider the not quite parallel truth that the de- * An address given at the General Meeting of the Modern Language Association in New York, December 28, 1950. 21</page><page sequence="2">22 History and Criticism: a Problematic Relationship pendence of authors on patrons in that age and even more in the pre- ceding age of Dryden created opportunities for a special kind of servility -in prefaces and dedications-and that this servility in turn, if suffi- ciently jolted, could precipitate a special kind of irony and hence give a special character to controversy and satire-Dryden's debate with Sir Robert Howard about rhyme or Pope's Epistle to Augustus. Here we have a social relation which becomes part of the very mind and expres- sion of authors in their work. In such cases, and they are many, history enters in a very pronounced way into the meaning of literary works. In such cases it is clear that history precedes and enables the under- standing and hence the criticism of literary works. And in a broader sense something like this is always so, for words, the medium of literature, have to be understood, and understanding is derived at least in part from historical documents. But let me for the moment reverse that em- phasis. Or let me supply its complement in making a second and equally important (though perhaps obvious) preliminary point-namely, that understanding is derived not only from historical documents but also from our own living and thinking of the present. No amount of deference paid to history can escape the fact that every explanation of a word is in the end an appeal to things, or the companion fact that old documents are mediated in the direction of things by new documents. "For myself," says a distinguished Shakespearian editor, "I have learnt more about Shakespeare's Henry from Wavell's Life of Allenby than from all the critics put together."' To understand the heroism of Henry or the irony of Pope and Dryden we have to draw upon historical information and linguistic glosses. But we have to draw equally upon the modern world and our own experience. We find the meaning of heroism and of irony ultimately in the objects of our own experience and in our own minds. II What I have called the issue, or what may perhaps better be called the tension, between literary criticism and historical scholarship, is something which may be most difficult to define in one of our most flourishing modern disciplines, the history of ideas. The history of anything general-of institutions, arts, or philosophies-is always an attempt to reduce the general to the particular. "History of Ideas" means ideas taken as events which have occurred in time-waxing and waning-not as references to a world of experience, more or less correct. Nevertheless, I believe that history of ideas, so far as it enters into the meaning of literary works, often has a special affinity for criticism-the reason for this lying not in 1 J. Dover Wilson, ed. King Henry V (Cambridge, 1947), p. lvii.</page><page sequence="3">W. K. Wimsatt, Jr. the emphasis of the discipline on history, but in its emphasis on ideas. The modern school has worked very hard toward a kind of atomism, a discrimination and definition of unit ideas, conceived like slogans or catchwords. But ideas as such tend to have implications or to be con- nected in systems, that is, in philosophies, and to that extent, even when their referential character is small, they may have coherence and hence present a kind of interest and even truth. It follows that literary works which are explainable by the history of ideas are likely to partici- pate in some of the same values. It would be difficult, for example, to expound Pope's Essay on Man in the light of Professor Lovejoy's essays on Nature, deism, and classicism without imputing to the poem itself some qualities either of coherence or of incoherence. And this kind of im- putation is very closely related to the act of evaluation or criticism. But again there are limitations to this role for the history of ideas- and of these let me now speak somewhat more emphatically. They arise from the other emphasis of the discipline, that on history: on the fact that in a certain age and by certain persons an idea or system of ideas was actually entertained. Within the era of modern scholarship we have heard a great deal about research leading to understanding, and under- standing in turn leading to correct evaluation. But we have to invoke more than the strictly historical sense to see how this is true. For exam- ple: Professor Merritt Hughes, in an able essay contributed to the Journal of the History of Ideas,2 has come to the defence of a well-known passage in Spenser's Faerie Queene-that where Guyon and the Palmer respond to the attractions of Acrasia's Bower with the smash-up tactics of a police raid on a "clip" joint. For Spenser and his readers, explains Professor Hughes, "Acrasia stood for something more complex than mere physical lust-for something quite as complex indeed as... [a] disease of the whole sensual nature. ..." This seems to me the correct view. Yet not simply in that it tells us something about either Puritanism or Renais- sance mythology, about a view of Circe and Gryll in so far as this hap- pened to prevail in the minds of Spenser and certain of his contemporar- ies. If our sympathy for Spenser's "Puritan" imagination is increased by this kind of knowledge, surely this can happen only in virtue of the fact that the knowledge has performed a service of focussing and insight for our own imagination. I have not yet seen it demonstrated that Puritan- ism as a philosophy is not preferable to that which underlies the art of the pin-up. To take an opposite example-one in which historical knowledge can scarcely claim to affect evaluation: my distaste for the ending of The Two Gentlemen of Verona, in which Valentine not only forgives the philandering of his Protean friend but generously offers to make over 2 "Spenser's Acrasia and the Circe of the Renaissance," JHI, iv (1943), 381-399. 23</page><page sequence="4">24 History and Criticism: a Problematic Relationship all his interest in a sweetheart, has not been diminished by reading about the classical ideal of friendship in the highly informative book One Soul in Bodies Twain.3 And to take another: in a well-known play by Robert Greene an aristocratic lover named Lacy treats a country maid named Margaret with such cavalier brutality that she is about to retire from the world into a nunnery when, at the last moment, he returns, with the ex- planation that what he did was only a test; he is met with open arms, and the ending reverts to romance. When an article appears explaining this denouement in the light of some "received" and normative feudal view of hierarchical relations between aristocracy and peasantry, I shall be interested in the history. I find it difficult to believe that my evaluation of the drama will be radically revised. (And I do not mean that such a view or any other is incapable of successful literary treatment. Chaucer's tale of the Patient Griselda will in this instance provide the contrast between a conclusion and a premise, between historical reporting and illuminated dramatization.) Our value judgments of past literature can certainly not be decided by the simply historical side of empirical findings about what groups of per- sons, larger or smaller, for longer or shorter periods in the past, have thought or felt about this or that-anthropomorphism or anthropophagy. This is Kinsey Report technique. It is the opposite of value judgment. And if it is more "scientific" than the criticism of poetry, this should warn us against attempting to apply to criticism what can be only a parody of "scientific" method. Let me quote here the eloquent words of Benedetto Croce concerning the historical study of ideas in the Divina Commedia of Dante: ... it is therefore necessary to treat the poetry of Dante, not according to Dante, but according to the truth, in the same way, for that matter, as we treat Plato and Aristotle, not according to their own philosophy, but according to what is the new4 truth of philosophy, and Homer, not according to the little- known poetic theories of his contemporaries, but according to the eternal4 principles of poetry. If we wished to do otherwise, and to think Aristotle with the thought of Aristotle, and Dante with the thought of Dante, we should find our- selves desperately engaged in an impossible effort to distort our own mind... . It is possible that more than a few members of this audience will incline to reject the metaphysics which may be implicit in the argument at this point. If that is so, I suggest that what I am saying is at the very least an inescapable fact of psychology. We are bound to have a point of view in literary criticism, and that point of view, though it may have been 3 By Laurens J. Mills (Bloomington, Ind., 1937), p. 258. 4 My own emphasis falls upon the second of these words. 6 Dante (New York, 1922), p. 32.</page><page sequence="5">W. K. Wimsatt, Jr. shaped by a tradition, is bound to be our own. Points of view cannot be slipped in and out of our minds like lantern slides. Our judgments of the past cannot be discontinuous with our own experience or insulated from it. To evaluate the past we have to penetrate it with our own intelli- gence.6 III What several hundred thousand literate persons thought in the course of a century is history of ideas. What one man said or meant in a line of a poem is history of a person. I am using the term "history of a person" in a broad, but I think legitimate, way, to refer not only to biography proper but to much that is usually placed under the head of bibliography and the techniques of textual study. Let me insist that my purpose in this part of the argument is to present a distinction. I have once before been guilty of saying in print that the critic as critic is not interested in questions of authenticity. At the same time I pleaded that he is innocent of the desire to reduce literary history to an anonymous sludge of col- laboration between authors and printers' devils. The distinction which I have in mind, as it is one which we are seldom if ever called upon to trans- late into a practical choice, may perhaps be best illustrated in a hypo- thetical example. The folio text of Shakespeare's Henry V reads in one celebrated passage: "a Table of greene fields." In 1726 Theobald supplied his brilliant aesthetic guess: "a babbled of green fields." More recent and more scientific conjecture, based on a knowledge of Shakespeare's hand- writing and of Elizabethan playhouse and printing practice, has tended to support Theobald.7 For the sake of my distinction, however, I ask you to suppose the opposite. Suppose scientific study actually to have argued, on the same type of evidence, what is at least conceivable, that Shake- speare wrote "a talked of green fields." Suppose this to be a fairly certain conclusion. There is no critic, so far as I know, certainly no school of critics, who would resist the restoration of Shakespeare's word. At the same time, few historians or textual students, I believe, would argue that this restoration was itself an act of criticism or evaluation-proving that "talked" in this context is better than "babbled." One could scarcely do so, unless on the principle that every word which Shakespeare wrote is bound to be better than any word which Theobald wrote. We tend to admit, I guess, that an author could improve his own poem ("Would he had blotted a thousand!"), as by exercise or diet he might improve 6 A British critic has recently alluded to the "truism" that the life of poetry "is in the present or nowhere; it is alive in so far as it is alive for us"-F.

Dover Wilson (London, [1931]), Introd. 25</page><page sequence="6">26 History and Criticism: a Problematic Relationship his own body, or by reading, his own mind. And nobody else could do this for his body or his mind. Analogy may suggest that the same is true for his poem, and in practice, this is perhaps most often so, a genetic and psychological probability. But it is not a critical principle. The critic is a person who would be prepared to argue that Theobald had done better than Shakespeare. He is a person who is not much surprised when schol- arship discovers that Sir Walter Scott's informant Mrs. Brown of Falk- land used a very free hand in the reproduction of ballads and seems to have been at least as skillful as if she had lived three hundred years earlier. One of the most eminent modern textual scholars, W. W. Greg, de- livered in 1933 a lecture entitled, "The Function of Bibliography in Literary Criticism Illustrated in a Study of the Text of 'King Lear'." "A knowledge of the true text," he asserted, "is the basis of all criticism; and textual criticism is thus the root from which all literary science grows." In the light of the distinction which I have just labored to make, I suggest that this is entirely too simple a view of the matter. What we have is more like several roots-or at least two, text and critical evalua- tion-growing together and intertwined. The textual argument about the authority of the Quarto and Folio versions of Lear relies very frequently upon the superior sense to be found in Folio variants. That is to say, criticism (albeit of an elementary sort) is in this case (as in most others) antecedent to knowing the true text and an instrument for knowing it.8 The same principle, applied in a wider theatre, argues that there can be no literary history independent of criticism-that such is indeed unimag- inable-because even the selection of works for inclusion in a history is an act which implies evaluation. IV It would be only a slight over-simplification to say that we have now indicated four aspects of history under which all problems about the con- 8 Greg actually says nothing about the relation of textual study to the evaluation of King Lear or to that of any other literary work. He does offer several illustrations of a somewhat different sort: "It was the displacement of certain quires in the manuscript of The Testa- ment of Love that concealed Thomas Usk's authorship of the work, and the correction of that error that enabled Henry Bradley to read his anagram aright, and so dispose finally of the attribution to Chaucer .... Without the accidental preservation of the original form of pages . . . altered or suppressed, we should still be wondering over the genesis of the Harvey-Nashe quarrel and as to why Jonson and Chapman went to jail for writing East- ward Ho" (Groningen, n.d., pp. 4-5). These are striking examples "of the service performed by bibliographical investigation to textual and literary studies." But what kind of literary studies? It is only fair to say that the term "Literary Criticism" in Greg's title is meant to include a number of things, among which he explains that "aesthetic criticism" is only one.</page><page sequence="7">W. K. Wimsatt, Jr. tribution of history to criticism may be sorted. That is, we have made a preliminary distinction between (1) history as antecedent or cause of literature and (2) history as meaning of literary works, or, as we might now put it in brief, history as lexicography. We have next entertained, somewhat more deliberately, a distinction between (3) the special mod- ern branch of lexicography, with its very broad value implications, called history of ideas, and (4) history as part of literary works in a more re- stricted sense, that is, history as text of literary works. Various more complicated problems tend to be translatable into terms which we have considered under these heads. Textual study aims to determine what the author said-what words he used, in the most simply definable sense. "At bottom," says Greg, "all problems of transmission are concerned with material factors, in the shape of pieces of paper or parchment covered with certain written or printed signs." A deeper way of invoking the author may be thought to occur when we inquire into the character or meaning of his words after they are safely determined-for example, into the full connotation of the words nature or blood for Shakespeare, or the significance of fools, of bastardy, or of kingship. Such inquiries may even assume a distinctly personal or biographical cast-as, for example, when we inquire into the meaning of blindness in Milton's Sonnet on His Blindness. At the same time, all such inquiries, so far as they relate to anything publicly acces- sible in the literary work itself, may also be subsumed under the general head of history as lexicography or sometimes more precisely under that of history of ideas-and it is under these heads that the critic will be interested to employ them. Milton's career as a public servant does not escape being part of the history of ideas.9 By a certain complication of lexicographical study we arrive at another frequently honored kind of historical effort, that which consists in the search for the author's sources. Here the most special kind of caution re- quired of the critic relates to the fact that history as meaning of a literary work is likely to shade off sharply into history as antecedent. One would hope that critics and historians could agree that there is a difference be- tween a quotation or an allusion, something which has its full literary value only when it is recognized as such, and a simple borrowing, some- thing which through being recognized helps only to explain how a work came about. The allusion to Hecuba and the style of the player's speech in Hamlet enjoy a different status from that of the several vestiges of an 9 I beg leave to say very little about a certain other kind of history, what may be called the history of the detached fact-whether Cortez or Balboa gazed at the Pacific, whether Charles of Sweden was killed by a cannon ball or by a musket ball. The relatively casual relation of this kind of history to history as lexicography will scarcely be questioned. 27</page><page sequence="8">28 History and Criticism: a Problematic Relationship earlier Hamlet which scholars have been interested to uncover. The ear- lier Hamlet may help to account for a certain incompleteness and mystery in Shakespeare's play. But the existence of such a Hamlet is not part of the meaning of Shakespeare's play and can scarcely disqualify any part of that meaning from critical consideration. To notice yet another kind of historical effort: it is possible to investi- gate what we may call the degree of an author's deliberacy-his responsi- bility for and evaluation of his own performance. This investigation may be linked with source study (in a way which we have just now suggested), but more characteristically it is a special branch of the history of ideas, that of aesthetic or critical history. And this is a branch which has uniquely reflexive and deceptive relations to the literary work. Here we ought especially to be on guard for the difference between ideas as events and influences and ideas as references having truth and coherence. It is worth while to notice that the structural and more objectively durable characteristics of the literary work are here what come most often into question, those which, one might say, are least capable of suffering alter- ation upon being placed under one light of intention rather than another. "Whether Shakespeare knew the unities, and rejected them by design, or deviated from them by happy ignorance," said Samuel Johnson, "it is . .. impossible to decide, and useless to enquire." It has been the tend- ency of such inquiries, so far as they have had critical aims, to recoil upon themselves. There was, for instance, that phase in the study of "Shake- speare improved" when it was more or less normal to throw up the hands in dismay at the vandalism of Davenant, Nahum Tate, or Garrick. They did not understand Shakespeare's aims. They were guilty of treating him unhistorically. An answer to that view was to be expected-when stu- dents whose sympathies were strongly enough Augustan had got to work with their historical dialectic-and the answer has appeared. It is now more or less normal, I believe, to praise a scholar in this field if he has sufficient sympathy with the improvers of Shakespeare-if "He knows what they were trying to do, and why." I quote from a review in the Times Literary Supplement during 1945.10 Critical scholarship along these lines can look very much like a reciprocal cannonade between champions entrenched in adjacent literary periods. V Differences of opinion about the relation of criticism to an author's mind arise mainly because of the ordinary function of words as practical expressions of intention. We may have some difficulty with the style of a 10 April 28, 1945, p. 200, review of Gerald E.

Wimsatt, Jr. friend's hastily scribbled message that he will meet us in the cocktail lounge at a given hour, but the message succeeds if we divine his inten- tion. If there can be such a thing, however, as resistance or refractoriness either in the world with which the literary artist deals or in his medium of words, and if compositions in words are to be considered susceptible of criticism either as compositions or as expressions, then it would seem that our way of criticizing them will have to be more complicated. I take poetry and the practical message to be polar extremes in the respect which we are discussing. In between, one would put, for instance, history -a document the meaning of which we assume we ought to discover and accept, an authority (except as to some extent we test its reliability by the analogy of our own experience). And somewhat closer to poetry one would put philosophy and science, not quite such great authorities, for as they pretend to discuss universals, we discover their meaning only to criticize it-and scientists, even philosophers, become outmoded. Science and philosophy one might say occupy a position of extreme exposure to the criticism which proceeds from our own experience. It is not, however, a position of maximum exposure. That distinction is reserved for poetry -a type of discourse which has traditionally submitted to criticism not only of its contentual meaning (in all the referential and emotive senses) but of its meaning at those other levels which we call its form and its style. Poetry in short suffers criticism of its organization and of its lan- guage, and this in a way that may penetrate very deeply into its peculiar substance. A fault of style in a scientist is not a scientific fault-but in a poet it is a poetic fault. And this is only another way of saying that poems are taken by the critic not as abstract or intentional, but in what might be called solid, or artifactual, dimensions. The verbal object will be viewed by a critic in a kind of stereoscopic perspective which makes it look somewhat like a physical object. The poet himself is taken as artist, not as intender, but as accomplisher. VI Certain arts which enjoy a more fully concrete physical medium than literature often afford us the best opportunity to distinguish a critical from a noncritical interest-and, what may be surprising, to observe that the non-critical is preferred. Let me return to the simplest relation between the artist and his work, that of authenticity. We have the re- cently and widely advertised instance of the Dutch painter Van Mee- geren, who painted six canvasses nearly enough in the style of Vermeer to be able to sell them for about $3,000,000, and who by a curious turn of fate was driven to confess his forgeries-a thing that turned out to be far from easy. The confession was officially accepted, more than two years 29</page><page sequence="10">30 History and Criticism: a Problematic Relationship later, only after the demonstrative painting by Van Meegeren of a seventh Vermeer under court supervision and, what was of far more weight, the most rigorous radiographic, spectrographic, and microchem- ical testing of the forgeries by a large corps of Dutch, Belgian, British, and American technicians. Mere critics and connoisseurs-and histo- rians-were divided in the face of Van Meegeren's achievement. His paintings had been internationally acclaimed, especially the first and most lovingly conceived, The Disciples at Emmaiis, the master stroke of a Chattertonian plot against the art critics. This had been called the masterpiece of Vermeer. One of the most reliable reporters on this episode in art history, Dr. P. B. Coremans, Director of the Central Laboratory of Belgian Museums, and a member of the Commission appointed by the Dutch Court to examine the paintings, speaks of the Disciples as a "beautiful painting," "a magnificent painting." "It would have been ad- visable, however, in the interests of prudence," says Dr. Coremans, "to have submitted this painting to a laboratory examination, prior to con- cluding the purchase."" The truth would seem to be that a large part of our concern for the fine arts, and for literature no less, our collecting, our virtuosity, our connois- seurship, our iconography, our bibliography, is non-critical, that is to say, non-aesthetic, or not directed to the work of art as such. We have seen the premium placed not only on the first edition and the holograph, but upon the lock of hair, the teapot, and the writing desk. The study of Shakespeare's imagery, wrote a scholar whose name has specially at- tached itself to that imagery, throws light not only on the meaning of the play but, "most important of all-on the way Shakespeare himself saw it."12 We shall have to say, apparently, that this kind of interest has its own reasons, the most important of these being, in the case of literature, the very fact that works of literary art are only structures of verbal meaning -structures which, when separated from their authors, have, to speak metaphysically, no substantial existence. Certain obviously practical reasons-relating to identification and classification-might be named n P. B. Coremans, Van Meegeren's Faked Vermeers and De Hooghs, A Scientific Examina- tion (Amsterdam, 1949), pp. 26, 34, 35. It is not essential to my argument that the evalua- tion of Dr. Coremans be the correct one, and that the negative view of certain other critics, notably M. M. Van Dantzig (Johannes Vermeer, De "Emmausgangers" en de Critici, Leyden, 1947), be mistaken. In either case, the emphasis on authenticity prevails. The impression which I myself receive from the reproductions is that the Disciples at Emmaiis is remarkably unlike Vermeer in certain ways and remarkably like certain erotic and mystical drawings of Van Meegeren, but that it may be nevertheless a very fine picture. 12 Caroline Spurgeon, Shakespeare's Imagery and What It Tells Us (New York, 1935), p. 335.</page><page sequence="11">W. K. Wimsatt, Jr. by the historian and even by the critic in defence of their respect for the names of authors. But the final reason for our interest in authors is, I believe, one which is both deeper and less practical, one which we may simply have to call the need of the human mind for reference to a sub- stantial entity-to a person, rather than to words or thoughts. We must always suppose a speaker for the poem, a dramatis persona. It is a fairly normal movement of the imagination to establish the speaker of the poem as the terminus of our devotion. Even a person of rigorously critical inclination might almost accept the statement of Coleridge: "Assuredly that criticism of Shakespeare will alone be genial which is reverential. The Englishman, who without reverence, a proud and affectionate reverence, can utter the name of William Shakespeare, stands disqualified for the office of critic."13 The person of rigorously critical inclination (have I said?) might almost ac- cept that statement. He might almost, but the fact remains-and it has been the purpose of my paper to describe the relation of this fact to his- tory and to biography-the fact remains that he could not accept it. If Coleridge himself pursued his criticism of Shakespeare with unlimited reverence, that no doubt is one of the reasons why there are moments in his criticism which are somewhat less than critical. And if on the other hand there were limits to his reverence for Wordsworth, that was scarcely an impediment to the penetration of his Wordsworthian criticism. When distinguished from criticism and carried in its appropriate direction- as it can well be-the personal interest in literature is no doubt inde- feasible. Yet it is a thesis worth many times repeating that the personal interest is not the critical-though the history of literary study shows the difference between the two to have been often rather obscurely un- derstood. The personal interest in literature has always been, and will always be, in need of a difficult adjustment with the claims of the critical. "Bardolatry" is a name which may all too well be applied to the excess of the personal and to its corruption of the critical.
