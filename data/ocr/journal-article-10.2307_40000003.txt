<plain_text><page sequence="1">Studies on Akhenaten at Thebes, II A Report on the Work of the Akhenaten Temple Project of the University Museum, The University of Pennsylvania, for the Year 1973-41 Donald B. Redford The Shrines at Thebes &amp; Their Decoration The names of individual buildings erected by Akhenaten at Karnak occur almost exclusively in the identifying epithets placed in columns on either side of the ubiquitous sun-discs. The formula, which hardly varies, is as follows: "Live Reharakhty, He Who Rejoices in the Horizon in His Name 'Light which is in/from the Disc/ the Great Living Disc, Lord of Heaven and Earth, who is in Jubilee, Residing in (hry-ib) . . ." followed by the specific structure's name. To judge by frequency of occurrence the four major buildings, or complexes of buildings, named are (in order of numerical frequency) Gm-t(w)-ftz-Un, Hwt-bnbn, Rwd-mnw, and Tni-mnw. The first is said to be "in the domain (fir) of the Disc in Southern Heliopolis;" the second is sometimes said to be in the first, but there any textual implication of spatial or other connection between any of the named buildings ceases. Those who wish to construe the temples (for such they surely appear to be) as part of a larger whole, and to locate it east of Karnak, had better produce their evidence, or modify their views. They will also have to contend with the embarrassing fact that the four names have a dispersal pattern in their secondary locations which is consistent : the first two names come from the Second Pylon, Hypostyle and the middle courses of the Ninth Pylon. Rwd-mnw comes from the upper courses of the Ninth, and Tni-mnw from the lower courses of the same pylon. To my mind this is not consonant with a single original location for all buildings, but I have argued the point at length elsewhere.2 The relief scenes which decorate the walls of the eight Karnak temples can be separated on the basis of style as well as names and provide a clue as to the activity which went on in each. Scenes of the jubilee come only from Gm*t(w)-p;-itn and account for almost the whole of the repertoire of reliefs therein.3 It has been suggested that Akhenaten celebrated more than one jubilee in his first six years on the throne.4 There is no evidence whatsoever that the Gni't{w)-ps-itn scenes depict more than one ; and in fact only one, the first, is specifically mentioned in the inscriptions. In a scene made up of blocks from the Second Pylon, a band of text is carved above the heads of a group of adoring officials in short caps, arranged in rows of four facing right (see pl. la). The text reads "Introducing the officials, courtiers and standard-bearers of the army to cause them to stand in the king's presence at the first si-festival of His Majesty, which [the Disc?] granted him/'5 The Hwt-bnbn was decorated primarily with but one type of scene, viz. an offering to the sun-disc with Queen Nefertity as celebrant (see pl. Via). Akhenaten apparently does not appear in the Hwt-bnbn</page><page sequence="2">10 JARCE XII (1975) reliefs. The scenes in Rwd-nmw and Tni-mnw are more varied. While the offering scene (with both king and queen in attendance) still abounds, scenes of a more domestic nature appear showing servants and soldiers engaged in their everyday activities. In addition reliefs from Rwd-mnw show long lines of offering-stands containing burning offerings, which apparently stand in the open without surrounding enclosure walls, adjacent to an avenue for chariots. The Period of Akhenaten's Construction at Karnak The building activity undertaken by Akhenaten at Thebes was confined to the first five years of the reign, and after he moved to Amarna all construction ceased. If it was ever resumed (by him) it was in the last few months of his reign. The confidence with which this conclusion is enunciated is not added lightly, but stems from an appreciation of how unanimous the evidence is. This evidence may be briefly summarized as follows : 1. The only name of the sun-disc attested on hundreds of talatat, with but one exception,6 is the early name and the earliest form of the accompanying epithets. The earliest anthropomorphic stage of the cult iconography is also well attested (see pl. Ib). 2. With only three exceptions of a total of many hundreds of examples, the king's nomen-cartouche shows an original yImn-htp ntr hk; *Iwnw. In most cases this reading was later changed to ;h-n-Un. In the three exceptions noted above ?h-n-itn is original.7 3. Of hundreds of examples of the type of scene which shows Nefertity and progeny, over 90 % show the queen with only one daughter; 8% show two daughters; and only three examples attest the presence of three daughters.8 4. The choice of decorative motif for frieses, dados, jambs, etc., as attested especially by the Window of Appearances in the Karnak talatat, is markedly closer to the material in the tombs of Ramose and Parennefer at Thebes, both contemporary with Akhenaten's Theban Period, than to the decorative arts as represented at Amarna. 5. The repertoire of subjects for relief scenes is more limited and traditional at Karnak than at Amarna. Whereas at Amarna there is an intimacy of activity and a greater variety of poses in scenes of the royal family, at Karnak only the king offers, rides in chariot or palanquin, walks or occasionally sits at meat. The queen accompanies the king in these activities or offers herself; the daughters only follow their mother, holding sistra. 6. All the Karnak talatat give the impression of a period of uncertainty and experimentation; the sureness of touch, tranquillity and refinement of Amarna art is quite foreign. 7. A large proportion of the talatat, all from Gnft(w)-p?-itn, are concerned with a sect-festival. In the text quoted above this is specifically stated to be the first. The later celebrations at Amarna are never mentioned.9 8. A small isolated group of talatat, traceable to the Second Pylon and the east- west axis of the Amun temple, shows the cartouches of Tutankhamun and Ay, a few battle scenes, the block noted above (n. 6), and a single reference to one of Akhenaten's granddaughters (see below).10 From this evidence it seems reasonable to draw the following conclusions: 1. Construction work and relief decoration at Karnak under Akhenaten began as soon as he came to the throne and continued until just after the birth of his third daughter and the decision to change his name; 2. It resumed after the birth of a granddaughter and continued during a period comprising parts of the reigns of Tutankhamun and Ay; 3. There is no proof that either construction or decoration was going on at Karnak while Akhenaten was at Amarna. These conclusions sum up exactly what is known, and at present I see no escape from them.</page><page sequence="3">STUDIES ON AKHENATEN AT THEBES II Nefertity in the Theban Talatat An unexpected result of the project's work is the discovery that Nefertity was depicted in a substantially greater number of reliefs than Akhenaten.11 Whether this reflects political power is difficult to say, though one cannot help but entertain a suspicion. As work progresses discoveries of no little interest continue to be made regarding the queen's person and status. For example, it now appears that the addition of the epithet Nfr-nfrw-tin to Nefertity's cartouche must have been made very early in the reign: of 359 certain occurrences of Nefertity's name, 139 display the longer form with added epithet (see pl. Via). Occasionally the simple and longer forms of the cartouche appear in the same scene, and in some reliefs (e.g. on the pillars) available space seems to have been the sole criterion of selection.12 Again, Nefertity shows a surprising degree of indepen- dence in the activities she performs on the talatat. While she may accompany her husband in the offering performance, or follow him in procession, far more frequently she is depicted performing the offering alone, or with one of her daughters. Once, in a scene decorating a ship's cabin, she assumes Akhenaten's role of triumphant executioner (see pl. Vb).13 As far as we have been able to ascertain the queen wears five types of headdress on the talatat: 1. the disc with horns topped by feathers (see pl. Villa),14 2. the feathers alone (without disc), 3. the curled lapet-wig (frequently worn under nos. 1 and 2), 4. the so-called "Nubian" wig,15 and 5. a curled wig in which most of the hair is drawn in by a small ring at the back, while a tail is allowed to fall down the back and two others over the breasts.16 Her ever-present uraeus wears a disc with horns (see pl. II).17 Of all occurrences of crowns, nos. 1 and 2 have a decided superiority in frequency (79%), the "Nubian" wig appearing in less than 20% of the examples. Her gossamer gown is well depicted in the larger scenes, together with the pectorals and amulets which adorn her (cf. pl. VIII b). A Granddaughter of Akhenaten on a Late Talatat As noted above (p. 10 and n. 10), a small group of talatat (some in raised relief) dates to the reigns of Tutankhamun and Ay. To this period we should probably also assign a header (see pl. Vila) later re-used in the north chamber which Nectanebo built abutting on the eastern shrine of Thutmose III (Centre Franco-Egyptien Grid, coordinates IX, P[c]).18 The traces of the two- columned text are clearly to be restored as the familiar caption inscription written over the head of a princess, in this case a granddaughter (see pl. VII b). Which of the two known grand- daughters, Meret-aten minor or Ankhesenpa-aten minor, the relief depicted is difficult to say. As, however, Meret-aten (the child's mother) is not heard of again after the move from Amarna, while Ankhesenpa-aten is known to have survived the abandonment of the site and also the death of her husband, the choice may fall on her and Ankhesenpa-aten minor. 18a The need to identify princesses in Amarna art, both in relief and statuary, called forth the use of a rigid formulaic stereotype. For the daughters the usual format was "King's-daughter of his body, whom he loves, X, born of the great king's-wife Nefertity, may she live," (with slight variants in the queen's name and benedictory element). In buildings put up towards the close of the Amarna period, as represented in the blocks from Hermopolis,19 a formula containing the king's name could replace one containing Nefertity's, thus yielding the following form: "King's-daughter of his body, whom he loves, of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, living on ma'at, Lord of the two Lands (Praenomen), X."20 When granddaughters had to be identified a three-generation statement was sometimes, though not often,21 deemed necessary. This took one of two forms. One was simply an extension of the formula for a daughter with Nefertity as parent, in which the granddaughter occupied front position with the same epithets as the mother, thus: "King's-daughter of his body, whom he loves, X, born of king's-daughter of his body, whom he loves, Y, born of the great king's</page><page sequence="4">12 JARCE XII (1975) wife Nefertity, may she live."22 The other was an extension of the formula for a daughter with Akhenaten substituting for Nefertity as parent, thus: "king's-daughter of his body, whom he loves, X, born of king's-daughter, whom he loves, Y, of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt . . . Nefer- kheprure-Waenre."23 In each pattern the third position gives the parentage of the second position, not the first. With this understanding of the formula, the notion of Akhenaten's having sired his own granddaughter is shown to be wholly baseless;24 and the block Brunner originally brought forward as evidence25 turns out to be simply another example of the three-generation formula. The presence of Nefertity's name in some of the formulae of filiation accompanying the figures of granddaughters, both at Amarna and Thebes, is of paramount importance in the debate over the date of the queen's death. If one accepts the premise that, one of the members of Amarna royalty being dead, his or her name would no longer appear either in the daily business documents or in the (more or less) ad hoc caption texts used to identify progeny,26 it follows that when these texts naming the granddaughters were carved Nefertity was still living. In fact in the Amarna caption text designating Ankhesenpa-aten minor, Nefertity's name is qualified by the epithet cnh4i dt.21 Since Ankhesenpa-aten, the third daughter, is all but absent from scenes carved during the first five years of the reign at Karnak, it follows that her birth cannot have taken place much before the move to Amarna, and scarcely before year 5. But this would mean that she was not of an age to have children herself before the final regnal year of her father, when she would have been eleven. The inescapable conclusion, it seems to me, is that at a certain point in time, no earlier than year 17 of Akhenaten and conceivably later, Queen Nefertity was still living. The writer has long maintained that there is not a shred of evidence that supports the facile assumption that Nefertity predeceased her husband. On the contrary the Amarna dockets continue to speak of an estate of Nefertity in years 10 and n,28 and during the years 14 through 17 refer to an estate of the king's-wife.29 I can see no other recourse than to understand this as a reference to Nefertity, as Meretaten's estate is mentioned during the same period by specific reference to her personal name,30 and probably also under the epithet "mistress" (Spsyt)*1 Significantly, in talatat carved late in the reign, when she had become "the greatly favoured one of the Lord of the Two Lands," she still bears the title "king's-daughter of his body, whom he loves. "31a To my mind the most plausible date for Nefertity Js death is still the third year of Tutankhamun.32 University of Toronto 1 For the first report, see the author in JARCE 10 (1973), 77 ff. The staff list (see ibid., p. 77, asterisked note) has suffered some changes. We are sad to announce the passing, in Hobart, Tasmania, of Mr. Leslie Greener who labored so long and diligently for the Project, and whose many drawings of restored talatat scenes still await publication. Mr. and Mrs. Goharry have left the staff to pursue doctoral studies in the University of Liverpool, while Mr. A. Shaheen of Cairo and Mr. J. P. Clarke of Plymouth, England, both artists, have been added. As formerly, we would like gratefully to acknowledge the very generous financial support afforded by the following: the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.; the University Museum, University of Pennsylvania; Mr. J. Delmege of Fiuggi Fonti, Italy, and most recently the Killam Foundation of the Canada Council for the Arts. Two comments are in order on statements made in the first report. The dubious word in the text of pl. Ill : 6 was rendered whs, but this, as the query indicates, is a pure guess. The obvious reading dw d$r was not opted for, simply because the sign seems clearly to be the arm-holding-the-stick (Gardiner, D40), rather than the mountain (Gardiner, N26). I have no solution to the difficulty. The statement on p. 93, in explication of pl. VIII 17, that Haremhab's name was "incised over another name'' is in error. It is carved over an original decoration of sun-ray arms. 2 JARCE 10, 81 f. 3 There is no evidence that the jubilee was celebrated in the "House of Jubilation," pace Aldred, Akhenaten and Nefertiti (New York, 1973), 29 and 97. Moreover the tentative location of the Gm4(w)-ps-itn in east</page><page sequence="5">STUDIES ON AKHENATEN AT THEBES 13 Karnak, on the site of the large court Chevrier discovered (cf. JARCE 10, 86; C. Desroches-Noblecourt, La statue colossale fragmentaire d'Amdnophis IV, offerte par Vigypte a la France [Monuments Piot; Paris, 1974], 18, 23 1), deserves much closer examination than Aldred will allow (pp. cit., 29). * Aldred, JEA 45 (1959), 32. 5 SU srw smrw Uyw srywt n m^ r rdit 'h'-sn m-bsh nsw m p; sd tpy n hm-f rrdi&gt;n n-p [pi itri\. The phrase (or close variants) occurs in the context of jubilees celebrated by other kings: cf. Urk. IV, i860, 1869; Naville, The Festival Hall of Osorkon II (London, 1892), pl. 14 {rdit hms n (sic) srw). The notion of both king and god sharing a jubilee has sometimes been mooted for the Amarna Period: Gunn, JEA 9 (1923), 170!; Aldred, JEA 45 (1959)» 27 ff.; idem, Akhenaten, Pharaoh of Egypt (London, 1968), 168. But the present text unequivocally attributes the jubilee to the king, and if the restoration is correct — rdi-n n-f is certain, and who else can be the subject but the Disc? — credits its bestowal upon him to the god. 6 Published by Mme. Doresse in Orientalia 24 (1955), 130, and by the present writer in JARCE 10, pis. 111:5, 7 (cf. p. 81, n. 10). The talatat clearly comes from a time when the northern maru at Amarna was occupied, and therefore probably from the reign of Tutankhamun. 7 Two more examples have come to light after Nims wrote in JNES 32 (1973), 185, n. 51. 8 See pis. II-V. Pis. II and III are examples of mother with one daughter, while pl. IV shows two (from a scene on the pillars, where most examples of two daughters are to be found) . These blocks come originally from the Second Pylon. The block shown in pl. Va, found at Luxor, is the only relief representation of three daughters with their mother (the other two examples comprising only part of the third daughter's name). PL Va appears to depict a gateway facade, decorated with two balancing scenes in which the queen, followed by her three offspring, makes offering at a slender stand. Gateways decorated with this type of scene are known to us from the Hwt-bnbn, but usually with but one daughter in attendance. 9 The first jubilee is usually dated (quite arbitrarily in my opinion) rather late in the Theban period of the reign, between years 4 and 6: cf. E. Uphill, JNES 22 (1963), 123 ff.; E. Hornung, Untersuchungen zur Chrono- logie und Geschichte des Neuen Reiches (Wiesbaden, 1964), 80; S. Sauneron, Kemi 19 (1969), 174, n. 2; Assmann, JNES 31 (1972), 151, n. 54. There is no direct evidence from the talatat bearing upon this question; but the weight of circumstantial evidence is overwhelmingly in favour of an earlier date, perhaps as early as year 2. The vast majority of the reliefs (well over 90%) on the talatat commemorate the jubilee, and since the construction work went on at Karnak without interruption and at a feverish pace, beginning in year 1 to about year 6, the jubilee must already have been anticipated at the inception of the reign. While, therefore, it is probable that the Gm-t(w)~ ps-itn was among the first structures to be conceived, it is impossible to date its dedication as late as year 4: thus Desroches-Noblecourt, Revue du Louvre, no. 4/5 (Paris, 1972), p. 5. 10 JARCE 10, 91. One of the talatat showing part of a battle scene was published by Smith in Interconnections in the Ancient Near East (New Haven &amp; London, 1965), fig. 210; on p. 167 Smith erroneously dates it to the early part of Akhenaten' s reign. How these blocks relate, either physically or chronologically, to the larger blocks of Tutankhamun and Ay, at present lying between the Khonsu temple and the Hypostyle, is a problem which will have to await Dr. Otto Schaden's study. 11 JARCE 10, 78. 12 The judgment of Nims (op. cit., 186 and n. 63) is quite sound in this regard. 13 For the use of the motif on the sides of a ship's cabin, see J. Cooney, Amarna Reliefs from Hermopolis in American Collections (Brooklyn, 1965), 81 (no. 50) ; Aldred, Akhenaten and Nefertiti, nos. 55 and 57. The use of the side of a cabin or a gunwhale of a boat for the motif of the conquering king — an ideal place for the viewing of the populace — is not new: cf. P. Barguet, ASAE 51 (1951), 208, fig. 3; J. Lipinska, ASAE 59 (1966), pl. IX; N. de G. Davies, The Tomb of Kenamun at Thebes (New York, 1930), pl. 42; H. H. Nelson, Reliefs and Inscriptions at Karnak (Chicago, 1936), II, pis. 86, 88. In two talatat (one of which is shown in pl. VIb), the scene is used to decorate some architectural feature (a wall, pylon or the like) . One wonders whether we are here confronted by a schematic rendering of the porch before the Third Pylon: cf. R. Saad, C. Traunecker, KSmi 20 (1970), 189, fig. 1; 191, fig. 3. 14 For discussion and references, see Desroches-Noblecourt, Le petit temple d'Abou Simbel (Cairo, 1969), I, 41 ff.; 166, n. 172. 15 Idem, JEA 54 (1968), 82. 16 For Ramesside examples of a similar wig, see Medinet Habu VII, pis. 526, 537, 544, 566. I am grateful to the late Mr. Leslie Greener for drawing my attention to these examples. 17 Cf . E. Naville, The Temple of Deir el-Bahari (passim) ; H. Ricke, Das Kamutef-Heiligtum Hatschepsuts und Thutmoses' III (Cairo, 1954). 24&gt; a^D- 9* 18 First uncovered in 1950, and published by Varille (ASAE 50 [1950], 163 and fig. 7) who, however, failed to note or set on record the significance of this find.</page><page sequence="6">14 JARCE XII (1975) i8a For the possibility that princesses lived at Thebes under Tutankhamun, see J. Samson, Amarna, City of Akhenaten and Nefertiti (London, 1972), 70 f. 19 For this date, cf. Helck, CdE 44 (1969), 209. 20 Cf. R. Hanke, Amarna-reliefs aus Hermopolis (Hildesheim, 1969), pis. 37 (108-viii C; 650-viii A), no (143- viii A; 143-viii C), 152 (463-viii), 160 (193-viii A), 161 (80-viii), 195 (PC-161). The element following mrt-f is simply n, not irt-n as might be expected (cf. pl. 37; pl. 195 is battered, but appears to read the same). It appears to me to be an indirect genitive construction, linking the entire phrase preceding to the king's name. The blocks on pis. 152, 161 and 195, if not the others, were apparently recarved texts, possibly replacing a formula with Nefertity's name (this is certain in pl. 152). For other scenes in which names and titles of princesses are juxtaposed with those of their father see pis. 43, 53, 105, 200. 21 Sometimes (possibly in texts and reliefs carved after Akhenaten's death), there is no filiation: cf. Hanke, op. cit., pis. 29 (632-viii A), 34 (293-vi B); more often (perhaps under the same conditions), there is only a simple formula involving the mother's name: pis. 14 (311-vi A), 70 (157-viii right), 159 (364-viii), 200 (PC 192, PC 209). Once (pl. 17: 500-viii C) Meretaten minor is directly affiliated to Akhenaten. But the text is palimpsest: the original clearly depicted Meretaten behind Nefertity (cf. pl. 18). In fact not a few of the texts identifying daughters and granddaughters are palimpsest. These seem to be of two kinds: 1. cases in which Meretaten's name is written over an earlier text, and is accompanied by Akhenaten's in a statement of filiation (cf . pis. 152 : 463-viii ; 161 : 80-viii; 195: PC 161), and 2. examples of a granddaughter's name (usually Meretaten minor) superimposed over another, most often in a scene showing one daughter behind mother (cf. pis. 17: 500-viii C; 29: 632-viii A; 18: 340-vi A and 652-viii A; 15; 610-vii). Only rarely (cf. pis. 43: 446-viii and no: 143-viii) do Ankhesenpa-aten and her daughter appear palimpsest. 22 Ibid., pl. 106 (451-vii A). 23 Ibid., pl. 19 (234- vi), 70 (157-viii left). 24 In the block shown in pl. IHb a princess (undoubtedly Meretaten) is qualified as hmt-nsw stt-nsw n ht-f, "king's-wife, king's-daughter of his body;" (sU-hmt-nsw is conceivable, n ht-f being added mechanically because of the presence of nsw). This talatat is presumably the "evidence" referred to of late (cf. E. F. Wente, JNES 28 [1969], 278) for Akhenaten's "marriage" to "one of the two eldest daughters of Nefertity." If the inclusion of the title "king's-wife" in the daughter's titulary is not simply a mistake — and a sculptor's error among the hundreds of repetitions of these stock titles is surely to be expected, especially in view of the ubiquity of titles in which nsw stands first — the text need not be interpreted to mean that a four-year old had entered into a marital relationship with her father: The bestowal upon young children of titles denoting rank, relationships and functions they could not possibly have fulfilled at the time, simply in anticipation of their coming of age, is a practice known the world over. On the occurrence of hmt-nsw with the names of princesses while their father still lived, see Helck, CdE 44 (1969), 22 ff.; B. Van de Walle, CdE 43 (1968), 49ft.; H. te Velde, JEA 57 (1971), 85. It should be noted that the same title is found at Amarna in conjunction with the name of the fourth daughter: Davies, Amarna I, pl. 19. 25 Brunner, ZAS 74 (1939), 104 ff. Surprisingly the patently erroneous interpretation of this kind of formula to prove the paternity of Akhenaten has been kept alive without the slightest suggestion of hesitency by a number of the foremost writers in the field: cf. Desroches-Noblecourt, Tutankhamun (New York &amp; London, 1963), 163, 290; Seele, JNES 14 (1955), 174; Kitchen, Suppiluliuma and the Amarna Pharaohs (Liverpool, 1962), 12, n. 1; Wilson, JNES 32 (1973), 235 f. Helck's observations (CdE 44, 209) are most refreshing in this regard, as are those of Badawy, ZAS 99 (1972), 70. 26 Cf. Helck, loc. cit., who opines that Akhenaten's name was substituted for Nefertity's in the third position of the granddaughter formula only when Nefertity died. 27 Hanke, op. cit., pl. 106 (451-vii C). 28 City of Akhenaten I, pis. 64: 1-2, 63 : 169 (1) ; she also appeared with her husband at the reception of foreign homage: Davies, Amarna III, pl. 13. 29 Cf.

The appearance of Nefertity in the filiation of Ankhesenpa-aten minor, both at Amarna and at Karnak, disproves completely the contention of J. R. Harris that "in the 13th year of the reign of Akhenaten . . . queen Neferneferuaten Nefertiti . . . seems suddenly to dissolve from sight" (GM 4 [1973], 16). But this is not the place to go further into the details of Harri's unusual theory; suffice to say that my colleague, Prof. Sayed Tawfik, has effectively answered Harris in an article to appear shortly in MDAIK.</page><page sequence="7">DONALD B.
