<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Soul Incorporated Nariman Skakov In the chapter on cooperation in Capital, Karl Marx suggests that “man is, if  not as Aristotle contends, a political, at all events a social animal.”1 Aristotle’s  infl uential defi nition of the human being as a zoological entity of the polis pro- foundly infl uenced the ultimate critical analysis of political economy. Unlike  Aristotle, however, Marx addresses the topic of sociality exclusively through  the prism of labor. His reference to zoon politikon is preceded by an extensive  discussion of collective labor in which he argues that “apart from the new  power that arises from the fusion of many forces into one single force, mere  social contact begets in most industries an emulation and a stimulation of the  animal spirits that heighten the effi  ciency of each individual workman.”2 “An- imal spirits,” misleadingly but revealingly translated as zhiznennaia energiia  (vital energy) in the standard Soviet edition of Capital, constitute a notable  rhetorical move:3 Marx, like Aristotle, seems unable to avoid a reference to  the natural, animal world, even as he tries to establish human’s separateness  from it. The animal trope persistently thrusts itself forward in sociopolitical  debates, and “animal spirits” continue to haunt the discursive foundation pit  of the universal proletarian edifi ce. In his classic address to the Soviet Writers’ Congress in 1934, Maksim  Gor ́kii—a key architect of the superstructure of socialist realism—echoes  Marx in his own reference to and interpretation of Aristotle. Gor ́kii altogether  avoids the term political animal in his discussion of the social core of human  life.4 Instead, he concentrates his rhetorical attention on an exception to Aris- totle’s binary set—human (political animal) versus natural animal: “Abstract  thought was indulged in by man at a later period, by that solitary man of  whom Aristotle in his Politics said: ‘Man outside society is either a god, or a  beast.’ Being a beast, he sometimes compelled recognition as a god, but as  With sincere thanks to Evgeny Dobrenko, Jacob Emery, Tatiana Filimonova, Gregory  Freidin, Monika Greenleaf, Ilya Kalinin, Mark Lipovetsky, Harriet Murav, Eric Naiman,  Kevin M.

The very fi rst sentence of Gor ́kii’s address contains a reference to a “two-legged”  (vertikal ́noe) animal that was converted into a man through the practice of labor. Through- out the text he perceives an animal state as something that should be overcome. Gor ́kii’s  treatment of animal life is exemplifi ed by the following passage: “Dostoyevsky has been  called a seeker aft er truth. If he did seek, he found it in the brute and animal instincts of  man, and found it not to repudiate, but to justify. Yes, the animal instincts in mankind  cannot be extirpated so long as bourgeois society contains such a vast number of infl u- ences which arouse the beast in man.” Maksim Gor ́kii, “Soviet Literature,” in H.

It also clearly affi  rms the fact that animal  life was a concern for Soviet policy-makers. More recently, the confl ation of the political sphere with the natural  world, manifested in the fi gure of the political animal, found its further revi- talization in the work of Giorgio Agamben. Agamben emphasizes the classical  Greek distinction between bare, natural life (zoē) and proper, qualifi ed life  (bios). The imminent subjugation of zoē to bios results in a situation in which  a normative framework, governed by the state, is imposed on the natural fl ow  of life. Politics becomes biopolitics, which in turn performs complex acts of  exclusion and inclusion by determining who and what is to be incorporated  into the political body as well as how that incorporation is to take place. Thus,  biopolitics evolves into a natural, though profoundly paradoxical, habitat for  political animals—humans. Andrei Platonov’s Dzhan (Soul, completed 1935) elucidates and compli- cates many aspects of the centuries-old tension between the concepts of hu- man and animal and, by extension, the categories of ideology and corporeal- ity. The novella provides a complex response to materialist doctrines dealing  with humanity’s place in the natural order, for it violates a clear-cut border  between the human and animal realms and takes the question of human- animal fl uidity further than any contemporaneous Soviet texts. This ideologi- cal move also comprises a unique rhetorical gesture in the context of 1930s  Soviet artistic policies, which were largely regulated by the socialist realist  framework. The novella registers the passage of a nomadic “Turkmen” tribe,  the collective hero of the text, from primordial asociality to modernist social- ist unity. Though the small Dzhan nation is presented as a subject of political  control in the fi rst pages, it manages to escape biopolitical categorization: the  people (un)consciously act against the state by reaffi  rming their zoological  essence and their primordial instinct for freedom. Throughout the text, they  enact modernist Marxist ideas about consciousness and labor while simulta- neously manipulating and undermining them. As a result, unequivocal incor- poration into the Soviet political body never takes place. The present article provides an ideological and cultural background for  Platonov’s text by exploring the Bolshevik obsession with what was imagined  to be a fl uid boundary between the animal and the human. Marx’s ardent  followers in the Soviet Union were guilty of the same rhetorical fi xation their  teacher was. As a consequence, symbolic animals populate the Soviet sanc- tuary by permeating the political discourse, as is evident in various texts by  Vladimir Lenin, Iosif Stalin, Lev Trotskii, Andrei Zhdanov, and Gor ́kii. At the  same time, the presence of animals was not merely discursive: the embrace  5.

Theory went together with practice, as the 1920s saw the rapid development  of experimental biology.6 While the Bolshevik vanguard consistently attempted to reaffi  rm evolu- tion as a natural counterpart of Marxist dialectics, the policies of the 1930s  tried to establish clear-cut formulae of dialectic progression, heavily super- vised by the state. The pre-Great Break period of biological experiments, by  and large, came to an end with the birth of Stalinist (bio)politics, which was  concerned more with the manipulation of bios, the qualifi ed life. The enforced  collectivization eff orts not only consolidated individual land, livestock, and  labor into collective farms, they also touched individual physical bodies and  tried to merge them into a collective entity. This corporeal collectivization  profoundly aff ected the ideological landscape of the country: biology, which  guides human responses to stimuli, was replaced by biopolitical structures,  which dictate restrictions on and alterations in how humans ought to carry  out their biological responses. The fact that Trofi m Lysenko’s pseudoscien- tifi c agricultural practices, which emphasized socio-environmental factors  over the biological characteristics of any lifeform, subdued major initiatives  in biology and eugenics is illustrative of the trend. The Stalinist project un- dermined the signifi cance of the individual body and instead concentrated its  discursive attention on the body’s milieu and its links with a greater virtual  whole (the family or lineage). As a consequence of this shift , the classic passage from stikhiinost ́ (spon- taneity) to soznatel ́nost ́ (consciousness), which was initially fuelled by the  animality debate and the biological experimentation of the 1920s, turned into  the rigid biopolitical policy of the 1930s. The latter rejects primordial “ani- mal” instincts, such as survival and self-preservation, through the example  of socialist realist superheroes, who easily overcome the physical limitations  imposed on the human body. Such a policy also discards individual corpore- ality for the sake of the (virtual) collective body and gradually forms a purely  discursive space. It is notable that the ban on abortion and the criminaliza- tion of homosexuality, two key corporeal freedoms, are both instituted in  the mid-1930s—Stalinism’s heyday. Thus, human behavior’s biological bases  are undermined by means of biopolitical practices and replaced by abstract  rhetoric. The opening section of this article, “Spontaneous Consciousness,” links  the classic Soviet clash between spontaneity and consciousness with the 1920s  biological experiments that were intended to deconstruct the animal-human  6.

According  to Krementsov, the blossoming Soviet science in the late 1920s followed the principle of  personal patronage, whereby the role of patron was performed by various state agencies  such as the People’s Commissariat of Public Health (Narkomzdrav) or the People’s Com- missariat for Education (Narkompros).

I also ana- lyze how the totalitarian shift  of the late 1920s and early 1930s aff ected the no- tion of socialist reality, per the state’s interpretation. The second part, “Natu- ral Communism,” shows why Dzhan, one of Platonov’s fi rst earnest attempts  to evolve into a socialist realist writer glorifying the Soviet state’s fi rm strides  toward the communist future, fails to achieve the semantic certitude of the  Stalinist text. Various recurrent and profoundly unconventional themes, of- ten connected with animality and corporeality, signifi cantly muddle the text’s  ideological coordinates and preclude the possibility of a clear passage from  spontaneity to consciousness. I conclude with “Apolitical Animals,” which  discusses the status of the Dzhan people as a newly formed Soviet collective  body. The latter’s (a)political status manifests itself in the complex interplay  between two rather commonplace categories: body and soul. In the course of  the novella the body acquires abstract political qualities by becoming col- lective, while the soul, as both a designator of the Dzhan people and as a  category, gains fl esh. Nazar Chagataev, a graduate of the Moscow School of  Economics, which produces engineers and economists, appears to reify a key  Stalinist metaphor: he becomes an engineer of human (and animal) souls.  However, the newly engineered soul still manages to liberate itself from the  restraining eff orts of the totalitarian state. Spontaneous Consciousness Mikhail Bulgakov’s novella Sobach e ́ serdtse: Chudovishchnaia istoriia (A  Dog’s Heart: An Appalling Story, 1925) is arguably the most renowned liter- ary work to reveal the political tensions of the early Soviet state by means of  animalistic tropes.7 The metaphor of ozverenie (animalization) is materialized  for the reader when the protagonist, Professor Preobrazhenskii, an expert in  rejuvenation and eugenics whose surname literally means “of the Transfi gu- ration,” surgically transfi gures the homeless dog Sharik. He transplants the  pituitary gland and testicles of a dead criminal into the body of the dog and  observes how the latter evolves into a lecherous intriguer who names himself  Poligraf Poligrafovich Sharikov. The doctor is appalled by the outcome of his  experiment and concludes that evolution, as a natural process of change in  the inherited characteristics of biological populations over successive genera- tions, should not be interfered with. The dirty masses will always produce  geniuses in a natural way—a lesson the professor appears to learn over the  course of the novella. Therefore, the violent revolution should never under- mine peaceful evolution. Any artifi cial interference with natural matter could  lead to disaster. Preobrazhenskii, as many critics highlight, is modeled on the famous Rus- sian physiologist Ivan Pavlov.8 The distinguished scientist made several ma- 7.

Most  signifi cant was Pavlov’s ambition to explain human behavior in exclusively  physiological terms, with the nervous system at the center and the cerebral  cortex as the prime distributor and organizer of all of the organism’s activity,  as manifested in the notion of the conditioned refl ex. The human body, ap- proached via experiments on animals, was treated as a neurological rather  than a psychological or spiritual entity. In the lecture “Foundations of the  Culture of Animals and Man,” delivered in 1918, Pavlov acknowledges strik- ing similarities between animal and human behavioral patterns, a conclusion  that was famously obtained through experiments on animal life.9 Il ́ia Ivanov, a distinguished scientist and key player in the sphere of So- viet biology, inspired another notable artistic text exploring human-animal  hybridity. The natural scientist specialized in the fi eld of artifi cial insemina- tion and the interspecifi c hybridization of animals. He traveled to Africa in  1926 to carry out experiments involving the artifi cial insemination of female  chimpanzees with human sperm. Aft er his return to the Soviet Union the  project was slightly modifi ed, as he attempted to inseminate volunteer Soviet  women with the sperm of an orangutan male. The scientist’s experiment in  many ways shaped the creation of Orango (1932), by Dmitrii Shostakovich,  who visited Ivanov’s fully state-funded primate station in Sukhum in 1929.10  The unfi nished three-act opéra bouff e tells the story of Jean Or, the Orango  of the title, who is the result of a French scientist’s successful experiment in  crossbreeding anthropoid mammals with humans. Orango in many respects  crosses discursive paths with Bulgakov’s novella, for it elevates a purely bio- logical issue to the level of ideology.11 9.

Vsevolod Pudovkin’s documentary  fi lm, Mekhanika golovnogo mozga (Mechanics of the Brain, 1926), dismantles the human- animal hierarchy and provides a striking and, at times, shocking illustration of Pavlov’s  studies in classical conditioning (see, for instance, the graphic scene in which a dog is  electrocuted). The fi lm comprises several vignettes that suggest a linear interconnection  between “lower forms of life” (e.g., a frog) and human life (a child), while a dog and a  monkey are used as intermediary entities. 10.

Orango, half-man and half-ape, serves as a soldier in World War I, becomes in- volved in newspaper blackmail and stock market speculation, and then turns into a  powerful international press baron who aggressively promotes the values of capitalism.  However, the remarkable “self-made man” story has a tragic end (for Orango, at least): a  worldwide fi nancial crisis ruins him. The protagonist is betrayed, gradually “degener- ates” fully into an ape, and fi nally is sold by his wife, a Russian émigré and Parisian  coquette, to a Soviet circus for the price of $150. There, in the red capital—happy, new  Moscow, where the action of the opera takes place—he is exhibited for the amusement  of the glorious proletariat.

The scientists undermined the  typical claim of man’s spiritual superiority over nature by treating humans  as “mere” biological bodies.12 This stance found ideological echoes in Lenin’s  Philosophical Notebooks (1915), which designate the “history of the intellectual  development of animals” as one of the fi elds on which “the theory of cogni- tion and dialectics should be based.”13 From the very beginning, animals were  inscribed into the core philosophical concept of the Soviet Union: dialectical  materialism. The absence of a rigid hierarchical boundary between the hu- man and animal realms was crucial for both biologists and Soviet ideologues.  With ease and eagerness, the Soviet identity-building project overcame the  idea that humans occupy an exclusive position in the natural order.14 The  conditioned refl ex and the desired product of hybridization (the missing link  between man and ape) would have confi rmed Darwin’s theory of biological  evolution and provided proof of the Darwinian evolutionary lineage—from an- imals to humans. The sense of continuity was crucial, and the “natural” and  sacred human-animal hierarchy perceived as an obstacle to be overcome. Moreover, Darwin’s gradualist continuism was appropriated not only be- cause of its potential use in antireligious propaganda. Evolutionary biology  was also believed to remove the boundaries between species and advance  notions of natural selection and modifi cation by descent. The latter thus make  a case for historical development in nature. In 1861 Marx stressed, “Darwin’s  work is most important and suits my purpose in that it provides a basis in  natural science for the historical class struggle.”15 Darwinism justifi ed Marx- ism, which can be understood as a Darwinist historical project culminating  12. Eric Naiman, in his book Sex in Public, draws attention to Emmanuil Enchmen’s  rather bizarre notion of “physiological passports,” conceived in the early 1920s and in- spired, in part, by Pavlov’s experiments. These “passports” were supposed to numeri- cally refl ect bodily functions, pleasures, and desires and treated their bearers as mere  “organisms.” For Enchmen, the human being was nothing but a biological entity that had  to be regulated by means of a physiological “ration card.” Eric Naiman, Sex in Public: The  Incarnation of Early Soviet Ideology (Princeton, 1997), 76–77. 13.

Konstantin Tsiolkovskii, Vladimir Vernadskii, and Aleksandr  Chizhevskii did manage to fi nd points of contiguity with the Soviet project.

The dismantling of biological hierarchies’  sanctity and the sense of biological continuity, then, have signifi cant ideo- logical consequences, and Soviet policymakers seem to have understood that.  As Sergei Novikov, a Soviet bureaucrat who helped Ivanov secure state fund- ing for his project, suggested, the hybridization project was an “exclusively  important problem for Materialism.”16 A few years later, the presidium of the  Communist Academy unambiguously proclaimed that “only the proletariat is  the sole heir to the materialist foundations of Darwinism.”17 But more impor- tantly, Stalin himself, in his then canonical “Dialectical and Historical Mate- rialism” of 1938, quotes Friedrich Engels’s description of Darwin as someone  who delivers a “blow to the metaphysical conception of nature” by viewing  the organic world in its continuous development.18 Pavlov’s biological experiments on animals and Ivanov’s endeavors in  the fi eld of artifi cial insemination and human-animal hybridization in many  ways served as precursors to the ultimate human experimentation: the So- viet brand of eugenics, propagated by Nikolai Kol t ́sov, Iurii Filipchenko, and  Aleksandr Serebrovskii. Studies of genealogical relation between species and  heredity in mammals proved to be the ultimate foundation for the practice  of improving the genetic quality of the Soviet population. As Mark B. Adams  puts it, “Ivanov’s zootekhnika was almost certainly the inspiration for Sere- brovskii’s antropotekhnika”—the latter being used as a synonym for eugenics  in Russia.19 The Soviet science of human betterment primarily focused not so much  on physical characteristics but on creative talents: musical, mathematical,  and artistic abilities. Nevertheless, the science of the human gene turned out  to be too corporeal for Stalinism. The year 1930 saw the sudden end of So- viet eugenics, with the Russian Eugenics Society disbanded and the Eugen- ics Section of the Institute of Experimental Biology abolished. Eugenics was  proclaimed bourgeois and linked with the fascist Rassenhygiene. It was also  accused of being anti-Marxist, for it ignored the social environment and over- emphasized biology.20 The relative autonomy of the scientifi c community and  the daring experiments of the 1920s were replaced by strict state control and  organisms.” Andrei Platonov, Sochineniia: Nauchnoe izdanie, ed.

More importantly, Lysenkoism represented a move toward highly politi- cized science, which revealed a divorce from objective reality. Lysenko accom- plished a leap into the realm of fi ction: his suppression of animal biologists  and human geneticists is highly symbolic, as inanimate plants replaced hu- man and animal fl esh. Moreover, the “militant materialism” of the Commu- nist Academy resulted in attacks on scientifi c opponents on purely ideologi- cal rather than scientifi c grounds.22 This combative practice developed into  a widely accepted custom within Stalinist science, which was concerned not  with the search for objective truth but with adhering to ideological dogmas.  As a consequence, the verb biologizirovat ́ (to biologize) became a pejorative  term standing for any attempts to explain social phenomena by means of bi- ology.23 An abstract collective proletarian body entered the scene, and pure  ideology replaced (corpo)reality. While Stalinist science tried to transform reality by means of strict dis- cipline and planned economy, it lapsed into the domain of pseudoscience  and obsession with the imaginary, abstract realm of exaggerated statistics.  A similar progression from the real toward ideological abstraction can be de- tected in the development of a key category of Soviet Marxism: the passage  from stikhiinost ́ toward soznatel ́nost . ́ In the course of its development, from  Lenin’s writing in the early twentieth century to its heyday in Stalinist so- cialist realism, this opposition reveals the ultimate leap from reality to the  unreal and pure fi ction.24 The necessity for the move from spontaneity toward  consciousness, at the time it was conceived by Lenin and Stalin in the early  twentieth century, was justifi ed by a real cause: preparation for the revolu- tion. Stalinism, having already accomplished the task of revolution, pushed  the binary into the artistic realm. The discourse of transformation acquired a  purely speculative function. Historically, the dialectic clash of the two was, according to Katerina  21. Trofi m D. Lysenko, Agrobiologiia: Raboty po voprosam genetiki, selektsii i semeno- vodstva (Moscow, 1946), 395.

However, in “Estranged Labour” he provides  an illuminating passage that clearly elevates the problem of worker’s class  consciousness to the level of animal versus human and, by extension, that  of spontaneity versus consciousness: “The animal is immediately identical  with its life-activity. It does not distinguish itself from it. It is its life-activity.  Man makes his life-activity itself the object of his will and of his conscious- ness. He has conscious life-activity. . . . His own life is an object for him. Only  because of that is his activity free activity. Estranged labor reverses this rela- tionship, so that it is just because man is a conscious being that he makes his  life-activity, his essential being, a mere means to his existence.”26 The alleged  lack of self-refl exivity and volition in animals is counterpoised with the con- scious human volitional act. However, estranged labor turns the proletarian  into an exploited animal, for it transforms human labor from a “conscious  life-activity” into a “mere means” for existence. The solution lies in regain- ing consciousness and challenging the capitalist system of production. This  socioeconomic premise became Lenin’s political mantra. The spontaneity- consciousness dyad, as “two poles of the primary dialectic of historical de- velopment,” developed into a major cultural category in Lenin’s writings, and  they justifi ed the transformation of backward rural Russia into an aspiring  communist society.27 Stikhiinost ́ (from stikhiia, a natural element) has strong  connotations of the “blind forces of nature,” which have an ambivalent po- tential, at once creative and destructive. These natural forces are meant to  be “tamed” by means of soznatel ́nost , ́ which was understood to reside pri- marily in the minds of the political vanguard, representatives of the Russian  intelligentsia. That is, the vanguard of the party was supposed to master the  elemental ignorance of the masses.28 According to Lenin, in What Is to Be Done? (1902), the forces of spontane- ity are always already in place as natural elements, while consciousness is  rendered largely as a potentiality, something more ephemeral. The passage  from the former to the latter fi nds its synthetic culmination in history’s ulti- mate end—that is, in communism.

There is an apparent link between spontaneity-consciousness and psychoana- lytic practices; in the latter, a patient achieves a conscious state and thus redeems the  repressed trauma. This is evident in the following quotation from Trotskii’s Literature and  Revolution: “Finally, the nature of man himself is hidden in the deepest and darkest cor- ner of the unconscious, of the elemental, of the subsoil. . . . Man will make it his purpose  to master his own feelings, to raise his instincts to the heights of consciousness, to make  them transparent, to extend the wires of his will into hidden recesses and thereby to raise  himself to a new plane.” Leon Trotsky, Literature and Revolution, trans.

The described artifi cial shortcut from animal spontaneity to pro- letarian consciousness clearly manifests itself in Orango and A Dog’s Heart.  The animals in Shostakovich’s opera and Bulgakov’s novella are artifi cially  inoculated with sentience-consciousness (soznatel ́nost ́) by the representa- tives of the scientifi c, though antirevolutionary, vanguard. The experiments  have disastrous consequences and jeopardize the possibility of fulfi lling the  Hegelian synthetic (that is, artifi cial) fusion. Animals are inscribed into so- cialist dialectics, but nature prevails. This type of transformation, however, is vigorously challenged in Plato- nov’s texts, in which animals and people driven to the animal state develop  consciousness in a natural way; that is, they gain something that can be  termed, in Platonov’s own words, spontaneous consciousness.32 The necessity  for representatives of the intelligentsia class to introduce consciousness into  the proletarian body, as conceived by Lenin and Stalin, is dramatically ma- nipulated by Platonov. In his early essay “Golova proletariata” (The Head of  the Proletariat) Platonov emphasizes the fact that the proletariat already has  a strong, healthy body and its next step must be “to create a head for itself,  to construct it on its own body [vystroit ́ ee na sebe].”33 The narrative line of  the later novella Dzhan describes such a do-it-yourself attempt.

This rather unconventional story provides an original commentary on  Stalinist biopolitical practices.34 Natural Communism Dzhan, if reduced to its narrative core, is a story about the process of building  communism in one isolated desert. The novella’s protagonist, Nazar Chaga- taev, is the child of an extramarital aff air between Giul c ́hatai, a married Turk- men woman, and Ivan, a Russian soldier in the Khiva expeditionary force.  The wretched mother, unable to provide for her son, is obliged to send him  away, but the boy is saved by a shepherd and then sent to a Soviet orphanage.  Born in Sary-Kamysh and educated in Moscow, the adult Chagataev is sent  back to the Turkmen desert to reclaim his native nation of outcasts for the pur- poses of building communism. Before his departure from the capital, he mar- ries a divorced and already pregnant Russian woman named Vera and adopts  her adolescent daughter, Ksenia. The protagonist’s return to his mother and  motherland is marked by scenes of extreme physical devastation and suff er- ing. The people of the Dzhan nation, aft er wandering in the open space of the  desert, fi nally settle down with the aid of Chagataev, who ultimately merges  with their collective body and shares in their misery and anguish. It is notable that there are three variations of the text’s ending: the version  abridged by Soviet editors, which describes the dispersal of the Dzhan people  aft er Chagataev’s failed attempt to collectivize them; the writer’s original end- ing, which adds to this Chagataev’s return to Moscow together with the Turk- men girl Aidym and his reunion with Ksenia, who survives her mother; and  the extended third redaction, which depicts the hero setting off  to bring the  people together only to fi nd out that they have reunited of their own accord,  and aft er this revelation he leaves for Moscow with Aidym. This last version  can be considered a somewhat happy socialist realist ending: the people settle  themselves, and the younger generation, represented by Aidym and Ksenia,  continues along the road toward Soviet enlightenment.

Viewed in this light, Dzhan’s narrative line reveals a standard socialist re- alist antagonism. The required Soviet Stalinist aesthetic foremostly manifests  itself through the clash between two party representatives who are given the  same task: to save the group of marginalized vagabonds from total oblivion  and to bring them back into the great Soviet family. The two professional revo- lutionaries, per Lenin and Stalin’s precepts, are meant to represent the avant- garde of the working class, whose goal is to educate the masses and assist  them on their path toward communism. However, the confl ict between the  two lacks a clear ideological resolution. While the text off ers a negative por- trayal of one of the “messengers” (Nur-Mokhammed), the main hero (Chaga- taev) fails to accomplish his mission in a conventional sense in the original  ending, and his relative success in the later redaction is not attributable to his  conscious eff orts, for the people gather of their own accord. Nur-Mokhammed, a person sent by the district executive committee, is ar- guably the ultimate representative of deleterious individualism, an alien who  does not belong to the collective body of the Dzhan. The “accredited offi  cial”  carries a leather briefcase and is the only person who keeps his clothes intact  and looks “at people with the eyes of a stranger.”35 He expresses his inner  doubts to Nazar with no hesitation, maintaining that “the nation’s heart had  long been exhausted by need, while its mind had grown stupid, leaving the  nation with no way of sensing its happiness.” The absence of consciousness is  the natural condition of the Dzhan people, and the “vanguard representative”  considers it a futile project even to attempt to save them: “Better to give peace  to this nation, to forget it forever or else lead it somewhere into the desert, into  the steppes and mountains, so it would get lost and could then be considered  not to exist.”36 Nur-Mokhammed fi nally confesses that as he cannot resurrect  the dead, he simply waits for the remaining people to perish. The Dzhan peo- ple’s state of existence is so miserable that they no longer seem to constitute  subjects capable of communist transformation, or even of life itself. At a later point in the novella, the party ideologue and demagogue does  attempt to speed up the process of the Dzhan people’s extinction by literally  unsettling them: his “leadership” abilities fi nd their application when he  guides the nation into the open space of the desert. As Nur-Mokhammed puts  it, “They need somewhere or other to head for. I’m taking them the long way,  around the edge of the delta. A man feels better when he’s on the move.”37  Their futile move, combined with proximity to or even incorporation into hos- tile nature, results in their entering a borderline state, which is marked by  tropes of emptiness and desert/-ion: “People’s bodies had become empty and  their hearts had gradually perished.”38 35.

Nature triumphs and epistemic categories are rendered  irrelevant as the nation merges with the natural fl ow of an existence that is  devoid of any intellectual refl ection: it enters a state of samotek (natural drift ).  Chagataev, as the positive counterpart to Nur-Mokhammed, halts the process  of unsettling—aimless wandering in the desert—by bringing his nation to a  conscious state and leading them out of the empty wilderness. Half-alien and  half-native, he is the ideal medium to accomplish the task given to him by the  central apparatus. Although Nazar initially merges with his unconscious na- tion through immense physical endurance in the open desert, he regains his  Bolshevik consciousness and manages to realize his true calling from within  the depths of his despair while being attacked by vultures: “He felt as if he  belonged to others, as if he were the last possession of those who have no  possessions, about to be squandered to no purpose, and he was seized by the  greatest, most vital fury of his life.”39 In truly Marxist materialist fashion, the  question of property—his mutilated body as his very last commodity—informs  the protagonist’s political consciousness. Chagataev rises to fi ght against wild  nature, in this instance represented by vultures. It is evident that Chagataev’s mission is one of cultivation. His revolution- ary task is to bring culture from Moscow and transform the archaic, animalis- tic elements, as represented by the Dzhan people. The word culture, deriving  from the Latin colere (to tend, to guard, to cultivate, to till), has strong connec- tions with agriculture, the cultivation of land and domestication of wild ani- mals. Culture is a pure superstructural extension of the material base which  manifests itself in the process of land cultivation. The nomadic way of life  naturally problematizes the notion of (settled) culture, for there is literally no  stable ground that can be cultivated or understood as a point of departure.  The Dzhan nomads, in order to become a part of the Soviet family, must be  settled, their ceaseless wandering halted, and their natural and uncultivated  state altered. As the geographer Yi-Fu Tuan puts it, “Domestication means domination:  the two words have the same root sense of mastery over another being—of  bringing it into one’s house or domain.”40 The process of domestication—the  taming of wild elements—is manifestly at work in Platonov’s novella. Chaga- taev exercises his spiritual and physical power to domesticate the unculti- vated Dzhan people. In place of unconscious wandering in the open desert,  they are given an opportunity to start building communism in their native  land. However, as a starting point, the future builders require their own shel- ter and they are bestowed one by their new leader, who brings them to their  fi rst Soviet domus—a space where domestication can take place. When Chagataev and Aidym start fetching clay to build the fi rst house,  no one off ers any help; the Dzhan people are indiff erent to the eff orts to lay  the foundations of a settled dwelling space. But the leader challenges them:  39. Ibid., 94. 40.

Eventually, Chagataev brings his people  back to a conscious state by means of the example and practice of labor. Aft er  some time, Old Ivan, the one ethnic Russian among them, fi nally joins Chaga- taev’s eff orts in laying down the foundation of the future communal home.  The collective process of communist construction fi nally begins. Labor in general, whether voluntary or forced, is a fundamental category  for the process of communist construction. There is a truly Marxist echo in  the notorious Nazi motto “Work makes one free” as well as in Vissarion Be- linskii’s famous dictum “Work ennobles man.” For Marx and Engels, “men  can be distinguished from animals by consciousness, by religion or anything  else you like. They themselves begin to distinguish themselves from animals  as soon as they begin to produce their means of subsistence, a step which is  conditioned by their physical organisation.”42 The Dzhan’s construction ef- forts, though primitive in essence, are key to their becoming a conscious com- munist nation and distinguishing themselves from the wild natural elements.  Chagataev takes care of their “physical organization,” and the nation builds  “four small houses of adobe brick, with a common surrounding wall” in a val- ley in the Ustiurt Plateau, their new, elevated dwelling space.43 It is not an accident that one of the key Soviet cultural policymakers, An- drei Zhdanov, in an oft -quoted passage that lies at the heart of the socialist  realist paradigm, fuses the rhetoric of labor with a peculiar reference to ani- mality, evoking the passage from spontaneity to consciousness: In our country the main heroes of works of literature are the active builders  of a new life—working men and women, men and women collective farmers,  Party members, business managers, engineers, members of the Young Com- munist League, Pioneers. Such are the chief types and the chief heroes of  our Soviet literature. Our literature is impregnated with enthusiasm and the  spirit of heroic deeds. It is optimistic, but not optimistic in accordance with  any “inward,” animal [zoologicheskomu] instinct. It is optimistic in essence,  because it is the literature of the rising class of the proletariat, the only pro- gressive and advanced class. Our Soviet literature is strong by virtue of the  fact that it is serving a new cause—the cause of socialist construction.44 According to Zhdanov’s rhetoric, real actions and especially labor practices  inspire the fi ctional reality of Soviet art. Heroic and self-sacrifi cing eff orts to  construct a new socialist society are the sole themes of socialist realist litera- 41. Platonov, “Soul,” 102. 42.

This enthusiasm appears to be  metaphysical; that is, lying beyond the physical realm and oriented toward a  future that is, paradoxically, being built right now, at this very moment.45 It also  registers the passage from natural, base spontaneity (the mode of the past) to  more abstract consciousness (that of the present and future). Zhdanov’s com- ments clearly demonstrate the transformation of the individual body of Soviet  bare life into the abstract collective body of Stalinist biopolitics. The Dzhan people fi nd themselves making this conversion in a mode that  to some extent refl ects the socialist realist template. The nation, members of  which formerly lived in individual dugouts or under the open sky, participates  in the construction of socialist edifi ces and subsequently enters them as a col- lective body. And this is where their domestication and cultivation, both of  which are oriented toward the glorious future, take place: “These dwellings— without windows, since there was no glass—became the home of the entire  nation, who for the fi rst time had found a proper shelter from the wind, the  cold, and all the little creatures that fl y and sting. Some people were unable  to get used to sleeping and living behind blind walls; aft er short intervals of  time they would go outside, breathe deeply, have a good look at nature, and  return with a sigh back into their homes.”46 Their passage, though positive in  essence, clearly reveals the trauma of transfer from the domain of nature to  that of culture. Walls are described as “blind,” though they shelter the people  from the hostile desert. There are no windows—conventional architectural  elements that create an illusion of unity with nature. The building becomes  a womb, a cocoon from which future life should spring. In addition to hope,  however, these buildings also bring a feeling of claustrophobia, the fear of  entrapment in a small space. Entering into the solid edifi ce is a traumatic ex- perience for some members of the Dzhan tribe, for they cannot endure being  separated from the open realm of nature and feel the need to go outside from  time to time to regain their (natural) sense of selfh ood. Here their experience  echoes György Lukács’s description of estrangement from nature as “a projec- tion of man’s experience of his self-made environment as a prison instead of  as a parental home.”47 This sense of entrapment is surmounted at a later point, when the Dzhan  people disperse throughout the open space of the desert and beyond. How- ever, this dramatic resolution is preceded by acts of collective eating and  45.

The principal building in Platonov’s oeuvre is arguably the  uncompleted proletarian house of Kotlovan.

Aft er receiving an abundant food parcel from Tashkent, consisting  of two trucks of produce and other necessities, the Dzhan make several meals  that are consumed at one communal table. The scene is described with tender  intimacy infused with communist vocabulary: “They ate without greed, tak- ing care of the food in their mouths, with a consciousness of the food’s neces- sity and with meek thoughtfulness.” Several days later, in cooler weather, the  Dzhan people all gather in one house, like a herd or a pack: “By six o’clock the  entire nation had lain down in the one room, and people were sleeping beside  one another in close-packed bliss.”48 The collective body of the Dzhan sleeps  continuously in the same position for two days and two nights. When the peo- ple fi nally get up—with the exception of Giul c ́hatai, Chagataev’s mother, who  has died in her sleep—they have a fi nal meal together and depart their Soviet  domus during the night. The episode in which the Dzhan people leave the socialist edifi ce built for  them is the conclusion of the novella’s fi rst published version.49 In a radical  manner, the characters evade domestication. What is arguably at stake for  the Dzhan people is the preservation of their freedom, unrestrained mobility,  and alterity. Their leader, Chagataev, tries to settle them, to stop their cease- less motion in space and bring them as a homogenized nation into the grand  Soviet domus, yet they willfully reject this gesture of external, totalizing help.  As Chagataev painfully realizes, they do “not need communism.” Instead,  his nation needs “oblivion—until the wind [has] chilled its body and slowly  squandered it in space.”50 The Dzhan people disperse in the open space of the  desert and are gone with the wind. The role of the wind assumes added signifi cance when one considers the  fact that the word animal is a cognate of the Greek άνεμος (ánemos, wind) and  bears an etymological link to the Latin animalis (animate, living, or of the  air).51 Animal nature, then, fi nds in its roots one of the basic natural elements:  wind, the natural cause of animation. The latter is given a prominent place in  the novella during a key episode in which the Dzhan people fi nd themselves  wandering in the desert: “Sheep, the Dzhan nation, and wild animals—this  triple procession was moving in orderly fashion through the desert. But the  sheep sometimes strayed from their grassy path and followed a wandering  tumbleweed as it was driven about by the wind—and so the universal guid- ing force, of everything from plants to humans, was really the wind.”52 The  wind appears to be the ultimate driving force of the Dzhan people: it scatters,  displaces, and, most importantly, liberates them.53 Moreover, the wind is the  48. Platonov, “Soul,” 112–13. 49. The dramatic dispersal of the people toward the end echoes the beginning of  Dzhan, when the narrator describes Chagataev’s classmates at a graduation party in the  following manner: “The young people sat at the tables, ready to go their separate ways out  into the land around them and build happiness for themselves there.” Ibid., 5. 50.

Chagataev initially nourishes the people’s bodies and minds by sacrifi cing his  own fl esh during his hunt for vultures, and he later settles them by building  adobe houses from natural elements found around Sary-Kamysh. In a sense,  the people, together with Chagataev, merge with the natural landscape and  come to embody nature, such as when they eat the raw meat of various ani- mals or try to quench their thirst by eating moist sand. The Bolshevik mes- senger seems to understand that in order to accomplish his communist quest,  he must take advantage of the powers aff orded only by nature; in this he sub- stantially departs from prescribed party directives. Even much earlier in the novella, Chagataev’s return to Turkmenia from  Moscow is marked by an unexpected move: while nominally “having forgot- ten his mission,” the protagonist enters his homeland by leaving the train of  modernity and merging with the natural realm. He enters the wilderness spon- taneously, leaving behind not only the train but also his luggage and papers  within it. He returns to his native land with no belongings whatsoever, just  as he left  it a dozen years prior. In this moment of transition, nature begins to  reveal itself through multiple sounds and smells, and as if enchanted by des- ert sirens, the hero sets off  into an open space inhabited by multiple “unseen  creatures.” In the middle of his wandering, he encounters a camel: Chagataev,  “full of astonishment at strange reality,” realizes that there is no hierarchy of  beings and that “the desert’s deserted emptiness, the camel, even the pitiful  wandering grass—all this ought to be serious, grand and triumphant.”57 Kara-Kum has strong winds at a velocity of 15 meters per second and up, while the Ustiurt  is subject to squall winds of 24–26 meters per second.

Hans Günther provides an exhaustive taxonomy of animal  imagery in the writer’s oeuvre, from anthropomorphic animals to “degenerat- ing” humans.58 The amalgamation of human and animal elements, however,  does not just represent the blurring of the line between the two modes of be- ing, as Günther implies. It also has essential ideological consequences.59 The  new Soviet man, as conceptualized during the early Soviet period, was in need  of a new body, and the two opposite semantic vectors of anthropomorphism  and zoomorphism annihilated the old corporeal framework. Moreover, the  conceptual clarity of totalitarianism was challenged by Platonov’s obscure  natural nomenclature, which unleashed, to use Jacques Derrida’s words, “an  existence that refuses to be conceptualized.”60 The transformation from human into animal in Dzhan, then, culminates  in a semantic and ideological dissonance. The human-animal divide, and by  extension, the physiological-spiritual boundary, is an artifi cial construct, and  Platonov’s text underlines its arbitrariness.61 The return to base animality and  corporeality by an individual can be read as a rejection of the abstract collec- tive body of the Stalinist state, which suppresses zoological impulses.

While Chagataev at one point encounters  a camel “sitting like a human being, propped up on his front legs in a drift  of  sand,” the Dzhan people, including the hero’s mother, Giul c ́hatai, crawl on  all fours during their journey through the desert.64 The degenerating humans  enter the fi eld of unmediated nature, while animals gain consciousness and  strive toward communal (communist) cohabitation by merging (collectiviz- ing) into herds and fl ocks and establishing close familial ties. The animals  achieve a truly political status, unlike their human counterparts.65 Indeed, animals seem to develop proletarian class consciousness in a nat- ural way. They do not need the domesticating impositions of culture. Whereas  the protagonist consistently attempts to domesticate the Dzhan people, who  are estranged from one another, animals seek human companionship and  willingly enter the human domus.66 Sheep, for instance, wander in circles in  the desert while desperately trying to fi nd not just nourishment and water but  also a human master with a shepherd dog.67 It is a sense of companionship with animals, too, that underscores Chaga- taev’s communally oriented enthusiasm. Once the project of domestication is  accomplished and the hero fi nally has some spare time, he brings sleeping  tortoises into one of the houses of his newly founded Soviet village. Some of  the tortoises revive, seeming to come back to life, while others remain asleep,  waiting for summer. A piercingly intimate tone prevails in the following pas- sage, in which Chagataev, contemplating animal life, seems to realize the  grand mystery of existence: Chagataev sensed with surprise that it is possible to exist with only animals  and voiceless plants as your neighbors, with desert on the horizon, so long  as you have a human being in a dwelling nearby, even if that human being is  only a child like Aidym. . . . Surely not every animal and plant could be sad  bourgeois and something that ought to be overcome by proletarian consciousness.

Other striking examples of politically conscious animals in Platonov’s oeuvre in- clude the bear Misha, who hunts kulaks, and the horses who collectivize themselves in  Kotlovan.

Otherwise one would have to assume  that true enthusiasm lies only in the human heart—and such an assumption  is worthless and empty, since the blackthorn is imbued with a scent, and the  eyes of a tortoise with a thoughtfulness, that signify the great inner worth  of their existence, a dignity complete in itself and needing no supplement  from the soul of a human being. They might require a helping hand from  Chagataev, but they had no need whatsoever for superiority, condescension  or pity.68 Enthusiasm is not a solely human category: it can also be found outside the  domain of the human soul. A “dignity complete in itself” is an inherent qual- ity of fl ora and fauna. Like Chagataev’s nation, the animal-natural world sim- ply needs a “helping hand” to be fully capable of happiness and a dignifi ed,  free existence. Although the fl at space of the desert annihilates all conceptual  hierarchies, making it possible for the Bolshevik messenger to dwell among  speechless animals and plants, Platonov nevertheless underlines the neces- sity of human camaraderie, even if the companion is “only a child like Aidym.”  This stance echoes the very ending of the text: in the last sentence, Chagataev  realizes, while feeling Ksenia’s soul through the hurried beating of her heart,  “that help could come to him only from another human being.”69 This loop  reestablishes an anthropocentric point of view: politics and ideology cannot  do away with the importance of human companionship. Apolitical Animals The ontological need for the other, which lies at the heart of human compan- ionship, is key to Aristotle’s defi nition of man as a “political animal” (ζω̨ ̃ον  πολιτικόν). In book 1 of Politics he writes, “It is evident that the state is a cre- ation of nature, and that man is by nature a political animal. And he who  by nature and not by mere accident is without a state, is either a bad man  or above humanity; he is like the ‘Tribeless, lawless, heartless one,’ whom  Homer denounces—the natural outcast is forthwith a lover of war; he may  be compared to an isolated piece at draughts.”70 It is remarkable that in two  sentences, meant to delineate the realm of politics and culture from that of  nature, the very word nature (phusis) and its derivative natural occur four  times. Just as the city-state is natural because it fi nds its origins in primitive  natural associations such as village communities and serves as their ultimate  end, so, too, “man is by nature a political animal”—that is, an animal of the  polis (city-state) or a social being, who naturally wants to live together with  his peers. Moreover, human beings are endowed by nature with speech and  are able to communicate moral concepts and laws that lie at the core of every  city-state.71 68. Platonov, “Soul,” 119–20. 69.

Aristotle’s sociality is a necessity or a natural condition, but it is implemented  by a volitional act and the craft  of lawmaking. The philosopher’s political  naturalism clearly positions human society against the horizon of zoological  life in its totality. At the same time, this horizon becomes a vertical line rep- resenting the hierarchical division between the natural animal world and the  artifi cially created city-state. However, the exceptional case of the “tribeless,  lawless, heartless one” muddles this already precarious taxonomy. This state- less—that is, apolitical—animal is “either a bad man or above humanity” and  thus is situated beneath and at the same time beyond the state structure.72 Aristotle’s muddled taxonomy of beings is one of the main concerns  within the discourse of sacred life initiated by Giorgio Agamben. In Homo  Sacer Agamben emphasizes the ancient Greek distinction between zoē and  bios. The former stands for “the simple fact of living common to all living be- ings (animals, men, or gods),” while the latter is more abstract and comprises  “a way of living proper to an individual or a group.”73 In the classical world,  simple natural life (zoē), seen to have a primarily reproductive function, is  excluded from the domain of the polis and instead confi ned to the sphere of  the home (oikos). Bios, on the other hand, has a clear moral dimension and  is a subject to regulation by the state. The subjugation of zoē to bios, accord- ing to Aristotle and as described through Agamben’s lens, is the end goal for  political animals, defi ned by being “born with regard to life, but existing es- sentially with regard to the good life.”74 Each individual’s trajectory from the  natural life to the “good life” is governed by nomos, a set of provisional codes  dictating social and political behavior. This normative framework is crucial  for the polis and becomes the ultimate concern within the sphere of politics.  Seen in this light, Stalin’s notorious 1935 statement that “life has become bet- ter” and “merrier” clearly marks the Soviet passage from zoē to bios, from a  natural life to the good life. What is more important for the present reading of Dzhan is Agamben’s  suggestion that politics is in fact biopolitics, in which the state makes norma- tive decisions concerning not only bios—human life in the political sphere— but also zoē—how citizens should live naturally as corporeal beings.75 Mecha- facts.

By law in the Roman empire, people who  committed a certain kind of crime were banned from society and their rights  as citizens revoked. Such a citizen thus became a Homo sacer (sacred man)  and could be killed by anybody, while his life, paradoxically, was deemed  “sacred,” so he could not be sacrifi ced in a ritual ceremony. The political and  spiritual status represented by this life is profoundly paradoxical, for it “is  not a piece of animal nature without any relation to law and the city. It is,  rather, a threshold of indistinction and of passage between animal and man,  physis and nomos, exclusion and inclusion: the life of the bandit [or of the  Homo sacer] is the life of the loup garou, the werewolf, who is precisely neither  man nor beast, and who dwells paradoxically within both while belonging to  neither.”76 The political status of an outlaw—a person without a state, which  is essentially what the Dzhan people are—makes one inhabit the “threshold of  indistinction.” The Dzhan, who are defi ned as “runaways and orphans from  everywhere, and old, exhausted slaves who had been cast out,” become per- manent refugees who are forced to dwell on the verge of everlasting indistinc- tion.77 They are pure and impure at the same time. They are bodies without  civil rights but with a clear ideological and metaphysical potential, and their  sacredness is revealed in the very name of Dzhan, or soul.78 More importantly,  the Dzhan people can indeed be killed without any legal consequences, as the  khan of Khiva, in an episode from Chagataev’s childhood, uses them as politi- cal scapegoats. Aft er failing to track down real criminals, he orders “everyone  obscure and nameless to be seized, so that the inhabitants of Khiva, seeing  the torture and execution of these people, would acquire fear and trembling.”  Thus, the Dzhan, who “grew used to waiting for death,” become sacrifi cial  elements for the state apparatus, yet remain immune to being recognized by  that state as rightful citizens.79 However, something inexplicable happens when all the remaining mem- bers of the desperate nation set off  toward Khiva. The people seem to have  nothing to lose and are described as “happy and peaceful, equally ready to  destroy the khanate or to say good-bye to their own lives.” The lack of fear  of death bewilders the khan and his guards, who “watched in astonishment  as this transient nation passed proudly past them, not afraid of the power of  bullets or steel, as if they were people of happiness and standing.” This epi- sode transforms the Dzhan people from scapegoats into untouchables. In the  Khiva bazaar the vagabond nation begins “to take the diff erent fruits and to  eat its fi ll without money, while the merchants stood by in silence, not fi ght- ing off  these rapacious strangers.”80 The “transient nation” again fi nds itself  Homo Sacer, 124.

Throughout the text, Platonov consistently exposes the double bind in  which human subjects fi nd themselves. The Dzhan’s transition from apolitical  to political status, and from the natural, animal realm to the cultural, human  one, is never fi nal. Rather, it demonstrates a process of oscillation between  two poles, and this is the locus of the ultimate deconstruction of Stalinist  discourse and its rigid polarities, which were violently imposed on the inhab- itants of the Soviet state. Dzhan shows that the freedom to oscillate cannot be  taken from the people, for it is naturally embedded. Nazar Chagataev real- izes this ultimate truth when he sets off  in search of his dispersed nation and  meets the old man Suf ́ian in the house of a doutar maker. Then Chagataev asked him what had happened to their Dzhan tribe. “They’ve gone their diff erent ways, Nazar, each of them has gone off   on his own to live,” said Sufyan. “The nation didn’t have the strength to go  anywhere before, but you fed it—so off  it wandered.” “But why?” Chagataev asked in surprise. “The nation will lose all its  strength again!” “The nation’s doing what it has to do,” answered Sufyan. “And when it’s  been away long enough, it will go back to the Ust-Yurt.” “But where have they all gone?” “I didn’t ask,” said Sufyan. “They’ve got minds of their own.”81 The suprasocialist task appears already to have been achieved by Chagataev:  the people have gained the strength to live on their own. Their natural volition  is respected, for “the nation’s doing what it has to do” and “they’ve got minds  of their own.” Their uninhibited act of evasion signifi es a resistance to to- talizing ideology: the Dzhan people refuse to become political animals—that  is, subjects of biopolitical practices and strict categorization. Instead, they  evolve into truly apolitical animals, with the uncultivated Turkmen desert as  their natural habitat. Members of the nation fi nd themselves suspended be- tween several sets of extreme polarities: between nature and artifi ce, base  animality and the repudiation of corporeality through intense physical en- durance, and the complete absence of any system of kinship and a transcen- dent collectivity. The beginning of the novella, for instance, depicts the Dzhan people as  thoroughly asocial animals lacking any emotion: Chagataev’s mother indiff er- ently banishes her young son and shows almost total apathy upon his return  as a grown man; blind Molla Cherkezov does not care whether he lives with  a donkey or a wife; even the child Aidym—the hope for the socialist future— has eyes that seem not to see and shows no attachment to her father when  Chagataev takes her away from her home. The tension between emotional im- potence (lack of care for each other) and a natural tendency toward collectiv- ity culminates in a clash between the asocial condition of the people and the  socialist agenda that they are encouraged to implement. The overall “degen- eration” of the Dzhan people is redeemed toward the end of the novella—or, to  81. Ibid., 132–33. </page> <page sequence="24"> Soul Incorporated 795 be more precise, toward the end of the extended version, when the “isolated  pieces at draughts” merge into a single collective body and become a sacred  socialist nation.82 In his History of Animals, Aristotle defi nes a “political ani- mal” as one that has “some one common activity” or function (almost akin to  Nikolai Fedorov’s concept of obshchee delo).83 The “politically correct” ending  appears to turn the asocial animals of the Dzhan nation into truly socialist  political animals by endowing them with the common task of building com- munism. The sense that they become part of the great socialist supranation  becomes apparent in an offi  cial recognition of Chagataev’s mission, which  states that “happiness always takes on a large dimension; it is equivalent to  the whole of socialism.”84 “The whole of socialism” is a blessed state: a supranational condition, a  proletarian paradise, and the universal polis. In this sense, it is illuminating  that Aristotle’s term polis can also mean citizenship and a body of citizens.85  Thus, instead of founding a city-state, the Dzhan people, with Chagataev’s  assistance, fi nd themselves merged with the Soviet collective body. However,  this newly expanded body preserves its distinct corporeal features and refuses  to evolve into an abstract rhetorical body representing the Stalinist state. The  ultimate incorporation is achieved through the conceptual transfi guration of  a key category: their main designator and proper name, which means soul.  That fi nal union is preceded by some remarkable passages that reveal several  qualitative transmutations of the notion of soul. For instance, soul literally fuses with body in the following passage, which  centers on the people’s experience of starving: “Food at this moment would  serve both to nourish the soul, and to make empty, submissive eyes begin to  shine again and take in the sunlight scattered over the earth.”86 The soul ap- pears to be directly connected to the gastrointestinal tract, for it is nourished  with ordinary food.87 Its immateriality is vigorously challenged, as it appears  to be incorporated into a human body. At a later point, however, the soul itself  82. The concepts of the collective and the individual are extensively and exhaustively  discussed in Oleg Kharkhordin, The Collective and the Individual in Russia: A Study of  Practices (Berkeley, 1999). 83.

Aristotle uses an analogy infused with bodily references when he discusses the  primacy of the city-state: “The state is by nature clearly prior to the family and to the in- dividual, since the whole is of necessity prior to the part; for example, if the whole body  be destroyed, there will be no foot or hand, except in an equivocal sense, as we might  speak of a stone hand; for when destroyed the hand will be no better than that. But things  are defi ned by their working and power; and we ought not to say that they are the same  when they no longer have their proper quality, but only that they have the same name.”  Aristotle, Politics, 5. 86.

In the novel, Sambikin claims that he has  discovered the exact location of the human soul—it is found in an empty space in the  intestine, somewhere between undigested food and excrement.

The collective body of the Dzhan is de- scribed as nourishing itself not only through ordinary food but also through  the soul: “No nation, not even the Dzhan, can live life split up and scattered.  People receive nourishment from one another not only through the bread they  eat but also through the soul, through sensing and imagining one another.”88  The soul here becomes a hybrid entity, belonging to both the physical and  spiritual realms (due to its “sensing and imagining” abilities) and capable of  unifying the scattered and alienated people. At the moment when the Dzhan  are converted into a single collective body, they attain the full realization of  the actual name of their tribe. When the people, who are internally ethnically  diverse, regain their soul, it replaces the concept of individual identity. Even  as an immaterial category, the soul serves as the sole common denominator  of the people’s bodies. Moreover, it is crucial that the soul is already inherent  or even embedded in the collective body of the nation; it only needs to be  rediscovered. The soul’s uniting aspect is crucial to understanding Dzhan’s ideological  coordinates. This is the discursive kernel of Platonov’s project of displacing  Stalinist ideology: the collective body of the totalitarian state cannot have a  soul, as it is an inherently individual category. By materializing the notion of  the soul and then turning it into a supracommunal entity, Platonov evades op- pressive biopolitical constraints, for the soul is a guarantor of freedom. Thus,  Chagataev’s mission is to help the Dzhan people attain their true soul, to free  it from ideological constraints and metaphysical doubts. As he explains to  the group, “You must have been given someone else’s soul. . . . Life itself is  enough to earn you happiness! Our soul is in the world now. And that’s the  only soul there is.”89 Chagataev is apparently talking about the Soviet soul, a  proletarian soul, which possesses the power to bring consciousness back to  the mind. The sphere of bare life in the desert, facing an open horizon, seems to be  the natural habitat for the ensouled Dzhan people; it comprises some kind of  a national park for the surrogate proletariat. The sacred and at the same time  profane status of its dwellers allows them to evade any ideological and politi- cal conceptualization. The peripatetic nation of the Dzhan enters a zone of ab- solute indistinction and fi nds itself constantly on the move. Indeed, according  to the Turkmen folk belief cited by Platonov, dzhan means “a soul that is look- ing for happiness.” This is not a settled soul, it is a soul in motion—anima. Moreover, the Dzhan’s nomadic state, demonstrating a perpetual kinesis  of physical bodies and metaphysical categories, resonates with the nation’s  problematic ethnic homogeneity. This fi ctional detail refl ects the actual con- dition of early twentieth-century Turkmens, who “conceptualized community  boundaries in terms of genealogy rather than territory.”90 The Turkmen “na- tion” comprised tribes that spoke diff erent dialects and were genealogically  diverse and hostile to each other. Hence, the purely artifi cial construction of  88. Platonov, “Soul,” 130. 89. Ibid., 105–6. 90.

The situation of dispersal and disconnectedness was a  natural one for the inhabitants of the Kara-Kum desert and its surroundings. Accordingly, the persistent motif of the tumbleweed—a “wandering plant,  the rough bush known as ‘roll-over-fi elds’ [‘perekati-pole’]”—serves as a po- tent symbol of the Dzhan nation in the novella, perfectly refl ecting its histori- cal and aesthetic realities. The plant appears prominently at the moment of  Chagataev’s banishment from his native land by his own mother, and it is  described as “dusty and tired, almost dead from the labor of its own life and  movement; it had no one, no family, no one close, and it was always mov- ing away into the distance.”91 Over the course of the novella, the plant serves  as a guide for the little boy Nazar and for the lost sheep, and at times as a  source of food for the desperate, semiconscious Chagataev. Toward the end  of Dzhan, immediately aft er his mother’s death, the protagonist “pulled some  tumbleweed out of the snow and took it into the house where his mother was  lying.” The image of the literally domesticated plant closes the narrative cycle  of the novella: “Chagataev was now seeing off  his mother, just as once, in his  childhood, she had seen off  Nazar.”92 However, this domestication is only tem- porary. The tumbleweed, which “is freer and more alive than a laborer with  no land,” evades the Bolsheviks’ grassrooting (korenizatsiia) policies.93 The  entrance of the tribal and untamable Dzhan into the normative framework  of the Soviet state is postponed, as it continues its tumbleweed-like journey  through the open and windy space of the Turkmen desert. On his way home to the Turkmen desert, and to his reunion with his mother  and nation, Chagataev encounters a homemade portrait of Stalin. The “can- vas” bears little resemblance to the Soviet leader: the painted Stalin “looked  like an old man, the kind father of all orphaned people on earth; without real- izing it, however, the artist had tried to make Stalin’s face resemble his own, to  show that he himself now had a father and kinsfolk and did not live alone in  the world.”94 The artifact’s artifi ce is openly acknowledged. The depicted “fa- ther” remains divorced from reality (with the lack of a link to the real Stalin)  and is elevated to a universal level. At the same time, the fi gure of the leader is  inscribed into the reality of the amateur artist through mutual resemblance. Throughout the novella, the fi gure of Stalin oscillates between abstract  and real realms: he is a gatherer of “whole nations,” a “good word,” an in- scription on a “fortress’s clay wall,” and “an unknown man.”95 However, this  instability is somewhat resolved toward the end of Dzhan, when “the great- est genius of all times and nations” ultimately evolves into a product of the  protagonist’s imagination: “Had Chagataev not imagined Stalin, had he not  sensed him as a father, as a kind strength that protected and enlightened his  91.

Stalin is more than he is and hence transcends reality. Gustav Klutsis’s Shock Workers of the Fields, Engage in Fighting for Socialist  Reconstruction! (1932), a canonical propaganda poster, features a photograph  of the leader emerging from and hovering above a sea of peasant workers that  is made up of smaller photographic portraits. The photomontage emphasizes  the simple fact that the individual body in the Soviet Union of the 1930s was  always subjected to a larger cause; it was part of something greater. Moreover,  the ontological status of the photographic image, positioned on the threshold  between the real and the imaginary, helps the artist capture the essence of  socialist realism: its rootedness in reality is combined with transcendental  aspirations.97 Stalin represents a collective body while literally emerging from  various real individuals.98 Of course, this collective body rejects the possibil- ity of soul, a strictly individual and idealistic category. “Soul work” is replaced  by banners with ideological truisms. The poster, with its evident corporeal manipulations, comprises a striking  counterillustration to Dzhan. Chagataev, who is also inseverable from the body  of his nation, merges with the Dzhan people by subjecting himself to extreme  collective physical experiences. Instead of vertical imposition, he practices  horizontal dissolution in the open Turkmen desert, where sky merges with  earth. Nevertheless, the protagonist compares himself to the Soviet leader in  a moment of utter desperation: like Stalin, the gatherer of all of humanity, he  must gather the Dzhan tribe and “let it recover, let it begin life from the very  beginning, since it’s never been allowed to live until now.”99 However, unlike  Stalin, Chagataev does not evolve into a transcendental entity and does not  deprive his nation of its agency: he neither negates its bodily framework nor  suppresses its zoological impulses. Communist ethics required a total commitment and supracorporeal loy- alty to its cause. The animus of the Stalinist state toward individual bodies  and animal life culminates in Dzhan in an illusion of bodily transcendence.  The collective body of the Dzhan, however, is by no means virtual, and its cor- poreality, sustained by the animating force of life, is the novella’s most vivid  feature. As one of the nation’s members puts it, “I’ve nowhere to live but my  own body.”100 Even the soul of the nation becomes a hybrid entity, belonging  to both physical and spiritual realms. 96.

Other notable examples of propaganda art depicting Stalin in the same manner  include Genrikh Futerfas’s Stalin’s Followers! Widen the Front of Stakhanov’s Movement!

Stalin at the Sixteenth Party Congress  (1935), and a number of other posters by Gustav Klutsis, such as The Victory of Socialism  in Our Country Is Guaranteed (1932), With Lenin’s Banner (1933), and Cadres Decide Every- thing (1936). 99.

But ultimately, the text reveals the Dzhan people as  a site of bare life itself in its indestructible corporeal glory. Their very bodily  integrity results in the possibility of freedom, for the body always has the  potential to escape ideological categorization by the mere fact of its physical  existence. Here, Stalinist cosmology is deconstructed by means of an elemen- tal manifestation of nature. Platonov, immersed in Soviet culture and politics, clearly understood the  internal workings of the discursive deadlock in which human subjects could  fi nd themselves, suspended between the realms of the animal and the hu- man, the corporeal and the political, and the natural and the cultural. This  awareness, to a large extent, explains the writer’s own ambivalent ideological  stance: the ardent materialist with a concrete transformational agenda was  also a prophet of lyric abstraction and (anti)utopian thinking. Throughout Pla- tonov’s texts, animal and human fl esh always meet the abstraction of culture.  The people of the Dzhan nation—representing the inexterminable manifesta- tion of life, of incorporated souls—comprise a striking instance of Platonov’s  aesthetic vision, even as it was clouded by the Stalinist nightmare. </page> </plain_text>
