Deposits of bone also appear to have been placed above the roof of the central area in the mound.  Ordering the world The concordances between different architectural spaces, the placement of the art on the stones, and the nature of the deposits of human bone and other material all suggest that Fourknocks had a complex and fluid set of religious meanings for people in Tomb 5m the Neolithic.

To understand more fully the history and closure of Fourknocks we need to consider its relationships with other sites in the immediate vicinity.

In fact there are very floor directly above this deposit there was a large human skull, set interesting similarities and differences between Fourknocks I and in a spread of cremated bones and partially protected by a setting II. Fourknocks II began as an outdoor area where cremations were of stones. Small piles of cremated bone were pushed into the carried out in an elongated pit. Just to the south of it there was a spaces between the bases of uprights and sealed by a thin flag or small cairn, and both these features were enclosed by a stone. At a higher level two adult human skulls were found side penannular ditch. A final series of cremation deposits were left in by side facing outwards. A water-rolled pebble was associated the base of the pit, and sometime after this a megalithic passage with each skull. was built leading to the northern lip of the cremation pit and a Thus the passage was deliberately blocked with material, covering mound was placed over the area.

Off to the east-north-east there is a communications mast, use in the Neolithic. Alongside these similarities it looks as if there was also a concern with the idea that the activities and structures on the two sites were complementary. This may well go back to earlier activity. On the supposition that the cremation deposits in Fourknocks I were burnt in the cremation trench, the tomb was in use when Fourknocks II was still an open-air site. At Fourknocks II it appears to have been deemed necessary at some point to sanctify what may well have been regarded as a dangerous, polluted area, as it was associated with the treatment and transformation of the dead before they were integrated into the ancestral world. A series of actions were carried out to make the site look like a passage tomb, but still different, reflecting a different history. The physical remains of the dead were deployed to mark the closing off of both monuments from active use. The high incidence of children may have been intended to demonstrate that this was a communally based decision, as children, in terms of social identity, are likely to have been regarded as reflecting kin and group concerns, symbolising the future of the community rather than individual lives.  Long after the monuments as such fell into ‘dis-use’ they continued to have an active role in the landscape. In a mythic Above: Plan of Fourknocks II (after Hartnett 1971).
