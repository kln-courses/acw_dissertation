<plain_text><page sequence="1">Resenas Godsland, Shelley. Writing Reflection, Reflecting on Writing-Female Identity and Lacan's Mirror in Helena Parente Cunha and Sylvia Molloy. Valladolid, Espana: Universitas Castellae, 2006. 215 pp. Shelley Godsland opens her book by pointing out that Mulher no Espelho (1983) and En breve cdrcel (1981) are considered by many critics to be two of the key texts that make up the boomfemenino in Latin America that now form part of the continent's female canon. She recognizes that the construction of a coherent identity is central to women's fiction following the 1970s and in this work she explores each female character's journey from the Imaginary realm towards Lacan's mirror stage provoked during their respective middle age crisis. The protagonists achieve this stage in different manners: while Cunha's personagem stands before a real looking glass attempting to reconcile herself with the other she sees in the mirror, Molloy's protagonist searches through the process of textualization to achieve this same means. Within the five in-depth chapters of this book, Godsland examines each woman's use of the specular device in her search for selfhood that has been thwarted by patriarchal standards and has therefore compromised the exteriorization of their true selves. Godsland provides a succinct summary of the key points of Lacanian thought in Chapter 1 entitled '"Mirror, Mirror on the Wall': The Adult Female Protagonist and Lacan's Mirror Stage," focusing on the ways in which the self is conceived in the mirror stage, which will serve as the basis for her argument. According to Lacanian theory, the mirror stage is the moment in which the child sees its reflection in the mirror and recognizes that it is not one with the mother. This is a significant point in Lacanian theory because it initiates the formation of the ego, and the child's subsequent movement towards the Symbolic. In this chapter and throughout this work, Godsland introduces a myriad of theorists who both support and challenge Lacanian theorizations of the mirror stage. One theorist in particular, Judith Williamson, argues that the mirror stage should be used as a metaphor given that the speculum or the reflection of the self can be achieved through other means. This will be important for Godsland's interpretation of Molloy's novel, in that she argues that it is the text which constitutes the speculum in the protagonist's development of identity. In Chapter 2 "Imagos and Imagined Identities" Godsland addresses the parallels between the protagonists of both works who explore the multifarious "alternative desired others" they erect for themselves that help them to achieve identity in their movement towards self-realization. Within their fragmentary pre-symbolic like texts, each character exhibits multiple personas that will be integrated in their psyche and absorbed into their ego. After a lifetime of</page><page sequence="2">252 Letras Femeninas Volumen XXXIV Numero 2 conforming to the norms set for women, Cunhas's character realizes at age forty-five that her life has been a charade. In the novel she utilizes three separate identities, or alter-egos, that she sees in the mirror as a strategy to construct a whole and coherent self. In her search for her true self, the protagonist resists societal norms and lives vicariously through the others she sees in the mirror. Godsland also argues that the nameless character of Molloy's work is the subject of Lacan's pre-mirror stage who will come to totality in her recognition of herself through the multitudinous people she comes into contact with, as well as the diverse characters that she creates in her text. The protagonist's exploration of herself through friends, lovers, fictional characters, anthropomorphic mutations, the classical Greek figure of Diana, dreams and personal fantasies, reveal the subject's alienation from the self and the need to recodify an identity through the process of writing. Given that the protagonists must ultimately enter into the Symbolic order in order to fulfill the mirror stage, Chapter 3 "Silence is (not so) Golden" is dedicated to an analysis of theorizations of Lacan's Symbolic order, and a questioning of the ability of each protagonist to reach this stage. Because entrance into the Symbolic order is constituted by the mother as Other, and based on the phallogocentric law of the father, Godsland questions the protagonists' relationship to language and male dominated texts and explores the conflicts that arise in their quest towards the Symbolic. It is her contention that Molly's and Cunha's texts reveal how the female subject is linguistically silenced and marginalized by men, and their metaphorical positioning in the Imaginary marks their inability to come to terms with a male dominated language that effaces their needs and desires. In addition to illustrating feelings of marginalization and futility that each character experiences confronted with the patriarchal discourse of language, Godsland suggests that neither will successfully be able to achieve entrance into the Symbolic until the end of their respective narratives, which occurs at the end of each novel. Chapter 4 "Mummies and Daddies: Parental Impediments to Traversal of the Mirror Stage in Infancy" deals with problematic relationships that both protagonists have had with their parents that have impeded a healthy transition into the mirror stage, and caused further conflicts in adult relationships. The beginning of the chapter highlights the importance of the mother/child dyad that, according to Kristeva, provides the pulses and rhythms that will later be assimilated into language. Godsland argues that the protagonists' early removal from the bond with the mother and their experience of "motherly unlove" hinder their ability to reach selfhood. Molloy's protagonist, who suffered the incestuous abuse of her father, laments her mother's inability or unwillingness</page><page sequence="3">Resenas 253 to save her from these traumatic nocturnal visits. Similarly, Cunha's protagonist, who was marginalized from the center upon the birth of her brother, was not only repressed by the rigid controlling actions of her father, but was ignored and criticized by her mother. In both cases, dysfunctional relationships designated by motherly absence and fatherly oppression result in low self-esteem, shame and improper development of the ego, thereby problematizing entry into the Symbolic. The concluding chapter, "By way of Conclusion: The Body Beautiful," examines the importance of body image which is essential to the mirror stage. This is perhaps one of the key chapters of Godsland's book because it expounds on the complex manifestations of the self image of the female subject, who according to John Berger, sees herself as the object of the male gaze. Cunha demonstrates how the protagonist of her work internalizes ideals of female socialization that induces girls to develop a consuming preoccupation with their appearance, thereby feeding into patriarchal subjugation. Godsland argues that through the back and forth movement between her adulthood and childhood, Cunha's protagonist recognizes the pitfalls and fallacies of this conditioning, and through her relationship with the looking glass she provides an inversion of the male/female relationship. First of all, it is she who looks at the Brazilian dancer and then engages in sexual relations with him. Secondly it is she who looks at herself in the mirror thereby bypassing complications produced by the male gaze, which ultimately enables her to achieve a sense of selfhood. Molloy's character, on the other hand, is so badly scarred by the violence and abuse inflicted upon her by the incestuous relations with her father and the rejection of her mother that she experiences a complete disassociation with her body image. According to the basic tenets of psychoanalysis, early mother-infant symbiosis must be interrupted by the father, or a representation of the phallus, in order to lead the subject into the Symbolic. The protagonist's dysfunctional relationship with both father and mother prohibited her from achieving this stage leaving her in a state of disidentifkation with her body image associated with the pre-symbolic stage. Instead of a traditional union with the reflection of the other in the mirror, she opts for a different gaze that attends to the needs of this broken body: "una mirada distinta que prescinde casi de los ojos." Her final recognition to fuse with this broken other in the specular of her text leads to her late-life achievement of the mirror stage and helps her to reconcile with both her self and language. Despite its dense subject matter, Professor Godsland is careful to delineate clearly her objectives and goals throughout the work, and therefore succeeds in her communication of a complex psychoanalytic analysis of these paradigmatic</page><page sequence="4">254 Letras Femeninas Volumen XXXIVNumero 2 texts in women's fiction. In addition to providing a detailed analysis of Lacanian theory and Hegelian thought in the foundation of women's writing, the importance given to this work is its exploration of the formation of the female subject and the conflicts that arise for those who deviate from the standards implicated by patriarchal thought. Furthermore, Godsland reveals the ways in which these two female writers question and resist traditional theories of psychoanalysis based on the formation of the subject and offer different approaches of achieving selfhood in their journey through the mirror stage. Moreover, because these texts were written in response to prevailing gendered, political and literary realities, this book provides the foundation for psychoanalytical readings of national conflicts, Latin American women's fiction or further interpretations of the works of these writers.
