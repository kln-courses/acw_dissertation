<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Stagni Painted Tomb: Cultural Interchange and Gender Differentiation in Roman Alexandria MARJORIE SUSAN VENIT E1g tpvf1qvy Claireve Grandjouan (1929-1982) Abstract This article interprets the architectural and picto- rial program of the Stagni Tomb-excavated in Alexan- dria in 1989-as indicative of both cultural interchange and gender-specific decoration in Roman-period Alex- andrian funerary art. It suggests that the tomb's fusion of classical and Egyptian subjects and style-which are combined in a manner original to the Stagni Tomb- demonstrates the exchange of cultural mate- rial between the two major ethnic groups in ancient Alexandria and that the inventive subject matter of the Stagni Tomb indicates that the tomb was intended for a woman. The article concludes that the elements of the Stagni Tomb combine to form a multicultural program granting preservation for the body of the de- ceased and immortality for her soul.* An idiosyncracy of ancient Alexandria is the atten- tion that it lavished on its dead. Monumental tombs of eastern dynasts figure prominently in the Helle- * I should like to thank Ahmed Abd el-Fattah, Acting Di- rector of the Graeco-Roman Museum in Alexandria, for gen- erously sharing with me photographs of the Wardian hypo- gea and inviting me to study and write on the Stagni Tomb. Discussions with Mervat Seif el-Din, Chief Curator at the Graeco-Roman Museum, and Marie-Dominique Nenna, CNRS and field director of the recent Centre d'etudes alex- andrines excavations in Gabbari, have added greater richness to this manuscript. Jean-Yves Empereur, CNRS, Director of the Centre d'etudes alexandrines, as always, provided genial hospitality and also the infrared and ultraviolet photographs of the Stagni Tomb and relevant and necessary information about the tomb's location. Evelyn B. Harrison, Donald P. Hansen, and Caroline M. Houser were there when I needed them. The two anonymous AJA reviewers provided a close reading and thoughtful insights, and Jan Jordan, secretary of the Agora Excavations, furnished the photo of the lamp from the Agora and its inventory number. I thank them all, but I take full responsibility for the ideas and conclusions ex- pressed here and any errors that they may contain. A generous grant from the University of Maryland Grad- uate Research Board in 1998 furnished travel funds for the completion of the article. This article was written using the resources of the libraries of the American School of Classi- cal Studies at Athens, the British School at Athens, the Graeco-Roman Museum and the Centre d'etudes alexan- drines in Alexandria, the University of Maryland, and the Institute of Fine Arts of New York University, and I thank the administration and the librarians of these institutions.

Ptolemaic Alexandrian tombs, cut vertically into the soft limestone bedrock outside the city's walls, are multichambered buildings conceived as collec- tive burial places and provided with spaces for the enactment of the funerary cult drama. They are en- tered from the surface by a staircase cut from the rock, and many center on a large, open-air court that permits visual access to the public sectors of the tomb. In the court is an altar-several of which pre- serve the ashes and bones of the last sacrifice-and a well or fountain for the water necessary for cult rit- ual. Surrounding the court are burial rooms fitted with loculi and a chamber with an elaborately deco- rated rock-cut kline to display the body during the funerary rites and also, perhaps, to permit the de- ceased laid out upon it to join symbolically in the fu- nerary banquet. The tombs are articulated with ar- chitectonic details cut from the rock and brightly painted to replicate the architecture of the living, and they are further embellished with figural paint- ings and occasionally with sculpture in relief. This monumental tomb type is initially limited to Alexandria, but the model spread almost immedi- ately along the Mediterranean coast well beyond the city2 and is soon seen in other regions, such as Cyprus and Rhodes, that had close ties with Alex- andria. The dissemination of the tomb type is even more expansive in the Roman period, and in its final phase it is probably ancestral to the Christian cata- combs in Rome. Ptolemaic and Roman-period Alexandrian tombs combine Classical and Egyptian stylistic, iconograph- ical, and conceptual references to create a new form of expression. In the city's earliest cemeteries, carved and painted stelai erected as grave monuments fol- low Greek and Macedonian models, although their disposition in the cemeteries is specific to Alexan- dria. Greek architectural and stylistic forms predom- inate in the earliest monumental tombs as well," al- though probably as early as the third century B.C. unequivocal Egyptian elements are incorporated, like the wingless sphinxes with nemes headcloths found guarding the entrance to the burial chamber of tomb 1 at Moustapha Pasha.4 In the ensuing centu- ries Alexandrian monumental tombs retain the con- ceptual model established in early Ptolemaic times, but elements intended to invoke pharaonic Egypt are found with greater frequency. These Egyptian ele- ments often stray far from their original form, rang- ing from those that acquire a Greek or Roman pa- tina to those almost entirely transformed and those poorly understood. Nevertheless, and despite their hybridization, the inclusion of originally Egyptian stylistic and iconographical elements seems of effica- cious value in the symbolic system that informs Alex- andrian tombs.5 Almost all the 100 or more Alexandrian tomb com- plexes that have been recorded were discovered in the first half of the 20th century, but recently two new major tomb groups have come to light. Final publication of one of these complexes, discovered in I Hypogeum A in the eastern cemetery at Chatby is the earliest extant truly monumental tomb in Alexandria. Since its discovery in 1904 Hypogeum A has been variously dated from ca. 320 (R. Pagenstecher, Nekropolis: Untersu- chungen iiber Gestalt und Enwicklung der alexandrinischen Gra- banlagen und ihrer Malereien [Leipzig 1919] 111), from the last quarter of the fourth century to the beginning of the third (E. Breccia, La necropoli di Sciatbi [Cairo 1912] xxxiv, xlv, xlix, li), to around the middle of the third century (A. Adriani, La Necropole de Moustafa Pacha. Annuaire 1933- 1934-1934-1935, 174-75; Adriani 1966, 126). I think it probably was begun about 280-275 B.C. 2 E.g., Plinthine (A. Adriani, "Necropole et Ville de Plinthine (Kom el Nougous)," Annuaire 1940-1950, 140- 57); Marina el-Alamein (for the recently excavated tombs at Marina and further bibliography see W.A. Daszewski, "The Origins of Hellenistic Hypogea in Alexandria," in M. Minas and J. Zeidler eds., Aspekte spdatgyptischer Kultur. Festschrift fiir Erich Winter zum 65. Geburtstag [Mainz 1994] 51-68); Marsa Matruh (A. Adriani, "Decouvertes At Marsa Matrouh," Annuaire 1935-1939, 159-60). SAlthough note that Daszewski (supra n. 2) 51-68 has argued that the design of the Ptolemaic Alexandrian mon- umental tomb with its open courtyard is rooted in phara- onic tomb design. This connection has previously been ad- dressed by H.A. el-Atta, "The Relationship between the Egyptian Tombs and the Alexandrian Hypogea," EtTrav 16 (1992) 12-19. 4For the tomb complex at Moustapha Pasha (now called Moustapha Kamal), see Adriani, La Necropole de Moustafa Pacha (supra n. 1). For the sphinxes see pls. 4.2, 8.2, and 28. Although Adriani notes (35) that the pedes- tals that support the sphinxes are not bonded to the fabric of the tomb, they-and the sphinxes that they carry-may well date as early as the tomb's third century foundation, and even if they do not issue quite so early, they do not necessarily date much later. 5 I have argued this point in "The Tomb from Tigrane Pasha Street and the Iconography of Death in Roman Al- exandria," AJA 101 (1997) 722 and more extensively and more recently in "Style, Substance, and the Efficacy of the Image in Tomb Painting of Roman Alexandria," Actes du VI1e Colloque de l'Association Internationale pour la Peinture Murale Antique (AIPMA) (forthcoming).</page><page sequence="3">1999] THE STAGNI PAINTED TOMB 643 HYPOGEUM II HYPOGEUM III PAINTED TOMB SHYPOGEUMI Fig. 1.

Alexandrian Roman-period hypogea follow the model of their Ptolemaic predecessors, although broadening the range of elements to incorporate the specific needs of Roman funerary ritual. Whereas many Roman-period hypogea are entirely new constructions, others-such as those at Stagni- reconfigure and expand Ptolemaic tomb complexes for Roman-period use. Although a generic Roman- period tomb complex type can be recognized in Alexandria-a rock-cut hypogeum with rock-cut or freestanding sarcophagi and tiers of loculi, as in the Ptolemaic period, for the disposition of the dead- each hypogeum is architecturally and ornamentally distinct. Many Roman-period tomb complexes re- tain the multiroom subterranean construction built around an open-air court, such as Stagni hypogeum 2, which contains the painted tomb; other hypogea ex- clude the court and consist of far fewer rooms; some include a triclinium-shaped burial chamber; still others constitute even vaster hypogea with extended facilities for cult as, for example, the catacombs at Kom el-Shoqafa.9 Within these varied types of Alexandrian hypogea, the burial of the dead, too, is variously administered: most are interred without embalming; others are cremated; a few are mummified.10 Some interments are found in shallow rock-cut graves, others are con- signed to sarcophagi, but most are placed in loculi. Cremated remains are deposited in cinerary jars, which are set in special shallow niches, placed in loculi, or occasionally in niches specially cut to hold them;l1 mummified bodies are found both in lime- stone coffins and without them.12 A sarcophagus might hold a single corpse or multiple burials, and a single loculus can contain up to five or six bodies. 3 Clearly disposition of the dead is hierarchically determined-socially and economically-and possi- bly also ethnically based. Yet even those dead con- signed with others within a single loculus lie in a tomb complex that has been afforded careful atten- tion in its architectural and decorative program. This architectural and decorative program of the tomb, within its imposed framework, is also highly individualized. In Roman Alexandria, painted slabs that seal the loculus are habitually treated more 8 The painted tomb is not indicated in the original pub- lished plan, and I have inserted it in the plan (fig. 1). ', For the catacomb complex, see its initial publication in ExpSieglin and most recently J.-Y. Empereur, A Short Guide to the Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa Alexandria (Alexan- dria 1995). " Both Antony and Cleopatra are said to have been mummified; see P.M. Fraser, Ptolemaic Alexandria 2 (Oxford 1972) 83, n. 188. " For cremation burials in the Roman period, see A. Rowe, "New Excavations at K6m el-Shukafa," BSRAA 35 (1942) 38; also note the list of varied burial methods in the tombs of Kom el-Shoqafa Rowe cites (37-38), which are more extensive than those given here. 2 Such as those mummies found in Gabbari, near the former Fort Saleh: see G. Botti, "Etudes topographiques dans la necropole de Gabbari," BSRAA 2 (1899) 41 and 42 pl. F. They were discovered in limestone mummiform coffins placed in graves. The surface of the rock had been pre- cisely cut out to receive the coffins, with a small stone monument indicating the presence of a group of two to four coffins. The mummification was not carefully done, especially in the case of children. There were, however, very brightly enameled mummies, of which the pectoral was usually painted in the most vivid colors, among which light blue predominated. Hieroglyphic writing, traces of gilding, and small leaves of gold are also reported. Hiero- glyphic writing is almost entirely absent from tombs of the Greco-Roman type, and the hieroglyphs might indicate that these were mummies of Egyptians who retained their traditional practices. See also Botti 1899 (44) for a descrip- tion of more graves with mummies found in the area of Fort Saleh. For mummies at Anfoushy, see G. Botti, "Premiere visite a la necropole d'Anfouchy A Alexandrie," BSRAA 4 (1902) 14, where he mentions two mummies ly- ing in the debris on the floor of tomb 1, room 4. They were situated as if they must have been placed in wooden coffins set on the left and back walls of the room (see the plan of the hypogea in BSRAA 4 [1902] at the back of the volume). See also G. Botti, "II.--Ncropole d'An- fouchy," Rapport 1919-1920, 67 for two mummies possibly disposed in painted mummy cases found in a small room (or large loculus) in Anfoushy Tomb 6. For "hundreds" of mummies found in loculi in a hypogeum at Ras el Tin dated by coins of Cleopatra and Augustus, see G. Botti, Rapport 1913, 9. The Ras el Tin and Anfoushy mummies are unquestionably found in Greco-Roman context, but may be of late Hellenistic date rather than from the earli- est period of Roman rule. 1" For loculi with multiple burials, see H. Thiersch, "Zwei Graber der r6mischen Kaiserzeit in Gabbari (Alex- andria)," BSRAA 3 (1900) 7-36, passim, who describes a tomb discovered in 1899 remarkably intact; a number of the loculi had more than one dead; some he takes as mother and child, but some had five or six skeletons lying upon one another (for descriptions of the contents of the loculi including the number of skeletons in each, see 17- 21; for the one with the five or six skeletons, see 19, locu- lus no. 13). The tomb had poor grave goods, mostly pots, some of glass, and some pieces of carbon in the loculi. There were no objects of precious metal, although there were small altars in terracotta and marble.

Instead of the painted images-most often of a door-or figured scenes that decorate Ptolemaic loculus-closing slabs, the majority of Roman-period slabs carry only a painted inscription. Yet sculpted loculus-closing slabs are introduced in the Roman period that, although relatively uncommon, employ a format incorporating figurative and architectural elements more elaborate than almost any Ptolemaic- period type.14 In the Roman period, too, naos- shaped trabeated niches and arctuated niches (arco- solia) into which sarcophagi are cut are embellished with intricate figural decoration, and almost all are uniquely treated. Only rarely do two different Roman painted tomb niches conserve the same funerary im- agery. The two in the so-called Nebengrab in the Kom el-Shoqafa catacomb complex, recently pub- lished by Guimier-Sorbets and Seif el-Din, each of which shows the abduction of Persephone, are far more the exception than the rule;15 exceptional, too, is their use of a Greek mythical narrative which finds only rare parallels in Alexandria and few in Roman-period tombs elsewhere in Egypt.16 More often in Roman-period Alexandrian tombs, seem- ingly stock Egyptian (or Egyptian-based) themes are employed, but these, too, differ from one an- other, and few are entirely as stereotypical as they initially appear. THE STAGNI HYPOGEA AND THE PAINTED TOMB The three Stagni hypogea, like almost every other Alexandrian tomb complex, were cut vertically into the living rock and, like almost every other tomb complex encountered in Alexandria, they had previ- ously been robbed. What remained were their archi- tectural shells, comprised of courts surrounded by multiple chambers that had been designed for locu- lus burials. Sections of the hypogea retained their painted ceilings, and a Ptolemaic-period funerary kline, partially cut back in antiquity, also preserved some of its painted decoration. Found in hypogeum 2, the largest and most sprawling of the complexes excavated-and the one that contained the frag- mentary funerary couch-was the best-preserved and most exceptional element among the three hy- pogea: a richly painted niche cut to receive a sar- cophagus (fig. 2). Dating from the period of Roman rule, the painted tomb was one of the additions to the original Hellenistic-period hypogeum. All other elements of the three hypogea were left in situ and destroyed, but the painted tomb was cut from the adjoining rock and removed to the archaeological park above the catacombs at Kom el-Shoqafa, where it is now on view. Unfortunately, as is so often the case in Alexandria, ground water had inundated the hypogea before their discovery. In the case of the painted Stagni Tomb, the level of the water reached almost to the top of the sarcophagus. Consequently, the part of the tomb below the water level was left in situ and destroyed with the hypogea, so that the re- mains of the tomb give an incorrectly truncated im- pression. Yet, in spite of its fragmentary condition, the tomb provides unprecedented information about Alexandrian iconological interchange and gender representation. The painted tomb from the Stagni hypogeum in- corporates general Greek elements, specifically Ptole- maic ones, and generic Roman and Egyptian elements into its architectural and decorative program. It sur- rounds the dead with potent images, both architec- tural and figurative, at once those realized elsewhere in Alexandrian funerary art and those yet unparal- leled. Unfortunately, exposure to the elements has al- 14A loculus closing slab-so-far unique-from the late Ptolemaic tomb 5, room 4 at Anfoushy (it is no longer really visible; see A. Adriani, "Necropoles de l'ile de Pharos. B. Section d'Anfouchy," Annuaire 1940-1950, 93, n. 1), at least the lower part (see Annuaire 1940-1950, pl. 38, fig. 2 and p. 92, fig. 54 drawn after a photo of Breccia in Rapport 1919-20, fig. 7, pl. 4), seems to be a forerunner of these Roman loculus-closings and stelai. The Anfoushy frame enclosing the loculus is conceived in plaster and occupies the entire height of the wall, even extending up onto the ceiling. It is complex and has components of a true Egyp- tian naos, of which the interior elements are seen in di- minishing perspective on several planes.

(Photo author) ready damaged the tomb: salts are leaching through the stone and flaking the plaster and its concomitant painting, and details of the painting have become in- visible even in the few years between my first view of the tomb in 1994 and my most recent work in 1998. Accordingly, in 1998 the tomb was exposed to both infrared and ultraviolet photography, but unfortu- nately, neither process recovered much that is hid- den to the naked eye. What remains of the architecture and its decoration, however, permits an appreciation of a seemingly ordinary tomb that nevertheless yields unparalleled visual evidence of eschatological be- liefs, cultural interaction, and gender specification in ancient Alexandria. The Stagni Tomb demonstrates the continuation of Hellenic precepts and the adop- tion and adaptation of Egyptian ones in the period when Rome ruled Alexandria. THE ARCHITECTURAL FACADE AND ITS DECORATION The architectural format of the Stagni Tomb is, at first glance, unexceptional. It finds parallels, if not complete correspondence, among the tombs of the first- through second-century catacombs at Kom el- Shoqafa (fig. 3).17 Like those, its facade assumes the form of a Greek-derived naos, incorporating piers topped with anta capitals. The piers support an entab- lature, which is crowned above with a triangular tym- panum framed by deep cornices capped with a central disc acroterion. Although commonplace in outline, in its details the Stagni Tomb presents evidence unique among Alexandrian Roman-period tombs. The Pediment The pediment (fig. 4) is unusually low for a monu- ment of Roman date, and the deep and heavy cor- nices that frame the tympanum appear to compress the triangular space even further. At the apex of the pediment, the disc acroterion projects from the face of the rock the full depth of the raking cornice, al- though its frontal surface is now almost completely missing. The cornices preserve an unusual amount of painted detail, providing information that has been lost in other tombs: the underside of the raking cornice bears a series of running circles in black, blue, and red on a white ground; on its face, a red band above and a black one below frame black den- tils with white for the interstices; the face of the hor- izontal cornice carries the same ornament as that of the raking ones, but bears a delicate vine motif painted in red with a wide black band below on its underside. On the white wall of the tympanum a winged sun disc is painted in black outline with yel- low and reserved details. Because of its essentially rectangular format, the sun disc with horizontal wings is a more normal motif for the lintel than for 17 See ExpSieglin 121-32 for the tombs in the "Nebengrab," also called the "Hall of Caracalla."</page><page sequence="7">1999] THE STAGNI PAINTED TOMB 647 here.'" The wing coverts of the Stagni sun disc, how- ever, are clearly distinguished from the primaries and secondaries, and the latter extend into the cor- ners of the triangular space, making the usually rect- angular wing more naturally birdlike as it neatly fits the tympanum format. The Frieze and Its Decoration The deep cornice that crowns the frieze has myrtle leaves painted in red on its underside and a scallop pattern in red, black, and white on its face. The bot- tom surfaces of all the cornices-those of the pedi- ment and that of the frieze-incline upward at a strong 20-degree angle, heightening the sense of perspective and rendering the ornament on their undersides more easily visible to the viewer standing in the chamber before the tomb. In response to this upward inclination the faces of the cornices also tilt upward, although at a slighter angle, so that the deviation from a 90-degree angled form is not immediately apparent. This method of intensi- fying architecture's natural perspective is first en- countered in Alexandria in the grandest tombs of the Ptolemaic period,19 and its incorporation in the Stagni Tomb is one of the subtle connections that links this Roman-period tomb to its Ptolemaic predecessors and that further underscores trans- mission of principles of design in Alexandrian fu- nerary architecture. Painted on the frieze is a motif well-known in Al- exandrian context: confronted sphinxes, one pair partially preserved at either end of the entablature (fig. 5). The sphinxes have yellow chests, heads, and legs, and a bluish hue for their wings. They are in the mainstream of Alexandrian representation, follow- ing a well-known type most numerously preserved on Alexandrian coins. They sit back on their hind legs, with one foreleg diagonally thrust forward for bal- ance and the other raised resting on a wheel, painted green, in a pose similar to those seen on the reverses of Alexandrian coins of the Imperial period.20 In this re- Fig. 3. One of the tombs from the "Nebengrab" ("Hall of Caracalla") at Kom el-Shoqafa. (After Adriani 1966, pl. 101, fig. 342) spect they differ from the sphinxes of one of the "Nebengrab" tombs in the Kom el-Shoqafa catacomb (see fig. 3),21 which stand with both fore- and hind legs extended like animals posing at a show. Addi- tionally, and in contrast to the wings of the "Neben- grab" sphinxes, the wings of the Stagni sphinxes ap- pear similarly constructed to those recurrently seen on Alexandrian coins. On the coins, especially those of the period of Antoninus Pius, the wings of the sphinxes have two discrete parts-a single, high sickle-shaped wing that rises almost vertically and a lower fanlike element that fills the interstice between the sickle-wing and the sphinx's back. The sickle- shaped element must represent the scapulars or wing coverts, the fan-shaped one the secondary and pri- mary wing feathers. The wings of the Stagni sphinxes appear to have been similarly divided into two sec- tions, although both emerge from the shoulder of the sphinx more closely parallel to one another and at a lower angle than those shown on the coins. 1 Winged sun discs with horizontal wings are found in the arc-shaped frieze created by the low vault of tomb 1 in the "Hall of Caracalla" ("Nebengrab") (see Guimier-Sorbets and Seif el-Din [supra n. 15] 366, fig. 7 and 370, fig. 10), but the vault is so low that the division of the wall acts al- most as a rectangular horizontal unit.

Pediment of the Stagni Tomb. (Photo author) Painted between each pair of sphinxes and their wheels is a basileion-one of the crowns of Isis- and another basileion is painted in the center of the frieze.2 The space to either side of the central basileion is extensive enough to postulate small flank- ing motifs, but all the supporting plaster and its paint- ing has been lost. What had been painted at the far ends of the frieze is also difficult to make out. The en- tire surface of the lintel below, along with any painted detail it might have had, has also been destroyed. The original publication of the Stagni Tomb identi- fies the monsters-which I have called sphinxes-as griffins,23 but the three partially preserved heads cer- tainly appear much more human than avian and, fur- thermore, are analogous to those of the undeniable- although more Egyptianized- sphinxes painted in the niche on the back wall of the tomb. The two sphinxes on the frieze that face right (the two whose head coverings are discernible) seem to wear flat- tened hats that resemble kausias or poloi from which a tendril (perhaps intended as a uraeus) springs in the front. These forms might preserve the remains of nemes headcloths, like those that crown the sphinxes painted on the interior of the tomb, but this suggestion is merely speculative.24 Despite the lack of certainty in the specific crown that the Stagni sphinxes wear, their headdresses mark them off from griffins. Griffins are never crowned; their spiky crest and upright ears obviate the addi- tion of a head covering. Griffins standing with one foreleg raised to a wheel are associated with the Greek goddess Nemesis,25 and in Alexandria sphinxes can also assume this role. Since the fifth century B.C. Nemesis had been per- sonified as a deity who punished mistreatment of the dead26 and her image is often found in funerary con- 22 Described in the initial publication as an atef crown (Etudes alexandrines 1 [supra n. 7] 40), the crown of Osiris. 23 Etudes alexandrines 1 (supra n. 7) 40. 24 One might argue that since these sphinxes are winged they are not Egyptian sphinxes and thus cannot wear nemes headdresses. It is true that the sphinxes painted in the interior of the tomb lack wings. Yet the sphinxes with the wheel depicted on Alexandrian coins (supra n. 20) are all winged and all are crowned with Egyp- tian headdresses, although admittedly not the nemes. 25J.

Melanges Jacqueline Duchemin: Actes du Colloque de Chan- tilly. 1f-2 mai 1980 (Paris 1983) 41-54 has argued for an Egyptian origin for both the form and the conception of the griffin as a deity of retribution that would correspond to the Greek Nemesis. M.B. Hornum, Nemesis, the Roman State, and the Games (EPRO 117; Leiden 1993) 24-32 ques- tions this thesis, noting (24) that the earliest extant dated example of the griffin connected with the goddess is on a Roman wall painting in the House of the Fabii at Pompeii and that the next earliest evidence comes from reverses of Alexandrian coins struck during the reign of Domitian. Therefore, it seems that a Classical and perhaps even an Al- exandrian origin for the deity's familiar is more likely. For the Alexandrian connection of Nemesis and griffin, see most recently H.P.

One of the sphinxes from the frieze of the Stagni Tomb. (Photo author) text.27 The cult of Nemesis had been important in Alexandria, even before the consecration of the sa- cred precinct to the goddess, related by Appian (B Civ. 2.90), on the spot where Julius Caesar had buried the head of Pompey. This precinct survived until the reign of Trajan when it was destroyed in the revolt of the Jews between 115 and 117. An inscription from Memphis,28 dated by Hans Volkmann to "probably" 110 B.C., and Papyrus Berlin 13954, dated to the first century B.C., indicate a temple of the deity.29 Alex- andrian coins from the periods of Claudius, Vespa- sian, Trajan, and Hadrian show an image of the deity, interpreted as her cult statue,30 and a coin in Dattari's collection31 that shows a griffin with its paw on a wheel crouched in naiskos with segmental pedi- ment should also refer to the Roman shrine. Like the griffin, the sphinx is also found on re- verses of Alexandrian coins.32 Like the griffin she, too, is associated with the wheel of Nemesis, al- though she is nowhere found associated with the im- age of Nemesis herself. Both sphinx and griffin are always depicted as conspicuously female and nurtur- ing, with high, tumid, human female breasts and the distended teats of a nursing animal mother. A similar model seems to underlie them both; only from the neck up is one distinguishable from the other. 27 See, e.g., a funerary stele, "probably from Alexandria," Bologna Museo Civico Archelogico G 1062 of a young boy aged three years two months, on which a Nemesis griffin is carved in the field (E.A. Arslan, Iside: Il mito il mistero la magia [Milano, Palazzo Reale, 22 febbraio-10 giugno 1997] [Mi- lan 1997] 227, cat. no. 4.209); a Nemesis griffin is also carved in the field on another grave monument of a three- year-old boy, Brooklyn 16.105 (K.

On Alexan- drian issues, the emblems that crown the sphinxes- a simple modius, a modius flanked by ears of wheat, and a crown comprised of horns, a disc, and plumes34-are emblems connected with the cult of Isis and her Ptolemaic consort, Serapis. A further connection of the sphinx with Serapis (and thus with Isis) is seen on a relief in the Graeco-Roman Mu- seum in Alexandria that shows a three-headed sphinx turning a wheel with its paw, with a bust of Serapis in the field.35 The Samarian coin, the emblems on Alex- andrian coins, and the Graeco-Roman Museum relief all relate the sphinxes that raise one paw to a wheel to the cult of Isis and Serapis. In the Stagni Tomb, the basileion painted between each grouping of a sphinx and its corresponding wheel emphasizes the connec- tion of the monsters there to Isis. In Metamorphoses (11.5.19), Apuleius has Isis de- claim to his protagonist, Lucius, that she is the uni- versal goddess with many names, known to some as Rhamnusia, that is, as Nemesis. Isis-Nemesis had a shrine on Delos at least as early as the late second cen- tury B.C.: an inscription dated to 110/09 B.C. records the dedication of a chapel and a statue to Isis-Nemesis by the priest of Isis on behalf of the demos of Athens and King Nikomedes III of Bithynia,36 and another base gives a dedication by the same priest on behalf of the demoi of Athens and Rome.37 Paul Perdrizet suggests that the syncretism of Isis with Nemesis be- gan in Alexandria earlier than the end of the second century B.C.,38 and the two Delian dedications, which span much of the geographical breadth of the Helle- nistic world, support at least his temporal claim. J. Gwyn Griffiths"3 (and, tacitly, P. Roussel, who pub- lished the Delian inscriptions) accepts Perdrizet's Alex- andrian derivation of the syncretic cult and adds that in Egyptian tradition the concept of Isis-Ma'at was impor- tant and that "it may be regarded as the theological origin of both Isis-Dikaiosyne and Isis-Nemesis, since Ma'at as a goddess ofjustice represented these ideas."40 The connection of the griffin with Nemesis has frequently been addressed, but the problem of the sphinx with its paw turning the wheel has rarely been considered. Perdrizet notes that Adolf Erman41 had posed the question, "Who is the winged sphinx who has her paw on the wheel?" to which Perdrizet re- plies, "I really believe that it is quite simply a ques- tion of the griffin of Nemesis."42 In light of the evi- dence adduced above, we might wonder if it were not quite simply a question of the sphinx of Isis- Nemesis. If indeed this is the case, the sphinxes on the Stagni Tomb and on the tomb from the Kom el- Shoqafa "Nebengrab" can be read as emblematic of the syncretic deity Isis-Nemesis. In both Greece and Egypt, sphinxes take on the role of guardian be- ings; in addition, Nemesis herself protects the in- tegrity of the tomb. The sphinx of Isis-Nemesis, na- tive to the soil of Alexandria, further extends this concept to embrace not only the protection of the contents of the tomb but the immortality of the oc- cupant of the tomb. Coupled with the basileions of Isis, the sphinxes of Isis-Nemesis conform to and fur- ther reinforce the iconographical program expressed by the remainder of the tomb's imagery. The Decoration of the Piers Below the entablature, two piers frame the open- ing of the niche. On the exterior face of each pier, a panel drawn with doubled lines encloses an image of a petal-winged boy, undoubtedly an Eros, treated as a figure decorating the shaft of a candelabra. On the lateral faces of the piers Anubis stands garbed as a Roman soldier, and on each face of the pier capitals are a pair of Horus falcons. Erotes. Although treated as pendants, the erotes (figs. 6 and 7) are neither twins nor mirror images. Their poses differ, and so do details, although both have wings idiosyncratically constructed of five petals (the proper left wing of the right boy is not fully pre- served), more reminiscent of the wings of Psyche than of Cupid.

Yet, since our painter is sufficiently able to Fig. 7. Eros from face of right pier. (Photo author) depict other avian elements-the wings of the sun disc on the tympanum and those of sphinxes on the lintel-and since there is no overwhelming reason to posit more than a single painter for all elements of the tomb, their form must be meaningful, al- though the precise meaning remains unclear to me. 43 An Eros with the butterfly wings of Psyche is noted by R. Stuveras, Le putto dans l'art romain (Brussels 1969) 168 as figured on an architectural terracotta relief in H. von Rohden and H. Winnefeld, Architektonische rimische Tonre- liefs der Kaiserzeit 1 (Berlin 1911) fig. 380. A figure called a "genietto" by Adriani and one that I would call an Eros, which decorates the lid of a garland sarcophagus in the Graeco-Roman Museum (Alexandria 3931, from Wardian; see Adriani 1961, 1.31, no. 36 and pl. 28, fig. 84) also has the butterfly wings of Psyche. Although this child is not physically distinguished as a boy, it acts the same as other bird-winged boys on the sarcophagus, so its gender is most likely intended to be male. 44 Erotes (or putti) may be winged or wingless, and the proportion of their wings may vary (see Stuveras [supra n. 43] 168) but, with the exceptions noted in n. 43, they in- variably wear birds' wings.</page><page sequence="12">652 MARJORIE SUSAN VENIT [AJA 103 The Eros on the left pilaster stands in a pose be- tween frontal and three-quarter view to our left in the differentiated stance inherited from fifth-century Greece. He bears his weight on his left leg; his right is slightly bent at the knee, which raises his right heel, and the leg is pulled slightly behind the left. His flesh remains the color of the white background; his wings are painted light blue-green. Shadows, too, or minor interior definition, are rendered in the same light blue-green. The boy's torso is seen almost in three-quarter view, but both arms are probably outstretched to his sides (only his right is at all pre- served), and he turns his face toward his left-that is, toward the opening of the tomb-looking over his left shoulder. His hair, painted yellow ocher, is gathered into bunches that produce a spiky, scal- loped crown. He wears a black quiver strap across his right shoulder and slung across his torso, but he is otherwise nude. The Eros that decorates the right-hand pilaster has similar wings to his pendant and is similarly col- ored. He appears, however, to stand with his lower body completely frontal: his face is frontal, too, and although most of the remaining figure has disap- peared, he seems to be posed with his weight evenly divided between both legs. Like his counterpart he is nude, although he has no visible quiver strap, and in contrast to the spiky crown of the child on the left, his hair falls forward in soft waves. A difference in the thickness of the white paint on his torso makes it ap- pear that, instead of having both arms outstretched (if that is, indeed, the pose that the other Eros has as- sumed), he has extended his left arm across his torso to hold something yellow ocher (a patera?) in both his outstretched hands. This impression of the pose is given further credence by the blue arc that de- fines his upper chest, which appears compressed rather than extended as it would be were his arms outstretched. Both children have similar motifs painted above their heads: a leafy stalk that terminates above in a large, flat two-handled basin with a circle above it decorated with tendrils.45 But even the elements here are treated differently on one side from the other. The foliage above the left Eros seems lighter, more curvilinear and calligraphic than that above the right, and it certainly supports a wide, fairly shal- low two-handled vessel that supports a large disc. It is difficult to make out the upper termination of the stalk above the right-hand Eros, since much of the plaster is missing, but it is fairly certain that the terminal dif- fered from that of the left candelabra. In the original publication the disc was interpreted as the head of a child; although I am not sure what it is, I am positive that whatever its resemblance to a human infant, it was not intended as such.46 The foliage on the stalk is interpreted in the origi- nal publication as a blue lotus, and it does appear to have the two lateral and single central petals that are the sign for the flower. Egyptian texts describe the newly born sun god emerging from or resting upon the blue lotus that had sprouted in a pool on the pri- mordial mound. In the first millennium B.C. and later, Harpocrates assumes the role of the infant sun god, replacing Horus as the son of Isis. Iconographi- cally, Harpocrates is pictured as the child Horus: nude, his finger to his mouth, and his head shaven except for a luxuriantly braided sidelock.47 Despite the iconographical distance between the two child deities, conceptual similarities permit their confla- tion, as can be seen in a terracotta from Egypt that depicts an Eros of the punished-Cupid type, his arms bound behind him, emerging from the calyx of a lotus.48 In light of the other elements in the decorative program of the Stagni Tomb, the figures on the faces of the piers also may indicate a syncretic deity: Eros-Harpocrates. The original publication notes that the erotes hold dolphins, which often accompany erotes, in their outstretched hands. A parallel for this motif is found on the reverse of a Hadra vase in the Athens National Museum, where a winged boy-undoubtedly Eros-is seen frontally, his arms outstretched, hold- ing in each hand a leash that constrains a dolphin.49 The motif on the vessel is a horizontal one, however, employed to fill a horizontal space, and I find it im- possible to locate the lines that must indicate a dol- phin and equally difficult to reconstruct a dolphin in 45 Described in the original report as the head of a child (Etudes alexandrines 1 [supra n. 7] 40). 16 Mervat Seif el-Din has suggested the head of Medusa, which is an eminently sensible possibility, but I don't see that in the drawing either. 47 For Harpocrates seated on a lotus, see, e.g., an intag- lio, Verona Musei Civici de Castelvecchio, inv. no. 27548, Iside (supra n. 27) 261, cat. no. 4.284.

The panel certainly extends below the boys' feet, but it is clear that the boys stood on a ground line that itself reaches across the panel. The candelabra probably continued below. In a tomb that bears an architec- tural similarity to the Stagni Tomb, discovered in Gabbari during the first Sieglin expedition, and known only from a drawing by Fiechter (fig. 8),50 the faces of the piers are decorated with fine vertically arranged florals that create a candelabra supporting mythical beasts. In the Fiechter Tomb the candela- bra decoration continues the entire height of the pier, but since the Stagni erotes are the focal point of their piers' decoration, it is more likely that there was another panel below, probably containing orna- ment like those in the tombs in the "Nebengrab" at Kom el-Shoqafa (see fig. 3).51 Anubis. Anubis, garbed as a Roman centurion (fig. 9), decorates the lateral faces of the piers, al- though the one on the left pier is almost totally ef- faced. He stands frontally in a differentiated pose, hisjackal head turned to his left, his ears pricked for- ward. His right arm is raised to hold a spear set verti- cally at his side; his left arm is bent at the elbow, set- ting his hand near his hip. Both his jackal head and his exposed human flesh are painted reddish brown. He wears a cuirass with pteryges, a short chiton (the gathered sleeves and bunched folds of which can be made out under his cuirass), and a mantle slung over his left shoulder that falls into calligraphic folds down his right side. Cuirass, chiton, and mantle are all painted yellow ocher. Anubis seems to have a bag tied to a belt about his waist at his right, and in the crook of his left arm he holds either a caduceus or a sword painted yellow ocher. The interpretation of this object is compli- cated by a break that renders it all but unintelligible. The pose seems to demand a caduceus, but to my knowledge a military Anubis never holds a cadu- ceus,52 whereas he is likely to bear a sword. In a small bronze statuette in Leiden, another in Athens, and a third in Rome, a military Anubis holds a spear (now missing) in his upraised right hand and a sword or scabbard against his outstretched arm,53 and that is what should be expected here.

Kantorowicz sees the military garb as imitating emperor iconography that exchanges the nudity of the first century for the military garb of the second; Henri Seyrig takes the military garb as apotropaic; whereas Jean-Claude Grenier and Jean Leclant give it the double meaning of protection and victory over death.55 In the context of the Stagni Tomb, either-or both-of the latter two interpre- tations is probably correct. Pier Capitals The lateral and exterior faces of the pier capitals (only the right-hand one is preserved) each show two Horus falcons, so distorted that they look like pigeons (fig. 10). The birds seem to wear the composite (pschent) crown. They are poised to either side of a kalathos that might be intended to hold stalks of wheat and poppy pods.56 The device is seen on the reverses of Alexandrian coins;57 in the Stagni painting the form of the kalathos is clear, but what fills it is largely indeci- pherable. All elements are painted yellow ocher. The undersides of the capitals are painted reddish yellow, and their surfaces project upward like the undersides of the cornices of the pediment and the frieze. The underside of the abacus is painted with a white or very light green scallop pattern on a black ground. Like the undersides of the cornices of the entablature and those of the pier capitals, the under- sides of the abacuses also slant strongly upward to permit the ornament greater visibility and create a sense of heightened perspective. In addition, the or- nament on the underside of the lateral face of the right-hand abacus (the only lateral face on which or- nament is preserved) slants upward toward the front of the tomb, so much so that it encroaches on the vertical side of the abacus, creating another case of exaggerated perspective. The disjunction that this intrusion of the ornament would create at the front corner of the abacus is mitigated by a black horizon- tal band painted on the exterior face of the abacus that meets the black (which is to be read as void) that defines the upper part of the ornament. On the front face of the abacus, the ornament is limited to the oblique underside. The decoration of the facade of the Stagni Tomb comprises an apotropaic program that celebrates re- newal in the afterlife. The Horus falcons of the pier capitals further elaborate upon the general Isiac theme, which includes the Isis-Nemesis sphinxes of the frieze and the Anubis figures of the piers, al- though the two latter iconographic signs also have 54 For Anubis see LIMC 1, s.v.

Also developing the Isiac theme are the erotes, who introduce the Greek Aphrodite, one of the many female deities with whom Isis claims as- similation (permitting the erotes to be additionally read as figures of Eros-Harpocrates). The image painted in the niche on the back wall of the tomb, which forms the focal point of the interior, carries on this eschatological program while enriching it. THE INTERIOR OF THE TOMB The interior of the tomb niche is ca. 2.05 m long, ca. 1.23 m wide, and 1.17 m high (from the lip of the sarcophagus and including the cornice) at the back wall.58 The straight lintel should presuppose a flat ceiling, but the ceiling actually forms a shallow vault running the length of the tomb. The ceiling is orna- mented with a double ridgepole plastically articu- lated as a flat surface, each member ca. 10 cm wide, running the length of the vault at about its center and another fictive beam treated in the same man- ner near the front of the ceiling. There is no corre- sponding beam along the back of the ceiling, but a slightly rounded cornice mediates the junction of the back wall with the ceiling of the tomb just below the springing of the vault. Behind the facade the niche opened to hold the sarcophagus, of which only ca. 22 cm of the height remains. A loculus (70 cm wide X 83 cm high) had been cut into the left lateral wall of the niche about 12 cm above the top of the sarcophagus, probably just at the level of its cover. The loculus is plastically framed with two short, rock-cut pilasters, an unusual addition and a further example of the care expended on this tomb. The walls of the loculus had been roughly scored to receive plaster (at least on the bit of the loculus that now remains after the tomb was re- moved from its enveloping rock), and small pieces of plaster covered with reddish-yellow paint still adhere to the left wall. On the face of the right-hand pilaster framing the loculus is the ghost image of a figure.59 58 The interior dimensions of the sarcophagus are ca. 1.91 x 1.12 m. 59 In 1997 I thought I could make out a draped (proba- bly) female figure standing to the right, turning back (to- ward the loculus) to look over her shoulder, with perhaps a long staff or scepter in her left hand. The scepter seemed to bisect her body on a slight diagonal. Her right arm ap- peared to be outstretched. Toward the loculus opening, to the left of the figure, a sphinx(?) seemed to face toward her (and away from the loculus). It was not possible to obtain a clearer image with either infrared or ultraviolet photogra- phy, and in 1998 the images (especially the human figure) appeared even less clear. Certain is a papyrus blossom (or at any rate, a fan-shaped object divided horizontally into three sections) below the human figure.</page><page sequence="16">656 MARJORIE SUSAN VENIT [AJA 103 Fig. 11. Niche on the back wall of the tomb. (Photo author) The Niche on the Back Wall A small, shallow rectangular niche (77 cm wide X 84 cm high x 15 cm deep) (fig. 11) is cut in the back wall of the tomb, 24 cm above the top of the sarcoph- agus lip. Almost all the wall below the niche is given over to a mastaba-shaped Egyptian stand painted yel- low ocher with a red outline, presumably intended to act as a support for the cursory aedicula created by the niche. The upper 12 cm of the niche projects slightly, responding to a flat, slightly projecting band that runs along the back wall of the tomb. This band on the back surface of the niche is painted with a frieze of uraei, neatly foreshortened and accurately drawn. Those on the left side face three-quarters to the left; those on the right side (which are clearer) are drawn facing three-quarters to the right. The panel below the projecting band is bordered to left and right by a red band and contains an Egyptian naos enclosing a female deity flanked by two sphinxes that crouch on high cubic bases. This niche and its painting remain the most re- markable element of the Stagni Tomb. The small, shallow, figured niche itself is rare among Alexan- drian tombs. Cut into the wall behind the sarcopha- gus, its placement and its decoration obviates it serv- ing as a niche in which to deposit votives or to hold lamps or ritual paraphernalia, all of which are func- tions conjectured for similarly sized niches in Alex- andrian tombs. The Stagni niche recalls those in two late Ptolemaic tombs also uncovered in the western necropolis, and it must have served a similar func- tion.60 Both tombs were excavated in Gabbari, a quarter adjacent to Wardian, where the Stagni Tomb was found. The first tomb was discovered in 60o A third tomb, excavated by Adriani in 1950-1951 during the construction of a large building of the Societ6 de Pressage et de D6pots in the area of the former western necropolis called Minet el-Bassal, dated to the third cent. B.C., has a kline room with a niche cut into the wall be- hind the kline-sarcophagus, but this niche is deeper than the others adduced, simply framed, and almost certainly intended to hold votive offerings. Remarkably, a figura- tive painting showing a farewell scene is set on the wall to the side of the niche.

(After Adriani 1966, pl. 75, fig. 249) 1930 by Evaristo Breccia and reexcavated by Viktor Sabottka in the 1970s;61 the other was excavated in 1954 by Victor Ghirghis, then director of the Greco- Roman Museum.62 The Fort Saleh Arcosolium The first of these tombs (fig. 12) was initially found by Breccia in the area of the former Fort Saleh63 dur- ing the construction of two new roads, the Sharia el Mafrouza almost parallel to the quay of the port and another crossing it. Most of the tombs in this section of the western necropolis excavated by Breccia were fosse tombs or loculus tombs, crowned above with grave markers set up on stepped bases, and almost all were despoiled or in ruins, as were the surface monuments. Better preserved was the hypogeum with a painted chamber that Sabottka later recov- ered along with 10 other hypogea. Tomb 1, the hy- pogeum found by Breccia, was 50 m to the north- west of the point of intersection of the two new roads built in the 1930s, under the current Sharia Ibn Minqaz.64 A rock-cut staircase provided access to an open court from which rooms cut with loculi ex- tended primarily on a north-south axis.65 The painted chamber formed a deep niche at the far north end of the tomb complex. Unlike the Stagni Tomb, the facade of the Fort Saleh Tomb is in Egyptian style, framed by columns with lotus flowers inscribed near the base and crowned with composite floral capitals that support a straight lintel. An Egyptian broken lintel was attached to the inner faces of the columns. Behind the Egyptianizing facade the lower part of the niche was occupied by a Ptolemaic rock-cut kline- sarcophagus instead of the Roman-type sarcophagus of the Stagni Tomb. The Fort Saleh sarcophagus imitates the type of bronze bed with finely turned legs that is well known from Hellenistic and early Roman contexts outside Alexandria,66 but it is one of the few klinai of this 61 E.

Cushions are arranged at both the head and foot of the bed, a fulcrum holds the mattress in place, and a simulation of a painted cloth described by Breccia as striped with richly varicolored bands covers the mattress and appears to fall behind the horizontal bar of the bed, descending almost to the ground.69 The connection of the Fort Saleh arcosolium to the Stagni Tomb, however, lies not in the kline but in the decoration of the back wall of the tomb where the Fort Saleh Tomb shows three shallow niches. The central niche extends as far down as the mat- tress; the two niches at either end extend as far as the cushions at the foot and head of the bed. The central niche of the Fort Saleh Tomb, like the niche of the Stagni Tomb, was crowned by a frieze of uraei forming a pseudonaos; in it, as is the female figure in the Stagni niche, was painted an Osiris standing frontally and provided with a crook and a flail. The painting in the two other niches in the Fort Saleh Tomb had been effaced by earlier clandestine exca- vators, but traces of confronted snakes could still be made out in the spaces between the bottom of the two niches and the mattress. Other divinities were painted to the left and right of the trio of niches: at the right a seated female deity, whom Breccia suggests must have been Isis; at the left, a Thoth or a Horus in profile to right. Traces of two more figures of the mummiform Osiris remained on the lateral walls of the tomb niche. The ceiling of the niche had been decorated to imitate a rich drapery or else a bal- dachin.70 Aside from the similarity of the painted figure in the niche, the painting in the Fort Saleh Tomb suggests the type of decoration that the Stagni Tomb almost certainly once bore. Based on the apparent style of the ghost image near the locu- lus opening, however, I am convinced that the lost decoration in the Stagni Tomb was treated in a ge- nerically classical, rather than an Egyptian, manner. The Ghirghis Tomb The tomb excavated by Victor Ghirghis (fig. 13) that can be compared to the Stagni Tomb is even more remarkable than the Fort Saleh Tomb. Despite the decoration in low relief of the best-known of all Alexandrian tombs, the Main Grave at Kom el- Shoqafa,71 tombs decorated with relief sculpture are rare in Alexandria,72 and the Ghirghis Tomb pro- vides one of the few examples. A. Adriani has described it based on Ghirghis's notes and photographs.73 The entrance to the kline chamber was framed with a Doric doorway flanked by two Agathodaimons carved in relief, similar to-but much simpler than-those flanking the entrance to the Main Tomb at Kom el- Shoqafa.74 The ceiling of the room was painted to simulate alabaster. Both the long and the short walls above the funer- ary kline were carved with low reliefs. As in the Stagni Tomb, but rendered with far greater complex- ity, the back wall had a naos in Egyptian style. The sculpted decoration of the tomb, however, followed Greek (or Macedonian) style and iconography. To the right of the central niche formed by the frame- work of the naos was carved a cuirass with a double row of pteryges and a cloth band tied at the waist; to the left was carved a helmet with cheekpieces and a high crest, 75 seen frontally, a pair of greaves, and a 67Two other examples are both from the western necropolis. One is in a tomb discovered by Breccia and is known from a drawing (Adriani 1966, 148, no. 94 and pl. 81, fig. 267 [incorrectly given as cat. no. 93]); the other is from a hypogea discovered in 1950-1951 (see Adriani 1966, 157, no. 110 and pl. 81, fig. 270). The bed shown in the drawing of the tomb from the Antoniadis Garden (H. Thiersch, Zwei antike Grabanlagen bei Alexandria [Berlin 1904] pl. 6; Adriani 1966, 143, no. 90, pls. 64-65) has flat legs with volutes, not the turned legs seen in the drawing (see Adriani 1966, 144). The bed in the painting of the central niche of the Tigrane Tomb (see M.S. Venit, "The Tomb from Tigrane Pasha Street and the Iconography of Death in Roman Alexandria," AJA 101 [1997] 701-29 esp. 711, figs. 7-8) shows a bed with turned legs. The final pub- lication of the new Gabbari tombs will show whether the kline found there had legs that are turned or flat. 68 Although in the case of the Fort Saleh niche, the en- try is effected into the short side instead of the long side of the sarcophagus. 69 Breccia, Le Mus&amp;e 1925-1931 (supra n. 61) 37. 70 Breccia, Le Mus&amp;e 1925-1931 (supra n. 61) 37. 71 ExpSieglin pls. 22, 25, 27-35; see also Rowe, BSRAA 35 (supra n. 11) pls. 5-11 (after Guilleron in F.W.

On the short wall at the right were carved two spears and a large round hoplite shield with offset rim.76 On the short left wall was a small, bearded herm. The naiskos in Egyptian style that created the niche in the center of the back wall was comprised of three concentric doorways. The outermost was framed with colonnettes with bell or papyriform capitals that supported a heavy lintel divided lengthwise by a nar- row torus. Below the torus a winged sun disc was carved in very low relief. Above the torus that framed the top of the lintel was a frieze of uraei. The second doorway was similar to the first, but the lintel was supported on high impost blocks. It appears to have two sun discs, one above and one below the horizon- tal torus. The innermost doorway was flat, with a l- shaped torus molding on its surface. It, too, was crowned with a frieze of uraei. Its doors seem to have been shown as closed. The Tomb Niches The niches of the Fort Saleh Tomb, the Ghirghis Tomb, and the Stagni Tomb are similar in that all replicate Egyptian religious architectural elements. The niches of the Stagni Tomb and the Fort Saleh Tomb, with their capping friezes of uraei, form pseudo- naiskoi each enclosing a deity, whereas the niche in the Ghirghis Tomb shows an Egyptian naos plastically articulated similar to the painted naos in the niche of the Stagni Tomb. Although treated differently, the niches in all three tombs form false doorways in the wall behind the sarcophagus. Although prob- ably not connected with the Egyptian false door that permits the passage of the spirit of the deceased to leave and reenter the tomb, false doorways were an integral part of Alexandrian tomb design almost from its onset: loculus-closing slabs in the form of Doric doorways are common in early Ptolemaic hy- pogea in the eastern necropolis,77 and the three tombs continue the tradition but appropriating an Egyptian style. The Architecture of the Stagni Aedicula. The naiskos of the Ghirghis Tomb and the one painted in the niche of the Stagni Tomb imitate Egyptian temple facades. These are the only two instances known to 76 For the carved arms, see those painted above the bed at Sidi Gabr, noted by Thiersch (Adriani 1966, 139, no. 88). Adriani dates the tomb to the late Hellenistic period (second to first cent.) on the basis of the form of the arms and the inclusion of the Egyptian niche. Also compare the shields carved on the facade of the kline room in the tomb from Antoniadis Garden (Thiersch, Zwei antike Graban- lagen [supra n. 67] pl. 5).

The Stagni shrine (see fig. 11) consists of two columns8" formed of drums alternating yellow ocher and white, all outlined in black. In color change and uniform proportion of its blocks, the shafts recall the piers that flank the Egyptianizing doorway between rooms 1 and 2 in the late Ptolemaic tomb 2 in Anfoushy8' and similarly articulated ones from the elaborate, plastically modeled loculus slab from room 4 of tomb 5 of the same necropolis.82 In both An- foushy examples the capitals are Egyptian bell capi- tals, but the form of the Stagni naos capitals is diffi- cult to determine. They may have been intended as composite capitals similar to those that crown the piers flanking the niches of the Main Tomb at Kom el-Shoqafa8 or those on the columns of a Roman- period loculus slab in naiskos form excavated near the property of the Bank of Athens in what had been the western necropolis and which also should have been near the Gabbari tombs mentioned above;84 they may have been intended as palmiform. In either case their cursory treatment makes any certain iden- tification impossible. The columns support a heavy lintel with a frieze comprised of tadpole-shaped uraei. The lintel is set directly above the capitals, eliminating the abacus that is usually employed as a major intermediary ele- ment between the capitals and the lintel in an Egyp- tian building (as it is in the naos of the Ghirghis Tomb) and one that provides a visual disengagement of column from lintel.85 Beyond this idiosyncracy, both the form and the ornament of the lintel ap- pear to have been misunderstood. The lintel of an Egyptian aedicula is normally flat with only a hori- zontal narrow torus dividing it lengthwise in half; less often it takes the form of a cavetto. The loculus closing slab from Anfoushy tomb 5 provides an ex- ample of the first treatment; the doorway of An- foushy tomb 2 gives an example of the second.86 In the Stagni painting the ends of the lintel are squared off, so that the lintel is to be read as flat, but two heavy black curved lines (which look as if they are meant to replicate consoles) connect the edge of the lintel to the overhanging pediment above; here the painter may have changed his mind and tried to re- produce the curve of a cavetto. The ornament of the lintel is as idiosyncratic as its form, since its frieze of uraei more commonly represents a crowning ele- ment.87 Variations do exist but in monuments that owe as much to Greece as they do to Egypt. A loculus- closing slab from Marsa Matruh, for example, with a segmental pediment, has a lintel with a Doric frieze comprised of five units that serve as triglyphs alter- nating with the four plain areas of the metopes. In- stead of straight cuts, however, each "triglyph" is con- structed of a uraeus carved within a schematic naiskos. To add further Doric credibility to the frieze, guttae are hung under each "triglyph."88 A Roman-period tomb from Gabbari provides a second synthetic ex- ample. On the lintel of one of the doors in the tomb, groups of three upright uraei are imaginatively used to simulate the three elements that constitute the triglyph.89 The painter of the Stagni Tomb adopts 7 See supra n. 14 and infra n. 81. 79 See supra n. 14. 80 That on the right seems to define some of the compo- nent blocks with curves. 8l See Annuaire 1940-1950, 70, fig. 40 and pl. 36.1. 82 See Annuaire 1940-1950, 92, fig. 54 and pl. 38, fig. 2. - See ExpSieglin, pls. 20 and 21; Rowe, BSRAA 35 (supra n. 11) pl. 8. 4 Alexandria 21763; Le musie 1925-1931, pl. 23.85. 85 For the Egyptian abacus, see G.Jequier, Manuel d'archeol- ogie egyptienne: Les Elments de l'architecture (Paris 1924) 172- 74; G. Leick, A Dictionary of Ancient Near Eastern Architecture (New York 1988) 1. Egyptian abacus blocks are normally the width of the greatest diameter of the column, and their height is half or a third of their length depending on the period. Therefore, they are narrower than the top of the swelling capital common in the Graeco-Roman period and create a visual disjunction between the capital and the lintel. Further added height and a similar disjunction be- tween the column and the lintel is often provided by the ends of crossbeams set immediately on the capital below the lintel. For loculus slabs that show this disjunction, see that from the Bank of Athens site noted above (Pensa- bene 1993, pl. 117, 8) and others in the Graeco-Roman Museum (see Pensabene 1993, pl. 117, figs. 6, 7 [from Marsa Matruh] and 9; pl. 118, figs. 3-8; Pensabene, "Lastre di chiusura .. ." [supra n. 14] pl. 10.4; pl. 11.1- 10). The doorway in Anfoushy Tomb 2 and the loculus closing slab from Anfoushy Tomb 5 (see supra ns. 81 and 82), like the Stagni naos, both eliminate this element. 86 See supra ns. 81 and 82. 87 See the Anfoushy examples mentioned above (supra ns. 81 and 82) and the loculus slab and stelai figured by Pensabene 1993, pl. 117, 3-10 and pl. 118, 3, 5, 7, and 8. 88 Pensabene 1993, pls. 117, 7, and 136 (below). 89 Below a segmental pediment.

Enough of the paint on the lintel of the Stagni naos is preserved to assure that the uraei continued uninterrupted across the frieze and that no pseudo-Doric metope-triglyph frieze was intended. The segmental pediment of the Stagni painted naos is handled at once idiosyncratically and curso- rily, and the cornice that frames the segmental pedi- ment has been both simplified and misunderstood. First, instead of the fine torus that is expected sur- rounding the curved segment of the pediment, the painter has framed the entire pediment with a simple flat molding with squares alternating black and yel- low, forming a pattern of more or less equally sized shapes all around. It is the same pattern seen on the cornices of the triangular pediment of the tomb and, like it, might be imagined as denticulation framing the entire pediment instead of just below the horizontal cornice as is normal with Egyptian segmental pediments. Second, as in the triangular pediment of the Stagni Tomb itself, a winged sun disc spreads across the segmental pediment of the painted naos. In the Roman period, segmental pedi- ments usually carry at most a simple central disc,90 whereas winged discs--especially those with hori- zontal wings and upright uraei-are more often found on lintels. These peculiarities in the treatment of the cornices and in the placement of the winged disc should confirm that the same painter was re- sponsible for both the interior and the exterior dec- oration of the tomb. Two disconnected forms below the architrave and within the frame provided by the columns beg cer- tain decipherment, but it is conceivable that they are the capitals of two columns painted so as to appear in perspective.91 Parallel lines below these forms would indicate the beginning of the shafts, and an infrared photograph suggests the shaft of that on the right. A column painted to create a sense of perspec- tive is known from tomb 8 in the late Ptolemaic necropolis at Ras el Tin, and piers intended to create a sense of three-dimensional space on a flat plane are carved in high relief in the burial chamber of the very late Ptolemaic/early Roman-period tomb exca- vated in the Antoniadis Garden.92 If these shapes painted in the Stagni naiskos are column capitals, the sense of perspective they create further connects this Roman-period tomb to its Ptolemaic forebears. The Stagni naos also lacks the broken lintel seen in the framing elements of the sarcophagus niche in the Fort Saleh Tomb, which is a feature of Ptolemaic- and Roman-period Egyptian temples. A broken lin- tel is also seen in the doorway and on the naiskos- formed loculus slab from the Anfoushy necropolis and on the more careful of the Roman-period naiskos- shaped loculus slabs. Diana Wolfe Larkin has identi- fied the significance of the broken lintel in her dis- sertation, "The Broken-Lintel Doorway of Ancient Egypt and its Decoration.9"" She notes that whereas the broken lintel may have been introduced for practical reasons, it acquired, over its 1,700-year his- tory, an overlay of religious meaning, serving as a horizon symbol, a sun gate, and a doorway of appear- ances,94 and she further argues that it could be em- ployed to herald and mark the epiphany of a deity.95 In either case, but particularly in the latter, the inclu- sion of a broken lintel would have been an appropri- ate addition in the Stagni naos. The Female Figure in the Aedicula. Inside the aedic- ula a female figure (figs. 14 and 15) stands frontally, her head turned to her right. She is flanked to either side by a crouching sphinx relaxing on a base (see fig. 11). The sphinxes wear nemes headdresses, and at least the one to our right appears to have one paw raised. The female figure wears a diadem comprised of a central yellow disc surrounded by green rays. She holds her hands at the level of her breasts, her elbows out to either side, and she holds a staff, which terminates in a lotus bud, so that it passes over her right shoulder. It is clear that the figure is not nude: a garment covers at least her lower body. Although it is difficult to make out how the upper part of this garment is arranged, it is certain that it is pulled tight around her hips and legs. The constriction of the garment is indicated both in its contour, which follows the form of the limbs underneath, and in a se- ries of parallel diagonal lines that slant from proper left down to proper right. Crossing these lines at right angles are at least four more lines drawn from proper right slanting down to proper left. The female figure can be none other than Isis- Aphrodite.

One, a limestone funerary stele in Turin,o03 shows a nude Aphrodite-Anadyomene type wearing the disc and horns of Isis crouching on two crocodiles. The deity is framed by an Egyptian naos comprised of two columns supporting a lintel- decorated with a disc with uraei-that is capped with a frieze of uraei; an Egyptian broken lintel set against the columns frames the group of goddess and crocodiles, bearing out Larkin's observation that the broken lintel signals epiphany. Another object, a ter- racotta plaque in the Graeco-Roman Museum,104 shows a female deity, half draped, standing in a very schematically rendered Egyptian temple crowned with a segmental pediment that bears a central disc. To emphasize the deity's identity, four columns with Hathor-head capitals support the lintel, which is dec- orated with a frieze of uraei. Breccia comments cor- rectly that the goddess must be Isis-Aphrodite even though she wears neither diadem nor crown. Like the goddess in the Stagni naos, she is frontal, but much more rigidly presented, and she is half draped, her garment wrapped below her stomach to cover her lower legs. A Trajanic nome coin from Aphroditopolis, now in the Bibliotheque Nationale, and a less fine one in the Dattari Collection105 also show Isis-Aphrodite in temple format. She stands to left in a naos with a sphinx on a pedestal at the right. The two plumes she wears on her head identify her as Isis. She also wears a chiton with mantle pulled around her waist and looped over her left arm, and she holds a scepter in her left hand. Her identity as the eponymous goddess of the nome that struck the coin, and her garments, too, indicate her as a syncre- tism of Isis and Aphrodite. The crown of the Stagni Isis-Aphrodite consists of a central disc surrounded by rays. The rayed diadem, normally associated with Helios and with nimbused Roman emperors from the deified Augustus on- ward,106 is also worn by Souchos, an Egyptian solar deity assimilated to Helios,107 and Serapis, the con- sort of Isis.10s The crown of the Stagni Isis-Aphrodite finds a nebulous parallel in a number of small bronze Isis figurines that wear "palmette"-flanked basileions, in which the "palmettes" assume the form of rays.109 A closer correspondence is found in an- other bronze statuette in which a nude Isis-Aphrodite wears a diadem comprised of wide rays surrounding the basileion.110 Closest to the form of the Stagni fig- ure's crown are two small bronze radiate crowns, dis- associated from any statuette, that have a central disc with a uraeus surrounded by six rays."11 The presence of the disc on these crowns should connect them to Isis. 1o G.

The orig- inal publication of the tomb identifies the goddess as nude; I also identified the goddess as nude in a pa- per in December 1995.112 In fact, as I have indicated here in the description of the painting, the goddess is not nude. Instead, she wears a garment drawn closely about her lower body. She appears to be nude because the garment adheres to the contour of her body and because indication of its "draping" is lim- ited to parallel, nearly straight, diagonal lines. Some of these lines still appear painted in black on the white ground of the garment; others are seen in narrow grooves on the surface of the slab, which may indicate where painted lines once had been. These diagonal lines are clear from the plane of the figure's hips as far as her calves where the image loses almost all its detail. In at least four places, op- posing diagonal black lines cross the initial lines, and a strong vertical line bisects the figure from just above to just below her knees. Two types of Isis statues and statuettes are preva- lent in Egypt: one is a type intended to invoke an Egyptian stylistic model; the second is consonant with stylistic precepts of the Roman center. The first type aspires to replicate an Egyptian standing female figure. Isis stands in a symmetrical pose, her weight evenly distributed between both feet. She wears a closely fitted garment of sheer material that is pulled tightly about her to left and right, its tautness and fineness indicated by the linear diagonal folds that radiate from a knot between her breasts; a heavy, central fold emerging from the same knot falls verti- cally the length of the garment, emphasizing the symmetry of the figure. The Isis type based on a clas- sical model stands in a more relaxed, differentiated pose and is dressed in various ways, but often in a chiton and mantle, and always in garments that fall in plastically rendered folds. When she is seen as Isis- Aphrodite she can also be nude or half dressed, and in this form she often follows a known Aphrodite type. Even when carved or cast or molded in the roughest manner,113 a general similarity in the treat- ment of folds is maintained: when the folds are indi- cated on one or more diagonals, they are either drawn symmetrically to either side of the central fold (as in the Egyptian type) or they are indicative of two separate garments (as in the classical type). In no case in which Isis-or Isis-Aphrodite-is garbed in customary fashion do diagonal lines that cross the width of the figure (which, in the classical types, should indicate a mantle drawn about the hips) con- tinue in a single direction the length of the figure; in no instance of the deity dressed in her usual manner do the lines indicating these folds intersect as they do on the Stagni figure. I know of two exceptions: one is on a small marble statue from the sanctuary of Isis on the acropolis at Cyrene;114 the second is on a late Roman plastic lamp found in the Athenian agora (fig. 16).115 In the marble statuette, the figure wears a mantle held over her shoulders and, tightly bound over her chiton, a rhombic-patterned garment that replicates the wrap- pings of a Roman-period mummy. She has been in- terpreted not as Isis but as an image of an initiate into the cult of Isis shown symbolically rising from the dead."116 The figure on the plastic lamp, however, seems intended either as the deity herself or as the deceased assimilated to the deity. Her headdress, comprised of three feathers, connects her with Isis. C. Grandjouan, who published the lamp, describes the terracotta figure as "swathed in cross bands, some of which are decorated with a faint stamped pattern of small circles""7 that might show an at- tempt to render Roman-period rhombic bandaging. Regardless, this figure, too, is wrapped as a mummy. The Stagni Isis-Aphrodite is not posed stiffly as a mummy. Her upper torso does not appear entirely frontal, nor does she gaze directly ahead. Her left shoulder is lowered and her right is slightly raised 112 At the Meeting of the Archaeological Association of America.

Late Roman plastic lamp from the Athenian Agora (Agora 50 3017). (Courtesy of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, Agora Excavations) responding to the placement of the staff that she carries. Yet, for a figure so well drawn as the Isis- Aphrodite, her stance is disconcerting. Her left hip is higher than her right and thrust out in a long, lush curve, as if the weight is carried by that leg; her right hip appears correctly lowered and her right leg straighter. Taken in silhouette, the figure stands in what appears to be a hip-shot pose. Yet this impression of a differentiated pose is miti- gated by the vertical line that bisects the lower part of the figure and accords the entire lower body an appearance of strict frontality and symmetry that a differentiated pose should deny. Despite the weight shift implicit in her raised left hip and her corre- spondingly lowered left shoulder, a viewer merely glancing at the image would take it for a stiffly posed frontal figure. It is perhaps possible that the wrapping lines of the Stagni figure's garment might indicate a mantle drawn around the figure, but given the general par- allelism of the lines, their repetition down the length of the figure, the perceived pose of the figure, and the crossing diagonal lines, a better but potentially more controversial explanation is that they indicate a mummy cloth. Isis-Aphrodite as mummiform also explains two other difficulties with her pose, that is, the position of her hands and her relationship to the object that appears over her proper right shoulder. The hands of Isis-Aphrodite are clasped, or clasp something, at the level of her breasts. In this position they sometimes cradle Horus, although normally the deity is seated when they do; but there is no indica- tion of Horus here, and this gesture leaves unex- plained the object near her right shoulder. Her two hands clasped between her breasts recall the way Osiris holds his crook and flail. If she is seen as mum- miform, or even partly mummiform, her gesture can be seen as replicating his, although she would hold the staff with lotus bud. This gesture would also explain the lines that remain between her breasts, for they would correspond to her thumbs held vertically, pro- jecting above her clenched fists as they grasp the staff. CULTURE AND GENDER IN ALEXANDRIAN FUNERARY IMAGERY Since the late 1960s"8 ethnicity has been de- scribed as a social construct rather than a biological imperative and as a dynamic cognitive system rather than a static classification. In shifting the focus from the internal characteristics of the group to the group's self-perceived boundaries, biological descent is re- placed as an ethnic signifier by self-identification (providing that others in the group concur with this identification). Consequently, the common culture shared by the group is seen to be a result-rather than a primary and definitional characteristic-of the ethnic group. Distinguishing in this manner be- tween culture and ethnicity permits one ethnic group to adopt features of another-as the Alexan- drian, ethnically Greek population adopted aspects of Egyptian culture-without automatically imply- ing a change in the ethnic identity of that group. 118 This system of ethnicity was first articulated by Fred- rik Barth in his introduction, in F. Barth, ed., Ethnic Groups and Boundaries: The Social Organization of Culture Dif- ference (Boston 1969) 9-38; see also, more recently, K. Goudriaan, Ethnicity in Ptolemaic Egypt (Amsterdam 1988); U. Ostergaird, "What is National and Ethnic Identity," in P. Bilde et al. eds., Ethnicity in Hellenistic Egypt (Aarhus 1992) 16-38; K.

In Alexandria, the administra- tive center of Egypt in the Ptolemaic and Roman pe- riods, Greeks (and later Romans) held the high ad- ministrative posts. Speaking and writing Greek and being accepted as Greek, even after the Roman con- quest, were keys to economic success and social fa- vor. Initially, senior assignments in the civil admin- istration and in the military were reserved for Macedonians and Greeks. Only Greeks were permit- ted to become citizens, and intermarriage between Greeks and non-Greeks was forbidden. But since Ptolemaic society was marked not only by ethnic divi- sions but also by social stratification, and since social stratification became the decisive factor, it was diffi- cult to maintain the rigid segregation between Greeks and Egyptians."119 Intermarriage between Greeks and Egyptians in the chora was common,120 and even in Alexandria intermarriage occurred. A pragmatic Hel- lenization was common among the Egyptian elite. In order to compete in the bureaucracy, Egyptians as- sumed Greek names and learned and spoke Greek.'21 Because of the distinction drawn between culture and ethnicity, the manifestation of any particular ethnic identity may also vary in different social and historical contexts, over time, and when transported to different environments, as when Greeks and Macedonians colonize Egypt and when Romans conquer the conquerors. In multiethnic Alexandria the Stagni Tomb stands as a tangible paradigm demonstrating the dynamic relationship between two of the legally distinct ethnic groups of the an- cient city and, at the same time, revealing the sub- stantive diversity in cultural content within the greater Greek ethnic community. Alexandria was a Macedonian foundation estab- lished on the shores of Egypt: it was in Egypt but it was not of Egypt. Almost from its inception, Alexan- dria was a multiethnic community, its population drawn not only from Macedonia and from much of the Greek-speaking world but also incorporating Syr- ians, Persians, Jews, Gauls, and native Egyptians. Yet, founded by Alexander in a foreign land at the edge of a vital and venerated foreign culture, it initially strove to confirm and maintain a Greek identity. After its conquest by Rome, Alexandria still preserved the Greek patina established by its Ptolemaic rulers. Its material culture retained Greek elements and added Roman ones. Its religious architecture-with the possible exception of the shrine to Isis Kourotro- phos, if indeed such a shrine existed-followed a Greek model,122 and to a large degree its religious and civic sculpture demonstrates a classical contin- uum.123 The city's plan, its colonnaded streets, its so- cial institutions, and its villas and their mosaic deco- ration all compare favorably to others throughout the Roman empire;124 in architectural conceit, its hy- pogea recall their Hellenistic predecessors. Alexandrian monumental tombs enshrine the burial of elite members of Alexandrian society, and mortuary ritual-and its material manifestation-is invariably conservative. In Alexandria burial ritual seems to have followed Roman practice more closely than elsewhere in Egypt: although mummification exists, painted coffins are rare, and evidence for elaborate mummies with mummy portrait or carton- nage known from other regions of Egypt is wholly lacking; inhumation without embalming and crema- tion are far more common. Triclinium-shaped cham- bers for the funerary and memorial repasts are either incorporated into the fabric of the tomb, as at the catacombs of Kom el-Shoqafa,125 or conceptually ex- pressed as in the tomb from Tigrane Pasha Street and the great catacomb from Wardian.126 Although the impetus for a funerary banquet in association with the tomb may be Egyptian,'27 the specific form I19 See, e.g., K.A.D.

Names of the dead that have been preserved in the tombs are Hellenically derived, and the language in which they and their concomitant inscriptions are written is Greek.l'8 Yet, despite the persistence of an active classical cultural modality especially in mortu- ary convention, it is primarily in funerary context that Alexandria meets Egypt. It is most likely that the elite occupants of monu- mental Alexandrian tombs identified themselves as Greeks and later as Greeks or Romans because of the social and economic advantages adhering to mem- bership in these two groups. The Stagni Tomb pro- vides a case study of the appropriation of Egyptian religious imagery to serve the interests of these in- habitants of Roman-ruled Alexandria and, at the same time, it demonstrates the endurance and preser- vation of Greek modes of visual communication. Most strikingly, however, the Stagni Tomb demonstrates how Egyptian and Greek (and Roman) style, content, and belief can intermingle to produce something that is wholly identifiable with the culture of neither one nor the other ethnic group, and how these elements can interact to create an entirely new visual semantic system. It reflects the extension of the boundaries of Greek and Roman ethnicity beyond those recog- nized elsewhere in the Mediterranean world. In the fifth century B.C., Herodotus (2.50, 52-53) was able to credit the Egyptians with the oldest and the most venerable gods, and despite visceral Greek and Roman aversion toward zoomorphic deities, the proliferation of cults of carefully selected gyno- morphic and anthropomorphic Egyptian deities- specifically Isis and Serapis-throughout the Greek and, later, the Roman world asserts the universality of his observation. In Alexandria, however, Egyptian deities were not just included in the pantheon: they were given pride of place, although in the religious life of the city Egyptian gods were afforded a Ptole- maic and then a Roman face. Serapis, the god im- ported into the city and given human form by Ptolemy I, was conflated with Zeus; he and his consort, Isis, re- clothed in classical garments, were the city's most prominent deities. Hermanoubis, an anthropomor- phic syncretism of Hermes and Anubis, was wor- shiped in a sanctuary at Ras el Soda to the east of the city;129 falcon-headed Horus became the child Harpocrates, and Anubis could literally assume Ro- man dress, as he does at Stagni. Despite their Hellenization in official Ptolemaic cult and Anubis's armor notwithstanding, in funer- ary context Egyptian deities normally retain their na- tive form. The winged sun disc and the Horus "fal- cons" of the Stagni Tomb (the falcons elsewhere rendered more traditionally) are ubiquitous in Alex- andrian funerary design; Osiris is a frequent pres- ence, as in the Fort Saleh Tomb, as are other phara- onic mortuary deities: Isis and her sister, Nephthys, Anubis, Thoth, and Ma'at.130 Infrequent or absent in funerary context are Graeco-Egyptian deities in syn- cretic form: the Isis-Nemesis sphinx is rare and Isis- Aphrodite is currently unique to Stagni. With the exception of the armed Anubis-whose idiosyn- cratic appearance restates his Egyptian function- the retention of an Egyptian style (or an Egyptian- like style) for Egyptian deities, even within an ethnically constructed Graeco-Roman context, seems necessary to realize their potency. An extension of the appropriation of the Egyptian style and religious iconography in Alexandrian tomb design is the appropriation of Egyptian religious concepts. Whereas it is unlikely that the "false doors" of the Stagni Tomb and others relate directly to Egyp- tian eschatological belief-for, despite the surface similarity of the Egyptian ba and the Greek psyche, Greek and Egyptian views on the eternal residence of the soul are largely incompatible-the concept of heroization seems finally to have been shared. Heroiza- tion, in the form of granting the departed person a blessed afterlife among the gods, was achieved by pri- vate persons in Egypt almost two millennia before Alexander's conquest, and Greece had long heroized selectively. Thus it is not surprising that with the more extensive and intimate Egyptian contact that Alexandria's leading role in the Hellenistic world provided, heroization of the generic dead pene- trated Greece. In Greece, textual evidence for unre- stricted heroization first appears in the third cen- tury B.C. It is first attested in a Theran inscription, the testament of Epikteta,1'1' that describes the in- 128Hieroglyphs appear in relation to Egyptianizing scenes in at least one Roman-period tomb, but they are de- scribed by their excavator-an Egyptologist-as "indeci- pherable" (Habachi [supra n. 56] 276). 129 See supra n. 122. 1"0 For tombs with Egyptianizing figural decoration, see also Anfoushy tomb 2, which dates to the late Ptolemaic period (supra n. 81) and Habachi tomb A at Gabbari (supra n. 56), which is one of the few Roman-period tombs to show only Egyptianizing paintings; the tombs from the "Nebengrab" also include Egyptianizing figural decoration (see ExpSieglin, pls. 60-62), as does the tomb drawn by Fiechter (supra n. 50). 131 IG XII. 330; see A.

Attic inscription from the Piraeus gives a second instance, in which the religious associ- ation is dedicated to Dionysos.132 In each case, the Greek community in which heroization is first en- countered had close and relatively early ties with Egypt and with Egyptian gods. Thera provided a naval base for Ptolemy in the second half of the third century B.C., and the presence of an occupation force and its influence on the cultural and religious life of the island is attested by a series of inscriptions dedicated to the Egyptian divinities Serapis, Isis, and Anubis, not only on behalf of the garrison, but also by other illustrious citizens of Thera who are found among the colleagues of the association of Epik- teta.'I" Connections between the Piraeus and Egypt are even earlier; an inscription attesting to an early sanctuary of Isis in the Piraeus dating at least prior to the last third of the fourth century B.C. and possibly to the end of the fifth134 makes the Piraeus the earli- est site in Greece known to have admitted an Egyp- tian cult. By the late Hellenistic period, heroization was rec- ognized in most regions of Greece, and Alexandria was no exception.'1-5 Yet in Alexandria it also mani- fests itself differently from elsewhere in the Graeco- Roman world, often assuming a purely Egyptian cast. The broken lintel used in the sarcophagus chamber of the Fort Saleh Tomb, on the funerary stele in Turin, on loculus slabs, and elsewhere in Alexan- drian religious iconography appropriates an Egyp- tian emblem to heroize the dead. Yet in the Stagni Tomb the heroization of the deceased is achieved by employing both classical and Egyptian forms, blur- ring the distinction between the cultural contribu- tions of the two ethnic groups. The strongest purely Greek element of the Stagni Tomb-the aedicula that constitutes the tomb itself-is the only Greek component that finds a ready parallel. As early as the fourth century in Greece, naos- like enclosures framed gravestones, enclosing the de- ceased and the bereaved within. Early Alexandrian grave stelai and loculus-closing slabs replicate this format,136 and the architectural form of Roman- period tombs perpetuate the type. It is most unlikely that the enclosure of the deceased within a naos was originally a sign of heroization, but it would be rea- sonable to assume that later, when heroization be- gan to be applied in many Greek regions to all the dead without distinction,1-7 the naos enclosure might well have served in Alexandria as a heroizing sign, as the epithet heros did in Alexandria and elsewhere in the Graeco-Roman world. In contrast to the Greek form of the naos, the main figure of the tomb, Isis-Aphrodite, adopts an Egyptian iconographical religious vocabulary and fits it to a classical model. The Stagni Isis-Aphrodite is an Alexandrian goddess incorporating an Egyptian deity-already, herself, afforded a classical patina- further classicized by the addition of the Greek Aph- rodite; and whereas mummification is of pure Egyp- tian origin, mummification connected with an Isis-like 1'~ See E.

'~4 IG II2. 337, dated 333/2, permits the establishment of a sanctuary in the Piraeus by the Kitians 'just as the Egyptians have founded a shrine to Isis." W. Judeich, To- pographie von Athen (Munich 1931) 454 conjectures that the cult goes back to the end of the fifth century, citing Ar. Av. 1296 (in which Lycurgus is called an ibis) and the scho- liast to that line. 135 A late Hellenistic funerary stele of the scribe Ammo- nios, for example, discovered in the same Alexandrian quar- ter of Wardian as the Stagni Tomb, and published by E. Bernand, Inscriptions mdtriques de l'Egypte grdco-romaine: Re- cherches sur la podsie ipigrammatique des grecs en Egypte (An- nales Litteraires de l'Universite de Besanion 98, Paris 1969) 259-63, no. 64, refers to the deceased as "heros" who are invoked "like the infernal gods with pure libations and offerings full of regret." Bernand correctly argues (263) that the word "heros" does not signify simply the deceased and cites the phrase immediately following, oxt(i 'auv6vatU xexh6teOa (we do not give you the name of dead), noting that it implies that the heros "preserves a sort of existence that is no longer a vxvg; he is endowed with a sort of supe- rior life that belongs to that of the heros." Bernand further argues that (o)tov&amp;a ot, a libation poured to the gods, is used by the poet precisely to underline the heroization of the deceased. 136 See, e.g., Alexandria 24148 (from Hadra, Ezbet el Makhlouf), A.

The Stagni Tomb's incorpora- tion of Isis-Aphrodite and her placement in a niche directly above the sarcophagus, as that of Osiris in the Fort Saleh Tomb and others, probably signifies more than merely protective intent: in her mum- mification the Isis figure is assimilated to her Egyp- tian consort, Osiris; in the Roman drama of her cul- tic ritual, her initiates are assimilated to Isis/Osiris; in this image in the Stagni Tomb, the image of the mum- mified Isis-Aphrodite is one with her initiate. The ex- traordinary portrayal of Isis-Aphrodite in an Alexan- drian tomb and the further extraordinary portrayal of Isis-Aphrodite mummified suggests uncommon delib- eration in the choice of subject for the tomb. In Roman-period Alexandrian funerary art, women are conspicuous by their absence. During the Ptole- maic period, inscriptions and images on funerary stelai and loculus slabs reveal that women were af- forded memorials in their own names, but during the period of Roman rule-either by accident of survival or by design-portraits on loculus slabs and stelai seem limited to men,138 and no tomb (except perhaps the narrative of the abduction scene of Per- sephone from the "Nebengrab" tombs at Kom el- Shoqafa) shows any subject that is specifically related to women.1'9 In this respect the Stagni Tomb stands apart from all others: it seems certain that it was planned as a woman's sepulcher. While it is implausi- ble that the Stagni Isis-Aphrodite was actually in- tended as a portrait, it is still no far stretch to compare the image to those of matrons in Roman funerary art who depict themselves half-clad as Venus, incorpo- rating the deity's beauty into their catalogue of vir- tues.140 The exceptional choice of Isis-Aphrodite in- stead of the expected mummified Osiris certainly denotes that the now-gutted sarcophagus of the Stagni Tomb held the body of a woman. Her assimilation to a mummified Isis-Aphrodite suggests, as well, that the woman interred in the sarcophagus was a mem- ber of her cult. The elements of the Stagni Tomb unite to form a pictorial program granting preservation for the body of the deceased and immortality for her soul. The figures of Anubis-traditionally guardian of the necropolis- on the piers that laterally frame the opening of the tomb and the Isis-Nemesis sphinxes-emblems that guard against ill treatment of the dead-on the frieze that frame the opening above send apotropaic signals to those who might despoil the tomb. The Egyptian solar symbols of the sun disc and the Horus falcons-if they are notjust stock funerary imagery- relate the soul of the departed to the greater cosmos and, in any case, suitably invoke pharaonic Egypt in the overtly Roman tomb, incorporating the power of the venerated Egyptian signs. It is just possible, be- cause of the construction of their wings, that the erotes may also be references to the soul. Certain, however, is the function of Isis-Aphrodite-wife and mother, lover and nurturer, the wise and the beauti- ful, and the bestower of immortality-centered on the wall behind the sarcophagus in the space most often reserved for her Egyptian consort, Osiris: in the Stagni Tomb the soul of the departed is assimi- lated to Isis-Aphrodite, instead of Osiris, and by her accorded the reward of everlasting life. Incorporat- ing the parameters of gender, while ignoring ethnic boundaries, the Stagni Tomb integrates cultural ma- terials from Alexandria's Greek, Roman, and Egyp- tian ethnic groups in order to create a unique rest- ing place for an Alexandrian woman.
