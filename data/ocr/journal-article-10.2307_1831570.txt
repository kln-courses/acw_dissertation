The Asso- ciation as such takes no partisan attitude, nor does it commit its members to any position on practical economic questions. It is the organ of no party, sect, or institution. Persons of all shades of economic opinion are found among its members, and widely different issues are given a hearing in its annual meetings and through its publications. The Associa- tion, therefore, assumes no responsibility for the opinions expressed by those who participate in its meetings. Needless to say, the papers presented are the personal opinions of the authors and do not commit the organizations or institutions with which they are associated.
