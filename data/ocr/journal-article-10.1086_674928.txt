      <p>On February 17, 1913, an exhibition that we know as the Armory Show opened at the 69th Regiment National Guard Armory in New York City (frontispiece and fig. 1). Featuring about fourteen hundred examples of European and American modern art, including Marcel Duchamp’s controversial <italic>Nude Descending a Staircase (No. 2)</italic> (see fig. 4 in Orcutt essay) the exhibition provoked an explosion of public interest fueled by sensational media coverage, making it a landmark in the emergence of the avant-garde in the United States. One 1913 newspaper headline typifies the excitement: “<sc>visitors throng to armory show—show amazing knowledge and make thorough investigations</sc>—American Exhibits Came in for Their Share of Notice from Critical Observers.”<sup>1</sup>

      <p>However, that headline does not refer to a modern art exhibition in New York. It describes an automobile show held in Philadelphia one month earlier. Reading the article more closely, we learn about “crowds” at this Philadelphia “Armory Show” visiting “the Importers’ Salon and domestic display,” where exhibitors “are kept busy answering . . . rapid fire inquiries regarding the merits of particular cars.” The article goes on to say that “Continental cars, with their eight-cylinder, shaft-drive and marvelous body design, have attracted the attention of wealthy prospective buyers who are in search of motor car perfection in every detail.” Not unlike what happened with the New York art exhibition, Europeans apparently stole this vehicular Armory Show in Philadelphia.<sup>2</sup>
      </p>
      <p>How could there be two Armory Shows in two different cities in 1913, one exhibiting modern art and the other displaying automobiles? The simple answer is that an armory, then as now, was a fairly common type of building that served a number of purposes, including providing spaces for military activities and civilian events of various kinds. Whereas the famous modern art exhibition made its debut at the armory of the New York National Guard’s 69th Regiment at Lexington Avenue and Twenty-Fifth Street in Manhattan (fig. 2), the auto show took place at that of the Pennsylvania National Guard’s First Regiment, located at Broad and Callowhill Streets in Philadelphia.<fig id="fg2" position="float" fig-type="figure">

      <p>Those were just two among hundreds of armories constructed as headquarters for state militia and federal troops across the nation during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Confronted with rapid urbanization and recurring civil unrest, American governmental authorities built armories mainly to keep and symbolize domestic order, especially (though not exclusively) in cities. Technically speaking, there were two subtypes of buildings that shared the armory designation, one serving primarily as a military troop headquarters and the other as an arms factory. The latter subtype could be either a government-run operation or a private commercial enterprise. In all cases, though, weapons storage facilities and other spaces were often opened for public inspection by civilian visitors—tourists—who enjoyed seeing evidence of the nation’s military strength, whether in the form of arms manufacturing processes, troop drills, finished gun displays, or all of the above. Moreover, regardless of technical differences in function, such buildings frequently hosted a variety of popular civilian events. Thus, in the public mind, an armory became a generalized site known for a rich, hybrid cultural life marked by military and nonmilitary uses, activities, and spectacles.<sup>3</sup>
      </p>
      <p>The vitality of armories owed much to their imposing architectural designs, notably their massive masonry structures with large interior spaces and/or exterior grounds. Armories that served as troop headquarters usually had vast drill halls and ordnance displays that were repeatedly celebrated in the pictorial press. One antebellum magazine illustration shows an elaborate formation of armed soldiers in the drill hall of an armory located on White Street in lower Manhattan (fig. 3). Officers in the foreground review the troops while tourists in the background look on.<fig id="fg3" position="float" fig-type="figure">

      <p>Even as armories served such military purposes, they functioned more and more as civic centers for a variety of public gatherings. An 1881 illustration in <italic>Harper’s Weekly</italic> depicts a performance of the New York Musical Festival, held in the drill hall of Manhattan’s grandest armory, the headquarters of the Seventh Regiment (fig. 4). In other words, while military displays at armories became popular attractions in their own right, the buildings also offered convenient space for civilian events (often on a rental basis). The appeal of armories in this regard grew dramatically during the Gilded Age, as Americans organized ever grander extravaganzas.<fig id="fg4" position="float" fig-type="figure">

      <p>Not surprisingly, then, there were many Armory Shows devoted to displaying all sorts of things. Newspaper headlines regularly announced shows at armories around the country in the decades leading up to the <italic>International Exhibition of Modern Art</italic> in 1913. Here are just a few: “<sc>at the armory show sunday</sc>—Many Admirers of the Chrysanthemum Came to See Them Yesterday” (flowers in Kansas City, 1897); “<sc>french aeronauts arrive</sc>—Unusual Collection of Flying Machines and Models in the Armory Show—Motor Car Tendencies” (automobiles and airplanes in New York, 1906); “<sc>fine exhibits for the armory show</sc>” (automobiles in Philadelphia, 1907); “<sc>cups for prize poultry</sc>—Armory Show Concluded with Awards—<sc>and everyone was pleased</sc>” (agriculture in Baltimore, 1911); “<sc>decorations extensive for armory show</sc>” (automobiles in Pawtucket, 1913). Each headline referred to the event in question as an “Armory Show.” References in the articles to “fine exhibits,” extensive “decorating,” and even “gala attire” indicate that people routinely perceived armories as appropriate sites of visual spectacle and aesthetic experience.<sup>4</sup>
      </p>
      <p>The aforementioned 1906 New York car and airplane show, which newspapers praised for its “fine color scheme” and other visual decor, ran jointly at Madison Square Garden and the newly opened 69th Regiment Armory—future site of the <italic>International Exhibition of Modern Art</italic>. Co-sponsored by the Automobile Club of America and the Aero Club of America, the event attracted “nearly 200,000 visitors” in one week, according to <italic>Scientific American</italic>. In addition to displaying electric- and gas-powered automobiles produced by more than 120 domestic and foreign car makers, “This exhibit was the most complete of its kind ever held in any part of the world, for all types of flying machines, balloons, and airships were represented” (fig. 5). The <italic>New York Times</italic> covered the event in a series of articles, reporting in one that “Society was well-represented in the armory show at night,” including such luminaries as John Jacob Astor, Mr. and Mrs. William K. Vanderbilt, Mr. and Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt, Admiral Joseph B. Coghlan, and Colonel Daniel Appleton of the New York National Guard’s Seventh Regiment, among many others. According to another <italic>Times</italic> article, “The private club view given in the 69th Regiment Armory by the Automobile Club of America partook of the ease and elegance of some grand social reception,” where “Ladies wearing costly and brilliantly colored gowns looked at the elegant cars ranged along the aisles and talked about them with as much knowledge of their technical features as their escorts.” Appropriately, “Every salesman and agent was in regulation evening dress, and there was a richness and social air to the public opening last night completely at variance with the majority of industrial exhibits.” Under the headline “<sc>auto club show open</sc>—Attractive Display in New New York Armory—<sc>society turns out in force</sc>,” a <italic>Washington Post</italic> writer observed, “mostly the crowd was composed of members of polite society” who “saw the armory in a gala dress. . . . Artistically, the show has not the magnificence of the one in the Garden, but it has many features not to be found in the old exhibition hall—novelty features which will claim the attention of the general public.”<sup>5</sup>

      <p>Thus, the concept of an Armory Show had become ubiquitous and rather elastic well before the hallowed 1913 exhibit, which the art world regards as <italic>the</italic> Armory Show. The idea of an “armory in a gala dress” might seem strange today, not least for its gendered anthropomorphic reference to a military building, but journalists and visitors to the 69th Regiment’s headquarters in 1906 apparently took it in stride given the nature and frequency of such shows. Indeed, “Armory Show” as a rubric encompassed various kinds of spectacles for some time after 1913. “<sc>all storkdom is at armory show</sc>” declared a 1915 headline in the <italic>Portland Oregonian</italic>, announcing an enormous competitive baby pageant at the local military headquarters. “<sc>feline aristocracy appears at armory show this week</sc>,” reported the <italic>Duluth News Tribune</italic> in 1916, at the opening of a Minnesota cat expo.<sup>6</sup>
      </p>
      <p>In sum, sensational modern art was just one kind of spectacle that visitors might encounter at an armory show. This fact has important historical consequences. For instance, it reminds us that the famous 1913 modern art exhibition was not actually called the “Armory Show” at the time, at least not officially by organizers or the press. In managing the event, members of the Association of American Painters and Sculptors (AAPS) referred to it as an “armory show” occasionally in informal correspondence. In doing so, they appropriated a ready-made colloquial term already in wide circulation for describing a multitude of different events. In catalogues, posters, correspondence, and other ephemera, the AAPS called its show the <italic>International Exhibition of Modern Art</italic>. Not until later did the exhibition become widely known as the Armory Show. The latter term appeared only sporadically—often in lowercase letters—in art periodicals during the late 1910s, 1920s, and early 1930s. In 1938 Walt Kuhn, secretary of the AAPS and one of the exhibition’s lead organizers, firmly established the now familiar nomenclature when he published his retrospective account, <italic>The Story of the Armory Show</italic>. Many subsequent publications by art historians have followed suit, institutionalizing and reifying “the Armory Show” as an accepted designation for the exhibition.<sup>7</sup>
      </p>
      <p>That process of art historical reification—turning the idea of an armory show into an exclusively modern art thing—has obviously obscured an older cultural phenomenon, one that included a broad range of public extravaganzas at military facilities. We might call that phenomenon the spectacular life of a building type, the armory, before 1913. The present essay reanimates that lively spectacle and its deeper historical roots. Such an inquiry necessarily leads back to the middle of the nineteenth century, when rapidly developing forces of industrial production, media, and nationalism made armories into tourist attractions and sites of public display. The point here is not that organizers of the Armory Show had antebellum armories in mind when they devised their modern art exhibition. They didn’t. But their decision to rent the 69th Regiment Armory on Lexington Avenue was the result of more than a mere accident of available real estate in Manhattan. It depended on and participated in a tradition of public attractions associated with armories—attractions that involved a peculiar combination of tourism, militarism, commerce, public display, and aesthetic spectacle. After exploring this tradition’s nineteenth-century roots, I will return to “the” Armory Show to highlight certain actions and metaphors surrounding the exhibition that reveal continuities with the past. As we will see, the exhibition organizers strategically adapted aspects of the preexisting armory show idea in framing their modern art extravaganza as a spectacular act of aesthetic revolt calculated to appeal to middle-class and elite consumers of art. In the process, the 69th Regiment Armory came alive as a building with its own associations, history, and agency that intervened in framing the event as well.</p>
      <sec id="sc1">
         <title>Arts and Arms</title>
         <p>Tracing the deeper history of the armory show phenomenon offers a new method for complicating mythic interpretations of the <italic>International Exhibition of Modern Art</italic> as an aesthetic rupture and political revolt. Despite the media frenzy surrounding Duchamp’s <italic>Nude</italic> and other European works at the 1913 show, modernism did not arrive overnight in America from abroad as a sudden, explosive break from the past. Rather, it emerged more gradually as part of a longer historical process with important connections to broader public discourse and significant debts to the nineteenth century, including earlier armory shows.</p>
         <p>In a manner consistent with those preceding events, “the” Armory Show neither promised nor delivered social revolution as part of its aesthetic program, even though Kenyon Cox, an archconservative academic artist, famously denounced the cubists represented in the show as “revolutionaries” and “anarchists . . . who would overthrow all social laws.” Repudiating such claims in the exhibition’s mission statement, AAPS president Arthur B. Davies firmly asserted, “the Society has embarked on no propaganda. It proposes to enter on no controversy with any institution.” Similarly, Davies’s fellow organizer Walter Pach defended the cubists as not “in any way ‘subversive.’” Looking back on the event twenty-five years later and pondering the reason for its success, Kuhn quoted President Calvin Coolidge: “‘America’s business is business.’ Therein lies the answer.” Not unlike the 1906 auto and airplane show held at the same armory (and similar trade fairs), the <italic>International Exhibition of Modern Art</italic> mixed aesthetics, novelty, and commerce in creating a public spectacle. In this context, “revolution” meant innovation, not radical social change.<sup>8</sup>
         </p>
         <p>By questioning modernist myths of originality and radicalism, my project complements the recent work of Dennis Raverty, Michael Leja, J. M. Mancini, and other scholars who have critically situated the avant-garde in relation to wider historical forces and discourses. Mancini in particular offers a chastening revision of utopian beliefs about the Armory Show as an event that represented a convergence of artistic and social rebellion: “In coupling modernist revolt with a broad array of social and political transformations, historians’ accounts of the Armory Show duplicate and magnify not only the chronology of crisis inherent in accounts of modernism’s ascendance, but their characterizations of the two eras at odds in the show—the bourgeois ‘Victorian’ and the radical ‘modern.’” “This conceptualization,” says Mancini, “is misleading.” Thanks to her close reading of art-world criticism and institutions in the United States before 1913, we now know that viewing the Armory Show as a starkly polemical clash between conservative academics and progressive avant-gardists oversimplifies a much more fluid, complex situation. Mancini cautions against radical nostalgia while reminding us that the seeds of modernism in America long predated 1913.<sup>9</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Concurring with Mancini but taking a different approach, I focus here on things and images as opposed to art-world criticism and institutions. Specifically, my interpretation attends to the architecture of armory buildings, their traditions of display, and media representations in order to recover neglected evidence of militarism, commerce, and public spectacle in the 1913 Armory Show and its antecedents. Along the way, I highlight an important but often overlooked aesthetic dimension in military culture itself. For centuries, strategists from Sun Tzu to Niccolò Machiavelli to Carl von Clausewitz have theorized about the “art of war,” but art historians generally do not regard such discourse to be within their purview. This disciplinary exclusion merits reconsideration given the many conceptual and cultural intersections between art and war. Aesthetic ideas informed decisions of American military officers in designing armory displays and public perceptions of those displays.<sup>10</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Conversely, let us not forget that a defining characteristic of modernism was its strategic deployment of metaphors about art as a form of war—an idea broadly consonant with Clausewitz’s famous Napoleonic-era formulation of war as the extension of politics by other means. During the 1820s artists and cultural critics in France began to adapt the concept of an “avant-garde” from military discourse. That term, literally meaning “advance guard” or “vanguard,” for centuries referred to the foremost soldiers sent into battle before the main army. In the aftermath of the French Revolution and especially amid the fervor of European radicalism in the years around 1848, to be artistically “avant-garde” signified affiliation with a militantly progressive socialist agenda in politics. The locus classicus for such thinking is Henri de Saint-Simon’s treatise <italic>Opinions littéraires, philosophiques et industrielles</italic> (1825), in which three imaginary interlocutors—an artist, a scientist, and an industrialist—discuss the proper organization and governance of a progressive society. According to the artist, members of his profession should take a leading role because <disp-quote>
               <p>the arts persuade by touching men’s sensibilities. . . .</p>
               <p>We, the artists, will serve as the avant-garde: for amongst all the arms at our disposal, the power of the Arts is the swiftest and most expeditious. When we wish to spread new ideas amongst men, we use, in turn, the lyre, ode or song, story or novel; we inscribe those ideas on marble or canvas, and we popularize them in poetry and in song. We also make use of the stage, and it is there above all that our influence is most electric and triumphant. We aim for the heart and imagination, and hence our effect is the most vivid and the most decisive.<sup>11</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote> In this founding articulation of the cultural avant-garde, “the Arts” <italic>are</italic> “arms,” thanks to the speed with which they “spread new ideas.” Like many subsequent avant-gardists, Saint-Simon could not resist ballistic metaphor: “We aim for the heart and imagination.” That expression anticipated countless later modernist manifestoes and theorizations, such as Walter Benjamin’s important 1935 description of dada art as a “projectile” that “jolted the viewer” in order “to win back for the present day the tactical [<italic>taktisch</italic>] quality that is indispensable for art in the great periods of historical change.”<sup>12</sup>
         </p>
         <p>After the turn of the twentieth century, the idea of an artistic avant-garde gradually took hold in American modernist circles. Accordingly, organizers and supporters of the 1913 Armory Show saw themselves as veritable crusaders leading the charge in a battle for modern art in the United States, but their connection to European avant-garde ideas about sociopolitical revolt was tenuous—more smoke than fire. Hence Davies’s and Pach’s explicit disavowals of “propaganda” and “subversive” intent, noted above, along with Kuhn’s endorsement of “business.” Such attitudes have marked the American reception of modern art at least since the 1886 exhibition of French impressionism in New York, an event that Michael Leja has described as provoking few “political anxieties” despite its taking place amid some of the most violent urban labor conflicts in U.S. history. This apolitical tendency helps explain why the term “avant-garde” appeared rarely in the United States before the 1920s, and even then it often lacked the leftist edge of European expressions like those of Saint-Simon and Benjamin. The 1913 Armory Show thus typifies an American formulation of the avant-garde, in which aesthetic novelty and commerce took precedence over social change.<sup>13</sup>
         </p>
         <p>As a way of fleshing out the material and ideological complexities of that formulation, I want to recover a forgotten sense of the armory-ness of “the” Armory Show, glimpses of which appear in photographs taken during the exhibition and remain visible in the building today (still the active headquarters of the 69th Regiment). Not simply an inert architectural backdrop, the 69th Regiment Armory constituted a large and powerful thing, one that deserves more critical attention. The armory asserted itself by coming alive in the imagination of exhibition organizers and contemporary critics, for whom it spoke forcefully. Responding to the building’s military and cultural associations, critics and organizers branded the event as a belligerent new American “revolution” while also promoting it like a trade show of artistic innovation. Most agreed on one thing: the show’s savvy commercial success as a pseudomilitary spectacle elided radical politics. A key player here was the armory building itself. The present essay seeks to reanimate that building, along with the preceding tradition of “armory shows,” not to rehabilitate some lost utopian radicalism but to understand more fully the politically ambiguous and commercially expedient nature of the 1913 exhibition.<sup>14</sup>

         <title>An Imposing Spectacle</title>
         <p>Let us now turn to the rise of the armory as a tourist attraction and spectacular site of public display. One of the grandest American military-aesthetic spectacles of the nineteenth century awaited visitors at the Springfield Armory, a federal facility located on the Connecticut River in west-central Massachusetts. For nearly two centuries beginning in 1794, the armory at Springfield served as the nation’s biggest gun factory, until operations there ended in 1968. An anonymous antebellum print provides a bird’s-eye view of the armory complex, looking east from the river and the town (fig. 6). At the center appears the armory’s large Main Arsenal, built between 1847 and 1851 to store three hundred thousand finished muskets. Flanking that edifice we see rows of auxiliary buildings for manufacturing, administration, housing, and additional gun storage—enough for as many as two hundred thousand more muskets. Most of the complex today houses a community college, but the Main Arsenal functions as a National Park Service historic site and museum containing one of the largest collections of antique firearms in the world.<sup>15</sup>

         <p>In its heyday, the Springfield Armory was more than just a factory and storage depot. Because the buildings and grounds were open to the public, the facility attracted the attention of visitors interested in witnessing proof of America’s military and industrial strength. Especially with the advent of railroad service to Springfield in 1839, a steady stream of tourists made the town and its armory important stops on the region’s burgeoning travel circuit, which included other places along the Connecticut River such as Mount Holyoke and Northampton, Massachusetts. Visitors to the armory could observe the manufacturing process as well as the finished product: thousands of gleaming, uniform Springfield muskets neatly displayed in racks, ready for wartime distribution to garrisons around the country. For many tourists, this display was the highlight of their visit.<sup>16</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Already by the late 1820s, before the arrival of the railroad and construction of the Main Arsenal, nearly one hundred thousand muskets were on public view at the armory in the older Middle Arsenal (the largest of the flanking buildings at right in fig. 6). According to a traveler’s account published in 1826, <disp-quote>
               <p>we proceeded to the Armory, which is the principal one in the United States. Its location is remarkably pleasant, on an elevated and level plain about half a mile East of the village [of Springfield]. From this spot the view of the river, town and surrounding country is extremely beautiful. . . . In the stores attached to the Armory, are deposited upwards of 100,000 stand of arms, ready for service. 270 workmen are here employed, who finish about 15,000 muskets annually. The order and cleanliness displayed in every part of this establishment are truly admirable.</p>
            </disp-quote> By the eve of the Civil War, the armory employed many more workers and displayed as many as a quarter million muskets in its arsenal.<sup>17</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Strangely, no nineteenth-century photographs of the arsenal gun exhibits have been found, but the National Park Service museum retains one surviving display rack from the period containing about a thousand antique Springfield muskets (fig. 7). With wooden frames painted to resemble gold, the rack creates a powerful impression of order, magnitude, and even majesty—especially when we imagine dozens of such racks in a single room, holding tens of thousands of weapons for nineteenth-century visitors to see. As another tourist-correspondent reported in 1835, using words that would become a common refrain, “The muskets are arranged upon what are called ‘racks,’ and make a beautiful display.”<sup>18</sup> An 1837 visitor observed, <disp-quote>
               <p>the most interesting spectacle is the Arsenal, where the guns are stored after they are finished. The building is three stories high, and perhaps 70 or 80 feet long. (We merely <italic>guess</italic> at the length.) Each story is undivided, and the upper two, save a passage three or four feet wide all around, are completely filled with glittering muskets, bayonets reversed. They are placed in an erect position, compact, though not so much so as to interfere, and in two tiers, one above another. Each of these rooms contains 30,000 muskets. The whole scene appears more beautiful than warlike, and it hardly seems possible that an exhibition, which fills the mind with such pleasurable emotions, can be made up of the instruments of death.<sup>19</sup>

         <p>Such affirmative responses to the armory “exhibition” fulfilled the logistic and artistic vision of Major William Wade, an army ordnance officer and engineer stationed in Washington, D.C. In 1830 Wade had designed a new double-rack system for displaying muskets at Springfield and various related architectural details in the armory’s Middle Arsenal building. Writing that year to armory superintendent Colonel Roswell Lee, Wade proudly explained his designs for the arsenal building and gun display in terms of practicality and aesthetics: <disp-quote>
               <p>The general arrangement of the interior pleases me much. It is something new, and I think well adapted to its destined purpose. The spectacle of a room containing twenty thousand arms, so arranged that every one would be visible; that any one could be taken hold of, examined, and replaced; at pleasure; with abundance of light, and of space for passages; the absence of any visible means by which they, or the floor above, are supported; the order, simplicity, neatness, and magnitude of the whole; would together, form a scene worth a journey of some miles to enjoy.<sup>20</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote> In that statement, Major Wade conceived one of the most popular tourist attractions along the Connecticut River valley—a military-aesthetic “spectacle” appealing to many travelers. A subsequent letter from Wade to Lee, discussing details about frames and passageways through the gun display, confirms the importance of visual “appearance,” “imagination,” and “taste” in such military matters: <disp-quote>
               <p>The corner frames are designed not only for receiving the add[itional] thousand muskets, but for improving the appearance of the room by covering the ends of the long side passages with guns, instead of leaving a naked wall exposed. I think the effect on a beholder would be greatly increased, by terminating the view from these long passages with a mass of guns. It would give the imagination an impression of greater extent and magnitude than if the view were cut off by a naked blank wall. To effect this fully, the guns in one row should cover the intervals in the other, so that the walls behind them should not be visible from the passage. . . .</p>
               <p>The only objection I perceive from this modification is that the whole may appear too much crowded, and the passages be too narrow for good taste and effect.<sup>21</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Evidently Wade’s designs achieved the desired effect on beholders, judging from the many glowing descriptions of Springfield’s armory and gun display. A particularly vivid example appeared in an 1844 illustrated children’s story by Jacob Abbott about the happy adventures of a fictional boy-traveler named Marco Paul, who toured the armory’s arsenal with his older brother and a guide: <disp-quote>
               <p>They were both struck with astonishment at the imposing spectacle which was presented to their view. Except the necessary space for passages, the room was entirely filled with muskets. They were arranged, with the most perfect precision and symmetry, in an upright position, the butts resting in frames made for the purpose, and raised at a little distance from the floor. The tops of the bayonets reached nearly to the ceiling. The dark and glossy brown color of the stocks, with the highly polished lustre of the bayonets, and other metallic parts, gave to each individual gun a very beautiful appearance; but, in addition to this, there was a most surprising effect produced by the immense numbers and admirable arrangement of the whole. The rows of bayonets glittered in a long perspective. Even the locks, and the ramrods, and the sights upon the barrels, and, in fact, every single part of the gun, were presented to the eye, in long ranges, extending up and down the room.<sup>22</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>At Springfield, the art of war produced something like an aesthetic experience of the sublime, in which an “imposing spectacle” of guns glittered with a lively aura and formal splendor. One of the illustrations in Abbott’s book frames the armory display with curving foliage to emphasize its visual appeal (fig. 8). Enhancing that appeal with dramatic verbal description, the author’s vocabulary of “astonishment” and “immense numbers” even brings to mind specific passages in the writings of Edmund Burke and Immanuel Kant, whose respective theorizations of the sublime influenced many writers and artists of the period. Celina Fox, John F. Kasson, and other scholars have explored the wide aesthetic appeal of industrial machinery and mechanical products in different contexts during the nineteenth century, so such perceptions of guns should come as no surprise.<sup>23</sup>

         <p>To be sure, not all visitors to Springfield celebrated what they saw at the armory, but even a famous negative response conveyed its powerful visual impact. In 1843 the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow stopped there during a summer honeymoon trip through the Connecticut River valley with his bride, Fanny Appleton. At the urging of Fanny, an ardent pacifist, Henry composed an antiwar poem titled “The Arsenal at Springfield” (1844), comparing the gun display to “a huge organ” with “burnished arms” arrayed “from floor to ceiling.” The poem highlighted a somber contrast between the eerie silence of Springfield’s “organ” of muskets, with its “accursed instruments,” and the “discordant noises” of war that have disrupted nature’s “celestial harmonies” for centuries. “I hear even now the infinite fierce chorus,” Longfellow wrote <verse-group>
               <verse-line>The cries of agony, the endless groan,</verse-line>
               <verse-line>Which, through the ages that have gone before us,</verse-line>
               <verse-line>In long reverberations reach our own. . . .</verse-line>
               <verse-line>Were half the power, that fills the world with terror,</verse-line>
               <verse-line>Were half the wealth bestowed on camps and courts,</verse-line>
               <verse-line>Given to redeem the human mind from error,</verse-line>
               <verse-line>There were no need of arsenals or forts.</verse-line>
            </verse-group> Although Springfield’s guns came alive in Longfellow’s imagination, he recoiled in horror at the armory’s show of military force.<sup>24</sup>
         </p>
         <p>A chorus of competing voices drowned out the celebrity poet’s pacifist lament. In an era of ascendant manifest destiny, most visitors to Springfield championed the armory as a thing of beauty and national pride. Especially after construction of the Main Arsenal, newspapers and other publications regularly touted the federal facility as a tourist destination, often referring to the visual appeal of its weapons. For example, <italic>Harper’s New Monthly Magazine</italic> praised the “symmetry and splendor” of the gun display, with its “glittering bouquets” of “Uncle Sam’s amiable shooting-irons,” while the <italic>Albany Journal</italic> admired how these were “stacked in a most beautiful manner.” In broader terms, the <italic>Springfield Republican</italic> trumpeted the armory as “the resort of sightseers and travellers, and . . . one of the principal attractions of our beautiful locality; and at no public establishment in the United States can the eye be gratified with the sight of so much beautiful and ingenious machinery.”<sup>25</sup>
         </p>
         <p>As the latter comment suggests, the Springfield Armory garnered attention as a showcase of early modern industrial mechanization and mass production. A full-page 1861 illustration in <italic>Harper’s Weekly</italic> depicts laborers carrying out several of the many specialized tasks in “Manufacturing Muskets” (fig. 9). By mid-century Springfield manufactured more than twenty thousand muskets per year on average. Nearly four hundred separate tasks—each performed by a different worker using various tools and machines—went into producing the forty-nine distinct, standardized parts then constituting the weapon. To guarantee interchangeability of parts, officials subjected them to rigorous inspection using gauges before test-firing the musket. In the event of failure, officials traced the defective part to the responsible worker and docked his pay—for that part and all losses associated with the malfunction. Military authorities strictly regulated worker behavior and did not tolerate labor-management conflict arising from these exacting procedures.<sup>26</sup>

         <p>David Hounshell, Merritt Roe Smith, and other historians of industry have examined the technocratic regime at Springfield in detail, pointing out its important innovations and differences from later scientific management. For example, whereas nineteenth-century armory workers at Springfield needed to file and finish parts by hand to make them fit interchangeably, by 1925 Henry Ford could declare, “In mass production, there are no fitters.” Even so, during the antebellum period the armory helped establish high-precision interchangeability as an abstract ideal and plausible goal, wherein production units reflected a standard design template—a kind of modern Platonic industrial form. With its rigorous division of labor and other efficiencies, Springfield epitomized what was then known at home and abroad as the “American system” of manufacturing. As one indication of the armory’s international reputation, in 1854 the British Parliament sent representatives of a Select Committee to Springfield to study the system in preparation for overhauling English arms production.<sup>27</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Of all the nineteenth-century descriptions and depictions of Springfield, none provides greater insight into the armory’s cultural significance than an illustration by Charles Copeland in Moses King’s 1884 travel guide to the town, showing elegantly dressed tourists strolling inside the arsenal and admiring the gun display (fig. 10). In this scene, the American system culminated in a public spectacle consisting of thousands of weapons standing uniformly and quietly in racks like tin soldiers at attention. Although the gun display triumphantly symbolized American power, militarism interacted here with the arts of leisure. By emphasizing the beauty of the gun display as an object of touristic delight, the illustration also celebrated a product of industry while obscuring the labor that produced it. In this picture, as in the tourist experience itself, militarism and weapons of war became aesthetic abstractions.<fig id="fg10" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>Text inserted at the illustration’s upper right quotes Longfellow’s famous poem in a way that performed another powerful act of erasure. By excerpting only the first couplet—“This is the Arsenal. from floor to ceiling, / Like a huge organ, rise the burnished arms”—the illustration discreetly redacted the poem’s melancholy imagery and critical irony. Repurposed to exalt the armory’s guns as beautiful instruments of celestial harmony, Longfellow’s words have been turned on their head. Here the guns appear to rest in peace, unless provoked by America’s enemies. No hint of discord or pacifist objection intrudes on the scene of leisure. Analogously, we see no foremen using inspection gauges or otherwise regulating labor in the 1861 <italic>Harper’s</italic> illustration (see fig. 9); workers quietly carry out their compartmentalized tasks with diligent self-discipline, projecting a vision of stable consensus structured by the composition’s overall symmetry. Like most nineteenth-century images and descriptions of Springfield, these illustrations portrayed the armory as a marvel of industrial innovation, efficiency, and national power while banishing signs of internal conflict. Such imaginative acts of omission, eliding the darker realities of work and war, tell us much about the complex cultural life of the armory in America. They also foreshadow the emergence of the “armory show” as an apolitical public spectacle in the modern era, including the disavowals of “propaganda” and “subversive” intent by Davies and Pach in 1913.</p>
         <p>The various images and accounts of Springfield discussed here alert us to this armory’s exemplary status as a site of visual display, media coverage, and popular aesthetic experience. Visitors could observe the manufacturing process and the finished product as objects of beauty and technological wonder. In other words, the armory put on a pretty sensational show—one that mingled industrialism, nationalism, and the art of war. As if that were not enough, it hosted public events of various kinds, including Memorial Day and Fourth of July celebrations with fireworks and gun salutes, temporary exhibits of new machinery, and even an enormous National Horse Show in 1853. The armory also sent weapons for display to world’s fairs. In 1887, when the eminent sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens visited Springfield to determine a location for his bronze statue <italic>The Puritan</italic> (representing the town’s founder, Deacon Samuel Chapin), the New York art critic Mariana Van Rensselaer assumed the artist would set it up “in or near the Armory grounds.” The work ended up a few blocks away at Steams Square, but Van Rensselaer’s expectation confirms the armory’s national reputation as a site of public display and aesthetic viewing. Springfield thus helped to establish a model for perceiving armories in general as a building type known for a variety of exhibits.<sup>28</sup>

         <title>A Day at the Armory</title>
         <p>The historian Robert Fogelson has explored the boom in armory construction across the United States during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when state and local governments scrambled to create headquarters for militias whose service increasingly involved domestic peacekeeping and suppressing urban riots. “Starting in the 1830s,” says Fogelson, “they [militias] put down (or helped put down) bread riots, election-day riots, theater riots, gangland riots, and labor riots as well as anti-bank riots, anti-Catholic riots, anti-abolitionist riots, and, much the worst of all, anti-draft riots.” Major labor strikes in 1877, 1886, 1894, and the early 1900s led to accelerated armory construction, especially in cities. As symbols of law and order, these urban fortresses also regularly attracted attention as sites of tourism and aesthetic experience, not unlike the relatively rural Springfield Armory. More than mere inanimate structures, armories became agents of civic authority and public beauty.<sup>29</sup>
         </p>
         <p>An 1854 article in <italic>Gleason’s Pictorial Drawing-Room Companion</italic> raved about “The New Armory, Corner of White and Elm Streets, New York,” a neo-Gothic castle built in lower Manhattan at mid-century to house the First Division of the New York State Militia (fig. 11). Noting the armory could withstand riots, the article praised it further as “a beautiful and stately building . . . that adds another to the myriads of beautiful edifices that adorn the great metropolis.” Similar coverage in <italic>Gleason’s</italic> later that year greeted the opening of a “New State Arsenal,” located on Fifth Avenue between Sixty-Second and Sixty-Fourth Streets. (During the nineteenth century, “armory” and “arsenal” tended to function as synonyms in everyday language and the popular media.) An illustration provides a view inside the structure, showing a family of tourists entertaining themselves by talking with soldiers and handling a musket (fig. 12). Meanwhile, other visitors stroll about admiring a large display of firearms with patriotic decor, which the article praised for its “taste and neatness.”<sup>30</sup>

         <p>Still another piece in <italic>Gleason’s</italic> featured the U.S. Arsenal at Watertown, Massachusetts, outside Boston. Described as “a beautiful spot” with a “very fine general view,” the “armory . . . will delight the visitor by the neatness and order with which . . . the arms are kept” (note once again the popular conflation of “arsenal” and “armory”). Highlighting the “many delightful views about the grounds,” an illustration depicts gentlemen, ladies, and children as tourists sauntering past cannon balls stacked in perfect pyramids—a sort of Lilliputian Egypt surveyed by American gentry (fig. 13). Later, during the Civil War, Winslow Homer illustrated diligent male and female laborers making cartridges at this same facility for the readers of <italic>Harper’s Weekly</italic>, the nation’s “Journal of Civilization” (fig. 14). In war and peace, educated Americans saw armories as lively sites of authority, functionality, and beauty, where aesthetic criteria of “taste and neatness” in manufacturing and displaying weapons modeled an ideal social order.<sup>31</sup>

         <p>Although nineteenth-century accounts and illustrations envisioned no racial diversity in armory tourism, they showed white women enjoying some access as visitors and workers. Whereas Homer depicted female laborers at the Watertown Arsenal, women of leisure presumably were the target audience for an anonymous 1855 article titled “A Day at an Arsenal” in <italic>Godey’s Lady’s Book and Magazine</italic>, America’s leading fashion periodical at the time. Without identifying a specific manufacturing facility, the article provided a remarkably large amount of technical information about cannon forging and bullet making, activities presented as having great visual interest. Appealing to well-educated readers, the anonymous author invoked Greek mythology to dramatize the “beautiful sight” of “the mass taken at a white heat from the furnace, and laid on the anvil. The first blow scatters the glowing flakes of iron all around, shedding a lurid glare; it strongly reminds us of the scene presented to us of the Cyclops in the bowels of Mount Etna.”<sup>32</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Using the same literary allusions, nineteenth-century works of fine art occasionally addressed the modern armory as an industrial spectacle. The most prominent example, John Ferguson Weir’s large painting <italic>The Gun Foundry</italic> (fig. 15), tapped a Renaissance pictorial tradition of Vulcan and Cyclops crafting weapons at the forge. Contemporary critics cited these and other cultural associations in praising Weir’s picture enthusiastically when it appeared in major exhibitions in New York, Paris, and Philadelphia between 1866 and 1876. Writers noted the “weird grandeur of the scene,” in which the workers brought to mind “Cyclops at their toil.” An artist from a military family, Weir here addressed a subject of timely public and personal interest. <italic>The Gun Foundry</italic> specifically depicted laborers at the West Point Iron and Cannon Foundry in Cold Spring, New York, a private arms factory located near the artist’s family home, not far from the United States Military Academy. As noted by the art historian Betsy Fahlman, the foundry was a local landmark and tourist attraction that made cannons for the Union artillery during the Civil War. In addition to showing workers busily casting a modern Parrott rifled cannon, Weir represented at the far right a group of well-dressed visitors—ladies and gentlemen—observing the industrial scene. Among them appear the cannon’s inventor, Robert Parrott, and Weir’s patron, Gouverneur Kemble, the foundry’s first superintendent. Diverging somewhat from the aesthetics of neatness and order in popular imagery, this painting brought the armory to life as a dark, pulsating behemoth wrangled by swarthy laborers for the visual delight of elite tourists and art viewers. Echoing antebellum descriptions of Springfield, John F. Kasson says <italic>The Gun Foundry</italic> exemplifies the “technological sublime” and constitutes “the greatest American painting of an industrial scene in the nineteenth century.”<sup>33</sup>

         <p>Of all private armory owners, none had a greater flair for art and spectacle than Samuel Colt, the famous American inventor—or, rather, commodifier—of the revolver. An extraordinarily successful businessman based in Hartford, Connecticut, Colt has received much scholarly attention in recent years. Two major exhibitions at the Wadsworth Atheneum since 1996 have explored Colt’s design and marketing of firearms, his ambitious social aspirations, and his patronage of art. I will add little to this story, except to point out the important role Colt played in popularizing the perception of armories as visual attractions in their own right. This he did through relentless advertising of his company’s large factory, known as Colt’s Armory, one of the most recognizable industrial buildings of the nineteenth century. After operating smaller factories during the 1840s, Colt built a vast new armory complex in Hartford in 1855. A chromolithograph produced for the occasion celebrated the armory as a city landmark, at once dominating the landscape and picturesquely harmonizing with it (fig. 16).<sup>34</sup>

         <p>Designed by the architect Octavius Jordan, Colt’s armory towered over a 250-acre plot of land along the Connecticut River at the center of Hartford. Atop the rectilinear brick pile perched an exotic Russian-style onion dome crowned with the company trademark: a zinc-plated bronze statue of a rampant colt on a globe. Besides touting the building’s imperial scale and its owner’s ambition, these eccentric architectural details alluded to Colt’s recent entrée at the court of Czar Nicholas I. Surrounding the factory were numerous auxiliary structures—a machine shop, cartridge works, gasworks, waterworks, food warehouse, furniture shop, and worker housing, among other facilities—all visible from Colt’s lavish mansion, Armsmear. The entire Coltsville complex made him and Hartford famous, but the main armory building served as its centerpiece. According to a typical contemporary report, “The manufactory at Hartford is now one of the great wonders of American enterprise, and is visited by many strangers from abroad, as well as from our own country.” With the owner’s blessing, in 1857 <italic>United States Magazine</italic> published a long, promotional piece titled “A Day at the Armory of ‘Colt’s Patent Fire-Arms Manufacturing Company.’”<sup>35</sup>
         </p>
         <p>A pithier tourist account comes from Mark Twain, who visited Colt’s Armory in 1868, three years before moving to Hartford. Calling this “institution” the city’s “greatest,” he said it “comprises a great range of tall brick buildings, and on every floor is a dense wilderness of strange iron machines that stretches away into remote distances and confusing perspectives—a tangled forest of rods, bars, pulleys, wheels, and all the imaginable and unimaginable forms of mechanism.” Twain’s reference to a “great range” of buildings containing “remote distances” recalls earlier journalistic invocations of the sublime in describing the Springfield Armory. At the same time, his terms of bewilderment—”strange,” “confusing perspectives,” “tangled,” and “unimaginable forms”—uncannily foreshadowed later critical responses to the 1913 Armory Show in New York. Despite obvious differences in time and space, armories routinely confronted visitors with strikingly novel visual experiences.<sup>36</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Colt’s Armory penetrated international markets and minds with a number of dramatic public spectacles during the nineteenth century. For example, an eye-catching exhibition of Colt revolvers captured nearly as much attention at the 1851 Crystal Palace exhibition in London as Hiram Powers’s neoclassical sculpture <italic>The Greek Slave</italic>. Emboldened by that success, Colt opened another massive armory on the banks of the Thames River in 1853, attracting even more media coverage. After touring the new factory in 1854, Charles Dickens published the entry “Revolvers” in his weekly magazine <italic>Household Words</italic>. Ever attuned to strategies of visual presentation, Colt illustrated his London Armory on company stationery during these years. Pictured next to a Gothic church, the gargantuan modern factory appears on Colt’s letterhead fronting a large tract of Thames riverfront property and belching smoke as a tour boat approaches, the destination clearly indicated by the signature pistol emblazoned on both armory and vessel.<sup>37</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Samuel Colt died in 1862, but his corporate enterprise lived on. Nothing more powerfully demonstrated his armory’s enduring ability to blur the boundary between art and arms—or between living entities and nonliving things—than the Colt display at the 1876 Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia (fig. 17). Described by one journalist as a “fine exhibit,” it prompted another writer to remark on the “beautiful array of revolvers” with “a tastefulness and elegance that rival the manner in which much of the jewelry has been placed” at the fair. Crowned by the trademark rampant colt and encased in an architectural frame, the display stood in for the armory itself. Its abstract pinwheel pattern sublated the guns’ deadly function by imbuing them with paradoxical vitality even as their capacity to kill remained a paramount attraction. Intimating rotational movement, the display also metaphorically alluded to the famous revolving mechanism of Colt firearms. By extension, the exhibit linked Colt’s Armory to the idea of a second American “revolution” in industry—an apt connection for the centennial era. Above all, the display embodied a revolutionary interpenetration of two modern institutions: the armory and the trade show. Emergence of the “armory show” concept was only a matter of time.<sup>38</sup>

         <p>By the late nineteenth century, then, a tradition of associating armories with visual display and aesthetic experience had become well established in the United States. Through tourism, media, and public spectacles of various kinds, the art of war permeated cultural life for many Americans, habituating them to the idea of associating guns, the arms industry, and military facilities with beauty and entertainment. Perhaps the most rarefied expression of this phenomenon in New York during the Gilded Age was the Seventh Regiment Armory, designed by Charles Clinton and opened at 643 Park Avenue in 1879. Unlike most military armories, its construction depended on private funds raised by elite regimental members. In addition to a large drill hall that doubled as a public performance space (see fig. 4), the Seventh Regiment Armory had an art gallery and lavishly appointed club rooms with decorative details designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany, Stanford White, and Herter Brothers (fig. 18).<sup>39</sup>

         <p>Opened in 1906, the 69th Regiment Armory on Lexington Avenue amounted to something a bit less grand (see fig. 2). Built with public funds, it featured no Tiffany chandeliers or White furnishings. Nevertheless, the elite architectural firm of Hunt &amp; Hunt produced its design, indicating the political power and social prestige of the metropolitan militia. Trained at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris and tutored by their eminent father, Richard Morris Hunt, Richard Howland Hunt and Joseph Howland Hunt compiled an impressive portfolio of domestic buildings for the Vanderbilts, Pinchots, and other wealthy New York families before designing the 69th Regiment Armory. Such credentials suggest a conservative stylistic orientation, but critics praised their design for breaking new ground by eschewing the Gothic historicism dominating earlier buildings of this type (see fig. 11). According to Montgomery Schuyler, for example, this armory “is of an entirely different inspiration from . . . any of its predecessors. It seems even to be a protest and token of revolt against them.” Praising “the absence of the conventions of military architecture,” Schuyler went so far as to call it “a modern armory on modern lines.” Its “practical conception,” he said, “is with difficulty distinguishable from that of a railroad station, with its ‘head house,’ answering to the administration, and its ‘train shed’ answering to the drill room.” Indeed, the armory’s vast interior drill hall with steel vaulting (fig. 19) recalls the train shed of the Gare du Nord (opened 1846, expanded by the architect Jacques Ignace Hittorff, 1861–64) and other Paris railroad depots of the late nineteenth century.<sup>40</sup>

         <p>The 69th Regiment Armory’s exterior mansard roof placed the building within a particular “modern” architectural idiom known as the Second Empire style, previously evident in such other prominent American civic structures as Alfred Mullett’s State, War, and Navy Building (Eisenhower Executive Office Building) in Washington, D.C. (1871–78), and John McArthur Jr.’s Philadelphia City Hall (1871–1901). Although firmly established in the United States by the 1870s, the Second Empire style originated earlier in Paris during Baron Georges-Eugène Haussmann’s massive urban renewal project under Napoleon III (1853–70). Haussmann’s scheme forcefully eliminated medieval streets and neighborhoods in order to secure the free flow of traffic, trade, and troops in the French capital, facilitating the construction of grand new boulevards with spectacular vistas and expansive edifices, many with mansard roofs, as in Louis Visconti’s and Hector Lefuel’s additions to the Palais du Louvre (1852–57) and numerous buildings along the Champs-Élysées. At the École, the Hunt brothers thoroughly absorbed the sense of grandeur and authority emanating from such French imperial prototypes. In an apt American echo of Haussmannization, the city of New York approved demolition of dozens of mid nineteenth-century working-class tenements to make way for the 69th Regiment Armory.<sup>41</sup>
         </p>
         <p>If Hunt &amp; Hunt’s Second Empire design broke new ground stylistically in armory architecture, it hardly dispensed with military functionality or symbolism. Another contemporary critic lavishly praised the armory as “a building of extreme power and originality” in which “a distinctly military effect has been obtained in the cleverest possible way.” With its massive brick walls and heraldic spread-eagle keystone ornament over the entrance, the armory projected a formidable appearance (fig. 20). No detail bears witness to the building’s martial purpose more vividly than its projecting exterior eyries, or rifle bays, with narrow protective windows. Schuyler described these as “picturesque excrescences” but acknowledged that “a few guardsmen stationed in them might make themselves very annoying, by means of an enfilading fire, to a mob in the street below.” In another early article touting the building, Lieutenant-Colonel J. Hollis Wells of Clinton &amp; Russell, Architects observed that an armory “should be substantially built and . . . be so arranged as to be easily protected from the mob. There should be enfilading towers with narrow windows so arranged for rifle fire that streets at or near [the] exits may be cleared.”<sup>42</sup>

         <p>I have found no documentary evidence confirming that soldiers of the 69th Regiment ever used the armory’s rifle bays for that purpose, but the possibility was real enough to warrant their inclusion in the building’s design. Since the middle of the nineteenth century, state militia and National Guard regiments around the country were regularly called up to put down “the mob.” New York’s 69th Regiment was no exception. In addition to serving with distinction during the Civil War, the regiment had helped suppress New York’s Draft Riots (1863) and Quarantine Riots (1858 and 1892). Early in the twentieth century, newspapers frequently reported the mustering of state and federal troops to stop riots, strikes, and other disturbances in New York City. According to a 1911 article in the <italic>New York Times</italic>, <disp-quote>
               <p>the need of filling up our National Guard regiments to their full quota . . . is now one of the most important and pressing duties of the State Administration. . . .</p>
               <p>. . . [T]he services of disciplined troops in quelling riots which are beyond the control of local police are invaluable.<sup>43</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>The 69th Regiment Armory’s bellicose capacities and associations were ready-made for appropriation at the 1913 Armory Show. Critics and organizers alike referred to the building and the exhibition in quasi-military terms of violence, often in the same breath, indicating how the armory came alive as a metaphoric agent and framing device. As the critic Harriet Monroe observed, <disp-quote>
               <p>Asking nobody for money, depending on voluntary contributions, they hire an armory, partition it off into excellent burlap galleries, and fill it with over a thousand works of modern art from far and near. With little fuss or funds they throw a bomb into the entrenched camps.</p>
            </disp-quote> An anonymous reviewer in the <italic>Independent</italic> said, “The Sixty-ninth Regiment Armory in New York City is nowadays a battleground where every day from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. rages the eternal warfare between neophilism and neophobia.” An unnamed writer for the <italic>Evening Sun</italic> perceived a connection between “the futurism of the fighting suffragettes” and “the militant sculpture at the armory,” where “uncouth explosions of Archipankhurstism may in this spirit be accepted as a sign of better times to come.” In the <italic>Sunday Times</italic>, Alfred Stieglitz declared, “you’ll hear a battle cry of freedom” at the armory.<sup>44</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Such comments took part in a broader discourse of violence famously exemplified by Julian Street’s description of Duchamp’s <italic>Nude</italic> as resembling “the explosion of a shingle factory.” That discourse in turn resonated with contemporary fears about anarchist bombings and accidental factory explosions, which newspapers regularly reported at the time. In his well-known review of the 1913 New York exhibition, Theodore Roosevelt offered an international perspective that portrayed modernism as a kind of artistic arms race, praising the organizers for “showing to our people . . . the art forces which of late have been at work in Europe, forces which cannot be ignored.”<sup>45</sup>
         </p>
         <p>All of this verbal saber rattling played into the hands of the exhibition organizers and their close associates, who recycled a mélange of militant-sounding and pseudomilitary rhetoric ad nauseum. For example, Walt Kuhn’s letters referred exuberantly to the event as being “like a bombshell,” and how “the loyalty of the men” of his inner circle constituted “a solid phalanx.” Before the election of Arthur B. Davies as president of the AAPS, member Gutzon Borglum declared, “We will need to find a man that is willing to lead a fight.” In a special issue of <italic>Arts &amp; Decoration</italic> devoted to the exhibition, William Glackens praised Davies for insisting on “harmonious arrangement” and “order” as “the battlecry of the post-impressionists,” saying, with ballistic flourish, “He aims straighter, perhaps, than any other man here at beauty.” Referring to the exhibition itself, John Quinn wrote in the same issue, “Here will be examples of the work of men about whose names historic battles have been waged, names of men who came victoriously out of the fight, men of many aims, men of unequal accomplishment, men whose work may clash.” Jo Davidson added, “The virtue of the present revolution in art is that of all revolutions. The consequence of war is a new peace, which lasts for a while until another war is necessary. War is the only way to keep from stagnation and decay.”<sup>46</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Aside from recalling contemporary European manifestos, such comments gestured indirectly to the Saint-Simonian origins of the avant-garde. Yet, they also clearly responded to the 69th Regiment Armory itself in a site-specific way, revealing its power as an agent provocateur. The European modernist events that had inspired Davies and Pach to stage the 1913 New York spectacle—Roger Fry’s 1910 and 1912 postimpressionism shows at the Grafton Galleries in London and the 1912 Sonderbund exhibition at the Kunsthalle in Cologne—were not held in armories. Viewers certainly perceived those unprecedented European displays of work by Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Pablo Picasso, and the German Expressionists as strikingly avant-garde, but the 69th Regiment Armory palpably enhanced the aesthetic impact and spectacular effect of such art in New York.<sup>47</sup>
         </p>
         <p>More than any other writings at the time, Kuhn’s epitomize the militarized discourse swirling around the 69th Regiment Armory in 1913. In December 1912, Kuhn told his wife, Vera, “We have adopted an emblem—Taken from the old pine tree flag of the [American] revolution—I got the idea one morning in bed.” Ruminating on this idea in another letter, he said, “Davies agrees with me that America is the new soil and that the game is most interesting at home. Paris is a hot-house where they raise beautiful orchids and other wondrous plants, but the rugged old pine grows best in arid climes. Davies in all his delicacy is always masculine.” The Pine Tree, or Liberty Tree, flag was associated with the Sons of Liberty in Boston as well as with the Continental Navy during the War of Independence. With these gendered historical-environmental associations in mind, Kuhn and his loyal male “phalanx” used money donated by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney to purchase pine trees and evergreen branches as decoration for the interior of their exhibition space, the armory’s large military drill hall (see frontispiece). They also produced promotional “campaign buttons” with the Pine Tree flag emblem to signify the “New Spirit” of modern art (fig. 21).<sup>48</sup>

         <p>In contrast to those manifestations of martial spirit, a more cordial tone informed correspondence between the exhibition organizers and regimental commander Colonel Louis Conley regarding the lease of the armory. Most of the letters in question contain practical information about rental terms, but a few statements in them provide illuminating evidence of cooperation and mutual admiration. For example, Conley observed, “In making this [lease] proposal, I have taken into consideration, the desirable character of the purpose for which the premises would be used, and this special price is made in further consideration of the prestige that would accrue to the organization therefrom.” In other letters, the colonel requested from and thanked Kuhn for invitations to the exhibition opening as well as for complimentary admission tickets to “the show” to be distributed among officers of the regiment. Writing to the colonel shortly after the exhibition’s New York run, Kuhn addressed a letter to Conley “My Dear Colonel” and closed it, “Yours with agreeable memory of our association, social and otherwise, Yours faithfully.” Kuhn’s circle of comrades seems to have included the colonel himself. As partners in a business transaction, though, they communicated in a purely professional tone, with no pugnacious histrionics.<sup>49</sup>
         </p>
         <p>In his 1938 <italic>Story of the Armory Show</italic>, Kuhn recalled additional details and incidents that indicate how a mixture of managerial and pseudomilitary postures governed the event. Discussing the venue selection, he wrote, <disp-quote>
               <p>the old Madison Square Garden was discarded as prohibitive in size and cost. All other places seemed too small or otherwise unattractive. Some of the members mentioned casually about the possible availability of an armory, several of which permitted tennis playing for a fee. With this hint I visited several armories, talked to their respective colonels and finally found after a conversation with Colonel Conley, then commanding officer of the old 69th Regiment, N.G.N.Y (The Irish Regiment), now the 165th Regiment Infantry, that his armory, Lexington Avenue at 25th Street, would possibly lend itself to our purpose.</p>
            </disp-quote> Independent news reports confirm that regimental commanders encouraged civilian use of the armory for tennis competitions, boxing matches, and other events. As we have seen, one of the building’s inaugural spectacles in 1906 was an “armory show” of automobiles and airplanes.<sup>50</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Elsewhere in his 1938 account, Kuhn referred to the 1913 exhibition as an “exciting adventure” and “most effective revolt.” Underscoring the show’s theme of war and revolution, Kuhn riddled his description with references to “enemies” and allies taking “sides” in the “fight” “for or against” modern art. As official secretary of the AAPS, Kuhn even dubbed himself “war secretary.” His story concluded with an anecdote confirming the armory’s centrality as a source of metaphoric inspiration along these lines. Casting the exhibition as a veritable gallery of war heroes in the historic contest of modernism, Kuhn wrote, “On the show’s last night at the Armory, we paraded with regimental fife and drum. . . . Through each room of the exhibition we marched and saluted our confreres past and present.” Finally, after the show was dismantled, “the regimental band marched on to the empty floor and saluted our closing with the tune of ‘Garry Owen,’” a famous Irish battle hymn long associated with the 69th and Seventh Regiments. For better or worse, no pictures survive that document these closing ceremonies on the armory’s drill floor, where artists and soldiers collaborated in mock military solidarity.<sup>51</sup>

         <p>Viewed critically, the belligerent rhetoric and postures surrounding the 1913 Armory Show complicate the organizers’ heroic claims about “revolt.” Embracing militarism as a public spectacle, their theatrical antics extended an ongoing tradition of armory displays and trade shows, which had appealed to American tourists and consumers for decades. Whatever revolt occurred, it entailed considerable continuity with the nineteenth century. More complications arise when we remember that armories like that of the 69th Regiment were conceived as bulwarks against urban riots, labor strikes, and other domestic insurrections well into the twentieth century. Even as the armory hosted a “New Spirit” in art, its troops and rifle bays stood ready to <italic>suppress</italic> radical revolt by putting down uprisings in the streets of New York.</p>
         <p>Countless references to the show as a commercial attraction further attenuated the event’s revolutionary character, making it even more consistent with the preceding tradition of armory spectacles that I have been describing. As a <italic>Philadelphia Inquirer</italic> critic noted, “The business of the show has been splendidly and thriftily managed.” The critic marveled at the distribution of promotional postcards as “a clever and profitable way of advertising the exhibition,” while saying, “The armory itself is a charming place for an exhibition and has been very tastefully arranged and decorated.” The latter description could have been written for an antebellum travel account of the Springfield Armory.<sup>52</sup>

         <p>A reviewer in the <italic>New York Globe</italic> observed, <disp-quote>
               <p>Literally thousands of people throng the place daily and the scene in the matter of attendance is like some great fair. Uniformed attendants outside, with the name “International Exhibition” in gold on their caps, megaphone for automobiles, throngs of which line the streets on three sides of the enormous building. Inside innumerable employees look after hats and canes, catalogues and photographs, while salesmen with badges announcing their vocation are everywhere.</p>
            </disp-quote> A glimpse of those “throngs” of automobiles can be seen in a 1913 photograph, showing cars lined up in front of the armory on Lexington Avenue in a repetitive array that roughly echoes the row of projecting rifle bays on the building’s facade above (see fig. 1). Befitting such an event, the Society section of <italic>Town and Country</italic> barely distinguished between the modern art exhibition and a nearby trade show, saying, “Motor-cars were speeding down Fifth Avenue last week-end, some turning toward the 69th Regiment Armory, where the Futurists are the attractions, and others to Madison Square Garden, where the motor boat show was in session.” As if to confirm this trade-show connection, Kuhn observed in his 1938 <italic>Story</italic> that the Armory Show provided an opportunity for European and American artists to “show their wares.” Noting how “Business” and “Industry” particularly “took notice” of the show because it provided models of “merchandise” and “decoration,” Kuhn triumphantly declared the exhibition’s historical significance by quoting President Coolidge’s dictum, “America’s business is business.”<sup>53</sup>

         <p>An anonymous critic writing in <italic>Vogue</italic> incisively summed up the exhibition’s commercial implications with this statement in 1913: <disp-quote>
               <p>It will be seen at the International Exhibition of Modern Art, held in the Sixty-ninth Regiment Armory, that the few Americans who have clambered aboard the very adventurous ship of the Post-Impressionists have merely consented, like true soldiers of fortune, to wear the same uniform and fight the same battle without really being imbued with the original spirit of the undertaking.<sup>54</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote> In other words, <italic>Vogue</italic>’s reviewer sensed a mercenary aspect governing the proceedings, where American “soldiers of fortune” adopted military postures as an aesthetic costume for commercial purposes without retaining the “original spirit” of European modernism. Far from espousing the avant-garde’s founding Saint-Simonian vision of socialist engagement, the 1913 Armory Show in New York produced something that was politically rather more amorphous. Like the armory building itself, the exhibition spoke with a forked tongue, catering to concerns at once military and civilian, aesthetic and commercial. Addressing those varied concerns, the 69th Regiment Armory materially structured the event for organizers and visitors alike as a lively, if politically vague, public spectacle—one deeply rooted in American history.</p>
