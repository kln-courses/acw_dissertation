<plain_text><page sequence="1">25O RELIGIOUS STUDIES Marcel Sarot. God, Passibility and Corporeality Pp. xii + 280. (Kampen: Kok Pharos, 1992.) This book is a further example of the flourishing of the 'Utrecht school' of philosophical theology. Working with a ' personalist ' concept of God of the kind used by his colleagues, Marcel Sarot argues that there are overriding reasons for attributing passibility to God, and that doing so requires that we think of God as embodied. The argument begins with a review of the case for ?mpassibilism. Here Sarot considers the claims that a passible agent cannot be fully rational, cannot be unconditioned, and cannot enjoy perfect bliss. Rather than merely dismissing these objections outright, he tries to construct a form of passibilism that can accommodate them. This qualified passibilism holds for instance that God is indeed free from causal determination, and so self-existent, but not free from the influence of his creatures, so that He is not self-sufficient. Having blunted the case for impassibilism, the next task of the book is to argue constructively on behalf of passibilism. Sarot argues that God's power to console, the perfection of His love, and the sufferings of Jesus all provide powerful reasons for endorsing passibilism. For example, it is argued that a God who is not merely benevolent but capable of a ' relation of mutual fellowship' is best able to fulfil the desires of His creatures (p. 90). The remainder of the book explores the implications of the passibilist doctrine with particular reference to the question of divine corporeality. Here it is argued that if we are to attribute to God intense emotions of the kind that are required given the earlier discussion, then indeed we should think of Him as embodied. The feasibility of this implication is assessed with reference to recent work on the idea of divine corporeality. Sarot concludes that, with certain modifications, the model of divine corporeality proposed by Grace Jantzen provides for the kind of passibilism envisaged in the first part of the book. This is an impressive work, which is well organized, closely argued, and conversant with a very broad range of literature. Anyone wishing to address these themes hereafter will need to be familiar with this book. But, as is the way with philosophy, there is sure to be dissent. Some will take issue with the notion that God is best understood as 'a person'. Thus the arguments Sarot presents against, for instance, Brian Davies, although effective in their own terms, do not get to the bottom of the disagreement between them. This disagreement is ultimately a matter of religious sensibility and to that extent will remain unresolved even if Sarot should establish that being self-existent is consistent with being in a relation of mutual fellowship. It follows that where the argument of the book rests upon appeal to the character of inter-personal relations, it runs the risk of merely begging the question against impassibilists of Davies's persuasion. In</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 25I fairness to Sarot, the opportunity to settle such differences by argument may indeed be limited. However, one argument for (something like) Davies's view is implicit in a passage from Hartshorne which Sarot himself cites: 'the human being must be incomprehensible to the cell to such an extent as to constitute merely a sort of environment, not a definite term of a social relation' (p. 214). But suppose we do adopt a personalist conception of God. Should we infer, with Sarot, that such a God will experience violent emotions? Even granting the personalist model, some will flinch at the anthropomorphism in the idea that if God's love is to be perfect, 'He must really be emotionally upset' (p. 157). This claim is defended partly on the grounds that in cases of severe suffering, God can best console us if He Himself suffers acutely (e.g. p. 80). But if a certain incident is to cause someone to suffer acutely, it seems that his attention should largely be focused upon this event. At any rate, if his attention is also open to further things which are no source of distress, then his suffering will be tempered accordingly. But in that case, we may wonder whether it makes sense to suppose that God might suffer acutely out of sympathy for my misfortune. The scope of the divine attention is so much greater than that of creatures that such a response might seem to be inevitably disproportionate. But suppose we grant both Sarot's personalist model and the claim about extremes of emotion. In that case, does his argument for corporeality hold? Sarot's case at this point does not depend upon a general argument against the possibility of non-embodied mentality, but turns upon the experience of intense emotions in particular. But if we may grant the possibility of a non embodied agent's thinking of prime numbers, some may wonder why we should not also grant the possibility of such an agent experiencing mental distress. It may be, as Sarot proposes, that we cannot conceive of a pain which is felt nowhere. But it is not so clear that sorrow (or any of its components) need be felt anywhere, even when it is profound; and such a state may be enough to persuade us of the depth of God's identification with our suffering. At any rate, some will prefer some notion of this kind to the idea that there are places (where seems not to matter) where God feels twinges and even ravaging pain. Finally, we may ask: even granting that the personalist model is appro? priate, and that God experiences extremes of emotion, and that these experi? ences are located, does it follow that God is embodied ? Some may question this inference. For instance, it may be said : if God is free to suspend the laws of nature, as most theists suppose, then the world does not set constraints to His activity; it follows that His relation to the world is very different from our relation to our bodies ; and this is a reason for supposing that the world is not His body strictly speaking. (Contrast Sarot's treatment of this question on p. 241.) However, since the author holds that all language is metaphorical</page><page sequence="3">252 RELIGIOUS STUDIES in some degree (pp. 133L) he may not be too perturbed by the suggestion that such points of disanalogy imply that the notion of divine embodiment is 'merely' metaphorical. In the space of a short review, it is not possible to do justice to the richness of Sarot's argument. This book succeeds in its central aim of making us think hard about our conceptual options in this area; it will reward first hand study. Mark Wynn Australian Catholic University</page></plain_text>
