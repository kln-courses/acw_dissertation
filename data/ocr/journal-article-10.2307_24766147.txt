In such a framework, an increasingly complex social structure, arising in response to the increasingly complex relations of agricultural production, is presumed. For example, some researchers would argue that feasting-based rituals became an arena of social control and an increasingly complex society began to emerge around ritual leadership and monumental ritual archi tecture. Yet the research projects conducted at many Near Eastern sites indicate neither that sedentism can be directly linked to the requirements of agriculture, nor that the presence of monumental architecture can be successfully associated with social control based on unequal redistribution of agricultural surplus. While ritual activity appears to be central during the Neolithic, two important questions remain to be explored: (1) what exactly did the rituals control, given that the societies under consideration are commonly perceived to have an 'egalitarian' ethos?; and (2) what happened to the ritual control in the second half of the PPNB, when ritual architecture completely disappears from the archaeological record at a time of increased reliance on agriculture? Through a critical review of the use of terms like 'sedentism', 'egalitarianism' and 'ritual', I argue that the architecture of the Early Neolithic is related to the management of social relationships through symbolic place-making activities. Based on a comparative review of burial activity, building con tinuity and the use of symbolic imagery, I examine the symbolic construction of some of the earliest examples of long-term occupational focus in southeast Anatolia, such as Hallan Çemi, Demirköy, Körtik Tepe, Hasankeyf Höyük, Gusir Höyiik, Göbekli Tepe, Çayônii and Nevali Çori, in an attempt to understand the social factors behind the emergence and demise of Early Neolithic monumental architecture. The evidence from the above-men tioned sites suggests that Early Neolithic place-making reflects community formation at a variety of scales, at the center of which lay the continuous reinvention of kinship concepts. While some sites, with concentrations of burials, may have become the locus for Ç.

Arguably, the formation of large scale networks during the PPNA posed a threat to local groups. Thus, a focus on local group formation and close control of social exchanges may have begun during the early PPNB, and the places such as Göbekli Tepe may have fallen out of use during this process. In the context of the symbolism and figurine evidence, I further argue that sex and gender may have become important issues, both in the formation of place-communities during the late PPNA—early PPNB, and in the emergence of autonomous households during the later PPNB. Keywords Neolithic ■ Ritual • Gender Introduction In very broad terms, the gradual adoption of sedentary lifestyles together with plant and animal domestication by formerly mobile hunter-gatherer communities is referred to as the Neolithic Process. The fact that the emergence of domestication has gone hand in hand with increasing sedentism at a number of locations across the globe has served to highlight the broad climatic causes of this major transformation, which in turn has constructed this research field as a quest for the origins of agriculture. Ideas about the origins of agriculture are commonly categorized as either 'push' or 'pull' models (Stark 1986), in other words, hunter-gatherers are either forced to become farmers by climatic changes and population pressure (Binford 1968; Flannery 1969; Cohen 1977; Moore 1989), or they are drawn by the economic benefits of agriculture and the desire to reduce risk or increase wealth (Flannery 1986; Henry 1989). While it is remarkable that domestication of plants and animals has occurred inde pendently in a number of areas of the world at roughly the same time, we also understand that the ecological and social contexts may vary greatly in respect of a number of inde pendent variables, for example, the availability of proto-domesticates, population densities, resource abundance, processing and harvesting technology, storage and sedentary prac tices, and social structures (see also Kelly 1995). Current evidence for the Near East indicates that, in the aftermath of the last Ice Age, relatively more abundant ecological niches along the Fertile Crescent allowed some groups to intensively employ broad spectrum subsistence strategies which resulted in long term occupational focus in multiple locations (Zeder 2009, 2012; Aiello 2011 ; Fuller et al. 2011). The Early Natufian, a society of complex hunter-gatherers that began to experiment with more sedentary lifestyles during the favorable environmental conditions of the Bolling-Allerod climatic episode (c. 12500-10800 cal BC) in the Levant, is regarded as the prime case of incipient sedentism, food production and social hierarchy. However, this first stride is also under stood to be short lived due to the onset of the colder and drier conditions of the Younger Dryas (c. 10800-9500 BC), which initially resulted in a return to mobile conditions, but in the long term provided a push toward the adoption of plant cultivation and domestication. Due to the absence of ceramic ware throughout the early stages of the Neolithic Process, the period under examination here will be referred to as the Pre-Pottery Neolithic or the Early Neolithic and will be explored in two main chronological phases: the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA: approximately 10000-8500 cal BC) and the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B Ö Springer</page><page sequence="3">J World Prehist (2014) 27:1^42 (PPNB: approximately 8500-7000 cal BC). In the southeast Anatolian context, the term PPNC has proved useful for defining continuous sequences that link PPNB to the Pottery Neolithic at sites such as Çayônû; in this paper PPNC is considered within the time span of the later PPNB. Within this general chronological scheme, the PPNA in the Near East is characterized by elementary forms of sedentary life, with the first domesticated grasses appearing during its final stages. Recent studies indicate that this was a time period when comparable lifestyles and a package of proto-domesticates began to occur at various Near Eastern locations, including Cyprus, which was apparently colonized by communities that sailed from the Eastern Mediterranean coast by the Later PPNA (Peltenburg and Wasse 2004; Simmons 2007). The subsequent PPNB period saw the development of much larger communities, ritual intensification, and increased reliance on domesticated legumes and herd animals. However, throughout the PPNA and for most of the PPNB, a hunter-gatherer mode of subsistence continued to be a central feature of social and economic life; the final emergence of a complete self-sustaining agricultural package, and a landscape remodeled to produce a distributed settlement pattern more in tune with such an economy, only begin to be seen at the end of the PPNB. Within this context, it can be seen that adaptive strategies and socioeconomic systems varied greatly through space and time, and even geographically close communities dis played divergent traditions of subsistence, symbolism, material culture and the manipu lation of social space. Therefore, the relationship between 'sedentism', predominantly in the hunter-gatherer mode, and the emergence of sedentary lifestyles that depended on domesticates remains problematic. For example, the late Epipaleolithic hunter-gatherers of southeast Anatolia also became increasingly sedentary during the tenth millennium BC, as the evidence from Hallan Çemi, Körtik Tepe or Hasan Keyf Höyiik would indicate (Fig. 1), without, however, allowing us to see a common factor in responses to climatic factors. First of all, the new evidence from Körtik Tepe would indicate that the site was probably in use throughout the Younger Dryas (Co§kun et al. 2012). Secondly, at these sites, there is a scarcity of cereals and a predominance of almond, pistachio and other nut species, berries, and lentil (Miyake et al. 2012; Savard et al. 2006; Riehl et al. 2012).

A focus on wild species of sheep, goat, boar, deer and some gazelle may be common among the animal remains, along with small animals such as foxes, tortoises, fish and hares (Arbuckfe and Özkaya 2006). This picture is very different from that presented by the first sedentary communities of the Middle Euphrates, such as Abu Hureyra, where pre-domestication cultivation of large seeded grasses is evident in the PPNA (Willcox et al. 2008). Discoveries of monumental scale buildings at the southeast Anatolian sites of Göbekli Tepe, Nevah Çori, and the closely associated Upper Euphrates sites of Jerf el-Ahmar, D'jade and Tel Abr have ushered in a new era of research over the last couple of decades (Hauptmann 1999; Schmidt 2000; Stordeur et al. 2000; Yartah 2005); this will be explored in more detail in the following sections of this study. In fact, the existence of special buildings has been a subject of debate since excavations at sites such as Çayônii (Özdogan and Özdogan 1989, 1998), Jericho (Kenyon 1960) and Qermez Dere (Watkins 1990) revealed buildings with symbolically elaborate architecture. In Jericho, the close rela tionship of burial and monumental architecture may be interpreted as an early signal of ritual leadership that later primarily focused on manipulation of burial customs in increasingly populated PPNB sites (see Byrd 2005; Kuijt and Goring-Morris 2002). Although the communities of Upper Mesopotamia were small in comparison to some of their Levantine counterparts, monumental building activity is the hallmark of this region and has also been considered to highlight the centrality of ritual control before the spread of sedentism in the region (Verhoeven 2002a, b; Schmidt 2010). Yet, from a different angle, the societies under consideration are often defined as 'egalitarian', both in the Levant and in southeastern Anatolia, because of the absence of significant differences in either dwelling size or the distribution of material wealth and burials among households (Wright 2014; Kuijt 2002, 2008b; Byrd 1994; Rollefson 2000). Even more paradoxically, the special buildings disappear from the archaeological record by the end of the PPNB, at a time when sedentary communities, which are in a better position to produce agricultural surplus and thus facilitate aggrandizement through the construction of monumental buildings, began to spread throughout the region. Within this context, we have no convincing evidence that a complex political structure with centralized control of economic and ritual practice ever developed at any point in the Early Neolithic or, for that matter, the later Ceramic Neolithic. Construction of buildings with monumental features is not unknown in the ethnog raphies of present-day hunter-gatherers, and some researchers explain such monumental building activity in terms of emergent ritual leadership. For example, Hayden (1990, 2009) argues that territorial or sedentary hunter-gatherers can be highly susceptible to resource fluctuations that occur as a result of ecological change or communal conflict. Therefore, they rely on networks of cooperation in times of social or environmental stress. In these groups, the most efficient way to form an alliance would be through the sharing of food, which can be an integral part of many social events, including celebrations and ceremonies (Owens and Hayden 1997). As highly organized forms of food sharing, feasts hold a special place in the construction of social alliances. A large scale feast is a competitive event that advertises the power and prestige of aggrandizing families by displaying their capacity to produce large food surpluses and their access to exchange items and prestige foods. In more affluent areas, the demonstration of resource and labor control may cul minate in the construction of monumental structures that require the labor participation of large numbers of people. The organization of such large-scale events requires control of labor, which in turn requires leadership roles (Arnold 1993, 1996; Bender 1978; Ô Springer</page><page sequence="5">J World Prehist (2014) 27:1-42 Aldendenfer 1993). At these events military allies as well as exchange partners may be attracted to individuals or families who signal greater prestige. As social networks and alliances grow, so does success in defending self and family interests in political and economic struggles. Thus, through feasts and concomitant building activities, less suc cessful groups may enter into social networks of exchange and participate in ceremonies in order to increase their own competitive power and prestige. It is through such competition for prestige that domestication may have developed, since feasts required large quantities of easily accessible food (Hayden 1990). Mark Aldendenfer (1993) also argues that the existence of symbolic control depends upon the degree of its social acceptance which, to be effective, must be imposed in contexts that generate recognized and binding obligations or other practical benefits, such as feasts. According to this perspective, the control of ceremonial and symbolic activity within a descent group is a fundamental pathway to the extension of organizational leadership roles; elders within kinship lineages are often considered the obvious sources of such leadership. In practice, males with more wives tend to occupy higher positions within hierarchies, because they are able to guarantee the continuation of their influence through the establishment of larger kinship groups, and thereby gain access to a greater share of the means of production through inheritance of lands or herds. Yet other researchers would argue that symbolic strategies emerge and disappear throughout the history of our species, but do not always produce 'aggrandizing' leaders; giving wealth away does not necessarily result in increased power for the giver (Gamble 1998, 2008). Ingold (1999) provides a different frame for approaching human sociality and power relations. He argues that, depending on the social construction of the person and his/her relation to the communal, social units may emphasize either adhesion or coalescence. In this sense, adhesion may refer to cases where the boundaries between the community and the person are relatively distinct; whereas coalescence may refer to cases where the boundaries between the person and the community are blurred in favor of the communal (see also Fowler 2004, for a discussion on the archaeology of personhood). Within this context, the hunter-gatherer band may be characterized as a social environment which specifically emphasizes coalescence, whereby equality is deliberately asserted through such strategies as 'immediate' sharing of resources (Woodburn 1982), to systematically eliminate distinctions of wealth, status and power. Yet, rather than being a 'natural' or 'primitive' form of social organization (see Bowles 2006; Boehm 2001 for discussion), egalitarianism may be more related to the fact that hunter-gatherers attribute great importance to power and its effects. Within a context of social coalescence, 'power takes the form of the physical strength, skill or wisdom that draws people into relations clustered around individuals renowned for one or more of these qualities' (Ingold 1999, p. 404). In this context, the term 'prestige' is not directly related to 'competitiveness and ostentation', which are wholly foreign to the tenor of hunter-gatherer life, but nevertheless 'brings out the point that power works by attraction rather than coercion' in these communities (Ingold 1999, p.404). Accordingly, the hunter-gatherer band may be characterized as a social environment of deep mutual knowledge, which can only develop through intertwining or even merging of people's respective life histories with places, animals, plants and other animate and inanimate features of the landscape (Ingold 1999). Therefore, the relations of any social group can never be 'immediate' in the sense originally intended by Woodburn (1982). Sharing is never about just the sharing of food, it is more about the sharing of each other through memories. Personhood is constituted within this context as persons are 'grown' through incorporating the substance, knowledge and experience of others within a field of ^ Springer</page><page sequence="6">J World Prehist (2014) 27:1-42 trust and nurturance. The perceptual orientation toward trust extends to animals, plants and inanimate features of the landscape (Ingold 1999), and more significantly for the purposes of this study, the symbolic activity is performed to protect and perpetuate the wide-ranging relationships of trust and nurturance within an environment that is perceived to be ever giving if its constituents are mutually engaged. The so-called shamans or ritual leaders may be an important agent of social change in these societies; however, their activity is about bringing the forces together to provide continuity of complementarities, rather than accumulating political power (Guenther 1999). Thus, rather than focusing on aggrandizing individuals, the structuring principles of mutual engagement should be sought in order to understand management of power in hunter-gatherer communities. In the last decade, much archaeological research has been concerned with symbolic imagery as the foundation of the social control that constructed binding relations in the Early Neolithic societies. Chapman (1990) and Bailey (1999) were some of the first researchers to direct attention to the symbolic links built between people and place in the Neolithic of the Near East and the Balkans. They argued that the continuous occupation of certain locations, which gradually became the 'tell' structures of the Near East, reflected a claim on a territory. In fact, by strategically linking this claim with ancestral presence, the Neolithic communities may be argued to have manipulated and in some ways domesticated the physical and social space (see also Hodder 1990). In two comparable syntheses, Verhoeven (2002a, b) and Hodder (2007) have argued that the symbolic expression of early sedentary societies was concentrated on a limited range of themes: memory con struction, wild animals, violence, death, and the dominance of humans over animals. In a recent comparison of Çatalhôyiik and Göbekli Tepe, Hodder and Meskell (2010, 2011) have re-emphasized that there were three distinct themes: phallocentrism; wild and dan gerous animals; and the manipulation of body. According to their interpretation, the appearance of a shared set of symbols was related to the growing importance of food sharing in the context of large-scale feasts, and the memorialization of such events by embellishing houses with human and animal body parts that had been part of these cere monies. Indeed, many other researchers also point to the importance of regularly employed food consumption practices as part of an ongoing elaboration of social identities in Early Neolithic societies (Twiss 2008; Asouti and Fuller 2013; Wright 2014). It is difficult to deny the possibility that the ideas behind 'the dominant symbolism' and their regular reinforcement in private or communal practices of food consumption and architectural elaboration were pivotal in the Neolithic transformation. However, we also need to recognize that Göbekli Tepe and Çatalhôyiik were two very different communities, the former being a Later PPNA—Early PPNB site of the Upper Euphrates, renowned for its monumental buildings and so far with uncertain evidence of ordinary dwellings, full-time sedentism or domestication; and the latter being a Late PPNB—Early Ceramic Neolithic sedentary community in Central Anatolia that was organized around agglutinative devel opment of dwellings, with subsistence based on domesticated species. During the PPNA, the common symbolic repertoire and the dualisms, such as wild versus domestic or domestic versus ritual, were only incipient and it was through the agency of places such as Göbekli Tepe, Hallan Çemi, Körtik Tepe and Çayônii that the hunter-gatherer communities pooled their diverse symbols and practices and began to focus on a limited range of concepts, leading to a convergent restructuring of place and identity. Although the out comes may not have been foreseen in their totality by the Neolithic communities, their choices can be argued to have led to the emergence of new codes and rules that shaped identities and paved the way for institutionalized inequality. In other words, social affili ation and cooperation can be successfully approached neither through universal structures &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="7">J World Prehist (2014) 27:1—42 of thought, nor within an evolutionary trajectory. Rather, they must be approached as historically situated and strategically employed processes. Therefore, the emergence and transformation of the common symbolic repertoire, including the development of dichot omies such as the wild versus domestic, or monument versus house, remains to be explored and linked to a more nuanced understanding of symbolic performance and long-term social change. Consequently, framing of the Neolithic as a transition from egalitarian systems to more complex ones, either within an agricultural transition perspective or within a ritual lead ership perspective, may hinder an understanding of the more complex paths to social change. Instead, we may approach sites with the earliest architecture as places where carefully selected elements of symbolic place-making activity were employed. Within this perspective, architectural structures are best considered as an objectification of habitus generating cultural schemes (Bourdieu 1977); that is, they are not merely an outcome of social practices, they guide action. As such, they can be the locus of various strategies of negotiation and manipulation and, we can infer, through a renewed understanding of stragraphic sequences in social terms, social change (McAnany and Hodder 2009). Within this perspective, the emergence and disappearance of monumental buildings of the southeast Anatolian PPNA and early PPNB require closer examination in order to understand what exactly the symbolic control of images and place construction activities achieved. Also within this perspective, we may be able to understand the Early Neolithic as a process of spread of new cultural codes, some related to the emergence of new types of community and personhood, which were being redefined in terms of place, genealogy and possibly sexual difference, as will be argued in the later sections of this study. Early Neolithic Place-Making in Southeast Anatolia: The Evidence In the southeast Anatolian sphere, the tenth millennium BC site of Hallan Çemi is the earliest known site with architecture. Based on the presence of substantial architecture and the seasonal availability of the different types of plant and animal remains found, Rosenberg (1994) argued that the site was occupied for a few hundred years on a year round basis. Three surface structures made of stone were unearthed at the earliest level, Building Level 3. These were approximately 2 m in diameter, with walls constructed of river pebbles cemented in courses using white plaster. All were C-shaped and their floors are unpaved. In Building Level 2, three circular buildings were found. Two of these had paved floors, and one was larger than the others with a diameter of 4 m and a small plastered basin at the center (Rosenberg 1999, 2011a). By the uppermost level, Building Level 1, the specialized function of larger structures becomes more evident. A total of four structures were excavated at this level. They all differ from those found in the earlier levels in that they are constructed of sandstone slabs rather than cemented river stones. Two are relatively small surface structures of 2.5 m in diameter; the other two are significantly larger, about 5-6 m in diameter. Both larger structures are fully circular and semi-subterranean in construction, and each contains a distinctive semicircular stone bench set against the wall. One of these semi-subterranean structures contained a complete aurochs skull that appears to have once hung on the north wall facing the entrance (see Rosenberg 2011a, p. 74 figs. 5-8). The floors of both structures had been resurfaced multiple times with a distinctive thin yellow sand and plaster mixture over a layer of relatively sterile fine dirt fill. In addition, both were gen erally devoid of materials and objects commonly associated with domestic activities (e.g. ö Springer</page><page sequence="8">J World Prehist (2014) 27:1-42 grinding slabs). In contrast, imported materials such as copper ore and obsidian are strongly associated with these two structures. At Hallan Çemi, the structures and features were arranged around a central open activity area approximately 15 m in diameter. The deposits in this open area consisted of extremely dense concentrations of animal bone and fire-cracked rocks, along with plaster features described as storage silos. It has been suggested that this kind of deposit is consistent with the display and consumption of foods characteristic of communal feasting. Some kind of special activity is also implied by the presence of stone bowls and pestles, typically made of chlorite or limestone and often decorated with incised and occasionally relief designs in both geometric and naturalistic motifs. According to Rosenberg, these bowls and pestles were part of food preparation or consumption during feasting events, in which a number of communities may have been engaged through various display and exchange activities. Demirköy is situated 40 km downstream from Hallan Çemi on the Tigris (Fig. 1). The site is thought to have been settled after Hallan Çemi's abandonment, as the material culture indicates strong links to Hallan Çemi. Rosenberg (201 lb) argues that the relocation does not appear to be related to plant domestication as there is no significant change in subsistence patterns from Hallan Çemi: there is continued exploitation of legumes and nuts of the almond-pistachio forest. The most significant difference between Demirköy and Hallan Çemi is the burials. While there were none found at Hallan Çemi, burials of both humans and canids were encountered at Demirköy. The humans ranged in age from infant to adult, with some variation in their positioning. The salvage excavations at Demirköy were of very short duration and the evidence relating to the context of these burials is not well understood. Körtik Tepe is a low hill, 100 x 150 m, located about 30 km west of Batman, along the Tigris. Unlike Hallan Çemi, Körtik Tepe is distinguished by its numerous burials: a total of 455 human burials were recovered from the PPN levels of the site (Özkaya and Co§kun 2011). With the exception of two disturbed by later activity, all of these burials were associated with—but not necessarily directly within or underneath—structures. They were of complete skeletons of both sexes and all age groups. An unreported number are recorded as intramural burials, while the majority are reported to be buried with substantial numbers of objects, mostly broken stone bowls and beads. In the six architectural layers discovered, all the dwellings displayed a round plan. Eighty-six buildings consisted of a single circular room with a diameter of 2-3 m, a single row of stone foundation walls, sometimes with large worn-out mortars and grinding stones and with subterranean floors of compacted mud. In a cluster on the eastern sector of the mound, what would appear to be circular storage units of 1.1-2.1 m diameter with pebble paved floors were also recorded. The excavators distinguish three round-plan buildings from the others in terms of their dimensions and floors (Y3, Yll and Y44). Two of these are in the western part of the mound and the other is located in the eastern part. Y44 in the western part has a diameter of 3.8 m and foundation walls made of medium-sized stones, regularly arranged and mortared with clay. Under the compacted mud floor, a skeleton and the horns of a wild goat were found. Building Y3 in the west has a diameter of 3.45 m and a foundation wall constructed using the same technique as Y44. The walls have been preserved up to four courses, and a skeleton was found under the compacted mud floor. Building Yll, in the eastern part, is 3.42 m in diameter and is presumably recorded as a special building due to the con struction technique rather than the inventory of the building. At Gusir Höyük, 40 km south of Siirt, architectural features and material culture comparable to those of Demirköy, Körtik Tepe and Hallan Çemi were found. In the Ô Springer</page><page sequence="9">J World Prehist (2014) 27:1-42 uppermost phase, an almost rectangular building with a diameter of 10 m was discovered among other, much smaller, rounded or almost circular structures bordering an open area (Karul 2011). In the middle of the larger building, a broken standing stone slab was found along with three simple inhumation burials. One of the adjacent smaller buildings con tained a collective burial of three individuals. In the southeastern section of the site, another round building with possible semi subterranean features and a diameter of 4 m was recovered. Parts of the floor and the wall were paved with stone slabs. In the middle of the building, a broken rectangular stone slab or stela of 100 x 60 cm had evidently fallen from a low rectangular platform. Immediately below this building, the remains of three closely-spaced round buildings have been exposed. They have an external diameter of 10 m but display some constructional dif ferences to the building described above. Specifically, the walls show three concentric episodes of building, a feature also seen in the well-known round enclosures of Göbekli Tepe and later at Nevali Çori's 'cult buildings'. Hasankeyf Höyük is located 2 km east of Batman, between the sites of Gusir Höyük and Körtik Tepe along the Tigris, and will be inundated by the Ilisu Dam (Miyake et al. 2012). The site forms a roughly circular mound, about 150 m in diameter and 8 m higher than the surrounding plain. So far, excavations have been conducted on the upper layers and the radiocarbon evidence from these layers indicates that the site was occupied at least by the second half of the tenth millennium BC. At the highest level, a semi-rectangular subter ranean structure with stone walls was recovered. Pits associated with the fill of the structures contained large stone blocks, including ground stone and large stone slabs, some of which were decorated. At a lower level, a series of subterranean round buildings with stone walls were recovered. While the contemporaneity of these buildings remains to be studied, a large number of animal bones, chipped stones and unworked stones were recovered from their fill. Burials associated with these structures have also been found at the site. The site of Göbekli Tepe is currently at the centre of discussions regarding social life and symbolic behavior before the spread of sedentism in the Upper Euphrates region. The site is located on the highest point of the Germu§ range, overlooking the Euphrates basin approximately 15 km northeast of Urfa. There is no easy access to water in the immediate vicinity of the site, as the springs are located on the plain surrounding the mountain. The structures at the site indicate special symbolic use without significant evidence of seden tism (Schmidt 2011). At the site of Göbekli Tepe, Klaus Schmidt identifies three layers, from the earliest to latest: Layer III, Layer II/III and Layer II (Fig. 2). Layer III includes at least 20 monu mental buildings dating from the PPNA through to the early part of PPNB (Schmidt 2000, 2007, 2010). So far four of these buildings (enclosures A, B, C, D) have been uncovered, with 51 pillars in situ (see e.g. Fig. 3c). The buildings are composed of T-shaped stone pillars, from 2 m to almost 7 m in height and up to 15 tonnes in weight. Each pillar is uniquely carved with a variety of wild animal images. As many as 12 pillars are arranged in a circular fashion in one structure, with a further two larger and more elaborately-carved pillars in the centre (Schmidt 2000; Peters and Schmidt 2004).The outer pillars are con nected by stone benches and walls. There is no evidence of pisé or mud brick but the stone walls have been laid in a bedding of thick clay mortar. It is clear from the many identified quarries that the pillars were cut from the limestone upon which the site is located. T-shaped pillars have also been identified at other locations in the Urfa region, such as Sefer Tepe, Karahan Tepe, Ta§li Tepe and Hamzan Tepe (Çelik 2000, 2004), and, possibly, Yenimahalle in Urfa city centre. However, none of these sites has yet been excavated.

Peters and Schmidt (2004) note that the wild animal imagery on the pillars concentrated on snakes, scorpions, birds, boar, foxes, and felines, as well as bucrania images. Almost all of these animals were apparently brought to Göbekli Tepe, but never in the same quantities as the most common food species of aurochs, gazelle, wild boar, wild cattle, red deer, cape hare and wild ass. There is no evidence of animal husbandry or farming, although minimal numbers of caprines were also consumed at the site. Birds of prey such as falcons, eagles, buzzards, kites and vultures may have been hunted for symbolic purposes. Interestingly, snakes were the most frequently depicted species, often presented as attacking aurochs, small herd animals and potential domesticates; however, no snake remains were found on the site. The existence of non-dietary wild animals, both in imagery and among the animal remains at the site, has been related to the use of their various parts, such as claws, teeth, horns, skin, pelt and fur (Peters and Schmidt 2004). These animal parts arguably signaled both prestige for their users and control of the wild, in connection with the skills displayed in the construction of the buildings. In fact, it may be during this prestige competition that the concepts of person and community began to change, in parallel with the construction of the concept of 'the wild' as something that contrasted with an emergent concept, 'the domestic'. Although no clay artifacts have been found, various limestone figurines were discovered at the site, along with stone tools and large limestone containers and slabs. A very few fragments of thin-walled, decorated stone vessels—similar to Hallan Çemi and Körtik Tepe types—are present in the assemblage (Fig. 3), together with objects known as 'shaft straighteners' and plaquettes of Jerf el-Ahmar and Tell Qaramel type. The site's assem blage is comparable to Çayônii, Körtik. Hallan Çemi, Jerf el-Ahmar and Tell Qaramel, but, according to Schmidt, Göbekli Tepe differs from these sites in terms of its use.

The structures of Göbekli Tepe appear to have been in use and repeatedly altered throughout the PPNA, before they were deliberately buried prior to the abandonment of the site some time in the first half of the PPNB (Peters and Schmidt 2004). As Göbekli Tepe began to contract, Nevali Çori and Çayônii were already beginning to be established as sites with a clear distinction between special buildings and ordinary dwellings. The site of Çayônti in the Ergani region of Diyarbakir represents development over a long time span from the PPNA through the PPNB and the Pottery Neolithic. The earliest and longest occupation span is in the PPNA tradition, encompassing the Round Building sub-phase and the Grill Building sub-phases 1-4. The PPNB tradition continues from the last phases of the Grill Building, 5-7, and encompasses the Channel Building, Cobble Paved Building and Cell Building sub-phases. The last layers, namely the Cell Building and the Large Room Building Phases, are considered to belong to the PPNC horizon by the excavators and represent contraction of settlement during late PPNB (Schirmer 1990; Biçakçi 1998, 2003; Özdogan 1999, 2011a). The Round Building sub-phase is roughly contemporary with Hallan Çemi's Level 2. In this sub-phase, round, oval or amorphous semi-subterranean buildings, 4-5 m in diameter, were constructed with reed bundles. During the Grill Plan sub-phase, rectangular, single room buildings began to appear at the site. Buildings were often made on the foundations of previous structures, with clear boundaries separating each structure. Buildings were clustered together in what may be called two neighborhoods within the southeastern portion of the site, and they all had a similar alignment. The gradual appearance of rectangular buildings potentially places this sub-phase within the same time range as the sites of Göbekli Tepe Layer II/III and Gusir Höyük. There is some evidence for the existence of the special buildings during the Round plan sub-phase, but this does not become clear before the Grill Plan sub-phase. For example, the earliest construction of the Skull Building, a special building that is known to be associated with communal burial practices specifically during the PPNB occupation of the site, may be associated with this phase (Pearson et al. 2013). The original building was apparently round and comparable to 5 meters Fig. 4 Left Early Skull Building BM1; right Late Skull Building BM2 (both adapted from Schirmer 1990, fig. 12) Ô Springer</page><page sequence="13">J World Prehist (2014) 27:1-42 13 the special buildings both at Hallan Çemi and Göbekli Tepe, albeit in smaller proportions (Fig. 4). The construction of the Skull Building began to be given more attention by the end of the Round Plan sub-phase and the beginning of the Early Grill Plan sub-phase. The renewed building was constructed more or less on the same principles as the Grill plan houses (Fig. 5). The Grill plan houses had three components: a large room with a fireplace in the corner, attached to a grill plan component at one end and a narrow compartment made up of small cells at the other. The grill plan component was constructed of parallel wall strips with narrow gaps in between. Ash Özdogan (2011a) argues that the distances between the buildings increased at this time and the separation between the residential and communal areas could be more clearly differentiated by the Channel Plan sub-phase (Fig. 7a-d). Channel buildings were built on the foundations of Grill Plan houses by reorganizing the internal space. These structures had multiple rooms, roughly divided into equal parts. The partitions were achieved by cutting the internal space in half lengthwise and further dividing it by three widthwise. The Skull Building was not the only special building; probably until the end of the Channel Plan sub-phase, the ordinary buildings were accompanied by the Flagstone Building, a rectangular structure with a pair of stone stelae in the center. The building was probably constructed some time during the late PPNA or early PPNB, as it has affinities to Göbekli Tepe's Layer II and to the Nevali Çori's cult buildings at Levels II and III. The existence of two special buildings in the same sector of the site is interesting, and it may be that each neighbourhood had its own special buildings. Throughout the Round and Grill Plan sub-phases, the dwellings would have been oriented toward the Skull Building and the Flagstone Building. Following the Grill Plan sub-phase, there was a hiatus followed by a change in the orientation of the buildings. This may indicate that this time of transition was associated with a period of social and symbolic restructuring, leading to a period of renovation. During this time, the Flagstone Building fell out of use and it was intentionally buried some time during the Channel Building sub-phase. During the Channel Building sub-phase, the Skull Building was again renovated, with some features comparable to the Göbekli Layer II buildings. The building was in two parts, 1 N 4 ii " 1 u u u 3 i q □ □ i i . i 0 5 10 meters Fig. 5 Examples of Grill and Channel Plan Buildings and the Flagstone Building (on the right) (adapted from Schirmer 1990, fig. 14) Springer</page><page sequence="14">14 J World Prehist (2014) 27:1^2 N N k A rum-fin OKfcm i [fy.

The courtyard had plastered floors and an altar stone, while the adjoining narrow component was divided into three interconnecting rooms. In a later renovation, an adobe bench separated the two main components of the structure. Two pillars, which may have been in use earlier, were found buried within this bench. During the Cobble Paved Building sub-phase of mid PPNB, the Skull Building took its final form, with thick, high walls embellished with buttresses, facing the courtyard. The floors were paved with stones, and a well-burnished pink-colored stone altar was present in the courtyard. It is postulated that the buildings of the Cobble Plan sub-phase are two-storey structures. The internal space was divided into three roughly equal portions by splitting a large room widthwise. Circulation between the rooms was maintained through narrow openings in the middle of the walls, creating a passageway along the long axis. A new special building appears at this time, in close association with the now defunct Flagstone Building. The Bench Building is small and was apparently in use together with the Skull Building for a short period. The original occupation sector with all the above-mentioned special buildings began to contract at this time. This contraction was associated with the establishment of new occupational areas on the site, but most importantly with the gradual construction of the Plaza that began to cover most of the original occupation (Fig. 7e-g). The Skull Building was also eventually buried by the construction of this enormous public space. Some differentiation in building sizes may be observable at this time but this differenti ation is not yet significant. In the subsequent Cell Plan sub-phase, the original occupation area of the southeastern sector was completely covered by the Plaza, ending the use of the Skull Building and this portion of the settlement. The Plaza, made of compacted red earth, had two parallel rows of standing pillars, running between the eastern and western neighborhoods. At the eastern edge of the Plaza, the stelae led up to the brand new special building, the Terrazzo building (Fig. 6). This arrangement has clear comparisons with the Nevali Çori cult buildings, although the stone slabs were lined up outside the building along the earthen Plaza rather than inside the Terrazzo building. Although the dwellings in the western neighborhood of the settlement were initially oriented along the southwest-northeast axis, by the late Cell Plan sub-phase all the dwellings of the site were aligned toward the Plaza. The dwellings of the eastern sector ran along the northern border of the Plaza and were clearly distinguished by size. All dwellings were partitioned into three horizontal divisions as before; however, Springer</page><page sequence="15">J World Prehist (2014) 27:1-12 15 0 o' oo.o o®" (b) (d) O O, V &lt;"\ V-' D 0 fhl'* \\X\ „ \ S $ #*£ ^ "9 °°°$ V Fig. 7 Çayônii settlement through time (all adapted from Özdogan 201 la, figs. 6, 8, 14, 15, 31, 33, 34, 36, 57) one of the end rooms was further partitioned by a wall and was sometimes divided into two. The remaining two rooms were cut by parallel walls that ran perpendicular to the horizontal axis, allowing central access along a long narrow space. The Plaza was apparently renewed a few times during this period, and in the second renewal the pillars were intentionally broken and buried under the new floor. By the Large Room sub-phase (Fig. 7h), only the eastern portion of the site had dwellings and the occupation of the site generally began to dissolve. These dwellings were made up of one large room superimposed on the multi-room buildings that formerly existed on the northern border of the Plaza. The Terrazzo building fell out of use at this time. Although the Plaza remained in use, it was clearly no longer well kept. The settle ment shifted further to the north during the Pottery Neolithic Phase, and no special buildings were associated with the occupation after the Terrazzo Building fell out of use. Nevali Çori, now submerged under Atatürk Dam, is located to the north of Göbekli Tepe. Phases I-V comprise the habitation of the Early Neolithic, and Phase VI is repre sented by a Late Neolithic building with pottery dating to the mid-Halaf (Hauptmann 1999, 2002, 2011). Along with two monumental structures, a total of 29 dwellings were recovered at the site. The structures were positioned directly on top of each other and their basic plan was that of a freestanding rectangle with consistent interior divisions (Fig. 8). The earliest levels, Level I and Level II, are dated between 8400 and 8100 BC (Hauptmann 1999).

One house, 21a, was 11.3 m x 4.5 m and was divided into two units The smaller front unit, 3 m x 4.4 m, consisted of two compartments, while the main unit at the back, measuring 8.2 x 4.5 m, was divided first into two segments by a longitudinal partition, and then by two cross walls into six rectangular compartments of unequal size. Two longitudinal channels, 30 cm wide, made of large stones underlie the flooring in a variation on the Channel Buildings of Çayonii. Six burials were found sunk beneath the clay flooring. Five skulls and several long bones were also found. House 25 was 13.25 x 5.4 m and displayed roughly similar characteristics. Two burials were associated with this house and one was missing its skull. Characteristic of the open areas were small pits lined with pebbles. These are commonly known as roasting pits and are known from Halula, Cafer and Çayonii. Level II had three houses of the two-tier channeled type. These houses would all appear to have been built directly on top of the earlier structures. Four burials were found sunk into the floor of 21b. House 26 of Level II is the largest of the ordinary dwellings at 18.2 x 6.2 m. The long unit was 16.1 m, divided into eight chambers, and was closed off from the front unit. The floor was leveled with rubble and then covered with thick plaster. An almost square Cult Building II, covering an area of 188 trT, was located at the northwestern end of the terrace, separated from the rectangular channeled buildings on the southeast. The interior was plastered and coated with a layer of whitewashed clay with traces of black and red paint; there were stone benches along the walls, covered with stone Springer</page><page sequence="17">J World Prehist (2014) 27:1^2 17 Fig. 8 Nevali Çori Level 3 (adapted from Hauptmann 2011, fig. 4, p. 123) In Search of a Model slabs. Set between the benches were 13 monolithic T-shaped pillars, with two further pillars at the center of the structure. The pillars were usually not as elaborately carved as the pillars at Göbekli Tepe Layer III. It is speculated that a small niche on the southeast wall is reserved for a monumental cult figure, while several pieces of limestone sculpture were found buried in benches and the back wall. Hauptmann argues that these sculptures may have originated from the predecessor of this building at Level I. Level III witnesses the development and distribution of settlement (Fig. 8). Two- and three-tiered channeled houses of various sizes were found, with up to ten channels asso ciated with burials. There were four houses in the southeast section and three closer to the cult building, constructed in various orientations. In between these groups of buildings, the remains of a round structure were identified. This structure probably co-existed with Cult Building III, which was built directly inside Cult Building II. Two pillars, decorated with anthropomorphic features, were located in the center of Cult Building III. A small niche on the northeast wall was visible from the entrance; a limestone head with snake was built into the back wall of the niche. By Level IV at Nevali Çori, only one house is recognizable in the southeastern sector, along with the remains of the previously mentioned round structure and Cult Building III. By Level V, the site was clearly on the verge of abandonment and only one structure without channels offers a parallel to the Cobble Paved Building sub-phase at Çayônii. In the later stages of excavation, Hauptmann identified the remains of a U-shaped structure built on the bedrock above Cult Buildings II and III. Its massive construction indicates potential parallels to the structures at Göbekli, as well as to the earliest Skull Building at Çayônii. When the term 'place' is introduced, the archaeological approach invokes spatial analysis at various scales to understand the social organization and technological achievements of the societies under consideration. Due to a number of difficulties in identifying variations in place construction and usage in mobile communities, the spatial analysis of Near Eastern Neolithic settlements has mostly been at the site and intra-site levels and with an assumption of continuous rather than repeated occupation. Nevertheless, the intra-site &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="18">18 J World Prehist (2014) 27:1-42 spatial patterning of architecture and its relation to the distribution of material culture provides important clues as to the nature of social organization at the recorded localities of Early Neolithic communities. For example, an examination of floor plans, building materials and techniques may provide in-depth understandings of basic cooperative social units, often defined as 'households', living in 'houses' in relation to communal activity at neighborhood or site levels. Aurenche (1981, 1982), in his pivotal study of architectural attributes from PPNA to PPNB, focused on floor plans and internal divisions, highlighting the stepwise development of unicellular round buildings, round buildings with internal partitions, unicellular rectangular and multicellular rectangular structures. Within this context, the earliest 'houses', were typically found to be circular huts or subterranean structures constructed by various techniques utilizing mud-brick or stone. In the PPNB, the plastering or special surfacing of floors and the decoration of walls with paintings or installations became widespread (Banning 1988, 2003). Obviously, architectural remains reflect more than technological developments in search of functional forms (Love 2013; Rosenberg 2013). Emergent social inequalities are commonly inferred from an analysis of the location of artefacts of food production, storage facilities, fire hearths, and burials (Wright 2014; Düring and Marciniak 2006). According to such analyses, variations in the material, size and form of architecture, in combination with variation in burial practices, should be evident in the case of increasing competition, development of autonomous units and individual households. Increased segmentation within the architecture or introduction of new symbolic mediums, such as figurines, paintings or other material culture—where further segmentation is structured—may relate to the emergence of formalized social roles based upon sex, age, genealogical relations and skill categories, and the reinvention of social codes for succession within autonomous units (Kuijt et al. 2011). hor example, Mannery (iy//) arguea tnat circular nouses were înaicauve oi more temporary residence, of nomadic or semi-nomadic groups that emphasized a communal lifestyle, especially with respect to food production and consumption. His analogy with the polygynous compounds in Africa, where communal storage was shared by individual dwellings occupied by one or two people, argued that these systems inhibited individu alized accumulation of wealth. Flannery (2002) further argued that the appearance of rectilinear houses with increasingly segmented space in the PPNB should indicate household storage, favoring the independence and expansion of households, with social networks for production and consumption becoming more restricted. In their analysis of the late PPNB Çatalhôyiik houses, Diiring and Marciniak (2006) argue that socially 'successful' houses could be distinguished by the effort invested in preserving and dis playing the temporal continuity of the house by human burials, as well as by the elaborate wall embellishments such as relief sculptures and animal heads (see also Diiring 2005). Many other researchers hold that the transition from some form of nuclear family household to increasingly autonomous extended family households occurred during the PPNB (Banning 2003; Bar-Yosef 2001; Goring-Morris and Belfer-Cohen 2008; Rollefson 2000; Watkins 2008). Research on mortuary practices also underlines the broad regional changes through time, including shifts from community membership to increasingly sep arate and autonomous household organization in the latter part of PPNB (Kuijt 2000; Kuijt et al. 2011). According to Byrd (1994), an early signal of this shift in the later PPNA was the introduction of communal structures, which are believed to have played a role in the resolution of social conflicts possibly arising from the emergence of increasingly inde pendent households, and this development is often regarded as the driving force for the rise of hereditary inequalities (see also Peltenburg 2004). Springer</page><page sequence="19">J World Prehist (2014) 27:1-42 19 In anthropological terms, houses are perceived as social institutions through which societies define membership groups which are not necessarily homologous with families as we understand the concept today. Within this context, 'household' is a complex and highly variable unit, the foundation of which depends upon the cooperating individuals' criteria for relatedness, task-orientation, and co-residence, which may not be directly congruent with our modern concepts either of family or of architectural forms (Wilk and Rathje 1982), but may be expressed through symbolism (Hendon 1996). In Lévi-Strauss's (1991) terms, the individuals that gather around the idea of 'house' aim primarily to ensure continuity, and their cooperative scheme is considered legitimate only if they express this continuity in the language of kinship or affinity. Building on this view, all kinds of architecture may be viewed as a medium through which multiple and intertwined social divisions of 'us' versus 'others' may be constructed. In this sense, 'kinship' would not necessarily rely on biological relations, but rather on successful invention and manipula tion of concepts such as descent, belonging and other social differences based on age, sex and skill. In such an understanding of architecture, monumental buildings may be perceived to have played a central role in the symbolic construction of societies. Yet, they also emerge as merely one particular context of a seamless social action occurring in a variety of everyday places. In other words, neither the so-called houses nor the monuments can be interpreted as isolated mediums for performing distinct sets of practices (Bell 1992; see also Bradley 2002, 2003). At any scale, symbolic action creates an emotional and psy chological context and a mechanism to justify the existence of social norms and rules that are deemed necessary to keep participants together (Turner 1969). Symbolic place-making provides an explanation for the existence of the world, its form and content, and the place of people within it, while articulating the experience through those rules and norms. The construction of places through common symbols is akin to a social contract that constructs the nature and hierarchical order of the cosmos and the rules that govern all kinds of interactions within it (Rappaport 1999). Wilk (2004) argues that the spread of a cultural form requires a pre-existing history of socialization among participants so that there is an agreement on the types of practices to be engaged in and their meaning. Institutions provide standards and terminology that allow disparate groups to compare themselves with reference to a common set of concepts. However, they also accentuate the differences and often become arenas for the negotiation of differences. Symbolically rich spaces may thus become a kind of tool used by indi viduals who wish to justify emerging differences between them and their fellows and to create new social and political opportunities. However, in such contexts resistance can be equally strong, and unsuccessful symbolic performances, regardless of their intensity and elaborateness, may result in conflict and dispersal. Specifically, in contexts of circum scription and reduced mobility, increased social contact and social tension between for merly remote communities may be inescapable. Therefore, as contradictory views emerge, symbolic contexts may be pressed into service; existing symbolic behavior can be elab orated, new symbolic activity can be invented and new ritual spaces can be constructed so that the challenging components of daily encounters are appropriated, subverted or overcome. Donald (1991) would argue that 'meaning' in symbolic communication is referential and fluid, therefore the symbols may be best approached as attention-capturing devices that attract and divert attention to concepts that are in need of evaluation. Materialization of symbols and their particular combinations convey messages to different scales of audience by opening up new possibilities for negotiation, depending on the material's performance •£) Springer</page><page sequence="20">20 J World Prehist (2014) 27:1-42 characteristics, such as durability, redundancy, transferability and expression of invest ment. More importantly, the symbolic discourse employs ambiguous metaphors that may function to legitimize the status quo, but can also give clues about its negotiation (Bloch 1989, 1992). Places for successful social performance evoke familiar traditions, express a meaningful ethos and reflect specific community structures. Differentiation between these places can be situated in the degree of formality present in scheduling, repetition, rules of attendance, and most importantly, the emphasis given to the selection and preparation of symbolic features (Bell 1992). As symbolic emphasis on place increases, as at Göbekli Tepe, this may require consultation with forces that are beyond the immediate control of those participating in the symbolic action. Therefore, for any symbolically rich place to be a successful location of social mediation in the long term, it should balance an attachment to tradition with an attachment to the challenging diversity of opinions and the prospect of change. The symbolic world and social relationships are manipulated within this context; while such a context brings common understandings to the fore, it may also emphasize differences, especially when communities with different practices come into contact with each other. Returning to the Early Neolithic of the Near East, while there is substantial evidence that correlates climatic fluctuations with the emergence of places where human activities were concentrated, to frame these places within false dichotomies of sedentism versus mobility or ritual versus domestic has arguably hampered the understanding of a more fundamental social process that spanned millennia (Boyd 2006). The archaeological indicators, such as the existence of stone architecture, heavy duty material culture, storage pits, cemeteries, evidence for multi-season hunting, presence of commensal fauna and thick cultural deposits, do not necessarily support an argument in favor of continuous sedentary occupation with major reliance on agricultural produce. In fact, there is no evidence that sedentism actually became a widespread strategy before the end of the PPNB. Instead, the available evidence suggests fringe populations of varying degrees of mobility returning to several locations in the landscape where social and economic activities were performed which left some traces of material culture (Boyd 2006). Within this perspective, rather than collapsing discussions of the Neolithic into issues of sedentism and domestication, a focus on understanding the immense variety of relations between people and place emerges as a fundamental issue of archaeological study (Langley 2013). In fact, the emergence of various scales of place-making, as in the Early Neolithic, may be understood as the emergence of a new symbolic surface through which the individual's place in the world, with particular reference to place and the degrees of coalescence, can be deciphered. In more practical terms, Gamble (1998) postulates a scalar ordering of hunter gatherer communities that is composed of 'the intimate network' of five to seven people; 'the effective network' of 6-34 people and 'the extended network' of 100-400 people. Archaeologically, these networks can be differentiated through 'local-scale networks', which encompass the intimate and effective networks, and the wider scale 'regional net works', which encompass the extended network, composed of interlinked local-scale networks. The smaller networks have regular face-to-face interaction where coercive use of power is rarely seen and power relations are maintained by on-going symbolic rein forcement; in the larger scale networks, symbolic signaling of group membership, status and ethos would increase and diversify (see also Wobst 1977). Gamble (1998, 2008), places the appearance of such social networks between 100,000 and 60,000 years ago, when co-dependent development of language and kinship systems underpinned the final diaspora of Homo sapiens with its increased aptitude for social cooperation. According to Gamble (2008), the emergence of built place is directly associated with shifts in the use of Ô Springer</page><page sequence="21">J World Prehist (2014) 2~!\\-42 21 Table 1 Chronological relationships between the sites mentioned in the text Qayonu GObekli Tepe Nevali Qori grill channeled Adapted from Ozdogan et al. (2011b, p. 281) material metaphors to express concepts of social relatedness, and these were fundamentally important in production of kinship categories. The house has proved an especially potent form that embodies social relations in architectural form (Bloch 1998; Carsten and Hugh Jones 1995; Gell 1998). However, social containment can be created by any rhythmic, coordinated action that would leave no traces archaeologically but might be part and parcel of a long history of socialization (Gamble 2008). Gamble (2008) argues that during this formative time of the final diaspora of Homo Sapiens, 'containers' began to be favored over 'instruments'. Container items, such as bowls, caves, bags, mortars, clothes, graves, houses, and skulls metaphorically referenced the human head and trunk, whereas 'instruments', such as knives, pestles, spears, ploughs, looms, needles, and long-bones metaphorically referred to the limbs. These objects arguably constructed particular forms of understanding of the bodily experience, based upon the perceived relationships between the body and particular qualities of the material. More significantly, through this change, the material basis of human identity shifted. Taking this approach, the following section will be an attempt at understanding the con cerns that shaped the nature of engagement at Hallan Çemi, Körtik Tepe, Göbekli Tepe, Çayônii or Nevali Çori. If, as suggested, architecture reflects the language of affinity, then differentiation in architectural forms may represent the construction and transformation of structuring concepts upon which societies were built (Table 1). &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="22">22 J World Prehist (2014) 27:1-42 Shifting Boundaries of Social Networks The Emergence of Extended Networks and Place-Communities At the PPNA sites of Hallan Çemi and Körtik Tepe, the distinction between the special buildings and the ordinary buildings was not easily discernible at the earliest stages of occupation. The status of the buildings was constituted through social strategies of routine practice, that is, through interplay between structure and agency. However, the concept of house, as an institution that can represent various scales of cooperation based upon kin terminologies, may be applied to all sorts of buildings that we observe throughout the PPNA and PPNB (Table 2). The earliest contexts of building activity were small neigh borhoods of free-standing individual dwellings and there were strict regulations to be obeyed in the construction, orientation and continuity of buildings. This situation indicates the importance ascribed to the common understandings of symbolic preparation of places that were recognized by all who were invested in the place-communities. As such the buildings had distinct spatiality and identity; however, they were not completely inde pendent units. In fact, they were very much constituents of the lineage-based intimate unit, which was arguably the central unit of identity formation. Within this context, some buildings began to be distinguished through their construction styles and inventories during the PPNA, and this development appears to be partly an outcome of a new practice that recorded the history of social group construction through the emphasis given to building continuity. Demonstration of building continuity may be related to signaling of successful mutual engagement with the landscape. The visual demonstration of continuity may have been competitive, in time endowing certain build ings and their associated building groups with further prestige and privileges, opening the possibility of advancing in the ranks of symbolic control. The focus on human burials would appear to be an interlinked development of the emphasis given to the visual demonstration of social history. The burial of human bodies was an important practice in the Neolithic of the Near East that linked place, memory and identity in diverse ways (Kuijt 2000; Bienert 1991; Talalay 2004). Human bodies of all age and sex groups could be involved in a complex set of events after death, which reflected the tensions between the communal and its sub-groups. However, considering that there were a range of sites without burials, such as Hallan Çemi and Göbekli Tepe, we may understand that specific locations were selected for this symbolic investment; that is, the burials were arguably reserved for the gathering places of local networks, where more intimate ties between the local groups were forged. Whether the biological or fictive kin relations had previously existed between these groups or not (see Pilloud and Larsen 2011), the place based connections began to form place-based lineages. Consequently, the groups that invested in this symbolic connection may be referred to as the place-communities. In these communities, the construction of buildings may have been a seasonal ceremonial activity which forged a new relationship with place at both a territorial and structural level during a period of intensified social exchange between remote communities. In my opinion, the appearance of wide-scale exchange networks during the PPNA may have begun to change the nature of the social relations pertaining in historically more closely-related local groups. The increased social contact between remote communities during the PPNA may be a result of a need to resolve emergent conflicts between territorial groups. As social contact with remote communities increased, symbols may have come to the fore during the PPNA. Within this context, some individuals would appear to have begun to gain differential access to resources through new alliances.

These new material surfaces of symbolism were used to invent differential narratives about the prestige and identity of the socially differentiated partic ipants in the events. Within such a context, the construction and designation of a specific building as a communal center at the local scale during the later PPNA and early PPNB may be related to a need to avoid the emergent conflicts of competition through close communal control of the structuring principles of social constitution. At this stage, social control was achieved by emphasis on formation of small-scale local networks, which elaborated on their distinctness in tradition while sharing the common symbolism of a wide region. The special buildings at the place-communities may have operated as mediums of participation, but the symbolic control of the group was probably overseen by Ô Springer</page><page sequence="24">24 J World Prehist (2014) 27:1^42 individuals selected on the basis of their significant position in the group history. These positions could be related to an association with building continuity, sex, age, skill, or differential access to resources. Furthermore, these positions were probably not perm enant and the individuals associated with each ordinary but continuous dwelling had a chance to oversee symbolic control within the group life-cycle. Therefore, individual building histories were protected and emphasized alongside the special communal buildings. In this context, there might be a number of special buildings in use, as at Çayônii and possibly at Nevali Çori. These different special buildings were probably associated with different neighbourhoods/lineages of the settlement. Shifts in the ori entation of ordinary dwellings can thus be related to alliances made amongst the lineage groups during their life-cycles. The use of stone stelae or pillars was another aspect of group history demonstration, linked with the burials and building continuity. The use of pillars was a feature of the special buildings across a wide region extending from the Levantine site of Rosh Zin to Jerf el-Ahmar on the one hand and Qermez Dere in Northern Iraq on the other hand (Watkins 1990). In the southeast Anatolian context, the pillars occurred at sites where human burial remains were found in association with both ordinary and special buildings, such as Gusir Höyük, Körtik Tepe and Çayônii, as well as at sites without human burials or ordinary dwellings, such as Göbekli Tepe. The pillars and human burials would appear to have been treated in similar ways. They could be found in singles, doubles or multiples, either standing or buried within buildings. Pillars were sometimes carved with anthropo morphic features and the anthropomorphic plaster statues found at the PPNB site of Ain Ghazal are probably related to the same tradition. I suggest that the symbolic activity around human burials may have negotiated the relationships between the individual dwellings of a neighborhood at a place-community; however the pillars functioned at many interlinked scales. They could stand in individual dwellings as reminders of the symbolic principles upon which the social relations within the dwellings were constructed. Equally, the pillars could embody the group identities that clustered around the special buildings. The use of pillars may thus be related to the problems of representation at both local and regional-scale community events. Within this context, the production, destruction and replacement of pillars was probably an act of power transfer within or between groups who competed over the symbolic control of community. Such destruction and burial allowed for future regeneration of social rela tionships and at the same time made the inheritance of power impossible. The same principle may apply to the building destruction and building burial. The burial of structures with pillars at Göbekli Tepe may be considered within the different scale of social engagement at this locale. The production of pillars here may have emphasized competitive displays of elaborate work, skill and imagination that would make some groups and individuals more attractive to the potential alliances. However, consid ering that the construction and burial of each enclosure at the site of Göbekli Tepe must have taken months, we may deduce that the shared experience was fundamental to the symbolic construction of communities at larger scales. While it may well be that use of the structures was restricted to those with particular needs or privileges, the final use was probably of a much shorter duration than the work of construction, which I argue was the main reason for the existence of such places. The communal work had to be repeated at every regular visit to the site and this practice certainly strengthened bonds. Sites such as Göbekli Tepe brought together a range of groups that were probably in loose territorial networks but did not share the same intimate histories as the place-communities. The communal construction activity at this site guaranteed the regeneration of social &lt;£} Springer</page><page sequence="25">J World Prehist (2014) 27:1^2 25 Table 3 Variation in symbolic place construction and the social scale represented at some PPNA sites Hallan £emi Kortik Tepe Gobekli Tepe (Layer III) Burials No burials Concentration of burials No burials have been identified, although some small human bone fragments, such as knuckle bones and finger pieces are found in the fill of the buildings Burial goods No burial goods Beads and stone vessels No burial goods in most of the burials Building Concentration of long-distance Some buildings Buildings with central differentiation exchange items along with differentiated in size pillars are of comparable bucrania symbolism present sizes at each level; in some buildings, which however, the central began to be differentiated in pillars in each building size are slightly bigger and more decorated Monumentality No monumentality No monumentality Monumental-scale buildings Symbolic Stone vessels with Stone vessels with Stone pillars with imagery individualized individualized individualized focusing on narratives narratives narratives wild animals Social scale Local (?), long-distance Local place-community Regional (extended) exchange (?)

The absence of burial activity at the site of Göbekli Tepe therefore reflects the fact that burial activity was reserved for the construction of more closely related place-communities at sites such as Çayônii, Körtik Tepe or Gusir Höyük (Table 3). Consolidation of the Local Place-Communities and Continuing Symbolic Manipulation The latter PPNA must have been a period of continuous calls on the past to redefine emergent social boundaries at many scales. Within this context, the intensification of social exchanges may have helped the spread of new concepts of symbolic community con struction across wide areas. For example, the evidence from the North Syrian site of Jerf el Ahmar would indicate that the original multi-purpose communal buildings, which are similar to the structures at Göbekli Tepe, also became more symbolically elaborate and their special functions increased by the later stages of the PPNA just before the site was abandoned (Stordeur et al. 2000). On this note, the buildings that were differentiated in size and inventories at Hallan Çemi and Körtik Tepe may not be exactly comparable to the structures with symbolically embellished pillars, as at Göbekli Tepe. There are five sites which date to the second half of the tenth millennium BC located along the Tigris: Hallan Çemi, Demirköy, Gusir Höyük, Körtik Tepe and Hasankeyf Höyük. Despite the intensive surface surveys carried out in the Ilisu Dam reservoir area, a PPNB occupation has not been identified in this area, while the Pottery Neolithic is indicated by the evidence from Salat Cami Yam, where the Springer</page><page sequence="26">26 J World Prehist (2014) 27:1-42 full repertoire of domestic plants and animals has been reported (Miyake 2011; Miyake et al. 2012). This situation is in contrast with the Upper Euphrates area sites such as Göbekli Tepe, Nevali Çori, Mezraa Teleilat, Akarçay, or even Çayônû in the Diyarbaktr region. The PPNA communities of the Upper Tigris were clearly in a common cultural sphere of symbolic communication and material exchange with the Upper Euphrates communities. However, in the aftermath of the PPNA, they appear to have returned to a more mobile existence. During this intermediate stage of late PPNA and early PPNB, there began to appear more isolated locations of landscape marking. For example, the sites of Yeni Mahalle, Hamzan Tepe, Sefer Tepe, Ta§li Tepe and Karahan Tepe (Çelik 2000, 2004), along with Nevali Çori, emerged around the 30-50 km catchment of Göbekli Tepe. While Göbekli Tepe certainly continued to be in use during the first half of the PPNB, the structures at this site began to be made much smaller and usually with only two pillars, which lost their rich imagery but retained their anthropomorphic quality. The final abandonment of the site of Göbekli Tepe was ultimately within the same time span as Çayônû's Channel—Cobble Paved sub-phases or Nevali Çori's Levels II-V, both of which are roughly dated to the Early to Middle PPNB. This should be regarded as a significant shift, and the reasons behind it should be sought within the new special-building construction activities that began at place-communities such as Çayônii and Nevali Çori. I argue that the emergent social inequalities that stemmed from the formation of extended networks were perceived as threatening to the intimate and local-level community structures (for example, groups or individuals with differential access to resources could attract more partners and change the dynamics of local egali tarian networks). This situation necessitated a careful control of social exchanges at a local level. While the Tigris-Ilisu communities returned to a more mobile hunter-gatherer way of life, at the place-communities, the emergent social differentiation of the late PPNA was suppressed by emphasizing various egalitarian strategies, observed through building con struction and the disappearance of the symbolic elaboration previously observed on pillar surfaces or stone bowls. Arguably, the disappearance of individualized adornment of burials with burial goods was part and parcel of a renewed emphasis on egalitarian sup pression at communal events that aimed to control the social reproduction of communities through control of prestige-enhancing symbolic activity concerning death, partnership and birth. Within this context, the burials were recruited to re-invent close ties between the local groups who may or may not have been historically related. Through this process, local level place-communities were consolidated while, on the Upper Euphrates, places such as Göbekli Tepe were gradually abandoned. In the southeast Anatolian sphere, a typical PPNB occupation was still composed of neighbourhoods of freestanding individual dwellings and the new rectangular multi-room structures were constructed on the previous locations of the round houses. These structures were built on a preconceived plan that was not agglutinative in nature. While there was little room for improvisation of buildings within a given time period, the manipulation of space changed regularly throughout the occupation, as suggested by the evidence at Çayônû. At Çayônû, the transition was rep resented by differences in the orientation of the ordinary dwellings. The Skull Building was reconstructed during this transitional stage, represented by the Grill sub-phase. A new building called the Flagstone Building was also constructed in close association with the Skull Building; however, this building did not survive the transition, whereas the Skull Building remained the most important structure in the original occupation area of the site. After a series of renovations, the Skull Building and its associated neighborhood was Ô Springer</page><page sequence="27">J World Prehist (2014) 27:1-42 27 abandoned by the Cobble Paved sub-phase; this area, possibly the oldest occupied part of the whole settlement, was then incorporated into a public space called the Plaza. This would appear to be related to a major event that brought together skeletal remains of approximately 450 individuals within the Skull Building (Pearson et al. 2013; Özbek 1988; Özdogan 201 la). Despite the egalitarian emphasis and a degree of control achieved through the definition and consolidation of exchange/marriage networks and social relations among the members of a place-community, the continuous reinvention and reconstruction of the symbolically charged communal buildings (e.g. at Çayônii) indicates that social tensions continued. Specifically, the individual dwellings continued to emphasize their distinct social bound aries and prestige through some differentiation in building size and continuity. Within this context, the communal labor projects, such as building construction or communal feasts, were probably performed through participatory decisions forged within the communal buildings. The leadership remained fluid without evidence of differential wealth accu mulation, and the selection of representatives and the hierarchical relations between them may have been based on such criteria as demonstration of historical connections to the place (e.g. being a member of the most continuously occupied building); connections to remote places and resources (through marriage and material exchange); and membership of a specific age, descent or sex group. Recent research suggest that food consumption augmented these distinctions during regular daily social practice, so that social tension could be alleviated and emergent social inequality could be masked in the Early Neolithic societies (Twiss 2008; Asouti and Fuller 2013; Pearson et al. 2013). Whereas the early phases of place-community consolidation were still based on com munal activity steered through the agency of symbolically potent buildings with strong references to the past, in later stages of the PPNB, the place-communities began to sever their immediate ties with the buildings and neighborhoods of the past through new strat egies of building and manipulating public space. The 'closing' of the Skull Building and the 'sacralization' of the area associated with this neighborhood is interesting especially in context of traditional emphasis on building continuity and displays of rootedness in place. Arguably, such a shift would require a profound recognition that the present is no longer a continuation of the past but leads to a future with a new social order. However, in the case of the PPNB community at Çayônii, such openness also involved extreme caution and a great degree of connectedness to the traditions that linked the local place-community. I suggest that the past was now considered to be different from the present; as such it had to be covered up and its use had to be carefully monitored so that its potency could be strate gically revealed only in certain ways (McAnany and Hodder 2009). Therefore, the burial of a substantial number of individuals in the Skull Building and the sacralization of space may be related to a need to create new symbolic control opportunities for the emerging social order. It is significant that this transition also coincides with the development of new neighborhoods and the emergence of size differences between buildings and increasing fragmentation of internal space within them at Çayônii. The new public space created by the Plaza at Çayônii soon incorporated a new special building called the Terrazzo Building. The Terrazzo Building was comparable to the cult buildings at Nevali Çori, but with a significant differ ence: the pillars were aligned in two parallel rows along the Plaza outside the Terrazzo Building. At this time, the ceremonial complex of the Plaza and the Terrazzo Building was associated with the relatively larger 'elite' residences, while the more ordinary structures continued to exist in the western sector. The alignment of the pillars on the Plaza appeared to connect these two neighborhoods. Perhaps this public constellation was strategically employed to allow space for the emergent social order and its elites. Ô Springe</page><page sequence="28">28 J World Prehist (2014) 27:1-42 The Emergence of Autonomous 'Households' This new attempt at symbolic control clearly did not survive too long. The stelae were soon destroyed in a later renovation of the Plaza at Çayônii. The Terrazzo building fell out of use. The Plaza remained in use, but was no longer well kept. By the Large Room sub-phase at Çayônii, the occupation began to be dissolved; only the eastern neighborhood of the site had buildings composed of one large room superimposed on the earlier 'elite' multi-room buildings running along the northern edge of the Plaza. The evidence at the late PPNB— early Pottery site of Akarçay Höyiik (Özba§aran and Duru 2011) would indicate that the Large Room Buildings may actually be associated with some communal functions, as they were found at the center of other buildings constructed on multi-room plans reminiscent of the PPNB traditions at Çayônii. This was a time period leading up to the wide-scale adoption of sedentism and of ceramics in many areas of Northern Mesopotamia. The settlement at Çayônii shifted to a different part of the site during the Pottery Neolithic, while keeping connections with the general locale, a feature of Pottery Neolithic settle ments as a whole. No special buildings were associated with the occupation after the Terrazzo Building fell out of use, another characteristic of the Pottery Neolithic in this region. This development may be perceived through parallel changes in the realm of the individual dwellings. During the Channel and Cell Building sub-phases at Çayônii, there was a shift from closed multi-room plans to open multi-room plans with internal circu lation. The floors were raised and the human burials began to be associated with specific parts of the buildings after the closure of the Skull Building. Burials were regularly placed within the ordinary dwellings, while the secondary burials or isolated human bones were found in the open areas in the western sector of the settlement at Çayônii. In later sub phases of Çayônii, secondary burials ceased and the dead were buried predominantly within the dwellings. In these burials, some differentiation of grave inventory according to sex is suggested by the excavator; however, detailed information on this subject awaits further publication. These changes in ground plan are often related to functional necessity, but these shifts would appear to be related to changes in the symbolic constitution of the social groups. Thus the architectural changes may refer to shifts in imagined connections with the past and potential development of new taboos about place preparation in order to accomodate new hierarchies and social boundaries. The reclaiming of burials by the individual dwellings can be associated with the growing independence and institutionalization of a social unit which may be called a household (Kuijt et al. 2011). Through such independence, the groups associated with the dwellings would be able to form relationships with other groups without reference to the former communal regulations of the place-community. Therefore, the final disappearance of the monumental buildings from the local place-community contexts may be related to the emergence of individual dwellings as symbolically and socially congruent, independent units by the end of the PPNB. It is arguable that what may be called houses, as institutions with firm hierarchical relations between gender and age groups and structures of authority, may have developed during this stage. At the site of Akarçay Höyiik, the individual dwellings began to be incorporated through the construction of the open spaces into common courtyards in-between the structures (Özba§aran and Duru 2011). It is significant that this development took place during a time period when increased reliance on domesticates allowed the emergence of groups with new economic resources that could be used in negotiation of new social relations. I suggest that the consolidation of place communities and the emergence of individual dwellings as independent units of social Springer</page><page sequence="29">J World Prehist (2014) 27:1-42 29 action were developments that paved the way for the demise of communal building activity. Therefore, it is important to understand the nature of the symbolic shifts that were precursors of this development. I would like to focus on the dramatic change that took place in the elaboration of the pillars during the consolidation of place-communities. The pillars at the PPNA levels of Göbekli Tepe were carved with wild-animal imagery, and where it was possible the maleness of these animals was deliberately emphasized. However, with the onset of the PPNB, the pillars lost their symbolic narratives. Some researchers argue that there was an explosion of wild-animal symbolism at the end of the PPNA, prior to the appearance of the first domestic animals, which correlated with the development of domestication and the dominance of humans over plants and animals (Helmer et al. 2004). By comparing the evidence from Göbekli Tepe to the Syrian Euphrates sites of Jerf el-Ahmar and Tell Abr, these scholars argue that the focus during the latter PPNA was particularly on bulls, panthers, foxes, vultures and snakes, with minimal representations of potential domesti cates and other food animals. However, once a production economy was fully mastered during the middle PPNB, with the exception of the bull, these symbols gradually disap peared and were replaced by representations of domestic animals (Helmer et al. 2004; see also Mithen et al. 2005). While the suggested link between domestication and wild animal symbolism is attractive, the relationship may not be as direct, because the wild animal symbolism continues to be an integral part of symbolic life throughout the latter PPNB at other sites. Specifically, at Çatalhôyûk wall paintings within houses involved a number of wild animals, including bear, deer, boar, leopards, vultures, and foxes along with oxen, although sheep and goats were domesticated and used as major food sources at this late-to post-PPNB site (Hodder and Cessford 2004). I argue that wild animals were primarily symbolic of notions connecting place, landscape and identities, rather than economic practicalities. In broader terms, the hunter-gatherers of the Early Neolithic were probably struggling to dominate and domesticate not nature but each other. Based on similarities between T-shaped pillars with arms found at Nevali Çori and a 'male' statue that was uncovered during road construction in the city of Urfa (Fig. 9), the T-shaped pillars at Göbekli Tepe were defined as anthropomorphic (Hauptmann 1999; Schmidt 2000). A number of other finds in the region, including a double-faced statue from Gaziantep and a statue with a phallus from Adiyaman-Kilisik, both at the Gaziantep Museum, seem to support the idea that the T-shaped pillars embodied male characteristics which could be produced at various scales (Hodder and Meskell 2010). It has been argued that anthropomorphic forms with distinctly emphasized sexual characteristics start to appear in the figurine corpus of the Near East rather late, possibly at the end of the PPNA (Kuijt and Chesson 2005; Rollefson 2008), just as the rituals at Göbekli Tepe and Jerf el-Ahmar were at their height. More significantly, there seems to be a close relationship between figurine production and the consolidation of place-commu nities and the emergence of 'houses', since no figurines have been recorded either at Göbekli Tepe or within the special buildings of Çayônii (Özdogan 1999). The figurines are considered rare finds in Early Neolithic Levantine contexts, although Taurus-Zagros sites can yield large numbers of figurines during the PPNB. Especially at Nevali Çori, there is a proliferation of figurine production which is correlated with the disappearance of symbolic depictions from the T-shaped pillars of the cult buildings. Morsch (2002) notes that, of the 700 figurines excavated at early PPNB Nevali Çori, the overwhelming majority are anthropomorphic, representing either 'male' or 'female' bodies in almost equal propor tions. Much more distinct representations of female forms, commonly known as 'mother goddesses', enter the record during the later PPNB (Voigt 2000, 2007; Kuijt and Chesson Springer</page><page sequence="30">30 J World Prehist (2014) 27:1-42 0 50 100 centimeters (a) (b) (c) (d) Fig. 9 a T-shaped limestone pillar from Nevali Çori, h. 2.5 m.

Parallel to the development of sexual differenti ation in figurine production in the later PPNB, painted representations of stylized females can be found within houses like those at the PPNB site of Halula (Akkermans and Sch wartz 2003). At this time, the communal buildings disappeared from the archaeological record and most of the PPNB communities (e.g. Çayônii) went through a reformation stage, although others that were formed during the PPNB continued to be occupied (e.g. Mezraa Teleilat and Akarçay). While the female figurines would appear to be given emphasis during the PPNB, there is also evidence of male imagery in the late-to-post-PPNB of Mezraa Teleilat (Özdogan Ô Springer</page><page sequence="31">J World Prehist (2014) 27:1-42 31 Table 4 Symbolic place-making and social scale through time B g §2 o"8 IS m s 8-g -sa &gt;&gt;!!&lt;*. ëo1û-2° 13 &gt; *c ° u Ü .£ ^ J2£ "5 Ifi "&gt; P £ 'S ° 3 ,2 'S 3 3 g .O O- g I o lia" »-si ^ «Il IS s S. «s S Sc« ■?

At this site, small stone statues with flat facial features were found alongside other phallic and sexually ambiguous figurine types (Ozdogan 2003). These statuettes' mid sections feature arms and, possibly, male genitalia, and are reminiscent of the small 'horned' objects found at Hallan Çemi and the larger abstract pillars in the center of house structures at Qermez Dere. They are also remarkably similar to some of the small stone statues found at Nevali Çori and Göbekli Tepe (Fig. 10). According to Peterson (2010), sexually ambiguous images and inclusive participation in the control of the symbolic world may offer evidence for a sexually balanced hegemony, whereas a trend toward the production of single-sex images and segregated participation in control of symbols may indicate more hierarchical situations. In contrast to the male emphasis in the statues of Göbekli Tepe, the mortuary practices of the time period show lack of sexual bias. From a cultural perspective, this could have been the basis for con structing a 'hegemonic balance' (Peterson 2010) whereby both sexes were most likely recognized as equal participants in the symbolic construction of communities. From a different perspective, Hodder and Meskell (2010) argue that the existence of sexually ambiguous anthropomorphic objects within a corpus of figurines, like those in PPNA contexts, may represent the emergence of ideas suggesting the possibility of transformation of the concept of gender. In Daems's interpretation (2007), figurines were increasingly used as 'teaching' devices that mediated female initiation rites. Daems (2007) also notes that the production of realistically modeled female figurines increased and that they became more widely distributed during the subsequent Ceramic Neolithic Period (later seventh to sixth millennium BC). During this period, particular attention was given to limbs, hair, and the face along with a focus on sexual organs. For the Early Neolithic of southeast Anatolia, one could tentatively argue that, by manipulating the symbolic world at many intertwined scales of building construction and food consumption, a convergence in ideas about sex and sexuality, as well as about the past, place and community, was initiated. Such a convergence must have been achieved through social exchanges, including of sexual partners, between remote and diverse communities. Formerly emergent but carefully controlled social practices, perhaps involving polygyny, may have gradually spread due to the perceived success of these strategies in prestige accumulation and prestige signaling. Arguably, the separate identi fication of 'female' and 'male' bodies in the production of small statues and figurines was instrumental in the emergence of the economically and symbolically independent social units that we come to know as households; however, at any scale, the exercise of power does not appear to be one of coercion but of attraction and conviction. While there may be an effort to shift power in favor of certain groups, it is difficult to argue that such appeals were successful in establishing a visible hierarchy with particular emphasis on sexual difference. Conclusion This study began with two questions: if hunter-gatherer social life is based upon reciprocal engagement with the landscape, and if sharing and communal work are emphasized to sustain group cohesion without coercive use of power, then how do we begin to observe the transformation of social life during the Neolithic? Feasting theory may allow us to see the strategic use of the sharing ethos in favor of certain individuals, but under what circum stances was such manipulation accepted? By arguing that the fundamental issue to be focused upon in the Neolithic Process is the emergence of new ways of community Springe</page><page sequence="34">34 J World Prehist (2014) 27:1-42 formation through the agency of places, I investigated the following three issues: How and why did the places of the Near Eastern Neolithic symbolically materialize in the way they did? How can we understand the multiple scales of community formation from such materialization—that is, can we understand the concepts that structured community for mation and social hierarchies during the Neolithic by employing socio-symbolic approaches? The 'Neolithic Revolution' in the Near East was an incremental and undirected social process, which was solely determined neither on the basis of domestication nor of eco logical adaptation. Hunter-gatherers of southeast Anatolia did not decide to become sed entary in order to domesticate animals and plants. In this context, research focused on finding a particular geographical origin for sedentism, domesticates or ceramics may fall short of explaining the variety of historically situated pathways to social change. An alternative interpretation suggested here is that the core phenomenon of the Neolithic Process in southeast Anatolia was a transformation in the perceptions of community and personhood through the agency of places. Therefore variety in place-making is expected to show local responses to the spread of new cultural codes associated with new perceptions of place and identity. Based on a review of existing research, I explored the similarities as well as differences between the symbolic construction of the earliest sedentary places known in southeast Anatolia, such as Hallan Çemi, Körtik Tepe, Gusir Höyük, Hasankeyf Höyük, Göbekli Tepe, Çayônii and Nevali Çori. I focused on the differential relationship of these places to burial activity, building continuity and the use of symbolic imagery, while highlighting the emergence of the special ritual buildings and their associated features in a chronological context (Table 4). I argued that through the contextual relations forged between the burial practices, pillars, buildings, symbolic imagery and anthropomorphic figurines, the places became expressive mediums of a social negotiation that ordered identity and community in diverse but comparable ways. Alliances began to be defined through a variety of place-based social relations, which were entangled with new ideas of community and personhood, most of which were expressed in the language of kinship or affinity (see Watkins 1990, 2004, 2006 for a comparable argument). Therefore, the difficulty in differentiating the special build ings from the ordinary dwellings, as also suggested by Finlayson et al. (2011), must stem from the fact that both were built on comparable principles of symbolic construction of communities both at local and regional scale (see Banning 2011 for an alternative view). The harsh conditions of the Younger Dryas apparently had different effects in different regions due to pre-existing social history as well as resource abundance. In this context, the PPNA communities of the Levant may have begun to 'coalesce' at locations where they could manage their social relations through the fluidity of burial practices, whereas the ideas that structured social cooperation in southeast Anatolia may be more akin to 'adhesion', as the elaborately defined and rigidly place-bound communal structures would suggest. In this context, the earliest 'houses' of the PPNA and the early PPNB may not have necessarily housed families in the modem sense of the term, but may nevertheless be associated with particular constructions of kinship and affinity. At least in some places, it is possible that the 'houses' were an intrinsic part of a range of rites and practices that sought to enhance fertility and group continuity: otherwise, beyond the use of 'houses' for specific events related to various types of initiation and regeneration, pregnant women as well as children may have found refuge in buildings associated with their respective lineages and enjoyed the security of resources procured through social cooperation that was mediated through the agency of communal symbolic action. &lt;£} Springer</page><page sequence="35">J World Prehist (2014) 27:1^2 35 During the PPNA of southeast Anatolia, formation of place-communities began with local groups being attracted to particular locations where increased socialization with communities beyond the intimate network was possible (Table 5). There was a variety of such places, including Hallan Çemi, Körtik Tepe and Göbekli Tepe, where different spheres of community formation, and the individual's place within these spheres, were displayed by selective employment of various features of a convergent symbolic pool. While the local networks were integrated at the sites where burials began to be concen trated, the special sites such as Göbekli Tepe integrated the larger scale regional groups. By the end of PPNB, places that were associated with specific types of symbolic activity, such as burials, became the foci of social life, whereas other places, which were solely asso ciated with monumental activity, gradually faded. Indeed, the communities of southeast Anatolia cooperated with remote groups at places such as Göbekli Tepe, and some of these groups were probably related to the communities of Upper Euphrates sites, such as Jerf-el Ahmar, during and in the aftermath of a cli matically stressful time period. However, the emergence of highly elaborate special buildings with emphasis on male sexuality, at places such as Göbekli Tepe, demonstrates the manipulation of many circulating ideas of the 'social' into a new synthesis. The symbolism of the PPNA was associated with overarching mythologies that constructed links with a variety of creatures and features of the landscape. The particular synthesis present at Göbekli Tepe merely extended this symbolism to the pillars, but at the same time used the pillar surfaces to create new narratives associated with the sexuality, as well as the prestige, of their makers. This new synthesis was embedded in competitive displays of symbolism, which were probably motivated by assertion of identity boundaries at many scales, from protection of group histories to management of individual differences in sex, age and skill, all of which may have been expressed through pollution taboos promulgated in origin myths. However, during the hrst halt ot the FFNB, socially threatening liaisons forged at large scale meetings began to be suppressed by emphasizing local scale cohesion at local place communities, such as at Nevali Çori and Çayônii, where the suggested stories and myths were continually reinvented to highlight an egalitarian ethos. Although competitive needs were still incipient, the egalitarian ethos was forged through a conservative emphasis on dwelling form and size. Through this emphasis, the dead began to be buried without grave goods, the size of the special ritual buildings began to contract, and pillar surfaces lost their elaborate symbolism. The suggested contraction in building size and reduction in symbolic elaboration are also demonstrated at Göbekli Tepe's Layer II. Moreover, communal events, such as those conducted within Çayônii's Skull Building, apparently functioned to emphasize collective identities of the dead and the living, rather than individuals or smaller factions within the local group. In these contexts, major labor projects could be mobilized, but possibly without tangible benefits for the organizers, who may have been selected on the basis of their age and skill by the constituents of the social group. Therefore, the communal control and decision-making mechanism was arguably founded upon partici patory representation, which did not provide opportunities for further manipulation by ambitious individuals. By looking at the transition from Layer III to Layer II at Göbekli Tepe, one may be able to argue that the PPNA mythologies that constructed communality with a variety of entities of the landscape shifted to an emphasis on fertility as the basis of continuity and repre sentation of the groups that were clustering in place-communities. The new narratives arguably began to construct new social hierarchies through the manipulation of stories about procreation and genealogies that were now narrated with reference specific to places. &lt;£} Springer</page><page sequence="36">36 J World Prehist (2014) 27:1^2 Through this shift, the place-communities were consolidated but also the individual dwellings began to negotiate their independence. Within this context, male and female roles may have been manipulated through anthropomorphic imagery, which apparently focused on maleness in meetings of large-scale networks during the PPNA, while it focused on female bodies in the place-communities of the PPNB. The latter focus may be associated with particular linkages forged between female fertility and maintenance of group success and prestige, which was symbolically represented through building conti nuity and reinforced through daily food-consumption practices. Interpretatively, the focus on sexuality in anthropomorphic statues of the late PPNA as compared to the female figurines of the PPNB may be related to a concern with control and transmission of the symbolic accumulation in place that required appropriation of sexuality and perhaps gender roles. These new practices may have emerged with the spread of new ideas and social—including partner—exchanges among the cooperating groups. The new emphasis on local-scale group cohesion, together with appropriation of gender roles, could be the basis of the emergence of independent 'households'. The displays of building continuity were basic constituents of prestige, and despite the suppression of competition during the PPNB, various strategies, possibly involving organization of competitive feasts, began to manipulate relationships in new and different ways. It seems plausible that polygyny gained importance as a strategy for protecting building/group continuity and labor control during this stage. The house was thus established as a con gruent unit of economic and symbolic activity and labor control in the latter part of PPNB, while the communal buildings of the late PPNA and early PPNB disappeared. Arguably, increased reliance on subsistence economies based on domesticates was also an outcome of this social process. The increasingly independent households began to leave place-com munities, and the wide-scale adoption of sedentism and spread of the 'Neolithic Package' to the western portions of Anatolia in the seventh millennium BC began within this context. Kinship and its relationship to political economy is a long established area of research in social sciences (e.g. Morgan 1877; Joyce and Gillespie 2000), and within this context, the rise of alienable property is often related to a shift from matrilineal to patrilineal descent. On this note, Marlowe's ethnographic studies (2004) indicate that residence tends to be matrilocal as dependence on gathering, hunting, and fishing increases. Similarly, Holden and Mace's (2003) studies among the Bantu and Bantoid speaking populations of sub Saharan Africa suggest that societies that are organized around cattle ownership tend to move away from matriliny. While the residence patterns during the Neolithic await further investigation, one thing is clear, that in the post-PPNB landscapes of the seventh millen nium BC, symbolic features of Early Neolithic social integration reappeared in increas ingly diversified and often portable material mediums, like ceramics, figurines, amulets, or 'stamp seals' (Atakuman 2013). These diverse objects allowed more complex manipula tion of social relationships within and between communities. However, the monumental structures were not to be constructed again before the fourth millennium BC. Acknowledgments I would like to thank Stuart Campbell, Carol Delaney, Murat Dirican, Leyla Welkin, Deborah Semel and a number of anonymous reviewers for sharing their thoughts on earlier versions of the draft. Without Dr. Ahmet Çinici's skill in drawing, it would probably have been very difficult to demonstrate the argument. However, if there has been any substantial improvement to the main tenets of my argument, it happened during the revision and editing process led by Tim Taylor and Sarah Wright at JWP.
