<plain_text><page sequence="1">* ABSTRACT The term 'sacrifice' is used by experimental biologists to describe methods for killing laboratory specimens. In Western societies, 'sacrifice' usually connotes a process of 'making sacred', a process Durkheim and his followers interpreted as a ritual transformation between 'profane' and 'sacred' realms. This paper examines whether 'sacrifice' in the experimental context bears any relation to such traditional usage, or whether, as animal rights advocates argue, the term is no more than a euphemism for brutal and unnecessary slaughter. Drawing on ethnographic observations of laboratory practice, the paper argues that 'sacrifice' means much more than simply killing a specimen, and that the violence done to the animal victim is part of a systematic 'consecration' of its body to transform it into a bearer of transcendental significances. While scientists do not treat their practices as ceremonial rituals endowed with religious meaning, laboratory 'sacrifice' is a part of a sequence of procedures through which the naturalistic animal body is transformed into an abstracted analytic object with generalized significance for members of the research community. Sacrifice and the Transformation of the Animal Body into a Scientific Object: Laboratory Culture and Ritual Practice in the Neurosciences Michael E. Lynch It has been shown how a whole series of preliminary operations, lustrations, unctions, prayers, etc., transform the animal to be immolated into a sacred thing, whose sacredness is subsequently transferred to the worshipper who eats it. (E. Durkheim)' For laboratory scientists 'sacrifice' is a technical term. In texts on laboratory procedure, and in the vernacular of laboratory technicians, 'sacrifice' refers to a variety of methods for killing laboratory animals, in preparation for, during, or subsequent to their use as experimental subjects. Such metaphoric use of a term usually associated with religious ritual has been criticized as a euphemism serving only to justify cruel and unnecessary modes of killing.2 In contrast, I will argue that the Social Studies of Science (SAGE, London, Newbury Park, Beverly Hills and New Delhi), Vol. 18 (1988), 265-89</page><page sequence="2">266 Social Studies of Science metaphor illuminates a transformation of genuine significance in a culture dominated by scientific cosmology. 'Sacrifice' ordinarily implies an act of 'making sacred' in terms of a Western dualism between 'sacred' and 'profane' realms.3 While the mundane laboratory animal is not transformed into a 'sacred' object per se, its material body and the interpretive sense of that body are radically transformed through a series of preparatory practices which turn the animal into the bearer of a generalized knowledge. Using observations taken during an ethnography of a neurosciences laboratory in 1975-77, supplemented by more recent discussions with researchers from a variety of biomedical fields, I will discuss how laboratory animals are progressively transformed from holistic 'natural- istic' creatures into 'analytic' objects of technical investigation. My study is one of a growing number of ethnographic and socio-historical investiga- tions which document how mundane laboratory practices and local understandings provide tacit foundations for universalistic representations and beliefs in scientific communities.4 Stimulated by developments in the philosophy and history of science,5 such investigations treat scientific communities not as intelligentsia with privileged access to truth, but as occupational subcultures sharing specialized techniques and understandings. For a social scientist to study the organization of cutting-edge research requires extensive efforts to understand the specialized practices and technical language shared by members of the disciplinary 'culture'. Various forms of participant observation and 'reflexive ethnography' have been employed by the anthropologists and sociologists doing these studies. My study is particularly influenced by ethnomethodo- logical and phenomenological initiatives on the study of order-productive activities.6 The scientists I observed and interviewed for this study worked mainly with rats, and much of their routine practice and conversation pertained to those animals. These practitioners developed specialized understandings about animals, some of which were published in esoteric brain science journals. 'Animals' in these articles were represented, for instance, in terms of electron micrographs and statistically based arguments about the regeneration of axons in the cell layers of the hippocampus. Such 'animals' were relevant only as cases which demonstrated an abstract regenerative process in a generalized brain. Other understandings about animals, rarely communicated in accounts of laboratory methods, per- tained to rats as holistic living creatures. These understandings were communicated informally, and were not validated through rigorous testing.</page><page sequence="3">Lynch: Sacrifice of Animals in Laboratory Culture 267 They were part of the everyday life of the laboratory, consisting of various sorts of tacit 'know-how', recipe knowledge, and experimental craft that enabled practitioners to deal with the contingencies of 'handling' laboratory rats. This paper investigates the relationship between animals considered as analytic products of research, and rats as naturalistic creatures to be 'handled' in the laboratory. While the 'analytic animal' is a creature in a generalized mathematical space, the 'naturalistic animal' is a phenomenon in the commonsense life world.7 The 'analytic animal' therefore becomes the real animal in a scientific system of knowledge, while tacitly depend- ing upon the 'naturalistic animal' for its practical foundation. This is to say not simply that the abstract representations of animal tissue produced in the laboratory necessarily refer to an animal that once lived; it is to raise the question of how scientific knowledge is produced on the basis of pre-scientific praxis. Though commonsense knowledge of animals is a form of 'subjugated knowledge',8 with little or no founda- tion in positive science, laboratory practitioners rely upon such knowledge in order to produce scientific findings. To clarify this issue, I will first define the difference between the 'naturalistic animal' of commonsense reasoning and the 'analytic animal' of scientific demonstration. Then I will discuss the 'rendering practices' through which scientists transform the one into the other, focusing on the role of 'sacrifice' as a pivotal moment in this process. The Naturalistic Animal By 'naturalistic animal' I mean the animal in ordinary perception and interaction; the animal of common sense, the animal as it is viewed and acted upon in the world of everyday life. The 'naturalistic animal' is the animal appreciated by laymen; a subject of scientifically unfounded attributions which have little possibility of rigorous verification. It is the animal championed by animal rights advocates and to which human-like 'feelings', perceptions, sensitivities, and even 'thoughts' are attributed. Primate, a Frederick Wiseman film, is a vivid documentary on the 'naturalistic animal' and its difference from the scientifically accountable animal. The film depicts animal experimentation at a primate research laboratory. In one scene, a rhesus monkey is shown undergoing a per- fusion procedure which involves the dissection of the heart and injection of a preservative fluid into it, using the final beats of the organ to transport the fluid through the vascular system and into the brain. Eventually, the</page><page sequence="4">268 Social Studies of Science animal is decapitated, preparatory to dissecting the brain, and the camera lingers on the human-like features of the head as it rests on the bench while a scientist casually discusses the procedure. The camera provides a naive audience with a horrible spectacle accent- uated by an apparent lack of sensitivity by the human participants within it. The 'dead-pan' facial expressions, mechanical gestures, and 'flat' tonal qualities of the scientists' voices project an indifference to the gory scene that the camera makes explicit. The scientists' actions are represented as methodic routines within which the corporeal animal is treated as an object in, and for, the technical procedure, rather than a possible witness to it. Such a depiction invites the onlooker to rely upon a commonsense point of view from which to perceive the amorality of the technical dismembering. What is not extensively documented, and perhaps cannot be documented in an entertaining way to a lay audience, is the esoteric sense of the experiment which motivates the scientists' actions. Rather than criticize the film for its heavy-handed treatment, I want to call attention to the difference between the commonsense and scientific perspectives on laboratory animals. I do not intend to define the common- sense (or 'naturalistic') view as deficient in comparison to the scientific view. Indeed, I will argue that the scientific view depends, to an extent, upon actions and judgments associated with the naturalistic view. It is not simply a corrective for an erroneous perspective. The naturalistic animal that Wiseman's film displays to a lay audience is a subject of anthropomorphic identifications. For a commonsense reasoner (and for a scientist acting as a commonsense reasoner), the animal is assumed to possess a subjective basis of behaviour. The animal is holistically viewed as a living being, a subject for-itself as well as in-itself. Interaction with animals in the naturalistic mode, such as between a pet and its owner, is rich with actual and assumed elements of reciprocity, empathetic understanding, and emotional attachment.9 The existence of the qualities and capacities of the naturalistic animal may not be subject to rigorous proof, but they are presupposed in many of our ordinary references to, and interactions with, animals, even on occasions where laboratory animals are prepared for experiments. Perhaps many of these references ultimately are little more than a shorthand way of dealing with 'complex mechanisms', analogous with the way computer 'hackers' ordinarily act toward their computers and speak of them as though they were endowed with moods, emotions, and other forms of reactive subjectivity. 10 But it is notable that vocabularies and actions implying a 'sentient being', while used freely in the course</page><page sequence="5">Lynch: Sacrifice of Animals in Laboratory Culture 269 of laboratory experiments, are carefully screened from official accounts of the data and findings of biological research using animal subjects. 1 To claim that the 'naturalistic animal' is an animal of common sense does not necessarily give it a base pedigree. The 'naturalistic animal' has had many illustrious defenders; Voltaire, Montaigne, Hume, and Darwin have all, to an extent, defended it with arguments against those, like Descartes, who would reduce it to a mechanism. 12 The defence of the 'naturalistic animal', however, invokes a commonplace capacity rather than a specialized competency: The arguments are in this case so obvious, that they never escape the most stupid and ignorant. 13 These 'arguments' include a variety of imputations to animals, treating them as holistic living creatures and not as the incidental embodiment of a variety of interlocking systems or mechanisms. Specific animals are recognized for their individuality, and even their 'personality'; 'emotions' such as pain, guilt, fear, remorse, anger and joy are attributed as an 'internal' basis for the animal's actions and reactions; 'cognitive' attributes, sometimes of considerable complexity, are imputed in refer- ences to the animal's cunning, wariness, and other strategic capabilities; and in all of the above attributions, elements of reciprocity are implied, as in Montaigne's well known reference to his cat: When I play with my cat, who knows if I am not a pastime to her more than she is to me?14 The basis for understanding the 'naturalistic animal' differs markedly from the 'analytic animal' discussed in the following section. The 'analytic animal' is the product of laboratory activities. I will argue that the 'analytic animal' is a rendering or transformation of the 'naturalistic animal' that relies upon commonsense access to laboratory animals while at the same time it rules out such informal modes of reasoning from relevance to the final product of the work. The Analytic Animal The analytic animal is ostensibly an artifact - a product of human intervention. It is actively shaped by human agency, and in some cases literally carved up. Descartes' argument that the animal is no more than</page><page sequence="6">270 Social Studies of Science a machine becomes a self-fulfiling prophecy, since laboratory procedures assure the removal of the characteristics that make up the naturalistic animal (its life, its holistic and reciprocal presence, and its 'subjective' attributes) in the scientific rendering of the phenomenon. During the electron microscopic study of regenerative processes in the mammalian brain observed in my ethnography, the term 'animals' was used in unusual ways. For instance, a brief excerpt of some shop talk between the lab director and an assistant went as follows (the conversation was recorded with permission of the participants, 20/5/75): Director: What animals are they? The same animals as those animals? Assistant: They're the same animals. Director: So, what have we got, montages from four - four montages from the same animal. That's spectacular. Now we're makin' progress! Assistant: That was 290, and the other was ... At the time of the conversation, the two participants faced a drafting table on which was placed a small stack of 'montages' of electron micrographs of brain tissue. The micrographs were pasted together on a cardboard backing to present a continuous view of a field of neuronal axons and dendrites in the hippocampus of the rat. By analyzing these 'montages' they aimed to document regenerative changes in the tissue at variable time points measured in units of days after a lesion which destroyed a specific region of the brain. When the director refers to 'animals' in the first line, he orients to the montage displays, presumably asking about the identity of the laboratory rat from which the material was taken. He exclaims that he and his assistants have managed to make four separate montages from a single animal, and the assistant follows by citing a numerical identity of the particular 'animal' ('290'). In this brief sequence of conversation it is notable that the director uses the present tense when speaking of 'animals' in the first line, even though the rats from which the electron micrographs were taken are long since dead and their carcasses were discarded except for a few tiny fragments of brain tissue. He uses the term 'animals' to refer to the micrographic documents, and more particularly, to a numerical index (the number 290 in this case) which keeps track of a collection of the documents. 'Animal' is thus a quantitative index -a coherent grouping of documents ultimately referring to an animal that once lived, but more immediately signifying a graphic rendering of the animal's remains.</page><page sequence="7">Lynch: Sacrifice of Animals in Laboratory Culture 271 As far as the present state of the project is concerned, 'animals' means an ordering found in documentary materials. This ordering is documented with a numerical 'inscription',15 written on the cardboard backing of the montgage. The inscription identifies the particular rat and the number of days that intervened between the lesion of the rat's brain and its 'sacrifice'. Animals are arranged into cohorts in terms of such 'days', and each cohort provides a 'time point' in a serial account of anatomical changes in the tissue's 'recovery' from the lesion. The same inscription was previously written in a number of different places: on a tag affixed to each rat's cage while the animal was still alive, on the rat's tail (written with a marking pen) just prior to its sacrifice, on a jar of preservative fluid in which the decapitated head was placed, on a disk of plastic in which dissected fragments of the brain were embedded, and on the container in which electron micrographic sections were stored. Each of these sites marks a stage in the selection and processing of the animal's remains. Eventually, the various montages are grouped into cohorts, and the cohorts are statistically analyzed to make up a graphic demonstration of changes in the pattern of axonal regeneration at different time points after the experimentally induced lesion. The 'animal' index is significant in so far as it helps constitute a graphic 'point' in a mathematical account of a biological process, while at the same time it retains a reference to the original 'naturalistic animal': the laboratory rat that once lived prior to being reduced to preserved fragments and statistical frequencies. This index enables concrete artifacts such as the plastic disks, micrographic montages, and statistical graphs to be viewed as documents of 'natural' phenomena. 'Good' and 'Bad' Animals In the lab's vernacular,16 the numerical index became synonymous with the 'animal'. At one time, a practitioner was heard to cite the number 'forty-nine', and to remark, 'He was a good animal all the way around' (fieldnotes, 24/5/75). I understood this to mean that the animal not only behaved in the appropriate (docile) way for experimental purposes while it was alive, but that the various displays of data derived from its remains were of 'good' quality - well fixed, nicely stained, and relatively free of artifact. The 'goodness' of the animal referred to the readability, clarity, congruence with anticipations of what the data should look like, and the ease with which it could be treated as a standardized member of a cohort.</page><page sequence="8">272 Social Studies of Science 'Bad' animals were referenced with a variety of epithets. Generally, such complaints did not refer to the behavioural qualities of a living animal, but to the recalcitrance of the material remains when subjected to experi- mental operations. For instance, on one occasion an animal was assessed as 'bad' when electron micrographs of its brain tissue showed unusual 'holes' - blank areas within the contexture of cellular organelles. Other 'bad' animals showed blurry membranes, or crystalline grains - artifacts traced back to errors in procedures through which the animal's residues were prepared for microscopic analysis. In these cases, the 'badness' of the animal was recognized in reference to the appearance of electron micrographs, insofar as these were indexed to the processing of a par- ticular laboratory rat. Just as a 'case' in medicine is both more and less than an individual patient,17 an 'animal' for laboratory practitioners is a reduced and abstracted version of a laboratory rat. Whether assessed as 'good' or 'bad', an 'animal' is a set of contingent material and literary products of laboratory work; it is a 'cultural object',18 whose cultural base is provided by the local practices and discourse of the laboratory. A critical element of this 'cultural object', however, is that it is demonstrably more than a collection of artifacts; it is treated as an organization of 'data' that refers beyond its immediate material presence to a hypothetical sequence of events in a generalized brain. The account of this brain transcends the material existence of any given animal, since an 'animal' is apprehended in light of, and in reference to, the system of events documented by the several cohorts of animals, viewed as standardized time points. Rendering the Naturalistic Animal into the Analytic Animal The slaughterhouse provides an original site of industrial process; a 'disassembly line'19 for transforming the domesticated animal into the cultural object, 'meat'. Each animal in a cohort undergoes an identical set of procedures in identical locales. Each animal is progressively dismembered in a serial process, as an object of technical rendering performed by labourers and machinery designed to 'handle' each case identically. Similarly, the living laboratory rat is transformed through a series of mechanized and methodical actions into the cultural object, 'data'. Both processes are subjected to criticisms along similar lines by animal rights advocates.20 My interest in rendering processes, however,</page><page sequence="9">Lynch: Sacrifice of Animals in Laboratory Culture 273 is not with criticizing laboratory practices with animals, nor with considering the practices only as consequences of industrialism; instead, I wish to address these processes in a wider social context as means through which the 'naturalistic animal' is converted into an analytic object of research, a 'ritual' object with a 'capacity to synthesize and circulate meanings from many domains and specific situation contexts through the agency of a comparatively limited number of tokens or vehicles, sometimes very simple in form'. 21 Neurological phenomena are indirectly, if at all, visible in naturalistic contemplation of the living animal. Typically, neurologists get access to their phenomena by performing operations on the living animal to expose and exhibit its interior brain processes. This usually involves violence to the integrity of the rat's body: the insertion of electrodes into the living brain, the extraction of brain tissue for the purpose of keeping it 'alive' in vitro for a few hours while experiments are performed upon it, and dissection and fixation of the dead animal's brain for use as a document of living neuronal processes. In addition to the problem of exposing hidden neurological processes is that of producing credible claims and demonstrations for a disciplin- ary community.22 For neuroscientists, it is not enough to show what brains look like. Instead, brain materials are organized into graphic demonstrations. The squishy stuff of the brain becomes a subject of graphic comparison, sequential analysis, numerical measure, and statisti- cal summary. In the case discussed here, laboratory animals' brains were literally packaged as graphic objects to be coded and analyzed statistically.23 The transformation of the naturalistic animal into a mathematically analyzed complex of data is a multi-stage process. This transformation begins even before the rat is taken into the laboratory. Animal species, and domesticated varieties of such species, are selected and bred for specific experimental purposes. In the case of the Sprague-Dawley rats used in the experiments described here, the breed was said to be particularly suitable because of the appropriate size, docile disposition, ability to survive stress- ful operations, and uniformity of brain dimension from one individual to another. Standardization of dimension was said to reduce interanimal variation, and to facilitate the graphic summarization of the visible residues of various animals into cohorts in a time series. The selection and breeding of rats was thus done with an orientation to a generalized 'mathematical' space transcending the brain of any given animal.24 Standardized size is significant when, for instance, during neuro- physiological experiments an anesthetized rat is laid out on a rack, with</page><page sequence="10">274 Social Studies of Science two screws clamped in its ear sockets to hold its head rigidly in place. A hole is cut in the top of the skull and electrodes are lowered through a hole. To pinpoint various cell layers of the brain with an electrode, a standard atlas of three-dimensional coordinates is employed in reference to calibrations on the apparatus. Standardized brain size enables practi- tioners to translate the coordinates of the atlas to positions within the particular brain. Animal Sacrifice: A Pivotal Moment in the 'Career' of the Laboratory Animal The transition from an ordinary rat to an abstracted and mathematized organization of data occurs in a series of stages. A pivotal moment in this rendering process is often that of the 'sacrifice'. Of course, it is not always necessary to 'sacrifice' animals in order to turn them into objects of research, and in some cases animals are 'sacrificed' after experiments have been completed. 'Sacrifice' is therefore not the only way in which animals are 'consecrated' for experimental purposes; indeed, the genetic design and domestication of laboratory animals anticipates their use as analytic subjects. In the cases described here, however, 'sacrifice' was a technical condition for visualizing brain constituents, and methods of 'sacrifice' were closely integrated with experimental procedures. It is only in this context that I speak of it as 'pivotal'. A variety of methods of 'sacrifice' are used in lab work: injecting an animal with a narcotic and then fixing its tissue by vascular perfusion (described below); beheading the animal with a miniature guillotine; or swinging a rat by the tail to bang its head on the edge of a sink. The aim of each of these methods is to integrate the death of the animal with the aims of the experiment. Different practitioners from distinct specialties express preferences for some methods over others, and explain their preference for, for example, the guillotine, by claiming that this method results in a minimum of biochemical change in the rats' tissues. The aim is to minimize the effect of death on the examinable record of the animal's remains produced through the procedure. Since it is the structure of living cellular matter that is at issue, the impacts of death are minimized as much as possible.25 The term, 'sacrifice' is a naturally occurring metaphor,26 used by laboratory scientists as a name for methods of killing an animal so as to transform it into data. The term resonates with traditional religious</page><page sequence="11">Lynch: Sacrifice of Animals in Laboratory Culture 275 significance, and scientists are not oblivious to these significances.27 Beyond the obvious use of the term to justify destruction of animals for the 'higher' causes of scientific knowledge and medical progress, are a number of more detailed analogies between the transformation of the 'naturalistic' to the 'analytic' animal, and that of the 'profane' to the 'sacred' object in religious ritual.28 In a classic definition, Hubert and Mauss describe sacrifice as a practice which establishes a 'communication' between sacred and profane worlds by means of a victim that is destroyed in the course of the ceremonial process.29 As de Heusch,30 who for the most part rejects Hubert and Mauss's schema, points out, sacrifice is more than an offering: If animal sacrifice has received little attention from anthropologists it is because, more often than not, they perceived it as a banal phenomenon, a form of offering, a mere gift. Yet the 'thing' given must be put to death in order to affect the invisible forces so that life may be perpetuated. Hubert and Mauss were not mistaken. The killing of an animal in a traditional sacrificial context is isolated, both in a moral and in a spatio-temporal sense, from ordinary life and from the ordinary implications of such an act.31 The animal, often a domesticated one, is carefully prepared, and sometimes bred, as a sacrificial victim. In order to establish and sustain the victim's role as an intermediary - a communicational channel between visible and invisible domains - exact sequences of procedure are followed, and careful attention is focused on the victim's place in an abstract system of coordinates. In some instances, selected portions of the animal, or even a proxy representation, are isolated for use in ceremonial meals and other ritual dispositions, and the fragment acts as an icon. What seems to happen - or at least one of the things that seems to happen - in, for example, the consecration of an animal for sacrifice is that the animal is made into a symbol. And we must remember that symbols are man-made; they are 'unnatural' rather than 'natural': they are not to be found lying around like pebbles on a beach. And whatever else a symbol is, it is essentially and by definition something that stands for, 'symbolizes', something else.32 The particular sacrificial victim can be a 'scapegoat' used to expiate a particular transgression by the sacrifier (the person or group for whom the victim is sacrificed), or it can become a bearer of more generalized human problems. In either case, it is a subject of close human identification.</page><page sequence="12">276 Social Studies of Science There are, of course, limits in the extent to which laboratory 'sacrifices' exhibit the above properties of animal sacrifice. There are, as well, aspects of religious ritual which do not generalize beyond specific cultural contexts.33 While it is certainly the case that scientists do not conduct their 'sacrifices' with an explicit reverence toward the transmutation of the animal into a sacred object, the concept of 'sacrifice' is nevertheless applicable in certain respects. Principally, these have to do with the basic themes of (1) preparing a victim in such a way as to create and sustain an orientation to coordinates in an abstract space; (2) destroying the victim in order to establish a mediating link between visible and invisible realms; and (3) constituting the victim as a bearer of human attributes. Together, these 'ritual' requirements of sacrifice entail a handling of the animal's body and its fragmentary residues to create and preserve an extended domain of temporal, spatial, and human significations. Although in laboratory sacrifice these significations are not 'religious', they transcend the concrete limits of the naturalistic animal's corpse and disclose the onto-theological order of what Heidegger calls 'the mathematical' .34 (1) Preparing the Victim How the laboratory rat is prepared for sacrifice establishes its iconic significance in a generalized account. On occasions where troubles occur during preparatory procedures, the significance of the animal's corpse within broad spatial and temporal orders of relevancy is thrown into doubt.35 The following cases selected from field notes illustrate such troubles and their impact on the 'analytic animal' being constituted. Case #1 (reconstructed from field notes 12/2/75) A lab practitioner explained to me that a cohort of rats had been subjected to an experimental lesion and then injected with radioactive thiamadine. The animals were scheduled to be sacrificed a few days afterward in order to assess whether the thiamadine had concentrated in certain cells within their brains. The thiamadine was used as an index of meiotic processes associated with the rapid division of certain types of cells thought to be involved in the recovery from brain injury. The practitioner stated that, unfortunately, he discovered the rats' corpses in the cage one morning prior to the time when the sacrifice was scheduled. He speculated that the radiographic treatment weakened their resistance to infection subsequent to the operation. He admitted, in retrospect, that he should have injected the animals with penicillin. This example indicates that in order for the rats to be properly sacrificed, they must not simply die as a result of laboratory processes, since their deaths are accountably tied to a practical and temporal course of action.</page><page sequence="13">Lynch: Sacrifice of Animals in Laboratory Culture 277 The scientist must be able to argue that the rats died 'on schedule' as a result of deliberately induced causes. Otherwise, the animal has no utility as data and is merely dead; it does not act as a signifier of a 'higher' order. Case #2 (from field notes: 2517/75) A fouled-up experiment - everyone's on edge, silent. H [ab. director] is steamed up. The experiment, from what I can make of it (questions being definitely out of order today), is an attempt to locate radioactive traces in slabs [of brain tissue] subjected to stimulation bursts in the slab chamber. Apparently, the ennervation pathways differ in 'rostral' versus 'caudal' exposures of the hippocampus, and the material should be located only in the rostral portions. The thing went awry during the dissection of the rat to remove the hippocampus. D killed the rat and began preparing it for the tissue chopper. At a certain point, H asked which end was the caudal. D answered, but H wasn't satisfied, which led to a complicated description with hesitation and some uncertainty by D. He attempted to explain how he had turned the hippocampus over after removing it. He wasn't satisfied, and asked D to take one chop. He chopped the end of it [the hippocampus], and D said it was caudal, but apparently was still uncertain. Then, it was pointed out that the oxygen tanks connected to the slab had run out, which created further outbursts from H on how screwed up things were. This case demonstrates that the accountability of the procedure required an orientation to the spatial as well as temporal ordering of the sacrificial practice. The assistant's mistake was in 'losing' the reference of the animal's flesh to an ideal set of spatial coordinates, a three-dimensional matrix that pervaded the rendering process and acted as the basis for the integration of the animal's remains with a graphic display of data. Case #3 (summary of field notes 2214/75) J is busy administering a procedure called 'sacrifice through intercardial perfusion'. The object, and victim, of the procedure is a cohort of Sprague-Dawley rats, each of which has previously been subjected to a surgical operation which destroyed a specific region of the cerebral cortex. A cage tightly housing six white rats is set on the lab bench, nearby the array of tubes, vials, surgical instruments, and instructions which make up the apparatus for the procedure. Each of the rats has a number written on its tail with black felt-tipped pen,36 and each sports a surgically stitched gash running the length of its head. J deftly grasps the tail of one of the rats, swings it out of the cage, and lowers it toward the cement floor, allowing its forepaws to scramble frantically for purchase while its rear legs remain aloft. While the rat is thus preoccupied, J takes a hypodermic syringe with his other hand and jabs it at the exposed belly of the animal. It curls up on itself, gnashing at the needle and frustrating J's attempt to penetrate the skin properly. J tries again with a similar result, and then picks up the animal and swings it in a wide arc several times to disorient it. He then succeeds on his next attempt at injecting the rat with the sedative.</page><page sequence="14">278 Social Studies of Science In another minute the rat is immobile, and J makes a tentative snip at the loose skin over its abdomen. The rat jerks spasmodically and emits a sharp squeal. J curses, and waits another half minute before trying again. This time the rat is more docile. J cuts through the skin, muscle and ribs, holds the exposed cavity open with clamps, exposes the heart, and punctures it with a hypodermic needle connected to a line of surgical tubing running down from a vial filled with a clear aldehyde preserva- tive. The perfusion fluid flows from the needle as J struggles to insert it through the thick, slippery muscle of the heart. The heart is still beating, though weakly, when J finally succeeds in placing the needle firmly within it. The pumping action of the dying heart transports the fluid to the vascular system of the brain, preserving the tissues from within. After a short time, J tests to see if the perfusion 'took'. His method for doing so is to push the forepaws with his finger to check for muscular stiffness. They are not stiff, and J curses, 'This one's fucked, it's worthless.' He checks again a minute later and complains, 'It's still not stiff.' Muttering resignedly, he snips off the rat's head with a pair of shears, tosses the decapitated body in a sink, and places the head in a vial. He writes the rat's ID number on a strip of adhesive tape fastened to the jar. I ask, 'What happened with that guy?' He responds, 'I don't know.' Each of the remaining rats in the cage undergoes a similar operation in its turn: each case presents a unique struggle and a particular set of contingencies, and each ends up as a head in a numbered vial. (2) Destroying the Victim On the face of it, this operation is profane (and punctuated with profan- ity). There is nothing of the solemnity and symbolic trappings associated with, for example, Judeo-Christian ritual. Nevertheless, the problems occurring during this instance of 'sacrifice' point to the problem of killing the animal in such a way as to assure its value as an icon. The aim of the perfusion operation is to preserve the legible integrity of brain cells. In this case, the lab assistant is uncertain as to whether enough perfusing fluid got into the vascular system to reach the brain. The forepaws test is a practical way of checking whether the animal's tissues were reacting to the fluid. The assistant goes ahead with the operation despite the possible trouble. Later, the brain will be sectioned for electron microscopy, and at that time practitioners will decide whether its appear- ance is 'good enough' to merit its use as data. On several occasions while examining electron micrographs, practi- tioners cited troubles such as occurred in the above instances to explain blurry or otherwise anomalous appearances in the photographs. A reading of the micrographs provided an account of the adequacy of the series of procedures of preparing the specimen. The assessment of the micro- graphs determined whether the animal was successfully rendered into data, or was 'merely dead'.</page><page sequence="15">Lynch: Sacrifice of Animals in Laboratory Culture 279 Although it would be mistaken to equate the analytic data produced through the sacrifice of the animal with a 'sacred' order, the conversion of the naturalistic to the analytic animal does involve a shaping of the animal's residues to refer them to an abstracted and purified set of theoretical relations in a 'scientific' world, seemingly behind the everyday world of the laboratory. Sacrifice is a mediating act, and the transcen- dent significance of the animal is not achieved when the sacrifice is judged to be executed improperly. (3) Constituting the Victim The 'analytic' animal, although proximally a representation of a cohort of rats, is ultimately a subject of human identification since the anatomical and physiological properties of the animal brain are generalized to represent the mammalian (and therefore the human) brain. Without such identification, experimentation for the sake of finding out about rat brains would make little sense, and would be less likely to receive funding. Although the rat does not represent a specific 'sacrifier' (in the sense of being used as a scapegoat to expiate a particular person's transgres- sion), it does act as a medium through which to address more general human concerns with disease and degeneration. Sacrifice can also be something of a 'rite of passage' for participants in the laboratory's research, since it is among the first tasks assigned to new members. Successfully performing lesion and sacrifice opera- tions on a cohort of rats enables the novice to acquire 'material' for his or her own experiments. At the same time the practices constitute a threshold for the novice to get his or her 'hands dirty', personally, in a direct, participatory, transformation of self and animal. The 'analytic animal' becomes not only a bearer of abstract knowledge to be learned about, but a responsibility, something created by one's own hands. Following Durkheim's policy that the 'sacred' order is a transcendental projection of comprehensive social experience, we could say that the 'analytic' order is a generalized and mathematized projection of the complex of practices which make up day to day laboratory tasks. While the 'scientific world' is not a world of gods and spirits, it is a world of abstract relationships never concretely experienced, but iconically represented through concrete residues and traces.</page><page sequence="16">280 Social Studies of Science Utilizing the Naturalistic Animal as a Means for Extracting the Analytic Animal The relation between the naturalistic and analytic animal is not simply a dichotomous one. The naturalistic animal provides the conditions for achieving its analytic counterpart. Through a series of practices (sometimes including the breeding and rearing of the animal) that prepare the animal for experimentation, the lab worker begins with the naturalistic animal in order to supersede it. As Wieder argues in a study of chimpanzee researchers, laboratory practice is rich with skills and lore about how to 'handle' animals in order to assure their status as 'good' experimental subjects.37 Laboratories often employ specialists who show particular abilities at 'handling' animals.38 Scientists candidly, and even avidly, discuss these practices in casual conversation, although they typically present the stories as a mildly humourous sideshow to laboratory activities. For my purposes, however, the stories reveal an empathetic orientation to lab animals as living, holistic, creatures with needs to be attended, and reactions to be monitored. In the positivistic genre of most research reports, methods of handling animals and the vernacular language and belief associated with those methods are too idiosyncratic, experimentally unproved, or 'subjective', to be worthy of mention, and yet positive natural science cannot get done without such 'subjugated' knowledges.39 Like physicians who show good 'bedside manner', scientists who are 'good with animals' can sometimes obtain compliance from their subjects which otherwise would be impossible. This is particularly obvious in behavioural experimentation, where, for instance, a researcher who worked with ants in maze experiments, confided that experimental success depended, in part, on his abilities to monitor the 'emotions' of his ant subjects. He learned to interpret whether or not his subjects were agitated or 'calm' enough to undergo maze tests by examining the position and movements of their antennae. He also said that he was especially careful in the way he transferred the ants to his maze apparatus, by placing a matchbox cover before the ant, allowing it to walk up the cover, and then gently transferring it to the maze. Although he maintained his behaviourism to the extent that his report described his 'communication' as a somewhat mechanistic reading of antennae positions, the scene unfolded as a con- frontation between man and ant, where both acted as reactive subjects to each other. An empathetic art of monitoring ant 'moods', and selecting appropriate moments to begin experimentation was implied. Even in experimentation on dead animal tissue, methods of handling animals are important. Lesion operations, electrophysiological monitoring,</page><page sequence="17">Lynch: Sacrifice of Animals in Laboratory Culture 281 and anatomical examination begin with living animals, even though the animals soon end up dead as a result of the procedures. In informal discus- sions, practitioners sometimes told me of how they handled animals during such procedures, and of why they selected one kind of animal over another. Rabbits were said to be docile, though they were prone to 'panic' and to die at inappropriate times.40 Rats, on the other hand, tended to bite and frantically try to escape, though, in general, they have the advantage of 'appropriate' size, relatively low cost, and a traditional reputation as 'vermin' with minimal human sympathy. To deal with the animal's reac- tion to procedures, a number of ad hoc practices were used to 'calm', 'disorient', or otherwise ready the animal for an operation. For instance, as illustrated in Case #3 above, injecting a rat with anaesthetic in its belly proved difficult since the animal would often curl over on itself and bite at the needle. Gently 'soothing' the animal beforehand by stroking it, or swinging it in the air by its tail to dizzy it, and then holding it by its tail with only its forepaws on the floor enabled the practitioner to insert the needle while the animal scrambled to get footing on the floor.41 Practitioners often describe these procedures in anthropomorphic lan- guage, and the practices presuppose some of the features associated with the 'naturalistic animal'. Animals are treated as holistic, living, reactive subjects to be soothed, cajoled, tricked, and gently led through the procedures that transform them into analytic subjects.42 Although such properties of the 'naturalistic animal' are not validated by the analytic findings yielded by experimentation, such findings are made possible through practices which presuppose such properties. Conclusion This paper has argued that the 'analytic animal' constituted through scientific procedures is a fallible and derivative product of the 'naturalistic animal' of commonsense experience. It is derivative since the 'naturalistic animal' provides a tacit starting point, and continual point of return, for the actions and interpretations of laboratory workers. It is a fallible product since the practices of converting animals into adequate data are fraught with contingency. Inadequately performed 'sacrifices' and other procedures sometimes result in the production of 'merely dead' animals rather than mathematically organized data with generic representational significance. The commonsense beliefs and practices associated with the naturalistic animal are often ignored, contested, or dismissed by scientists when</page><page sequence="18">282 Social Studies of Science focusing on the analytic products of their procedures. For scientists, the analytic animal is a privileged representation subjugating, in piecemeal fashion, the anthropomorphic attributes of the naturalistic animal. On the other hand, many elements of the lay public have grown suspicious of this privilege. For them, the animal of common sense is richer, more intimately a part of everyday life experience, while the analytic animal is esoteric, and not easily understood. As a result, analytic knowledge can seem a poor excuse for dismembering the naturalistic animal, just as esoteric religious belief might seem a poor excuse for human sacrifice for someone not steeped in, for example, the Aztec tradition. This paper has argued, however, that the animal for science is not completely divorced from the animal of common sense. While science apparently subjugates common sense to its truth-finding procedures, detailed analysis indicates that common sense is continually a part of the methods through which it is subjugated - it persists as an unacknow- ledged basis of experimental practice. This does not mean that science is contaminated, or made less true, by its intimacy with common sense. The very possibility of getting 'good' results depends upon that relation. If scientists wish to neutralize 'anti-scientific' public attitudes they might consider acknowledging more openly in their pedagogy and public presen- tations that 'objective' results are rooted in commonsense knowledge and subject to social contingency.43 Moreover, such self-explication could have more than publicity value, since it would feed back into laboratory practice itself. Take, for example, the implicit elements of 'sacrifice' discussed in this paper: that the death of the animal is what makes possible its analytic value, that this death becomes a vehicle of human identification, and that it is accomplished through a ritual enact- ment. At present, the 'naturally occurring metaphor' of sacrifice is only partly relevant to laboratory practice; it is not fully embraced, as its implications are 'forgotten' at the site of lab work and in the analysis of its products. Practitioners do not fully embrace the analogy, and its relevance is counteracted by the evidently mundane and disenchanted use of laboratory specimens in routine experimental practice. Although this may seem to be an outlandish suggestion, scientists might enhance their own, as well as the public's, respect for their practices with animals if they were to institutionalize more fully their own metaphor of 'sacrifice'. The 'sacrificial' destruction of an animal is condoned in Western religious traditions because of beliefs in the transformation of the victim's body into a sacred object. The symbolic and ritual elements of the sacrifice help to express and clarify this mediation through killing. While some of these themes are present in sacrifices of laboratory animals, the</page><page sequence="19">Lynch: Sacrifice of Animals in Laboratory Culture 283 ritual elements of laboratory sacrifice are not fully and openly acknow- ledged as a normal part of scientific practice, and at present they do not constitute an explicitly worked-out ceremony expressing a coherent ethic. Expressing such acknowledgement could serve to uphold respect for the life that is lost as well as the abstract knowledge that is gained through experimental procedure. * NOTES Earlier versions of this paper were presented at the second Summer Conference on History, Philosophy and Sociology of Biology, St Mary's College, Indiana, 25 June 1985, and at Faculty Colloquium, Department of Sociology, Boston University, 5 February 1986.

Luc de Heusch, in Sacrifice in Africa: A Structuralist Approach (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1985), criticizes Durkheim, Hubert and Mauss, and to a lesser extent Evans-Pritchard, for imposing a Christian concept of sacrifice on the African and Asian cultures they describe. His criticism focuses particularly on the idea that sacrifice implicates a 'sacred' domain, and a linkage or rite of passage between 'profane' and 'sacred' realms. While such a concept of sacrifice may have doubtful relevance to non-Western usage and practice, for my analysis of North American scientists' practices it is more pertinent to consider ordinary Western usage, and not a cross-cultural definition. Such usage is described by M. F. C. Bourdillon, in his 'Introduction' to Bourdillon and M. Fortes (eds), Sacrifice (New York: Academic Press, 1980), 10, as follows: There are three meanings of the word 'sacrifice' in common English usage. The slaughter of an animal or person, or the surrender of a possession, in ritual; the destruction or surrender of something for the sake of something else, normally of higher value; and the Mass. In this paper I argue that aspects of the first two of these definitions are applicable for analysis of scientists' usage. 4. For a sampling of such studies, see: S. B.

I do not mean to suggest here that pet owners are necessarily more 'humane' in their treatment of their charges than are laboratory scientists. As Yi-Fu Tuan argues, in his Dominance and Affection: The Making of Pets (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1984), the status of pets is an ambiguous one in most human societies; pets are property to be dominated or exploited at the whim of the owner, as well as occasional objects of affection. On the other hand, as numerous laboratory scientists have told me, scientists often become 'attached' to their lab animals, and do not at all times treat them as insensate objects. The distinction between 'naturalistic' and 'analytic' animals is therefore a distinction between different modes of apprehension, both of which take place under different circumstances in scientific work.

As an anonymous reviewer of this paper noted: A comparison might usefully be made between this and the conversion of people to patients (or of patients to cases), although in that instance it is transportation with the possibility of return, not irreversible transformation. Indeed, many such comparisons can be made. For instance, in a previous paper (M. Lynch, 'Turning Up Signs in Neurobehavioral Diagnosis', Symbolic Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 1 [1984], 67-86), I describe how neurologists use a 'mental status exam' to engage patients in an interactive structure that utilizes ordinary conversation as a condition for extracting and framing patient responses as 'signs' of their mental competency. Similarly, interaction with an ordinary and responsive beast is used to transform the animal into an icon abstracted from the immediate situation. On the matter of reversibility, subjects of mental status exams sometimes find, to their misfortune, that their status as, for example, a victim of Alzheimer's disease, carries with it an irreversible fate. On the other hand, on rare occasions, animal subjects are returned to the status of 'pets', or even 'wild' animals (not without difficulty, as in the case of chimpanzee subjects of language experiments released into the 'wild'). Laboratory scientists sometimes rescue animal subjects and adopt them as pets. In one case, a neurologist adopted a cat after having cleanly 'scooped out' (in his words) half of the animal's brains. He claimed that the cat behaved as a perfectly normal pet. In another</page><page sequence="22">286 Social Studies of Science case, a scientist mentioned to me that he sometimes released mice, left over after experiments, into a wooded area near the laboratory. He doubted whether these white mice survived for very long. The rats described in this paper enjoyed no such fate, as their deaths were an integral phase of the experiment. 18.

Woolgar (eds), 'Special Issue on Representation in Science', Human Studies, Vol. 11 (1988), in press. 24. According to de Heusch (op. cit. note 3, 214), a general theme in sacrifice is the selection of victims according to rigorous standards: In all the societies we have examined, the victim is never just any animal, Aside from a determination of a species or sub-species, subtle criteria often play a role in the individual selection. In any case, the possibility of substituting one animal for another (indeed, a vegetable species for an animal species) operates within strict limits. 25. The analogy between the guillotine as a sacrificial instrument, and its use as a method of capital punishment, can be taken further. Michel Foucault notes, in his Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, trans A. Sheridan (New York: Random House, 1979), 13, how post-Enlightenment techniques of execution aimed to reduce the moment of death to a 'mathematical' point, so that the corporeal aspect of execution was minimized in the face of the elimination of the legal subject. Similarly, in laboratory sacrifice, the analytic subject is what is at issue, and the death of the animal is arranged primarily in reference to the abstracted 'data' that become accountable by means of that death. In both cases, the procedure is organized in reciprocal relation to an abstracted literary subject, while the sensual spectacle of a dying body becomes an incidental matter. H. Hubert and M. Mauss, in Sacrifice: Its Nature and Function (Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press, 1964, originally published 1898), also emphasize in their account of ritual sacrifice how the minimization of death's duration is associated with the purity of the result: So serious an operation could not be accompanied by too many precautions. For the most part it was wished that death should be prompt, and the passage of the victim from its earthly life to its divine one was hastened so as not to leave evil influences time to vitiate the sacrificial act. (34)</page><page sequence="23">Lynch: Sacrifice of Animals in Laboratory Culture 287 26. By calling 'sacrifice' a 'naturally occurring metaphor', I mean simply that it is explicitly used by laboratory scientists, as a term drawn from another field, to identify a phase of their own practices. It did not require an imaginative social science analysis to establish the initial relevance of the concept of 'sacrifice' to laboratory practice. To my knowledge, scientists have not gone very far toward specifying just how the practice they call 'sacrifice' resembles religious ritual (although I was told of an apparently humorous article in a biomedical journal, which I have been unable to locate, which played on the ritual connotations of the metaphor). See also note 27, below, in this regard. In order to elaborate and extend the metaphor, I have consulted social science writings on sacrifice. Again, I do not aim here to claim that laboratory 'sacrifice' exactly fits a cross-cultural model of sacrifice; rather, my intention is to use themes drawn from the literature as a hermeneutic resource for teasing out non-obvious aspects of the laboratory practices witnessed in my research. 27. Lab practitioners sometimes embellish, if only in a semi-humorous fashion, the religious connotations of their sacrificial practice. For instance, a researcher who experi- mented with mice told of how members of his lab designated an area where sacrifices were performed as 'the wailing wall'. This biologist, like others with whom I have discussed my interest in 'sacrifice', exhibited an avid interest in the topic, and tried to impress upon me that he and his colleagues were empathetic and compassionate about their laboratory creatures. 28. As noted above (note 3), de Heusch argues that Durkheim's dictotomy of the 'sacred' and 'profane' derives from Christian metaphysics, and has little relevance to non-Western ritual. While such criticism may be apt, it remains the case that any understanding of what sacrifice' might be for the scientists described here occurs within the Westem metaphysical tradition expressed, in overgeneralized terms, in Durkheim's and Hubert &amp; Mauss's naturalistic theorizing. If we treat Hubert &amp; Mauss's scheme of sacrifice as a members' explication, however ethnocentric, and not as a cross-culturally valid model, it may help us to find and articulate themes which are not expressed so explicitly by, for instance, laboratory technicians. The question then becomes: how much resonance with the tradition can be found in scientists' sacrificial practice? Are they using a metaphor in a shallow way, or is there more to it? 29.

Bourdillon, op. cit. note 3, 17, remarks that there may be no general scheme of sacrifice that holds cross-culturally: I suggest that each theory brings out the prominent theme in a particular type of sacrifice, and that the variety of theories presented in the literature derives from the variety of sacrifices performed in different cultures and in different situations. 34. M. Heidegger, What is a Thing? (Chicago, IL: Henry Regnery, 1967), 69-80. In this paper, I have only suggested a thematic resemblance between 'sacred' and 'mathematical' (Galilean) universes, and I have not speculated on any historical or philosophical origins of any such connection. R. Wagner, in his Symbols that Stand for Themselves (Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press, 1986), Chapter 6, develops a structural framework for describing a transformation between the human-divine linkage through the medium</page><page sequence="24">288 Social Studies of Science of the eucharist, rooted in early Judeo-Christian tradition, and the society-nature couple mediated by the symbol, characteristic of American culture. The materials I have discussed in this paper, however, provide no basis for evaluating the adequacy or applicability of Wagner's scheme. 35. The careful insertion of the animal's body into an abstract system of coordinates is emphasized in a number of descriptions of sacrificial ritual. For instance, Hubert &amp; Mauss (op. cit. note 25, 25) state: For the sacrifice proper to begin, it is not enough for the sacrifier and the priest to be sanctified. It cannot take place at any time or anywhere. Additionally, exact sequences are followed, and in some instances 'the killing of an animal and its ritual cooking establish a division of space just as much as they do a communication' (de Heusch, op. cit. note 3, 207). 36. The idea of marking laboratory animals has to do with keeping track of individual 'data points' in a cohort. While this is clearly far removed from any religious consecration of the animal, it does identify the animal's body with the various graphic and analytical operations to be performed on its residues. E. Evans-Pritchard, in his Nuer Religion (London: Oxford University Press, 1956), Chapter 8, describes how the Nuer consecrate an ox by rubbing ashes from the family byre on the animal's back when preparing it for sacrifice. Such identification between human and animal victim, of course, provides a far more intimate linkage than an inscription of a number on a rat's tail. But the number does prepare the animal for analytic use, and it does identify the animal with the form of life in which its remains will be incorporated. 37. Wieder, op. cit. note 11. 38. According to Koestler's account of the controversies surrounding Kammerer's ill- fated experiments with the midwife toad, the experiments were not replicated because other experimenters were unable to maintain a surviving population of toads across several generations and under unusual experimental conditions. Kammerer's claims were either fraudulent or based upon an irreproducible 'knack' with his toads. See A. Koestler, The Case of the Midwife Toad (New York: Random House, 1971). While Kammerer's case is hardly typical in many respects, the problem of maintaining a stock of experimental animals, and getting them to 'perform' appropriately in experiments is often solved through a body of skills which do not show up in research reports and methods texts: see Wieder, op. cit. note 11. Such skills are an instance of a more general phenomenon of 'bricolage expertise' in laboratory experimentation: Garfinkel et al., op. cit. note 4, 133, redefine Levi-Strauss's term to make it relevant to scientific practice: see C. Levi-Strauss, 7he Savage Mind (Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press, 1968). 39. The relation between naturalistic and analytic understandings of animals is not simply a matter of the suppression of the former via the latter. Wieder (op. cit. note 11) and a number of studies cited above (notes 4 and 22) emphasize how the canons of laboratory procedure and of published discourse require a systematic elision of the informal activities and understand- ings which enable experiments to be set up and accomplished. But, since such activities and understandings are absolutely necessary for getting experiments to work (or, in this case, getting animals to behave as proper subjects), and for reproducing experimental actions from written lab reports, they are not simply put aside once experiments begin. They make up what Garfinkel has called a 'vulgar competence' with laboratory procedures. Accordingly, it would be impossible to understand the analytic animal without tracing its features back through the constitutive horizon of practices linking it with the ordinary rat.</page><page sequence="25">Lynch: Sacrifice of Animals in Laboratory Culture 289 40. Daniel Rochowiak (personal communication) informed me that professional breeders of experimental animals are faced with the problem that their efforts to domesticate standardized specimens often result in complaints by experimenters that the animals are inbred, fragile, literally crazy, and not representative of 'real' animals. The demand, it seems, is for them to produce docile subjects which nevertheless retain a modicum of 'wildness'. 41. Practitioners endeavoured not only to protect themselves from the animal's struggle: they worked to minimize the spectacle of death. In one instance, a researcher recoiled and was visibly shaken when, in the course of using a new guillotine for the first time, she fumbled the job and the wounded rat let out a piercing squeal. 42. While humans have always managed to put aside their empathetic attachments and attributions to animals when it suits them to kill and eat their domesticated 'pets', even the process of slaughtering the animals retains a degree of subjective interrelation. In Giedion's example of the industrial slaughterhouse (op. cit. note 19, 231), the initial slaughtering of the pig is achieved through a 'ruse' used to induce the animals to enter the walkway leading them to their deaths. A 'Judas pig' is positioned on the opposite end of a gangway, and the pigs march, single file, toward this decoy. An automatic device then catches them by their rear legs and hauls them up on the overhead rails where their throats are slashed and their bodies are analytically dismembered into various cuts of meat. The 'ruse' points to an 'encounter' with the pigs, one that treats them, however minimally, as subjective beings to be tricked by a fraudulent device that acts as a condition for their objectification. Similarly, in the preparation for its 'sacrifice', the rat is 'conned' into submission when its senses and defensive reactions are disoriented or deflected in crafty ways. In this case, a precondition of the operation is that the animal be rendered into a deeply docile subject; docile, not simply in the ordinary sense, but as a ready yielder of data. The rat's body is not simply turned into a limp version of the living thing. Selected structures and processes are prepared for exposure, such as through the injection of the perfusate into the vascular system. 43. See W.
