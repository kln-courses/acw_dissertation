<plain_text><page sequence="1">Krzysztof Piotr Skowronski American Heritage as a Source of Values Introduction More often than not George Santayana was very critical of America; he had reservations about American democracy, a disputation over American pragmatism, some warnings against commercialization and the uniformization of social life in the US, and many other issues. Many of his judgments have been appreciatively taken on by some commentators, others have been flatly rejected by his philosophical opponents.1 Predominantly, however, the tone of his output is claimed to be the one of negativity and opposition. Characteristically, Robert Dawidoff, in his interesting book entitled The Genteel Tradition and the Sacred Rage: High Culture vs. Democracy in Adams, James, and Santayana^ puts forward the opinion that Santayana's "own writing suffers from his incapacity for glorious assertion."2 Without being polemical to this at all, I should like to look, in the present paper, at Santayana's America from a positive viewpoint and also a constructive one, that is to say, from the perspective of acceptance rather than refutation, from the point of view of her intellectual fecundity rather than her limitations, of her axiological diversity instead of standarization, and of her moral resourcefulness rather than barrenness. What I want to show is that, besides his criticism of America - so copiously commented by Santayana scholars on various occasions - , he did not fail to see the variety of the concepts of values that somehow materialized, or took shape, in the course of American history. In the present paper I have endeavored to look at the fertility of American heritage, as presented in Santayana's books and papers, in the light of a typology of values approach, one that was recognized by Santayana. At the beginning, I am going to propose a typology of values that can, in my assessment, be applied to value inquiries at large and, next, I use it as a map or a theoretical pattern to distinguish those strands of American heritage that can be seen as axiologically distinct and specific.3 I am using Santayana's texts on America here for different reasons; first, he was a shrewd and influential Americanist - "the genteel tradition" being amongst the terms coined by him and introduced into the cultural consciousness of Americans. Second, he paid Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society Spring, 2005, Vol. XLI, No. 2</page><page sequence="2">368 Krzysztof Piotr Skowroñski special attention to the significance of the clash of values in the process of shaping America's intellectual history. Third, he understood the huge role of tradition as a source of values, norms, and standards for the life of each and every American in particular, as well as for the life of each and every human being in general. Fourth, it is according to his philosophy that, although there is room for just a few hierarchies of values to be actualized and cultivated in the realm of matter - it is very many of them, if taken ideally, with their beauties and moral truths, that deserve at least some attention and appreciation: we may sometimes wish that all beauties had but one form, that we might behold them together. But in the nature of things beauties are incompatible. The spring cannot coexist with the autumn, nor day with night; what is beautiful in a child is hideous in a man, and vice versa; every age, every country, each sex, has a peculiar beauty, finite and incommunicable; the better it is attained the more completely it excludes every other. The same is evidently true of schools of art, of styles and languages, and of every effect whatsoever. It exists by its finitude and is great in proportion to its determination.4 Let me just add to clarify my intentions that I want to avoid a discussion on Santayana's own philosophy of values, nor do I want to compare him to other thinkers; such a discussion is important but deserves a separate paper, one devoted to the specific distinctions and categories made by him, as well as with reference to the eloquent elaborations on this topic.5 Rather, I want to focus upon the picture of American heritage that can be found in the pages of his works on America, with its richness, pluralism, and resourcefulness as regards values. Axiological Perspective To make my exposition clearer, let me sketch a theoretical framework or an axiological perspective within which I place values and classify them. Since there are very many types of understanding of what values are, depending on the given concept, I shall define, for the purpose of the present paper and very roughly indeed, the notion of value as an object or a state of affairs that is needed, wanted, and/or appreciated by an agent or a group of agents. Some of these relations - i.e. between the object (state of affairs) on the one hand, and the agent on the other - may have a constant and an objective character, like in the case of love, which is valuable not absolutely, i.e. taken in itself, but rather objectively, i.e. constantly and irrespective of anyone's will or opinions.</page><page sequence="3">American Heritage as a Source of Values 369 I also understand that good and beauty are modes of value and that the meaning of the term "value" embraces both the meaning of the term "good" and the meaning of the term "beauty". Being fully aware of many typologies of values I should like to propose another one,6 for the reasons given below, without, however, any pretense to make it wholly-embracing, definitive, and final. Theocentric philosophers (e.g. Dionysius the Aeropagite, Augustine of Hippo, Thomists, Puritans, Nicolai Berdyaev, Edgar Brightman, Thomas Merton, John Paul II) put God as the ultimate source and measurer of values; it is according to His absolute criteria, handed down to us in the form of the holy scriptures, that something is good or bad. Augustine of Hippo, perhaps the foremost representative of this position in Western thought states, for example, that "the friendship of this world is fornication against Thee ( The Confessions, I, 13)," meaning that all the deeds and thoughts should be directed toward God and any deviation from this way equals turning one's back on The Lord. A total devotion to the religious principles is not, then, fanaticism, but rather a conscientious realization of the divine requirements. Axiologically, God is the embodiment of all the perfections and there exists nothing more valuable; therefore, deontologically, everyone should follow the way shown by Him and follow His precepts, if only possible. It could be presumed, that it is sainthood that would be the ideal status to be aimed at and pilgrimage a metaphor for an attractive way of living one's earthly life. Anthropocentric thinkers (e.g. the Sophists, Epicureans, Renaissance humanists, Encyclopaedists, utilitarians, positivista, pragmatists) place the human being at the center of the world of values and consider the human lot as the axis of the course of history.7 It is the human good - taken collectively (e.g. community, nation, state) or individually (citizen, person) - that is the ultimate justification for given actions and the basis for any sorts of hierarchy of values. According to Protagoras, the first exponent of this position, "Man is the measure of all things" and it is Man that decides what is good or bad, right or wrong, and what should be done or not done. According to John Dewey, one of the latest representatives of this tendency, it is the world of human experience that really counts and it is the welfare of the community of human beings that is the purpose of moral amendments, social melioration, and technological advancement. It should be added that the most explicit models for the moral stance that may be proposed in anthropocentrism are those of pioneer and expert, the former stands for devotion to discovering new lands and inventing new devices, and the latter for professionalism and skillfulness in making the world a better place to live in for us human beings. Since John Dewey is a central figure in American culture8 I would like to clarify my intention by placing him in anthropocentrism, although I understand the possible doubts about such a taxonomy, especially in the US. However, if we put Dewey's Theory of Valuation next to, for example, Hindu's</page><page sequence="4">370 Krzysztof Piotr Skowroñski Bhagavad-Gita we shall see that these two can illustrate anthropocentric and non-anthropocentric approach quite distinctly. The former clearly states that the problem of valuation refers to "human activities and human relations", that the value-expressions have to deal with the "relations of persons to one another", and that valuation-phenomena "are social or interpersonal."9 Naturally, it does not mean that the axiological equipment, sensitivity to values, and the idea of making life noble are absent here; it means, however, that Dewey rejects placing Man somewhere in the background of the moral cosmos, refuses to treat the problems of the human community as secondary in relation to something else, and repudiates such claims where society is inferior, in its meaning, to something out of it. It is just the opposite in the latter. In the non-anthropocentric systems of Hindu philosophy, those taking inspiration also from Bhagavad-Gita, it is man that is a part in the chain of existence {karmamarga) on equal terms with other animals, and sometimes even plants and demons, which is known in the West as reincarnation of transmigration of souls (karmasansara)™ and he is just a background against the non-personal Being (Atman-Brahman). The orientation to self-interested motives as well as actions aiming at a betterment of social life are almost to be deplored (swadharma)11 and actually man's attempts should go in the direction of getting out of both the social life, e.g. by means of asceticism, isolation, and meditation (yoga), and, next, dissolving oneself ontologically in the Being, in order to reach annihilation (Nirvana) - all this being justified by man's axiological misery and his ontological derivativeness. In other words, man's existence and destiny is perceived by means of the cosmic harmony not by means of a social life. One may, of course, interpret this by saying that the Hindus are anthropocentric in a unique or clumsy way, but it is an external interpretation, which I would not like to follow at this time. Also, if we compare Dewey's position to other, i.e. Western, non- anthropocentric positions, like some of those to be described below, the main criterion could be the assessment of human life; I do not think Dewey was ready to follow the late Stoics or Elzenberg in their reiterations that human life, as such, is without moral worth or it is axiologically neutral, that is, neither good or bad, unless some additional requirements or positive conditions have been fulfilled or realized.12 Let me say a little more about this. The representatives of axiocentrism13 - which was initiated by the Hindu philosophers in the East and the Late Stoics in the West, and which was theoretically elaborated, in various ways, by Lord Shaftesbury, Rudolf Hermann Lotze, the Baden Neo-Kantians, Nicolai Hartmann, and, especially, Henryk Elzenberg - see the very values as the pivots for moral orientation. It is, then, neither extra-mundane consequences (heaven and hell) nor some earthly interests (social, political) that count mostly in the moral action but rather the realization of things and/or the valuable states of affairs. As Seneca puts it in his Epistles (LXXI, 33), there are values that are precious and there</page><page sequence="5">American Heritage as a Source of Values 371 are values that have dignitas - it is by means of the realization of the latter, rather than the former, that human life gets filled with a noble substance. Human life, let me repeat, itself without any special worth, becomes a task to be performed and, depending on the fineness of the realized objectives (or at least a willingness to realize them), it can become valuable, decent, and significant or just the opposite: meager, meaningless, and trifling. The status that a follower of axiocentrism wants to achieve is of a sage rather than a saint or a pioneer, and it is wisdom that, if anything, s/he wants to possess. In my assessment, this typology of values, although not fully satisfactory for everyone, can be helpful at least in understanding the type of ultimate vindications that have been made at various occasions in philosophy and outside of it. A strict division of these positions is neither possible nor necessary. It is not possible because these are ideal types - with ample space for variations both within each type and between them - that can be more or less fully embodied in any actual philosophy. It is not necessary because this division, like many others, should serve some orientation in the area of the philosophy of values rather than a strict classification of the systems of thought. Nor does it mean that a given type should dovetail with a particular system of thought. For instance, if we take a closer look at the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson, we might come to the conclusion that all three strands could be found there; some scholars, then, may put emphasis upon his theological (Unitarian) deliberations, others upon his anthropocentrism (with his concept of self-reliance) , still others upon axiocentric elements (present especially in his "Nature ^ Likewise, George Santayana can be, and is read as a Catholic thinker ( The Idea of Christ in the Gospels), as a pragmatic humanist ( The Life of Reason), and as a Neo-Platonic spiritualist who devotes himself to the highest values: the good, beauty, and truth {Realms of Being). Indeed, the main protagonist of his The Last Puritan alone, Oliver, can be read as a character embracing, wrestling or dealing with - with various intensity - all these three threads.14 In my opinion Santayana's writings on America recognize the proposed taxonomy, although not in a formal, theoretical, systematic, or a fully developed way. Let me focus on the two strands of the above typology first. Santayana recognizes the sharp division into theocentric and anthropocentric (he also uses the term: humanistic) approaches, one which he paraphrases very succinctly indeed: In the Old Testament and even in the New there were humanistic maxims, such as that the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.15 He seems to understand very well that while anthropocentrism puts humans (with their needs and desires) at the top of the hierarchy of values, the</page><page sequence="6">3 72 Krzysztof Piotr Skowroñski theocratic thinkers put something else over humans, something which people should, in their moral deeds and aspirations, be dedicated to, just because of its priority. For a religious person any norm, standard, or obligation originating from The Lord's precepts should be fulfilled without any qualifications, irrespective of the current prejudices of public opinion, or even in spite of them, and, moreover, even if "damnation for the Glory of God" has to be faced. The Old Testament Abraham, asked by God to kill his son, is a tragic but very clear illustration of the clash of these two approaches; Abraham was ready to devote his son's life not because he was essentially cruel, morally evil, or antihuman but rather because he was asked to do so by God - this being the ultimate moral justification. The New Testament rich man was to give away all his riches to follow Jesus in order to obtain moral perfection on earth and salvation in heaven. In both cases, it is not personal comfort, happiness, and prosperity but rather the realization of the duties that result from the fact that something ordered by God should be done, even if not understood by human reason or liked by human senses. Santayana writes on the followers of the theocentric16 types of thinking as follows: Wealth, learning, sport, and beneficence, even on a grand scale, must leave them cold, or positively alarm them, if these fine things are not tightly controlled and meted out according to some revealed absolute standard. Culture won't do, they must say, unless it be the one right culture: learning won't do, unless it fills out the one true philosophy (GTBy p. 16). Axiocentrism, in turn, is a term never used by Santayana. However, while using such notions as "natural idealism" (e.g. in "Materialism and Idealism in American Life"), "philosophical supernaturalism" (e.g. in The Genteel Tradition at Bay), and "non-humanistic naturalism"17 - all obviously different from axiocentrism - he refers to axiocentrism's crucial points. First of all, it is the rejection of both the theocentric and anthropocentric perspectives in searching for the values somewhere in the world in which neither a deity nor the human species occupy the central or privileged position, yet in a world that embraces both the good and the beauty. This position is incompatible with the theocratic one because it does not refer either to (a personal) God or any dogma written in any sacred book. Also, there is an unbridgeable gap between axiocentric and anthropocentric options because here the criteria of human good (happiness, comfort, safety, prosperity) is no longer obligatory, primary, or exclusive. Santayana refers here to the Greek naturalists, who "sketched naturalistic (and therefore inhuman) systems of the universe"18 and, on the other, to the Indian, (Neo)Platonic, and Christian traditions, which conceive the cosmos to be the most worthy place in which "the inexplicable burdens</page><page sequence="7">American Heritage as a Source of Values 373 and tantalising glories of this life find their origin and their fulfilment (GTB, p. 21)". It is within such a world that the eternal objects, forms, essences, or qualities have no other servitude, that is, they are not used by agents to anything else. Here, the agent's sphere of action has two aspects; first, it is the contemplation of them for their own sake: our souls are native to a spiritual world, form which we fetch our standards of truth and beauty, and in which alone we can be happy. (GTBy p. 21) Second, it is the disinterested realization of the fine (that is the value-laden) and reaching excellence, perfection, nobleness, and completeness: the perfection of action, dominating matter, realises the good and the beautiful at every stage.19 Let me take a closer look at these three strands and their practical functioning in the American heritage, as it was shown by Santayana in his works dedicated to the American matters. The Genteel Tradition as a Source of Values Now, I would like to follow the track of Santayana 's view that treats the genteel tradition as a descriptive rather than an abusive term,20 one indicating a possible resourcefulness rather than aridity and limitations. According to what has been said in the introduction above, I would like to omit the places where the grotesqueness of genteel images is evoked21 and where the falseness of the principles of gentility focused22 and, instead, to pay attention to its spiritual ambitions, its metaphysical passion, as well as to its vision of human destiny and a total view of the universe.23 1 take for granted that the genteel tradition, discussed by Santayana mainly in "The Genteel Tradition in American Philosophy" (1911) and The Genteel Tradition at Bay (1931), can be seen as one representing theocentrism in America. It refers to the strand of American tradition that was imported by the Puritans from Europe and which spread and prevailed, especially in New England, in the 18th and 19th centuries. Although just planted in new soil, it had long been established and stiffened elsewhere, which is the reason why the intellectual and spiritual America was not newborn nor innocent at that time, but rather she was "a young country with an old mentality (WD, p. 187)." Although the genteel tradition was "not essentially humanistic at all, but theocratic (GTB, p. 16)" its impact had not only strictly or predominantly a religious character; nor was it constrained to theology, to a definite denomination (especially to Calvinism) or to the works of particular thinkers (like Jonathan Edwards). Instead, it stretched vastly onto a much wider area, where it exerted its immense force by means of which the implementation of "a distinct vision of the universe and definite convictions</page><page sequence="8">3 74 Krzysztof Piotr Skowroñski about human destiny ( WD, p. 187)" took place among Americans at large. It was the spirit or the intellectual atmosphere rather than a set of principles to be followed and cultivated. Its essence, however, consisted of two things; first, it had a deep sense of sin and of the agonized conscience amongst its followers. The other was a systematic subjective conviction about one's moral Tightness, especially in its hypersensitivity to evil and the fight against it. Both gave a sense of autonomy, self-trust, and a moral rigor. Briefly put, it gave shape to the ethical principles in particular and it has had an enormous role in creation of the moral climate in the United States in general: moral integrity and its shadow, moral absolutism, were always a chief part of the genteel tradition in America. (GTB.p. 18) The genteel tradition became, in its deepest meaning, a source for moral standards because it established the fundamental convictions about the hierarchy of values and the ways of justifying them; the moral cosmos, as well as a definite place for human life, were clearly articulated and strongly defended. It, thus, became a most profound point of reference, a most telling signpost that showed where absolute good could be found, how evil should be avoided, and it was seen to have been the ultimate background against which moral distinctions were made and unhesitatingly endeavored for. It supplied, for a moral life, the basic substance about which there could be no further discussion held, nor a more profound debate expected, because its principles were obvious; moral earnestness and rectitude were diffused among Americans and gentility became one of the most solid factors in their mentality and an indelible ingredient of Americanism in the years to come. America seen as the chosen land for the chosen people whose religious exceptionism and moral superiority were self-evident - all this was incessantly vindicated by speculation and unceasingly confirmed by the practice of everyday life. Gentility could confer on human life more meaning and make it a strictly defined route with a definite end. It contained asceticism, simplicity, elevated sense of life, and a sense of mission as well as "beautiful austerity", melancholic stoutness, lonely allegiance to the given principles against all odds, distinction as a way of moral existence, and reservations about the significance of the achievements of technological civilization. Although such a stance may now be widely associated with fanaticism and hypocrisy, it is, firstly, judged in such a pejorative way, according to external standards (i.e. non-religious, non- theological, and non-genteel); second, such assessments ignore the essence of gentility itself and focus on its extremities, exactly in the same way as some Westerners today reduce Islam to fanaticism or terrorism. However, for those who wanted to devote themselves to the ideas of gentility, there awaited a vision of a serious, metaphysical approach toward life, including the</page><page sequence="9">American Heritage as a Source of Values 375 abandonment of unnecessary trifles, and cheap imitations that are so inevitable for those people who are submerged in a quite different tradition, for example, in one that deals with a consumer orientated, rushing about money-mad existence. One may think of pilgrimage as a metaphor for the attitude towards the earthly life in theocentrism. A pilgrim assumes a priori the holiness of some places and the sainthood of the patrons; moreover, s/he devotes his or her life to cherishing them and in following the moral path that has been marked out and trodden upon centuries before. The pilgrim is not, and does not want to be, an innovator because s/he sticks to what has long been seen as the plain truth which fills his/her mind and what constitutes his/her sense of life. Nor are there any mercantile reasons, business expectations, and political motives that should be decisive here. The successive sanctuaries to which the pilgrim is bound for, in reality or in his/her imagination, are the consecrated stations marking the progress of the inner man and confirming the ties with the heritage the pilgrim is firmly and genuinely dedicated to. The travails connected with the physical aspect of pilgrimage become the sacrifice s/he is happy to suffer in the name of the nobility of the way leading to a glorious destination, therefore any concerns about comfort while pressing on ought to be left somewhere behind. In principle, the genteel tradition had an exclusive, non-democratic, and absolutistic bias; the conviction about the rightness, and the divine consecration of this rightness, made it hard to confer the same rightness to other, incommensurable types of thinking, or to rival views of destiny. The moral stoutness of gentility, as of any theocentrism, lies in the firm belief, if not certitude, of its followers about its religious and moral exceptionism as well as finding themselves as specially selected and divinely appointed to perform the unique mission. The integrity comes from the conviction that one's divine vocation is absolutely right and consecrated by a living God. A relaxation of this moral firmness by means of admitting that there are other, equally right, equally justified, and equally noble ways of conduct would undermine this sense of exclusiveness and superiority and would make its sternness superfluous. At most a kind of tolerance could be had toward other orthodoxies or denominations that share the main idea of a complete devotion to God, although in a slightly different way. Atheism or anthropocentrism - both of which are factually hardly distinguishable for the theocentrists - is the very opposite end of the scale and does not deserve, in the conviction of at least some of them, any compassion, unless pity. The genteel tradition was at that time deeply absorbed in academic America and constituted a very strong element there. For example at Harvard, where Santayana spent two decades - first as a student and then as a teacher - the climate of the genteel tradition was still omnipresent. One of the members of Harvard Philosophy Department, George Herbert Palmer,</page><page sequence="10">376 Krzysztof Piotr Skowroñski admitted his intellectual predilections quite openly.24 What is more, the influence of the genteel way of thought was much stronger and much more penetrating, apparently even among those who declared their reservations about gentility. William James, for instance, seems to have followed a genteel- like split into the saved and the damned by means of a reverse opposition which he calls in his own philosophy "the healthy minded" and "the morbid", the division so essential in his Varieties of Religious Experience and elsewhere.25 Josiah Royce preoccupied himself with the problem of theodicy or the justification for the existence of evil in the world created by the omniscient and loving God.26 Although neither James nor Royce can be classified as the representatives of theocentrism, the elements of gentility lay deeply in both of them, and influenced their ways of approaching the problems of good and evil. If we keep in mind the fact that the Golden Age of Harvard Philosophy consisted of "the Great Five" (i.e. William James, Josiah Royce, George Herbert Palmer, George Santayana, and Hugo Münsterberg) and that two of them were not Americans (Santayana and Münsterberg), Santayana's suggestion about the enormous sway of gentility among the American philosophers, at least at this leading university in the US, seems fully justified: Philosophical opinion in America is of course rooted in the genteel tradition. It is either inspired by religious faith, and designed to defend it, or else it is created somewhat artificially in the larger universities, by deliberately proposing problems which, without being very pressing to most Americans, are supposed to be necessary problems of thought. ( CO C/5, p. 142) Whether pressing or not, the problem of the confrontation between the theocentric gentility and the profane life has been illustrated in Santayana's best selling book The Last Puritan: A Memoir in the Form of a Novel (1935). The characters were constructed by the author to present the situation in the then America, although the picture has a philosophical rather than a sociological or historical importance - these being outlined there. The main protagonist, Oliver - closely modeled on an authentic young Puritan27 - , is the last Puritan not chronologically, but rather logically and dynamically;28 he is not an ultimate and childless descendant of an old tradition, but rather someone who wants to use the moral and spiritual resourcefulness of his heritage to build a noble life for himself. His moral purity,29 and an authentic sense of duty to do "good" in the world are undeniable; his faith is a real, deep, and genuine conviction of his mind, and a necessity to his soul rather than an ornamental addition to his weekend preoccupations. He himself is looking for a worthy way of life within his living faith, without any devotion to some abstract dogmas or the arid cultivation of dead rituals; he is not</page><page sequence="11">American Heritage as a Source of Values 377 interested in imitating past standards or in a resurrection of a given doctrine out of the ashes, but rather in shaping a fine life for himself upon his faith. Oliver "was a spiritual man, with a divine vocation (IF, p. 8)", being even compared to Jesus Christ on three occasions; he was someone who "would have been a monk, if he had been a Catholic (77, p. 15)" during his lifetime, and someone who should have been a saint afterwards. However, despite his moral integrity, sensitivity, and intelligence, Oliver is not able to solve the everyday problems of life, the ones connected with personal comfort and pleasures as well as the ones connected with sociability, leadership, and of running a business. He was not in a position to do so not because of an underlying flaw in Puritanism, or any inherent defect, as might be presumed, but because Puritanism, in its essence, was not for solving everyday problems, at least in the modern and secular understanding of this word: making oneself live better and happier was not the primary aim there. Puritanism, as probably each theocentrism, meant following the way of salvation without solving earthly matters. Rather, these are, in my interpretation, two incommensurable spheres that cannot be judged or assessed one by the other. Tragic, however, are the attempts to reconcile these incompatible orders in our practical life; they are tragic because they are, as if a priori doomed to be abortive. These efforts, if serious, can signify an internal split and a schizophrenic attempt to deal with both of them. As Irving Singer puts it in the introduction to the book, "Oliver wants to live in accordance with natural impulses while also seeking a spiritual vocation that would detach him from the vicissitudes of mere existence. He cannot secure the best of both worlds, and he ends up living in neither (IV&gt; p. xxvi)". In vain Oliver was reminded by those who were aware of his hopeless trials that "Christ had not been a soldier or an athlete or a lover of women or a merchant or a statesman or even (...) a professor of philosophy or a believing Christian (IF, p. 9)". Although this is a predicament which Oliver finds it impossible to overcome, it does not have to mean that all his life is a failure; "unfitness for the everyday world", let me repeat, is a judgment made in accordance with the alien standards or external criteria, that is, anthropocentric, social, humanistic, utilitarian, and commercial, but not according to its own standards: theocentric, genteel, spiritual, mystic, and/or theological. According to the latter, death, material comfort, social recognition, sexual satisfaction, etc. are marginalized in favor of unflinchingly keeping to the path leading to salvation, as well as in favor of a stern cultivation of the moral and spiritual tradition that embraces this glorious destination. From this point of view, as the author of the novel emphasizes himself, Oliver's failures result from his moral superiority, not inferiority, from his spiritual uniqueness not commonness, from the purity of his character not from its contamination. From this viewpoint, he wa worthy man, not a loser, and in one of Santayana's letters his sympathy with the Last Puritan's attitude toward life was admitted very openly:</page><page sequence="12">378 Krzysztof Piotr Skowronski I, too, admire and almost envy Oliver, in spite of people thinking him a failure. (...) I think he was superior to his world, but not up to his own standard. To be perfect and heroic, he ought to have been more independent. But he was tethered, and hadn't the strength or courage to break away completely. He hadn't the intelligence to see clearly what he should break away to.30 Nevertheless, Oliver, due to this duplicity in his moral orientation fails to actualize fully all his spiritual potentialities. He also fails to devote himself completely and unreservedly to his genuine vocation, despite his spiritual aspirations, moral fiber, and intellectual equipment. At the end of the book he faces a tragically sad reflection and the reader is given, at least in my opinion, a hint of the incommensurability of the two strands and a lesson about tolerance. The spirit, charm, beauty, and attraction of the theocratic traditions - whether genteel, mystic, monastic, or ecclesiastical - are unapproachable and unattainable to the outsiders that are unable to penetrate into the intricacies, history, subtleties, rules, and developments of these traditions. In the novel, Oliver's cousin and bosom friend, Mario Van de Weyer - who is a "natural man", a follower, as I see it, of the anthropocentric and utilitarian approach - is not in a position to understand Oliver or fathom the depths of his heritage. On the other hand, Mario's easiness in dealing with social matters, his quick decision-making, his hedonism, and his extraordinary mobility are hardly understood by Oliver, who has to confront Mario's world and the values that function in it: "[i]f you are a man you must be ready to fight every other man and to make love to every pretty woman (/F, p. 501)." The separation of these two orders makes them essentially alien and inaccessible to each another, and this is, in my assessment, one of the deepest messages of the book. According to Santayana, the genteel tradition receded in the United States not because of its intellectual weakness, its rigidity, and substantial falseness, but rather because of the speculative shallowness of its followers. In his opinion, it is a peculiarity of the modern American scene that "ideas are abandoned in virtue of a mere change of feeling, without any new evidence or new arguments. We do not nowadays refute our predecessors, we pleasantly bid them good-bye (COUS, p. 9)."31 There were, Santayana claims, some ephemeral revivals of the genteel tradition, like New Humanism movement in the 1920s and 1930s,32 but the emergence of the more dynamic masses with a new mentality and new aims, made the genteel tradition submerge; the confrontation between these being, however, evident and long lasting. Their separate characters and, simultaneously, their huge importance in America's life was tersely presented by Santayana's oft-quoted simile:</page><page sequence="13">American Heritage as a Source of Values 379 This division may be found symbolised in American architecture: a neat reproduction of the colonial mansion - with some modern comforts introduced surreptitiously - stands beside the sky-scraper. The American Will inhabits the sky-scraper; the American Intellect inhabits the colonial mansion. The one is the sphere of the American man; the other, at least predominantly, of the American woman. The one is all aggressive enterprise; the other is all genteel tradition. (WD,p. 188) CCA Crude but Vital America" as a Source of Values When Santayana came to the United States in 1872 he witnessed the passage from the old, genteel Boston to the new, industrial one, which was accompanied by the metamorphosis in the world of values; now, the "great affair, the aristocratic path to success and power, was business (J, p. 67)". There emerged a new type of American with a new type of mentality - "the untrained, pushing, cosmopolitan orphan, cock-sure in manner but not too sure in his morality, to whom the old Yankee, with his sour integrity, is almost a foreigner (COUS, p. 14)". The spirit of free individuality, prosperity, and free cooperation to maximize prosperity, brought by the first settlers, and the struggle against the new frontiers as well as the new social and economic circumstances made it possible for a new reality to take place. The additional millions of immigrants, looking for money rather than salvation, helped a new vision of the world emerge and spread, one with a new interpretation of the natural and the supernatural: Was not "increase", in the Bible, a synonym of benefit? Was not "abundance" the same, or almost the same, as happiness? (COUS, p. 14) American mentality became completely anthropocentric and utilitarian; the human being was seen as placed in the center of the world of values and human interests as the pivot for moral orientation. All things around were seen from the point of view of their utility, and their usefulness in human affairs, became the ultimate criterion for the worth of these things. Such understanding of the world of values gave way to the moral justification of the unrestrained expansion of such tendencies that seek to maximize human earthly comforts and prosperity, and of which America is in the leading place (e.g. commercial liberalism, consumptionism, consumerism, utilitarianism, etc.). Although Santayana criticizes both these phenomena and anthropocentrism itself,33 there are many descriptive, as well as positive</page><page sequence="14">380 Krzysztof Piotr Skowronski elements, of "a crude but vital America (COUS, p. 140)" that can be found in his writings, and I would like to focus on them shortly. Let me just add, that since Santayana does not propose a concise name here, I have chosen one term of those he used, i.e. "a crude but vital America," because of its accuracy (in my assessment) and generality. This makes me leave behind the other terms, for example: "Big Business" ("Analyses of Modernity"), "aggressive enterprise" ("The Genteel Tradition in American Philosophy"), "mechanized democracy" ("Americanism"), "industrial liberalism (Dominations and Powers), and "money-mad America" - they all, however, deal with the anthropocentric vision of the world, because it is Man and his/her destiny that is the central and/or ultimate point of reference there. It is this crude but vital America that "has sprung up from the soil, undermining, feeding, and transforming the America of tradition (COUSy p. 140)." In the new circumstances of the expansive capitalism, the moral issues dramatically changed its substance; they became openly anthropocentric in their essence and visibly commercial, mercantile, and liberal in their forms. Religion - instead of being an original fountainhead of personal wisdom, the backbone of the social norms, and the absolute source of obligations to be followed by the believers, even at the cost of their material comforts - became ornamental, accidental, superficial, and recalled at the moments of personal crises or taken on when the moral justification of the new way was needed. The sense of sin and self- depravation, that had been so widespread and profound earlier, evaporated completely and "[i]f you told the modern American that he is totally depraved, he would think you were joking, as he himself usually is. He is convinced that he always has been, and always will be, victorious and blameless (WDy p. 191)". These two distinct strands, i.e. gentility on the one hand, and, on the other, crudeness and vitality, along with their separate values, priorities, purposes, and expectations, could hardly go together.34 Now, in the new social reality, it was freedom of almost everyone to choose one's own religion and to pick up one's own philosophy as it was one's freedom to choose a spouse, to settle in a country one likes, and to perform the job one prefers. A pluralism of choices within the newly established social order as well as the level of tolerance within the freshly emerged political system were extremely high; Every system was met with a frank gaze. "Come on," people seemed to say to it, "show us what you are good for. We accept no claims; we ask for no credentials; we just give you a chance. Plato, the Pope, and Mrs. Eddy shall have one vote each." (COUS&gt; p. 145) That God - or a Mighty Power habitually called by that name - created</page><page sequence="15">American Heritage as a Source of Values 381 the world for the benefit of Man became self-evident; a good criterion for the truthfulness and friendliness of religion was now how much a spiritual consolation and how much strong moral support you could get from it, rather than how big a sacrifice it required from you. It was the loving Christ rather than the suffering and crucified one that became a living symbol. The restrictiveness of religion became the sign of its morbidity, and that is an incompatibility with healthy-mindedness and common sense, and for this very reason some of its elements are to be rejected as well as seen as false and mad. Within a very short time, then, the notion of God underwent a metamorphosis in its meaning and now was applied to corroborate and to vindicate the human actions and ambitions within the realm of matter. Here, "[i]rreligion, dissoluteness, and pessimism - supposed naturally to go together - could never prosper: they were incompatible with efficiency. That was the supreme test (COÍ/5, p. 15)." The newly emerged religious groups (revivalism, Unitarianism, spiritualism, Christian Science, or the New Thought) seemed the effects of mere efforts in mental hygiene and essentially anthropocentric, that is, they placed God on a human level rather than on God's own. For example, according to William Ellery Channing, perhaps the most influential New England theologian of the day, the divinity of human nature was confirmed in liberal intellect, rectitude, kind affection, philanthropy, and achievement in science and art.35 Religion, then, was no longer an obstacle or a hindrance to the cult of success in a new meaning of this word, that is industrial advancement and technological development, one whose ultimate aim is to make earthly life easier and more comfortable. It is a career in this world rather than a destiny in the other that was cared about, the immediate was to be preoccupied with rather than the transcendent. Religion (with its duties) had been degraded into the function of servitude in the world of material action - material action becoming free to thrive and fueled by conviction in its worth, by optimism in favorable circumstances to come, and by hope in its necessity on the way to happiness. Also, the attitude toward the past became free from burdening restrictions, although it must not be taken to mean that the notion of heritage became obsolete and without any meaning at all. The traditions were left behind, "except precisely this tradition of experimental liberty, making money and losing it, making things to be thrown away, and being happy rather than ashamed of having always to begin afresh (/, p. 131)." That what had existed in the past was irrelevant and inferior unless it was helpful for a better future on earth and stimulating for the advances of material progress. The atmosphere of enterprise referred to the glorification of the sheer process rather than to the contemplation of a given state of affairs, to success in the current action rather than to a self-possessed meditation, to consumption rather than to renunciation, to self-reliance rather than to awaiting the divine help, to realism rather than to philosophical speculation, to joy rather than</page><page sequence="16">382 Krzysztof Piotr Skowroñski sadness, and to joking rather than solemnity. According to Santayana's own observations, an average modern American was enthusiastic and inquisitive but these features were restricted to the area of the calculable progress - other areas being seemingly neglected or ignored. Idealism in America consecrates animation, curiosity, and stamina; however, it becomes "nothing if not helpful, nothing if not pertinent to practicable transformations (COC75, p. 178)." American individualism, however cherished and appreciated, tends to be cooperative but it is only in the mercantile meaning of this term; the model of the communal life it refers to has nothing to do with, for example, monastic simplicity, but rather with supermarket ostentatiousness, where it is welfare and comfort that are to be highlighted rather than anything else. If we accept that an adequate metaphor for the life line exposed within the genteel tradition is pilgrim, the metaphor for the life within crude but vital America, can be associated with pioneer. The pioneer is not someone who observes the prescribed way to follow but s/he imposes her/his own rules and takes her/his own course at his/her own risk. There is no predictability that, on having accomplished a certain goal, an enduring blissfulness will be guaranteed and salvation reached. S/he seems to be more responsible for positing her/his own excellences and obeying his own standards rather than searching for consolation in heaven and fearing the heat of hellfire. His/her heroic efforts deal with provisional elements of the empirical world rather than with spiritual subtleties or theological dogmas. His/her sight is directed horizontally and onwards rather than vertically and upwards (heaven-wards), as the pilgrim's is. It is s/he who is willing to change the wilderness into a more comfortable place to live, and to invent new ideas to facilitate prosperity. It is the experience to cope with crude reality and to explore its resources for his benefit that s/he wants to immerse in rather than to meditate on the greatness of God, or to contemplate the beauty of the universe. Similar features are represented, in Santayana's The Last Puritan, by the other protagonist, Mario Van Der Wayer, who is Oliver's best friend and his philosophical adversary. Mario's vividness, joyfulness, practicality, optimism, worldliness, and his way of looking into the future rather than back to the past, are accompanied by his lack of profound self-reflection, his carefree indifference, and hardly any sensitivity to the wealth of traditional duties to be performed. All this somehow conditions and facilitates his unscrupulous judgments, his ignorance of the intricacies of high culture, and, to Oliver's astonishment, makes Mario all the more attractive to the people who happen to be around. Mario, in the "real life", is successful both in love and business, without paying any attention to the various types of moral principles which were indispensable to Oliver. It does not mean that Mario is repulsive and money-mad at all; he is honest, charming, nice, and well spoken of - things making Oliver pensive all the time on the complications and mysteries of social life. The author of The Last Puritan contrasts the hierarchy of values and a</page><page sequence="17">American Heritage as a Source of Values 383 type of approach toward life in both characters: People like Mario weren't looking for the truth or for the best life: they were merely playing the game. In that sense Mario was more American, more modern, than Oliver himself: or rather he was what men of the world had always been, brilliant slaves of their circumstances. (IF, p. 487) It is, however, in the hands of such people like Mario, as we read in the Epilogue (cf. IV, p. 570), that a future worth having should be relied upon, and hopefully should be successfully developed to the benefit of mankind. As in the prior epochs, science and philosophy had been at the service of theology, now, scientists and philosophers, especially in America, assumed - despite their avowals, if at all, about impartiality and objectivity - the anthropocentric type of thinking. Now, many philosophy professors "are no longer the sort of persons that might as well have been clergymen or schoolmasters; they have rather the type of mind of a doctor, an engineer, or a social reformer (COl/S, p. 142-143)." Here, ideals are seen as tools needed for a constant modification and rearrangement of the material conditions in human communities. An illustrious example of these tendencies was American pragmatism, which gave its theoretical justification and intellectual cogency to a human version of the universe and a cult of human experience - Santayana even goes so far as to join the voices that claim that American pragmatism was a philosophy "calculated to justify all the assumptions of American society."36 Such an opinion was for him vindicated because, according to the pragmatism he knew best (i.e. its Jamesean version): nature must be conceived anthropomorphically and in psychological terms. Its purposes are not to be static harmonies, self-unfolding destinies, the logic of spirit, the spirit of logic, or any other formal method and abstract law; its purposes are to be concrete endevours, finite efforts of souls living in an environment which they transform and by which they, too, are affected. A spirit, the divine spirit as much as the human, as this new animism conceives it, is a romantic adventurer. Its future is undetermined. Its scope, its duration, and the quality of its life are all contingent. This spirit grows; it buds and sends forth feelers, sounding the depths around for such other centers of force or life as may exist there. It has a vital momentum, but no predetermined goal. It uses its past as a stepping-</page><page sequence="18">384 Krzysztof Piotr Skowronski stone, or rather as a diving-board, but has an absolutely fresh will at each moment to plunge this way or that into the unknown. The universe is an experiment; it is unfinished. ( WD, pp. 207-208) Put more strongly, the American pragmatist became "a cell in that teeming democratic body; he draws from its warm, contagious activities the sanctions of his own life and, less consciously, the spirit of his philosophy (CO 175, p. 144)." Man, with his/her experience, became an absolute point of reference in the perception, and the assessment of the cosmos, and the needs, desires, and interests of human community - the ultimate justification of any action. Here, the knowledge of the world deserved its significance only when its objects and relations were in the service of human authority. In 1911 Santayana wrote that America is "a country with two mentalities, one a survival of the beliefs and standards of the fathers, the other an expression of the instincts, practice, and discoveries of the younger generations (WZ&gt;, p. 187-188)." In the 1930s, in a paper entitled "Americanism", he seemingly saw the country as one with predominantly one mentality and obviously one in which the values of the genteel tradition had been ousted by those of humanistic liberalism, commercial utilitarianism, and widespread democracy. As Paul Nagy observes, it "was not the genteel tradition but the crude and vital America (...) that spawned the democracy of experience and the concomitant experience of democracy."37 However, it was tolerance and democracy - as Santayana constantly emphasizes - to everything and anything that has no damaging influence upon the development of the society of consumers. Words, ideas, religions, opinions, protests, etc., if confined to being just the expression of people's convictions, even those strongly critical about the utilitarian and commercial type of civilization, have been free to be uttered because they have been disinfected from their venom, acuteness, as well as a potential danger to the stability of the predominant principles of the political system and from making chaos in the social order. There are plenty of sectarians in the United States, plenty of fanatics, propagandists, and dogmatists; but the American absorption in work - a work controlled and directed by the momentum and equilibrium of its total movement - causes all these theoretical passions to remain sporadic, private, harmless, and impotent. Their social effects cancel and disinfect one another; they count and modify the balance of action in so far as they are forms of business; in so far as they are definite ideas they evaporate in loud steam. (...) All that is not business is left free, because it is profoundly</page><page sequence="19">American Heritage as a Source of Values 385 indifferent - a safety-valve and holiday folly for those who like it. In America, where all else is precision and hurry, the very speech of the people, when it is more than a business code for co-ordinating action, becomes languid and vacuous. (/W, pp. 36-37) This, however, helped mobility, vitality, and dynamism to expand in America, in the social and economic sphere, as it had taken place nowhere else before. The energy to control circumstances as well as the inventiveness to explore the material environment, and to shape it according to a human vision of the world - all this gives America the leading, not to say imperial position, in the global arena nowadays. The America of Non-human Beauties and the Spiritual Goods Santayana is well known for his claim that free intellectual animation and spiritual agitation were absent in the America he knew. The American soil was arid or unfriendly to those types of values that were at variance with the predominant one of anthropocentrism and utilitarianism, and he explains to us why; spirit, and the whole moral life, would then be essentially idle, aristocratic, and contemplative - in a word, utterly un-American. (IWy p. 33) However, if we look at his writings more closely we may come to the conclusion that the American soil was not so dried up as to have been completely deprived of still another - besides those presented above - source of values at all. There existed some oases or spots where non-human beauties and spiritual goods were elevated onto the plain of springs of inspirations, hope, and indications for a good life. We can find, then, the words of appreciation that refer to some ideas presented by Ralph Waldo Emerson, "the Emerson of Nature^ before he had slipped into transcendentalism and moralism and complacency in mediocrity, in order to flatter his countrymen and indirectly to flatter himself (/, p. 178)" and those of Walt Whitman, except the places where his "barbarism is much more pronounced."38 Within them, a fresh, expressive, and sharply outlined strand in the tradition of the moral and spiritual life in America was initiated and it might have been seen by many Americans as a fertile resource for values, no worse or less noble than others. It is possible to apprehend the essence of axiocentrism by means of via negativa first, that is, by emphasizing the fact that it drifts somehow apart from the theocentric way on the one hand, and, on the other, from the anthropocentric, and it focuses on a decent life somewhere beyond them. This</page><page sequence="20">386 Krzysztof Piotr Skowronski way, we can more easily see that it constitutes such a type of moral orientation that is not ultimately based upon the notion of God (with His commandments), nor does it rest upon the assumption that it is Man (with human needs and values) that occupies the central position in the universe. Santayana writes for instance, that for Emerson human life "was generally conceived as one more effluence and illustration of universal laws, and seldom from the point of view of positive human interests."39 This double rejection is accompanied by, on the one hand, a refusal to consider the insolvable controversies over religious dogmas, the inconclusive discussions on the priority of some denominations over others, never-ending debates on the authenticity of some scriptures, and inconclusive proofs on the ingenuity of some others. On the other hand, it dismisses participation in the progress exclusively of human society40 and treats anthropocentrism as a form of egotism41 of one species, which, as one of the results, elevates (morally) itself over other species. If we take on a via positiva approach toward axiocentrism, we shall see that it is not human life as such but rather values that become a sort of criterion of human dignity; namely, aiming at perfection or completion has an obligatory character here. Let me put this more clearly. Perfection is a state of finitude, the fullest realization of some potential, an ultimate step in its development, the greatest "amount of valuableness", the highest point in axiological growth. Following Aristotle's concept oí entelechia (Metaphysics^ 1056b-1066a; 1050- 1051), it is claimed here that the inner potentiality of each living organism makes it brimming with vital tendencies and specific beauties awaiting their actualization, if only the circumstances allow. It is not restricted to a human version of what is the best at all, and the ability to transcend anthropocentrism can also give a balance in selecting the facts given by science and give a sense of proportion while looking at the very ultimate ground of creation, which is, put in other words, pursuing the truth. An appreciation of the good and the beauties must not be reduced to a limited set of things or states of affair that has been prescribed by one species for its own goals at the cost of all others. For example, if we admit that human intelligence is a product of evolution, "it ought apparently to be as much admired as the eyes of mollusks or the antennae of ants ( WD, p. 18)." As has been said above, we assume that values are related to the various needs and desires of various organisms; however, all these organisms have their own latent potentialities, like seeds of plants, that, in propitious circumstances, are ready to thrive and reach finitude, each in its own way. The catalogue of these vital virtues42 is never to be complete since the variegation of the forms of the natural life is too huge to be embraced by any kind of typology. This way, any process of reducing them to the definite types of good means an unavoidable ignorance of those others which, for various reasons, did not happen to have been included on the list. Since each living organism has in its genes a transcription of the potential that can be</page><page sequence="21">American Heritage as a Source of Values 387 stifled as well as having the ability to thrive in a certain environment, it is its natural calling to obey its own nature that should be the guidebook and standard for it rather than any external duties and imposed obligations. This philosophical position does not have to be connected, logically, with any form of absolutism at all; one can be tolerant as regards the sorts of values to be actualized and, at the same time, one does not have to advocate this sort of good rather than another, nor this type of beauty rather than that one. As regards ethics and anthropology, it is a position that advocates aiming at a given perfection and, thus, at least implicitly, embraces an element of deontology; it understands that something ought to be done in order to reach excellence, irrespective of its kind. One can talk of a natural obligation or biological imperative rather than of one imposed by society or extramundane prescriptions. Simultaneously, there is no place here for a defensible doctrine or some laws to be conferred on other people to dominate them spiritually, morally, religiously, and, perhaps, politically. Obligation is meant here exactly in the same sense as when we say that it is one's duty to be healthy, well- balanced, and joyful; there is a natural disposition to be recognized, respected, and strengthened or an ought somehow ingrained biologically to be perfected and not to be stifled, restricted, and distorted at any place. Life without efforts to achieve some degree of some sort of vital perfection everywhere if only possible, life without pursuing some nobility is morally worthless. Or, as Santayana puts it, "integrity or self-definition is and remains first and fundamental in morals: and the right of alien creatures to pursue their proper goals can never abolish our right to pursue ours (7, p. 170)." Accordingly, going for some kind of specific perfection, attempting to actualize one's inner creative energy, and the loyalty to one's inner code is justified morally and vindicated axiologically. Such was also, in Santayana's interpretation, Emerson's attitude to nature; namely a rejection of "subsumption of nature under human categories ( GSA, p. 88)" and the acceptance of "her indomitable and inhuman perfection (GSA, p. 88-89)." Unlike other naturalists active at that time, Emerson was "athirst for some superhuman and absolute good (G5A, p. 90)", so his writings had an orientation toward the world of values rather than merely acceptance of every spontaneous or accidental impulse that happened to appear in human or non- human reality alike. A profound and thoughtful look at them can assume a form of spiritual insight and disinterested recognition. Santayana sees similar tendencies articulated by Whitman. In one of Santayana's partly literary and partly philosophical texts ("Walt Whitman: A Dialogue"), one of the protagonists indicates it very clearly: Things have different values, as one star differs from another star in brightness. All I insist on is that in all you can see light, if your eyes are open. Whitman</page><page sequence="22">388 Krzysztof Piotr Skowroñski would teach you, if you would only read him, to see in things their intrinsic nature and life, rather than the utility they may have for one another. That is his great merit, his sublime justice. It is a kind of profound piety that recognizes the life of every thing in nature, and spares it, and worships its intrinsic worth. There is something brutal and fatuous in the habit we commonly have of passing the parts on nature in review and pronouncing them good or bad according to the effect they have on our lives. Aren't they as real as ourselves? In practical life we have to override them, for if we waited for justice and the ultimate good to direct what we should do, we should die before we had done anything. But it's the privilege of contemplation to be just. Listen to what Whitman says here: "I do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else, And the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills pretty well to me, And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me."(G5Ap. 102) Santayana seems to welcome these ideas himself in his reflections on America, although I would suggest once again that he had been inspired by the writings of the ancient Greeks rather than by the Transcendentalists.43 Going to San Francisco to perform his famous lecture "The Genteel Tradition in American Philosophy" at The University of California at Berkeley in 1911, he had an opportunity to meditate on the American West and its values. One of the results or messages of these reflections, as we can judge them now, being that one can treat California's Sierras exclusively as an inexhaustible source for the materials needed for civil engineering, for the chemical industry, a perfect site for military complexes, animal hunting grounds, or for tourism, that is, the terrain to be somehow explored now, or in the future. It can, however, be seen quite differently; When you escape, as you love to do, to your forests and your sierras, I am sure again that you do not feel you made them, or that they were made for you. They have grown, as you have grown, only more massively and more slowly. In their non-human beauty and peace they stir the sub-human depths and the super-</page><page sequence="23">American Heritage as a Source of Values 389 human possibilities of your own spirit. It is no transcendental logic that they teach; and they give no sign of any deliberate morality seated in the world. It is rather the vanity and superficiality of all logic, the needlessness of argument, the relativity of morals, the strength of time, the fertility of matter, the variety, the unspeakable variety, of possible life. (...) Everywhere is beauty and nowhere permanence, everywhere an incipient harmony, nowhere an intention, nor a responsibility, nor a plan. It is the irresistible suasion of this daily spectacle, it is the daily discipline of contact with things, so different from the verbal discipline of the schools, that will, I trust, inspire the philosophy of your children. A Californian whom I had recently the pleasure of meeting observed that, if the philosophers had lived among your mountains their systems would have been different from what they are. Certainly, I should say, very different from what those systems are which the European genteel tradition has handed down since Socrates; for these systems are egotistical; directly or indirectly they are anthropocentric, and inspired by the conceited notion that man, or human reason, or the human distinction between good and evil, is the centre and pivot of the universe. That is what the mountains and the woods should make you at last ashamed to assert, f WZX P. 213-214) It is not unlimited exploration of Nature's resources to the benefit of Man that is the essence of the stance which is aimed at but rather wisdom about the world and about one's role in it. As we can read in the very last sentence of Santayana's very last book published during his lifetime, wisdom is not a promotion of some chosen good, but rather an understanding of the good that can be enjoyed by various forms of life.44 A sage is happy in perceiving, contemplating, and understanding the phenomena that are around, and these are the fuel which s/he needs to meditate and to feel happy. At the same time, it is not any personal submission to the overwhelming Might nor any conquest of the passive materiality that is sought here; the appreciation of the numberless forms of life and an attempt to comprehend their virtues can give some insight into existence and a sense of piety to its laws. It is this sort of stoical sagacity that is at stake here. Last, but not least, axiocentrism does not limit perfections exclusively to living organisms. It also refers to complete things and fully realized states of affairs. The ancient concept of kalokagatia saw the good and the beauty also in</page><page sequence="24">390 Krzysztof Piotr Skowroñski philosophical systems, mathematical equations, stellar constellations, cosmic laws, harmonious figures, and it recommended these to us for their own sake. As regards the human world, the world of arts and traditions, it is not only a disinterested meditation on them but also a cultivation of them and a mastering of them that could be a challenge and a dignity to perform; here the other type of duty emerges, namely, what should be done rather than what I should do. This concept has not been forgotten in American philosophy. For instance, in Santayana's Persons and Places we can read that "it is only the profane that expect art and religion to serve their private passions" and that "the function of art and religion is precisely to transfigure those private passions so that, far from being served, they may all serve religion and art (/, 112)." The same refers to philosophy, which "seems to me to be its own reward, and its justification lies in the delight and dignity of the art itself."45 This does not mean that aiming at perfections as such precludes thinking about social melioration that is, increasing the value of life in general. They can contribute also to these goals - here and now or, perhaps, in the future and at some place else - in the name of a conviction that the more complete people are and the things that make the world, so much the better; however, this is not the priority here, and this is one of the major differences with the anthropocentric approach. Additionally, the divergence of many various sorts of excellences seems unbridgeable in the realm of matter and the their peaceful co-existence must be restricted to the realm of essence, as the quote in the introduction to the present paper clearly states. This does not mean, however, that different and opposite things or states of affair, if complete and perfect, should not be given justice, recognition, respect, scrutiny, and that they should not be rescued from oblivion, like numerous extinct languages with their grammars, literatures, histories, philosophies, myths, and hopes that these tongues once expressed. Let me just add, that I would not like to give the impression that the dedication to the problem of values or perfection in such a way as just presented means one should view the universe from a definitely fixed vantage point. If so, this position would be vulnerable to exactly the same type of criticism as Santayana directed (in "Naturalistic Metaphysics") against John Dewey's pragmatism, namely that a new metaphysics has been constructed by means of creating a "foreground" and elevating this foreground to a more or less arbitrary, yet privileged point of reference in philosophical assessments. I do not want to suggest that the terms "value" or "perfection" or "axiology" are keys by means of which the secrets of life could be easily recognized and its problems most accurately diagnosed; nor do I wish to say that some causative power, detached existence, and immaterial functions must be conferred on values. I want to suggest that this axiological pluralism deals with the concern about the fullest realization possible of the living organisms, in various directions, and with the fruits of these realizations, irrespective of their utility</page><page sequence="25">American Heritage as a Source of Values 391 in human affairs or their theological purity. Conclusion George Santayana did not fail to recognize the moral and axiological richness of American heritage; we can find in his works that they are diverse enough to offer a broad panorama of sundry insights and to be a fountainhead for a multitude of various inspirations. This plurality was not for him an object of criticism, but rather one of admiration and appreciation. What he strongly condemned, however, was an enormous impoverishment and limitation of this fecundity in the practical dimension, social plain, and everyday life in the United States. Anthropocentrism has become the standard way of thinking and the predominant pattern for a moral, intellectual, and spiritual life, among many ordinary people, philosophers, researchers, and even theologians. Instead, then, of being one of the options to be taken on, it became an almost obligatory way to see the universe. In my opinion, George Santayana's penetrating observations and succinct comments on America show that her heritage can be a fertile source of sundry values for those people of today who have a need to take a closer look.

Justus Buchler and Benjamin Schwartz (eds.). New York, London: Scribner's, 1936, pp. 213-240). 9. John Dewey, Theory of Valuation. International Encyclopedia of Unified Science. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1939, p. 3, 11, 12. 10. Thus, the respect for animals (not only cows) that is hardly acceptable in anthropocentric Western cultures; there are some Indian sects where walking is accompanied by sweeping the way ahead in order to avoid tramping on the worms and insects, meaning organisms have the same right to live as all other beings. 11. Cf. "You certainly have the right for prescribed activities but never at anytime in their results. You should never be motivated by the results of the actions, nor should there be any attachment in not doing your prescribed activities {Bhagavad- Gita, II, 47)." 12. Hence, for example, the appreciation of suicide as a sort of "good way out", seeing war as an appropriate testing ground for human virtues, and with a certain indifference to the lot of other people. 13. The philosophical category axios, meaning "value", was first articulated in Stoic thought (cf: Seneca, Epistles, 89; Diogenes Laertios, Lives of Eminent Philosophers, VII, 105). 14.

In the sentence preceding the quote he uses the term "theocratic" rather than theocentric; although these terms signify something different, in Santayana they may be used to refer to the same thing, especially as he does not use "theocractic" - at least in this place - in any political meaning of the word and does not refer to any theocracy as a form of government. 17.

Cf; "Jonathan Edwards, for instance, was a Calvinist of pristine force and perhaps the greatest master in false philosophy that America has yet produced (George Santayana, Character and Opinion in the United States with Reminiscences of William James and Josiah Royce and Academic Life in America. New York: Scribner's, 1920, p. 9. To be cited as COUS.y 23. Cf: "It is notorious how metaphysical was the passion that drove the Puritans to those shores; they went there in the hope of living more perfectly in the spirit. And their pilgrim's progress was not finished when they had founded their churches in the wilderness; and endless migration of the mind was still before them, a flight from those new idols and servitudes which prosperity involves, and the eternal lure of spiritual freedom and truth (COL/5, p. 4)." 24. Cf: "[T]he philosophic influence which was supreme over my youth and has left its honored mark on my age was Puritanism. My father was a deacon in an Orthodox church. Four uncles were Orthodox ministers. Religion of that positive type entered into every hour of my happy home. In a former paper I have set forth the facts and features of the Puritan home and shown how far from true are the current caricatures of it. While profoundly serious - more romantically serious than many natures could well bear - there was nothing morose or sour about it. If its people had such traits independently, these no doubt appeared peculiarly unlovely in a religious setting. But for stout and cheerful souls it was an ennobling faith, providing abundant room for the play of all that is worthy in human character (George Herbert Palmer, The Autobiography of a Philosopher. Boston: Mifflin, 1930, p. 6-7. )" 25. Cf.: "his [James's] little sermons on habit, on will, on faith, and this on the latent capacities of men, were fine and stirring, and just the sermons to preach to the young Christian soldier. He was much less sceptical in morals than in science. (COLtf, p. 84-85)" 26. Cf: "Royce was heir to the Calvinistic tradition; piety, to his mind, consisted in trusting divine providence and justice, while emphasising the most terrifying truths about one's own depravity and the sinister holiness of God. He accordingly addressed himself, in his chief writings, to showing that all lives were parts of a single divine life in which all problems were solved and all evils justified. (COÍ/5, p. 100)" 27. Namely, on one of Santayana's closest school-friends, Edward Baylay, who was loyal to his strict Puritan tradition and yet was full of integrity, charity, hospitality and lacked narrowness and fanaticism. Santayana admired his excellent tolerance and claimed that Baylay had "affection for what he excluded from his own sphere, justice to what he renounced, happiness in the joys of others that were not joys to him. (...) Young Baylay was my first, perhaps my fundamental model for The Last Puritan (The Works of George Santayana. Critical Edition. William G. Holzberger and Herman J. Saatkamp Jr. (eds.). Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England: The MIT Press, Vol. I, p. 178)". To be cited by the Volume number. 28. Cr., George W. Howgate, George òantayana. New York: A Perpetua Book, 1961, p. 264. 29. However, the novel is not an apology for American Puritanism - Santayana makes it very clear that taken historically and sociologically Puritanism "has anything to do with purity (IV, p. 16)." 30.

Thus, Santayana adds, Jonathan Edwards for example, "paid the price by being abandoned, even in his lifetime, by his own sect, and seeing the world turn a deaf ear to his logic without so much as attempting to refute it (COUS, p. 9)." 32. Cf: "I can find little in their [American humanists'] recommendations except a cautious allegiance to the genteel tradition (GTB, p. 40)." 33. Cf: "[A]gainst the verbiage by which man persuades himself that he is the goal and acme of the universe, laughter is the proper defence. (Little Essays Drawn from the Writings of George Santayana. Logan Pearhall Smith (ed.). New York: Scribner's, 1924, p. 228)"; "But how shall any detached philosopher believe that the whole universe, which may be infinite, is nothing but an enlarged edition, or an expurgated edition, of human life? (GTB, p. 28)" 34. The opinion according to which religion itself is a form of utilitarian approach toward life, need not be discussed here. 35. Cf: H. M. Kallen, "America and the Life of Reason."

Cf.; "Nothing, perhaps, gives Emerson a better right to be called a philosopher than his freedom from the superstition of progress (GSA, p. 75)." 41. According to Santayana, egoism is something different than egotism. The former means a legitimate pursuit of one's own preferences, tastes, interests, and aims triggered or stimulated by biological nature; the latter is a posture where the world does not possess any other beings or species to be respected and any other valuable modes of pursuing vital aims. 42. By virtue, Santayana understands "spirits having only a vegetative or lyric life, perfect in themselves, and not addressed to exercising any influence over other beings (DP, p. 2)" 43. Santayana declares that his "cosmological naturalism or materialism" he "consciously draw from Democritus, Lucretius, and Spinoza (The Philosophy of George Santayana. The Library of Living Philosophers, Paul Arthur Schlipp (ed.). New York: Tudor, 1951, p. 600)." 44. Cf.: "[WJisdom lies not in pronouncing what sort of good is best but in understanding each good within the lives that enjoy it as it actually is in its physical complexion and in its moral essence (DP, p. 466)." 45.
