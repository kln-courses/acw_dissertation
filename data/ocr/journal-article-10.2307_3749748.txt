<plain_text><page sequence="1">ETHOLOGY AND ETHICS HUGO MEYNELL I IN MY argument in this paper I shall assume rather than try to prove the proposition, surely not on the face of it an unreasonable one, that the question of what actions, dispositions and circumstances are such as to frustrate human beings, and what are such as to make them comparatively happy and fulfilled, has a great deal of bearing on the question of what actions and dispositions are good or bad. I shall also assume that the way in which human persons or societies can achieve fulfilment, or fail to achieve it, is explicable largely on the basis of the way in which man as a species has evolved. Few people, except those strongly affected by philo- sophical fashion, will wish to deny the first of these propositions. What one might call the hard utilitarian thesis, that goodness is to be defined in terms of contribution to happiness or fulfilment, may involve the 'natural- istic fallacy', may be vulnerable to the arguments of Moore, Hare and others. But I shall not commit myself here to the hard utilitarian thesis, since 1 am not insisting that goodness may be defined in terms of contribu- tion to human happiness or fulfilment, but only that the question of how far anything contributes to human happiness or fulfilment has a vital bearing on the question of whether and to what extent it is good. I do not think that many people really doubt the truth of this proposition, unless they confuse it with the hard utilitarian thesis. We have a kind of preliminary intuitive grasp of what it is to be a fulfilled human being, and hence of what it is to fail to be such, which has not changed radically since long before, say, the composition of Plato's Republic. This is admittedly corrected and amplified as our knowledge advances, to a degree that those systems of morals, which depend on a very detailed account available to intuition of the nature of man, were led gravely to underestimate. In his recent book on Aquinas and Natural Law, Professor D. J. O'Connor takes that philosopher to task for his assumption that there is such a thing as the 'nature' of man as such, from which moral rules for human beings might be deemed to derive.1 But though it may be true that there is no single set of necessary conditions which must be fulfilled by a flourishing and fully-realised human individual or human community, such individuals and such communities may at least all approximate to some kind of norm. A fulfilled and happy human life cannot be lived in conditions like those of Auschwitz or the Warsaw Ghetto. That human beings cannot fulfil themselves under such condi- tions of material deprivation and social disruption is an objective fact about human nature as such, and not merely about some individuals from some social backgrounds. To the degree that human nature is homo- geneous, the very general principles according to which men may flourish, 290</page><page sequence="2">ETHOLOGY AND ETHICS or fail to flourish, as individuals or groups, will also be homogeneous. And it is such principles on which both morality ultimately depends, and ethology may be expected to throw some light. O'Connor also brings out a difficulty which has been much canvassed by moral philosophers in the last half-century: that while what we can do may certainly be inferred from the kind of creatures that we are, it is by no means clear how what we ought to do can be so inferred.2 The missing link here is reference to happiness; that we ought on the 'hole to do what conduces to the happiness of ourselves and of others. What actually contributes to men's happiness depends on the sort of creature that man has evolved to be; and so ultimately what is morally good depends on this as well. To make goodness depend on happiness in this way (even if it is granted that the way in which one may be happy depends on one's nature as a biological organism) is at first sight to fall foul of the usual arguments against ethical naturalism. But these arguments are valid, at least against the kind of naturalism which would define goodness in terms of contribution to happiness, only so far as the qualification 'as a whole' or 'in general' is left out of the statement of the naturalist's prin- ciples. This is what makes the crucial difference between the 'soft' utilitarianism which I am trying to commend and the 'hard' utilitarianism which I would admit to be capable of such refutation. In special cases, like that of the punishment of an innocent man to appease a destructive mob, we are likely to argue that the principle of happiness should yield to that of justice3; but this does not imply that it is not of the essence of moral argument that the happiness of oneself or others is on the whole, apart from such special cases as that in which the principle of happiness conflicts with that of justice, a valid court of appeal. I would argue that if a man denied that on the whole one ought to do what tends to promote the general happiness, he would not just be advancing an odd moral point of view, but would be showing that he did not know what was meant by 'ought'. There are certain paradigm moral judgments which, while they are not tautologies in any usual sense of the term, are such that one would be inclined to say, of a man who denied them, 'he does not know the meaning of "morally good"'. And an individual who really did not know this, and acted and felt as though lie did not know it, would be not so much ignorant as inhuman or insane.4 Ethology, I take it, is the study of animal (including human) behaviour, and I want to consider what significance ethological studies and their con- clusions might have for moral questions. Summarily, I wish to suggest that ethology sheds a great deal of light on the question of what kind of behaviour in what circumstances contributes to human happiness and fulfilment, and therefore (assuming my soft utilitarian thesis) on what actions in what circumstances are good, and what bad. I shall concentrate particularly on one famous book on ethology, On Aggression, by Konrad 291</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHY Lorenz.5 I am not competent to raise the question of how far the par- ticular empirical hypotheses advanced by the book are supported by good evidence; but merely that of what significance, if the empirical hypotheses advanced were true, they would have for ethics. Someone may object: 'But moral philosophy properly speaking is not concerned with any question of fact whatever, but only with the logic of moral discourse.' I would counter, in accordance with Mary Warnock's suggestions at the end of Ethics since 1900, that it is impossible to come to any very useful con- clusions regarding the nature of moral discourse until one has some idea of the situation (of human misery, happiness, desire, frustration) within which moral discourse has application. As soon try to understand 'the logic of modern physics' with no reference to the results of experiments carried out by modern physicists. And as concepts like 'energy', 'mass' and 'particle' progressively change as we learn more and more about the structure of material bodies, so it might be expected that concepts like 'love', 'hate', 'goodness' and 'wrongness' will change, at least peripherally, as we find out more about human beings, their actions and their motives. The argument of Lorenz's book can be reduced, so far as it is relevant to my purpose in this paper, to nine theses, the last five more directly relevant to morality, the first four supporting them. In the second part of this paper I shall list the theses and summarise the material with which Lorenz supports them, and in the third I shall add some comments and try to rebut possible objections. II (1) Personal bonds of love and friendship arise only among animals aggressive towards other members of their own species. In explaining any trait characteristic of animals, especially when it is widespread among many different and unrelated species, the zoologist is bound to ask what survival value it has. It is at first difficult to see what survival value there could be in aggression between members of the same species. Darwin noted that it was better for the prospects of a race if the strongest male among those available took possession of the female; and to this end, a fight resulting in the loser making himself scarce is evidently one available means. More recently, it has been remarked that intra- specific aggression tends to spread a species over the available habitat, so that crowding does not take place with bad consequences for the food supply (23; i).6 It seems that this last effect constitutes the most im- portant survival-value of intra-specific aggression. It also seems that the personal bond (the state in which one member of a species treats one or more among its companions with special discrimination) came into existence at that point in evolution where the cooperation of two or more aggressive animals was necessary; and usually this was for the tending of the brood (186). It is remarkable that only aggressive animals form personal bonds of this kind. Now aggression is millions of years older 292</page><page sequence="4">ETHOLOGY AND ETHICS than personal friendship and love. Most present-day reptiles are ag- gressive towards other members of their own species, and there is every reason to suppose that their ancestors were at least equally so. But the personal bond appears only in one group of fishes, in birds and in mammals -all of which groups have developed fairly recently by evolutionary standards (186). (2) Love and friendship have evolved phylogenetically fiom intra-specific aggression, and in certain circumstances may turn into it. This is the central thesis of Lorenz's book, from which all the others are more or less derivative. I shall therefore give a considerable amount of space to his defence and illustration of it. It is certainly a striking fact that all those species of animals which form personal bonds of love and friendship, or anything at all analogous to them, are aggressive towards other members of their own species. This is the more remarkable when these species (a few fishes, and some birds and mammals) are so distantly related to one another. Among some aggressive and brightly-coloured fish, it is to be observed that there is peaceful co-existence only between individuals in a conjugal pair. On the other hand, such a pair will be more aggressive towards outsiders than will single fish (10). The male of a pair of cichlids is in the habit, moreover, of delivering a furious attack on his mate which in the event by-passes her narrowly, and finds its goal in another cichlid -which in natural conditions is the territorial neighbour (143). In the very early stages of cohabitation between a pair of cichlids, the partner must always appear from the same direction, in the same manner, with the same lighting; otherwise each fish regards the other as a stranger to be fought. If a captive pair are put into another aquarium at this stage, the whole process of pair-formation may be wrecked. But 'the closer the acquaintanceship becomes, the more the picture (i.e. of the mate) becomes independent of the background' (143). In aquarium cichlids, where aggression which would normally be vented on territorial neighbours is denied outlet, the result may be the killing of one of the partners (44). Experienced keepers have occasionally been made aware that glass parti- tions, with cichlid pairs on each side, were being blurred by a growth of weed, by the fact that a cichlid male was getting very rude to his wife (45). In some geese and ducks, the female will actually incite her mate to attack another member of the species, while in others, the action of 'inciting' seems to have become entirely stylised, and there are many intermediate states. '. . . While the message of inciting in ruddy shelduck and Egyptian geese could be expressed in the words "Drive him off, thrash him!", in diving ducks (and dabbling ducks) it simply means "I love you". In several groups, midway between these two extremes, as for example in the gadwall and widgeon, an intermediate meaning may be found, "You are my hero. I rely on you "' (53). (These 'meanings' are presumably to be inferred from the situations into which the actions fit, into which, as Wittgenstein would say, they are woven in the elementary 293</page><page sequence="5">PHILOSOPHY language-games of the various species of ducks and geese concerned.) This series of examples is an especially striking illustration of what may be said to be the central thesis of Lorenz's book-that activities arising from redirected aggression form and maintain bonds of love and friendship between conspecifics (56). The behaviour of aggression redirected to love, for example between a pair of ducks, becomes itself a relief of the instinctive drive, and thus the behaviour is the bond (55). A bird or other animal in losing its mate loses the only object on which it can discharge the drive; hence the restless searching that ensues for the lost partner (56). Between living mates, there results 'that magic elastic band which, in geese, ravens or jackdaws, evidently pulls harder as the mates get further away from one another' (129). It appears in general that evolution has solved the problem of the pre- vention of inter-marital fighting not by the inhibition of aggression, but by its redirection to the hostile neighbour (145). In the so-called 'dance' of cranes, 'the whole procedure says as clearly as human words, "I am big and threatening, but not towards you-towards the other, the other, the other" (149). A mallard pair will engage in their own greeting cere- mony most intensely when they find one another again after a long period of separation (15). Disintegration of fighting inhibitions seems to threaten the partners every time they separate, which explains the appease- ment ceremony there is at each reunion. In human beings as well as animals we find greeting between lovers and friends excited and intense in proportion to the length of time of the separation (151-2). Some human types of greeting, in particular, give plausibility to the theory that the greeting smile has evolved through a ritualising of redirected threatening. 'The friendly tooth-baring of very polite Japanese lends support to this theory.' Many oriental people smile in this way, and it is remarkable that when smiling most intensely they do not look straight at the person greeted, but past him (152). The general conclusion seems to be that, in the course of phylogenesis, 'greeting has evolved from threatening by way of redirection and ritualisa- tion'. In individual development, however, it is greeting from the first (159) (though in some cases, as we shall see, it can degenerate into aggres- sion in a pair of individuals). In the greylag goose pair, it is the so-called 'triumph ceremony', the stylised procedure of greeting, which holds the pair together; sexual relations do not appear to play such an important role (165). In the female of this species, in geese as opposed to ganders, copulation and the triumph ceremony cannot readily be performed with different individuals. Also, the goose finds it much more difficult than the gander to enter into a new triumph-ceremony relationship after she has lost her partner (174). However, an often widowed or divorced female goose is comparatively very ready to enter a new triumph-ceremony relationship or to copulate, not being inhibited by the maidenly restraint which is typical of virgin geese (175). A goose deprived of its partner by 294</page><page sequence="6">ETHOLOGY AND ETHICS mischance will at first search round actively for it. When this search is unsuccessful, the bereaved goose loses all courage and runs away even from the youngest and weakest members of the flock. Everything ob- servable in the general bearing of a goose which loses its mate corresponds to what is observable in human grief. In goose as in man, it is in the neighbourhood of the eyes, due to a certain characteristic set of the muscles, that the characteristic signs of deep grief are to be seen (179). 'If, in the greylag goose and in man, highly complex norms of behaviour, such as falling in love, strife for ranking order, jealousy, grieving etc., are not only similar but down to the most absurd details the same, we can be sure that every one of these instincts has survival value, in each case almost if not quite the same in the greylag as in man' (187). It is remarkable that geese reared in isolation are very disturbed in relation to their environment, especially its social aspect. In this they show a vivid analogy to hospitalised human children (177). Particularly strongly affected is the capacity for dealing actively with novel situations; rather than actively exploring their environment and searching for new stimuli, the goose who has been deprived as a gosling of normal contacts will avoid any new stimulation, and react to it as though it were painful to it (177-8). Though the geese seem slowly to recover, it is not yet known how complete such recovery can be. 'As yet none of our experimental geese' (those raised in isolation) 'has paired' (178). The triumph ceremony, when it reaches a very high level of intensity, becomes more and more ominously similar to the aggression which is its prototype (183). Usually this sinister de-ritualisation subsides, but in a very few observed cases, the partners have started beating one another, indeed with a severity out of all proportion to that of the usual squabbles between geese. The usual sort of fight lasts only a few seconds or at most a minute, whereas this particular kind may last five minutes. Once this has happened between triumph-ceremony partners, they seem sedulously to avoid one another (184). When they do chance to come face to face, their reaction can only be described as one of embarrassment. The pe- culiar bitterness of matrimonial quarrels in man is evidently closely com- parable. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that in all true cases of love the measure of latent aggression is so high that, on the rupturing of the bond, hate will regularly make its appearance (185). Hate, as opposed to ordinary aggression, is directed towards a particular individual, just as love is (186). The argument with which Lorenz supports the second thesis should now be summarised, since it is easy to lose sight of it in the welter of corrobora- tive detail. To explain how any physical or behavioural characteristic of a species has evolved is to show both how it has survival-value for that species, and also how it could have arisen by plausible mutations from previous characteristics. Given sexual reproduction, it is evidently neces- sary for con-specifics not to avoid one another in all circumstances; but 295</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHY given the necessity for the spread of a species over the available habitat, for avoidance of overcrowding, aggressive behaviour towards con- specifics evidently also has survival-value. So far, all that has to be recon- ciled are the need to associate for long enough to copulate, and general aggression against members of the species. But if young are to be reared and protected, association of two or more animals for this purpose will evidently have survival-value, within the general context of intra-specific aggression. But how could such a colossal modification of behaviour come about? Lorenz argues that it does so by the re-direction of aggression from the mate to other members of the species. In the absence of alterna- tive explanations, this one surely has some plausibility, and is confirmed to some extent by the fact that all animals which form personal bonds are aggressive, and more impressively by the apparent presence of all degrees of such redirection and sublimation in nature. (3) Intra-specific aggression very rarely leads conspecifics to kill one another, at least in the natural state. Powerfully-built animals have evolved by natural selection to have strong inhibitions against the killing of members of their own species. In all the very heavily-armed carnivores, intra-specific aggression is limited by strong inhibitions. The present dangers in human civilisation are due precisely to the fact that man has not got a carnivorous mentality-that he is basically harmless, devoid of natural weapons for killing big prey, and therefore without the inhibitions against killing his own kind which such animals must have in order to survive as a species (207). This is not to deny, of course, that man has some inhibi- tions of this kind; a little introspection, when one is very angry indeed with some other person, will suggest that at moments of greatest aggressive feeling 1 do not so much want to kill my enemy as to beat him sufficiently to make him feel my superiority (38-9). And the gentleman's horror at the idea of striking any woman, which one might expect to be rather narrowly determined by culture, is shared by quite a number of species of animals. Not only do dogs refuse to bite bitches, even under severe provocation, but there are inhibitions against fighting females in hamsters, goldfinches and even a few reptiles (105). The bullfinch, who accepts any number of attacks from his wife without becoming aggressive, evidently impresses her in so doing (107). It is worth noting that this and other examples of chivalrous behaviour, such as feeding the mate in birds, are privileges falling to the higher-ranking of two animals. (4) The condition of men in palaeolithic times developed markedly in them aggression between tribal groups. In inter-tribal warfare, the 'warrior- virtues' were at a premium from the point of view of survival. Sometimes natural selection comes to operate as a form of competition within a species which does not help the species as such to survive. The Egyptian goose will incite her male partner to fight, and if he loses will tend to go 296</page><page sequence="8">ETHOLOGY AND ETHICS over to the victor. This fighting urge is probably of no survival value whatever to the species, but is a result of intra-specific selection (155). The hen of the Argus pheasant reacts sexually to huge eye-spots on the wings of the male. A cock with really big eye-spots can scarcely fly; and the result is that it is precisely the leaver of most descendants who is most liable to be eaten by predators. Here, as in Western man's hectic competi- tive life, 'competition between members of a species causes selective breeding without any relation to the extra-specific environment' (33). Forty thousand years or so ago, in the early Stone Age, man had mastered the dangers which threatened him from nature to such an extent that the pressure exerted by one tribe upon another became the chief factor deter- mining evolution. So it is that man has developed those 'warrior virtues' that are still unfortunately so widely regarded as unequivocally desirable (34, 209). (There was a survival value in man's both cultivating these virtues in himself and encouraging them in others, and in women choosing to mate with men who possessed them. One is reminded of the Egyptian goose, and of examples of women who cry out for blood at the boxing ring, as well as of those who handed white feathers to men whom they met in the street during the First World War.) The greatest dangers to man's survival at present stem from the fact that those instinctive disposi- tions, which enabled our ancestors to survive in inter-tribal fighting, now realise themselves most effectively in war; these are 'readiness to sacrifice oneself in the service of a common cause, disciplined submission to the rank-order of a group, mutual aid in the face of deadly danger, and above all, a superlatively strong bond of friendship between men' (242). That such admirable qualities flourish in war makes many decent people unable to see war as the abominable evil that it is (243). Intra-specific selection in man also works in the direction of self-assertion and the amassing of property, and in general against simple goodness (211). (5) Aggression between man and man is to a large extent an innate, rather than a socially imposed characteristic, and is hence hardly to be removed, though it may indeed be ameliorated, by changes in education and social structure. That the aggressive tendency is innate in men as well as in other animals seems an inescapable conclusion from the evidence. I suppose most people would accept that this is the case for the non-human animals; but in man, matters are widely supposed to be different. The underlying fallacy is that 'animal and human behaviour is predominantly reactive and that, even if it contains any innate elements at all, it can be altered to an unlimited extent by learning' (41). This superstition, dear as it is to ideologues both eastern and western, flies in the face of the evidence. The central nervous system of animals does not have to wait for stimuli, whatever be the ideological pressure in favour of its doing so (41-2). A captive male ring-dove deprived of female company first courted a pre- viously ignored white dove, then a rolled up newspaper when deprived 297</page><page sequence="9">PHILOSOPHY of that, and finally a corner of his cage. It appears that the threshold- value of eliciting stimuli drops steadily the longer an instinctive behaviour- pattern is passive (42). The stimulus may even drop to zero, as when a hand-reared starling snaps at imaginary flies (43). And if the eliciting stimuli do not appear for some time, the organism is 'thrown into a state of general unrest and begins to search actively for the missing stimulus. In the simplest cases, this "search" consists only in an increase of random locomotion, in swimming or running round; in the most complicated, it may include the highest achievements of learning and insight' (43). (6) Specifically moral and other-regarding dispositions also depend on inherited instinct, and not merely on the restraint of such instinct by reason. Now many, including some philosophers, seem to think that all human behaviour which tends to promote the welfare of society as opposed to that of the individual himself are the result of rational reflections. (Freud's theories, I think, have a bias in this direction: Jung's do not.) On the contrary, moral responsibility, and the feelings and emotions which undergird it, could not have arisen unless men had been members of structured communities before ever conceptual thinking took place (212). If social customs did not develop this kind of autonomous power, there would be no good faith and no law (71). However much rational insight one may have into an action and the maxim underlying it, there would be no imperative or prohibition unless some emotional source of energy, which can only derive from our instincts, supplied the motive (213). Men on the whole behave well in difficult situations, so long as these are of a kind which occurred often enough in palaeolithic times for social norms to have evolved for coping with them. This is as much as to say that there are certain kinds of strain which men are genetically adapted to take (216). But in our predisposition to conform with social norms, we differ a great deal from one another. A man who is instinctively inclined to behave in a socially beneficial manner does not make many demands on his reserves of moral responsibility, and has them available for exceptional circum- stances. But one who has to use all his reserves to curb day-to-day inclinations will be very likely to break down under additional stress (221). (7) The redirection of aggression outside one's community is a possible solution to the problem of discharging aggression. One form of social organisation in animals is characterised by the collective hostility of one group against another. The malfunctioning of this form of aggression seems to be a model in which we can see some of the dangers threatening ourselves (134). Now jackdaws, geese and monkeys seem to know one another personally, rats and bees only as clan-members. This seems to be done in the case of rats by the sense of smell; a rat can become a hated stranger to other members of its clan if its smell is changed (138). Like the smell of rats, human 'good manners', that is to say the manners of one's 298</page><page sequence="10">ETHOLOGY AND ETHICS own group, inhibit aggression and form bonds. To enter a room without various little appeasing rituals provokes anger, just as overt aggression does (66). Members of the Latin races are often considered 'unreliable' by Germans and Anglo-Saxons, just because their more pronounced gestures of conciliation lead the latter to expect more good will than is actually there (68-9). Little misunderstandings arising from this fact do much to contribute to inter-group hate, since one feels one has been de- liberately cheated or wronged by the foreigner (69). The extreme expres- sion of this tendency is those cases where other groups are considered not to be human-as in some primitive tribes where the word meaning 'member of the tribe' is the same as that for 'man' (70). The most familiar symptom of solidarity with one's own group and opposition to others is the emotion of militant enthusiasm. The object defended by militant enthusiasm seems originally to have been the small community held together by personal acquaintance and friendship; later, as the social unit grew and the characteristic norms and rites became the factors holding it together, these became themselves the focus of loyalty (233). We do not enjoy combativeness because we are split into such groups as political parties, but we are split into political parties and other opposed groups because this is a satisfying way of arousing our militant enthusiasm (234). (8) With the invention of long-range weapons, man's aggressive impulses towards other members of his species are not balanced by corresponding inhibitions. As we stated above, it appears that since early palaeolithic times there has been little pressure from natural selection to prevent men from killing their fellows; and now suddenly 'the equilibrium of killing potential and social inhibitions' has been upset by the invention of arti- ficial weapons (207). All at once we became like pigeons who had abruptly acquired the beaks of ravens. 'One shudders at the thought of a creature as irascible as all primates are swinging a well-sharpened hand- axe' (208). It is the distance at which shooting-weapons take effect which prevents the inhibition of the assailant's urge to kill which would other- wise occur (208), since the pity which would allow a well-beaten opponent to slink away has no chance to operate. (9) The conditions of modern life leave men with no adequate scope for the discharge of their aggressive impulses, and this is a prime cause of violence and neurosis. We have evolved, on the contrary, as has previously been shown, to find a deep satisfaction in the state of war. If we went to control any instinctive behaviour-pattern, the first thing to find out is the situations which evoke it. The militant enthusiasm which is so fruitful a source of war and other conflict is fostered especially in the following circumstances: 299</page><page sequence="11">PHILOSOPHY (a) When the group with which the enthusiast identifies himself appears to be threatened from without. This group may be of any size from a family to a nation-state; or it may be represented by the ideals in reference to which the group is identified. So the response may be brought into action on behalf of the sports club or the nation, or in the service of any ideal whatever, from that of the practice of the most absurd rituals and mannerisms to that of the pursuit of scientific truth or social justice. (b) When there is an identifiable hostile group which is supposed to constitute a threat to the original group or its 'values'. This can be concrete or abstract, the Jews or the Boches on the one hand, or capitalism, bolshevism, fascism or any other sort of-ism on the other. (c) When there is an inspiring leader. Even those groups which adhere to ideals one would have thought inimical to the cultivation of leader- figures cannot do without them, as is clear from the fact that all kinds of political parties display huge pictures of their leaders. (d) When there are many other individuals who share the enthusiasm. The degree of excitation seems to grow in proportion to the number of individuals involved (235). Fortunately, aggression is transferred to substitute objects more easily than most other instincts. And the choice of objects is more easily amenable to reason than might appear at first sight. Even those violently irascible people who break crockery when they are in a temper, and appear to have lost every vestige of control over their actions, choose cheap crockery to smash rather than really valuable objects (240). Sport is of the highest importance not only as a mere outlet for aggression, but as a school for the control of human fighting behaviour (241-2). (In A Pattern of Islands, Sir Arthur Grimble says that some of the Gilbertese were quite conscious that cricket took the place in their culture of former inter-tribal warfare.) Thus there is at least some ground for hope that we may manage to sublimate our excess of the warrior-virtues, and our innate disposition to admire them, into the more strenuous forms of sport, and perhaps out- standingly into braving the perils of space-exploration (243). Another means of preventing the mutual group-hatred which leads to war is personal acquaintance between members of different nations; since no one can whole-heartedly hate a nation among which he has several personal friends. We can learn much from the demagogues who pursue exactly the opposite policy, since they know very well that any sort of fellow- feeling makes an obstacle to aggression. (243) Natural selection presumably determines the growth of human cultures in the same way as it does that of species (224); the successful ones sur- viving, the unsuccessful perishing. Many superstitions get institutionalized (and this disposition to maintain patterns of behaviour which have got one by in the past is evidently of survival value short of the discovery of anything better) (224-5). There is a danger that valuable patterns of behaviour may be rejected when the role that they play is insufficiently 300</page><page sequence="12">ETHOLOGY AND ETHICS appreciated. The legend of the tree of knowledge is perhaps a defence of sacred traditions against such premature replacement (227). Human cultures fortunately seem to have evolved a mechanism for gradual change. At about the age of puberty, human individuals tend to loosen their allegiance to the norms provided by their cultures, and to look around for more worthy ideals. If the old ideals seem fallacious under scrutiny, but none appear to take their place, it may be suspected that the aimless- ness and boredom of the young delinquent are the natural consequence. Alternatively, the need to belong to a group fighting for ideals may be so strong that almost any ideals, however absurd in themselves, will serve the purpose. This seems to be the explanation of the formation of juvenile gangs, whose social structure is probably like that in very primitive human societies. Apparently this object-fixation can only happen once in an individual's life. Once the allegiance to a cause or the embracing of new social norms is thoroughly established, it cannot be erased again, at least not so as to make room for another equally strong attachment (230). III So far I have been simply expounding Lorenz's theses, and summarising the arguments with which he supports them. Next there are some objec- tions to be dealt with. First, it may be objected that the ascription of love and friendship to geese and even fish, let alone of chivalry to lizards, is excessively anthropomorphic. Certainly, human society, or some other society of equally highly intelligent and sensitive beings, is the necessary locus of love and friendship in the full sense of these terms; and it is deceptive to talk, when referring to animals other than man, as though this full context existed. Could the Egyptian goose, it might be asked, who makes certain gestures to her mate in the presence of an intruder, really mean 'Drive him off! Thrash him!'? The answer is that to say that this is the meaning of the gesture is to say that it is as it were woven into the other actions, and the total situation, of the geese concerned, very much as the verbal expression is in the case of human beings.7 Perhaps where some are in danger of excessive anthropomorphism in describing such a situation, others are in danger of not enough of it. It is no more misleading to assume that there is among other animals the complex human situation which provides the paradigm context for the application of terms like 'love', 'hate' and 'incitement', than to assume that there is nothing analogous to it. Particularly in cases like that of the greylag goose, in whose social behaviour there are so many obvious parallels to that of human beings, it seems less arbitrary to make use of the equivalent human terms, at least when the proper qualifications are made or can be assumed, than to refuse to use them. Animals are not men; but, notwithstanding Descartes, they are not things either. It may further be objected that the very kind of argument that Lorenz uses, for instance to show that a disposition to aggression is innate in man, 301</page><page sequence="13">PHILOSOPHY can never amount to real proof. The question then arises of what would count as adequate confirmation or refutation in such a context. In questions about biological evolution, crucial experiments are not possible; biology, like history, does not conform, at least at all neatly, to the Popperian canon of falsifiability. All that can be done is to provide hypotheses to fit the known facts, though it is important for their scientific status, certainly, that new evidence conceivably could falsify them. Apart from the provision of an alternative hypothesis which accounts for the existence of aggression and of love, and the particular relationship that is observed between them in so many kinds of animal, better than does Lorenz's, his ought to be accepted, even if only provisionally. And this theory entails that the human disposition to aggression is innate. The contrary thesis, that aggression is only instilled by environment (which admittedly can be shown to exacerbate or ameliorate aggressive tendencies), is not only not capable of proof, but does not have a shred of evidence in support of it. The grounds for believing it are ideological, not scientific. 8 The very common and widely-held belief, that aggression between human beings is due only to environmental factors, is a fallacy confirmed by no scientific evidence, but only by the fantasies of millenarians and the senti- mentality of educationists. If aggressive dispositions are innate in the vast majority of human beings, we cannot, not only on rational grounds, but if we are to survive as a race, go on indulging ourselves in the luxury of blaming the contingencies of particular social systems for it. Bertrand Russell says in his Autobiography that when he tried running a school on the most permissible principles possible, he found that the children tended all the same sometimes to hit one another. Evidently, he concluded, his enlightened regime could not counteract the harm that had already been done to the children by their parents. Russell's assumption here, that an aggressive disposition must be due only to environmental and not at all to genetic factors, is a very widespread one. Marxists and Western democrats alike are predisposed to believe that we are born as tabulae rasae ready for the imprinting of characteristics, intellectual or moral or emotional, by our environment. 9 To deny this doctrine is unfortunately to set limits to the influence which can be exerted on human nature by education. Also, and perhaps worse still, it is to forego the delightful activity of blaming all dispositions in people which we dislike on social conditions. (Of course, the blaming of all aggression on the social struc- ture within which it occurs is itself a form of the inter-group aggression described by Lorenz.) And yet, the study of animals as well as men shows, as conclusively as can possibly be in matters of this kind, that the disposition to be aggressive is innate. Apparently, each one. of us is born with certain latent capacities for behavioural development, which our en- vironment, though it can play one of a large number of variations on it, cannot modify to an indefinite extent. 10 302</page><page sequence="14">ETHOLOGY AND ETHICS Certain potentialities for development, including more or less aggression, are built into each individual at birth. These cannot be radically altered short of destruction of the organism. To believe otherwise is either to contest what appears incontestable, that many behavioural dispositions in animals are innate and not taught; or to postulate a radical difference in this respect between men and other animals. Reason certainly gives us a certain manoeuvrability in relation to the pressure of our instincts, such as other animals do not have; but it does not enable us to live without any deference to them. I do not wish to deny that the power of environ- ment in conditioning human behaviour is immense, but merely to insist that the result can only be a variation on a given basic pattern. It has been suggested that hard work may be a means of sublimating aggressive tendencies, and hence that the slowing-up of the pace of work might release aggression elsewhere in the worker's life. ('In my young day, students and workers had too much to do to be always protesting and striking. And one notices in general that it's usually the arts students, who have far more time on their hands than the scientists, who make most of the trouble'.) Now I understand that human work in general is rather analogous to the non-human animal's hunt for food, and in the case of a predator to its killing of animals of other species, than to intra- specific aggression. However, intra-specific aggression may surely very readily express itself incidentally in work. The fact that the castigation of one's opponents seems to give an additional zest to academic activity might be taken as confirmation of this hypothesis. As to sport, it must be admitted that its effect on aggressive tendencies is by no means wholly or invariably to control or sublimate them. Sometimes at least it may actually increase the tension between two communities, and the pheno- menon of football hooliganism is clear evidence tlat it may actually cause or at least release harmful aggressive impulses among the spectators. Lorenz's causal analysis of the obvious human tendency to form mutually opposed groups has some disquieting consequences. We tend to assume without question what we feel very properly ought to be the case, that the strength of our moral feelings is due to the moral turpitude of our enemy. Lorenz's arguments, like those of the psychoanalysts, insinuate the un- pleasant suggestion that we often infer the badness of a group of people or set of ideas from the strength of the moral feelings we have about them. Another reflection is perhaps even more disquieting. It seems to be a corollary of Lorenz's theory that different human races are likely to differ from one another in the average intellectual and emotional endowments of individuals, since the palaeolithic inter-tribal struggle for survival would be liable to have affected different human groups in different ways. Lorenz himself cites the example of the Ute Indians, who he claims are as a race especially prone to certain types of neurosis. This particular claim has been shown, by one of the more careful and well-informed of Lorenz's critics, to be at least highly questionable. 1 But even if it were shown to 303</page><page sequence="15">PHILOSOPHY be false, the corollary I have deduced from Lorenz's theory is by no means disproved. I find its possible implications ideologically repulsive, but have not seen any convincing scientific objection to it. (To be sure, I have soen emotional objections made by scientists in the name of science: but this is another matter.) I do not think that anyone could with any show of plausibility use evidence of the kind adduced by Lorenz to sup- port any one of the varieties of racialism which have been influential up to now. And I would have thought that the evidence so far obtained makes it very reasonable to suppose that genetic and environmental differences between individuals are more important factors in determining intelligence and moral character than are differences of race. Yet one vital premise of racialism, that human races as such differ in their normal intellectual and moral capacity, does seem to find some support in Lorenz's work. It is, of course, abundantly proved that there is a positive correlation between the degree to which many animals, including man, are frustrated, and how aggressive they are. 12 But this does not by any means imply that if there were never any frustration in the environment of a man, he would never be aggressive at all. 13 And even supposing it were granted that if man were never irustrated, he would never be aggressive, it is surely almost inconceivable that the human environment could ever be controlled in such a way that no man was ever frustrated in anV, way. That inquiry into how we may diminish or sublimate our aggressive dispositions, and how we may avoid the frustrations which exacerbate them, is fruitless, is nowhere asserted by Lorenz; indeed a great deal of the final part of On Aggression is designed to impress upon the reader the urgency of just such research. Lorenz's outlook on the future of man is in some ways alarm- ing, but it is by no means hopeless; and even if it were hopeless, this would be no valid objection to the theory on which it is based. Some human societies, though indeed all too few, show no disposition to attack their neighbours, and little inclination for internal quarrelling. It would be valuable if this singular lack of aggression could be accounted for, and we could apply the moral to ourselves. Geoffrey Gorer has suggested that a number of such societies have two other characteristics in common: that their members show enormous gusto in concrete physical pleasures like eating, drinking, laughter and sexual intercourse; and that they make little distinction between their character ideals of men and women, and in particular cherish no ideal of brave, aggressive mascu- linity.14 The first may amount to an indication that the slogan 'Make love not war' has some justification beneath its prima facie absurdity; the second that the widespread contempt for womanish characteristics in men and mannish characteristics in women should at least be subjected to careful scrutiny. This paper has been a study of arguments, and an attempt to apply the results of one kind of enquiry to another. To that extent it has been philosophical. It is not really moral philosophy in the usual sense of the 304</page><page sequence="16">ETHOLOGY AND ETHICS phrase; to what extent this is a matter for apology I am not sure. But the question of what relevance it does have to moral philosophy strictly speaking is perhaps, in conclusion, worth raising. The intuitionist will find in Lorenz's book a causal account of how our intuitions of the moral properties of certain actions come to be as they are. I suppose the question of how far some of our 'intuitions', for instance of the goodness of the 'military virtues', can survive confrontation with such an account of their causation, is a psychological one. To the utilitarian, it may pro- vide grounds for thinking that some sorts of action which seemed in the light of previous evidence not to conduce to the greatest happiness of the greatest number-for instance, participation in dangerous or violent sport by those who wish to participate in it-do positively conduce to it. The extreme relativist, or the prescriptivist, or the non-naturalist, will not be compelled to acknowledge any strict derivation of 'ought' from 'is': but he may be impressed by the implied limitation to the range of ways of life which, as human beings, as creatures who have evolved in the way we have and with our consequent heritage of needs and desires, we can genuinely value and find valuable. The exponent of natural law, who has had rather a thin time of it in recent ethical discussions, may be rather heartened by Lorenz's conclusions. He could identify as constituting the 'natural law' those very general norms of behaviour which will tend to contribute to the well-being of individuals and the community in any form of society whatever. Lorenz's evidence and arguments would suggest that these amount to rather more than the average sociologist would perhaps care to admit.
