Emphasis is placed on illustrating how writings about Canis lupus relate to shifting evaluations of wild nature and ethical responsibili- ties towards the non-human. It further reflects upon the limits to 'knowing' other species, as well as the struggle between amateurs and professionals in the quest to be seen as authorities in zoological expertise. An intensely symbolic animal, the wolf has always been a popular character in folklore , a creature representative of our fears and our idealisations of wilderness. Although the rehabilitation of the wolf in twentieth-century America is conventionally framed in terms of the rise of ecological science, of the wolf as a keystone predator and integral part of a healthy ecosystem, the naturalist tradition of storytelling remains another key element in this development. Under scrutiny here are those nature stories that have encouraged a positive attitude towards wolves in North America - from Ernest Thompson Seton in the late 1 800s to Asta Bowen a century later. Such works suggest an important role for the storyteller as an educator in environ- mental values and contest the dominant paradigm of scientific observation as the 'saviour' of the wolf.

From James Fenimore Cooper to Edward Abbey, a cadre of distinguished literary figures have placed wilderness at the forefront of their stories. The natural world has acted as a platform for tales of pioneer endurance, biotic splendour, national redemption, individual expression and moral certitude. The wilderness experience provides North American literary tradition with one of its most distinctive features. In American writings on wilderness, one animal has attained a remarkable reso- nance - Canis lupus , or the grey wolf. The literary wolf is a deeply symbolic creature. It has become a 'carrier animal' for deeply felt sentiments of identity, progress, ethnicity and gender. Traditionally used by Euro- American authors to invoke fear and anxiety, the hideous reputation of the wolf led eighteenth- century naturalist Mark Catesby to deride the species as 'destructive' animals with 'dismal, yelling cries'. However, others came to write differently of their lupine experiences. Nineteenth-century transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau celebrated the howl for giving 'voice' to the wilderness. Since the post- 1945 environmental revolution, writers have used the wolf as a symbol of sacred ecological vitality. In 2009, the Internet bookstore Amazon.com listed over 1 27 ,587 titles concerning 'wolves' - a testament to the enduring appeal of Canis lupus in the North American eco-literary imagination.1 It is important to note that literary fascination with Canis lupus first emerged in Europe. Old World legends recounted how Romulus and Remus were suckled by a maternal she-wolf, while fables attributed to Greek slave Aesop branded lupine animals as wily. Medieval fairytales and fiery religious dogma defined wolves as demoniacal, lascivious and thoroughly brutal forms. Meanwhile, creation myths imparted by indigenous shamans attested to the wolf as a historic character in North American storytelling. The Tlingit of Alaska believed that they descended from two wolves that shed their skins to become human, while 'Big Wolf' of Blackfeet mythology imparted essential hunting skills to the tribe.2 In Waterland (1983), novelist Graham Swift posited that 'only animals live entirely in the Here and Now. Only nature knows neither memory nor history.' Biologists have since shown Canis lupus to be a highly intelligent species, capable of remembering detailed geographic information. Prominent North American writers have also refuted the notion of the wolf as an animal without memory or history, drawing on mythology, artistic license and environmental tenets to explore the nature of the beast. In the annals of North American na- ture writing, the wolf has often been configured as a faunal totem signifying untamed terrain and untamed spirit. Many works of fiction have situated Canis lupus as a dominant protagonist in a separate realm of nature, a verdant domain visited by humans solely for the purposes of conquest or recreation.

Environment and History 17 .2</page><page sequence="3">203 WRITING THE WOLF expositions on wilderness have featured wolves as criminals and luminaries, aggressors and victims, creatures of instinct and individual thinkers. Such variegated definitions of canine temperament attest to shifting cultural attitudes over the direction of modern society, the place of humans in nature and popular environmental thinking.3 This article explores the relationship between literature and environmental values by examining the portrayal of wolves in North American texts from the late nineteenth century onwards. Of particular interest are those figures that contributed to a positive canon of lupine storytelling. The writings of Ernest Thompson Seton and Jack London in the late nineteenth century; Farley Mowat and Roger Caras in the 1960s; and Whitley Strieber, Cormac McCarthy and Asta Bowen in the late twentieth century contain descriptions of intelligent canine protagonists that countered the images of bestial excess in traditional Euro- American wolf tales. The 'realistic animal story' genre of the Victorian era, coupled with environmentalist treatises of the 1 960s and recovery narratives in the 1990s forwarded the rehabilitation of Canis lupus from despised varmint to American faunal hero. The historiography on wolves in North America has typically cited scientific erudition, empirical analysis and ecological models as catalysts for species re-evaluation. Thomas Dunlap, in Saving America 's Wildlife ( 1988), situated the redemption of the 'big bad wolf' in the professionalisation of the wildlife community and emerging debates about biotic health and integrity in the interwar period. For Jon T. Coleman, 'scientific observation' countered the prejudice of past ideas founded on 'folklore and property', while evolutionary biology itself served to explain our ancestral hostility to the wolf as a competing apex predator. Instead, this article points to the value of storytelling, of emotion, visualisation and connection as rhetorical guides to action in framing our (posi- tive) engagements with other species. Read in this fashion, the landmark return of the wolf to Yellowstone in 1995 signalled not the revolt of science against the allied forces of folklore, ritual and prejudice but the emergence of a new story about Canis lupus. Meanwhile, as both scientists and writers redefined or 'retold' their paradigms of the wolf they engaged in a competitive struggle for environmental authority, grappling for sway over the public mind based on the figurative polarities of 'science' versus 'sentiment'. This tension, often construed in binaries of the professional/amateur and the objective/subjective played out in debates surrounding the 'realistic animal story' and, as I argue here, proved a recurring feature of dialogues about animal authority through the twentieth century. The article concludes by making a further, more elemental, contention regarding the salience of the science-sentiment demarcation itself and the possibility of 'knowing' the wolf. Adolph Murie, in his pioneering ecological study The Wolves of Mount McKinley (1944), repeatedly referred to the 'friendliness' of the pack while many literary figures sported backgrounds in empirical natural history. Despite the assertion of wolf biologist L. David Mech 3. Graham Swift, Waterland, (London, 1983), p. 53. Environment and History 1 7 .2</page><page sequence="4">204 KAREN JONES that science espouses 'a clearer, more objective view of animals', the goal to present animals 'as they really are' represented a common aim for both scientist and storyteller. Significantly, however, authorial claims of detachment always fell short, whether written up as biological report or short story. Narratives about the wolf reflect changing cultural ideas, technical expertise, environmental values and ethical judgments. For all the lofty claims to 'get inside the skin' of the wolf - a practice literally adopted by Lakota hunters seeking to hunt bison on the American Plains - tales about Canis lupus often tell us a great deal more about Homo sapiens .4 'INTO THE PRIMITIVE': SETON, LONDON, AND THE CULT OF THE WILD Nature stories proved immensely popular in late nineteenth-century American society. As well as engaging in pursuits of taxidermy, painting, ornithology and woodcraft, citizens displayed an avid interest in the natural world by eagerly digesting tales of the wild. Ralph Lutts classified this fervent curiosity in nature as 'a public environmental awakening equalled only by the great reawakening later in the twentieth century'. For an increasingly urbanised society with concerns over the debilitating smog of industrial progress, nature served as a wholesome Arcadian refuge. Thousands of urbanites escaped the city using the bookstore as well as the railroad, satiating their desires for spiritual renewal and nostalgic romanticism in textual and material landscapes alike. Victorian fascination with nature also reflected a society wrestling with metaphysical questions regarding evolutionary theory and the place of Homo sapiens in the natural world. Biologi- 4.

Environment and History 1 7 .2</page><page sequence="5">205 WRITING THE WOLF cal theories promulgated by the likes of Herbert Spencer, Charles Darwin and August Weismann posited nature as an amoral realm where humans and other animals engaged in elemental struggles for existence.5 The rise of the 4 realistic animal story ' genre in the 1 890s revealed an American populace eager to immerse themselves in matters of natural order, the survival of the fittest and questions of morality in nature. Readers sought to learn about the habits and lifestyles of their 'horizontal brothers' . Canis lupus emerged as a prominent character in these tales. The life of a predator afforded ideal literary terrain for writers to expound on 'nature red in tooth and claw' , natural selection and the unending struggle for subsistence. The hunt also served as a vehicle for dramatic literary action, allowing authors to revel in the thrill of the chase and the choreography of faunal protagonists. Offering narratives told 'from the animal's point of view', writers combined biological observations with artistic prose to forge evocative depictions of non-human life. While scientists had raised fundamental questions regarding the connections between people and other animals, storytellers assumed the task of exploring how canine brethren lived and reasoned.6 Canadian naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton proved an instrumental figure in the establishment of the 'realistic animal story' genre. Seton published Wild Animals I Have Known , a collection of faunal life histories, in 1898. The first edition - with its suitably rough-hewn cover offering sketches of wolf heads, pawprints, a rabbit and raven - received copious acclaim for its sympathetic portrayal of non-human protagonists. The inaugural print run of 2,000 copies sold out in three weeks. The Canadian naturalist asserted the realistic nature of his depictions, positing drama, emotion and tragedy as essential features of the natural canvas. The first lines of Wild Animals I Have Known read, 'These stories are true ... the animals in this book were all real characters. They lived the lives I have depicted, and showed the stamp of heroism and personality more strongly by far than it has been in the power of my pen to tell.' The first story in the collection, 'Lobo: King of Currampaw', related the tale of a grand outlaw wolf and his 'reign of terror' as a cattle rustler in the American Southwest. Seton based the yarn on his experiences as a trapper at the Fitz-Randolph ranch, New Mexico, where he spent four months in 1 893^4 in pursuit of the Mexican wolf that locals had christened 'Lobo'. The sojourn in the desert proved a seminal experience, deepening Seton 's his interest in wild canines and ushering in a personal commitment to their preservation. He later used the nickname 'Wolf' and the mark of a pawprint as a signature, suggesting a sense of empathy and a symbolic transgression from human to animal identity.7 'Lobo: King of Currumpaw' conveyed the story of an extraordinary faunal protagonist. Seton crafted the character of Lobo as a suitably rugged and roman- 5 . Lutts , Nature Fakers , pp. i x-x . 6. Mighetto, 'Science, Sentiment, and Anxiety ,p.48. 7.

Lobo was a charismatic beast, a 'king' who ruled the Currumpaw using 'despotic power'. He was, albeit in four-legged form, a testament to frontier lore as championed by Frederick Jackson Turner. Lupine peers respected Lobo for his cunning and strength. Cattlemen balked at his commanding howl. Seton's creation of Lobo highlighted a literary imperative to create an enigmatic lead character that readers would embrace. It also reflected a general tendency of pro-wolf stories to focus on the individual as a way to induce audience familiarity, identification and assist communication. Seton's outlaw wolf inspired readers to connect with his personality, particular actions and individualistic motivations. This stood in contrast to traditional frontier presentations of the wolf as part of a pack, an undifferentiated mob ruled by bloodlust. Where pioneer newspapers spoke of the lurking threat of wolf packs at the margins of frontier settlement - the Edmonton Journal carried an article in 1925 about a mob of dastardly wolves preventing residents of the town of Vilna, Alberta attending dances after dark - Seton focused on the singular animal as a definable, charismatic, knowable and far less dangerous entity.8 Moreover, the desire to emphasise Lobo's 'real personality . . . and his view of life' reflected Seton's unease with contemporary scientific discourse that framed humans and animals solely in terms of species. While Lobo appeared a truly Darwinian hero, an animal whose physical strength and vigour assured his pre-eminence, Seton took pains to craft his leading lupine as a unique, noble creature, capable of outstanding acts of compassion. For Seton, the ability of animals to perform remarkable feats disavowed Darwinist visions of nature as a domain governed by obdurate natural forces where individuals mattered little.9 Seton employed the character of the wolf to elaborate on his rich definition of wilderness. In the writer's cult of the wild, untamed landscapes exhibited spiritual truths and communicated virtuous principles. Nature represented a beneficent realm governed by moral laws. Asked to expound on his theory of life, Seton reputedly advised, 'take two trips into the wilderness each year, and spend six months on each trip'. The wolf represented the central performer in Seton's romanticised wild, the canine soul embodying the freedom and vital- ity of pristine nature. In 'Lobo: King of Currumpaw', the drama of raw nature was elucidated by acts of predation. Seton's detailed descriptions of hunting activities and graphic illustrations showed the wolf as a masterful predator and the author as an empirical naturalist. While contemporary nature writers such as John Muir and William Long ignored, even denied, the existence of pain in the natural world, Seton savoured the predatory prowess of Canis lupus. Many nineteenth-century humanitarians denigrated wild carnivores as contemptible killers, yet Seton perceived death at the fangs of a wolf or the talons of an owl as 'wholly kind' . The Canadian writer successfully wrested the contest between 8. Seton, Wild Animals, p. 17; See Calgary Herald , 18 Mar. 1925. 9. Seton, Wild Animals , p. 9. Environment and History 17.2</page><page sequence="7">207 WRITING THE WOLF predator and prey from the jaws of modish scientific dogma, positing nature as competitive and cruel, and incorporated it within his moral conception of a cooperative, benevolent natural world. For Seton, that 'every animal has some great strength or it could not live, and some great weakness or the others could not live' illuminated divine order rather than competition in nature.10 Seton situated the tale of Lobo within an elemental conflict between wolves and humans . In their quest to dominate the Currumpaw range , ranchers construed Lobo and his pack as a 4 destructive band' , viewing the lead wolf's guileful pursuit of cattle as the act of a 'grizzly devastator' . Lobo, meanwhile, gloried in routing his two-legged adversaries and engaged in sheep-killing sprees for sheer exhilaration . This was, put simply, the Turnerian struggle for the frontier - between savagery (the wolf) and civilisation (the cowboy). While Seton regarded the predatory nature of Canis lupus as natural, Lobo and his fellow canines were stigmatised for preying on domestic stock. The naturalist thus established rules of faunal conduct, positing Lobo as a 'bad' animal whose wanton behaviour signified a moral crime. The ensuing contest between the trapper and Lobo embodied a grand narrative of man against nature, civilised Homo sapiens pitted against the great wilderness hunter. The inevitable triumph of one predator at the expense of the other added pathos. The writer provided a clue as to the denouement of his canine melodrama at the start of Wild Animals I Have Known , noting that, 'the life of a wild animal always has a tragic end ' - a phrase resonant with a sense of inevitability about the victory of two-legged over four-legged heroes. Lobo and his faunal guerillas seemed doomed to fall before sapient forces, as soon as humans learned woodcraft skills (in other words became adapted to the frontier). On finally capturing Lobo, Seton (assuming the role of the trapper) mused: 'Grand old outlaw, hero of a thousand lawless raids, in a few minutes you will be a great load of carrion. It cannot be otherwise.' Emblematic of an archaic order, the wolf was destined to pass into history.11 Although the fate of the outlaw wolf illuminated the enmity between Homo sapiens and Canis lupus , civilisation and the wild, the character of Lobo exuded distinctly human qualities. Seton's portrayal of Lobo as an individual thinker capable of hate and love demonstrated the author's belief in the similitude of humans and other species. He proclaimed, 'We and the beasts are kin. Man has nothing that the animals have not at least a vestige of, the animals have noth- ing that man does not in some degree share.' This desire for kinship embroiled the author in ethical questions. A deepening empathy with native carnivores, combined with regret at his actions towards Lobo, instilled in Seton a heartfelt concern for animal welfare. In the naturalist's conception of an ordered nature bound by inalienable laws, humans were obligated to act responsibly towards the environment. Moreover, Seton articulated a fervent belief in animal rights, asserting: 'Since, then, the animals are creatures with wants and feelings differ- 10. Seton, Wild Animals , pp. xii, 358, 206. 1 1 . Seton, Wild Animals, pp. 21 , 29, 12, 5 1 . Environment and History 17.2</page><page sequence="8">208 KAREN JONES ing in degree only from our own, they surely have their rights' . Demonstrating a nascent biocentrism, he argued 'What right has a man to inflict such long and fearful agony on a fellow-creature, simply because that creature does not speak his language?'12 Seton received praise from contemporary critic Charles Koifoid for his sympathetic stories of 'animal friends' . The book fused skills in art, writing and amateur naturalism, and drew significant public acclaim. However, a group of literary notaries derided Seton as a 'nature faker' and criticised him for posit- ing themes of lupine passion and reason. Amateurs and professionals involved in wildlife study locked horns over the relationship between scientific surveys (read as objective) and the vocation of the naturalist (read as a hobby, fed by emotion). President Theodore Roosevelt chastised Seton for his sentimental interpretation of canine social mechanics, while naturalist John Burroughs sug- gested an alternative title for Seton 's bestseller, Wild Animals I ALONE Have Known. Defending the efficacy of his depictions, Seton railed: 'Those who do not know the animals well may think I have humanized them, but those who have lived so near them as to know somewhat of their ways and their minds will not think so.' This was a contest about the authority of the naturalist to impart credible zoological information. Crucially, it came at a time when scientific ideas about wolves themselves were in flux. Although Seton's portrayal of wild mustangs committing suicide and vixens poisoning their cubs to spare them from capture strained the limits of credulity, descriptions of lupine intelligence and pack bonding were verified by biologists in subsequent years. Biologists in Montana in the early 1980s even found evidence of wolves burying dead pups - a supposition that would certainly have been scoffed at by the professional wildlife community in the early 1900s. Judged in this light, Seton's struggle to accurately impart canine life represented a challenge of storytelling and of sci- ence - namely, how to extrapolate the non-human experience without recourse to anthropomorphism or sociological extrapolations.13 Published in 1903 and 1906 respectively, The Call of the Wild and White Fang communicated Jack London's attempts to explore canine consciousness. The companion novels, one dealing with a dog's attempts to adjust to life in the Alaskan wilds , the other considering the experiences of an Arctic wolf forced into a domestic sphere, offered a canine perspective on issues of evolution, species behaviour and environmental conditioning. Based on London's extended trip to the Klondike gold fields in 1897-8, the lively depictions of Northern life in The Call of the Wild and White Fang brought the author international renown. London's fascination with Cards lupus added to his enigma as a writer. In com- 12. Seton, Wild Animals, pp. 12, 13,357. 13.

Environment and History 17.2</page><page sequence="9">209 WRITING THE WOLF mon with Seton, London indulged his obsession with the wolf by surrounding himself with lupine motifs. George Sterling knew the writer by the epithet 'Wolf' and London christened his retreat in Sonoma Valley, California 'Wolf House', suggesting, like Seton, an authorial affinity with the animal and a subconscious desire to take on a lupine metaphorical identity.14 London sought to narrate the stories of Buck and White Fang from a four- legged vantage point, extrapolating the responses of his central protagonists as they navigated between wilderness and civilisation. Far from animated ma- chines, London configured his canine characters as inquisitive explorers. On witnessing snow for the first time, Buck 'sniffed it curiously, then licked some up on his tongue. It bit like fire, and the next instant was gone. This puzzled him.' Learning to survive in the harsh Alaskan snows, the hero of The Call of the Wild demonstrated a capacity not only to classify experiences as favourable and unfavourable but also to ponder his fate and make moral judgments regard- ing the behaviour of others. London strayed further into the territory of canine empathy in White Fang by describing the intimate thoughts of a newborn pup. White Fang's first cognitive sensations comprised elemental urges, desires to strain towards the light, to avoid pain, to satisfy hunger. Later, he learned the joys of hunting, describing his education in superlatives of 'unending happiness' and 'elation'. In his musings on the nature of lupine thought, London betrayed an interest in contemporary scientific debates concerning the ability of animals to reason. Through the mediums of Buck and White Fang, London characterised Canis lupus as a species 'not given to thinking - at least, to the kind of thinking customary of men', yet capable of reaching 'sharp and distinct' conclusions. Significantly, the astute senses and inveterate survival skills possessed by wild canines fostered a natural wariness of Homo sapiens. From the perspective of a wolf, the human world represented a hostile environment of strange smells, infernal noise and cranking electric vehicles that London inventively termed 'colossal screaming lynxes'. Through the yellow eyes of their leading protago- nists, The Call of the Wild and White Fang thus offered readers a rare gaze at human culture as 'the other'.15 The American public applauded The Call of the Wild and White Fang for their innovative, 'insider' viewpoint on canine society. However, London's lit- erary animalism betrayed significant flaws. Buck and White Fang represented idealised versions of canine protagonists, their mental musings an inevitable reflection of how London thought he would feel incarnated in lupine form. In describing how blood coursed through Buck's veins during his first hunt or the awe experienced by White Fang on witnessing the city of San Francisco, London articulated his own sentiments on wilderness and civilisation: offering an essentially sociological reading of animal behaviour, based around a Darwin- 14.

Environment and History 17.2</page><page sequence="10">210 KAREN JONES ian conception of man as a fighting animal. The writer configured his canine heroes as extraordinary individuals, great 4 men' who displayed ideal masculine traits in keeping with the gender and scientific norms of the time. Master of his California estate, Buck was 'king over all creeping, crawling, flying things of Judge Miller's place, humans included'. The eponymous cub of White Fang appeared 'different from his brothers and sisters . . . bred true to the straight wolf stock.' Portrayed as canine supermen, what London scholar Alfred Kazin dubbed 'Nietzschean hounds', Buck and White Fang exhibited humanised qualities of loyalty, courage , strength and resourcefulness . When London noted how ' hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his [Buck's] muscles', he imparted the ecstasy and vigour of the chase as imagined by the late nineteenth-century sportsman rather than the lupine hunter.16 In London's cult of the wild, nature denoted a brutal proving ground for individual fortitude. White Fang commenced with a fervid pack preying on hapless travellers, with the icy landscape labelled as 'the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild' . The Call of the Wild similarly identified the Alaskan tundra as a desolate, silent realm, given voice by the actions of strong- willed men and spirited wolves. This was the stage on which Herbert Spencer's scientific theory and Frederick Jackson Turner's frontier thesis converged to create an ultimate venue of competition, masculinity and action. Images of hostile nature exaggerated the heroism of London's characters in a manner akin to triumphal narratives about westward expansionism. In the author's striking prose, Buck and White Fang resembled rugged canine pioneers pitting their wits against unyielding environmental forces. For London, the wild represented a competitive domain of primal fear, mortal conflict and physicality. It also served as a spectacular setting for romantic adventurism. As London noted on Buck's arrival in Alaska, 'He had been suddenly jerked from the heart of civilization and flung into the heart of all things primordial. No lazy, sun-kissed life was this ... All was confusion and action, and every moment life and limb were in peril . ' For London , as with Seton , the western frontier was the place for dramatic change, both biological and historical.17 The experiences of Buck and White Fang as they struggled to assimilate the worlds of wildness and domesticity represented a moral parable on the role of instinct versus conditioning in determining individual character. The primor- dial impulses lurking in Buck and White Fang reflected on humanity's bestial nature. For London, the 'Call of the Wild' conjured a world of primitive desire, instinct and natural virtue. Wolfishness emerged as a potent signifier for the brutal simplicity of wilderness life. When White Fang engaged in his inaugural hunt, he realised the truth of his existence, 'that for which he was made - killing meat and battling to kill it' . London glorified the incipient carnality of the law 16. London, Call of the Wild , pp. 44, 221 ; Alfred Kazin, On Native Grounds (New York, 1942); London, Call of the Wild , p. 45. 17.

His stories were predicated on the wolf as a carrier of carnivorous carnality and thus subscribed to notions of therophobia - the fear of wild beasts - com- mon to traditional Euro- American wolf tales, albeit beneath a modish coating of 'survival of the fittest' dogma. In losing his civilised veneer, Buck became fully alive, discarding 'moral' nature as 'a vain thing and a handicap in the ruth- less struggle for existence' in favour of 'sounding the deeps of his nature' . The savagery of the Alaskan wilds augmented Buck's physical prowess and steeped him in primordial wisdom. Significantly, London's rhapsody to atavism reflected the writings of Spencer and Darwin on science and romantic naturalism. The writer perceived Buck's metamorphosis into a wilderness creature fully present in the joy of living as genetically, naturally and historically self-fulfilling: 'He linked the past with the present, and the eternity behind him throbbed through him in a mighty rhythm to which he swayed as the tides and seasons swayed.' 18 Despite his attention to wilderness iconography and obsession with canine heroics, Jack London articulated a belief in the benefits of moral, civilised life. In the writer's Darwinian vernacular, civilisation represented the pinnacle of evolutionary dynamics , humans asserting rightful control over the rest of nature by virtue of their unbridled power. Even Buck and White Fang endorsed the higher position of sapient protagonists in the natural hierarchy by deeming humans as 'gods' , suggesting that even when afforded agency and voice, non-human narra- tives and experience remained dominated by Homo sapiens. Crucially, London judged that society should act as a benevolent steward towards its human and faunal charges - a principle that illuminated the author's socialistic leanings and his love of nature: political economy and ecology conjoined. Moreover, in describing White Fang 's transition from embittered predator to a 'Blessed Wolf' , eking out a lazy existence in sun-kissed California, London explored the impact of human compulsions on canine character. While the brutalising tutelage of dog-owner Beauty Smith bred cruelty and ferocity in White Fang, the compas- sionate attentions of subsequent master Weedon Scott brought a contentment that he had craved since the family den . As an upstanding and kind-hearted white American, Scott represented a model citizen in London's altruistic world. Scott identified his crusade to redeem 'mankind from the wrong it had done White Fang' as 'a matter of principle and conscience'. Thereby articulating a popu- lar humanitarian precept, London insisted that human protagonists brutalised themselves and tainted the characters of their victims through acts of barbarity, a common motif in humanist/animal rights literature of the period and manifest in writings from Henry Bergh's 'Declaration of the Rights of Animals' ( 1 866) to Anna Sewell's Black Beauty (1877). The Call of the Wild and White Fang thus imparted powerful lessons in congeniality, urging a need for humans to behave with civility towards the animals with which they shared a common heritage.19 18.

Environment and History 17.2</page><page sequence="12">212 KAREN JONES In an essay entitled The Other Animals', London addressed the reception to his tales amongst the natural history fraternity, thereby highlighting issues of truth and authority on animal matters. As he remonstrated Time and again, and many times, in my narratives, I wrote, speaking of my dog-heroes: "He did not think these things; he merely did them" etc. And I did this repeatedly, to the clogging of my narrative and in violation of my artistic canons; and I did it in order to hammer into the average human understanding that the dog-heroes of mine were not directed by abstract reasoning, but by instinct, sensation, and emotion, and by simple reasoning.' The author had subdued his storytell- ing impulses in favour of imparting the rubric of evolutionary thought to his readers. This was the science of natural selection, condensed and spat out for populist consumption (for instance, the rapid evolutionary dynamics that Buck encountered were in stark contrast to Herbert Spencer's assertions that no one individual would be aware of the subtleties of such a process). Meanwhile, London countered critics Theodore Roosevelt and John Burroughs by stressing his empirical (and thus scientific) approach to wolf behaviour, having assessed his dogs Rollo and Glen as canine subjects for evidence of reasoned thinking. His essay ended acerbically: 4 You must not deny your relatives, the other ani- mals. Their history is your history. What you repudiate in them you repudiate in yourself - a pretty spectacle, truly, of an exalted animal striving to disown the stuff of life out of which it is made . . . That may be good egotism, but it is not good science.' Such debates pointed to the kudos attached to scientific method as a method of 'knowing' the animal and, more critically, elucidated the role of the wolf as a totemic carrier for discussions about society and its relationship to the natural world.20 Both Seton and London insisted their writings were about wolves and not men and consciously advertised their efforts in terms of animal advocacy. In this arena, they achieved much. However, Lobo, Buck and White Fang said as much about humans as they did about wolves. As Joan London remarked, her father was not aware until much later of 'the human allegory in the dog's life- and-death struggle to adapt himself to a hostile environment'. In the case of 'Lobo: King of Currampaw', The Call cfthe Wild and White Fang , Seton and London essentialised three key debates under review in American intellectual and popular culture. The reworking of the wolf from demonic savagery to iconic savagery highlighted contemporary fascinations with rugged landscapes and the great outdoors, as demonstrated in the formation of Yellowstone National Park (1872) and the Boone and Crockett Club (1887); spoke of the veneration of the American West as a crucible of action, freedom and abandon, as expounded in the historical analysis of Frederick Jackson Turner, the writing of Theodore Roosevelt and Owen Winter and the lurid sensationalism of dime novel pulp fiction; and howled out scientific philosophies of natural selection, instinct 20.

As contemporary nature writer John Burroughs perceptively noted, 'True it is that all the animals whose lives are portrayed . . . are simply human beings disguised as animals'.21 'THE IDEALIZED STORY OF A WOLF FAMILY': MOWAT, CARAS AND THE NURTURING OF ECOLOGICAL CONSCIENCE In portraying wolves as intelligent and gracious animals, Seton and London challenged traditional Euro-American perceptions of wild carnivores as wanton killers. Their books served an important conservationist purpose in highlighting the positive character traits of a much-maligned species. Yet, as Ralph Lutts pointed out, 'the nature lover and nature fakers had great difficulty linking their new vision of nature and wildlife with the real animals in a real, evolving ecological setting'. By configuring wolves as fantastic characters in tales of tragedy and adventure, both Seton and London failed to comment on preservation issues affecting wild predators in the material landscape. Their canine supermen reflected contemporary interests in the survival of the fittest, natural selection and competition - seen in scientific dogma, outdoors crazes, theories on national progress and, of course, race and eugenics. Focus remained on the individual masculine hero. From the 1920s and 1930s, the development of ecological science afforded new opportunities for writing the wolf in a functional, biotic context. Interestingly, pioneer ecologist Charles Elton saw a direct line of ascent from his emergent discipline and prior writings from the naturalist community: 'Ecology is a new name for a very old subject. It simply means scientific natural history' . In terms of Canis lupus , fresh discourses from wildlife biologists Paul Errington, Aldo Leopold and Adolph Murie situated the species as an important ecological agent in North American wild landscapes and a vital component to biotic health. The pack also earned redefinition as a social organisation rather than a random, slavering mass, consciously referenc- ing not only developments in animal ecology but also sociological discussions in the 1950s about the dynamics of the nuclear family, systems theory, gender norms and rituals of stability and socialisation. Meanwhile, the environmental revolution of the 1960s contributed a sense of humans as eminently destructive forces and argued for a more respectful, ethical relationship with the natural world. These themes of ecological integrity, group dynamics and biocentric conscience provided the framework for a new genre of North American wolf literature in the 1960s. Employing scientific theory and artistic verve, a cadre of literary environmentalists imparted salient lessons on the state of modern, 2 1 .

Loosely based on the author's personal experiences working for the Dominion Wildlife Service in the Northwest Ter- ritories during the 1940s, Never Cry Wolf told the story of a greenhorn biologist dispatched to the Canadian wilds to document the interactions between wolves and caribou. In writing Never Cry Wolf , Mowat had originally intended to expose bureaucratic ineptitude in the Canadian government, yet soon became captivated by his lupine narrative. In a testament to the ability of wild canines to inspire literary passions, Mowat noted, 'Eventually the wolf took the book right out of my hands so that it became a plea for understanding, and preser- vation, of an extraordinarily highly evolved and attractive animal which was, and is, being harried into extinction by the murderous enmity and proclivities of man'. Mowat's environmental treatise proved immensely popular, winning many converts to the lupine cause.23 The allure of Mowat's canine fable lay in its consistency with a trope of American nature literature, the retreat into wilderness as a spiritual journey. In Mowat's wilderness sojourn, the wolf signified an erudite guide to nature, a totem animal that drew the biologist away from rationalist dictates and Euro- American prejudice and towards a more empathic, reverential, and indigenous percep- tion of the land. In common with Seton and London, Mowat crafted the North American wilderness as character-building terrain. By learning the laws of the wild, the young biologist acquired woodcraft skills, questioned his metropolitan values and embraced a more nature-centred existence. Spiritual epiphany came through engagement with a local wolf pack, whose well-ordered social routines and affable personalities railed against the biologist's preconceptions of wolves as bloodthirsty killers. Alone in the wild, contemplating his intra-species com- munications over a glass of 'Wolf Juice' (a heady blend of preserving alcohol and beer), the scientist confessed, 'Inescapably, the realization was being borne 22.

He duly resolved to 'go open-minded into the lupine world and learn to see and know the wolves, not for what they were supposed to be, but for what they actually were' - empiricism once more invoked as the best way to 'know' the non-human.24 Immersing himself in lupine social conventions, Mowat (as the biologist) engaged in scent marking, howling, and hunting, living life as a pseudo wolf in the Canadian North. Despite his paeans to 'knowing the wolf', the writer nonetheless relied on methods of humanisation to bring his lupine characters to life. Eager to dispel hackneyed images of Canis lupus as a savage and ferocious beast, Mowat conjured the wolf as an irrepressible, friendly predator. This nar- rative of fun, familiarity and frolic represented a frequent device in visual and textual communications about animals - witness Disney's natural history and animated productions of the 1 950s, the Adams' Born Free feline soap opera saga of the 1960s and Jean Craighead George's work of juvenile fiction, Julie of the Wolves (1972). Such works humanised the beast for the purposes of entertain- ment, empathy and environmental rehabilitation, as well as creating a narrative structure in which to situate animal behaviour. Anthropomorphism offered a route towards cross-species identification and advocacy, even though the ability to 'cross' into the world of the wolf meant transforming that social terrain into a human one. Thus Never Cry Wolf presented the pack as a humanised band of endearing , anthropomorphic figures - a nuclear family that fitted the social mores of the 1 950s more than the nature of lupine society. Mowat freely admitted the sentimentality of his portrayal but attributed it to the irrefutable appeal of his canine actors: 'As I grew completely attuned to their daily round of family life I found it increasingly difficult to maintain an impersonal attitude towards the wolves. No matter how hard I tried to regard them with scientific objectivity, I could not resist the impact of their individual personalities.' George, the alpha male, signified an 'eminently regal beast' while Angeline, the alpha female, was 'equally memorable ... beautiful, ebullient, passionate'.25 The focus on family life in Never Cry Wolf conveyed a powerful ecologi- cal narrative that prioritised interaction and community over competition and struggle. Whereas London had concentrated on individual protagonists honing survival skills in the face of natural adversity, Farley Mowat looked to the pack for lessons in biotic community and social structure. Buck's sled team operated according to a coercive hierarchy where the strong dominated the weak, whereas the Canadian pack living in 'Wolf House Bay' worked as a cohesive unit.

According to Mowat's vernacular, predation was not a ferocious contest but a mutual engagement that ensured natural balance. Never Cry W?//* thereby translated the mantras of ecological science - trophic levels, bioenergetics, mutualism and biocoenosis - into a popular framework, bringing Elton's 'scientific natural history' back into a cultural domain. Likewise, the book broadcast powerful sociological messages about the role of the family in socialisation, patterns of community harmony, and typical gender roles. The Canadian North thus represented a prelapsarian landscape of symmetry rather than strife. A modern industrial society driven by a domineering attitude towards the environment represented the villain of Never Cry Wolf. Mowat configured the Northern wilderness, a harmonious world that 'belonged to the deer, the wolves, and the smaller beasts', as a landscape under threat from trigger-happy sports- men and deluded government bureaucrats. In this eco-parable, wilderness and civilisation existed as literal oppositions, the wolf and the human destined to clash in the Arctic just as in the Currumpaw. However, Mowat refused to view the real- world demise of Canis lupus as acceptable or inevitable. Cognisant of the power of literary pathos to rouse sympathy for species preservation, Mowat deliberately crafted Never Cry Wolfio impart a tangible environmental message: ensuring that his work offered a blend of traditional romantic naturalism and modern environmental protest. As he noted in the preface, 'it may be that there is still time to prevent mankind from committing yet another in the long list of his crimes against nature'. The author elucidated his literary-environmental supplication in a curt epilogue, explaining how government control agents placed cyanide guns outside the den at 'Wolf House Bay' in May 1959. In its succinct and sanitised prose, the epilogue offered a distinct change of style from the jocular sentimentalism of previous chapters. Designed to shock readers into environmental activism, the last line of Never Cry WfoZ/read: 'it is not known what results were obtained'.26 Never Cry Wolf became an instant bestseller and went on to sell more than a million copies. The Toronto Globe &amp; Mail noted that wolves 'owed Mowat a debt of gratitude for rescuing their reputation ' . Readers warmed to its entertaining pace, populist romanticism, intuitive engagement with nature and accessible, ecologically-informed narrative. Mowat's intimacy with the pack fostered empathy and concern, while his stylistic allusions to scientific credibility - a first-hand vantage on the 'real' wolf via field study of a pack at Nueltin Lake in 1948-9 - garnered him authority to speak for the wolf in the estimation of mainstream society. Growing public criticism of modernity, the power of the state and social conformity in the 1960s fomented interest in Mowat's discourse of the lone whistleblower standing up against a misguided bureaucratic appara- tus. In fact, the book prompted a keen letter- writing campaign to the Canadian Wildlife Service in defence of the wolf that continued through the 1960s and 26. Mowat, Never Cry Wolf , pp. 126, vii, 164.

Many respondents credited the book with changing their opinions on Canis lupus and highlighted its educational value. Readers consistently praised Mowat for speaking truth to power and situated the fate of the wolf in a broader environmental malaise threatening the entire planet. Others articulated an ani- mal rights narrative that emphasised the barbaric nature of humanity and put forward a radical liberationist agenda along the lines of contemporaneous works by Christopher Stone and Peter Singer. As one letter asserted, 'wolves are not the vicious killers that some authors pictured them as. We are! Yes us . . . Man. Preacher of peace. User of violence.'27 A signal of its popular currency, Never Cry Wolf made it to the big screen courtesy of Disney Pictures in 1983. Directed by Carroll Ballard, the feature contained all the hallmarks of the Disney brand: a sweeping moralistic meta- narrative, comedic asides and anthropomorphised animals playing family. Never Cry Wolf stayed relatively true to its original source in focusing on the encroachment of civilisation-capitalism on the mystical-intuitive North, the fallacy of the 'wolf threat' to the caribou and the adventures of the biologist hero. Notably, it made a few adjustments. The hunt was relatively bloodless, with the pack gently picking off a weak and sickened animal (German Shepherds with hairspray 'stood in' as wolves) and the movie rejected the negativity of the novel's epilogue and its insinuations of canine pogrom. Never Cry Wolf the movie readily subscribed to the contemporary formula of Disney's 'True Life Adventure' nature pseudo-documentary series (the best comparison being White Wilderness , 1 958) in its emphasis on the observation of the scientist, the detailed beauty of the landscape, dramatic storytelling, and conservation message and stress on faunal personalities. Intimate photography and characterisations lent the movie a realist cachet that duped the audience into feeling they were 'see- ing the real wolf' rather than anthropomorphised humanoids. As the New York Times extrapolated 'the three animals Tyler comes to call George, Angeline and Uncle Albert emerge as real characters who watch Tyler when he doesn't realize it, but only allow him to watch them when they choose. Their habits structure Tyler's days, and in the end they propel the film's dramatic climax'. The film offered a visual broadcast of nature lore from the days of Seton, of a moral fable about animal celebrities writ large for an urban audience looking for celluloid escapism. This fusion of education and entertainment, saccharine coating and social instruction, exemplified 'Disneyfication' at work: talking animals dispensing moral lessons to America's youth and serving as 'mirror' for social commentary. Meanwhile, prime 'Mickey Mouse' moments included montages of the biologist dining on mice stew to the cutesy squeals of watching rodents. Variety magazine paid heed to the movie's placement in the American naturalist tradition and to its fresh injection of Disney whimsy: 'No biologist is 27.

And, if he was, he should have taken Jack London's Call of the Wild along with him to read in his spare time.'28 In contrast, the scientific community reacted to Never Cry Wolf with un- bridled vitriol, replaying the terse debates that had raged over the so-called 'nature fakers' of the late nineteenth century. Biologist A. W. Banfield noted the popular appeal of the book in asserting that 4 not since Little Red Riding Hood has a story been written that will influence the attitude of so many toward these animals' but added a sharp disclaimer: 'both stories have about the same factual content' . Mowat earned criticism for passing himself off as an expert when he had logged only ninety hours in the field. In the words of biologist C. H. D. Clarke, he was 'a raconteur posing as a scientist'. Douglas Pimlott called Never Cry Wolf ' a satire' and Wildlife Service employees took to calling Mowat 'Hardly Knowit'. But why such enmity? Surely Mowat was aiding the cause of wolf conservation? Herein lay the problem. The scientific community viewed the replacement of the 'big bad wolf' of traditional tales with Mowat's much-maligned 'good wolf' as a problematic transformation that did the species a disservice. Mowat was a novelist, guided by sentiment and anthropocentrism more than rational objectivity, they argued. The natural resource community balked at letters of complaint that described 'married' wolves, 'old maids' and 'bachelors' under threat, seeing little of merit in creating an anthropomorphic world of persecuted personalities in wolf clothing. More critically, in his dia- tribe against the Wildlife Service, Mowat questioned the hallowed role of the scientist as ultimate authority on animal behaviour. Put simply, the controversy over Never Cry Wolf highlighted a contest for authenticity in wildlife matters between the scientist and the storyteller: who did speak for the wolf?29 Roger Caras published The Custer Wolf three years after Mowat's ecological expose. Subtitled Biography of an American Renegade , the book told the life story of a historic lupine outlaw renowned for preying on stock in South Dakota during the 1910s. In common with Buck, White Fang and Lobo, the Custer Wolf represented a charismatic trickster with a penchant for extraordinary behaviour. Caras aggrandised the eponymous lupine as a four-legged western hero. As a pup, the Custer Wolf appeared 'somewhat different' from his siblings, reflect- ing his reputation later in life as an American renegade. Caras revelled in the myth surrounding the white wolf, exclaiming: 'Before his story reached its end his name was known to people on the shores of both oceans and on the floor of Congress ... So well known did he become, in fact, that his footprint was 28. 'Filming "Never Cry Wolf", 16 Oct. 1983, New York Times Magazine ; Variety, 1 Sept. 1983. 29. A. W.

With its leading character mythologised as a wily bandit, a lone, mysterious figure roaming the prairie, The Custer Wolf drew on classic frontier iconography, trading in images of the troubled, rugged individualist usually reserved for two-legged western heroes.30 In writing a biography of the Custer Wolf, Caras endeavoured to capture the spirit of the animal. The book commenced with a genealogy, recalling the meet- ing of the Custer Wolf's parents, their courtship, pairing and raising of young. Passages relating the pup's early sensations, the 'joy of movement', the aching desire for food and the 'hot light' at the den entrance, recalled London's attempts at empathy half a century earlier. The world operated according to simple laws of survival, with its characters plagued by neither emotional nor psychological dilemmas. As Caras asseverated, 'Wolves are not human beings who must run around reassuring each other, thumping each other on the back; these great wild predators do exactly what they have to do, or they die' .31 While Caras exalted the Custer Wolf as a traditional western hero, his nar- rative offered a critique of westward expansionism. The author lamented the eradication of resident carnivores and situated the range economy as a landscape not of progress but of loss. Like Never Cry Wolf , The Custer Wolf subscribed to an environmental mythology that idealised Canis lupus as a symbol of pristine, ecologically vibrant North America and deplored modern society for its arrogant, rapacious attitude towards nature: in this respect his narrative was very much a product of the 1960s and its questioning of the values of the modern industrial state. Whereas cattle were described as 'huge, dumb beasts . . . their brains bred out of them to make room for filets and ground round' , Caras crafted wolves as vital, quick-witted creatures, intricately connected to the landscape and psycho- spiritually alive. The delicate senses of the Custer Wolf even allowed him to feel the night. Farley Mowat based his environmental treatise on biological observa- tions. Roger Caras' cult of the wild instead relied on a mystical appreciation of the primordial wolf and the 'genius of nature's secret knowledge'. Imparting a literary romanticism reminiscent of nineteenth-century naturalist John Muir, Caras framed nature as a harmonious place where 'nothing cruel, nothing sav- age, harmful or tragic' occurred.32 Homo sapiens represented the villain of The Custer Wolf just as in Never Cry Wolf Whereas Mowat drew on personal experience to narrate his critique of modern technocratic society, Caras looked to historical precedent and the vitriolic war waged on wolves by Euro- American pioneers. Adopting a mis- anthropic tone, Caras evaluated the human race as 'eternally guilty of crimes beyond counting - man the killer, the slayer, the luster-for-blood has always sought to expurgate himself of his sin and guilt by condemning the predatory 30.

In the writer's vernacular, humans were to blame for creating the aberrant behaviour of the Custer Wolf, instilling in the animal a burning desire to 'even a very lopsided score with the men and cattle who had taken over his range and declared him an outlaw in his own ancestral hunting grounds'. Ap- prehending the Custer Wolf from a sympathetic, eco-centric perspective, Roger Caras performed an important task of historical, environmental, and literary revisionism.33 Caras, like Mowat, won the admiration of his audience via a fecund blend of science , history and sentiment . Foremost in the mix was the role of the storyteller, the environmental advocate, stoking empathy and fury among his readers for the fate of the wolf. As Caras noted in the epilogue, this work was a 'fiction- alised biography, a fact that is acknowledged without apology'. On the charge of sentimentality, he appeared candid, viewing a connection with the animal as an essential part of 'knowing': 'Somehow, across the years since the blood dried and the hurt ceased to matter, I feel as if I have some slight understand- ing of this strange, tormented animal. One has to be sentimental about a thing like that.' That said, Caras' tale also gained converts courtesy of its historical and scientific credentials. The Custer wolf did exist, lending authenticity to the account. Moreover, as the book asserted, Caras based his depictions on close readings of works by wildlife biologists including Adolph Murie and Douglas Pimlott. The storyteller segued into pseudo-scientist on the jacket cover for all readers to apprehend: 'From close observation of a pack of full-blooded timber wolves and films of the birth and rearing of a litter of cubs, and after years of travel and study, the author has been able to knowledgably and compassionately reconstruct the idealized life of the Custer wolf' . This blend of empiricism and literary panache won plaudits, not least from the Times Literary Supplement , which deemed The Custer Wolf a. 'powerful, moving and beautifully written tale, fit to stand comparison with White Fang or even Tarka, to the factual historical report. The telling is utterly devoid of sentimentality, forthright yet never crude, and the feelings and instincts of the animals are explicit in their actions.' Once more, the storyteller served as critical intermediary between the worlds of sci- ence and popular culture, translating the mediums of ecology and history into a narrative framework with considerable popular impact.34 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE: TALES OF WOLF RECOVERY AND RESTOR(Y)ATION In the preface to his 1993 book, Out Among the Wolves , naturalist John Mur- ray noted his 'good fortune to have lived in what posterity may well call "The Decade of the Wolf".

Canis lupus gained cachet as a victim of frontier progress and a hallowed icon of the North American wild. Lupine images adorned T-shirts and mugs, compact discs offered haunting vocalisations of wild canines as wilder- ness symphony. The saliency of conservation issues resulted in an extraordinary proliferation of wolf literature. Even EarthFirst!-er Dave Foreman got in on the action by writing a wolf novel, The Lobo Outback Funeral Home (2000), an ir- reverent eco-thriller/romance about an ex-Sierra clubber and a wildlife biologist in the South-west who teamed up to protect wild lands from corporate industri- alism and protect the itinerant Mexican wolves who had stolen into the area to reclaim ancestral territory. The story of how wolves lost, and regained, parts of the United States offered a powerful narrative of tragedy and rebirth and provided an ideal forum for authors to craft environmentalist narratives preaching human responsibilities towards nature. And yet, in common with prior years, the wolf also emerged as a carrier to discuss sociological issues pertaining to the human zoo. In the late nineteenth century, it was natural selection and the survival of the fittest; in the 1960s, popular readings of ecology, community organisation and family dynamics; and, in the 1980s and 1990s, holocaust (both human and animal), multiculturalism, immigration and the border.35 Set in a post-apocalyptic United States ravaged by nuclear war, Whitley Strieber's novel Wolf of Shadows (1985) related the trials of a human survivor and her daughter as they sought to escape the atomic holocaust. Central in the story stood the eponymous 'Wolf of Shadows', who leads his pack, as well as the bedraggled humans, from their homes in contaminated Minnesota to seek safe stomping grounds in the South . In talking about her work , Strieber described the responsibility of the storyteller as that of public consciousness raiser, in this case using the written word as a tool of environmental advocacy in order to generate interest in 'the plight of helpless life which, after the terrible war, also includes humanity'. No longer a symbol of a remnant western frontier or an idyllic, pristine North, Canis lupus now served as a totemic functionary, highlighting the deadly chasm separating modern industrial society from nature. The contemporary context of the second Cold War and the potential for global ecocide courtesy of multiple nuclear explosions , radiation poisoning and nuclear winter set the frame for the narrative, again forwarding the character of wolf as a rhetorical device for communicating social, environmental and political issues. In Strieber's tale, atomic Armageddon levelled the gap between wolves and humans as fellow travellers facing extinction and, in somewhat macabre tone, illuminated a pressing need to re-connect with other species. As the author pointed out, 'the bond that develops between the wolves and humans beings in 35. John Murray (ed.)

From the start, Strieber centred attention on wolves and their world, making a conscious effort to present the story from a lupine vantage in a process of imaginative shape-shifting in keeping with the broader environmental-literary tradition. We witness humanity as the 'other ' ,two-leggeds carrying 'death-sticks' , inhabiting 'dens' and visiting places that 'blazed with light and stank of burned meat, and men went into them' . Wolf of Shadows appeared bemused by human footwear, puzzling over how 'paws ... understand the ground if they couldn't touch it'. Lupine society, in contrast, apprehended the world directly and glee- fully, glorying in the rush of the hunt, the taste of blood and the comfort of the pack. Theirs was a storied landscape defined by finely tuned cognition: 'Wolves bear as remembered smells the history of the lives, the kills, the hot summer nights, the odour of their winter coats, the drowsy, exciting mustiness of sex.' 37 As 'seen' from the perspective of the wolf, the A-bomb appeared alien, hostile and malevolent, a perturbing intrusion into the realms of nature. The real-politik deception of nuclear deterrence and ' winnable war' was exposed by the earth knowledge of the wolf: 'His sensitive footpads knew the language of the ground, and it was beginning to speak in an unaccustomed way'. Accord- ingly, when Wolf of Shadows experienced the sounds, sights and vibrations of nuclear war, his hackles were raised and he began to whine. Like a surrogate miner's canary, Canis lupus howled out to humanity at its destructive course.38 Seized by an abiding need to rescue his brethren from the impending nuclear threat, Wolf of Shadows mobilised the pack for the exodus south (a process which involved usurping the dominant alpha male in a show of canine strength reminiscent of the antics of Buck). Moving through the forest, Wolf of Shadows also encountered the humans with whom he travelled for the rest of the novel. The human mother who was 'regurgitated' from the 'bird-thing' that crashed in the lake turned out to be an animal biologist who had spent the prior summer observing the pack. She had already 'shared his gaze'. The choice of female lead reflected an authorial desire for authenticity: this human had to have a 'past' with the wolves that marked her out as one of the good 'two-leggeds' as well as arming her with sufficient knowledge to navigate the contours of pack society. Tellingly, Strieber cast a wildlife biologist as the most suitable ambassador for inter-species communication, an expert witness and paragon of understanding.39 Significantly, the remainder of the novel construed the engagement between the bedraggled human and canine survivors in emotive, intuitive terms.

The humans steered clear of their kin and felt 'safer with wolves' - a judgement not only on humanity's post-apocalyptic regression to mob rule but also a misanthropic nod to the environmental crimes of Homo sapiens. Wolf of Shadows tendered a powerful environmental fable of reckoning and redemption, conjoining the kin- ship narratives common to Seton and London's work with Mowat's eco-parable approach to create a sense of humans and wolves as co-dependents in a world facing biotic breakdown. The rag-tag band of survivors stumbled through a broken, silent and decayed landscape that harked back to the opening chapter of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring : The land, though, was quiet. Where beaver had once cut the underbrush there were no living things . . . South of the great ruin some birds still lived. In all their many languages: only two things were being spoken: "We are cold; we are lost.'"40 The Crossing ( 1 994) by Cormac McCarthy typified wolf literature in the 1 990s in dealing with themes of dispossession, stewardship and species restoration. In this manner it combined debates about animal recovery and belonging with pertinent social issues surrounding immigration, mobility and the US-Mexican border. The second book in a South-western trilogy, The Crossing considered three journeys undertaken by sixteen-year-old Billy Parham from his home in Hidalgo County, New Mexico across the international boundary in the 1930s. During the first of his 'crossings' , Billy facilitated the repatriation of a she-wolf to her homeland in the Mexican mountains. In attempting the arduous journey of relocation, Billy demonstrated a keen environmental consciousness, choos- ing not to vanquish the she-wolf (and obey the instructions of his father) but to restore her to ancestral terrain. In narrating Billy's trails across the sagebrush, McCarthy subscribed to a New Western paradigm, applying tropes of wilderness lost, multicultural identity and complex characterisation to his desert setting. In McCarthy's revisionist narrative, Canis lupus signified an animal with a past rather than a primordial, abstracted creation. The she- wolf was a gaunt, harried nomad who had wandered from the Sonoran Mountains in search of companion- ship following the capture of her mate. Ostracised from her own domain, 'She would not return to a kill. She would not cross a road or a rail line in daylight. She would not cross under a wire fence twice in the same place.' In the law of the range, the native had become alien. The wolf was a pariah, a marginalised creation that spoke of mythologies, contested boundaries, competing regional identities and the clashes between past and present in the American South-west. Meanwhile, for Billy Parham, an outsider in ranch society, the wolf represented an evocative symbol of freedom, and vibrancy. Secretly watching wolves hunt- ing on the plains, the young cowboy iconised Canis lupus as both an ecological 40. Strieber, Wolf of Shadows, p. 84.

From his cultural perspective , wolves possessed an appealing otherworldliness, their energy sourced directly from the wild. Billy appeared mesmerised by the graceful animals that 'twisted and turned and leapt in a silence such that they seemed of another world entire'.41 Unlike Wild Animals I Have Known , The Call of the Wild or The Custer Wolf , The Crossing dealt with the motivations and destiny of a human protagonist, Billy Parham. However, McCarthy devoted copious attention to creating the she- wolf as a powerful literary character, a non-human protagonist with voice . In writing the wolf, McCarthy, in common with his peers, focused on the specifics of animal thoughts and actions. The she- wolf displayed typical canine acumen and resilience. McCarthy also strove to impart a four-legged perspective, to imagine how visions of two-legged invaders might plague slumbering lupines, conjuring 'dreams of that malignant lesser god come pale and naked and alien to slaughter all his clan and kin and rout them from their house'. From a ca- nine vantage, McCarthy identified human society as a malevolent and barbaric 'other', injecting a sense of misanthropy into the work that typified revisionist commentaries on wolf eradication. The wolf had been hunted out, game slaugh- tered and forests cut to be replaced by an anodyne landscape populated with 'awkward cattle whose stupidity and blind confusion is an affront to the wolves' . This narrative framework situated The Crossing as a representative text of late twentieth-century environmental advocacy, the wolf sanctified as a fairytale creature, maligned, numinous and misunderstood, the world it once inhabited somehow corroded and tamed in its absence. As Robert Rebein extrapolated, 'few people would call Cormac McCarthy an activist for the environment, but with the first section of The Crossing , McCarthy has written a fictional account of what many environmentalists believe about wolves - that they are mystical, that they are necessary, that they should be reintroduced in their native ranges' . 42 According to the New York Times , the strength of McCarthy's work lay in its 'miracle in prose' and its mesmerising encounters between the young travel- lers and a procession of elder sages. The Crossing also reflected on interactions between the human and the non-human on the dusty trails of the American South- west. In attempting to trap, and later understand, the female wolf, McCarthy's sapient protagonists wrestled with philosophical questions over the possibility of knowing other species. Via an opulent collection of folk renditions, a stock of western characters - trappers, drifters, gypsies and ranchers - the book of- fered esoteric, postmodernist, discourse on the essence of canine character. One ailing trapper analogised Canis lupus with 'the copo de nieve ... Snowflake. You catch the snowflake but when you look in your hand you don't have it no more ... If you want to see it you have to see it on its own ground.' Lying in bed at the ranch house, Billy 'tried to see the world the wolf saw. He tried to 41 .

Environment and History 17.2</page><page sequence="25">225 WRITING THE WOLF think about running in the mountains at night. He wondered if the wolf were so unknowable as the old man said.' In The Crossing , various people strove to comprehend the enigma of the wolf, yet all recognised the animal as her own creation, an independent spirit, unclassifiable. In this context, the 'crossing' of the title involved a pertinent exploration of the margins of the human-animal relationship. In this reading, the 'border' spoke of the separation between the human and the non-human. The wolf, in McCarthy's story, possessed its own agency, roamed its own world, and could not be essentialised. Repeatedly asked if he would sell the captured wolf, Billy explained that the animal was not his, merely entrusted into his care. The Crossing thereby offered a captivat- ing narrative on (the limits to) knowing and saving other species. It also spoke of transgression. After burying the dead she- wolf in the Sonoran Mountains, Billy assumed a feral demeanour, becoming, like his canine charge, an outlaw in ancestral territory. Roaming across the borderlands, seeking stolen horses and his brother Luke, the cowboy became the renegade, hungry, and hunted. When Billy revisited civilisation, 'people passing in the street turned to look at him. Something in off the wild mesas, something out of the past. Ragged, dirty, hungry in eye and belly. Totally unspoken for.' Offering pertinent commentary on the perverse response of the human psyche towards denizens of the wild, McCarthy added, 'In that outlandish figure they beheld what they envied most and what they most reviled. If their hearts went out to him it was yet true that for very small cause they might have killed him.'43 While The Crossing narrated Billy Parham's attempt to return a persecuted wolf to her native Mexico, Asta Bowen's 1997 novel Hungry for Home related a lupine search for security and prosperity on the US-Canadian border. Where McCarthy situated his fictional tale in a 1930s amalgam of the old and the modern West, Bowen based her lupine odyssey on the real-world story of wolf recolonisation in the Northern Rockies during the 1980s and 1990s. As agents of their own recovery, the wolves in Bowen's tale displayed customary lupine zeal and resilience. The dominant wolf, Marta, was portrayed as an eco-feminist icon, a strong female character akin to the she- wolf in The Crossing. Marta exhibited nurturing instincts, hunting prowess, pack loyalty, individualism and, above all, stamina. Here the wolf served as totem for positive gender identity - yet remained confined by biological convention casting the female as maternal figure. Other wolves displayed similarly humanistic traits, rather like Mowat's wolf family. The embattled, aged wolf Oldtooth displayed patience and devotion while Greatfoot possessed the vigour and assured gait demanded of an alpha male. In common with the other authors in this study, Bowen's wolf society appeared an earthy, otherworldly realm, a lupo-topia where individual animals possessed distinctive personality traits and humanity existed as an eternal enemy. Characterising the story of wolf recovery in the Rockies as a 'trail of tears' - itself a poignant reference to the plight of the Cherokee Nation in the 1830s 43. McCarthy, Crossing , pp. 45, 51 , 170; New York Times , 12 June 1994. Environment and History 17.2</page><page sequence="26">226 KAREN JONES - Bowen's fictionalised rendition of lupine restoration involved copious quan- tities of pain, struggle, and death. This was a damming verdict on Turnerian triumphalism. Here the wolf story showed a West not won but lost. In Bowen's work, the wolf emerged as a potent signifier of frontier guilt, an expression that also proved common in commentary on the wolf reintroduction programme in Yellowstone in the mid-1990s. Despite the hardships endured by Marta and her pack, Hungry for Home nonetheless imparted a celebratory narrative that con- sciously reflected the successful return of wolves to the West in the latter years of the twentieth century. Individual animals certainly suffered adversity. Yet, the restoration of the species to old haunts constituted an act of environmental magnitude and attested to human magnanimity. As the 'Return of the Wolf' pamphlet issued by the US National Park Service intimated, 'wolf restoration shows that we respect the existence of other life forms, even when that may not be easy' . Species restoration signalled a renewed faith in human progress, writ in terms of ecological sustainability, wildland preservation and buoyant Sierra Club membership. In a brief epilogue that served as an exact foil to Mowat's shocking endnote, Bowen exclaimed: 'Though the deaths of so many wolves make this story tragic, for the species it ends with hope'.44 FROM SAVING TO KNOWING? The alluring canine protagonists of Wild Animals I Have Known , White Fang , The Call of the Wild , Never Cry Wolf ' The Custer Wolf Wolf of Shadows , The Crossing , and Hungry For Home identify the wolf as a enduring character in North American literature and environmental history. In their canine expositions, Seton, London, Mowat, Caras, Strieber, McCarthy and Bowen employed Canis lupus as a signifier for wilderness. With the wolf enshrined as a totemic intermediary allowing readers to interact with wild landscapes, authors explored themes of nature versus civilisation, frontier guilt and ethical obligations. Changing ideas about nature and ecology, as well as sociological precepts, determined the shape of wolf tales. In the first wave, the likes of Seton and London cast the wolf as a Darwinian and Turnerian super-canine, all red in tooth and claw. For the writers of the 1960s, Canis lupus was draped in revisionist guilt at the 'winning' of the West and adorned with commentary on ecological science and family social dynamics. Issues of ecocide, species eradication and recovery, the border and ethnic identity framed wolf tales at the close of the twentieth century. Seen in this context, the wolf emerged as a powerful rhetorical device for chewing over human political, social and environmental preoccupations. 44.

Environment and History 17.2</page><page sequence="27">227 WRITING THE WOLF As this article has demonstrated, the storyteller emerged as a valid and ef- fective architect of environmental advocacy, a shaper of opinion as well as a reflector of social mores. Just as Aesop crafted his animal characters to serve as four-legged instructors for human society, narrators on the lupine experience in North America configured their faunal speakers to impart sturdy environ- mentalist messages. Wolf tales adeptly broadcast moral judgments as to human responsibilities towards the rest of the natural world, offering the storyteller as environmental advocate, instructor and consciousness-raiser. From the late nineteenth century onwards, stories heralding the wolf as a four-legged hero redefined popular attitudes towards wildlife. Even pre-environmentalist works by Seton and London offered positive depictions of wolves that fostered the eventual rehabilitation of the species. Mowat and Caras participated in a social awakening to global environmental crisis and highlighted the losers in the story of America's relentless dash to supremacy. Wolf writers of the late twentieth century traded in an imaginative geography that extrapolated the trails of wolf recovery and the fictions and fixtures of the border. Throughout, these storytell- ers effectively used canine tales to question accustomed species hierarchies, lambast paths of progress via environmental destruction and, occasionally, to trade in misanthropy. The tales they told about wolves allowed readers to connect with the animal, in the process forging a positive wolf fairytale based around strong individual personalities and the culture of the pack. Collectively, they established a new environmental-literary paradigm that shaped popular attitudes as much as the emerging precepts of ecological science. As sociolo- gist Ulrich Beck reminds us, 'only if nature is brought into people's everyday images, into the stories they tell, can its beauty and its suffering be seen and focused on'. The significance of literature in facilitating wolf preservation thereby situates environmental education as the vocation of the storyteller as well as the scientist. By stoking an emotional engagement between reader and wolf, fiction proved to be a powerful force in promoting inter-species empathy and ecological consciousness.45 Foremost wolf biologist L. David Mech freely admitted that Never Cry Wolf ' served to stir the public from its apathy regarding the plight of the wolf'. However, in the wider scientific community, reactions to pro-wolf stories were muted at best and often critical. Seton and London earned the slur 'nature fakers' while Mowat won a tirade of abuse from the North American wildlife community. The storyteller cut a radical presence in offering a controversial narrative that challenged prevalent societal judgements about animals and com- peted with the professional wildlife community for authority over the public imagination . B iological organisations keen to assert their own power as speakers on wildlife matters utilised the polarities of expert/amateur and scientist/ story - teller to effectively discredit those who clothed their wolves in literary guise. A 45. Ulrick Beck, 'Politics in Risk Society', in Ecological Enlightenment (New Jersey, 1995), p. 14. Environment and History 17.2</page><page sequence="28">228 KAREN JONES testament to the identification of science with credible expertise, many of the authors under review here felt the need to invoke a 'biological' voice in order to gain the attention and trust of the reading public. Writing in 2006, Barbara Nelson called for 'good' scientists to police the realms of wolf writing in order to ensure 'representative accuracy of the natural world'. Nelson's comment spoke of a long-standing tendency within the wildlife community to write off literature as falsehood and elevate science as above criticism or bias. I favour a different conclusion, one founded on the principle that all wolf tales reflect the trappings of contemporary society. As such, the focus of existing scholarship on the diametric oppositions of 'science' and 'sentiment' overlooks a vital point. While the charge to assimilate 'the animal's perspective' denoted an oft-touted maxim, providing a convincing rendition of lupine exigencies challenged the skills of North American novelists and wildlife managers alike. Both allowed a peek into canine ways, but necessarily from a two-legged vantage. As Barry Lopez remarked in his classic text Of Wolves and Men: 'in the wolf we have not so much an animal we have always known as one we have consistently imagined'. In fact, by admitting the limits to 'knowing the animal', we allow for the existence of agency in the non-human world and open up the possibility of a fuller and more provocative deconstruction of wolf tales. Such a project demands acceptance, from both storyteller and scientist, that while we might aspire to 'know' the wolf, we can never crawl beneath its skin.46 46.
