<plain_text><page sequence="1">Primal Revenge and Other Anthropomorphic Projections for Literary History Karyn Ball Whether what survives is the human or the inhuman, the animal or the organic, it seems that life bears within itself the dream?or the nightmare?of survival. ?Giorgio Agamben1 I. From the Museum of Dead Animals (Peter Friedl at Documenta 12) During the rain-drenched summer of 2007, I encountered a giraffe outside a zoo in Germany. You might be surprised unless I admit that I discovered this giraffe in Kassel at Documenta 12, curated by Roger M. Buergel and Ruth Noack and organized around the motifs of "bare life" and the "migration of form." This "migrant" giraffe did not live, though I would not label it a simulacrum. The creature in question is the exclusive material of Peter Friedl's installation entitled "The Zoo Story." Cocurator Buergel's catalog introduces Friedl's giraffe as "a fatality of armed conflict." The animal died on August 19, 2002, in Qalquiliyah Zoo, "the only zoo in the West Bank." "When the Israeli forces moved into this city of 45,000 inhabitants in the wake of the second Intifada," Buergel explains, "outbreaks of shooting ensued." The nine-year-old gi raffe named "Brownie" probably panicked, "ran into an iron bar, bumped his head and collapsed to the ground. This spells death for giraffes," as Buergel informs us, because "their strong hearts are designed to pump blood upwards."2 This poetic hint of divine or Lamarckian teleology lodged in the giraffe's heart quickly veers into a global genealogy. Before Brownie was bestowed with a cutely generic name and the mortal destiny that attended it, he lived in South Africa with his mate who remains name less here. Buergel narrates: "[Brownie] arrived in Qalquiliyah via Israel in 1997?in the days when this Palestinian town was the agricultural centre of the West Bank and not yet cut off from the outside world by New Literary History, 2008, 39: 533-563</page><page sequence="2">534 NEW LITERARY HISTORY an eight to ten-metre-high cement wall."3 The irony of this situation is self-evidently tragic: Buergel, speaking on Friedl's behalf, attests to Is rael's self-contradictory role in serving as a conduit for most economic activity in this region at the same time that it not only restricts, but also destroys the fruits of such activity among the Palestinians who depend on the state's good will (or sense of security). Less self-evident is how to comprehend without dissembling this giraffe's ghastly afterlife. Friedl discovered him in a museum adjacent to the Qalquiliyah Zoo, which also houses a lion, a zebra, and a baboon. Like Brownie, these animals were stuffed following their deaths in the same zoo by the local veterinarian, Sami Khader, who "is not a professional taxidermist."4 It used to be the case that any endeavor to specify the object of liter ary history grappled with the tension between distinctive and generic aspects of its form. Yet in the era of the "antidisciplinary" text conceived as a cultural artifact, the questions I might pose to the Austrian artist, Friedl, are not directly oriented by the conventions that determine liter ary genres. It would be disingenuous to ask whether Khader's amateur taxidermy assumes the status of "art" rather than "craft" once it appears in an exhibit or whether an object of this kind is more "document" than "art." Binaries of this ilk occult the sociohistorical conditions that make it not merely feasible but also desirable to present an animal carcass as a politicized aesthetic concept. To shift the horizon of this occultation, one might ask how Friedl phrased his request for the loan of the giraffe from the operators of the museum of dead animals. Did he say, "Can I borrow your stuffed giraffe for an internationally renowned art exhibit that takes place on a spectacular scale every five years in Kassel, Germany?" One assumes that translators and lawyers were employed to negotiate the contract(s) drawn up among the respective parties in German, Arabic, and English. How did they calculate the compensation for this singu lar exchange and for the labor involved in crating and transporting a stuffed giraffe from the West Bank to the Federal Republic? What were the nationalities of the corporations that supplied the materials for the crate, designed or built the planes that stuffed Brownie journeyed on? Shipping a giraffe from one continent to another is a delicate operation, no doubt, for dead as well as living cargo. It strikes me as extraordinary that a zoo could function symbolically in the Palestinian territories when the direst zones created by the conflict scarcely differ from cages for humans, where access to water and a func tional infrastructure depends on the interests of neighboring "zookeep ers" in Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria, or more distant investors in the United States and Europe. The death of an exotic animal in a zoo enunciates the futility of maintaining such a structure in such a context. How could one of the saddest places on earth be perceived as a locus</page><page sequence="3">PRIMAL REVENGE 535 Photo by author. of hope??because the situation that prompts this perception is more hopeless than a zoo, of course.' Buergel's debriefing of Friedl's intentions does not alleviate my first world guilt about contemplating a dead giraffe at the Documenta. "The essential aspect for Peter Friedl," according to Buergel, "lies in the no tion that while Brownie certainly does make a good picture, this image might, one would hope, trigger a narrative distinct from the stereotypi cal impotent media images of the conflict and occupation zone, which bloodily offend any political rationality." Brownie is "simultaneously the condensate and the possible seed crystal for a historico-political epic" that "begins with the miraculous metamorphosis of the dead giraffe into an idea."6 Can this possibility be couched in unconditional terms? A rhetorical question, perhaps. The aim of wresting hope from art is already fraught with a "document of barbarism" disavowal, an all-too-human self-forget ting. Buergel implies that the metamorphosis from "dead giraffe into an idea" is a single event that commences with Friedl's installation, yet</page><page sequence="4">536 NEW LITERARY HISTORY obviously this alteration already "began" on a historical level before Lin naeus founded modern scientific taxonomy, before Darwin's theories of speciation, or the development of zoos, which authorized traffickers to kidnap Brownie-to-be in South Africa. The giraffe became a different "idea" once caged and later mourned as "Brownie" and then again when his corpse was stuffed by a Palestinian veterinarian, mounted in the Qalquiliyah museum and, subsequently, in the Documenta-Halle. Still another transformation took place when a bourgeois spectator viewed this objet d'art in rainy Kassel or when "I" decided to write about it in North American English "now" as snow falls silently, inexorably, outside. A succession of metamorphoses cannot be fixed to a particular moment, and they are hardly "miraculous." This word belies the crass conditions that institutionalize any prospect of "epic" renarration. Brownie's sacrifice to art services a luxuriously melancholic captivation with the impassive animal caught in the skirmishes of human folly (? la the sainted donkey of Robert Bresson's Au hazard, Balthazar of 1966). Thus, my despair about the Middle East fastens on the fabulation that Brownie apolitically committed suicide: his terrified run, concussive bump, and heartbroken collapse instinctually register the bleakness of the dream for peaceful stability that he might have fleshed out had he lived longer. My choice of the word suicide should be annoying. It poeticizes a flimsy political consciousness and invites indulgent personifications on Brownie's behalf because his presumed voicelessness begs so poignantly for any revolutionary or mournful projection. It is precisely this kind of projection that reveals the "global animal" as the chiaroscuro surface of human hope and fear: it brims with harbingers of present and future perils, warnings that might be heeded on time if only one could penetrate the still eyes of this anthropomorphic mirror. My sentimental response to Brownie's silent suffering and hapless death projects a human trait, a pathos-saturated evacuation of agency, onto a nonhuman being. The affectivity of anthropomorphosis merits a theo rization, a task suited for a literary history that traces the development of modes of figuration. The value of this theorization lies in its power to shed light on how the postulate of a speechless shame-free subsistence, and "the animal" as such, is inordinately compelled to speak on behalf of self-perpetuated threats to our own futurity: to image, store, but then disguise our apprehensions before we have a chance to run the most obvious danger off at the pasture. Projections of animal "innocence" in life and death permit me to take pleasurably moral solace in a melan choly that should have already shrilled into a howl of mourning. This mood seals my devilish pact with the agencies and forces that imprison, vivisect, mass slaughter, and, following official approval by the Food and Drug Administration, will sell the progeny of cloned prize livestock</page><page sequence="5">PRIMAL REVENGE 537 in grocery stores.7 The stakes of melancholic anthropomorphosis are planetary and thus "global" when it adumbrates a sense of shared doom, coddles "imperialist nostalgia" for a state of nature,8 and arouses a dream of imminent revenge by our current victims that will bring about this reversion. The ensuing projections reverberate with my anticipation of this revenge as a belated recording of the impact of a terrified giraffe running into the bars of his cage. II. One-Way Mirror As he so clearly intended it, the force of Friedl's "Zoo Story" stems from Brownie's form as a global animal: his worldly travels at various stages of life and death bear witness to the asymmetrically permeable borders he traversed?more easily, to be sure, than many of his hu man counterparts.9 Nonetheless, this musealization of Brownie's mute testimony aestheticizes its own politics: it offers up a dead animal as a sacrament to the Palestinians' precarious situation while spectralizing a borderless extinction of species across the globe, an irreversible destruction already in the gears. The zoo I visit in Frankfurt or San Diego to spend time with animals is, as Akira Mizuta Lippit observes, "a monument to their disappearance."10 Friedl's stuffed giraffe is, thus, the harbinger of a future in which the "specimens" we once preserved on our zoo-arks (and not just rare ones) will go the way of gaslight. We sentence ourselves to encounter their remains in natural museums. The global pulse of this essay was taken from recent newspapers that have, with increasing regularity, attested to a steady buildup of imminent extinctions. Two reports that appeared in the fall of 2007 were particu larly alarming. In October, the United Nations Environment Program reported that, "[c]limate change, the rate of extinction of species, and the challenge of feeding a growing population are putting humanity at risk." Among the persistent problems the report mentions are a "rapid rise of 'dead zones,' where marine life no longer can be supported be cause pollutants like runoff fertilizers deplete oxygen." The executive director of the Environment Program warned against "a global collapse of all species being fished by 2050, if fishing around the world contin ued at its current pace." "The human population is living far beyond its means," James Kanter writes, "and inflicting damage to the environment that could pass points of no return."11 Following their November meet ing in Valencia, a UN panel of scientists predicted significant risks "if governments fail to respond" to the mounting impact of climate change: "melting ice sheets that could lead to a rapid rise in sea levels and the extinction of large numbers of species brought about by even moderate amounts of warming, on the order of 1 to 3 degrees."12</page><page sequence="6">538 NEW7 LITERARY HISTORY The bristling unease that prompts newspapers to report lately on the links between global warming and the demise of salmon and polar bears,13 to name just two prominent examples, also nurtures the growth of a "crisis discipline" such as conservation biology.14 Yet a disinclination to contemplate the affective dimensions of ecological damage marks even the most incisive political-economic descriptions of globalization. Six years ago, Revathi Krishnaswamy observed that the burgeoning field of critical globalization studies remains partially captive to the strains of "comparative economism" it inherits from a "postcolonial thought operating under the constraints of Marxism."15 Iain A. Boal recently reminded us that, in the early 1990s, globalization was "the buzzword on the lips of graduating MBAs, think-tank pundits, and financial journal ists everywhere."16 Critical descriptions of globalization have, for these reasons, often countered neoliberal celebrations of broader access to cheap labor and resource markets by recuperating the "uneven develop ment" concept for a post-Eastern Block geopolitics bisected now into a neoimperialist "North" and an exploited "South." In his seminal 1993 outline for an emerging globalization framework, Masao Miyoshi proclaims "that while oppression and suffering continue unabated, the administrative and occupational mode of colonialism is irreversibly being replaced by an economic version?especially after the end of the cold war. " Alongside the conclusion of the cold war, he identifies the interrelated developments of decolonization, transnational corporatism, high-tech revolution, feminism, and environmental crisis with the "actuality" of global politics that the preoccupation with the "metropolitan-colonial paradigm" conceals. He also lists "postmodern ism, popularization of culture, cultural studies, de-disciplinarization, ethnicism, economic regionalisms (tripolarism), and so on" as "adjacent cultural coordinates" that are neither homologically nor causally related to the first order of developments.17 Miyoshi's "borderless world" backlights his 2001 "turn to the planet" where he would recuperate the critical value of "totality" for literary history in a post-Marxist milieu that taboos this concept along with "universality" as humanist tools of repression and exclusion.18 Divest ing these concepts, he argues, defuses the power of critique to thwart a now unchallenged neoliberal paradigm that emerged after the cold war.19 This paradigm legitimates "private profit over and above public good" and naturalizes an "asocial individualist" belief in "competition as the fundamental human condition, and triumph as the ultimate goal of life."20 To counteract this ruthless paradigm, he urges literary scholars to move beyond a multiculturalist predilection for "casting every ethnic or gender minority" in the light of comparative "victimology" and to see particularities, instead, as the dialectical loci of a "totality": "Literary</page><page sequence="7">PRIMAL REVENGE 539 and cultural critics must look out at the world and interconnect all the workings of political economy and artistic and cultural productions. We must keep reminding ourselves that the 'global' economy is not global at all, but an exclusionist economy. We must discover the sense of true totality that includes everyone in the world."21 Given such an intrepid articulation of our task and its variations over the last fifteen years, it might go without saying that the goal of literary history in the era of its self-conscious globalization is to trace the de velopments Miyoshi identifies and their contingent conjunctures across literatures and through the institutional trajectories of literary criticism over time.22 However, what even the most astute formulations of this agenda tend to bypass, as Arjun Appadurai recognizes, is the affective detritus of the fantasies that suture people to the public narratives that structure their anxiety. In Fear of Small Numbers, Appadurai considers the uncertainty and rage incited by the destabilizing consequences of globalization, moods that feed terrorist networks as well as ethnic conflicts that approach a geno cidal scale. He writes: "We can do our best to see globalization as just a new phase (and face) of capitalism, or imperialism, or neocolonialism, or modernization or developmentalism. And there is some force to this hunt for the analogy that will let us tame the beast of globalization in the prison house (or zoo) of language. But this historicizing move (for all of its technical legitimacy) is doomed to fail precisely in accounting for the part of globalization that is unsettling in its newness." Appadurai speculates that the import of this new part "lurks" in the intuition of "many poor people (and their supporters) that globalization poses new challenges, which cannot be addressed with the comforts of history, even those of the history of bad people and nasty world conquerors."23 I will return to this "lurking" intuition later. For now, I simply want to align my present goals with Appadurai's commitment to exploring the anxiety that foments "predatory narcissisms" among ethnic and sectarian groups who mobilize "an understanding of themselves as threatened majorities" and therefore believe they "require the extinction of another collectivity for their own survival."24 One cannot help noticing, nonetheless, that Appadurai stops short of deriding consumers from industrialized nations as "predatory narcissists," though he employs a "zoo of language" to dehumanize violent groups and globalization as a whole. His references to the "beast of globalization" and "predatory narcissism" reauthorize the humanitarian motives of critical globalization discourse even when savage animal imagery serves as their vehicle. Recent discussions about globalization urgently describe "the way things are" with a blood-limned earnestness that stamps out the pleasures of their own interpretative form. The high-minded sobriety of such discus</page><page sequence="8">540 NEW LITERARY HISTORY sions is well-equipped for reciting macrorefrains about the dissolution of the nation-state whose rise and fall correlates, for Miyoshi among others, with the movements of "Western colonialism from the sixteenth to the midtwentieth centuries";25 the border-blurring effects of (Ameri can) cultural imperialism that interpenetrates the global with the local ("glocalization," indigenization, and vernacularization) ; the "diffusion of sovereignty into international organizations, trade conventions, nongov ernmental organizations (NGOs), and transnational corporations";26 the adaptive practices and audiences constituted by migration and diaspora; the hemispheric domains of a "new imperialism" undergirded, as Boal notes, "by the sciences of surveillance and informatics, and the earth sciences, in particular climatology";27 and the symbiotic collusion be tween the Internet and the acceleration of financial capital that doubly occults industrial labor, while conscripting resources and government policies overseas to projected profits.281 have elsewhere spotlighted the virtuality and global-disciplinary implications of speculative finance and its "poststructuralist" accounting practices. I have also considered the discourse of globalization itself as a venue of bourgeois interpellation.29 In this essay, my more whimsical focus on anthropomorphosis performs an alternative vector for a globally oriented literary history that typically alternates between a polemically configured narration and explanation of information.30 Miyoshi has called on literary critics to tune in to neoliberal narratives that permeate public and private reactions to changing circumstances, including the very scholarship that would formalize and historicize them as poetic forms. One of the challenges for literary historians in a neolib eral era is to become more vigilantly skeptical toward a supraplanetary economism that insinuates itself into any endeavor to paint a more com plex image of the world as a "totality" in Miyoshi's terms while paying lip service to environmental havoc as an "attribute" of globalization.31 To defamiliarize this habit of thinking "globally" while acting anthropo centrically, I will enunciate the ambivalence of anthropomorphosis as a means of figuring a (post)modern "technological mastery over nature" mindset that endangers sustainability.32 In 2002, Jean-Luc Nancy revisited Martin Heidegger's conception of "world-forming" to rekindle the idea of creation ex nihilo after the de cline of a religious faith that might have counteracted the death-driven accumulative logic of globalization.33 Nancy's revision distinguishes be tween the "bad infinity" of a globality where the joyless pursuit of profit "conglomerates" a totality grasped as a whole, and the "good infinity" of a world where "'the production of value' becomes 'the creation of meaning'" (49) as a horizon of community that embraces singularities and possibilities. The term globality translates Nancy's assessment that</page><page sequence="9">PRIMAL REVENGE 541 "[t]he West has come to encompass the world, and in this movement it disappears as what was supposed to orient this world" (34). If, as Heide gger and Nancy contend, metaphysics accomplishes itself in the form of technology, which "must be understood as the planetary domination of the absence of beginning and end, or the withdrawal of any initial or final given," then, he asks, how is it possible to "conceive of this process and thus conceive of history except according to the exhausted themes of progress and/or of decline, of the fortunate and/or fortunate ac cident?" (81). Nancy's query reprises Heidegger's confrontation in his Weltbild lecture, delivered in the inauspicious year of 1938, with the forces of seculariza tion that, in concert with the modern eclipse of nature by technology, darken the hope for salvation.34 It is this twofold eclipse that signals an ongoing reduction of world to world picture. In "The Origin of the Work of Art," world for Heidegger is neither a "countable or uncountable" collection of familiar and unfamiliar things nor an imagined framework "added by our representation to the sum of such given things," but is "the covert throng of a surrounding into which they are all are linked." This interlinkage transcends the realm of our perceptions as "the ever nonobjective to which we are subject as long as the paths of birth and death, blessing and curse keep us transported into Being."35 Such an implicitly ecological conception contrasts with Heidegger's Weltbild to mark the solipsism peculiar to a secular modern subject who closes off an open-ended interpretation of Being and thereby casts a shadow over all that has been exiled outside the frame. Hence the inability to think world beyond world picture stems from the present-future shadow of a no longer sepulchering the not-yet: ecologically shortsighted policies and lifestyles ensure the arrival of that moment when we learn the hard way not to take for granted what we have already irrevocably destroyed. The dark side of Heidegger's conception of Weltbild figures for a foreclosure of the world-forming "incalculability" to which Nancy refers?an enframing that forestalls effective attention to the planetary scope of the hazards and damages that will come to fruition in the time that remains. It is well known that Heidegger falls between the ontic-ontological cracks of his own diagnosis when he hawks his presupposition that animals are beings for whom Being is not an issue. The philosopher of Being oscillates between declaring animals "poor" in world or claiming they lack it altogether, which is why Jacques Derrida would embrace Heidegger's call for the destruction of metaphysics, but amputate his anthropocen tric hand in it.36 Derrida's "The Animal That Therefore I Am (More to Follow)," the first part of a ten-hour address he delivered at a 1997 conference in Cerisy-la-Salle devoted to "L'animal autobiographique," highlights the dire consequences of speciesism. The "number of species</page><page sequence="10">542 NEW LITERARY HISTORY endangered because of man takes one's breath away," Derrida writes, though he cautions that the term genocide should neither be abused nor deflected: "The annihilation of certain species is indeed in process, but it is occurring through the organization and exploitation of an artificial, infernal, virtually interminable survival, in conditions that previous gen erations would have judged monstrous, outside of every supposed norm of a life proper to animals that are thus exterminated by means of their continued existence or even their overpopulation."37 Derrida's acknowledgment of the "annihilation of certain species" and the "infernal" exploitation of animals reinforces the value of Michel Foucault's theses on biopower. As has been often recited of late, mass murder surfaces in The History of Sexuality where Foucault refers to "the naked question of survival." He reflects that if "genocide is indeed the dream of modern powers, this is not because of a recent return of the ancient right to kill; it is because power is situated and exercised at the level of life, the species, the race, and the large-scale phenomena of population."38 If, for Foucault, "modern man is an animal whose politics places his existence as a living being into question,"39 then Lippit is not merely descriptive, but prescient when he names mourning "a crucial feature of modernity."40 Can humans genuinely mourn extinction, or does spe cies solipsism impel us to grieve only for ourselves, as Lippit insists, in the avatar of our lost "animal innocence": an ideation of a self "that had become dehumanized in the very process of humanity's becoming human" (18)? This solipsism inscribes the baneful fate of other species through the devastation of "our" environment; it thereby tells "a story we can never wholly script to a present we have not yet reached" as humans condemn themselves to a Philip K. Dick "electric sheep" universe where live animals are unbearably rare.41 Dick's dystopic Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? prefigures Lippit's critique of post-animal melancholy: "No longer a sign of nature's abun dance," Lippit writes, "animals now inspire a sense of panic for the earth's dwindling resources. Spectral animals recede into the shadows of human consumption and environmental destruction" (1). Yet "[o]nly man dies. The animal perishes," Heidegger alleges. "It has death neither ahead of itself nor behind it."42 As Lippit remarks: "In the world, but unable to risk the venture of its loss, the animal turns its back to the future of the world. Without language, the animal remains in the memories of a merely passed world: undying, undestined, and unmourned" (66) .43 To elucidate this disavowal, Lippit draws on Nicolas Abraham's and Maria Torok's definition of incorporation: "If the animal enters the world, it does so not through representation but through incorporation, not through the dynamic of language but through the economy of cryptic</page><page sequence="11">PRIMAL REVENGE 543 fantasy" (170). Abraham and Torok align incorporation as a mode of "devouring" the object with a "pathological" melancholy. Mourning, in contrast, involves the introjection of loss that sustains a "healthy" separa tion between the bereaved subject and his or her object. While introjec tion "speaks" bereavement through denomination, antimetaphorical incorporation keeps the loss "still," to borrow Derrida's parsing of their difference.44 They write: "Incorporation results from those losses that for some reason cannot be acknowledged as such. In these special cases, the impos sibility of introjection is so profound that even our refusal to mourn is prohibited from being given a language, that we are debarred from providing any indication whatsoever that we are inconsolable. Without the escape-route of somehow conveying our refusal to mourn, we are reduced to a radical denial of the loss, to pretending that we had abso lutely nothing to lose."45 The losses that lead to encryption revolve around love objects that function as ego-ideals, idealized images of a self who satisfies all expec tations; they thereby function to orient and feed the subject's sense of inadequacy before others. It is the wounded or faulty character of the beloved qua ego-ideal that must be protected through encryption, at the expense of the cryptophore's ego, yet there is, significantly, a futural valence to this. Abraham and Torok conclude that, "the primary aim of the fantasy born of incorporation is to repair?in the realm of the imaginary of course?the injury that really occurred and really affected the ideal object." In this respect, the "cryptophoric" fantasy of incorpora tion "reveals a Utopian wish that the memory of the affliction had never existed or, on a deeper level, that the affliction had nothing to inflict."46 For the time being, I will limit myself to the hint that a mute animal already services the analysts' conception of the silent crypt, which is to say, its antimetaphorical form attests to a trapped "animetaphor" gnawing at its own limbs. What their definition of incorporation contributes to a theorization of the current Weltbild is a logic of redoubled negation that permits a melancholic subject to elude the harsh import of his or her own intuition of danger. The event that "never took place" returns as an ecological catastrophe for which I am inconsolable in advance. III. In the Crypt with the Silently-Suffering-and-Dying Animal (Revenge to Follow) But cannot this cat also be, deep within her eyes, my primary mirror? ?Jacques Derrida47</page><page sequence="12">544 NEW LITERARY HISTORY I opened this essay by staging the global as a Weltbild that harnesses the spectral labors of the silently-suffering-and-dying animal to stress human vulnerability while disavowing the crimes of mass slaughter and extinction. Imminent extinctions press us to move beyond the compul sive economics of permeable geopolitical boundaries to consider the planetary stakes of grieving for an unconsciously idealized loss rather than preventing it. Yet if, for Lippit, "the figure of the animal deter mines a radically antithetical counterpoint to human morality, to the edifice of humanism" (73), I wish to avoid indenturing "the animal" to servitude as a posthumanist totem. With an all too cursory appreciative nod at the groundbreaking work of Gilles Deleuze, F?lix Guattari, and Donna Haraway, I weary of gesticulations about the utopie promise of "the animal" depicted as a potentiality that subtends a dualistic ontol ogy. Construed as a "limit case," this trope reasserts the human, despite itself, in relation to the latter's seemingly limitless and thus "inhuman" capacity for destruction, suffering, and bad conscience. I therefore offer these anthropomorphic projections without any hope of wrenching "the animal" from its nonvoluntary martyrdom to the instinctual comfort I draw from its obliging presence, from a bestial language of "mute traces" as Derrida evokes it. In "One-Way Street," Walter Benjamin draws out a "[c]urious paradox." He observes that people have only the narrowest private interest in mind when they act, yet they are at the same time more than ever determined in their behavior by the instincts of the mass. And mass instincts have become confused and estranged from life more than ever. Whereas the obscure impulse of the animal (as innumerable anecdotes relate) detects, as danger approaches, a way of escape that still seems invisible, this society, each of whose members cares only for his own abject well-being, falls victim? with animal insensibility but without the insensate intuition of animals?as a blind mass, to even the most obvious danger, and the diversity of individual goals is immaterial in face of the identity of the determining forces.48 Benjamin's analysis of the blindness of "mass instincts" delineates a subject who, in the interests of self-protection, masters his or her nature by alienating an instinctual wisdom. The irony is that this deformed "animal intuition" can no longer shield humans from the pernicious consequences of conformity.49 As I will demonstrate later, the idea of such estrangement inhabits Freud's writings in the spirit of a buried "in ner animal," or, as the father of psychoanalysis would have it, the primal animus of the unconscious?those residues of the civilizing process cut off by socially mandated repression. Correspondingly, the "external animal" functions as a projection surface for the repudiated beast within whose voicelessness reflects both its banishment from a speech-ready rationality</page><page sequence="13">PRIMAL REVENGE 545 and the foregone conclusion of its unsung demise. This figurative logic challenges historians to hear the animal's projected cries in literature, theory, and the media as an idiom of warning against our forfeiture of survival. Thirty years ago, Luce Irigaray commented that because the "peculiar status of what is called heterosexuality has managed, and is still manag ing, to escape notice," that women on the market fulfill their sublime role as sexual-reproductive commodities by "relinquishing their right to speech and even to animality."50 With this claim, she skirts the anterior ity of the animal's "speechlessness" in humanist idioms, having never possessed the "right" to speak in the first place. It is this prior silence escaping notice that shapes the paradigm of a sentient commodity-object "who" can never turn the tables on its fetishism as such to become an agent of exchange on its own or others' behalf. Hence Irigaray would have been on firmer figurative ground if she had said that commodi fied/heterosexual women gain rather than relinquish animality in being deprived of self-representation. Conversely, if, by animality, she means something like "unreproductive pleasure," then it cannot function as a Utopian antidote to heteronormativity since such "pleasure" among animals never obtains any political intelligibility. The relentless corn modification of critters exceptionalizes and despises their animality as mere instinct or stupid enjoyment (? la Nietzschean forgetting). Of course, the marginalized Other is always silenced if one sympathizes with the early call-to-arms arguments of the New Social Movements. Against this background, it is worth attending to how the notorious legend of animal muteness supplements the idea of the human's an nihilated potential for speech ( subalter ni ty) with (our) expropriated animality. Struck through with immanence, "the mute, benighted beast," as Cary Wolfe sardonically designates it, is not permitted to transcend the logical position of the negated and superseded other since there is no (Hegelian) "for themselves" beyond the instinct to preserve their "in itself existence.51 Indeed, the Hegelian animal in Lippit's interpre tation suffers an a priori death, "a type of pre-extinction. . . . Killed by the word, the animal enters a figurative empire (of signs) in which its death is repeated endlessly" and it is "relegated to the endless returns of abstraction."52 Whole-scale subjection deprives animals of Heidegger's "world" (not to mention Irigaray's pleasurable "animality") and literalizes Agamben's "state of exception" whereby bare life is "included in politics in the form of the exception, that is, as something that is included solely through an exclusion."53 Echoing Foucault, Agamben's "inhuman" is a precipitate of "the con crete ways in which power penetrates subjects' very bodies and forms of life."54 In Remnants of Auschwitz, Agamben locates the grotesque reaches of</page><page sequence="14">546 NEW LITERARY HISTORY biopower in the Muselm?nner, those death camp prisoners whom Primo Levi so eloquently describes as lingering husks of the instinct to survive.55 The silence that envelops the Muselmann as Agamben's "true witness" is the fulcrum of his ethics of testimony. The task becomes to speak for the "true witness" who cannot because he/she/it is no longer: "the one who truly bears witness in the human is the inhuman; it means that the human is nothing other than the agent of the inhuman, the one who lends the inhuman a voice."56 Remnants of Auschwitz anthropomorphizes the inhuman as an annihi lated potential for speech (and "desubjectification" so defined). Yet when he takes up this problem in The Open, Agamben questions the evolutionary imprimatur of an identity between the human and language. In casting this identity as an imperative, "the speaking man places his own muteness outside of himself, as already and not yet human."57 The Open sublates insights he arrived at twenty years earlier, in Language and Death (1982). In that context, Agamben interprets Hegel as granting the animal a voice only in death, whereby it simultaneously expresses and preserves itself as dead. Hegel would identify the meaning-empty animal's voice with pure negativity, with a death that humans inherit only as "immemorial" trace. Capturing this trace, our language becomes "the voice of consciousness" and, thus, the "tomb" of the animal's voice. For Hegel, then, language "truly dwells in the realm of death" because it articulates the "'vanishing trace' that is the animal voice; that is, only because already in its very voice, the animal, in violent death, had expressed itself as removed."58 This morbid trace prowls through Derrida's "The Animal That Therefore I Am," where he declares a "passion" o/and for animals and celebrates the inhabitants of a career-long philosophical bestiary.59 In keeping with his prior critiques of metaphysical segregationism, Derrida's deconstruction of speciesism aligns Heidegger's thinking on the animal's world-absence, or impoverishment, with the logos-and-consciousness hi erarchies of Descartes, Kant, Lacan, and L?vinas. These luminaries write soundly and profoundly, but "as if they themselves had never been looked at, and especially not naked, by an animal that addressed them." Their disavowal remains to be deciphered, Derrida insists, since this figuration of "the animal" "institutes what is proper to man, the relation to itself of a humanity that is above all careful to guard, and jealous of, what is proper to it."60 To counteract a rhetoric of properties, Derrida abandons himself to the eyes of "the wholly other," a feline, who pursues the naked philosopher from the bedroom to the bathroom and out again. What distinguishes animals from man is, in Derrida's analysis, "their being naked without knowing it. Not being naked therefore, not having knowledge of their nudity, in short without consciousness of good and evil" (373). The "naked" kitty on Derrida's tail thus lures the philosopher</page><page sequence="15">PRIMAL REVENGE 547 into a contretemps that plays on the double meaning of je suis for I am/I follow to remember the beasts of Genesis whose creation preceded that of humans. In assuming the authority to name their elders, the naked humans inaugurated the temporality of animals' postlapsarian subju gation: in the Creation myth, "man is in both senses of the word after the animal. He follows him. This 'after,' that determines a sequence, a consequence, or a persecution, is not in time, nor is it temporal; it is the very genesis of time" (386). In the first version of this narrative, the human created male-female "immediately receives the order to subject animals to him. In order to obey he is required to mark his ascendancy, his domination over them, and indeed, his power to tame them" (384). In the second, before he perceives the shame of being naked, which is to say, before original sin, Adam's "free" act of announcing the animals' names transpires "under the gaze of Jehovah who does not for all that intervene" (385). Derrida's "primal theatrics" of Adamic naming self-consciously slips between this prelapsarian divine surveillance and his cat's stare, after the Fall, on the philosopher's naked body. It also uncovers a melancholic crypt where the animal skulks as an "existence that refuses to be conceptualized," but whose naming promises death (379). Citing Walter Benjamin's 1916 essay "On Language as Such and on the Language of Man,"61 Derrida comments on the wounding force of a tradi tion that "assigns to nature and to the animality named by Adam a sort of 'deep sadness' ( Traurigkeit)." This sorrow "would reflect an impossible resignation, as if protesting in silence against the unacceptable fatality of that very silence: the fact of being condemned to muteness {Stummheit) and to the absence of language {Sprachlosigkeit)." While the dejection "of nature and of animality are born out of this muteness," it is also "out of and by means of the wound without a name: that of having been given a name" (388; Derrida's emphasis). Every case of naming foreshadows mourning because it announces "a death to come in the surviving of a ghost. . . . Being called, hearing oneself being named, receiving a name for the first time involves something like the knowledge of being mortal and even the feeling that one is dying" (289). Designation thus confers "mortal existence, for from the moment it has a name, its name survives it. It signs its potential disappearance. Mine also, and this disappearance, from that moment to this, fort/da, is announced each time that, naked or not, one of us leaves the room" (379). The late philosopher's anticipation of his own death cannot leave his bereaved admirers cold. It also recalls a prior foreshadowing of loss: Freud's famous reading in Beyond the Pleasure Principle of his infant grandson's game involving "a wooden reel with a piece of string tied round it" that he tosses with "untiring" frequency over his cot and then</page><page sequence="16">548 NEW LITERARY HISTORY joyfully retrieves.62 The analyst supposes that this so-called "/or?/c?game" symbolizes the infant's anxiety about his mother's temporary disappear ance, but it might have been a prediction: Freud's "Sunday child," Sophie Halberstadt, died of influenzal pneumonia on January 25,1920, the same year he published Beyond the Pleasure Principle. Perhaps the psychoanalyst fails to heed his grandson's premonition of actual danger when deduc ing from the latter's repetition not a prediction of Sophie's passing, but the economic activity of the pleasure principle that mobilizes compulsive symbolization to differentiate and defer the anxious force of a traumatic event. Derrida's almost offhanded reference to this episode, so pivotal to his own thinking on diff?rance, hereby configures a palimpsest of deaths, not least of which is his own. One might nevertheless look to the psychoanalyst for a theory about his grandson's futural "intuition" that the grandfather warded off. In an addition to his 1914-15 analysis of the Wolf Man (published in 1918), Freud speculates about his patient Sergei Pankeiev's belated response to having purportedly witnessed coitus a tergo between his parents. The reverberations of this primal scene indicate that "some hardly definable knowledge, something, as it were, preparatory to an understanding, was at work in the child at the time."63 Freud sees no other solution than to analogize it with the "far-reaching instinctive knowledge of animals."64 He identifies "this instinctive factor" with the nucleus of the unconscious, "a primitive kind of mental activity" that "would later be dethroned and overlaid by human reason, when that faculty came to be acquired, but which in some people, perhaps in every one, would retain the power of drawing down to it the higher mental processes."65 Freud's latency hypothesis reprises Ernst Haeckel's fantasy that "on togeny recapitulates phylogeny" and Sandor Ferenczi's biopsychological replotting of Jean-Bap tiste Lamarck's notion about the inheritance of acquired characteristics to suggest that an individual's development enacts the aggregate history of organic and cultural life. This fantasy structures Freud's vision of the instinctual nucleus of the unconscious comprising the "precipitates from the history of human civilization."66 In keeping with this definition, "[r]epression would be the return to this instinctive stage, and man would thus be paying for his great new acqui sition with his liability to neurosis, and would be bearing witness by the possibility of the neurosis to the existence of those earlier, instinct-like, preliminary stages."67 These leftovers encompass the Oedipus grid and a transcultural anxiety surrounding incest and castration, but also the disciplining of the senses that raised sight above smell and touch among reasoning subjects. In so highlighting the agency of this phylogenetic heritage, Freud undermines his reproof to Carl Jung's theory of inher ited archetypes when he describes it as a kind of "animal" or "primitive"</page><page sequence="17">PRIMAL REVENGE 549 unconscious that precedes the faculty of imagination and therefore cannot be "worn away" in the course of development, which only adds to it. Freud's decrepit pre-Darwinian fictions thus sow the seeds for a theory of inherited repression that Abraham and Torok harvest under the rubric of the phantom. Nicholas T. Rand contrasts the theory of the "transgenerational phan tom" with Freud's ideas about "'archaic heritage,' the inheritance of the actual primeval experiences of humankind." It is entombed memory, an enclave of memory traces transmitted by earlier generations, therefore, and not an instinctual unconscious, that defines the phantom. Rand foregrounds the potential of this theory "to illuminate the genesis of social institutions" and thus "provide a new perspective for inquiring into the psychological roots of cultural patterns and political ideology" as well as its pathogenic expressions.68 To the extent that some people can be said to "unwittingly inherit the secret psychic substance of their ances tors' lives," Rand notes, the phantom "represents a radical reorientation of Freudian and post-Freudian theories of psychopathology, since here symptoms do not spring from the individual's own life experiences but from someone else's psychic conflict, traumas, or secrets."69 As Abraham characterizes, the phantom "has no energy of its own; it cannot be 'abreacted,' merely designated." In addition, "it pursues its work of disarray in silence." He notes that "the phantom is sustained by secreted words, invisible gnomes whose aim is to wreak havoc, from within the unconscious, in the coherence of logical progression. Finally, it gives rise to endless repetition and, more often than not, eludes ra tionalization."70 What is remarkable about this characterization is how, in consonance with a post-Lacanian allergy against Freud's scientism, it formalizes his theses on compulsive repetition as a venue of regulative desensitization that may exceed the pleasure principle. The radical reg ister of this excess, Freud's "death drive," is a primary masochistic urge to restore the psychic economy to an inorganic calm wherein all anxiety, sexual tension, and vital energy are extinguished: "If we are to take it as a truth that knows no exception that everything living dies for internal reasons?becomes inorganic once again?then we shall be compelled to say that 'the aim of all life is death' and, looking backwards, that 'inanimate things existed before living ones.'"11 Freud's conception of a self-aggressive aim that harkens back to the emergence of organic life strains the distinction between a more fun damental (animal) instinct and a metapsychological (and thus human) drive. From a Freudian perspective, it might therefore seem that Abraham metaleptically substitutes an ontogenetic effect for its phylogenetic cause when he recodes death-driven repetition as the form of a phantom that "eludes rationalization." Such a substitution seems to reverse Freud's</page><page sequence="18">550 NEW LITERARY HISTORY tentative standpoint in his Wolf Man addendum that a child "fills in the gaps in individual truth with prehistoric truth; he replaces occurrences in his own life by occurrences in the life of his ancestors."72 As a formalized death drive, the phantom displaces the "animal nucleus" of the Freudian unconscious that comprises its instinctual core?its "prehistoric truth." The "muteness" of the animal wisdom buried within the speaking human is hereby redoubled in the phantom's form. In The Wolf Man's Magic Word, Abraham and Torok oppose encryp tion to the primal defined as the instinctual nucleus of the Freudian unconscious. Encryption refers to a process whereby "the words themselves, expressing desire, are deemed to be generators of a situation that must be avoided and voided retroactively "n Nevertheless, their conception of encryption retains the idea of ancestral life occurrences that fill out their idea of "individual truth" (as Freud says) while nevertheless sidetracking the prospect that such events might silhouette a long-term subjugation of animals that encompasses internal ones. In the history of theory, by extension, "haunting" could be reenvisioned as a conceptual "cloak" for the return of the primal unconscious, which would therefore owe its spectral energy to a more primordial story of transgenerational pro hibition against the animal. This is to underscore that certain traumas are more disavowed than others. A superegoic idea of humanity glides past the tomb of its instinctual prehistory in the course of which in creasingly upright primates secured their dominion over and against their less articulate brethren to become cruelly self-hating animals who brand their kin with unacknowledged traumas. No wonder, then, that the phantom's labor of disarray proceeds so silently: its form rationalizes and thus re-voids an age-old injury against our long-denied lost love for the prelinguistic beast within. Derrida's reference to fort-da connects this haunting love to the disap pearance of any mortal, including animals and philosophers. In privileging speech as human property, Derrida's logocentric philosophers confused its absence in animals for a lack; however, in Benjamin's configuration, naming deprives nature of response by rendering the designators deaf to all but the clipped intonations of their own categories. Our "mutely sorrowful nature" exposes a legacy of civilizing insentience, a failure to partake in the wisdom flowing from nonhuman beings and things. This is an insentience that Benjamin would poetically reverse. For Derrida after Benjamin, it would "not be a matter of 'giving speech back' to animals," but of not constructing them as privation: to hear them "signifying in a language of mute traces," to reawaken our "nonsensuous" similarities in a compassion for the "non-power" of the mortality animals share with us, as he says, in "the anguish of this vulnerability and the vulnerability of this anguish."74</page><page sequence="19">PRIMAL REVENGE 551 This shared vulnerability spurs my conjecture that what Derrida calls carnophallogocentrism75 and Foucault biopower globalize one of Freud's most metaphysical speculations: the death drive as a force of internal surplus aggression operates now, externally, on an industrial scale at the level of population and species rather than the subject. "In the end," Nancy writes, "everything takes place as if the world affected and permeated itself with a death drive that soon would have nothing else to destroy than the world itself."76 We "civilized" moderns numb ourselves to the sources of our anxiety by hewing to patterns that maximize comfort (or "eating well") ,77 Environmental destruction remains a preeminently homogenizing import/export even if, as Francesco Loriggio correctly points out, "there is still no reason to believe that world-wide uniformity is around the corner" as a result of the growing "geographical ubiquity of goods and commodities or the availability of electronic communica tion."78 To the extent that first-world residents take efficient management and convenient service for granted, this is to say, with Xudong Zhang, that all our finest ideological notions, and especially freedom, diversity, multiplicity, and universality, "are essentially libidinal" since consumer ism overdetermines them.79 Death-driven gluttons grasp farm-subsidized security at the expense of biodiversity and deprive the famine-stricken of sustenance. I imitate Freud, then, if I misread the futural import of such compulsive repetitions that deafen me to animals' cries before I follow them into death. IV. Primal Revenge: Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds In a permutation of the age-old motif of "man versus nature," Derrida evokes a war of "unequal forces," which "could one day be reversed," between those who violate animal life and reject compassion and "those who appeal to an irrefutable testimony to this pity."80 If, then, war is not merely waged, as Derrida argues, "over the matter of pity," but, as I have been contending, over futurity itself, then the agenda of a global literary history might be to rally the nonhuman troops for this battle. Before "When Animals Attack" wasted my odd hours, I could turn to Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds (1963) for a pitiless case study on this pitiful matter. Leonard Lawlor enlists Derrida's "war of the species" as "part of globalization," though it transpires under erasure like a "memory of a past that was never present."81 This essay has thus far navigated various theoretical scenarios wherein anthropomorphosis portends the disastrous consequences of such an erasure with melancholic anxiety. What Abra ham and Torok offer to a literary history that would chart the symptoms of this mood is a model of transgenerational foreclosure that extends</page><page sequence="20">552 NEW LITERARY HISTORY a legacy of human crimes against other species; however, the analysts' formalization of the death drive ushers the beast out of the Freudian unconscious while forgetting to reimagine the human-animal link. In teasing out the limits of this linkage, Hitchcock exaggerates a fantasy of species war that loudly reverses the psychoanalytic formalization of the primal unconscious by decrypting a repressed "animal intuition" of imperiled survival. Psychoanalytic interpretations of the film are traditionally predicated on mother-hating misogyny. Accordingly, the birds' violent intervention hastens the aim of Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) to hook up with Melanie Daniels ("Tippi" Hedren), who, by her coiffure alone, bears a striking resemblance to his widowed mother (Jessica Tandy). The bird war not only establishes appropriate boundaries between Mitch and his clingy mother, but also resolves Melanie's Electra complex as she elicits Mrs. Brenner's hard-won maternal love. Melanie's prankster autonomy must be subdued before she can accept masculine law (Mitch is a lawyer) as the condition of successful heterosexuality. The avian onslaught abets Mitch's effort to redirect his sex drive toward an appropriate mother substitute and confirm his adult-male sovereignty. Torok writes that "the phantom would much more likely take the form of an impediment to the subject's instinctual life," which "is cloaked in the very prohibition that, under normal circumstances, regulates and gives concrete shape to instinctual promptings."82 The birds' sudden and inexplicable malevolence certainly "impedes" the "instinctual life" of Mitch and Melanie as they engage in coy mating rituals; however, an Oedipalizing interpretation decodes this intrusion as an externalized "maternal superego," the avatar of Mrs. Brenner's rage about losing her son to another woman. This interpretation might explain why the birds' violence re-cements the Brenners' familial bond, albeit in isolation from other humans, yet it does not account for their propulsion with Melanie from Bodega Bay or, more crucially, for why the birds permit them to leave. In overriding the Oedipal clich?, Lee Edelman's analysis revises Slavoj Zizek's conceptualization of the birds as a sinthome. a concentration of stupid, meaningless jouissance that constitutes not a subject of desire but of a ceaselessly pulsating drive. Edelman's queering of Zizek focuses on the birds' predilection for attacking children in particular as figures of futurity. Children magnetize a heteronormative longing for ontologi cal wholeness and familial security. As Edelman sees it, the birds enact the "sinthomosexual" logic of a death drive that is inassimilable to the heterosexual matrix because it seeks a vehicle for jouissance and non reproductive (coded as "homosexual") enjoyment. Sinthomosexuality paradoxically reentrenches the meaning of familial ideology beyond its decline and deferral by threatening its future. The birds embody the lack</page><page sequence="21">PRIMAL REVENGE 553 in the social order that sustains the nuclear family's moribund status; their targeting of innocent kids elicits our compassion, which recycles the fantasy of bio-ontological completion through maritally sanctioned breeding.83 Edelman highlights one avenue of the global in and as a history of poetic forms when he treats the birds as embodiments of a threat to procreativity, which their "terrorism" would decimate and thus perversely reconsolidate. Even before the assaults on children at Cathy's birthday party and the school, the first act of bird violence against Melanie draws blood when a gull-bomber swoops down on her as she pulls into the dock where Mitch is heading her off after a flirtatious chase. As Edelman remarks, this extraordinary offensive wipes the self-satisfied heteronorma tive smirk off her face.84 In the end, however, the birds' "meaningless" violence provides an obstacle Mitch might rationally overcome in the course of herding an anarchically cagey Melanie into the Brenner fold and assuring the couple's prospects for producing offspring. Edelman's "sinthomosexuality" concept emphasizes the sexual dif ferentiation of a disavowed (and thus deferred) question of futurity, but what happens if we view the "battle of the sexes" (or sexualities) as the foil for an embattled species hierarchy rather than vice versa? The obvious victor would not be heteronormativity, but a negated planetary underclass: birds of different feathers wildly flocking together to pursue a barely surviving Brenner family, with Melanie nesting in Mrs. Brenner's arms, into flight.85 In the eyes of those with a vested interest in the human privilege of feisty heiresses or competent lawyers, the birds' cross-species communion in a class-conscious spirit of revenge will seem uncanny, an "unnatural" malevolence where a dumb and impassive submission to hu man law should be, when it should signify a preeminently rational uprising against long-term subordination and biospheric contempt. Yet to sponsor such a literal interpretation of the "human versus nature" motif in place of a psychoanalytic approach that regurgitates Oedipus is to sidestep the film's ironic performance of anthropomorphosis. Instead, I would like to take this fantasy of animal revenge as a departure point for a reflection on The Birds that unravels Abraham and Torok's opposition between the transgenerational phantom that a cryptonym stages and Freud's concep tion of a deeply repressed archaic heritage that the analysts exclude from their definition of haunting. This unraveling teaches literary historians how to turn a world picture based on silent-animal fetishism on its head while resurrecting the world-forming scope of organic life that beleaguers the humanitarian conscience of political-economic globalization rheto ric. From this perch, the film's protagonists are bellicose animetaphors for a primal unconscious, the irruption of a despotically suppressed self-preservative instinct projected onto a planetary dispossessed, which returns to stab the civilization that conjured it.</page><page sequence="22">554 NEW LITERARY HISTORY On a figurative level, The Birds hyperactualizes Freud's (and Benjamin's) preternatural "animal" wisdom and the repercussions of its repression. Thus, a purported "slave revolt" among murderous birds actually carries out a "primal" return: the death-driven resurgence of a "far-reaching instinctive knowledge of animals" that rationalization encrypted as the "nucleus" of the unconscious. This "instinctive knowledge" haunts the Brenners along with Bodega Bay's other occupiers as the exceptionalized interior condition of the social order, a cryptophoric bequest of the hu man prerogative to imprison birds as pets and poultry. Abraham observes that when staged words are established as social practices, they become recalcitrant to the progressive fading we might anticipate as they pass from one generation to the next. The primal unconscious manifested by Hitchcock's birds shatters this entrenchment from within the aural-visual orchestration of the cinematic image itself. Bodega Bay is, before all, one parcel of land among millions appropri ated from the earth's nonhuman inhabitants, who are literally "world impoverished" by their hunters.86 The birds' boundary-crossing rage exposes this transgenerational tradition of human colonization that has been "avoided and voided retroactively," to borrow Abraham and Torok's phrasing, by the ones who perpetrated it. By extension, if this phantom cannot be exorcised in the social realm, then it may be that the social itself is a phantom of this anterior atrocity, which has been cloaked by the very prohibition against the instinctual that purportedly distinguishes humans from the animals we commodity and cage. Hitchcock's preter natural birds rend this "cloak" as they furiously death-drive the familial figureheads of a tyrannical empire from the Bay. Tom Cohen identifies another front in this primal insurgency against human survival in Hitchcock's Cryptonomies, where he portrays the birds as the director's agents of a global conspiracy against a Western reason that conflates seeing with believing. These merciless "saboteurs" battle an "ocularist machine" with its interiorizing hermeneutics, "the eye's programmed consumptions" and unilateral specularities.87 Whether they blitz-bomb schoolchildren or "their mnemonically drilling teacher," the birds, as Cohen knows, always "go straight for the eyes" (224). Spectators share Lydia's horror on discovering the bloody eyeless sockets of Dan Fawcett at his farm, and we might assume that the schoolteacher Annie Hayworth also meets this fate.88 Cohen sets the terms for a reading of the film that radicalizes the birds' menace not only to the pet-buying and chicken-cooping ownership class but also to congenital productivity, child safety, and a "globality" in Nancy's sense that revolves around humans. At the fulcrum of Hitchcock's "war" from The Lodger to The Birds, Cohen argues, "something unrepresentable is avenging against a totality, a home state and police system routinely</page><page sequence="23">PRIMAL REVENGE 555 under threat of having its interiority turned inside out" (99). In a Der ridean vein, Cohen allies the slashing descents of Hitchcock's birds with the technicity of the film cut, the interval between and against any intentional, referential, or mimetic networks, beyond personification or justice.89 Shots are connected telepathically, that is to say metalinguisti cally. After a blow to a gas station attendant ignites a fire, spectators are co-opted into the camera's de-anthropomorphic point of view zooming in on the birds' prey. The bird network liquidates human signification: they peck away the letters in the opening title sequence, and their impact reticulates a target in the glass of the telephone booth where Melanie seeks sanctuary. If an ecological revenge saga unfolds here, it does not simply empower a "sorrowful nature" to smite its destroyers, but liberates the primal force of modernity's crypt to black out the very power grids of communication that weave the social. On a formal level, the film's nondiegetic music prohibition transfigures the cinematic as-if of a prehistorical, planetary time-before-speech. Hitch cock's evacuation of nondiegetic music pits the aural against the visual, and against the world picture that rests on the latter's dominance, to heighten our sense of the malice spurring his agents' dismemberment of the organs of sight. This evacuation intensifies the chilling, alien quality, not only of the birds' shrieks and wingbeats, but also of their silence as they eerily amass before imminent attacks. No extrinsic warning music prepares us for their strikes; no harmonizing chords reassure us about human continuity when the Brenners escape. This constraint subtends the ocularcentric deafness that muffled crimes against those animals (and "other" humans among them) who did not share the landrobbers' language and who continue to be disenfranchised without a hearing on a planetary scale. The "reality" of this crime is "metapsychological" in Abraham and Torok's sense since it is the subject's "very refusal of [this reality] that designates it as such."90 It may be our "inexpressible mourn ing" for this refused reality that has been "buried without legal burial place," and that erected a secret tomb inside us.91 What we witness in The Birds is how, in Abraham and Torok's phrasing, a "whole world of fantasy is cre ated" as a result of such intrapsychic encryption, "one that leads its own separate and concealed existence." Though sometimes, "in the dead of the night, when libidinal fulfillments have their way," the analysts warn, "the ghost of the crypt comes back to haunt the cemetery guard, giving him strange and incomprehensible signals. Making him perform bizarre acts, or subjecting him to unexpected sensations."92 To extrapolate from Abraham and Torok, the birds' stillness-piercing battle cries are akin to the "word of the desire" that returns from the scandal stifled in the crypt with an altered meaning as a "word thing, the sole survivor of a topographic catastrophe."93 Their uncanny screeching</page><page sequence="24">556 NEW LITERARY HISTORY erupts from an animality internally entombed through civilizing self mastery, or externally, through confinement, industrialized slaughter, experimentation, and deforestation. Miyoshi writes, "Whether rich or poor, in the East or the West, progressive or conservative, religious or atheist," and, I would add, human or nonhuman animal, "none of us can escape from the all-involving process of air pollution, ozone layer depletion, ocean contamination, toxic accumulation, and global warm ing."94 With this ongoing annihilation in mind, a global literary history might heed Hitchcock's mobilization of a primal past against a double crossed future as a blast against the sentimental facade of "silent-animal" fetishism. To compromise biodiversity by razing the earth is to forfeit survival, an irredeemable loss for which we are inconsolable in advance. The absence of nondiegetic music in The Birds turns up the volume on my "cemetery guard" presentiment of revenge as the final showdown of species imperialism. This return of the dispossessed might force the progenitors of Hitchcock's furies to pay attention to sounds we normally ignore, to hear animal cries as harbingers of our mutual death if only we could listen.

Revkin quotes from an interview with the president of Conservation International, Russell A.

In this respect, multi- and transnational corpora tions "curbed the regulatory power of the states, but made use of them whenever it was to their advantage." At the same time, "the state insisted that there was actually no peace; that local, civil, and tribal wars were chaotic and unpredictable, and so even more haz ardous to the United States than the cold war; that religious and cultural conflicts were bound to break out; that the United States and other industrial nations must remain rich and strong to defend civilization; and that corporate wealth best brings prosperity to the general population" (290). 19 In this context, Miyoshi distances himself from an earlier standpoint when he formerly viewed the novel as the form most suited for the literate constituencies of the West that emerged with the commencement of colonialism because, as he remarks, it could be sent out to the colonies far away 'just like an emissary or a command from the colonial office to viceroys or governors in the far-flung corners of the world." However, new circumstances gave rise to new "neoliberal" narratives after the disintegration of the Eastern Block that served to justify an economic imperative to keep the U.S. economy competitive by transfer ring subsidies from the indigent to multinational and transnational corporations seeking cheap labor abroad, employing robotics and digital technology to block labor movements and lower wages while moving production "to places where corporate taxes were lower and environmental or human rights regulations were looser, extracting concessions not only from foreign governments but also from their own municipal, state, and federal govern ments" (Miyoshi, "Turn to the Planet," 290). 20 According to the ideology of "asocialized individualism," as Miyoshi defines it, "[t] hose in need of help are held in contempt as inept, lazy, and superfluous, while the entrepre neurial 'winners' are held in awe as capable, quick, and intelligent. Wealth and power are considered natural rewards for such strengths; poverty and marginalization, on the other hand, are the just desserts of the failures" (Miyoshi, "Turn to the Planet," 292). 21 Miyoshi, "Turn to the Planet," 294. 22 In a 1994 special issue of New Literary History devoted to "Literary History and Other Histories," Christopher Clausen already proclaimed that, "[t]he concept of 'national lit eratures' in English has outlived its usefulness and should be abandoned, both as a way of thinking about literary history and as a way of organizing curricula." Clausen subsequently declares: "Let us therefore say that literature in English is now a thoroughly hybridized stock with roots in many soils. The idea that the literary world has a single center from which normative standards and judgments emanate looks not just outdated but quaint." Christopher Clausen, "'National Literatures' in English: Toward a New Paradigm," New Literary History 25, no. 1 (1994): 61-62. Despite declarations such as Clausen's, my own institutional experience in recent years inclines me to suspect that the rhetoric of a "bor derless world" has not succeeded in detaching quaintly parochial English department curricula from a nostalgic investment in the imperial and colonial mindsets of national canons.</page><page sequence="27">PRIMAL REVENGE 559 23 Arjun Appadurai, Fear of Small Numbers: An Essay on the Geography of Anger (Durham, NC: Duke Univ.

Yet as Rey Chow warns, the "informationalization of knowledge" means that "[p]rompt verifi ability is, of course, exactly the other side of disposability: once 'understood' or deemed plausible, a factoid must be set aside to make way for the next." Rey Chow, '"An Addiction from Which We Never Get Free," New Literary History 36, no. 1 (2005): 50. With our doc trinaire mimicry of the quasi-positivist neutrality of the social sciences, scholars concede the "luxury" of textual pleasure and thereby hasten the decline of literary studies in an increasingly corporatized arena. An interpretative praxis suited to go beyond information will thus be rationalized by its politicized adherents who would mitigate an epistemological castration complex. 31 On the prospect of bridging typically anthropocentric postcolonial criticism with ecocritical concerns, see Huggan, "'Greening' Postcolonialism," cited in note 8; Jonathan B.

O'Brien cites Jameson to underscore the importance of an ironic self-consciousness that might contravene the neoliberal "Third Way" politics of most Western governments that maintain "that economic growth and environmental protection are not only compatible but predicated on one another?that, as Andrew Ross puts it, 'environmental accounting will not hamper capitalism, it will perfect capitalism.'"

In "The Animal That Therefore I Am," Derrida's Jehovah is an archetype for the carnophallogocentrist: He spurns Cain's vegetarian offering in favor of Abel's animal sacrifice, but then protects the envious fratricider from revenge.

It is well known that a gull actually gashed Tippi Hedren's lower eyelid during the filming of the climactic at tack scene in The Birds. Perhaps Hedren took the portent of her sacrifice for Hitchcock to heart when she started her Shambala animal preserve on the edge of the Mojave Desert in California in the 1970s. The preserve provides sanctuary to "dozens of endangered big cats" given up by zoos, circuses, and private owners.

This name "had been bestowed on an ancestor whom the King of Spain had made overseer of the royal treasure-house ('bodega' once meant 'vault' or 'wine cellar')," and apparently the "warehouses built by the later settlers along the bay were also called bodegas." In Paglia's interpretation, then, Hitchcock's "use of the peculiarly unforgettable name Bodega Bay has poetic resonance: as a metaphor, 'Bodega Bay,' evoking both nature and culture, stands for all human life."
