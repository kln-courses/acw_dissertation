<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sublimity and Theatricality: Romantic "Pre-Postmodernism" in Schiller and Coleridge Linda Marie Brooks The Romantic Groundwork In a crusty response to the fashionable new concept called "aes- thetics," Friedrich Schlegel wrote in 1798: "One of two things is usually lacking in the so-called Philosophy of Art: either philos- ophy or art."' Ironically, Schlegel's facetious demand that aes- thetics encompass both discursive and imaginative endeavor has acquired prescriptive status for criticism today, at a time when it appears that one can no more do philosophy without taking into accout the premises of art than one can practice or consider art without, at least to some extent, doing philosophy. Art exists today, or it takes its place in the "artworld," as Arthur Danto writes, only if it is constituted as "art" by philosophical theory.2 Philosophy is done today, as thinkers ranging from Derrida to Hacking have recognized, only by acknowledging its own foundation in the arts. Even science, notes Paul Feyerabend,3 has acknowledged its aes- thetic ground. Thus physicists speak of the "big bang," of "quarks" and "black holes," cognizant of the figurative nature of their lan- guage. The aestheticism occurring across the disciplines has prompted Virgil Nemoianu, in a recent essay subtitled "The Growth of Aesthetic Power,"4 to propose what he calls "neo-aes- theticism" as the only approach to interdisciplinary study suffi- ciently flexible and "open" to be able to accommodate its seem- ingly irreconcilable diversity. Distinct from the "aestheticism" char- MLN, 105, (1990): 939-964 C) 1990 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">940 LINDA MARIE BROOKS acterized by de Man as a "totalizing ideology"5 in a critique which, as Martin Jay has shown, constructs its own totalizing ideology,6 Nemoianu's concept of neo-aestheticism as a process that opens rather than completes and that auto-destructs in the event of its own "totalization" would seem tailor-made for postmodernism's endless proliferation. With art and aesthetic considerations playing such a pervasive role in the emerging postmodern reconfiguration of the disci- plines, it is important to reconsider the period that gave rise to "aesthetics"-the romantic period-and particularly to the shift within that period from an aesthetics of the beautiful, with its ra- tional emphasis on form and unity, to an aesthetics of the non-ra- tional, the formless and the chaotic. So considered, the period and the shift reveal that what we have come to call "postmodernism," the phenomenon described with varying degress of clarity by Jean-Francois Lyotard,7 Ihab Hassan, Andreas Huyssen and others,8 and which is negatively and perhaps most clearly de- scribed by Michael Fried as "theatricality," is in fact romanticism's aesthetics of the negative sublime, an aesthetics still operative and no doubt intensified by the contemporary mass media. What Fried calls postmodern "theatricality" tended to haunt not only the pages of the philosopher who formalized aesthetics, Immanuel Kant, but those of the artists who inherited his brand of sublimity. Schiller and Coleridge provide an illustration. Dropping their "creative" work for philosophical essays-Schiller's serious attempts at po- etry and drama ceased for over ten years and Coleridge's efforts, most agree, were permanently impaired-both poets attempted to neutralize what they considered the anti-aesthetic implications of Kant's theory. Their failure to make an inroad against Kant's third Critique is well known. What has been critically ignored, however, and to the detriment of our perspective on sublimity's importance for the present, is the curiously hyperbolic writing they produced during this attempt. Seen from this perspective, these histrionic passages emerge as the groundwork for what Fried calls the theat- rical "objecthood" of our own hyper-aestheticized era. Although sublimity is usually seen as an intellectual preoccupa- tion of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, its fea- tures have come to define the issues of aestheticism confronting us today. This is perhaps nowhere more evident than in Lyotard's distinction between modern and postmodern aesthetics in which he correctly applies the concept of sublimity to modern art but</page><page sequence="3">M L N 941 then mistakenly tries to argue that postmodern art has moved beyond the sublime. "Modern aesthetics," writes Lyotard, "is an aesthetic of the sublime, though a nostalgic one."9 Lyotard follows Kant in referring to the "sublime" as the supersensible realm of moral/rational ideas which cannot be represented by any sensible medium, or, put another way, as physical matter or natural forces of such awesome dimensions or power that they cannot be in- formed or overcome by the synthetic operations of the imagina- tion. The aesthetics of the sublime, says Lyotard, which he believes to be typical of modernism, "allows the unrepresentable to be put forward only as the missing contents; but the form, because of its recognizable consistency, continues to offer to the reader or viewer matter for solace and pleasure."'0 From the vantage of postmodern art, however, Lyotard finds this modernist aesthetics of the sublime to be defunct. The post- modernist artist is no longer burdened with a nostalgia for form as the remnant or trace of an unrepresentable content. Form need not serve a consolatory, compensatory function since the form- content opposition has itself been overcome by the postmodern artist, who is less a maker than a thinker, less an artist in the tradi- tional sense than a philosopher. Art at this stage is fully self-con- scious, and the characteristic activity of the ironizing philosophical self-consciousness. " I While Lyotard's distinction between modernism and postmod- ernism captures the self-reflexively "philosophical" and hence imaginatively "unpresentable" character of the postmodern, his judgment that for the postmodernist, the modernist aesthetics of the sublime is dead, a mere nostalgic hankering after form, ig- nores an essential feature of postmodernity. For what Lyotard calls the nostalgic "sublime" is actually only the visible, formally presentable aspect of the sublime, and ought properly as such to be designated the "positive sublime." Though Lyotard hints at what he calls the "real" sublime underlying postmodernism and thus moves toward the crux of postmodern aesthetics, he neglects, as do most recent theorists of the sublime and of postmodernity, the necessarily formless and chaotic underside of sublimity-the "negative sublime."'2 The term "negative sublime" is not new. Harold Bloom has used it to characterize Coleridge's fragment poems, "Limbo" and "Ne Plus Ultra" (1811?). However, though Bloom suggests the term's relation to apophrades," the "return of the dead" or ultimate phase</page><page sequence="4">942 LINDA MARIE BROOKS in the development of the strong poet, Bloom tells us neither what the "negative sublime" is, or is like, or what features of the two poems would indicate its presence.'3 Thomas Weiskel's more con- sidered treatment of negative sublimity demonstrates conclusively that the negative sublime-unlike its "positive" counterpart in what Keats called the "egotistical" or "Wordsworthian" sublime- rests on the imaginative inadequacy which grounds Kant's formu- lation of sublimity in the Critique ofJudgment (1790). 14 The purpose of Kant's negative sublime, Weiskel observes accurately, is to ex- pose and hence subvert the illusory or "subreptive" character of beauty's reconciling function, its intrinsic affinity with "form" or with the relational structures of human meaning. Unfortunately, Weiskel's focus on the "structure and psychology of transcendence" leads him to dismiss the negative sublime as something to be "en- countered only in theory or in the Germans."'5 As may be shown, however, the negative sublime not only pervades English literature (theory or otherwise) but becomes a defining characteristic of much of its poetic praxis. This mode of the sublime, which, as Lyotard and others would assert, faces the absence of form head on without any "nostalgia" and which confronts the sheer magni- tude and the multiplicity of matter without offering any idealizing or formalizing possibilities, was implicit in the concept of sublimity from the time of Kant's seminal formulation of it in the third Cri- tique. (It must be kept in mind that in spite of his relegation of sublimity to the function of "mere appendix" to aesthetic judg- ment'6-precisely because of its subversion of aesthetic judg- ment's mediatory role between the realms of his first and second Critiques-Kant was himself unaware of the negative implications of his concept, implications which were only gradually and pain- fully worked out by poets and artists of the romantic period.) Far from being a dead issue or outmoded experience of high romanti- cism or high modernism, moreover, the negative sublime is very much a self-conscious, belated "post-" phenomenon, and is still very much with us today. It in fact constitutes the primary charac- teristic of postmodernity. Sublimity as "Theatricality" The sublime persists as a burning issue in the relatively untheore- tical field of art history itself as the idea of "theatricality." This</page><page sequence="5">M L N 943 term has been popularized by the art theorist and historian Mi- chael Fried, who for the last two decades has denounced the theat- ricality'7 which he detects in a wide variety of artistic periods, styles, and media. As David Carrier has noted, however,'8 Fried's assault on theatricality is essentially an attack against the idea of the sublime. Not that Fried is a postmodernist who is at odds with the principles of modernist aesthetics. On the contrary, Fried is one of the leading spokesmen for a modernist aesthetic today. His hostility to the sublime, under the rubric of what he calls minimal- ist or postmodern "theatricality," will make it clear that it is the idea of the negative sublime that Fried has opposed, and by op- posing it, described with such subtlety and precision. A comparison of Fried's concept of theatricality and the negative sublime reveals the following parallels. First, postmodern theatri- cality is a blurring of all definition, all difference, through the em- phasis of elements that are extraneous to the traditional art object. In postmodern theatrics, the object's physical surroundings-the dimensions of an interior gallery, the surroundings of an exterior setting (the architecture or landscaping), or even the music played in such an environment-and the viewer's engagement with these surroundings equal or surpass the importance of the object itself. As a result, theatricality collapses the generic distinctions of tradi- tional aesthetics: music, architecture, painting, sculpture, ma- chinery, together or in any combination, can constitute an "art- work." Second, theatricality therefore tends to undermine the au- tonomy of the art object itself. In postmodernism, writes Fried, "the more effective-meaning effective as theater-the setting is made, the more superfluous the works themselves become."'9 The idea of the object's intrinsic "value," either aesthetically, histori- cally or monetarily, becomes meaningless. Third, theatricality thus displaces the emphasis upon "shape" or form in art-the expres- sion of totality-for an emphasis upon formlessness and endlessly proliferating meanings. Here, any final judgment of the tradi- tional art object has disappeared. It is not a matter of whether a postmodern work is coherent or incoherent, "good" or "bad" in other words, but only whether it is and remains "interesting." Fourth, theatrical art frequently operates through and depends upon massive scale-the monolithic Lichtenstein or Warhol pieces, for instance-or through perceptual reversals-think here of Magritte-that in "distancing" the viewer both physically and psychically, obstruct his/her attempts to instill the object with fa-</page><page sequence="6">944 LINDA MARIE BROOKS miliar or logical relationships. Fifth, and because of this, theatrical art is a confrontational art, a threatening "presence," as Fried calls it, that disconcerts the viewer and hence denies her/him the sense of relational familiarity, or recognition. Finally, theatrical art func- tions through a radical "objecthood," in Fried's words, or material- ity-either through the noticeable "stuffness" of its medium, or again through one's unnerving sense of its "presence," its ineradic- able "otherness" that refuses to be incorporated into the viewer's mental set. This "stage presence," as Fried calls it, is a radically meaningless, depthless materiality that consistently defies any con- cept or order that would "elevate" it, or cause it to transcend its physical objecthood. According to minimalist spokespersons, such art is, and should remain, sheer, physical, phenomenon. Fried's concept of theatricality reads like an account of the nega- tive sublime. The blurring of distinctions or definitions-the re- quisite subversion of the cognitive understanding-is a major fea- ture of Kantian sublimity. One cannot measure or give numerical definition to Kant's mathematical sublime, any more than one can imaginatively embody Kant's dynamic sublime. They are immea- surable by any cognitive schemata and therefore imaginatively in- conceivable. Second, the disappearance of the object noted by Fried also constitutes an essential feature of Kant's theory of subli- mity. Unlike his contemporary Edmund Burke, Kant judged what is sublime to be not an external object but the supersensible faculty of reason within us. Third, intrinsic to both classical and Kantian accounts of sublimity are qualities of formlessness and massive scale, both of which, as in Fried's theatrical postmodernity, defy conceptualization. Fourth, the effect of Kantian sublimity, like that of postmodern art, turns upon some degree of fear or revulsion, with the overwhelming character of the object posing a type of threat to the viewer. Like the uncanny "presence" of postmodern art remarked by Fried, the sublime obtrudes upon the viewer to such an extent that, as Kant explains, a sudden check of the body's vital motions occurs. Finally, the experience of the Kantian sub- lime is also one of radical materiality, even though ostensibly it is a materiality, as Kant explains, which in its emptiness forces man to higher realms of immateriality-the process of "transcendence" explored in Weiskel. Various thinkers have remarked this curious material emphasis in Kant. Both Iris Murdoch and Paul de Man have called attention to a kind of mathematical tendency in Kant's examples of subli-</page><page sequence="7">M L N 945 mity. To Murdoch, Kant's sublime is "an abstractly conceived, non-historical, non-social, quasi-mathematical totality which is not given but only vaguely adumbrated by the reason."20 To de Man, Kant's examples of the sublime, the "starry sky" and the ocean, indicate a type of "formal materialism" expressed in configura- tions devoid of anthropomorphic significance and impervious to conventional representation.2' They are simply matter, nothing more. Like the empty dome of Kant's starry sky, Kant's ocean is a flat, mirror-like surface, reflecting nothing. What de Man discerns as the "materiality" of "Kant's flat, third-person world,"22 with its lack of any informing intelligence behind it, describes the insistent "objecthood" decried by Fried in postmodern art. Unlike high modernism's "transcendence" of its objecthood, theatrical post- modernism-as in the sculptures of Jules Olitski-"attempt[s] to establish surface."23 "Inasmuch as all objects have surface," writes Fried, "awareness of the sculpture's surface implies its ob- jecthood. "24 This postmodern emphasis upon surface, upon a re- calcitrant objecthood that is devoid of depth, of significance, is the clear heir of the material vision of the Kantian sublime. Postmodern Materiality and Kant's Imaginative Regress The qualities that Fried outlines as postmodern theatricality and that are prefigured in Kant's negative version of the sublime indi- cate an imaginative paradigm which is entirely removed from a rational or "totalizing" aesthetics of the beautiful. In the Kantian sublime, the imagination fails. But more precisely, it is the recon- ciling or connecting function of the imagination that fails, the function by which the imagination makes relationships-what Co- leridge will later call the "coadunative" or "esemplastic" imagina- tion. What is left, Kant writes, is the component of the imagination that makes no attempt to draw relations, that does not connect or reconcile randomness but simply engages it, unordered, in all its chaos. This is the component of the imagination which, func- tioning through a process of what Kant calls "imaginative regress," presides over the aesthetics of the negative sublime. To be sure, Kant asserts that the imagination does intuit relation- ships during an imaginative regress, even though such relations are imperceptible to the subject, "do violence" to the subject,25 and rest on quasi-visionary grounds. Restating Kant's rather tangled</page><page sequence="8">946 LINDA MARIE BROOKS assertion, Rudolf Makkreel explains that during this regress, the imagination's progressive apprehension of a manifold-its incre- mental measuring of a quantity-is halted.26 Prior to this halt, the imagination had attempted to measure or contain a massive object -say, the endless sky, which suggests the idea of infinity-by generating increasingly larger units of measurement-tens, hundreds, thousands, millions. When it becomes evident that no schematic apprehension or imaginative units of measurement will suffice as a presentation of infinity, the subject's imagination is suddenly stopped in its continuing progress on the temporal con- tinuum and, in a single "instant" frozen within time (Augenblick), "comprehends the multiplicity. "27 According to Makkreel, when the imagination comprehends the multiplicity (Vielheit)-as op- posed to merely apprehending the manifold (Mannigfaltigkeit) of sense-the imagination is able to contain or circumscribe a type of whole, an entirety in which all the discrete entities of phenomena can be "intuited," in Kant's words, to "coexist." This ostensible "coexistence"-and one can substitute for "coexistence" the idea of "simultaneity," "identity," and so on-would be evidence to Kant of the existence of unity even during sublimity's duress on the subject. No matter what "negative," "aesthetic" or "instantaneous" char- acteristics one gives it, however, Kant's "violent" intuition of wholeness during sublimity's imaginative regress is still in the ser- vice of reason, that is, it is still a totalizing construct and thus in- trinsically hostile to the encroachment of the irrational. To argue in support of this construct, therefore, as do Makkreel and Ro- dolphe Gasche,28 is to obscure the significance of the religious and regulatory tone that Kant's prose assumes in defense of this intu- ition, a tone clearly designed as a defense against the non-rational character of its negative presentation. As Gasch6 himself writes, what is seen in this moment of imaginative regress is the "unsee- able": The Augenschein is a synthesis of phenomenality in a minimally phe- nomenal manner. In Kant, this synthesis is made possible by the fact that the Augenschein, as soon as it enters into the service of the sublime, no longer sees anything determinate but the unseeable itself.... In seeing nothing determinate but the unseeable par excellence, the Au- genschein thus yields to the law of freedom and Reason ... But, ulti- mately, the unseeable revealed by the Augenschein as the one glance that embraces center and periphery at once, fails to show what it shows.29</page><page sequence="9">M L N 947 Makkreel refers to the same unpresentable nature of Kant's sub- lime, but underscores the regulatory nature of Kant's restrictions: The imagination in the service of the reason can only provide what Kant calls an 'abstract . . . mode of presentation' of the infinite-one that is 'quite negative in respect of what is sensible . . .' (KdU, sect. 29; Be. 115). Any effort to produce a positive representation ... would result in the sort of illusions involved in the cosmological regress and the other antinomies of theoretical reason. A negative presentation can elevate and expand the soul, and at the same time guard against fanati- cism, which is the 'belief in our capacity of seeing something beyond all bounds of sensibility ... (or of going mad with reason)' (KdU, sect. 29; Be 1 16.)30 What becomes clear is that Kant's enforced inadequacy of the imagi- nation, the insistent negativity, functions as a regulative measure, and that what is being regulated against is the non-rational, the possibly "mad" character of the sublime vision (Augenschein) in which, the imagination unleashed, one sees something beyond all bounds of sensibility, one goes mad with reason. The "negative presentation" of Kant's sublime, in other words, is a type of dementia. It is the "fantast" character of Schiller's senti- mental poet who would witness unity, the Coleridgeian imagina- tion's "salto mortale" when it attempts to circumscribe totality. Lyo- tard writes: What is required of the imagination, for this abstract presentation which presents nothingness, is that is should 'unlimit' itself. The fact remains that this extreme painful delight . . . is an Affekt, a powerful affection; and that as such it is blind and thus cannot, writes Kant, 'serve as a satisfaction for reason.' It is even a dementia, a Wahnsinn, in which the imagination is 'unleashed' . . . a 'passing accident which can effect the most healthy understanding' . . . Although it is to be condemned ethically as pathological, 'it is aesthetically sublime . . .'31 Kant would argue that even given the subject's utter helplessness to conceive of the Whole either cognitively or imaginatively (Kant's sublimity being the analogue to actual moral situations absolutely unfavorable to moral behavior) the imaginative regress neverthe- less produces an intuition of unity. Yet as Lyotard shows, this intu- ition of coexistence, on which rational concepts are in fact grounded, is only produced non-rationally, that is, during a mo- ment which itself borders on or is a type of madness. Hence, rather than a rational or "supersensible" concept, the moment of imaginative regress could quite plausibly produce the antithesis of</page><page sequence="10">948 LINDA MARIE BROOKS reason or, more precisely, that which precedes or is beyond a ra- tional/irrational distinction. It is not always the "transcendent" we are working with in such an intuition, in other words, but the non- transcendent, not the "supersensible" but that which, in a moment of extreme non-rationality, locks us within the sensible, within a materiality that refuses to be transcended, ordered or in any way imbued with conventional meaning. This truly "negative" manifestation of Kant's imaginative regress, one not of relationships and closure but of randomness and prolif- eration, which does not lift us above matter but which sinks us into it, illuminates the relation of romantic negative sublimity and post- modernism. Kant tells us that the presentation of sublimity is a negative presentation, that is, that the imagination's failure to present a sublime idea is itself a presentation. Under the rational standards of an aesthetics of the beautiful such a presentation be- comes nonsensical, particularly when applied to artistic practice. How does one represent in art what cannot be represented (a project, significantly, which Lyotard defines as the project of the postmodern)?32 In the artistic praxis of negative sublimity, how- ever, this presentation begins to make a type of sense, if not ra- tional sense, particularly in light of Kant's oxymoronic description of the "regress" that produces it. Describing the ground of this regress, Kant writes: "[T]hat magnitude of a natural object on which the imagination fruitlessly spends its whole faculty of com- prehension must carry our concept of nature to a supersensible sub- strate [iibersinnliches Substrat] (which lies at its basis and also at the basis of our faculty of thought)."33 It is no accident that Robert Paul Wolff calls Kant's phrase "su- persensible substrate," "the last word in mixed metaphors"34 (a confusion unresolved by Makkreel's claim that Kant's "expression 'supersensible substrate of nature' points both above sense and below nature"). For if in the imaginative regress "we are," as Makkreel explains, "carried back to the supersensible substrate as the common basis for both our concept of nature and our faculty of thought,"35 then much as in De Quincey's ironic etymology of the romantic sublime as "sub-limus," or "beneath the mud,"36 what we actually seem to be dealing with is a notion of the sublime turned upside down. When we recall, moreover, that Kant's sudden and unnecessary leap into the supersensible in order to ground his a priori principle of the harmony of the faculties clearly signals Kant's own doubt as to the tenability of his aesthetic</page><page sequence="11">M L N 949 theory,37 then the oxymoronic nature of the phrase "supersensible substrate" begins to assume significance. By stretching the eigh- teenth-century aesthetics of the transcendent sublime too far, Kant's theory in the final analysis unintentionally turns the sub- lime on its head. Instead of soaring upward in some transcendental flight toward the "supersensible," toward some immaterial "truth" decreed by Reason as the "ground" of thought-Wholeness, Unity, Coexistence and the like, as Kant had expected-the sub- ject vaults, in a kind of regressive somersault or salto mortale, into the non-rational "substrate" or incomprehensible materiality of the negative sublime. The Kantian "Regress" in Schiller and Coleridge The writing of Schiller and of Coleridge is fraught with such mo- ments of "imaginative regress," each instance of which illustrates that while an imaginative intuition of "unity" during experiences of the sublime is perhaps theoretically plausible, in practice the op- posite of unity seems to occur. The theatricality of these instances, a theatricality consonant with Fried's definition, indicates a notably fragmented aesthetics (if "aesthetics" is the proper word) that in- trinsically foregrounds its own fictiveness, indeed, that even in spite of the apparent intention of the author, flaunts it. Like post- modernist expression, such self-reflexive "art" casts doubt not merely on artistic intention, but on the absolutism or finality of intellectual structure itself. Though overlooked by critics,38 one of Schiller's many lapses in his argument for a unifying aesthetics of the beautiful may help illustrate the negative process of Kant's "imaginative regress." In Letter 25 of the Aesthetic Education, Kant's stringent concept of "moral" freedom (Autonomie), which requires a strict division be- tween duty and inclination, has ostensibly been vanquished in favor of Schiller's "Kallias" theory of "aesthetic" freedom (Heauton- omie), which "unites" our ethical and appetitive natures. Con- fronted, however, with the stark materiality of the Kantian sub- lime, which intensifies the disjunction between moral duty and human desire, Schiller produces not an intuition of unity but a moment of radical disintegration. At the beginning of paragraph three, Schiller still writes in con- trolled, logical prose, reiterating his main argument: man estab-</page><page sequence="12">950 LINDA MARIE BROOKS lishes his autonomous identity, he writes, his "Ich," through aes- thetic reflection or through the unifying process of the aesthetic "play drive," whereby he objectifies the world and gives it artistic "form." Only through this capacity to give "form" or meaning to matter does man remain free. Suddenly, in an instance of precisely what Kant has called an "imaginative regress," the elements of the unformable sublime enter Schiller's argument; confronted by them, Schiller's concept of an autonomous form-giving self, the possibility of a unifying aesthetics of the beautiful, is, as Schiller describes it elsewhere, "ripped away:"39 To the extent that man imparts form to matter, and for precisely as long as he imparts it, he is immune to its effects; for spirit cannot be injured by anything except that which robs it of freedom, and man gives evidence of his freedom precisely by giving form to that which is formless. Only where sheer mass, ponderous and inchoate, holds sway, its murky contours shifting within uncertain boundaries, can fear find its seat. Man is more than a match for any of nature's terrors once he knows how to give it form . .. Once he begins to assert his independence . . . then ... with noble freedom [he] rises in revolt against his ancient gods. Now they cast off those ghastly masks which were the anguish of his child- hood ... The monstrous divinity of the Oriental, which rules the world with the blind strength of a beast of prey, shrinks in the imagination of the Greeks into the friendly contours of a human being. The empire of the Titans falls, and infinite force is tamed by infinite form. 4. But whilst I was merely seeking a way out from this material world and a transition to the world of spirit, my imagination has run away with me and carried me into the very heart of this latter. Beauty, which is what we were out to seek, already lies behind us; we have overleapt it completely in passing from mere life directly to pure form.40 Aware of his hyperbolic language, Schiller breaks off paragraph three and admits that he has left his rational argument for a uni- fying beauty completely behind. Faced with sublimity's negative regress, which dissolves such questions of "coexistence" or whole- ness, he can only attain to the idea of unity through a non-aesthetic leap of faith. Coleridge's complaint of a similar crisis clarifies the nature of Schiller's turn in this passage: "in basic attempts to answer this . . . question [of the "material Universe" as a "Whole"]," Coleridge writes, "the imagination goes on adding and adding, and as if to hide from itself its perpetual failure . . . it takes the salto mortale, and vaults at once into the transcendental Idea of Infinity. "41 Like</page><page sequence="13">M L N 951 Coleridge's later struggle with the material sublime, Schiller is forced to admit that while the aesthetic ability to give form to ex- ternal phenomena might ensure our autonomous human identity, one cannot give form to the formless sublime-to the viscous con- tingency of empirical phenomena-any more than one can aes- thetically "unify" the divisive moral situations epitomized by Kant- ian sublimity. With disconcerting abruptness, these sublime ex- ceptions intrude upon Schiller, their insistent objecthood, their "sheer mass" as Schiller describes it, "shifting within uncertain boundaries" where an aesthetics of unity, of the beautiful, cannot stand. Abandoning his carefully argued theory, Schiller vaults over Kant's sense/reason abyss into Coleridge's "Idea of Infinity," where "monstrous Oriental divinities" do battle with the Greek gods. Any attempt at philosophical rigor is ignored; all sense of an aesthetic concept lies far "behind" him. He has "overleapt beauty completely," lost in a theatrical rhapsody of the religious absolute. The instance illustrates what could be called the first stage of negative sublimity's imaginative regress, the radical disintegration of a unifying aesthetics in which the imagination's failure to give form to the "material Universe" leads not to an intuition of "coex- istence" but to what Coleridge describes as a salto mortale into the transcendental Idea of Infinity. At this point, the gesture does not represent a positive salto mortale, an ironic "somersault" into an in- verted aesthetics of "unpresentable" materiality. In this early stage it is more closely allied to the literal translation of the term, a "deathly leap" out of any aesthetic consideration and into the non- aesthetic solace of religion. The moment is not one of imaginative triumph described by Kant's "intuition of coexistence." It is a capit- ulation: confronted with matter's intractability, its "inchoate" pres- ence, which is the embodiment of what Fried calls postmodern "objecthood," Schiller's theory of aesthetic unity simply dissolves. A similar disintegration occurs in Coleridge's confrontation with materiality in the form of Hartley's associationist philosophy.42 Throughout Chapter six of the Biographia Literaria, Coleridge sys- tematically outlines the absurdity of the associationist claim that because of the absence of a controlling human "will," a part of one sense impression involuntarily recalls a part of any other, ad infi- nitum, to the point of "delirium." On such a theory, Coleridge argues, the "immense ... impression from the top of St. Paul's church" would become a "hodge-podge" of unordered sense per- ceptions. Contrary to such a "materialist" view, he asserts-with a</page><page sequence="14">952 LINDA MARIE BROOKS striking similarity to Schiller-man is always defined by his auton- omous "will." A case in point, he ventures, is an uneducated Got- tingen girl who having fallen ill lapses into feverish ravings in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. It turns out that she had heard the languages recited in her youth by the pastor for whom she worked and, in her fever, recalled the languages buried in her memory. Coleridge intends this instance as an example of the ubiquitous presence of the ordering human will. But the example in fact doubles back on him, forcing him to conclude that "reliques of sensation may exist in a latent state in the very same order in which they were impressed," that is, completely unordered by the will. This is precisely the associationist argument that Coleridge had set out to overthrow. Confronted with the evidence of materialism and the proliferation of sense impressions into chaos, Coleridge's imagination "vaults at once into the transcendental Idea of In- finity," recreating the speculative maelstrom that occurs in Schiller: This authenticated case furnishes both proof and instance, that reliques of sensation may exist for an indefinite time in a latent state, in the very same order in which they were originally impressed ... this fact ... contributes to make it even possible, that all thoughts are themselves imperishable; and, that if the intelligent faculty should be rendered more comprehensive, it would require only a different and apportioned organization, the body celestial instead of the body terrestial, to bring before every human soul the collective experience of its whole past existence. And this, this perchance, is the dread book of judgment, in whose mys- terious hieroglyphics every idle word is recorded! Yea, in the very na- ture of a living spirit, it may be more possible that heaven and earth should pass away, than a single act, a single thought, should be loosened or lost from that living chain of causes, to all whose links, conscious or unconscious, the free-will, our only absolute self, is co-extensive, and co-present. But not now dare I longer discourse of this, waiting for a loftier mood, and a nobler subject, warned from within and without, that it is profanation to speak of these mysteries Toi Pri6i87omTE (OWTUCv- 0EI6, 43 0E9LOV.) . .. Faced with the intractable character of the associationist argument -the same unordered and "inchoate" mass of material sense im- pressions that confronted Schiller-Coleridge follows Schiller's lead and instantly vaults into a theological idea: the "imperishabil- ity" of all thought. The theatrical passage that ensues, on the no- tions of immortality and a type of collective unconscious, ulti-</page><page sequence="15">M L N 953 mately dissolves, as does the chapter itself, into a quotation in Greek from Plotinus: ... that it is profanation to speak of these mysteries 'To those to whose imagination it has never been presented, how beautiful is the counte- nance of justice and wisdom; and that neither the morning nor the evening star are so fair. For in order to direct the view aright, it behoves that the beholder should have made himself congenerous and similar to the object beheld. Never could the eye have beheld the sun, had not its own essence been soliform . . . neither can a soul not beautiful attain to an intuition of beauty.' The significance of the quote is two-fold. First, by ending his chapter with the claim that he must not "speak of these mysteries" except, in Plotinus's words, to him who "should have made himself congenerous and similar to the object beheld," Coleridge implies that he is himself "congenerous with the object," a state tantamount to the subject-object fusion that, in his system, guarantees man's autonomous control over phenomena. It is a typical Coleridgian ruse. Actually repeating Schiller's failure to control the material sublime, Coleridge selects a quote implying that he has succeeded and that it is his soul that is beautiful, his imagination that can "see" the abstractions of justice and wisdom, just as he can see the collec- tive experience of human existence, a vision that to others would be empty hieroglyphics. Thus, Coleridge implies, he has broken off the argument not because he does not know or cannot explain these mysteries but because he cannot speak of them to the unini- tiated. The second indication underlying his use of Plotinus at this point is that like the Gottingen girl's delirious ravings in Greek and Latin, Coleridge's lapse into Greek or, indeed, into any foreign language, is a characteristic signal that his own language has failed.44 In a broader context, however, the discursive function of language itself has failed at this point, having been reduced to nothing but its material substrate: the "dead letter" of association- ism.45 Like Schiller's theatrical language before the inchoate "mass" of phenomena, Coleridge's words ascend to hyperbole, swollen with italics, exclamation points, and Biblical diction. These instances in Schiller and Coleridge should show that the process of "imaginative regress" that Kant delineates in his account of the negative sublime produces not a "rational intuition" of formal wholeness but a non-rational vision of formlessness and</page><page sequence="16">954 LINDA MARIE BROOKS fragmentation. The passages also begin to suggest that the sublime regress and the fragmented artistic product it produces might de- scribe postmodernism as aptly as romanticism. Both passages dis- play a pattern nearly identical to that outlined by Fried as constitu- tive of postmodern theatricality. The blurring of distinctions later characteristic of minimalism is already at work in Schiller's "murky contours shifting within uncertain boundaries" and in Coleridge's "hodge-podge of unordered sense perceptions." Schiller and Coleridge waver before sublime formlessness ("das Formlose") nearly two hundred years before Fried challenges it as theatri- cality. Both poets struggle with sublimity's overwhelming dimen- sions-its "ponderousness" in Schiller, its massive perspective in Coleridge-much as the postmodern spectator grapples with min- imalism's massive scale. The "check of vital forces," as Kant calls it-Schiller's "fear" ("die Furcht"), Coleridge's "delirium" and "dread"-foreshadows our own discomfiture at minimalism's "threatening presence." Perhaps most significantly, sublimity's in- sistent stuffness-its "sheer mass" in Schiller, its barrage of sense impressions in Coleridge-reminds us that in both romantic and postmodern art, "objecthood" becomes a pervasive and even a de- fining feature. "Limbo's" Sub-Limus: Postmodernism Beneath the Mud The discussion thus far has been of the preliminary stages of this negative aesthetics, of moments that illustrate its subversion of a unifying aesthetic system; we have not seen its emergence as an alternative aesthetics in its own right. Still struggling with the nos- talgic throes of the "sentimental" poets, Schiller could not arrive at such an alternative aesthetics or at an art that could reflect it- though his rejection of beauty's unifying function in his final essay "On the Sublime" (1793, 1801) suggests that had he lived, he might well have done so. It remained for the romantics to create such an art, an art of which we in the late twentieth century- caught in a misnamed "postmodernism"-are the clear inheritors. Coleridge's "Limbo" (181 1?) provides one of the best examples of this alternative art, not simply because it constitutes a clear in- stance of the art of the romantic negative sublime but because it reveals through its programmatic objecthood that contrary to Lyo- tard and others we remain within the negative aesthetics generated</page><page sequence="17">M L N 955 in the romantic period. "Limbo" enables us to recognize the error of equating romantic sublimity with a "nostalgia" for an absolute ideal, with its concomitant desire for "form," and with a definition of sublimity solely in terms of the artist's attempts to transcend the sensible world. In the negative sublimity of a poem such as "Limbo," the romantic artist, like the postmodern artist, attempts neither to regain the possibility of aesthetic "form" nor to tran- scend the chaos of phenomena. From a rational perspective, "Limbo" constitutes an "insane" world, a transitional non-place. In Coleridge's words, it is "all a blank between,"46 a subliminal threshold brought to consciousness as a non-verbal, non-linear dream sequence. Coleridge was sharply aware of the "mad" character of the poem, sending lines 11-30 for publication as a "pretended Fragment of [Nathaniel] Lee," the seventeenth-century English dramatist confined to Bethlehem hospital for insanity.47 The nihilist tone of "Limbo" builds through the entries that immediately precede the appearance of the poem in his 1811 Notebook.48 Coleridge's struggle at this point in the Note- books is a familiar one: the attack on Hartleian materialist philos- ophy.49 Faced with his demoralizing rift with Wordworth, and his continuing failure to produce a coherent theory of the reconciling imagination, Coleridge pens a Notebook entry reminding himself to deduce a stronger counter-argument for the poetic symbol against the materialist encroachments of associationism.50 These charac- teristic deferral tactics51 prove ineffective, however, as the sublime unrepresentability of the symbol's Kantian unity coupled with the subversive materiality of Hartley's theory52 sends the disheartened Coleridge into the increasingly despondent entries which culmi- nate in "Limbo": The sole true Any Something this in Limbo Den It frightens Ghosts as Ghosts here frigthen men Thence cross'd unraz'd and shall, at some dire fated Hour, Be pulverized by Demagorgon's Power And given as Poison to annihilate Souls- 5 Even now it Even now it shrinks them! inwards! and they shrink in, as Moles (Nature's mute Monks, live Mandrakes of the ground) Creep back from Light, then listen for its Sound See but to dread, and dread they know not why The natural Alien of their negative Eye. 10 Tis a strange Place, this Limbo! not a Place</page><page sequence="18">956 LINDA MARIE BROOKS Yet name it that so-where Time &amp; hungry weary Space Fetter'd from flight, with night-mair sense of Fleeing Strive for their last Crepuscular Half-being- Lank Space, and &lt;scytheless&gt; Time with seyth-ele-s branny Hands 15 Barren and soundless as the measuring Sands, Mark'd but by Flit of Shades-unmeaning they As Moonlight on the Dial of Day But that is lovely-looks like Human Time, An old Man with a steady Look sublime 20 That stops his earthly Task to watch the Skies- But he is blind-a statue hath such Eyes Yet having moon-ward turn'd his face by chance- Gazes the orb with moon-like Countenance With scant grey white hairs, with fore-top bald &amp; high 25 He gazes still, his eyeless Face all eye As twere an Organ full of silent Sight His whole Face seemeth to rejoice in Light Lip touching Lip, with all moveless, Bust and Limb, He seems to gaze at that which seems to gaze on Him! 30 No such sweet Sights doth Limbo Den immure, Wall'd round and made a Spirit-goajail secure By the mere Horror of blank Nought at all- Whose circumambience doth these Ghosts enthrall.

A Specimen of the Sublime dashed to pieces by cutting too close with her fiery Four in Hand round the corner of Nonsense 53 Coleridge denounces materialism in "Limbo" in much the same spirit that Fried denounces the theatrical objecthood of post- modern art. However, where the formalist Fried (who is to the minimalists what Dr. Johnson was to the romantics) never allows himself to succumb to the materiality he attacks, Coleridge en- meshes himself in the empty theatrical formlessness of its vision. The imagery with which he depicts materialism in his prose attacks upon Hartley is here martialled as poetic technique, a technique that leads Coleridge himself-whether fully cognizant of the methodological departure "Limbo" represents or not-to write of</page><page sequence="19">M L N 957 the poem: "according to my own fancy [it] contain[s] some of the most forceful lines &amp; with the most original imagery that my nig- gard Muse ever made me a present of."54 In Aids to Reflection, Coleridge maintains his insistence on hu- manity's ordering "will," railing against the "nothingness," the "World of Spectres and Apparitions" that "Materialism's" "Me- chanico-corpuscular Philosophy" attempts to impose.55 In "Limbo," however, he relinquishes the will, ironically engaging the randomness of this "corpuscular" vision. Free of the histrionic lan- guage of his earlier sublime poems "Religious Musings" (1795) and "Ode to the Departing Year" (1796), "Limbo's" negative sublimity presents a world in which Kantian categories of meaning have been stripped away. There is no "space" in "Limbo"; it is "a strange place [but] not a place" (11). Similarly, there is no time: "fettr'd from flight" (13), from the movement that defines its existence, temporality has dissolved. In "Limbo," space is "lank," or volume- less; time is "scytheless," (15) and non-progressive. Both concepts have been rendered meaningless; fundamental categories of human comprehension that have been swept from poetic repre- sentation. From this nadir of incomprehensibility, that is, from the vantage at which one can make no good-faith attempt to impose meaning, Coleridge questions the grounds of conventional knowledge. Drawing on the same imagery he uses to describe materialism, Coleridge turns the field of rational perception upside down in an ironic play with vision and blindness, light and darkness, and per- ception versus mere reflection. Materialism, he writes in the Bio- graphia, is a "blind mechanism" that creates only "lifeless and sight- less notions."56 This fundamental blindness reemerges in "Limbo" as the image of a sightless old man whose gaze is not a perception, let alone a vision, but a vacant, mechanical reflection of the moon's vacantly reflected light. The idea of a passively "reflected" image pervades Coleridge's view of materialist thought: under this dead- ening philosophy, man's "beholding" is "neither an act nor an ef- fect; but an impossible creation of a something-nothing out of its very contrary! It is the mere quick-silver plating behind a looking- glass."57 The image in "Limbo" of the old man's lunar face, of his "moon-like" countenance (24), underscores the passive inter-re- flection of sightless moon and blind man in which both "surfaces" reflect and re-reflect the infinitely regressive emptiness that in- forms the materialist thrust of the poem: "He gazes still, his eyeless</page><page sequence="20">958 LINDA MARIE BROOKS face all eye;- / As 'twere an organ full of silent sight, / . .. He seems to gaze at that which seems to gaze on him" (26-7, 30). The irony is patent. As with the "starry heaven" of Kant's sublime, the sky is devoid of anthropomorphic significance; its moon no more "gazes" at the old man than he, with his flat and visionless counte- nance, gazes at the moon. It is all materialist specularity, quick- silver reflection, signifying nothing. Coleridge's reversal of traditional notions of "light" extends the poem's subversion of conventional representation. At the height of his faith in a "totality" of meaning, Coleridge characteristically equates solar light with logic, truth, and the Logos.58 In the poem "Religious Musings," such totality is likened to the light of the sun at its zenith: "Tis the sublime of man," he writes, "Our noontide majesty, to know ourselves / Parts and proportions of one won- drous whole!"" "Limbo" reverses this solar emphasis, its synesthetic imagery obscuring the solar incandescence of volitional human reason with the passive "delirium" of refractive lunar reflection. Just as the blind man's face is "full of silent sight" (27), an image which confounds auditory and visual perception, so mole-like ma- terialists shun the visual perception of light in order to "listen for its sound" (8). Like time and space, the solar light of reason has no meaning in the poem. "Unmarked" by even a "flit of shades" (17), such "light" is rendered nonsensical by the image of moonlight on the dial of day (18). The moon's reflection, by contrast, cannot be said to "light" the poem in Coleridge's sense of the warming, the "healing" light of unity. Heat without light, and light without heat, are characteristic examples in Coleridge of irreconcilable differ- ence.59 "Limbo" is lit, in other words, with a light that suggests only the impossibility of unity or final knowledge, with a passive, quick- silver reflection of the unordered sense impressions of materi- alism; not with the noontide majesty of rational human meaning, but with the illumination of a hyperbolic point at which madness is indistinguishable from reason.60 The imagistic reversals in "Limbo" subvert the possibility of tra- ditional signification, but the rejection of a traditional poetics of the beautiful, and of the dependence of that poetics on conven- tional figuration as a vehicle of meaning, emerges most clearly in the poem's specular returns upon its own language. The quali- fying and conditional character of the syntax underscores the lucid uncertainty with which Coleridge guides his language. The series of qualifying conjunctions-"Yet name it so," "But that is lovely,"</page><page sequence="21">M L N 959 "Yet having moonward turned his face" (12, 19, 24)-reflects this deliberate linguistic tenuousness, as do the pointedly conditional descriptions-the old man's face is "as twere an organ full of silent sight," he only "seems to gaze on that which seems to gaze on him," and moonlight on the dial of day only "looks like human time" (27, 30, 19). Speaking of the "effete" nature of the language he has inher- ited, Coleridge remarks that even while we would attempt to criti- cize language's inefficacy, we must do so in the same, flawed lan- guage: "Our chains rattle," he observes, "even while we are com- plaining of them."6' With "Limbo," Coleridge deliberately rattles the linguistic chains. The awkward opening phrase: "The sole true Any Something"-which echoes "something-nothing-anything," the same linguistic welter he uses to describe materialism else- where-plays self-consciously on the incapacity of language to sig- nify with any accuracy. Coleridge's ironic quip that although Limbo is "not a place," one may "name it so," suggests the same incapacity. Certainly, he implies, no "name" can appropriate "Limbo." The poem's self-reflexive tendencies to oxymoronic punning-"positive negation," "natural alien," and "negative eye" -and to hyphenated coinages-"Half-being," "Spirit-jail," "aye- unepithetable," and "Nought at all"-extend this specular lin- guistic play. The poem calls not merely its diction but its own im- agery into doubt as Coleridge doubles back in a self-conscious cancellation of his figure "moonlight on the dial of day": "But that is lovely,-looks like human time" (19). "That," the "lovely image," in other words, simply will not do in the poem. In fact, no image will do. Aware that the confrontation with negative sublimity, with the corpuscular materiality which constitutes his poem, is ration- ally unpresentable, beyond conventional figuration, Coleridge consciously directs his language, and his art, back upon itself in a questioning of its authenticity. In "Limbo," Coleridge's dream, the idea of as aesthetically tran- scendent meaning, is gone. The poem surpasses the project of pos- itive sublimity, those "deathly leaps" into a religious dream. Like postmodern art, the poem is instead an ironic hyperbole, a salto mortale into a theatrical play with the unrelieved "objecthood" of phenomena. With "Limbo," Coleridge relinquishes his insistence upon man's rational "will" and acknowledges free rein to what he calls the poem's "anarchical hell of conscious madness." Its nega- tive sublimity, and its triumph lies in Coleridge's ability to draw</page><page sequence="22">960 LINDA MARIE BROOKS from within an unmeaning materiality in order to present it, and perhaps outdo it, in all its visceral contingency. It is this project that Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe has characterized as intrinsically postmodern: "One can only outdo the uncanny," he writes, "from within the uncanny."62 Objecthood and Beyond Clearly, the imaginative regress of sublimity-the sudden halt of formalizing and signifying activity-can produce not a sense of coexistence and unity but one of disjunction and heterogeneity. Intrinsic to the negative manifestation of this moment, moreover, is the obtrusion of what Fried discerns in postmodern theatricality: the sudden sense of a radical and untranscendable objecthood, the encroachment of sheer material stuff, endlessly proliferating, end- lessly uncontainable, in which all distinction, all conventional meaning, dissolves. What thus seems to occur in such negative in- stances of imaginative regress is the phenomenon that Baudelaire has called the "infinite regress" of absolute irony, a type of bot- toming out or collapse of the imagination's structuring impulse (allied with the transcendent aesthetics of the beautiful) and the emergence of an impulse toward unaffiliated randomness and dis- order (expressive of the nontranscendent aesthetics of the nega- tive sublime). "Limbo" exemplifies the art of this latter mode. It reflects a hyperbolic acknowledgement of the insurmountability of nature-essentially, the mutability of existence-in which pri- mary ordering structures are reversed or even abandoned alto- gether in a conscious play with the disarray of material phe- nomena. All the elements of Kant's negative sublime, and Fried's postmodern theatrics, inhabit Coleridge's poem: the formlessness or unpresentability; the dispersion of our ordering concepts of space and time; the frank, almost vulgar insistence upon the in- comprehensible. One can find little distinction between the post- modern project outlined by Lyotard-in which the philosopher- artist has already denied himself the possibility of "form" by which he might have continued his "nostalgia" for the unattainable-and the negative sublimity of "Limbo." Indeed, one is hard-pressed to find a vast departure between the play of "Limbo" and much of postmodern art, criticism and philosophy (if one can still make those distinctions). As Fried notes, all of it is confrontational and</page><page sequence="23">M L N 961 aggressive; all of it admittedly grounds itself on a kind of dissimu- lative theatricality, on a type of "stage presence," as Fried calls it, with its hyperbolic insistence on its own artifice and thus on its own objecthood. But how could it not, when the ground or the fiction of "real" presence has, at least for the time being, been set aside?

While Tillotama Rajan has usefully pointed out the importance of Schiller's flawed logic, her account of Schiller's significance for romanticism is based on the study of a single Schiller essay, Naive and Sentimental Poetry, a limitation which causes her to collapse several of Schiller's crucial dis- tinctions. "The sentimental poet," Rajan writes, "acknowledges the real world of which the naive poet is unaware, but he is governed above all by the desire to idealize, to reapproximate to the naive" (31). However, in his discussion of the pastoral idyll, Schiller makes clear that there is no "reapproximating" to the naive, and in his lengthy discussion on the sentimental "fantast," Schiller repeat- edly insists that the dangers inherent in the sentimental poet are his lack of touch with and not his "acknowledgment of" the real world. These and similar blurrings have led Rosemary Ashton to observe that "Rajan gives no clear sense of what Schiller . .. meant by 'naive' and 'sentimental.' In the course of the book she uses 'sentimental' as a term opposed sometimes to 'ironic,' sometimes to tragic,' and even-puzzlingly-to 'romantic.'"

The possible equation of such "interruptions" with "reason," and of what has been interrupted with the nonrational or transgressive (what Coleridge calls the "streamy" or the "eddying" movement of the lawless imagi- nation) is, if unexplored, highly suggestive.
