<plain_text><page sequence="1">REBUILDING THE STATE IN HIGHLAND PERU: HERDER-CULTIVATOR INTERACTION DURING THE LATE INTERMEDIATE PERIOD IN THE TARAMA-CHINCHAYCOCHA REGION Jeffrey R. Parsons, Charles M. Hastings, and Ramiro Matos M. We address the general problem of .sociopolitical evolution in highland Peru during the Late Intermediate period (ca. A.D. 1000-1470) from the perspective of changing relationships between herders and cultivators in the Tarama-Chinchaycocha region. First, we use ethnographic and ethnohistoric information to help model central Andean herder-cultivator interaction. Here we emphasize the ecological and sociologicalfoundations for economic .specialization, the ritually based integration of pastoral and agricultural groups in the absence of strong state organization, and how the ritually interactive units define and maintain their borders. Second, in the light of these perspectives, we examine archaeological settlement pattern data from our study area in the central highlands of Peru. We co71clude that the Late Intermediate period was a time of significant orga- nizational change that included new forms of ritually based local and regional integration of pastoral and agricultural economies. Third, we briefly consider the general implications of our findings for understanding organizational change throughout the central Andean highlands during the Late Intermediate period. We sugge.st that the largest and most complex Late Intermediate highland polities depended on the full integration of .specialized pastoralists and agriculturalists in those regions where both economie.s could attain maximal combined productivity in the aftermath of the breakdown of large states at the end of the Middle Horizon (ca. A.D. 600-1000). Nuestro intere'us general es la evolucion sociopolftica en la sierra peruana durante el periodo Intermedio Tardfo (ca. 1000-1470 d. C.). Tomamos en cuenta dato.s sobre patrones de a.sentamiento regional, que nos informan sobre cambios en las interacciones entre pastores y agricultores. En la primera se intenta formular un modelo para los Andes centrales, que versa sobre la interaccion entre pastores y agricultores durante el periodo Intermedio Tardfo utilizando la informacion etnogra'fica y etnohistorica. Ponemos e'nfasis en los fundamentos ecologicos y sociologicos para explicar la especializacion en la economfa, basada ritualmente en la integracion entre grupos de pastores y agricultores, frente a la ausencia de una poderosa organizacion estatal. En la segunda, a la luz de esta perspectiva, con los dato.s arqueologicos, analizamos el patron de a.sen- tamiento de la region Tarama-Chinchaycocha, en la sierra central del Peru. Aunque se pone e.special e'nfasis en el periodo Intermedio Tardfo, consideramos oportuna una breve explicacion .sobre lo.s antecedente.s en el horizonte Medio (ca. 600-1000 d.C.) y en el periodo Intermedio Temprano (ca. 300 a.C5.-600 d.C.). Concluimos .senalando que el periodo Intermedio Tardfo fue un tiempo en el cual ocurrieron serios cambios en la organizacion, que incluyeron a las nuevas formas locales como base de ritual y de la integracion regional en la economfa de pastores y agricultores.

These tradi- tional interpretations have been formed largely on the basis of ethnohistory.Without increased archae- ological input, it is impossible to obtain a sufficient understanding of key processes in the development of pre-Inka organizational complexity that must extend back in time well before the fifteenth cen- tury. This paper addresses this general prob]em by examining archaeological settlement patterning from the Tarama-Chinchaycocha region in the Peruvian central highlands (Figures 1 and 2).' We focus on the relationships between pastoralists and agriculturalists during the Late Intermediate period because they provide a particularly good perspec- tive on both local and regional sociopolitical orga- nization. To obtain a view of long-term change, we also explore the antecedents of the Late Intermediate period patterns.) Our study cannot deal directly with the specifics of how or why the Inka state came to be centered at faraway Cuzco. Nevertheless, this effort may suggest some useful lines of inquiry into how orga- nizational complexity developed generally throughout the central Andean highlands after the Middle Horizon. This might, in turn, provide a basis for thinking in new ways about why and how a uniquely large and complex polity emerged in the Cuzco region during Late Intermediate times. The Cultural Ecology of Historic Central Andean Herders and Cultivators Here we attempt to discern the key relationships between economy, social structure, and ritually based integration of herders and agriculturalists in the absence of strong state organization. We are particularly interested in developing a sense of the expectable relationships among the size, compo- sition, location, and boundary definition of inter- active social units. We do not expect that any of these historically documented characteristics and relationships will necessarily find specific mani- festations in our archaeological data. Rather, we seek a conceptual framework that will help us interpret the archaeological data at our disposal. The Complementarity of Herding and Cultivating Economies In the central Andean highlands two main tradi- tional economies are deeply rooted in the Prehispanic past: (1) camelid herding2 in the high puna grasslands (ca. 3,800 to 4,700 m asl), and (2) cultivation of tubers, cereals, legumes, and cucurbits in the intermontane kichwa valleys (ca. 1,500 to 3,700 m asl) (Troll 1958, 1968). Although some local communities and individual households effectively combine herding and cul- tivation, a notable degree of spatial separation also exists between specialized herders and culti- vators.3 Access to both herding products and cultivated plants is essential for highland populations (Flores 1979; Harris 1985; Nachtigall 1975; Thomas 1976; Tomoeda 1985; Winterhalder and Thomas 1978; Yamamoto 1985). Without herd- ing, the entire puna zone would have remained marginalized and peripheral. Without access to dependable supplies of tubers and cereals pro-</page><page sequence="3">319 Parsons et al.l HERDER-CULTIVATOR INTERACTION IN THE PERUVIAN LATE INTERMEDIATE Figure 1. Peru, showing location of Tarama-Chinchaycocha region. Ecological Basis for Separation of Specialized Herders and Cultivators The central Andean puna provides large expanses of good pasture but is only marginally suitable for plant cultivation (especially at elevations above ca. 4,0()0 m asl); conversely, large numbers of lla- mas and alpacas are rare in the intensively culti- vated kichwa valleys below ca. 3,700 m asl (Troll 1958, 1968; Winterhalder and Thomas 1978). duced in the kichwa, the diets of most puna herders would have remained nutritionally incom- plete. Without access to the textiles, pack-animal transport, meat, skins, and dung (for fertilizer and fuel) produced in great quantities only by puna herders, kichwa cultivators would have lacked adequate supplies of some of their most basic raw materials for tools and clothing and would have found their diets much less varied and appealing.</page><page sequence="4">320 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY lVol. 8, No. 4, 1997 Figure 2. The Tarama-Chinchaycocha region showing major modern settlements, streams and outline of survey area. Generally speaking, where puna and kic1awa zones interdigitate closely, and local vertical relief is relatively high, there is a greater tendency for herding and cultivating to be combined at the household and settlement levels (e.g., Brush 1976; Inamura 1986; Valle 1970; Webster 1973; Yamamoto 1981). Where the two zones are sepa- rated by greater distances, and where local verti- cal relief is relatively low, herders in the puna and cultivators in the kichwa are more likely to be specialized and separated (e.g., Browman 1974; Flannery et al. 1989; Flores 1979; Fujii and Tomoeda 1981; Harris 1985; Platt 1982; Yamamoto 1985). In part, this has to do with the high labor demands for each set of activities, and that these demands often conflict with each other in terms of both scheduling and the adequacy of local labor pools (McCorkle 1987). Domestic camelids must be penned up in walled corrals at night and taken out to pasture each day. Flocks must be moved around with some frequency in order to have access to ade- quate pasture throughout the annual cycle (Flores 1979; Orlove 1977). Adult male animals must be periodically separated from groups of females and young in order to control reproduction, and different varieties of camelids must be kept sepa- rate in order to prevent interbreeding and the con- sequent loss of such desirable traits as large physical size, hair color, or hair quality (Custred 1977; Flores 1986; Palacios 1977). The lambing season is a particularly critical time, when preg- nant female animals and their vulnerable young demand special attention. Agriculturalists, on the other hand, must be concerned with the demands of field preparation,</page><page sequence="5">Parsons et al.l HERDER-CULTIVATOR INTERACTION IN THE PERUVIAN LATE INTERMEDIATE 321 planting, weeding, caring for growing crops, guarding and harvesting mature crops, and main- taining an infrastructure of terraces, irrigation canals, and field walls (Matos et al. 1958). Many of these tasks must be performed at the same times as some of the most demanding activities related to herding. Furthermore, crops can be seri- ously menaced by the predations of domestic ani- mals. Consequently, where herding and cultivation are locally combined, cultivated fields must be strongly fenced and/or the daily move- ments of local flocks must be carefully controlled (McCorkle 1987). Traditional Andean agriculture depends on a variety of sectorial fallowing regimes that main- tain long-term soil fertility and minimize the risk of poor harvests for individual households (e.g., Camino 1980; Goland 1992; Guillet 1981; Mayer 1985; Orlove and Godoy 1986). These regimes demand considerable investment in administra- tion, definition and protection of community ter- ritory, and walking back and forth between scattered fields. If some members of agricultural households also need to devote themselves to the care of domestic animals in higher pastures well away from their main residences, then additional walking and prolonged camping would be neces- sary. Ritual Integration of Specialized Herding and Cultivating Economies Andean ethnography and ethnohistory contain numerous descriptions of the ritual interaction between herders and cultivators. In this section we highlight some of the components of this interaction that seem most useful in modeling prehistoric social relationships over space between these groups. Anthropomorphic Landscapes. Ethnographic studies of the isolated Qollahuaya in Bolivia (Bastien 1978) describe local groups (ayllus), typically of many hundreds of individuals who occupy well-defined territories extending over areas measuring several dozen kilometers in length and width.4 These ayllu groups incorporate dispersed settlements of specialized puna herders and kichwa cultivators into integrated socioeco- nomic units. Ayllu borders are defined by major quebradas (valleys) where ritual performances linking adjacent ayllus occur. Qollahuaya ayllus maintain their territorial integrity and socioeconomic integration through belief systems that emphasize the role of human beings as components of anthropomorphized landscapes. Both living and dead human beings are key agents in maintaining the well-being of these landscapes. The living accomplish this essential task by adhering to rules about marriage, residence, exchange, burial, and ritual. People, places, and products are all endowed with com- plementary qualities that derive in large part from their origin in different elevation zones, and all components of the living landscapes are "nour- ished" by their associations over time and space with people, products, and places possessing eco- logically complementary qualities. It is by means of ritual offerings at ayllu shrines that the living landscape is nourished. Each such ritual offering involves products from all of the main ecological zones, as well as the presence and participation in the ritual of people who are associated with each of these zones. The largest shrines and the most important rituals typ- ically occur at intermediate locations on, or near, the puna-kichwa border. Burial Ritual. The importance of deceased ancestors and their mummified or interred remains in household, community, and imperial ritual is well documented (Allen 1982; Bandelier 1904; McEwan and van der Guchte 1992; Salomon 1995; Zuidema 1973, 1977, 1990). These sources describe the public veneration of ancestor mummies, public feasting, and public renewal of burial offerings. Regional Pilgrimages. Several studies (e.g., Poole 1982, 1991; Reinhard 1985; Sallnow 1987, 1991; Zuidema and Poole 1982) emphasize the importance of major ecological junctures (often where principal puna and kichwa zones border one another) as the loci of regional pilgrimage shrines. These pilgrimages typically incorporate multicommunity groupings of puna herders and kichwa cultivators who interact at these strategic loci to ensure continued productivity and interac- tion through feasting, dancing, material exchanges, and ritual offerings. Ritual Fighting. An extensive literature (e.g., Gorbak et al. 1962; Hopkins 1982; Orlove 1994; Platt 1986; Skar 1982) describes practices, extending back at least 200 years, of regularly</page><page sequence="6">322 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 8, No. 4, 1997 scheduled intracommunity and intercommunity ritualized conflicts (tinku). These feature con- frontations between groups of young men armed with slings, bolas, whips, or clubs-, who are sup- ported by groups of women and older men who perform dances, prepare feasts, and encourage the fighters. The total number of participants varies from several dozen to several hundred. Senous injuries and even deaths occur, and there is some indication that these, and the flow of human blood in general, are esteemed as signs of future good harvests or successful animal breeding. These ritual battles are often competitions between moieties of dually structured communi- ties. When intravillage moieties are involved, the settlement itself becomes the "stage" for ritual fighting, and the centrally located cemetery and church situated on the border between the two divisions are the loci for fighting, feasting, or avoidance. Ritual conflicts also are reported (Hopkins 1982; Platt 1986; Skar 1982) between more distantly linked, multivillage groupings that share common sociopolitical borders along which ritual fighting occurs. Duviols (1973) notes a deep-seated distinction in the seventeenth century between adjacent groups of puna herders ("los lacuaz") and kichwa cultivators ("los huari") in the Peruvian central highlands. This dual opposition was manifested in several ways, including occasional physical violence; marked distinctions in language, cos- tume, and association with different supernatural forces and different sacred places; exchange of complementary products; and bi-ethnic commu- nities. Of particular interest is Duviols's (1973:175) mention of the "Danza de Guari-Libiac" ("Danza de Guerra"), an important ceremony in the inte- gration of potentially hostile groups of herders and cultivators. This ritual-fighting performance appealed to the long-standing differences between puna herders and kichwa cultivators, emphasizing their traditional enmity while pro- viding a ritualized basis for enduring interaction. The Danza de Guari-Libiac might be an ancestral form of modern ritual fighting, and perhaps a descendant of Prehispanic forms of ritualized herder-cultivator interaction.5 Structures of Duality and Tripartition There is an extensive literature on Andean struc- tural duality and tripartition at all organizational levels (e.g., Gow 1978; Harris 1985; Izko 1992; Murra 1968; Netherly 1990, 1993; Paerregaard 1992; Palomino 1971; Rostworowski 1983; Sallnow 1991; Wachtel 1973). We already have noted the significance of structural duality in rit- ual fighting and in the performance of other inte- grative Andean ritual. We also have referred to the differentiation between puna herders and kichwa cultivators in the conceptualization and definition of this duality. Any formal distinction between two sectors can create a formally defined border that may function as a third division. In some cases this becomes the location where public rit- ual linking the two sectors is performed at ceme- teries, churches, shrines, processional routes, or feasting rooms. Summary Based on the above, we have reached the follow- . , . ng concluslons: (1) Herding and agriculture are basic, comple- mentary components of central Andean highland economy. Neither is complete or sufficient in iso- lation. (2) Herding and agriculture may be combined within a single household or settlement. However, several factors encourage specialization and phys- ical separation between puna herders and kichwa cultivators. (3) Ideology and ritual play a major role in the integration of specialized puna herders and kichwa cultivators. Ecological variability, struc- tural duality and tripartition, and the metaphor of living landscapes provide the conceptual founda- tion for this integrative ritual. The fundamental purposes of ritual performances are (a) to define and maintain social borders and (b) to ensure con- tinued productivity of the bordered units and ongoing interaction between them. Moiety bor- ders and the junctures of puna and kichwa zones stand out as the loci where these rituals are per- formed. Rituals range from simple material offer- ings at modest shrines, to feasting and dancing in association with ancestral tombs or mummies, and to elaborate ritual battles and pilgrimages.</page><page sequence="7">Parsons et al.l HERDER-CULTIVATOR INTERACTION IN THE PERUVIAN LATE INTERMEDIATE 323 Archaeological Record of Preinkaic Herders and Cultivators in the Tarama- Chinchaycocha Region In this section we discuss Late Intermediate- period settlement patterns and their antecedents In addition to residential settlements, we also con- sider the distributions of camelid corrals, "defen- sive" walls, storage facilities, and cemeteries all of which contribute to an understanding of public ritual and sociopolitical integration at local and regional levels. We are particularly interested in archaeological data suggestive of different levels of interaction between bordered units. Our data indicate that new forms of ritually sanctioned integration developed during the Late Intermediate period. We suggest that these new integrative mechanisms were founded in (a) the economic complementarity between herders and cultivators and (b) an ecologically based cosmol- ogy that emphasized boundary definition and maintenance through burial ritual and ritual fight- ing. The Regional Survey: Objectives, Design, and Limitations Systematic, full-coverage archaeological surface survey was carried out in two six-month field sea- sons during May-December 1975 and 1976.6 Our immediate goal was to cover as much terrain as possible in each of three distinct zones (Figures 1 and 2): the Junin puna (prime camelid pasture, ca. 3,9004,600 m asl, and the principal zone of Chinchaycocha occupation); the deep kichwa val- leys (intensively cultivated terrain, ca. 2,800-3,800 m asl, the principal zone of Tarama occupation) immediately east and southeast of the Junin puna; and, farther south, the main Mantaro Valley (an extensive agricultural zone, ca. 3,400-3,800 m asl) around the modern town of Jauja (the core of Wanka occupation, a region that we do not consider in this paper). The surveyed puna and kichwa zones occur in two main, inter- digitating blocks (Figure 2). These two zones are separated by distances of up to several dozen kilo- meters; only along the bordering interface is there close proximity between them. Working in teams comprising two to three members walking at intervals of 20-50 m over all surveyable terrain, we examined approximately 800 km2 of puna and 500 km2 Of kichwa. The borders of our survey coverage are arbitrary, defined simply by how much terrain could be examined from our field bases. Our inferences are founded on data that remain chronologically imprecise, especially for the long Early Intermediate period and Middle Horizon, which we are usually forced to lump together (as EIP/MH) (Table 1).7 Nevertheless, our distinct impression is that most of what we label EIP/MH pertains to the late Early Intermediate and Middle Horizon. When Inka-style pottery co-occurs with local Late Intermediate ceramics, we cannot be sure whether the occupation is pure Late Horizon (ca. A.D. 1460-1532) or a mixture of Late Intermediate and Late Horizon (we usually label such sites LIP/LH). On the positive side, surficial preservation of stone architecture throughout the survey area is often extraordinarily good at Late Intermediate sites. Thus, we are particularly confident about our ability to recognize Late Intermediate resi- dential, storage, and burial structures. Settlement Categories Most of our Late Intermediate settlements fall into two general categories: "herding settlements" in the puna, and "agricultural settlements" in the kichwa (Table 2). Residential occupation is inferred from the ubiquitous presence at these sites of numerous well-made circular structures, averaging 4-6 m in exterior diameter, for which excavations in several highland areas have revealed domestic functions (e.g., Hastings 1985; Hastorf et al. 1989; Lavallee 1973; LeBlanc 1981). For most Late Intermediate puna settle- ments, with their clusters of stone-walled corrals around the outer margins of hilltop residential areas, it is easy to infer a herding function. Late Intermediate kichwa settlements never have such associated corrals, and so we label them "agricul- tural," and assume the absence of a significant herding function. Late Intermediate settlements, both in the puna and the kichwa, occur in the full range of size classes (Table 2). Particularly intriguing are 15 unusual Late Intermediate settlements all at elevations of ca. 4,000 m asl near the ends of high, narrow ridges that extend eastward from the edge of the main</page><page sequence="8">Table 2. Settlement Typology.  5). Virtually every puna settlement (except for the special function settlements noted above) is closely surrounded by clusters of corrals, and numerous isolated corrals and small herding camps with associated corrals are scattered throughout the main Junin puna (not shown in Figure 5). Similarly, in the adjacent kichwa a comparatively dense concentration of Late Intermediate ridge-top settlements, completely lacking corrals, lies along the margins of the val- ley floors. Multisettlement Clustering A simple inspection of overall settlement config- uration suggests that different regional organiza- tion for our Early Intermediate/Middle Horizon vs. Late Intermediate occupations. Early Intermediate PeriodlMiddle Horizon (EIPIMH). We can define seven spatial clusters of EIP/MH concentric-ring sites: six in the main Junin puna (Clusters A, B, C, D, E, and F), and one farther east on the puna fringe (Cluster G) (Figure 4, Table 5). Nine other such sites may be 324 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY lVol. 8, No. 4, 1997 Junin puna. These sites, all with evidence of sub- stantial residential occupation, are unusual in three ways: (1) they include some of the very largest Late Intermediate settlements in our sur- vey area; (2) they lack associated camelid corrals (which virtually all other such puna settlements have); and (3) the local productive potential of both herding and plant cultivation is quite limited. These settlements occupy the narrow crests of high ridges (Figure 3), many hundreds of meters above the prime agricultural lands at lower eleva- tions in the surrounding kichwa valleys, and sev- eral kilometers east of the extensive grasslands in the main Junin puna. We categorize these sites as "special function settlements." It is more difficult to infer residential, herding, or agricultural functions for our more poorly pre- served EIP/MH sites. In most cases we simply assume that vague mounding, rock rubble, and surface pottery are indicative of domestic occupa- tion. We differentiate herding vs. agricultural set- tlements on the basis of site elevation, attributing herding functions to puna sites and agricultural functions to kichwa sites (we recognize the poten- tial circularity of this reasoning). In only a few cases do we have corrals that can be dated to the EIP/MH. However, the inhabitants of our EIP/MH "concentric-ring sites" (Table 2) in the main Junin puna, with their two or three concen- tric rings of stone-walled enclosures, may have penned up camelids within the outermost enclos- ing wall of these compact hilltop settlements. Long-Term Trends in Population Growth We estimate that between ca. A.D. 500 and 1450 population expanded two to four times (Tables 3 and 4). With roughly 1,200 households for the EIP/MH and 5,000 households for the Late Intermediate (Table 4), and assuming five persons per household, the population nlay have increased from ca. 6,000 to 25,000. The Subsistence Economy During the EIP/MH what appear to have been generalized agricultural-herder groups increased in some kichwa valleys. At the same time, in the main Junin puna herding activity intensified and expanded markedly (Figure 4). The Late Intermediate saw intensification in both puna herding and kichwa cultivation (Figure Category Agricultural settlements Class A Class B Class C Class D Class E Herding settlements Class A Class B Class C Class D Class E Special function settlements Class A Class B Class C Concentric-ring sites Very large Large Small Very small Defining Characteristics below 3,800 m asl; absence of associated corrals more than 100 households 51-100 households 21-50 households 6-20 households 1-5 households above 3,800 m asl; associated corrals more than 100 households 5 1-100 households 21-50 households 6-20 households 1-5 households above 3,800 m asl; no asso- ciated corrals; puna- kichwa contact zone more than 100 households 51-100 households 2 1-50 households above 3,800 m asl; 2-3 mas- sive concentric stone walls; all EIP/MH 5.75-8 ha 1.754 ha .6-1.5 ha .1-.5 ha</page><page sequence="9">Table 3.

The three large Late Intermediate herding set- tlements in the Huaricolca puna (near the far southeastern edge of our survey area) may repre- sent another comparable cluster. The dearth of any small herding settlements in this latter region, and the very sparse Late Intermediate occupation of the entire Rio Seco drainage to the north of the Huaricolca puna (Figures 2 and 5), might be attributable to the uncertain sociopolitical condi- tions along this Tarama-Wanka frontier zone. The Late Intermediate agricultural settlements in the kichwa east of the Junin puna tend to form local clusters along several of the principal val- leys (Figure 5).

The apparent scarcity of EIP/MH settlement in other parts of the kichwa, plus the absence of an obvious site-size hierarchy, suggests an occu- pation much less hierarchical than that in the adjacent puna. The near-absence of EIP/MH set- tlement along the puna-kichwa juncture suggests limited contact between puna herders and kichwa agriculturalists.8 Late Intermediate Period. Within the Junin puna there are four major clusters of Late Intermediate herding settlements (Figure 5). Each cluster contains one or two large settlements (Class A or B) and several smaller settlements within an area roughly 8-10 km long and F5 km wide approximately 200-plus households within an area of 30-50 km2, surrounded by extensive grasslands. Each of these clusters might be considered a local territorial unit.</page><page sequence="11">Parsons et al.] HERDER-CULTIVATOR INTERACTION IN THE PERUVIAN LATE INTERMEDIATE 327 LIP and LIP/LH Settlements (Camps and que$tionable $ite$ not included) * Agricultural settlement - A, B * Agricultural settlement - C, D, E * Herding settlement - A, B * Herding settlement - C, D, E O Special Function Settlement - A, B o Special Function Settlement - C Figure 5. Late Intermediate settlement in the region. mediate puna herders and kichwa cultivators thus tended to be grouped in clusters of similar size and population. There is a buildup of large Late Intermediate special function settlements along the same puna- kichwa juncture that had been almost empty dur- ing the antecedent EIP/MH (Figures 3, 4, 5). As previously noted, despite their large size these sites are situated in some of the locally least-pro- ductive terrain in the entire region. This contrasts markedly with the relatively dense concentrations of Late Intermediate agricultural settlements close to the region's best agricultural lands in the kichwa valleys, and with the largest Late Intermediate herding settlements that are invari- ably closely surrounded by large expanses of good pasture land in the puna. This suggests that the Late Intermediate special function settlements were concerned with regional-level, as opposed to local-level, economy and polity. They had limited direct access to good agricultural land or good pasture, but maximal accessibility to the natural and demographic resources of the entire region. The placement of these sites may reflect their key integrative role in new kinds of relationships between puna herders and kichwa cultivators. The close similarity between Late Intermediate ceramic assemblages across the puna, kichwa, and ceja de montana zone3 also suggests close interzonal linkages (Hastings 1985, 1987). Settlement Pairing: Hints of Duality Approximately half of all Late Intermediate set- tlements occur in closely spaced pairs (Tables 6 and 7) (Figure 6).

Consequently, our focus on closely spaced sites ignores the possibility that lower-order pair- ings might be more obvious than higher-order pairings because the latter might have larger intersite spacing detectable only within a larger survey area. Despite the uncertainties, our data suggest that structural duality permeated and defined all levels of the Late Intermediate organizational hierarchy, including (1) individual nucleated settlements defined by subdivisions (moieties?) separated by "internal" walls (see below); (2) individual local communities defined by pairs of closely spaced settlements; and (3) multicommunity regional units defined by pairs of unusually large settle- ments (such as Sites 181-231, 347-355, and 378- 379 in Figure 6). About a third of our EIP/MH settlements occur in "pairs." However, it is difficult to assess the degree to which structural duality as an organiz- ing principle precedes the Late Intermediate period.

This suggests a dualistic struc- ture in which the equivalent "halves" of a local community were physically separated. Archaeological indications of duality (usually paired architectural features inside individual sites) have been noted elsewhere (e.g., Anders 1986; Brown 1991; Matos 1994; Moore 1995; Netherly and Dillehay 1986); however, we know of no other reports of paired settlements within a systematically surveyed region. Our definition of "closely spaced" is based on simple inspection of our maps. Some sites are less than 500 m apart (measured mid-point to mid- point), and the mean intersite distance within the settlement pairs approximates 1 km (Table 6). However, some paired sites are separated by nearly 2 km, and in two extreme cases the mid- points are 2.8 and 5.7 km apart. Furthermore, if Late Intermediate society had a dual structure, and paired settlements are manifestations of that duality, why are not all Late Intermediate settle- ments paired? One potential difficulty is that our chronologi- cal control cannot fully capture site contempo- raneity. This may produce an impenetrable overlay of noncontemporaneous sites with some erroneous pairings and/or nonpairings. Furthermore, because of the arbitrary borders of our survey area, seemingly unpaired settlements near its edges may actually be paired with still unknown sites outside the survey limits. We also suspect that our smallest (Class E) herding settle- ments, only about a quarter of which are paired, may have been occupied on a temporary or irreg- ular basis and therefore not have been sociologi- cally equivalent to larger settlements. Another consideration is that multiple levels of site pairings may manifest duality through struc- tural and spatial oppositions that exist contempo-</page><page sequence="13">329 Parsons et al.] HERDER-CULTIVATOR INTERACTION IN THE PERUVIAN LATE INTERMEDIATE Figure 6.

One of the long sides of each chamber has an entrance about S(} 60 cm2, and the buildings are typically ca. 2.5 by 4 m in area and ca. 3 m high. When found inside set- tlements, they usually occur as single isolated buildings, or in conjoined pairs, and typically comprise lSlS percent of the total architectural remains (Figure 7). The absence of human skele- tal material inside or around any of these distinc- tive structures indicates they are not tombs. By virtue of their size and form, they also seem to be unsuitable for residential functions. Five very unusual sites, classified as "regional storage facilities," consist almost exclusively of rectangular storage buildings. Each of these non- settlement sites contains up to 70 individual and conjoined storage structures; they occur in two widely spaced clusters, one in the puna (Sites 332, 338) and one in the kichwa (Sites 123, 144, 145) This patterning suggests two different levels of storage: (1) a suprahousehold, local-community level, manifested by the inside-settlement storage structures, and (2) a multicommunity level, man- ifested by the isolated regional storage facilities. Distribution of Late Intermediate Tombs Modern looting has produced a litter of human bone around many ancient graves, and we can identify Late Intermediate tombs with some con- fidence. We distinguish three basic types of Late Intermediate tombs: (1) lWpe I, formed by walling up the fronts and sides of quebrada rockshelters to create irregular chambers ca. 1-1.5 m on a side and 1-1.2 m high; (2) lWpe II, subsurface stone- lined cylindrical shafts ca. 1 m deep and 6&gt;80</page><page sequence="14">No. of Sites Category No. of Sites in Pairs % Agricultural settlement ClassA 1 0 Class B 1 1 100.0 Class C 17 9 52.9 Class D 31 12 38.7 Class E 13 8 61.5 Subtotal 63 30 47.6 Herding settlement Class A 6 5 83.3 Class B 6 4 66.7 Class C 22 15 68.2 Class D 24 11 45.8 Class E 27 7 25.9 Subtotal 85 42 49.4 Special function settlement Class A 5 2 40.0 Class B 5 5 100.0 Class C 5 2 40.0 Subtotal 15 9 60.0 Total 163 81 49.7 330 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY lVol. 8, No. 4, 1997 kichwa at an average elevation of ca. 3,400 m asl along the bottom of the Quebrada Cucun (Figures 8 and 9). Over a horizontal distance of ca. 2.7 km, we identified some 8-10 discrete tomb clusters, with a total of many dozen individual tomb cham- bers. On the other hand, most of the Type II (sub- surface) tombs occur in isolated cemeteries well up in the puna along the Quebrada Tingo (Figures 8 and 9) at an average elevation of ca. 4,300 m asl. In this area, there are nearly 100 individual tombs arranged in 10 discrete clusters distributed across a horizontal distance of ca. 5 km. There also are some isolated cemeteries of subsurface tombs outside the Quebrada Tingo (Figure 9). These occur exclusively in the main Junin puna, with a characteristic pattern of 1-5 small cemeteries within a radius of .5-2. km of several individual Late Intermediate herding set- tlements. These cemeteries may define the bound- aries of some form of "close-in" space relevant only to local concerns. The presence of three distinctive, spatially seg- regated Late Intermediate tomb forms suggests a significant linkage between tomb form, burial rit- ual, and local ethnic/ayllu/polity identification. This inference dovetails with Zuidema's (1977:154) observation that the eastern and west- ern sectors of the Inka heartland around Cuzco were distinguished on the basis of different tomb forms (aboveground burial towers vs. subter- ranean shaft tombs, respectively) that played a role in ceremonial processions. The coexistence of two tomb types at only three different Late Intermediate isolated cemeteries (Sites 54, 228, and 357) (Figures 8 and 9), one situated in each of the three major subareas within our survey region, also suggests that locally distinctive burial rituals were performed in a few key localities outside the areas where such ritual forms predominated. The clustering of each of our three different Late Intermediate tomb types in widely separated groupings of isolated cemeteries might indicate that each of these cemetery groupings defined an important ritual zone that marked a sociopolitical border where different categories of people, including puna herders and kichwa cultivators, interacted in public ceremonies. The close prox- imity of regional storage facilities to our Type I and Type II isolated cemetery clusters is another Table 7. Numbers and Proportions of Late Intermediate Settlements in Pairs. cm in diameter; and (3) Type III, one-story, aboveground structures, usually square to rectan- gular in exterior form, measuring 1-2.5 m on a side and 1-1.3 m high. The subsurface and rock- shelter tombs occur exclusively in isolated ceme- teries, well removed from any individual settlements. Most aboveground tombs occur inside settlements, except at a major cluster of isolated cemeteries at the far southeastern corner of the survey area, and a minor cluster of the same features in the northeastern sector (Figures 8, 9). Most Late Intermediate settlements contain some identifiable Type III (aboveground) tombs. Most of these occur as freestanding individual structures or in small clusters of 24 tombs; some individual tombs are appended to the exterior sides of residential structures; some tombs occur in lines of up to 15 conjoined or closely spaced structures; other tombs are built along the inner and/or outer sides of outer "defensive" walls (see below). These inside-settlement tombs probably reflect both household-level and suprahousehold- level burial ritual within the local community.

Distribution of Late Intermediate isolated cemeteries, regional storage facilities, and special function settle- ments in the region. Site Walls as Social Borders There is a strong tradition of associating walled highland hilltop settlements of the Late Intermediate period with defensive functions in a context of intensive warfare (e.g., D'Altroy 1992; Earle et al. 1987; Hastorf et al. 1989; Parsons and Hastings 1988; Stanish 1992; Thompson 1971). Virtually all our Late Intermediate settlements are hilltop sites, and about 80 percent of them are walled. In addition, most outer walls are directly associated with ditches, and often there are dou- ble walllitch complexes (Figure 7).9 We do not doubt that warfare occurred during the Late Intermediate in our survey area. Neither do we doubt that outer walls and ditches could have slowed the entry of intruders into settle- ments under attack. However, several features seem inconsistent with a strictly utilitarian- defense model of wall function: (1) site walls do not effectively protect a settlement's inhabitants; (2) a few Late Intermediate sites have outer walls but apparently lack residential occupation; (3) some sites have both external and internal walls; (4) at least one site has its external wall on the steep-slope side; and (S) external walls and tombs are consistently associated. Whatever defensive iFunctions these settlement walls may have had, we believe they also played some significant role in public ritual. Our data may support Urbano's (1988:213-214) suggestion that the ethnohistori- cally documented "war" between the Inka and their Chanka neighbors in the early fifteenth cen-</page><page sequence="17">Parsons et al.l HERDER-CULTIVATOR INTERACTION IN THE PERUVIAN LATE INTERMEDIATE 333 Figure 9. Distribution of Late Intermediate isolated cemeteries in the region. ingly, there were no inhabitants to defend? Internal Walls. There are seven settlements with massive "internal" walls that divide the site into two major sectors. '° This pattern suggests that a major function of large walls whether "exter- nal" or "internal" was to demarcate moiety-like units within a single local community (e.g., LeBlanc 1981:391). A Steep-Slope Wall. We found one nonresiden- tial site (144, a Late Intermediate regional storage facility) with its external wall at the top of a steep slope and its topographically accessible entry left "undefended." Furthermore, this wall "faces" the outer wall of its paired "mate" (Site 145), situated a few hundred meters away (Figure 8). This archi- tectonic configuration suggests that outer walls of tury was a form of ritualized interaction. Walls without Protection. None of our Late Intermediate hilltop sites is surrounded by walls. Rather, only the topographically '4easy" approaches to certain sites (typically along the top of a connecting ridge or saddle) are blocked by walls or wall-ditch complexes. Often at these sites, the rest of the occupation's moderate-to- steep-sided perimeter remains open (Figure 7). Walls without Inhabitants to Protect. Four kichwa walled sites appear to lack residential occupation: two are isolated complexes of agri- cultural terracing, and two are regional storage facilities (Sites 144 and 145). If outer walls served to defend a settlement's inhabitants, how are we to understand these sites where, seem-</page><page sequence="18">334 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 8, No. 4, 1997 paired "moiety" sectors were placed so as to directly face each other, whether across a gentle or steep approach, and, together with that of the walled agricultural terraces noted above, hints at an association between bordering walls and pub- lic ritual that might have been common to both settlements and some types of nonsettlements. Walls and Tombs. Twenty-one Late Intermediate settlements include extemal walls that are closely associated with tombs. In some cases the tombs are built directly into the inner or outer sides of the walls; in others the walls and tombs are physically detached, but aligned and separated by no more than a few meters. The outer edges of another five unwalled settlements are likewise defined by alignments of tombs placed across the topographically accessible entry. We feel (see Note 10) that a more detailed reexamination would reveal a much higher pro- portion of Late Intermediate settlements with these wall-tomb or edge-tomb associations. This association suggests the importance of public rit- ual associated with group ancestors. This combi- nation of walls and/or tombs in "border" settings would have provided powerful symbols of the social distinction of individual settlements (moi- eties). The burial niches in the outer wall at the Late Intermediate Kuelap site in the north high- lands of Peru might imply a similar function (Bandelier 1907:27-28). Summary and Conclusions: The Definition of Late Intermediate Community and Regional Structure No single line of evidence adduced in this section is persuasive in isolation. However, considered together these complementary data on population, economy, settlement configuration, and the distri- bution of outer walls, cemeteries, and storage buildings suggest that the Late Intermediate period was a time of significant change in the structure and integration of society at local and regional levels. ( 1 ) For this period we can differentiate between specialized herders living in the puna and specialized cultivators living in the kichwa. For the antecedent EIP/MH we also seem to have specialized puna herders, although agricultural- ists in the kichwa also may have maintained small flocks of camelids along the puna fringes. (2) The presence of a distinct EIP/MH site-size hierarchy in the Junin puna, and the apparent absence of such a hierarchy in the kichwa, sug- gests that puna herders were organizationally more complex than their kichwa neighbors. (3) The scarcity of EIP/MH settlement at the puna-kichwa juncture and the apparent contrasts between kichwa and puna pottery during that era are together suggestive of the absence of any close linkage between puna herders and kichwa cultivators before the Late Intermediate. This may have been related to the above-noted difference in sociopolitical complexity. (4) The Late Intermediate period saw substan- tial population growth and an intensification of specialized agricultural and herding production in both kichwa and puna zones. A notable buildup of special function settlements along the puna- kichwa juncture, and the ceramic similarities across puna, kichwa, and ceja de montana zones, imply a closer integration of puna herders and kichwa cultivators than during the antecedent EIP/MH. The special function settlements at the puna-kichwa juncture may have been Late Intermediate regional foci. Some of the impres- sive population growth might be attributable to the expanded overall productivity attained by the closer integration of pastoral and agricultural economies. (S) There are suggestions of structural duality at settlement, community, and multicommunity levels during the Late Intermediate. The most obvious evidence consists of (a) massive "inter- nal" walls that divide individual nucleated settle- ments into two equivalent sectors and (b) pairs of closely spaced settlements suggestive of a moi- ety-like community structure. The presence of a few "pairs" of large, more distantly spaced settle- ments hints at the existence of a higher-order dual organization comprised of multiple herding or cultivator communities. (6) The complexes of associated walls, ditches, and tombs at the edges of individual Late Intermediate settlements may have functioned to formally demarcate moiety boundaries by provid- ing stages for the performance of integrative pub- lic ritual within bifocal local communities. This may have included some form of ritual fighting,</page><page sequence="19"> Supraregional Level(?)

The suprahousehold storage facilities inside many settlements may have func- tioned to stockpile materials to support such ritual activities. (7) It is more difficult to define a Late Intermediate interregional organizational level that subsumes the settlement, local community, and multicommunity levels considered above (Figures 10 and 11). Nevertheless, it is only at this level that the integration of specialized puna herders and kichwa cultivators can be adequately comprehended. The linear cluster of special function settle- ments along the puna-kichwa juncture is one hint of Late Intermediate interregional organization (Figure 8). In much the same way that external settlement walls may define formal moiety bor- ders between paired settlements at the community and multicommunity levels, so too might the "line" of special function settlements along the physical border between puna and kichwa define a formal relationship between the inhabitants of these two zones. Wall-ditch-tomb complexes at the borders of individual settlements may have provided the stages for ritual fighting, feasting, and dancing performances that integrated settle- ment moieties within local communities and mul- ticommunity entities. In much the same way, ritual performances associated with the special function settlements may have integrated regional groupings of puna herders, on the one hand, and kichwa cultivators, on the other. (8) The distribution of our regional storage facilities and isolated cemeteries further illumi- nates the structure of Late Intermediate interre- gional organization. These sites are most comprehensible in terms of multicommunity and/or interregional relationships. In effect, these facilities may provide the public architecture associated with interregional integration that seems to be "missing" inside the special function settlements. The spatial separation of the two main tomb styles suggests that puna herders and kichwa cul- tivators defined themselves, in part, on the basis of distinctive burial ritual. If so, this raises impor- tant (and still unanswerable) questions about the</page><page sequence="20">-  -  Figure 11.

Were higher-status individuals buried inside their settlements or along the strategic and sanctified regional borders? Were only puna herders buried in subterranean tombs in the "upper" isolated cemeteries in the Junin puna, while only kichwa cultivators were interred in rockshelter tombs in the "lower" isolated cemeteries in the kichwa? Does the existence of three widely spaced iso- lated cemeteries with mixed tomb types (Figure 9) indicate that these places played a special role in interregional integration based on ritual associ- ated with the burial of some individuals outside their zones of origin? (9) The proximity of Late Intermediate iso- lated cemeteries and regional storage facilities might indicate that the storage capacity repre- sented by the latter was intended to facilitate the performance of ritual feasting, sacriElce, fighting, dancing, and ceremonial exchange along "sacred" processional routes through quebradas flanked by linear tomb clusters. Such ritualized activities may have been critical in forging regional and interregional solidarity. Comparable functions may have been served by the two unusually large isolated cemeteries (Sites 228, 261) that lie along the northwestern and southeastern edges of our core-region Late Intermediate "polity" (Figures 8, 9,10,andll). One obvious problem with any attempt to associate our two linear groupings of Late Intermediate isolated cemeteries and regional storage facilities with major integrative and bor- der-marking rituals is the apparent absence along the two proposed borders of any obvious archi- tectural manifestation of large-scale ritual. On the other hand, ethnographic studies (e.g., Dillehay 1990; Poole 1982; Sallnow 1987) have shown that ritual activities at the multicommunity and inter- regional levels may be undertaken in the open, well away from settlements and without any mon- umental architectural accoutrements. The two tomb-lined quebradas in our survey area seem admirably suited for guiding, channeling, and ori- enting such open-air activities.</page><page sequence="21">Parsons et al.l HERDER-CULTIVATOR INTERACTION IN THE PERUVIAN LATE INTERMEDIATE  (10) Our data suggest the existence of a Late Intermediate regional "polity" within the core of our survey area. The borders of this polity are defined by unique linear clusters of isolated cemeteries and regional storage facilities. The polity comprises an area some 4(}50 km long by 30X0 km wide, containing roughly 1,000 kichwa agricultural households, 2,000 puna herder house- holds, and 1,000 households in special function settlements along the puna-kichwa juncture (Figures 5, 8, 10, and 11). The contemporaneity and compositional overlap of these households remain to be ascertained. The relatively high number of herder households, for example, may reflect that one such unit occupied multiple household sites during an annual cycle as flocks were periodically moved to different pastures. It is conceivable that some (most?) houses in the special function settlements were occupied only during special, festive occasions (as Topic and Topic [1991] suggest for Marcahuamachuco in the highlands of northern Peru). Nevertheless, these figures suggest a very rough order of mag- nitude for what might be terrned a basic Late Intermediate regional sociopolitical "building block." Concluding Speculations We are faced with two basic, and still unanswer- able, questions: (1) what caused the changes we observe between EIP/MH and Late Intermediate settlement patterning? and (2) why did these changes take the specific forrns that they did? Since we cannot yet deal with these questions in any concrete way, we conclude with the presenta- tion of a general developmental scenario that goes well beyond the limits of the data available to us. We recognize weaknesses in this scenario, but its key aspects may be testable through future archaeological fieldwork. Following the collapse of large states at the end of the Middle Horizon, organizational decen- tralization throughout the central Andean high- lands set the stage for new forms of loca] and regional integration. Some of the key players on this stage would have been groups of puna herders and kichwa cultivators previously linked, directly or indirectly, to Wari or Tiwanaku or other major Middle Horizon centers. The collapse 337 of these major centers would have been accompa- nied by the dissolution of center-dependent alliances or exchange networks that had previ- ously facilitated access to critical nonlocal mate- rials and information. Consequently, during the Late Intermediate these groups of herders and cultivators would have found it necessary to devise new mechanisms for accessing each other's products. In the absence of centra]ized state administration, or of alliance networks ulti- mately dependent on such administration, new types of public ritual would have played crucial roles in integrating puna and kichwa groups. We do not contend that the changes we delin- eate in the Tarama-Chinchaycocha region were necessarily replicated elsewhere. We realize, for example, that the Late Intermediate witnessed the development in some other highland regions of nucleated centers much larger than ours: e.g., the Titicaca Basin (Hyslop 1976; Lumbreras 1974; Stanish 1992; Stanish and Steadman 1994); the main Mantaro Valley (the Wanka region) (D'Altroy 1992; Earle et al. 1987; Hastorf et al. 1989); and the Cuzco region (Bauer 1992; Dwyer 1971; Kendall 1976). The most precocious Late Intermediate devel- opments in the central Andean highlands occurred in those regions that combine unusually large expanses of both herding and agricultural terrain. The Tarama-Chinchaychocha region contains an unusually large expanse of camelid pasture, but is much less well endowed with agricultural land. Herding potential declines notably north of the uppermost Maranon and Huallaga drainages along the northern edge of the Peruvian central highlands (Figure 1) (Troll 1958, 1968). Only within particularly favored highland portions of the southern half of the central Andes could developments have gone beyond our basic Late Intermediate "building block" in terms of organi- zational complexity. Only in such central Andean areas would it have been possible to attain maxi- mal, combined levels of productivity of both puna herders and kichwa cultivators within the core of a large polity. Zuidema (1990:7-9) has noted that in one ver- sion of the Inka origin myth, the dynasty's found- ing ancestor (Manco Capac) united two "kingdoms," "Hanan Cuzco" and "Hurin Cuzco."</page><page sequence="22">338 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY lVol. 8, No. 4, 1997 Might we one day learn that these "kingdoms" derived from an original (Late Intermediate period) division between puna herders and kichwa cultivators?

Parsons et al.] HERDER-CULTIVATOR INTERACTION IN THE PERUVIAN LATE INTERMEDIATE 341 regard, but comparable anthropomorphized landscapes in other parts of the central Andes also have been described (e.g., Allen 1982; Gow and Gow 1975; and Vokral 1991). Classen (1993) and Zuidema (1983) suggest that a living landscape metaphor is deeply rooted in Andean cosmology and polity. 5. We recognize that ritual fighting finds very little mention in sixteenth-century ethnohistoric sources. These sources pertain largely to the Late Horizon, a time when Inkaic impe- rial policies may have greatly reduced the importance of this activity at the local level. 6. Our project, in turn, had its foundation in several decades of earlier work in the region, including that of Ramiro Matos, who laid the groundwork in ceramic chronology, the definition of developmental and ecological issues, and the location and testing of several key sites (Matos 1971, 1973, 1975, 1978, 1980; Matos and Rick 1980). Charles Hastings (1985, 1987) subsequently carried out regional studies in the adjacent ceja de montana zone. Unsettled conditions during the 1980s and early 1990s have discouraged follow-up field- work in the area. 7. Because local archaeological phases and phase names have not yet been fully defined for the survey area, we use the general pan-central Andean chronological terminology. 8. Although our ceramic surface collections from puna sites are small and badly weathered, our impression is that there are marked differences between EIP/MH ceramic assem- blages in the puna and kichwa zones. 9. These walls vary considerably in size. A few are truly mas- sive, standing up to ca. 7 m high and measuring ca. 2 m thick, occasionally with several attached towerlike features. Others are only ca. 2 m high and less than 1 m thick. Approximate modal dimensions would be ca. 2-3 m high and 1-1.5 m thick. Most appear to have been constructed with mud masonry. Future field studies should give greater attention than we did to variability in wall form. 10. Many more sites may have such internal walls. Our observations of architecture inside most sites were typically rather cursory, and we would have tended to overlook such walls unless they were unusually prominent. This observa- tion also applies to inside-settlement tombs. Webster, D. 1973 Native Pastoralism in the South Andes. Ethnology 2:115-133. Winterhalder, B., and R. B.

The Tarama-Chinchaycocha region takes its name from the terms employed in ethnohistoric documentation for the two Inka administrative provinces centered, respectively, around the modern town of Tarma and Lake Junin (Arellano 1994; Hastings 1985; Rostworowski 1975; Rowe 1946). 2. Llamas (Lama glama) and alpacas (Lama pacos) are the two main domesticated Andean camelids. Over the past 450 years introduced sheep, goats, and cattle have modified Prehispanic herding patterns. Nonetheless, llamas and alpacas remain important, even predominant, in many areas. 3. These may not be true specialists in the classic economic sense, but rather groups who devote most of their subsis- tence/productive energies to herding or farming. 4.
