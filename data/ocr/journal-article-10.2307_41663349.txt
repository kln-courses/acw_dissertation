LOTHROP The Peabody Museum of Harvard University 34</page><page sequence="2">Where the western the Panama shore runs Canal south for emerges a short on distance the Pacific, and the western shore runs south for a short distance and then swings gradually until it extends westward for a couple of miles to the frontier of the Republic of Pan- ama. This slightly undulating shore line is known as Venado Beach. Behind it is a flat valley, today used as a target area by troops stationed at Fort Kobbe. By water it is only about ten miles from the old city of Panama de- stroyed by Morgan the buccaneer. A few years ago an aboriginal settlement fronting on Venado Beach was brought to light by a bulldozer. An- cient remains consisted of refuse beds - mostly removed to enrich the lawns of the Fifteenth Naval District - and burials by the hundreds. A great deal of unrecorded dig- ging by soldiers from Fort Kobbe followed. Then a local archaeological society was formed which kept a photo- graphic record of the more spectacular finds and, in one case, a set of field notes. In the winter of 1951, the Pea- body Museum of Harvard University conducted syste- matic excavations for several months. The Harvard collection is now being prepared for pub- lication, which probably will not be ready for some time. The objects here described were found in adjacent graves during August, 1951, after our digging had ended. The excavators were Mr. and Mrs. Neville A. Harte and Lt. Colonel Lee E. Montgomery. We are able to describe this unusual jewelry through their kindness in sending data and photographs. One of the graves contained the body of a child about three years old, loosely flexed on his left side, at a depth of eight feet. Originally the depth had been several feet more, but most of the rich black top soil had been re- moved by the bulldozer. Below the present surface a foot more of this black soil was found mixed with shells ; the next two feet were of red sand containing refuse sherds. Then came three feet of red clay on top of which rested four capped urns, each about twenty inches in diameter, containing traces of food, also five bowls approximately eleven inches in diameter. Below the red clay was a one- foot band of yellow clay. The body lay in a shallow trough cut in hard white coquina . Near the feet of the child an urn nineteen inches in di- ameter was uncovered which contained more food: shell- fish, animal bones and a gray powder. Behind the hips 35</page><page sequence="3">were the two superimposed gorgets seen in Figure 1, below. The smaller one on top is made from the leg or wing bones of gulls. The other is of orange and white shell beads. We also illustrate (Figure 1, above) another gorget, from a different grave, with purple fringe, a purple band on the top and an orange band at the base. The beads had been strung on strands of human hair. The Hartes carefully restrung them in situ, a feat of which they should be proud. Comparable bead gorgets, worn high on the chest, are still used by the San Bias Indians on the Atlantic coast of the Isthmus. The Guaymi In- dians of western Panama also still wear bead gorgets but of a different shape. On the child's chest there were three gold plaques (Figure 2), each pierced by two pairs of holes. This suggests that they were sewn on the clothing rather than suspended from the neck. The one on the right is undecorated except for a raised rim. Another (extreme left) has an embossed circle surrounded by a zigzag motif which probably symbolizes crocodile scales. The third plaque (Figure 2, center) is adorned in a style well known in the Province of Codé, Panama. Dec- oration typically consists of grotesque human and animal forms or an infinite variety of scroll patterns which seem to be symbolic rather than abstract in concept. This Venado Beach specimen probably is a trade piece, for it recalls the embossed gold breastplates found at the Sitio Conte about one hundred miles to the west. The subject portrayed is a composite anthropomorphic monster. The head, shaped like a barbed arrow point, is of a form as- sociated with serpents and sometimes turtles on Codé polychrome pottery, but in Codé the mouth normally would be placed above the eyes, and the two curling streamers should be twin tongues (Figure 3). There is no body below the neck and shoulders, but the arms and legs are human except that the fingers and big toes are Replaced by crocodile claws. Flanking the knees of the child in the grave was a pair of small animals with curling tails, fat bellies and long snouts. Somewhat similar gold figures from Sitio Conte were thought to represent crocodiles. On the basis of the more detailed specimen in Figure 4, however, it is now possible to identify "them as sea horses, an art motif we had not previously encountered in the New World. The sea horses are linked by a band fringed with sym- bolic crocodile scales. This presumably is a belt. On Codé anthropomorphic figures, when the body is de- picted, similar belts are shown with flaring ends which are attached to small animal figures, usually crocodiles. In this case, as there is no body represented, the belt motif appears as an independent unit so introduced that it balances the design as a whole. In the art of Codé, especially in pottery and hammered gold, there is a wealth of forgotten symbolism which we can only call monstrous because it is based on combina- tions of brute forms which never appear in nature. Among these are snakes with two legs, birds with saurian claws, men with crocodile heads, etc. Similar compound concepts in many guises are found all over the world but in Codé art, apart from complex geometric designs, there is rarely any other expression of beauty or religious belief. On the child's forehead, in the grave we are discussing, was found the extraordinary object shown in Figure 5. It has a loop for suspension but, from the position in which it was discovered, it seems that it was sewn to a head band. Again we are dealing with a composite figure with both human and animal attributes. At the top there is a human head attached to human shoulders and arms. Each hand holds a short bar with two gold danglers. The body, which rather suggests a well fed snake, terminates in a bird's head with two small wings and projecting eyes like a crab's. This piece at first glance seems to have been built up by soldering wires together. Actually, it was modeled in wax over a clay core and- except for the danglers - cast in a single flow of metal. At the back there is a rectangular slot through which the core was extracted. Microscopic examination of sections of com- parable pieces reveals the continuous grain structure. In an adjacent grave Lt. Col. Lee E. Montgomery found two comparable specimens, both representing frogs. The example in Figure 6 is no less intricate in de- sign than the piece just considered, but the casting was less successful. Perhaps the wax model had partly melted, 36 FIGURES 1, 2 AND 5 BY NEVILLE A. HARTE; FIGURE 4 BY HARRY DUNN; FIGURES 6 AND 7 BY LT. COL. LEE E MONTGOMERY</page><page sequence="4">3.

In the side view in Figure 6, however, it can be seen that each of the two loops for suspension has a small projection. These must represent the channels through which the metal was poured. Their presence is unusual in the Isthmus and suggests that this may be an unfinished specimen. Mexican copper bells also were cast by ducts leading through the rings to the body of the bell, but traces of the casting channels frequently were not removed. The second frog (Figure 7) exhibits modeling and casting of the highest quality. Over sixty spirals are in- corporated in the design. A view of the base shows the slot through which the inner core of the mold could be extracted. These three filigree-like specimens may well be the product of one unusually skilled goldsmith, but it seems improbable that they were manufactured locally, or more of them would have been found. Certain characteristics, such as the rings for suspension, protruding eyes, spirals in front of the mouth, suggest that they are trade pieces from the Province of Veraguas. To conceive and model such ornaments calls for inven- tive genius and craftsmanship, but so to design them that the metal would flow throughout the tiny channels of the mold represents great technical ability. Dr. Emil Haury recently told me that copies of the very delicate Mixtee jewelry of Mexico are now being produced by a process available to aboriginal peoples. This consists of making a wax model and a mold with a chamber for the metal above the wax. This is embedded in charcoal which is ignited. The whole contrivance is then swung around the craftsman's head on the end of a rope. As a result, the heat of the flame is increased and the molten metal is driven into the mold by centrifugal force while the wax is vaporized. Had the inhabitants of the Isthmus possessed any such spectacular device, we would expect the Spaniards to have noted and described it. As a matter of fact, however, we have no descriptions of metal working in this region, but it is obvious that such fine castings as we illustrate could have been made only with thoroughly liquefied metal. Yet little more than a hundred miles west of the Province of Veraguas, the natives of Boruca were unable to pro- duce enough heat to smelt either gold or copper sepa- rately, but they had learned to powder and combine them in the alloy known as tumbaga , which has a far lower melting point than either of its ingredients. Within a small area, then, there is evidence of much diversity in skills among peoples who shared the same technical processes. 38</page><page sequence="6">6. Gold pendant representing a frog.
