<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK reMARKS A Personal View of Current Juvenile Literature Ruth M. Stein Real or fanciful, Informational or fic- tional, In prose and poetry, animals have always endeared themselves to children. Recent studies in animal behavior are bound to bring forth a new variety to ac- company the toys, anthropomorphic crea- tures, and real beasts that already exist in the literature. Below are a few of the cur- rent books. The ones not to be missed have a plus (+), while a minus (-) marks those you should avoid. Happy reading! 576</page><page sequence="2">Informational Books Animal Games by Russell Freedman, ill. by St. Tamara. Holiday House, 1976. 30 pp. Reinforced binding, $4.95. The author explores the games of six- teen young animals and suggests how they prepare themselves for survival, just as in the case of human behavior. Games include the gorillas' "follow-the-leader," fawns' playing tag, penguins' toboggan- ing, and dolphins' "surfboarding" the waves. Written in the present tense and using active verbs, the author enables young readers to see the resemblance be- tween humans and animals learning from their fun. Large pen-and-ink drawings on each page capture the playful Iness of in- fant animals in their natural habitat. The Beaver: How He Works. Written and ill. by Glen Rounds. Holiday House, 1976. 46 pp. Reinforced binding, $4.95. Based on first-hand observations, Rounds describes the life of a beaver and the methods used for damming streams and building a lodge. Following the sea- sonal work, the author begins with the fell- ing of the first tree and concludes in the bitter weather, with the beaver safe and secure in his lodge, waiting for spring and a busy summer. The leisurely style of writ- ing parallels the beaver's tempo, with his "easy come, easy go" attitude. Primary grades will enjoy the information, which the author dispenses with a light touch. Rounds' familiar line drawings balance nicely with his text. +A Chick Hatches by Joanna Cole, photographs by Jerome Wexler. Wm. Mor- row, 1976. 48 pp. Reinforced binding, $6.95. Cole and Wexler do for chicks what they did for calves and puppies in earlier works. The integrated text and pictures cover a three-week span, telling what happens during the incubation of a chick- en egg. Each stage in the development is caught in clear close-ups, beginning with the egg and concluding with the chick's hatching. Primary grade children can eas- ily follow the process step by step, thanks to careful writing and fine photography. Understanding, and even excitement, are generated as the chick bursts through the shell. Older readers, too, will find the book informative and attractive in its pre- sentation of the subject. Cheetahs, The Swift Hunters by Gladys Conklin, pictures by Charles Robinson. Holiday House, 1976. 32 pp. Reinforced binding, $6.95. The author/naturalist writes sympatheti- cally about a species of mammal rapidly being destroyed and in danger of becom- ing extinct. She presents an authentic ac- count of the life style of a mother cheetah and cubs during their first eighteen months on the East African plains, begin- ning with the mating of a female cheetah, through the birth of her cubs, and their growth to maturity. At that point, the former cubs wander off, while the mother is ready to mate again, a graceful animal whose ". . . golden fur and amber eyes reflected the glow of the sun." The "Author's Note" gives general information about the cheetah, as well as her source material. Pen-and-ink drawings on blue and gold wash by an award-winning illustrator con- vey the feline beauty of these animals. Both art and writing are unusually sensi- tive for a book of this kind. +Sharks by Ann McGovern, pictures by Murray Tinkleman. Four Winds Press, 1976. 47 pp. Reinforced binding, $5.95. Written in a lively question-and-answer format, the book offers primary grade children basic facts which may make sharks less mysterious, but more interest- ing. Twenty-one questions in one type, and clearly worded answers in another, make for material both pleasing to the eye Book reMarks 577</page><page sequence="3">and easier to read. Enough information is given to satisfy readers without over- whelming or boring them. The informal style seems just right. Detailed black/ white line drawings give the impression of the underwater world which these animals inhabit. The Table of Contents lists the questions asked. The Index is especially appropriate for the primary grades. Sharks - photo courtesy of Four Winds Press Picture Story Books Both the artist and author of animal tales must be wary of the sentimental, the saccharine, and the sensational, as they portray their subjects in their many guises - inanimate objects, humans in "fur," true-to-life. Alligator's Toothache by Diane de Groat. Crown, 1977. 32 pp. Reinforced binding, $4.95. An amusing wordless picture book for the youngest child shows an alligator succumbing to a toothache in the midst of party preparations. Friends - a flamingo, wolf, and chimp - connive to get the al- ligator and the dentist together. Detailed line drawings with pencil overlay printed in three colors will entertain preschoolers, as they follow the animals' antics, espe- cially the not-too-helpful pig. The book is expressively executed without any didac- ticism. -i-The Amazing Bone by William Steig. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1976. Unpaged. $7.95. Leave it to Steig to invest a bone with amazing animation in a story that stresses style as well as content. Line-and-wash bright pink and green drawings picture Pearl the Pig's finding a bone on the ground in the forest on a spring day ". . . so bright and beautiful, . . . she could almost feel herself changing into a flow- er." Before the day is done, the bone saves Pearl from many hazards, using the most elegant language, as is Steig's wont. By nightfall both bone and Pearl are safe at home, after the author has had his say about the nature of things, including friendship. Animal-Man by Alain Herv√©, ill. by Jac- ques Rozier and Monique Gaudriault. Har- lan Quist, 1976. 22 pp. $3.95 (paper- back). Half of this very sophisticated tract on our inability to control our environment is taken up by full-page double spread il- lustrations in shades of blue, green, or purple, with detailed examples of the abuse of our earth. The rest of the book is devoted to blank verse poetry, two verses to a page, with a tiny human head, mouth agape, separating the verses. Narrated in the first person, the whale decries his condition under man's domination, com- paring what he was, "... a proud,/ gargantuan/symbol of life," to what he has become, ". . . another tube of lipstick/ painting someone's mouth, /a candle glow- ing on a dinner table, food for household pets." One picture exemplifies the Moby Dick saga, facing the text, ". . . And when the struggle ends/and, I am taken, /he sings of his triumph/in his books." The 578 Language Arts</page><page sequence="4">italic printing, size of type, the topic itself, and the complex pastel illustrations make this a book for a mature reader. The Har- lan Quist Books always provoke a strong reaction. This one is no exception. Bearymore. Story and pictures by Don Freeman. Viking, 1976. 40 pp. Reinforced binding, $6.95. Pre-schoolers and first graders will enjoy the simple story of a circus bear who has trouble hibernating and dream- ing up a new act at the same time. They will probably figure out the solution at the same time as he, realizing that many answers are right under our noses, if we only look. Although the book jacket and cover are in full color, the full-sized framed illustrations on every page are soft black/white drawings on a yellow wash, a bit too pale for a story with a circus set- ting. Most youngsters will miss the pun on Beary's name. I expect that this perform- ing bear will appear in more stories and probably will earn a place alongside his literary cousins, Paddington and Edward. Bearymore - photo courtesy of Viking Press +Bugs: Poems by Mary Ann Hoberman, ill. by Victoria Chess. Viking, 1976. 42 pp. Reinforced binding, $5.95. Children in the "bug" stage and adults who have never been in it can read and laugh at these humorous and accurate poems about ants, cockroaches, spiders, termites, centipedes, and other kinds of insects. The thirty-one witty poems are accompanied by raucous black/white drawings, enough to make the most squeamish take another look at some of those things that crawl, wiggle, fly, and look so awful. The poems include haiku, counting-out rhymes, and plays on words. Some are in the form of questions, as "To a Tiger Swallowtail Butterfly." "Yellow fel- low, tell me why./Why are you called but- terfly?" A delightful book! Bugs - photo courtesy of Viking Press +Deep in the Forest by Brinton Turkle. Dutton, 1976. 32 pp. Reinforced binding, $5.95. Turkle's wordless picture book about a curious bear that explores an empty cabin in the forest will tickle pre-schoolers and first graders, especially those familiar with "The Three Bears." Charcoal on shades of gold enhance the picturesque setting of early America for a rustic story of Goldi- locks in reverse.

Windmill Books and Dutton, 1976. 48 pp. Reinforced binding, $6.95. An old Japanese couple visiting an is- land care for a vixen cub until it is time for them to depart. They intend to return the following year. War intervenes, and when the old people finally do return, they find the tragic results of the little fox's en- counter with other human beings. The poignant tale is one of love and fidelity, despite overtones of anti-war and anti- hunting sentiments. Stark lyrical prose, with its symbolic ending, is in the tradition of the Andersen tales. Were it not for its picture-book format, older children would be attracted to this moving story. Colored jacket and book cover notwithstanding, the full-size illustrations on every page are black/white, with a soft rust color for the fox family, for the tiny ribbon around the cub's throat, and for the one blooming flower. Dreamlike drawings, the passing of the seasons, and the presence of a Japanese shrine to the patron saint of children and life lend folkloric overtones to a modern tale. The Foxes of Chironupp Island - photo courtesy of Dutton Mooch the Messy by Marjorie Weinman Sharmat, pictures by Ben Shecter. Harper &amp; Row, 1976. 64 pp. $3.95. The author/illustrator team of the Mag- gie Marmelstein series has created a simpler situation comedy for beginning readers in this I Can Read book. Mooch, the rat who hates neat, reforms temporar- ily to please his father. What makes for easy reading, in this case authentic and warm dialogue, also makes for reader identification. Soft, three-color drawings enliven the story of the rat who lives ". . . in a hole under a hill in Boston, Mas- sachusetts." Fastidious adults may be re- volted, but children will find Mooch a sympathetic and enviable creature.

Harlin Quist, 1976. 24 pp. $3.95 (paperback). The imaginative and distinctive style of the Harlan Quist books is evident in this story of a toy sock doll, a stuffed dog, and a wind-up frog who try to help their little owner whose teacher insists he should "grow up." After the three friends visit the school and chat with Ms. Teacher, they decide she needs ". . . to grow down." The dog's cigar smoking may disconcert some, while the stereotyped teacher will offend others. The over-size book with its cartoon format and big bright pictures will appeal to youngsters, but the not-so-sub- liminal message is definitely for adults. Rotten Ralph by Jack Gantos, ill. by Nicole Rubel. Houghton Mifflin, 1976. 48 pp. $6.95. Ralph is Sarah's mischievous cat who delights in misbehavior, but Sarah loves him anyway. His misdeeds irritate Sarah's parents, who leave him behind at the cir- cus when he causes a furor with his an- tics. Ralph, who is really a very nasty character, finally sees the error of his ways. Or does he? All seems to end well, to the satisfaction of pre-schoolers and primary graders. The full-sized framed colored pictures are done in a grotesque cartoon style of art. The quilting, which Rubel works at, shows up in her pictures. The bright red Ralph is a devilish charac- ter every which way. A successful first book by both author and illustrator. The Runaway Flying Horse by Paul Jac- ques Bonzon, trans, by Susan Kotta, ill. by Wm P√®ne Du Bois. Parents' Magazine, 1976. 32 pp. Reinforced binding, $5.50. A little wooden merry-go-round horse who tires of "... . forever turning in circles to the same old tune" takes off in pursuit of the glamor and glory of a real horse's life, only to discover that the grass is not always greener elsewhere. The translation reads smoothly, without losing a certain French touch. Elegant and fanciful half- sized full-color illustrations are done in the Du Bois manner, making for a memo- rable picture book for all seasons. The Runaway Flying Horse - photo courtesy of Parents' Magazine Press Simon Underground by Joanne Ryder, pictures by John Schoenherr. Harper &amp; Row, 1976. 32 pp. $5.95. For the first half of the book we follow Simon the mole as he meanders through the dark earth preparing tunnels for the winter. "Simon dug deeper and deep- er .. . scrape, scrape, thwish . . . And he made a tiny, cozy burrow just for himself." As winter lingered, Simon remembered the things he liked about spring. Instinc- tively, he digs a new tunnel up to the wonderful world above. Digging the new passage takes up the second half of the story, until Simon pokes through to a new season of life. Pen-and-ink drawings on green and brown wash resemble what one might see when peering at water under a microscope. The reader goes in and out of the book as the mole goes in and out of the ground. The story, told in blank verse, appeals to the primary grade child.

The presence of human beings enlarges the scope of the story and adds a dimension that might otherwise be lacking. +The Cats by Joan Phipson. A Margaret K. McElderry Book, Atheneum, 1976. 168 pp. $5.95. In a dramatic turn of events, two kid- napped brothers in Australia save their abductors from destruction by a tribe of cats grown wild. With controlled descrip- tive paragraphs, the author thrusts the reader into the semi-isolated ranges of central Australia. She convincingly pro- jects the sinister presence of the huge felines. The story is told in the third per- son, from the viewpoint of the elder brother, Jim. Fine characterizations are featured. Just as the kidnappers depend on the kidnapped for succor, so does the aggressive Jim turn to the younger Willie for support in the wilderness. Phipson, known for her compelling adventures, makes this more than a story for survival. Here she makes a statement about the conflicts of responsibility and about the relative worth of life. This is one of her best, consistent throughout and deserving of a second and third reading. Family, A Novel by John Donovan. An Ur- sula Nordstrom Book, Harper &amp; Row, 1976. 116 pp. $5.95. Sasha, an ape raised in captivity, re- counts his experiences as he and three other apes escape from the university ex- periment center to the nearby mountains. Sasha, little Lollipop, the young Dylys, and the great wild ape Moses manage to survive until they encounter hunters. Sas- ha's story is of the lore Moses has to teach them. The book is a puzzling one. Al- though the animals behave as apes, they seem to think and feel as humans, espe- cially in their comment on human be- havior and human ignorance. The theme is the interdependence of all living things, but Donovan seems pessimistic about the human link in the chain. Hope may be symbolized by Dylys' carrying Moses' child, when she and Sasha head back willingly to captivity. Sasha comments, "I would remember forever Moses and Lol- lipop, and would hope that Man is not lost." Amen. Thanks to graceful writing, this book is difficult to put down once be- gun, but it is for mature readers. Family, A Novel - photo courtesy of Harper and Row Finsterhall of San Pasqual by John Sinor, ill. by Bud Root. Joyce Press, 1976. 80 pp. $5.95. A syndicated columnist writes about the changes that take place in the life of a rabbit and his neighbors when the San Diego Wild Animal Park opens in the San Pasqual Valley. In his first book for chil- dren, Sinor uses the escapades of Finsterhall, the rabbit, to tie together inci- 582 Language Ms</page><page sequence="8">dents which actually happened in real life, such as the rabbit's getting caught in the cheetah's run. Wendal the owl, Pedro the bobcat, and the other creatures are true to their natures, even though they exhibit human speech and human emo- tions. Sinor writes with a quiet humor about the delicate balance of nature, as Finsterhall and his friends learn to live with such unlikely strangers as giraffes and elephants. The author does sound a bit didactic as he writes on animal lore. Root's sepia-and-cream drawings would be more effective if they faced the inci- dent illustrated, and if the paraphrased text accompanying each picture were eliminated. +Fly By Night by Randall Jarrell, pictures by Maurice Sendak. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1976. 31 pp. $5.95. In reviewing Jarrell's last work for chil- dren, it is difficult to resist the temptation of quoting at great length from this poetic piece of prose. David, a little boy, lives at the edge of a forest, in ". . . a house with a window seat and a big willow - the house is covered with ivy, and the ivy is full of sparrows' nests ... At night David can fly. In the daytime he can't. In the daytime he doesn't remember that he can." And so the adventure of David's night journey un- folds, with a story-within-a-story, as the owl, the mice, and the cat all recite in Jar- rell's inimitable style. David's mystical experience is illustrated by Maurice Sen- dak, Jarrell's successful collaborator in two earlier books. The black/white draw- ings are as eerie and as fragile as the prose. Can David be Mickey grown up? One picture features Sendak's real-life mother holding the young artist-to-be in her arms. This is a book to be read silently and aloud. -i-The Lemming Condition by Alan Arkin, ill. by Joan Sandin. Harper &amp; Row, 1976. 58 pp. $4.95. Arkins' second book for young readers is a statement about individual behavior in the face of mass conditioning and semi-insanity. Bubber's family is prepar- ing with the other lemmings for the great march west, culminating in the leap into the sea. Bubber looks forward to it ex- citedly until an old iconoclastic lemming and a friendly crow fill him with doubts. " 'What is it?' said Crow . . . 'You go down to the cliffs and jump into the ocean and swim around for a while and then what? ... I mean that's a lot of water down there. Have you ever seen the ocean?' " Bubber is akin to Ferdinand in his refusal to go along with what is expected of him. Tension slowly builds as the trek begins and one lemming tries to stem the tide. A dozen small black/white drawings spill over from one page to the other, dramatiz- ing the lemming - and human? - condition. A serio/comic story for all. The Stolen Telesm by Caroline Baxter. J. B. Lippincott, 1976. 191 pp. $6.95. This prize-winning first novel was writ- ten when the author was a teenager. In it two children are drawn into battle with un- known evil forces after they find and shel- ter a winged horse wearing an ancient stone with illegible writing. David and Lucy spend the holidays with their aunt on the moors. When they rescue the horse and befriend an enslaved baboon kept by a wicked neighbor on a nearby estate, the children find themselves attacked by malignant crows, wolves and other fell creatures. The climax is reached during an unholy snow storm in the middle of August. The horse, the source of their trouble, becomes the means of escape. Although showing promise for a first novel, the writing is flawed. Characteriza- tions are not fully realized, too much writ- ing slows up the pace, and motivations for many of the actions seem murky. The au- thor executes a touching portrayal of Wil- Book reMarks 583</page><page sequence="9">lie, the captive baboon. Baxter does catch the atmosphere of the chill, dank moors, with its malevolent secrets. Middle grad- ers will keep reading to find out what happens next. As the author writes, ". . . the young are more open to magic than the old." We may yet see more of Telesm, the winged horse. +Two That Were Tough by Robert Burch, ill. by Richard Cuffari. Viking, 1976. 80 pp. $6.95. The two that are tough are an old man and a wild gray chicken, both surviving the years, with each valuing his freedom. Mr. Hilton, a lonely proud mill owner, has refused to leave the Georgian clay hills where he was born and reared to move in with his daughter. Time and age are catching up with him. He befriends and surreptitiously tends Wild Wings, a cau- tious, suspicious bird who has escaped the fate of the rest of his brood. "He and the chicken were alike in some ways . . . Both were alone, and both were happy to be free." Mr. Hilton makes the necessary decisions, but you must know both he and his half-tamed pet are not about to have their wings clipped permanently. The au- thor's realistic look at a man's coming to terms with life has an optimistic and hope- ful air which readers in the middle grades and above will appreciate. Both Burch and Cuffari portray rural Georgia and its residents with restrained tenderness. Cuf- fari, whose penciled art work delineates the anguish and aspiration of the human condition in many books, turns this time to the aging process. The book is a compan- ion piece to Good Old James, with which some interesting comparisons can be made. I - -A</page></plain_text>
