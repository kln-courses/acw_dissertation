The series marks a significant contribution to early modem scholarship, for it provides anyone interested in hermetic thought with reliable reprints of rare treatises. Linden and the others involved in the project should be ap- plauded for producing books that are easy for scholars to use, books with excellent indexes, a wealth of informative annotations that guide the reader through the vagaries of the text, refer- ences to a variety of other rare texts that help put works such as Flamel's in their proper context, and up-to-date recommendations for further scholarship. Scholars interested in science and visual culture, science and literature, or the his- tory of alchemy will all benefit from this volume that now makes Flamel's work widely available. DEBORAH HARKNESS Robert Boyle. A Free Enquiry into the Vulgarly Received Notion of Nature. Edited by Edward B. Davis and Michael Hunter. (Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy.) xxxvi + 171 pp., index. Cambridge/New York: Cam- bridge University Press, 1996. $54.95 (cloth); $18.95 (paper). The history of the assimilation of the Greek idea of nature by Christian thought, which proved to be checkered right from its patristic beginnings, is the story of a long misunderstanding, clarified primarily by certain key seventeenth-century thinkers: Descartes, Hobbes, and Malebranche. But it is Robert Boyle who understood this sit- uation in all its epistemological, ontological, and theological aspects and indeed devoted a specific treatise to it, A Free Enquiry into the Vulgarly Received Notion of Nature, which he wrote to a large extent in the mid 1660s, resumed around 1680, and published only in 1686. Thanks to Ed- ward B. Davis and Michael Hunter, who have already examined the "anatomy" of the compo- sition of this seminal treatise in a dense article published in 1996 in Early Science and Medi- cine, a new edition is now available. One of the most puzzling issues early modem philosophy of nature had to face was the Carte- sian redefinition of perceptive activity. Percep- tion was considered not as a vital action but as the self-aware act that accompanies every opera- tion of the mind. In this light the purposiveness of inanimate things cannot help but create some difficulties. How can nature be reduced to the merely mechanical and unknowing disposition of the parts of the universe when it is precisely because of its teleological activity that it seems to possess understanding? Panpsychistic ac- counts had already solved the problem by attrib- uting sense to nature as a whole, but this solution did not prevent them from falling into animistic and anthropomorphic naiveties (as Descartes had definitively shown). Nevertheless, if one was not seeking an easy solution, it was more of a chal- lenge to combat the traditional view of nature, which had been elevated to the dignity of com- mon sense-the "vulgarly received" notion of Boyle's title-as an acting principle capable of behaving harmoniously without knowing the ob- ject of its activity. It is this perceiving nature devoid of consciousness that constitutes the main target of Boyle's argument. The question of Boyle's antagonists is an in- triguing one. Davis and Hunter deserve credit for having understood the importance of Boyle's Free Enquiry not only as a paradigmatic text for the scientific discussions of that period but also as a historical document rich in references, cryp- tic though they may be, to the contemporary philosophical and theological debate. Although scholastic Aristotelianism recurs most frequently as the object of Boyle's polemic, close exami- nation of the treatise reveals his targets to be quite variegated. Without doubt the discussion of nature as a plastic-that is, unperceptive- function refers to Ralph Cudworth and Henry More. Hints at the Helmontian view of nature as a law-like process can also be found in the course of the work. But Boyle has another polemic tar- get that he is more anxious to break down, namely, the view according to which nature is a knowing entity that always attains the best pos- sible result thanks to an intrinsic knowledge. Neither scholastic Aristotelianism nor Cam- bridge Platonism nor Helmontianism maintains that the perception through which the things of nature accomplish their functions belongs im- mediately to their very essence and is totally im- manent in the being of nature. We could refer to this view of a knowing nature as the medical- or better still Hippocratic-notion of nature, or, keeping more within Boyle's contemporary in- tellectual context, as the notion of natural per- ception propounded by Francis Glisson in his De natura substantiae energetica (1672) (a hypoth- esis also put forward by Davis and Hunter in the wake of the studies by John Henry). Glisson's "inconscious life of nature" (the expression is Cudworth's) brought new life, because it was philosophically regrounded, to the Hippocratic idea of nature as a totally "ignorant," self-suffi- cient, homeostatic, and self-restoring power. Al- though the attack against the Aristotelian notion of nature concerned above all the intelligibility of the physical explanations, a wholly different 133</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS-ISIS, 89: 1 (1998) speculative effort was needed for the refutation of the medical naturalism that envisaged radical immanentism as regards teleology and hylozo- ism as regards the theory of matter. In this case the question of intelligibility touched the very foundations of the doctrine of being: substance is in itself alive because it perceives without knowing what it is doing. This work, which admirably testifies to Boyle's equal concern for "truth and philosoph- ical freedom" and "religion," deserves this new edition. And, as Davis and Hunter suggest at the end of their introduction, today an essay on the idea of nature can have more than a simple his- torical significance. GUIDO GIGLIONI Robert Markley. Fallen Languages: Crises of Representation in Newtonian England, 1660- 1740. x + 268 pp., index. Ithaca, N.Y./London: Cornell University Press, 1993. $37.50. What is the proper role of the scholar in history of science: cleverly to create the alleged political and social meanings of a scientific text, going beyond an examination of the interpretations and influences that a text can be shown to have had in a particular historical context, or carefully to document the ideas, events, motives, and per- sonal interactions that contributed to the making of a particular text? Readers who place clever- ness among the highest scholarly virtues will probably like this book; those who believe, as I do, that texts have specific meanings that authors express in specific contexts almost certainly will not. Reflecting his background as a literary critic, Robert Markley's central task is "to describe the history of representation as a complex and inter- nally divided process rather than as a linear se- quence of progressive development" (p. 5). His overall method is to focus on certain works of "physico-theology" (a term borrowed from Wal- ter Charleton) that are concerned with "the crises of representation" (p. 5) resulting from the use of fallen languages in a postlapsarian world in which human science, like human language, could only be imperfect. For natural philoso- phers with a "theocentric conception of lan- guage," such as Robert Boyle and Isaac Newton, "scientific discourse must remain heuristic and incomplete because the only systematic lan- guage, the only coherent (though necessarily mysterious) discourse, is the word of God" (p. 103). Markley sees theology, especially volun- tarist theology, with its emphasis on the ineffa- bility of God and fallibility of human thinking, as the crucial element in the set of events often described by the phrase "the rise of science"-a phrase he vigorously disowns in this ateleolog- ical account of the chaos and contested territory that fill his picture of early modem science. Nor does he find theology missing from contempo- rary science, calling attention to "the invocations of religion or mystical teleology that resurface whenever 'normal' scientific practices find themselves straining against the limits of the the- ories which justify them" (p. 259). Thus far I do not dissent too strongly, as te- dious as it may be to plow through the often dense, at times even Jabberwockian (fallen?), language in which Markley phrases his argu- ment. It is in the details where the devil usually resides. By way of illustration, I will focus on crucial aspects of Markley's highly imaginative picture of Boyle as a politically sophisticated, meticulous controller of language who was care- fully trained to privilege himself as master over a "diabolical-and feminized-realm of experi- ence" (p. 125). Lacking space here for a system- atic rebuttal, perhaps I may be allowed instead to offer a few literary musings of my own-a bit of comic relief to Markley' s Restoration tragedy, one might say. Consider, for example, Markley's interpreta- tion of Boyle's famous experiments on the spring of the air. In his first book on this subject, published in 1660, Boyle provided readers with a splendid plate showing the air pump and di- verse accessories necessary to perform the ex- periments he related, accompanied by a detailed verbal description of the various parts and how they worked together. Here Markley says that "the image of fetishization-stopcocks, orifices, and suckers-cannot be read simply as Freudian projections of psychological neuroses onto the physical world" (p. 229), a statement that on its own one might applaud. Unfortunately, in the context of the book as a whole, it is the word "simply" rather than the word "cannot" that readers should emphasize. I call this view "As You Like It." Shortly afterward, Markley reprints a passage from the "Advertisements touching the Engine it self," in the first of two sequels, Continuation of New Experiments (1669), which has a splendid plate of its own showing an improved version of the pneumatic engine. There Boyle notes that he has not included in this book a verbal description to supplement the plate, explicitly assuming that those readers who are already sufficiently famil- iar with the earlier book to have understood how its engine works will comprehend the improve- 134</page></plain_text>
