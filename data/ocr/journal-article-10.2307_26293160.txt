<plain_text><page sequence="1">J A N J E LINEK BIR MIJI —THE NORTHERNMOST TRI POLÍTANÍ AN ROCK ART SITE ABSTRACT. — Bir Miji, the northernmost Early Neolithic Tripolitunian rock art site is described in a com parative analysis and is recognized as a connecting link between south European and Saharan rock art. Bir Miji is a village on the Tarliuna Plateau, near tlie town of Tarliuna, some seventy km south east of Tripoli. South of the village, near the road to Tarliuna and opposite to a small petrol station in the small rocky valley is situated the hitherto norlhermost Tripolitanian rock art sile (Fig. 1). The importance of the site has been stressed by the discoxciy of stone artefacts (Neuville P. I 1956b). Even today there is a water well in the valley and there is 110 doubt that there existed a spring and a temporary stream was draining the valley in prehistoric times. The area outside llie valley is strewn with scattered stone remains of Roman buildings and associated archaeological finds (Neuville P. 1956b). There are rock engravings 011 three large boul ders at the floor of the valley and 011 the slope of the valley below the Roman ruins, where the rock FIG. i Bir Miji locality. The two boulders with the rock art are in the foreground left and extreme right. The majority of engravings arc situated higher (arrow).</page><page sequence="2">FIG. 2a, b Bir Miji, engraving No. 1. situated on boulder No. 2 in the valley: a 58cm long bovid ligure with a characteristic horn.

On the first big boulder at the bottom of lbe valley we can see irregular engraved lines and scratches in various places. These graffiti are fine and could not have been caused by polishing or grindig bone or stone tools. They are situated also in a rather ir regular way. Under the'boulder we found a small cave or overhang that could serve as a shelter against sunshine or rain. There is a large number ol irregular engraved lines on the horizontal and vertical faces of the second boulder nearby. A detailed study of the boulder reveals four animal figures: No. I. A bovine figure (Bos brachycerosi measuring íiíty eight cm. wilh a simple forward curved horn. Il is presented in lateral view, with fine, simple outlines. Its characteristic born is de corated with wavy lines resembling "flowing water" (Fig. 2a, b). The head of the animal is of a rather simplified triangular shape and its forelegs have been pictured with several irregular thin lines. Better presented are the neck, tail root and the two hindlegs, incomplete in their distal part. On the back of the animal there is another small engraving, probably representing an antelope. No. 2.

In the vicinity of the above-mentioned figures there is another animal figure measuring 17 cm. lis tall and strong body and the head with trunk seem to represent an elephant (Figs. 4a, b). This, however, is contradicted l&gt;y a thick tail and two pointed ears. The vertical lines, probably re presenting the legs of the animal, are situated ir regularly and are not representative. The drawing looks like a disintegration of the realistic form to such a degree that we cannot recognize what kind of animal is it representing. No. 4. The last figure on this rock face is a shallow engraving of an animal measuring 10 em. Only the back line, tail and round head of the animal can be made out. One leg of the animal is represented by two long lines. In front of engraving No. 4 we can see several other irregular lines (Fig. 5). The third large boulder at the bottom of the valley, near the second one and similar to the first two boulders, has many irregular engraved lines on its surface. On its upper horizontal face we can see a large number of engraved lines and among them there are two characteristic figures: No. 5. The first figure shows a highly stylized animal with ils head turned backwards [Fig. Ga, bj. The figure is in simple straight lines — this geo metric style strongly differs from the bulk of the other engravings found here. The individual lines are also deeper and less weathered. Their colour is lighter and they are of more recent origin. The fi gure is 32 cm long and 55 cm high. The head con sists of a number of parallel lines. No. f&gt;. On the same rock face there is a 15 cm large symbol similar to the head of the preceding figure (Fig. 6a, b). The main outline has the shape of an elongated arc and is filled with parallel lines (Fig. 7). The above-mentioned three boulders fell down to the floor of the valley long before prehistoric man used them for engravings. This is clearly document ed by the distribution of the figures and engraved lines. No. 7. If we climb up the rock slope to the small abri and to the rock overhangs, which — as documented by archaeological finds — served as dwelling places for the prehistoric man, we can see many slight and deep irregular engraved lines overall on the rock face. On the flat rock face in front of the cave there is a group of short lines grouped around a small empty space (Fig. 8). The situation is similar also with engraving No. 8 re presenting an eleven cm large animal figure in late ral view and with the bead bowed (Fig, 9a, b). I he big head and the large pointed ears seem to belong to a donkey. Although the figure is engraved in a clear way, its foreleg is not well pictured and the hindleg has not been finished. There are several short engraved lines around the figure. No. 8.

The whole figure is presented in simple outlines. On I lie side of same rock there are two fine engravings of hoofed animals. Ilie first figure (No. 9) is 22 cm long and represents a sheep — judged from the characteristic head and neck. The oilier figure (No. 10), measuring 16 cm. is very in distiucl and dillicult lo identify, but according lt&gt; the shape of the head and body it seems to he a goat (Fig. lia, b). On the upper face of the nexl large liai rock we can see the outline of a 33 cm long bovide-like figure (No. II) in side view, willi a single horn curved forward, lis hind legs are in poor style. On the breast there is an engraved oblique line (Fig. 12a, b). (Hose lathe above figure we can see a 12 cm high engraving showing the front part of an ante lope (No. 12).

Although the figure is in a simple static view, ils forward-leaning body gives the pic tlire a strong dynamic character (Fig. 14a. b). This feature is quite frequent also in other north-African engravings. The geographically nearest engraving of this kind can be found in Wadi Zigza II in North Fezzan, described by P.

The two figures ( a bovid and a human) on the vertical rock face make a single composition. The 30 cm large bovid figuré has a simple oval symbol between ils horns- the oval is divided in the middle by a vertical line (bigs. lňa. h, Kin, b, c). The style of the Hvo'figures is I lie same as that of other local engravings. Stylistically I hey are not quite perfect. They are engraved in simple fine lines and are presented in side view. Higher up on the rock face there are two other father indistinct engravings. The first of them (No. Hi) is 20 cm large and represents an antelope in vertical position (Fig. 17a, b). Adjoining No. 16 is another composite engraving of two or more fi gures (No. 17), measuring 55c,m in height. These figures are not very distinct, il is so due lo the rather weak lines, weathered rock surface, and last but. not least also due to a high degree of schéma tisai ion. The figure on the left is ityphallic (Fig. 1.8a, b). In the vicinity we can find several oilier simple unfinished or broken figures (Fig. 19a, b, 20, 21, 22, 23). No. IS. A few metres aside we can see the re mains of another animal figure measuring 75 cm. II is situated next to a small cave on the vertical rock. Compared with the other engravings this fi gure is relatively deep-cut, nonetheless ihe upper part of the picture, the head and the back of the animal have been completely weathered (I'ig. 24a, b). The curved lines seem I o represent a cir cular symbol, the long tail and legs seem to repre sent a hull. In any case the deeply engraved lines belong to a style different from that of I lie other engravings. On studying ihese nortbermost, Tripolitanian engravings we can consider the style, subject matter, method of engraving, and of course the chronology of the locality: FIG. i5a, b Detail of human figure No. 16a Bir Miji.

Anthropomorphic figures appear in three cases only. In the group of animals there are l\vo hovids with their horns curved forward and downwards, the type appearing frequently in the north-African or Saliaran rock art. We find il in Acacus in Neolithic paintings (Mori. 1965) and there are engravings of litis type in Wadi Zigza (Graziosi, 1.962) and in Mathrndush, or in Wadi I)jer.nl in Tassili (Lhote, 1976). Chronologically this type is associated with the Bubalus period, willt lite Neo lithic hovidian paintings, or with the later paintings or engravings of the cahalline period of the Saharan art. The donkey and antelopes are also broadly represented in lite north African art. Figures 16a, b, c are highly interesting. The symbol situated between the horns of the bovid has many analogies in North Africa and in Central Sa hara (Wadi Zigza IV, Graziosi, 1962). The shape of these symbols ranges from a disc (e.g. Maia Dib, Graziosi 1941, Saharan Atlas or I logar, G, Camps I97/i. talis. XIX and XXIV) to complex sirucliires lo be found in Tibesti, Fezzan, north Algeria and 145 v FIG. 17a, b Bir Miji. Antelope figure.</page><page sequence="14">FIG. 18a, b Bir Miji.

I.hole, 1976). Extensive comparative studies show that symbols of this kind between the boms of' animals are traditional in the north-Afri can and Saharan art. Iluard (1961) interprets them as pictures of an extraordinary animal (the king of lbe animals). As regards the human figure situat ed behind the bovid, we can find again numerous analogies in the north-African and Saharan art re presenting various animals, including bovids. Both the symbol between the horns and the human fi gure situated behind the animal are African ele ments, unknown in the European part of the cir cummediterranean area. The shape of the human figure in Bir Miji (Fig. 15a, c) with its beak-like face reminds of the human figures from Addaura in Sicily (Marconi, 1952—1953, Graziosi, I960), showing analogies in artistic style. An important fact should be kept in mind — lbe Sicilian rock art is archaeologically dated as Epipalaeolithic (Gra ziosi, 1950, 1953, I960). Most archaeologists, how ever, consider the north-African rock art .Neolithic, i.e. younger. However, the Tripolitanian Neolithic hasn't got an absolute dating as yel. 147 FIG. 21 Simple engraving. FIG. 22 An anthropomorph figure.</page><page sequence="16">Style and technology The study of the Bít Mi ji rock art reveals three different styles and technologies. Most figures have been designed in indistinct thin lines, in side view. One of the characteristic features of these pictures is the unfinished design of ihe distal parts of the limbs and the fact that some of them are partly schematic, while the rest of the figure appears to be quite representative. The head is sometimes sche matically triangular. Broad comparative studies have revealed that these engravings are linked with the well-known north-African and Saharan rock art on the one side, but also with the European littoral of the Mediterranean Sea, on the other. The com parison with Sicilian engravings (All. Pellegrino, Ad daura, Levanzo), with the bull from the Grotta di ftomanelli, or with the engravings from the Ehbou Cave in South France show strong analogies, both in subject matter and in style (Graziosi, 1932—1933, 1950, 1953, 1954, 19(i4. Marconi. 1954, 1955. (llory, 1947). All these sites abound in similar subject matter (bovids and some other hoofed ani mals) and have similar style (simple indistinct lines, frequently schematized outline in lateral view, the legs are often unfinished and the hooves are miss ing). I do not think these similarities are the re sults of regular and direct contacts and relation ship. They seem to be, much more likely, the result of life in the same large geographical and ecological region, in a period when North Africa formed an organic part of the Mediterranean region and the Sahara had not yet been isolated from North Africa by vast desert areas as it is now; only the post Neolithic desiccation is responsible for the isolation of Central Sahara from the Mediterranean regions. l'IG. 23 Simple-line animal engraving. FKÍ. 24 Bir Miji. Badly weathered deep animal en graving. The surface weathering of the deeply engraved lines is the same as that of the na tural rock face. It differs in style and age from the hull; of the Bir Miji engravings. 148</page><page sequence="17">The common ecological situation in the past has brought about the distribution of similarities both as regards subject matter and the stylistic elements in the rock art. They are similar results of similar development. Under such circumstances even the weakest and most indirect influence can produce similar results in the rock art, namely in the rock art style. There are also other two styles to be found in I3ir Miji. Engravings Nos. 5, 6 (Figs. 6a, b, 7) found on the third boulder in the valley are strongly geo metrically stylized. Differences in style, weaker pa tina and their better state of preservation point to younger age. A representative of the third different style is engraving No. 18 (Figs. 24a, b). It has been deeply cut into the rock face and the incisions have the sa me patina as the rock surface. Due to the mode of cutting and advanced degree of weathering we must regard this engraving as different in style and older than the other engravings in Bir Miji. ARCHAEOLOGY There are two shelters and a smaller cave on the rock slope. The sediments represented by seve ral layers have been preserved up to these days. P. Neuville on excavating the two principal abris found seven different layers in stratigraphical po sition. According to the archaeological and palaeon tological content of these layers he distinguished three Neolithic layers and the lowest layer belongs posibly to Mousterian (Neuville. 1956b). The earliest Neolithic level (Phase I) contains "graffiti nombreux et de rares gravures naturalistes, d'ailleuers très schématiques".Unfortunately P.Neu ville fails to mention which naturalistic engravings did he find in this level. The second Neolithic level (Phase II) con tained: "Art rupestre comprenant des scènes de chasse et des gazelles finement incisées, de petites dimension, situées sur le parois d'un (Abri A II) et recouvertes par le remplissage 13 contenant une industrie de la Phase II". I did not find any hunting scene mentioned by P. Neuville. Our engraving No. 13 (Fig. 14a, b) represents without doubt the above-mentioned group of engravings. Today it is on the rock above the ground as the respective layer had been excavated. Anyhow, if this engraving (and the other mentioned by P. Neuville) were co vered by the layer of Phase II, then they come from an earlier period, i.e. from the period of Pha se 1. The third Neolithic level (Phase 111, the latest one, contains: "Figurations animalier: boefs domes tiques aux dimensions plus grand que dans la pha se II." Such larger bovine engravings are No. 14 (Fig. 15a, c) and No. 1 (Fig. 2a, b). From the above notes follows that P. Neuville found engravings in all Neolithic levels. He consi ders the sgraffiti the oldest and the large bovids the latest rock art of the Neolithic age. An important fact is that during his excava tions he did not find any Neolithic pottery sherds. We fared equally during our six visits to the site in 1976—1980. The situation is similar also in other Neolithic open-air sites in Tripolitania (Fabbri, Wi norath, Scott, 1965), where pottery sherds are very rare. There is stone industry scattered on the slope under the upper group of engravings, at the bottom of the wadi along the stream bed and sporadically also on the surface of the plain overlying the en gravings. The technological and typological struc ture of this industry was -described by P. Neuville (1956) as Tripolitanean pre-pottery Neolithic. The raw material used for the manufacture of the stone industry was almost exclusively silex. Spo radically occur also jasper, quartzite and other ma terials. Few of the artifacts were burnt in fire. The Capsian traditions detected at the Bir Miji sile suggest the possible existence of relations with the nearby Capsian stations in Wadi Ar Ribat (del Fabbro, 1968). The Bir Miji complex, however, dif fers with its high precentage of side-scrapers. CHRONOLOGY Certain South European rock art finds have been archaeologically dated and due to this fact most rock art students consider the South European group of Mediterranean rock engravings Late Pa laeolithic, regarding the North African engravings as later, chronologically following the South Euro, pean rock art. The rock art of the Bir Miji site in North Libya differs from all known North African rock arts of the caballine or later historical periods. It forms part of the rock art of the Neolithic pasto ral populations. Its style and technology point to the early stages of the Neolithic pastoral period. The archaeological finds also support this view. The style, technique and subject matter of the Bir Miji rock art clearly indicate its connection with the South European Upper Palaeolithic rock art. The crossing of the Mediterranean presented no problem in the Late Palaeolithic. Even sporadic contacts sufficed to bring about similarities regard ing subject matter and style. It is surprising that the links between the South- European Late Palaeolithic art on the one hand, and the Neolithic North Afri can and Saharan art, on the other, have not yet been seriously cosidered and studied. In fact we are still waiting for exact absolute datings of the Tripo litanean Neolithic period.
