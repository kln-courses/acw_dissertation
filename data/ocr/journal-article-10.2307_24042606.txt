In short, pan psychism is opposed to materialism, dualism (in its various The actual things in the world are careers, or series of forms: experience versus non-experience, mind versus matter, actual occasions.5 The primary concrete entities are happen- sentience versus insentience), idealism (if by idealism is meant ings, unit cases of becoming or activity.

Feeling applies to all concrete singulars; consciousness or knowledge only to higher levels of reality, including ani mals. Or better, there are physical aspects of feeling, which give one a sense of the past, and mental aspects of feeling, which give one a sense of the future and the ability to think. So whatever is conscious and can think can also feel, but not vice versa, unless Hartshorne and Wordsworth are obviously more in terested in metaphysics, broadly conceived in Wordsworth's case, but this does not mean that their views are necessarily at odds with the pragmatic interpretation of quantum me chanics. Both are very much interested in how we experience nature, or speaking crudely, what works for us when we try to explain the world. The principle of indeterminacy led some to speculate that hidden variables would be found to save absolute determinism—these hidden variables have never been way. brought to light. At the very least, this much must be said about the effort to speculate metaphysically on the basis of God is everywhere, the catechisms taught us, but did discoveries in contemporary physics: we cannot understand they illustrate as well as Wordsworth how this could be so? microscopic (or submicroscopic) events on the analogy of mac That is, for Wordsworth religion not only helps us to better roscopic objects like billiard balls, yet it is precisely these understand animals, but analogously regarded deity itself is a objects which give us our notions of inertness and determin sort of superanimal!

This fact does not give us a carte blanche, but it does give us the freedom to take Wordsworth's view of nature Macaulay was wrong in describing Wordsworth's seriously, as does Hartshorne. Wordsworth's view includes thought as "crazy metaphysics." Rather, it makes sense to the following features: throughout animate nature, even plant think that science, which Wordsworth largely detested ("We life, there is feeling; so-called "inanimate" nature is not really murder to dissect") has vindicated the master's position.

But the pathetic fallacy is committed here only if one is a materialist or dualist, the latter view prohibiting animate But I would like to reiterate that Wordsworth was not characteristics being read into inanimate matter, the former committed to any implausible view here.

The question is not whether winds were really only committed to the view that in its small, perhaps invisible bewildered or forlorn; rather Wordsworth asks us about our or microscopic, parts the tree's "twigs" are sentient. Nor was experience of winds, which appear to us as feelings. And as Wordsworth a naive realist who directly intuited the feelings contemporary physics at least allows, the winds themselves of birds or plants. Our most direct contact with physical reality in their microscopic parts may feel. Physical things come into is with what happens inside our bodies, especially in our our experience only as feelings. Might not Wordsworth's nervous systems; only then do we perceive reality through our opponents be committing a more prevalent fallacy: the apa cells and nervous systems. If human sensation is participation thetic or prosaic fallacy, which is to assume that all of reality, by persons in the feelings of subhuman individuals (i.e., cells), or most of it, is like an insentient chair?

But how strong is the evidence that all of reality—atoms In physical pain or pleasure we share in the feelings as well as God—is rock-like? Not too strong. It seems to be of microindividuals. Following Whitehead, Hartshorne calls Wordsworth's opponents who are open to the charge of il sympathy "feeling of feeling." Feeling itself, if not feeling of legitimate anthropomorphism by exaggerating the role of hu feeling, goes far down in the scale or organisms, far below man qualities at the expense of other animals, supposedly birds or fish.

This is the nervous system. Yet single cells it practically implies "true." Nothing could be easier than to act as one, and naturally without a nervous system since that accuse Wordsworth of the pathetic fallacy. Consider these consists of many cells of a specialized kind. A nervous system lines from "The Simplon Pass," also found in the Prelude has the function of restoring on a higher level the unity of (Book VI): action (and feeling?) which single cells, as well as single molecules, have on lower levels.

Consider that the divine body does not need ment, then and only then is conflict and frustration in nature limbs to move about, for it is its own place: space being merely made the rule rather than the exception. the order among its parts. It does not need a digestive system 43</page><page sequence="7">or lungs to take in food or air from without in that there is no "without." So it is with all organs outside the central nervous system, which is the organ that adapts internal ac tivities to external stimuli, a function which is not needed in the inclusive organism. The only function of the divine body is to furnish the World-Soul with awareness of, and power over, its bodily members. So although there is no special part of the cosmos recognizable as a nervous system, every indi vidual becomes, as it were, a brain cell directly communicating to the World-Soul, and likewise receiving influences from divine feeling or thought, as Wordsworth often attests. Wordsworth's panpsychism insists that the notion of being cannot be separated from that of experience; experience is not merely a bridge to reality, it is the paradigm case of reality. The ultimate structure of experience is social in that experience is united either in animal bodies or in the divine body. This metaphysics of social structure can be cited along with other reasons in the attempt to deemphasize a pretentious theory of self-interest, which suggests that a rational ethics depends upon the possibility of showing that the good person is bound to be benefited in the long run by his own good acts. If there is no universe, no World-Soul to bring the world together into a social (animate) structure, then the atheistic virtue of courage, as opposed to love, in the face of the distant doom of humanity seems childish. If love is the heightening of internal relations among beings that care for each other, then love must ultimately be grounded in God, who is inter nally related to all beings: this is why God, for Wordsworth, is the proper object of worship. No doubt materialists and dualists will accuse the panpsychist of "mysticism." But mysticism can either mean: (1) immediate experience of God; or (2) the belief that this experience and God are ineffable. The first is quite distinct from the second. It is certainly paradoxical that God could only be affirmed indirectly, especially if God is ubiquitous. We are more like non-introspective animals than we usually admit. Data that are only sometimes present (for example, red or pain) are easier to detect than those which are always there (for example, SI or S3). The mystic is only relatively different from the rest of us: the mystic is aware of experi encing what all human beings experience. In this regard only the mystic escapes animal-like unconsciousness. "With an eye made quiet by the power of harmony and the deep power of joy," says Wordsworth in Tintern Abbey, the mystic sees "into the life of things." That is, I am only defending the first, Wordsworthian variety of mysticism. The first human beings who emerged on earth inherited a magnificent environment, and they appreciated this fact. However, their appreciation (or better, their reverential awe) was clouded by fear. Events in nature, especially animals, were themselves deified. Civilization has stripped, in a com mendable way, human beings of this fear of nature, and of the deification of animals. But it has also stripped human beings of their sense of the inexhaustible beauty and glory of the web of life. Paradoxically, it is only now that beauty and glory, in their planetary totality, are being made accessible by the very industrialism that tends to destroy them. Our machines have not enabled us to find our place among the natural kinds. Only art or philosophy or religion can help us do this. The trick is to avoid primitive fear and awe while still respecting nature. Panpsychism enables us, as it did Wordsworth, to do this. NOTES •See Thoraas McFarland, Originality and Imagination (1985). Despite the fact that I disagree with McFarland's dualism, I agree with the theses of two of his previous books; indeed, this article is an attempt to expand on the notions that the Romantic thinker yearns for reticulative wholeness while realizing his diasparactive frag mentariness. See McFarland's Coleridge and the Pantheist Tradition (1969), and Romanticism and the Forms of Ruin (1981). 'See my Hartshome and the Metaphysics of Animal Rights (1988); this book expands on many of the topics in this article. 3See Karl Popper and J. C. Eccles, The Self and Its Brain (1977), p. 438.

Although "animism" was often the product of alchemical and hermetic lore, some version of the position that all of nature is alive endured throughout the centuries. Traces of Greek hylomorphism and the medieval preservation of that position can be found even in Francis Bacon and in several seventeenth and eighteenth century scientists, and in the early nine teenth century it had a "brief but spectacular efflorescence." That is, running counterpoint to Descartes' conception of matter as lifeless was Leibniz's conception of sentient monads (inspired, in part, by Leeuwenhoek's discovery of the microscope). Coleridge came into contact with the different sorts of dynamism in chemistry through Humphrey Davy's dynamical atomism and pure force theories. Ac cording to Coleridge, Davy's greatest discoveries were made during the suspension of the "mechanic Philosophy." 5See Alfred North Whitehead's classic work, Process and Real ity, corrected edition (1978).

Also see Trevor Levere's Poetry Realized in Nature: Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Early Nine teenth Century Science (1981), pp. 7, 40, 65, 79, who notes that for Coleridge (and Wordsworth) mind was active in nature, which was itself organic, alive, and developing. By way of contrast, associationist psychology presented the mind as mechanical and passive. Among 44</page><page sequence="8">Coleridge's synoptic projects was to have been an outline of the history of science contrasting favorably dynamic science to mechan ical science. For Coleridge, if science were to recover its integrity it would need a revolution by which dynamism would subvert the rising tide of mechanism. 'Hartshorne, Insights and Oversights, p. 141. Also see "In Defense of Wordsworth's View of Nature," Philosophy and Litera ture, 4 (1980), 80-91; The Divine Relativity (1948); and Philosophers Speak of God (1953), all by Hartshorne. 'See Trevor Levere, Poetry Realized in Nature, pp. 63, 107, 162, 208, where Coleridge's distinction between the "life of nature" and "life in nature" is treated: the former is infused into the latter by God, hence the former is incompatible with atheism. "Mechan ical" was the great polemical adjective for romantic thinkers in general, just as "organic life" was the central metaphor of romantic science. It should not surprise us, therefore, that Coleridge saw the chasm between physics and physiology as "arbitrary." In fact, in his The Theory of Life he stressed the continuity of life throughout nature, from mineral to man. '"Hartshorne, "In Defense of Wordsworth's View of Nature," p. 83. Wordsworth himself warns us in the fourteenth book of the Prelude of "The tendency, too potent in itself, / of use and custom to bow down the soul / Under a growing weight of vulgar sense, / And substitute a universe of death / For that which moves with light and life informed." And about a dividing mentality "dead and spiritless" which "waging thus / An impious warfare with the very life / Of our own souls." "See Trevor Levere, Poetry Realized in Nature, pp. 21, 58, 62, 216-17, where Coleridge is quoted as asking "What is life? Were such a question proposed, we should be tempted to answer, what is not life that really is?" As in notes 5, 10, and 13, above, Coleridge shows acute awareness of the concerns of contemporary panpsychists. His definition of life is "the power which discloses itself from within as a principle of unity in the many." One is reminded here of Plato's definition of being as power (dynamis) or Hartshorne's Platonic conception of reality as the creative synthesis of many influences into a single actual occasion. Further, Levere is correct in noting that Coleridge's opposition to mechanism is connected to his opposition to atheism. Contrast this to the Newtonian's world of fragmented little things. Once again, Coleridge (and Wordsworth) thought he had scientific support for his view of nature as dynamic from Davy, whom he viewed as the greatest man of the age after Wordsworth. 12Hartshorne, "In Defense of Wordsworth's View of Nature," p. 87.

Lovelock, Gaia (1979) who explores a new— or perhaps revives an ancient—concept of the relationship between the earth and its biosphere. His thesis is that the entire range of living matter on the earth, from whales to viruses and from oaks to algae, can be regarded as a single living entity. This is an alternative to the view of our planet as demented and purposeless, albeit Gaia, for Lovelock, does not encompass the whole universe and is elabo rated, strangely enough, through a cybernetic model. Imagine the following thought experiment: if we looked at a telescopic motion picture of some large segment of the universe taken over a period of millions of years, but played back within one hour, might we not see some familiar, purposive, organismic actions? Also, imagine an opposite experiment slowing down immensely microscopic action. Do not S3 and SI become more understandable through these ex periments?</page></plain_text>
