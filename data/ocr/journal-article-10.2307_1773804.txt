But mean- shile, enough preliminary or reconnaissance work has bee1l done to permit the construction of a general topographical and a general geological lnap of the United States. Such general topographical map was published by the Geological Survey iIl 1890. It is now uxld.ergoing revision preparatory to printing a new edition. This topographical map is on a sca]e of 1 to 2,500,000, or about 40 miles to 1 inch. It is composed of 9 sheets, which colubined forrn a wall map 6- by 4 feet. It resembles in genelal form and character the detailed atlas sheets, being engraved upon copper and printed in three colouls black for cultural features, blue for water features, and brown contours for relief features. XVith certaill minor exceptions the colltour interval is lOOO feet. For portions of the country the data now a-ailable is sufficient for an accurate luap on this scale; for other parts it is insufficient, and revision must needs be made from time to time to bring the map up to date. XVith tlle foregoing map as abase, the manuscript of a geological map of the United States has been prepaled, alld is now in the hands of the engraver. \\'hile this leap must of necessity be subject to estensilre revision, and while not all will aglee that even now it perfectly accords with all knowIl facts, it nevertheless is doubtless as satisfactory as any that could be compiled from present krlowledge. It is planned to hale an edition of it printed before the end of the present year. The accompanying luap shows the progress lBade by the Geological Survey in preparing the topographical base map of the United States; a map designed as the base for a geological map, but also intended to serve as a general topographical nlap. THE ISLAND OF ENGANO. * By DR. F. H. H. GUILLEMARD. THE public is indirectly indebted to the Netherlands India Gos-ernment for the appearance of this book, as we learn from the author on its first page. Dr. Modigliani had succeeded in escaping the vigilance of the Dutch authorities in Sumatra, had crossed that island frown west to east, had penetrated the country of the independent Battaks, and was contemplating fresh journe;ys irlto prohibited l egions, when he was suddenly confronted by an official docutnent whieh, in the position he then was, put an end to all his plans. " You will inform Si^,nor Modi- gliani," ran the instructions to the (Sontroleur, " that it is for the last * ' L'Isola delle Donlle: Viaggio ad Engano.' By Elio Modigliani.

E. the Gourernor warns him not to trarrel beyond the limits of the districts administered by Government; and that if Signor Iodigliani should continue, in spite of this warning, to travel in the independent territory, the Governor will withdraw the permission given him to travel in other parts Of Sumatra." It is possible that Dr. Modi- gliani did not always recognize the importance of gaining the support l)f theg Dutch authorities, who are for theg most part estremely courteous to scientific travellers; but be this as it may} the result was that, finding his plans for the exploration of the mainland thwarted, he was once again led to turn his attention to the chain of islands lying ofE its western coast. Dr. Modigliani's travels in Pulo Nias had given hitn re,sults of con- siderable scie,ntific inte,re,st, which he, publishe,d in his ' Viaggio a Nias ' in 1890. This island, which lies towards the, nolthern e,nd of the, chain, is the largest, and was already tole,rably well known. Engaiio, on tne, other hand, the, lnost southerly of them, had ve,ry r3vrely been visited, and was nearly wirgin ground for the, naturalist. It might,-the,re,fore,, be, expected to afford the, explorer something of interest, in spite of its uniinportant size; and it may be said to have fulfilled these e2zpectations, for the author is led to form conclusiosls not only as to the origin of the natives, but as to the geological history of the island itself, which, if not absolutely unassailable, are very plausible, and at the same time celtainly novel. The author, in addition to the description of his travels, gives a chapter upon the earlier notices of the island. That its name must have been conferred by one of the early Portuguese or Spallish navigators is evident, but he has not been able to throw any light upon the question as to the voyage vhich first brought it to the knowledge of Europeans, and the first recorded occurrence of the name is in the itinerary of Van Linschoten's vof age in 1596. Up to the middle of the present century Engaiio remained little more than a naine, but since then it has from time to tiine been visited by the Dutch offlcials, and occasional notices of it published in the reports of the Batavian societies. None of these, hom7ever, orith two exceptions, aSord much information. The two ex- ceptions are Von Rosenberg':3 narrative of his fortnight's visit in 1852,* and the fuller account of Controleur O. L. Helfrich, who appears to have sta-ed on the island for some time in 1886.t Signor Modigliani's residence was from the beginning of May to mid July, 1891. Engano is of small size, not exceeding 15 miles in its greatest diameter, and its highest elevation is stated to be about 380 feet. lt appears to be composed of coralline limestone, and to be completely eurrounded by reef^, while its surface is alinost entirely covered n7ith * ' Tijdschrift s.

To the Malay traders and the inhabitants of the mainland it is known as Pulo Telangiang. The Enganese themselves, as is so o*en the case among island peoples, have no name for it, merely speaking of it as " t}:e land " or "the island; " and the European appellation is, of coulse, unknown. The English Admiralty chart, in the author's opinion, is inaccurate, but he states that he was unable to reetify it, owing to his having been attacked with illness just as he was commencing a rough survey of the south-east portion of the island. The climate is described as being far from healthy, and Dr. Modigliani suffered much from malarial fever, though it is possible that his attacks may have been the outcome of his journeys in Sumatra. The mosquit.oes are well- nigh intolerable; so much so, illdeed, that he declares tlley have modified native domestic architectule, and led to the construction of huts of a very peculiar type, to which we shall have presently to refer. Although Dr. Modigliani presumably travelled primarily as a collector of objects of natural history, the reader who expects to find in his volume accounts of the habits and life-history of plants and animals- such field-naturalists' lore, in short, that makes tlle volumes of Darvin, Bates, or Wallace such charming reading will be disappointed. There is no attempt at anything of the kind in the book, although from time to time mention occurs of various new species discovered by the traveller. Nor is this atoned for by any lists of the plants and animals obtained, which might very well have found place in an appendis, espeeially as the collections have been described in publications not of easy access to every one. The ethnologist is better treated, and upon the manners and customs of the people, their language, dress, weapons, and carvings, there is a very considerable amount of information, which is for the most part of unusual interest. The Enganese of the coast, or rather of those parts of it visited by the Malay and Chinese traders, are of very varied type, and may be said almost to have incorporated themselves with these two races. It is only in the villages of the interior that those of pure blood can be follnd. IIere they e2rhibit characteristics peculiar to diverse races, enlarging the ear-lobe to a ring as do many of the tribes in New Guinea and the Melanesian islands, carving wood with great dexterity and taste, the human fi,ure being a favourite subject for representation, and making anthropomorphic figure-heads to their praus of the same material. Other eastern links are the suckling of the lower animals (chiefly puppies) by the women, and the non-existence of betel-chewing. On the other hand, the spears, krisses, and very large shields in use are evidently of Malay type. In physique, the people, though not averaging more than 5 feet 2 inches in the case of the men, and 4 feet 9 inches in that of the women, are described by Dr. Modigliani as strong and well built, and easily able to carry 70 lbs. weight of baggage on a long day's march. The type, as far as can be judged from the excellent illustrations, does</page><page sequence="4">THE ISL.&amp;ND OF ENG.XS O. 1a6 not depart greatly from the average Malay, except that the upper lip is unusually long, while the mouth is very coulmonly held wide open. This latter habit is specially remarked upon by the author, and appears in sonze of the illustrations, giving a curious aspect of astonishment to the individual. In spite of tbeir muscular strength, the islanders appear to be neither long-lined nor healthy, and the decrease in thei] numbers is only paralleled by the depopulation which has taken place in so many of the Pacific Islands. IIere, however, it cannot be so easily accounted for, for civilization is practically non-existent. Spirits, it is true, have been introduced to a certain estent, but clothes, though possessed in abundance, do IlOt al)pear to be habitually worn; and of the two, the latter are probably the most deadly in their effect. Signor AIodit,liani, it may be parenthetically rernarked, has something to answer for upon this point, for his rnost successfill articles of barter were o]d theatrical costumes, and future travellers must not be astonished at &amp; meeting with Mephistopheles and other still more startling figures which this ingenious author confesses to have intro- duced t In a sholt time, however, it is probable that there will be no actors left upon this novel staz,e. In 1868 the population was ascero tained by the Dutcll authorities to be about 6a00. Now Dr. Zlodig;liani declares that there are not laore than 600 to 600 remaining; the result, he considers, of the prevalent custom of procuring abortion, and the general laxity of morals. The two most striking features of the Engallese are their houses, and the elahorate carving to which allusion has been made. The forzuer almost exactly resemble beehives, e2zeept that the roof is of slightly higher piteh. They are elevated on piles some 10 feet or more *om tlle ground, and are entirely thatehed with the leases of the nipa-palm. The eireular room thus formed has a diameter of about 12 feet, and is windowless, the light erltering only by the door, whieh is of oval form, and hardly more than 1o inehes in its long;est measurement. Throut,l} this the owner enters head-foremost, and only w ith eonsiderable diffieulty, aeeess to it being aSorded by an upright notehed pole a method widely in use in Malaysia. The doorway is eut out of a single bloek of woo(l, arld is elosed by a door upon whieh figure the most elaborate examples of the carver's skill. Dr. Modigliani gives illltstrations of elevert of these doors, which are eertainly most remarkable productions for people so low in the seale of eivilizatiorl, and hazards the opinion that the islanders obtained their ideas on deeorative art from foreign objeets that have irl some manller reached their hands, possibly as the result of some of the shipwrecks whieh are kllown to have oecurred on the for- midable reefs by whieh the islarld is surrounded. But most readels of his book will probably think such an explanation unneeessary, for these earvings appear so varied in design and applieation, and, to judge fros the numerous forms of the extraordinary etctc7z head-dress whieh he</page><page sequence="5">THE ISLAND OF ENGANO. 1 .47 figures, so intolerant of fised model, that it is more natural to look upon them as the outcome of unassisted native talent A large portion of the book is devoted to an aeeount of the eustoms, beliefs, and supelstitions of the islanders, whieh need not be referred to here. The people appear to be; very harmless, and though arms are from long eustom earried bSr every one, they are but seldom used. Theft is almost unknown. One of the chiefs informed Dr. Modigliani, wllen he desired to leave some baggage in his eharge, that it was suflieient to eord it with rattan and leave it where it was, or tie it up to a tree, and it would remain untouehed. Similar methods are employed in other parts of Malaysia, but are sueeessful only from the fear of the would-be thief of some proteetint, eharm. In Engano, however, the people seem to be preternaturally virtuous in this respeet, and, indeed, have many good qualities; one of the most useful to theinselves being the fastidious cleanliness of their dwellings and villages. Agriculture is very primitive: the eoeo-palm and banana supplsr nearly the only means of subsistenee, for riee is unknown. Some of the foreit produee would be valeable if trade were to beeome established; trees sueh as the Mo? bo (Intsia ambo- aensis), the BagK (Gnetusl gnow710n), rattan, bamboo, nibong and others. The question of the origin of the Enganese is perhaps the most interestiIlg of those eonsidered by the author. By Von Rosenberg they were deseribed as NeOritos, but it is hard to say upon what grounds, for their height and general build, and the absenee of frizzliness in the hair, at once diSerentiates then. Oudemans eonsiders them to be Battaks, who first peopled Nias and therlee e2rtended thenlselves south-eastward throughout the ehain of islands; but Dr. Modigliani, who is probably better aequainted with the Battaks thall any other European, deelares that he eannot pereeive the slightest traee of physical resemblanee between the two peoples, and, judging from his soeabularies, there is certainly no linguistic eonneetion. He does, however, find a maIked resemblanee to the Nieobarese, not only irl physical appearance, but also with regard to eustoms and arehiteeture, and gives illustrations in sup- port of this vie,w which are rather striking, though more, e,videnee is of eourse neeessary to promote the theortr fronl the region of eonjeeture into that of probability. The fauna of Engano is stated to show marked diiferenees from that of Sumatra exeept with regard to its kirds, and [nore or less affinity with that of thes Nicobars, and it is suggested by Mr. W. Doherty that the islands fringing the south-western coast of Snmatra are, with the Andamans and Nieobars, the remains of a penin- sula which jutted out froln Pegu at solne geological period when Sumatra was not in existence as a continuous land, but represented only by a few scattered volcanic peals rising from the sea. Mr. A. R. AVallace, it may be leme[nbered, holds that the fringing islands undoubtedly formed part of Sllmatra at no very distant period. Professor Arinciguerras * 4 Aull. tlus. Civ. di GenovaS' 2nd series, sii., 1892.</page><page sequence="6">108 RECLUS' ' UNIRrERS KL GEOGRAPHY.' reconciles these two apparently contradictory theories by adopting both, believing that by solcania action and upheaval the insular peaks becal le joined to Mr. Doherty's hypothetical peninsula, and that the chain of islands were separated during a later epoch of subsidence. Dr. Modigliani gives a bibliography of the island, and a careful socabulary of about 600 words and phrases in the Nias, Enganese, and Battak tongues, the latter being of the language spoken in the district round the Toba lake. The chief fault of his book lies in the poverty and complete uselessness of the index. The names of places are not always to be found upon the map at the end of the volume, and both the title and arrangement of the book might have been altered with advantage. The ' Viaggio a Nias' is far superior to tlle present solume in almost every respect. But it is hard to say anything in dispraise of a work whicll, publ;shed at the extraordinarily moderate price of four shillings (S lire), gives us so mtlch that is interesting in eo new a field. RECLUS ' UNIVERSAL GEOGRAPHY.' + By HALFORD J. MACKINDER, M.A. To the roll of medallists which includes Murchison and Markham, Petermann and Keith Johnston, Yule and Solnerville, the Counc;] have this ear fitly added the name of Elisee Reclus, author of the most complete geographical survey of tlle wolld of this or any other age. The ' Geographie Universelle,' or, as M. Reclus evidently prefers to call it, ' La Terre et les Hommes,' must be pronounced a great achies-e- ment, were it considered only as a feat of literary endurance and courage. It consists of nineteen volulnes, each composed of from f00 tl) lC00 pages, and it is illustrated with more than 3500 maps and nearly lS00 pictures. Every chapter is ellriched for the student with a wealth of authorities accurately cited in notes. These facts become the more impressive whell it is remenlbered that the work appeared in weekly instalments to subscribers, arxd that not once irl the whole period did hI. Reclus and llis publishers fail to meet their engagement, though the author was at times far away anzassing materials in the United States O1 Brazil. At the end of each volume is a note of acknowledgment dedicated to his collaborators-his illformants and critics, his carto- graphers, artists, engravers, and readers for the press. After the appeasance of the first few volumes, when the full impoltance of the undertakinr, became apparent, savants of all lands volunteered their llelp. Occasionally the death is mentioned of some old friend, thanked in the final notes of many previous solurnes, and the reader is made ta * 'La Geo^,laplwie Univelsel'e: La 'I'erle et Le9 EIonales,' par Elisee Recltls v018. 1874-1894 Pari8 and London: Hachette et (Sie.</page></plain_text>
