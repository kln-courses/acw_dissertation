<plain_text><page sequence="1">XJniversal \^alue of ian Aesthetics Reflections of a w ester ner Laksmi, the goddess of Fortune. Though many points are still obscure and many problems are awaiting fuller documen? tation before they can be definitively settled, one can safely say that our archaeological and more especially our historical knowledge of Indian arts has now, after a century of earnest study, attained an accuracy and fulness that could hardly have been hoped for. The curiosity aroused at first by the exotic character and the magnificence of many of its works has gradually made way for a deeper and more thorough appreciation which en? ables us to seize their symbolical significance and mystical inspiration. But, taken as a whole, the art of India has not been as much admired among us as other Oriental art, perhaps just because of the difficulty the Western mind finds in accustoming itself to the complex religious symbolism that is one of its most interesting and important aspects. For Indian art is essentially religious, and cannot easily be separated from the deep mys tical and speculative motives that inspire it. It arose in a world steeped in a deeply religious atmosphere, whose infinite variety of shades are the very essence of Indian civilisation, and it has been called on to express metaphysical conceptions more than merely human relations so much so that the notion of art for art might seem totally foreign to the Indian mind. In India, indeed, a purely aesthetic activity is lacking, at least until the theory of ? pure beauty ? arose almost at the close of the Midd? le Ages. Indeed, if we are to accept in full the several texts, artistic creation is seen as part of a" ritual, so minute and pedantic are the rules laid down for the artist, whether painter or sculptor, on the method he must follow to produce images possessing in full their sacred value. This makes it very difficult to separate these images from the religious environment that formed and at times animates them, for the creative vision of the artist is always accom 299</page><page sequence="2">panied by a purpose.other, than a purely aes? thetic one; the artist always acts as the link between the human and the superhuman. So far, the attitude required of the Indian artist does not differ much from that required by any other form of religious art, from the most ancient to the most modern. And yet a deep difference exsists and is very evident to us, accustomed as we are to the sublime cor? poreal beauty of the Greek gods, to the majesty and power of the Roman creations, to the rapture of certain Gothic figures. It is not easy for us to conceive that Durg? has ten arms, that Siva may have five faces and four arms, and Brahma four heads and a like number of arms. Conceptions of mul? tiplied power, of universal sovereignty, of complex symbolisms, at times apparently grue? some, determine these forms which have all a common origin. These divinities are con? ceived plunged in deep meditation, I might say in a state of mystic concentration which is the fundamental condition required for their adoration. The psychic process (connected with the doctrine of Yoga) by which this degree of concentration is attained, is called in Sans? crit dhy?na, and dhy?na is also the name given to the forms in which both the Hindu and the Buddhist deities are portrayed. A successive psychic stage in which the mind of the meditator becomes one with the object on which he meditates, is called sam?dhi. These forms, arising from complex procedures whose aim is to attain mystic; visions, are minutely described in the texts and, on the other side, the artists were bound to follow these texts. For the believer was to pass from the physical image of the divinity to a state of ecstasy in which the image gradually becomes bodyless, enabling the mind of the meditator to become one with the essence of the religious concep? tion which gives rise to the plastic or pictorial figuration. We thus see that the aim was to express a spiritual message which only incidentally took on a corporeous form in the image of the deity. Starting from these principles, it is easy to understand that the iconography of India could not but follow an unusual path. Not even the need of representing the persons of human Masters, such as Buddha or Mah?vTra of the Jains, could affect these conceptions. The body of the Buddha before and after Illlumination was anatomically the same, but the Illumination completely transformed the ascetic Gautama, conferring on him absolute superiority over the whole universe. Indeed, as he was born to conquer the Law and reveal it to men, he was, substantially, the Law itself. The Illumination, the revelation, the idea of the monastic order, that is to say the three famous jewels of Buddhism, were spiritual events that had nothing to do with his physical structure. It was thus that early Buddhist art, feeling its own incapacity to give human form to the essentially spiritual essence of the Buddha, had recourse to symbols, already widespread and accepted by Vedic thought, which express a definite value, that of the universal and ab? solute principle. Then the Indian artist, hav? ing freed himself from the western elements that determined the first creation of the image in human form and expressed this supreme value in a language foreign to India, felt the need of constantly subordinating the anato? mic features to the expression of a rich inner life. He culled from the texts those distinctive symbolical signs which best lend themselves to representation and sought to idealise the figure by showing it physically in unison with the pulsation the universe, utterly serene and indifferent to world con? tingencies, solicitous only of making men participate in its own serenity, or at least to lavish on them charitable compassion. The human personality of the Buddha be? comes one with the Law he preached, and the later speculations of Buddhism stress these concepts, already intuitively known to the ar? tists of the several schools. The Prajn? school, of which Subh?ti is a representative, affirms that everything is illusory and unreal except the Illumination. N?g?rjuna in his subtle dialectical system draws a distinction between the phenomenic life of the Buddha and his real infinite substance, known as Dharmak?ya, that is to say ? the body formed by the Law ?. The physical body of the Buddha, R?pak?ya, is conceived as limitless like space, therefore formless and yet containing all forms. And the Vajracchedikd says: ? Those who saw me as form and heard me as sound un? dertook a vain enterprise : they will not sec me ?. and it adds: ?For the Buddhas have for body the Law and the Law cannot be understood nor can one make it understood ?. The text means to allude to the fact that the Law can only be known intuitively. The whole philosophy of Buddhism was therefore already contained in the artistic re 300</page><page sequence="3">Elephanla. Siva Mahesvara (8th century A. D.). 301</page><page sequence="4">presentations, whether symbolic or anthro? pomorphic. Here we have one of the most typic al exam? ples of the reciprocal relation that binds In? dian art to religious thought. Reciprocal. I say, because just as art obeys the dictates of orthodoxy, so orthodoxy evolves and is trans? formed by the force of artistic activity, on which the meditations of the faithful are fixed. There is no doubt, as has been shown by the studies of Mus (1), that the supreme pentad of the Buddhas, proper to the Mah?y?nic and Tantric schools, arose partly as a reflex of the multiplication of the plastic and pictorial representations of the Buddha, as well as on the basis of the deep meditation devoted to some of the episodes of his life , which acquired additional evidence and im? portance from their inconographic represen? tation. The tie between art and religious thought is a close one, it would seem as though the two activities could fuse into one. J his relation between art and thought also displays itself in another way. for the Indian artist, in creating his plastic and pictorial works, obeys more or less unconsciously to a vision of life and of the world which is an essential feature of Indian civilisation, I might almost say one of its most important aspects. For Indian thought man is not the supremely important being, the lord of nature, he is onlv a part of it. And the artist tries to show the harmony, I might say the brotherhood that links together the several forms of life, from the loftiest to the humblest, and he never fails to frame a story or an episode in the environ? ment in which it took place. At times it would seem that the wondrous dream of a St. Fran? cis, endowed with the knowledge of a man of the jungle, is the ideal inspiring the Indian artists, who from the dawn of history down to our own days display an extraordinary cleverness in representing all kinds of animals, of whose forms they are undoub Bhuvanesvara.

School of Gandh?ra. tedly the most enthusiastic idealisers. The wealth of the fauna inhabiting the great Peninsula greatly favours this art, provid? ing it with an inexhaustible source of inspiration. Such interest, such exceptional skill could not have arisen, had there not been a definite cosmic outlook, common to many of the religions of India, which places human and animal life on the same plane. The con? ception of karma and the consequent cycle of births and deaths that ties all beings to the wheel of life is indeed not foreign to this point of view. And here be it noted that only the materia? listic currents of classical Indian philosophy deny the law of karma, though in its details that law is variously interpreted by the diffe? rent orthodoxies. On the other hand, when dealing with hu? man figures the artist is attracted above all by the desire to express the dominant state of mind. Feelings and qualities, sometimes ne? gative, are what he wishes to express. He is not interested in the external aspect but in something deeper, in the fundamental attitude of a soul. It may be objected that this search for deeper expression is sometimes lost in the greater, many-figured scenes. But it should not be forgotten that those scenes are a part of narrative cycles in which the protagonist is almost always the central figure. The others are merely details required for identifying the episode to be represented. And in such cases, what counts is the edifying or metaphy? sical side of the episode, the inner essence inspiring the legend represented by the artist. Everything circles round the central image which expresses itself through its symbolical structure, even if it be in anthropomorphic shape, for the arrangement of the hands, the mudr? (seal), clearly indicates the spiritual state. But we must not suppose that this symbo? lism of gesture is expressed crudely. The artist often seeks to impress on those hands, fixed in predetermined positions, a vibration of life which is artistically powerful and not a dead symbolism. The rhythmic lines of the Ajant? paintings, the spiritual lengthening of the hands, brings sometimes to mind the paint? ings of the Sienese artists and Gothic art in general. And here we have another fundamental feature of Indian art: movement. It should be noted that ever since the proto historic period, we find in Indian art unex? pected formal additions of exceptional im? portance for the history of universal art. For the great centres of the so-called Harapp? and Mohenjo-daro civilisation in the middle Seated Buddha. 303</page><page sequence="6">M?mallapuram. Adi Varaha Cave (Early 7th century A. D.). of the third millennium B.C., with their fully developed artistic activities must have requi? red a long period of preparation, as yet in? sufficiently known. Now, in the case of the best of these works, we find in this art not only ability to represent the anatomical structure of human and animal shapes with a power which is often truly striking, but we also find that the so-called frontal and pa? rallel representations, proper to the most ancient forms of art, have been fully discarded. It is an art which has so fully mastered the technique of fore? shortening as a means of representing move? ment, that it almost seems to have reached a point, though at so great a distance of time and space, where it can stand beside Greek art. There can he no doubt that sinc e very an? cient times movement attracted the attention of the proto-Indian artists, leading them to master the technical devices needed for illus? trating it in their plastic works. But, in spite of the commercial and cultural relations that connected India with the Meso potamian West, these creations of hers awoke no echo. Sumerian art in its highest expres? sions continued to rely on motionless lines, and even exercised some influence on the con? temporary art of India. This favourable reception given to a foreign canon does not diminish the importance of the purely Indian representations, nor docs it affect the spirit that animates them. We know little about the early religion of Harapp?, but there are many indications justifying the belief that its cosmic vision of things was, at least in part, similar to that of classic India. The same love for animal forms, the same ideals of feminine beauty; nor is it a 304</page><page sequence="7">mere ehanee that some of its most beautiful works are connected with dancing. The little bronze statuette of a dancing girl in repose, carried out with perfect mastery of movement which does not exclude a marked degree of idealisation, is of less interest for us than the torso in grey stone which, according to the most reliable reconstructions, represented a three headed, ichthyphallic god. taking a dance step. If the reconstruction is correct, we should have before us a dance of Siva ante-litteram, which would explain why the proto-Indian ar? tist wished to fix in stone an instant of pause between two contrasting movements, perhaps anticipating by several thousands of years the canon of Miron. The dance of the god, from Harapp? to the magnificent bronzes of the 12th-14th centuries, expresses the divine Medallion with male figure.

It glorifies the flow of life itself, fluctuating between the two opposite poles of creation and destruction, and finds there a value absolute, motionless, intangible. Instead of standing apart, dreaming of separation from contingencies, Indian thought plunges into the flow of forms from which life arises; it recognises the caducity of the individual, even of the supreme deities, but it intuiti? vely perceives, beyond them, the motionless, undifferentiated principle that animates while transcending them all. And then the sometimes chaotic and disordered movement of some plastic representations acquires a different value, that of the exultant fullness of nature. So strong is this conception, so great and so widely spread, that even when it wishes to express in the st?pa of S?nchi the episodes of the Buddha's several lives, drawing inspi? ration from a religion that sternly rejects all that is earthly, this hymn to life breaks out whenever the tangle of human and animal shapes gives rise to a vaster movement, or when the chisel of the anonymous sculptors dallies indulgently to give relief to the fleshly and flexible graces of the dryads arranged to form an ornamental motif on the sides of the great doors. This search for movement leads to solutions that summarise in a single vision a whole period of time, adding unexpected details to scenes all pervaded by religious immobility; and because of it the vast piles of the me? diaeval temples from Khajur?ho to Sriran gam and K?nchlpuram flower with the flexible forms of women. The rhythm of dance is never forgotten. For though dance never realistically copies anything in nature, yet it appears as the only means of expressing the fundamental reality of the universe, the rhythmic flow of the creative impulse. It is the cosmic dance of Siva, the creator and the destroyer, or the interwoven dance of Visnu on the ocean waves before he initiates his new creation; and even Tantric Buddhism uses the figures of dance in its terrific repre? sentations. This relation between the rhythmic move? ments of the body and creative activity finds expression in the Citras?tra, whose text ad? vises painters and sculptors to acquire a tho? rough theoretical knowledge of dancing, so that they may seize and illustrate a special moment of the creative flow. It is by means of these rhythms that they may express not an absolutely static attitude, but an instant of pause in the fluid course of movement. But, perhaps through foreign influence, the art of India has also given us static images other than those of the Buddha or the Mah? vira in meditation; I mean standing figures presented in a strictly frontal view. This canon of immobility, which in the texts is known by the name of samapadasth?naka, dates back to the first works of the Maurya period (3rd century B.C.), continuing until a fairly late period, though rather rarely found. But, after the earliest examples, the works of this type are characterised by a movement of lines, a sinuosity and tenderness of outline that shows that stiff forms did not appeal to the artist, who generally turned to the vegetable world for inspiration when representing the human limbs. Among the earliest figures of this type we find the famous YaksinI of Dl d?rganj, whose beauty depends not so much 306</page><page sequence="9">on the arrangement of the masses as on the softness of the lines and above all of the fare, shining with the light of extraordinary intel? ligence. We can thus see that through the stu? dy of vegetal forms, which leads to modelling the female form on lines mindful of the fle xuous growth of the liana, Indian art, almost from the start, had mastered a foreign prin? ciple adjusting it to meet the needs of Indian feeling and Indian understanding. And for hundred and thousands of years il has always been so. Indian art, based on the features we have described, attained an extraordinary degree of unity which it has never lost, (though expressing itself in various styles and schools), not even in the periods of inevitable arrest and evolution. Did we so wish, we could follow its history through the successive reactions to foreign influence. Sumerian art, that of Achaemenian Persia, the Hellenism of Alexander, the Iranian influences of the Parthian or Sassanian domination, even the formation of a Greco Roman-Buddhist school in North-West In? dia, or the so-called Dravidian-Alexandrian synthesis which, during the Roman period, can be noted in the monuments of the South, all these did not modify the local genius. Nor was it modified by the first Islamic influences which reached India later on, giving origin to new artistic currents of very high value, which in no way excluded typically Indian works. We thus see that in the most ancient times a quick reaction is always confronting the new forms and the new techniques which are absorbed by the age old Indian traditions un? dergoing a process of assimilation and transfor? mation which at times has the aspect of an inexorable and fatal phenomenon. Indeed, at times the majestic grandeur of some mo? numents, or the elaborate symbolism of works of great aesthetic value, almost lead us to think that Indian art is the prodigious product of the soil itself, expressing its secret forms that the will of man does not succeed in modifying. This capacity to react, this fundamental unity of Indian art are certainly due in part to the strength of tradition and to the religious background to which it owes its origin. But it is above all the spiritual attitude of the whole Indian people, it is the very essence of India that has laid the foundations of the ge? neral features, so to day, to which the for? mulae created by the early artists instinctively adhered. Those formulae were not impove rish,ed by the passage of time, they were only modified by the slow evolution of taste and shapes. Of these general aspects, that reflect a special cosmic vision of the universe, three have greater value than the others: they are the search for movement, the yearning towards all manifestations of life, the symbolic subli? mation of dancing. They are the qualities we have briefly examined. If we turn to sym? bolism, which is the key to an understanding both of the subject and the content of the plastic and pictorial representations and to a grasping of the principles that govern architectural structures, we could easily add innumerable examples. But for our purpose we need only point out that the evolution of Western thought has led us to attribute added value to the symbol, now con? sidered as an autonomous form of knowledge that cannot be eradicated, so deeply rooted is it in the human mind. Symbolic thought is consubstantial with man; it is a kind of phi? losophy built on the most secret foundations of his being, and even Western art is now Limestone statuette of a god (?) or dancer.

This discovery of the value of the symbol, which has been made in various sections of humanistic science and which can already be clearly seen in measuring sciences, affects the appreciation of the West for Indian art, and there can be no doubt that the study of that art has helped to clarify Western views on symbolism. Nevertheless, the aesthetic appraisement of each of the various works of Indian art, though it may benefit considerably by a know? ledge of the matters to which we have drawn attention, undoubtedly rests on values iden? tical to those which determine our appreciation of Western productions. Through the work of the critics the several personalities of the artists rise before us, artists whose names we shall never know but whose human message has been left for us too, painted in the caves or graven on stone or bronze. It is our task to discover that message and appraise it in its entirety, not only for the immediate emotion it arouses in us, but also because it sums up the lofty sentiments of men so distant from us in time and space. The search for this deep-seated value that animates all works of art that are really such, cannot be synthesised nor reduced. It lies at the basis of Indian art; it is a work of criticism and at the same time of reconstruction of a whole world in which art played an essential Female figure from Khajur?ho. part. If therefore we are to speak of it briefly we must refer to it as an inexhaustible and marvellous field of research that awaits us and fascinates us by its very immensity. Here I think it will be advisable to consider the philosophical standpoint Indian thought assumes in relation to the problem of art. A knowledge of this thought will faci? litate the discovery of the more intimate as? pects that inspired the schools and artists of India and we shall be better able to illustrate the various elements that have influenced the historical evolution of Indian art. On the other hand, we shall find the confirmation of the statements we have made and we shall also have the surprise of finding speculations of a truly lofty nature, which perhaps we should never have expected. I must preface my remarks by saying that in this field no systematic work has been written and the enquirer must cull here and there, from the different texts, the material on which to base his theoretic generalizations. Moreover, aesthetic theories have been for? mulated, bearing in mind chiefly literary and dramatic activities, although there is no lack of reference to the other arts, above all for purposes of exemplification. I am not here referring to the texts that enumerate at great length and in detail the iconometric re? lations of the human and the divine figures, similar to those laid down in a different spirit by our Leonardo. We know indeed that their artificial character did not escape the attention of artists and philosophers. They therefore served above all as helps to the craftsmen, and, in the long run, reflected the inferior aspects of artistic activity. These a priori rules laid down for a work of art, just as some moral or religious notions prescribed for human action, or like the liturgical codes regulating the performance of sacrifices, have only a documentary value for Indian aesthe? tics. We should search in vain in them for references to the lirical aspirations that per? vade the loftier creations of that art. The texts we purpose examining vary greatly in type. One of the earliest and most com? plete is the Dhammasamgani (2), a work of the 3rd or 2nd century B.C., corresponding chronologically to the flourishing of Maurya art, then still feeling the Iranian-Hellenistic influences, and to the beginnings of the schools of Bh?rh?t and S?nchi which are at the origin of the great Buddhist art. We shall however follow not so much the text as the comment on it made in his 308</page><page sequence="11">Atthas?linl (3) by Buddhaghosa in the 5th cen? tury A.D. He was the chief exponent of the Cingalese school of exegesis in the Pali lan? guage. His comment is clearer and fuller. In considering the activity of the human mind, which he calls citta, Buddhaghosa draws his examples from pictorial activity. In the substratum of the mind desires remain hidden, but are ready to be transformed into conscious will and therefore into action. Let us take as an example, he says, the work of a painter. When he is painting, he is inspired only by a creative impulse that expresses itself out? wardly in the pictorial representation. He feels the urge to create forms, and this internal state of the mind, made up of the will to create and the intuitive knowledge of that which has to be represented, constitutes the essential features of pictorial art, whose content is given by the inner element, i.e. by the image in? tuitively perceived, which is objectively com? pleted through the harmony of lines and colors. But the mind, which is in constant move? ment, in the very act of creating the work receives new impressions emanating from the work it is creating; and it modifies ? in part consciously, in part unconsciously ? the pri? mitive intuition. Thus the work of art is a direct reflection of the activity of the mind, and though it is something objective, it is above all a spiritual fact. Buddhaghosa even adds that the work is identified with the creative behaviour of intuition, while the ex? ternal form is but an accidental translation of that activity. The doctrine of the Buddhist commentator moreover takes up the whole problem of spi? ritual activity, considered as a steady flow of two components, mental action and the knowledge to which it gives rise. In this flow and through this flow, what we call conscious? ness is made manifest, whose objective reflex is the external object. Evidently none of the external objects can in any way affect the flow of the spirit until it becomes one of its consti? tuent parts. The apparent incompatibility between the constant flow of mental activity and the static nature of the work created is solved through the urge to create, for it is that urge that gives rise to colour and lines, forming the objective representation. There? fore that to which the artist gives external expression is the concrete translation of the image intuitively conceived by his mind, it is therefore the imitation of a state of mind, and Ajanta: female figure to the right of the Bodhisattva Ava lokitesvara Padmap?ni, called the ?Beautiful Bodhisattva?. it is this latter which is, ultimately, the real work of art. We have here a very lofty conception of art which assigns preeminent importance to the inner intuition. And it is easy to deduce from this that Buddhaghosa considers any means valid for obtaining that inner image, which is in his opinion the real work of art, includ? ing the means of mystic concentration that be? long to the technique of yoga (4). A Hindu text discusses this same problem. It is the Sukranltis?ra written prior to the 10th century, by a political philosopher, Su kr?carya. This writer states that the value of a statue representing a god (he considers all profane art as impious) should be sought 309</page><page sequence="12">in the perfection of the act of contemplation that inspired it (5). For it is only when the inner intuition has fully conceived the form to be represented that it is possible to give it material expression. But he goes on to say that, even if during the preliminary stage the artist and the shape for which he yearns form one and the same entity viewed from the mystical standpoint, we only have a true work of art when the form thus conceived is ex? pressed objectively and completely. Unlike Buddhaghosa, this text attributes no absolute value to the original intuition. The same conception is studied again by the Silparatna and the Pancar?tra (6), which dwell on the ability of the artist to produce representations. Perfect intuition is not enough! Every devotee in his meditations may give life to marvellous divine figures within the compass of his own mind. A high degree of technical skill is needed for this interior vision to be fully translated into an objective expression, the only one that is of value. This formal value attributed to the work of art (let us not forget that r?pa, i.e. form, may also mean beauty) partly explains the value of the iconometric canons, the Sastra, which arose, as I have said, to make up, as far as possible, for the deficiencies of craftsmen and minor artists. There is indeed no doubt that the Indian ar? tists were fully aware of the instability of any fixed rules, however ably studied, when faced by the ever changing forms of beauty. The analogy to the rigid liturgical rules does not succeed in saving the validity of this Sastra; and so the sage Sankhar?carya, while labo? riously trying to explain the mystery of beauty 310 Minor divinities carry the Buddha's alms-bowl to heaven (from Amar?vati).</page><page sequence="13">^^^^^^^^^^Hp''' ^f"""" ^ ^j?? ^^^^^| h " ??^h 'f CiA^h I 'i' * :t&amp;3mW^m\^m\\J&amp;*\\\\\\\\ WW\.

And then the philosopher guessed the truth and said: cc These laws, oh Goddes?, are not made for thee; my minute analyses are only of use for the images reserved for reli? gious worship. For infinite are the forms thou clothest thyself in, oh Beauty, and no Sastra can define them ? (7). These last words, eternally true, provide an element of the first importance for the under? standing of Indian art, for they show us that 312</page><page sequence="15">the artists and philosophers could understand the artificial character of certain rules and therefore broke them. There is no doubt that the formulation of the Sastra exercised wide? spread influence, even on such works of art as basreliefs, which did not belong to the cate? gories to which the iconometric rules applied. But it seems clear that the Indian artists with their astonishing genius triumphed over all restrictions placed on them, and created those incomparable masterpieces which find their full theoretical justification in the words addressed by Sankhar?carya to the Goddess. The nobility of the aesthetic theories we have briefly set forth must be apparent to all, and it will be seen how near they are in a certain sense to the positions reached only recently by western thought, and more espe? cially to the positions of Benedetto Croce (8). Nevertheless, were we to judge Indian art by these theories and by some of its works, it would seem to us the product of a tendency to stand aside from reality. We might be led to think that the art of India drew its life only from fictitious imaginations which, while pursuing transcendental aims, lost themselves Stucco head from Taxila with features recalling "Western portraiture. Stucco head from Taxila. The round outlines and the plasiic conception, together with the subject, point to a Roman influence. in the search for halucinations and images which very ancient technique of meditation contributed to create. On the other hand, the foundations on which Indian thoughts on art are based might lead us to think of the many possibilities it possessed, in theory, for becoming a form of abstract art, for the artist worked in confor? mity with a mental prototype, re-thinking and re-creating reality in his own way. This confers importance on the theory of another school, which has as its typical repre? sentative Sri Sankula (9). He considers that the function of art is to imitate nature, al? though the product of this imitation forms a category apart. This means that, although the work of art is the result of imitation, it is something different from nature and has an essence of its own. We will pass over the in? teresting adverse comment of Abhinavagupta (950-1020 A.D.) which is based on the fact that individual emotion is neither imitation nor can be imitated (10). The theory of Sri Sankula is of special interest, as it shows the existence of a theoretical formulary which is not in the least based on the intuition arising from meditation, but considers art in its rela? tion to nature, as did the earlier Western aesthetics which considered even abstractions as an idealisation of nature obtained through an appropriate choice of natural components. 313</page><page sequence="16">Head of girl. Terracotta from Ushkar, Kashmir (Central Museum, Lahore). This theory makes quite dear the reasons that prevented India from being a precursor of abstract art. Indian art lacked the faculty of conceiving forms other than those offered by nature, it lacked the urge to arrive at an absolute form beyond those experienced by the senses and by reason. In Indian works the knowledge of the positive is not used for the creation of new and opposite forms, but only for the attainment of a final purpose which is a work of thought. Taken together, these ideas explain the ex? traordinary vigour of some representations of animals and of others, human and divine, in which symbolism, fully mastered by a quite extraordinary capacity of expression, becomes an almost unperceived factor. This attitude towards nature is clearly expressed in literal y works. It is thus that the poet K?lid?sa re? lates how king Dusyanta wished to paint S? kuntal? when, frightened by a bee, she moved about agitated and graceful, showing herself to him full of life and infinitely desirable. The bee was rendered by the august painter with such skill that those who looked at it tried to brush it off, as though it had been alive. It is the old theme of creative art $o admirable and perfect that it succeeds in iden tifying itself with reality. From ancient Greece to ancient India this idea, so wide-spread until almost our own days, conceives the role of art to be that of imitating nature. Moreover, countless times in the literary works of India, both ancient and modern, the writers argue that the several manifestations of nature can be used as the terms of comparison and the scale of measurement of all forms of beauty. In the Meghad?ta of K?lid?sa, one of the classic authors best known to us, the leading character, turning to the cloud that will bear his message of love to his distant bride, ex? presses himself as follows: (C I seek to satisfy the yearning of my soul by attempting to find the beauty of thy limbs in the beauties of nature, but thou art so beautiful that I cannot succeed. I gaze on the creeping plants to discover the grace of thy forms and of thy movements; I look into the astonished eyes of the deer to discover in them a likeness to thy loving looks; I look at the moon to perceive there the shadow of thy face, at the feathers of the peacock to note their re? semblance to thy hair, and at the dancing ripples on the river that are like thy swift moving eyes. But, alas, I see that all these things are inferior to thy beauty and I can find no resemblance between thy loveliness and that of nature ?. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r '^^Fr^lF^r^H^Hfl^H^^^^^^^^I SarasvatI, the Goddess of Wisdom and Music. 314</page><page sequence="17">Thus K?lid?sa's Yaksa praises his lady above nature herself. Here therefore we have an attitude of mind which is foreign to those forms of mystic me? ditation, to those symbolisms of which we have spoken, and it is precisely to this poetic vision of the world around us that we owe many of the great works of art of India. Now this art appears before us in its full? ness ; fluctuating between the two opposite and co-existing poles. On the one hand the sym? bolical expression of an impersonal truth; on the other an art inspired by a deep feeling of nature and life in their infinitely varied aspects. Fluctuating therefore between heaven and earth. And the genius of the artists always find a style, both vigorous and precise, through which to express the impulses of an imagination which seeks to lose itself in the immensity of the firmament, and which listens to and interprets the rhythm and the beauties of the earth, considered sub specie aeternitatis.

(2) It is the first book of the Abhidhammapitaku, dealing with the classification of the dharmas, i.e. of psychic phenomena and conditions. In its turn the Abhidhamma pitaka is the third part of the Pali Tripitaka which deals with technical, theological and philosophical matters. The Dhammasamgani was published in 1885 by E. M?ller in the collection of the ? Pali Texts Society ? and later on was translated by Rhys Davids. (3) The Attas?lini was published by E. M?ller in 1897. Rhys Davids published another edition and a translation in 1921 (Pali Texts Society). (4) It should be remembered that the artist is often assimilated to the yogin and is also called sadhaka, mantrin, and in other ways which show that the essential feature of artistic activity is, in the view of many, a branch of Yoga.

(9) Sri Sankula, a native of Kashmir, turned his atten? tion mainly to the theatre, drawing however analogies and illustrations from the figurative arts. His theory relates more expecially to the way in which aesthetic experience arises from the work of art, and he affirms that this exp - rience is produced by the objective perception of the work itself. The persistent or fundamental emotional state known as sth?yibh?va, which inspires the work of art and deter? mines its aesthetic value, arises from the imitation of nature. The example of the painted horse, used to explain the value of the interpretation of a given character made by an actor, is quite clear on this subject. He speaks indeed of the fusion of a precise and real knowledge, which has become the property of the mind, with the idea aroused by a work of art. From the recognition of the former through the latter the aesthetic satisfaction arises. Sri Sankula adopted many of the ideas of the Ny?ya system. See about him K. C. Pandey, Comparative Aesthetics, Vol. I. Indian Aesthetics, pp. 35 et seq. (? Chowkamba Sanskrit Series, Studies ?, Vol. II, Banaras 1950). (10) See K. C. Pandey, op. cit., passim.</page></plain_text>
