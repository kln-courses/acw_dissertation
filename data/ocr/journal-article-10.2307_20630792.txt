<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Study of Public Opinion By JANE CLUNIES ROSS* "By far the greatest obstacle to the progress of science and under standing of new tasks is found this, that men despair and think things impossible."?Francis Bacon. There has, perhaps, never been a time more interesting or urgent than the present for an attempt at an exact psychological study of public opinion. We are engaged in a conflict between the totalitarian states' ideals of authority, discipline, and unquestioning obedience to a leader, and the democratic states' ideals of liberty, equality, and service through conviction and willing co-operation. A democracy is directed, in theory, according to the will of the majority of its citizens, who are content to trust the judgment of experts in many matters, but who should be consulted in matters vital to their own daily lives. But how far have we really gone on the road towards the ideal democracy? Do we know, for instance, what proportion of the people is really interested and well-informed on public events, and how many are content to drift without forming well-considered personal opinions? Do we know, in point of fact, where people get their opinions from, or what are the greatest influences in the moulding of tradition, senti ment and belief? How are we to find out? Public opinion can be divided into three categories: (a) Opinions about public events, political and international. (b) Custom, and traditional sentiments, codes of law and be haviour, social institutions. (c) National culture, taste, art, recreation, religion, etc. We have gone a good step farther in democratic self-expression than "L'etaty c*est moi" of Louis XIV and other less frank authoritari ans, but we have set up our own misleading generalizations about national opinion which do not always bear inspection. * Mrs Clunies Ross is Tutorial Lecturer in Psychology at the University of Sydney, and she has recently been engaged on research work at Cambridge University. 2 6 * 43</page><page sequence="2">December, 1939 THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY Take up any newspaper at random, and you find such phrases as "England wishes . . "France will not tolerate . . "Germany denies . . ." "Every Australian believes . . On what evidence are these statements made? Recently a correspondent in the New Statesman and Nation (5/8/39) writes: "You say that Germany is being aggressive? All right, when war breaks out I shall take up a rifle and set out to look for Germany. When I find it I shall shoot it between its corporate eyes . . . but if there is a war you want me to kill Otto Schmidt and Franz M?ller. There would be no need to kill these real persons if the world started in to kill some of its own abstractions." The same muddled thinking goes on when we speak of men and women as a herd, mass, mob or crowd, with an entity conveniently anthropomorphic. For the exact study of national outlook we must begin by ascertaining the individual outlook. What do I think, what does the grocer think, what do Mrs Brown and Dr Jones think? . . . Only by summing up the thoughts of many individuals can we justi fiably talk of discovering the "Voice of the Nation" or "the National Will" or even the "general trend of opinion." Even if we grant that the physical presence of a crowd does in fluence individual thinking, we should not consider the individual as living his life mentally any more than physically in the emotional state of suggestibility possibly generated by the presence of many others. We may grant, also, that the background of social tradition colours our opinion sufficiently to justify a certain amount of generalization about outlook. But the aim of democracy is surely to do full justice to individual, reasoned thinking, within the limits of the community's safety. In the last months we have seen in countries both democratic and totalitarian, governments pursuing on behalf of a nation, policies which affect the life of each citizen. Is this or that policy the expression of the will of the people, or is it the will of a leader, imposed on a people and assured of approval by the skilful moulding of their ideas by some ministry of information or propaganda? This is not a rhetori cal question. It is one to which we are trying to find the answer. All successful leaders of people throughout history have had good work ing rule-of-thumb knowledge of shaping public opinion. In Shakes peare's Julius Caesar Mark Antony's speech over the dead body of Caesar contains practically every trick known to the successful pro pagandist and skilful commercial advertiser for working on the sug 44</page><page sequence="3">THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY December, 1939 gestibility of people not very quick-witted or well-informed. It is an encouragement to emotional thinking in place of rational. To what extent is the "average man's" thinking based on someone else's self-appointed authority? Can we find out? Now there have been many kinds of attempts to discover trends of opinion in communities. The simplest is, of course, the general election or referendum in which one or two clear-cut issues are decided on a Yes-No basis. But from a psychological point of view these do not tell us very much. A man may vote No on a referendum question (e.g. Prohibi tion) for a variety of reasons, such as inclination to conviviality, con sidered conviction, dislike of change, annoyance with the present gov ernment, because his pocket would suffer, or because his wife voted Yes. Until we know why people vote, as well as how, we do not know anything of exact psychological value at all. The thought-pro cesses are of at least equal importance in our study to the end-result. This is perhaps shown just now in the matter of conscientious objectors. These form a small fraction of the community and do not affect the general trend of opinion. If they were in the majority we would presumably not go to war at all. How do they arrive at the conviction that war is wrong? Among the many possible reasons, religi ous sentiment is by no means the only one. Is the belief in pacifism more widespread in Australia in recent years? During the Great War "Public Opinion" was indignantly opposed to conscientious objectors, almost to the point of incompatibility with the belief in freedom of thought. Does our greater social tolerance in many matters now-a-days extend to this one? It is an important question for our democracy, for we may ask if our general educational policy influences the young for or against militarism, or pacificism, or nationalism, whether it crushes or encourages unorthodox thinking, and whether it provides the best basis for future citizenship. Have we the least idea of the answer to any of these questions? If we had, we should be able to direct our educational system with far more confidence than we seem to do at present, towards democratic ideals. Until recent years the task of collecting evidence might have seemed impossible. At the end of last century, the science of anthro pology was establishing itself, and anthropologists were making social surveys of communities, chiefly of primitive peoples remote from civili zation, hoping from the study of the functions of a small group to discover natural laws of human behaviour?in groups, an ambition still far from being realized. But following on this field work came a number of attempts to study in the same way the more complex 45</page><page sequence="4">December, 1939 THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY groups such as small villages and country districts and suburban life in European civilization. Examples of this work are Lynd's Study of Middleton and Dollard's Study of Life in a Southern Community of U.S.A. This work consists in collecting details for a descriptive account of life in a community. The hopeful idea is that if you collect enough and tabulate it you will arrive somewhere at some time. A reward modest enough for such a stupendous task. One must make a definite distinction, however, between the survey of human behaviour in groups, and the survey of human motive and opinion. The former is the anthropologist's work, the latter comes into the province of the social psychologist, of whom more presently. Now the above kind of social survey has its weaknesses. It is im possible to treat every single detail in the daily life of even a small group with equal emphasis. So the surveyor has to take upon himself the selection of what is most important, which gives a bias to any theories deduced from collected facts. Still, it can be interesting and important, if too much theory is not expected from the results. There has been, particularly in the United States of America, a good deal of work done by social psychologists in an effort to gauge trends of sentiment and opinion, and the causes of these in "representa tive" sections of the nation. The value of the various branches of this output varies a good deal. There are three main methods of experi mental field work. It should be mentioned, perhaps, that these are also used with great gusto though hardly with the necessary scientific caution, by advertising firms. (a) The Rating Scale. This is, roughly speaking, a method of assigning marks to each subject under review for conduct, character, intelligence or ability. It is not possible to make this very exact, as the allotting of marks depends on the judgment and personality of the experimenter to far too great an extent. To take a seemingly far-fetched example. One might set out to test some such generalization as "The Esquimaux are not a hasty-tem pered people," by inventing a remark calculated to annoy, and trying it on a cross-section of the community, and allot marks according to the tone of the answer, courteous, cold, haughty, irascible, distressed, belligerent, frenzied and so on. If these results are put in the form of marks up to, say, IO, and the average taken and the results com pared to those of several other nations taken in circumstances as similar as possible, one might not be entirely safe in a generalization, but one 46</page><page sequence="5">THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY December, 1939 would be more on the way to it than one is with most hasty summing up of "national characteristics.,, (The department of Psychology in Cambridge has recently in spired the work of D. Carmichael on a survey of Esquimaux thought processes.) (b) Experiments in the Interplay of Individuals in Groups. There have been a number of attempts to establish colonies or vil lage communities, run on socially experimental lines, from religious groups, such as the Pietists in Philadelphia in 1694, to the various com munistic experiments in the early 19th century, chiefly in England and the United States of America, of which Robert Owen's New Lanark near Glasgow is perhaps the best known, and including John Lane's New Australia in South America in 1893. I think it fair to say that the failure of most of these was due to psychological factors; I also believe that a better knowledge of social psychology might have saved them. But the scientific side of the experi ment was not over-emphasized in them. Lately, chiefly in educational circles, more exact studies have been made in small-group forming. For instance in the United States of America two groups of school chil dren of equal age were trained on democratic and dictatorship lines, respectively, in their school lifq and then let loose on each other and the results noted. Thus, too, it was suggested at one time that certain Australian aboriginal communities should be preserved for the purpose of such study. But while one must sympathize with attempts to keep certain of the drawbacks of civilization from these people, a plan to do so de liberately for such a purpose of experiment has many pitfalls. There are, indeed, two drawbacks to human experiments of this kind. There is some difficulty in making general conclusions about large communities in complex inter-relationships, from the study of small groups in simple social and economic and controlled environment. Also, if the work were too thorough, it might not be fair to the subjects. (c) The Method of the Questionnaire. At the beginning, this method was based on the idea that if you want to know something about a man, the best thing is to ask him, and if possible in a form of question to which he can answer a simple Yes? No?Perhaps. Great improvements have been made in this technique for acquiring information of psychological value. The "straight ques tion" type of questionnaire, however, is used for political, commercial, and other survey purposes. The Gallup enterprise and the New York 47</page><page sequence="6">December, 1939 THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY Tribune, etc., have well-run organizations for ascertaining public opinion in representative cross-sections of the community, and claim to be able'to forecast election results and other matters very accurately. These are called "Snap Surveys" and "Straw Votes," and are very popular just now. Here is a small sample of such a questionnaire taken in Sydney recently by the members of the Australian Mass Observers. Question i. "Do you think Spooner was right in forcing Stevens's resignation ?" Answers received: Yes 143 No 44 Question 2 (with answers after each name) : "Do you think any of the following would make a better Premier than Stevens?" Answers: Heffron Lang Spooner Mair .. Bruxner All None ,. Question 3. "Do you want an election?" Yes no No 84 This information is too limited to have any social value. It is given only to illustrate methods. The age and occupation of each subject are known, and the choice of subjects covers a wide range. This kind of questionnaire is also useful in finding out the demand in given areas for breakfast foods, motor-oil, and other such things j it is found that many people actually enjoy answering them. But as a means of collecting psychological evidence, it has its value only if the defects are recognized and are allowed for. For example, in 1936, the University of Minnesota took a survey to test the effect of economic depression on the lives of people of a certain community. The department in charge of the work drew up several hundred possible questions about daily occupations, family re lationships, budgeting, recreation, emotional reactions, and other mat ters, and these were boiled down to 132. Now it is a great strain to answer even 132 questions about one self accurately, especially to a conscientious person with a limited vocabulary. To do it well would mean many hours' work. The accur 48 72 48 42 33 16 16 42</page><page sequence="7">THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY December, 1939 acy of the answer depends on memory, knowledge, power of self examination, and the physical and mental state at the time of answer ing. The fatigue at the end of such a task might give an emotional bias or over-emphasis to some parts of the survey. In any case it is hard by means of even a comprehensive list of questions to depict a whole social situation. It is dangerous too, to compare answers from different people and places and to take it for granted that they mean the same thing. Then, too, because of the inadequacy of words and the nebulous form of many people's ideas on a subject, answers may be misleading, even if information is not with held or twisted to seem more favourable to the subject. This year, for example, the members of a tutorial class at the University of Sydney were asked to write down in three or four minutes their ideas of the meaning of 'The conscription of wealth/' No two students meant exactly the same thing. Some confessed that while they had used the phrase freely, when they came to define it they could see that they knew nothing at all concrete about the idea, though they all approved of it! This, also shows the great power of suggestibility there may be in a phrase. But undoubtedly, some progress in the exact study of public opinion can be made by this method. By it, if we have patience and enterprise, we can find out something of such matters as the follow ing: (a) How do people form opinions on public events. What social influences are greatest in moulding national outlook? Newspapers ? Politicians ? Educationalists ? (b) What portion of the public is really well-informed about social and political events and what portion is indifferent to larger national problems, economic, ethical, etc. (c) What portion of the public will accept the voice of Auth ority unquestioningly?and which are the most successful citizens, those who do or those who do not? (d) What ideals do you find most prominent among the public, for social progress, etc. What attitude do various people hold to State control etc.? A masterly study of such subjects is to be found in Walter Lippman's book, Public Opinion, which might be called one of the few text books on the subject. But he does not deal with experi mental field-work, nor to any extent do the works on Social Psychology by Freud, McDougall, or others. Of recent years there has sprung up a body of active workers who call themselves Mass Observers. (An account of their early work is 49 D</page><page sequence="8">December, 1939 THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY found in the Penguin Special series, Britain by Mass Observation.) The work was begun in 1937 by Messrs Tom Harrison and Charles Madge. Since then there has been formed in England (as in United States of America), an Institute of Public Opinion. Harrison and Madge gathered a band of observers who made a survey of opinions, sentiments, and behaviour of the British people, with as much exacti tude and correlation in collecting information as possible. These obser vers now number thousands and have acquired a great deal of material from which it must be admitted no human being can resist trying to draw conclusions. The Mass Observers began by winning the confidence of various strangers at all times and places, and asking their opinions on various matters of general interest, from the Munich agreement to the Lam beth Walk. Since the first published results mentioned alone, the technique has made great strides. The following difficulty had to be overcome. Many people, when one asks their opinion, will give one without knowing how or where they came by it. They may even, having committed themselves to it, defend it passionately though in fact they are quite indifferent to the subject. So cunning ruses have to be employed to extract information more or less unawares. I have permission to quote some research done by Mr Walter Hood who came to Australia on a Ruskin College Scholarship this year for the purpose of making such a survey of social conditions and attitudes. He illustrates the weakness of straight out questioning in some work he did during an election campaign in England. He can vassed a district first in the guise of a Labour supporter and then as a Conservative. He took an estimate in the usual way by door to door visiting of the chances of the party he happened to be favouring. The results were as follows: As a Labour supporter, he estimated the probable voting from what he was told in a house to house visitation, as: Employing the same technique but as a Conservative, in the same en vironment, he found the estimate: Is it any wonder that each side is, beforehand, so sure it will win? Again/in an attempt by Mr Hood to learn what the "ordinary Labour Conservative Doubtful 63-5 per cent io-8 per cent 25*7 per cent Conservative Labour Doubtful 71 per cent 13 per cent 16 per cent 50</page><page sequence="9">THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY December, 1939 person" means by happiness, the evidence was obtained by running a newspaper competition in a town, in the form of a questionnaire on the subject. About 380 people sent in replies. Without going into details, it was found that "Knowledge" took a high place among the necessary ingredients for a good life. With the competition results as an excuse, the people who had put this highest on the list were inter viewed and their reasons obtained, a useful matter to educationalists. The Institute of Public Opinion sent out a leaflet asking for sub scriptions for relief in the Spanish war. This was in an attractive form and in simple language. It was circulated among the ?2/10/- to ?3/10/- incomes, in working-class homes. Some days after its distri bution an observer followed it up with personal visits on a good pre text, and collected opinions. Here are a few figures as an example of answers skilfully obtained by avoiding a straight out question at short notice. 84 per cent were not much interested though some were anxious to help. 26 per cent did not understand the points in the leaflet, simple as it was. 47 per cent would not read it. 43 per cent said that charity began at home and England should help its own distressed areas. This again is given to illustrate method rather than conclusion. There is a small society in Sydney, the "Australian Mass Opinion" (or A.M.O.) run, in their spare time, by a few enthusiasts. Their scope does not so far include exact psychological material but is con fined to "snap surveys" of representative opinions of current events. Now, a social survey of public opinion in Australia on the lines indicated could be of value. We are too apt to generalize about the Australian point of view from the utterances of our self-appointed but unauthorized mouthpieces. We are still only in the first step to wards thinking of our democratic nation as a collection of self-deter mining individuals and not as a mass or herd (or as Britannia's daughter, draped in flags). A survey would show where our "education for citizenship" could be improved, where lie the dangers of undue use of suggestibility by propaganda or censorship. It could give, in the absence of much definitely national folk-lore and arts, some idea of whether our Australian environment is moulding a characteristic out look, philosophy of life, international policy, etc. But beyond the scope of this survey, we have a great field of research into the building of opinion and sentiment for the social psychologist, whose work I have scarcely touched on in this article; it must be slow, painstakingly built up from small detailed records, and 51</page><page sequence="10">December, 1939 THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY cautious about drawing conclusions. There may be some who think there are more urgent needs before us just now. But let me make a quotation from a recent book by Walter Lippman, The Method of Freedom. ... In the reconstruction of history, and even in the projection of ideas which have the pretension to make history, there is no easier way to be misled than to forget how absorbing and tenacious is the private life of men . . . for it is in the countless realms of privacy that civilization is carried on. The life of mankind does not stop while great issues are being decided. . . . For it has not been the wisdom of rulers, but the private persistence of man which has carried mankind through the crises of history and has preserved civilization even when institutions have collapsed. The social psychologist who studies public opinion is confronted with many difficulties, not the least of which is the hostility or indiffer ence of "public opinion" to new ideas, not to mention the spending of money on them! and to anything which does not at once pay its way by spectacular results. The field-worker must discipline himself to abandon the customary view of a community as a corporate creature, must throw away dehumanizing abstractions, and generalizations from individuals, and must on the other hand never, in a maze of detail, lose sight of the general biological and sociological patterns of man kind. Above all,' he must, like all scientists, recognize and eliminate if possible, his own personal equation and be concerned less with right and wrong, prejudice and enthusiasm, than with a dispassionate trac ing of cause and effect, even if what he lays bare is not pretty or noble. And out of the research, after long patient beginnings, of record and experiment, should emerge, first, a more accurate estimate of the activities, sentiments and essential needs of national life, secondly, the establishment of definite concrete ideals of democracy instead of vague generalizations and lofty phrases (the coming, in fact, down to "brass tacks"). Thirdly, by the great and growing success in the last half century of psycho-therapy for unbalanced and "difficult" people, it is not too much to hope that we may some day by simple rules of social psychology find out how to produce harmony and serenity, instead of the tangle of conflicting prides and intolerances and stupidities both within and between nations to-day.
