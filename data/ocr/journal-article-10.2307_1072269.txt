<plain_text><page sequence="1">RESPONSES Gerhard Casper* While I generally agree with Professor Henkin's analysis of the allocation of the foreign affairs power, I should like to provide a somewhat different emphasis, voice a disagreement, and finally address myself to a practical suggestion for creating a more effective foreign policy system. In his statement to the Commission, as in his excellent book, Foreign Affairs and the Constitution,' Professor Henkin demon- strates that the great abstraction of separation of powers is only valuable as a starting point in describing the respective roles of Congress and the President in formulating and implementing for- eign policy. Many questions remain unanswered. Some have argued, for example, that the President is the "sole organ" of the federal government for foreign affairs.2 This notion, however, is a fantasy: the actual constitutional arrangement is one of shared res- ponsibilities. While the President does conduct our daily foreign relations, the Congress' war,3 spending,4 and foreign commerce5 powers assure it a continuing involvement in foreign policy formula- tion and implementation as well. On these points Professor Henkin is absolutely correct. However, what he refers to as the "lacunae" of the constitutional blueprint lead him to speculate that the Framers had a limited conception of foreign affairs. I submit that they did not. They fully understood the complexity of foreign affairs, and they fully intended to create a constitutional framework for the conduct of foreign relations. One of the most frequently reiterated cliches about foreign affairs, not embraced by Professor Henkin, to be sure, is that our foreign relations are infinitely more complex now than they were at the time of the nation's founding. I wonder. At the time of the Constitutional *Professor of Law and Political Science, University of Chicago; Referendar, 1961, Ham- burg; LL.M., 1962, Yale University; Dr. iur. utr., 1964, Freiburg.

The Europe of that period was a tangled skein of shifting alliances, dynastic ambitions, incipient revolution, and trade rivalries. In dealing with these problems under the Arti- cles of Confederation, the Framers undoubtedly came to appreciate the complexity of foreign affairs in a troubled world.6 Professor Hen- kin says that he was surprised to find little in the Constitution on the conduct of foreign relations. I would argue that, well aware of the complexities of foreign affairs, the Framers consciously designed the Constitution to deal primarily with matters of foreign relations, defense policy, and foreign commercial affairs.7 Significantly, they chose to grant Congress the dominant role in foreign affairs. They gave it the decisive voice in providing for the national defense and regulating foreign commerce.8 They subjected treaties to the veto of one-third plus one of the Senators.9 To guarantee that Presidents would not make secret deals with foreign powers, they even provided for impeachment, the ultimate deterrent." This clear purpose of the Framers to secure a controlled foreign policy offers a valuable perspective on the questions before the Com- mission. I would argue that we should take these original constitu- tional arrangements seriously. Professor Rostow would reply that the Constitution is better understood not as a document with an unchanging meaning but as an evolving body of law. However, I think there has been a rather large amount of epistemological one- sidedness in the discussion of this question. While it would be un- sound to ignore the historical fact that the Constitution has been adapted by Supreme Court interpretation and governmental prac- tice to meet changing needs, unconstitutional practices cannot be- come legitimate simply by the mere lapse of time. There is no way around the question whether a certain practice is in accord with the basic scheme and purposes of the Framers.

In this regard, Professor Henkin notes that "the character and needs of foreign relations" have shaped the detail of our foreign affairs system, not the constitutional blueprint. I should be more comfortable had he referred to the presumed needs of foreign rela- tions. There have been a great number of unexamined assertions about the modern character of foreign policy, some of which have a hollow ring today. One of the most common of these is the hypothe- sis that only the Executive Branch has the expertise to formulate and implement foreign policy. Senator Church once remarked that Presidents Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson were all reared to this conviction."2 Recent history has cast considerable doubts upon this hypothesis."3 In any event, it has the character of a self-fulfilling prophecy. With the acquiescence of a Congress until recently shying away from its constitutional responsibilities, the President has concluded secret executive agreements, invoked exec- utive privilege to deny access to foreign relations information, and then in turn argued that Congress lacks a proper understanding of foreign affairs. This circular pattern is as unbearable as the remedy is easy. Congress must resist the use of unauthorized executive agreements and the blanket invocation of executive privilege. I agree with Professor Henkin that the President has the power under the Constitution to make executive agreements on purely "executive" matters. However, the circumvention of the Senate's treaty-making role by means of broadly-scoped executive agree- ments remains unconstitutional in spite of the volume and fre- quency of such agreements. Professor Henkin argues that the Presi- dent has the constitutional power to declare policy, make informal commitments and understandings, and reflect general attitudes, all in the daily conduct of foreign relations. It would be foolhardy to quarrel with this assertion if by "informal" he means subject to congressional disallowance through the exercise of the appropria- tional and regulatory powers. But Professor Henkin apparently be- lieves, though he expresses the belief very cautiously, that Congress " McCulloch v.

I respectfully disagree with this implication that the Congress, as a matter of constitutional, as distinguished from international, law, is bound to deliver on the President's undertakings. Given the Framers' grant to Congress of the power over war, commerce, and spending, the President has little authority unilaterally to bind the nation to any- thing. While this disability is perhaps inefficient in the narrow sense that it makes hard and fast international commitments by Presi- dents very difficult, it is written into the constitutional scheme. And it is actually efficient in the broader sense that freely given congres- sional consent will generally be more durable in the long run than consent coerced through some theory of constitutional obligation. In order to carry out its historically important constitutional res- ponsibilities in foreign affairs, Congress must also resist presidential attempts to invoke executive privilege at will. I would argue that such resistance to executive privilege has a textual constitutional sanction. Congress has the plenary power to make laws necessary and proper "for carrying into Execution" the powers vested by the Constitution in any officer of the government.'4 In doing so, Con- gress can even regulate, though not eliminate, presidential powers.'5 It follows that Congress has the power to regulate concerning confi- dentiality in government generally, including executive privilege.' There may be a core of executive privilege which Congress cannot constitutionally impair. Although the concept is never mentioned in the Constitution, the Supreme Court has recently said in United States v. Nixon"7 that "the protection of the confidentiality of presi- dential communications has . . . constitutional underpinnings" in the nature of the executive power.'8 The Court took a balancing approach to the question whether a particular exercise of executive privilege is constitutionally protected, comparing the importance of the particular value that would be frustrated by such exercise.'9 It 4 U.S. CONST. art.

In each case, it must weigh its own need for information to fulfill its constitutional obliga- tions against the needs for secrecy in national security affairs20 and confidentiality of presidential communications. Where the congres- sional and judicial balance will be struck will depend in part on the manner in which Congress safeguards the confidentiality of infor- mation it receives. But Congress should be able to prevent the more arbitrary assertions of executive privilege that characterize the pres- ent foreign affairs system. Thus, simply by repudiating the use of broad executive agree- ments and demanding the information it needs, Congress can begin to perform its constitutional role in the conduct of foreign relations. I am, therefore, in complete agreement with Professor Henkin's re- luctance to engage in constitutional surgery.21 Constitutional amendments are simply unnecessary if Congress takes these and other initiatives. In spite of Professor Rostow's criticism of what he refers to as constitutional fundamentalism, I would reaffirm the basic system established in 1787. In only one minor respect, I think, should we consider a system change. The need for this has been caused not so much by changing times as by our own constitutional amendment in another area. In giving the Senate a special role in confirming treaties without House approval, the Framers' view was that Sena- tors would be elder statesmen performing an advisory service to the President. Since 1913, however, the Senators, like the members of the House, have been popularly elected. Given this constitutional " There is dictum in Nixon that suggests greater weight to claims of executive privilege where its exercise would protect this need for secrecy in matters of national security. Id. at 706-07. 21 I do, however, take issue with Professor Henkin's remarks that changing to a parliamen- tary system would not give the Congress more information and authority in the realm of foreign affairs. I would submit that the prime minister in a parliamentary government, despite his majority status, is subject to informal restraints requiring him to consult with parliamentary colleagues for their viewpoints. The foreign policy initiatives of the coalition government in Germany of Social Democrats and Free Democrats, for example, could not have succeeded without intensive prior consultations with the party leadership-which is for the most part identical with the parliamentary leadership. And in the case of such a major policy approach as Ostpolitik, the Brandt government sought support from the opposition as well. Thus the parliamentary system would certainly help to achieve informally what Profes- sor Ehrlich has suggested the War Powers Resolution, Pub. L. No. 93-148, 87 Stat. 555 (1973), has done more formally-force the executive to consult with the Congress at early stages of the foreign policy formulation process.</page><page sequence="6">782 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 61:747 change, and also the important legal consequences of treaties, Con- gress might consider a constitutional amendment allowing House participation in the treaty ratification process.22 Nevertheless, with this one minor exception, Congress should not tamper constitution- ally with the foreign affairs framework originally established by the Framers. In conclusion, let me suggest what Professor Henkin would refer to as a sub-constitutional improvement in our present system for conducting foreign policy. As I have noted, part of Congress' consti- tutional responsibility to formulate foreign policy arises from its power to authorize programs and appropriate funds for the conduct of foreign relations. Today, however, the appropriations process is generally characterized by "incrementalism." Congress examines executive budget requests each fiscal year with a presumption that the appropriations for the preceding year are still justified; the Ex- ecutive Branch need only justify requests for additional funds.23 Unfortunately, Congress takes this annual, incremental approach not only when appropriating funds but also when originally author- izing programs.24 Especially when employed at this authorization stage, the incremental approach deprives the Congress of any seri- ous voice in the foreign policy process (as well as the domestic one). Switching from an annual to a long-term system of authorizations would remedy this congressional inadequacy. The substantive con- 22 Arguably Congress has authority to continue the present system of congressionally approved executive agreements with the scope and force of treaties. 23 See generally A. WILDAVSKY, THE POLITICS OF THE BUDGETARY PROCESS (1964); Lindblom, The Science of "Muddling Through, " 19 PUB. AD. REV. 79 (1959). For a standard criticism of incrementalism, see C. SCHULTZE, THE POLITICS AND ECONOMICS OF PUBLIC SPENDING (1968). 24 See Hearings on the Federal Fiscal Year as It Relates to the Congressional Budget Process Before the Joint Comm. on Congressional Operations, 92nd Cong., 1st Sess. 129 (1971) (testimony of former Budget Director Charles L. Schultze): My first recommendation would be to eliminate the practice of annual authoriza- tions. At the present time such major areas as defense procurement, construction, and R. &amp; D., space, atomic energy, National Science Foundation, OEO, and the Coast Guard are subject to annual authorizations. . . . It seems to me that authorization committees should be engaged in basic evaluation and review of Federal programs. Each program literally cannot be carefully reviewed from the ground up each year. Rather, a cycle of evaluation and review could be undertaken with perhaps 3-year authorizations, and with a part of an agency or a major program area receiving atten- tion each year. Thus in every 3-year cycle an authorizing committee would have com- pleted a review of the programs under its jurisdiction . . . . Such a practice would achieve, I believe, the desirable goal of focusing attention on long-term trends and results. But see U.S. CONST. art. I, ? 8, cl. 12.</page><page sequence="7">1975] Foreign Policy and the Constitution 783 gressional committees could use such authorization hearings as an occasion for the comprehensive review of governmental policies.25 Congress should conduct this comprehensive review without regard to the present artificial distinction between foreign and defense pol- icy. It might even be advisable to combine the expertise of the foreign affairs and defense committees for reviewing long-term au- thorizations by establishing joint subcommittees along lines which make a multi-faceted policy review possible.26 I realize, of course, that even these modest proposals threaten powerful and established congressional and executive interests. But, to fulfill its mandate to create a more effective system for the con- duct of foreign relations, the Commission must be willing to chal- lenge these interests. n My approach here is in sharp contrast to that of Professors Henkin and Falk, who argue instead that Congress should review foreign policies through Senate confirmation hearings. The Senate, to be sure, does possess the constitutional ability to review foreign policy in such a setting, since it can withhold confirmation of an official for any reason whatsoever. Still, review in the context of nomination hearings would be exceedingly unwise. The confirmation question primarily involves issues of individual personality and qualifications totally unre- lated to issues of long-term foreign policy. Linking policy considerations to an individual's fitness for a particular post could hamper Senate attempts to formulate foreign policy objec- tively. 26 Many of these budgetary recommendations may be realized in the wake of the recently enacted Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-344, 88 Stat. 297, codified at 31 U.S.C.A. ?? 1301 et seq. (Supp. 1975).

It is thoughtful and thought provoking. I do have doubts about some of his views concerning the inten- tions of the Framers of the Constitution regarding foreign affairs, but I have none about his basic characterization of the current situation. I agree completely that constitutional amendments are not in order. I agree further that the basic problem is one of atti- tude-the need for a more cooperative attitude on the part of both the Executive Branch and the Congress. Our Constitution mandates a separation of powers, but not an adversary approach by each of those powers vis-a-vis the other. Having worked in the State De- partment, I know that many in the Department too often view Con- gress as an adversary. Friends on the Hill tell me that the view from there is no different. Attitudes cannot be changed by legislative or executive mandate. But some steps, I think, can and should be taken. I suggest them as a supplement to those proposed by Professor Henkin. As a lawyer and law teacher concerned with international affairs, I am particu- larly troubled by the frequent failure of those in foreign policy- making positions to bring issues of international and domestic law to bear on their decisions. Other fields may be equally neglected, but I will use law as the example since it has particular relevance to this discussion of the constitutional dimensions of foreign policy- making. Three approaches seem promising-one by the Executive Branch, one by the Congress, and one by the public. I. One of the most troublesome gaps within the foreign-policy bu- reaucracy is the lack of what has been called "multiple advocacy" before the President and the Secretary of State.'

In fact, of course, those issues are decided by many people in the State Department, the Defense Department, and elsewhere. All too often, unfortunately, different perspectives on a particular prob- lem are blurred in the bureaucratic process of preparing the found- ation for a particular decision. President Roosevelt developed a staff of advisers on whom he could rely to raise opposing positions and to maintain those positions until the issue reached his desk. The clashes between Harold Ickes and Harry Hopkins are a prime example. Similarly, former Secretary of State Dean Acheson stressed the extent to which President Truman encouraged officials to bring their differing views to him for resolution. None of the existing structural arrangements in the Executive Branch promote such multiple advocacy concerning foreign policy. The Legal Adviser to the State Department, for example, is respon- sible for considering the legal implications of foreign-policy deci- sions. But he is also, and primarily, charged with being the lawyer for the Department-for defending, in legal terms, its ultimate pol- itical judgment, whatever that may be. A variety of approaches might be suggested for meeting this prob- lem. In my view, the most promising would be not a new office or other formal mechanism to promote debate from differing perspec- tives-a devil's advocate or a new International Law Adviser-but rather a conscious policy to encourage that debate. If, for example, the State Department Legal Adviser, as a matter of publicly an- nounced policy, were responsible for assuring that advocates within his office-or, if necessary, outside it-developed the strongest pos- sible legal arguments for conflicting positions, I am certain that the Executive Branch would benefit from a fuller debate on difficult problems. In some situations, this adversary process might involve only two sides; more often, numerous options could be developed. I believe that such a practice would promote reasoned analysis of legal positions in a way that is unlikely without adversary pres- sures.2 2 The advantages of multiple advocacy arrangements are not, of course, limited to lawyers or legal matters involving foreign policy. International trade issues, for example, can be sharpened and clarified by a clash of economists with different views. The same is true of experts in other fields.</page><page sequence="10">1975] Foreign Policy and the Constitution 787 II. It is, I believe, even more important that new governmental ar- rangements be encouraged outside the Executive Branch. As a practical matter, these must be legislative arrangements, since there is little likelihood of substantial involvement by the judiciary. What can Congress do to encourage the development of sound foreign policy? Perhaps most important, it can widen and sharpen the debate on what United States policy is and what it should be. Whatever arrangements are designed to encourage multiple advo- cacy within the Executive Branch, it is likely that most foreign policy decisions there will not be subject to a full adversary debate. If the Congress is given the facts of a situation-and spends the time to understand them-productive debate is much more likely. In my own view, the greatest single failure in Congress concerning foreign policy is lack of preparation-too many seem unwilling to spend the time to learn what is happening. Some steps can be taken to encour- age that process. I use one as an example. In 1973 Congress adopted-over the President's veto-the War Powers Resolution.3 President Nixon stated in his veto message that two key provisions in the Resolution were "clearly unconstitu- tional."4 More than two-thirds of the Congress obviously disagreed, and the current status of those provisions is thus unclear. But an- other section in the Resolution has particular relevance here, al- though it received little attention in the public debates and no one questions its constitutionality. Within 48 hours after deploying armed forces in foreign hostilities, the President must now submit a report on the circumstances and justification of the intervention, including a legal analysis.5 Pub.

But precisely for that reason, the requirement should have a useful impact. The need for justification to support a decision should be a strong incentive for a broader analysis of the impact of that decision than might otherwise be made. By requiring those in the Executive Branch to articulate the basis for an action, and to defend that basis, the Resolution will encourage them to think through their decisions more fully. In my view, Congress allows the Executive Branch to escape with too little serious and sustained justification of its foreign-policy de- cisions. The Executive is seldom required to articulate the basis for its judgments in a way that involves reasoned elaborations from basic principles. That process can and should be encouraged by Congress, and the War Powers Resolution is an important step for- ward. I hope there will be others. III. Finally, its seems to me that there are ways to encourage more public involvement in matters of foreign policy than has been true over the last decade. In the first 15 years or so after World War II, a wide variety of influential organizations developed around the country to study international affairs and to promote bipartisan support for United States foreign policy. Sadly today, most of those organizations seem frayed around the edges-irrelevant to the real business of foreign affairs. Some are seen as guided by an aging establishment of a former era, others as worn-out remnants of that era. A number of approaches are possible to encourage more concern about foreign affairs on the part of the public. The prime requisite, of course, is an Executive Branch that cares about the matter.

I hope it is also true of many in Congress. There are no concen- trated political pressures brought to bear on most congressmen con- cerning most foreign-policy issues. Neither the Senate Foreign Rela- tions Committee nor the House Foreign Affairs Committee feels any particular obligation or desire to promote public debate on most foreign-policy issues. The role of the former toward the end of the Vietnamese War is a prime and significant exception. That role shows how much can be done by those in Congress-when they choose to act. I close with the hope that the exception will soon become the rule.</page><page sequence="13">Richard A. Falk* Like my colleagues on the panel, I agree with most of Professor Henkin's judicious formulations on the difficult matters before this Commission. I also feel that Professor Henkin exhibits a commenda- ble respect for the practical limits on reformist impulses. My com- ments will therefore be confined to a discussion of two important issues upon which my views differ somewhat from those expressed by Professor Henkin - the relevance of international law to the process of formulating foreign policy and the role of unauthorized actors in its execution. Professor Henkin fails, in my opinion, to stress adequately the importance of international law in the formulation of foreign policy. It is in the interests of the United States that legal constraints be taken as seriously in international relations as they are in domestic affairs and that violations of these constraints be viewed as devia- tions from the faithful exercise of public responsibility expected from members of the executive bureaucracy. Over the past century the United States has taken a leading role in the development of international rules and procedures designed primarily to restrict the discretion of national governments to use force to achieve their for- eign policy goals.' Compliance with international law governing the use of force can be one of our most important assurances that the foreign policy process will not get out of control the way it has over the past decade, in Indochina and elsewhere. A net appraisal of what we have done during this period in violation of our interna- tional legal obligations indicates that we have damaged the fabric of our domestic society without in any sense furthering legitimate national interests abroad.2 It is therefore essential that a legal framework be created within which we may systematically bring international law to bear on the formulation of foreign policy. This might be facilitated by Professor * Albert G. Milbank Professor of International Law and Practice, Princeton University. B.S., 1952, University of Pennsylvania; LL.B., 1955, Yale University; S.J.D., 1962, Harvard University. I President Wilson's important role in the creation of the League of Nations and later American efforts to secure the adoption of the United Nations Charter are but two important examples of the assumption of this responsibility. 2 Of course, the range and character of "legitimate national interests" is a matter of controversy. I would exclude from their scope interference by forcible means in the internal affairs of foreign societies undertaken to assure the retention or acquisition of governmental control by elements deemed "friendly" to the United States. 791</page><page sequence="14">792 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 61:747 Ehrlich's recommendation that the role of the legal adviser to the Secretary of State be made more effective, perhaps by institution- alizing his access to relevant policy-making arenas. For example, the legal adviser might be made a member ex officio of important decisionmaking groups, such as the National Security Council, which deal with problems likely to have international legal implica- tions. However, other steps should also be taken to assure that our government takes international legal constraints seriously in its for- mulation of foreign policy. One such step would be the creation of a non-partisan post which would function, in effect, as an Attorney General for International Affairs. The creation of such a position, insulated from the electoral process, would be an important advance in bringing the law to bear on foreign policy decisions and would be an influential example for other countries.3 Similarly, it would be helpful to include international lawyers on relevant congressional committee staffs. Perhaps a congressional unit corresponding to the legal adviser's office in the State Depart- ment could be established. Only with such an expert resource facil- ity can Congress properly consider the international legal dimen- sions of legislative matters and effectively challenge executive ac- tion which it believes violates international law. It would also be desirable to inquire about views on international law at confirmation hearings for appointees to major foreign policy positions.4 Such hearings could routinely include questions about the appointee's attitudes concerning the nature of our international legal obligations. This could be particularly important where the nominee has previously taken positions that have not accorded with the interpretations of international law generally held by members of the Senate. Merely forcing appointees to confront these questions would sensitize them to an important class of issues and might thereby affect the way in which they discharge their duties. The Commission should also consider ways to weave into existing notions of public service the idea of accountability for adherence to international obligations, according such accountability explicit 3 For further elaboration, see Falk, Law, Lawyers, and the Conduct of American Foreign Relations, 78 YALE L.J. 919 (1969). 4 I would require such a confirmation process at the very least for the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. Such a process would also lessen the problem posed by such a position as an unauthorized foreign policy actor, as discussed in text following note 14 infra.</page><page sequence="15">19751 Foreign Policy and the Constitution 793 preference over bureaucratic virtues of loyalty and obedience. The Watergate experience has illuminated the manifold dangers in the domestic sphere of blind obedience to superior orders. We have also entered into a time when, even as a matter of domestic law and policy, we can no longer tolerate having officials implement our for- eign policy on the basis of orders which are illegal by international standards and norms. After World War II we did not permit German and Japanese officials to hide their roles in implementing illegal and immoral international policies behind a defense of superior orders.5 Even less should we wish to grant such a shield of immunity to our own officials.6 To ensure that our foreign affairs bureaucracy will be responsive to international legal constraints, the Commission should recommend the enactment of two types of accountability statutes. One type would assure that executive officers provide Con- gress with a full disclosure of their activities, and the other would provide remedies against policies which violate international law. Such statutes would bring the Nuremberg tradition to bear on bu- reaucratic activities. The Executive Branch thus needs institutional changes to assure its adherence to the constraints of international law. Although the process of foreign policy formulation and implementation requires that such changes focus on the Executive Branch, some improve- ments within Congress are also necessary. The current view that Congress is free to pass legislation that violates prior international legal obligations of the United States7 should be repudiated. We should follow the lead of France8 and West Germany9 in affirming the priority of international legal obligations over conflicting domes- tic statutes. This Commission should realize that in the interdepen- dent world in which we live,'0 the well-being of our own society depends to an increasing degree upon the creation of an interna- tional framework of law, order, and justice.

The second issue which I would like to address concerns the for- eign policy role of actors not contemplated by the constitutional system. One prominent example of constitutionally unauthorized and internationally illegal activity is the Central Intelligence Agency's program of covert operations within foreign societies." We need to reexamine the propriety of the CIA's foreign covert opera- tions and to ensure congressional participation in that reexamina- tion process.' We now have an invisible government which often operates in a manner not even grasped by the visible government. An amusing but alarming example of this can be seen in conversa- tions between former White House aide H.R. Haldeman and CIA Deputy Director Vernon A. Walters.'3 It was obvious in these con- " For an analysis of the CIA's covert operations from the perspective of international law, see Falk, CIA Covert Action and International Law, 12 SocIETY, March/April 1975, at 39. 12 Hopefully, progress on this front will result from the combined efforts of the presidentially-established Rockefeller Commission, see Exec. Order No. 11,828, 40 Fed. Reg. 1219 (1975), and the independent inquiry of a select Senate committee, see S. Res. 21, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. (1975), passed without amendment, 1 CCH CONG.

Mr. Haldeman said that the bugging of the Watergate was creat- ing a lot of noise, that the opposition was attempting to maximize this, that the FBI was investigating this and the leads might lead to some important people, and he then asked Mr. Helms what the Agency connection was. Mr. Helms replied quite emphati- cally that there was no Agency connection and Mr. Haldeman said that nevertheless, the pursuit of the FBI investigation in Mexico might uncover some CIA activities or assets. Mr. Helms said that had told Mr. Gray on the previous day . . . that there was no Agency involvement, that none of the investigations being carried out by the FBI were in any way jeopardizing any Agency activity. Mr. Haldeman then said: Nevertheless, there is concern that . . . this investigation in Mexico, may expose some covert activity of the CIA, and it has been decided that General Walters will go to . . . Acting Director Gray, and tell him that the further pursuit of this investigation in Mexico . . . could jeopardize some assets of the Central Intelligence Agency. Mr. DASH....

I had been</page><page sequence="17">1975] Foreign Policy and the Constitution 795 versations that Walters thought it plausible that he himself might not know what the CIA was doing. As a result, he could not know whether or not Haldeman was bluffing in his attempts to influence CIA action. Another constitutionally unauthorized actor of increasing import- ance is the multinational corporation. The influence of the MNC has been demonstrated in contexts as dissimilar as the recent ITT intervention in Chilean domestic politics and the current concern over the adequacy of crude oil supplies for the United States in the event of national emergency. It was evident that the multinational corporation was an important unauthorized foreign policy maker during the recent fuel shortage."4 The proper response to the emergence of unauthorized actors lies, in the first instance, in requiring increased information and disclo- sure on all fronts. American-based or American-controlled multina- tional corporations, for instance, should be required to report fully and openly on any of their operations which have implications for United States foreign policy. The President's principal foreign pol- icy adviser should also be subject to these disclosure requirements. Another advantage of requiring confirmation for such an official is that it allows Congress to gain access to the foreign policy process through committee questioning, which was nearly impossible be- tween 1968 and 1972. When a President shifts the locus of foreign policy formulation from the State Department to an unauthorized actor on his own staff, he significantly undermines the effective- ness of the constitutional checks and balances for foreign policy making. Congress should therefore set guidelines restricting this kind of bureaucratic evasion. Notions of executive privilege should not be allowed to preclude congressional scrutiny. In general, Congress must be much more vigilant in insisting on full information and in countering unsubstantiated and unnecessary claims of secrecy. All too often such claims prove to be attempts to shield unpopular policies from public scrutiny within the United with the Agency approximately 6 weeks at the time of this meeting. I found it quite conceivable that Mr. Haldeman might have some information that was not available to me.

This kind of secrecy does not contribute to legitimate na- tional security, but rather frustrates the workings of democracy. Besides Professor Henkin's suggested correctives for the abuse of secrecy, other steps should be taken to control the role of unauthor- ized actors in foreign affairs. In particular, Congress should set spe- cific and explicit limits on the foreign policy roles of such actors. The CIA, for example, should be restricted to information-gathering activities."5 Overseas burglaries of the Ellsberg variety carried out by the CIA in violation of foreign law should not be sanctioned by the United States government, any more than such burglaries are permitted within this country.'6 Coupled with an increase in the extent of disclosure, such specifications would restore the functions of foreign policy formulation and implementation to constitution- ally authorized actors.

Rostow* Except for one point I shall take up later, I generally agree with Professor Henkin's explanation of how our foreign policy process developed under the Constitution. Rather to my surprise, however, I find that I agree somewhat less with his specific recommendations to the Commission. Professor Henkin portrays the Constitution as a process of tension and growth dominated by the response of our institutions to experi- ence. For me, this is an altogether congenial perspective. In the realm of foreign policy, the constitutional process became vivid, and intense, during the first five administrations after 1789, when the United States had to deal with problems raised for us by the great European war following the French Revolution. As Professor Casper observes, these problems were as difficult as any the nation has had to face - as difficult politically, and as difficult constitutionally. During this period, Professor Henkin rightly notes, the Constitution which had been sketched in the document of 1787 became the living Constitution we know. As problems arose, they were solved in the way in which any legal system grows, in response to experience. I do not mean to suggest that these responses of the Constitution to reality represented heretical deviations from something that could be called the "original intention." The Presidents, Secretaries of State, and members of Congress of that time knew far more about "original intention" than we know, or can ever possibly learn. What I do mean is that the growth of the law occurred, as it always occurs, through the application and accommodation of general policies- sometimes in conflict - to the nature of things, and the functional capacity of institutions. The growth of our constitutional law of foreign relations, like the growth of every other branch of our law, was the result of solving policy problems through procedures which applied, and reconciled, the relevant goals of the Constitution. The main point of difference between Professor Henkin and me is one of jurisprudence. When Professor Henkin refers to the original intention of the Founding Fathers, he always starts his constitu- tional analysis with the language of the document. I much prefer to approach and read the words in their full policy context. * Sterling Professor of Law and Public Affairs, Yale University; A.B., 1933; LL.B., 1937, Yale University. The author served as Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs from 1966 to 1969. 797</page><page sequence="20">798 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 61:747 Professor Henkin wonders, for example, whether the Founding Fathers thought the Constitution would last. In compelling prose that still dominates our law, John Marshall wrote that ". . . [W]e must never forget that it is a constitution we are expounding[] ... a constitution intended to endure for ages to come. . . ."' By this, the great Chief Justice meant three things, I believe. First, the Constitution must grow and be flexible. Second, all parts of the Constitution should be read together; they reflect different aspects of a single system. Third, the Constitution embodies the principle of continuity as well as that of change. Unlike Professor Henkin, Chief Justice Marshall never began his analysis of constitutional problems with the language of the Constitution. He started with its Grand Design - with his vision of the nature of our society, and its abiding goals - using the particular wording of the written docu- ment only to confirm his analysis. A further example may help bring out the jurisprudential differ- ence between us. Professor Henkin suggests, at least, that the Founding Fathers intended Congress to be the dominant force in making and conducting foreign policy, with the Senate as an Advi- sory Council, conferring with the President at all stages of the treaty-making process. I do not believe that was the original concept of Congress' general role in making foreign policy or of the Senate's role in making treaties. I speak with great confidence, because I am sure that I do not know, and that no one else knows, exactly what the intention of the Founding Fathers was on these matters. But the experience of President Washington teaches us a great deal. It cer- tainly establishes that the Senate simply cannot have a role of equality, or of continuous oversight, in making treaties, because it is a Senate, not the responsible Executive agency. The Senate did not even have a chair for President Washington; the members did not know where he should sit in consulting with them. In any event, it is bad jurisprudence to suppose that we should be bound in a straitjacket by original intention, even if we could discover it. Original intention is an important element in the evolu- tion of constitutional law, but constitutional law, like every other branch of our legal system, is a process of living growth. Preoccupa- tion with "original intention" leads to a kind of fundamentalism which to me is the antithesis of wise law. I McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 407, 415 (1819).</page><page sequence="21">1975] Foreign Policy and the Constitution 799 If we apply Chief Justice Marshall's method of analysis to the relationship between the President and Congress in the formula- tion and execution of foreign policy, we see that a Grand Design does indeed exist. It stems from the basic decision to have a President, one of the most important creations of the document of 1787, against the background of our experience with the Articles of Confederation, and our unsuccessful attempt to govern the country through con- gressional committees. Under the Constitution, both the President and Congress have foreign policy powers. Professor Henkin suggests that this constitutional procedure for conducting foreign policy is inefficient and ineffective. Considering our concern for democratic responsibility, and the necessities of the distinct functions Con- gress and the President must perform, our present system is the most effective and efficient system we can possibly have. It may not be as efficient, conceivably, as one in which the President has sole power in foreign affairs. But we do not want such a system. The dominant principle of our constitutional order is that expressed in Justice Brandeis' great dissent to which Professor Henkin refers.2 We separate foreign policy functions in order to maintain demo- cratic control and prevent the possibility of tyranny. Madison was correct when he said that the essence of the idea of the separation of powers is not separation at all, but a sharing of powers.3 The system cannot work and never works unless there is a minimal de- gree of cooperation between the Presidency and Congress. I do not agree with Professor Henkin's account of the modern relationship between Congress and the Presidency. Congress today is neither a rubber stamp nor a weak member of the constitutional system of shared power. Congress is not bound to uphold all the commitments the President makes in the course of his diplomacy. We know that it does not always do so. The notion that Congress is a passive tool of the President is contrary to everything I have read on the subject, and everything I myself witnessed and experienced when I was in the government. I spent at least a third of my time, and Secretary Rusk estimated that he spent half his time, consult- ing with members and committees of both houses of Congress. Those consultations were friendly and courteous, but they were also intensive and searching. Our Congress is the strongest parliamen- tary body in the world. It is strong, in my view, precisely because 2 Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 293 (1926). 3 See THE FEDERALIST No. 47 (J. Madison).</page><page sequence="22">800 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 61:747 the Executive and the legislative functions are separated, and because the Congress must therefore take independent and responsible positions on major problems of policy. The principle of the separation of powers leads me to disagree with Professor Henkin's suggestion of a "package deal" involving greater cooperation between the President and Congress in making and carrying out policy. If one feature of our Constitution is clear, it is that the plan of our government is not parliamentary. The President and Congress are elected separately, by different con- stituencies, and for different terms. The Grand Design of the Constitution requires a certain separateness between them. As Article I, Section 6 makes clear, no person holding appointive office can be a member of either House. This provision does not prevent members of the Senate from serving on important inter- national delegations, for example. But it does mean that a distance must be kept. We do not want to transform the President into a Prime Minister. I should oppose a constitutional amendment to permit such a development, if that is what Professor Henkin's obscure suggestion of a possible constitutional amendment implies, despite his disclaimer. Professor Henkin raises the issue of Congress' delegation of some of its power to the President. I try to avoid using the word "delega- tion" in this way. There are some instances of true delegation be- tween Congress and the Presidency in the field of foreign affairs. The President's discretion to change tariffs is a good example; only a statute could vest such authority in the President.4 However, in most cases a more accurate description is that a statute combines the overlapping powers of the Presidency and of Congress. In such instances, there is no delegation, but a pooling of the respective powers of the Presidency and of Congress. Thus in the Tonkin Gulf Resolution,5 the Formosa Resolution,6 and the Middle East Resolu- tion,7 for example, language was carefully chosen to indicate that Congress and the President were making separate and also joint decisions, each exercising its own authority. No one attempted to 4 19 U.S.C. ? 1336 (1970). 5 Pub. L. No. 88-408, 78 Stat. 384 (1964). 6 Ch. 4, 69 Stat. 7 (1955). Pub. L. No. 85-7, 71 Stat. 5 (1957).</page><page sequence="23">1975] Foreign Policy and the Constitution 801 draw a line marking the exact boundaries between the presidential zone and the congressional zone. As to recommendations for improving our foreign policy system, I agree with Professor Henkin that we need above all a fresh spirit, a new attitude, and a renewal of responsible cooperation between Congress and the Presidency. This spirit is essential if we are to recover from the wounds to the foreign policy process incurred in the course of the Korean and Vietnam Wars. In stressing the import- ance of cooperation, we may learn from the example of the recent Watergate experience, which I consider a tremendous vindication of the health and strength of our constitutional instincts. In the spirit of our national response to Watergate, all of us should renew our resolve to conform to the rules of individual ethical re- sponsibility without which democracy cannot hope to survive. Of course it is unlikely that the convenient habits of evasion and com- promise which characterize our public life will disappear com- pletely. But unless a substantial number of our leaders within the academic community, the media, and the government show cour- age, character, and a willingness to accept reality, the Watergate experience will have been in vain. This Commission should ap- proach its task determined to respect reality, no matter how un- pleasant it may be. The first specific issue I should like to address in this perspective is the alleged usurpation of Congress' war power by the President. Professor Henkin refers to the widely-held belief that in the Viet- nam affair the rules of constitutional balance were somehow vio- lated. That popular thesis is a myth. There was no presidential usurpation of Congress' war power in either Vietnam or Korea. Un- less we confront and analyze that fact now, with the advantage of four or five years' perspective, we shall miss the true issues involved in the work of this Commission. In the Korean War, and to a much greater extent during the war in Vietnam, we experienced naked political irresponsibility. First, the President and Congress, acting together in a constitu- tional mode that goes back to the time of Washington, made a series of decisions involving us in the wars. Later, when the wars became unpopular, many of the congressmen who had voted and voted and voted for them suddenly began to say that they were all the Presi-</page><page sequence="24">802 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 61:747 dent's fault. They claimed that the President had involved the country in war through stealth and concealment. They argued that the difficulties were the result not of human mistakes in carrying out policies duly authorized and pursued, but rather of some struc- tural imbalance in the Constitution. These representatives told their constituents, "The President has stolen our clothes while we were swimming; we have never really authorized this Presidential war." Then, having created the myth of presidential usurpation, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution8 to cure the imaginary disease. These events have had a significant effect on the spirit of coopera- tion between the Executive and Congress. When the Executive Branch deals with congressmen and senators who continue to vote for a war and then say, "There's no one here but us chickens" after the war becomes unpopular, a mood of suspicion develops which is rather hard to allay. I personally have dealt with congressmen and senators about Vietnam, often reminding them that the Adminis- tration had long been trying to achieve goals which they had recom- mended in political speeches - reconvening the Geneva Confer- ence, for example. Typically, their response was, "I know that, but you must remember that I have to be elected in my district. The President has to do what must be done. I must take care of my reelection." In short, a great many men slithered off the deck when the going got rough. This is simply a fact, not a reproach, something that happens in life. It is the ultimate reason why the War Powers Resolution and other structural remedies we have been considering are so unrealis- tic and unreal. President Johnson was very conscious of President Truman's experience in Korea and of the political fact that Korea became "Truman's War." President Truman did not seek the sup- port of a formal congressional resolution.9 President Johnson had the advantage of the SEATO Treaty,10 which is almost never men- tioned nowadays, either by the President or by congressional lead- ers, the Tonkin Gulf Resolution," and a number of other congres- 8 Pub.

This experience is what President Johnson had in mind when he observed, "I knew that if I wanted Congress with me at the crash landing, they had to be with me at the take-off. But I forgot about the availability of parachutes."' The problem of harmonizing presidential and congressional au- thority in the field of foreign affairs is not institutional or constitu- tional, but human and political. It cannot be solved by constitu- tional amendments, by statutes, or by more institutionalized proce- dures of consultation. These would simply make harmony harder to achieve. The result everyone wants can be obtained if we resolve to deal with these issues in a spirit of democratic responsibility. Creat- ing a formal council on war, for example, would be neither wise nor effective. Institutionalizing the Presidency is the last thing we should want to do. The President cannot be forced to deal through one structure rather than another. He should consult regularly with key people, including the heads of relevant committees and the leadership. But there will be cases when effective consultation should be in one form rather than in another, given the particular human and political situation of the moment. I should like to register two further objections to the approach to the Commission's task exemplified by the War Powers Resolution. The first is that no one, as Professor Henkin has noted, can foresee the necessities of the future. The second and more particular objec- tion is that on its face and in terms of its legislative history, the Resolution purports to deny the President many powers inherent in his role as the nation's chief diplomat, commander-in-chief, and head of state. The Resolution would make it illegal for a President to do what President Truman did in responding to the North Korean invasion of South Korea, or what President Kennedy did in han- dling the Cuban missile crisis. It would have made the expedition of Commodore Perry to Japan illegal, as well as the mobilization of troops on the Mexican border after the Civil War to persuade France to abandon support of Maximilian. It would make President Nixon's policies toward China illegal, because the heart of those policies is a diplomatic warning to the Soviet Union not to make war on China. And it would make President Nixon's reactions to the 12 See Letter from Lyndon B. Johnson to the author, March 25, 1972. See also Rostow, Great Cases Make Bad Law: The War Powers Act, 50 TEx. L. REV. 833, 872 n.80, 881-85 (1972).</page><page sequence="26">804 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 61:747 1973 Middle Eastern crisis illegal, because he mobilized troops and threatened to use them. The Resolution would even make it impos- sible for a President to send a gunboat to rescue American citizens in a troubled area. It is striking that in its first tests -the airlifts out of Saigon and the Mayaguez Episode in the Spring of 1975 - leading congressional sponsors of the Resolution were at pains to deny that it meant what it said. It is not constitutionally possible for Congress to limit the inher- ent powers of the President in this way. It is ironic that several spokesmen for the Resolution claim that it does not affect the most tremendous presidential power of all, the President's control of the nuclear weapon. Everybody knows there is no alternative. I agree with Professor Henkin that it would be a mistake to try to codify our approach to the ticklish problem of executive agree- ments. We have lived with it fairly comfortably for a long time. For example, the establishment of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank'3 was handled not through a treaty, but through a statute, out of respect for the House's constitutional pri- macy over money bills. We have backed up international agree- ments in many other areas with statutes as well as, or instead of, treaties. Our participation in the United Nations is authorized not only under the U.N. Charter but also under the United Nations Participation Act of 1945.'4 I should comment also on Congress' authority to legislate in disre- gard of international obligations.'5 I agree with Professors Henkin and Falk that it is important to view our role in the world in the context of the modem international law of war. Adherence to inter- national law is and always should be a first principle of American foreign policy. We all want the United States to adhere to the rules of the United Nations Charter in its use of force abroad. But simple mechanical devices will not achieve the goal of keeping us on the track of international law. Short of a revolutionary constitutional amendment, which I should oppose, Congress cannot be denied its present power to breach our international obligations, as it did in 1798 when it terminated our Treaty of Alliance with France."5 We should remember that many of these obligations are incurred by the action of the President alone. A vote in the United Nations Security Council, for example, is necessarily decided upon by the President, and only by the President. To say that by such action he can com- 31 22 U.S.C. ?? 286 et seq.

Finally, I should like to address the issue of secrecy. I have a good deal of trouble with the way Professor Henkin has presented it. It is true that the degree of cooperation between Congress and the Executive Branch varies from time to time, and that the pressures of controversy can temporarily poison the historic atmosphere of understanding and cooperation. But it is very rare - in my experi- ence, at least - for key congressional committees not to know what the Executive Branch knows. The real problem of secrecy has a different dimension - whether the President, in trying to secure or deter some particular action by another nation, should publicly announce everything that he knows about that nation's activities. While "open covenants openly arrived at""7 are dear to my heart, prudence sometimes counsels silence. In retrospect, for example, most observers and participants believe that President Kennedy disclosed too much in his conduct of the Cuban missile crisis. They generally agree with the way in which he handled that affair, but feel that it was a mistake to put the Soviet Union in the position of having to climb down in public. In any event, subsequent Presi- dents, in facing similar issues with the Soviet Union, have preferred not to trumpet out everything they know, maintaining a discreet silence in the interest of making it easier to obtain agreement. The Commission should recognize this dimension of the secrecy problem. In summary, I should say that we do have an effective constitu- tional system for carrying on foreign relations - that is to say, the most effective system we can have which is compatible with our goals of preserving democratic control and responsibility, giving Congress the last word on most issues, and preventing tyranny. The growth of the Presidency has been continuous since the beginning of the Republic. It has been especially rapid during periods when foreign policy problems have been most urgent. This growth has been a response to necessity, and not the result of presidential usur- pation, on the one hand, or of congressional passivity, on the other. We must continue to experiment in that way, and in that spirit. In conclusion, I should make three basic recommendations. First, 17 See 56 Cong. Rec. 680 (1918) ("Fourteen Points" speech by President Wilson).</page><page sequence="28">806 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 61:747 the War Powers Resolution should be repealed. This would free the conduct of our diplomacy from a doubt which may now inhibit the effectiveness of presidential warnings to foreign powers. Second, the staff of the White House should be reduced. Everyone has agreed that the White House staff has grown too big, following Parkinson's famous law. The Congress can easily reduce that staff through its use of the appropriations power. Such staff reductions would re- quire the President to work more closely with the departments. Finally, and above all, in the shadow of Watergate, all of us should take the pledge to renew our will to assume full ethical responsi- bility for the integrity of our political discourse.</page></plain_text>
