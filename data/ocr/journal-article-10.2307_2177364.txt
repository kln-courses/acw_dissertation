On the occasion of the three hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the found- ing of the University of Geneva, its distinguished psychologist Claparede most appropriately published an account of the contributions to animal psychology made by one of the great eighteenth century naturalists of Geneva, "who," in the words of the preface, "if he never taught in our old Academy, is yet among those to whom she owes most." Born in I720, dying in I793, Bonnet spent his entire life in Geneva. During the course of that life, hampered as it was by ill health and defective vision, Bonnet discovered parthenogenesis, experimented on regeneration in animals, investigated the functions of the leaves of plants, suggested the possibility of mental measure- ments ("Might not," he says, "the number of different correct conclusions which different minds draw from the same principles serve as the foundation for the construction of a Psychometry, and may it not be presumed that some day minds will be measured as one measures bodies?"), and is held by Claparede to deserve the title of author of the theory of specific nervous energies. In his attitude towards the problems presented by the minds of the lower animals, as elsewhere, Bonnet foreshadows many modern ideas. He was steadily opposed to anthropomorphism. "Because we are men and reason, we make animals reason: we ascribe to, them industry, intelligence, and what is still less philosophic, plans and prevision." "Do not say that bees hoard provisions for the winter; you would utter an absurdity. Say merely that bees collect honey and wax, and you state a fact." His aim was to under-</page><page sequence="2">No. 2.1 NOTICES OF NEW BOOKS. 255 stand the mechanism of instinct rather than its purpose: throughout he avoided finalistic explanations. Nevertheless, he believed that animals have souls. His reasons for so believing are summarized by Claparede. First, the analogy between our bodily structure and that of animals renders it probable that they, like us, have souls. Secondly, the unity of conscious- ness demands the existence of the soul, and this unity must exist in animals, for they compare and judge: "they feel the difference between two sensations and act in consequence of this feeling." Thirdly, the disproportion between the excitation and the resulting reaction indicates the existence of a soul. Fourthly, the variations and irregularities in the activities of animals suggest that they are not machines. Finally, Bonnet, as a follower of Leibnitz and a believer in the law of continuity, was obliged to hold that the soul exists in beings below man; moreover, his optimism led him to postulate a future life for animals. It is hardly necessary to point out, as Claparede briefly does, the unsatisfactory character of all these arguments except the first. The soul of animals being thus asserted to exist, its function, according to Bonnet, involves real action upon the body. He rejected the doctrine of pre-established harmony in favor of interactionism. In the case of instinctive movements, the animal, Bonnet held, is provided with a system of fibres representing the work and the means of its execution; there is, further, a connection between this representative system and the system of limbs or organs of movement; and there is, finally, a cause which sets into action the representative system. This cause is an affair of the soul: it is, namely, pleasure. As for action involving adaptation to new conditions, here the soul comes into play in making the connection between the representative system and the motor system. The problem as to how an immaterial sub- stance can act upon matter Bonnet evades by calling the soul a force: "I have the most perfect certainty that my soul is a force, since at every instant I exercise this force, and at every instant I feel that it is I who exercise it." Claparede, in discussing critically this anti-mechanical theory, which is hardly more naive than some widely circulated theories of the present day in its apparent feeling that the situation is improved if we explain as much as possible by mechanism and invoke the soul as little as possible, finds that a purely mechanical explanation is now, with the greatly increased scientific knowl- edge at our command, perfectly sufficient to explain the whole of animal be- havior, except the single case of immediate adaptation of behavior to new condi- tions. Even here, he holds, we should assume that a mechanistic explanation will be found, for mechanism is the postulate of all scientific knowledge. The example of rapid adaptation to new conditions which Claparede adduces as not at present explicable by mechanism seems really to offer no great obstacles to such an explanation. He supposes a kitten that has learned to jump on a table, and also to eat from a plate placed under a table. The plate is set on the table, and the kitten, seeing it, jumps on the table and eats from the plate. "How can the desire to reach the plate be transferred to the table, which alone governs the movements of jumping up?" asks Claparede, and finds</page><page sequence="3">256 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXI. mechanism at present, despite his allegiance to it, incapable of an answer. If space permitted, the reviewer would undertake to sketch a fairly plausible mechanistic explanation. The remainder of the monograph treats of Bonnet's theory of maternal love, a purely egoistic and non-finalistic theory; his doctrine that the difference between the human and the animal mind lies in the possession of abstract ideas by the former,-in connection with which his recognition of the fact that abstraction depends upon attention is of considerable historical interest; -and his attempt to explain how an animal such as a polyp or worm, which can divide into independently subsisting individuals, can still possess a soul: a problem which he solves in terms highly suggestive of Weismann's by main- taining that the whole body of the animal contains germs each of which repre- sents the whole animal and hence, in germ, a soul. Anti-anthropomorphism, anti-finalism, and the beginnings of experimenta- tion: such were the characteristic features of Bonnet's views on animal psychology. He was not without influence on a train of German thinkers, but this influence "was suddenly annihilated by the revolution produced with the rise of the Kantian philosophy. Empirical psychology was abandoned, and Bonnet and his followers fell into oblivion." MARGARET FLOY WASHBURN. VASSAR COLLEGE.</page></plain_text>
