<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUFISM AND ISMA'ILI DOCTRINE IN THE PERSIAN POETRY OF NIZARI QUHISTANI (645-721/1247-1321)1 By Leonard Lewisohn Institute of smaili Studies, London FOREWORD HIakim NizAri Quhistani (d. 721/1321),2 one of the eminent and original Persian poets of the Mongol period, was born in 645/1247 in the village of Ffidaj which lies in the suburbs of the city of Birjand in south- eastern Khurasan. He was, according to some authorities (see below, V), a scion of the last Isma'ili Nizari Imam, Rukn al-Din Khurshah (653-54/ 1255-56). Since the only reliable facts about his life are those that can be deduced from his own works,3 it is mostly to these that I will be directing my attention in the following brief sketch of his life and times. In this essay I shall summarise (i) Nizari's biography, before proceeding to discuss (ii) his life as a courtier, vizier and panegryrist, (iii) the literary influences on his verse, (iv) his bacchanalian poetry, (v) various theories about the origins of his pen-name, (vi) the Isma'ili motifs and (vii) Sufi topoi and symbolism of his homiletic mathnawi and erotic lyrical poetry. Finally, some general conclusions (viii) will be drawn to resolve some of the apparent contradictions ostensibly present in the different (Sufi-Isma'ili) religious persuasions and spiritual doctrines expressed in his verse, while situating his poetry in its historical, literary, and spiritual contexts. Some reflections will also be offered on the place and significance of his poetry in the pantheon of mediaeval Persian poets, and comments made on the trans-sectarian context and mystical content of his verse as an expression of both Sufi symbolism and theosophy, and Isma'ili doctrine. II. NIZARI, POET AND COURTIER Of Nizari's early years until his mid-twenties, very little is known. He was born into a family who probably "belonged to a clan of high-profile notables of the Isma'ili sect in Quhistan, in which they possessed an eminent leadership role."4 He had three brothers. He apparently enjoyed a normal education, studying Arabic grammar, philosophy, literature, and the rudiments of Sufi theosophy.5 In his mid-twenties Nizari found employment at the court of Shams al-Din Kart (643-76 /1245-77), the ruler of Sistan (and much of the province of Khurasan) in northern Iran.6 Arriving in Herat in the early 1270s, he worked for the Kart dynasty (who ruled a large part of Afghanistan on behalf of the Mongols) in various capacities both as a tax-collector and court poet.7 But as he became more intimate with the responsibilities of his job as a tax- collector, he gradually became disillusioned with the harsh and punitive measures adopted by the Karts who, under pressure from their Mongol overlords, often obliged him to exact money and goods by force from local peasants. In 679/1280 he set out on a long journey from Quhistan, exploring some of the northern and Western provinces, particularly Georgia, bordering the Caspian Sea, while recording his travels in a mathnawi poem of over a thousand couplets entitled the Safar-nima, "Travelogue". This was his earliest mathnawi poem, dedicated to a certain Sufi master named Amin al-Din8 (see below, VII). On his return to Herat in 681/1282, he resigned his post at the Kart court and retired to his hometown Birjand where he remained for nearly a decade, married and raised a family. Then in 694/1294, the local Mihrabanid prince 'Ali Shfih hired him as his court poet, although he managed to keep this position for only two years before his outspoken opinions and polemics penned against the oppressive nobles at the prince's court, local mullahs and corrupt jurists caused offence to the prince, who exiled him from court. From his early youth and employment in the Kart administration in his twenties until his death in retirement in 721/1321 in his mid-seventies, Nizari composed volumes of poetry, much of which was inspired by the court society and the high social circles in which he moved. Over the course of his long career as a courtier, he also wrote much occasional and panegryrical verse inspired by the social circumstances of court life and the political position that he held as 229</page><page sequence="2">230 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES vizier of the kings of Quhistan.9 After his exile from the Mihrabanid court, he spent the remaining two decades of his life, during his fifties and sixties (from 696/1296 to 721/1321) confined to his small property in Birjand where he composed most of his main mathnawl poems (Munizara shab u raz, "The Dispute Between Night and Day"; Azhar u mazhar, "Disclosure and Theophany"; as well as his Dastar-nama, "Book of Directives").10 During his final years, Nizari - who once claimed to have composed 10,000 couplets of panegyric verse - like Sana'i before him, renounced the paid poet's profession and retired into a cloistered existence in the hills of Quhistan. Disillusioned by his patrons' indifference, he spent these years bitterly lamenting the vanity of composing servile verses in praise of - to use Hafiz's phrase - "a lord who lacks beneficence (makhdim bi 'indyat)."11 Nothing better explains Nizari's attitude towards composition of panegryric verse than the following lines from a long qasida:-12 I still am - and always was - drunk from wine and from the icon of beauty. I never was, nor ever will be, swollen with conceit over status and the high rank of greatness. Have ever I praised anyone, that had two aspects: either it was belaboured ceremony, or else a form of love. If the former was mere lip-service, the latter come out from the depths of my soul: the heart's adept will distinguish between what's spoken out of social obligation and what's uttered from conviction. I never stretched out my hand in greed towards any base morsel, never sullied the robes of my soul with ignoble conduct. I have a good dwelling in the Street of Contentment, (just like) the minter of money, who is an alchemist, is the Lord of the cash of fortune... What the scholar has is only this general knowledge, but for us it suffices that we can clearly discern, by way of demonstrative proof (hujjat) (the difference) between the path of the Resurrection (ma 'd) and the source and genesis of creation (mabda). Although I am entirely disadvantaged of diverse types of learning, I am learned by virtue of my inner nature in the world of interior spiritual significations (c'lam-i ma'na). No, no! 0 Nizari. No, no! You are not the man to expound this lore. How far wide you are of knowledge and learning in your unknowing! For if you know all the lore of creation, and then do not find yourself yet more ignorant, you deserve damnation. What "vision" can possibly exist There; what "knowledge" can subsist There; what place is there for interior spiritual reality (ma 'nai) or for the external phenomenal form (.sarat) There? As long as you have not abandoned your self, He will not enter within: how abhorrent it is for an angel to be the companion of a devil! So let "yourself' depart entirely from betwixt and between, that "He" alone may remain: this is the tale that I have told you: this is the Way to divine Unity (tariq-i wa~hdat). In another poem (1231: 11830-38), Nizari railed against the ethos of obsequious praise indulged in by panegryrical poets, declaring himself a devotee of the</page><page sequence="3">SUFISM AND ISMA'ILI DOCTRINE IN THE PERSIAN POETRY OF NIZARI QUHISTANI 231 religion of love. "I am a word-burner not word-spinner, speech-consumer not speech-writer," he cries. Repudiating the profession of paid panegyrist, he remarks: "Seek Nizari if it's Love you want. If panegryrical praise, go to Anwari": Love is the consummation and crown of the world. Created beings are not worthy of Love's leadership. Love is King, and upon all it is incumbent to obey him, be they be pious devotees or libertines. In fact, the sultans of the world behave with devotion towards Love, acting with servility. In the exposition of the Lover, the Beloved and Love, I work magic, and here's the sorcery! I am free from praising any created being - may God forbid it - for it would be degrading for Jesus to bear an ass's burden. How can one who is drunk out of his senses pretend to be clever? How can a man devoid of accomplishments comprehend poetry? I am a word-bumer, not a word- spinner, a speech-consumer, not a speech-writer: iconoclasm is different from iconolatry. Although Qanbar was the freed slave who belonged to 'Ali, it does not suit 'Ali to behave like a slavish baboon. Seek Nizari if it's Love you want, but if it's panegryrical praise you desire, seek it from AnwarI. Nizari's rank and stature in the Persian poetic canon vas certainly better appreciated by his contemporaries han by modem literary critics. In one of the earliest :opies of his Diwcan, calligraphed by 'Abd al-Rashid b. ;haykh 'Abdullah Khalawi a century after his death in 337/1433, Nizari is given such titles as "King of Poets" Malik al-shu'ara), "Sovereign of the Philosophers" Sultpdn al-hukama'), "Leader of the Mystics" Muqaddam al-'urafa'), and even "Counsellor of Princes and Ministers" (Ndsih al- 'umard' wa 'l- wuzard'), demonstrating how highly he was esteemed by his own immediate contemporaries.13 Shaykh Adhari Tusi (d. 866/1461), the poet laureate of Sultaan Ahmad Shah Bahmani (reg. 825-37/1421-33), in his still unpublished "Jewels of the Mysteries" (Jawahir al- asrdr), likewise commends Nizari for being a "comprehensive poet" (sha'ir-i jdmi).14 Considering the fact that only a decade has passed since the publication (1993) of Mujtahidzada's two-volume critical edition of his Diwan, it is fair to say that today scholars still have not made a proper appraisal of his poetic oeuvre. Aside from the thousands of lines of mathnawi verse that he composed, NizarI's Diwdn represents a monumental achievement, totalling altogether 1408 ghazals and qasidas, amounting altogether to 13,646 couplets. His Diwdn, which is the basis of the preliminary research carried out in this essay, proves him to be the most prolific Isma'ili poet in the Persian language - and certainly the greatest poet in Persian literature of the Isma'ili persuasion after Nasir-i Khusraw (d. 470/1077). III. LITERARY INFLUENCES ON NIZARI'S POETRY If and when a comprehensive history of Persian literature in the Mongol period is ever composed, Nizari's poetic corpus will certainly be recognised as being highly significant for the light it sheds on the socio-political history of the Il-Khanid Persia. Mazahir Musaffa, editor of his Diwcan, underlines that "in Nizari's ghazals there are many signs of the impact</page><page sequence="4">232 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES which the fanatically jealous, prejudiced and bigoted people of his age had upon him. These types of people were constantly reviling and slandering him, accusing him of heresy. Each of his ghazals is a cutting sword held up before his abusive critics and slanderers."'5 The following lines from a qasida (not given in the main text of his Diwdn) give a flavour of the deep political dissatisfaction and social pessimism which permeates Nizari's verse:16 The world has been devastated by clerics who skim off charitable donations for themselves! Go, Nizari, and dress yourself in the garments of obtuse ignorance. Do not idly sow away the seed of your life in this world's farmlands, putting stock in the thought you'll reap any harvest from such brackish marshland. Why should a reasonable mind incline to hear the sermon preached by a hypocrite? When did a doctor ever prescribe opium to a psychotic? The perfidy and vice of the so-called "folk of virtue" has reached such a point that it is de rigueur that we commend and acclaim anybody who is a knave! Indeed, what have they learned from studying Islamic jurisprudence but the art of imposture, fraud and humbug? What have they gleaned from pursuit of knowledge and learning but enmity and hostility? Alas! If it wasn't for the fact that they feared it might rouse popular agitation against them, these learned divines skilled in jurisprudence themselves would consume wine in public from on high in their pulpits! Go Oust try it out for youself): invite a Muslim jurist to a banquet: you'll see how like a cat he'll show up for lunch also when you invite him to dinner! ... So, if I am pagan unbeliever, tell me who's the Muslim? Where is he to be found? In such circumstances, it's a pity that someone like myself who is slack in faith (muqassir) did not become an Islamic extremist (ghuluww)!'7 A highly celebrated poet during his own lifetime, Nizari composed verses directly modelled on a wide range of early classical Persian poets, including Shahid- i Balkhi, Rudaki, Daqiqi and Khdqani.18 The voices of Sana'I and Nizami are also central to the inspiration of Nizari's mathnawi and ghazal poetry.19 In his mathnawi poem Dastar-nama, "Book of Directives", dedicated to the drinking of wine,20 discussed in section IV below, Nizari appears to be strongly affected by the poetic style of Firdawsi as well.21 The literary strains of 'Attar and Rami, all of whose wise dicta he directly admonishes the reader to emulate,22 also strongly pervade his verse, while his mathnawi poem Azhar u mazhar was written in direct imitation of 'Attar's Khusraw-ndma.23 Mazahir Musaffa devotes thirty pages (315-45) documenting Sa'di's influence on Nizari, noting numerous occasions on which he explicitly paraphrases or else directly includes (tad1min) hemistichs from the Bfistan or ghazals of Sa'di in his poetry, and judges that Sa'di is the most influential poet upon him.24 He convincingly demonstrates the presence of common conceptual notions utilised by both poets, although in regard to their mutual use of end-rhymes, poetic devices and metres, the greater part of his comparisons seem to be farfetched and unconvincing. Nizari's influence on Hafiz's Diw~n was first pointed out by Jamni in his Bihdristan who observed that "the literary style of HUafiz's poetry is close to that of Nizari Quhistani, although in Nizari's poetry there is much unevenness of quality to be found, contrary to that of Hafiz."25 This influence, which is documented by Ghultm 'AlI Changiz Baybtirdi, is highlighted as</page><page sequence="5">SUFISM AND ISMA'ILI DOCTRINE IN THE PERSIAN POETRY OF NIZARI QUHISTANI 233 well by Musaffa, who presents some twenty-six pages of parallel verses exemplifing the deep influence of NizAri's verse on Hafiz (347-73). Many if not most of the parallels cited both by Baybirdi and Musaffa, however, are of a loosely conceptual nature rather than concerned with metrics or imagery. In my opinion, they constitute these critics' personal estimation rather than any irrefutable literary demonstration of Nizari's themes and ideas influencing the genius of Hafiz. Nonetheless, from these influences alone it is obvious that Nizari was steeped in the broad spectrum of the classical Persian poetic tradition, within which he certainly holds a pivotal place as the most important IsmW'ili re-interpreter of this canon of the Mongol period. IV. NIZARI'S BACCHANALIA Although E.G. Browne (writing towards 1920) was of the opinion that "Nizari's poems ... though spirited enough, appear for the most part to be of the usual Bacchanalian type, and give little or no indication of the poet's religious views or general circumstances,"26 a closer examination of his Diwin reveals this to be far from the truth; not only can one find distinctly Isma'ili tendencies (see below, VI), but also some quite precise indications of his religious views in his verse, exposing the deep effect of Sufism (see below, VII) on his thought. However, there is no doubt that Bacchanalian imagery predominants in Nizari's poetry, as Browne maintained. Of NizAri's penchant for wine, Mazahir Musaffa comments astutely, His ghazals are so completely steeped in wine from end to end that perhaps one can say that from among writers of (Persian) ghazals no other poet is equal to Nizari in the description of wine, in depicting states of intoxication and in praising wine and wine-drinking. So it is not without cause that most literary historians have considered him as a "bard of wine".27 In a key poem concerning repentance from intemperance the poet admonishes himself: "For forty years I have bathed myself in the blood of the wine- grape ... Now I have repented from what is forbidden, and have broken my pledge to the wine-goblet. My head is drunk with another type of cup; my wine from another sort of tavern is drunk. On that my heart is set and in this lies my health: to drink the wine that is pure and celestial."28 Nizari - according to his own account here - was a tippler of wine for a period of some forty years, until suddenly he underwent a conversion experience. He took refuge in a mosque where he repented of his ways, but his teetotalism lasted only two years, for he soon returned "like Khayyam (Khayycmvdr)"29- as he confesses - to his former habits. The fact that his mathnawi poem, the Dastifr- ndima (written in 710/1310 when Niza~ri was 65 years old) is devoted to praise of wine and the rites of wine- drinking, demonstrates that the poet to the very end of his life remained fascinated and enthralled by the "daughter of the vine." No doubt out of deference to the intensely mystical dimension of his poetry, Musaffa interprets such clearly secular biographical references to wine as constituting pure allegory, wine being understood as a foil to convey Sufi ecstasy.30 It must be said that, far from being an alien modem imposition, this mystical interpretation of Nizari's bacchanalian verse is of ancient provenance, and was first expressed by Dawlatshdh Samarqandi c. 892/1487 who in his celebrated "Memoirs of the Poets" (Tadhkirat al-shu'ari), alluding to the debate then going on about the religious vs. secular nature of NizarI's poetry, wrote: Some folk consider Nizari to be a monotheist and gnostic, others as belonging to the Isma'ili sect. For however much his discourse concerns the worship of wine and the rites and arts of polite conversation and intoxication, his words display much gnostic wisdom and expound many spiritual truths as well. From the interior reality of his words (haqiqat-i sukhanan-i u), it is apparent that he was wise man, an adept in the spiritual verities of things, so to harbour ill-faith about him is pure slander.31 Dawlatshah is completely correct in his observation that nearly all the bacchanalian verses in his ghazals are surfeited with a profound mystical content as well. Ghazal 1362, ostensibly in praise of wine, for instance, reads (in prose translation): What sort of slander is this that they say I have repented of wine? God forbid it that I should ever repent (tawba) - when did I ever repent of wine? Stand up, O cupbearer and pour that spiritual water (ab-i ma'nawi) into the goblet: others are quickened</page><page sequence="6">234 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES to life by the spirit, but our spirit is living through it (wine). The king and his kingdom; the dervish and contentment, and me and love: indeed, as they say, all things return to their own origins. ... From the purity of the elemental substance of wine, the mystery of the Invisible Realm is disclosed, for all of this hue and cry has been sent out in the world from the king's goblet. Yet it is hard to tell whether such poems spring from any genuine mystical experience or state (.hal) or were just passing poetic moods. In another poem, Nizlri expressed exactly the opposite sentiment, claiming to "have repented from wine, not with aversion but rather with avid desire!"32 Any intellectual consistency that can be read into such contradictory poetic expressions to my mind lies only on the level of the esoteric exegesis of symbols, in which the internal semiotic substance (ma'na) of the metaphor, rather than its conceptual lexical shell (lafz) is audited by the ear of the creative imagination. "In nature, each individual symbol plays innumerable parts, as each particle of matter circulates in turn through every system," said Ralph Waldo Emerson in his study of Swedenborg's doctrine of correspondences. "The central identity enables any one symbol to express successively all the qualities and shades of real being. In the transmission of heavenly waters every hose fits every hydrant. Nature avenges herself speedily on the hard pedantry that would chain her waves. She is no literalist. Everything must be taken genially, and we must be at the top of our condition, to understand anything rightly."33 But leaving aside the question of whether or not the wine in Nizari's verse was of the physical or figurative nature, metaphorical of ecstasy, or in actuality drunk from a banqueting chalice, it is the spiritual pleasure rather than physical effect of the wine that is always emphasised in his poetry. That the esoteric dimension of bacchanalian intoxication is the key topos of his Persian khamriyya is evident from two key sections of the Dastfir-nama (vv. 406-15: on "The Spiritual Stations of the Wine-Drinkers;" vv. 456-65: on "Spiritual Flight and Divine Inspiration"), each of which describes the transcendence of egocentric self- consciousness on the part of "the drunkards," narrating their experience as a kind of mystical hierosgamos in which a "chymical wedding" takes place between the wine of the glass and the wine of praise of God. Wine-drinking and wine imagery also appear in his verse as a deliberate act of social subversion: a kind of poetic device used to criticise the spiritually arid ascetics and ignorant clerics who repudiate or do not recognise the supremacy of the religion of love. Replying to an ascetic who teased him that he should consider swearing an oath on the wine he drank, Nizari penned these mordant anti-clerical verses:34 "You ought to swear an oath by the wine you drink," an arid Pharisee ascetic postulated me. "Shaykh," I replied, "I bid you instead to first imbibe a bit more of this wine of your self-conceit and vainglory. After drinking that, if luck be your mate, you'll then comprehend why the cat devours her own kittens." In reply to another critical cleric, he puts the same point even more bluntly. The real immorality is egocentricism, not the so-called vice of drunkenness. Selfhood is the source of all sin, whereas intoxication at least may lead to the drinker to a kind of self- transcendence. Deliberately to find fault with your fellow-man is a vice far worse than drunkenness, for the latter only temporarily affects the drinker's state, while the former is a permanent blight upon all goodwill and neighbourly content.35 ~p;~pu o~!L u L a ~t; ~JLe &amp;ju uL1 ic~ iY cS~~i- j 4-? L?-Y~L P !~ J&amp;L )(r L5, i</page><page sequence="7">SUFISM AND ISMA'ILI DOCTRINE IN THE PERSIAN POETRY OF NIZARI QUHISTANI 235 Although I adore wine, you yourself are a drunkard too, so why, dear sir, do you censure me? All I drink is the juice of grapes, but you soak up the blood of your fellow men. So don't adopt such an austere countenence upon such a poor conjecture. Of prime importance, O savant, is that first you wash yourself clean of your own faults. Then, once you become pure, you will never again seek to know - nor ever see or tell again - the faults of other men. As such verses prove, even Nizari's apparent "worldliness" always has an otherworldly aim: his apparent libertinism is surfeited with moral intent. Despite the seeming profanity of much of his verse, the actual content of his poetic imagery is steeped in Sufi symbolism, the outwardly secular imagery of which conveys a message full of moral purpose, all his verse being based on mystical topoi drawn from the typical vocabulary of Sufism: (e.g. contentment, patience, the superiority of love over reason, the veil of the self, etc.) that permeates the poetic inspiration of other Sufi poets of the Mongol period. In any case, our modem pietistic theological sensibility that attempts to evaluate the conceptual cosmos of mediaeval Persian poet using dualistic categories of "profane worldly practices" vs. so- called "sacred morality" - characteristic, for example of the Christian pietism of the English metaphysical poets (excluding Donne) - shall never be usefully applied to any of the Persian Sufi poets. In the end, as with Hiafiz's Sciqi-naima, which directly follows NizarI in the praise of "the charismatica of wine,"36 it is of the gnosis of wine that the poet sings, celebrating a drunken esoteric wisdom, the "philosopher's antidote,"37 before which the physical world pales into insignificance. beasts? Nothing. Go, ask the price of life from men whose hearts are quickened to life. ... Every person has their own peculiar course, wit and way. Our wit and way is that of the heart of the brethren of purity (ahl-i safa). O Sufi, there exists no purer substance than wine - listen to Nizari for he speaks the truth to you. V. THE POET'S NOM-DE-PLUME Scholars and Tadhkira writers have varying opinions concerning the derivation of "Nizari," the poet's adopted pen-name. According to E.G. Browne, it was derived from his devotion to the eldest son of Fatimid Caliph al-Mustansir: Nizar b. al-Mustansir (437-88/1045-95), a claimant to the Fatimid throne, whose claims to legitimacy, after his execution in 1095, were taken up by HIasan Sabbah, through whose preaching a separate Nizari Isma'ili state came into existence in Seljuq Persia.38 Browne's view is not corroborated by Mazahir Musaffa, the editor of his Diwan, who believes in the possibility, due to two couplets that appear in his Diwan, that his pen-name was given to him by the Sunni ruler Shams al-Din 'Ali Shah (reg. 688-708/1289-1308,39 who belonged to a dynasty ruling over Sistan40), for whom Nizari worked, as well as his vizier 'Ala' al-Din Hindai, as an official and a court poet. One author - Borodin - identifies Nizari as attached to the court of the Kart Maliks of Herat; another - Bayburdi - believes his patrons to have been local rulers and Mongol officials in Quhistan.41 Dhabihullah Safa considers his pen-name to be "a sobriquet belonging to the poet's family name" and, to Bring me wine, for wine is the philosopher's antidote. Do not drink with one unworthy of it; do not give it to one who does not earnestly desire it. One should never prescribe wine by force on anyone except for one languishing in dipsomania, in which case, the rule is that force is permitted. What value does wine have to be exact, as derived from an elder cousin of his named "Sa'd al-Din Nizarl" who held a high position in the Kart court.42 Professor Safa cites several verses from the Diwan to try to clinch this point, concluding that "it is certain that 'Nizarl' was not merely the title adopted by the poet, but rather was a title used by other</page><page sequence="8">236 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES members of his family. The poet, however, chose it as his particular nom-de-plume, ... and this sobriquet is also without a doubt derived from either the genealogical affiliation or the devotion of his family to al-Mustafa li-Din Allah, famed as Nizar, the son of al- Mustansir bi'llah Fatimi."43 Professor Safa goes on to cite the account given by Fasih Khwdfi in his Mujmal-i Fash.i, in the entry detailing the events of the year 721/1224, in which Khwfif states that "the poet Hakim Nizarl QuhistanI, whose surname was Sa'd al-Din, was from Birjand. He came from the family lineage of 'Ala' al-Din Mulhid, who was a disciple of Mustansir Isma'ili."44 The "Mustansir Isma'ili" mentioned here is of course Nizar, while "'Ala' al-Din Mulhid" is most probably 'Ala' al-Din Muhammad (reg. 618-53/ 1221-55, son of Jalal al-Din Hasan, the penultimate Isma'ili Imam to reign before the Mongol onslaught, who was for a period the patron of Nasir al-Din Tuisi.45 From Khwafi's notice, Professor Safa adduces that "it is obvious that either the grandparents of the poet, due to their devotion to al-Mustafa li-Din Allah, famed as Nizar, adopted this genealogical pedigree for themselves, or else they considered themselves to be his descendents."46 Professor Safa further speculates that Nizari's father Shams al-Din Muhammad was "perhaps the son of ['Ala' al-Din] Muhammad and the brother Rukn al-Din Khurshah."47 If this is true, this would make an aristocratic Isma'ili nobleman out of Nizari: the nephew, no less, of the last Nizarl Imam: Rukn al-Din Khurshdh (son of 'Ala' al-Din Muhammad). Khurshah, who, it may be recalled, had succeeded his father to the imamate in 653/1255, before submitting to the dissolution and destruction of the military garrisons of Nizari kingdom at the hands of the Mongols and finally being executed by them in 655/1257).48 The fact that both Rukn al-Din Khurshth's brother and NizaWr's son were called "Shahanshah" lends greater credence to Safa's speculations. Concluding his review of Nizari's Isma'ili connections, Safa opines: In the book Hidcyat al-mi'minin ("A Present to the Faithful"), which is also known as Tarikh-i Ismi'%llyya ("The History of the Isma('ilis"), it is mentioned that NizarI was one of the missionaries of the Isma'llis in Quhistan. Insofar as the missionary organisation of the IsmR'ilis of Iran during his lifetime had fallen, as we well know, into a complete state of disarray, it is not clear whether Nizari himself had been given the formal title of Dd '. The sole piece de resistance that he and his family were able to put on exhibit amidst all that riot and melee was the rescuing of their own life-raft from succumbing to the peril of these tumultous waves. But this much however is certain: Nizari, and the rest of his family, belonged to a clan of high-profile notables of the Isma'lli sect in Quhistan, in which they possessed an eminent leadership role.49 Although Mazahir Musaffa declares himself undecided about the derivation of the pen-name, he ultimately tends to favour the above arguments adduced by Professor Safa concerning Nizari's noble Isma'ili ancestry. In her study of Nizari's life and works, Nadia Jamal has also reviewed various opinions about the provenance of his pen-name, without reaching any definite conclusions in this respect. However, she strongly emphasises both the Isma'ili background of poet's family and his own adherence to Isma'ilism5so as the key factor of his intellectual biography. But, since this study is primarily concerned with the doctrinal nature and import of Nizari's verse, the above overview of the scholarly controversies surrounding his own poetic self-identity must for the moment suffice. VI. ISMA'ILI DIMENSIONS OF NIZARI'S POETRY Farhad Daftary points out that in pre-Safavid Persia, a coalescence emerged "between Persian Sufism and Nizari Isma'ilism, which represented two independent esoteric traditions in Islam. It is owing to this Isma'ili- Sufi coalescence, still even less understood from the Sufi side, that it is often difficult to ascertain whether a certain post-Alamftt Persian treatise was written by a Nizfri author influenced by Sufism, or whether it was produced in Sufi milieus exposed to Ismj'ilism."s5 These comments certainly ring true in regard to Nizari's poetry in which the amalgamation of Isma'ili doctrine with Sufi symbols and concepts is so complete that analysis of the significance of a certain verse, without simultaneous study of both these esoteric traditions, is well-nigh impossible. In the light of his Sufi-Isma'ili intellectual syncretism, in what follows, I will first attempt to highlight the explicitly Isma'ili motifs in his poetry before proceeding to examine the Sufi doctrines and symbols (in the following section VII) therein.</page><page sequence="9">SUFISM AND ISMA'ILI DOCTRINE IN THE PERSIAN POETRY OF NIZARI QUHISTANI 237 There are many lines in Nizari's Diwan which attest to his Isma'ili faith, and as S. Ridt Mujtahidzada points out, his poetry is so steeped in Isma'ili technical terminology that his adherence to this religious denomination is beyond all doubt.52 Albeit, Nizari's Isma'ili ideas are always expressed within the context of Sufism; it is as if the two doctrines interfused each other, making of him a kind of Sufi Isma'ili or an Isma'ili Sufi, so that he appears to wear the robes of both religious communities simultaneously. The following ghazal (746: 7349-59), in which the poet expressly calls himself both an Isma'Ili da'i and a master of a Sufi khanaqdh, for instance, is typical of his religious syncretism in this respect: (7349) There exists for us an absolute opposition between Truth and Falsity (such that between the two) there hangs suspended a sword sharp as a hairs' breadth. (7350) Listen to a piece of friendly advice from me, O friend: do not incline yourself to those whose judgement is flawed; do not listen to the words of fools. (7351) For once take the "I'H" of hayrat (mystical bewilderment) and put it next to the Qif of qurb (intimacy with God) [i.e the Arabic letters. H + Q = HIaqq = Truth] so that it will be essentially evident to you how the Mim of Muhziqq (the true Isma'ili adept) becomes ascertained. (7352) Mary was a virgin, else how could she have borne the Messiah? Hallaj was dead, else how had he ever said: "I am God"? (7353) Every exoteric reality you see is not without its esoteric dimension: Listen to the summons of the Mission from a certified missionary. (7354) Adopt yourself to the present moment's influx of inspiration so that I may obtain a promise [of realising this esoteric dimension] for you. Do not let your hand be without a cup of the best claret wine. (7355) I am a master of the khanaqdch, that is to say, of the wine-house: simple cotton and wool is all I want, not silk and gold brocade. (7356) You have not even imbibed a scent (of reality) and yet you relate yourself to Shaykh Sadiq. This affair concerns spiritual impoverishment (iftiqdr), not (wearing) green or blue robes. (7357) I hold someone's love (mihr, also "sun") in my heart who when a miracle needed to be displayed, was able to the rend the moon in twain in the heavens. (7358) The love of the Wall is kneaded into my flesh and blood. Do you know who that is? It is that Commander-general, (who was) the lion on the battlefield of the [Battle of the] Trench. (7359) Dense idiots - I know - detest Nizar, but just because sham traditionalists finds faults with these words, there's no need to get upset. This poem is important in placing in perspective both the Ismi'ili context of his Sufi expression and the Sufi context of his Isma'ili Shi'ism. On the one hand, clear indications of his Batini persuasion can be seen in verses such as 7353, where the poet explicitly identifies himself as posessing a relatively high degree in the Isma'ili esoteric hierarchy: that of the "certified missionary" (dc'i-yi musaddaq).53 In Isma'ili gnosis, the role of the dc't-yi mutlaq or "authorised missionary" - a term more or less equivalent here to Nizari's "certified missionary" (didi-yi musaddaq) - is to initiate seekers into the higher realms of knowledge and acquaint them with "angelology; to initiate them in the ta 'wil, that is to say, in esoteric exegesis," as Henry Corbin points out.54 This is exactly what Nizari asks his reader to apprehend</page><page sequence="10">238 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES from this verse: hearken to the esoteric teaching and Qufr'nic exegesis from one certified and authorised to expound it, he inculcates, for every outer phenomenon has an esoteric dimension which sustains it (the gist of the first hemistich in which he professes the classic Isma'ili doctrine that every outer dimension of reality [zahir] has a corresponding inner one, batin). On the other hand, two lines later, in verses 7355-56 of this ghazal, we find two clearly Sufi references: I am a master of the khinaqih, that is to say, of a wine-house; Simple cotton and wool is all I need, not silk and gold brocade. You have not even had a scent (of reality) and yet you relate yourself to Shaykh Sa~diq; This affair concerns spiritual impoverishment (iftiqdr), not (wearing) green or blue robes. When, in couplet 7355, Nizari lays claim to be "a master of the khcnaqdh," he clarifies this image as being both an allegorical expression and a spiritual rank, equating the Sufi symbol and institution of the khanaqdh to a sharib-khana or Winehouse, which according to al-Tahanawi, is "symbolic of the Angelic World, as well as signifying the inner being of the perfect gnostic which is full of yearning and creative exhuberance inspired by divine gnosis."55 In the second hemistich, he emphasises that he is concerned moreover with the interior discipline of spiritual impoverishment (cotton and wool: the essential substance, s~if of "S.if- ism"), rather than mere exterior trappings of power and glory (silk and gold brocade). In the next line (7356), citing "Shaykh Sadiq," Nizari's refers to the sixth Shi'ite Imam Abu Ja'far al- Sadiq (d. 765), revered both by Isml'ilis and Sufis as one the founding father of their communities. Thus the Sufi poet 'Attar lists al-Sadiq as the first Sufi in his Tadhkirat al-awliya , stating that "since most of the discourses made about the Sufi Path from amongst the members of the House (ahl-i bayt; i.e. Shi'ites) have been made by him, and since there are more accounts related from him than others, I have narrated a few words from him here, since they (the Sufis) are all one. When I mention him, I mention them all."56 Concerning the technical term iftiqdr (impoverishment), Sahl b. 'Abdullah Tustari (d. 896) says, "No denser veil than making pretentious claims (da'wa) exists between God and the devotee. There is no closer way to God than spiritual impoverishment (iftiqdr) before Him."57 Spiritual poverty (faqr), of course, is another term for Sufism itself, which is the ultimate subject of both these couplets (7355-56). The final lines of the ghazal (7357ff.) furnish a Shi'ite theological context for the Isma'ilism of the first five couplets, containing an explicitly Shi'ite reference to 'Ali, the son-in-law of the Prophet. In sum, as a poetic melange of Isma'ili doctrines couched in Sufi allegorical imagery, this ghazal gives a good illustration of Nizari's highly original brand of Isma'ili Shi'ism infused with Sufism or Sufi Isma'Ilism imbued with Imami Shi'ism. The following lines (vv. 979-80) from another ghazal (98: 970-83) also provide a clear expression of the Isma'Ili ambience of his poetry: (979) Listen to the Lords of esoteric exegesis (arbdb-i ta'w?l)! What are all these anthropomorphic comparisons (tashbih)? One cannot find the water of life except by way of Guidance.58 (980) Yes indeed, the leader of the gnostics in the Resurrector (qa'im): But he is (not just) a Resurrector, but one whose essence is self-subsistent. The term ta wil used in verse 979 is a technical term in the Isma'ili lexicon for allegorical and esoteric interpretation of the Qur'an,59 the Isma'ilis themselves also being known as the ahl-i ta'wil: those who practice esoteric exegesis of the Qur'~n. In the second hemistich of this verse, the polarity of ta'wil and tashbih is mentioned, the doctrinal context of which alludes to the Isma'ilis' general rejection of the theological attempt to understand God by means of comparisons and analogies, an approach which led, they held, to anthropomorphism (tashbih).60 The c I LidiW Lo I Li C. 3 i ?) 5) jjjU 1</page><page sequence="11">SUFISM AND ISMA'ILI DOCTRINE IN THE PERSIAN POETRY OF NIZARI QUHISTANI 239 Isma'ilis formulated their own doctrine of a ta'wil, a secret epistemological method of scriptural analysis that is intimately bound up with the notion of absolute obedience to the Imam of the Age. Paul Walker's summary of this doctrine emphasises the theological authority of the Imam which buttresses its application: Free, personal exercise of the right to perform ta wil does not bring with it certitude; that comes only from adherence to God's divine guidance as provided on earth and in history by the lawgiving prophets and those who were chosen to stand in their place. The two doctrines are intimately related; ta'wil - the interpretative act - and nubuwwa - apostolic prophecy - are the halves of one whole. Interpretation requires authority; authority confirms interpretation.61 It is for this reason that in the same breath and verse that NizZri admonishes his reader to "listen to the masters of the esoteric exegesis (arbab-i tail)," he also claims that the living waters of divine inspiration are only fed from the stream of divine "Guidance." It is this which forms the theme of the next verse (980) - that is, the Alamfit-period NizIA-Isma'ili doctrine of the "Resur- rector" (qi'im) according to which, as Farhad Daftary explains, the "resurrection was interpreted spiritually on the basis of Isma'ili ta'wil to mean recognition of the unveiled truth in the spiritual reality of the rightful imam of the time who was none other than the Nizari Isma'ili imam."62 Thus, in the space of only two couplets, our poet admonishes his reader to follow the science of esoteric scriptural interpretation, to eschew making anthro- pomorphic comparisons based on sensory reason, and to follow the inspired Imhm's or Qa'im's guidance, without whom the entire doctrine of ta wil cannot be understood or put into practice. In such verses, the Niz-rian Isma'ili nature of Nizari's thought is beyond all doubt. In the following qasida,63 Nizari selects his audience strategically on the grounds of their being cognoscenti of his specialist Isma'ili terminology; Isma'ili lore here becomes the touchstone of real knowledge. None but adepts in the science of ta wil, he says, merit his poetical discourse: (1) I have nothing to say to anyone who doesn't know the difference between the painted image (timthal) and the symbolic representation (tamthil). (2) Do not think that (real) indigo resembles the painted image of the bride's cosmetic blue. (3) You don't possess the inner ear of the soul (the faculty of spiritual audition) and thus cannot distinguish between the trumpet of Sarafil and the blacksmith's yell ...(5) The truthful adept (muhiqq) has no fear of a party of vain falsehoods: for even the elephant is subdued by the wretched fly. (10)... To Muhammad was revealed the Qur'dn; to Moses (kalim) and Jesus (riih), the Torah and Gospels; (11) In each word of these, there lies a hundred mysteries: otherwise, what difference would exist between the words of God? (12) There must be</page><page sequence="12">240 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES a veracious interpreter who professes the truth (of these texts); otherwise there would be no difference between the esoteric exegesis (taw/l) and its literal revelation (tanzil). (13) Distinguish between the acting imam (mustawda') and the appointed imam (mustaqarr): this one subtle point comprises the whole foundation of the (science of) esoteric exegesis (ta w/l). (14) One must read what is laid down in the Scripture using the sound assets of the present moment (naqd al-waqt). How long will you prate on of Moses and Isma'il? (15) What's past was the lot of those who have passed away: enough of the tale of Cain and Abel! (16) Nizari is not himself by intent trustworthy: one should not rely merely upon goodwill. (17) Your (Nizari's) "theoretical knowledge of certitude" ('ilm al-yaqin) has become "directly perceived experiential certitude" ('ayn al-yaqin): you're free from both the literary commentary and from its exegetical exposition. While the technical terminology and imagery of Isma'ilism and Sufism blend into a melange in this qasida, the resultant pastiche is clearly more of an Isma'ili than a Sufi tinge. "I have nothing to say," he begins in the first line, "to anyone who doesn't know the difference between the painted image (timthil) and the symbolic representation (tamthil)." The distinction between the painted image (timthal) and allegorical representation (tamthil), highlighted by the poet here, alludes to the Isma'ili dichotomy between the literal word of the divine revelation (tanzil) and its allegorical exegesis (ta'wil), corresponding to the common hermeneutical distinction between a mythological symbol being taken literally, and its being interpreted as iconographic of a higher truth.64 Thus the Ismf'ili poet Nasir-i Khusraw wrote: "Positive religion (shari'at) is the exoteric aspect of the spiritual Idea (haqiqat) and the spiritual Idea is the esoteric aspect of positive religion; positive religion is the symbol (mathal), the spiritual Idea is that which is symbolised (mamthfil)."65 While this doctrine is central to Isma'ili hermeneutics, it is also by no means of marginal significance in Sufi doctrine.66 NizTri continues to emphasise the distinction between appearance and Reality in the following two verses (2, 3). Skipping down a line, we come to this couplet (5): "...The truthful adept (muhiqq) has no fear of a party of vain falsehoods: for even the elephant can be vanquished by a swarm of flies." The term muhiqq is again culled from the Isma'ili lexicon, having been applied extensively by Nasir al-Din Tusi in his Tasawwurat to the highest adepts in the Ismi'ili hierarchy who follow the Imam, roughly corresponding to the eminent position of the "gnostic ('rij)" in Sufi theosophical speculation. In the same text, Tisi also explains that while in the beginning the forces of evil and vanity appear as superior and overwhelming in force, in the end the powers of goodness and rectitude subdue them. Niz~ri's simile of the elephant tortured to death by a fly in its ear, which is a well-known topos in Persian poetry, expresses this in a suitably poetic fashion. In lines 10 and 11 the poet addresses the central subject of the poem: the esoteric basis of prophetology and scriptural hermeneutics. Although Sufis and Isma'ilis in their respective doctrines of esoteric exegesis diverge, it is a common notion in both Isma'ili and Sufi thought that the sacred scriptures have several esoteric dimensions, each of which demands a greater degree of insight than the preceding one.67 To the Isma'ilis (as Nizari in the next two verses 12 and 13 explains), the apprehension of the esoteric sense of the Qur'an depends upon the presence of the Imam's personal exegesis: it is not that his person is endowed with truth, but rather that the Truth/Haqq/God exists through his person. This stands in contrast to the Sunni Sufi perspective on the exegetical key of ta v'wl, the use of which is understood as dependent solely on denial of the self and negation of the aspirant's passions.68 The distinction between "the acting imam (mustawda')" and "the appointed imam (mustaqarr)," mentioned by the poet in line 13, relates to dichotomy between majaz and ?haqiqat, which (in the context of Islamic theology) may be translated as "appearance" vs. "reality," and (in context of rhetoric and literary theory69) as "figurative speech" vs. "veritable expression," in which respect, this couplet reinstates the timthial vs. tamthil dichotomy of the first line. The "true and real" (haqiqi) spiritual leader himself "comprises the whole foundation" - since he is the supreme exegete - of the science of esoteric Qur'anic hermeneutics, in contradistinction to the merely figurative - majizi - imim who is temporarily appointed, and able thus to present only an outward appearance of spiritual authority. In the purely historical context, the distinction between the two types of iman can be traced back to the Shi'ite Isma'ili doctrine that considers 'Ali to have been the first, and Husayn the second, imin, respectively. Husayn's brother Hasan,</page><page sequence="13">SUFISM AND ISMA'ILI DOCTRINE IN THE PERSIAN POETRY OF NIZARI QUHISTANI 241 according to Ismda'ili speculation, was just a temporary trustee (mustawda ), as distinguished from one of the "permanently appointed" Imams (mustaqarr).70 In short, the entire science of esoteric exegesis is based on imamology. In the final four lines of the poem, Nizari renders an Isma'ili gloss upon the Sufi term naqd al-waqt: "the economic assets of time," or "coin of mystical consciousness," asserting that "the sound assets of the present moment (naqd al-waqt)"71 is the basis of all Scriptural interpretation. According to many Persian Sufis, such as Rimi72 for instance, the sacred Scripture is a touchstone (mihakk) on which one must strike the coin of one's consciousness to find out if it rings true. In his manual of Sufi doctrine, the Mirsid al-'ibad, Najm al-Din Razi describes his own text as a touchstone upon which aspirants may strike the coin of their spiritual moments (naqd al-waqt) to see if they ring true.73 However, this is not the sense of the term naqd al-waqt which Nizari choses to employ in line 14. In that verse, the coin of one's consciousness refers not to the interior presential awareness of the mystic - the sense that this term usually possesses in Sufism - but rather to the living presence of the Imram. Nizari's conclusion to the qasida underlines his own spiritual realisation, which however is not an understanding that is egocentric or self-conscious in nature (hence expressed through the paradoxical claim that "Nizari is not himself by intent trustworthy") but rather experientally proven by his own direct understanding, which is here identified with the consciousness of the Imam. In another ghazal (153: 1527-37),74 also heavily steeped both in Isma'ili terminology and imagery and ideas of classical Persian Sufi love-lyricism, Nizari claims that all knowledge depends on recognising the "Imam of the Age": (1527) Vulgar Reason's foot cannot walk the Way of Love. Intellectuals are all like birds but the Way of Love the snare. (1528) Go and study well all the different sciences, then come to me, so that I can show you by way of (the) Proof (hujjat) that all of that (you've studied) is but half-baked. (1529) Anyone togged up in a turban who stands before you, you stand behind (in prayer), for "this is the Imnam". (1530) But the world is never devoid, even for a moment, of the Imam of the Age. Do not be hurt (at this) if you find it offensive; what else can I do? It is the word of the prophet's designation (nass).75 (1531) For certain, know that all health and wealth and women are forbidden for you if you don't know who the Imhan of your Age is. (1532) I'd be glad to sell that Imamat for (the price of) the candy of drunkards, for the turban on his head is in pawn to wine and cup. (1533) Since your Imin consists of two (persons), if I ask you which one of them is your Imam, what will you say in reply to me? ... (1536) All the worlds' religious judges will (be sure to) set their signature to the fatwa that "Nizari, the drunken sot, is worst among all the masses and the nobles." (1537) They have no fear of killing me, nor in cremating me (would be touched by any) smoke, but nobody's beard gives me grief, since baby's whiskers are all they wear. The poem begins by discussing the common Sufi topos of the pre-eminence of Love over Reason in the first three couplets (1527-29), before immediately</page><page sequence="14">242 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES plunging (in verses 1530-33) into a discussion of the Shi'ite-Isma'ili doctrine of the ever-living presence of the Imam. Although it is not clear whether the Imam spoken of in these four verses (1529-33) refers to the living Nizarl Isma'ili or simply the hidden Twelver Imam, it is evident that the esoteric lore of "Love" transcends the scope of exoteric Reason. Love's lore in this context signifies knowledge of the Imam. It is for this reason that he claims that (1528) "Go and study well all the different sciences, then come to me, so that I can show you by way of (the) Proof (hujjat) that all of that (you've studied) is but half-baked." In this poem, one finds the vocabulary and technical terminology of Sufi mysticism harnassed to haul the carriage of Shi'ite theology, and Sufi erotic lyricism put at the service of imamology.76 The theological context of this ghazal is clarified by another qasida (cited by Musaffa, introduction, Diwcn-i Niziri, pp. 78-81, but too long to discuss here), in which Nizari places his Isma'ili Sufism in a very clear autobiographical context as he expounds his spiritual realisation in Sufi terms, again concluding the narrative of his mystical journey with verses in praise of the "Imam of the Age" to whose authority he has submitted himself. While this overview of Nizari's Isma'ili imagery and ideas does demonstrate the extent of the poet's commitment to the Ismaili faith, it should be emphasised that the material cited so far comprises only a tiny portion of his Persian poetry. Yet from the study of these few ghazals and qasidas alone, it may be concluded that it is incorrect to say that Nizari used the vocabulary of Sufism to express Isma'ili ideas; rather it seems more accurate to say that he integrated Sufi spirituality into Isma'ili theosophy, fusing the two into an original m61ange of his own making. Before drawing any definite conclusions (VIII) about the precise contents of the melange, it will be necessary to take a closer look at Nizari's attitude towards the Sufi doctrines and symbols that fill his verse. VII. SUFI DOCTRINES AND SYMBOLS IN NIZARI'S POETRY Despite all his praise of the Imam noted in the ghazal 153 translated above, and his explicitly pronounced Isma'ili beliefs, Nizari in some places seems to give his direct support to the axiomatic Sufi doctrine of obedience to the spiritual master (pir). In his mathnawi poem Azhar u mazhar,77 composed in the final years of his life, he wrote: One must have a spiritual master (pir) adept in the mysteries, who may hold the seeker's hand, guiding his steps. One should submit and surrender oneself to him, abandoning all hope and desire. There is no degree higher than Surrender - on the condition that you do not flee from the instructions you're given. When a man surrenders himself, he sets himself aside. What type of surrender is it if he never leaves himself? These same sentiments are reiterated in his Dastifr- nama78 also composed in the final years of his life, in verses where he encourages the reader to follow a master spiritual guide (pir-i rahbar). The final verses of the poem seem to refer to this pir as being the Isma'ili Imam,79 causing a hybridisation of the two notions of tariqa guidance and imamate-directorship to occur.</page><page sequence="15">SUFISM AND ISMA'ILI DOCTRINE IN THE PERSIAN POETRY OF NIZARI QUHISTANI 243 O youth, go and seek a spiritual master to guide you (pir-i rahbar), so you make progress forward by following behind him. Give the reins of yourself over to him, and leave yourself aside, having no more concern for (your own personal) good or ill. When your surrender to him has been confirmed, you will then become an exemplar for both the worlds. Do not follow the monster of fantasy and fancy: do not become enchanted and caught like a goose in a sack. The one who has experientially verified and personally realised the truth (muhaqqiq) speaks in another manner: do not, do not rest on what is itself shaky and wobbly. Do not follow anyone but a man of God: your own rationalisations are just a monstrous brigand, not a guide. At first you will find the truthful adept (muhiqq) through God: then you will find God confirmed through the truthful adept. It is well that one should follow the imitmat, for the light of God is within his pure heart. By that light you will be freed from darkness: follow that light, and farewell! Examining NizarI's attitude towards Sufism more closely, one can see that while on the whole it is one of wholesale endorsement, occasionally he does differentiate his own Isma'ili persuasion from formal doctrinal tasawwuf His denominational distinction between Isma'ilism and Sufism is particularly visible in one ghazals80 where the Sufis are cited as a separate spiritual group from whom he differentiates himself, admonishing the reader to surrender instead to the ta'lim (teaching) of the Imam: The Sufis say: "0 you who wait in expectation, be a son of the present moment", but I am not one who would just wait in expectation. If Sufis were to accompany us - what a great trade-off! - we'll follow the bidding of the Imam, they'll follow the beck and call of self-will. So listen to this admonition from Nizari that you may be secure: submit yourself to the [Isma'ili] teachings (ta'lim) like a man. In another ghazal, Nizari describes the "perfection of Sufism" (J.- J.*JS) as gnosis (a,..), the realisation of which permits the gnostic to transcend artificial religious formalism that would insist on asserting a significant difference between wearing Muslim garments and the Christian cincture.81 There is no difference according to my religion, if you are a gnostic, whether you wear a Muslim mantle on your back, or bind a Christian cincture about your waist. Do you know in what perfection lies according to the adepts of Sufism? It lies in gnostic insight; it's not in jumping up or bowing down. But the most important poem in his corpus for illustrating his overall favourable attitude towards Sufism and his endorsement - if not actual pursuit - of its principles and practices, is the first major</page><page sequence="16">244 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES mathnawi composed by Nizari,82 the Safar-ndma,83 a travelogue composed between 678-79/1279-80. The poem revolves around three main themes: (i) long accounts of young Nizari's love affairs with various women (with interesting details as to how these affairs aided or impeded his spiritual development); (ii) his reactions, often highly critical, to the alien lands, peoples and towns that he visited; and finally, (iii) homilies in which the poet confides the deeper spiritual meaning or purport to be taken from these various autobiographical vignettes and dervish tales to the reader. Not only is the entire Safar-nacma filled with popular dervish tales that testify to Nizarl's fondness for Sufism, the poet's evident initiation into a Sufi tariqa is broached in many passages, the most interesting of which - from a biographical point of view at least - occurs at the end of the poem, where Nizari devotes several pages to writing memoirs in verse to his travelling-companions. Invariably, he invokes the Sufi Muse - the Slqi - to make an oblation of wine that he may drink to the name and the memory of his faithful friends. Many of their names mentioned still remain unidentified.84 Among these unknown personages one finds the name of a certain "supreme master of masters Amin al-Din," to whom the entire work was dedicated, whose identity, if discovered, would help illuminate, and possibly answer, the vexed question of Nizari's tariqa affiliation. In praise of this Amin al-Din, Nizari writes: From me - who wanders bewildered like a ball around the world, Convey this secret message to the master of the saints - He who is the supreme spiritual master, the revealer of the mysteries of the Truth, The substance of divine illumination, the supreme master. The second Jesus: Amin al-Din, such that The heavens bow abjectly down before his will; He is Time's sharp sword, severing away all heretical deviation, Being obedient to the command of the Lord of the world ... Since, as stated above, the Safar-nama was his first major mathnawi, composed by Nizari in his early thirties, it is probable that his acquaintance with this (his?) Sufi master began during his teens or twenties. In the beginning of the Safar-nama, the poet's close association with dervishes and absorption in Sufi spiritual practices is also clearly visible. In 678/1279, Nizari alighted in Isfahan, the first waystation of his journey, where he revisited a longtime friend and an old fellow Sufi, who encouraged him to compose a versified memoir of his travels (later to become the Safar-nidma). Here, he comments that the entire purpose of the mathnawi is to commemorate his friends and recall their friendship, "not to make mention of buildings and bath- houses.""85 The Sufi ambience of the poem is especially evident in the last line of these verses86 where he admits that both his friend and he "had worn the same Sufi mantle from the same Sufi master," that is, were fellow disciples of the same spiritual guide, demonstrating beyond all doubt his direct affiliation to a Sufi tariqa:</page><page sequence="17">SUFISM AND ISMA'ILI DOCTRINE IN THE PERSIAN POETRY OF NIZARI QUHISTANI 245 We took the road to Isfahan in order to see a friend, passages that immediately follow the above verses, the Iranshah.

His discipline was to wear contrasting his licentious behaviour - after the fashion a Sufi cloak (khirqa) of ascetic restraint and piety, of the Sufi malhmati tradition - to the devout conduct while his versification gave harmony to the pen of of his dear Sufi friend: spiritual insight.

Nizari's portrait of himself as a drunkard, of course, It is not clear who the "IrAnshah" cited by Nizari here as was pointed out in the discussion of Nizari's is. The Persian phrase is yar Irinshih (or yar-i Irdnshdh: "bacchanalia" above (IV), may be interpreted allegori- both readings suit the scansion of this particular cally as symbolic of a higher spiritual awareness. Such mathnawi metre), meaning either "a friend (called) sentiments at the very least completely typify the ethos Iranshih" or "a friend from Ir?nshdh." If we accept the of Persian Sufism, and in particular the erotic mysticism second sense, Iranshah may possibly refer to a small of poets such as Sa'di, in which the drunken ecstasy of village near Isfahan, perhaps to the well-known village the religion of love is contrasted and vaunted as of "IranshWh" in the vicinity of Khurramabad, a major superior to the "dry" puritanism of exoteric Shari'a- city between Isfahan and Kirmanshih.88 Alternatively, oriented ascetical faith.91 Nor should one expect less the poet's reference could be to "Shahanshah," a village than this sort of excess from the greatest wine-poet in a few kilometres north-west of Isfahan, or to Shahrida, the history of Persian ghazal poetry, compared to Hafiz the town south of Isfahan on the road to Abadeh, either by no less an authority than Jami. of which may have had a different name in the thirteenth The pervasive Sufi ambience of the poem also century.
