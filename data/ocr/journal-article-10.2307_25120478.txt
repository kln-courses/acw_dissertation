<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEW BOOKS REVIEWED The Place of Science in Modern Civilization, and other Essays. By Thorstein Veblen. New York: B. W. Huebsch. No other thinker, perhaps, has succeeded in being so consistently impersonal as Mr. Veblen; and this quality, so conspicuous in him, seems the more remarkable when one considers the kind of subjects with which he deals, especially in his latest set of essays. He is, to be sure, a scientist, and scientists are currently supposed to be as impersonal as it is possible for human beings to be; but the imperson ality of Mr. Veblen is greater than the impersonality of the scientists. As compared with his copious frankness, his liveliness of apprecia tion of human problems and human motives, and his arid reserve as to human values, the detachment of the average scientist seems little more than a kind of professional pose. Not for Mr. Veblen so stale a theme as the anthropomorphism of religion! Rather, he will show the lingering animism in science, the quasi-theological assumptions of political economy, the connection of Karl Marx with the Romantic Philosophers. And when he has done all this he will simply remark that there is no means of determining whether these things are in themselves good or bad. In the sense of being idly destructive, Mr. Veblen is, of course, no mere iconoclast: he is not out to abolish or even to bring into disrepute any of the systems that he criticises. But he is a great smasher of idols?idols of the cave, idols of the tribe, idols of the market place. It is at the pretensions of various systems of thought? pretensions to superior value of some kind, to being " indefeasably right and good"?that his criticism is really directed. Of modern thinkers, he alone, examines even science in a perfectly dry light; and this he is able to do by shedding upon it a light dryer than its own. Ostensibly the author in his essay upon the place of science?the first of a series of more or less related discourses contained in his latest book?is concerned in explaining the dominance of scientific thought in the modern world and the restiveness of the modern man under this dominance. He arrives at the conclusion that the peculiar reverence for the scientific mode of thinking is largely the outgrowth of a mental attitude produced by respect for machine technology, as mediaeval Christianity got part of its strength from the general respect felt for monarchial institutions, and later Puritanism perhaps reflects the ethics of the market place. He reaches the further con clusion that since the scientific discipline has been of relatively short duration, while the period of savagery has been indefinitely long, it</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS REVIEWED 425 is only natural that mankind should find the process of adjustment to the scientific point of view somewhat painful. These are the formal results. The most interesting remarks, how ever, both for the scientist and for the layman, are found by the way. For the scientist, there is the criticism that nearly all science retains in its talk of causation relics of a primitive animism; for the common reader there is the somewhat refreshing suggestion that scientific standards may not be in all respects final. " While the scientist's spirit and achievements stir an unqualified admiration in modern men, and while his discoveries carry conviction as nothing else does, it does not follow that the manner of man which this quest of knowledge produces or requires comes near answering to the current ideal of manhood, or that his conclusions are felt to be as good and beautiful as they are true. The ideal man, and the ideal of human life, even in the appre hension of those who most rejoice in the advance of science, is neither the finikin skeptic in the laboratory nor the animated slide rule." Moreover, " there is room for much more than a vague doubt that this cult of science is not altogether a wholesome growth?that the unmitigated quest of knowledge of this matter-of-fact kind, makes for race deterioration and discomfort on the whole, both in its im mediate effects upon the spiritual life of mankind, and in the material consequences that follow from a great advance in matter-of-fact knowl edge." Surely there is something inspiring in this assertion from a philosophical, though not a religious, point of view, that man may possibly be greater than his science. The greater number of the essays contained in this volume deal with political economy, and by the same token they have less signif icance for the common reader than have Mr. Veblen's disquisitions on less conventionalized subjects. For one thing, Mr. Veblen has rather less of what is new to offer in this field; or better, perhaps, it requires a trained economist to discern and value the novelty. Others, before the author, have detected and pointed out, though not with equal thoroughness, the fact that even modern schools have tended to make political economy not so much a science as a sort of compensa tory philosophy?a code embodying the common sense conception of what ought to be and of what therefore always will be in the absence of " disturbing causes." It is scarcely news that even the celebrated " historical school" did not succeed in making political economy truly scientific. For another factor, one may mention that to the average reader, questions concerning the relation of Karl Marx to Hegel on the one hand and to Darwin on the other, seem comparatively academic. The essays on the Blond Race and upon Aryan Culture are, of course, purely scientific. There is, too, in these later essays, less concerned as they are with human life as a whole, a certain falling off in the stimulating effect of Mr. Veblen's style. When the author speaks the language of protest, he manages, while maintaining a strictly correct philosophical and scientific attitude to be as enlivening as the late Elbert Hubbard. Economic discussion, however, notoriously tends to be prolix and parenthetical, and even Veblen does not wholly escape the tendency. Perhaps it was a certain tedium which made him write a sentence so egregious as the following: " If we are getting restless under the</page><page sequence="3">426 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW taxonomy of a monocotyledonous wage doctrine and a cryptogamic theory of interest, with involute, loculicidal, tomentous, and monili form variants, what is the cytoplasm, centrosome, or karyokinetic process to which wTe may turn, and in which we may find surcease from the metaphysics of normality and controlling principles ?" Cer tainly Mr. Veblen is secure from parody! But this momentary out break is not a fair sample of his style. Nor is it due to pedantry: one would call it rather a flash of Teufelsdrockhian aifectation. One would rather quote as an instance of what may be expected of Mr. Veblen now and then, a shrewd piece of literary criticism contained in his essay on Science: " Even the romancers who ostensibly re hearse the phenomena of chivalry, unavoidably make their knights and ladies speak the language and the sentiments of the slums of that time, tempered with certain schematised modern reflections and specu lations. The gallantries, the genteel inanities and devout imbecilities of medieval high-life would be insufferable even to the meanest and most romantic modern intelligence." One cannot help wondering whether Mr. Veblen himself knows what an excellent literary quality his writings have, and what a boon to the jaded reader is the absence in his work of certain conventional literary virtues?solemnity, geniality, sonority, and the like. Since he writes in large part for technical journals, it is probable that many readers who would find him a kindred spirit have never made his acquaintance. Technical, to some extent, many of his writings of course are, and none of them are offered as " popular science." But even when he is most technical, his obiter dicta are often of more interest than another man's whole theory, and there is always a chance that any book of Veblen's may prove to be a wonderful " find " for some particular reader of the kind classed as " average."</page></plain_text>
