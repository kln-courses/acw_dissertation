Strong evidence has been accumulated that they even share an innate concept of the structure of living world. People possessing very distant cultures and different levels of scientific knowledge are able to name and categorize animal species in a very similar way (Berlin 1992) employing universal principles (Berlin et al. 1973). Even young children view animal categories as objectively defined (Rhodes and Gelman 2009), and these are less influenced by linguistic and cultural factors than human or artefact categories (see review Diesendruck 2003). Humans devote considerably more attention to animals as opposed D. Frynta (El) • J. Marešová • M.

People also inherently tend to affiliate with other species (e.g. the "biophilia" theory) and employ aesthetic judgements in their attitude to animals (Thornhill 1993). Animals are vital stimuli to humans, and adaptive explanations are readily available. Particular emotional and perceptual mechanisms may be inherited from early humans, whose fitness and social status increased with possession and identification of certain animals or their body parts. Our ancestors thus may have developed an adaptive sense of "animal attractiveness" and preference to animal species that became part of the human mind before geographic and cultural diversification of our kind (Barkow et al. 1992). To test this hypothesis we study aesthetic preferences within an integral taxonomie group, boid snakes, in several distant cultures: Bolivia, Philippines, India - Rajasthan and Delhi, Malawi and Morocco, and compare them to our previous results from the Czech Republic and Papua New Guinea (Marešová et al. 2009a and new data). So far only a few studies on human attitude to animal species have been conducted cross-culturally and they focused mostly on negative emotions such as fear and disgust (Davey et al. 1998). Moreover, animals representing distant taxa were compared with each other (e.g. a leech versus a bat). We chose boid snakes to test human preferences within a coherent animal group because they vary in appearance (color and pattern), and lack anthropomorphic features that are known to modify human preferences. Importantly, snakes represent valid biological stimuli; according to Isbell (2006) snakes, especially the constrictors, were the primary source of prédation in early primate evolution. Large constrictors still represent a potential threat to members of some indigenous cultures and snakes in general Springer</page><page sequence="2">830 Hum Ecol (201 1) 39:829-834 belong to the most feared animals (Arrindell 2000; Davey 1994; Morris 1967). Despite that, humans are consistently able to provide two independent rankings of the same set of snake species - that of perceived beauty and evoked fear. These rankings are not mutually correlated (Landová et al. 2011) and therefore snakes can be considered as valid objects of beauty assessment as any other animal group without emotional connotations. We have previously found a striking agreement between European and Papuan respondents in their preferences to boid snakes (Marešová et al. 2009a). Surprisingly, we found that species' ranking was not influenced by the fact that some of the tested species are distributed in Papua New Guinea and local participants very likely had direct experience with them and with other snake species. However, the examination of more cultures was required to test the hypothesis about the universality of human aesthetic preferences to animals. The aim of this paper is to test the hypothesis that the aesthetic ranking of snake species is broadly shared among human cultures. In that case, the main axis of aesthetic preferences would be similar across humankind despite very substantial cultural differences. Materials and Methods As stimuli we used 32 photographs of boas and pythons, each depicting a representative adult individual of its species. The selection was carried out to cover maximum diversity in appearance within the taxa. Photographed individuals were borrowed from private keepers and zoos or belonged to the authors' collections. In the case of rare species, photographs were adopted from a book (Walls 1998a, b). In comparable experiments with animal aesthetics photographs were proved to fully substitute for live snakes (Landová et al. 2011). To standardize the photographs, all snake bodies were set on black background regardless of the snake's real size and printed in format 10x15 cm. Although we attempted to photograph the snakes in a comparably packed position, the posture (the extent and way of curling the body) was impossible to standardise. However, neither posture nor within-species variation affected resulting ranks when tested in Europe (Marešová and Frynta 2008). People from Bolivia (24 men and 6 women from Cochabamba, mean age 22 years), Philippines (46 men and 28 women, mostly from Bohol, mean age 34 years), Delhi in India (14 men and 10 women, mean age 28 years), Rajasthan in India (32 men and 25 women, mean age 31 years), Morocco (10 men and 9 women, villagers from South East of the country, mean age 19 years) and Malawi (23 men and 16 women from the South of the country, mean age 28 years) participated in the experiment. Corresponding results from the Czech Republic (63 male and 61 female undergraduate students, mean age 21 years) and Papua New Guinea (63 men and 20 women from villages in Madang and Chimbu provinces, mean age 25 years) were compared (Marešová et al. 2009a and new data for the Czech Republic). Respondents voluntarily agreed to participate in the project. Each participant was shown a set of 32 photographs in a random assemblage and received following instructions "Please, sort the photo- graphs in rank order corresponding to the beauty of the depicted snake from the most beautiful to the least beautiful one". The order of the photographs in the pack was then coded by numerals from 1 (the most beautiful one) to 32, hereafter referred to as ranks. In most cultures the respondents tent to discuss the stimuli in the way that indicated that they viewed the snakes as living creatures rather than just colorful images. The ranks provided by individual respondents were divided by 32 and square root arcsin transformed to achieve normal distribution and further used as measures of perceived beauty. Most computations were performed in STATISTICA (StatSoft 2001); effect of sex and ethnic group was tested in MANOVA and partial correlations of individual populations were computed in Discriminant Función Analysis (DFA). Congruence among respondents was quantified by Kendall's coefficient of concordance (W, ranges from 0 to 1), a non-parametric test traditionally used for ordinal data. The contribution of individual ethnic groups to the cross-cultural variability was examined and visualised in Redundancy Analysis (RDA) as implemented in CANOCO (ter Braak and Smilauer 2002). Results The respondents agreed on which species are beautiful and which are ugly (Kendall's coefficient of concordance: W, df=31; Bolivia: W=0.142; Czech Republic: W=0.329; Delhi: W=0.109; Rajasthan: W=0.146; Morocco: W= 0.111; Malawi: W=0.226; Philippines: W=0.200; Papua New Guinea: W=0.193; all /?&lt;0.001). MANOVA revealed small, but significant effect of population (F(155 999)=1.27, P=0.021), and no effects of sex (P=0.236) and their interaction (P=0.476). This result allowed us to pool sexes in further analyses. Multivariate test (DFA) revealed only two significant partial compar- isons between populations: Malawi differed from both Rajasthan (F31)2o7=2.21, Р&lt;0.001) and Philippines (Рз1,207=1-84, /*=0.007). Mean beauty measures of pooled data were closely correlated with those reported in our previous paper (Marešová et al. 2009a and new data) from Papua New Guinea (r=0.94, P&lt;0.001; Fig. 1) and Europe (Czech Republic, r=0.74, P&lt;0.001; Fig. 2).

Nevertheless, the first three multivariate axes reflecting between population differences accounted for only 4%, 0.5% and 0.3% of variation, respectively (compare with 16.7%, 12.1% and 9.8% explained by corresponding PCA axes referring to between-individual agreement). The projection of populations into the RDA axes revealed that the European results (Czech Republic) contribute the most to cross-cultural differences (Fig. 3). When this population was excluded, the contribution of the first three canonical axes dropped to 1.4%, 0.7% and 0.4% of variation, respectively, but still remained significant (F= Fig. 2 Relationship between mean measures of perceived beauty of the pooled data (Bolivia, Delhi, Malawi, Morocco, Philippines and Rajasthan) and corresponding values obtained in Europe (Marešová et al. 2009a and new data).

Next, Pearson correlation coefficients following leave one sample out procedure were computed to quantify similarities of snake ranking across studied populations. Mean measures of perceived beauty in each particular population/ethnic group were correlated with corresponding measures computed from the pooled remaining data; alternatively, only non-European data were included (Table 1). All resulting correlations were close, positive and statistically significant (all /*&lt;0.001). The lowest coefficients of determination were found in the case of the smallest data set (Morocco; 19 respondents): 0.51 and 0.57 for all and non-European data, respectively.

They differ in their uses and perceptions of their local habitats as well as vary in their knowledge and general attitudes regarding snakes. They also vary greatly in direct experience with snakes. The species tested exhibit a great variety of colors and patterns, perception of which is known to be modulated through linguistic categories (for colors: Kay and Regier 2007; Roberson et al. 2000; for animal patterns: Goldstein and Davidoff 2008). Moreover, the meaning of colors and their emotional charge may also be culturally dependent. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that ethnic groups will at least slightly differ in their perception and appreciation of these species of animals. Our results confirm this intuitive assumption but also show evidence of considerable cross-cultural similarities in aesthetic preferences to snakes species. Observed congru- ence seems to be consistent with the theory that snakes are exceptionally strong aesthetic stimuli for all or most humans and/or we share a considerable component of aesthetic preferences to certain living kinds on a fine taxonomie scale. However, we have to consider an alternative explanation that the revealed cross-cultural congruence applies to aesthetic preferences irrespective of the nature of the objects evaluated. Specifically designed experiments are needed to be able to weigh these competing hypotheses. Nonetheless, studies on the aes- thetics of commercial products often report significant cultural differences (e.g. Limon et al. 2009; Pearce et al. 2010). Thus, we do not wish to over generalize our results and prefer a more constrained interpretation that humans share a deep rooted emotional concept of animals and follow common cues when judging their aesthetics. This may increase the cross-cultural agreement. Regardless the cause, the revealed cross-cultural congruence in aesthetic preferences is substantial and non-trivial. The phylogenetic interpretation of such a pattern is congruent with the idea that the preference has remained unchanged during last dozens of thousands of years, i.e. the period characterized by a rapid cultural, technological and ecological diversifi- cation of human kind. The congruence among respondents within an individual culture was highly significant in all cases, and its level varied within expected limits (Marešová et al. 2009b). The small cross-cultural differences that we revealed are dependent on the statistical method used and hard to quantify. Despite that, there are a few reasonably robust observations. Europe seems to be a likely candidate for the most distinct perception of snake aesthetics. Measures of perceived beauty obtained in the Czech Republic correlated with the pooled data relatively loosely (Table 1) and its significant contribution to the cross-cultural variability is Springer</page><page sequence="5">Hum Ecol (201 1) 39:829-834 833 clearly shown in the RDA projection (Fig. 3). We may speculate that European participants differ from other populations in their minimal direct encounters with live snakes), while they may be the most influenced by media. The overall lowest coefficient of determination was found in Moroccan data set and probably results from the small number of respondents (Table 1). This was followed by Rajasthan where respondents disagreed the most with European participants (Table 1 and Fig. 3). Independently of the method used Bolivia, Papua New Guinea and Philippines form one very coherent group which might be an interesting result inviting further research. When judging the importance of detected cross-cultural differences, it is useful to compare them with the relatively high inter- individual differences that may be caused by personality, individual experience, mistakes or other factors not con- trolled for. Our findings are not only important for better under- standing of human perception of other species but they may also have implications for conservation practice. People across cultures seem to infer values from external features, often applying the rule "what is beautiful is good" (Dion et al. 1972), e.g. customers across cultures make assumptions about the nature and quality of products from their packages (Limon et al. 2009). Similar perceptual shortcuts seems to apply to our apprehension of other living kinds. Attractiveness is an important determinant in perceptions of endangered species (Gunnthorsdottir 2001; Knight 2008), and people more willingly allocate funds for conservation of species that they like (Martin-Lopez et al. 2007). Taxonomie bias has also been documented in conservation research literature (Clark and May 2002). Present conser- vation resources are extremely limited with respect to the number of threatened or endangered species, and we can view animal's appearance as a package that they bring to a highly competitive market. In case of boid snakes, human preferences are a good predictor of conservation efforts devoted to captive breeding of particular species in zoos worldwide, unlike its conservation status or present range size (Marešová and Frynta 2008). Similar evidence has been brought in case of parrot species (Frynta et al. 2010) and other vertebrate taxa (Frynta et al. 2009). If we assume that we inherently share an idea of what is beautiful and desirable in an animal, it is easy to imagine selective support or neglect of endangered species. It would affect ongoing anthropogenous macroevolutionary processes thereby influencing the composition of future biota.
