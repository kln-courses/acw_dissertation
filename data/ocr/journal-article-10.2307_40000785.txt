Pp. 191, 831 black and white illustrations, 2 unnumbered col. pls. Editions des Musses Nationaux, Paris, 1972. The Musee du Louvre possesses an outstanding collection of ancient Egyptian toilet objects. This collection is notable for its size as well as for the high artistic quality of many of its individual pieces. Until recently, however, much of the collection remained unpublished and known only to those scholars who visited Paris. In 1967 Ingrid Wallert published a number of the Louvre's toilet spoons in her study of this class of toilet objects,1 while in 1968 Birgit Nolte included the Louvre's glass vases in her monograph on Egyptian glass vessels.2 We now have in Mme. Vandier's book a profusely illustrated catalogue of some 831 toilet objects in the Louvre, including cosmetic spoons; toilet boxes; kohl tubes and sticks ; kohl pots ; stone, wood, shell, and faience vessels; small anthropomorphic and zoomorphic vases; mortars and pestles; combs; hairpins; razors; mirrors; and perfume vases (principally of glass). Palettes have been excluded. The Louvre's collection has been built up over the past century and a half primarily through gifts and purchases. A much smaller number of objects were acquired from various excavations, such as those of Weill at Tuneh el-Gebel and Zawiyet el- Meitin; Bruyere at Deir el-Medineh; from the 1 Wallert, Der Verzierte Loffel.

Most of the collection, however, came to the Louvre in the nineteenth century from such famous sources as the Salt collection (1826), the Drovetti collection (1827), the purchases of Cham- pollion (1830), and the collections of Clot Bey (1852), Anastasi (1857), and Tyskiewicz (1862). In the present century a large group of toilet vases came to the Louvre from the Curtis collection (1944), while gaps in the collection have been filled in through judicious purchases. The objects in this catalogue are numbered OT (Objets de Toilette) 1-831 and are arranged typo- logically. Each entry includes the museum number, a brief description, dimensions, material, present condition, date, provenience, and bibliography (sometimes only select). One or more black and white photographs at 1 : 2 scale are usually provided for each object. In addition eleven of the more interesting pieces are reproduced on two color plates at the beginning of the book. The black and white photographs are generally adequate, though occa- sionally the photograph is either too dark, in- sufficiently clear, or too small to allow specific details to be made out (see, e.g., the photographs for nos. 126, 133, 244, 363, and 558). In one case (no. 770), the photograph was badly cropped and the end of the inscription cut off. The book's jacket states that this catalogue was written both for the Egyptologist and the non- specialist. In aiming to accomodate both groups of readers, however, I think that Mme. Vandier has found herself between the proverbial Scylla and Charybdis. The non-Egyptologist will be attracted to this book for the outstanding quality and variety of the objects. At the same time, however, he will probably find himself handicapped in using the book by virtue of its lack of chronological charts,3 3 The uninitiated reader may further be confused by a lack of a uniform chronological terminology. For example, one object is called "Ramesside" (no. 155), while others (e.g., nos. 608-611) are dated "XIX-XXe dynastie." Similarly, some objects are dated to the "Saite" Period (e.g., nos. 586, 587, 571), while others are dated to the "XXVIe dynastie" (e.g., nos. 382- 392). Surely the non-Egyptologist will be baffled by the date "fin du Moyen Empire (XVI Ie dynastie)" for object no. 733, when the other post-Twelfth Dynasty, pre-New Kingdom objects in the catalogue are dated to the "2e Periode intermediate" (e.g., nos. 296-303). maps, translations of the inscriptions (which are simply given in hand-copy),4 indexes, or a good, general bibliography for further research. Inasmuch as the book has only a short introduction followed directly by the catalogue, there are no discussions, however brief, about the history and development of any class of objects, and only a few, minimal statements of the probable function. On the other hand, the principal complaint which the Egyptologist will have about the book concerns the dating of the objects, the only really subjective part of each entry. Because of the nature of the collection, the dating of the uninscribed material in this catalogue is dependent upon typological and stylistic comparisons with dated material from con- trolled excavations. However, neither the evidence for the date of an object nor any comparative material is cited in the catalogue. Anyone interested in the date of a specific object must therefore research that piece himself in order to confirm or reject the date provided by Mme. Vandier. Such an investigation not infrequently uncovers discrepancies between the date assigned by Mme. Vandier and that given to the same or similar objects by other authorities. One must also be wary of unnecessarily broad dates or no dates at all. Note, for example, the dates given to four stone cosmetic jars with bulbous bodies and tall necks, which are included in this book under nos. 458-459, 461, and 466. Mme. Vandier dates nos. 458 and 459 to the "Nouvel Empire/' no. 461 to the "XVI I Ie dynastie," and no. 466 is left undated. Yet Petrie maintains that no stone vessels of this general type occur outside the reigns of Hatshepsut and Tuthmosis III,5 and I do not know of any examples which need be dated later than the middle of the Eighteenth Dynasty. Another example of a discrepancy in dating occurs with a glass krater (no. 812 in the present catalogue), which Nolte6 dates to her "Werkkreis 3," approxi- mately the time of Amenophis III-IV, but which Mme. Vandier (without giving a reason) dates to Tuthmosis III. Mme. Vandier may have excellent reasons for assigning many of the dates she does, 4 Such translation would have been particularly useful in those cases where the identification of a receptacle's contents is inscribed on the vessel. 5 Petrie, Stone and Metal Vases (bound with The Funeral Furniture of Egypt) (London, 1937), I3Â» cf- pl.

Notwithstanding the above criticisms, I think that Mme. Vandier has produced here a book of great interest to both the Egyptologist and the general reader. It conveniently brings together in one publication a large number of objects of related function with good, basic descriptions of each piece, and provides adequate if not exciting photographs of the material. Hopefully the book will serve as a stimulus for further research on the subject of Egyptian toilet objects. James Weinstein The University Museum, Philadelphia</page></plain_text>
