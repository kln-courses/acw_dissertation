<plain_text><page sequence="1">17 Lament and Recognition: A Reconsideration of the Ending of the Bacchae CHARLES SEGAL Accompanied (at least in imagination) by the drams that belong to their worship of Dionysus (124-25), the chorus of Asian Bacchants in the parodos sets the mood for what is probably the most exciting and most shocking of extant Greek tragedies. The climax of the excitement is the entrance of Agave holding in her hands the bloody head of the son she has torn apart (1168-99). The play ends, in Euripides' manner, with Dionysus as deus ex machina, predicting the future of the protagonists and probably of his own cult at Thebes. The play grips us with the troubling power of its god, "most terrible but most gentle to mortals" (860-61). Dionysus is present throughout in a way in which no other divinity is in the extant plays, for not only does he speak, in propria persona, in both prologue and epilogue (itself unique in the corpus), but in his role as the Lydian stranger he is also a major participant in the action.1 Bringing closure to these extraordinary events must have been one of the great challenges facing the poet.2 For the modern interpreter the problem is compounded by a gap in the text near the end of the play. In this essay I shall reexamine the problem of the fragmentary ending from the perspective of two of the major components of closure in tragedy, lament and recognition. Euripides' ending, in so far as it can be restored, leaves open the ambiguities surrounding Dionysus and his cult and thereby sets into relief the problems that Greek tragedy, and particularly Euripidean tragedy, repeatedly confronts: the cruelty or appropriateness of divine justice, the distance separating gods and mortals, and the gap between divine and mortal perspectives. The Bacchae poses these problems in a way that reflects its main concern, the nature of Dionysus and his place in the polis. 1 In other surviving Euripidean plays where a god appears in both prologue and epilogue, as in Hippolytus and Ion, it is not the same god. The Hippolytus offers the closest parallel, with its marked symmetry between prologue and epilogue (on which see Dunn 1996: 89-91), but even so the divinities are different. 2 For various techniques of closure in Greek tragedy, and especially Euripidean tragedy, including the use of the deus ex machina, see Dunn 1996 passim, esp. 3-83.</page><page sequence="2">274 Illinois Classical Studies 24-25 (1999-2000) Agave's return to sanity in her recognition of her actions (anagnorisis) answers her failed anagnorisis of Pentheus at his death and so is an obvious step toward closure, especially as it brings Cadmus back to the stage and so makes visible the ruin of the Theban royal house across three generations.3 Yet the play does more than just effect the mortal protagonists' recognition of the meaning of their actions. As in other plays (notably Hippolytus and Ion), Euripides brings gods and mortals together in a confrontation that explores the problems of anthropomorphic divinity. "It is not fitting for gods to become like mortals in their anger," Cadmus feebly protests at the end (1348). To this theological dimension of the closing scene Euripides adds a more emotional element, namely a lament shared between the suffering mortal survivors. Lament is a traditional way of ending tragedy, sanctioned by the example of the end of the Iliad, and Euripides uses it frequently as a closural device (Hippolytus, Andromache, Suppliants, Trojan Women, Phoenissae, and—in a negative way—Medea). A formal lament is an obvious ending for Bacchae, as the mutilated body of Pentheus is prominent on stage in the final scene. As in Hippolytus and Trojan Women, the burial of the torn remains is indispensable for a proper closure, both emotional and ritual. Here as elsewhere, however, closure through ritual lament only sets into relief the pain of human suffering and injustice that remains unresolved.4 The importance of lament in the Bacchae is obscured by the sadly fragmentary state of the text, with its lacunae (or lacuna) at the point when the other two principal characters come together over the body of the dead king. How we understand the ending depends in large part on the restoration of the fragmentary ending. I argue, against Dodds (1960), that Agave's lament over the body of Pentheus, accompanied by her piecing together of his torn limbs (the compositio membrorum), takes place in the first lacuna, after 1300, rather than in the second, after 1329. Cadmus' briefer and less spectacular lament (1308-26) then follows upon Agave's. Taken together, the two laments, in this sequence, complement one another as characteristic modes of female and male mourning in the polis. Agave's lament is intensely physical, Cadmus' more reflective and more oriented toward the public realm and civic values of honor and justice. This closing movement also frames the ending in terms of tragic recognition or anagnorisis (see 1282, 1296, 1345-46), which includes Cadmus' questioning of the god's vengeance. Each protagonist's necessary and painful awakening from the joyful but also destructive ecstasy of maenadic 31 agree with Seaford 1993: 138; 1994: 309 and 344 ff.; 1996a: 47-50 that the destruction of the royal family is of fundamental importance for the meaning of the play, but for reasons different from his; see below, note 19. 4 See C. P. Segal 1993: Ch. 1 and 2, esp. 22-33, and C. P. Segal 1996a passim.</page><page sequence="3">Charles Segal 275 ritual shows how Euripides uses Dionysus and Dionysiac cult for his recurrent meditation on divine justice and on human freedom and its limits. I As is well known, the evidence for the lost portions of the ending includes a few remarks and quotations from later ancient authors, particularly the third-century CE rhetorician Apsines; the Christus Patiens (henceforth CP), a (probably) twelfth-century Byzantine play about the Passion of Christ, once attributed to Gregory the Great; and some scraps of a papyrus codex from Antinoe of the fifth century CE, published some forty years ago. One line of that papyrus (fr. ii b verso, 4, in Diggle's OCT) contains the syllables TiA.OKia(xev . .., which is plausibly part of the rare word KaxriXoKia^eva and so seems to confirm that CP 1471-72 does indeed echo our play: "I cover your blood-spattered limbs, torn in furrows (Katr|^.OKio|ieva), with my fresh robes." From the calculation of the number of lines per page in the codex, Dodds concluded that the missing portion of the text would have to be "at least fifty lines long" and so preferred to place the compositio membrorum after 1329, on the grounds that a speech of fifty-plus lines by Agave after 1300 would be too long (p. 244). But, with due respect to Dodds, a fifty line speech by Agave after 1300 is by no means improbable.5 Hecuba's lament over the shattered body of Astyanax at the end of the Trojan Women occupies some sixty lines (Tro. 1156-1215); and for the Bacchae passage one has to allow also for some preliminary description by Cadmus, dialogue between Cadmus and Agave, and possible remarks by the chorus. The papyrus does not offer much certain help with the lacunae, but it does enhance the likelihood that CP 1471-72 are indeed from the Bacchae, and this in turn also increases the probability of an on-stage compositio membrorum. The exchange surrounding the first lacuna is as follows (1298-1301): Ay. xõ &lt;piA.xaxov õe aa&gt;na nov naiSõq, rcaxep; Ka. eyd) po/Uq x68' E^epEuvr)aa&lt;; cpepw.

Roberts, the editor of the Antinoe fragment, here cited by Dodds, drew just the opposite conclusion from the papyrus and preferred to place the compositio membrorum after 1300. Some of Dodds' supplements to the papyrus text are hypothetical in the extreme; see Diggle's note ad loc. in the OCT.</page><page sequence="4">276 Illinois Classical Studies 24-25 (1999-2000) Ag. But what share in my madness pertained to Pentheus? If Agave merely handles or caresses the torn but already recomposed body, Cadmus' reply was something like, "Yes, it is all closed together, for we gathered the bloody parts scattered over the stones and trees and bushes. But you still hold the head in your hands." Agave, then, amid renewed tears, places the head on the corpse and enters upon her formal lament. If, on the other hand, she does recompose the body, Cadmus replies something like, "No (it is not all closed up together), for you and your sisters left the limbs scattered far and wide; but, in so far as we could, we have brought them together; and here are the torn pieces on this bier." Agave and Cadmus then join in piecing the fragments together, and she lays in place the head, which she has been carrying. She then covers the head with a veil and the rest of the body with "fresh robes" (CP 1470-72), perhaps brought on stage by an attendant from the palace. The difference between the two reconstructions lies ultimately in the degree of the horror, and it is not surprising that interpreters have balked at the more gruesome alternative of the on-stage compositio membrorum.6 Is such an ending too outrageous even for late Euripides? Not, I think, after the ending of Orestes (408 BCE). If we are to believe Apsines, Euripides has given a sensationally grisly twist to the lament over a brutally torn corpse: In Euripides Agave, mother of Pentheus, having passed beyond her madness and having recognized her own son now torn apart, accuses herself and arouses pity. .. In this passage Euripides' wish was to arouse pity for Pentheus, and he has in fact aroused it, for the mother holding each of his limbs in her hands laments over each of them. (Text in Diggle 1994a: 352) It is instructive to compare Euripides' scene with the lament of Tecmessa in Sophocles' Ajax (896-973) or of Hecuba in Euripides' Trojan Women (1156-1237). Both of these plays show the body on stage and describe the physical ugliness of the wounds, but neither body is torn to bits nor requires the handling or adjusting of the parts as in Agave's lament. On either reconstruction of Agave's lament, she would conclude with a final, tearful view of the body as she covers it with a veil or shroud (CP 1470 72). Cadmus then says something like, "My miserable daughter, I pity you, but such is the cruel madness that Dionysus sent upon you." Agave 6 For example, Willink 1966: 44-46 argues that Agave merely handles the limbs. For a review of scholarship, see Seaford 1996a: on lines 1300-01; Ieran6 1999: xxvii-xxviii; Roux 1970-72: II 613-15, on line 1300. It remains an open question whether Seneca is drawing on Euripides' lost compositio membrorum in Theseus' recomposition of his son's mangled body at the end of his Phaedra (1247-74). Seneca may, of course, be putting his own characteristic stamp on the Euripidean material. On the negative side too is the lack of any mention of this scene from the First Hypothesis of the Bacchae\ but this summary of the play contains a number of textual corruptions and is perhaps itself fragmentary toward the end. I review the evidence in Segal and Gibbons 2000: Appendix.</page><page sequence="5">Charles Segal 277 responds with line 1301, where our text resumes, "But what share in my folly pertained to Pentheus?" She asks this question in her continuing self accusation, which, as Apsines remarked, accompanies her recomposition of the body. With the deepened understanding that comes in the course of her lament, she shifts from blaming Dionysus, as she does in her anagnorisis of 1296 ("Dionysus destroyed us; now I understand"), to blaming herself and her "folly" (dcppoa-uvri) in 1301. In his reply Cadmus explains Pentheus' guilt (1302): "He was like you and your sisters in not revering the god," whereupon he moves into his briefer and less violent lamentation (1308— 26). I leave aside the problem of the possible piecing together of Pentheus' body on stage and return to the question of whether this lament by Agave occurred in the first lacuna, after 1300, or after the second, after 1329. Or, in other words, did her lament precede or follow the lament of Cadmus at 1308-26? It must, I think, precede, for Agave, on discovering that her hunting trophy is Pentheus' head, will want to deposit this in its proper place as soon as possible. It is hard to imagine that, confronted with Pentheus' torn and headless body in 1300, she does not think at once of replacing the head. Could Cadmus pronounce his formal funeral eulogy over that body in 1308-24 with Agave standing beside him holding the severed head in her hands? I think not.7 Agave's inquiry about the body and its condition in 1298-1300 (cited above) forms an easy transition into her lament (with or without the compositio membrorum). Her entrance with Pentheus' head at the beginning of the scene (1200)—another extraordinary coup de theatre—has alerted the audience to the grisly scene that follows. The line-by-line dialogue of the "psychotherapy scene," in which Cadmus gradually brings Agave back to sanity and reality, leads inexorably to her readiness to confront the consequences of her actions.8 First she recognizes the head (1284), then asks who was the killer and, amid the pounding of her heart (1288), receives the chilling reply, "You killed him, along with your sisters" (1289). Her exclamation of recognition at 1296, "Dionysus destroyed us; now I understand," shows her moral readiness and growing strength for the experience that she must now undergo. When she next asks (1298), "Where then, father, is the dearest body of my child?" she is fully prepared to face this most visible and horrible sign of her madness. Cadmus' response, "I have searched it out with difficulty and am bringing it" (1299), is a cue that directs attention to the body. One can even envisage some stage action here, such as the attendants (mentioned at 1216-17) moving forward the bier on or from the eccyclema. 7 On this point, see also Roux 1970-72: II 613-14, on line 1300; Seaford 1996a: 250, on lines 1300-01. 8 See Devereux 1970.</page><page sequence="6">278 Illinois Classical Studies 24-25 (1999-2000) Dodds argues that line 1301, after the lacuna, "But what share in my madness pertained to Pentheus?" "seems to belong more naturally to an earlier stage, at which Agaue is still trying to get the facts clear" (1960: 232, on line 1300). But the line makes equal sense as part of a movement back from the intense emotion of her lament, with its awful physical contact with the body, to a growing understanding of Dionysus' punishment. The line thus helps effect a transition to the more restrained mood first of Cadmus' lament and then of Dionysus' prophecy. It also shows Euripides continuing to hammer away at the cruelty of the god's revenge, as the two mortal protagonists struggle to understand it and come to terms with it (1295-97, 1301, 1344-50, 1373-78). II In lamenting over her son's body, Agave, as one would expect from a mother, is intensely physical. She handles and touches the torn body, perhaps caresses and kisses it, probably refers to having given birth and nursed Pentheus (see CP 1256-57, below); and she finally covers the corpse with a robe or veil (CP 1123, 1470-72), much as Tecmessa, for example, covers the body of Ajax (Soph. Ajax 915-16) or Hecuba does that of Astyanax in the Trojan Women (1218-20). We may, for instance, compare oioiq T£ ninkoiq ko.to.ko.\xi\\k£&gt; veicuv; (Mary theotokos in CP 1123, "With what robes shall I cover the corpse?") and uXka viv rceputruxei / tpapei KaW&gt;v|/co xcp5e 7ta|4,jtr|6T|v (Tecmessa in Soph. Ajax 915-16, "But I shall cover him completely with this enfolding robe"). This touching and embracing of the corpse constitute part of the women's traditional "joy in lamentation," as Homer described it in the Iliad (e.g. 22. 86-89, 352-53). When Priam returns with the ransomed body of Hector, for example, Hecuba and Andromache, who, as mother and wife are the first to mourn, tear their hair and "lay hold of the head" (Iliad 24. 710 11). In Euripides' Suppliants the mothers of the Argive dead are eager to "take into (their) hands" the bodies of their sons (e|xav iq %epa, 60-62), even though, as Theseus later cautions Adrastus, "these women would be destroyed (oXoivto .. . av) when they see [their sons] here so changed" (,Suppl. 944). "Yes," agrees Adrastus, "for the blood and wounds of the dead are a bitter sight" (945; cf. Soph. Ajax 915-19, 922 f., 1003-05). Pentheus' body on the stage, reminding us of its dismembered state, gives a special pathos and horror to these conventional female gestures of mourning. If CP 1312 reflects Agave's lament, she asks, "How shall I, miserable that I am, take him to my breast, and in what way shall I make the dirge (threnos) over him?" At some point too, she (or Cadmus) declares that these rites bring "but little comfort to the dead" (CP 1449). If she cradles the head (or other body parts) in her hands as part of this lament, she will be gruesomely fulfilling on stage the Stranger's prophecy that Pentheus "will be carried in his mother's arms" (ev %epai (xriTpoq) in a "luxurious</page><page sequence="7">Charles Segal 279 delight" (Kai tpucpav n' avaYKaaeu;), where the word "luxury," Tpucpri, contains an untranslatable play on the word's root meaning, "breaking in pieces," 0pu7tx£iv (968-70).9 Both Agave's and Cadmus' laments are distorted forms of their respective genres and thus continue the play's perversion of all of its ritual actions. The mother who would wash, embrace, and kiss the body is the killer whose insane violence has reduced the body to the fragmented state that makes her last offices as ugly to ancient as to modern taste. Cadmus, on the other hand, pronounces the kind of funeral eulogy that would be appropriate for a king or warrior slain in battle. Hence he emphasizes the achievements of the deceased and invokes moral terms like justice and punishment (1308-12). This pairing of male and female lament as a closing movement is not uncommon in Greek tragedy. Closest in date to the Bacchae are the Phoenissae and the Oedipus at Colonus. Closest in dramatic function, however, is the ending of Sophocles' Antigone, whose male protagonist, as has often been noted, has some affinities with Pentheus. Eurydice's lament is a private, house-oriented grief, oikeion penthos, as she says; but, contrary to the Messenger's anxious hope {Ant. 1246-50; cf. 1187), its dangerous resonances do not remain indoors.10 Both Eurydice's and Creon's laments, in different ways, are characteristically tragic perversions of threnodic utterance. Eurydice has carried her woman's grief outside the house and has expressed it in the most destructive possible form. Creon, the ruler devoted to civic order, is totally crushed as he laments over a son who perished not on the field of battle but in the cavern where his beloved was condemned to die as a criminal, with all the anti-polis associations of that Hades-like place. The two laments, each awry in its own way, work together to frame the tragedy in terms of the collapse of the hierarchical relation of oikos and polis which Creon had so vehemently championed. In the Bacchae, to be sure, the contrast between public and private (or civic and domestic) lament is much less important than in Antigone, where it is an essential part of the conflict between the two protagonists. Yet in the Bacchae also a civic conflict (receiving the new god into the polis) finds its tragic outcome in private suffering and in destruction for the house after a king has been stripped of his public, authoritarian persona. In both plays also a drastic disruption of polis-oikos relations derives from a female rejection of male authority.11 In both cases a mother's lament gives intense expression, on the stage, to the tragic suffering and is juxtaposed to a male lament. Cadmus' lament over Pentheus, like Creon's over Haemon, has 9 See Kepple 1976 and C. P. Segal 1997a: 201-02. 10 On this passage, see C. P. Segal 1995: Ch. 5, esp. 120-33. 11 On oikos-polis relations in the Bacchae, see Seaford 1993 passim; also Seaford 1994: 344-62, esp. 353-55.</page><page sequence="8">280 Illinois Classical Studies 24-25 (1999-2000) associations with the funeral eulogy pronounced over a fallen warrior, with ironical overtones in both cases. As in the Antigone, the woman's lament has the more intensely physical and emotional expression. Creon and Cadmus lament in words; Eurydice nearly collapses into the arms of her attendants (Ant. 1188-89) and later drives a sword into her own body (1301-05, 1315-16). Agave handles the body parts of the son she has murdered. In both cases the public recognition implicit in the lament of a regal father-figure is upstaged and undercut by a powerful female threnos.12 Eurydice's final cry of lamentation for her son (KcoK-uoaoa, 1302; o^-ukcoicutov, 1316), echoing Antigone's lament over her brother early in the play (cf. 423-25) and followed by her bloody death, of course, is only reported, not acted out on the stage; Euripides' scene, even if only minimally acted out, is horribly shocking and virtually unique in the extant tragic corpus. Nevertheless, there are approximations, and the late Euripides is here developing and exploiting a strain of violence and pathos in Greek drama from Aeschylus on. An audience that could watch the self-blinded Oedipus emerge from the palace in the Oedipus Tyrannus, or listen to the offstage cries of Medea's terrified children in Medea, or attend to Orestes' and Electra's detailed descriptions of the matricide that they have just committed in the Euripidean Electra, or hear the screams of Sophocles' Philoctetes, had the kind of theatrical preparation they needed for the compositio membrorum of the Bacchae. Ill As a lament of an aged grandfather over a dead grandson, Cadmus' speech has close parallels with that of Peleus over the body of Neoptolemus at the end of Andromache. By comparison to what we believe was Agave's intensely emotional and physical lamentation, Cadmus is relatively calm. Peleus, on the other hand, engages in a strophic lyrical exchange with the chorus of local women, which of course, requires a more emotional tone.13 He has, in fact, the direct involvement with the body that was probably prominent in Agave's lament. He addresses the "dear mouth, cheek, and hands" of the deceased (Andr. 1181), joins with the chorus in the ritual cry 12 On the disruptive emotional violence of female lament in tragedy, see Loraux 1998: 49 65 and 1999: 37-44, 53-61, 87-91. Contrast the end of OC, where the solidarity of the Athenian polis embodied in Theseus blocks the potentially disruptive violence of female lament. Compare also Ajax, which excludes female lament entirely, so that the closing funeral focuses on the hero's masculine identity: his armor, his martial exploits, his fellow-warriors, and the bond between father and son. A little closer to the Sophoclean pattern is the end of Hipp., where the royal father's lament leads into the public "grief of all the citizens"; but even this is undercut by the irony of Hippolytus' heroization in the marriage ritual which he rejected ' (1423-30); see C. P. Segal 1993: 24-25, 120-29, with the further references there cited. 13 The Bacchae also has a kommos between a lamenting protagonist and the chorus, but this occurred some two hundred lines earlier, where in fact a wild exultation displaced the lament in both form and function; see C. P. Segal 1994 and 1997b: 78-82.</page><page sequence="9">Charles Segal 281 of sorrow indicated in the text as ottotototoi (1198-1200), and surrenders to the physical expressions of mourning, tearing his hair and striking his head (1209-11). In the Bacchae, as we have noted, the somatic expression of the deepest grief is reserved for Agave. Cadmus speaks in trimeters, not lyric meters; and his sorrow, though bitter, begins to assume a more resigned tone. It falls to him to express the more reflective view of the situation. He closes his speech with a gnomic statement about the cost of scorning the gods (1325—26); and in his protest to Dionysus a little later he generalizes about the inappropriateness of divine wrath (1348). Both Peleus and Cadmus speak of going to Hades. Peleus, in his kommos, laments to the chorus (Andr. 1216-17): axeicvoq epiuio£, oijk excov 7cepa&lt;; SiavuXriaco novou^ eq "Ai8av. Childless, bereft, having no limit of woes, I shall complete my sufferings in Hades. Cadmus' remark, though bleak, comes after he has been promised translation to the Land of the Blest (1338-39)—a promise that he significantly ignores.14 Nevertheless, his complaint is in trimeters and so pitched at a somewhat lower emotional level (Bacch. 1360-62): oiiõe jtav&gt;oo|xai kökcõv 6 tXt||1(ov, oi&gt;8e xõv Kaxaipdtr|v 'Axepovta nXtvaaq nauxcx; yevriaoixai. Neither shall I cease from woes, miserable that I am, nor when I sail down the steep-flowing Acheron shall I be at rest. Despite these basic differences in form and tone, the two laments have significant thematic resemblances. Both old men bewail the destruction of their oikos and their childless state (Bacch. 1303-05, Andr. 1177-78): xovyap awrjye icavxai; eq piav |3A.d(3r|v, i)pä&lt;; xe xövSe 0', räoxe SioXeaai öõpovx; Kocp.', oaziq axeKvoq äpaevcov jtcuScov yeycoc,. ..

We are gone; my family is no longer; nor are children left to the house. Cadmus, however, is here accusing Dionysus' destructive vengeance, whereas Peleus dwells repeatedly on his childlessness as the defining term 14 The fact that Cadmus finds no solace in the promise of his future in the Land of the Blest adds to the dark tone here. See Dunn 1996: 75; Segal and Gibbons 2000: on lines 1360-63.</page><page sequence="10">282 Illinois Classical Studies 24-25 (1999-2000) of his utter misery, emphasizing the fact that with this death in the royal family the city too is destroyed (Andr. 1186-87, 1205-07, 1216-17). He ends, accordingly, with a hyperbolic statement of the loss of city and scepter that leaves him "fallen as one totally destroyed" {Andr. 1222-25): ouket' ecttv pot 7coXi&lt;;, / OKTiTiTpd t' EppEtco tcxSe- /. . . 7iava&gt;X.e0pov p' oyeav 7UIVOVTCX. Cadmus, on the other hand, focuses on Pentheus' achievements while he was alive and laments the specific, practical loss of his protection. In so doing, he offers a eulogy of Pentheus that (as we have noted) ironically underscores the latter's failure as the kind of warrior-king who should receive such praise. These ironies emerge from another parallel with the situation of Peleus, this time from Achilles' request for information about his son, Neoptolemus, when he meets Odysseus in Hades (Od. 11. 494-503): Tell me if you have any news of blameless Peleus, whether he still has honor (xijj.fi) among the Myrmidons, or whether they dishonor him (axind^ouai) in Hellas and Phthia, because old age holds his hands and feet. If I should come there to my father's house as his helper up into the rays of the sun, even for a little while, such as I was once in broad Troy when I slew the best of the host, truly would I make hateful to them my strength and my invincible hands, to them who do him violence (Piocovtai) and deprive him of honor (tiht|). We may compare these portions of Cadmus' speech over Pentheus (1310— 13, 1318-22): But no one wished to insult (uPpi^eiv) the old man when he looked upon your presence; for you exacted the fitting punishment. But now I shall be driven out of the house without honor (omno&lt;;). .. No longer will you touch this beard of mine with your hand . . . saying, "Who is doing you injustice (dSiKei), who deprives you of honor (dxi|xd^ei), aged man? Who gives you pain and disturbs your heart? Tell me so that I may punish the one who does you injustice (dSiKouvxa), my father." Although Cadmus' situation here is that of Achilles' father, Peleus, rather than of the Achilles who speaks these lines in the Odyssey, the father-son relation is still analogous.15 Both Cadmus and Achilles are concerned with the loss of a son (or grandson) who could defend an aged father-figure. Cadmus praises Pentheus in the terms that evoke the noblest exemplar of the traditional heroic code, the mighty son who is defending an old, impotent father against enemies who surround him and would "do him violence and deprive him of honor." 15 The connection with the young hero of epic is perhaps also suggested in 1306, where Cadmus describes Pentheus as a "shoot" (ernos) of Agave, a common metaphor in epic and epinician poetry and in the Iliad often used of young warriors killed in battle; see also Seaford 1996a: on line 1306.</page><page sequence="11">Charles Segal 283 The Homeric echoes help create further sympathy for Cadmus as a Peleus-like figure who has now suffered the loss of his last male heir. The play has already laid the foundation for that sympathy in his meeting with Pentheus in their first scene together in the play. Whereas Teiresias launches a full-scale tirade with accusations of sickness and "most grievous madness" (326), Cadmus addresses Pentheus as "my child" (cb rcoa, 330), offers only mild and grandfatherly admonitions about his excited state and "lack of sense" (vw yap hetti te kou &lt;ppova&gt;v oii8ev 9pov£u;, 332), and gives a warning about the example of Actaeon. Cadmus here evinces the bond with his grandson that Teiresias clearly does not have.16 But the more immediate effect of the Homeric echo is to remind us of the enormous gap between the arete of an Achilles who died in the greatest of heroic battles and a voyeuristic young king who died odoxicrta Kai miacrra, as Cadmus says ("most disgracefully and basely," 1307), that is, in a way that totally negates the noble death of the ideal warrior. It is his mother, raging in her maenadic madness, who won the aristeia and the title of aristos (1234, 1239). In his eulogy for Pentheus, Cadmus has the role of an authoritative magistrate or ruler, but he is in fact an aged, crushed ex-king condemned to exile from his city. The youth whom he would praise did not fall in honorable battle at the hands of fellow-warriors but dressed as a woman and at the hands of women, among them his own mother. Although his expedition began as a military mission (780-85), its martial character becomes increasingly ambiguous, even when Pentheus still has some measure of control over his mind (845). And of course he ends up not only as a pseudo-maenad and a sacrificial victim (934, 961-63) but as a failed pseudo-ephebe, spying in the mountains rather than fighting as a hoplite in full armor in the plain (see 956).17 Cadmus can list among his praiseworthy exploits little more than the hopes that the house had in him (1308) and his zeal to protect his grandfather (1310).18 In proudly recalling how his grandson defended him from insults, moreover, Cadmus conveniently forgets the insults that Pentheus himself heaped on his head when he first found him in Bacchic dress (250-52, 344-45). Although Cadmus mentions qualities that belong to the arete of the warrior-king, such as "honor" and "justice," his praise focuses primarily on the private realm, that is, on Pentheus' benefits to the house and on his personal tie to himself whom he protected as elder member of the family. It 16 For Winnington-Ingram 1948: 143, Cadmus' speech reveals a "genuine affection" between grandfather and grandson. In the dynamics of the Greek family, the maternal grandfather, like the maternal uncle, might well have a special role in his grandson's life, given the fact that the young child is almost exclusively in his mother's care for the early years and so might become more involved with her close relatives. 17 For these inversions and ironies, see C. P. Segal 1997a: Ch. 6, esp. 164-68, 196-204. 18 As part of this cancellation of heroic warrior status Dionysus preempts the epic motif of the "glory that reaches to the heavens" (kXeoi; oupavfi axripi^ov, 972) in the ironies of Pentheus' unheroic death; see C. P. Segal 1997a: 203.</page><page sequence="12">284 Illinois Classical Studies 24-25 (1999-2000) is in Pentheus, he says, that "the house recovered its light of life," and it is Pentheus "who sustained my palace" (1308-09). Though he refers to the founding of the whole "Theban race" and so to the origins of Thebes as a city (1314-15), he has little to say about this king's value to the city as a whole. This omission is not due to a contrast between the city as a whole and the royal house (for which there is little evidence in the play),19 but rather to the failure of Pentheus to achieve the adult status of the true king and warrior. The ironies that attend these failures of Pentheus appear in Cadmus' controversial phrase in 1310, TtoXei xe xappoq rjaGa, literally, "you were a terror to the city."20 In its context in Cadmus' speech, the phrase seems to refer to Pentheus' determined protection of his elderly grandfather by inspiring "terror" in anyone who would insult him. But the play has amply shown the negative side of this capacity to inspire "terror" in the Messenger's allusion to his irascibility (670-71), in which he closely resembles the "stage tyrant," like Creon in the Antigone. As the Messenger concludes some hundred lines later, the chorus confirms this trait, feeling "terror" at speaking freely (775-77): xaoBo) jxsv eiTtetv tow; Xoyovc, eXeuGepoix; Ttpo? tov Tupavvov, 6.XX' ö|ico(; eipriaexai Aiovuaoq Tiaarnv oüSevot; Getõv £9-0. I feel terror at speaking words in freedom to the ruler, but even so it shall shall be spoken: Dionysus is inferior to none of the gods. There is another irony here, for, "terror" or not, the Lydian Bacchants are in open defiance of the king's authority as they proclaim the greatness of their god. Just this defiance, in fact, is the last straw for Pentheus, who at once explodes with indignation at this "insult from the Bacchants" and calls for all-out mobilization of his armed forces (778-86)—virtually his last expression of regal power before he falls under the spell of Dionysus (810 46). As commentators suggest, Pentheus' "terror for the city" in 1310 carries another level of meaning: It alludes to the good fear that is necessary for civic order, such as that praised by the Erinyes in the trial at the end of Aeschylus' Eumenides (517-30) and then endorsed by Athena herself in the reconciliation that gives the dread goddesses a firm place in her city (Eum. 690-702): 19 In contrast to Seaford 1996a: 47-50, and also on lines 1248-49,1310, 1329-30 (p. 253), I see nothing in this ending that contrasts the survival of Thebes as a whole with the destruction of its royal family; in fact, Cadmus' final words rather suggest the continuing identification of the sufferings of the royal family with those of Thebes in general (1377-78). On the implicit responsibility of "the whole city of Thebes" for the destructive vengeance of Dionysus, see also 39-40, 50-52, 195-96, 1036, 1295. For further discussion, see C. P.

In both cases the polis faces an awesome and potentially dangerous divine force that demands its appropriate form of recognition. But Athens, characteristically, is able to find a place for this divine power and recognizes its unique contribution to the city (in this case, the rightful "fear" and reverence), whereas Pentheus' Thebes vehemently rejects this divine power and so experiences only a negative and destructive form of its gifts.22 The "fear" that Pentheus inspires in the city only reflects ironically on his failures as a king. Far from solidifying and stabilizing the civic order, it operates only within the narrow limits of his own household, alienates the citizens, and works against the harmonious relation of divine and human realms in which the healthy polis flourishes. The sympathy that Cadmus' little speech arouses is cued to the audience by the chorus' brief statement of compassion, to nev oov aXyco, Ka5|ie ("I feel pain for your lot, Cadmus," 1327), one of the rare such statements of pity from these barbarian women so fanatically devoted to their god.23 Even here they immediately qualify that compassion. Pentheus, they say, got his just deserts, even if it was "painful" for Cadmus (dXyeivriv in 1328 echoing aA-yco in the previous line). Having so powerfully portrayed Agave's suffering in the compositio membrorum just preceding, Euripides continues to exploit its emotional power, but now in relation to Dionysus rather than Cadmus. Her response to Cadmus' speech in 1329, "O father, you see how much my (fortunes) have turned about," refocuses our attention on her and, I suggest, is a prelude to her accusations of the god in the second lacuna. In his reply to 21 Translation from Lloyd-Jones 1970a: 54-55. On the end of Bacch. and Eum., see C. P. Segal 1997b: 67-68.

That Dionysus directly addressed Agave is also supported by the First Hypothesis, which states: "Dionysus, when he appeared, announced some things to all, and then made clear to each [of the protagonists] what will happen." The tone of the god's prophecy to Agave may perhaps be gauged from CP 1756, which probably comes from Dionysus' address to Agave: "You who are so murderous must leave the city" (8el yap ae rnv (povcoaav eK^melv 7ioA.iv).24 Oovcooav here, "eager for murder," "thirsting for slaughter," is a strong word. Sophocles uses it in the Antigone (117) of the spears of the attackers thirsting for the blood of the citizens. If this verse of the CP does indeed come from the Bacchae, the participle (povcoaav, instead of one of tragedy's more common words for "polluted," is striking and may suggest deliberate harshness on Dionysus' part in announcing his sentence of exile. Dionysus not only evokes the pollution that necessitates Agave's exile from Thebes—a pollution that he caused—but also cruelly reminds her, in her present sorrow, of the horror of her past madness. For such Olympian distance and indifference to human suffering we may compare Artemis' punitive speech to Theseus at the end of the Hippolytus (1283-1324). IV The play ends with women, female experience, and the "Bacchae" of the title. Agave's last request is to go "where no memorial of the thyrsus is dedicated; let these be a concern to other Bacchae" (1386 f.). If we press the meaning of her penultimate line (nr|9' o9i Gtipaou p.vf|n' avaicelrai, 1386), an even deeper irony emerges that also reflects back on Cadmus' eulogy of Pentheus. As Christine Kalke points out, (xvrina in Euripides always refers to a "memorial" for the dead, and specifically a tomb.25 Furthermore, a "memorial of the thyrsus" is also a memorial of Pentheus, who died in a phantasmagoric transmogrification into a thyrsus, first placed by the god on the top of a tall pine tree that is shaken by ecstatic maenads in the mountain, and then when his head replaces the bunch of ivy that Agave puts at the end of her narthex, the fennel-rod that forms the shaft of her 24 It is also possible to translate CP 1756 as, "You must leave the city that is so murderous," taking ipovSaav with itoXiv rather than with oe; and in favor of this translation is the fact that 716X15 'he Bacchae elsewhere has an article or modifier. The interpretation given in the text, however, is attractive because it obviously intensifies the focus on Agave. In either case, the force of Dionysus' &lt;poviiaav would be felt. 25 See Kalke 1985, esp. 420-21.</page><page sequence="15">Charles Segal 287 thyrsus (1141—44).26 The chorus describes Pentheus as having received the "well-thyrsused fennel-stalk" as the special token that admits him to Hades (v(xp0T)K(x t£ Ttiotov "AiScx / eXapev euS-upoov, 1157-58).27 When Agave then enters carrying Pentheus' head (now in her arms and no longer on her thyrsus), she describes it as a "newly cut tendril" (e^iKa veoxo)iov, 1170), that is, as the fresh ivy that might form the tip of a thyrsus.28 If 1386 is understood in this way, not only is Pentheus a failure as a warrior, but his "tomb" is not the proper king's or warrior's "memorial" but rather the thyrsus of maenads, the thyrsus that he had fantastically become when he was torn apart by women as a wild, hunted beast on the mountains. Far from being a civic monument to his kleos, therefore, this memorial stands under the sign of his antagonist, Dionysus. Like every other part of Pentheus' would-be martial identity, it is totally absorbed into the Dionysiac world that he resisted. This mnema at the end of the play, then, undergoes exactly the same Dionysiac transformation as the mnema of the god's other mortal relative at the beginning, for Semele's tomb also becomes a sign of Dionysus' divinity, smoking with the thunder and lightning of his celestial origin and covered with the burgeoning clusters of the grape (6-12).29 In this light too we can understand Dionysus' much-discussed allusion to a hoplite battle in which he will lead the maenads against the whole of "the city of the Thebans" (51-53).30 In such a battle, Pentheus might indeed have met a warrior's death and so earned a warrior's eulogy. But no such battle occurs, precisely because Pentheus is never able to emerge as a military leader. Despite his call to his armed forces (780-86), no troops ever materialize; and Pentheus leaves the stage under the god's power, thinking about putting on his armor (845-46; cf. 809), only to return in maenad, not warrior, dress (915-17).31 When a battle of sorts does take place, it is the maenads who have the ordered ranks of hoplites (693, 733; cf. 723-24) and render completely ineffectual the metal weapons of the country folk whom they immediately put to flight (759-64; cf. 798-99). 26 Kalke 1985 passim. For another view of this scene as reflecting Dionysiac phallic imagery and the Dionysiac pompe, see Csapo 1997: 282-87. The two interpretations are not mutually exclusive. For other aspects of the "memorial" at the end, see C. P. Segal 1997a: 318-22. 27 This is a controversial passage, much emended and still obelized by Diggle 1994a, despite papyrus support for the text given here. The phrase Jtvaxov "Ai5a gives excellent sense: riiatov is to be understood as a neuter accusative substantive, in apposition with "narthex," governing the genitive "Ai8a in the sense of "pledge of/for Hades," or else as an adjective modifying "narthex" with the meaning "giving assurance of Hades"; see Seaford 1996a: ad loc. The language is bold, but not out of keeping with the situation. Segal and Gibbons 2000: ad loc. translate, "He carried the fennel-rod of Hades, / the thyrsos that is the warrant of his death." 28 On the multiple references of this phrase, see Winnington-Ingram 1948: 135 n. 1. 29 For some interesting suggestions about the importance of Semele's tomb in the play's spatial dynamics (inner and outer, communal and private, royal power and divine power), see Wiles 1997: 172-74. 30 See Hamilton 1974. 31 On these reversals, see C.

V Throw off your chains and be free, Dionysus tells his worshippers; but the play then dramatizes the process of awakening to recognize the horrors that this freedom has perpetrated. Each of the three main protagonists falls under the spell of joyful Dionysiac ecstasy and then awakens from it to a painful reality: Pentheus for the few moments that precede his agonizing death; Agave with the horrifying physical remains of her actions, the head and the bloody hands; and Cadmus in a mood of deep sadness. Cadmus alone of the three mortal protagonists reflects on the meaning of the events and raises the issue of divine justice. It is appropriate, therefore, for his lament to form the mood of understanding, resignation, questioning, and sorrow that moves the play toward closure. The joyful liberation from old age that enlivens Cadmus and Teiresias in their rejuvenation as eager celebrants of Dionysus in the first stage action in the play changes back to the sad wisdom of old age at the end.33 Cadmus once more feels the full weight of his years and acknowledges his impotence as an "old man" (1320, 1355). Still under the god's spell, Agave reproaches her father for the "ill-tempered" mood and "scowling-eyed" expression of old men (1251 f.). But old Cadmus' embittered mood is justified by his clear view of the "unhappy truth" that he apostrophizes soon after (1287). In his final farewell to Agave, feeling himself totally helpless before the catastrophe that ruins his house, he describes himself as an enfeebled hoary-headed swan, rcoXioxpcov (1365); and we may contrast Pentheus' threat early in the play that he would have imprisoned Teiresias along with the maenads "if his white-haired old age didn't save him" (yfjpac; tioAaov, 258).34 Dionysus "does not distinguish between young and old," Teiresias says, when it comes to honoring him in the dance (206-07). Yet the mortal condition does make such distinctions; and, as the god's ecstasy 32 Kalke 1985: 421-22; Dodds 1960: xxxiii-xxxvi; also Carpenter 1997: 116-18; March 1989, esp. 39 ff., 50 ff.

Euripides' recasting of Dionysiac myth and ritual into the literary form of tragedy gives us not the ritual itself but a reflection on the ritual. This transformation has several important consequences, of which four stand out. (1) The epiphany that is central to the Dionysiac religious experience appears at the end only in its dark face, as tragic anagnorisis,35 The display of the god's power in epiphanic revelation marks the major stages of the dramatic action, but at the end it coincides with a tragic "knowing" or "understanding" of extreme suffering. This transformation of epiphany into anagnorisis is marked by the often-noted accumulation of words for sight and vision at the end.36 The vision of "blessedness" or "happiness" vouchsafed to the initiate (paicdpioq, 1242-43) is for Agave a sudden vision and recognition of ruin. Whereas the chorus of Dionysus' Lydian worshippers joyfully experience the vision of the "greatest light" of comfort from the god in the Palace Miracle (fi&gt; (paoq peyicjTov fi(xiv exnou PaKxet&gt;n.crto&lt;;, / ax; eaeiSov aapevri ae, "O greatest light for us of the Bacchic revelry that cries euhoi, how joyfully I looked upon you," 608-09), Agave experiences a vision of the "greatest grief' of her new sorrow (opto peyicrcov aXyoq ri xaXaiv' eyco, 1282). The hallmark of tragic anagnorisis, Agave's "now I understand" (1296), is simultaneously a kind of reverse epiphany, as she awakens from the illusion (and delusion) of the initiate's "blessedness" (1242-43) to the acknowledgment of the god as the "destroyer" of her life (1296): Aiovuaoq fipaq wXeo', apxi pavSavco. In like manner, Dionysus' epiphany takes place in theatrical as well as religious terms, when he enters at the end no longer disguised as the Lydian Stranger but as the deus ex machina. His appearance is heralded by another statement of vision, but a vision of a characteristically theatrical nature, involving tragic reversal or peripeteia (1329): co jtaiep, opaq yap tap' oacp (xexeaxpatpri ("O father, you see by how much my fortunes have turned about"). This overlapping of recognition, reversal, and epiphanic deus ex machina would doubtless be even more powerful if we had the actual entrance of Dionysus that occurred in the lacuna after this verse. For Cadmus too the god's revelation of his true power and legitimacy in Thebes comes not as religious experience but as a reflection on the destructive vengeance of the god and as a protest, futile though it is, against his excessive cruelty and injustice:37 35 For other aspects of anagnorisis in the play, see C. P. Segal 1997a: 277-78, 259-62, 314-18. 36 See Winriington-Ingram 1948: 139-40, 164-65; C. P. Segal 1997a: 229-32,236. 37 Even Seaford, for whom Dionysus' revenge is a just and necessary step on Thebes' progress to becoming a democratic polis (1996a: 50 f.), has to acknowledge a problem with the god's cruelty at the end (1996a: on lines 1348-49): "In response to what may seem a reasonable point (cf. 1249, and the pathos of Hipp. 120, HF 1345-46) D's [ = Dionysus']</page><page sequence="18">290 Illinois Classical Studies 24-25 (1999-2000) oi'ixoi KaKtDv hev 7cp5&gt;xa acov, eneix' E(i&amp;)v ■ wq o 0eo&lt;; fniat; evSiKcot; (iev 6.XX' ayav Bp6(iio&lt;; avai; anaXea' oiiceloi; yeymq.

(2) The ending completes the pattern of initiatory ritual in the play that is evident particularly in the bright light of salvation that the maenads see in the Palace Miracle and in the Stranger's dressing Pentheus as a maenad.38 But both Agave's and Pentheus' initiations are bitterly ironic.39 All the hopes for the rebirth and renewal that initiation brings are dashed to the ground, not only in Pentheus' horrible death as a pseudo-maenad but also in the mood of dispersion and despair in the closing scene. The suffering visited on the survivors here depicts a divinity who seems very far from being a savior-god. (3) The fate of the Theban royal house reenacts the typical pattern of Dionysiac resistance myths, like those of Lycurgus, the Minyades, and the Proetides. Thebes' future joy in its native-born god, celebrated in Pindar and tragedy, is, of course, in the background; but in the play's tragic version of the Dionysiac resistance-myth the emphasis is on the suffering of the mortals rather than the triumph of the god. Cadmus' attempt to account for Dionysus' vengeance, namely his wrath because he "had a name without reference to Zeus has a note of irrational finality." Burnett 1998, who seeks to rehabilitate the value of vengeance in Greek tragedy ("among the early Greeks vengeance was not a problem but a solution," xvi), pays relatively little attention to divine vengeance and virtually no attention to the Bacchae. 38 On Dionysiac initiation and Mysteries, see especially Seaford 1981 passim, 1994: 280 301, 1996a: 39-44. 39 For the ironic inversions of initiatory patterns, see C.

The god's prophecy of the future contrasts with the mortal characters' recognition of their shattered past, now made concrete in the enforced discontinuity of exile. (4) The joyful, exuberant side of Dionysiac worship described in the odes of the first half of the play—the participation in the vital energies of nature and the mood of liberation and ecstasy in the thrilling rhythms of Dionysiac song and dance—keeps retreating further into the background as the play goes on. The finale leaves us with the shocked and reduced victims cowering before a punitive and vengeful god. This ending, while it magnifies Dionysus' power, also raises the underlying questions about his nature implicit in these resistance myths, of which the Bacchae is our most powerful extant example. Euripides' plays generally leave us with more questions than answers about the gods, and the Bacchae is no exception.41 Harvard University 40 With the majority of recent editors, I believe that Cadmus, and not Dionysus, spoke 1377— 78 (reading emaxev for P's eitaoxov in 1377). Line 1351 looks like Dionysus' exit line, and his exit here would make the exodus similar to that of the Hippolytus, where Artemis' departure at 1439 leaves the stage free for an emotional closing scene between the two mortal victims. In addition, 1377-78, if spoken by Cadmus, would be in accordance with his attempt to explain the severity of the god's vengeance at 1302-05.
