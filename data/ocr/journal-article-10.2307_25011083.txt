<plain_text><page sequence="1">R. DREW GRIFFITH The Origin of Memnon Ammenemes III of Egypt (reigned 1842-1797) built his mortuary temple, Herodotus' labyrinth (2.148; Armayor 1985), at Hawaret el-Makta'in the Fayoum, southwest of Memphis. In describing it, Strabo gives Ammenemes' name, 3Imn m-ht CAVtLeve,'j?, Manetho 609 F 2 [p. 32] FGrHist), as'IaVt&amp;v8rq (17.1.37) if he really means him, for even Manetho could not sort out all the kings of that name-and says that IJavarM ; built the structure at Abydos called the "Memnonion" (17.1.42). In Black Athena, M. Bernal, advancing the idea of Egyptian-Greek contact at an early period, argues from these data that "the most plausible candidate for the Memnon of Greek tradition is Ses6stris' son, successor, co-regent and fellow campaigner, 'Imn m ht/Amenemhe II" (reigned 1929-1895).' This paper weighs Bernal's idea, asking if Memnon could have had an Egyptian model, if he could have been Ammenemes II, and if Amenhotep III is a rival candidate.

In this task we will meet three related processes: syncretism, whereby preexisting figures are conflated; derivation, whereby new figures are modelled on an original as doublets of each other; and confusion, whereby figures share names or common attributes. Derivation is the opposite of syncretism; confusion a partial form of it. A. AN EGYPTIAN MODEL FOR MEMNON? Memnon is the main character of Arctinus' Aethiopis, a dithyramb of Si monides (539 PMG) and an Aeschylean trilogy (fr. 127-30, 279-80 TrGF).2 From Proclus' summary of the Aethiopis (T 3 Davies = Argumentum pp. 67-69 Bernabe) and elsewhere in archaic art and verse we can compile a brief biography.3 Son of the dawn-goddess Eos and the mortal Tithonus (Hes. Theog. 985, cf. Od. 5.1, Hymn. Hom. Ven. 21 8-38)4 and king of the Ethiopians, Memnon helped Troy after the death of the pro-Trojan Amazon Penthesileia, summoned, in one version, by Teutamus of Assyria (Ctesias5 apud Diod. Sic. 2.22.1, cf. P1. Leg. 685c). Very handsome (Od. 11.522) like his father (Hymn. Hom. Ven. 225, Tyrtaeus fr. 12.5 IEG), he wore bronze armor made by Hephaestus (Hes. loc. cit., Pind. Isth. 5.41). He killed Antilochus as the latter defended his own father, Nestor, whose chariot had been disabled by Paris' arrows (Od. 4.187-88, Pind. Pyth. 6.28-45), and was in turn killed by Achilles (Pind. 01. 2.83). Eos begged Zeus to spare him (ARV2 496.5), but a weighing of fates (QuXoatocLot) during which the matres dolorosae Eos and Thetis flanked the scales, each pleading her son's case, de termined that he must die (ABL 227.28).6 With Zeus' blessing, Eos made him immortal (Procl. loc. cit.). The Ethiopians, whom Memnon rules, live and often entertain gods (II. 1.423 24, 23.205-207; Lesky 1959 = 1966: 410-21) by the river Ocean on the eastern edge of earth (Mimnermus fr. 12.9 IEG)-Memnon is, after all, son of the Dawn. lonians may have invented for symmetry the Odyssey's western branch of the tribe (1.22-24);7 traditions in languages of the hamito-semitic family also record two lands of Cush (Egyptian K;s, Akkadian Kasi), one south of Egypt (EA 49.20, Isaiah 11.11, etc.), one by the Mesopotamian river of paradise, Gihon (EA 76.15, Genesis 2.13). Hecataeus first clearly put the Ethiopians south of Egypt (1 F 326-27 FGrHist), though already Hesiod links them to the Libyans (fr. 150.17-19 Merkelbach-West) and the Odyssey includes them in Menelaus' 2. I believe that the Psychostasia was based on the Aethiopis and not on the Iliad and that it appeared on the same bill with, but was not identical to, the Memnon. Neither point is certain; see Mette 1963: 108-12, and Taplin 1977: 422-23 and 431-33. 3. Kossatz-Deissmann 1992. Most important of earlier discussions is Lung 1912. 4.

The rival tradition placing them in Susa (Hdt. 5.54.2, 7.151) is post-Homeric.8 Also first attested after Homer is their hundred and twenty-year life expectancy (they are iCXp63OPOl, Hdt. 3.23.1, 114).9 The epistyle block from a temple of Athena found by Schliemann in the Troad proves that Alexander the Great thought Hisarllk the Troy of legend. Signs of frequent destruction there, including that of Troy VIJa around 1250 (Hiller 1991), suggest that poets based the legend on an actual conflict and its combatants on real people. 10 So an Egyptian pharaoh could have been Memnon's model. The name Ammenemes, or even 'IaV0Cv8r)v, is hardly like Memnon, but this may not matter. An Egyptian loan-word in Greek must have been transformed twice, first in Akkadian, the koine of the period," and second in Greek itself. The result in this case was a good warrior's name: M?ivwv, "The Steadfast or Resolute" (LSJ s.v.). Aiding these processes could have been that tI'vW, poetically reduplicated as ,i,Lv, resembles by chance Egyptian mn (cf. Coptic tioyNi, ntum), "to be firm, remain, be established." That said, three things actively point to an Egyptian model. First is the 4uxocatcaLa. Since Zeus weighs Hector's and Achilles' fates to decide which one must die in the Iliad (22.209-14), one might think that he did so often, with Memnon among others. Not so. The Iliadic saga was not the original subject of Mycenaean bards, who would hardly have told their king a tale in which he is abused by a lesser provincial, must apologize to him, and is less brave than many of his underlings (Page 1966: 254).12 Moreover, the deaths of Patroclus, Hector and Achilles in the Iliad mirror those of Antilochus, Memnon and Achilles, who die in this order in the Aethiopis; and Nestor is protected in both, by Diomedes in one (II. 8.90-117), by Antilochus in the other (cf. Pind. Pyth. 6.28-45, cf. Schol. 28a [2.197 Drachmann]). The question of priority imposes itself. 0. Gruppe (1906: vol. 1.679-83) showed that, though the Aethiopis received its monumental form at Arctinus' hands, its story was already known to those who sang the wanderings of Odysseus (e.g. Od. 11.467-70 = 24.15-18). H. Pestalozzi (1945) further argued that Patroclus and Hector are not original and were based on Antilochus and Memnon, an idea taken up with varying enthusiasm by the "neoanalysts" J. T. Kakridis, W. Schadewaldt, G. Schoeck and M. M. Willcock, the last of whom preferred to think of mutual contamination of two coexisting stories.'3 M. E. 8.

Coulson (1978) argued that Sarpedon, whose killing by Patroclus starts the Iliadic vendettas, was also based on Memnon, each with an aristeia, a parent who cannot save him, and a nonpartisan insistence on his death. By this logic, Zeus first weighed Memnon's fate, then Achilles' and others' (cf. II. 8.69 75, metaphorically 16.658, 19.223, Theog. 157, Aesch. Pers. 346); certainly, by weighing Hector's and Achilles' fates, he discovers nothing not already known, and the heroes' mothers make more natural advocates (cf. II. 1.493ff.) than the Olympians Athena and Apollo (22.186, 203). This, in turn, suggests Egypt as the source for Memnon, for, as Bernal notes, the weighing of two fates (xipe) recalls the weighing of the deceased's heart (lb = xip) against the feather of Truth in the Egyptian underworld, after s/he has pronounced the "Negative Confession," a list of forty-two sins that s/he denies having committed in life. A crucial spell in the Book of the Dead (125, cf. 30B) describes this "judgement of words" (wd' mdww), and depicts it in the accompanying vignette. Though the date in the reign of the sixth dynasty (ca. 2345-2181) Menkare that spell 30B claims for itself is suspect, it is old. A green siltstone heart-scarab belonging to a high official named Nebankh, who lived dunrng the thirteenth dynasty (ca. 1710), is inscribed with spell 30B. Tomb-robbers arrested in 1125 admitted stealing the jewelry from the neck of the mummy of the seventeenth dynasty (ca. 1650-1567) Sobkemsaf II; the only object that would have been around his neck is a green jasper heart-scarab now in the British Museum (EA 7876), which is also inscribed with spell 30B.14 R. B. Onians argued that the Egyptian motif differs from its agonistic Greek counterpart, but E. Wuist, B. C. Dietrich and E. Vermeule have stressed the similarities:'5 Osiris, judge and saviour of the dead'6 presides over one weighing, Zeus E&amp;rT)p (Pind. 01. 5.17 etc.), the father of Dike (Hes. Theog. 902), conducts the other; one sends people to the second death, o O&amp;vtoalo o U,-repoc, in the maw of the Eater of the Dead,'7 the other to a literal death. The objects weighed are homonymous (cf. Quint. Smyrn. 11.105-106, who assimilates xip to x p), and x&gt;'p can perhaps mean not "fate" but "spirit of the dead" (cf. the cry that ends the Anthesteria, "Get out, Keres, the Anthesteria is over!" [0CpoCE, KipEq, oux ET' AvO6arspxoc] Zenobius 4.33 mss. B and V).'8 Moreover, Aristophanes parodies Aeschylus with a judgement not of fates, but of words (Ran. 1367).

That the original meaning of x'p was "fate" is argued by Lee 1961.</page><page sequence="5">216 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 17/No. 2/October 1998 Second is that Memnon was an ally of Penthesileia, for Egyptians portrayed the god of the yearly Nile-innundation, .H'py, as a one-breasted male clad in a loincloth."9 He recalls the Amazons, Egyptizing in their reversal of sex-roles (Hdt. 2.35, Soph. OC 337-40) and love of the bow, if they cut off their right breasts to facilitate archery and so were calledA,u&amp;Coveq, "breastless" (e.g. Diod. Sic. 2.45.3), though the iconographic tradition shows them now mutilated (e.g. ABV 401.2), now not.20 The Amazons wore Catcspeq (loincloths?), the object of Heracles' ninth labour (Epicharmus fr. 82 Austin, Pind. fr. 172.5 Maehler, Eur. Her. 408-18; Schauenburg 1960). Amazons are a cavalry (Eur. Her. 408): Hippolyte was an Amazon (Stesichorus 193.25-26 PMG = PMGF, with Lobel's conjecture), and Hippolytus son of an Amazon (Eur. Hipp. 10), perhaps Theseus' wife, Hippe (Hes. fr. 147 Merkelbach-West). In sound, these names recall JJ'py or some variant, such as JH'py t-mhw, "inundation of the land of papyrus" (i.e., the delta). Their sense indirectly recalls him, too, for Greece is not watered by flood as is Egypt, but by springs, created either like Lema (Apollod. Bibl. 2.1.4, cf. Aesch. fr. 13-15 TrGF) by Poseidon, the horse-god (Bacchyl. 16.99, Ar. Nub. 83, Eq. 551), or like Hippocrene by Pegasus, a horse (Hes. Theog. 6). Third is Memnon's surprising apotheosis.2' This suggests an Egyptian prove nance, since all dead pharaohs became immortal, for in Egyptian soteriology everyone was equated in death with the god Osiris to the extent that "Osiris x" means "the late x" (PT ? 12, etc.; Griffiths 1970: 35-36). The dead king's soul does not join Osiris in the underworld as mere mortals' souls do, but as cends the "two skies" (PT ? 541; Davis 1985) to join him forever in his ce lestial abode, the constellation S?h.22 As proof, the Great Pyramid that Khufu (- Cheops) built at Giza contains two shafts rising from the "King's Chamber" to the pyramid's north and south faces (Edwards 1961: 126). Not for ventila tion, as scholars once thought, these were to guide his soul by the north star23 19. Griffiths 1966. A bas-relief from the "Birth Room" of the Amun-temple at Luxor (ancient Thebes) shows SFpy in the company of the god Hk?w, the personification of magic, who is holding Amenhotep III and his k?. On Hk?w, see Te Velde 1969-1970. 20. Von Bothmer 1957, Tyrrell 1984, Blok 1995, and Dowden 1997. 21. Numerous stories, such as those of Asclepius and Hippolytus, Orpheus and Eurydice, and Sisyphus, stress that one cannot evade death. Heracles is unique in the status of hero-god brought about by his apotheosis (Pind. Nem. 3.22, Hdt. 2.44). The concept of immortality is murky, however: see Talbert 1975, Levy 1979, Anderson 1981, and Clay 1981-1982. 22. Faulkner 1966: 157-59. Southern and summer stars in pharaonic times, the precession of the equinoxes has since moved Sih north in the winter sky. 23. The North Star was Thuban (a Draconis; precession has caused Polaris [a Ursae Minoris] to replace Thuban as North Star in our day); it was, obviously, one of the circumpolar (or, as the Egyptians knew them, "imperishable" lhm-sk as contrasted with the merely "unwearying" lhmw-wrd) stars. For the Nile-dwelling Egyptians, the natural vehicle in which for the king to make his ascent to heaven to join the stars was a boat. The Pyramid Texts speak repeatedly of the celestial ferryman, .Hr.f-h.f, ancestor of the Greek Charon, who carries the deceased to his new home in his boat named "it flies, it alights" (pis 8,nIs, PT ? 494). The deceased often carried into the tomb scale-model boats to aid him on the journey; Tutcankhamtin, for example, had fourteen; see Reisner 1913: xxi ff.</page><page sequence="6">GRIFFITH: The Origin of Memnon 217 to Sxh.` Two things suggest that Mycenaeans had met the Osirian faith, which was centred at Busiris (BouatiPL &lt; p-wsir, Hdt. 2.61.1) in the delta twenty-five kilometres from Mendes, whose goat-cult was known to Greeks (Pind. fr. 201 Maehler, Hdt. 2.46, Plut. Mor. 989a). First, the tale that Demeter failed to burn off Demopho(o)n's mortality as she wandered in search of Persephone (Hymn. Hom. Cer. 231-55) recalls Isis' failure to immortalize Malcander's son by fire during her quest for Osiris (Plut. Mor. 357B). A formula for warding off scorpion stings alluding to this was wide-spread in Egypt, which suggests that if the tales are related, the Egyptian inspired the Greek.25 Second, plebeians join Osiris, who judges their words as "Lord of Amenta." "Amenta" ('imntt), hellenized A,uv6ie by Plutarch (Mor. 362D), denotes the western-or sunset-bank of the Nile, traditional site of graveyards, and then realm of the dead, as Sophocles describes dying souls flying &amp;xT&amp;v np6S arnepou OeoU (OT 177). The judge in Hades, Rhadamanthys (II. 14.322 etc.), whose pre-Greek origin is shown by the -vO- phoneme, may come from Egypt with its animal-headed pantheon,26 for Sosicrates claims (461 F 3 FGrHist) that Rhadamanthys coined oaths sworn by geese, dogs and rams, rather than by anthropomorphic gods (e.g. Ar. Vesp. 83, Av. 521, PI. Ap. 22A1, Grg. 482B5, etc.), and Socrates swears "by Dog, the god of the Egyptians" (,ua tOv xCU'va Ov A' yu7Liv eo6v, Grg. ibid.)-Homer's "'owl-faced" (yXaux6nLs) Athena and "cow-faced" (PoCOMti) Hera may echo these gods.27 Phonologically, the distance from "Lord of A4i6v6r" to Rhadamanthys is slight. 28 The Greeks were perhaps even dimly aware of Osiris' stellar home. They called Sih 'Qp'Lv in epic (II. 18.486 = Od. 5.274 = Hes. Erga 615, etc.), and in lyric 'QotxpLv (Pind. Nem. 2.12, fr. 72 Maehler, Corinna 654 col. iii 38, 662.2 PMG, Callim. Hymn. 3.265, Catull. 66.94) or 'OcxpiLv (v.1. Pind. Nem. 2.12; vide Athen. 11.80 p. 490F codex E, Eustath. II. 932.42, Od. 1535.50 codex Cheops and his successor Chephren had five life-sized boats each, one of which was discovered disassembled but perfectly preserved south of Cheops' pyramid on 26 May 1954; see Cerny 1955, and Nour, Osman, Iskander and Moustafa 1960. The deceased pharaoh, like any ancient mariner, would take his bearings by the stars (cf. Od. 5.272-77); the northem shaft of the great pyramid provided a sort of astrolabe for Cheops for this purpose. 24. Badawy 1964, and Trimble 1964 = 1992: 3-8.

"Lord of Amenta" is nb 'Imntt (Book of the Dead 30B, etc.); Osiris also absorbs the person of the originally distinct Khentamenthes; I am unaware that Osiris is ever called * rwd 'Imntt "controller of Amenta," but this term would account for the exact form of Rhadamanthys.</page><page sequence="7">218 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 17/No. 2/October 1998 A; Scherer 1953: 188-89). None of these forms has a tempting Indoeuropean etymology, in contrast to Orion's neighbour, Sirius, home in Egyptian thought of Osiris' sister-wife, Isis, for EeLpLo has been related to the stem of acL-W, "to shake" (hence? "to twinkle") and the infix found in Avestan tist-ry-a, "star" (e.g. Avesta 8.6, 37).29 Greek abhors hiatus, as proved by the host of means it evolved to avoid it-aphaeresis, contraction, crasis and elision-and even QcxpLwv often undergoes synecphonesis (= synizesis),30 so the development is from the lyric to the epic form. The hiatus in the earlier form must mark a lost semivocalic glide (digamma, cf. d8ov &lt; *E`FL8ov) or voiceless sibilant (sigma, cf. ytVeVo &lt; *yevsvaoq, sXuou &lt; *EXUEao). One possibility entails the etymologically opaque *'OFapL')v, but the other points to *'06yop-iL)V. The reason is this. There is yet another form of the name: OUpLwv (Euphorio fr. 101 Powell, Aristomachus apud Hygin. de astr. 2.34, Ov. Fast. 5.535, Nonnus Dion. 13.99-101), accompanied by a tale that says that a certain Hyrieus from Thebes prayed that he might have a son. Zeus, Hermes and Poseidon visited him and told him to make a sacrifice that his son might be born. When he had skinned the sacrificial bull, the gods urinated (=? ejaculated) on the hide and, on Hermes' orders, Hyrieus buried it in the ground. From that place the promised boy was born, and they called him Orion (Hyriea quendam Thebis voto petisse, utfilium haberet. penes quem lovis et Mercurius et Neptunus in hospitio devenerunt imperaveruntque ei, hostiam deiceret utifilius nasceretur. cuius pelle bovis detracta dei in eam urinam fecere, iussuque Mercurii terra obruta; unde supra dictus sit natus, quem Oriona adpellaverunt, Schol. in Germanici Aratea p. 93.13 Breysig = Hes. fr. 148(b) Merkelbach-West, cf. Pind. fr. 73 Maehler). This story portrays the constellation's shape as a rawhide bedding with the stars Al Nitak, Al Nilam and Mintaka like stains in the genital region (in the standard view of the constellation they form Orion's belt). It also purports to explain the name with oupeZv, "to make water" (cf. Skt. vdrqati, "to rain"), itself a euphemism for O6wLXW, coyly used in this onanistic tale (cf. Anton. Lib. 41.4).3 Just as the epic form of Orion's name suggested that he hunted in the mountains (?v ... `pEaaL, Od. 11.574), so OUCpL'v likely suggested the tale of peeing (ou1pEv) on an oxhide rather than vice versa. If so, we can hypothesize an earlier *'OopL&amp;(v &lt; *'O0opL[Cv. *'OOpL&amp;)v may have become 'OxpL&amp;v in lyric to avoid the unsavoury-and silly-link to urine, because Greek (unlike Sanskrit, for example) prefers variety of vowel-quality,32 or through attraction in Orion's 29.

LX 4060.3 1).34 (Early Greek loan-words typically end in -oq, as AXLUn-to;, CaOi4Lv0oS, XcPU3pLv6o;, etc.; Wsir, Coptic oycipe or oycipi, would thus have become *`OaLp-oo, which in turn yielded these forms.) The determinative for the name Sxh, inscribed, for instance, on the north face of the coping-stone from Ammenemes III's pyramid at Dashur, is a man walking with a sceptre, looking backward and stretching behind him his left hand, which holds the star (Maspero 1902); in other words, the constellation is personified as a giant "long of leg and lengthy of stride" (PT ? 959, cf. Od. 11.572, Job 38.31), and Plutarch tells us that Orion is the soul of Osiris' son, Horus (Mor. 359C, E),35 which would explain the patronymic. As for Memnon, if he was pharaoh, he ascended the throne only once his father had become Osiris in Sxh, and Orion, like Cephalus (Hes. Theog. 986) and Clitus (Od. 15.250), is a doublet of Tithonus, comely and loved by Eos-for the constellation rises in the east like the dawn (cf. PT ? 820-21)-until jealous Artemis killed him (Od. 5.121). Once dead, he walks the asphodel fields below (11.572) in a symbol both Egyptian and Indoeuropean for posthumous bliss.36 Could a Mycenaean really have known such things? Bernal famously holds Egyptian influence on bronze age Greece to have been early and deep, and I have argued elsewhere (1993, 1994, 1996, 1997a-c) that Homer supports his view. Among Mycenaeans, what would those singing the songs that became the Aethiopis have known? To believe Homer, a stranger arriving in town would, like Odysseus on Scheria, soon go to the palace. There, not in the streets or stalls of the market among his fellow itinerant craftsmen (Od. 17.383-85),31 would he find 33.

(The bard's intimacy with her suggests that he was a eunuch, or, to use a musical term, castrato [cf. Hesych. &amp;o8o5o o 6U ,vo6Xor].38 If so, he resembled the spados who held great influence as harem-officials in Near Eastern courts. D. Page [1972] objects that Homer's bards are blind [cf. Od. 8.64], and so useless as chaperons, but they may have impaired their otherwise perfect sight while singing to bring themselves closer to the gods-a practice found for instance in Egypt, where written texts give harpists the standing epithet "blind," while some paintings and figurines show them blindfolded [Manniche 1991: 97-107].) Whatever his medical history, and allowing for aggrandisement in his self-portrait in the Odyssey, the bard was no mere entertainer, for he prophesied, like the first epic poet, Olen (Boeo fr. 2 Powell), he was remembrancer for the Muses, daughters of Memory (Hes. Theog. 53-54) who love to remember (Pind. Nem. 1.12), whose successor, Simonides was a memory-wizard (Cic. de orat. 2.86 = Simon. 510 PMG), and he advertised Achaean military might against the treacherous dandies of Troy, and the upper class against every strident Thersites of the unwashed rabble, and, in short, he was a cabinet minister or vizier. The bard's high standing is clear when Achilles. who would not dream of sullying his hands with banausic chores, whiles away the hours of his strike, bard-like, singing the famous deeds of men (II. 9.186-89). Even if we discount the picture of society that we find in the Iliad and Odyssey as anachronistic,39 and imagine bards typically living far from the palace, we must still admit that they met many foreigners. When the Hittite Suppiluliumas I (reigned 1380-1340) exiled his wife to the court of Ahhijava (KUB XIV, 2),4? when Philistine ambassadors came before the king of Danuna to coordinate the Sea Peoples' raids against Syria and Palestine (Albright 1950: 170), or when traders (or rather pirates, Od. 3.71-74) came with Egyptian ivory, ostrich-eggs, scarabs and mirrors, who knows what perishable goods, and above all news, an interpreter was needed.4' The only Mycenaean certainly fluent in Akkadian is the bard, for Greek epic borrows from Akkadian such motifs as the gods' division by lot of the universe (I1. 15.187-93 &lt; Atra-hasis 1.11-18 [cf. Gilgamesh 11.39-42 = ANET p. 93]), the herdsman attacked by his own dogs (Od. 21.362-65 &lt; Gilgamesh 6.63 = ANET p. 84), an ox-trotter hurled in insult (Od. 20.299 &lt; Gilgamesh 6.159 = ANET p. 85), the link of a magic boat to doves (Od. 12.61-65 &lt; Gilgamesh 38. Heubeck, West and Hainsworth 1988: 176-77. Could Phemius' and Demodocus' blindness be a mythic displacement of castration, as in the Oedipus story? 39. Scholars debate whether the epics depict any historical society, and if so, which one. Raaflaub 1997: 628 argues that, since "the social background of heroic poetry needed to be modern enough to be understandable, but archaic enough to be believable," it reflects the social reality of the late ninth and eighth-century Ionia. 40. Gurney 1961: 46, Huxley 1968: 5-6. 41.

B. AMMENEMES II AS MODEL FOR MEMNON? As for Ammenemes II as the specific model for Memnon, the period is wrong, Bernal admits, but one cannot rely on epic chronology: Pyrrhus, conceived while Achilles was hiding on Scyrus at the war's start could slay Priam by its end, just ten years later; Nestor never tires of saying that he has seen three generations. There are, though, two other problems with Bernal's idea. First, it relies on a possible, but entirely unprovable confusion of Ammenemes II and III. Second, Greek distorted Ammenemes' name. Besides Manetho's AtipievUi5, Diodorus gives two forms: Mzv8yr and Mo&amp;ppoos (1.61.1, cf. Ael. NA 6.7). While Strabo's manuscripts read ia'Jn&amp;v8nq (17.1.37), his epitomator reads MaciA8r (C. Muller, Geographi graeci minores, vol. 2 p. 632), editors A. Meineke and C. Muller-F. Dubner emend to'Ipo&amp;v&amp;)q, and H. L. Jones suggests further reduction to Mavi8n. The link between Ammenemes III (not to mention his namesake) was Memnon of the Memnonium of Strabo's other Ismandes according to a single word in his text, which editors judge without apparent bias a scribal error. Other models for Memnon have been mooted. Humban, "master of heaven," was at some points head of the Elamite pantheon (Hinz 1972: 44). His name was borne in various forms by several kings including Khumban-numena I, who reigned in the mid-thirteenth century. A later Khumban-numena (reigned 691 689) appears in the Babylonian Chronicles as Me-na-nu (I iii 15-26; Grayson 1975: 80, 221). G. Husing, on the doubtful premise that Susa was the Ethiopians' real home, proposed this king as Memnon's model.43 His idea has not won favour. Sethos I of Egypt (reigned 1318-1304) built his mortuary temple at Abydos north of Thebes. This precinct Greeks called a Memnonion (Strabo 17.1.42) and said that when the Ethiopians learned of Memnon's death, they hung wreaths on its acacia trees (Demetrius 643 F 1 FGrHist = Athen. 15.680b, cf. Plin. HN 5.60). It was a tourist spot, and in the fifth century they left graffiti there.44 W. Helck (1979: ? 2) thought that Strabo's statement that the Egyptians called Memnon'Ilas,uv8ns (17.1.42) stemmed from a confusion of Sethos with his son, s; 42. Division of the universe by lot: Schmidt 1981; herdsman attacked by dogs and ox-foot throwing: Gordon 1952; "wide-wayed" cities: West 1988: 169.

West 1997 looks fair to be the definitive study of these relationships for some time to come. 43. Huising 1917: 47, who says that the idea was first proposed by J. Oppert. 44. Perdrizet and Lefebvre 1919, Jeffrey 1961: 355. Sethos' prenomen, Mn-m;'t-r' is almost identical to that of his predecessor, Amenhotep III, viz. Nb-mi't-r', who, as we shall see, was also connected in antiquity with Memnon. It may be that the Greeks thought they had found Memnon because they thought they had found Nb-m?'t-r'.</page><page sequence="11">222 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 17/No. 2/October 1998 Ramses II, who finished his tomb. Ramses' prenomen, Wsir-m)'t-r' appears in the Bogazkoy archive as Ua-as'-mu-ua-ri-a (KUB III, 22 verse 1; Edel 1948: 22); Diodorus (1.47.1) gives it as'Oau,uav8u'a, Shelley's "Ozymandias, king of kings." Ramesside finds on Cyprus (Peltenburg 1986) and LH IIIA 2 - IIIB pottery in early nineteenth dynasty contexts at Saqqara (ancient Memphis; Hankey and Aston 1995) show close contact between Ramses' Egypt and Greece, so Helck may be right. Nonetheless, he is forced to suppose a confusion of Sethos and Ramses, and his case rests only on the tradition of a Memnonion, such as Greeks found all over the world (cf. Hdt. 5.54.2, 7.151). C. AMENHOTEP III AS MODEL FOR MEMNON? All these suggestions are weak one way or another. There remains, though, a possible Egyptian Ur-Memnon more promising than any discussed so far: Amenhotep III (reigned 1417-1379). C.1. The Vocal Memnon Amenhotep set up in the Theban necropolis two twenty-metre tall monolithic self-portraits of quartzose sandstone (Egyptian rwdt, Greek pocc3acvLr, Pliny NH 36.11.58) facing twenty-six degrees south of east, where the sun rises on the winter solstice (Lockyear 1894: 78). This orientation on that day per year when, longest delayed, it was most anxiously awaited, links them to dawn, as Greeks would have seen, for their temples, too, gave onto the rising sun (Plut. Vit. Num. 14.4, Lucian De domo 6; Dinsmoor 1939). Like all royal statues, they would have had an important cult (Helck 1966). The more northerly was broken in two either by Cambyses II of Persia during his invasion of 525 (Paus. 1.42.3, Inscription 29 Bernand, etc.) or by an earthquake (Strabo 17.1.46), probably that of 27 (Hieron. Chron. p. 164 Helm), for quakes are rare in Egypt (Pliny NH 2.82).45 From the part that remained intact about an hour after dawn (W"paq a, ora p(rima) Inscription 3.4, 5.4 Bernand, etc.) on certain days came forth a sound as though of a slight blow (6o'yoq 6q oiv Tc)Xvy o'u pisya&amp;X), Strabo loc. cit.), which one would best compare to the breaking of a guitar- or lyre-string ([ov] ocXLaCC elXc5t xL0cLpO'; ia INpos xysLcnS xop j;, Paus. loc. cit.). Greeks called it a statue of Memnon and the whole precinct yet another Memnonium. The odd noise drew pilgrims and tourists (e.g. Lucian Philopseudes 33-34, Toxaris 27, Tac. Ann. 2.61), who wrote on the statue one hundred and eight Greek and Latin texts between 20 and 205 of our era. Someone later restored it. A. J. Letronne thought that it was Septimius Severus when he visited in 170 of our era (cf. S.H.A. Sev. 17.4), perhaps since the statue, loquacious for Hadrian, did not speak to him 45. The most recent occurred at 3 p.m. local time in Cairo on 12 October 1992, measured 5.3 on the Richter scale, and claimed at least 340 lives; no damage to ancient monuments was reported (Manchester Guardian Tues. 13 Oct. 1992 p. 20).</page><page sequence="12">GRIFFITH: The Origin of Memnon 223 (and indeed no inscription marks his visit), and because he hoped to reclaim the favour of the embattled pagan gods as Stesichorus had done with his palinode (192 PMG = PMGF; Anonymous 1875). G. W. Bowersock (1984 = 1994: 253-66) noted that the last dated text rules out Septimius as conservator, and puts the lack of an inscription down to want of available space. He suggests that Zenobia of Palmyra restored the statue when she conquered Egypt in 272 of the common era.46 Whoever did it, the repair was disastrous: the noise ceased abruptly, and the colossi survive to this day in silence.47 As to the noise, Strabo (loc. cit.) suspected fraud, and the motif of living statues like the figures on Achilles' shield, who converse like living mortals (c4ttXsUV &amp;' t- cool 3po-roL, II. 18.539),48 could have inspired someone to concoct the miracle of a speaking stone (qkeyy6oLEvo0 X'LOo, Manetho 609 F 2 [p. 38] FGrHist) based on prior equation of hero and king. E. Salverte and G. Wilkinson, following Strabo, thought that priests hammered a ringing stone hidden in the statue's lap; yet why not so reward Hadrian's wife, Sabina (cf. Inscription 30 Bernand)? Ancients except Strabo believed the noise a true miracle. Modems, though, think it natural. Geological noises exist, for instance, the "song of the sands," the sound of cascading dunes, thought more common on the moon and Mars than in earthly deserts.49 Rarer but more pertinent is the sound that air makes passing through pores in solid rock as the temperature rises at sun-up (MacGillivray 1857: 203-204).5? J. Dusaulx suggested two centuries ago that this explains the Vocal Memnon, and Napoleon's scientific commission and H. Brugsch heard such noises at Karnak.51 If this is right, the statue's shape was crucial. This and its silence after the repair suggest that the noise depended on the damage, and was not an original property of the statue. As to the damage itself, scholars tend to write off the first explanation, Cambysian vandalism, as product of anti-Persian feeling of Greeks or Egyptians, who accused Cambyses of many crimes, starting with slaying the Apis-bull (Hdt. 3.29).

The inhabitants of Rhodes-an important stepping-stone for ideas between Egypt and Greece-were fabled to have tied their statues' feet to keep them from running away (Schol. Pind. 01. 7.95a [1.220-21 Drachmann]). See Morris 1992: 215-37.

The blame rests, then, with the quake. Since Greeks explained the noise as Memnon greeting his mother (Philostr. Imag. 1.7.3, Callistratus Descriptiones 9), some think they first called the statue Memnon after 27,52 while for others the noise chanced to confirm established legend (Grimal 1992: 224). If it resulted from the damage, and the damage occurred in 27 (and we have seen reasons to believe both), the second view is right, for three papyri in Turin's Regio Museo Egizio (nos. 5, 7 and 11) call the precinct "the Memnoneia" already in the sixth year of the co-regency of Cleopatra III and Ptolemy IX Soter II (i.e. 112/1).53 Furthermore, the statue greeted the dawn from the start, as its orientation shows. (After the nineteenth dynasty, Hittites drove the Egyptians from the Aegean. Never again until Greeks founded Naucratis around 610 did they re-encounter Egypt.54 It is no surprise, then, that we hear of the Vocal Memnon first in Ptolemaic times.) C.2. The Name "Amenhotep" If the noise but confirmed a prior equation, one might guess that the equation stems from similar names. As to sound, the pharaoh's nomen, 'Imn-htp, "Amun is pleased," is transliteratedAuE'vWyL (Manetho op. cit., Turin Papyrus 6.5-6, 7.3), or Ae'v&amp;O (Balbilla, Inscription 29.3 Bernand)55 and his prenomen, Nb-m;'t-r', "Ra is the lord of truth," appears in the Amarna tablets twelve times as Mi-im mu(-u)-ri-ia (26.8 etc.). The linking of Amenhotep to Memnon might involve this prenomen, because Greek graffiti in the twentieth dynasty Ramses VI's tomb call him Memnon, since, as J. Baillet first saw, Ramses shared Amenhotep's prenomen.56 As to sense, Amenhotep's names were theophorous, containing those of the gods Amun and Ra, who were different facets of the sun, and, according to Philostratus, certain Egyptian priests claimed that Memnon was named after his mother (&amp;iho tic tiyup6o Etovo,u&lt;[wv], VA 4). Eos differs from the sun less than first appears. The Egyptians portrayed the sun as a falcon-headed man called "Horus of the horizon," and as a part of his reformation, Amenhotep's heir, Akhenaten moved his government in its sixth year north to a new site, modern Amarna, which he named Akhetaten, "horizon of the sun-disk." Its hieroglyph (N 27 in A. Gardiner's sign-list) shows that the word "horizon" in both names means the place of sunrise. In other words, the sun was most revered at dawn. Conversely, 52. E.g. Courtney 1980: 593 ad Juv. 15.5. 53. Wilcken 1927-1957: vol. 2, no. 189, 191 and 192 (pp. 190-97), quoted by Gardiner 1961: 91. 54. Well, almost never.

Eos resembles Amun-Ra all the more for anyone rash enough to think that Akhenaten's rayed sun-disk inspired Homer's formula "rosy-fingered dawn," po8o86cxtuXo);'HcS (Griffith 1993). C.3. Amenhotep as the Model for Memnon It is hard to imagine that Greeks conflated Amenhotep with a preexisting Memnon, because their names were, at best, vaguely similar. They might, though, have modelled Memnon on him. This view was advanced, after a suggestion of C. Smith, by P. Gilbert.57 Perhaps since Gilbert put his case in an Egyptological journal, classicists have unwisely ignored it.58 We can state Gilbert's four points in light of recent evidence. First, Amen hotep's Aegean contact is proved by nine scarabs and vases found at Mycenae bearing either his cartouche or that of his wife, Tiy,59 by the twelve Aegean sites named in his mortuary temple at Kom el-Heitan just west of the colossi, includ ing Messenia (Mdn), Nauplia (Nprj), and even Mycenae (Mwkn), for it would be perverse to think of the namesake Cretan town (cf. Vell. Pat. 1.1.2, Pliny HN 4.59) when Amenhotep's cartouche was found on objects at the city in the Argolid,60 and by LH IIIA 2 - IIIB pottery found in a tomb from his reign at Gurob, and at Amama.6" This evidence must be seen in the context of Mycenaean travel as far afield as Spain (and perhaps even Britain).62 Though he called himself as part of his "Horus name" k} n6t 6' m w?st, "Strong-bull-arising-in-Thebes," it was with Memphis that Amenhotep had closest ties: as heir-apparent, he was likely priest at the Ptah-temple there, and as pharaoh he built himself a shrine next door (Morkot 1990). Ptah's temple gave its name to Memphis, JHwt-k-pth (Book of the Dead 15.1 etc.), which, on Brugsch's palmary hypothesis,63 Greek borrowed, via Akkadian IHi-ku-(up-)ta-ah (EA 84.37, 139.8), as A'Lyu7to; (cf. 57. Smith 1892: 465, and Gilbert 1939: 48-49. 58. Gilbert is not mentioned, for example, in Bernal's 1987, 1991 discussion. See, however, Lloyd 1976: vol. 1.121.

Gurob: Stubbings 1951: 94; Amarna: Merrillees 1973. In general, see recently Hankey 1993. 62. On Spain, see Morris 1992: 117. On Britain, see Stone 1958: 99. Evidence for Mycenaeans in Britain is above all the carving of a dagger on stone 53 of trilithon 2 of Stonehenge in Wessex discovered by R. J. C. Atkinson in 1953, the closest parallels to this form of dagger being those from the shaft-graves at Mycenae. Herodotus' Tin Islands (xacwaLCepL8e, 3.115) may have been the British Isles; see Rice Holmes 1907: 483-98, and Stella 1965: 196 n. 8.

Second, Memnon was Priam's ally, as Amenhotep married to cement military pacts with eastern sovereigns (marriage and military pacts are linked in Greek epic in the oath of Tyndareus, Hes. fr. 204.69-84 [40-46] Merkelbach-West, cf. II. 9.337-39). As well as his "great king's wife," the Egyptian Tiy, Amenhotep mar ried Giluhepa, daughter of guttarna II of Mitanni, an event commemorated in a se ries of scarabs (Blankenberg-van Delden 1969: 129-33), Tadu-Kheba(t), daughter of Tusratta of Mitanni, and the daughter of Kadagman-Enlil of Babylonia' (recall Diodorus' claim that Memnon was an Assyrian ally at Troy, for Assyria was still part of Babylonia). Proof that Amenhotep dominated these alliances is that he refused to marry his own daughter to Kadasman-Enlil (EA 4.6-7). Third, Memnon was son of Eos, as Amenhotep claimed descent from Amun Ra. As with any pharaoh, the first name of his royal protocol was the "Horus-name" that cast him as Horus, sun-god and first pharaoh, incarnate, and the fifth and last name, the "nomen," included since Djedefre, a pharaoh of the fourth dynasty, the phrase sm-r', "son of Ra" (Gardiner 1957: 72-74). But Amenhotep was Amun-Ra's son in a special sense. Bas-reliefs on the west wall of the "Birth Room" (room R in Baedeker's plan) of the Amun-temple at Luxor show the god coming to Amenhotep's mother, Mutemuia, disguised as his earthly father Tuthmosis IV and begetting him.65 The accompanying text reads in part (Campbell 1912: 25): Saith [Amon-Ra, King of gods] Lord of the Thrones of the Two Lands, Presiding over the Apts66 (Karnak): He hath made his forms (appearance) like the majesty of this husband, King of Upper and of Lower Egypt, Ra-men-Kheperu (Thothmes IV), Giver of Life: [he found] her reclining on her couch in the beauty of her palace; she waked at the odour of the god;67 she was glad before his majesty; he advanced towards her at once, he ... to her, he made her see him in his form of god when he came upon her;68 she exulted at beholding his beauty; his love went into her 64. Grimal 1992: 223. A fuller list of dynastic marriages involving princesses of Arzawa, Enilasi and Ammia is given by Schmidt 1993: 159. See also Kitchen 1962 and Schulman 1979. 65.

The idea that gods have a special odour was to have a long history in Greek thought (e.g. Theoc. 7.16, Ap. Rhod. 4.403-34, Anacreontea 1.8, 13, Verg. Aen. 1.403-404). See Lohmeyer 1919, Schmid 1923, and Boumoure 1983. 68. The gods appear naked before the dead pharaoh (PT ? 303, ? 488). By contrast with the idea of odour, the notion that gods could appear undisguised to mortals is foreign to Greek, as to Hebrew thought. When gods walk the earth, they are disguised (Od. 17.485-87, Ov. Met. 1.212-13, 8.611-724, Plaut. Amphitryo, cf. Acts 14.12) and one looks upon them in their true form at one's peril (e.g. Pind. 01. 2.25, Eur. Bacch. 6-12, Exodus 33.18-23, Ezek. Ex. 101, Apul. Met. 5.23). Similarly, they wear clothes (Xenophanes 21 B 14 Diels-Kranz) and cannot be seen naked with impunity (Eur. Hipp. 86, Apollod. Bibl. 3.4.4) until Praxiteles broke this rule by sculpting the nude Cnidian Aphrodite (Pliny NH 36.20). See Rose 1956: 65, Dietrich 1983, and Hollis 1990: 341-54.</page><page sequence="16">GRIFFITH: The Origin of Memnon 227 members; the odours of the god flooded the palace (?); all his fragrance was from Punt. Whether Amenhotep spread this story through shame at his descent (A. Erman 1890 thought that Mutemuia was Mitannian)69 or from blind devotion to his eponymous Amun is unclear. The only known precedent is the miraculous conception of Hatsepsut shown in the Amun-temple at Der el Bahri. On the strength of the story, Amenhotep adopted the sobriquet "the Dazzling Sun-Disk," which was not a standing, but an idiosyncratic title, like Louis XIV of France's le Roi-Soleil. No Greek hearing the tale would think of Memnon; what comes to mind is Zeus' tryst with Alcmena disguised as Amphitryon and the birth of Heracles (Apollod. Bibl. 2.48, Plaut. Amph. passim), a story very rich, as M. Bettini (1994) has shown, in highly interesting cultural models. But Zeus is no sun-god, and to keep Amun-Ra's solar character while telling the story, a Greek must have twisted it. We have already seen that Amun-Ra resembled Eos. This would explain why Memnon's divinity is on the distaff side, for'H&amp; is feminine, as is also sometimes the North Semitic word for "sun," SmS.70 Moreover, the maternal family, the more important in a hero's pedigree and education,7' is the fitter to be divine. Fourth, Amenhotep is handsome in his portraits, like Memnon (Od. 11.522) and unlike Akhenaten, who seems a victim of adiposogenital dystrophy (Frohlich's syndrome)-obese and epicene (Aldred 1968: 134). One point Gilbert neglects. Amenhotep's real father was Dhwty-ms, "Thoth has begotten him," hellenized as Tou66,wLa (Manetho 609 F 2 [p. 39] FGrHist), a name resembling TiOccv. That Tithonus ages but never dies, and suffers greatly from this misfortune (Hymn. Hom. Ven. 218-38) recalls Ethiopian longevity, changed in Greek fashion to a warning against striving for immor tality (cf. ydL, pAXa QuXa', f3ov &amp;6&amp; VcOTov aM68e, Pind. Pyth. 3.61-62). Pharaohs were not long-lived, but, as Mycenaean bards perhaps knew (Burkert 1973), were fierce archers, often being buried with their bows. The laminated, non homogeneous bows of the eighteenth dynasty (MacLeod 1958) are longer than the simple weapons they replaced, and H. Last mused that in dubbing the Ethiopi ans 1iXxp6 LOtL, ostensibly "long-lived," Herodotus was confusing fLo36 ("bow") and P'Log ("life").72 69. For her biography, see Pridik 1942. 70. E.g. mar [ga]ma? [s]d ti-ra-am Samas, "(the king is the) son of the Sun, whom the Sun loves," (EA 323.22-23), where ti-ra-am is a feminine form of the verb rdmu, "to love." Cf. wattdbWc lahem hassemes, "and the sun set upon them" (Judges 19.14) where wattdboc is third person feminine imperfect qal of the verb bo. 7 1. Bremmer 1983, and Robbins 1993: 11-12. 72. Last 1923. Mocxp6'Loq is first used (in the sense "long-lived") in Hdt. 3.23, 114 (cf. 1iaxpof3Lotoq ... aL-/ xv, "long life," Aesch. Pers. 262-63); the meaning "long-bowed" is first attested in Et. Mag. 3.23 s.v. &amp;ftLO(.</page><page sequence="17">228 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 17/No. 2/October 1998 V. Loret found Amenhotep's half-rotten mummy, and G. E. Smith's autopsy early in our century showed that he died probably in his forties of natural causes;73 yet, as "Osiris Nb m?'t r'," he became immortal like Memnon. Amenhotep never waged war in Asia Minor or elsewhere, save for a minor action against the Nubians at Ibhat in the Sudan; yet his propagandists amplified that one campaign, so that even Eusebius knew that in his reign Ethiopia was in contact with Egypt (Chron. 53F [vol. 7 p. 38b Helm]).74 D. CONCLUSION In short, Bemal argues well that epic based Memnon on a real person, rightly seeks him in Egypt, but fails to rule out Amenhotep. In the compound, familiar ghost that is Memnon, whatever Ammenemes' role, folk-memory of Amenhotep must loom large. Queen's University Griffitd@Post.QueensU.Ca BIBLIOGRAPHY Albright, W. F. 1950.
