Peter Byrne's book is a valuable addition to the discussion of religious realism. His agenda is ambitious, given the book's length, for he seeks not only to make a substantive contribution to the debate in philosophy of religion, but also to argue against several broader forms of anti-realism that may motivate religious anti-realism. The principal strengths of the book lie in the way it lends additional clarity to the structure of the debate about religious realism, and Byrne's pro vocative concluding argument that while it is plausible to interpret common theistic discourse (hereafter, 'folk theistic discourse') in a realist fashion, it is not possible to do so when discursively developed in theology. In the course of this review, an overview of the entire book is provided, but my discussion will focus primarily on these two aspects of the work. At the outset, Byrne pursues the laudable goal of imposing order on the sometimes unruly conversation about realism in theology and philosophy of religion. He begins by defining what he takes to be the central question: 'Can the apparent intent behind talk of God to refer to an entity existing in some sense beyond us and the universe be taken seriously?' (4, author's emphasis). As the formulation of the question makes clear, Byrne sees the central issue to be whether to interpret the theist as intending to refer to God, not whether the attempted reference is successful - i.e. not whether God's existence is a metaphysical fact. The content of the 'minimal theistic realism' Byrne outlines in his first chapter may be summarized as follows: A Intent to refer to the extra-mental: Folk theistic discourse involves an attempt to refer to and make statements about a reality that exists independently of human cognizing (5, 16). B Transcendence of the intended referent: That to which the theist is attempting to refer is transcendent - i.e. not only ontologically dis tinct from human beings but also capable of exercising a causal power on the universe to bring about order and/or good that is over 347</page><page sequence="2">348 Book reviews and above those causal powers investigated by the empirical sciences (15-16). Byrne's classificatory scheme of anti-realist views and the remainder of the book are structured around these two theses. The first and most basic distinction he draws is between anti-realists who are such based on 'global' vs 'contrastive' considerations. The global variety (discussed in chapters 2 to 5) rejects the first thesis above by insisting that it makes no sense to speak of a mind-independent reality. Contrastive theistic anti-realists (discussed in chapters 6 and 7), on the other hand, may grant that human beings can refer to and makes statements about a mind-independent reality but contend that there is something essentially problematic about attempting to refer to God and so reject the second of theistic realism's claims. Varieties of theistic anti-realism can be further subdivided according to whether they are reductionistic vs instrumentalist and by whether they are offered as descriptions vs revisions of theistic discourse. Having sketched the conceptual framework within which Byrne will work, let me return to comment on his central contention that labelling a view 'realist' or 'anti-realist' should not hinge upon whether the view's proponent believes the attempted reference to be successful. Byrne contends that to make the desig nation hinge upon belief in success would obscure the fact that the disagreement between theists and atheists obviously depends on their sharing a conception of the intent of theistic discourse (4). This concern is legitimate. However, some readers familiar with realist views in other areas of philosophy may find it surprising to utilize a means of classification that renders belief in the success of the intended reference largely irrelevant to the designation, 'realist' (more on the qualification, 'largely' below). That is, while Byrne is certainly correct that there is no univocal use of the word 'realist' in philosophy, there is, I would hazard, a prevalent tendency to use the term to refer to proponents of views that defend the success of the relevant intended reference. Below, I further suggest that the issue is not merely terminological, for Byrne's disavowal of the relevance of success becomes strained at later points in his own discussion. As noted above, some theistic anti-realists hold their view because they deny on a more global scale the existence of a reality independent of human mental representations. In chapters 2 to 5, Byrne defends its counterpart, innocent realism. According to innocent realism, there is one reality, the existence and definite character of which is largely mind-independent. It is the character of this reality that determines whether our representations of it are true or false (23-24). Here then, is a case where the use of the term 'realist' in another area of philos ophy (metaphysics) presupposes belief in the success of at least the minimal reference to the existence of an extra-mental reality. As Byrne notes, the success of this reference is crucial if theistic realism is to get off the ground, for if it makes no sense at all to speak of a mind-independent reality to which we are capable of</page><page sequence="3">Book reviews 349 referring, then we cannot take seriously the theist's intent to refer to God. Byrne does not attempt to mount a positive defence of innocent realism but instead defends what he regards as a more or less naive commitment to it in the face of particular arguments offered to unseat it. If these challenges can be turned back successfully, then one will have grounds for resting content with one's naive belief. Here is a quick overview of the book's middle chapters. In chapter 2, Byrne rejects the allegation that innocent realism is itself incoherent insofar as it requires the achievement of a transcendent perspective outside human concepts and language from which one can judge whether one's representations of reality are accurate. He argues in chapter 3 that the innocent realist can go some dis tance in acknowledging, as the conceptual relativist maintains, that concepts play an inescapable role in the formation of human experience without agreeing that reality itself is entirely constructed by that conceptualization. Against the contemporary heirs of verificationism, he holds in chapter 4 that innocent realism need entail no particular theory of meaning and certainly not one that imposes empiricist strictures on what it means to say that something exists. Two postmodernist challenges are taken up in chapter 5. The first, which con tends that linguistic meaning is unavoidably indeterminate and thus incapable of playing the representative role realism requires, is rejected as either a version of conceptual relativism or dependent upon a caricature of innocent realism. In reply to the second challenge - that what passes for truth is nothing more than an illegitimate expression of power - Byrne concedes that what has passed for truth has sometimes reflected illegitimate interests but argues that the remedy for this requires the truth of innocent realism. Though some familiar with the wider literature to which Byrne refers may occasionally feel that due consideration has not been given to one of these challenges to innocent realism, my overall sense is that these middle chapters will be helpful to readers, especially those whose focus formerly has been restricted to the realism debate in theology and philosophy of religion. In chapter 6, Byrne turns from forms of theistic global anti-realism to contrastive anti-realists who allege that one cannot take seriously the purported intent of theists to refer to a transcendent reality (above, claim B of minimal theistic realism). He considers two varieties of contrastive anti-realism. The descriptive sort (exemplified in the work of D. Z. Phillips) contends that one misinterprets folk theistic discourse in an important way when one understands it as the realist recommends, since it unnecessarily saddles the theist with grossly anthropomorphic or patently incoherent views. Byrne does a nice job here arguing that a realist interpretation of theistic discourse need entail no such consequences. The second form of contrastive anti-realism he discusses is revisionist. Though revisionists typically do not question the theist's intent to refer to an extra-mental transcendent reality, Byrne regards sonie revisionists as</page><page sequence="4">350 Book reviews doing just that by insisting that a revision of theistic discourse is now mandatory, given certain fundamental convictions of a contemporary Western outlook (e.g. Don Cupitt's argument that realism in incompatible with personal autonomy, a bedrock value). Byrne exposes the serious shortcomings of several such argu ments and argues that whatever merit some might have is far from sufficient to make revision mandatory. In the final chapter, Byrne mounts his most provocative and intriguing argu ment. Having defended a realist interpretation of folk theistic discourse in the previous six chapters, he now argues that one cannot possibly understand theo logical discourse - the systematic and discursive elaboration of claims about God - in a realist manner. The two premises of the argument are: (1) All disciplines that can be interpreted realistically show the accumu lation of reliable belief. (2) Theology does not show the accumulation of reliable belief (162). The first premise is supported by appeal to the empirical sciences as our best model of a form of enquiry that generates an accumulation of reliable belief. By ' reliable belief', Byrne means beliefs that survive a critical procedure shared by a discipline's practitioners designed to confirm or disconfirm those beliefs. That some scientific beliefs survive such a process - sometimes across large-scale theory change - he contends, is best explained by supposing that they result from 'real-world influences' and that they thereby successfully track mind-indepen dent truths about the character of the world (159). Byrne takes the second premise of his argument to be nearly self-evident. Using the history of Christian theology as his example, he argues that the tradition exhibits no accumulation of insight into the nature and workings of God - that one could not claim to know anything more about the nature of God today than did the early Church Fathers. This, he contends, is due to the absence of a shared critical procedure for sorting true and false beliefs, illustrated by the existence of rampant religious sectarianism. Since there is no accumulation of reliable belief in theology, there is no good reason to think that these beliefs track truths about God. One of the enticing things about this succinctly presented argument is the way it opens up larger fertile topics for discussion - e.g. whether the empirical sciences should be taken as a model for all disciplines that aim to generate true beliefs and how best to explain developments in the history of Christian theology. Setting these larger issues aside, I will focus my comments on three smaller issues. First, the argument presupposes the ability to distinguish folk from theological discourse. The boundary line here is not at all clear. Perhaps the best way to handle this concern is simply to acknowledge the ambiguity, point to paradig matic examples, and note that while many distinctions are subject to this kind of ambiguity, this typically does not lead us to think that such distinctions are unreal.</page><page sequence="5">Book reviews 351 Second, note how the success of referential intent has taken a prominent position in this chapter. The issue of whether scientific discourse is to be interpreted as realist is primarily a matter of whether there is reason to think that it succeeds in referring to and characterizing a mind-independent reality. In parallel fashion, theology is indicted because there is no good reason to think that it succeeds in its intention to reveal God's nature and workings in greater depth. Again, as in the second and sixth chapters, Byrne might mean to handle this within his established framework by suggesting that the success of the theolo gian's intent is only indirectly relevant insofar as the claim here is that the intent cannot be 'taken seriously'. However, maintaining that intent rather than success is still the central issue seems strained to me in these last two chapters. One way to remove this strain and make transitions to other discussions of realism more fluid would be to make the following friendly amendments to Byrne's definition of theistic realism and classification scheme. First, add a success condition to the two earlier theses that constitute theistic realism: (C) Success of the intended reference: At least some of the theist's statements about the existence and nature of an extra-mental transcendent reality are true. A second adjustment would address Byrne's legitimate concern that we not label every atheist an anti-realist in virtue of rejecting this condition. This involves trading the two-option scheme that says one must be either a realist or a non realist for a scheme that allows for three alternatives. On this scheme, one may be a realist, an error theorist, or an anti-realist about theistic discourse. (This is meant to parallel a popular way of carving up options in meta-ethics.) A genuine theistic realist must embrace all three theses. If one rejects the success condition alone, then one is an error theorist. An error theorist grants that theists intend to refer to an extra-mental transcendent reality but concludes that they never suc ceed. Traditional atheists would fit into this camp. One is properly labelled an anti-realist only if one rejects one or both of the first two theses (and thereby the success condition as well). Amending Byrne's view in this way would also make plain the road to revisionist forms of anti-realism. The revisionist first defends an error theory about theistic discourse and then recommends a revision of that discourse in non-realist fashion. Finally, I admit to being puzzled by a section of this final chapter wherein Byrne argues against construing the theological project along pragmatist lines. One might have thought, given Byrne's argument for theological anti-realism and his expressed tolerance for some forms of revisionist anti-realism, that he would be open to re-conceiving the theological project in pragmatist fashion. His objections are twofold: (1) that such authors often seem to shift from advocating a conception of God on the basis of its usefulness (e.g. in promoting certain moral or political ideals) to speaking as if such conceptions accurately mapped the nature of the</page><page sequence="6">352 Book reviews divine (171-172); and (2) that such theology often fosters an uncritical acceptance of the underlying moral and political ('left-wing liberal') ideals by lending the authority inherent in God-talk to the promotion of those ideals (173-174). Here, I would simply note that while particular theologians may be fairly criticized for lack of care on these points, it is not clear how these faults are entailed by theo logical pragmatism itself. As is evident from the foregoing, this is a book rich in thought-provoking arguments. Students (advanced undergraduate and graduate) as well as profes sionals working in philosophy of religion and theology will find much of value here. Anti-realists about folk-theistic discourse and theological realists will find both familiar challenges presented rigorously and new challenges demanding a reply.
