TRAVIS HANES III Southwestern University We must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern; a class of persons, Indian in blood and color, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals, and in intellect. Thomas Babington Macaulay, Minute on Indian Education The concept of cultural interaction as a major force in the emergence of a modern global civilization should by now be axiomatic. The free flow of ideas across cultural and geographic boundaries has long been recognized as a fundamental pattern of world history, and a significant factor in the growth and expan sion of "civilization." The spectacular expansion of Europe after the fifteenth century greatly accelerated this process and has led to even more extreme examples of cultural cross-fertilization. The results have often seemed strange, even bizarre, to the original cultures. One thinks of the curious transformation of Christianity and Confucianism that resulted in the Taiping movement of the early nineteenth century in China?a consequence (at least in part) of European infiltration of the Manchu empire. Or again, the Ethiopian, African Methodist Episcopal, and Watch Tower reli gious movements in southern Africa, in which Christian and * I am belatedly indebted to Professor Gail Minault of the University of Texas, who encouraged me to pursue the idea for this article more than a decade ago.

Nor has the process been confined to the obvious realm of orthodox missionary activity. Freemasonry, a European esoteric movement of considerable syn cretic capacity with an underlying doctrine that draws on both Christian and non-Christian traditions, has played a role in the emergence of modern nationalist elites in countries like Iran and Turkey. As the last two examples might suggest, with the extension of direct European control over so much of the non-European world in the past two and a half centuries, the process of cultural inter action has taken on an increasingly significant political dimen sion. Consequently, perhaps the most significant theme of world history in the modern era has been the emergence of nonwestern nationalism and modern state-building as a response to European imperialism. The synthetic arguments of Ronald Robinson and John Gallagher, combining as they do various strands of diplo matic, strategic, and economic interpretations, have provided a useful theory with which to evaluate the complexities of the impe rialist-nationalist equation. At the heart of this approach lies Robinson's concept of "collaboration," the mechanism by which imperialists sought to extend their control and extract power from "colonial" territories as cheaply as possible, and by which indigenous "collaborators" made the best bargains possible with imperial overlords in pursuit of their own goals of individual or group interest. Such collaborators, Robinson suggests, did not "betray" their own people, but rather through collaboration gained enough knowledge and power eventually to turn the tables on the imperialists. So far, however, the argument has been cast solely in political and economic terms, with little appreciation of the intellectual and cultural implications. Yet even at such practi cal levels the collaborative process was a complex one, often involving a mingling of European and indigenous cultural and intellectual traditions and the emergence of new, syncretic politi cal cultures and elites.1 1 For the Robinson and Gallagher thesis as it bears upon this discussion, see especially Robinson's seminal article, "Non-European Foundations of European Imperialism: Sketch for a Theory of Collaboration," in Edward R.

Such a study, by identifying the basic elements of the Indian case, may point the way toward future investigations into processes of cul tural syncretism that have provided the bases for other nonwest ern nationalist movements. Such studies in turn may provide sufficient grounds for developing a larger theory of how cross-cul tural developments arising from the imposition of colonial rule have been crucial to the emergence of modern indigenous nation alisms. They may also reveal the extent to which such national isms are neither wholly indigenous nor wholly European, but reflect instead the emergence of new syncretizing elites whose principal function has been to mediate between the competing world views of "modernist" imperialists and "traditionalist" colo nial peoples. The focal point of this study is the role of the western-educated Indian (primarily Hindu) elite that emerged in the nineteenth cen tury as collaborators of the British raj, and specifically their rela tionship with three movements critical to the syncretic process in India: the Brahmo Samaj, the Arya Samaj, and the Theosophical Society. The first two developed principally as indigenous Hindu responses to the religious and cultural impact of British rule in the subcontinent; the latter was of western origin, imported to India in 1879. Although the Brahmo and Arya Samajes tried in dif ferent ways to appeal to western-educated Hindus by advocating the reform of Indian culture and its synthesis with western educa tion, neither was able adequately to integrate the two and at the same time to provide western-educated Indians with the self-con fidence and the necessary organizational structure for political development. The Theosophical Society provided both, and at the same time demonstrated that cultural synthesis was a two-way street by attracting prominent Europeans as well as western-edu and S. R.

Straddling the religious and intellectual gulf sepa rating Hindus, Buddhists, Parsees, Sikhs, Christians, and even some Muslims, the Theosophical Society brought together a re markable group of Indians and Europeans who would go on to launch the Indian National Congress, the first all-India national ist political movement. The Dilemma of the Western-Educated Elite in India Under early nineteenth-century administrators, such as Thomas Babington Macaulay, the British in India deliberately created a class of western-educated Hindus, who would act as an intermedi ary cadre of civil servants between the white raj and the Indian masses. After the trauma of the Indian Mutiny of 1857, however, these western-educated Indians fell under suspicion in the eyes of the British authorities. Their prospects were considerably less ened, as was their status in the official social hierarchy of the raj. Having been trained as the preeminent collaborators, western educated Indians were nevertheless cast adrift by their imperial overlords, condemned to a perpetual twilight existence between two worlds, no longer wholly Indian nor yet fully British. As a consequence, in the latter half of the nineteenth century this small, western-educated elite confronted a crisis of identity, brought on by the strains of reconciling the heritage and limita tions of their birth with those of their education and training. In the course of producing the new class of "brown English men," the British in India had set in motion a process of cultural interaction that involved several stages. First, western-educated Indians were largely subject to disengagement or detachment from their traditional society and culture. In the aftermath of the Enlightenment, Western values had grown increasingly secular and materialistic. Under the influence of an emerging "scientific" paradigm, the European world view had become predominantly rational and mechanistic. Such a conception of reality was com pletely at odds with the traditional "spiritual" paradigm that pre vailed in India. Yet to assimilate their education successfully, the new Indian elite had to accept, at least in some fashion, the Euro pean world view. This in turn meant largely rejecting their own heritage as "superstitious" and "unenlightened." Second, the increasing racial discrimination that marked British rule in India after the Mutiny also meant that western-educated Indians were not accepted as full members of British or European society. In</page><page sequence="5">Hanes: Origins of the Indian National Congress 73 short, having been forced to give up their traditional cultural identity, they were not allowed to replace it with the same cul tural identity that had provided the foundation for their educa tion. Prevented from returning to a traditional Indian identity by the world view they had imbibed with their education, and equally prevented from being fully assimilated into British soci ety by their heritage and the color of their skins, western-edu cated Indians could only resolve their dilemma by achieving some sort of synthesis between the two extremes. This effort at synthe sis marked the third and most complex stage of the process of cul tural interaction. Fitting in well with a long-standing Indian tradi tion of religious reform movements, this stage initially involved indigenous efforts to reconcile traditional Hindu culture with the most striking features of the new Western culture?science and technology. As the expectations raised by their education contin ued to be denied by the British, however, in the best traditions of their intellectual training, western-educated Hindus also increas ingly viewed cultural and intellectual synthesis in political terms. The result was the emergence in the 1880s of a nascent nationalist movement that strove not for revolution nor even for indepen dence from the British, but simply for adequate reforms that would permit western-educated Indians to take what they re garded as their rightful place, under the raj, in the government of their country. In short, Indian nationalism initially represented a kind of political attempt at cultural reconciliation. In accepting the beneficence and superiority of the British educational system, western-educated Indians came to regard themselves as the natural indigenous leaders and spokesmen of India. If British methods were superior, then they, as the only indigenous practitioners of those methods, must also be superior. Predictably, they began to seek appropriate outlets for their tal ents and training. Yet even with a western education, the field of professional opportunities in India for holders of advanced de grees was extremely limited. Crucially, the most important pro fession?as well as the most potentially lucrative?open to West ern-educated Indians was the law.2 2 The most firmly entrenched of the indigenous professions was medicine. Western medical practice, however, to which the western-educated elite would have had access, gained comparatively few Indian adherents, and Europeans in India would have been loath to patronize an Indian physician. As for traditional</page><page sequence="6">74 JOURNAL OF WORLD HISTORY, SPRING 1993 Not only did the majority of western-educated Indians pursue law as a career, but many even went to England for their training. Whether in India or in Britain, an education in English law inevi tably meant exposure to the principles of the English constitu tion. By the mid-nineteenth century, English constitutional law and its history were already imbued with a mythology of the advance and triumph of liberty over bondage, justice over tyr anny. To the western-educated Indian such a philosophy promised great things. "When in the inscrutable dispensations of Provi dence, India was assigned to the care of England," wrote one English-trained lawyer, Pherozeshah Mehta, "she decided that India was to be governed on the principles of justice, equality, and righteousness without distinctions of color, caste, or creed." It was but a short step to the application of English legal principles to political reform. Dadabhai Naoroji, a major figure in early Indian nationalism who gave up a career in mathematics to become a Liberal member of the British Parliament, wrote early in his career, "We have only to persevere, and I am satisfied that the English are both willing and desirous to do India justice." Years later, in the face of continuing British intransigence, he reiterated that through the law his own generation of western educated Indians "had their eyes first opened to the high charac ter of British institutions and they have become attached to them. They cannot now readily throw aside their first love." Thus the early leadership of western-educated Indian politicians found themselves oriented completely toward ideals propagated by the British themselves.3 The product of western education and indoctrination, the new elite could only find a natural expression for their talents in West ern institutions, and in India this meant above all the government of India itself. As they sought fuller participation in the govern medicine, this was primarily Ayurvedic, and required a commitment to traditional Hindu customs and beliefs. Prospects in the engineering field were even worse. The (British) Government of India was the principal employer, and the major source of engineers was Thomason College in the Northwestern Provinces, where Anglo-Indians held a virtual monopoly over the department. For the development of Indian professional opportunities see Seal, Emergence, and B. T. McCully, English Education and the Origins of Indian Nationalism (Gloucester, Mass., 1966). The term Anglo-Indian has several meanings; throughout this paper I have used its nineteenth-century sense to refer to those British who made their lives and careers in India. 3 Mehta is quoted in Majumdar, History, p. 381; Dadabhai Naoroji is quoted in Seal, Emergence, p. 254.</page><page sequence="7">Hanes: Origins of the Indian National Congress 75 ment, however, they soon ran up against two major elements of resistance: the color bar that separated British rulers from the ruled, and the existence of alternative collaborators for the raj, in the persons of traditional religious leaders and the Indian princes. The traditional Indian aristocracy, and religious leaders in particular, provided a constant reminder to western-educated Indians that there were those with a greater "cultural legitimacy" who might more plausibly claim to speak for the vast majority of Indians untouched by western values and training. Moreover, as the politically articulate western-educated elite increasingly sought to break the British monopoly of power, the government itself supported the Indian aristocracy as a counterbalance to "half-educated" Indians in the administration of the country. The British sahib-logs much preferred traditional "national leaders," with whom they might hunt a tiger, to the western-educated arrivistes who had the temerity to quote Blackstone's Commenta ries and Magna Carta to them.4 The new Indian elites thus found themselves in a dilemma. Their education and intellectual modes of personal self-identifica tion denigrated the cultural inheritance that the British imperial ists now identified as essential to any claims of indigenous leader ship. Moreover, in adopting what was virtually a new cultural identity, many had cut themselves adrift from those bases of Indian support on which a successful indigenous nationalist movement would have to depend. Traditional caste laws, for example, prohibited Hindus from crossing the sea or from eating with people outside their caste. Those who opted for educational opportunities in British schools therefore had to break caste, sep arating themselves from their traditional society, often even from their families, until elaborate rites of purification had been per formed?rites that seemed absurd according to the Western para digm they had learned in school. At the same time, government policy prevented them from developing a professional identity based on their education by restricting career prospects. Many western-educated Indians responded to both problems, attempt ing to resolve their cultural identity crisis through Hindu reform movements, and their career dilemma through political reform movements. Yet with their new Western perspective, they also began to think about India as the British themselves did?not as a 4 For British officials' attitudes, see especially Seal, Emergence, p. 134.</page><page sequence="8">76 JOURNAL OF WORLD HISTORY, SPRING 1993 hodge-podge of separate provinces and local states, but as a sin gle, vast imperial entity. Cultural and political movements that remained strictly provincial would no longer satisfy their needs: through education, their vision had been raised to the all-India level. Beginnings of Synthesis: The Brahmo Samaj in Bengal Indian cultural and religious movements provided the back ground against which the politicization of the western-educated Indian elite took shape. By the mid-nineteenth century, the chal lenge of both Christianity, as preached by increasing numbers of missionaries, and the scientific paradigm embodied in Western education had forced indigenous Indian intellectual leaders to reexamine the bases of their traditional modes of thought. Many interpreted the triumph of British imperialism throughout the subcontinent as a failure of indigenous institutions, particularly Hinduism, to provide the kind of moral as well as technical base necessary for Indian unity against imperial aggression. Given the West's technological superiority, there were only two possible solutions if they were to regain control over their own destinies: they could either repudiate their indigenous heritage and adopt Western culture wholesale, or they could try to absorb Western ideas and technology without losing India's unique identity. Unwilling to repudiate their own culture, most opted for the lat ter course. The result was the emergence of reform movements designed to purge Indian civilization of its "backwards," "super stitious" elements and to find in Hinduism a fundamental set of moral and philosophical principles that would not be inconsistent with Western science and technology.5 That such a cultural synthesis could be achieved without los ing touch with the indigenous Indian inheritance was the primary message of the Bengali Hindu reformer, Raja Rammohun Roy. Roy was one of the most important Hindu reformers of the early nineteenth century. Heavily influenced by Unitarianism, he iden 5 On Rammohun Roy and the Brahmo Samaj, see especially David Kopf, The Brahmo Samaj (Princeton, 1979). Reform movements have a long history in Hindu ism, from the emergence of the forest schools and the Upanishads to the present. What was distinctive about those of the nineteenth century was precisely their effort to assimilate Western ideas by purifying the religion of its "superstitious" elements, as embodied in the Puranas.</page><page sequence="9">Hanes: Origins of the Indian National Congress 77 tified himself as a "universalist." His primary interest was in comparative religions, and especially in practical efforts to iden tify their commonalities through a process of synthesis. Roy believed that Hinduism, at least in its original Vedic form, was uncompromisingly monotheistic. Puranic, or popular, Hinduism he believed to be a perversion of the original religion, which he aimed to restore to its original purity. Consequently, he preached a return to the Vedanta in particular as the true foundation of Hinduism. Since he was a universalist, however, Roy's efforts to reform Hinduism were neither solely theological nor even predi cated on a conception of Vedantic Hinduism itself as the ultimate religious expression of humanity. Just as the universalism of Uni tarianism appealed to Roy, so too did its emphasis on social reform. During the 1820s, at a time when Unitarians focused on the plight of industrial workers in England, Rammohun Roy took up the cause of Indian women in Bengal. He preached the aboli tion of sati and child marriage, and he condemned the traditional bans on remarriage of widows. To carry out his program, in 1828 Roy founded the Brahmo Sabha in Calcutta.6 Rammohun Roy's reforms were expressions of his own ration alism, the fruits of his labor to achieve a religious and cultural synthesis of East and West. Although he fully endorsed Western education as a move toward this synthesis, Roy was not an Angli cist like Macaulay. He never assumed the superiority of the West. Both his ideas and their presentation reflected the influence of the Orientalists, who preferred to see India retain its unique cul tural identity and evolve along its own path of development. Indeed, he analytically and systematically defended the theology contained in the Vedas against all Christian attacks. Focusing on the principle of the unity of God, in his "Reply to Certain Queries Directed Against the Vedanta" Roy demonstrated not only that the doctrine existed in the Vedas, but also that its presentation in the Hindu scriptures was actually superior to that of the Bible. The Bible, he argued, was prone to anthropomorphism?in his view a particularly egregious error for self-proclaimed monotheists like Christians and Jews to make. Nor did he appreciate the nuances of Trinitarian doctrine. Thus Roy used the methods of the Orien talists to uphold the legitimacy of "true" or "pure" Hinduism, 6 Ibid., especially pp. 12-13; see also Tara Chand, History, pp. 180-81.</page><page sequence="10">78 JOURNAL OF WORLD HISTORY, SPRING I993 while at the same time calling for an infusion of Western modern ism to reform the corrupt popular version.7 After Rammohun Roy's death in 1833, the Brahmo movement lost touch with the wider world of Unitarianism. Under Roy's suc cessor, Ram Chandra Vidyabagish, the Brahmo Sabha backed away from the more universal implications of the founder's thought; until 1843 it essentially became simply another Hindu sect preaching the "purification" of the religion by a return to the original, unadulterated Vedic doctrines. In that year, however, Debendranath Tagore (father of the Indian nationalist, Rabin dranath Tagore) became the guiding force of the movement, which he renamed the Brahmo Samaj. Tagore's principal goal was to revitalize Brahmoism as a vehicle for theological and social renewal. Although Tagore reinstated some of Roy's universalism, in the face of increasing Christian propaganda he also reasserted both the cultural and theological primacy of Vedantic Hinduism. Where Rammohun Roy had advocated cultural as well as reli gious synthesis, Tagore presented Brahmoism as an indigenous cultural alternative to both "superstitious," "unenlightened" Pu ranic Hinduism and Unitarian and Trinitarian forms of Christi anity.8 Tagore used the Brahmo Samaj as a religious and cultural base, but in fact he was primarily a social reformer. Through the Tattvabodhini Sabha, a group organized before his revitalization of the Brahmo Sabha, he had attracted progressives of all types, men like Akkhoy Kumar Dutt, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Har ish Chandra Mukerji, and Rajendra Lai Mitra. Many of these adherents had little or no interest in religion, being almost exclu sively interested in social reform; all were members of the west ern-educated elite. Yet despite his efforts at general Hindu reform, Tagore never carried the message of the Brahmo Samaj beyond the boundaries of Bengal. The heart of the movement remained Calcutta, and though both the Brahmo Samaj and the Tattvabodhini Sabha were decisively influential in the develop ment of western-educated Bengali Hindus, the so-called bhadra lok, they had little impact on the rest of the western-educated Indian elite. 7 Ibid. The following sections are drawn from Kopf, The Brahmo Samaj, unless otherwise specified. 8 K. W. Jones, Arya Dharm (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1976).</page><page sequence="11">Hanes: Origins of the Indian National Congress 79 In 1855, the arrival in Calcutta of an American Unitarian mis sionary, Charles Dall, revived much of the earlier interest in Uni tarianism among some members of the Brahmo Samaj. Tagore and Dall never achieved a very friendly relationship, but the Unitarian minister did befriend Keshub Chandra Sen, one of the most popular and influential younger Brahmos. Sen became the leading proponent of Unitarian precepts within the movement. As Tagore increasingly emphasized his commitment to Hindu culture, and Sen pursued Unitarian universalism, a split be came inevitable. In 1866 Sen and his followers broke with the original movement to establish the Brahmo Samaj of India, com mitting themselves for the first time to creating an all-India move ment. The message of the new Brahmo Samaj of India was that Truth was to be found in all religions and philosophies, though never in a pure form. Although Sen's path did lead to an all-India evangel ism, by deemphasizing the Hindu component and overemphasiz ing the Unitarian the new organization lost much of its cultural legitimacy in the eyes of the western-educated elite. Its universal ism undermined its usefulness as a viable cultural vehicle for reassimilating the western-educated elite with their indigenous heritage. Indeed, by 1878 Sen had traveled so far toward his Naba Vidhan, or New Dispensation, that he seemed beyond the pale of both Hinduism and Unitarianism?a remarkable feat given the all-encompassing nature of both. Thus, while the Adi Brahmo Samaj of Debendranath Tagore pursued a course of cultural nationalism effectively confined to Calcutta and Bengal, the Brahmo Samaj of India carried a message of cultural antina tionalism to the rest of India. Both movements profoundly affected the cultural identity of the western-educated Hindu elite; neither provided a viable cultural base on which an all-India political expression for that elite might develop. The factional ism and fragmentation that weakened the Brahmo movement and prevented its emergence as the principal cultural foun dation of western-educated Indians became especially appar ent in the Punjab in the 1870s, when it was challenged by yet another reform movement, the Arya Samaj of Dayananda Sara swat i.9 9 On developments in the Punjab, see Seal, Emergence, chap. i.</page><page sequence="12">8o JOURNAL OF WORLD HISTORY, SPRING I993 Efforts at Synthesis in the Punjab: The Case of the Arya Samaj The case of the Arya Samaj and Hindu reform in the Punjab pro vides a useful contrast with Brahmoism in Bengal. As one of the first points of contact between Western and Indian cultures, Bengal had seen the emergence of a western-educated Indian elite, the bhadralok, much earlier and much faster than the rest of India. Consequently, by the 1870s Bengali responses to Western challenges were far advanced along the road of cultural reform and synthesis. In the Punjab, on the other hand, British influence and cultural interaction with Hinduism were complicated by two factors: first, the existence of a Muslim majority in the province; and second, the initial importation of western-educated Bengali administrators to help establish British rule. While Hindu-Mus lim rivalry tended to dilute reformist energies, the existence of an already educated administrative class delayed the development of a western-educated Punjabi group. Not until the late 1870s and early 1880s did the first generation of western-educated Punjabis begin to emerge from the colleges. At the same time, however, due to their late appearance, these western-educated Punjabis were less detached and isolated from their cultural heritage than their Bengali counterparts. Moreover, the ever-present Muslim chal lenge reinforced their Hindu identity. Consequently, the new Pun jabi Hindu elite repudiated the eclectic approach of Brahmoism, declaring it a non-Hindu movement, and flocked instead to Saraswati and the Arya Samaj: under Saraswati's influence, the movement for reform in the Punjab remained firmly within the bounds of traditional Hinduism.10 Dayananda Saraswati is rightly recognized as the greatest Pun jabi Hindu reformer of the nineteenth century, but he was not in fact a Punjabi by birth. He was born the son of a Shaivite Brahmin in the state of Gujarat in 1824. Like Rammohun Roy, he early rejected many aspects of orthodox Hinduism, and at the age of twenty-one he left his home and family to become sannyasi, a spir itual mendicant. After wandering the roads of India for nearly fif teen years, in i860 he became a follower of Swami Virajanand Saraswati, a Punjabi ascetic. Under his guidance, Dayananda soon 10 For Dayananda Saraswati, in addition to Jones, see especially J. T. F. Jor dens, Dayananda Sarasvati (Oxford, 1978). It should also be noted that differences between Brahmoism and Aryanism reflected not only a geographic distance but also a temporal one?the former emerged before the Mutiny, the latter after it.</page><page sequence="13">Hanes: Origins of the Indian National Congress 81 developed the basis and goals of his future teaching. Like many reformers before him, he became convinced that true Hinduism, the Hinduism of the Vedas, had been corrupted by "false texts," such as the Puranas. His goal was a complete Hindu reform through a return to the pure Aryan faith of the Vedas. This did not mean, however, that he rejected all elements of Western culture? quite the contrary. Ironically, perhaps, Dayananda owed much of his success to his greatest rival, the Brahmo Samaj. Although in the end Brahmoism in the Punjab found support only among the Bengali immigrants of the province's cities, the movement did act as a catalyst for reform in the province. In par ticular, it seems to have influenced Dayananda Saraswati's meth ods, if not his overall theology. At first, Dayananda tried to reform Hinduism from the top down. He retained the dress and manners of the sannyasi and concentrated almost exclusively on convert ing his fellow Brahmins. In 1872, however, he accepted an invita tion from Debendranath Tagore to visit the leaders of the Brahmo Samaj in Calcutta. The visit resulted in a complete transforma tion of his external methods: he adopted contemporary dress, exchanged Sanskrit for Hindi, and aimed his message at educated non-Brahmin Hindus. In 1875, he formed the first Arya Samaj in Bombay, but it was not a success. In 1877, after visiting Delhi for the great Durbar proclaiming Victoria as empress of India, he was invited by several Punjabi devotees to visit Lahore, where his lec tures soon created a sensation. He attacked idol worship, child marriage, traditional death rites, and even food prohibitions. Par ticularly controversial was his assertion of Vedic infallibility. In July 1877 the Lahore branch of the Arya Samaj held its first offi cial meeting, and the movement was fully under way. In addition to emphasizing purification of the Hindu religion on "Aryan" (by which Saraswati meant Vedic) principles, the Arya Samaj explicitly called for social action: The primary aim of the Aryasamaj is to do good to mankind, i.e. to ameliorate the physical, spiritual, and social condition of all men. No one ought to remain satisfied with his own welfare. The welfare of the individual should be regarded as included in the welfare of all. Even more important, the new society increasingly emphasized application of modern scientific insights to reaffirm the "puri fied," "original" Hinduism:</page><page sequence="14">82 JOURNAL OF WORLD HISTORY, SPRING 1993 Thus the highest speculations of modern science dovetail very wonderfully with the ancient Aryan belief which asserted that all [the] universe has come into existence out of one primal element, the akas. True, this theory of our ancient rishis when first known to the western world was ridiculed and set down as another exam ple of the diseased imagination of the Asiatics. But the arguments . . . show that far from being a subject of contempt, this ancient theory of evolution of matter is amply justified by the researches of modern science. The Arya Samaj thus presented western-educated Punjabi Hindus with a culturally legitimate modern ideology that would not nec essarily alienate them from their religion or families. Where Brahmoism had led the bhadralok further away from even a reformed Hinduism, in its effort to reconcile Hindu culture with Western training, "Aryanism" provided an alternative solution: "a chance to acquire English education without fear of conversion, of the loss of one's soul to Christianity or godless materialism."11 Dayananda Saraswati's death in 1883 marked a transition in the movement he had founded. As a memorial to their founder, the various branches of the Arya Samaj decided to establish an educa tional program of their own designed to provide an English educa tion as well as a firm grounding in the tenets of "Aryan" Hindu ism and associated subjects. In the process, however, they simply exposed the structural weaknesses in the movement's organiza tion: practically speaking, there was no coherent organization at all. Dayananda himself had increasingly retreated during the last years of his life from the daily demands of leadership of the Arya Samaj. As a result, each local organization had become virtually independent and reliant on its own resources. The Lahore branch was the largest and wealthiest, but it had no authority over the others. Despite general agreement among the branches on major questions of direction, there was no apparatus for developing and implementing a unified policy. Consequently, three years passed before the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic Trust and Management Society emerged as the central organizational structure to oversee the educational program of the Samaj as a whole. Moreover, as the trust finally succeeded in establishing first the Dayanand Anglo Vedic High School and then the Anglo-Vedic College (1889), its P?li cies raised dissent within the movement.12 11 Jones, Arya Dharm, pp. 34-35. 12 Ibid., p. 32; Sankai Ghose, The Western Impact on Indian Politics (Bombay, 1967), p. 174; and Jones, Arya Dharm, p. 31.</page><page sequence="15">Hanes: Origins of the Indian National Congress 83 As the Samaj confronted the needs of its new schools, a rift occurred between those who saw their task in primarily religious terms and those who emphasized the practical (that is, Western) aspects of the educational program. In 1894, the religionists seceded from the Samaj. Once again, the attempt to reconcile Western education with Indian cultural reform had failed to sus tain both a culturally legitimate synthesis and an organizational structure that might serve as a platform for an all-India political movement. Although the education movement provided a useful demon stration of the possibilities in Indian cultural adaptations of West ern educational methods, it also diverted the energies of the new Punjabi elite away from all-India political expressions into purely provincial solutions of their cultural dilemma. At the same time, the involvement of Dayananda and the Arya Samaj in militant defense of "Aryan" Hinduism, including ideological attacks on the Christian, Sikh, and especially Muslim creeds (exemplified by the development of cow-protection societies) served to polarize these elements of Indian society. Where the Brahmo Samaj had compromised its cultural usefulness by straying too close to West ernization, the Arya Samaj, by its intransigent ideological devo tion to Vedantic Hinduism, undermined the entire concept of an Indian cultural (and much more so, political) unity. Indeed, one result of the Punjabi Arya Samaj program was intense competi tion between newly educated Punjabis and the older Bengali elite for administrative posts. Neither the Bengalis' eclectic, synthetic reformism nor the Punjabis' traditionalist reform could provide the necessary cultural underpinning for a political consciousness for western-educated Indians. In 1879 this requirement was filled by yet another movement, this time from outside India altogether ?the Theosophical Society. The Synthesis Achieved: The Theosophical Society Founded in 1875 in New York by Col. Henry S. Olcott, a New Eng land veteran of the U.S. Civil War, and Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, a Russian ?migr?e and cousin of Count Witte (Czar Nicholas II's great minister), the Theosophical Society developed out of the spiritualist movement in Europe and the United States. Initially concentrating on psychic phenomena, or "scientific mysticism" as they called it, Theosophy claimed its roots in the Western occult tradition of neo-Platonism, the Kabbala, Rosicru cianism, and Freemasonry. From its inception, the Society de</page><page sequence="16">84 JOURNAL OF WORLD HISTORY, SPRING 1993 voted itself to bridging the gap between religion and modern sci ence. At the same time, it sought to free religion itself from "superstition" and sectarianism: "What we desire to prove is that underlying every ancient popular religion was the same ancient wisdom-doctrine, one and identical, professed and practiced by the initiates of every country, who alone were aware of its exis tence and importance." Early in its development the Society began to distance itself from Christianity (at least the exoteric varieties), moving instead toward the "purer" doctrines of the East. In Olcott's inaugural address on 17 November 1875, he spoke of the "primeval source of all religions, the books of Hermes [Tris megistus] and the Vedas," and promised that the Society would demonstrate to Christians "the pagan origins of many of their most sacred idols and most cherished dogmas."13 Perhaps because of its increasingly anti-Christian bias, by 1878 interest in the Theosophical Society had begun to wane. Olcott and Blavatsky responded by establishing contact with other West ern esoteric groups, such as Freemasonry. Early in the year, how ever, a chance meeting between Olcott and Moolji Thackersay of Bombay, a devotee of Dayananda Saraswati and the Arya Samaj, provided an even better object for the Theosophists' interest. A brief correspondence resulted in the mistaken impression (on both sides) that the goals of the two societies were the same. Next, the Theosophical Society council voted to merge with Dayanan da's organization. In May 1878, the group officially changed its name to the Theosophical Society of the Arya Samaj. The merger, and the subsequent break it engendered, were to have significant ramifications not only for the Theosophical Society, but also for the future of Indian nationalism.14 Amalgamation with the Arya Samaj reinforced the Theosophi cal Society's move away from Christianity. "A number of Ameri 13 For a brief scholarly account of the Theosophical Society, see B. F. Camp bell, A History of the Theosophical Movement (Los Angeles, 1980). The most impor tant published source for the period under discussion is Col. Henry Steele Olcott, Old Diary Leaves: The History of the Theosophical Society, 6 vols. (Adyar, 1972-75). There is an extensive literature on Blavatsky. See especially John Symonds, The Lady with the Magic Eyes: Madame Blavatsky?Medium and Magician (New York, i960); for a contemporary view, V. S. Solovyoff, A Modern Priestess of Isis (London, 1895). Blavatsky was suspected by the Indian government of being a Russian agent. The quotations are from H. P.

Olcott," The Theosophist 53 (August 1932): 502-516. 14 For the relationship between the Theosophical Society and the Arya Samaj, see both Campbell, A History, and especially Jordens, Dayananda.</page><page sequence="17">Hanes: Origins of the Indian National Congress 85 cans and other students who earnestly seek after spiritual knowl edge," Olcott wrote in his first letter to Saraswati, place themselves at your feet and pray you to enlighten them. They are of various professions and callings, of several different countries, but all united in the one object of gaining wisdom and becoming better. For this purpose, they ... organized themselves into a body called the Theosophical Society. Finding in ... Christi anity nothing that satisfied their reason or intuition ... they stood apart from the world, turned to the East for light, and openly proclaimed themselves the foes of Christianity. . . . For this reason, we come to your feet as children to a parent, and say "look at us, our teacher: tell us what we ought to do.... We place ourselves under your instruction." The anti-Christian sentiments could hardly have failed to appeal to Dayananda. (Even later, after meeting the Theosophists, he was convinced of their compatibility and willingness to follow the rules of the Samaj.)15 Shortly after amalgamation of the two societies, the New York branch of the Theosophical Society received the rules of the Arya Samaj. As Saraswati's sectarianism became apparent, many with in the Theosophical Society's ranks began to have doubts about the merger. Eventually these doubts led to dissolution of the for mal association and creation of yet another society, allied with the Arya Samaj, to which Theosophists were encouraged but not required to subscribe. When their followers proved less adven turesome in pursuit of knowledge and wisdom, however, Blavat sky and Olcott themselves decided the time had come to forsake Manhattan for the "Mother of religions"; in February 1879 they arrived in Bombay. The Theosophists were warmly greeted by the Aryas. Indeed, they were soon taken up by the local Indian press as celebrities. Olcott's first act upon disembarkation had struck a chord in the indigenous imagination: "The first thing I did on touching land was to stoop down and kiss the granite step; my instinctive act of 'pooja'! For here we were at last upon sacred soil." The symbolism of this act, combined with a plethora of public statements from the two Europeans portraying India as "the cradle of the race," had an electrifying impact on educated Indian society. This was 15 Quoted in Jordens, Dayananda, p. 209.</page><page sequence="18">86 JOURNAL OF WORLD HISTORY, SPRING 1993 not just another exhibition of Orientalism, extolling the past vir tues of Indian civilization, but a testimony to the present-day worth and vitality of India and its indigenous culture.16 Blavatsky and Olcott reinforced their new-found popularity by taking up residence in the Indian section of Bombay, where they lectured and actively promoted the development of associations for the study of Sanskrit. Their public correspondence grew to such proportions that they finally established a magazine, The Theosophist, to propagate their ideas. Drawing on their associa tion with the Arya Samaj, by 1884 they had chartered over 100 branches of the Theosophical Society across the Indian subconti nent. The society attracted western-educated Indians and also liberal Anglo-Indians, many of whom were prominent and re spectable members of the British community. (One of the most important was A. P. Sinnett, the influential editor of The Pioneer, who later became a leading proponent, not to say propagandist, for the movement.) The very success of the movement, however, soon resulted in strains between the Theosophical Society and the Arya Samaj itself. Although Blavatsky and Olcott tended to gloss over the differences between their creed and that of Dayananda, after a trip to Ceylon, during which they publicly announced their conversion to Buddhism, a break was inevitable.17 The final break between the Theosophists and the Aryas came in 1882, amid recriminations on both sides. Dayananda charged the Theosophists with having deliberately misled him, in order to use the Arya Samaj for their own publicity. For their part, Blavatsky and Olcott accused the Arya leader of trying to become a "Hindu pope." During the exchange, however, Blavatsky was very careful not to attack Hinduism itself. "We have not changed our opinion of God," she wrote publicly at the time, "as the cause of all things visible . . . and of the Vedas as the fountain-head of all religions." But the Theosophical Society itself, she asserted, was 16 H. S. Olcott, Old Diary Leaves, 2:13-14 (also quoted in Campbell, pp. 78-79). 17 For the trip to Ceylon and Dayananda's growing disillusionment, see both Campbell, A History, and Jordens, Dayananda. The Theosophist was apparently begun with considerable financial help from prominent Anglo-Indians, notably Allan Octavian Hume, discussed below. In August 1882 Hume apparently controlled the journal's finances sufficiently to force Blavatsky into publishing an article implicitly criticizing herself.

The effect of publicizing all their correspondence was to cast the Theosophical Society into precisely that role of cultural synthesis which Indian reform movements had been unable to fill for the western-educated Indian elite.19 Despite Blavatsky's insistence that Theosophy was not a reli gion, she herself provided the basic scripture of the movement, Isis Unveiled, complete with its own highly complex cosmological system. The basis of the doctrine was that Humanity was only one stage of the Divine Consciousness evolving through matter on its way back to the Godhead from which it had emerged. The van guard of Humanity were the Mahatmas, the Masters of the Himalayas, perfected human adepts of many ethnic origins who through eons of spiritual evolution, physical birth, and rebirth, had at last mastered their passions and broken free of the wheel of karma. Together they constituted the Great White Brotherhood (the term white referred not to race but to white light, which "is made up of and encompasses all the colors of the spectrum"), a universal spiritual organization working on both "inner planes" and in the outer world to assist the evolution of those who came after them.20 The esoteric doctrines of the Theosophical Society may strike the modern reader as rather bizarre, but it is important to remem ber that occultism, which in its broadest sense was quite compati ble with Hinduism and Buddhism, remained a part of the main stream of European intellectual life well into the seventeenth century. Even after the beginning of the Enlightenment, it contin ued to hover in one form or another on the fringes of European culture, periodically breaking out in some mystical literary, artis 18 Quoted in Jordens, Dayananda, p. 212. 19 Quoted in Campbell, A History, p. 78. 20 For the original formulation of Theosophical doctrine, see Blavatsky, Isis Unveiled, and The Keys to Theosophy (Pasadena, 1972).</page><page sequence="20">88 JOURNAL OF WORLD HISTORY, SPRING I993 tic, philosophical, or even theological form, not to mention esoter ically oriented movements such as Freemasonry and Rosicru cianism. In the last half of the nineteenth century occultism expe rienced a considerable vogue and drew the interest of leading statesmen and scientists. Indeed, spiritualism, the immediate pro genitor of the Theosophical Society, had also spawned the per fectly respectable Society for Psychical Research, which engaged the interest of such eminent Victorian political families as the Gladstones, the Balfours, and the Cecils, as well as scientists like Sir Oliver Lodge and Lord Kelvin, not to mention popular writers like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.21 Perhaps just as important for Indians as Theosophical doc trine, however, was the Society's organization. Through its annual conventions, first begun in December 1881, the Society soon pro vided the organizational catalyst necessary for an all-India politi cal movement. These yearly Theosophical conferences were the first gatherings to bring together members of the western-edu cated Indian elite and liberal Britons from the entire subconti nent. The topics for formal discussion ranged from highly specific elements of Indian language and culture to religious ideas and their compatibility with modern Western civilization. A major theme that recurred frequently was the growing materialism of the West and the innate spirituality of the East. Articles in The Theosophist suggest a general consensus in the Society that India's heritage was essential to the "evolution" and "salvation" of the increasingly "decadent," "materialistic" West. As might be expected, it was not long before many members made the leap from such cultural questions to politics. At the 1884 Theosophical conference in Madras, Raghunath Rao, former diwan of Indore state, suggested that the annual "conventions" should openly concern themselves with the politi cal and social advancement of India. Although Blavatsky refused to countenance the idea, insisting that the Society must publicly "eschew all questions relating to politics and sociology," Rao per sisted and convened a meeting in his own home of those Theo sophists interested in political questions. After considerable dis cussion, the local members established a new provincial society, 21 On occultism generally and the Society for Psychical Research, see Janet Oppenheim, The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914 (Cambridge, 1986).</page><page sequence="21">Hanes: Origins of the Indian National Congress 89 the Madras Mahajana Sabha, and then drew up a detailed program calling for the establishment of an all-India polit ical organization.22 The following month, under the influence of Nurendranath Sen, proprietor of the Indian Daily Mirror and a leading Bengali Theosophist who had been present at the meeting in Madras, the Indian Association of Calcutta under Surendranath Banerjea also began to plan for an all India political conference, to convene in Calcutta the follow ing December. Clearly, despite Blavatsky's reticence, the Theo sophical Society had become a hothouse for Indian political growth.23 Yet if the annual Theosophical conferences provided the set ting for the development of all-India political schemes, they were not the only contribution made by the movement to Indian nation alism. Indeed, although the Society later claimed that through the work of the Theosophists in the Madras Mahajana Sabha and the Indian Association of Calcutta it had been "the parent of the Indian National Congress," neither organization was the immedi ate predecessor of the congress. Even as Rao and his associates were planning another meeting to coincide with the Theosophical conference of December 1885, and Sen and Banerjea were develop ing their scheme for a national conference to be held in Calcutta shortly thereafter, a rival plan for Indian political organization was being given definite shape by a retired English member of the Indian Civil Service, Allan Octavian Hume. It was Hume's Indian National Union?based largely on the Bombay Presidency Associ ation, later supported by the Madras and Poona groups, as well as others throughout the subcontinent?that convened in December 1885 as the Indian National Congress. Hume too, however, was heavily influenced by the Theosophical Society in his efforts to advance the cause of Indian nationalism?perhaps even more pro foundly than his Indian colleagues in Madras and Calcutta. Cul tural synthesis worked both ways.24 22 See note i above. I have drawn most heavily in the following sections on Mar tin, New India, and Mehrotra, Emergence.

Sen was probably the author of the plan for an all-India political association. 24 Ibid.</page><page sequence="22">90 JOURNAL OF WORLD HISTORY, SPRING I993 The Synthesis Incarnate: A. O. Hume and the Indian National Congress Allan Octavian Hume was by all accounts a remarkable man. Apart from his reputation as the "father" of the Indian National Congress, he was an ornithologist of international reputation. Reform came to him naturally: his father was Joseph Hume, a radical social reformer in Britain and the man who had moved the repeal of the Corn Laws in Parliament. The younger Hume decided early in life to make his career in India, and he first enlisted under the banner of the East India Company in 1849. He soon broke from the traditional mold of an Englishman in India, however, and became an outspoken supporter of Indian social reform and political aspirations. During the Mutiny of 1857 he was district magistrate at Etawah, on the Grand Trunk Road between Delhi and Cawnpore, and was later decorated for his bravery dur ing the fighting. In the aftermath, he gained a rather unfortunate reputation (at least as far as his fellow Anglo-Indians were con cerned) for leniency toward the mutineers, particularly when it came to imposing the death penalty. He later served in the upper levels of the Indian Civil Service, but was passed over for the high est offices (notably a seat on the viceroy's council) during Lord Lytton's viceroyalty, primarily because of his liberal notions. In 1882 he retired from the Service to Simla. In 1883, however, Hume gained both the ear and the respect of the new Liberal viceroy, Lord Ripon, who soon began to employ him as an adviser on "native" affairs.25 Hume's main advantage as an adviser to the viceroy on "na tive" affairs was his ability to stand in both camps, British and Indian. This ability had been greatly enhanced in 1880, when he joined the Theosophical Society. Since the color bar governing relations between rulers and subjects effectively prohibited con tacts outside the office, Hume found the Theosophical Society an ideal place to socialize with prominent western-educated Indians as well as Anglo-Indians like A. P. Sinnett. Quickly appreciating the possibilities, by 1881 he had become president of a Simla 25 The only biography of Hume, William Wedderburn's Allan Octavian Hume, "Father of the Indian National Congress," 1829-1912 (New Delhi, 1913), is not very satisfactory. Wedderburn was a friend and colleague and glosses over the esoteric elements of Hume's life and thought. Other important evaluations are in Martin, New India, and Mehrotra, Emergence.

Hume brought to his work with the Theo sophical Society the same liberal convictions and passions that had effectively stunted the growth of his career in the Govern ment of India. Particularly during the annual conferences, he established ties with men like Raghunath Rao, Nurendranath Sen, Ananda Charlu, Kashinath Telang, and Subramania Iyar from all over India.26 Apart from the Society's social opportunities, equally impor tant to Hume was the Theosophical doctrine. He was fully con vinced of the existence and influence of the Mahatmas. It was these spiritual adepts, Hume believed, who inspired the Theo sophical Society and also inspired his plans for social and politi cal reform in India. In a letter to Lord Ripon, Hume claimed to have been initiated into this Brotherhood, or "Association" as he called it, in Paris in 1848, although he had strayed from it shortly thereafter and was only reintroduced to it by Blavatsky in 1880. The point is well illustrated in his correspondence with Ripon, which is replete with Theosophical references. For example, Hume once replied to the viceroy's compliment on his under standing of the "native mind" in the following vein: What you say about my knowledge of the natives shows me that you altogether overrate me. ... I generally can learn . . . the out come of cogitations of the native mind, but not from any superior acumen or knowledge of my own, but simply because a body of men, mostly of Asiatic origin, who for a variety of causes are deeply and especially interested in the welfare and progress of India, and who possess faculties which no other man or body of men living do, for gauging the feelings of the natives, have seen fit, knowing how thoroughly I also have the good of Aryavartha at heart, to give me their confidence to a certain limited extent. Hume was referring to the Great White Brotherhood. Clearly, his conviction that he was engaged in the work of the spiritual guides of humanity, who had apparently decreed that India must move forward politically as well as socially and culturally, significantly influenced his efforts to organize a national congress. In fact, this was probably the most direct Theosophical influence on the emerging Indian nationalist movement.27 26 See the literature cited in note 25. 27 Hume to Ripon, 25 December 1883, quoted in Martin, New India, p. 68. The Hume-Ripon correspondence in the Ripon Papers is perhaps the most important</page><page sequence="24">92 JOURNAL OF WORLD HISTORY, SPRING 1993 There is considerable controversy, even now, about the actual origins of the Indian National Congress. The meeting at Raghu nath Rao's house in Madras in December 1884 has been claimed by some scholars (not to mention the participants themselves) as the immediate predecessor of the Congress. Hume himself was not at this meeting, however, primarily because he had fallen out with the founders of the Theosophical Society and had largely with drawn from active participation in its organizational structure. Instead, he was in Bombay working with western Indian leaders, particularly Dadabhai Naoroji and B. M. Malabari, toward the creation of what he hoped would be a truly national Indian politi cal movement. The immediate result was the creation of yet another provincial organization, the Bombay Presidency Associa tion, which fell far short of his aspirations for an all-India organi zation. Undaunted, Hume continued to work throughout 1885, wooing his former Theosophist colleagues and friends around India, as well as other leaders among the western-educated Indian elite, to join in an all-India political conference to be held at Poona in December 1885. The one group with which he does not seem to have coordinated his efforts (although, despite later spec ulation, the two movements were certainly aware of each others' existence) was the Indian National Conference in Calcutta. The reasons for this apparent oversight have elicited considerable speculation from Indian scholars over the years: the most plausi ble explanation lies in Hume's strained relations with the Theo sophical Society, especially Madame Blavatsky.28 To a considerable extent, Blavatsky had based her leadership of the Theosophical Society on her ability to communicate with the so-called Mahatmas, or Masters, of the Himalayas. This com munication was carried on primarily by a curious correspon dence, in which Blavatsky would place letters in a carved wooden shrine, from which they would "de-materialize," apparently hav ing been teleported to the Masters. Sometime later, the Mahat mas' answers would appear in the shrine or come falling from the sky (occasionally they appeared on the recipient's pillow during source for reconstructing Hume's entanglement of Theosophy with Indian nation alism. For the same points, see also Seal, Emergence, p. 251; McLane, Indian Nationalism, p. 46; Martin, New India, p. 65; and B. C. Pal, Memories of My Life and Times, 2d ed. (Calcutta, 1973), vol. 2. 28 See, for example, Suntharalingham, Indian Nationalism; Masselos, Indian Nationalism; Majumdar, History; and Tara Chand, History. Both Martin, New India, and Mehrotra, Emergence, implicitly make the Theosophical connection.</page><page sequence="25">Hanes: Origins of the Indian National Congress 93 the night), "precipitated," according to Blavatsky, from thin air. With Blavatsky thus acting as intermediary, several Theosophists, of whom Hume and A. P. Sinnett were the most prominent, had sent letters to the Mahatmas and in return received "precipi tated" responses?all of which praised the Theosophical Society founders and discouraged any questioning of their abilities or motives. After a year of this indirect communication, however, in 1881 Hume did indeed begin to doubt Blavatsky's sincerity and tried to develop his own direct channels to the Mahatmas. By 1882, his appeals to the Masters to develop his personal occult abilities (presumably so that he might bypass Blavatsky) had resulted in violent outbursts by the temperamental Russian.29 As others also began to question the honesty, if not the occult abilities, of the Theosophical leader, a major controversy soon developed that threatened to discredit the whole Society. Eventu ally, on the testimony of an estranged maid and her husband, Blavatsksy was accused of fraud by Christian missionaries in what became known as the scandal of the Mahatma letters. In the meantime, Hume himself gave up his official status in the Simla branch of the Society in 1883 as the entire membership began to divide over the question of supporting or opposing Madame Blavatsky. Most supported the founder, and only a few, like Hume, distanced themselves from her administration. The internal divi sion was not made public, however, so a formal split was avoided. Indeed, despite the controversy, the overall unity of the Society remained intact, and the annual conferences continued without interruption. Hume himself apparently never questioned the 29 See especially Martin, New India, pp. 64-65, 67-69. In a letter to Ripon of 11 January 1884, Hume explained the problem in esoteric terms: "Col. O. and Madame B. are not quite honest; they have been . .. aided by our people [i.e., the Mahat mas], and they began work unquestionably in the purest spirit of self-devotion to the cause of India, but.. . have drifted away into a maze of falsehoods .. . exagger ations and deceptions, and have been gradually left almost wholly to their own devices." As a result of their "mingling falsehood with truth," Hume believed, Blavatsky and Olcott were no longer in touch with the Brotherhood itself, but with "a lower association of kindred origin"?the implication being that only those who remained "rigidly pure" in motivation could remain "in tune" with the highest Masters. Hume himself of course continued to claim association "with men who, tho' never seen by the masses ... are yet reverenced by them as Gods." "Peace, order, brotherly love, freedom and progress are the keynotes of our people." He even went so far as to claim that the Brotherhood had somehow intervened behind the scenes (spiritually, one assumes) to mitigate the violence of the 1848 revolutions in Europe and the 1857 Mutiny in India. Since the Mutiny, they had been working in India to prevent such a calamity from recurring?most recently through Ripon's own reform policies.</page><page sequence="26">94 JOURNAL OF WORLD HISTORY, SPRING 1993 reality of the Masters as a result of his disillusionment with Blavatsky, and he continued to believe that his political efforts were under their guidance. Eventually, Blavatsky gave up her con trol of the Society's external affairs and left India, never to return. Even so, the political ramifications of the scandal were significant.30 In his plans for the political organization of the Indian intelli gentsia, Hume had counted heavily on the support of two fellow Theosophists, B. M. Malabari in Bombay and Nurendranath Sen in Calcutta, both of whom were opinion leaders of western-edu cated Indians. Unfortunately for Hume, however, his split with Blavatsky seemed to have alienated him from Sen. Like most of the Bengali Theosophists, Sen and his friends in Calcutta contin ued to support Blavatsky despite increasing evidence of fraudu lent misrepresentation of her supposedly mystical powers. "I can not now trust him," Hume wrote about Sen to Ripon in January 1884, "as entirely as B.M.M[alabari]. He is entirely in the hands of Colonel Olcott and Madame Blavatsky . . . his mind is not his own, and he is, I fear, prejudiced against me ... he is one of the very men mentioned to me as likely to give us trouble in a quiet way (he will never be extreme)." Later, Hume increasingly leaned toward Malabari and his Bombay associates and away from Sen and his Calcutta connections. Since Sen had close relations with Suren dranath Banerjea, head of the Indian Association of Calcutta and the primary organizer of the Indian National Conference, this internal Theosophical dispute probably explains why Hume did not initially coordinate his activities with the leading Indian polit ical organization in Calcutta.31 Despite these internal Theosophical differences, Hume made a concerted effort throughout 1885 to smooth the waters with his former colleagues in the Society. In the early spring he went to Madras, where he discussed his plans with Raghunath Rao and Rao's associates in the Madras Mahajana Sabha. He may even have visited Adyar: at least he seems to have tried to mitigate the 30 For the scandal, see Campbell, A History, pp. 58-59, 80-81. There is a consid erable Theosophical literature on the subject. An interesting account of Hume's disillusionment and Blavatsky's reaction, based on the Mahatma letters and other correspondence, is Virginia Hansen's Masters and Men: The Human Story in the Mahatma Letters (Adyar, 1980). See also The Mahatma Letters to A. P. Sinnett (Lon don, 1923). The Mahatma letters themselves, with ancillary correspondence, are in the Mahatma Papers collection of the British Museum, London. 31 Martin, New India, pp. 67-68, quoting Hume to Ripon, 11 January 1884.</page><page sequence="27">Hanes: Origins of the Indian National Congress 95 effects of the Mahatma letters scandal, suggesting to Rao and other leading Theosophists a plan (later rejected) for reorganizing the Society in order to restore its credibility. He then sailed for Calcutta, where there is evidence that he tried unsuccessfully to interest the Bengali nationalists in his plans for an all-India politi cal conference. Banerjea remained aloof, however, and the two conferences proceeded separately. Nevertheless, Hume's efforts were not entirely wasted, for Sen himself decided that Banerjea's plans were too narrowly provincial, and he came out instead in support of Hume's proposed meeting. Although the Poona ar rangements had to be changed at the last minute due to an out break of cholera, Hume's Indian National Union finally convened in Bombay in December 1885, immediately renaming itself the Indian National Congress (perhaps in deference to Sen's prefer ence of terminology). In 1886 the Congress convened in Calcutta, where it absorbed Banerjea's National Conference. Thus, largely through the medium of the Theosophical Society, the Indian National Congress became the all-India political expression of the western-educated Indian elite.32 Conclusion The Theosophical Society had clearly provided what neither the Brahmo Samaj nor the Arya Samaj could?a cultural "neutral zone" in which reformist Hindu, syncretic Brahmo, and liberal Anglo-Indian could meet and agree on certain cultural principles without the divisiveness of dogma. It appealed to both Indians and Britons for a variety of reasons. Though its doctrine avowedly and demonstrably favored Eastern religions and philosophies, particularly Vedantic Hinduism and Buddhism, the Society re fused to be drawn into sectarian disputes. It emphasized the need to reconcile the great spiritual truths, especially those of the Vedas, with modern Western science. With its facilitation of inter Indian communications and a rhetoric constantly propounding ideals of "freedom and progress" as well as the "sacred nature" of India as the "cradle of civilization," the organizational structure fostered a sense of unity, both of form and purpose, among Theosophists throughout the subcontinent. This organizational unity reached fruition in the yearly national meetings instituted 32 This paragraph is drawn primarily from Mehrotra, Emergence, p. 34.</page><page sequence="28">96 JOURNAL OF WORLD HISTORY, SPRING I993 in 1881, and was stable enough to withstand even the pressures of the Blavatsky scandal. Above all, the Theosophical Society provided the psychological confidence necessary for the western-educated elite to organize politically on an all-India scale. As one leading Indian nationalist, B. C. Pal, observed in his memoirs: The Theosophical Society . . . was perhaps the most powerful of the forces that brought in this movement of Hindu religious revival and social reaction. This Society told our people that instead of having any reason to be ashamed of their past or of the legacies left to them by it, they had every reason to feel justly proud . . . because their ancient seers and saints had been the spokesmen of the highest truths and their old books, so woefully misunderstood today, had been the repositories of the highest human illumination and wisdom. Our people had hitherto felt per petually humiliated at the sense of their degradation. This new message, coming from the representatives of the most advanced peoples of the modern world, the inheritors of the most advanced culture and civilization the world has yet known, at once raised us in our own estimation and created a self-confidence in us. Cultural interaction was a double-edged blade, however: the mes sage affected not only western-educated Indians, but also Anglo Indians like Hume. Having spent his career maintaining an open and even sympathetic mind toward Indian culture, Hume was fully prepared to believe that the Theosophical Society had been expressly created by the spiritual guides of humanity, the Mahat mas of the Himalayas, to forward the political aspirations of India. And so he set in motion plans that led to the creation of the Indian National Congress.33 Thus, the Theosophical Society became the seedbed for mod ern Indian political development. The connection lasted for some time. In 1917, for example, the president of the Theosophical Soci ety, Annie Besant, an outspoken advocate of Indian nationalism as well as women's rights, was also elected president of the Indian National Congress; she later founded the Indian Home Rule League. As late as the 1920s, most leading advocates of political reform in India were also Theosophists.34 Even with its cross-cul 33 See B. C. Pal, Memories, p. 344. 34 For Annie Besant, see A. H.

It remained pri marily an expression of the western-educated Indian intelligent sia, and consequently continued to reflect the cultural and psy chological anomalies inherent in the mixed loyalties and identities of its founders. In the end, of course, the Congress did provide a political movement that would eventually mobilize the masses of India to achieve independence. Yet given the unequal nature of the impe rial relationship between Britain and its Indian empire, it was perhaps inevitable that a movement largely organized by a Euro pean, through the medium of an originally Western cultural soci ety, must first transform itself into a more thoroughly Indian phe nomenon before it could become a fit vehicle for the political expression of a cultural reconciliation between Indians and Brit ons, between East and West, between India's history and its future. Such integration was most fully achieved in the person of yet another Mahatma, Mohandas K. Gandhi?himself an English trained lawyer who only rediscovered his Indian heritage in mid dle age. Fittingly, perhaps, it was largely through the medium of the Theosophical Society that the future spiritual and "national" leader of India came back to his roots and achieved the critical reconciliation of his training with his birth. "Even as a student in London," writes one of Gandhi's biographers, "he read carefully . . . The Key to Theosophy?which he counted among the few cru cial influences in his life." In 1947, Gandhi reportedly told Louis Fischer, "In the beginning, the leading Congressmen were Theoso phists. Mrs. Annie Besant attracted me very much. Theosophy is the teaching of Madame Blavatsky. It is Hinduism at its best. Theosophy is the brotherhood of man." Nor was Gandhi alone in his interest: Jawaharlal Nehru was tutored by a Theosophist on the instructions of his father, and while still a young man he was actually initiated into the movement by Annie Besant herself.35 By Gandhi's and Nehru's time, however, the Theosophical Society was no longer crucial to the Indian nationalist movement: once organized, the impetus toward freedom and independence took on a life of its own. Nor, indeed, despite the bright light this article has tried to throw on the Society's early role, should its 35 See Raghavan Iyer, The Moral and Political Thought of Mahatma Gandhi, 2d ed.

It was preeminently a cata lyst, a bridging mechanism that appeared at a unique moment in the history of Indo-British relations. Having fulfilled its purpose in the larger scheme of things, it gradually moved off center stage, or more accurately, it was left behind as Indian nationalism gained enough experience and self-confidence in its own right to challenge the raj on its own terms. Indeed, in these latter days the European origins of the movement, and its early European spon sors, have seemed something of an embarrassment to many Indian nationalists (and their historians) anxious to emphasize the overwhelming importance of the indigenous peoples them selves in their struggle against colonial rule. The fact remains, however, that modern nationalism in India, as elsewhere, was itself initially a principally European concept transplanted to the subcontinent through Western education; and without understanding the mechanisms by which such European concepts were translated into indigenous expression, the recent history of the non-European world would be difficult if not impos sible to understand. Most important, perhaps, the story of the ori gins of the Indian National Congress suggests that the ultimate resolution of the confrontation brought on by "modernizing" Europe's expansion into a still primarily "traditionalist" world? a confrontation of economics, politics, military force, and per haps above all of ideas and utterly different world views?will not be achieved in an either/or fashion, but rather through a process of creative synthesis that gives hope for the future of interper sonal, as well as international, relations. Whether such mecha nisms can indeed be found in other cases must be the subject of ongoing research into the emergence of what appears to be a new global civilization.</page></plain_text>
