<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Challenging the anthropomorphiC  master narrative in The elemenTary  Forms and Forging a more material- ist durkheimianism Frank pearCe Abstract: An implicit goal of The Elementary Forms of Religious Life is to show  that a viable and effective morality can be developed for modern differentiated  societies. Durkheim believed that for this morality to be experienced as obliga- tory, humankind needed to believe that its source was a living moral being with  recognisably similar, albeit, more perfect, attributes to themselves. Durkheim  was confident that in reality only society and, as metaphors for society, the  monotheistic representations of God, fitted this criterion. Thus he was disposed  to select from a range of representations of society sui generis anthropomorphic  ones, thereby marginalising much of his previous work. This article draws on  critical realists and Antonio Gramsci to critique Durkheim’s notion of society  in this text and more broadly to interrogate his use of collective subjects such  as the collective conscience. His conceptual system is shown to be incoherent  and somewhat tautological. But this clears the way for a new theorization in- volving an articulation of certain of Durkheim’s valid concepts with a rather  structuralist version of Gramsci’s concept of hegemony. The intention here is  to provide a fresh interpretation of Durkheim and develop a more materialist  Durkheimianism.

Mots clés: Néo-Gramscien Durkheimianism, société sui generis, hégémonie,  réalismes critiques introduCtion  This article provides a new reading of Durkheim’s corpus through a critical, yet appreciative engagement with The Elementary Forms of  Religious Life (hereafter EFRL). The first part provides a critical ex- planation and interpretation of Émile Durkheim’s EFRL, but then refers  back to some of his earlier writings to show that they are replete with  interesting insights which were subsequently marginalised. The second  part develops a new interpretation of sui generis social beings. It draws  first on some critical realist reflections upon “Strong Emergentism” and  “Relational Emergentism.” Later, armed with insights gleaned from  Antonio Gramsci’s concept of “Hegemony”, a critical interrogation of  the concept of the Collective Conscience (hereafter the CC) renders it  free of anthropomorphism. The result is a more nuanced sense of the  components of social order that enables us to more adequately grasp the  complexity of modern societies.  The EFRL is an innovative, provocative, iconoclastic, and wide- ranging text. It has generated numerous interpretations, most of which  indicate their appreciation for Durkheim’s scholarship, imagination and  boldness in taking on the subject of religion. Those who attend to his  argument it its entirety generally acknowledge the text’s power and ele- gance, while also identifying key weaknesses that undermine its overall  coherence (Pickering 1984). It is thus not surprising that Durkheim’s text  fares best when it is used selectively; this is never easy, however, if one  wishes to avoid syncretism. Georges Bataille, Roger Caillois and Michel  Leiris, French social theorists associated with the Collège de sociologie  that met in Paris in the 1930s (Pearce 2003; 2003a) offer examples of  this.  </page> <page sequence="3"> Challenging the anthropomorphiC maSter narrative        621 From his earliest writings, Durkheim struggled to find ways to grasp,  analyze, and represent the kind of entity or being that is “society.” He  believed that political theorists and political economists had failed to ad- equately grasp its nature. Their voluntaristic and individualistic epistem- ologies blocked their ability to understand that “(a) whole is not identical  to the sum of its parts, even though, without them, it would be nothing.  In the same way by coming together in a definite structure and through  lasting bonds, men form a new entity, which has its own nature and its  own laws. This is the social entity” (Durkheim 1978 [1888]: 51). the elementary formS of religiouS life: a Brief aCCount In the EFRL Durkheim argues that all societies require and benefit from  religion.  [T]here is something eternal in religion that is destined to outlive the suc- cession of particular symbols in which religious thought has clothed itself.  ...[M]oral remaking can only be achieved through meetings, assemblies,  and congregations in whom the individuals, pressing close to one another,  reaffirm in common their common sentiments (EFRL:  429). Intrinsically oriented to the collectivity, religious phenomena are com- prised of beliefs (states of opinion consisting of representations) and  rites (particular modes of action). These presuppose that real or ideal  things can be classified as members of either one or the other of two  mutually and absolutely exclusive genera: the sacred and the profane  (EFRL:  34). The exclusion is not merely linguistic but “sacred things are  things protected and isolated by prohibitions; profane things are those  things to which the prohibitions apply” (EFRL:  38) . While the distinc- tion between the sacred and the profane is universal, the same is not true  of its content. In each society particular collective representations indi- cate what is sacred and what is profane. Sacredness does not derive from  qualities of the object itself, since any particular object may be categor- ized in one society as sacred and in another as profane. Qualities are seen  as admirable because a particular society already has qualities that it has  deemed valuable and then ascribes to objects it holds to be “sacred.” Such  sacred things create feelings of awe and elicit acts of deference. Given  that generally speaking, sacred objects are scarcer than profane ones it is  likely that a normal pre-condition for the sacred is scarcity of some kind.  The selection of sacred flora or fauna may have aleatory dimensions and  may well be associated with relatively dangerous situations. Once sac- ralised he, she or it may themselves gain sacralising power. These pow- </page> <page sequence="4"> 622 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(3) 2014 ers may well be amplified if a sacred zone is visited. These zones tend  to be associated with deities but as Durkheim argues (EFRL:  27–28),  such deities are not necessary aspects of religion. Finally, these religious  beliefs and practices are institutionalized in the form of “churches.” This  leads to Durkheim’s definition of religion as a “unified system of beliefs  and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and  forbidden — beliefs and practices — which unite into one single moral  community called a Church, all those who adhere to them (EFRL:  44).  Acts of worship by members of a given moral community strengthen  “the ties between the faithful and their god ... the god being only a fig- urative representation of society” and “strengthen the ties between the  individual and the society” (EFRL:  227).  For Durkheim, religion is essential to social life, constituting a  necessarily positive institution that creates a cosmology shared by all  members. It is through this cosmology that members orient themselves  towards the interests of their collectivity, and it is the cosmology that  they then (re)affirm by participating in communal rituals. Religion, then,  contributes to both the reproduction and development of societies. Sacrifice is essential to the religious life. We are called upon to will- ingly surrender some of our autonomy, some of our time, some of our  resources and capacities to the community, with no guarantee of what  we may receive in return. Ritual sacrifice is of particular importance be- cause it creates a time and place in which movement can occur between  the profane and the sacred, and the sacred and the profane (EFRL: 343).  But it is humanity’s desires that motivate sacrifice; thus, in a twist of  symbiosis, the divinities are revealed to be dependent on humanity for  their continued existence and ability to play their part in the cosmic or- der (Hubert and Mauss 1964 [1898]). Human beings, then, play at least  as significant a role as the gods in the imagined workings of the sacri- ficial mechanism, possibly effecting interconnections between a series  of social and, indeed, spiritual and cosmic levels (Herrenschmidt 1982;  Pearce 2010). One logical conclusion not mentioned by Durkheim is that  sacrifice is integral to the life of all voluntarily joined groups and many  others, including society as a whole; yet, sacrifice-per-se does not de- pend on religion for its existence.  ContinuitieS and diSContinuitieS in durkheim’S other WritingS on  religion  In many ways the EFRL is a powerful culmination of Durkheim’s ex- ploration of religion and hence there is a great deal of continuity with  </page> <page sequence="5"> Challenging the anthropomorphiC maSter narrative        623 his other writings on the topic. For example, from his earliest writings  through to the EFRL he argued that deities do not need to play an im- portant role or, indeed any role in any society’s mythology (Durkheim  1975a [1886a]: 20–22; Durkheim 1988 [1893]: 119; Durkheim 1973c  [1898] Durkheim 1995 [1912]: 27–33). Nevertheless, in his 1887 appre- ciative review of Jean-Marie Guyau’s book L’Irréreligion de l’avenir:  une étude sociologique Durkheim explored how different social relations  could produce quite different imaginings of the nature of the gods. “Ear- ly societies would have been usually egalitarian and the gods in these  societies were generally benevolent “beings more powerful than man but  ... similar to him and live in society with him” (Durkheim 1975 [1887a]:  25). There would be many gods. Such societies would tend to co-exist  peacefully but this could change, often for ecological reasons, or because  aggressive tribes came from elsewhere and threatened those who already  had settled. This threat would trigger an experience of insecurity and  an increased sense of tribal solidarity. It also would tend to strengthen  alliances with other nearby tribes. Inter-tribal relations and particularly  alliances would often become more formalised. Each tribe would se- lect or create a tribal god. The pantheon and the myths would become  more encompassing and more structured. The gods would now be seen  as powerful and distant. They would communicate with each other rather  than with humanity. An individual would now be only a part of a whole  whose movements he/she would follow and whose pressures he/she  would accept. Religious society is not human society ideally projected  beyond the stars; and a god is not conceived of as a member of a tribe.  They form one or rather several societies, some friendly, others hostile,  and people have maintained relationships with them of an international  character (Durkheim 1975 [1887a]: 36–37). Social order would now be- come organised in and through the near-sovereignties of still stateless  peoples and their religions and their deities would have been shaped in  accord with this. The duress of war and its continual threat would have  pushed societies to take on the attributes of mechanical solidarity. I am  suggesting here that an approximation to sovereignty can precede the  state proper, and that under those conditions treaties — somewhat like  the Treaty of Westphalia although much less sophisticated — would not  be uncommon.  There remains the question: what, if any, social functions are unique- ly fulfilled for society by religion? This is a sociological question in  that it concerns not only “all individuals taken in isolation, but soci- ety itself, that is to say the collective being [être collectif]”(Durkheim  1975a [1886a]: 18). Religion is very similar to morality and law; all  three are forms of custom that deploy a “collection of commandments,  </page> <page sequence="6"> 624 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(3) 2014 of imperatives, sustained by material sanctions.” Since the “object of  law and morality” is “to maintain the equilibrium of society and to adapt  it to environmental conditions” (Durkheim 1975a [1886a]: 20) we can  hypothesise that religion, too, regulates society. However, it achieves  this in a way that is distinct from the techniques of morality and law:  religion is a collective discipline that imposes itself on both conduct and  conscience and is premised upon “faith” (Durkheim 1975 [1886a]: 21).  Durkheim sustained the view that faith and discipline were integral ele- ments of religion (Durkheim 1961 [1925]).  In the absence of a clear and rigorous account of how the entity called  “society” was organised, Durkheim often turned to metaphors. A more  rigorous conceptualisation of the specific nature of society, with greater  fidelity to its object, was still needed. As his work progressed, Durkheim  increasingly drew on metaphors to better capture the dynamism of his  object, society. This choice (or slippage) had negative consequences for  his work. At times he seems to forget that the analogies he draws be- tween different objects, parallel physical functions, bodies and societies  are not identities but metaphors which play with systems of similarities  and differences. In fact, his reliance upon metaphors leads him towards  anthropomorphism; he anthropomorphises society itself, the CC, reli- gion, groups, groups in a state of collective effervescence and he does so  particularly in the EFRL (cf. EFRL: 426, and see 22, 44, 210, 415, 420,  429). One important reason for this anthropomorphism was his under- standing of the nature of morality and how it worked on a societal level.  He postulated: first, that “we have no duties except in relation to thinking  minds...to moral persons or thinking beings” (Durkheim 1953 [1924]:  49); second, the source of morality must also be a thinking being, “an  authority whose superiority they acknowledge and which tells what is  right” (Durkheim 1962 [1928]: 242); third, “but the only thinking being  greater than man is society” (Durkheim 1975 [1899]: 93). The anthropo- morphising of society has a signal importance for his theory of morality  and this minimally reinforces the similar tendencies in his more general  sociological theory (Lukes 1985: 414–416; Dubeski 2001: 3655).  Sui GeneriS entitieS, CritiCal realiSm and emergenCe Although it is important to problematize Durkheim’s anthropomorph- ist tendencies (Milbrandt and Pearce 2011: 255–256), an underappreci- ated aspect of his work as a whole is the richness of the meanings of  his phrase “society sui generis.” He is very aware of the complexity of  the societies of his day. This is clear from his early work “La science  </page> <page sequence="7"> Challenging the anthropomorphiC maSter narrative        625 positive de morale en Allemagne”, where he identifies much of what a  complex society needs and specifies some observable relations linking  functional institutions to each other and to society as a whole: (F)rom the fact that these parts have definite relationships with and are  assembled in a certain way, there results something new: assuredly a com- posite entity... Society is not, therefore reducible to a blurred mass of cit- izens. Since the social being has needs, which are its own, some of which  are material it institutes and organises for their satisfaction an economic  activity, which is not that of one individual or another or of the majority of  citizens, but of the nation in its entirety (Durkheim 1993 [1887]: 64; and  see Durkheim 1978 [1888a: 50). Sui generis entities appear throughout Durkheim’s work and are usually  understood as being unified collective subjects, among other things, the  CC, Religion, Society, political assemblies, and God. The only collect- ive entities discussed by Durkheim which are truly self-reflexive are the  state based democratic assemblies with representation from the different  interest groups within the society (Durkheim 1957 [1950]: 76–109). A key part of Durkheim’s theoretical concern is to explain the means  by which sui generis entities are (re) produced. He was sympathetic to  aspects of Schaeffle’s use of biological metaphors, e.g. that there is a  similarity between how in the histology of the human body one’s focus  “passes from the tissues to the organs” and how in the case of society  “every organ is formed by the combination of five functional tissues”  (Durkheim 1978a [1885]: 108). An example of a functioning and func- tional organ was the medieval corporation. One place where Durkheim  has a discussion of social reproduction in which he develops the bio- logical analogy fruitfully is in The Rules of Sociological Method. The  conceptual system developed there is notable for its clarity and relative  coherence. For example, in the case of the “normal and pathological,”  the deployment of the analogy shows that societies compared must be  of the same species, at similar phases of development (Durkheim 1982  [1895]: 97). One can add that for a society to continue from generation  to generation, it needs institutions that are functional for its reproduc- tion and adaptation. The existence of the CC helps constitute resilient,  conscionable and flexible social members, but these also require a con- tinuous supply of reasonably strong social currents in balanced relation- ships with each other. But in their absence: “Unregulated emotions are  adjusted neither to one another nor to the conditions they are supposed  to meet; they must therefore conflict with each other most painfully”  (Durkheim 1951 [1896]: 285). Under such anomic conditions, where  there is no overarching order and there is a diminution of sociability,  </page> <page sequence="8"> 626 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(3) 2014 many become open to the influence of anti-communal discourses promo- ting anti-social conduct (e.g. favouring the option of suicide) that they  would otherwise not entertain (cf. Pearce 2001: 135–142).  emergenCe and CritiCal realiSm Critical Realism (CR) offers a partial solution to some of the quandar- ies found in Durkheim’s account of emergent properties. In The Causal  Power of Social Structures (2010), Dave Elder-Vass provides a use- ful and general definition of the process of emergence. The universe is  populated with many different entities, each with particular values of  common properties (mass, volume, colour) and each with its own dis- tinctive properties. All parts are positioned in relation to each other and  in relation to the whole, which may develop new properties. Later, in dis- cussing emergentist ontology, Elder-Vass adds that “[T]o explain these  entities, relations and properties, we need to identify the mechanisms by  which the parts and relations produce the properties, the morphogenetic  causes that bring this set of parts into this set of relations in the first place  and the morphostatic causes that keep them so” (Elder-Vass 2010: 68).  Elder-Vass distinguishes between what he calls “strong emergen- tism” and “relational emergentism.” The first is the phenomenon that  certain proponents of emergentism claim to have discovered and what  many of its opponents find an easy target. According to strong emergen- tism, “A property of a whole is emergent if it cannot be explained from  the properties of lower-level parts and their substantial relations with  each other” (Elder-Vass 2010: 29–30: emphasis added). The second, re- lational emergentism, argues that:  [E]ntities may possess emergent properties, which are produced by mech- anisms that in turn depend on the properties of the entity’s parts and how  these parts are organised. ...Those parts would not be related in that way  if they were not organised into an entity of the relevant kind, the collect- ive power that they have when organised into such an entity is a power  of the higher-level entity and not of the parts. (Elder-Vass 2010: 192–193  emphasis added). Durkheim’s practice was to identify and enumerate different ele- ments of an entity, their relations to each other and to the latter as a total- ity. He also listed emergent properties, taking care to link their appear- ance with the concurrent presence of specific elements of the latter. For  true emergence, the mere presence of different elements is not enough:  “Since there are in society only individuals, it is they and they alone who  </page> <page sequence="9"> Challenging the anthropomorphiC maSter narrative        627 are factors in social life”, and, further that “[t]he whole can only change  if the parts change, and to the same extent” (Durkheim 1885a: 632, 633  cited in Lukes 1985: 93). In short, Durkheim’s early works can be under- stood as having already worked through many aspects of “compositional  emergence” (Elder Vass 2010: 18–20; see Hardy 2011 who uses Elder  Vass to strengthen a Foucaultian materialism). Durkheim shows that “so- ciety” is a composite being of heterogeneous elements, each with various  powers and attributes; its combination is in definite and proportionate  relationships. It exists in relation to a whole and the ultimate result is the  emergence of a new “object” or “being” with different properties than its  component parts. In The Division of Labour in Society, Durkheim conceptualises a  modern society of some complexity, works out much of what it needs as  inputs, identifies some of the ways these needs have been met, specifies  some observable relations linking together functional institutions to each  other and to society as a whole. Durkheim is referring to societies which  had a long history of increasing complexity:  In the capital are concentrated today... the active force of the central gov- ernment, the arts, literature and large-scale credit operations. ... Whereas  each town once had its ramparts and moat, now a few great fortresses  are entrusted with the task of protecting the whole country.... The dif- ferent towns tend to develop certain specialisations... and certain areas  concentrated, so that today we distinguish between university towns, civil  service towns, factory towns... At certain spots or in certain areas are  concentrated the large scale industries...all working for the whole country  (Schmoller cited in Durkheim 1984 [1893]: 137–138).  Emergence, in both “relational” and “strong” forms, is clearly an  important implicit concept in Durkheim’s writings. Emergence is an im- portant dimension of many sui generis entities. Durkheim theorized the  properties of sui generis entities in two ways. In the early Durkheim,  emergent properties were constituted by the arrangement of an emerging  entity’s elements. In his later writings, especially in EFRL, Durkheim  had a less theoretically sophisticated account of emergence; he implied  that properties were not so much emergent as pre-existing in an entity’s  constituent parts. For example, people occupying and exercising pos- itions of authority (such as clan leaders) were assumed to derive their  potency and charisma from their social position alone. However, by en- gaging with the early Durkheim’s more nuanced and sophisticated analy- sis, as well as by incorporating elements of CR, an intriguing variation  on Durkheim’s master discourse is opened up: the relation of emergent  entities to underlying social forces. </page> <page sequence="10"> 628 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(3) 2014 rethinking SoCiety and groupS Durkheim sometimes saw society as a large group which encompassed  other smaller groups and institutions, and social relations including those  identified by morphological analyses. He was interested in the relation  between society and itself, partially realised through its CC and through  democratic institutions (Durkheim 1957 [1950]); society and the indi- vidual; society and groups, institutions or social relations; individuals  and other individuals; groups, institution and social relations with each  other. This basic model is compatible with a wide range of theoretical  positions.  In EFRL, however, Durkheim is very selective about the relation- ships he attends to. As we have seen he was strongly committed to the  view that a viable society must be unified in and through its CC, particu- larly in its manifestation as religion. This is at the heart of the society  and is the determinate force within it. Religion, through the religious CC,  determines the content of society’s collective representations involving  cosmology, morals and ethics; it determines how the intermediary insti- tutions function and how they translate these representations. This cre- ates a neat functional system. A member of society gets basically the  same message from a number of different sources. As suggested earlier, Durkheim’s use of metaphorical language, in- cluding its anthropomorphic variant, can be understood as an attempt to  capture aspects of phenomena which are not captured by more available  scientific discourses. The challenge is to develop concepts adequate to  these phenomena, a case in point is provided by the statement below.  When society is going through events that sadden, distress or anger it,  it pushes its members to give witness to their sadness, distress or anger  through expressive actions. It demands crying, lamenting, and wounding  oneself and others as a matter of duty. It does so because those collect- ive demonstrations, as well as the moral communion they simultaneously  bear witness to and reinforce, restore to the group the energy that the  events threatened to take away, and thus enables it to recover its equilib- rium (EFRL: 415–416). While retaining its general sense I am going to slightly modify this state- ment by paraphrasing it to now read: The distress that the members of a  society sometimes suffer may be a particularly intense manifestation of  a general malaise that is for some reason affecting their society. Some  of the members may react particularly strongly in a somewhat ritualised  manner thereby having a shared experience including catharsis leading  </page> <page sequence="11"> Challenging the anthropomorphiC maSter narrative        629 them to constitute themselves as a subgroup, strengthening their bonds  with each other and with the society as a whole. It is important to bear in mind that “when one undertakes to explain  a social phenomenon the efficient cause which produces it and the func- tion it fulfils must be investigated separately” (Durkheim 1982 [1895]:  123). This warns us to note that while the suffering that would be felt by  such a new group would strengthen the group’s bonds, this would not  have been the only way that groups in that society could react. Some  might have responded with anger, targeting those they suspect are luke- warm in their devotion. This would both create some solidarity and some  serious exclusion.  There is a great deal of research on small groups relevant to the  above. One type of group which has been researched quite thoroughly  is ordered according to a kind of passive autocracy and a passive dem- ocracy: it consists of a consultant (who must be present all the time that  the group is in session) and about 10 to 15 volunteers (who usually have  somewhat more flexibility about attendance). Such a group, which is  studying itself (among other things), will typically last for the time al- lotted it (usually enough for ten or more meetings) and with relatively  high attendance by members. These groups display emergent proper- ties which include anomie, followed by an increasingly unenthusiastic  participation by group members, i.e. a passive “flight” from the group,  followed, in turn, by generalised aggression, particularly against the “in- adequate” group consultant; and then, finally, two people emerge who  are expected to be the source of a rebirth of the group. Often this ex- pectation is rewarded with a new ethos in the group and some innovative  work (Bion 2013). Evidently a particular group’s response to the events  external to its focus, and the demands placed on it, would be mediated  by the stage in the group’s development. The important point here is  that the specific emergent powers give group members possibilities to  either act in accord with expectations or to act differently. Social control  mechanisms often function to limit the options of the emergent entity; or,  alternatively, the emergent entity may subvert the original form of social  ordering in the group. Similar work has been undertaken to study larger  groups of approximately forty to eighty people, monitored by two rather  pro-active consultants; the main task facing a member of the group is  to become integrated while preserving significant autonomy, avoiding  the dangers of either being subsumed from or estranged by the group  (Turquet 1975). These processes and their attendant dilemnas also occur  on a societal level.  In fact, sadness, distress, anger etc. are at least partially produced by  underlying structural relations affecting us in many different settings.  </page> <page sequence="12"> 630 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(3) 2014 We might note the extraordinarily collective nature of the grief, mourn- ing and anger of so many British people at the death of Princess Diana  and in particular how the “People”s Princess” became the icon of “true  royalty” putting to shame the Queen”s formalism and Prince Charles’s  abuse of his masculine privileges. But Diana was never to return, she no  longer had an active role in the royal melodrama. An obsequious Prime  Minister helped a “contrite” Queen refurbish herself and the nation re- gained a “Dignified Leader.” Will Princess Kate take up the challenge?  The republican flame which had been growing in strength before Diana’s  death was blown out again but no one knows for how long. Nevertheless,  it would seem unlikely that a relation between British subjects and their  Kings or Queens will ever again be represented so positively as in “The  Meaning of the Coronation” (Shils and Young 1955). a neo-durkheimian reinterpretation of groupS Using a neo-Durkheimian framework it is possible to develop an an- alysis of groups that shows them to be sui generis entities with (some)  powers that are constituted by the internal relations of their constituent  parts; furthermore, in many instances they may be (at least partially) the  result of underlying social pressures or tensions. Moving on, the next  task is to reconceptualise the CC collective and the new social totality  and establish their level of compatibility and potential for integration. Durkheim generally works with a consensual model of society but  there is also a somewhat different understanding of groups and members  to be found in the DOL: “we form a part of several groups and there exist  for us several collective consciousnesses,” and moreover, we all have  private experiences meaning that we also have an individual or personal  consciousness (Durkheim 1988 [1893]: 61, 67). Bearing this in mind,  the CC should not be regarded as merely a cumulative compendium of  obligations and prohibitions, of examples of compliance and infractions,  nor of short term accommodations and long term contradictions; nor as a  mere chronicle of a single collectivity’s dreams and nightmares, victor- ies and defeats, successes and failures. Rather, it should be recognised  as a resource for a number of different ever-changing sub-collectivities  with whom there will be some agreement as to significant events, but  marked differences as to how these are thought about. It provides both  factual and idealised accounts of the society’s past and present and po- tential futures which can be made into a number of different narratives. It is true that Durkheim was more willing to focus on the disorder  that precedes group conflict rather than on the content of conflict itself,  </page> <page sequence="13"> Challenging the anthropomorphiC maSter narrative        631 but he saw them as in some sense connected: “Socialism ... is a cry  of grief, sometimes of anger, uttered by men who feel most keenly our  collective malaise” (Durkheim 1962 [1893/1928]: 41–42). The CC can  reveal aspects of the social world which for some justify ever more con- formity to the extant social order but which for others call for more rad- ical changes. Thus, the CC is not automatically a source of consensus but  it is also a site of potential interpretive dissonance not merely indicating  that there are rival interpretations, but helping to produce struggles be- tween groups as to which narrative will become the leading one. Remembering that the CC is often connected with other social facts,  it is no surprise that it may be construed as coercive. When Durkheim  wrote that he “never regarded constraint as anything more than the  visible, tangible expression of an underlying, inner fact that is wholly  ideal: moral authority” (EFRL: 210), he was not necessarily denying a  role for coercion in subtending a sociocultural order but merely claiming  that for it to be legitimate it must be based on moral grounds (see also  Datta 2010: 176–177). Society then can usefully be thought of as a collection of groups,  institutions and social relations rather than an expressive totality. This  reconceptualization facilitates the possibility of identifying and develop- ing radical aspects of Durkheim’s thought, for example that the concept  of the forced division of labour provides a resource to rethink the cat- egories he deploys in Suicide: A Sociological Study and to suggest that  “fatalistic suicide”, contra Durkheim, is very common in our societies  (Pearce 2001). durkheim and gramSCi In a review of Antonio Labriola’s “Historical Materialism”, Durkheim  criticised Labriola in particular, and Marxism, in general, for its eco- nomic and technological determinism and its tendency to treat other  phenomena as ultimately being shaped to facilitate the functioning of its  modes of economic production.  Not only is the Marxist premise unproven but it is also contrary to facts,  which appear established. Sociologists and historians have increasingly  come together in their common affirmation that religion is the most primi- tive of all phenomena. It is from religion that has emerged, through suc- cessive transformations, all the other manifestations of collective activity  — law, morality, art, science, political forms etc. In principle everything  is religious (Durkheim 1982a [1897]: 173). </page> <page sequence="14"> 632 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(3) 2014 Somewhat ironically, the alternative Durkheim suggests exchanges a  religious essentialism for economic essentialism. Although important to  note, the issues raised in this are not my current focus.  Antonio Gramsci also challenged much Marxist theory and on some  similar grounds. He was critical of theorists if they were economic re- ductionists, and if they used teleological explanations of development in  accounting for social change. He certainly recognized the significance  of class domination but believed that it was a mistake to invoke fear of  repression and the confusion generated by ideological obfuscations as  the main reasons that many working class people did not identify with  the socialist project. Something more subtle was in play. In response  Gramsci developed his theory of hegemony, which was not a turning  away from, but a contribution to, the working class struggle for social- ism. Gramsci saw his society as a locus of struggle between two hegem- onic projects: the existing successful capitalist one and the insurgent  socialist one.  Gramsci adapted the usual structure/superstructure model by stress- ing that there was a “necessary reciprocity between structure and super- structure a reciprocity which is precisely the real dialectical process”  (Gramsci cited in Morera 1990: 1, 40). Neither continuity nor revolu- tionary change was in principle inevitable or impossible. Such outcomes  depend on conjunctural factors, which depend on the balance of forces.  This balance depends at least in part on how different classes respond  to the circumstance within which they find themselves and on the ef- fects of these responses. The key to understanding these is the concept  of hegemony.  Hegemony involves “the entire complex of practical and theoretical  activities within which the ruling class not only justifies and maintains  its dominance, but manages to win active consent of those over whom  it rules “ (Gramsci 1971: 244). It is exercised by the leading fraction of  the dominant class which has developed a privileged relationship with  a “complex, contradictory discordant ensemble of the social relations  of production” (Gramsci 1971: 366), a relatively permanent “organic”  structure which must be distinguished from more superficial and tran- sitory relations (Gramsci 1971: 177). This leading fraction must suc- cessfully persuade other members of the dominant classes to accept its  leadership. Together these constitute the dominant “Historic Block.”  Gramsci identified two major superstructural “levels”, the one that can  be called “civil society”, that is, the ensemble of organisms commonly  called “private”, and that of “political society” or “the state.” Some of  the subaltern classes may be offered a small role here but the laboring  classes generally are disciplined as much as actively recruited. These  </page> <page sequence="15"> Challenging the anthropomorphiC maSter narrative        633 two levels correspond on the one hand to the functions of “hegemony”  that the dominant group exercises throughout society, and on the other  hand, to that of “direct domination” or command exercised through the  state and “ ‘juridical’ government” (Gramsci 1971: 12). It is important to  note that implicit in this perspective is the possibility that “hegemony”  may also involve some “legitimate” coercion and that social consen- sus, if achieved, less an expression of shared values than it is an “armed  peace,” involving a system of forces, which together produce stasis; it is  as stable or unstable as these forces are stable or volatile.  It is a conventional wisdom that the kinds of cultural activity most  likely to be acknowledged, transmitted and elaborated are simply the  best of their kind, and the criteria can be moral and/or aesthetic. Further,  this cultural activity has such significance only because of its intrinsic  quality, and hence any relation its artists might have with members of  the economic, political and social elites is of no relevance. But if one  concedes that those who own and control the production and distribution  of information have some influence upon its content, then it seems inevi- table that what they consider is acceptable — be it high culture, or gov- ernment announcements, discourses on the state of the world, or Church  epistles — will naturally be disseminated more and probably heard more  than those who do not have much access to this. It does not require con- spiracy or manipulation for this to become the dominant worldview. But  it does require attention to the social organisation of culture.  If we wish to understand more precisely how the dialectic between  the transmission of information and what comes to be needed and de- sired by its recipients works, more attention again needs to be paid to the  potential mediators in these relations and above all to the asymmetries in  the system. “All men are intellectuals” Gramsci noted, “but not all men  have in society the function of intellectuals” (Gramsci in Prison Note- books excerpted in Forgacs 1999: 304). He identified two main kinds of  specialized intellectuals: “organic” and “traditional.” The former tend  to have a reflexive relationship with the world but focus on the inter- ests of a subgroup of the society, often, but not necessarily their class of  origin. “Traditional” intellectuals differ from “organic” intellectuals in  that they are often seen to be independent experts, fulfilling in a profes- sional manner a general societal function. These are “disinterested”, tied  to no particular class or party or social group. Such disinterestedness  is something of an illusion. It is true that they are often independent  professionals and many are recruited from the same background. But  whatever their own background, they tend to work for the most powerful  and wealthy individuals and rarely work for poor peasants, the working  class or the lumpen-proletariat. They were and are much more depen- </page> <page sequence="16"> 634 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(3) 2014 dent upon the dominant classes than they wish to acknowledge. It has  been noted that the Historical Block tends to remain dominant through  changes in regimes and even in changes in the mode of production. Thus  the same “traditional” intellectuals could work for many regimes but few  are likely to support a working class revolution.  There is a social organisation of the production of knowledge and  interpretations of the world and how they are transmitted, heard or read,  interpreted, filtered, retransmitted, archived, retrieved, filtered retrans- mitted etc., but in a highly structured unequal world. Access to the means  of communication is highly asymmetrical both on the level of dissemina- tion and on the level of access. It is important to recognise that this struc- turing of information will also apply to the CC, hence it too is likely to  be hegemonised. Nevertheless, we know that the media are not received  passively nor is their content often enthusiastically endorsed. After all,  there usually are two distinct hegemonies competing to influence per- ceptions. Hence since the CC is often used in conflictual and intense  situations and while it may seem confused, it will also be polysemic and  innovative. gramSCi and durkheim on ChriStianity Gramsci made broad bold statements about religion: a religion is “any  conception of the world that puts itself forward as an ethic”; Christianity  like other established religions is a “multiplicity of distinctive and often  contradictory religions”; Christianity, was always “a Church divided  between two fundamental elements “[t] he Church as a community of  the faithful ...and a clerical organization” (Gramsci cited by Adamson  2013: 270–271). These differing organizational premises are constitu- tive of Christianity and under some circumstances both can be satisfied  by the same Church, as seems to have been true in Christianity’s early  years. But a great deal would change with the 313 CE “Edict of Milan.”  The edict guaranteed religious tolerance and acknowledged property and  other rights. It opened up the possibilities both for building more “com- munities of the faithful” and for an expansion of the “clerical organiza- tion” to institutionalise its priorities. Relatively quickly, this institution- alisation of an increasingly centralised and hierarchical Church margin- alised the “communities of the faithful” and also made relatively rare the  collective experiences of “communitas” (Turner 2012). The Church also  developed a symbiotic relationship with the ruling classes that domin- ated these societies.  </page> <page sequence="17"> Challenging the anthropomorphiC maSter narrative        635 This led to growing estrangement and the emergence of movements,  which manifested themselves either as reform movements such as St  Francis in the 13th century or as heresies in the case of the Protestant  Reformation. But, members of the Catholic hierarchy also declared the  French Revolution a heresy. Gramsci commented: They recognize that a scission occurred in the fundamental mentality and  conception of the world and life.... Otherwise it could be impossible to  account for the mass support of a population that was still profoundly  religious and Catholic for the new ideas and revolutionary policies of the  Jacobins against the clergy (Gramsci 1971: 192–193.) The impulse that the French people experienced was a collective realisa- tion that something was deeply wrong within their cosmos. To see major  disjunctures in dichotomous terms was hardly new for Christians, but  to recognise that this was a problem in the realm of the mundane was a  perceptual shift to a class analysis. What was immediately at stake was  the loss of their Church to the Princes, of the Church itself, of Principal- ities, and of the nation state. They wished to take it back so they could  recreate “communities of the faithful” in a transformed Church. Class  analysis was born as much in the peasant villages of France as in the  teeming streets of Paris.  Durkheim, of course, was sympathetic to the French Revolution, and  its enunciated principles were largely in accord with his own values.  He was not particularly interested in evaluating the ideologies of the  participants, but rather in treating the revolution as a social fact (Durk- heim 1973 [1890]), much as he treated Socialism (Milbrandt and Pearce  2011: 251–254). In the EFRL he discussed the ways in which collective  forces enervated individuals to become inspiring orators and agitators  and groups to respond to crises with extraordinary actions, for example,  when on August 4, 1789 the National Constituent Assembly met and  decided to abolish Feudalism (Durkheim EFRL: 211–213). The Revolu- tion, moreover, saw the dissolution of a creaking and cracked social or- der, long a simulacrum, with its reliance on smoke and mirrors becoming  more and more evident.  For Durkheim, the Revolution was the final clash between, first, a  long line of societies that relied upon a division of labour stalled at an  early stage of development, an over-valuation, indeed sacralisation, of  leaders, a related tendency to treat subjects as property and with the rigid  CC typical of mechanical solidarity; second, the line of societies, origin- ating in the communes and guilds of the Middle Ages-differentiating,  </page> <page sequence="18"> 636 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(3) 2014 democratic, egalitarian and based on organic solidarity. Quoting Saint- Simon but also implicitly endorsing him, Durkheim noted: Thus the history of the old system ... shows us a spectacle of an uninter- rupted decadence. But at the same time that this regressive process was  developing, another was occurring in reverse direction with no less sig- nificance. Industrial and scientific forces, once formed, did not manifest  themselves exclusively by destructive effects, that is, by overthrowing the  old social order. They gave rise to another” (Durkheim 1962 [1928]: 153).  In this context it is useful to turn to the concept of collective efferves- cence, which Durkheim and his group may have discussed more gen- erally but his own conceptualisation seems to have derived from the  accounts he read about Australian aboriginal societies. Collective ef- fervescence can emerge when members of a tribal group have been en- gaging in physically demanding ritual activities for long periods of time  — drumming, singing, dancing and using narcotics — leading them to  surrender themselves to the group and to each other, often thereby trans- gressing various taboos. Not all creative effervescences require narcotics  and frenzy, but they all require a great deal of contact with other group  members. Scenes of collective effervescence are not uncommon nor is  the creativity they unleash: The periods of creation or renewal occur when  men...are led into closer  relationship with each other.... Such was the great crisis of Christendom,  which, in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries gave birth to Scholasticism.  Such were the Reformation and the Renaissance, the revolutionary epoch  and the socialist upheavals of the nineteenth century. At such moments  this higher form of life is lived with ... more or less complete exclusion of  egoism and the commonplace (Durkheim 1953 [1924]: 91–92). Captured in this quote from Durkheim is a sense that there seems to be  some kind of oscillation between periods when societies are rigid, un- equal, hierarchical, forcibly integrated, and lacking joy and when they  become marked by creative effervescence more egalitarian and com- munitarian, more integrated. In Gramscian terms, at different times one  or other of the two constituent elements of the Christian Church becomes  dominant. There is an extraordinary overlap between the two theorists  and theoretical places and spaces where they mutually enhance each  other But I do not think that creative effervescence in a group setting  is necessarily a religious phenomenon. Certainly it is associated with  sacrifice because it involves surrender to the feelings created within the  group and a trust in these, hence the possibility of self-sacrifice. But al- most any group which one is free to join or leave and lasts more than for  </page> <page sequence="19"> Challenging the anthropomorphiC maSter narrative        637 a few meetings is likely to create similar feelings of obligation and hence  expects some sacrifice of autonomy in order to keep the group in exist- ence. Religious groups are merely one example of a wider phenomenon.  Gramsci, I am sure would agree, and Durkheim was ambivalent about  his understanding of religion as a church of the sacred and profane. Was  he widening and in a sense dethroning religion or was he “churchifying”  a wide range of human conduct? The reader might ponder that question  or, perhaps better, formulate new ones ConCluSion Throughout his work, Durkheim attributed agency to sui generis enti- ties (CC, religions, etc.). It seemed then not to be illogical to impute  anthropomorphic traits to these entities, e.g. their ability to “notice” and  “name” problems, “imagine” solutions, and “intervene” in social life to  ensure a functional solution to problems. One of Durkheim’s translators  D.F. Pocock explains this tendency to be “carried away by metaphor” as  being in part due to the fact that Durkheim “was given to rhetoric, and  this especially where the gender of French nouns encourage a certain  anthropomorphism” (Durkheim 1953 [1924]: xxxiii.) These factors may  indeed play a role but I hope it is clear that the problem lies deeper than  that. The anthropomorphism derives from the need in his general soci- ology to conceptualise non-human agents guiding and adjusting social  processes if social reproduction and evolutionary social development is  to occur. In the case of morality or ethics, it stems from the need to find  a supra human to legislate moral and ethical rules in order for people to  feel obligated to obey their diktats. It is more logical to try to establish  empirically the properties possessed by these entities by hypothesising  properties and seeing what empirical evidence reveals. When their prop- erties are established then it may make sense to conceive of these sui  generis entities as institutions as well as emergentist composite beings.  Whichever term is most appropriate, they will bring together heterogen- eous elements some of which may include collective subjects.  Sui generis entities in combination with other sui generis entities  or institutions working systemically often have the emergent property  of systemic reproduction. The ability of a system to reproduce itself is  an emergent property (and one not intrinsically dependent upon con- sciousnesses). Generally speaking, at whichever level one looks there  are emergent properties. Usually some of these properties entail some  autonomy, i.e. degrees of freedom greater than the ability of their gen- erative parents to control, and possibly greater in some areas than the  </page> <page sequence="20"> 638 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(3) 2014 ability of the emergent system to control. As I suggested in my discus- sion of groups, this means that it is by no means inevitable that emergent  entities will act in accordance with the expectations of their “parents”  or the emergent system. This means that when different levels of or- ganisations develop emergent powers, they may be used in ways that  diverge from some overall goals of the institutions to “do other things.”  They may quite regularly prioritise their own immediate goals, over and  above those of the wider system (so upsetting the goals “required” by the  larger “perfect system”). This goes against Durkheim’s assumption that  systems operate in a largely harmonious manner — i.e. that these sys- tems are morphogenetic and morphostatic — and had he not endlessly  deferred detailed analyses of specific sui generis entities he might have  established contrary conclusions.  If we change focus I hope it is clear that the CC will have some sta- bility in its codification of social rules, social evaluations and represen- tations of the world. But it is important to bear in mind that what Durk- heim thought of as the common consciousness, the common medium of  communication and shared understandings, is more accurately thought  of as a dominating consciousness insofar as it becomes the usual taken- for granted reference point constituted in and through the appropriation,  promulgation and circulation of powerful collective representations (or  symbols). But this still can be read as presuming that society works like  a functionalist’s dream, that there are no contradictions, crises and con- flicts, no capacity for other classes and groups of the excluded or the  disillusioned to think outside of this particular box and have a significant  input into the common consciousness. Insofar as there is always some  disorder and some autonomy for different aspects of the social world  but, particularly when a counter-hegemonic discourse is well developed,  the CC will not be a settled discourse, but a site where meanings clash  and where there will be different pressures to favour one discourse over  another. Despite the current prevalence of garrulous discourses produced  by and for those skilled in “knowing the price of everything and the  value of nothing” (Oscar Wilde) their very banality hopefully stimulates  people to look for radical alternatives, of which there were and still are  many, with more intellectual and emotional depth. This re-reading of Durkheim’s early work has provided the basis for  productively synthesizing a Durkheimian general sociology, liberated  from the taint of anthropomorphism, with aspects of Gramscian sociol- ogy. It is hoped that the present work helps pave the way for rendering  a more plausible basis for re-examining the Durkheimian concerns with  social justice, solidarity, equality, democracy and thus an adequately  grounded moral individualism. </page> <page sequence="21"> Challenging the anthropomorphiC maSter narrative        639 referenCeS Adamson, Walter Luiz. 2013.
