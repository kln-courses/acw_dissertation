<plain_text><page sequence="1">Out of Ireland: Revisionist Strategies in Beckett's Drama Laura Barge deliberate and very public effort to situate Samuel Beckett within he Irish dramatic tradition occurred during the 1991 Dublin The- atre Festival when Michael Colgan, Director of the Gate Theatre, remarked that the moment had arrived "to introduce a Dublin Audience to this great writer who needs to be looked at in Ireland."1 Anyone familiar with this writer's history understands only too well Colgan's sense of the ne- cessity of such an introduction. Becketťs personal, cultural, and aesthetic expatriation from Ireland is so adequately documented in the critical and biographical literature that it needs no reiteration here. Instead, we can remember that Beckett chooses early in his career not only to reject but also to insult - albeit with a humorous mockery - the Irish Celtic literary movement, that he forsakes Ireland as homeland in a biographi- cally definitive manner, and that he deliberately adopts French as the language in which he writes. Thus Rodney Sharkey is surely on target when he claims that any effort attempting to "view Beckett in an Irish context cuts its own throat if it chooses to ignore" that Becketťs literary career was definitively formed by the philosophical and aesthetic culture of Europe.2 Embracing as early as 1 934 the aesthetic credo that the writer must cut all ties with familial, national, and cultural origins in order to explore the interior of his own unique vision,3 Beckett early stakes out his literary path and its territory and never departs from it. 175</page><page sequence="2">1 76 Comparative Drama How, then, can we account for Beckett's recitation in the year he died, 1989, on the occasion of the critic Hugh Kenner 's final visit, of the last movement of Yeats's poem "The Tower," beginning with the line refer- ring to artistic self-creation, "Now shall I make my soul"?4 And how explain Beckett's literary Irishness as documented in Vivian Mercier's book The Irish Comic Tradition, in John Harrington's The Irish Beckett, in Mary Junker-Brennan's The Irish Dimension? and in a growing col- lection of scholarly articles? In particular, what should we make of the fact that several of these studies connect specifically both the content and style of Beckett's drama with Irish influences, such as the plays of Yeats, Synge, and O'Casey?6 These numerous evidences of Beckett's lit- erary debt to the history, culture, language, persons, places, and land- scapes of Ireland cannot be ignored. I think the answer to these questions lies in critically situating the Irish influences within the boundaries of Beckett's expatriation, that is, by foregrounding the revisionary nature of the majority of such influ- ences. By following this course, we can contest Anthony Roche's mis- guided assumption that Beckett's quoting Yeats's "Now shall I make my soul" to Hugh Kenner indicated that Beckett had chosen Yeats rather than Joyce as a "major precursor."7 Few statements about Beckett as a writer could be more misleading. As Harrington says, "Beckett's work deconstructs a local revivalism confident of the sureties of place and col- lective consciousness." But Harrington is stopping short of exploring the rich Irish dimension of Beckett's writings when he argues further that because Beckett does not "consequently construct a positive" and "evident alternative" but remains in an "intractable" mode that issues merely in "an endless comedy of substitution," his writings are "unsuit- able for revisionist use."8 I think instead that Beckett moves beyond the stasis of revolt to function as an expatriate Irish writer on the literary frontiers of this century. As Sharkey insists, "...it is important not to view Beckett's Irishness as a type of tale ...signifying nihilism," but rather as the "condition" of "specific Irish experiences" and "understanding" out of which Beckett's "extraordinary artistic vision emerged."9 A strong proof for this claim that springs immediately to mind is Beckett's incredibly innovative response to the work of James Joyce. Nothing could be more expected - and easily executed by someone of</page><page sequence="3">Laura Barge 177 Beckett's genius - than to follow in the revolutionary/revisionary mode executed by Joyce's literary upheaval. That Beckett incorporates in his saying of nothing the revisionary saying of everything by Joyce, and then moves beyond Joyce's amplitude of form and content to an original im- poverishment of both form and content that makes Beckett's achieve- ment equal that of Joyce is a continual cause for astonishment. Further, this interaction with Joyce can serve as a paradigm for Beckett's revision- ist metamorphoses of other Irish material incorporated into the oeuvre. My purpose in this essay is to demonstrate Beckett's revision in his drama of certain particular elements from Irish (or Celtic) philosophi- cal and literary traditions. The first two elements can be termed intuitive beliefs about what it is like to live on the planet Earth and the third a literary choice of style or form for best rendering such perceptions of life. In each instance, an assumed intuitive belief about human existence is so put in question - or the literary style used to convey such a belief so undermined - that either the belief is rejected as untenable or the choice of style is exposed as artistically inept. Thus Beckett turns certain as- sumptions of Irish thought that he finds at odds with actual human experience, or Irish literary forms that he finds less than artistically au- thentic, into his own literary profit by incorporating revisions of these elements into the content or structure of his drama. If such strategies expose, as they obviously do, a rejection of traditional assumptions about life and art, the maneuvers also reveal the Irish philosophical and stylis- tic roots of his writing, in our concern here, of the drama. I The first element is the mystical belief of ancient Celtic Druids that humanity and divinity share pantheistically in the landscape.10 The ear- liest Irish philosophical expression of this kinship of worshiper with na- ture is that of Scottus Eriugena, Ireland's ninth-century theologian/phi- losopher, who "can be said to have translated the Irish ideology of the human/divine relationship from mythology into metaphysics." Eriugena's major writing is entitled (by translation) "On Nature" and describes the natural world as a "pantheistic mediation" between the divine and the human that effaces the distinction between the two and makes a unity of</page><page sequence="4">1 78 Compara rive Drama God, the human, and the natural world.11 Dermot Moran explains that Eriugena's descriptions are part of an effort to advance the assimilation of Christian thought into Neoplatonism, a theory that views all created matter, both natural and human, as emanating from and dependent for existence on an original and divine One, with such movement marked by a desire to imitate the One in a subordinate way and a striving to return to and unite with the One. Moran points out that Eriugena's ad- vance of this Christian Neoplatonism stresses the present created order (nature) as therefore being in perpetual progress. Because time as expe- rienced is an illusion, the creation is and has always been in a progres- sion that culminates in a return to the One. In spite of the disruption of the Fall, "at no stage is creation to be seen as an alienation or separation of things from God."12 Thus in both ancient (Druidic) and medieval (Eriugena's) forms, Celtic concepts ornature describe the landscape as a dynamic community of the human with other physical forms and with the divine. Christopher Bamford coins this Celtic view of nature as one of "ecological holiness" and notes that numerous beliefs and traditions of the Celtic Church witness to this distinct perspective.13 Celtic legend relates that, at the crucifixion of Christ, Irish sages "felť the "'groans and travails of creation cease."'14 The legendary reference is to St.Paul's claim (Romans 8: 21-22) that the death and resurrection of Christ effected a future deliverance of the physical creation from bond- age (decay and death resulting from the Fall) into liberty (a freed cre- ation of a new heaven and earth).15 Another legend narrates that Saint Bridget or Brid, as a child, was led to a stable in a desert land, where she "placed three drops of holy water [on the Christ child] to unite him with the earth." The land had been in a state of drought, but now the cows gave milk freely, and the child drank it as an offering of the earth. Bamford notes that the present appearance of the landscape in Ireland - its ruins of historical hermitages and monasteries - reminds viewers of the Celtic idea of a "tremendous proximity of the human and divine in nature, an abandonment to spiritual work and simultaneously a cultivation of the earth." Eriugena is said to have considered "Scripture and Nature" as the "two shoes of Christ."16 Such ideas of a sacred nature are apparent in Keith Sagar's defini- tions of both ancient and modern Celtic poets' use of the natural world.</page><page sequence="5">Laura Barge 179 Sagar is claiming that Ted Hughes is essentially Celtic rather than Anglo- English because of the influence on Hughes' poetry of the section of England where Hughes spent his childhood. This section along the Calder River was the last area of the once-Celtic British mainland to be con- quered by the Angles. According to Sagar, the area does not simply ap- pear as setting in Hughes' poetry, but its "dramatic, insistent, and wild" character emerges as a "fund of vital images" and as a "paradigm for... understanding... life." Furthermore, the apprehension of landscape for the Celtic poet is always "religious" because it expresses the "depths of the human psyche" and connects these depths with the "hidden sources of everything in the non-human world," sources which are strong and yet mysterious as they both participate in and mirror the human struggle to overcome death and existential nothingness.17 It is easy not only to agree with Sagar 's definitions of Hughes' artistic use of nature as at least quasi-Celtic but also to identify similar uses in Irish writers as major as Yeats and Joyce. Although Yeats earns consider- able literary mileage from debating whether attention to the "soul" as something abstract, ideally housed in art, might be the pathway to im- mersion in "holy fire" ("Sailing to Byzantium") or "to God" ("Under Ben Bulben"), he chooses as the preferred symbol of the essence of hu- man life a bodily "self" pitched into the throes of nature, even if that nature is the "frog-spawn of a... ditch" ("A Dialogue of Self with Soul"). As for Joyce, Molly Bloom's mental monologue on the celebration (or worship) of bodily, sexual, or natural life at the closing of Ulysses is con- tained within repeated images of the natural world - flowers (seven va- rieties), birds, the sea, the sun, and, above all, the animality of Molly's own body. Of course, neither Hughes', Yeats's, nor Joyce's nature is religious in Eriugena's theistic sense. Instead, at the risk of throwing these three writers together at this point, we can describe each of them as profane or secular. But the secularism is religiously Celtic in its vital bonding of the physical world, human life, and whatever idea of the sacred is at hand. Nature does not symbolize some transcendent dimension beyond human expe- rience. Instead, life in nature is an existence in which humans are in com- munity with the sacred through a participation in the physical processes of being. If a counter argument citing Yeats's mythical Spiritus Mundi as</page><page sequence="6">1 80 Comparative Drama a transcendent source of the good is made, the reply is that this store- house of life-enhancing images and ideas is itself situated in the natu- ral - the mythical reservoir of a collective human consciousness. Thus we have only to allow these modern Celtic writers to replace Eriugena's traditional deity with their profane counterparts to realize that modern Irish literature also establishes a sublime presence in the fleshly warp and woof of the natural world. Before demonstrating that Beckett structures an ironic revision in his writings of this motif of the natural world as benevolently sacred, we must ask what Beckett knew of (1) the Celtic mythology and (2) Eriugena's Neoplatonic interpretation of that mythology. Vivian Mercier is the critic who has convincingly linked Beckett with early Gaelic my- thology. In his book The Irish Comic Tradition, he argues that the "gro- tesque and macabre" depictions of sexuality that pervade Beckett's canon are derived from a Celtic mixture of the emotions of pleasure, holy dread, and awe that mark the ancient Celtic response to the mysteries of repro- duction. Because Mercier 's arguments are validated by Beckett's canon as a whole, they cannot be - and have not been - refuted. However, Mercier concedes that "Beckett's relationship to the Gaelic tradition seems tangential indeed." Beckett's mention to Mercier that he attended the Abbey Theatre regularly for a year does not change Mercier's belief that there is little if "any direct contact" by Beckett with Gaelic mythology at any stage of Beckett's formal education. Thus Mercier concludes that Beckett demonstrates the "peculiar case" of an "Anglo-Irishman who... seems to fit comfortably into the Gaelic tradition yet has almost no con- scious awareness of what that tradition is. Beckett might be described as in the Gaelic tradition but not o/it." Where and how then did Beckett absorb the notions of sexuality that characterize his work? Mercier sug- gests that the "oral culture of any area is far richer and more complex than its literary culture, especially where two languages and two cultures interact, as they do in Ireland."18 My claim is that, in a process similar to that whereby the sexual motifs came to shape Beckett's fiction and drama, an ironic retention of Celtic ideas of nature gained place in the writings as well.19 As for Eriugena's Neoplatonism, the critic Eyal Amiran has written an entire book that very adequately links Beckett with the traditional</page><page sequence="7">Laura Barge 181 Neoplatonic quest but not necessarily to Eriugena's ideas of the role of nature in such a quest. Defining the questing Beckettian subject's "goal" or "object" as the "All or nothingness... or God" Amiran sees the "de- volving protagonists from Belacqua [More PricksThan Kicks]" as being on a Neoplatonic "progressive serialization of the self" toward its goal. To support his argument, Amiran documents substantial evidence of Beckett's readings in this tradition.20 I agree with Amiran that a quest structure toward some kind of per- ceived transcendence undergirds the Beckettian oeuvre and have noted, additionally, that a protagonist's impetus to undertake such a quest is nearly always a response to a summons from some landscape or object in the natural world.21 Thus Beckett's descriptions of nature seldom if ever function merely as settings for a plot or as ground for a figure. In- stead, they become figurative language, tropes for the dark world through which the figure journeys, whether in present action or in narratives of memory. Beckett plays on the traditional literary habit of matching land- scape to happenings by crafting in a reverse mode appearances of nature that function ironically. A protagonist responds to some perceived beauty or benefice in the natural world, or in his memory of that world, that appears to offer promise of connecting Beckett's impoverished self with something that can result in a subject's realizing its goal or object (i.e., Watt's anticipation of realizing a harmony with nature by journeying to Mr. Watt's estate in the novel Watt). Within this paradigm, however, the appearances are ironic. Any response of a Beckett protagonist to per- ceived beauty or benefice in the natural world is dead-ended because nature consistently falls flat on its face in a mocking betrayal of any no- tions of Eden or Paradise. The protagonist's response to such betrayal is perhaps best capsuled in Malone's words in the second book of Beckett's trilogy, Mahne Dies. Malone consigns "all this scenery" to hell and decides that the only place it could possibly have arisen is the "Un- derground."22 Classic examples of this demonic and betraying nature in the drama occur in Beckett's best known and most developed plays - Waiting for Godot and Endgame. The one stage prop denoting the natural world in Godot is the notorious tree."[B]lack and bare" throughout the first act, in the second, it is suddenly and inexplicably "covered with leaves."</page><page sequence="8">1 82 Comparative Drama Estragon suggests that the season of "Spring" has caused the leaves to appear, but Vladimir reminds him that even in spring leaves do not erupt on trees so suddenly.23 And the audience remembers that a tree is, in traditional symbolism, the Christian cross, and that the cross is suppos- edly what all human history has waited for. On Becketťs stage, however, the waiting never ends, and the tree never moves beyond being a meta- phorical image on a stage. As Morot-Sir explains, Becketťs images fail to symbolize because they are manichean by definition: the word or word group ironically presented as a symbol is forever split from the meta- physical entity that it purports to symbolize.24 The ironic import of Becketťs dramatic image is apparent: the promise of the tree's new leaves is just that, a dramatic metaphor that signifies its own failure to symbol- ize or mean. A piece of nature not present but referred to in Godot is the skull or stone repeatedly shouted by Lucky in his tirade just before the three op- ponents silence and overthrow him in Act One (Godot 29b). Mary Junker- Brennan identifies this skull-like stone as the Turoe Stone, a granite rock in Ireland about four feet high that is "an anthropomorphic image of pagan worship, dating from around 279 B.C." Thus Lucky's passionate and strange speech is associated with ancient "oracular divinations" once uttered in Celtic ritual. Lucky locates the stone in Connemara (Godot 29b) , a western section of County Galway that is about sixty-eight square miles in area. A region of renowned natural beauty, its landscapes have often been painted.25 For Lucky, the mention of the stone and its sur- roundings becomes an ironic reference to a remembered landscape in a tirade that, although having the surface appearance of nonsense gibber- ish, functions as a last comment to the audience on his predicament. In Act Two, Lucky's desperation and defeat are limited to the visual: both he and Pozzo lie helpless "among the scattered baggage" (Godot 49b) only to rise and eventually exit accompanied by the "noise of falling* (57b). When, in Endgame, Clov positions the telescope toward the window to obey Hamrns command to "Look at the earth," he describes what he sees with the single adjective "Corpsed ." Hamm asks if Clov sees the waves of the ocean, the light of the horizon, or seagulls. Hamm's question suggests that such objects may be visible, and Becketťs stage directions indicate that Clov "turns the telescope on the waves" But Clov</page><page sequence="9">Laura Barge 183 persists in his gloom: the "waves" he sees are "Lead" the "sun" is "Zero," and the light is "Gray" or "Light black. From pole to pole." Hamm later tells Clov of another viewing of the earth from a window, apparently before Clov's day, "in the land of the living." This viewer is a "madman who thought the end of the world had come." Hamm relates pulling the man to the window of an asylum to see the beauty of nature: Look! There! All that rising corn! And there! Look! The sails of the her- ring fleet! All that loveliness! What the madman sees, however, is "ashes," apparently a similar sight to what Clov sees through his window in the place where he and Hamm now are.26 The dialogue between Hamm and Clov does not even raise the ques- tion of Hamirís actually seeing a world of natural beauty. In two of Becketťs late short fictional pieces, The Lost Ones and Lessness, nature is reduced to either a myth or a figment of the imagination.27 At any rate, we know there is no longer such a world outside the window in Endgame. A few verbal exchanges later in the play, Hamm excoriates Clov for imag- ining that the earth's condition might change for the better: But what in God's name do you imagine? That the earth will awake in spring? That the rivers and seas will run with fish again? That there's manna in heaven still for imbeciles like you? (53) Instead, whatever is seen outside the window fits well James E. Robinson's definitions of the Beckettian "space of infinity." This critic claims that Endgame is Becketťs "most intricate exercise in presenting figurations of an eschatology of infinity" because Hamm and Clov are looking out into space that approaches "spacelessness, the void." He describes this space as "a bounded world from which the characters struggle for release," but one in which release is not possible because "a myth of infinity replaces the traditional myth of passage to eternity."28 While the room is, of course, the primary unit of space in the play, the implied extended space outside the windows qualifies as theatrical space as well. To allow that this space is virtual - like Henry Vaughan's view of "Eternity" as a "great Ring of pure and endless light" in the poem "The World" - rather than actual does not make it hypothetical. The theatrical space outside becomes a metaphor for the primary stage space inside the room, thus collapsing both spaces into each other. Hamm warns Clov that, one day after "a</page><page sequence="10">1 84 Comparative Drama little sleep," Clov will open his eyes to discover that there is "no wall any more... Infinite emptiness will be all around you... you'll be like a little bit of grit in the middle of the steppe" (Endgame 36). In spite of Hamm's obsessive interest in what is out the window and use of nostalgic lyricisms about nature, the only earth available for humans is a "world where all... [is] silent and still and each thing in its last place, under the last dust" (57). In this revision of the mystic benefice of Celtic nature, Beckett con- structs a nature of which there are only vestiges of a lost beauty, loveli- ness is reduced to Hamm's remembered view from the window of the asylum, and the audience wonders who saw what was actually there - Hamm or the madman. Lest we be tempted to escape from the metaphysical import of Endgame's natural scenery, we can remember Beckett's controversy with the American Repertory Theatre's production of this drama in the win- ter of 1984. Staged at the Loeb Drama Center in Cambridge, Massachu- setts, this version of Endgame is recast to depict an industrialized and impersonal contemporary world. The setting is an underground subway tunnel. A "bombed-out, vandalized subway car" reaches halfway across stage from the left and a "large puddle of water" extends toward the right. The backdrop is a wall as high as the stage itself, against which lean nar- row iron ladders reaching up to where the windows in Beckett's stage directions might have appeared. Several used oil drums strew the stage. All those involved in this production, a version obviously presenting an earth environmentally ruined by humans, were pleased with their inno- vative recasting of the play, but Beckett was very displeased, as his verbal responses indicate."This is terrible. This has nothing to do with my play. They can't do this. They have no permission to do this." Amid much serious controversy, the production opened, with playbills containing Beckett's disclaimer and a copy of the first page of the original play with its explicit description of the setting."My play requires," the disclaimer insists, "an empty room and two small windows."29 And, outside Beckett's windows, as we have noted, the environment is not one ruined by hu- man technology but an apocalyptic landscape that images with vestiges of beauty Beckett's world of false promise that is the only habitat pro- vided for humans. This claim, and my argument above, are not focused on whether</page><page sequence="11">Laura Barge 185 JoAnne Akalaitis's set should have been used in this production of Endgame. The struggle over whether what Beckett claims is his authorial intention should or can control what occurs in the space where his drama is staged continues unabated and appears to be moving beyond the gov- ernance of the Beckett family and literary estate. Whatever ensues from this struggle, we remember Becketťs persistent efforts during his lifetime to "control... the formal integrity of his private vision" in all performances of his writing.30 My argument here is that Becketťs "pri- vate vision" of nature in Endgame is an ironic reversal of the Celtic no- tion of the natural world as created by God to be the means of a blessed and efficacious joining of the human and the divine. As foreground, we can remember that Becketťs literary descriptions of natural settings, whether in the fiction or drama, almost never func- tion merely as landscapes. He does, of course, often situate his dramatic (and fictional) figures in a natural environment. But whenever that en- vironment is delineated as natural landscape, the language slips almost imperceptibly into a discourse of irony. Knowlson records that the scenery outside the window in Endgame has been shaped by Becketťs reading of the Flood narrative in Genesis while he was writing the play. Thus the scene is one of a&lt;discreation': an earth divided between land and water; Hamm's home, like an ark, a refuge from the outside world; a creation where, instead of being found good in the eyes of God, the light is dying; a land where the earth brings forth no grass and where Clov's seeds will 'never sprout.'" In an early draft of the play, Beckett has one character reading from the Genesis narrative rephrase God's expression of grief about creating humans (Genesis 6:6) into a specific lament that he has created Noah. This rephrasing of the allusion indicates that Beckett, Hamm, and Clov share God's remorse about the creation of Noah and of any other humans, including themselves.31 None of Beckett's use of Genesis here suggests that present-day environmental needs are a the- matic concern of the play. Neither traditional readings of the biblical narrative nor Beckett's comments on the landscape he constructs for Endgame imply that the wasteland produced by the Flood was the result of humans' ruining their natural habitat. In the traditional reading, God destroys almost all humankind for behavior defined in Genesis as sins of idolatry and of violence against each other. In Beckett's view, humans</page><page sequence="12">1 86 Comparative Drama who live on the earth also surfer, but this suffering is neither the result of behavior biblically defined as sin nor of humans' neglect of the environ- ment.32 Instead, the misery results from the universal Beckettian sin of having been born on the planet Earth. Knowlson also reminds us of Beckett's personal grieving over his brother's death during the composition of Endgame and rightly associ- ates the play's picturing of human experience as existence on a blasted earth as "sparked out of [the] darkness and pain" of this loss. But, as Knowlson carefully notes, "Endgame is not... autobiographical drama."33 And John Pilling explains that a specific loss from death is not necessary to determine Beckett's dark vision, that suffering is simply the way things are, that we exist always in what Beckett sees as the "world of the Old Testament," where "God, in conceiving the world, brought forth suffer- ing, and it would be better for us all not to have been born." Pilling ex- plains, "Beckett's attitude is gnostic or manichean. The God who created the world was Satan."34 Beckett's refusal, when preparations were underway for the first per- formance of Endgame in London, to allow the British censor, Lord Scarborough, to omit or modify the "prayer passage" (54-55) in which Hamm concludes that his and Clov's prayers are futile because God is a bastard and does not exist35 reinforces the play's sardonic indictment of whatever demiurge has brought forth the earth. The centrality of the motif is emphasized as well by Nagg's notorious recitation of the tailor who takes three months to make the Englishman's trousers defending himself from the Englishman's exasperated reminder that it took God only six days to make the world by favorably comparing the trousers with God's botched creation (22-23). As Knowlson points out, this lan- guage of indictment is "a particularly empty kind of rhetoric," arising as it does out of the established and "profound agnosticism" of the play- wright.36 But logic has never been a strong component of the rhetoric of Beckett's people, this rhetoric being composed more, as Beckett says of the language of this play, to make the "text daw"37 than to communicate rational knowledge.38 Endgame is not the only play by Beckett where a recognition of irony in descriptions of the natural world is crucially important. In the radio play All That Fall, the voices of the ten characters, the sounds denoting</page><page sequence="13">Laura Barge 187 the various vehicles involved in the journey, and the multiple "[r]ural sounds" that accompany this journey combine into a medley of sound that not only questions but also denies and mocks the veracity of Psalm 145:14: "The Lord upholdeth all that fall and raiseth up all those that be bowed down." Mrs. Rooney is bowed down with long-standing grief and the decrepitude of age; Mr. Rooney is blind and longs for nothing so much as to be relieved enough of the burden of life that he can at least sit still and not be forced into movement. The minor voices heard indicate also either a state of grief or disease: as Mrs. Rooney assures Mr. Slocum, everyone is going in the same "direction," the direction of death.39 In fact, although some of Beckett's infamous couples are more disabled than the Rooney's, none are more ludicrously moribund than this Irish pair proceeding down a country road to the faint strains of "Death and the Maiden." As Gregory Schirmer notes, this road appears as a hill of ascent that must be scaled, but Becketťs name for the town that serves as set- ting for the play is Boghill.40 Nature as mentally visualized exists in this drama in two mentions of a flower ("that lovely laburnum" [37, 85]), clouds and a sunset (53), and the scenery surrounding a racecourse (61). But, as one would ex- pect, nature as sound dominates the play. Becketťs directions call for the sounds of at least ten rural animals, both domestic and wild (he insists that the sounds can be produced by humans41). Also, ironic allusions to the donkey that Christ rides into Jerusalem and the sparrows used in his teaching claiming that God cares for humans occur in the dialogue, with each allusion made by Mrs. Rooney. A look at Sidney Homan's reading in his book Becketťs Theaters: Interpretations for Performance (1984) tellingly shows how a failure to recognize Becketťs demonic nature imagery can lead to a misinterpreta- tion of the entire play. Homan's reading of the drama interprets the natu- ral sounds Romantically, connects them exclusively with Mrs. Rooney in contrast to the other characters, and claims that the play demonstrates the artistic human spirit (Mrs. Rooney s) in conflict with the otherwise "shallow," "decaying," outer physical world of less imaginative mortals. Thus Mrs. Rooney's escape from the "shallow earthiness of the people with whom she interacts" and her ability to preserve the subjective spirit of the artist from the "fading" and "falling" all around her are signaled</page><page sequence="14">188 Comparative Drama by her responsiveness to a mystical element in the sounds of nature.42 If Homan's reading is on target, then All That Fall is not a revision of Irish/ Celtic notions ornature but a continuation and affirmation ofthat tra- dition. The problem is, however, that almost any dispassionate reading of All That Folly research into other critical analyses of the play, and com- parison with almost any of Beckett's other writings reveal the misdirec- tion of Homan's interpretations. Even a casual reading by someone not particularly acquainted with Beckett's work of a passage that Homan calls a "beautiful threnody" designed to example the artistic vision of Mrs.Rooney43 reveals this misdirection: Mr. Roomy There is a dead dog down there. Mrs. Roomy No no, just the rotting leaves. Mr. Roomy In June? Rotting leaves in June? Mrs. Roomy Yes dear, from last year, and from the year before last, And from the year before that again. (Silence. Rainy wind. They move on. Drag- ging steps, etc.) There is that lovely laburnum again. Poor thing, it is los- ing all its tassels. (Dragging steps, etc.) There are the first drops. (Rain. Dragging feet, etc.) Golden drizzle. (Dragging steps, etc.) Do not mind me dear, I am just talking to myself. (Rain heavier. Dragging steps, etc.) Can hinnies procreate, I wonder. They halt, on Mr. Roomy's initiative.(S5) Beckett's empathy with the suffering of his protagonists as they struggle with the natural elements of the earth is apparent, as it is throughout the drama. Mrs. Rooney's grief is very real - her only daughter has died long ago, her relationship with her husband is reduced to a common experi- ence of loss, and life has become a holding with the fingernails onto whatever the present offers with an almost irrepressible desire to let go. In these circumstances, her remembrance (86) of Christ's teaching in the New Testament that God cares more for humans than he does for spar- rows (Luke 12: 6-7) means no more than her knowledge that Christ once rode a donkey into Jerusalem (Luke 19: 35-36). The allusions to objects of nature and the natural sounds in this radio play have nothing to do with the functioning of the artistic spirit by escape from the physical. Instead the natural sounds are sounds of the Fall, both Eve's and Mrs. Rooney's. As such, they function as failed or ironic figurative comment</page><page sequence="15">Laura Barge 189 in three ways. Any auditory segment of nature in the play, whether falsely lyrical or overtly ludicrous, reminds us hearers of the sounds that we are mortals who are inescapably rooted in a decaying earth, that this rootedness is a dark comedy, and that any hint of natural beauty or ben- efice is a false beaconing toward an Eden or Paradise that is not there. Becketťs ironic revision of the Irish Eriugena's high view of the natu- ral world is not a superficial but an integral part of the movement of these and many other of Becketťs protagonists, who are most often en- gaged in some kind of quest to discover who, what, and where they are. Eriugena reshapes a primitive Celtic belief that mystical contact with the created world yields access to the creator ofthat world into a philosophy that describes humans' spiritual affinity with the natural habitat as a step toward self-knowledge that, in turn, leads to a "true knowledge and love of God."44 But Becketťs pilgrims cannot learn such lessons, and the natu- ral beauty of the landscape through which they journey mocks all no- tions of any unity with a benign creator. II A second philosophical state of being defined in Irish thought that Beckett turns topsy-turvy and incorporates into the literary structure of his drama is the solution(s) of Bishop Berkeley to the skepticism of the eighteenth century. While there is no evidence that Beckett ever read Eriugena, we know that he read Berkeley. In fact, the definitive edition of Berkeleys works was edited by Becketťs tutor at Trinity College, A. A. Luce.45 Becketťs antipathy/attraction to Berkeley is obvious. No way can Beckett or any of his protagonists rest in Berkeley's three metaphysical certainties: a conve- nient reduction of all material substances to ideas, thus solving the mind/ body dichotomy; the affirmation of a substantial but nonmaterial self, based solely on the mind's awareness of memory; and Descartes' simplistic proof for the existence of God that depends on the fact that a person can hold the idea of such a being although the human consciousness is incapable of forming such an idea in and of itself.46 But Berkeley's famous insistence (from the Principles of Human Knowledge) that esse estpercipi - to be is to be perceived - appears as a necessary but never achieved requirement for realized selfhood everywhere in Beckett's writings, perhaps most notably</page><page sequence="16">190 Comparative Drama in the screenplay entitled Film. Here Berkeley's certainties are rendered most uncertain in an almost silent film (the woman of the couple in the street articulates a single faint "sssh!" to her partner [ 16] ). Beginning with Berkeley's dictum quoted in the Latin as headnote, Beckett's "General" introduction warns the unwary that "No truth value attaches to above, regarded as of merely structural and dramatic convenience."47 In this single venture of Beckett into the medium of the cinema, the camera, E (Eye), follows a man, О (Object), as he flees down a street, into a house, and up a flight of stairs to enter a room. As these actions ensue, the camera as E continually perceives О from behind at an exact angle reaching to but not exceeding forty-five degrees. This angle is the limit of visibility that can occur without О experiencing what Beckett's stage notes call the "anguish of perceivedness" from being observed by E ( 1 1 ). As О enters the room, he draws a curtain over the single window, drapes a mirror with his coat, rips God the Father's picture off the wall, ejects a dog and a cat, hides the eyes of a parrot and a goldfish, and tears up, with trembling but decisive choice, seven photos related to his past life that he has carried with him into the room (23-39). As О then settles, with both dejection and apprehension, into dozing off and rocking in a chair (that has two additional watching eyes in its headrest), E's face, which is O's "but with [a] very different expression, impossible to describe, neither severity nor benignity, but rather acute intentness (47)" purposely moves out of the angle of the safety zone to confront О with a direct and ag- gressive gaze. О returns the stare in terror, closes his eyes, covers his face with his hands, and rocks to stillness as Film ends (11-61). The title of this production emphasizes that it is a film and not a play on a stage. Longman notes a fundamental difference between the focused spaces of these two kinds of performances. Like a stage, a screen is "also a confined space" but with a "fundamental difference: the con- finement is variable and shifts with the camera." There is something pe- culiarly passive about filmed space. Whatever is there "depends on the eye of the camera," and anything can enter that the camera can locate.48 Pilling suggests that the only authentic space in the film is the room the figure enters and that "this terrifying denouement might have made as much sense without the preliminaries."49 But perhaps the movement of the two figures from outside to inside is necessary to communicate the</page><page sequence="17">Laura Barge 191 sense of hostile entrapment in this piece. As Brater insightfully com- ments, E or the "cyclopean antagonist is not so easily subdued, for the superhuman eye of the camera is not subject to humiliating limitations like time and space. It is there to greet him [O] even in the... shelter."50 Several critical misreadings of Film result precisely from a failure to carefully relate what Beckett is doing in the film with Berkeley's thought. One optimistic reading offered by several critics sees the final locked gaze of the two sundered selves, О and E, as depicting a fusion of the double selves of Beckett's troubled and split identity. O/E has achieved genuine self-knowledge through the ordeal, and the dual perception of the now single self implies a breaking down of physic divisions and the attain- ment of unity at a core of stillness.51 The primary problem with this read- ing is its strangeness in Beckett's canon. Throughout both the drama and the fiction, Beckett's protagonist continually seeks authentic selfhood, but, as I have claimed in analyzing the Beckettian self, the subjective self never finds an objective self that can be defined as the true self, that is, as the ultimate core of being. "The I never finds a me that the / intuitively senses itself in essence to be."52 In Film Berkeley's unified mind/body identity, perceived by God and thus secured as an idea in the conscious- ness, is revised by Beckett into a split identity perceived only by its double in the false refuge of an anguished microcosmic awareness. Such irrec- oncilable division of the self is the persistent state of Beckett's protago- nist.53 Other readings that recognize the playwright's revisionist manipu- lations of Berkeley's certainties by acknowledging that О and E remain locked in separateness, and thus fail to achieve a unified, authentic self, do not recognize that Beckett's sensibilities remain in tune with Berkeley's certainties. The problem is that the playwright cannot arrive at the logic that secures the desirable certainties. While it is true that Beckett houses his protagonists in a deconstructed universe of the postmodern mode, they, like their existentialist cousins, are not at home in this world. Beckett is traditionalist in the modern (not postmodern) mode in that his people long for a perceiving Eye that will confer the unified being of an authen- tic self that they, unlike the existentialist heroes, cannot create for them- selves. Thus suggestions that any Beckett protagonist wants to escape all perception so as to achieve annihilation of the self,54 or that the flux of</page><page sequence="18">1 92 Comparative Drama the shifting duality of О and E is the desirable outcome because accept- ing our unstable identity can deliver us from notions of the unrealistic ideal of a unified self 55 do not hold in Beckett's revisionist use of Berkeley's formulas. О does not tear God the Father's likeness from the wall because, while Beckett agrees with Berkeley that to be is to be per- ceived, he departs from the philosopher in a tossing away of the need of being perceived by God.56 Like Estragon (Waiting for Godot 49b) and Winnie, of Beckett's Happy Days,57 О has no knowledge of beneficial observation by a God who sees him, but, also like these dramatic coun- terparts, he would settle for any perceiving eye to give the "impression" of authentic existence (Waiting for Godot 44b). Surely neither Film nor Beckett's oeuvre as such is an expression of the desire not to exist, for annihilation of the self. All of Beckett's protagonists, without exception, reject the apparent solution to this goal - suicide. Just as they, also with- out exception, reach beyond the layers of habit and a superficial consciousness to explore the self in efforts to discover an assumed but elusive core of authentic and unified being. The following observations about Film bear out these claims. О is fleeing to a room that Beckett's notes indicate cannot be his own and therefore may be supposed to be that of his mother (59). Like Molloy, the early protagonist of Beckett's first book of the trilogy, he seeks the womb, the origins of selfhood. Watching him flee to the room, we realize that he is bent on escaping from the perceiving eyes of outer surround- ings in order to gaze on the persons in the seven photos he carries with him into the room. (If О were attempting to escape all perception, why does he bring the photos with him, each of which depicts return gazes of human eyes?) Picking up each photo twice, with trembling hands, О returns the gaze, only to tear up and throw the photo on the floor. The photos are of himself progressing onward from childhood and of the loved persons whose given and received perceptions should have fash- ioned O's authentic macrocosmic self but instead have interacted with О so as to leave him with a reservoir of memories that, as always in Beckett's world, torment rather than comfort. Having destroyed the photos, О proceeds in the Murphy-like ritual of the rhythmic rock into ascesis, a microcosmic state of escape from the pain of life in the macrocosm. But the descent inward is no escape from distress because О is now outside</page><page sequence="19">Laura Barge 193 the safety area of E's previously diverted perception. In this perilous zone, the self-as-object confronts the self-as-subject as the only agent of per- ception.58 But self-perception will not confer the sense of a coherent self granted by Berkeley's divine perception, nor is any help forthcoming from God the Father, whose picture is torn and tossed on the floor. In a typi- cally Beckettian maneuver, О is identified pathetically with God the Son in the confrontation. The first image of E's face visible to the audience, which, of course, is also O's face, features a "big nail... visible near [the] left temple" - the nail remaining from the tearing down of the picture (47). Like his counterparts - for instance, the little figure of Beckett's short fictional piece Ping - O/E bears traces of Beckett's crucifixion of existing on the planet Earth. To understand what Beckett is doing by interweav- ing Berkeley's formulas into the structural movement of Film, we must read the text of the Notes in the script more closely: "Search of non- being in flight from extraneous perception breaking down in inescapability of self-perception" (11). Other than the painful inadequacy of "extraneous perception," self perception is all there is, and the self as subject staring at the self as object in the depths of Beckett's microcosm does not end "non-being." Ill Unlike his Irish theological and philosophical forebears, Beckett al- lows his dramatis personae no consolation of the presence of a divine benevolence in the Earth's ecological spaces. Nor does a divine Eye be- stow on the figures in these ecological spaces any gratuity of identity or unity of the self. Such deprivation serves to shape what John Fletcher terms Beckett's artful achievement of "distill [ing] in words" an "experi- ence, or a vision, of the misery and of the desperateness of life."59 Precisely in accord with the demanding aesthetic theory that Beckett ev- erywhere expounds, then, the forms of art must correspond to this vision and not to illusionary notions of life. Thus Beckett commends Proust for the integration of form and content when the "one is a con- cretion of the other, the revelation of a world." Such a "world is expressed metaphorically by the artisan because it is apprehended metaphorically by the artist."60 Beckett rejects the "classic" form of Kafka because the</page><page sequence="20">1 94 Comparative Drama "consternation" of the literature is controlled and thus hidden in the form.61 Beckett's rejection, however, is not a repudiation of form (of or- der in art) but a search for a "new form" that "admits" or "accommo- dates" the "chaos" or "mess" of life.62 Beckett, of course, is not unique in his rejection of verisimilitude in favor of metaphor. Joyce makes similar choices as he moves from the surface realism of the Dublin stories to the symbolic flow of subjectivity in Ulysses to linguistic metaphor depicting the subconscious in Finnegans Wake. In fact, such a patterned sequence of stylistic movement toward symbol and/or metaphor is apparent everywhere in the modernism and postmodernism that follow the realism and naturalism of the late nine- teenth century. But Beckett's embrace of a form comprised essentially of metaphori- cal images does serve to demonstrate once again his strategy of appro- priation and revision of Irish sources, in this case, the plays of the Irish dramatist John Millington Synge. The several studies connecting Beckett's drama with that of Synge recognize that the two writers share a similar tragi-comic view of life.63 That is, Beckett's "vision" (to borrow Fletcher's term) of human experience is noticeably similar to that of Synge. His method of rendering that vision in dramatic form, however, is a revision of realistic portrayals into metaphorical images. A comparison of two plays - Synge's Riders to the Sea and Beckett's Happy Days - can chart exactly how Beckett begins with a viewpoint quite similar to Synge's very Irish perception of human experience as existing within environments of harsh necessity, scarcity of needed resources, and a "drab monotony"64 and proceeds to shape this worldview not into a realistic dramaturgy like that of Synge but into the poetic images of his metaphorical drama. The loss experienced by Synge's Maurya is so expansive that we lack adequate adjectives to describe it. Although her familial roles as daugh- ter, wife, and mother have exclusively defined her life, her husband, her father-in-law, and six sons have died at sea. The identification of a reader or viewer with such grief can be profound, but realism provides Synge's audience with an orientation of familiarity in this tragic world. The en- closure of theatrical tragedy within what we can call the envelope or skin of ordinary life can move an audience to empathy but seldom to alien- ation. And it is only in the effect of alienation that the most stark and</page><page sequence="21">Laura Barge 195 searching response to tragedy occurs. In 1960 Eva Metman astutely observes: ...[D]ramatic art has always been concerned with... the great archetypal powers which can determine... life [I]t has [in realistic drama] shown the visible and tangible world... as permeated by the demonic essences of... invisible and intangible being. In contemporary drama a new... ori- entation is crystallizing in which man is shown not in a world into which the divine or demonic powers are projected but alone with them.65 Maura is not "alone" with the "demonic essences" of loss and death. Unlike Becketťs metaphorical figures who appear outside the envelope of realistic space and time, she is surrounded by other characters who share in her loss. Her daughters, Nora and Cathleen, try to shield her from seeing the drowned Michael's shirt and socks washed up by the sea.66 The sole remaining son, Bartley, assures the women - ironically, to be sure - that he will certainly return in four days if not in two or three (87). Nor are Maurya's dead without the comfort of other characters in their grave. As the mother remarks of the now deceased men-folk of numerous neighbors, "There does be a power of young men floating round in the sea" (95). In addition to this gathering of characters who comprise a company of grief, Synge's realism of setting also works to prevent alienation of the audience from the tragic stage. Many young men from the Aran islands off the west of Ireland have become "riders to the sea" who do not re- turn. Maurya's attempt to explain things, although bitterly ironic as logic, adds a semblance of reason to her use of a walking stick brought home by the now dead Michael. "In the big world the old people do be leaving things after them for their sons and children, but in this place it is the young men do be leaving things behind for them that do be old" (89). And the cottage kitchen, although featuring the "white boards" secured for Michael's coffin leaning against the wall, nevertheless holds as well a spinning wheel, a cake in an oven, and a collection of outdoor clothing. Synge's settings are places of life, giving the impression - although, again, weighted with irony - that life as expected goes on, in spite of and be- yond tragedy. Thus, the conventional movement of plot joins with realism of setting and place to situate the audience in a world where nightmare is followed by the familiar light of morning. As Maurya</page><page sequence="22">1 96 Comparative Drama consoles herself after learning that Bartley has indeed joined his five broth- ers in death, "...it's a great rest I'll have now, and it's time surely. Iťs a great rest Г11 have now, and great sleeping in the long nights...." (96). Happy Days is perhaps anthologized more often than any other of Beckett's plays (for instance, in the Norton anthologies). Probably based on the idea (or hope! ) that the surface mundane triviality of Winnie's chatter is more optimistic than darker dialogue in other plays by Beckett, the choice tellingly reveals the difficulty of apprehending Beckett, even by trained aca- demics. The text or enactment of this play is a palimpsest inscribed not only over all of Beckett's writings preceding it but also those that follow. As John Pilling astutely remarks, "It is, strictly speaking, impossible to fully understand a given work of Beckett's without knowing everything ante- cedent and subsequent to it....67 At any rate, Happy Days is not optimistic drama. How best to describe the metaphorical spectacle of Winnie en- trapped in the earth up to her waist in die first act, and up to the neck in the second? Or explain a woman who does nothing throughout the staged performance except to talk to herself, fiddle with the contents of her bag, and strain for any kind of exchange with her husband, who is invisible except for a brief sighting of his upper head and his single frontal appear- ance to the audience? These truncated metaphors of characters relentlessly enact a staged non-performance - a plot that is nothing more than a sec- ond act's diminished repetition of the first - in a setting that is nowhere and yet everywhere, the desert of the earth and of the human conscious- ness. In fact, we can say that Winnie's "expanse of scorched grass" beneath the "Blazing light" of an "unbroken plain and sky" (7) is a personalized piece of Hamm and Clov's desert landscape in Endgame. In Happy Days the desert is restricted to the stage alone, with no exits to an implied out- side, whereas in the earlier play the ruined landscape is an implied exten- sion of theatrical space beyond the stage. Thus, in Happy Days, not only is the envelope or skin of Eva Metman's familiar, actual world gone, but any distance between the figures and the desert place is obliterated as well. Con- fronted with this dramatic space, the audience is alienated not only from the habitual comforts of everyday living but also from its accustomed familiarity with the stage. Beckett's deliberate departure from conventional literary forms, Irish or otherwise, to mirror in the unique metaphor of his own dramatic</page><page sequence="23">Laura Barge 197 form an existence noticeably similar to Synge's perception of living on the earth becomes even more apparent by focusing on three elements in the plays under consideration. The first is the element of language. Synge so exploits the device of symbolic language in Riders that garments or cloth coverings carry the action of the play. The priest brings the shirt and stockings washed up in the sea so that the daughters can decide if they are Michael's (83), in her vision Maurya sees the dead Michael dressed in "fine clothes" and "new shoes" on the gray donkey (92-93), in her memory of Patch's death the women bring the body wrapped in a red sail (94), the dead Bartley is brought in covered with a piece of a sail by women lifting their red petticoats over their faces in grief (95), and the final ritual of despair and resignation by Maurya is her dropping of Michael's retrieved clothes over Bartley 's feet as she sprinkles the holy water and breathes her prayers (96). Thus coverings become not merely segments of a motif but a symbol of the essence of the play. The ordinary fabrics of life become coverings of death: the sea provides Michael a "clean burial," and Bartley's resting in a "deep grave" is inside a "fine coffin out of the white boards" (97). Synge's symbolism has an intensely ironic dimension. Maurya's last question, "What more can we want than that?" and her poignant lament, "No man at all can be living for ever, and we must be satisfied," become parodies of consolation (97). But Winnie's ordinary things - the tooth- brush and paste, the brush, the lipstick, the handkerchief, all in the black bag (8-14) - demonstrate exactly why John Pilling insists that Beckett "rejects unequivocally symbolism"68 and Gordon Armstrong agrees that there "are truly no symbols in a Beckett play until the viewer supplies them."69 Synge's Irish clothing moves expansively beyond the bound- aries of Riders to suggest to all viewers the collective coverings of mourn- ing for all the dead of the earth. But Beckett's black bag, containing also Winnie's revolver, which she plays with but never uses (13, 33, 45), refuses to expand as a symbol and remains merely an image of the col- lection of things that this heroine has on stage. In Beckett's art, human paraphernalia cannot be shaped into some kind of structure that consti- tutes a symbol.70 A second element to examine in Beckett's metamorphosis of a dra- matic style that communicates mimetically to staged forms that present</page><page sequence="24">1 98 Comparative Drama by a negation of verisimilitude is that of time. Time in Riders functions as expected, by situating the audience in the events transpiring on the stage: Michael has been missing for nine days; Bartley must go now be- cause it will be two weeks before another boat leaves the island for the fair, where he hopes to sell the pony (86); and Maurya must hurry to the "spring well" so as to meet Bartley with the roll of bread as he passes by at an anticipated moment (88). It is true that Synge employs expression- istic techniques71 to distort ordinary patterns of time in the scene where Maurya's memory of the women's arrival with Patch's dead body, an event that had occurred many years earlier, is followed immediately by the ac- tuality of other women coming in with the dead body of Bartley (94-95). But as viewers, this particular shifting between the past and the present does not disturb us; no surprise or puzzlement disrupts our learn- ing that Bartley, like Patch, has died at sea. In fact, we easily appreciate Synge's dramatic skill in welding together the mother's grief and respond with empathy to this grief. But as readers or viewers, we are startled and disconcerted by Beckett's metaphorical riddle of time in Happy Days. How and why did Winnie and Willie arrive at their present predicaments? How long have they been imprisoned like this, and what needs to happen to free them, as surely they must be freed, we speculate, if the plot of the drama is to proceed, if we are to have a play? If we have seen other Beckett plays, we are prepared for repetition, but not for the diminishment and slow pacing of Act Two as compared with Act One. In an earlier version of the play, Beckett in- cludes Winnie's use of a tally- stick to record the undifferentiated passing of time,72 but in the published version, we are left more destitute: we must supply our own version of time that does not pass but nevertheless manages to proceed inexorably toward a stasis epitomized in the "Long pause" with which the final curtain descends. Such distortions of mea- surement move us from Winnie's easy designation of "That day" to her puzzled uncertainty "What day?" to her fearful question "What now?" (24). A third and final element is that of memory. Memory torments and mocks not only Maurya but other sufferers in Riders as well. When they realize that all efforts to persuade Bartley not to leave on the ship in the threatening weather are in vain, Nora consoles Cathleen by reminding</page><page sequence="25">Laura Barge 199 her sister of their mother's prayers offered "half through the night" and remembers aloud the young priest's assurance that surely the "Almighty God won't leave her [Maurya] destitute," with "no son living" (84). But the remembrance is not consolation: we know, along with Nora and Cathleen, that such destitution may well occur. And Nora remembers Michael as a "great rower and fisher" who is now reduced to the reclaimed shirt and socks (91). Most dramatic of all is the vivid flashback in which Maurya recollects the occasion of her holding Bartley as a baby on her knees as the women bring into the room Patch's drowned body. Shifting out of memory into a present play within the play, other women for- mally proceed onto the stage to kneel in front, facing the audience with their red petticoats covering their faces. Two others pull a table center stage, and two men lay on it the body of Bartley, resting on a plank and covered with a sail (94-95). As audience, we logically interpret Synge's expressionistic stylistics and recollect painful confrontations with our own memories. Winnie's memories, to the contrary, are confused and confusing to readers or viewers. She recollects sitting on the knees of a Dr. Carolus Hunter whose death notice Willie has found in his paper (15-16). She recollects as well some man - "Shower - or Cooker" - who, along with his wife, once fiercely interrogated her about the strange condition she and Willie share. "What do you mean, he says, God help you?" (42-43). But such memories are fleeting and without apparent significance. The husband and wife become "dim" and then are gone, the "last human kind - to stray this way." That these memories have drifted "up into the mind" is a "[s]trange thing," but, as Winnie remarks, "No, here all is strange" (43-44). A more lyrical reminiscence is Winnie's touching of her hair and remembering a "day, when the last guest was gone" that Willie once offered a toast to the beauty of her "golden" hair. But the memory is so bitter that it renders the recalled event puzzling and dis- tant; her voice breaks as she tries to remember "That day," and Beckett's most critical possibility threatens as she fears that words themselves are beginning to fail (24). A few stage minutes later, Winnie questions the past so impersonally and without visible concern that the questions become disquietingly comic: Was I lovable once, Willie? (Pause.) Was I ever lovable? (Pause.) Do not misunderstand my question, I am not asking you if you loved me, we</page><page sequence="26">200 Comparative Drama know all about that, I am asking you if you found me lovable - at one stage.(Pause. ) No? (Pause.) You can't? (Pause.) Well I admit it is a teaser. (31) Winnie's memory remains a strange object in the play, difficult to appre- hend, impossible to explain. But its value on the stage is without dispute. The audience finds itself in Beckett's "perilous zone" where the "bore- dom of living is replaced by the suffering of being!'73 In Riders to the Sea Synge's characters move through theatrical space that is representational of the actual world, and in Happy Days Beckett's metaphorical figures appear trapped and immobile in a landscape that is obviously only a stage. But the dasein (Heidegger's term for the human condition of rootedness-in-the-world) of both groups is very similar. In exploring similarities between these two dramatists, Alec Reid speaks of a "proximity" that is "established not by subject matter or style... but by a distinctive view of life voiced in a distinctive way."74 IV To proceed further through Beckett's dramatic canon is to encounter plays that challenge any comparison, even in a revisionist mode, with such conventional literary entities as Celtic ideas of nature, Berkeley's philoso- phy, or Synge's realistic dramatic form. These later compositions for stage (Not /through What Where, 1972-1983) meet Lyons' minimalist require- ment that any "theatrical representation of human experience" must "ex- hibit a human figure in space and reveal itself in time,"75 but almost no other expectations of staged performances. Scenery, except for light, con- sists of single objects such as a chair, table, lamp, or part of a bed. Figures other than the speaker are alternate selves, listeners, or interrogators. Most figures are still; some walk and one (in Rockaby) rocks. Dressed in long coats, gowns, and djellabas, these forms lose their human distinctiveness to become geometrical shapes or openings against the backdrop of the stage.76 From this "physical and psychological space" the recitative voice that is the language of the play proceeds.77 What the audience sees, then, is what Martin Esslin terms the "imagistic presentation of visual poetic metaphors,"78 and what it hears is the recitation of a voice. To read or to view performances of these short pieces, however, is to realize the insight of Enoch Brater's insistence that what the audience is actually confronted</page><page sequence="27">Laura Barge 201 with is the "voice of the playwright" The recitation of the performer is not merely language that Beckett's script assigns the actor but Beckett's lan- guage as poetry proceeding from whatever site of consciousness produces it. In Brater's words, "This is not drama in the shape of poetry, but poetry in the shape of drama."79 If, then, Beckett's voice resonates in these pieces, we should expect to find in that recitation philosophical Irish echoes about the human self and its habitat turned upon themselves as discovered in the earlier plays. And these echoes should reflect Synge's sense of the tragic as immedi- ately present in the ordinary stuff of life while simultaneously revealing Beckett's genius in alienating and absorbing an audience by removing the envelope or peeling away the skin of verisimilitude. Not I is a perfor- mance that clearly evinces a reversal of all three of these Irish influences, thus establishing how integral revisionism of Irish influence is to Beckett's dramaturgy as a whole. Beckett has directed his critics to at least three specific sources for this play,80 two of which connect with its visual images. The dominant im- age - the speaking Mouth - appears to the right, about eight feet above stage level, with an invisible microphone, faintly lit, while the rest of this face and figure remains in shadow. The second image, that of the Auditor, is placed downstage left about four feet above stage level. This figure, wear- ing a black djellaba with a hood, is also faintly lit and faces "diagonally across stage intent on MOUTH."81 The image of Mouth, Beckett says, came to him from a viewing of Caravaggio's Decollation of St. John in the Valetta Cathedral in Malta. And the image of Auditor from his viewing of a lone person covered up in a djellaba whom he observed in North Africa. The torrent of confused and fragmented sound that Mouth recites, derives, Beckett says, from his hearing repeatedly in Ireland the language of "many old crones, stumbling down the lanes, in the ditches, beside the hedgerows." The play- wright claims that "I heard 'her' saying what I wrote in Not 1. 1 actually heard it."82 Whatever the accuracy of these referrals (does Beckett himself know precisely whence these images and sounds came?), the Berkeleian perception of Mouth by Auditor is a more significant Irish influence on the play than the remembered voices of aged Irish women. I am not, of course, arguing that Beckett reread Berkeley in the early sixties when this</page><page sequence="28">202 Comparative Drama drama was taking shape in his mind. Instead, my point is that Berkeley's maximum "To be is to be perceived" has by this time become so integral to the playwright's sense of human existence that it undergirds almost any expression of his art. The Auditor apparently audits Mouth's distressful recitation, imperceptibly correcting her at times, listening and watching intently, and, four times, raising his arms in what Beckett's Notes prescribe as a"gesture of helpless compassion" (14). As Knowlson explains, the Au- ditor "supplies the observer or the witness to another's presence and suf- fering that for so long has seemed indispensable to Beckett's stage world."83 But this Gaze, as that of E in Film, confers no selfhood on Mouth: her frantic efforts to transform the third person pronouns "she" and "her" into an authentic first person self by separating the referring and passive pronouns from the defunct "I" of her recited story are defeated from the start. Like those of Beckett's fictional protagonist the Unnamable - another source Beckett has cited for Not Iй - Mouth's pronouns will neither coa- lesce nor separate into authentic personhood. Instead the pronouns col- lapse into each other in anguished non-being. Knowlson goes so far as to speculate that Noti surpasses any other of Beckett's writings in "reproduc- ing the searing screams of human suffering."85 Five times in the surface incoherence of Mouth's recitation, fragments of language refer obscurely to the natural world, to an early April morn- ing in a field where grass is growing, the sun is shining, and larks are singing (15, 17, 21, 22, 23). In three of these passages, the language of delight in the beauty of a natural setting is linked with "God's love," his "tender mercies," and with a being purged or forgiven some misdeed. However, as in All That Fall and as Knowlson notes, these notions of natural beauty offering evidence of divine care "stand in bitterly ironic contrast to the loneliness, distress and anguish of the life sketched in by Mouth." The implication in the recitation is that Mouth is "being pun- ished unjustifiably for the original sin of being born," a perception dat- ing back to Proust in 1931 and remaining a view for which "Beckett has had the greatest sympathy."86 Gordon Armstrong agrees that the dark space in Not I prevails everywhere in Beckett's dramatic world, where "things that give rise to beauty" consistently mislead and disappoint.87 Mouth refers in her monologue to actual experiences of a past life, of being born, of shopping in a supermarket, of going to public places</page><page sequence="29">Laura Barge 203 just to find someone to talk to (15, 18, 22). And immediate suffering, even tragedy, is packed into the disjunctive language of this play in a manner that easily brings to mind Synge's dialogue echoing with its pro- vincial containment of grief. But Beckett's tragi-comic dramatic space is not an island off the west of Ireland, nor do any names of persons appear in the playbill for Not I. In fact, one could argue that the hooded shape and the disconnected-from-even-its-head mouth do not reach the sta- tus of figures but remain nothing more than visual images. And, although Mouth's recitation produces pieces of narrative that can be pieced to- gether into the truncation of a life story, no sentences occur among the fragmented and disjunctive phrases interspersed with screams and si- lences. Beckett has succeeded in finding, what is for him, the proper form for art, a form that acknowledges the chaos of human experience and accommodates or integrates it into the material of the play. Not I sur- passes conventional designations of theatrical art - such as realism, sym- bolism, or expressionism - to become a dramatic poem of visual and auditory images that coalesce into a dense metaphor of whatever the play communicates as performance. Alex Reid observes that both Synge's realism and Beckett's grotesquery "demand" the "emotional involvement" of the audience.88 Garner explains further how Beckett's stripping away of the familiar increases such involvement by effecting alienation of the audience followed by an even more intense immersion in the perfor- mance: "Beckett's late plays violate... the perceptual inclinations and ten- dencies of the spectator as visual processor of theatrical imagery.... As Beckett's characters find themselves increasingly confined... Beckett's audience finds itself involved more deeply in the activities of seeing, en- gaged more fully in the perception of the theatrical image.... Beckett has replaced a theater of activity with a theater of perception...."89 Except for isolated instances, Beckett does not choose to fashion his stage as the land of Ireland nor the characters enacted on this stage as Irish persons. Unlike previous Celtic heroes, Beckett's protagonists do not display any mystically religious kinship with the natural world. In- stead, objects or sounds ornature mock them with vestigial glimpses of some Eden or Paradise that has never been. And we search in vain on this dramatist's stage for any functional all-seeing Eye like Berkeley's whose gaze confers authenticity and unity on the human self. But the space that</page><page sequence="30">204 Comparative Drama is empty of this Paradise and derelict of any benefit from the gaze of such an Eye is, as we have seen, peculiarly Irish, reminding us in particular ways of Synge's rendering of Maurya's grief that she has no son left in the world. Thus Beckett does not merely revolt against or escape from his native culture. Instead, he assimilates particular elements of this heri- tage into his writings in order to radically revise them into the language of his own unique literary vision. As Bruce Arnold, offering tribute on the occasion of Beckett's death in December of 1989, reminds us, "His. . . is an Irish voice deriving from an Irish vision, yet spread across the hu- man dilemma in such powerful and universal terms as to make him a world writer of enduring impact."90 Mississippi State University NOTES 1 Eileen O'Halloran and Susan Schreibman, "Dublin Salutes Beckett," The Beckett Circle: Newsletter of the Samuel Beckett Society 13 (1991): 1. 2 Rodney Sharkey, "Irish?

The protagonist of this book, Molloy, describes this area as "Molloy country," that is, as part of the territory provided for his journey or quest. Though some admire the place, "flocking" to visit its scenery, the "principle beauty of the re- gion" is a "strangled creek" with the "leaden water" of "slow grey tides" that somehow seems "stagnant." Numerous "sacred groves" yield only "inferior turf or scraps of bog oak used for making amulets... rosaries, and other knickknacks. " In spite of heavy rains, the pastures are "exceedingly meagre and strewn with boulders," producing only "quitchweed" and a "bitter blue grass fatal" to animals (134). The burial plot situated in the area has, already set up, the stone to mark Molloy's grave, a monument that is a "simple Latin cross, white" ( 1 35). The strangely admired scenery and the religious relics of this area intensify what is obvious: a journey through its terrain of dubious beauty is toward a place of death. 20 Eyal Amiran, Wandering and Home: Beckett's Metaphysical Narrative (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1993), 78-79,124-25. 21 See my "'Coloured Images' in the 'Black Dark': Samuel Beckett's Later Fiction," PMLA 92 (1977): 281-83 and "An Irish Landscape in Beckett's Fiction," The University of Mississippi Stud- ies in English 1 1-12 (1993-95), 30-31. 22 Samuel Beckett, Three Novels, 277.</page><page sequence="32">206 Comparative Drama 23 Samuel Beckett, Waiting for Godot: A Tragicomedy in Two Acts (New York: Grove, 1954), 42b.

Morot-Sir et al., North Carolina Studies in the Romance Languages and Literatures, no. 5 (Chapel Hill, University of North Carolina Press, 1976), 91-96. Morot-Sir claims that Beckett refuses to assign any allegorical function to language. A word as verbal image is just that - it refers only to itself as language and thus exhibits a fixed duality between itself as used language and any "meaning" it might be thought to have as symbol. Morot-Sir uses the designation emblem for such a verbal image. When I describe the tree in Waiting for Godot as a metaphor, I am describing it as a verbal (in the script, dramatic on the stage) image (or, to use Morot-Sir 's term, emblem) that signals the infinite deferral or regression of what that image as a symbol would traditionally mean. A question not yet addressed in the criticism, but very rel- evant to this article, is whether or not Beckett, in spite of his literary scorn of symbols, can be said to use ironic symbols. I would argue that whereas the tree is a metaphorical image or em- blem for the specific symbolic content that it fails to communicate in Godot, the descriptions of nature or the natural landscape as they occur everywhere in Beckett's oeuvre enlarge and expand to the status of a failed or ironic symbol. 25 Mary Junker-Brennan, 48-49. 26 Samuel Beckett, Endgame: A Play by Samuel Beckett (New York: Grove, 1958), 27-32, 44.

Knowlson, in Damned to Fame (365, 367, 388, 500), relates that Beckett greatly enjoyed and nurtured the land where he built his cottage at Ussy. He cared for the birds and took great pains to plant and grow trees on the property. He also fell out with the municipal council when its members refused to sell him a second plot of land (that bordered his own) and instead sold it to someone who built a hunting lodge that obstructed his view of the surround- ing woodlands. In 1969 he became apprehensive about a highway to be built through the Ussy- sur-Marne valley. Convinced that it would "spoil all the country round," he was greatly relieved</page><page sequence="33">Laura Barge 207 when these plans were delayed. As for the Old Testament, the Levitical law directs six years of sowing and reaping a field and a seventh during which the land must experience a "sabbath rest," a year when any cultivation or harvesting, except for immediate consumption, is forbid- den (Leviticus 25:1-7). Interestingly, by this later stage in Jewish history, the Old Testament does connect the life-style "sins" of the Israelites with a "corruption" of the land. Their "impure" practices have "polluted" the land (Ezra 9: 10 - 12). 33Knowlson, Damned to Fame, 31. 34 John Pilling, Samuel Beckett (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1976), 118-19. 35Knowlson, Damned to Fame. 401-04. 36 Ibid., 387. 37 Pilling, Samuel Beckett, 77. 38 For a comprehensive explication of the idea of God in Becketťs fiction, see my book God, the Quest, the Hero: Thematic Structures in Becketťs Fiction , Studies in the Romance Languages and Literatures, no. 230 (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1988). 39 Samuel Beckett, All That Fall: A Play for Radio, in Krapp's Last Tape and Other Dramatic Pieces (New York: Grove, 1960), 37-44, 83-88, passim.

Originally used to desig- nate art that is not impressionistic (a technique in painting that portrays objects of the exterior world as visually received), but expressive of an inner perceptive awareness, an emotion, or state of being, expressionism as a distinct dramatic movement flourished in post World War I Ger- many. The techniques of this movement, however, were anticipated earlier by Strindberg's inno- vative merging of symbolic, allegorical, and fantastic elements into his realistic drama. The ex- pressionistic techniques in Riders to the Sea (1904) demonstrate an aesthetic response by Synge that can be compared with that of Strindberg in, for instance, A Dream Play (1902) and with Yeats' non-realistic structuring of Gaelic history and Irish nationalism in his Symbolist drama. 72Knowlson, Frescoes, 94 and 109, note 2. 73 Beckett, Proust, 19. 74 Reid, 82-83. 75 Charles R.
