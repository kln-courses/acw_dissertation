It is inconceivable to peruse any pages of his works, without detecting quotations, or latent references, to various dialogues within the Platonic corpus. Yet not only are Platonic influences revealed but the impact of Aristotelic and Stoic influences disclose their presence while deeper probing of Philo's writings expose rudiments of Epicurean, peripatetic as well as skeptic thought, reaching Philo through the literature of the Late Academy and Pyrrhonists. This article analyzes one of the many components of the Philonic works, namely the Neopythagoreanism particularly expressed in Philo's De Opificio Mundi in his description of the days of the world's creation. Without doubt the influence of the Neopythagorean movement — beginning in Rome (preceding the christian era by about sixty years) with Cicero's friend, Nigidius Figulus, who strived to place Pythagoreanism at the focal point of attention of Roman high society and of which Philo made much use — led Clement of Alexandria to call Philo 'the Pythagorean'. In order to explain the use which Philo makes of Pythagorean arithmetic, reaching him via Plato's Timaeus in his description of the creation, the article opens by explaining the importance of the order of creation. Understanding the perfect order of creation described by the six days in which the world was created, necessary in order to estimate the philosophical-metaphysical-theological significance attributed by Philo to the numbers one to seven related to the creation. Following the discussion of the order of the world the article considers the particular status of the very first day and of the following days of creation.</page><page sequence="2">VI Summaries Joseph Isaac Lifshitz OVANTA DELIBA AND INFINITY: ON THE TENSION BETWEEN THE SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE PERCEPTION OF GOD One of the difficulties facing a man of faith, who believes in a transcendent God, is the difficulty of having an existential and intellectual relationship with a transcendent existence. This difficulty created several sorts of perception of God in many religions, and it is even more prominent in Judaism. The early Jewish sources are filled with plays-on-words which refer to God as the infinite, the sublime, or the transcendent, on one hand, and depict him as a wise man or as a warrior on the other. This two-fold concept of God, the transcendent and the eminent, created the solution of the subjective and objective perception of God. The subjective God is the one that is described as anthropomorphic, and the objective God is described as transcendent. The aim of this paper is to show that despite the division between the subjective and objective perception of God, they both perform together in order to create the very specific phenomenon that is called the religious experience. While surveying the tradition of the division between the subjective and objective perception of God, from the High Middle Ages to the nineteenth century, I contend that the two perceptions are intertwined, and that they are both necessary for the perception of a mysterious and loving God. Abraham Melamed "OF MAKING MANY BOOKS THERE IS NOT END" (ECCLESIASTES 12:12) FROM PROHIBITION TO LEGITIMATING The accumulated interpretations of this verse throughout the history of Jewish thought is one of many microcosmic illustrations of how creative generations of commentators could be in dealing with biblical verses, interpreting them to serve their needs and to legitimize their own views just as of these were divine revelations. The extensive body of commentary on this particular verse is central to the long-enduring argument over justification for writing and studying texts outside the recognized 24 canonical books, and had widespread influence on</page><page sequence="3">Summaries VII the acceptability of what are variously called 'external' or 'Greek' or 'general' studies. While the normative midrashic commentary opposes writing about or studying works outside the canon in no uncertain terms, later scholars rejected the prohibition and did not hesitate to give the words of Ecclesiastes an entirely opposite significance. In fact, the body of commentary carries us from midrashic prohibitions against, to philosophical justification of writing about and studying these same extra-canonical works. This corpus, then, is an excellent illustration of the great historical confrontation between scholars who justified studying general knowledge and those who opposed it, beginning with midrashic literature and concluding with Jewish thought from late medieval to early modern times. The fact that the same text could be expounded in diametrically opposite ways — one forbidding and the other justifying — shows not only how flexible biblical commentary can be, but also the extraordinary ingenuity of the commentators seeking theological legitimacy for their own intellectual interest. Saul Regev STUDIES IN THE RELIGIOUS PHILOSOPHICAL WRITINGS OF R. SHLOMO ALMOLI Almoli's writings take two different paths that converge, integrate and complement each other. One path is a summary of the sciences and philosophical studies, while the other is the dissemination of true knowledge that, in his opinion, can speed up the redemption. Both paths complement each other. In his opinion, the most important area of study is mysticism, which when revealed and taught will bring redemption. Learning Kabbalah learning the secret that he thought was the last and necessary stage of intellectual pursuit. The nation's goal is to arrive at the point in which the masses are literate in the secrets of the Torah so that all of them are at the same level as the prophets. It is important to teach and clarify the idea of the dream, as it is an inseparable part of prophecy. The people must leam to understand the prophetic dream and differentiate it from the simple dream. This perception of the relationship between education and redemption is extraordinary in Almoli's time. What is known from his time are astrological or Kabbalistic-messianic configurations of the redemption. These perceptions dealt with national-political messianism. According to Almoli, political processes are not necessary rather the entire process is contingent upon the person himself as</page><page sequence="4">VIII Summaries an individual and the public as a society. Man has received the tools, but he must discover and use them. Exile is a punishment, because it forces the people of Israel to deal with materialism and prevents them from spirituality. Redemption, therefore, is a return to spirituality. Avinoam Rosenak WAR AND PEACE IN JEWISH THOUGHT IN THE FACE OF THE 'OTHER' Jewish sources manifest complex view toward the conepts of peace and war. In the analysis that follows, I shall show that the struggles of contemporary Jewish thinkers regarding war and peace give rise to a discussion of religious and national identity. Jewish thinkers have thus transformed the clarification of those terms into a factor highlighting Judaism's characteristics vis-ä-vis those of other religions and nations. In that sense, this discussion becomes a new framework within which the Jewish nation's self-consciousness can be elucidated. I will illustrate the point through four figures who may be seen as paradigmatic: Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook (1865-1935), Rabbi Moses Avigdor Amiel (1883-1946), Rabbi Abraham Hazan (1920-2003), arid Rabbi Eliezer Berkovits (1908-1992). These individuals represent differing, sometimes opposing, worldviews and cultural backgrounds (Ashkenazi Jewry versus Sefaradi; Kabbalah and Hasidisim versus "Lithuanian" rationalism; Eastern European versus Western); their theological thinkings is sensitive to their historical experiences; and they present the matters at issue here in comparable terms. Tsippi Kauffman AVODAH BeGASHMIYUT IN HASIDIC THOUGHT The Paper discusses the issue of worshiping God through corporeality (Avodah BeGashmiyut) in Hasidic thought. This type of religious behavior, which constitutes an extension of the normative religious demands, is known in the teachings of the Baal Shem Tov and his disciples, and is well known to scholars too. Nevertheless,</page><page sequence="5">Summaries IX it seems that no one has ever asked himself seriously, while using the term Avodah BeGashmiyut, what are the exact deeds that are included under this title, what are the criteria for separating one way of corporeal worship from another, etc. The present article gives a typology of this term by introducing Models of Avodah BeGashmiyut in the thought of the Baal Shem Tov, along with R. Jacob Joseph of Polonnoye, R. Dov Baer, the Maggid of Mezhirech and other Hasidic masters. These models deal for example with the following topics: Corporeal worship post factum, Corporeal worship as a preparation for the "real" worship, the mitzvoth, Corporeal worship as ritual (with the same status as mitzvoth), Corporeal worship as having a higher status than mitzvoth. The careful analysis of this well known term can be a useful tool for future discussions in the study of Hasidism.</page></plain_text>
