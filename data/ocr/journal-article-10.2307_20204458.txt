<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMY D. BROEMMEL KRISTIN T. REARDEN Should teachers use the Teachers' Choices books in science classes? This study indicates that the Teachers' Choices booklist is a helpful resource for choosing quality science-based books. Every year since 1989, the Teachers' Choices project, a joint effort of the International Reading Association (IRA) and the Children's Book Council (CBC), has identified books that "reflect high literary quality in style, content, structure, beauty of language, and presen tation; might not be discovered or fully appreciated by children without introduction by a knowledge able educator; and have the potential for use across the curriculum" (IRA, 2003, p. 271). In an annual effort "to help teachers find books that can be used across the curriculum" (IRA, 2005), the Teachers' Choices project gives over 300 new books to teams comprised of teachers, reading specialists, and li brarians in seven regions across the United States. These practitioners use the books with students and provide regional coordinators with their reviews. Results from all seven regions are combined, pro ducing an annotated list comprised of approxi mately 30 books, diverse in both genre and topic, and categorized by age group. The Teachers' Choices booklist is useful for identifying excellent books for classroom use, and because it is generat ed by teachers and based on their collective pref erences, it has the potential to greatly influence which trade books are found in classrooms across the United States. Also well known is that the use of trade books in elementary classrooms has many benefits, in cluding students' adoption of language they hear and read (Ouzts, Taylor, &amp; Taylor, 2003), increased knowledge of the world (Galda, Ash, &amp; Cullinan, 2001), and exposure to the positive portrayals of women and minorities (Rice, 2002). When teachers use high-quality trade books to support science instruction, these benefits can be observed in the students' learning. Morrow, Pressley, Smith, and Smith (1997) found that students assigned to a classroom using a literature-based program inte grated with literacy and science instruction scored significantly higher on all literacy measures and on two of three science measures than either a literature-only group or a control group. The stu dents not only performed better but also expressed their enthusiasm for the program. Approximately 80% of those who used the integrated science and literacy program claimed that they liked science, as opposed to approximately 40% in the other two groups. Using literature in science can increase stu dent motivation by allowing students more oppor tunities to connect science concepts with their own literary experiences (Casteel &amp; Isom, 1994). While the integration of science and trade books is increasing in popularity (Rice, 2002), it is often a challenge to select books that are appropri ate for both the language arts and science. Teachers have received little guidance when choosing trade books to enhance science instruction (Donovan &amp; Smolkin, 2002). The science requirement for pre service elementary teachers is generally "no more than two science courses" (L. Bethel, as cited in Royce &amp; Wiley, 1996, p. 18), providing little time to learn both content and methodology. Practicing teachers do not have time to sift through all of the trade books available on a given topic (Sudol &amp; King, 1996). So, then, where can teachers find high-quality science trade books to integrate into their lessons? Lists are available online, in books, and from 254 ? 2006 International Reading Association (pp. 254-265) doi:10.1598/RT.60.3.5</page><page sequence="2">professional teaching organizations. However, many of these online lists offer little information as to how the books were chosen and some fail to identify their source. We do not believe it is appro priate for teachers to use booklists from sources with which they are unfamiliar. The Teachers' Choices booklist, published each year in The Reading Teacher, which has a circulation of more than 50,000, has a high visibility that makes it a source to which many teachers will turn. The fact that this list is generated by teachers, primarily for teachers, is part of what makes it so meaningful for classroom use; however, that could also be its downfall. Teachers select these books based on their personal preferences, not by any pre determined criteria. If teachers are using this list to find books that support their curriculum, are the books truly high quality? This becomes a major concern, especially in science?an area where ap propriate and accurate content is critical and in which many teachers report feeling intimidated (Gallas, 1995). With this in mind, we undertook an in-depth examination of the Teachers' Choices booklist in an attempt to determine the quality of the science-related picture books that have ap peared on the list since its inception. Methods for analyzing the Teachers' Choices books Based on the annotations from the 1989-2004 lists, we targeted 99 science-based picture books for analysis of science content. After the initial identification process we attempted to obtain any books not owned by either of us by searching a metropolitan county library system with a general circulation of over 2 million, including approxi mately 350,000 juvenile titles. If neither the main library nor any of the 17 branch libraries owned the book, we considered the book "unavailable for re view." Of the 99 books targeted, 12 were unavail able for review, and an additional 13, once examined, did not have science content for analy sis. A total of 74 Teachers' Choices picture books were collected and analyzed for content, visual fea tures, and genre, which have been identified as key categories for the selection of science books (Donovan &amp; Smolkin, 2002). Analysis and results Science content The use of nationally recognized standards for developmentally appropriate science content, such as the National Research Council's (1996) National Science Education Standards (NSES) can provide guidance for determining the suitability of a trade book's science content. The Science Content Standards of the NSES outline what stu dents should know, understand, and be able to do in natural science (p. 103) in grades K-4, 5-8, and 9-12. They were designed to be appropriate for stu dents' ages and stages of development, particular ly in the movement of students from concrete to abstract understandings. We began our analysis by classifying each of the 74 reviewed books using the NSES as the benchmark for identifying develop mentally appropriate concepts. Our process for documenting the accuracy of the science content of the books was twofold. First, because one of us is a science educator with teaching experience at both the K-12 and university levels, we felt that a de tailed reading would provide a certain level of in sight to a given book's accuracy. To further document accuracy, each book also was reviewed by comparing overall content and specific concepts with the NSES content standards. We believe it is important to note that we did not go so far as to ver ify specific highly specialized facts (e.g., numeri cal-based facts about animals, dates of inventions) through a second source. Upon verifying the accuracy of the selected books, we compared the concepts and vocabulary in each book to those in the NSES, and classified the grade-level appropriateness of the science con tent of each book in the following manner: K-4, 5-8, 3-8, and K-8. The grade-level classifications for the Teachers' Choices vary slightly from the NSES grade-level categories, and therefore a hybrid of the two classification systems was used. We then identified each book's corresponding NSES content area. A total of eight content areas are addressed by the NSES, including Life Science, Earth and Space Science, and History and Nature of Science. Each of these contains subcategories; for example, Life Cycles is a component of Life Science. We compared each book's theme with the subcategories of the NSES content area to classify Should teachers use the Teachers' Choices books in science classes? 255</page><page sequence="3">TABLE 1 NSES content areas and corresponding Teachers' Choices book themes NSES science content areas Book topics/themes Earth and space science History and nature of science Life science Physical science Science and technology Science as inquiry Science in personal and social perspectives Geologic time Natural disasters Weather and climate Inventors Characteristics of organisms Life cycles Organism habitats Energy Properties of matter Applications of scientific advances Problem solving Personal conquests Societal impacts of scientific advances the science content. (See Table 1 for a list of NSES content areas and corresponding book themes.) Some books were classified for science content but were identified as also containing some aspects of fantasy (e.g., the anthropomorphic portrayal of animals) or cultural perspectives of science. Books that contain fantasy components in addition to sci ence content must be used in a manner that explic itly presents to students what is allegorical and what is factual. In some cases, such as Cherry's (1990) The Great Kapok Tree, animals whisper into the dreaming man's ear; teachers would need to discuss the fantasy aspects versus the science as pects to clarify the difference. Books from Cole's Magic School Bus series contain fantasy elements; however, a distinction between fantasy and reality portions is typically made through a question-and answer section at the end of each book, and the sidebar text contains factual science content. Other books, like Thirteen Moons on Turtle's Back (Bruchac &amp; London, 1992), contain explanations of scientific phenomena from ancient cultures. Those descriptions could be discussed in the con text of a historical perspective of the development of the understanding of the phenomena. The majority of the reviewed books contained material that could be used to support instruction in life science, but only two books contained content related to physical science. Although this is cer tainly not optimal, it is not unusual. Results of a science trade book analysis by Ford (2004) from a more varied pool of possible book choices yielded a similar lack of physical science-based books for use in the elementary classroom. Most books did not specifically portray science as an inquiry en deavor and instead were more information based. In some cases, more than one content area was ad dressed, and therefore more than one appropriate area was identified. In particular, 56 of the 74 books contained content related to life science. Science in personal and social perspectives was portrayed in 10 books, and 11 books dealt with earth and space science. The history and nature of science was expressed in five books, and three books dealt with the topic of science as inquiry. Concepts related to physical science and to tech nology were each addressed in two books. (See Table 2 for the full list of reviewed books and their categorization.) Visual features Visual features are a second area of considera tion when selecting a high-quality picture book for science instruction (Donovan &amp; Smolkin, 2002). These features may include differentiated text, il lustrations, graphs, tables, or other nontext items and have often been considered in discussion of evaluating nonfiction books (Cullinan &amp; Galda, 256 The Reading Teacher Vol. 60, No. 3 November 2006</page><page sequence="4">TABLE 2 Teachers' Choices books (1989*2004) pertaining to science Title Genre Science content Visual features All the Places to Love S Amazon Alphabet NNI Animals, Animals P Animals Nobody Loves NNI Are Trees Alive?

In today's visually oriented socie ty, books must possess more than interesting and factual text; the visual features are often the "hook" that motivates a child to pick up a book and begin reading. Specific features to note include suitable use of media, quality captions and labels, function ality of illustrations for extending text, and the overall look, or format, of the book (Huck et al.). In general, visual features should enhance the text, aid understanding, and stimulate interest (Norton). We found that the media chosen for the science related Teachers' Choices books clearly support and extend the text. Illustrations ranging from watercolors to collage are employed more often in these books than photographs, which account for the chosen media in less than one-third of the books. There appear to be two primary purposes for the illustrations, often depending on the genre of the book. Most books classified as "story" use full-page illustrations to bring the reader more deeply into the plot. However, other genre classifi cations often use visual representations, diagrams, or "up close" drawings to give more detail and more information than the text can on its own. Unfortunately, those books that do use photos do not always employ captions and the reader is often left to make the connection to the text independ ently. Even if that connection may not be difficult for a teacher to make, students reading the book independently may be affected to some degree. Of the books we analyzed, only a few employ cap tions, but those that do use them effectively. Martin's (1994) Hiding Out: Camouflage in the Wild is an excellent example of a book with effec tive captioning. Fewer books make use of visual features be yond illustrations or photographs. The most often used visual feature is differentiated text, varying in size and font, or in italics and boldface type. The Emperor's Egg (Jenkins, 1999) uses two levels of text, one providing more detailed information than the other. In contrast, DuQuette (2002) uses sim ple text with boldfaced animal names to focus read ers in They Call Me Woolly: What Animal Names Can Tell Us. Labels also are common, often used with both photographs and drawings. Old favorites like Ehlert's (1990) Feathers for Lunch and newer ones like Collard's (2000) The Forest in the Clouds make effective use of labeled illustrations, provid 260 The Reading Teacher Vol. 60, No. 3 November 2006</page><page sequence="8">ing visual cues for understanding specialized vo cabulary that might be unfamiliar to young readers. Charts and tables are used sparingly, except in books like Cole's (1989) The Magic School Bus: Inside the Human Body, and only one book, Tiger Math: Learning to Graph from a Baby Tiger (Nagada &amp; Bickel, 2000), made significant use of graphs as a means of presenting information. While some beginning readers may find these types of features hard to navigate, they may stimulate in terest in older readers. As we reviewed the books, we noticed that those with more recent publication dates generally ap peared to use a wider variety of visual features. Sidebars, timelines, labels, maps, and varied size and layout of text grab children's attention. Seeing Stars (Muirden, 1998) stands out as a book that includes multiple versions of varied text integrated fully with in the manuscript, numbered chunks of information in sidebars, and a true-or-false quiz on each page. Although it appears somewhat overwhelming at first glance, further investigation shows that this and oth er books often have multiple layers of information that do not have to be read in a single sitting. The ap pearance of these types of text may be reflections of teachers' understanding of the attention-related de mands of their students?children who have grown up in our increasingly visual society. Genre Donovan and Smolkin (2002) identified four genres associated with science-related books and suggested that genre is important despite the fact that it is not often associated with the selection of high-quality science books. Each of the four genres?storybooks (S), nonnarrative information books (NNI), narrative information books (NI), and dual-purpose books (DP)?can be identified by specific characteristics, and research supports the use of each in science instruction, although in vary ing degrees. Storybooks are easily identified by their plot lines, following characters' actions over time. These books typically include science within the context of the story, but their primary purpose is to enter tain. Lake (1993) suggested that storybooks are most effectively used to create a love of science, and McClure and Zitlow (1991) reinforced that idea, indicating that storybooks help alleviate the mean BIBLIOGRAPHY OF CHILDREN'S BOOKS (continued) Knight, L.

Should teachers use the Teachers ' Choices books in science classes ? 261</page><page sequence="9">ingless dispensing of facts. Cherry's (2003) How Groundhog's Garden Grew is a good example of a storybook with applicable science content. Its pri mary focus is to tell the story of a naughty ground hog who gets in trouble for stealing from his friends' gardens. Luckily, his friend Squirrel takes Groundhog under his wing, and teaches him how to cultivate and care for his own garden. Narrative information books are distinguish able from nonnarrative information books mainly by the way they relate information. Narrative infor mation books present factual events over time, while their nonnarrative counterparts use a hier archical format of topics and subtopics. Thus, One Tiny Turtle (Davies, 2001) would be considered narrative information because it follows the life of a Loggerhead turtle, but Beaks! (Collard, 2002) would be nonnarrative information because it pres ents information about a number of different birds and how they use their beaks. Informational books of either sort usually have been viewed as too hard or too complex for elementary-level students, leav ing those students with far fewer experiences with these books than with storybooks (Donovan &amp; Smolkin, 2002). However, research indicates that children of this age do enjoy information books, and that these types of books can help build the language children need to further understand scientific vocabulary and concepts (Duke, Bennett Armistead, &amp; Roberts, 2003; Elley, 1989). Dual-purpose books are those books that are intended to present both a story and information (Donovan &amp; Smolkin, 2002). The story shares the spotlight with information, often presented in side bars or other visual displays. The story must be read from beginning to end, but the information can be accessed at any point and used independently. Joanna Cole's Magic School Bus series is one such example. Leal (1992) found that after reading this type of book to elementary-level students, they re tained more information than they had after either a storybook or an information book; however, teach ers may want to be cautious in their use of this genre because other studies have had mixed results (Donovan &amp; Smolkin). We included a fifth category in our analysis: poetry. A number of science-related books of po etry were included on the Teachers' Choices lists, and we decided that because different poems with in the same book may fall into different genres, these books warranted a separate category. While each of the five genres was represented among the reviewed Teachers' Choices books, the majority focuses on imparting factual information through informational text. Only 14 of the 74 books?less than 20%?were classified as stories; one additional book, Everglades (George, 1995), begins with strong elements of story, but was not in cluded in the total because most of the text demon strated elements of the narrative information genre. Our analysis indicated there has been a noticeable trend away from the selection of science-related storybooks since the beginning of the Teachers' Choices project; only four of the identified story books have been selected in the past 10 years. The information genres make up the majority of the selected books. Twenty-five books fall into the nonnarrative information category and 24 are consid ered to be narrative information. While both genres have been selected with increased frequency over time, nonnarrative information books have been se lected with much more frequency in recent years. Eleven of the 25 nonnarrative books have made the list between 2000 and 2004, making it the most often-selected genre during this time period. Because this list is generated by teachers, the in creased selection of information books is likely re lated to a rising awareness of the discrepancy between use of literature and informational texts in the elementary grades and a call for increased use of nonfiction texts in classrooms (Bamford, Kristo, &amp; Lyon, 2002). The remaining 10 books are divided primarily into the poetry and dual-purpose genres. Six books are dedicated to poetry, ranging in both topic and arrangement. Three focus on birds and animals, two focus on geographic areas, and one focuses on sea sons in the Native American culture. Two books, Forest of Dreams (Wells, 1988) and Around One Cactus: Owls, Bats and Leaping Rats (Fredericks, 2003), are told in rhyming verse but were categorized in other genres?story and nonnar rative information, respectively. Four books are made up of a collection of poems, while two of the books are single, illustrated poems in book format. Three books are classified as dual purpose, because they tell a self-contained story and provide additional infor mation related to, but separate from, the story. One of these books is from Cole's Magic School Bus series, 262 The Reading Teacher Vol. 60, No. 3 November 2006</page><page sequence="10">and the second is Ehlert's (1990) Feathers for Lunch. Cone's (1992) Come Back, Salmon, is the third, and is discussed in detail in the next section. The last book, The Big Book for Our Planet (Durell, George, &amp; Paterson, 1993), is a compilation of stories, poetry, and informational text. Therefore, we did not place it in any single category. Selected books for discussion We have chosen three high-quality science pic ture books that have appeared on the Teachers' Choices list for an in-depth analysis of content, visual features, and genre. These books offer not only a unique approach to science content, but pro vide examples of a variety of visual features and represent different genres. We also considered grade-level appropriateness, and chose a book from four categories: K-4, 5-8, 3-8, and K-8. Around One Cactus: Owls, Bats and Leaping Rats (Fredericks, 2003), appropriate for a K-4 au dience, was selected for its vivid portrayals of noc turnal desert animals and its unusual text presentation. This nonnarrative information book is told in simple and repetitive rhyming verse, build ing in cumulative style and providing an impressive amount of additional information documenting the diverse characteristics of animals that live in and around the saguaro cactus. The deep colors of the full-page illustrations help to draw children into the somewhat mysterious nighttime desert world. The NSES Life Science content standard correlated with this book pertains to organisms and their en vironment; specifically, "an organism's patterns of behavior are related to the nature of that organism's environment, including the kinds and numbers of other organisms present, the availability of food and resources, and the physical characteristics of the environment" (National Research Council, 1996, p. 129) Fredericks does a solid job of sup porting this by providing "field notes" at the end of the book, highlighting each of the living things depicted in the text. In addition, he provides the names of books and organizations that can offer further information on desert ecosystems. This is a perfect read-aloud book for young children study ing desert habitats and is a great read-alone for those in grades 2 and up who are interested in desert life. Come Back, Salmon (Cone, 1992) represents one of the few books containing content pertain ing to life science, science in personal and social perspectives, and science as inquiry. Even though it is considerably older than the other two books de tailed in this section, it is relevant to today's class rooms. This dual-purpose book, appropriate particularly for grades 5-8, gives an account of fifth-grade students who took on the challenge of cleaning up a local creek after recognizing that it no longer was hospitable for the salmon that used to spawn there. The students not only spearheaded an effort to clear the trash from the creek but also raised salmon eggs to release into the creek in hopes that grown salmon would return to spawn. Occasional sidebars provide general information about salmon, and photos and drawings of the salmon life cycle are included with the descriptions of how students raised and cared for the salmon eggs and young salmon. The students' progress is documented through numerous photographs, and their perseverance is rewarded when, two years af ter releasing the first batch of young salmon, the adults began to return to the creek where they had not been seen for more than 20 years. Come Back, Salmon is a triumphant story that demonstrates the wealth of learning opportunities present when stu dents engage in long-term investigations, particu larly when those investigations pertain to relevant, real-life situations. Teachers could use this story to illustrate an example of an organism's life cycle and to assist students with recognizing the power of working together to improve the environment. Furthermore, this book could be used as an exam ple of the components of an inquiry project as pre sented in the NSES, because the students described posed a question, gained background information, conducted the investigation, obtained and analyzed results, and communicated their findings. The Beauty of the Beast is an example of a book appropriate for K-8 science classes. Compiled by Prelutsky (1997), this poetry book contains works about arthropods, fish, birds, reptiles, and mammals. These poems are beautifully complemented by the brilliant watercolor illustrations interspersed through out. Some of the poems discuss animal characteris tics, such as "Oh, to be an earthworm/It has five hearts" (p. 12) and "A spider doesn't fly/but walks off the edge of a beam/and waits for a bump/where all eight feet will feel firm/dirt again" (p. 14). Other po Should teachers use the Teachers' Choices books in science classes? 263</page><page sequence="11">ems provide vivid descriptions of characteristics of animals, such as "The feel/Of an eel/Is slippery,/Slimy;/He's sleek/And he's black/As a pan ther/At night" (p. 20). The content and vocabulary of the poems render them appropriate for certain grade levels. For example, "Snake" would be appropriate for older students: "I, the reptilian/serpentine, jewel eyed/golden-scaled, spiraling/splendor of Snake,/I, in the shallows of/Nigers and Amazons,/I dream of Death/when I sleep, when I wake" (p. 20) whereas "Fish" would be appropriate for providing a descrip tion of fish movement for the very young: "Look at themflit/Lickety-sphtAVigghng/Swiggling/Swerving/ Curving" (p. 17). Many teachers conduct owl pellet investigations, and there are several poems with in formation about owl characteristics. For example, "Cleaning" could be read to students after they have identified an owl pellet's contents and could lead to a discussion of the food web as well as the owl's mode of eating and digestion: "The owl has vacu umed/the wood again,/leaving two gray nubs/of dust again;/bone of shrew, mole, and bat,/rolled in their own/coughed-up fur" (p. 42). Integrating poetry with science can inspire students to create their own sci entifically accurate poems about animals, thus pro viding an alternative method for assessing content knowledge. Used in conjunction with direct observa tions of animals and other sources of information about animal characteristics, these poems can enrich the students' learning experience in life science. Implications Our analysis of the Teachers' Choices books indicates that teaching professionals involved in this project are indeed identifying quality science related children's books. None of the books con tained inaccurate science content, although a handful of storybooks did contain some allusions to fantasy elements (such as talking animals). Only a select few contained information deemed inap propriate for the intended grade level, and it is im portant to note that even these few books contained accurate science content and engaging visual fea tures that would certainly be well used at a differ ent, higher grade level. The Teachers' Choices list is a resource that is already familiar to many teachers. Our analysis from a science standpoint indicates that it is a unique list in that it identifies trade books of both high literary quality and accurate and appropriate science content. While there are undoubtedly other high-quality science picture books that could be used in the classroom, this list provides teachers with a rich and readily available resource for identi fying quality literature, thereby sparing them from the potentially time-consuming effort of having to select appropriate books. In particular, there is a wealth of Teachers' Choices books to support in struction in life science. These books can be implemented not only as sources of reading material but also for interdisci plinary instruction. With the heavy emphasis on reading at the primary and intermediate levels and the limited amount of class time, the use of inter disciplinary instruction for science provides a venue for teachers to address more than one subject in a holistic fashion. These books easily can be used for introducing, reviewing, and enriching sci ence content knowledge. Teachers should feel con fident in choosing Teachers' Choices books to link science and reading in an interesting, meaningful, and developmentally appropriate manner; their col leagues have chosen well.
