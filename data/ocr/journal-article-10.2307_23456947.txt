<plain_text><page sequence="1">VARIA An Anthropomorphic Figurine from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A Site at Gilgal Tamar Noy (pp. 155-156) The figurine (Fig. 1) was discovered on the floor of one of the round structures excavated at the site. It is made of hard limestone, and is 71 mm long, 27 mm wide and 12 mm thick. The schematic portrait emphasizes the hips, and the legs are apparently indicated by a deep incision in the lower part of the figure.-Traces of paint observed on the otherwise undifferen tiated head indicate the eyes, and a series of short incisions along the front of the figurine may have been intended to portray a garment - perhaps a grass or string skirt. In its schematic character, the figurine falls into the category of PPNA figurines known from Netiv Hagdud,3 Jericho,4 and El-Khiam.5 The garment is of particular inter est, as the only other evidence for prehistoric perishables comes from the PPNB finds of Nahal Hemar,6 some 1000 years later than Gilgal, and possibly from a clay figurine from Jericho.7</page></plain_text>
