<plain_text><page sequence="1">Clayton, Philip. The Problem of God in Modern Thought. Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 2000. xv + 516 pp. Cloth, $40.00?Philip Clayton's newest book investigates the historical ante cedents of panentheism. Clayton's aim, however, is more than a histori cal investigation into the problem of God from Descartes to Schelling. "This book is published not (just) with the goal of winning support for one particular set of conclusions, but equally with the hope of bringing various groups of experts back into dialogue with one another" (p. xiii). The book is divided into three parts. Part 1 opens against the present backdrop of pluralism and skepticism (p. 6). Though Clayton accepts that Putnam, Rorty, Bennett, Derrida, and other current students of Kant have effectively laid to rest the "time-transcendent philosophies" (p. 8) of the past, he is not prepared to accede to extreme pluralism and its attendant relativism. Rather, he opts for "soft" pluralism, which avoids both "full metaphoricity and the univocity of a single established theory" (p. 16) and argues that the very multiplicity of models of God constitutes a drive toward the unity of conceptual expression. "Models</page><page sequence="2">SUMMARIES AND COMMENTS 909 begin as a heuristic aid for thought in a complicated area; they simplify, organize, and guide our reflection. . . . [I]n their claim to approximate the truth, they give rise to theory, namely the attempt to say precisely where the model is correct and where its limitations lie" (pp. 16-17). Clayton judges a model as "correct" or "limited" via a coherence the ory of truth that not only includes the notions of logical consistency, comprehensiveness, and usefulness, but is broad enough to include cor respondence, though this last notion is "parsed as the coherence of the ory-terms with observation-terms" (p. 32). Specifically, one accepts or defends conceptions of God "as models that must make good on the claim to be the best available explanation" (p. 425). Thus, neither "cul turally blind absolutism" of the past nor contemporary "complete lais sez-faire relativism" presents a rationally acceptable alternative to genu ine or "soft" pluralism (p. 42). Part 2 analyzes and compares the two most prominent conceptions of God in modern philosophy: God as infinite (Spinoza) and God as perfect (various proponents of the ontological argument). At the end of this scholarly investigation, the concept of God as infinite is judged to imply monism and God as perfect, anthropomorphism (p. 171). In the final chapter in this part, Clayton explains how the Kantian God that func tions solely as an ideal of reason, as "limit concept" (p. 345), becomes through the work of Friedrich Schleiermacher metaphysically signifi cant. This chapter bridges the historical and constructive parts of this book. Part 3 is an exposition of panentheism as a middle ground between "traditional" theism and pantheism. Theists hold that God is an infi nitely perfect agent whose perfection is extrapolated from human agents. They conceive God as an idealized human. This anthropomor phism, as is argued in part 2, unfortunately leads to a Kantian reaction and its subsequent skepticism. Pantheists, on the other hand, contend that God is an all-encompassing, self-existing One. Some, like Spinoza, conceive it as dead, materialistic, and deterministic, that is, as pure ob ject. Others, like Fichte, conceive it as alive and indeterminate, that is, as pure subject. However, all conceive the One without rationality or personality. To avoid the untoward consequences of all these views, Clayton proposes two conditions for a new philosophical theology, which he calls minimal personalist (panen)theism. One, we cannot sup pose God as less than personal since he is our source. Two, God's deci sion to create the world is free (pp. 425, 501-2). This model of God avoids Kantian skepticism as well as Schelling's God of absolute free dom, which is beyond all rationality. It provides grounds for criticizing Hegel's "arguments for the necessary rationality of the world" (pp. 493 4). Finally, its pluralism (the world as God's self-manifestation) allows for God as personal. Clayton and the panentheists are thus able to main tain unity of ground and consequent (God and the world) by the panthe ist principle that "outside of God there is no other God," that is, there is nothing, while simultaneously guaranteeing God as personal through the irreducibility of the world to God (p. 479). In Clayton's own words, "... unless theism includes not only the ultimate ground but also a di vine being who stands in relation to other beings, there is no God. One</page><page sequence="3">910 ELIZABETH C. SHAW AND STAFF might retain an impersonal absolute . . . lower than?because lacking qualities found in?finite subjects.... [T]his would produce an absolute that is unable to include human agents. .. . [0]ne must speak of the ab solute as potentially personal. This potential becomes actual in the pro cess of God's interaction with the world.... On this view, then, God be comes the creative response to his own ground" (pp. 497-8). If Clayton in fact contends that God's relations with the finite actual ize his "highest predicates," that is, those associated with personhood (p. 425), does he not make God's personality a correlative of the human? Is this not anthropomorphism with a vengeance? Early on in his book, Clayton announces "the collapse of the Scholas tic doctrine of analogy" (p. 4). In its place he proposes "soft" pluralism, which he justifies in terms of C. S. Peirce's notion of truth (pp. 31-5). The latter's notion, however, requires a tri- rather than a dipolar analysis of being that is favored by Clayton. Relating this point to the nature of personality, is it possible to have an "I" and "Thou" without a "We"? (See Heribert M?hlen's Der Heilige Geist als Person). Even if these questions are relevant, Professor Clayton should be lauded for a thor ough and stylistically effortless presentation of the most prominent modern thinkers in philosophical theology.?John Plecnik, Belmont Ab bey College.</page></plain_text>
