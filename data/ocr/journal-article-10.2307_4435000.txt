<plain_text><page sequence="1">ABHANDLUNGEN SOME LIGHT FROM THE EAST ON CRETAN CULT PRACTICE Much has been written on Cretan religion since Sir Arthur Evans began his monumental work of excavation at Knossos early in this century. The evidence uncovered by him and other archaeologists at the various sites on the island is full and often detailed, but, Linear B apart, cannot be interpreted with the help of written sources. It is entirely archaeological in nature and, in Nilsson's famous phrase,' "has come down to us as a picture book without text." Therefore, until we possess a reliable decipherment of Linear A - and probably even then - it is important to draw on outside sources, where possible, in order to advance our knowledge of Cretan religious practice which at present is almost exclusively understood from internal evidence and from largely contem- porary finds from the Greek mainland. Minoan religion did not, of course, come about in a vacuum some time during the Bronze Age, nor did it develop in isolation from other notable cultures of the period. The island of Crete formed an integral part of a larger Aegean community which recent archaeological and linguistic studies have shown to be closely connected. Scholars from Sir Arthur Evans onward have firmly believed in the flux of religious good, as early as Neolithic times, coming from the East - Egypt2 and Asia Minor3-, but until very recently little or no definite proof has been available to substantiate such reasonable theories. Within the last ten years, however, the horizons of our knowledge regarding the Aegean cultural community have widened to a remarkable extent, and it has become abundantly clear that the Greek and Cretan religious world owed a heavy debt to the Eastern peoples of Anatolia, Syria and Egypt. Religious beliefs conceived in the Near East travelled westward in a series of one-sided migratory movements from Neolithic times. The likely routes of such movements have been charted elsewhere and need not be set out again.4 1 M. P. Nilsson, The Minoan-Mycenaean Religion and its Survival in Greek Religion2, Lund 1950, 7. 2 A.

DIETRICH They generally ran in one direction - from East to West -, continued over many centuries and began in the Neolithic Age; although it is now impossible to establish exact dates beyond the beginning of the Bronze Age, or, more precisely, earlier than about 2700 or even 2500 B.C., with the help of contem- porary dating tables from Egyptian and Mesopotamian dynasties. This terminus may well be pushed backward in time; but for our purposes it will suffice to recognize the relationship between East and West at the turn of the fourth millenium when in spirit the Greek and Cretan worlds may be said to have had strong ties with Asian culture.' Crete lay well in the path of these migrations which occurred immediately preceding and during the Early Bronze Age; and, according to Schachermeyr, she was further subject to a secondary series of movements which brought her into contact with Egypt and Northern Africa.6 In this way Crete became at this early time a part of a wider cultural group which, amongst others, shared some common linguistic features with the East,7 as well as aspects of religious cult. This point is evident from several parts of the Cretan religious scene. For example the design, purpose and function of the Minoan palace compara- tive archaeology has shown to derive partly from Eastern models.8 The very 6 Cf. Schachermeyr, D. ag.

Kult. i6f. 7 It appears that before the beginning of the Bronze Age there developed in Anatolia the use of a language, marked by the suffixes -nd/t- and -s(s)-, which came to be shared by the people of the Western Aegean, and which survived in numerous place names, like Kindyassos, Myriandos, Laranda, Blandos and so on - see Schachermeyr, D. min. Kult. I6. For the theory that Phoenician - a Western Semitic language - was spoken in parts of Greece and Crete during the Bronze Age, see M. Astour, Hellenosemitica, Leiden I965, 357, and Cyrus H. Gordon in a number of articles cited by Astour in his bibliography. For other theories see L. R. Palmer, Mycenaeans and Minoans, London 1961, 26; 232ff.; cf. J. Zafiropulo, Mead and Wine, London x966, e.g. 28. 8 L. Woolley compares with the Cretan palace that of king Yarim-Lim at Alalakh in Northern Syria, and that of Zimri-Lim at Mari, see A Forgotten Kingdom, Being a Record of the Results obtained from the Excavation of Two Mounds Atchana and Al Mina, in the Turkish Haty, Baltimore 1953, 74f.

The same architectural dependence has been established for the Greek mainland. Schaeffer shows that the palaces at Tiryns and Mycenae were modelled on North Syrian examples, like the palace at Ugarit, C. F. A.

The palaces, the bulk of the seal engravings and frescoes belonged to Cretan religious life; and their connection with the East clearly shows the direction from which much of the original religious impetus came to the island. It is now impossible to construct a graph marking the principal areas of contact between East and West, and thus determine with a fair measure of precision the localities from which religious beliefs and practices were imported to Crete. Such areas are to be found in Syria and Anatolia. Their influence on Cretan religion becomes evident from ethnographic, linguistic researches, as well as from com- parative archaeology which prove the presence of, for example, Phoenician, that is Western Semitic, colonies in west and eastern Crete which in the latter area may have arrived not later than the beginning of the second millennium B.C.00 These peoples, the Eteocretans according to Homer,1' of course, brought with them their language and cults.12 The Phoenician contribution, however, to Cretan religious life with few exceptions, like the Europa myth for example, at present remains vague. Much more fruitful in to-day's state of our knowledge is the astonishing correspondence, dating from Neolithic times, between certain features of Cretan and Anatolian cultures, particularly in the south-west portions of the latter. Schachermeyr's work in the remains of Neolithic and Bronze Age pottery in the Agean area revealed to him the ties between Greece and Crete and south-west Anatolia, especially sites like Hacilar and (atal Huyuk.13 Professor John Evans, excavating the Neolithic levels at Knossos, again discovered, "that the first neolithic inhabitants there arrived with pottery and crops that can only be derived from western Anatolia".'4 So far a brief outline of relevant material which allows the hope that discoveries in the Near East may be expected to throw fresh light on the Cretan religious scene. Therefore considerable promise was attached to excavations of s.w. Anatolian Neolithic sites, such as Hacilar and Satal Hiiyiik, begun in the fifties and early sixties and continuing to this day. * Alalakh, and perhaps from the palace of Zimri-Lim at Mari, where the Knossos style frescoes appeared some hundred years or more (c. 1750) before those at Knossos; see Woolley, op. cit. (see n. 8) 74 and Hutchinson, op. cit. (see n. 8) I79. Professor T. B. L. Webster kindly pointed out to me that according to Mr. Seton-Lloyd the Mari frescoes were not the same technique as the Cretan frescoes. On seals and miniature carvings see e.g. Hutchinson, ibid. 148 f. 10 Astour, op. cit. (see n. 7) 347. The dates of Phoenician arrivals in the West remain uncertain. It is quite possible, so Prof. F. C. Fensham kindly informed me, that Astour's dates are too high. Cf. J. Boardman in his review of Astour's book in Class. Rev. XVI, ' (I966) 87. 11 Od. 19, 176. 12 Cf. C. H.

DIETRICH The site of Satal Hiiyuk lies in the Konya Plain of s.w. Anatolia and was discovered in I958. Actual digging there did not begin until I96I, under the guidance of James Mellaart, and the results so far of three campaigns have been published in three preliminary reports."' From these we gather that ,atal Huyuk was "the capital site of the Konya Plain," and that its remains give evidence of the high cultural level attained there16. At the time of publication of the third report in I964, the excavators had not yet reached virgin soil, but they established some ten separate main levels168 to which eventually were assigned the dates ranging from 6500- 5700 B.C.,17 which means that there was a temporal overlap between the last levels of g2atal Huyuk (II-0) and some early levels of Hacilar (IX-VI).18 To allow a quicker impression of earlier levels Mellaart carried on the digging in two areas: one from the top of the mound (area A), and the other on its western slope (area E).19 The sixth level revealed five separate shrines in various states of preservation, all forming an integral part of the city's "agglut- inative" building complex. In the third campaign (I963), which saw more extensive excavations than the previous years, the areas A and E were linked up and three more shrines came to light in Level VI which, however, had to be subdivided into the earlier level VIB and the later Level VIA.20 This same campaign also revealed three more shrines. The subdivision of Level VI, it seems, has little bearing on the cult continuity of the different shrines, for, generally built in VIB, they endured to the end of VIA or were replaced. Below Level VIB eight shrines were found in Level VII,21 and perhaps six in the not yet fully explored Levels VIII-X.22 All these shrines, where possible, have been reconstructed and fully described by Mellaart,23 and it will be enough to refer to them in the pages of his reports. Mellaart's examination already established that throughout the period rep- resented by about ten levels - that is the space of one thousand years - the form of cult observed in these shrines varied little if at all, for, certainly from Levels VI-X - the levels from which we have the best shrines - the basic principles of architectural construction remained identical.24 Also the con- tinued use of a particular shrine over periods represented by more than one level, such as the first five shrines discovered from Level VIA and B, as well as, in many cases, the construction of a new shrine on the same sacred ground, 15 J.

Therefore the date of a level to which a particular shrine belonged has compara- tively little bearing on the significance of the cult paraphernalia found there. A first glance at Mellaart's reconstructions of the (at. H. shrines reveals some surprising correspondences between these and certain features of Cretan Bronze Age religion. However, there is much that cannot be paralleled in Crete at any time, including some apparently unique architectural features of the Anatolian shrine, at least one of which was built with a clerestory raising the centre of the structure.28 A good part of the cult 'furniture' itself seems unique, such as the women's breasts modelled in plaster on the east walls of the First and Second shrines of Level VIB,29 containing either the lower jaw of a wild boar,30 or the head of a vulture with beak projecting beyond the nipples.31 Such breasts - whose obvious connection with fertility needs no comment -, if anything, call to mind the Ephesian Artemis rather than any Minoan goddess.32 A great deal, too, of the wall painting in the different shrines, either decorative or of human skulls and bones, structures of reed and mat,33 paintings of kilims,34 or even of a town and volcano,35 appear alien to Cretan motifs. The vultures, again, which figure prominently in a number of paintings in the shrines at cat. H. - often together with headless corpses of men36 -, although their significance as scaven- gers cleaning human bodies of flesh may well be obvious, find no clear echo in Crete.37 25 A. S. XIV, e.g. 40; 42; 45; 70; 73 for examples from Levels IV, VII, VIII, IX, X. 26 There are also examples, however, where houses came to be built on former sites of shrines, so that Mellaart speaks of a continuity of cult in ?patal Hiiytik "not as absolute as in Mesopotamia," A. S. XIV, 45. 27 Certainly from Level VI to the earlies levels, A. S. XIV, 45; 73. 28 The Second Shrine of Level VIB (EVI, io), A. S. XIII, 70 and fig. 14. 29 EVI, 8; EVI, io. 30 EVI, 8 A. S.

Mellaart may well be right in believing the vulture and boar to represent death, but the use of piglets as victims during the Greek Skirophoria and Thes- mophoria is not a good example in this connection. Why only the heads and jaws of these animals? Perhaps they belonged to a cruel and primitive rite which failed to survive. 33 A. S. XIII, PI. XXVI, a; b. 34 A.S. XIV, Pl. XI, b. 35 Op. cit. P1.

There is, however, not enough evidence extant either to confirm -or reject such a thesis. The griffin, like the sphinx, in Cretan art was very common in many scenes by no means always of a chthonic or funereal nature- see especially Nilsson, op. cit. (see n. i)</page><page sequence="6">390 B. C. DIETRICH Equally unparalleled38 in the West are the numerous 'panels of hands' painted on the walls of houses and shrines in Stat. H.39 They were done in black or red and occasionally with four fingers.40 Their significance is mysterious.41 One might be inclined to suppose that such hands were felt to suggest divine power and presence, like the separate human ears and eyes represented on Cretan seals.42 But this interpretation, too, is wrought with great difficulty, for at least one panel, in a house of Level VI (EVI, I5), shows fifty-seven hands of children. These are some of the more striking divergencies between the places of cult at ?Catal Hiiyiik and Crete; and they serve to sound a note of caution to the historian of comparative religion. To begin with Mellaart's work on the Eastern site is by no means complete. The results of future campaigns are bound to affect earlier interpretations of the archaeological material: corrections will have to be made and perhaps some theories discarded. What has been dis- covered thus far, most certainly belonged to a religion known in part to Crete by virtue of the cultural and ethnographic ties which bound the two centres. But, even if the earliest levels of Hacilar overlapped with the last of gatal Huyiik, a space of three thousand years or more separated the latter Neolithic cultures from Bronze Age Crete. Inevitably the religious good which originally found its way into Crete from Anatolia, not only came to be mixed or juxta- posed with ideas from other areas like Egypt, for example, but also was shaped in new, perhaps less barbarous, forms by the developing Cretan spirit and culture. Such, however, is the nature of our material, and we have to work with 368 n. 96. The only certain fact known about these creatures is that they were imported to Crete from the East, op. cit. 255, probably from Syria, H. Frankfort, "Notes on the Cretan Griffin," B. S. A. XXXVII (I936/7) io6ff. The griffin's position in Cretan belief is un- certain: the animal was frequently associated with a goddess, perhaps a Mistress of Animals. In all likelihood, like the daemon, the griffin was an attendant to divinity rather than divine itself - cf. Dietrich, Death, Fate and the Gods, London I965, i6. Thus its function on the Hagia Triada sarcophagus - the head-end - drawing the goddesses' car was parallel to that of the horses - at the foot-end - harnessed to a similar car - see F. Matz, Gotter- erscheinung und Kultbild im minoischen Kreta (Akad. d. Wissensch. u. d. Literat.), Wies- baden 1958, P1. 12 &amp; 13. Nowhere is there any clear proof that the griffin in Crete was involved in funeral cult. The ring of Nestor most probably is a forgery, cf. Nilsson, op. cit. (see n. I) so. Therefore, more firmly than ever one should restate Picard's phrase - C. Picard, Les Religions Pr6hell6niques (CrUte et Myc6nes), Paris I948, 198, "on sera r6serv6 sur le culte fun6raire du griffon." 38 One possible parallel is the hand modelled together with a scorpion, snake and other animals on a heart-shaped gold amulet from a tomb near Hagia Triada, Nilsson, op. cit. (see n. I) fig. 152. 39 A. S. XIII, P1. XI, a, b; XVIII, b; A. S. XIV, P1. VI, a-c. 40 A. S. XIII, P1. XII, a, c. 41 Mellaart, A. S. XIII, 8i, notes that a similar sign of a four fingered hand, placed sideways, occurs on a pot in a woman's grave at Hacilar, and he believes that the hand was an apotropaeic sign, or the signature of a person who participated in a cultic ceremony. 42 Dietrich, op. cit. (see n. 4) 22.</page><page sequence="7">Some Light from the East on Cretan Cult Practice 39I it in the best way possible, at the same time hoping to avoid the more obvious pitfalls of conjecture." Yet there is another side to the coin: much of the religious belief which governed cult in the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age in the Aegean area had not only been introduced from the Near East, but was uniform in a number of basic concepts." Furthermore, certain elemental features of cult in the Aegean communities, from the Near East to Crete and Greece, one suspects, as tenaciously kept their hold on popular imagination as did the sacred cult locality itself which, in many instances, endured not only throughout the thousand years or more of eat. H., but also in some localities in Crete and Greece, where cult can be shown to have continued on the same site at times into the Christian era.4" The continued use of one locality for cult purposes does not always, of course, even in the religious conservatism of the Neolithic and later Aegean religious scene, signify that the content of such cult remained unaltered. Therefore, particularly in view of the long gap of time involved, it is advisable to proceed carefully when comparing certain Anatolian with Bronze Age Cretan religious features. There are, however, some correspondences between East and West which can reasonably be explained by the relationship of the two centres. As far as can be gathered from the remains and reconstruction at Satal Hiuyiuk, all the shrines there formed an integral part of the city's "agglutinative" building complex: although they obviously were places of worship and religious cere- monial, these shrines were in no way separate from the other domestic quarters. They further, either in part served as store rooms for produce or granaries, or were flanked by chambers or rooms for this purpose." This functional use, an important reflection on the nature of the cult and deity revered there, the C2atal Hiiyiik shrines shared not only with the later palace sanctuaries or the palaces themselves in the East, but also with Crete and Greece. There is no reason to doubt, but that the significance of this practice was the same in every instance: the deity in or about whose shrine the produce was stored had been responsible for its growth and owned it.47 A remarkable feature of the Anatolian shrines consists in the important part played by animals: leopards, boars, heads of rams, moulded into the walls, figured prominently. The most important animal in the shrines of all 43 In addition to the chronological gap between East and West, one must also bear in mind that the migratory movements described above cannot yet be established with full certainty. " Cf. Dietrich, op. cit. (see n. 4) 13. '6 Perhaps the most striking examples in this connection come from cave cult which suffered change and developed in form but endured on the same site. The famous cave at Amnisos in Crete, for example, with some interruptions saw cult from Neolithic to Christian times, Nilsson, op. cit. (see n. I) 58. Similarly, on the mainland of Greece the Parnes cave, south of Phyle, was the scene of a cult which continued from prehistoric to Christian times, Nilsson, ibid. 67. "' A. S.

A large figure of a bull was often modelled in reserve on the plastered wall, usually the north wall.48 Very frequently walls were fashioned with a single bull's head, or with a row of heads occasionally beside one or several heads of rams.49 Of special interest for our purposes is the motif on the east wall of the First Shrine from Level VI.65 The central panel of this wall, in the upper register, has a row of three painted bulls' heads separated by knobs and flanked in the right panel, at the same height, by the head of a ram. With this arrangement we may compare the scene on a Minoan gold signet ring found by Schliemann as part of a treasure south of the Shaft Grave Circle at Mycenae. The ring is reproduced by Bossert.61 On it we see two registers of bull and goat heads, three each, attached side by side to a wall and separated by a row of knobs, as far as can be made out from the badly worn surface of the ring, not unlike the Ana- tolian examples.62 The similarity between the two representations is evident, whatever we believe about the nature of the cult of which they were part.53 The bull crania attached to the walls of many shrines obviously represented the whole animal, occasionally found in the same shrine. These heads, therefore, together with another remarkable feature of the Anatolian shrine, at last solve the long disputed question of the origin and significance of the so-called Minoan horns of consecration. In tatal Hiuyuik not only the head could stand for the whole bull, but also the horn cores, usually mounted in a rectangular, pillar-like, structure, or along the sides of a bench seven deep.64 At times all three forms - the whole animal, the head, and "bull pillar" - occurred together in one shrine.55 The separate horns of the Anatolian shrines56 were the ancestors of the Cretan horns of consecration which had been imported to the island direct from the East: in spite of the curious stereotype shape they assumed in Cretan hands - a point that gave rise to much speculation concerning their significance7 -, the association with the figure of the bull, as well as the im- portant position they held in cult, is evident from the Anatolian finds.68 48 In three separate levels: Shrines VI, 8; VII, 8; IX, 8; A. S. XIII, 67; XIV, 70. 49 See e.g. the First Shrine in Level VI, EVI, 8, A. S. XIII, figs. 8-I3. 50 EVI, 8, A. S. XIII, fig. 12. 51 Altkreta3, fig. 392e. 52 A. W. Persson, The Religion of Greece in Prehistoric Times, Berkeley I942, 76, describes these knobs as rosettes. 53 Compare the several crania in association with a goddess in a religious scene from a famous Minoan ring found in the same treasure, Tsountas, Revue Arch6ologique (Igoo) P1. VIII, i. It has been suggested by Mellaart, A. S. XIII, 79, that in Crete the goat replaced the ram in religious representations for reasons of ecology. 54 E.g. Shrine AVI, i, A. S. XIII, fig. 4. 55 E.g. EVI, 8, A. S. XIII, fig. 9. 56 They were also found in a shrine at Beycesultan, Seton Lloyd- J. Mellaart, Beycesultan fig. i6. 57 See Nilsson, op. cit. (see n. I) I83ff. 58 Cf.

Kult. 157.</page><page sequence="9">Some Light from the East on Cretan Cult Practice 393 The bull in tatal Hilyiuk quite obviously was the object of worship: he could be represented merely by the head or the horn-cores. It follows that wherever the horns might be found, in caves, as at Patso,59 in peak sanctuaries,60 in funeral cult, as on the Hagia Triada sarcophagus, in shrines, or elsewhere in the Minoan palace, they bespoke the presence of the bull and the divine powers symbolised by that animal. This does not imply, of course, that horns were cult objects, for they occasionally served as ornamental motifs to Cretan artists, but they were more than receptacles of instruments used in religious rites.6' The connection between the horns of consecration and the bull are ignored at one's peril in any attempt to define the former's precise cultic function which depends, therefore, on a knowledge of the part played in Anatolian and Cretan religious belief by the bull. And, even when due allowance is made to the tem- poral gap between the two cultures, we can expect to learn about the religious nature of the Cretan bull from the Eastern practice.To this we shall ret urn below.62 59 Nilsson, op. cit. (see n. I) I67 and fig. 68. 60 See e.g. the steatite rhyton from Kato Zakro, "Archaeological Report for I963-4," Journal of Hellenic Studies LXXXIV (I964) fig. 39. 61 This thesis, originally suggested by Sir Arthur Evans, is supported by Nilsson, op. cit. (see n. i) I83 f. 62 The Cretan horns, aside from their now obvious relation to the bull, still present a number of problems, for in some aspects their cultic usage apparently differed from the Anatolian model. With one likely exception from Mochlos (E.M. - Evans, op. cit. (see n. 2) I, 57 fig. i6C), most of the Cretan horns belong to L.M. II, III, with a few examples from M.M. II and III. Their shape has changed and seems at times to have only a tenuous connection with the original bull horns. More important is the fact that the horns in Crete came to be associated with other objects, normally placed in their middle, of which there is as yet only a weak or no trace at all in Anatolian shrines. The most common object in this connection was the double axe: in Cretan religion a frequent and important part of the cult paraphernalia both by itself and in association with the horns. Examples are too frequent and well known to require special quotation. The origin and significance of the Cretan double axe is still obscure and need not detain us here (for the Near Eastern and Anatolian origin of this implement see Schachermeyr, D. min. Kult. I6i and refs.). So far it occurs only once in Oatal Huiyuik in a wall painting from House AVI, 6 (A. S. XIII, P1. VIII (b) ), in no wise obviously connected with the bull horns. Its butterfly shape, with the handle projecting in equal length from the axe head, was well known to the Chalcolithic Near East, as well as to Bronze Age Crete, as can be seen from a sealing from Phaestos (Schachermeyr, ibid. fig. 86; 87). The presence of the axe in Neolithic Anatolian wall painting adds strength to the well founded theory that this implement, too, had been imported to Crete from the East (Cf. Acta Classica VIII (I965) 25), and perhaps originally from Anatolia. Beyond this we cannot go. In the painting at 1atal Huiyiik the axe is shown beside other symbols which at present defy interpretation, but rather tend to deepen the mystery surrounding the position of the double axe in Cretan cult, where, for example, at times a sacred knot replaced the shaft of the axe in a symbolic arrangement which "became the prototype for a decorative device of the later L.M. I ceramic style" (Evans, ibid. L, 433, fig. 3IO c-e). Neither the Anatolian example nor the instance of the Minoan axe in cultic use bear out Schachermeyr's thesis (ibid. i6i) that this implement was the symbol of power in a matriarchal Cretan society.</page><page sequence="10">394 B. C. DIETRICH The remains of the Anatolian shrines under discussion emphasize the vital part played in religious belief by certain types of animals; a point which equally applied to Cretan cult, although, apart from the bull, ram (goat), stag, and leopard, the Cretan animals included in their ritual differed from the Eastern types. Neither snake nor lion occurred in 2atal Hiiyiik in painting or plastic art; instead of the dove or raven - well known to the Cretan - the former painted figures of the vulture which so obviously was thought to exercise a special function in burial or funeral cult. It is most likely that, beside the divergent geographical and climatic conditions, there were other reasons at play to explain the differences. Of greater value for our purpose is the fact that both in East and West these animals were felt either to possess divine powers themselves or, at any rate, they were closely associated with the deity revered in the shrine or cult locality where they occurred. This association between animal and deity - generally a goddess - was quite pronounced in (atal Hiiyhk and may well have a bearing on a similar close relationship in Crete between the so-called Mistress of Animals and her animal; a point which will be discussed in greater detail later in this essay. A great many shrines at gatal Huyiik showed the figure - sometimes to a height of ten feet and more68 - of a goddess modelled in plaster usually against the west wall.69 This goddess, sometimes represented twice or three times in the same shrine,70 marks the nature of the cult practised in these shrines as one concerned with fertility and birth in particular.7' The goddess' arms are raised and bent at right angles at the elbows in a gesture familiar from Neolithic figures in the Aegean area, as well as from numerous Cretan statuettes and idols. This attitude of the arms has been convincingly explained as a "Segnungsgestus".7' The legs of the goddess are raised and in the position of giving birth, not unlike several Neolithic figures from the East.7T She 68 EVI, IO, A. S. XIII, 7o and fig. 14. 69 This seems mostly to be true of the shrines of the Sixth Level, although in some cases the goddess was also found on e.g. thxe east or south wall. EVIB, 31 shows three figures: one on the west wall, another on the south wall, and the third on the east wall of the the shrine A. S. XIV, fig. 7 and 8. 70 Cf. the previous note.

These were found at Delphi and in numerous tombs, Nilsson, op. cit. (see n. I) 305f. and fig. 149, and incidentally recall the white (sitting?) female figure painted on the wall of a shrine from Level IV at 5atal Huyuk, A. S. XII (I962) PI. XIII, a, b.</page><page sequence="11">Some Light from the East on Cretan Cult Practice 395 obviously was a Mother Goddess,74 also portrayed, with pronounced female attributes, in a great many statuettes found in the same shrines. Birth, the act of birth, appears to have been her main concern: she was modelled on the walls in the attitude of labour. Once she was shown as pregnant,71 but several times as actually giving birth, graphically described in a clay figure from the shrine in Level 11 78 Remarkable is her association, and even identification, with her special animals, the bull, ram and the leopard. Not only do these animals share the most prominent positions of the shrine with the goddess, but she also gives birth to a ram,77 or to a bull.78 She may either appear in animal form or perhaps be represented by one, as in the so-called Leopard Shrine (EVI, 44), where in all likelihood79 the central motif had been the large panel of two leopards shown face to face on the north wall.80 The platform in front of this panel still shows traces of grain offerings as well as statuettes of the standing goddess.81 Some further support for the appearance of the goddess in animal shape comes from her curious animal (feline?) ears on some of her figures." This close relationship with particular animals, apart from her function as goddess of birth, was a common part of a goddess of nature and life, a feature which we find again in the Cretan and Greek goddesses of popular belief, like Demeter and Artemis. She was a goddess of nature, and as such the Anatolian deity most probably governed all aspects of the constantly recurring cycle of birth, marriage and death.83 There is, indeed, some evidence in gatal Huyuk of this goddess' connection with death and, according to Mellaart, with the vulture, the bird of death.'4 Still more persuasive evidence comes from the fact that her shrine in t2atal Huyiik was not only the scene of birth but also of death 7' It is perhaps somewhat rash to reconstruct from the Anatolian shrines the "pantheon" of Catal Hiuyuk "presided over by the mother goddess, her son, and husband - male spirits of fertility symbolized by large and small bulls - and her daughter (or daughters ?) younger version(s) of the great goddess herself."

The several murals with vultures attacking normally headless human corpses leave no doubt about the significance of such scenes.85 The scenes of death and funeral cult appear generally to have been confined to, and about, the east wall of a shrine, while, as was noticed above, the goddess in the posture of giving birth had her normal place on the opposite, the west wall. Mellaart remarks on this division86 which, however, does have exceptions to the rule.87 Nevertheless there is abundant evidence that the shrines at 2atal Hiiyiik88 were used for burial grounds. The most usual form was for the human remains to be interred - in a secondary burial - below the east wall of a shrine.89 The bones often were buried in random order, although at times an entire undisturbed skeleton was found.Y0 The scenes on the wall - the east wall - above the burial ground, one might reasonably expect, dealt with the subject of death, in such a way, however, that this event was merely considered one aspect - leading once more to birth and life - of the never ending cycle of nature religion. In this belief (;atal Hiiyiik could hardly have differed signally from other Stone and Bronze Age cultures practising the same beliefs; and the decoration of these walls should reflect features of cult which, even if not always certain in sense and interpretation, might well illuminate parts of the Cretan religious scene. Some of the most interesting decorations come from the shrines of the Sixth Level. The First Shrine here (EVI, 8) had on its central panel, in the course of its four different phases, a row of three bull's heads, two rows of women's breasts, each concealing the lower jaw of a wild boar, a series of hands, and wall painting depicting flowers, bees or butterflies, and probably chrysalises, over which was painted the design of a honeycomb."' The connection between the breasts and birth and life is plain; no less clear is the significance of the boar's jaws within the breasts when compared with the pair of similar breasts on the east wall of the Second Shrine EVI, io) which were found to contain the beaks of vultures - the bird of death."" Both breast and jaw or griffin beak, in short, were indicative of birth and death. Their presence fully confirms the symbolic value the artists gave to their work; and they obviously must have a bearing on the meaning of the remaining wall decoration including the bull's heads, the bees, chrysalises, honeycomb and so on. Beside the pair of breasts on the east wall of the Second Shrine, there recurs the bull's head attached to the wall above a deep niche painted in red and 85 See e.g. the so-called Vulture Shrine VII, 8, A.

In front of this bull, sunk into a platform, was a hole in which were found some scattered human bones.93 The Third Shrine (EVI, I4) merely had a bull's head fixed in the central panel of the east wall, while a niche, surmounted by a ram's head formed the main decoration of the south wall.94 The design of the niche and ram's head, side by side this time and flanked in the right panel by a bull's head, is found once more on the east wall of the Fourth Shrine93 (EVI, 7). From these few shrines already a definite pattern of decoration emerges, which can be paralleled from shrines of other levels, where the heads of the bull and ram, the very creatures to whom at times on the west walls the goddess is seen to give birth, and a niche - usually painted red - predominate, together with wall paintings featuring human hands, bees, or butterflies, honeycomb etc. Burial in the shrine gave the worshipper at Satal Hiiyiik the promise of life: this is not only symbolically shown by the women's breasts on the walls below which the bones were discovered, but also by the nature of the burial itself, for the bones, as well as the niches, and a number of animal heads, were at times painted with red ochre.98 This was a wide-spread and well-known practice of Stone and Bronze Age cultures to denote rebirth from death.97 There is no doubt that the murals, the bull and ram crania, and the niche played a vital role in this belief intimately connected with what must have been in essence a chthonic cult of vegetation and fertility. The frequently recurring niche alone affords a clue to the original location of this type of cult, and serves as a link, so to speak, to an important aspect of Minoan cult which also dated back to the Stone Age. The wall niche, in all likelihood, represented a cave.98 Generally it is found on the east wall of the shrines below which the burials occurred: the wall, in fact, most closely asso- ciated with death in the cycle of nature. In Greek thought caves were entrances to the underworld. Such natural grottoes were avenues from below to the world of the living at sites like Colonus Hippius, the locality of the Semnae cult, near by the Areopagus in Athens, and the Boeotian Tilphossion.99 The same belief probably obtained in Crete concerning caves and natural fissures in the ground, and there is some evidence that this idea was transmitted West from Anatolia, or at least was shared by these Neolithic peoples.'?0 93 Ibid. fig.

DIETRICH The worshipper at (:atal Huyiik still associated the niche in his shrine, and other paraphernalia of his ritual, with a cult which at one time had been celebrated in a cave. Together with fully anthropomorphic statuettes of his goddess, he placed many limestone concretions and stalagmites or stalactites - occasionally partly fashioned to resemble human shape - in the shrine and, as in the Second Shrine of Level VI (EVI, io), below the 'cave' in the wall. A number of similar natural formations have been recovered from caves in the Taurus Mountains to the south of Satal Huiyk. The Turkish peasants call them bebek or "baby",101 and they clearly were the ancestors of the stalagmitic objects found in many shrines and occasionally in a private house.102 Shrines of other levels, too, contained such objects; in fact, following the I963 campaign, Mellaart could categorically state that "the discovery of cult statues is in- variably accompanied by a collection of stalactites and concretions".03 The fertility cult, therefore, practised in the domestic shrines of tatal Huyiik, had at one time - perhaps in full, certainly in its essential parts - been transferred from a cave. Though the locality of the cult may have changed, its form did not relax its curious hold on the mind of the worshipper who, over many generations, retained the aniconic stalagmite as an image of his goddess beside her figure developing to semi-iconic and eventually fully human and naturalistic shape.'04 From the finds at gatal Hiiyiik there emerge two points of signal interest to the understanding of Cretan religion. The first concerns the transference of a cave cult, concerned with birth, death, and nature religion in general, to a domestic shrine, and the second consists in the fact that a number, if not all, of the cult statues evolved from the unfashioned limestone concretions, stalagmites and stalactites found in caves. This can only mean that the stalag- mites, which enjoyed a special position in religious worship, were in fact aniconic representations of a divinity. That is, far from being symbolic of a particular god or goddess, they, like the subsequent statue, func- tioned as true images of divinity. The many examples found in shrines and private dwellings make it possible to observe an evolution of these shapes from fully aniconic to semi-iconic and eventual anthropomorphic form. The Second Shrine at iatal Huyuk alone has yielded examples of all stages which apparently developed from the original limestone concretions. Such figures vary from the rough stalagmite with sculptured head,'"' to a smoothed stone with superficially carved'06 or incised'07 features, to fully, though schematized, human statuettes'08 whose shape still betrays their origin. 101 A.

Of those representing deities, at least some are male.110 This picture of cult statues was strengthened and verified in the course of the I963 campaign from discoveries in other shrines, such as the Boar's Head Shrine (VIB, 45), the Leopard Shrine (VIA, 44), and the Second Vulture Shrine (VII,2I) which, beside both the stalagmites and fully developed statuettes, had concretions with carved heads,111 as well as roughly moulded figures that still clearly show their origin."12 Here we have to hand some unequivocal material with a probable bearing on a few aspects of Cretan cave cult, which not only enjoyed a wide dispersion but also endured in certain instances throughout the history of that island. This is not to say that the Minoan cave cult was an import from Anatolia: this type of cult was too wide spread, not only in the Aegean area, but also in Europe from the Stone Age, to elect any one region or people as the first to have made use of a natural abode for themselves and their gods before they learnt the skill of building their own houses."3 The rich Anatolian finds should help to throw some further light on the more thinly documented Cretan scene, particularly in view of the close ties between the two centres from the Neo- lithicum. Thus the Anatolian cult, which in all likelihood had once been practised in the caves of the Taurus Mountains, had some features in common with what we know of Cretan practice. Indeed the finds from those Cretan caves, where cult obtained, were rich but hardly open to easy interpretation, consisting in main of pottery sherds, some of oxen-shaped rhyta or jars with scenes of bucrania, horns of consecration, figurines - human and animal -, grain, weapons - including double axes -, some bronze objects, lamps, and occasional cult furniture like libation tables, beside much evidence of sacrifice."4 Cult statues or idols were rare but not entirely absent.,"" In spite of the eminent position of cave cult in Cretan belief, its precise nature yet remains a vexing problem, because of the variety of apparently unrelated offerings found there,"" the scarcity of what might be called "Kultbildnisse," 109 See ibid.

DIETRICH and the fact that it extended over a vast period, sometimes even - with occasional interruptions - enduring into the Christian era. Cult content, therefore, was bound to change, become adapted, or even attached to different deities, as in the cave at Patso on Mt. Ida which in historical times was sacred to Hermes Kranaios.lU At times not only the deity but also the cult were relatively new, as in the case of the famous cave of Zeus on Mt. Ida, where no cult occurred before the Geometric period.1"8 The uncertainty of our evidence notwithstanding, there is enough to show that cave cult in Crete, too, was concerned with some basic aspects of nature religion namely birth and death. Cretan caves, like the Anatolian shrines, and caves before them from Neolithic times, were commonly used as burial grounds,"' a practice so traditional, in fact, that the cave gave its form to most of the subsequent tombs in Crete and on the mainland.120 The event of birth, too, was celebrated in the Cretan cave of which the best example, of course, comes from the famous cave of Eileithyia known to the Homeric poets,1"' and many years ago identified with the grotto discovered at Amnisos by Hazzidakis and Marinatos."'2 Whatever the etymology of her name'23 - and perhaps she was an invocatory name of the Cretan Great God- dessl" - Eileithyia was a Minoan goddess of birthlU who survived in Greek religion with strong cults in Laconia and on some Aegean islands."' In Greek belief Eileithyia became subordinate to, and often little more than an epithet of, the goddess of wild life and nature Artemis whose title Lochia gives testimony of her function as goddess of birth. Eileithyia's cult obviously was concerned with birth, and her close affinity with the Greek Artemis may well prove that she, like her Greek counterpart, was responsible not only for human birth but also that of animals. 117 F.

Much of it is late, occasionally from Hellenistic sources, but no less convincing for that, because our authorities quote from ancient religious stock which had survived to their day. The oldest perhaps, and the most significant, comes from that part of Greek myth which tells the story of the birth and nurture of the Divine Child. This kind of myth has been fully discussed else- where,127 and need not again detain us. The tale of the Divine Infant, normally the youthful paredros of the Mother Goddess, as he probably appears on some seals,128 his birth, nurture and death, belonged to old Minoan mythology and was shared with other Aegean religions in its essentials. This motif exerted an extraordinarily strong appeal to popular imagination which is reflected in the fact that the birth and death of the youthful male deity - representative of the growth and decay of vegetation - came to be adopted by Greek legend, where it endured in historic times. Greek literature - on which we have to depend for most of our information on the subject - knew several versions of this myth, but they did not differ in their essential points. Zeus as Kretagenes, and probably occasionally as the Minoan Velchanos,'29 became identified with the Divine Infant'30 who suffered the annually recurring fate of the eniautos daimon.'31 The features common to all versions of the myth, and of importance to our purposes, consisted in the babe's close association with Mother Earth or a Mother Goddess, and his nurture by an animal.'32 He is said to be born in a Cretan cave;l13 and, whatever his name, the stereotyped features of his myth mark him out as a part of Minoan and Aegean tradition of which one may well find a trace even in the Anatolian shrines of Oatal Hiuyiik. Archaeological evidence to show that one cave saw both the celebration of death and rebirth there is none ;134 this we may gather from later mythology describing the annual 127 See also Nilsson, op. cit. (see n. I) 533-83; Op. cit. (see fl. I25) 3I5ff.; cf. Willetts, op. cit. (see n. 97) I47; 239f.; 250 f. 128 E.g. the electrum ring from Mycenae, Evans, op. cit. (see n. 2) III, 463f., fig. 324; cf.

DIETRICH birth of Zeus in the same cave.-' Furthermore, so far only vague evidence has come to light that the Mother Goddess in Satal Hiiyiik had a youthful com- panion'" whose precise cultic functions, of course, at present remain obscure. In the absence of contemporary written records this lack is no more than natural, and it is equally painfully felt in the West. Under these circumstances firm analogies of religious practice between Anatolia and Crete are out of the question. However, we do possess enough knowledge, backed considerably by an appreciation of the cultural ties bet- ween East and West, to detect significant correspondences between a cult transferred from caves to a domestic shrine in %atal Hilyuk and the Cretan cave cult which, though it flourished throughout the island's history, also found a place in domestic shrines as in the Little Palace at Knossos. The latter has yielded up not only figures of horns of consecration and the goat, but also limestone concretions, the descendants of the stalagmite, with roughly shaped features not unlike the Anatolian manner.$7 In both localities the scene of the cult was intimately connected with a cave. The nature of the cult dealt with birth and death, in all likelihood symbolic of the annual growth and decay of vegetation. At the centre of this cult was a Great Goddess of nature particularly concerned with birth; a fact vividly portrayed in the shrines at Satal Huiyufk, and explicit in Crete in the figure of Eileithyia at Amnisos. The Cretan goddess "of the cave" was most likely shown by the famous statuette - probably as late as L. M. III - of a woman and child found by Forsdyke in a tomb at Mavro Spelio ("Black Cave"),1u and similar, incidentally, to a group of a mother holding her child, on a slate plaque from House EVI, 30 at Satal HUyfik.'9 The Cretan goddess, in her cave, recurs - once with the young god - on a few Cretan seals.140 This goddess of birth and nature in East and West was closely connected with certain animals; indeed, our pictorial evidence suggests lu See the version in Antoninus Liberalis I9. Cf. Nilsson, op. cit. (see n.I) 543. 184 See Mellaart, A. S. XIV, go. 137 Picard, op. cit. (see n. 37) 58; Nilsson, op. cit. (see n. I) gof. fig. 20; op. cit. (see n. 125) 267, P1. 3, 4. 188 E. J.

In (atal Hiiyuk the goddess gave birth to a bull or ram, animals which were also fully represented by their crania or simple horn cores (in the case of the bull) in the shrines, where once a pair of leopards (EVI, 44) may well have replaced the goddess (possibly in twin form). In Crete the same animals141 played a vital role in the cult of this figure. The same ambivalence between anthropomorphic goddess and her animal, reflected in myth, obtained and must account for the goat's position as the fostermother suckling the babe, depicted once on a seal impression from Knossos.142 The goat, perhaps, shown within a cave on another sealing from Knossos,la may have taken the goddess' place. Equally common to the Minoan cave sanctuary was the bull, that is generally the so-called horns of consecration which were found among the deposits, for example, in the cave at Patso,lU and which figured on the sealing from Knossos mentioned above,1' and formed the central motif on the bronze tablet (perhaps L. M. I) from the cave at Psychro.146 Most valuable, because no ambiguity attaches to it, is the functional correspondence between the Anatolian limestone concretions and stalagmites, and those found in many Cretan caves where cult obtained. Two significant points were noted above147 which concern the nature of the Anatolian stalag- mites as cult idols, and the fact that from them, stage by stage, developed the fully anthropomorphic idols in such a way that the ancient concretions, which harboured divine powers from the earliest days of the cult, never lost their efficacy, but were preserved and revered beside the human statuettes. In Minoan cave cult, too, stalagmites were objects of worship: in fact, in many instances, they seemed to form its centre.1" Our best examples again come from Eileithyia's cave at Amnisos and the cave at Psychro. The former had, among others, one large stalagmite occupying a central position in cult, for it was surrounded by a wall, and in front of it had been placed a quadrangular stone (altar?). 150 In the lower part of the double cave at Psychro - which, 141 E:xcept that the goat, presumably for ecological reasons (see n. 53), replaced the ram. 142 Evans, op. cit. (see n. 2) III, fig. 326. Evans calls the animal a sheep. The boy sitting beneath the goat, especially when compared with similar groups, makes the nature of this scene obvious, although, as Nilsson remarks (op. cit. (see n. I25) 321), the animal is not actually shown as suckling the infant. 1With stalagmites, reproduced in Matz, op. cit. (see n. 120) Pl. 54. 14 Nilsson, op. cit. (see n. I) 67.

This cave, however, did not see cult before the Geometric period. Cf. Picard, op. cit. (see n. 37) 58. 150 Nilsson, op. cit. (see n. I) 58, fig. 12. 26*</page><page sequence="20">404 B. C. DIETRICH judging from the remains, was frequented from M. M. - a number of stalag- mite pillars were discovered whose cultic importance appears from the numerous bronze objects placed in their vertical crevices.181 These examples have long suggested the sacred nature of such concretions,15' but their precise import could only be guessed at. Now their position in the Anatolian cult at Satal Hiiyiik does clearly demonstrate that the stalagmite was no symbolic representation of divinity or divine power, but an aniconic figure of the goddess who, in all likelihood, controlled growth and the cycle of birth and death. On this point we may now be more definite than was possible for Nilsson some fifteen years ago,"U whatever the changes that affected the cult in the passage of centuries before the historic age. It would nevertheless be rash to trace from the Cretan remains a similar development from the rough limestone concretion to the fully anthropomorphic figure. With one or two exceptions - like the semi-human concretions in the Little Palacel" - there seems to lie a gap, only in part to be explained by the poor preservation of sites often subject to plunder, between the crude and fully finished statuette in Crete. The Cretan caves have yielded a number of clay and bronze figurines of both animals and humans;"'- but, mostly belonging to M. M. and L. M., they were relatively late and, with few exceptions, like the bronze statuette from Psychro,'" constituted votive figurines rather than cult idols.157 Altogether the great majority of idols came from the Middle and Late Minoan periods, and they generally belonged to sites other than the cave.l' What evidence is there, in fact, in favour of a similar evolution in Crete of the anthropomorphic divinity from aniconic and semi-iconic shape? By no means enough to warrant any dogmatic statement in this direction on the strength of the Anatolian development described above. The only figures which could be considered in this context are the semi-iconic - upper half human, lower half cylindrical - bell-shaped idols, particularly from the Shrine of the Double Axes at Knossos and the Shrine at Gournia."' All such idols were placed in domestic shrines and 151 Nilsson, ibid. 63 f.; Picard, op. cit. (see n. 37) 200, also mentions the finds of double axes which apparently had been deliberately placed between these pillars. 1b2 Nilsson, op. cit. (see n. I) 74; 258. Picard, op. cit. (see n. 37) 58, speaks of them as "images de la divinitd secrete." 15 Op. cit. (see n. x) e.g. 73. 1" See above p. 402 f. 156 E.g. from Tylissos, see n. 115, from Psychro, Phaneromi, as well as clay figurines from Patso, Nilsson, op. cit. (see n. i) 6o; 62f.; 67. 156 Nilsson, ibid. 295, states his strong reservations here, too. 15? We do not know, of course, whether cave cult in Anatolia existed contemporaneously with the domestic shrines at Oatal Hilyilk, and if so, whether such caves contained cult images beside the stalagmites and stalactites. 155 Nilsson, op. cit. (see n. 1) 295, divides them into three classes according to the sites where they were discovered: votive figurines from sanctuaries, from shrines - usually cult idols-, and figurines from tombs. Cf. Willetts, op. cit. (see n. 97) 58. 155 Nilsson, op. cit. (see n. i) 8off. and fig. 14.</page><page sequence="21">Some Light from the East on Cretan Cult Practice 405 therefore did not occur before M. M.160 In spite of their pillar-like lower part, it is naturally impossible to suggest that these bell-shaped idols should neces- sarily be considered an intermediate stage between aniconic and iconic shape. They did, however, clearly belong to a religious tradition which greatly ante- dated M. M. ,161 and they therefore illustrate the strong religious conservatism which, as in the East, often placed them beside fully developed idols. Yet Crete apparently possessed no obvious examples of a transitional period: the crude was side by side the fully developed.162 Thus, on the one hand, the roughly modelled concretions in the Little Palace intimate that the aniconic goddess had altered little when she came to be associated with domestic cult. Conversely the artists of the best and late Minoan periods conceived her in anthropomorphic form, receiving cult in her cave sanctuary.163. Perhaps the Cretans forbore to observe each stage of a laborious development of their plastic art, because as early as E. M. - the third millennium B.C. - they imported the goddess' figure already in fully anthropomorphic shape from Aegean islands, like the Cyclades, from Egypt, and eventually perhaps from Anatolia.164 Beyond this we cannot go, and it is as well to state here that our information is not enough to establish with any degree of certainty the extent to which this cave cult of a goddess of birth and the cycle of nature survived in its original form. These few points just mentioned explain that a comparative study of Neolithic Anatolian and Minoan idols is not likely to advance our knowledge on the last issue, because with common beginnings, and these are worth noting, a Cretan goddess of nature found her own form at the peak of the island's culture. The discovery of the shrines at tatal Hiiyuik is of more immediate service to that type of Cretan cult concerned with the natural cycle of birth and death, a cult, we know, which certainly was observed in the cave sanctuary, and which formed an important part of the Minoan religious scene, for it endured for many generations leaving its mark on historic Greek thought. We may also reasonably suppose that this cult found other sites of worship outside the cave; and it may well be that dominant figures in Minoan religion, like the bull and, for example, the so-called Mistress of Animals had their first home here, or at least derived from cave cult. The bull's important position in the Anatolian shrines is strong evidence firstly that in Crete, too, this animal was involved in cult, and that the latter 160 Nilsson, ibid. 316; 321. 161 Cf.

DIETRICH could be represented either by the head or simply by the horn cores.165 This has to be firmly established before investigating the significance of the bull's ubiquitous presence in the shrines of 1atal Hiyuik and in the whole range of Cretan cult from the cave to the domestic shrine to the open area of the palace.166 The shrines at gatal Hiuyiik do not obviously show that the bull by itself was thought of as a god, so that there is no hope of further information from this source to resolve the discussion about the existence of a Minoan bull god, identified at times with the Minotaur in Greek legend, or even with the sun.167 More serious perhaps is the lack of any clear connection at Satal Huiyuik between the bull and the double axe,168 in view of the two facts that the axe and the horns, crania or entire bull are found so commonly together in Crete,169 and secondly that the labrys170 - the axe - itself in all likelihood derived from the East ,171 Bull cult enjoyed great popularity in the Near East and in the West from Neolithic times ;172 the bull was important enough in Anatolia to lend his name to the Taurus and Antitaurus mountain ranges.173 The nature of his cult - and this is well-known - was connected quite generally with vegetation and fertility. In Greek mythology, as Mellaart also points out,174 this connection was 165 This is doubted by Nilsson, op. cit. (see n. 1) 232. Schachermeyr, Die min. Kult. I57, believes that the bullcrania and horns, representing the whole animal, had already been separately brought to Crete during the Neolithikum. 166 Cf. the large pair near the south entrance of the palace of Knossos, Evans, op. cit. (see n. 2) II, i6o, fig. 8i. 167 The last theory probably owed its origin to A. B. Cook, Zeus, Cambridge I914, I, 497ff., but found some echoes in later works, including Persson, op. cit. (see n. 52) 132; Willetts, op. cit. (see n. 97) iII; cf. L. Malten, "Der Stier im Kult und mythischen Bild," Archaologisches Jahrbuch XLIII (I928) goff. Nilsson, op. cit. (see n. I) 231 f.; 373, briefly examines and rejects the evidence concerning a Cretan bull-god. For further literature on the subject see Picard, op. cit. (see n. 37) I99. 168 So far the double axe appears only once, in a wall painting in House AVI, 6, A. S. XIII, P1. VIII, b, and not obviously connected with the bull. 169 G. Glotz, La Civilisation Eg6ene (new ed. ed. by C. Picard and P. Demargne), Paris 1952, 270, speaks of the axe as the fetish of the bull cult. Nilsson's explanation, op. cit. (see n. i) e.g. 229, that the double axe merely entered cult by virtue of its use as an instru- ment of sacrifice loses force in view mainly of the frequent and curious combination in Minoan art of axe with the branch of a tree or even a "sacral knot" as handle. Some examples of such combinations are conveniently collected by Schachermeyr, Die min. Kult. fig. 8o; 88; 9I a-c. 170 A Carian or Lydian word, see e.g. Nilsson, op. cit. (see n.

XIII, 79. 174 Ibid.</page><page sequence="23">Some Light from the East on Cretan Cult Practice 407 reflected by the association of river gods with the bul.175 More particularly the bull was considered a chthonic animal, and as such was closely related with cave cult. In the Satal Hiuyiuk shrines, we saw, the bull's head, fixed above or beside the niche in the east wall, portrayed the animal's intimate association with the cave and with the underworld, for the "cave", below which commonly the bones of the dead were buried, was also an entrance to the world below. In Crete the same held true, for the bull was an important part of cave cult, where he had a function to fulfil in connection with the growth of vegetation,176 and, we may assume, from the nature of cave cult, with death as well. Small wonder, then, that the bull occurs on the Hagia Triada sarcophagus in the scene depicting a cult of the dead ;177 nor is it out of the way to see in the famous Cretan bull games more than a "secular sport",178 but a religious rite which, it has been suggested, formed a part of a drame chtonien.17 Picard cites Greek parallels to support his view which, indeed, finds strength from the clearly chthonic nature of the animal in East and West. In fact, Mellaart's Anatolian discoveries impart the feeling that one is on the threshold to an accurate perception of the Minoan bull's cultic role. The bull, it is true, to Cretans was a sacrificial victim,180 an argument used against the belief in his sacred nature ;181 but he figured in a cult of the dead18 and until we understand the import of the sacrificial scenes - associated with a cult of the dead183 - we are compelled to reserve judgment on their significance in cult.1" Consider, for example, the bull's near relationship with the goddess in the East: the goddes of birth, often his own mother. The bull in gatal Huyuk was not only shown at the moment of birth, but also as a chthonic animal connected with the dead. The cult here and, we believe, in the Cretan cave dealt with the natural cycle of life and death which, in a particular form, survived in Greek myth. What was the significance of the intimate connection between the god- dess and her animal, particularly the bull? May we suggest that the bull, like the goddess' male consort, was born and died every year? There is at present no proof, of course, of such a conjecture, but the bull's connection with the 175 Poseidon's association with the bull, perhaps in Ionia originally, was due to the same reasons, cf. Nilsson, op. cit. (see n. I25) 450; Schachermeyr, Poseidon und die Entstehung des griechischen Gbtterglaubens, Munich 1950, e.g. 45f.; 75. 176 Cf. the tablet from Psychro, showing the horns of consecration together with branches of the tree - see above n.

DIETRICH Divine Child survived strong in Greek tradition. This was the case with the youthful Zeus, mentioned above, who, identified with the Cretan Velchanos, figured on coins from Phaestus and Gortyn together with a bird and the bul.1138 The most striking example of the connection or identification of the bull with the male child and companion of a Great Goddess of nature was, of course, Dionysus. Whatever his country of origin,188 to the Greeks he frequently appeared as tauromorphic187 and his history, preserved in Greek legend, was typically that of the male child and Mother Nature's companion who symbolised the growth and death of vegetation.188 The bull, thus, was a part of the Mother Goddess; her son, in a tradition which in all likelihood survived in Greek religion. His cult was primarily concerned with death, but also probably with birth, and occurred, for the reasons discussed above, in the cave, his cultic rather than natural home.189 The vivid scenes of birth in the Anatolian shrines make it plain above all that there was thought to exist not merely an affinity between the goddess and her animal, but that they might have been identified in such a way that the animal, such as bull or leopard, might have represented or given their shape to her. This is a valuable point, and a hint of proof that the same relationship existed in the case of a particular and common aspect of the nature goddess in Crete and Greece whom Studniczka gave the Homeric title of Potnia Theron.l' The bonds, though, which united goddess and animal were closer than those of a mistress and her servant."" The monstrous Mother Goddess from Shrine All, i, shown on her imperial throne in the act of giving birth, was not merely the mistress of the two feline 186 Such coins are reproduced in Cook, op. cit.

His cult in the West was of long standing, however, for the god was known to the Mycenaeans at Pylos, Chad- wick and Baumbach, op. cit. (see n. 126) I86, and may well have been worshipped by the Minoans, Matz, op. cit. (see n. 37) 67. 187 In Thespiae; IG VII, 1787; Bull. Corr. Hell.

Later images of the god commonly showed him with the horns of the bull: Plutarch, Is. et Os. 364 F; Cornutus, Theol. XXX, 59 (Lang). 188 Semele, bxis mother, signified Earth. This correct etymology was first proposed by Kretschmer, cited by Nilsson, Griechische Feste von religi6ser Bedeutung mit Ausschlu3 der Attischen, Leipzig Igo6, 259; cf. op. cit. (see n. 125) 568, "Diese Etymologie des Namens der Mutter des Dionysos ist sicher."

(see n. 125) 309, is analogous to the male figure -youthful or bearded -shown riding a leopard or bull in statuettes from (atal Hilyik, A. S.

Nonetheless the Anatolian evidence does support the reasonable hypothesis that at least one important aspect of a goddess of nature and vegetation in these cultures consisted in the intimate alliance with her animals, whether these might be the bull, lion, ram or goat, or even bird and snake. Unsolved at present remains the question whether the goddess and her animal were essentially one and the same figure, or if she was thought to be attended by a companion. We have seen evidence to favour both beliefs. To this we may add, on the one hand, the numerous figurines and representations of half-animal half-human hybrids, like the statuette from the Patso cave of a bronze animal with a human head.'95 These mixtures, however, generally were classed among the Minoan daemons'96 who held an uncertain position in cult, where they functioned as servants rather than deities in their own right . More persuasive are the many examples of animals embodying the Minoan goddess and shown on her head or about her: she was thought to appear to her worshippers in animal form. The most common epiphany of the deity was in the shape of a bird.'98 But the goddess also appeared as snake,'99 and signif- icantly, we see from one statuette from the eastern repository of the Central Palace Sanctuary at Knossos, in the form of a leopard.200 On the other hand, in many instances in Cretan art the goddess may have been accompanied by her animal.20' In this way perhaps we should interpret the frequent so-called heraldic scenes on Cretan gems depicting a goddess202 flanked by, or grasping, 192 Ibid.

DIETRICH animals.- Two common motifs in this connection show the deity either standing beside her animal or riding it,s similar, in fact, to a number of representations from Vatal Hiyfik.2" Such evidence in East and West makes it impossible to answer conclusively the exact function of the goddess' animal in cult. Perhaps the answer is that no clear distinction was felt to exist between deity and animal. The Anatolian scenes appear to point to such an ambivalence of concept: certainly, in spite of the gap of time, they cast some light not only on the nature of the so-called Mistress of Animals, but also on the type of cult from which she probably arose."' It remains to mention the honeycomb pattern, butterflies and chrysalises painted on the east wall of the First Shrine (first and second phase) in Level VI at 1:atal Hilytik (EVI, 8)207. These designs raise two points of interest: firstly the apparent connection of the bee and butterfly, two insects whose life cycles from closed cell to bee, and from chrysalis to fully grown butterfly seem to be portrayed here.20 The second point concerns the part these scenes played in the ritual or myth of the cult. The development from lifeless cell or chrysalis to the insect imaginatively depicts the interconnection between life and death, the birth of one from the other, so that we are not surprised to find the paintings on the east wall of the shrine with its symbolism of death and the underworld described above. In Minoan and Greek belief, too, the bee was associated with life and death, and Mellaart cites some examples of this belief,20' s Nilsson, op. cit. (see n. I) 357ff. and figs. 168-74, and the famous seal of the "Mother of the Mountains" from Knossos, fig. 162. 2 See e.g. the sealings from the Temple Repositories at Knossos, Evans, op. cit.

The concept of the riding goddess in Greek belief was not, however, confined to Europa, but recurs in the case of Aphrodite Ephippus and Epitragia, and deserves, together with the concept of the often youthful Potnios, a separate treatment. For the riding Aphrodite see Dietrich, op. cit. (see n. 37) xo6 n. 3.

There is, of course, no evidence in Crete and Mycenae linking butterfly with bee, but this we may gather from the fact that in Greek and quite generally in Aegean belief both insects, like the snake, represented the dead or perhaps, as Picard and others believe, the soul of the dead.217 Often, indeed, intentionally or not, the Minoan artist did not make himself clear when he fashioned or engraved on rings, disks or scales an insect whose species could puzzle the entomologist.218 Perhaps the precise species was of less concern to the artist 210 Although we have it recorded as late as Antoninus Liberalis I9. 211 Nilsson, op. cit.

These small disks were sewn or stuck on to the garments of the dead of both sexes - Matz, ibid. 128. Add to these the six bees of gold foil used to adorn a burial gown, and found in I962 by Marinatos in Peristeria, near Pylos, - cited by Zafiropulo, op. cit. (see n. 7) n. I2I. Zafiropulo enthusiastically identifies the omphalos and its design at Delphi with a beehive and honeycomb, and he believes that the tholos tombs in Greece owed their shape to the fact that "distinguished persons had them- selves buried - as their god was buried - in beehive tombs etc.", ibid. 40. 217 Op. cit. (see n. 37) 214. 218 A good example of this difficulty occurs on the Ring of Nestor-Evans, J. H. S. XLV (1925) 55, fig. 47; op. cit.

DIETRICH than the fact that the butterfly, bee, or similar creature, symbolised the rebirth from death, like Aristaeus' swarm of bees which miraculously appeared from the carcass of a bullock."'9 Now, since Schliemann and Evans,220 the butterfly, discovered on grave adornments described above, has frequently been identified with the soul of the dead on analogy with modern Cretan folklore. Moreover some gold models of balances with a butterfly engraved on each scale, which were recovered from the Third Shaft Grave at Mycenae, have been cited as examples of a Minoan and Mycenaean belief in a psychostasia."21 Butterflies occur frequently in Cretan art, 22 but they do not, as Nilsson points out,'" obviously refer to a cult of the dead. The single exception so far seems to be the ring of Nestor" which, however, is of doubtful authenticity. Again we may hesitate to accept that the Minoan or Mycenaean believed in the existence of the soul, a concept which developed relatively late in Greek thought; and it must be remembered that Aristotle was the first authority to use the word 4uxz in the sense of butterfly or moth."2 There is not much weight, then, in an identification of soul with butterfly in Bronze Age Crete. Nilsson suggests'" that the association of butterfly and soul or spirit of the dead arose not before the sixth century B.C., and then from the prevalent idea that the eidolon perhaps of the dead was represented as any winged creature. We may suppose, however, that, prior to this time, the bee and butterfly stood in some relationship to the dead in a belief which traced back for many generations. Such insects, as well as chrysalises and honeycomb, in burial gifts cannot always be accounted for as articles of use :"7 occasionally their religious import is apparent. The key to their probable meaning, and this was already noticed by Evans,"' lies in the presence of the pupae from which the insects were destined to be born."'

The upper left span of the ring shows two female figures in conversation, above whom float chrysalises and insects identified for Evans as butterflies by an entomologist, and for Nilsson - op. cit.

They played no part in any philosophical concept con- cerned with afterlife, nor did they, in the manner of the Greek Mysteries, express the promise of life after death. The chrysalis and honeycomb presumably rather figured in the type of cult observed in the Anatolian shrines, as in the Cretan caves, and perhaps in some domestic sanctuaries dealing with the eternal cycle of nature. There is no doubt about the significance of the honeycomb pattern, butterflies, chrysalises, etc. in the Anatolian shrine. Their help in interpreting the equivalent symbols in Crete and Mycenae is invaluable: surely the chrysalis or honeycomb in the grave essentially carried the same message as the wall paintings in the shrine at Satal H-uyiik, or the "flower-like" emblem from the same pattern shown affixed to the "charnel houses" at the Anatolian city."4 Such evidence is proof of the enormous age, well antedating Minoan culture,231 of the symbolic representation of the birth of life from death.'3' Rhodes University, Grahamstown B.
