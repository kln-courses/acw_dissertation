<plain_text><page sequence="1">BELIEFS AND ATTRIBUTES, GERSHON WEILER IN a philosophical paper the point one wishes to make should be stated at the very outset. And in dealing with a problem which is as controversial as religion, the bias should be confessed before any points are made. I want to conform at once to both these requirements. I want to discuss beliefs, ordinary beliefs but mainly religious ones, for the expression of which, oddly enough, we use the same word. "Belief" and "Faith" are admittedly different in English, but many languages possess only one word for these and further I shall try to show that even in English the difference is not very great and that they have, if not the same, at least a very similar logical grammar. The point of my argument is that beliefs can be discussed rationally and that they should be so discussed. Religious arguments have been going on for a very long time, and I find it incredible that people of immense intellectual qualities, who devoted their time and energy to these discussions, have been working under a simple delusion, not understanding the very nature of the thing they were doing. I cannot believe that theology is one great mistake, even if we admit that the whole structure hangs on a hook, which demands a non-rational justification. People who argue for religion wanted to say something true, which they believed can be proved true. Also I find it odd, to say the least, that some philosophers say that to believe in the religious sense of the word is to be fond of telling certain specified stories in a certain earnest tone of voice and though these stories commit us to a way of life they do not commit us to the truth of the stories themselves. I imagine that some people who are sincere believers must find this a shocking description of their state of mind. Some great religions have endeavoured to prove their case rationally and I shall attempt in this paper to take them as seriously as I can. This is where my bias comes into play. I think I have reason to believe that religious arguments in the past have not been futile but extremely useful. Though I am no believer, I still believe that arguments about religion in the past have brought about a considerable change in people's beliefs. I This is a revised version of a paper read before The Jowett Society in Oxford in Trinity Term I958. I wish to thank Father A. Kenny and Miss E. Anscombe, who were good enough to comment on my paper on that occasion. My thanks are due also to Professor Furlong for his critical remarks. If the present version is an improved one, this is due largely to their criticism. I need hardly say that they are in no way responsible for the views presented here. i96</page><page sequence="2">BELIEFS AND ATTRIBUTES The very question "what constitutes a religious problem or argu- ment" has been always determined by factors which were not wholly religious, i.e. by the whole outlook of the age. Historically speaking, many of the disputes we should take for scientific or political ones, were religious disputes in their time. Was the issue between Galileo and Cardinal Bellarmine a scientific or a religious one? One could say that religious arguments have, among others, the extremely important function of delimiting the field of the religious itself. The thoughts I am presenting here are rather sketchy. The main limitation of the paper is that it implicitly commits the same mistake as most recent discussions about religion commit. I mean the habit of arguing about the meaning of the sentence "I believe in God" and to take this as exhausting the range of religious attitudes. At least I want to say very clearly, that I know that much more has to be said. (Added in proof) Walter Kaufmann's Philosophy and the Critique of Religion and Ninian Smart's Reasons and Faiths which appeared since this paper was completed, are important contribu- tions in just this respect. I should like these thoughts to be taken not as a comprehensive account of a full-scale battle but as a re- connaissance report compiled on the basis of patrol-warfare on the borders. The interior of the land remains unexplored. I shall argue that all statements of the type "I believe in . entail at least one statement of the sort "I believe that . . . Further, statements of the second type can be rationally discussed, i.e. even if they cannot be conclusively established or refuted by experience, yet experience is highly relevant to their truth-value. That this is how religious philosophers of the past understood the matter, will be another point. This line of argument, I hope, will cut the ground from under very much recent talk, which through using up-to-date analytic methods, tries to save via proofs of mean- ingfulness the truth of theological statements. I feel that these recent attempts, though very illuminating, are hardly better than any other expression of intellectual discomfort, and the person who has least reason to welcome these manipulations with religious language is the believer (or the traditional theologian) who is defended in this sort of way. He might well say: "God protect me from my friends, I shall somehow manage my enemies." But, as Mr. Mitchell so frankly puts it in the Introduction to his collection of essays, Faith and Logic, the "objector" or "critic", who is argued against in the papers collected in that volume, is nobody but the writer's analytic ego, who struggles with his religious ego. All this seems to come dangerously near to the revival of the "double-truth" theory, in a more sophisticated, post-Wittgensteinian form. It is not by chance that the Church condemned the doctrine about the I97</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHY "double-truth" and disliked the "triumph of faith" achieved at the expense of leaving all rational arguments to philosophy. Believers today should feel as embarrassed by this ally as the Church then felt about its predecessor. And philosophers should not forget that Leibniz opened his Theodicy with an attack on the "double-truth" doctrine, presupposed by the triumph of faith over reason. I propose to take a rather roundabout route before I come back to talk about this view. But I hope that after this historical detour much of what has to be said will hardly need saying. II If I say "I believe in God", I use the word "God" as a proper name. It is hardly necessary to recapitulate the radical changes which have occurred in our logical notion of proper names. It is a long, and well-known way from Mill, who allotted denotation but not connotation to proper names, to Mr. Strawson, who executed the last surviving member, the logically proper name, of that once great family. That we know on what occasions to use a proper name, or the word "this" for that matter, shows that we know something about that which is being referred to, i.e. some description was concealed in the name. The fact that these descriptions were con- cealed and were not straightaway specifiable gave rise to theories of proper names, which today are recognized as fallacious. Mr. Searle in Mind I958 has brought out very clearly how it comes about that concerning a certain name we might entertain a host of propositions, then deny some which we affirmed before or vice versa, without having the feeling that we had changed the meaning of the name. As Wittgenstein said in Philosophical Investigations, ? 79, "I use the name N without a fixed meaning", i.e. if one or more of the propositions which I believed about N to be true turn out to be false, I can fall back upon other propositions, but if I reject all propositions about N, then I have no use any more for that name: it is turned into a mere noise. One feels inclined to say that only the post-Wittgensteinian account of proper names has enabled us to see what lurked behind the endless arguments of the Middle Ages concerning God and His attributes. But, while it is true to say that this account allows us a greater insight, it is certainly untrue to say that the medievals did not themselves see the import of the problem. The question was: which attributes can be truly predicated of God? Or in alterna- tive form: if nothing is predicated of God, is the word "God" still a word, or is it not a mere noise? I shall say something about the attempt of Maimonides (and partly of Aquinas) to deal with this question, but in a systematic i98</page><page sequence="4">BELIEFS AND ATTRIBUTES and not historical manner. I mean that I shall discard as much as I can of the Aristotelian terminology, in which these arguments were formulated. Also, it is worth pointing out that our discussion is that of mono- theistic language, and the arguments used by these philosophers are valid, if at all, only if monotheism is taken for granted. One wonders, whether polytheism which would naturally escape many of their most cogent arguments, could not be made more sense of. If there are many gods, their names would be ordinary proper names, i.e. exhibit the same logical behaviour as "John" or "England", yet be objects of religious worship. Aquinas says (S.T.I., Q. I3, Art. io) that the name "God" is applied to idols on the basis of analogy with God to whom only this name belongs properly speaking-and this is clearly unsatisfactory. Contemporary philosophers who are engaged in analytico-religious apologetics rightly act on the principle "clarification begins at home",-but it would be a mistake to regard even a very good analysis of Christian religious language as a valid analysis of religious language in general. One of the most interesting efforts to make sense of monotheistic language was made by Maimonides in his Guide of the Perplexed. I shall try to show that this effort was not successful, and I hope that it will be obvious that the moral to be drawn from his failure is still relevant to present-day discussions about religion. Maimonides' position can be best understood if we begin by taking account of the presuppositions he made. I take these to be three: (i) The oneness (the uniqueness) of God. (2) Aristotelian logic and theory of science and (3) the truth of the Bible. I shall claim that these three, if taken with all they imply, are inconsistent. But first I should like to say something, very briefly, about each of these points. (i) If God is unique then He has to have a unique name. By "unique name" I do not mean a proper name but rather something like Russell's logically proper name ("this"). Now the obvious candidate for this role would be the Tetragrammaton which was traditionally supposed to have no predicates inherent in it. Maimonides says that the word has no significance and blunders into adding that perhaps originally it conveyed the meaning of "absolute existence". That the Tetragrammaton is inadequate was rightly remarked on by Aquinas " . . . if the name were given to signify God not as to His nature, but as to His su.ppositum accor- dingly as He is considered as this something, that name would be I99</page><page sequence="5">PHILOSOPHY absolutely incommunicable, as for instance the Tetragrammaton among the Hebrews, and this is like giving a name to the sun as signifying this individual thing" (S.T.I., Q. I3, Art. 9). Aquinas's meaning is quite clear: in order to specify something it is not sufficient to point to it but one has to be able to say what sort of thing is being pointed at. Consequently we have to search for a better name, i.e. for a name which is communicable. A name is communicable if something can be predicated of it. If we affix a predicate to a subject then the statement either states that something is the case, i.e. this thing has this property qua accidens or the statement is analytic and it is an explication of the subject, the predicate being necessarily contained in it. The first possibility is ruled out because it would entail that there is something accidental in God and that His nature is not absolutely one and simple. The second possibility, that of tautology (I. 5I) would be permissible, prima facie, as it would state the essence and be an explication of the name only. But there is another objection to it. A tautology, in order to be understandable, must presuppose something as given; if we define a triangle as a certain figure in which such-and-such relations hold between angles and sides, the angles and sides must already be given. But nothing can be given prior to God, His predicates cannot precede Him and it is in terms of these that He should be defined if he could be defined at all. " . . . we use 'one' in reference to God to express that there is nothing similar to Him". We can see here already that Maimonides will be forced to hold a position according to which "God" both is and is not a proper name. (2) The adherence of Maimonides to Aristotelian logic and theory of science was the source of some further difficulties. According to Aristotle scientific statements are universal and affirmative; the Aristotelian substance is an individual thing belonging to a class. His logic is a logic geared to the purpose of expressing class subsumptions. Now there are obvious difficulties in applying this model to God. We saw that predication of God, whether in analytic or scientific statements, is well-nigh impossible. The inconsistency between presuppositions (i) and (2) already shows itself. Maimonides, realizing this, could have reverted to silence as he seems to have been inclined to do when he quoted with approval the Psalm's "Silence is praise to Thee". But he could not take this way out because he accepted presupposition (3). (3) The Bible enumerated certain attributes of God, and Maimon- ides had to take account of them. The predicates of the Bible were 200</page><page sequence="6">BELIEFS AND ATTRIBUTES straightforward: "Merciful, patient, etc." Maimonides quotes the Talmudic saying that "the Torah spoke in human language", which means: in a language not adequate enough from a philosophical point of view. The Bible's predicates are human predicates and consequently they have to be explained away. Maimonides' doctrine of homonyms serves this purpose; his claim is that between, e.g., the application of "just" to God and man, there is nothing in common but the word. The weakness of this position is obvious. In the case of ordinary homonyms we learn the meanings of both words indepen- dently of each other, but what we have here is nothing but a sense transferred from the human realm to the divine. The choice of predicates for God has been made with an eye on human predicates. Maimonides both wants and does not want to retain this association. If he eliminates the connection between the two, then divine predi- cates become meaningless; if he upholds the connection then divine predicates become anthropomorphic. But this is only part of his trouble. What about the status of statements about God? Presupposition (2) demanded of him that he should make universal affirmative statements. This proved impos- sible. To find a way out of this impasse he introduced his celebrated doctrine of negative attributes. Negative attributes should be understood here in the sense of complete exclusion, i.e. in the sense of negatio and not in the sense of privatic. The statement that "the wall does not see" denies something of the wall which does not belong to its nature and is thus negative, while "John does not see" denies something of John which belongs to his nature as a man, and is thus privatio. To say that a wall does not see is a truism and at most can warn us not to commit a category-mistake. According to Maimonides, all affirmative statements about God commit a category-mistake and the function of the negative statements, into which he translates all the predications found in the Bible, is to warn us not to commit that mistake. He claims that all true negative statements about God serve the purpose of guiding the mind to the truths which we must believe about God. Yet he insists that negative predication, in accordance with presupposition (2), is not proper predication, i.e. no number of true negations will help us to understand God in His very essence. Further, a rather paradoxical consequence of this doctrine is that anything can be negated of God with the same logical justification. We saw that in order that a name should be meaningful some predicates must be attached to it. Maimonides' doctrine of predica- tion, proved to be inconsistent with the implication that for him "God" both is and is not a proper name. If one takes his doctrine of homonyms and negative predicates seriously, the conclusion one 201</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHY is forced to is that "God" is not a name at all and is consequently meaningless. The appearance of meaningfulness is retained through the use of homonymous predicates with their ineradicable human associations; but if we make real efforts to get rid of these associa- tions then at most we have created another universe of discourse which we do not know what it is about. So we have failed to fix the reference of "God", because the presuppositions adopted were inconsistent. The Tetragrammaton, our first candidate, is meaningless in itself and if any meaning is attached to it this is due only to the fact that we are told that it refers to the same being as other names of God. And unless one is willing to treat "God" as a class name,' i.e. drop presupposition (i), the reference of "God" cannot be fixed. Some of Maimonides' presuppositions seem to have been accepted by Aquinas. Without claiming to understand all the subtleties of the Summa, I would venture to say the same objection is valid. Aquinas attempted to escape these difficulties by regarding the Divine predicates as analogous to human predicates. He thus tries to steer a middle course between the view that predicates are attached to God univocally and the view (i.e. the one we have considered) that they are attached equivocally. Univocal predica- tion would have meant anthropomorphism, equivocal predication would have meant agnosticism, which is entailed by the doctrine of complete ineffability. But Aquinas' analogy-conception of God's predicates fails for the reason that the notion of "analogy" itself, in the present context, is used analogically. What I mean is this: There is a perfectly good sense of "analogy", in which for example I am entitled to say that situation x is analogous to situation y, provided they are similar in some specifiable respects (and dissimilar in certain others). The necessary and sufficient conditions for my being able to say this meaningfully are not exhausted by the similarity obtain- ing, but only by the fulfilment of the additional condition that I should have knowledge by acquaintance of both x andy. It might be objected that I am setting a condition which is very rarely satisfied even in the case of our more ordinary pieces of knowledge. It might 1 This suggestion was made by Miss Anscombe when I read this paper in Oxford. If polytheism were our universe of discourse, then this theory would be absolutely adequate. But I fail to see how one could maintain it in a monotheistic context unless one was also willing to say that it is a mere accident that there is only one god and not more. Should we claim that it is necessary that there is only one God, i.e. His uniqueness belongs to his essence, then we should have to incorporate the specification of the range of applica- tion in the list of class-defining characteristics. It is one thing to say that extension is determined by intension and quite another that the extension is stated explicitly in the intension. 202</page><page sequence="8">BELIEFS AND ATTRIBUTES be said, and justly, that the greater part of our knowledge is know- ledge by description. Yet, while this seems perfectly true, I would claim that it does not constitute a case against my argument, for the following reasons: (I) It is obvious that when I say that an analogy obtains between x and y, then I have knowledge of x and of y independently of each other. If all I claim to know about y is that it is analogous to x in some respects, then what I am pro- viding as a description of y is nothing but a modified description of x, as I am unable to give the criteria (as I have no knowledge by acquaintance) by which the description of x should be modified just so and not otherwise. The case is that of a transition from one description to claiming that it is another description where this transition is unwarranted. (2) The present case presents an additional difficulty. In the case I considered just now, I took it for granted that the meanings of the terms remained unchanged and I tried to show that, even in this case, it is illegitimate to claim that an analogy obtains if there is no reason for supposing y to be what it is supposed to be, beyond the claim that it is analogous to x. But in the present case the analogous character of the terms involved is claimed. Even in cases of knowledge by description, the terms of description have been learnt on acquaintance and not through description. I have learnt how to understand a statement to the effect that an object I have not yet seen, or will never see, is red by being con- fronted with red objects previously, and having learnt the necessary and sufficient conditions for something's being red, the meaning of "red" remaining constant. If the analogy-argument is correct, I should be able to say whether an unseen object is red from having determined the colour of a pillar-box under my window. But this is patently false. If it is predicated of God that He is Good analogically then it is pointless to say that the analogy works as from "good house", to "good man", or to "good work" or what you please, because we have some knowledge of any of these items independently of each other apart from their goodness. But to say that anything is predicated of God analogically entails that there must be at least one thing which is not so predicated, otherwise the reference of the ana- logous predicates cannot be fixed. But I cannot see what sense can be given to the statement that all predicates of God are analogical. If all His predicates are analogical, how can we ever be sure that they are His predicates? If what I have said is so far correct, then we can conclude that no proper account has been given of analogy, and from a logical point of view analogy is not better off than Maimonides' homonyms, for the simple reason that both these attempts at predication fail to provide the reference of the predicates. If it is true that all predication about God has to be taken 203</page><page sequence="9">PHILOSOPHY figuratively or as homonymous, then there is no logical reason why we should not increase the number of predicates as much as we fancy, and whenever one of the predicates we produce is challenged, we can always reply (almost in the exact words of Maimonides): "Ah, but you should not take it literally. As a matter of fact there is nothing in common between the ordinary and divine sense of the same-sounding word, but the name." So, this doctrine lands us in a logical jungle. Nor does it seem to me that Aquinas helps us very much when he says that the predication represents the divine substance in an imperfect manner. What "imperfect" stands for, seems to be nothing more than the admission that we do not know God's nature. When Aquinas ends the 8th Article (Q. I3) with saying: "Thus the name God signifies the divine nature, for this name was imposed to signify something existing above all things, the principle of all things, and removed from all things; for those who name God intend to signify all this"-we feel that he has switched to another language. III I should like to suggest that although the doctrine of ineffability is to be found intermingled with the views I have discussed so far, yet it is a logical consequence of the difficulties these views contain. In order to give meaning to "God" we have to attach predicates to it. But the only predicates we have, are human predicates and this fact landed us in a muddle. Yet, the God who is believed in has to have some predicates, otherwise there will be nothing to believe. The ineffability of God was offered as an escape-route from the difficulties we encountered. Human predicates break down when employed in connection with God and now a new set of predicates is introduced, the content of which is that ordinary predication is out of place here. I do not think much harm can come from labelling these "second-order-negative predicates", for the sake of familiarity. Maimonides himself quotes with approval Psalm lxv. 2 "Silence is praise to Thee" and adds: "It is a very expressive remark on this subject, for whatever we utter with the intention of extolling and praising Him, contains something that cannot be applied to God and includes derogatory expressions; therefore silence and intellectual reflection are more becoming" (I. 59). The negative predicates of Maimonides may be interpreted as the first step towards the ineffability doctrine, which came to maturity with the ascendence of Latin, as in Hebrew they cannot be constructed so elegantly. The Fourth Lateran Council declared: "We firmly believe .., that there is only one true, Eternal, immense, immutable, incomprehensible, 204</page><page sequence="10">BELIEFS AND ATTRIBUTES omnipotent and ineffable God, the Father and Son and Holy Ghost." That this new set of predicates has this double role of serving as a predicate and negating all predicability is expressed concisely by Stace (Time &amp; Eternity, pp. 48-9) thus: " . . . that He is, in His very nature unconceptualizable, that His Mystery and incomprehensibility are absolute attributes of Him." Mr. Alston, in The Philosophical Review (October I956) has shown, how expressions like "unconceptualizable", "ineffable", etc., were generated from the illegitimate extension of the meanings of words like "unbeatable", "unspeakable", etc. The latter have a legitimate use in certain specified circumstances, but their extensions leave behind them all specifications and qualifications and their range of application becomes so universal that we do not know what their application is. We could say that for the use of predicates like "ineffable" syntactical but not semantical rules were given. We know what their position in the sentence should be, but we do not know what subject or subjects they should be attached to. In order to know this, we have to know some other predicates about the subject, which say something about its nature. But if "God" is the subject of predicates of the ineffable-set only, how can we ever be sure even of their being attached to the same subject? Predicates generally serve to point out certain characteristics, which we choose to pick. But it is more than odd to pick on the characteristic that no charac- teristic can be picked out. If we say of a man that he is "nondescript", we do not characterize him, rather we say that he is perfectly ordinary, average, etc., and he is hard to describe, and this is why no police-inspector would think that he has done a proper job if he has put up a poster saying "Wanted, a nondescript person, suspected of murder". If we wonder what an un-birthday present is, we wonder because we are in the habit of picking on birthdays and not on un-birthdays. Yet, we know what a birthday is and what a present is, and our half-way understanding of the expression "un- birthday present" is due to the fact that "present" remained undisturbed by the oddity of affixing "un-birthday" to it. But in the case of God there is nothing to fall back upon. If we want to know who or what is the subject to which the predicate "ineffable" is attached, it will help us precious little if we add that it is the same which is also "unconceptualizable", "immutable" and "incom- municable". But we should not forget that the ineffability-doctrine is a logical escape-device. The predicates of the ineffable-set did not supersede all others. Predicates like "good", "just" are used simultaneously with predicates of the ineffable-set. According to Aquinas "just" is predicated of God analogically literally, whereas "angry" only metaphorically, the reason being that "angry" implies imperfection. 205</page><page sequence="11">PHILOSOPHY But this further implies that "perfection" itself is both a predicate and a rule for the application of further predicates. Having discussed ineffability, we hardly need to stop to point out that "perfection" or "perfect" are predicates which have a perfectly good use in certain specified contexts, but if the limitations imposed by the context are removed, they slip into the ineffable-set. A "perfect x" is perfect qua an x, and we have to have some further knowledge about the nature of x, in order to be able to judge it an x at all or a perfect specimen of its sort. One feels like saying here that a subject of which all the perfections and only perfections are predi- cated, is really incomprehensible. ("The perfections of God are those of our souls, but He possesses them in a boundless measure" -Leibniz.) I have tried to show, so far, that as "God", syntactically at least, is a proper name, any meaningful discourse in which it occurs necessitates predication. I have argued that the homonyms of Maimonides, the analogies of Aquinas, the doctrines of ineffability and perfection-all suffer from some serious logical defect. All these attempts try, in one way or another, to satisfy the requirements of predication while escaping it. I did not imply that statements about God are meaningless, only that whenever such statements are made, their meaning should be specified. The demonstration of the breakdown of the traditional doctrines was not intended to prove more than: (i) that theologians intended their statements to be meaningful and were at pains to prove them to be so and that (2) the meaningfulness of God-statements should not be taken for granted without further scrutiny. This, indeed, is the starting point of a rational discussion, for which this paper is a plea. I shall elaborate on this in the next, and last, section. IV I turn, at last, to the discussion of beliefs or more exactly the nature of statements "I believe in X" or "I believe that p". The importance of predicates, which have occupied us so far, is too obvious in this context to need elaborating. "I believe in Bigo" does not reveal very much. "Bigo" is not an English word nor the name of anyone I know. Consequently my saying that I believe in Bigo is saying nothing, the sentence has no application. In order that my saying that I believe in God should be meaningful, "God" has to be more specified than "Bigo". This is where predicates come in. But once they are in, our statements can be transformed into "I believe that God. . . ". If I say meaningfully "I believe in God" then my saying so entails at least one statement of the "I believe that . . . " sort. 206</page><page sequence="12">BELIEFS AND ATTRIBUTES What is the advantage of this transformation? What do we gain by asking the believer to translate his statement of belief into the "that"-form? One advantage would be that we would come face to face with the predicate or predicates which were concealed in the subject. The "that" phrase brings it out. There are predicates of the "just-set" and the "ineffable-set", and I do not wish to say that these two sets are either mutually exclusive or jointly exhaus- tive. There might be others, which I have not discussed. But what- ever logical type the predicates belong to, the "that"-phrase would bring it out. Suppose someone says "I believe that God is beyond comprehension". We can ask "What else do you believe about Him"? If he says "nothing else", then we shall have a good mind to say to that person: "You do not believe anything at all." Or let us take a dispositional predicate like "just". If someone believes that God is just then he expects certain types of events to take place or alternatively he will shape his notion of justice in such a way that it should be in accordance with the events. It should not be unduly worrying that the person who believes in God's justice cannot give a definite list of expected future events, as the cash value of his belief. In order that his statement should be meaningful, it should allow that it should be contrasted with some- thing. So, if he takes the second alternative I mentioned, then any event might be in line with this belief in divine justice, but this position would require him to take the position according to which there is nothing in common between divine justice and human justice, and we saw already where all this takes us. Maimonides defines "faith" or "belief" as the conviction which comes after the apprehension, and which consists in the conviction "that the thing apprehended has its existence beyond the mind exactly as it is conceived in the mind" (I. 50). But here some clearing up has to be done. Much is made of the distinction between "faith" and "belief". Dr. Waismann argued that it is sensible to say that I believe in Maxwell's equations but I cannot have faith in them. But can't I? In certain specified contexts, in extreme situations in which very much is at stake, it might be quite natural to say so. Can any criterion be given which sorts out the cases in which the one word is applicable but not the other? I do not think so. Apart from that it is an accidental fact about the English language that there are two words. Neither Hebrew nor German makes the distinction. According to the definition given by Maimonides the distinction cannot be made. But it is doubtful whether a distinction is desirable at all. It is interesting to talk about faith only because it is a case of belief and beliefs can be justified or unjustified. If we restrict the meaning of "faith" to "Confidence, reliance, trust" (Sh.O.E.D.) as a state of mind not 207</page><page sequence="13">PHILOSOPHY involving any belief in the truth of any proposition, then (provided the restriction of meaning could be carried out), the discussion of it would be quite pointless. My state of mind of being in love offers no occasion for argument, but the question "will she make a good wife?" does. By now it will be apparent how old-fashioned my arguments are and that so is my whole approach. I want to prevent the believer from having recourse to the subterfuge of the irrational. Of course, I do not wish to say that there is no irrational element in religion. Not only religion but our every-day life, our ordinary language included, is irrational in some respects. But the very fact that the believer tries to make converts shows that there is also a rational element in it. And the whole history of theology shows that the believer does want to say something rational. Nothing is said unless it is said in an understandable way. There are no beliefs without attributes and attributes are part of our ordinary language. Nobody could deny this and remain consistent, without also implying the possi- bility of private language. Be that as it may, there is no doubt that some mystics thought so, but their beliefs, if they still qualify for the name, could not become doctrines. There is no religion without communication. Aquinas, among the many arguments he uses against Rabbi Moyses' (i.e. Maimonides) negative doctrines, says that negations in themselves will not do as negations are understood only on the basis of affirmations and if we did not know something about God positively, we could not deny anything about Him either. And against the view that all predicates attached to God are used only in the secondary sense, he argues that this view " . . . is against the intentions of those who speak of God" (S.T., Q. I3, Art. 2). The point of Aquinas and of the present paper is that religious language though partially allegorical, figurative, etc., defeats its own ends if it is wholly so. Otherwise no argument will be possible and in the absence of the possibility of an argument there is no room for truth and falsity. And I cannot help regarding it as a very poor evasion of the issue, if it be replied that "truth" itself is to be understood here in a special sense. There are special senses only on the background of non-special ones, with which they retain some considerable similarity of logical behaviour. It might seem that while I am at pains to assert that religious language, notably statements expressing beliefs, cannot have a meaning which is totally different from the ordinary, I commit the other mistake in making these statements altogether identical with statements of ordinary discourse. I hope that this position does not necessarily follow from my argument. If it were true that belief-statements are like ordinary factual statements, then it would 208</page><page sequence="14">BELIEFS AND ATTRIBUTES be also true, or so at least it seems at first sight, that their truth or falsity could be conclusively settled. The notoriously non-conclusive character of religious arguments might well be mainly responsible for the view that they do not involve truth and falsity in the ordinary sense. But how then can we make sense of the assertion that religious arguments or statements of belief are to be understood, at least partially, in their near-ordinary or ordinary sense and yet we cannot settle conclusively their truth or falsity? I think this puzzle can be resolved. It owes its life to the all-too-dogmatic conception of the nature of ordinary discourse, which holds that statements about fact are decidable. In order to see how mistaken this view is, we need not even go into an analysis of the notion of "fact". The view in question breaks down on the most unsophisticated account of fact. Is the dispute about the Budget between the Tories and Labour decidable? If not, why not? It will not at all do to say that the factual statements they make in debating are really disguised evaluative statements. If that were the case, we could have great fun watching how they expose each other's disguised evaluations; there might be even some jobs for philosophy graduates, trained in exposing, at both Party headquarters. Is the issue about the H-bomb decidable? Is a legal argument, which is perhaps a paradigm case of a rational argument, not decided, in the last resort, on the basis of the hierarchy of courts of law, a fact completely irrelevant to the particular case which is being judged upon? Or, to speak more pro domo, is the Israeli-Arab issue decidable? It might be argued that they are not decidable because they are matters of policy or commitments to a certain policy. And it might be argued that as religion involves a commitment, no argument about the truths of religion can be conclusive. It seems, on this possible view, that I do commit myself to a policy and stick to it, no matter what is the case. If this view is correct then the irrationalist could prove his case with the help of my examples. But, fortunately, it is not correct. We have learnt from that admirable symposium on Falsification in the Flew-MacIntyre volume, that no definite number of events necessitates the falsity of a religious belief. But this does not at all mean that events are not relevant to the question of truth and falsity of these beliefs. Suppose that more and more facts will be produced against a certain policy. It is quite possible that none of these facts, when stated, will entail the falsity of the pre- suppositions underlying the policy in question. Yet, if the number of unfavourable facts is increasing, the policy will be slowly abandoned. Some diehards will continue to say their piece and derive intellectual comfort from the fact that while doing this they are not contra- dicting themselves. But that will hardly help the policy to success. 0 209</page><page sequence="15">PHILOSOPHY And in fact, religious beliefs behave historically in a way similar to policies. There are, of course, differences as, e.g., the fact that in policies I generally want something or achieve something, while this does not seem to hold in all, though admittedly it does in some, cases of religious belief. But it behaves like a policy in being a species of a kind of rational argument. Religious beliefs have been abandoned when arguments in a sufficiently large number were produced against them. They were not abandoned from a logical necessity, but because it seemed reasonable to do so. It would not be self-contradictory to adhere to a discredited belief, but unreason- able. How was the belief in Hell abandoned? Not through proving that it is a conclusion which does not follow from some accepted premises, but rather through coming to think that, in view of other things we know or believe, it is unlikely to be true. In fact, that some philosophers took refuge in the other-language or double-truth theory in connection with the nature of religious discourse (the view I have tried to combat), is due to some rational arguments which these philosophers found it unreasonable to reject. Philosophy and religion used to be thought to be incompatible. They were competing in the same line of business, i.e. the drawing up of a total world-picture. Professor Ryle describes how "the fires of philosophical theology and anti-theology were already burning low by the last decade or two of nineteenth century", and how they were out in the twenties. But if philosophers lost their interest in religion in the hey-day of Logical Atomism, they have regained it in the present day. And philosophy never became an indifferent affair for the religious. Documents like the Humani generis show quite clearly that the Roman Church, for example, is of the opinion that certain modern doctrines contradict the doctrines of the Church. Philosophers still feel uncomfortable about metaphysics, though they are willing to allow that there might be something in it. And even on the current minimum-notion of metaphysics, as a "new way of looking at the world", it should be seen that philosophy and religion cannot meet in brotherly embrace on the bosom of Mother Analysis. Religion is a way of looking at the world too, and we cannot look from two points of view simultaneously. What I have tried to say is that we can look at religion from the point of view of analytic philosophy, but this should not be interpreted as its acceptance, as indeed they are incompatible.
