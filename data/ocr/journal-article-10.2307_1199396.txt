<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION godhead. The church which regards itself as revelation instead of a wit- ness to revelation has begun the steep descent of all the other fallen angels; if Christ is its head it will say with its head, "If I bear witness of myself my witness is not true," and with Christ point to God. Morally the doctrine is dangerous, since it puts the church in the same class with all the other overly self-conscious communities in the world who are afraid to die lest there be no resurrection from the dead, and who therefore regard self-defense (cf. pp. I83 f.) as the first law of life. That Dr. Morrison does not really mean what, in his great indignation against modern heresies, he has allowed himself to say with such force, his occasional references to the right orientation of the church as orienta- tion toward God through Christ indicate. H. RICHARD NIEBUHR Yale University Is God Emeritus? By SHAILER MATHEWS. New York: Macmillan Co., I940. ix+93 pages. $I.50. In his book, entitled The Growth of the Idea of God, published about ten years ago, Dean Shailer Mathews depicted religion as a help-gaining personal adjustment to those personality-producing, personally re- sponsive, personally conceived activities of the cosmos which the word "God" represents. Accordingly, when in 1931 I wrote the Editorial Preface to Religious Realism, I ventured to say that Dr. Mathews might very well have been included among the exponents of the position de- fended in that volume of composite authorship. Referring to this state- ment of mine, Professor Aubrey (in his excellent review of the progress of Dean Mathews' thought in The Process of Religion [I933]) made the comment that, since for Dr. Mathews religious adjustment to the cosmic environment does not require any metaphysical decision as to what that environment is in itself, "it would seem that D. C. Macintosh is mis- taken in welcoming Dean Mathews as an epistemological realist." Cor- respondence with Dean Mathews on the subject confirmed me in my original understanding of his position, as coming within my definition of religious realism. An invitation from the editor of this Journal to review Dr. Mathews' latest little book-which he facetiously entitles Is God Emeritus?-gives me the opportunity, incidentally, of clearing up this little difference of opinion as to how, from the point of view of re- ligious epistemology, Dean Mathews is to be classified. Dean Mathews confesses that he is one of those who are held by "the ineradicable conviction that God exists." But he thinks the time I92</page><page sequence="2">CRITICAL REVIEWS has come when, even for Christianity, the pattern in which God is con- ceived must be changed. Social behavior is constantly changing, and patterns of religious thought drawn therefrom tend to become obsolete; hence religion needs not only to change its thought-patterns from time to time but also to seek to discover "what reality the word God represents which is more than the patterns of thought drawn from social behavior." "God must represent activity that is beyond doubt." This something more which indubitably exists is to be found in "the personality-pro- ducing activities in the universe." To recognize such activities is not to say either "that the universe itself is personal or that there is an individual person existing within the universe." According to Dr. Mathews, we may not know the ultimate nature of those activities, but through ex- perience we can learn the conditions under which we can co-operate with them. "Religion is the reciprocal personal relationship of humanity with those personality-producing activities of its cosmic environment with which it is organically related." One might question the appropriateness of the term "reciprocal personal relationship," in view of what seems to be the assumption that the personality-producing activities of the cosmos, the discovery of which rests "on data given by science," are not themselves to be under- stood as being personal. But it is made abundantly clear that for Dean Mathews the term "God" is "interpretative rather than ontological," being "in reality an anthropomorphic conception." Properly understood, the term God projects cosmic reciprocity on the level of personality. By it the personality-furthering process is recognized as re- sponsive to, and furthering the development of personal values through hu- manity .....From such a point of view God is not emeritus ..... Atheism is excluded ..... God is a symbol of an actual reality. I may say at once that I recognize the position of Dean Mathews as falling, like that of Professor Wieman, within a genuine religious realism, on the basis of which an empirical theology may be inductively con- structed. Using the term "divine" as a value term, meaning worthy of absolute devotion, it can be said that there are factors or a factor func- tioning divinely in the field of human observation and experience, es- pecially on the condition of right adjustments on man's part, including the right religious adjustment. This is a verified and verifiable fact, whether the causal factor or factors in question be one or many, personal, impersonal, or superpersonal, and whatever be their relation to the empirical self. Laws of empirical theology may therefore be formulated, and-inasmuch as we can know something of what a factor is from what I93</page><page sequence="3">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION it does-a scientifically modest statement can be made as to what the divinely functioning reality is, even on so metaphysically agnostic a basis as that which Dr. Mathews has professed to favor. Prayer, it is held, "establishes a personal relationship peculiarly sensitive to cosmic re- sponse." (By prayer is meant, here, "a helpful relationship with the personality-producing activities of the universe" rather than "a means of inducing God to meet some specific demand.") And not prayer alone, but morality also, is a way of co-operation with these same cosmic personality-producing activities. My principal criticism of Dr. Mathews' theological method, as of Dr. Wieman's, is that he does not go on to supplement his very meager empirical theology by formulating a system of those mutually consistent and scientifically permissible propositions of religious intuition and faith which can be reasonably taken as literally true. These would constitute what might be called a normative theology, not completely verifiable from the point of view of science, but philosophically defensible as well as religiously essential. Dr. Wieman's failure to do this is not due, I think, to any prejudice against metaphysics, if it be sufficiently empirical, but is due to the fact-if I am not doing him an injustice-that his religious consciousness is not precisely that of Christian theism. The opposite, however, seems to be the case with Dr. Mathews. The re- ligious concepts he has favored throughout the years have been those of Christian theism, but ever since he began the teaching of systematic theology some thirty-five years ago he has distrusted any proposed introduction of metaphysics into theology-choosing, rather, to rest his case for the intellectual respectability of the essential "content of the gospel" upon the meager support afforded by the more or less grudging admissions of naturalistically minded men of science. The final upshot of this procedure in Dean Mathews' case has been that, while religiously realistic with regard to cosmic personality-producing and personality- furthering processes, his position with regard to the Christian idea of God as Spirit-a position which he calls "conceptual theism"-is un- deniably a mere subjective or psychological idealism. This, no doubt, is what Professor Aubrey has in mind when he objects to my classifica- tion of Dean Mathews as an epistemological realist in religion. The personal God of Christian intuition, faith, and theology is for Mathews a mere God-idea, functioning symbolically for the guidance of religious adjustment and for the expression of religious feeling, but not literally true in the sense of representing any actual factor beyond the presumably quite impersonal cosmic processes fundamental to the emergence and I94</page><page sequence="4">CRITICAL REVIEWS development of human personality. His theological subjectivism thus largely undercuts his religious realism, logically at least, and, it is to be feared, for most persons would do so psychologically as well. It would seem that Dean Mathews is hardly entitled, in consistency, to retain even his sadly impoverished "conceptual theism." Strictly speaking, any genuine theism, such as the Christian, must be for him not a theology of faith but rather a theology of make-believe. Concep- tually speaking, he has retired the God of Christian faith from his world- view, allowing him recognition only as a concept whch some other people can still, and he himself could once upon a time, sincerely and believingly use. Logically, for Dr. Mathews the God of "the content of the gospel," "the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ," belongs to an irrecover- able past. One cannot but wonder whether, despite protests to the con- trary, the God of Christian theism can be regarded by Dean Mathews as living enough or real enough to deserve even so mildly respectful a title as that of "emeritus."

Jahrhunderts bis zur Mitte des 15. Jahrhunderts. By JOHANNES HOLLNSTEINER. Freiburg: Herder &amp; Co., I940. $7.50. The Kirsch series of volumes on the history of the church is designed to replace Cardinal Joseph Hergenr6ther's Handbuch der allgemeinen Kirch- engeschichte, the later editions of which were revised by Dr. Kirsch. Vol- umes I and IV of the new series have preceded the present half-volume. Volume II (Part I) and Volume III are still to appear. Hollnsteiner has quite departed from the text of Hergenr6ther, and has retained only a very general resemblance in structure to the former work. The ample lists of source works and studies which accompanied the chapters of Her- genrbther are omitted here. Instead we have at the end of the book a se- lect list of publications since I913, which is arranged by chapters and ex- tends to sixty pages. This is a feature of considerable value to teachers and research students. Although German titles predominate, there are some good selections of books in other languages, and the author has been rea- sonably generous to writers not of his own faith. There are, however, some unaccountable omissions even of German studies. For some chap- I95</page></plain_text>
