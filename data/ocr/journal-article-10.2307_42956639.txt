<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ORIGIN OF DEATH By Rabbi Samuel S. Cohon, Temple Mizpah Chicago Chapter I - Unsuccessful Explanations The Biblical story of the Fall of man bristles with difficulties for both the student of literature and the theo- logian. During the hey-day of Pan-Babylonianism, Dr. Friedrich Delitzsch sought to solve some of them, in his first lectuie on "Babel and Bible." "The serpent again?" he exclaimed. "That has an unmistakable Babylonian ling." Filled with the joy of discovery, he announced triumphantly: "May I lift the veil, may I point to an old Babylonian cylinder-seal (Fig. 47), on which may be seen in the centre, a tree bearing pendent fruit, to the right a man distinguished by his horns, which are the symbol of strength, to the left a woman, both with their hands outstietched toward the fruit, and behind the woman the serpent? Is it not the very acme of likelihood that there is some connec- tion between this old Babylonian picture and the Biblical tale of the Fall of Man?" 1 His shouts of "Eureka" met with no ready response in the hearts of sober scholars. The distinguished Assyriolo- gist, M. Joseph Halevy, found this view groundless. In his opinion, "the man and the woman who are seated opposite each other on the two sides of the t-ee are extend- ing towaïd each other their hands and are not gatheiing the fruit that hangs upon the lower branches of the tree near their feet; and furthermore the undulating line behind the woman is not beyond àll doubt a serpenl."2 Some scholars discovered in the "serpent" behind the woman nothing more than a "meandering line" or "an ornamental 1 Babel and Bible, page 48. 2 Ibid, page 130.</page><page sequence="2">372 JOURNAL OF JEWISH LORE AND PHILOSOPHY division." Confronted by these and other objections, Delitzsch was forced Lo admit in his "Reply to Critics of the First Lecture" that "as to the nature of this serpent, nothing definite can be said so long as we depend upon this pictorial representation alone."3 Referring to the radical disagreement with Delitzsch's claims by Assyriologists like Oppert, Menant, Halevy, and Tiele, Prof. Cornili adds: "No Babylonian text coiresponding to Genesis III has yet been discovered, and if the reader of page 38 of De- litzsch's book imagines that the clay tablet there mentioned containing 'the Babylonian legend of how it came to pass that the first man forfeited the boon of immortality* is the Biblical story of Genesis III 'in much purer and more primitive form,' I have only to say that he is sorely mis- taken."4 At least in this instance Pan-Babylonianism offers no panacea to all Biblical difficulties. Dr. Julian Morgen- stern recently called attention to the fact that "There is hardly a particle of tangible evidence to justify the usual assumption that Babylonian cultural influence became paramount in Palestine long before the Amarna period, and continued to hold sway uninterruptedly, and with but little modification, throughout the national existence of Israel and Judah, and that, during all this time, the Babylonian flood story and other Babylonian myths and legends were well known in Israel. There is not the slightest trace of Babylonian cultural or religious influence before the time of Isaiah, about which time contact with Assyria became practically continuous and constant."5 In keeping with this view, he departs from Gunkel, who considers Upper Messopotamia as the birthplace of the Paradise story. "Palestine," he writes, "and particularly Northern, Israelite Palestine, fulfills all geographic and economic conditions of the story as well, if not better, than any other portion of 3 Ibid, page 158. 4 Ibid, page 133. 8 The Sources of the Paradise Story, Journal of Jewish Lore and Philosophy, Vol. 1, note to pages 233-234.</page><page sequence="3">THE ORIGIN OF DEATH 373 the Semitic world," and fuither, "since this particular creation story is known to us in only the one, Biblical version, which must have been current in Palestine from a very early time, and, as the absence of all confirmatory evidence would seem to indicate, was current in no other country, Palestine may well be regarded as the home-land of this creation story."6 Jastrow has arrived at the same conclusion.7 Sufficient ground exists for divorcing the so-called Paradise story from Babylonian influence. But even if an indisputable connection with or parallel to our narrative were discovered, it would only defer but not solve the prob- lem. We would still want to know what cultural and re- ligious ideas lie back of the story and what is its real pur- pose. for this reason the method of Higher Ciiticism, i. e. of the literary analysis of the Biblical document into its component sources, is as insufficient as the method of the Pan-Babylonians. This has been partly - but far from sufficiently, recognized by Gunkel in his commentary on Genesis and by Dr. Morgenstern in his essay on the Sources of the Paradise Story, and more fully by Sir-James George Frazerin his encyclopedic woiks on the "Belief in Immor- tality" and "Folklore in the Old Testament." Though holding divergent views on the subject, they unite in turning tor the logical explanation of the story of the Fall of Man to the science of social an tin apology. In its light, Genesis II and III together with VI: 1-4 take their place among the myths accounting for the origin of death, common among all peoples in primitive stages of culture. Their views on the subject suffer considerably fiom one-sidedness. Though recognizing the insufficiency of the method of Higher Ciiticism in this instance, Dr. Morgen- stern seeks to solve the problems involved in the text by proceeding to separate the second Creation Story of Gen. II from the Garden Story, and, following Gunkel, to divoice 6 Ibid, pp. 114-115. 7 Cited by Dr. Morgenstern, ibid.</page><page sequence="4">374 JOURNAL OF JEWISH LORE AND PHILOSOPHY the Tree of Life motif from that of the Tree of Knowledge. He founds his theory upon the contradictory views which these sources present "of the purpose of man and of his first nature" as well as "of the character of agricultural labor." But these are not so unharmonizable as Dr. Morgenstern thinks.8 Regarding as he does the Tree of Life motif as a subordinate element "which was inserted only after the two original stories had been combined by a late Jahvist writer"9 he, in reality means to cut the Gordian knot instead of untying it. 8 For example, Dr. Morgenstern writes: "As Gunkel (13), following Rashi, maintains, II: 24 undoubtedly implies sexual relationship between man and wife." The domestic animals which were first brought to Adam proved unsuitable for that purpose, while the woman fulfilled the requirements. Though noting the dissenting views of Holzinger and Ehrlich, he proceeds to find a contradiction in Gen. II: 25 and III: 7 which "imply that at first the man and the woman lived in complete, childlike ignorance of sexual differences and functions." Without taking the trouble to establish the truth that II: 24 expresses the idea of sexual relationship rather than of marriage as a social fact*, by which men separate from their parents and become attached to their wives, he makes this unsubstantiated hypothesis the basis of a further unharmonizable difference in the two sources. He states that while the Creaťon Story assumes that "sexual union was the normal and fundamental condition of existence, and began already at creation" seeming to imply that child-birth, also, was normal and natural and designed by God, "The Garden Story, on the contrary, with its assump- tion that sexual union was an abnormal condition, not at all consonant with the divine plan of existence, must have implied also that God had not intended that children should be born." Frankly it must be ad" mitted that the author of the story of the Fall of Man was no such logician. In his simple and naive manner, he endeavored to account for the origin of several unpleasart realities of life, without realizing that his explanations have not fully escaped inconsistencies, the common danger of thinkers high and low. Further, his story does not warrant Dr. Morgenstern to conclude that "child-birth is a part of woman's punishment." Genesis III: 16 regards not child-birth itself, but the pain of childbirth together with the wife's subordination to her husband, as the woman's punishment for eating the fruit of the forbidden tree. ♦Dr. Morganstern quotes Robertson Smith's view to this effect, in Kinship and Marriage in Early Arabia, 67ff; and dismisses it on insufficient grounds.

Frazer is therefore justified in turning away from these artificial distinctions between presumably different accounts of the Fall. Though his own reconstruction of Genesis III. showing it to be an "abridged version of this savage myth" does not carry conviction, his method of dealing with the problem appears to be sound, and his sur- vey of the field of legend and myth most helpful in clearing up the spirit of the Biblical passages under discussion. The materials which he amassed in his volumes, substan- tiate his view, which is shared by scholars like Tylor, Brinton, Haitland, Toy, and others, that the primitive man refuses to accept death as a cardinal form of existence. The notion of cosmic law and order, of cause and effect, of growth and decay, is foreign to his mind. Hence he re- gards death as a malicious trick of an enemy, or as a sad blunder. His myths dealing with the mystery of death, assume that man would have enjoyed the bliss of deathless- ness, if it had not been for some disastrous mistake or crime. In some instances, the most trivial incidents suffice to account for human mortality. A few of these typical examples will prove helpful to us. The Zulus tell that in the beginning, Unkulunkulu, the Old Old One, sent the chameleon to men, with the message: "Let not men die." Unfortunately the messenger moved slowly, loitering on the way to eat the purple berries of the ubukwehezane tree, (or as others maintain, he climbed up a tree to bask in the sun, filled his belly full of flies, and fell asleep). In the meantime, Unkulunkulu changed his mind, and charged the lizard to proclaim: "Let men die." The lizard lost no cime. He passed the dawdling chame- leon, and arrived first among men, with the message of mortality. When the lizard was gone, the chameleon arrived with the message of immortality, but the people refused to believe him after hearing the first words. Thus through the lizard, death came to men.10 In some ver- 10 Frazer, Belief in Immortality, pp. 60-63.</page><page sequence="6">376 JOURNAL OF JEWISH LORE AND PHILOSOPHY sions, the thrush takes the place of the lizard. In others, the lizard is replaced by the hare. Still other messengers are introduced. Thus the dog and the frog, the frog and the duck, or the dog and the sheep, figure as the death- bringing creatures. Sometimes the blame is attached to the sheep and the goat, or to the insect and the hare. Occasionally the tortoise or the chameleon takes the place of the hare.11 In other stories of the origin of death, the waxing and waning moon plays an important role. In these phenomena of the lunar orb, the primitive philosophers beheld the cheerful emblem of immortality; and inferred that under a happier fate, man might have been immortal like the moon, undergoing an endless cycle of death and resurrection. The Hottentots claim that once the moon commanded the hare to announce to men: "As I die and rise to life again, so shall you die and rise to life again." For some reason the hare perverted the message, and said: "At, I die and do not rise to life again (evidently referring to himself), so you shall die also and not rise to life again." In other stories, the moon uses different messengers, with the same tragic result. The Fijians relate that once upon a time, the moon contended that men should be like himself (for the Fijians, the moon seems to be a male), that just as he ages, vanishes, and disappears, so men grown old, should disappear for a while, and then come back to life. But the rat, who is a member of the Fijian Pantheon, registered his strong opposition, and insisted that men should perish like rats. And he won the dispute.12 The Eskimos of Greenland implicate the sun with the moon in causing mortality. They say that in the beginning, there were two brothers, one of whom suggested that "There shall be night and there shall be day, and men shall die one after another." The second one insisted that "There shall be no day but only night all the time, and men shall live forever." After a long struggle, the lover of 11 Ibid., also Folklore in the Old Testament, pp. 52-65. 12 Belief in Immortality, pp. 66-67.</page><page sequence="7">THE ORIGIN OF DEATH 377 light, as in all legends of conflicts between sun and moon, defeated the lover of darkness. Only here, it turned out disastrous for man, for he was consigned to death.13 As in the waxing and waning moon, so in creatures that periodically shed their skins, the mind of some savages found a token of the renewal of life, and of deathlessness. Under favorable conditions, (so they think, with regret), man also could have only cast his skin and put on a new one, and like the serpent have lived forever.14 According to the Melanesians, To Kambinana, the good spiiit, loved men and wished to make them immortal, but hated the serpents and wished to kill them. One day he called his brother, To Korvuvu, and ordered him to carry to men the secret of immortality. "Tell them to cast their skins every year. So will they be protected, for their life will be constantly renewed. But tell the seipents that they must henceforth die." Sad to say, the good message was perverted. Thus men die, and serpents cast their skins every year and are immortal. In another version, the serpents compel the messenger to pervert the message in their favor. According to the natives of Nias, an island off the coast of Sumatra, after the creation of the earth, God sent down a certain being to put the last touches to the work of creation. He was to fast for a month. But unable to withstand the pangs of hunger, he ate some bananas. "The choice of food was most unlucky, for had he only eaten river-crabs instead of bananas, men would have cast their skins like crabs and would never have died.15 The Tamanachiers, an Indian tribe of the Orinoko, say that "after residing among them for some time, the Creator took boat to cross to the other side of the great salt river from which he came. Just as he was shoving off from the shore, he called out to them in a changed voice, 'You will change your skins,' by which he meant 'You will renew your youth like the serpents and the beetles.' But 13 D. C.

That is why we are all mortal."1* The Melanesians tell a story to the effect that in the beginning of things, men never died, but cast their skins like snakes and crabs, and thus renewed their youth. This happy state was changed through an old woman. Having aged, this dame went down to the river, stripped off her wizened old skin, cast it upon the waters, and watched it float till it caught on a stick. Then she went home a buxom woman. But her child did not know her, and set up such a squalling, that the woman went back to the river, fished out her casl-off skin, and put it on again. Since then, men do not cast their skins any more. In another version, the woman's two sons did recognize her, but one of them wished to marry her. Thereupon, she put on her old skin, and brought mortality upon the world.17 In many of these tales, death is accounted for as the result of man's short-sightedness. The natives of Poso, a district of Central Celebes, held that in the beginning, when the sky was near the earth, the Creator used to let down his good gifts to men at the end of a rope. One day he lowered a stone, the first ancestors of the race refused to accept, and called for something else. The Creator complied, withdrew the stone, and sent down a banana. The human couple was delighted, but not for long; for a voice from heaven resounded saying: "Because ye have chosen the banana, your life shall be like its life. When the banana tree has offspring, the parent stem dies; so shall ye die and your children shall step into your placts. Had ye chosen the stone, your life would have been like the life of the stone, changeless and immortal."18 w Ibid, p. 70. 17 Ibid. pp. 71-72. 18 Ibid, p. 73.</page><page sequence="9">THE ORIGIN OF DEATH 379 The Malthusian theory of over-population had its defenders among the primitive people. The Mantras, a tribe of the Malay Peninsula, claim thai in the beginning, men did not die, but only grew thin at the waning of the moon and waxed fat again as the moon waxed to the full. Thus the population increased to an alarming extent. One of the sons of the first man brought this matter to his father's attention. The old man advised to leave things as they were, but the younger one pleaded: "No, let man die like the banana, leaving their offspring behind." As the Lord of the Universe sided with the son, men have ceased to renew their youth like the moon, and have died like the banana. A Melanesian story rests upon the same motif.19 The Eskimos of Greenland maintain that the first woman brought death by saying: "Let these die to make room for their posterity."î0 Woman plays an important part in the stories account- ing for the origin of death. She is our common mother, also the common cause of woe. In the type of stories of the serpent and his cast skin, mention was made of death's coming to men through the child's screaming at the sipht of its "renewed" mother. The Baluba, a tribe living on the borders of the Congo state, say that the casting of the skin was interrupted "by the woman's fellow-wife" (rival.)21 The Hupa of California tell that "people used to renew their youth when they grew old, by sleeping in the sweat- house." This happy state came to an end "because a certain mythological personage was unfaithful to his two wives, who in revenge took the two children they had boi ne him, and buried them alive. When the children came up again, they put them back, declaring that thenceforward everyone should do that way."®2 According to the Al- 19 Ib¡d. pp. 73, 83. 20 See Hartland, article "Death," in Hastings' Enclyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, vol.

If not for her, men would live forever.23 The male of the species, too, as we have seen, has his share in the mischief of bringing death to humanity. According to the Kaitish and Unmatjeta of Australia, when formerly men were buried, they came to life again in three days. The Kaitish have it that an old man was displeased with this order of things, and wanted to die once for all. In order to secure this effect, he kicked into the sea the body of one who had just died and been temporarily buried.24 The Wotjobaluk, too, tell that when people died, the moon used to say: "You up again." But an old man said: "Let them remain dead." Since then, none except the moon has ever come to life again.25 The Wemba of Northern Rhodesia relate that when God created man and woman, he gave them two bundles, one containing life and the other death. Unfortunately the man - and strange that not as in other stories, the woman - chose the little bundle of death.26 Though the phases of the moon naturally suggest to primitive man the idea of death and restoration to life, it would be strange not to find the sun suggesting any such thought. The Cherokee Indians of North America say that, in creation, the sun was made first. When man was formed, the creator intended that he be immortal. To this the sun objected. In passing over men, in the sky, the sun told them that there would not be room enough for them and that they better die. One day the sun's own daughter who visited with the people on earth, was bitten by a snake and died. Thereupon the sun repented and said that men should live always. "He bade them take a 23 Brinton, The Myths of the New World, p. 156. 24 Hartland, Ibid. p. 412; Spencer-Gillen. Nat. Tribes of Cent-. Aust. 1904, p. 513. 28 Ibid. p. 412; Howitt, Nat. Tribes, S. E.

But he charged them straightly not to open the box until they arrived at the dead body. However, moved by curiosity, they un- happily opened the box too soon ; away flew the spirit, and all men have died ever sincê."27 In this myth as well as in the following one, we recognize elements contained in the Greek legend of the box of Pandora.28 Some of the North American Indians believed that a certain man received a small packet from a famous magician named Messou, "who repaired the world after it had been seriously damaged by a great flood." The man was enjoined not to open the packet. The man obeyed, and as long as the packet remained closed, he was immortal. At last, his wife, out of curiosity and incredulity, opened the packet, and death came into the world.29 This breaking of a "tabu" is given as the origin of death in a number of stories. Set upon his theory that the Genesis account of the Fall of Man is an "abridged version" of a savage myth, Frazer ignores these in his treatment of the subject in his Folklore of the Old Testa- ment. The natives about the Murray River in Australia relate that the first man and woman were forbidden to go near a tree in which a bat lived, lest they should disturb the creature. One day the woman, gathering firewood, went near the tree. The bat flew away, and death came into the world.30 R. Brough Smith remarks: "This story appears to bear tco close a resemblance to the Biblical account of the Fall. Is it genuine or not? Mr. Bulmer admits that it may have been invented by the aborigines after they had heard something of Scripture history.31 Another version makes woman covet the honey which wild 27 Frazer, Ibid. p. 77. 28 Frazer, Pausanias, II: 320.

In spite of warnings by the men, the woman attacked the tree with her tomahawk. Out flew a huge bat. The bat was Death which was hence- forth free to roam the world and claim whatever it could touch with its wings.32 According to another tale, the Ningphoos were dismissed from Paradise, and became mortal because one of them bathed in water which had been tabooed.33 In some cases, death is the result of the curse of a god, not for disobedience but for deception or imprudence. Thus the Bataks of Palawan in the Philippine Islands tell that their god used to raise the dead to life again. One day they deceived him with a shark wrapped up like a corpse. Upon discovering the trick, he cursed them to remain forever subject to death.34 In a Japanese tale, Prince Ninighi fell in love with Princess ,Flourishing-like-the- Flowers. "Her father, the god of the Great Mountain, con- sented to her marriage, and sent her with her elder sister, Long-as- the-Rocks. This lady, however, was frightfully ugly, and the bridegroom sent her back. Thereupon, the god cursed his son-in-law, declaring that his posterity should be frail as the flowers."36 The Khonds of Orissa, whom Professor Tylor character- izes as the most perfect exponents of barbaric art, believe that Bura Pennu (or Bella Pennu), Light- or Sun-God, created a happy world; but Tari-Pennu, the Earth-Goddess, rebelled against him, and "to blast the lot of his new creature, man, she brought in disease and poison and all disorder, 'sowing the seeds of sin in mankind as in a ploughed field.'

Biblical Accounts of the Origin of Death. Turning from the primitive accounts of the origin of death to Genesis II and III as well as to VI : 1-4, we find our- selves moving in the same cultural atmosphere. Though the details and local color differ, the attitude towards the problem is very much the same. In view of these records, it is wholly out of the question to account for the Biblical story of the Fall by tracing it to Babylonian or Assyiian, Amorite or Canaanite origins.88 Here we are dealing with the ex- planation of the sad fact of mortality, as presented by the early thinkers of Israel. Whatever similarity may appear between other primitive accounts and those of Genesis cannot logically be taken as cases of borrowing from one another, but rathei as evidence of "the identity in the mental construction of the individual man, wherever he is found."39 Natural phenomena - sun, moon, stars, winds, storms, rains, day and n-ght, clouds, disease, and death - which are much the same everywhere, form the warp and woof of all thinking. Working on the same materials, primitive man the world over evolved somewhat similar speculations regarding the origin of things.40 36 Tylor, Prim. Cult. vol. II. p. 328; cf.

Ibid.</page><page sequence="14">384 JOURNAL OF JEWISH LORE AND PHILOSOPHY It is evident that like the myths of the primitive peoples, so the Biblical narratives simply refuse to accept the natural- ness of death. In their presentation, too, man was origin- ally endowed with immortality, but he forfeited this boon through a fatal blunder. Encouraged by this similarity in cultural atmosphere, Frazer borrows the method of Higher Criticism, and advocates the view that "in the original form of the narrative theie were two trees, a Tree of Life and a Tree of Death, and that man was allowed to eat of the Tree of Life, but forbidden to eat of the Tree of Death."41 The serpent which was sent by God to bear the glad tidings of immortality perverted the message and beguiled the woman. Its motive "was probably to cheat men of the boon of immortality and to confer it on serpents, which are commonly supposed to be immortal, because they shed their skins- and thereby renew their youth."42 By construing this story as an "abridged version of this savage myth" and by assuming that in the original account "the forbidden tree was really a tree of death, not of knowl- edge, and that the mere taste of its deadly fruit quite apart from any question of obedience to a divine command, sufficed to entail death on the eater," matters are undoubt- edly considerably simplified. This hypothesis may further recommend itself on the ground that it "sets the character of the Creator in a more amiable light by making it probable that he intended to confer the boon of immortality on his creature man, and was only frustrated in his amiable in- tention by the cunning of the serpent."43 However, be- yond its novelty this reconstruction has no other merit to recommend it. It rests on the assumption that the Biblical account is an exact parallel to certain savage myths, and may be corrected wherever it fails to agree with them, without allowing for natural differences in motive and manner of the various narratives. The reconstruction consequently presents itself as an entirely new story, with- 41 Folklore in the O. T. vol.

It further fails to take into account the evident intention of the Biblical author to explain the origin not alone of death but also of sex-consciousness and the pain of childbirth, which he successfully accomplishes by introducing the Tree of Life into the story of the Fall. The Hebrew noun for knowledge , da'at, derived from the root yada would warrant the conclusion that the Tree of Knowledge implies not merely intellectual or moral enlightenment, but also sex-knowledge. That may account for connecting the Tree of Knowledge with the Tree of Life in the midst of the Garden. That also explains, as Dr. Morgenstern has pointed out, why "the immediate and natural consequence of eating of the fruit of the forbidden tree was not the sense of shame, but as III : 7 expressly states, that the man and the woman became conscious of their nakedness, of which they had hitherto been, like children, altogether unconscious. With the perception of nakedness came, of course, the knowledge of sex distinction. Just this knowledge, eating of the forbidden fruit conferred. Hence the name Ez Hada1 at, tree of Knowledge.''44 Likewise, it is wholly unwarranted to regard the serpent's malice as springing from the desire to benefit from man's forfeiture of the boon of immortality, even if it were established that the early Semites shared the belief that the serpent like the eagle46 and the phoenix possessed the power of renewing its youth, and with this its life, by shedding its skin. The main evidence for the existence of such a belief is furnished by the Gilgamesh Epic XI, 274-320. To quote Dr. Morgen- stern on whom Frazer chiefly relies on this point, the passage 11 tells of the serpent stealing from Gilgamesh the magic plant, called sihu issahir amelu , as old , man becomes 44 Op. c't. p. 116.

By eating of this plant, and giving it to others, Gilgamesh had confidently expected to obtain for himself and them the blessing of renewed youth. As il is, he missed it, and instead, the implication is, the serpent ac- quired this blessing for himself."46 At best then, the ser- pent's acquisition of the boon is a mere implication, which would hardly warrant us to make it the basis for îecon- sti ucting the Biblical narrative. Furthermore, in the stories of the type of the perverted message, the messengers are not always prompted by the desire to benefit personally by bringing death upon man. It must also be noted that our author is in no way concerned with the phenomenon of the serpent's casting of the skin, nor does he allude to its immortality. He is rather concerned with the reason for the serpent's creeping on the ground instead of sharing the upright gait of man, or of walking on four legs as ani- mals. And he accounted for it by the curse which God inflicted upon lhe serpent because of its cunning. These objections eliminating Frazer's hypothesis, we may find it best after all, to leave the Biblical narrative as it is, and seek to explain it in the general light that primitive myths afford. Before proceeding with the explanation of Genesis II and III, let us dispose of Genesis VI : 1-4. This passage is commonly dismissed by commentators with the rema'k that it resembles the Greek myth of the Titans, and that it is placed at the beginning of thé story of the Flood for the purpose of illustiatirg the growing wickedness of man. Its obvious connection with the Fall of Man or with the Origin of Death has been overlooked. Read in the light of primitive lore, it takes its place among the explanations of the Origin of Death. According to this narrative, no limit had originally been set upon man's longevity, and presumably men were im- moital. They were deemed worthy to be visited freely by the sons of God. Unfortunately, this comiadeship led to endless confusion. "The sons of God saw the daughters 46 Op. cit., note to pp. 112-113, and Frazer Folklore in the O. T. p. SO ff.</page><page sequence="17">THE ORIGIN OF DEATH 387 of men that they were fair; and they took unto themselves wives, whomsoever they chose."47 Thereupon Jahveh, disapproving of these intermarriages, resolved to draw a sharper line between human and divine beings. And Jahveh said: "My spirit shall not abide in man forever, on account of their erring.48 He is flesh, and his days shall be a hundred and twenty years." Here a more liberal span of life is assigned to man than the Psalmists' scanty three score and ten or four score years. Mortality appears as the sad lot of all humanity, come into existence not through man's misdeeds, but rather through the miscreancy of the sons of God and Jahveh's jealousy for the honor of His divine family. Instead of restraining his ill-behaved sons, Jahveh punishes man whose only fault consisted in that his daughters were fair and attractive. The pauper was again chastised for the misbehavior of the prince. At greater length this problem of how mortality in- truded itself upon mankind, is treated in Genesis II and III. In the childishly anthropomorphic atmosphere of this narrative, Jahveh is portrayed as being on terms of intimacy with the first couple. No sooner had He moulded man out of dust and breathed the spirit of life in1o his nostrils, than He placed him in a specially appointed garden abounding in lovely trees. Among them was " the tree of life in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil." Placing man in the garden to till it and to guard it, Jahveh commanded him under the penalty of death, net to partake of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. When in the course of time, woman was created as help- mate for man,49 he informed her of the tabu . Dutiful wife that she was, she observed her husband's orders until the 47 On the marriage of the "jinn" with human beings, see Josephus, Antiquities 1:3, 1; Enoch VI: 2; VII: 1; LXXXVI: 3 f.; Jubilees V: 1-6 - cf. H. P. Smith, Old Testament History pp. 14-16. 48 This version of b'shaggom seems preferable to that given in the New Translation: "for that also." 49 Frazer in his Fotkloreof the Old Testament, Vol. I, pp. 4-5, makes a peculiar case of misogyny out of this incident. He writes that: "The lateness of her creation, and the irregular and undignified (?)</page><page sequence="18">388 JOURNAL OF JEWISH LORE AND PHILOSOPHY mischief making serpent appeared on the scene. As in many of the primitive tales referred to above, the serpent takes delight in perverting the divine command. Un- doubtedly well aware that the tabu rested only on the Tree of Knowledge, the cunning serpent asks the woman whether it be true that she and her husband were forbidden to eat of any tree in the garden. "Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat," replies the woman, "but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden , God hath said : 'Ye shall not eat of it, neithei shall ye touch it lest ye die.' " The serpent, aware that the tree in the midst of the garden is the tree of life upon which no tabu rested, takes advantage of the inaccuracy in the woman's report, and urges her to taste of the fruit of the tree of Knowledge. Knowing further that the breaking of the tabu did not involve im- mediate death, but rather the forfeiture of immottality,60 the serpent shrewdly remarks that the tabu was nothing but the expression of God's jealousy, and that the eating of the fruit of the tree of Knowledge would invest her with powers of divinity: "Ye shall be as God, knowing- good and evil." Enticed by the hissing counselor, the woman tastes the fruit and finds it "a delight to the eyes" and manner of it - made out of a piece of her lord and master, after all the lower animals had been created in a regular and decent manner - sufficiently mark the low opinion he (the author of the narrative) had of her nature; and in the sequel his misogynism, as we may fairly call it, takes a still darker tinge, when he ascribes all the misfortunes and sor- rows of the human race to the credulous folly and unbridled appetite of its first mother" (p. 5). Such reasoning accords with the older rationalism which Frazer himself so ably combats in his work. The lateness of woman's creation in Genesis II must be judged in the light of the lateness of man's creation in Genesis I. Her formation out of man's rib, rather than out of dust, shows remarkable tenderness and delicacy of feeling on the part of the author, who thus emphasizes that the wife forms an integral part of the husband. As far as his making woman responsible for the Fall, is concerned, the author does not entirely exhonorate the man either. Both of them are made to share in the guilt that brought woe upon the world. 60 The Hebrew HIDD HID lends itself to both meanings. See J. Morgenstern, Op. cit. pp. 107; and note to pp. 112-113 where he refers to Ehrlich 's Randglossen I. p. 10.</page><page sequence="19">THE ORIGIN OF DEATH 389 "desired to make one wise." She therefore gives it also to her husband. The fruit indeed had its effect. "The eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked." Together with othei knowledge, came sex-consciousness. When Jahveh took His usual stroll in the graden "towards the cool of the day," the man kept out of His way. As he called: "Where art Thou?", the man replied: "I heard Thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid m&gt; self." This sudder sense of shame betrayed man V secret. "Who told thee that thou wast naked?", demanded Jahveh. "Has thou eaten of the fruit of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat?" The man threw the blame upon his fair helpmate whom Jahveh had given unto him; she in turn blamed the serpent. Thereupon Jahveh meted out due punishment unto all the offending parties. The serpent was deprived of its upright gait and was turned into a creeping creature, feeding - according to an ancient notion - on dust. The woman was affl'Cted with the sufferings of pregnancy and the pains of birth - afflictions of woman's sexual life as fit punishment of the sin by which she called forth the consciousress of sex. There was also assigned her a position of subjection to man, the least guilty party of the crime. But the man did not en- tiiely escape punishment. Because he followed the counsel of his wife, breaking the divine command, the earth was cursed for his sake, yielding thorns and thistles. Henceforth he was to obtain bread from the ground, only through the sweat of his biow. Toil and labor became his lot, until his return to the ground whence he was taken. Do the last words convey the impression that the origin of man explains his end, that the dust naturally returns to the dust, and that mortality is inseparable from life? This view, if at all suggested in this nanative, is extremely vague, for Jahveh is still uneasy. In alarm, He says - apparently in divine council - "Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and. eat,</page><page sequence="20">390 JOURNAL OF JEWISH LORE AND PHILOSOPHY and live forever." Though originally there was no pro- hibition on man's eating of its fruit, as a precaution61 "Javeh Elohim sent him forth from the garden (and its pleasant labor), to till the giound whence he was taken. He drove out the map ; and He placed at the Elast of thf Garden of Eden the Cherubim, and the flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way to the tree of life." Death then appears as an after-thought of the Creator, Originally it had no room in the life of man, but - as in the myths of primitive peoples - it was introduced through an unfortunate blunder.62 Here we meet the causes of the origin of death, which are quite familiar in primitive myth- ology; viz: the jealousy of a god, the maliciousness of a serpent, the unsuspecting innocence of man. The principal characters in the sad drama, too, ate fam'liar to us from other tales. Chapter IV. Later Views on Death. It is only gradually that the sad truth dawned upon man, that he is bv his very nature of shórt days. A faint impress of it had been left on the account of the Fall of Man. Jatrveh declares: "Dust thou ari and unto dust thou teturnest." In much more poetic form, the pxophet sounds the same note, when he announces that "all flesh is grass; the grass withereth, the flower fadeth; because the bteath of the Lord bloweth upon it."68 Death and life appear as twin borr . This realization called forth many a sigh from the sweet singers oí Isreal. Man is like the grass 61 A similar precaution is recorded in the story of the Tower of Babel. Gen. XI: 1-9. 62 The construction of the narrative according to the author of this article seems to be as follows: Man was not destined to die, even if he never ate from the tree of life, unless he ate from the tree of knowledge. But even after eating from the tree of knowledge, he had a chance to escape death by eating from the tree of life, and it is. this that Jahveh decreed to prevent, - Editor. 64 Isaiah XL: 6-7. A Haida story accounts for death by the fact that men were made of grass and salmon-berry bushes. H. E. R. E. IV: 412.</page><page sequence="21">THE ORIGIN OF DEATH 391 which flourishes in the morning and withers in the evening. "Our da j s upon earth are a shadow," meditates the re- flecting poet."84 Even after the sad truth of mortality dawned upon the Jewish thinkers, they refused to surrender to it uncondi- tionally. Thus their comparison of human life to the life of the flower is not carried all the way through. The grass withers by natural law, but the death of man is presented as a punishment. Even when the Psalmist recognizes that no man can escape death, he views it as the penalty of man's sin. Thus he complains: "We are consumed in Thine anger And by Thy wrath are we hurried away. Thou hast set our iniquities before Thee, Our seciet sins, in the light of Thy countenance."55 Refusing in like manner to accept the naturalness of death, the Apocalyptic writer could express the hope that: "He will swallow up death forever; And the Lord will wipe away tears from all faces; And the reproach of His people will He take away from all the earth."56 The Biblical ideas on the origin of death are substan- tially upheld in later Jewish literature. Ben Sirach, ac- cepting the Torah as the revealed truth of God, regards death not as the fruit of man's sin in general, but of the particular sin of Adam and Eve. He writes : "From a woman did sin originate, And because of her we all must die."57 Also the author of the "Wisdom of Solomon" thinks that death formed no part of God's original plan of creation. He teaches that: "God made not death; neither dèlighteth He when the living perish; for He created all things that they might have being; and the products of the world are healthsome, and there is no poison of destruction in them. 54 Psalm XC: 6; CIII: 14-15; Job VII: 6-10; VIII: 9; XIV, etc. 55 Psalm XC: 7-8; LXXXIX: 49, etc., etc. 56 Isaiah XXV: 8. Ecclesiasticus XXV : 24.</page><page sequence="22">392 JOURNAL OF JEWISH LORE AND PHILOSOPHY Nor hath Hades royal dominion upon earth, for righteous- ness is immortal, - but the gain of unrighteousness is death - but the ungodly by their hands and words called him unto them; deeming him a friend, they were consumed with love of him, because they were worthy to be of his portion." (I: 13-16). Further: "God created man for in- corruption, and made him an image of His own proper being (i. e. immortal), but by the envy of the devil, death entered into the world, and they that belong to his realm experience it." (II: 23-24). If, in the Wisdom of Solomon as in the Life of Adam and Eve (XV-XIX), the devil is the same as the serpent of Genesis III, the author's view may be stated thus: that while death first came upon man with the fall of Adam and Eve, only those that are under the sway of evil are subject to it. In answer to the possible objection that death overtakes the righteous as well as the wicked, our author declares: "But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God And no torment shall touch them. In the eyes of fools they seem to die, And their departure was accounted to be their hurt, And their going from us to be their ruin. But they are in peace, For though in the sight of men they be punished, Their hope is full of immortality, And having borne a little chastening, they shall receive great good Because God tested them, and found them worthy of Himself. As gold, He proved them, And as a whole burnt offering He accepted them. And in the time of their visitation they shall shine forth, And like sparks among stubble they shall run to and fro. They shall judge nations and have dominion over peoples, And the Lord shall reign over them forevermore." (Ill: 1-8).</page><page sequence="23">THE ORIGIN OF DEATH 393 Interpreting life in spiritual rather than in physical terms the author of the Wisdom of Solomon disregards physical mortality and deals only with spiritual death. If the righteous continue their spiritual existence in the beyond, the wicked are spiritually dead even on earth, continuing their miserable condition in the next world. (IV-V). Somewhat similar views are expressed in the Book of Enoch. In chapter LXIX, we read of the Satans or the fallen Angels who brought evil upon the world. The first two of them led the sons of God astray (referring to Gen, VI: 1-4) "so that they defiled their bodies with the daughters of men." The third "showed the children of men all the blows of death, and led astray Eve, and showed [the weapons of death to the sons of men] the shield and the coat of mail, and the sword for the battle, and all the weapons of death to the children of men." The fourth one taught men "the bitter and the sweet," also "all the secrets of their wisdom." Somewhat severe in his literary criti- cism, he condemns literature as the invention of the Satan. "He instructed mankind in writing with ink and paper, and thereby sinned from eternity to eternity and unto this day." This is, in all likelihood, the homiletic application of the story of man's partaking of the fruit of the tree of Knowledge, to the conditions ot the age in which the author of Enoch wrote. The root of the author's theology is expressed in these words: "men were created exactly like the angels, to the intent that they should continue pure and righteous, and death, which destroys everything could not have taken hold of them, but through this their knowl- edge they are perishing, and through this Dower* they are being consumed.*" It is through his own evil acts, envy of the devils, or acceptance of the evil knowledge intro- duced by them, that man was robbed of his immortality. The final chapter, which forms an independent addition to the book of Enoch, confidently announces that, in the last days, they that have done good shall see the end "of those who work evil, and an end of the might of transgressors." * according to Charles' reading.</page><page sequence="24">394 JOURNAL OF JEWISH LORE AND PHILOSOPHY Sin shall then pass away, "for their names shall be blotted out of the book of life and out of the holy books, and their seed shall be destroyed forever, and their spirits shall be slain,68 and they shall cry and make lamentation in a place that is a chaotic wilderness, and in the fire shall they burn , for there is no earth there." While those that perverted God's revelation are exposed to the blazing fires of hell, the ascetic saints who loved heaven rathe** than worldly goods, and who were abused and reviled for God's name, shall be brought forth in shining light and will be seated "each on the throne of his honor. And they shall be resplendent for times without number; for righteousness is the judgment of God; for to the faithful he will give faithfulness in the habitation of upright paths, And they shall see those who were born in darkness led into darkness, while the righteous shall be resplendent." (CVIII). In this wise, the pall of mortality which falls heavily on the sinners is removed from the saints. The generations of light know of no death. Their apparent mortality is but the entrance into a higher life, there to receive the reward which in the flesh was denied them. Unlike the books of Wisdom and of Enoch, IV Ezra does not attribute the fall of man to demoniac incitement, but rather to the sin of the individual.59 That the universal state of sin is somehow connected with Adam's sin is implied though not expressly stated in the book.60 Through the temptation of Adam and Eve, the "Evil Germ"61 or the "Grain of Evil Seed" was sown in their hearts. "This evil root or grain of evil seed," writes Box, "doubtless corre- sponds to the evil impulse (Yetser hara) of Rabbinic the- ology. Adam clothed himself with the cor malignum by yielding to the suggestions of the evil impulse. The evil heart , thus developed, inevitably led to sin and death. 88 Though slain they are not annihilated for they 1 'shall cry and màke lamentations." 69 VIII: 35. 60 VII: 118. 81 III: 22.</page><page sequence="25">THE ORIGIN OF DEATH 395 The evil seed sown in the heart of Adam was transmitted to his descendants (IV : 30) with the result that the infirmity became inveterate (III: 22). All men have fallen into sin (VIII: 35) and, as a consequence, this age (the present world order) is full of sorrow and impotence (IV: 27), the ways of this world have become narrow and sorrowful and painful (VII: 12).62 The Biblical ideas on the origin of death together with their amplification in Apocryphal and Pseudo-Epigraphic literature, entered into the teachings of both the New Testa- ment63 and Rabbinic writings.64 Thus from the realm of folklore and mythology the conception of the unnaturalness of death was transferred to the domain of philosophy and theology. It forms the basic idea of the doctrines of the Fall of Man and of Salvation and of all Jewish as well as of Christian speculation on Death and on Immortality. Even the modern sciences have not wholly avoided this 62 Introduction to IV Ezra in Charles' Apocrypha and Pseido- Epigrapha. 63 See Kohler, art. Death in Jewish Encyclopedia IV: 483." This view (expressed also in Ethiopie Enoch XCVIII: 4 and Slavonic Enoch XXX:16-18) was made the basic idea of Paul's system of salvation (Rom. V: 12; I. Cor. XV: 21; Hebrews II: 14), after the apocalyptic literature of the Jews had made the problem of sin and death the object of serious reflection, which culminated in the hope of the final anni- hilation of death in the world to come (IV Esd. Ill: 7; VII: 32, 119; VIII: 53)". 64 The Midr. Tanh. to Gen. XXXIX: 1, states that the angel of death was created by God on the first day, long before the fall. Death, in this view, is part of the divine creation. The "bat-kol" orders Joshua b. Levi to return the knife to the angel of death, because men have need of it. (Ket. 77b). God gave the angel of death power over all people save those that have been freed from death through the law. (Tanh. to Ex. XXXI: 18. ed. Stettin p. 315.) The children of Israel accepted the Torah only that the angel of death may have no power over them. (Ab. Zarah 5a). In the Messianic era, all will be freed from destruction, for death shall then be no more. (Pesikt. R.) The book of Jubilees states: "And they shall fulfill all their days in peace and joy, and shall live on, since there will be no satan and no evil to destroy them." XXIII: 29.</page><page sequence="26">396 JOURNAL OF JEWISH LORE AND PHILOSOPHY conception. "To a certain extent," writes Frazer,68 "per- haps, in these crude speculations he (primitive man) has anticipated certain views of modern biology. Thus it has been maintained by Prof. August Weissman that death is not a natural necessity, that many of the lowest of In ing animals do in fact live forever; and that in the higher ani- mals the custom of dying has been introduced in the course of evolution for the purpose of thinning the population and preventing the degeneration of the species, which would otherwise follow through the gradual and necessary de- terioration of the immortal individuals, who, though they could not die, might yet sustain such bodily damage through hard knocks in the hurly-burly of eternal existence on earth."66 Alfred Russel Wallace also seems to be of the opinion that "death is not a natural necessity bat an innovation intro- duced for the good of the breed."67 These eminent scientists agree with the savage in regarding death as "by no means a natural necessity for all Irving beings. They orly differ from savages in this, that whereas savages look upon death as the result of a deplorable accident, our men of science regard it as a bénéficient reform instituted by nature as a means of adjusting the number of living beings to the quantity of the food supply,68 and so tending to the improvement and therefore on the whole to the happiness of the species."69 68 Belief in Immortality pp. 84 ff. 66 Ibid.
