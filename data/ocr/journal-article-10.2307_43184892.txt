<plain_text><page sequence="1">A REASSESSMENT OF RED LINEAR PICTOGRAPHS IN THE LOWER PECOS CANYONLANDS OF TEXAS Carolyn E. Boyd, Amanda M. Castañeda, and Charles W. Koenig Red Linear is one of four presently defined prehistoric pictograph styles in the Lower Pecos Canyonlands of southwest Texas and Coahuila, Mexico. Based on interpretation of images and two experimental radiocarbon dates, the style was pre- sumed to have been brought into the region by intrusive bison hunters around 1280 B.P. This would place production of Red Linear after the large, polychromatic Pecos River style paintings (4200-2750 B.P.). However, during a recent rock art recording project we identified Red Linear overlain by presumed older Pecos River style. This prompted our re-examina- tion of Red Linear through analysis of 444 figures from 12 sites. We produced a list of diagnostic attributes for Red Linear and documented stratigraphie relationships through macro- and microscopic field analysis. We identified 38 examples of Red Linear under Pecos River figures, thus inverting the relative chronology for the two styles and forcing a reconsidera- tion of previous assumptions regarding the culture that produced the art. This paper demonstrates the potential afforded by analysis of rock art assemblages to reveal inter- and intrasite patterning of attributes and provide insight into relative chronologies. Further, it cautions against the use of variation in artistic style as a marker for ethnicity. El estilo lineal rojo (Red Linear ) es uno de los cuatro en los que se clasifican los pictogramas de la región de los cañones en la desembocadura del río Pecos, situada en el suroeste de Tejas y en Coahuila, México. Se ha supuesto que este estilo se creó en el área por la intrusión de cazadores de bisontes hacia 1280 B.P., basándose en las fechas obtenidas por dos análisis expe- rimentales con Carbono- 14 y en la interpretación de las imágenes. De ese modo el estilo lineal rojo se habría producido des- pués de las grandes pinturas policromátricas del estilo llamado Río Pecos (4200-2750 B. P.). Sin embargo, gracias a un proyecto reciente de registro de arte rupestre hemos podido identificar ejemplos en los que el estilo Río Pecos, supuestamente más anti- guo, se sobrepone a ejemplos de lineal rojo. Esto nos obligó a reexaminar el lineal rojo mediante el análisis de 444 imágenes de 12 sitios. En consecuencia, hemos preparado una lista de atributos caracterizadores del lineal rojo y documentado las rela- ciones estratigráficas por medio de análisis de campo microscópicos y macroscópicos. En 38 ocasiones se encuentran ejem- plos de lineal rojo debajo de imágenes de estilo Río Pecos. Se invierte así la cronología relativa de los dos estilos, lo que obliga a reconsiderar los supuestos previos acerca de la cultura que produjo ese tipo de arte. Este artículo demuestra la capacidad que aporta el análisis de conjuntos de arte rupestre para revelar esquemas de atributos entre yacimientos y dentro de cada uno de ellos y para establecer mejor sus cronologías relativas. Además, previene contra el uso de la variación en los estilos artísticos como marca de etnicidad. Red prehistoric Pecos Linear Canyonlands is rock one of art four styles of presently southwest in the defined Lower Texas prehistoric rock art styles in the Lower Pecos Canyonlands of southwest Texas and Coahuila, Mexico: Pecos River, Red Linear, Bold-Line Geometric, and Red Monochrome. Based on interpretation of images and two exper- imental radiocarbon dates, Red Linear style was presumed to have been produced during the ter- minal Late Archaic around 1280 years B.P. (Ilger et al. 1994; Rowe 2003; Turpin 1984, 1990a, 201 1). This places production of Red Linear pic- tographs later than the Pecos River style, which dates from 4200 to 2750 B.P. (Rowe 2009). Be- cause of differences in age and subject content be- tween the two styles, Solveig Turpin, a pioneer in Texas rock art research, argues that Red Linear style was brought into the region by a group of people who, with vastly different cultural tradi- tions, contributed to the demise of the Pecos River style and its attendant lifeways (Turpin 1984, 2011; Turpin and Eling 2002).

Mystic Shelter (41W612). Located 3 cm beneath the head of a large Pecos River style deer is a Red Linear style anthropomorph wielding paraphernalia. Directly in front of the anthropomorph are two Red Linear style zoomorphs.

See Supplemental Figure 1 for color image. and Education Center launched an intensive rock art recording and preservation project in the Lower Pecos (Johnson et al. 2011). Early in the project we identified small anthropomorphs and zoomorphs characteristic of Red Linear pic- tographs under presumed older Pecos River style figures.1 One of the first recognized examples of superpositioning was documented at Mystic Shel- ter (41 VV612), where a miniature red deer, par- tially obscured by accretions, is superimposed by a Pecos River style motif portraying a large deer impaled by a spear (Figure 1; Supplemental Fig- ure 1). This example of superpositioning was first reported by Turpin (1984). She (Turpin 1984: 188) writes, "if not viewed in the context of the entire group this one deer would seem to prove that the Pecos River figure is later. The small animal, however, is stylistically different than the two [Red Linear style deer] in the foreground." No ex- planation of why the figure is stylistically differ- ent is provided. We soon found more examples of apparent Red Linear figures under Pecos River imagery. As a result, we were faced with two questions: (1) what characteristics or attributes are constant, recurring, or consistent for Red Linear imagery; and (2) do significant differences exist between the attributes of figures superimposed by Pecos River paintings and attributes of accepted Red Linear style pictographs? To answer these questions, we began by de- constructing, or breaking down into individual at- tributes, each figure at 41 VV201 -the site Turpin (1984: 182) identifies as the type site for Red Lin- ear rock art. We developed a list of diagnostic at- tributes for the style to aid in identification of Red Linear imagery in a broader population of figures recorded at 11 other sites in the region. The re- sulting data set was compared to attributes col- lected for figures underneath Pecos River style to determine similarities- or differences- between the attributes of the superimposed figures and Red Linear style pictographs. Because of the superpo- sitioning of Pecos River and Red Linear imagery, we were able to analyze the order of deposition, or stratigraphy, of the Red Linear and the Pecos River style through macro- and microscopic field analy- sis and development of Harris matrices (e.g., Fritz and Tosello 2007; Harris 1989; Loubser 2011; Swart 2004). This paper demonstrates the poten- tial afforded by this approach to: (1) identify di- agnostic attributes for rock art assemblages; (2) re- veal inter- and intra-site patterning of attributes; and (3) provide insight into relative chronologies for rock art assemblages. Data collected and ana- lyzed using these methods revise Turpin's find- ings, invert existing chronologies for two regional rock art styles, and necessitate further radiometric dating of Red Linear and Pecos River pictographs.</page><page sequence="3">458 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 78, No. 3, 2013 Figure 2.

Lower Pecos Canyonlands The rocky, semi-arid region referred to as the Lower Pecos Canyonlands is located at the south- western edge of the Edwards Plateau within sight of the Burro Mountains in Coahuila, Mexico (Fig- ure 2). This landscape is incised by deep, narrow canyons containing hundreds of rockshelters that provided refuge for groups of hunter-gatherers throughout the Holocene. Excavations of dry rock- shelter deposits yielded a wide assemblage of ar- tifacts, such as wood and bone tools, matting, bas- ketry, snares, and the accumulated detritus of everyday living (Alexander 1974; Parsons 1965; Pearce and Jackson 1933; Shafer and Bryant 1977). Other perishable artifacts include feather plumes, rasping sticks, fire-starting kits, and med- icinal and hallucinogenic plants (Dering 1979; Martin 1933; Terry et al. 2006). Occasionally stone pipes and calcite crystals are found, along with abundant chipped stone tools and grinding stones. Mobiliáry art in the form of small painted pebbles and other painted objects such as wood, bone, and snail shells are not uncommon in the dry shelters, as are engraved stone plaquettes and freshwater mussel shells (Chandler 1987; Daven- port and Chelf 1941; Mock 1987; Parsons 1986; Prewitt 1970; Shafer 1975, 1986; Turpin 1996). The walls of over 200 rockshelters host an ar- ray of pictographic images ranging in age from 4,200 years ago to after the time of European contact (Boyd 2003; Kirkland and Newcomb 1967; Jackson 1938; Turpin 2004). Pecos River style rock art is the most prominently represented, and rock art research in the Lower Pecos has fo- cused predominantly upon analysis and interpre- tation of the Pecos River style (Bass 1989; Boyd 2003, 2010; Greco 1984; Glieder 1966; Harrison 201 1 ; Kirkland and Newcomb 1967; Turpin 2004, 201 1). Twenty-five radiocarbon assays have been obtained and range from approximately 4,200 to 2,750 years ago (Rowe 2009). Pictographic ele- ments of the Pecos River style murals include an- thropomorphs, zoomorphs, a wide range of geo- metric imagery, and enigmatic figures that are not identifiable as human or animal (Supplemen- tal Figure 2). Anthropomorphs are by far the most fre- quently depicted Pecos River style element. Al- though most range in size between 1 and 5 m, some are monumental, towering over 8 m in height, while others are less than 10 cm tall. Pecos River style figures are often finely exe- cuted in red, yellow, black, and white and are por- trayed wielding paraphernalia, such as atlatls, spears, and staffs. Figures are frequently depicted</page><page sequence="4">Boyd et al.] REASSESSMENT OF RED LINEAR PICTOGRAPHS 459 with headdresses of varying types, clusters of feathers at the hip or waist, and wrist or elbow adornments. No markers indicating gender have been identified among Pecos River style anthro- pomorphs. Felines and impaled deer are the most commonly portrayed animals; birds and canines occur less frequently. Interspersed throughout the extensive Pecos River panels are hundreds of Red Linear pic- tographs portraying humans engaged in group activities (Supplemental Figure 3). Anthropo- morphs are frequently portrayed with gender markers and typically stand less than 10 cm in height. Their smaller size has resulted in an un- derappreciation of these intriguing paintings and an underestimation of the number of sites con- taining them. Two experimental radiocarbon as- says have been used to suggest Red Linear was produced approximately 1 ,300 years ago, almost 1 ,500 years after the youngest date for Pecos River style (Ilger et al. 1994; Rowe 2003). Previous Red Linear Research, Interpretations, and Chronology The first known documentation of Red Linear pictographs was conducted by Forrest Kirkland and his wife Lula at 41VV201 during the 1930s. Twenty years later, David Gebhard visited this same site during a rock art survey sponsored by the National Park Service Archaeological Sal- vage Program, conducted prior to construction of Amistad Reservoir. In 1960, Gebhard coined the term Red Linear style to describe paintings he thought were unique to 41 VV201 . In the 1980s, Solveig Turpin (1984) provided a description for Red Linear style, an estimate of its age, and an interpretation for its possible function. At that time there were only eight sites2 known to contain Red Linear imagery. Turpin (1984:182) noted, "despite the increase in the known fre- quency of sites with this type of rock art, 41VV201, the Red Linear site, remains the epit- ome of the style". The themes and motifs which characterize the style according to Turpin are: stick figures engaged in energetic group activ- ity; the use of size variation to illustrate pro- cessional or linear arrangements; sex differentiation through the display of genital symbols ; S-shaped posture as a method of con- veying motion; headdresses; hand-held imple- ments, accompanying animals, in this case [4 1 V V 20 1 ] dogs ; striped or cross-hatched fig- ures; and looped geometries [1984:184]. She proposes that Red Linear style resulted from a Late Archaic intrusion of bison hunters into the Lower Pecos from the Great Plains 1 ,400 to 2,600 years ago (based largely on the presence of the bi- son jump site Bonfire Shelter, 41 W218, dating to this time period [Dibble and Lorrain 1968]), ar- guing that it was imported into the region as a fully developed art form (Turpin 1984, 1990b, 2004, 201 1). Turpin and Eling (2002:46) suggest that "a reasonable hypothesis is that these intruders . . . contributed to the demise of the old way of life as well as the Pecos River style." This hypothesis is based on four supporting lines of evidence: su- perposition of Red Linear images over Pecos River style, incorporation of Red Linear imagery into Pecos River style compositions, identification of bison drives in the Red Linear pictographs, and two experimental radiocarbon assays of previ- ously presumed Red Linear figures (Turpin 1984, 2004, 2011). Each is discussed below. Red Linear Bison Drives Two examples of bison drives in Red Linear im- agery are cited. The first is at 41 VV612 (Mystic Shelter; Figures 3a and 3b; Supplemental Fig- ures 4a and 4b) where "a single bison is being chased toward a geometric design by hunters wielding clubs or throwing sticks" (Turpin 1990b:272). Through advances in photographic and digital enhancement techniques, it is clear that the zoomorph Turpin (1990b:272) identifies as a bison is instead a deer or other cervid. The second is a scene at 41 VV 162A (Cueva Quebrada) where 13 red-orange oval shapes are located directly above a row of four headless quadrupeds and to the right of a crack in the shelter wall (Figures 3c and 3d; Supplemental Figures 4c and 4d). Turpin (1984:188) interprets this scene as "17 bison run- ning towards a crack in the shelter wall that could represent a canyon." However, the oval shapes and headless quadrupeds lack any diagnostic fea- tures that can be used to classify them as bison or as Red Linear style. Both examples will be dis- cussed in greater detail below.</page><page sequence="5">460 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 78, No. 3, 2013 Figure 3. Pictographs interpreted by TXirpin (1984) as bison: (a, b) antlered zoomorphic figure at Mystic Shelter (41W612); (c, d) four zoomorphic figures and 13 ovals at Cueva Quebrada (41W162a). See Supplemental Figure 4 for color image. Superposition and Incorporation of Red Linear into Pecos River Style Compositions According to Turpin (1984: 192), "the skillful use of existing Pecos River style art as a backdrop for the Red Linear pictographs and the rare instances where the two styles overlap generally suggest that the Red Linear is later." She provides two ex- amples to support this statement. At 41VV74 (Fate Bell Shelter) located in Seminole Canyon, a row of Red Linear anthropomorphs associated with a black and red Pecos River figure is painted approximately 6 m above the uneven shelter floor. Turpin (1984:186) describes these Red Linear figures as superimposing the Pecos River figure. Using a 24-foot ladder, we recently inspected the figures using microscopic photography, but due to heavy mineral accretions, we were unable to de- termine the stratigraphy between the two styles. The second is found at 41 VV612, located in a tributary canyon of the Devils River. Here, two miniature Red Linear deer emerge from the chest of a large, spear-impaled Pecos River deer (Fig- ure 1; Supplemental Figure 1). Turpin (1984:189) suggests that this is an example of the Red Linear artist's "adroit utilization of a preexisting figure as the central character." Although it appears that the Red Linear deer are coming out of the chest of the Pecos River style deer, as will be discussed in greater detail below, the hind leg of the Red Lin- ear deer is overlain by the Pecos River figure. Radiocarbon Dates of Red Linear Figures The two experimental radiocarbon assays re- ported for possible Red Linear imagery have been widely accepted by archaeologists as defining the temporal span of Red Linear pictographs. At Cueva Quebrada (41 VV 162 A), a paint sample</page><page sequence="6">Boyd et al.] REASSESSMENT OF RED LINEAR PICTOGRAPHS 461 was collected from one of the 13 red-orange oval shapes identified by Turpin as Red Linear bison. This paint sample yielded a radiocarbon assay of 1280 ±135 B.P. (Ilger et al. 1994). The second date was obtained from a black charcoal drawing of a deer at 41VV75 (Supplemental Figure 5). This sample yielded an assay of 1280 ± 80 years B.P. (Hyman and Rowe 1997; Rowe 2003). Based on the assayed age, Rowe (2003) proposed that the image was likely Red Linear style. However, Rowe (2003) mistakenly selected a photograph of a deer from another site (41 VV83-Panther Cave) when reporting the date, and used this photo- graph to assist in assigning the dated deer to a stylistic classification. Boyd and Rowe (2014) have published a correction in which they con- clude that the dated deer image from 41VV75 cannot be confidently classified as Red Linear be- cause it lacks attributes diagnostic of Red Linear style as presented in this paper. Further, it is not in association with any other figures possessing Red Linear attributes. Solveig Turpin 's contributions to rock art re- search in the Lower Pecos have been significant; however, her analysis of Red Linear style was produced nearly 30 years ago. Since that time, new rock art recording technologies have allowed for more accurate, robust data sets and objective stratigraphie analyses of rock art assemblages. With this newly acquired information we expand existing descriptions for Red Linear style and clarify its temporal relationship with Pecos River style. Methods The archaeological record can be defined as the combined evidence of past human behavior (Butzer 1982; Schiffer 1983). Within a single ar- chaeological site, the accumulated remains of hu- man behavior, spanning thousands of years, could be either well-stratified or completely deflated onto one surface (Butzer 1982; Goldberg and Macphail 2008; Waters 1992). It falls to the ar- chaeologist, then, to sort out these palimpsests. This can be accomplished through: (1) analysis of different types of artifacts, ecofacts, and features, as well as the overall site context; (2) the strati- graphic relationship between artifacts; (3) ana- lyzing the cultural and natural depositional envi- ronments; and (4) absolute dating techniques (Butzer 1982; Goldberg and Macphail 2008; Schiffer 1983; Waters 1992). Data collected in this way, whether through extensive excavations, minor testing, or surface survey, provides the dri- ving force behind hypotheses regarding an ar- chaeological site. Rock art is no exception. Rock art panels are both archaeological fea- tures and palimpsests (Whitley 2005), and should be subject to the same intensive methods uti- lized in field archaeology. Description of indi- vidual figures, just like analysis of artifacts from any other archaeological site, provides data for inter- and intra-site patterning. Researchers should document and describe not only attributes of individual figures, but also the stratigraphie re- lationship between those figures (Fritz and Tosello 2007; Loubser 2011; Swart 2004). The researcher should not move into the interpreta- tive/hypothesis phase until after these two as- pects of the rock art have been documented (Whitley 2005). As Whitley describes: any strong scientific inference necessarily must be based on systematic, and therefore representative, data collection and study. Yet one central weakness of many rock art studies is their reliance on anecdotal evidence, often resulting from what could be termed a "week- end warrior" approach to fieldwork: develop an inductive hypothesis that explains one par- ticular bit of empirical evidence and, from this single fact, conclude that you have explained the art. Meanwhile, the majority of the evi- dence, pro or con, is ignored [2005:76]. Recording Red Linear Rock Art When SHUMLA launched the Lower Pecos Rock Art Recording and Preservation Project in 2009, we operated under what had become accepted as conventional wisdom- the assumption that the Red Linear style was younger than the Pecos River style by at least 1,500 years. Early in the project, however, we identified multiple occur- rences of what appeared to be Red Linear figures overlain by Pecos River style. This prompted our reassessment of Red Linear rock art, beginning with the identification of diagnostic attributes for the rock art assemblage at 41 VV201 . To identify the salient characteristics, we deconstructed each</page><page sequence="7">462 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 78, No. 3, 2013 Figure 4. Red Linear Type Site (41W201).

Distance between figures not to scale. figure at the site. Since pictographic panels are features, we began by producing high-resolution mosaic panoramas to create feature maps for the site. We applied a digital grid to the panoramas to generate unit numbers for documenting figure lo- cations. Each figure was assigned a unit number and a reference code, including site number, fig- ure classification- anthropomorph, zoomorph, or enigmatic- and a unique number. Pictographs were photographed with and without scale. We used a variety of photographic and digital en- hancement techniques to reveal obscured rock art, including near infrared and ultraviolet pho- tography, Adobe Photoshop™ , and DStretch. Su- perpositioning of figures was analyzed in the field using macro- and microscopic analysis.3 This in- formation was used to construct relative chronolo- gies for overlapping figures. We used a light table to produce accurate il- lustrations by tracing photographs of pictographic images, carefully noting superpositioning, scale, color, and associated elements. The tracings were then compared against the actual image on-site to verify accuracy. After the illustrations were com- pleted, over 100 pieces of attribute data were col- lected for each figure. These data were entered into SHUMLA's searchable rock art database. We then conducted data queries to identify pat- terns and diagnostic attributes. Attributes of Red Linear Pictographs at 41W201 41 VV201 , the Red Linear type site, is located in Seminole Canyon State Park and Historic Site near the mouth of Presa Canyon. The site consists of two pictograph panels housed in a shallow, southwest-facing overhang approximately 15 m above the canyon floor, with minimal midden de- bris remaining at the site. Panel 1 is located on the downstream end of the overhang and spans 8 m long and 1 m high. In this panel, we identified 17 anthropomorphs,4 eight zoomorphs, and 1 1 enig- matic figures, including geometries (Figure 4).</page><page sequence="8">Boyd et al.] REASSESSMENT OF RED LINEAR PICTOGRAPHS 463 Figure 5.

For figures in profile, we documented which direction the fig- ure was facing from the viewer's perspective. For example, a figure facing profile right exposes the anthropomorph's right side to the viewer and, conversely, a figure facing profile left exposes the anthropomorph's left side. The arm on top is con- sidered to be associated with the unexposed side of the figure. We identified three anthropomorph body types at 41 VV201 - stick-body, curvilinear, and wide- body (Figure 6). Stick-body anthropomorphs are formed using straight, rigid lines and are por- trayed in a standing position with legs in a wide stance. They range between 3.2 cm and 23.3 cm in height (jí = 11.2cm,o-=5.1 cm). Curvilinear anthropomorphs are formed by using curved lines communicating flexibility or movement. These figures are portrayed in reclining, standing, kneel- ing, and squatting positions and range between 3.8 cm and 9.0 cm in height (ji = 5.9 cm, a= 1 .5 cm). Wide-body anthropomorphs are figures in which the torso is thicker than the arms and legs. Sometimes the wide-body torso is in-filled with paint, other times it is centrastyled with lines run- ning either horizontally or vertically across the body. Similar to the stick-body figures, their legs are positioned in a very wide stance. These figures range between 4.7 cm and 20.0 cm in height (ji = 12.7 cm, cr = 5.6 cm). Anthropomorphs were classified as male, fe- male, or genderless. Genderless figures lack any distinguishable gender marker. Figures identified as males are portrayed with erect phalluses. Two- thirds of the males have phallus attachments con- sisting of one or two lines extending downward from the end of the phallic representation. We documented this attribute for males from all three body types. Figures identified as females are por-</page><page sequence="10">Boyd et al.] REASSESSMENT OF RED LINEAR PICTOGRAPHS 465 Figure 7. Anthropomorph head shapes: (a) male, curvilinear body with a distended belly and a pointed head; (b) stick- bodied anthropomorph with a bisected head, atlatl and sticks; and (c) curvilinear body with a round head. trayed with a circle in the abdominal region. Some female figures also possess an attribute similar to a skirt, formed by two lines extending from the left and right side of the hip. Two female figures are portrayed with distended bellies suggestive of pregnancy; however, this attribute was docu- mented for males and genderless figures as well. The three body types are portrayed with three distinctive head shapes- pointed, round, and bi- sected (Figure 7). Anthropomorphs with pointed heads lack a defined neck area, and the head, or lack thereof, is simply a continuation of the torso. Figures classified as round-headed have heads that are in-filled, rounded, and wider than the torso. Bi- sected heads are not in-filled and are formed by a line dividing a circle into two equal parts. Figures with heads resembling a pair of goggles are also classified as bisected. Whereas pointed and round head shapes were identified for all three body types, bisected heads were not documented for curvilinear figures. The predominant pairing of body form and head shape is stick-bodied anthro- pomorphs portrayed with pointed heads. Anthropomorphs of all three body types are also portrayed with hair (Supplemental Figure 6). We recognize that this attribute may represent a type of headdress, but for the purpose of classi- fication we documented figures with multiple lines emitting upward from the head as ecstatic hair and lines flowing down from the head along the back of the figure as flowing hair. Ecstatic hair has been used before to describe attributes of Pecos River style figures, and we chose to keep similar terminology (e.g., Zintgraf and Turpin 1991:25). Ecstatic hair was documented for all three anthropomorphic body forms and head shapes. The only occurrence of flowing hair was documented for a stick-body figure possessing a bisected head. The ecstatic hair attribute was iden- tified on male and genderless figures, but was ab- sent on females figures. In addition to hair, we documented stick-body and wide-body anthro- pomorphs with a single hooked line projecting off the figure's head (Supplemental Figure 7). We re- fer to this type of headdress as hooked. Also, al- though difficult to discern due to mineral accre- tion and spalling, one of the curvilinear figures appears to be wearing an antler-like headdress (Figure 6a). Paraphernalia associated with anthropomorphs include atlatls, curved throwing sticks (rabbit sticks), short bars or sticks, and other unidentified objects (Supplemental Figure 8). We identified four types of atlatls: (a) atlatls with an intersect- ing horizontal bar at the proximal end; (b) atlatls with exaggerated round objects, possibly weights, attached near the distal end; (c) circle or finger- loop at the proximal end; and (d) simple atlatls with no bars, finger-loops, or weights. All atlatl types have a distinctive spur on the distal end, and laterality or handedness is based on location of the atlatl in relation to the anthropomorph's right or left hand.

Atlatls and rabbit sticks are associated mainly with male anthropomorphs, but one genderless figure is also depicted holding an atlatl. The gen- derless figure is a centrastyled, wide-bodied an- thropomorph. No female figures have been recorded holding an atlatl or rabbit stick. Short sticks, however, are wielded by male, female, and genderless figures. 41W201 Zoomorphs We documented artiodactyls,6 canids, and unidentifiable zoomorphic figures at 41VV201. As with anthropomorphs, measurements are re- ported for whole figures only. The artiodactyls range from 6.0 cm to 11.8 cm in height (já = 9.94 cm, cr= 2.4 cm) and from 9.0 cm to 15.0 cm in length ( = 12.5 cm, cr = 2.3 cm). Hooves, antlers, long necks, or thin legs were used as cri- teria for classifying these figures as artiodactyls. Artiodactyl body shapes include crescent and ovoid. One crescent-shaped, antlered artiodactyl is portrayed with protruding lips (Supplemental Figure 9), resembling the Flehmen response, a form of scent communication displayed by rut- ting bucks (Rue 1997). Canids are smaller than artiodactyls with shorter, fuller legs. They range from 1 .1 cm to 2.6 cm in height (j¿ = 1 .7 cm, a = 0.4 cm) and from 2.0 cm to 3.0 cm in length, (ß = 2.45, &lt;r = 0.4 cm). Only one unidentifiable zoomorph was undam- aged enough to consider a complete figure. It measured 2.7 cm in height and 4.0 cm in length and lacked defining characteristics associated with artiodactyls or canids. Several zoomorphic figures are portrayed with exaggerated features, such as oversized bodies with small heads and ex- tremely long legs or tails. Others exhibit an un- realistic relationship with associated imagery in the panel, such as canids standing on or hanging from the branches of a plant-like figure (Supple- mental Figure 10). All zoomorphic figures were painted in red to reddish-purple. One zoomorph, an artiodactyl, is portrayed with a patterned body. No zoomorph is spear-impaled. 41W201 Enigmatics and Geometries In Panel 1 , enigmatic and geometric forms include lines with loops, a horizontal bar beneath a row of artiodactyls, small X-shapes, and two poorly pre- served figures that may have represented anthro- pomorphs (Figure 4). In Panel 2, we identified three horizontal groupings of short vertical bars and a plant-like image emerging from the head of a stick-body anthropomorph (Figure 5).

Red Linear Style Anthropomorphs We compared anthropomorphs on the basis of at- tributes presented in Table 2. The majority of these attributes occur in strikingly similar per- centages at 41VV201 and in the expanded sam- ple. Identification of Red Linear style anthropo- morphs using attribute data collected at the type site appears to be fairly straightforward and can be made with a high degree of confidence based on body form, head shape, gender markers, and para- phernalia. One of the most striking similarities be- tween the type site and the expanded sample is the percentage of figures facing frontal versus profile. In both populations, two-thirds of the anthropo- morphs are depicted in profile; in addition, three- quarters of the profile figures are facing profile right. Laterality (e.g., handedness) is also virtually identical between the two populations (Supple- mental Table 1). Of the figures portrayed with at- latls, slightly more than half are right-handed. The percentage of left-handed figures, therefore, is significantly higher than the incidence of left- handedness (10 percent) in contemporary soci- eties (McManus 2004). The three anthropomorph body types identified at 4 1VV201 - stick-body, curvilinear, and wide- body -were used to classify figures within the ex- panded data set. All three body types are present in the expanded sample, and we encountered no new body types. As we observed at the type site, stick-body anthropomorphs occur most fre- quently. Head shapes identified at 41VV201 - pointed, round, and bisected- were documented at sites throughout the study area and are associ- ated with all three anthropomorph body types. No new head shapes were identified. Stick-bodied figures with pointed heads are the most frequently occurring combination of body type and head shape for Red Linear anthropomorphs (Table 3). Ecstatic and flowing hair are present in low per- centages in both populations and were only asso- ciated with stick- and wide-bodied figures. Hooked headdresses, however, were observed for all three body types and head shapes. The majority of Red Linear anthropomorphs possess gender markers. Males are the dominant gender type and are frequently portrayed with phallus attachments, an attribute unique to the Red Linear style. We documented phallus attach- ments for all three body types both at 41VV201 and in the expanded data set. Distended bellies, which have previously been reported as repre- senting pregnancy (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967), are portrayed on males, females, and gen- derless figures. We identified four atlatl forms at 41VV201 and no new atlatl types were encountered (Sup- plemental Table 2). At the type site and in the ex- panded sample, atlatls with a grip bar at the prox- imal end occur in the greatest number. In both samples, atlatls and rabbit sticks are overwhelm- ingly identified with males (Table 4). No female is wielding an atlatl or a rabbit stick. The only para- phernalia associated with females appears to be the short bar or stick. At the type site, males, females, and genderless figures are portrayed holding these objects, giving the appearance of arms bent at the elbow (Figure 5c). In the expanded data set, the short bar or stick is represented less frequently and is wielded only by males. Diminutive scale and red color are perhaps the most frequently cited characteristics for Red Linear figures. Although all anthropomorphic fig- ures at the type site were painted in a reddish hue, we identified 15 yellow and 13 black figures in</page><page sequence="14">Boyd et al.] REASSESSMENT OF RED LINEAR PICTOGRAPHS 469 Table 4.

There are likely many more yellow- and possibly white- figures that have gone unrecorded. The majority of anthropo- morphs at the type site are less than 10 cm in height, a trend that holds true across the region (Table 5). Curvilinear figures exhibit the least variation in height, but the dominant stick-bodied figures exhibit the greatest variation in size. Both the shortest and tallest figures recorded are stick- bodied. The tallest figure stands 56 cm in height- 20 cm taller than any other Red Linear anthropomorph (Supplemental Figure 11). This apparent outlier, however, possesses attributes characteristic of Red Linear style. It is a stick- body figure with a bisected head, hooked head- dress, and a phallus. The painter of this image formed the torso through a series of dash marks and omitted arms, conveying a preternatural qual- ity to the figure. Thus, a description of the style as diminutive oversimplifies the range of variation present among Red Linear anthropomorphs. Red Linear Style Zoomorphs Classification of zoomorphs as Red Linear style is far more complex than anthropomorphs. Zoomorphs at the type site and in the expanded data set reflect greater variation than anthropo- Table 5.

Classification of these figures is based on the presence of multiple attributes, in- cluding size, body shape, subject, and context, es- pecially when in association with Red Linear style anthropomorphs. We documented artiodactyls, canids, and unidentifiable zoomorphic figures at 41VV201. In the expanded sample, we docu- mented 130 zoomorphic figures- 81 artiodactyls, four canids, and 45 unidentified quadrupeds (Table 6). Whereas at the type site canids are represented in the greatest number, in the expanded sample, ar- tiodactyls are more prevalent. Artiodactyls at the type site are portrayed with crescent and ovoid body shapes, frequently pos- sessing exaggerated qualities, such as extremely long legs and tails or disproportionally large bod- ies with small heads. They are portrayed with or without antlers and with or without hooves and dew claws. This is consistent in the expanded sample, with one noteworthy exception; none of the artiodactyls in the expanded sample are por- trayed with dew claws. Also consistent with the type site is the portrayal of deer with protruding lips resembling lip curl or Flehmen response dis- played by rutting bucks (Rue 1997). Although this is not an attribute associated with all Red Lin- ear style artiodactyls, no Pecos River style figures have been documented with protruding lips. The range in body proportions for artiodactyls at other sites in the study is greater than at the type site. Artiodactyls were measured from bottom of the front leg to top of the shoulder. They range from 1 .6 cm to 14.6 cm in height (jí = 5.6 cm, a = 2.9 cm). Their body length was measured from tip of tail to tip of nose. Artiodactyls range from 2.0 cm to 21 .5 cm in length (ß =1.1 cm, a = 3.8 cm). As noted for artiodactyls at the type site, body proportions are exaggerated, in particular the height to length ratio (Supplemental Figure 12). Pecos River style deer documented at the study sites average 13.9 cm in height and 33.4 cm in length, with a height to length ratio of 42 per- cent. Red Linear style deer average 5.6 cm in height and 7.7 cm in length, with a significantly greater height to length ratio of 73 percent. In ad- dition, hind legs are frequently portrayed even longer than front legs (Supplemental Figure 13). More than 50 percent of unidentified quadrupeds are so badly obscured or spalled that classification is difficult or impossible. Additional zoomorphs classified as unidentified, however, include figures not readily recognized in nature. Preternatural zoomorphs are portrayed as conflations of more than one animal or are animals that possess attrib- utes typically associated with anthropomorphs. An example of the latter of these was documented at Mystic Shelter. At this site, an artiodactyl is por- trayed wielding two rabbit sticks and two short sticks (Supplemental Figure 14). Preternatural zoomorphs are also portrayed with extremely over- stated features, such as a quadruped at Cueva Que- brada with a neck five times the length of its body (Supplemental Figure 15a). Other unusual examples include a conflated figure with an ant-shaped body, huge claws, and a short tail or stinger from Cueva Quebrada (Supplemental Figure 15b) and an artio- dactyl with a disproportionally round body at Mys- tic Shelter (Figures 3a and 3b; Supplemental Fig- ures 4a and 4b). This figure from Mystic Shelter is one of the two bison examples identified by Turpin in Red Linear style rock art. However, the figure is portrayed with antlers and more likely represents a deer as opposed to a bison. In addition, four of the 13 figures at Cueva Quebrada Turpin (1984) previously identified as bison we classify as unidentified zoomorphs (Fig- ures 3c and 3d; Supplemental Figures 4c and 4d). Two of these are painted without necks or heads, the other two with necks, but no heads. All four lack hooves or any other diagnostic features that can be used to classify them as artiodactyls. The remaining nine figures are simply ovoid shapes lacking legs, heads, or any zoomorphic features. We classified these as enigmatics. All zoomorphs at the type site were painted in various shades of red and, in one case, centrastyled or pattern-bodied. Although red was by far the dominant color documented in the expanded sam- ple, we also recorded monochromatic Red Linear style zoomorphs in yellow, black, and white. De- tecting yellow and white zoomorphs is difficult due to obscuration by mineral accretions, likely re- sulting in underreporting of yellow and white fig- ures. Zoomorphs painted in colors other than red all possessed salient characteristics associated with the style, such as morphology and scale, and are in the context of other Red Linear style imagery. Only four zoomorphs are represented with pat- terned bodies in the expanded data set.</page><page sequence="16">Boyd et al.] REASSESSMENT OF RED LINEAR PICTOGRAPHS 471 (A XJ I "2* CO o3 c J 5 o&lt; o&lt; 6 ui I &lt; vo D 1 ^ ^ r-^ m co vq co »-h co cn 00 o o o o sq o o oo es r-; en ^ ^ «O OOTtOrfíN »O ^t" COVO O Q O Q (N O Ó Tf iri iri rfr -g ON «O o O OS o OnOO^h ß r-HVO r^«Nin&lt;N'-&lt; »O eS IT) (N O On o ON i-h ^ o oo m =**= (N (N CO Tt &lt;N (N O On &lt;N o ON &lt;N i-h &lt;&lt;t es ^ o oo Ì-h OO Tt »-H CN SO *-&lt; On O O O O »O »O OO OO (N CO 3 Tt £ £- -&lt;t ^ ' ^ es £ ^ *-&lt; oo OO OO &lt;n o ó ^ ^ in ^ fi &lt;8 Tt m t- - ' ON in tJ- O O On O On 00 »-h I a C »-i M « c-Sstfc O wì &gt;c n «n n - 1 m (N mes o r- o on o On o oo co d&gt;0 &lt;N CS (N (N CO (N -&lt; o o o O.

It is possible that red was introduced into existing black figures by later artists. In at least one example, a dry-applied red tail and a red fletched spear appear to have been added to a wet- applied black zoomorph. The fact that this is the only known impaled figure in Red Linear style rock art raises the possibility of touch-up by later artists. This is in sharp contrast to Pecos River style, in which every artiodactyl documented at sites included in this analysis is impaled by a spear in the gut, leg, head, or back. Red Linear Style Geometries and Enigmatics The dominant and most distinctive Red Linear style enigmatic identified at the type site is the looped line (Figure 4). This pictographic element accounted for 3 1 .5 percent of geometric images in the expanded data set. Each occurrence of looped lines is associated with artiodactyls. Based on work conducted by Tratebas (2000) and Sundstrom (1989), Mark and Billo (2009) have suggested that the looped lines represent hunting nets or snares. Given the close association of looped lines with ar- tiodactyls, this interpretation appears sound. The next most frequently occurring geometric is groupings of ovals and of bars. Other imagery in this category includes such things as amor- phous shapes, grids, angular lines, and series of small dots. With the exception of lines with loops, no other geometric or enigmatic figures possess attributes unique to the Red Linear style. Ovals, bars, grids, and others are found among all rock art styles in the Lower Pecos. Classification of fig- ures in this category is far more ambiguous than either anthropomorphs or zoomorphs and is based on context and association with other Red Linear figures. Red Linear Style and Superpositioning Turpin's identification of 41VV201 as the type site for Red Linear was supported by this analy- sis. Based on our examination of 444 Red Linear figures from 12 sites throughout the Lower Pecos Canyonlands, we determined that 41VV201 is generally representative of the Red Linear style. The salient attributes we identified at the type site proved useful for categorization of pic- tographs at other sites in the region, including fig- ures superimposed by presumed older Pecos River style paintings. During our documentation project we observed 38 occurrences of Pecos River style painted over Red Linear-like figures- 27 anthropomorphs and 11 zoomorphs (Table 7). We did not identify any occurrences of Red Lin- ear images overlapping Pecos River style in the expanded sample. However, 16 examples of su- perpositioning involving the two styles were in- determinate due to obscuration by mineral accre- tions and similarity in color. Table 8 provides an attribute comparison between the superimposed Red Linear-like figures and the larger sample of Red Linear anthropomorphs documented across the region. We will focus our discussion on three super- imposed anthropomorphs, a wide-bodied figure at Mystic Shelter (41 VV612), a stick-bodied figure at Panther Cave (41 VV83), and a curvilinear fig- ure at Halo Shelter (41VV1230).

Mystic Shelter (41W612) Mystic Shelter is located in a tributary canyon along the Devils River. The rock art panel at this site spans 21m and contains at least 276 figures. Of the 276 figures, 143 have been classified as Red Linear style according to the diagnostic at- tributes discussed above, with the remaining fig- ures classified as Pecos River style. Although Red Linear imagery spans the entire length of the panel, the majority of images are located</page><page sequence="19">474 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 78, No. 3, 2013 within the downstream half of the shelter inter- mixed with a dense concentration of Pecos River style imagery. Numerous Red Linear figures in this section of the panel are badly obscured and poorly preserved, precluding documentation. We have documented 19 examples of Pecos River style superimposing Red Linear style at Mystic Shelter- 15 anthropomorphs and four zoomorphs. One of these zoomorphs is the small red deer that Turpin (1984) reported previously as overlain by older Pecos River style rock art, but ar- gued that the deer was not Red Linear style. The reddish-purple zoomorph overlain by the spear impaling a Pecos River style deer is classified as an artiodactyl based on the presence of hooves (Figure 1, Supplemental Figure 1). It has a short tail and long front legs with even longer hind legs that curl up under the belly of the animal. The fig- ure measures 4.7 cm in height and 8.1 cm in length, with a height to length ratio of 58 percent. It is portrayed in profile, oriented with its head and body facing downward at an azimuth of 225 de- grees. This Red Linear figure is not impaled, al- though it is superimposed by the spear impaling a large Pecos River style deer located directly above it. Based on body morphology, exaggeratedly long legs, lack of spear-impalement, and association with other Red Linear figures, we maintain that this superimposed figure is a Red Linear deer. Turpin argues that this small red deer is styl- istically different than two zoomorphs located di- rectly in front of it. These two red figures are iden- tified by Turpin (1984) as Red Linear deer. They are oriented at 225 degrees azimuth with their head and body facing downward at the same an- gle as the superimposed deer. Neither of the two Red Linear deer is impaled. The lead figure has a short tail and long front legs with longer hind legs curling up under its body in a manner similar to the figure superimposed by the spear impaling the Pecos River style deer. The other zoomorph lacks hooves and has a long tail. This figure is partially obscured by the front leg and chest of the Pecos River style deer. We have confirmed through mul- tiple on-site inspections and exhaustive digital photo analysis that the leg of the Pecos River style deer superimposes the leg of this zoomorph Turpin identified as Red Linear. Among the 15 Red Linear anthropomorphs superimposed by Pecos River style paintings at Mystic Shelter is a wide-bodied Red Linear style figure standing 11 .8 cm in height (Figure 8, Sup- plemental Figure 16). It is portrayed facing pro- file right with legs frontally posed in a wide stance, similar in execution to the wide-bodied, centrastyled anthropomorph located in association with the superimposed zoomorphs discussed above. The figure is male, as evidenced by the presence of a phallus. It is overlain by an enig- matic U-shape painted in yellow and outlined in red. The red outline and thickly applied yellow paint obscure greater than half of the Red Linear figure's body, including its paraphernalia. A large black atlatl loaded with a red dart is also super- imposed by the enigmatic U-shape, as is the black wrist adornment attached to the arm of the Pecos River anthropomorph wielding the atlatl. Above the atlatl is a large Pecos River style deer whose hind legs superimpose the U-shape. This deer is virtually identical to the one superimposing the Red Linear zoomorph discussed above. The wide- body anthropomorph, therefore, is superimposed by at least two layers of Pecos River paintings. Panther Cave (41W0083) Panther Cave is located at the confluence of Semi- nole Canyon with the Rio Grande along the banks of Amistad International Reservoir. It is a large rock shelter measuring 57 m across and 17 m deep; the roof rises 15 m or more above the floor. The shelter walls are covered with hundreds of pictographs. To date, we have documented 262 Pecos River style figures and four Red Linear style stick-body anthropomorphs at this site. There are likely many more Red Linear figures hidden within the dense population of Pecos River style figures. One of the stick-body figures is superimposed by at least two layers of Pecos River style paint- ings (Figure 9, Supplemental Figure 17). The Red Linear anthropomorph is a male, painted in black, standing 1 1 .9 cm in height. It has a bisected head, is facing profile right, and is wielding an atlatl with a grip bar in its left hand and short sticks in its right hand. The anthropomorph's right leg is overlain by the lower jaw of a large, round, red Pecos River anthropomorph. Red lines emit out of the mouth of this figure and cross over the torso of the Red Linear stick-body anthropomorph. Both figures are overlain by the leg of a white</page><page sequence="20">Boyd et al.] REASSESSMENT OF RED LINEAR PICTOGRAPHS 475 Figure 8.

Section of panel where Pecos River images superimpose Red Linear figures: (a) photograph; (b) illustration. See Supplemental Figure 18 for color image. Pecos River anthropomorph decorated with black and yellow fringe. Halo Shelter (41 W 1230) Halo Shelter is located west of the Devils River in a tributary canyon of Dead Man's Creek. The rock art spans 32 m, however the vast majority of the imagery is contained in the upstream end of the panel. At Halo Shelter, we documented 133 Pecos River style figures and 11 Red Lin- ear figures. Six of the Red Linear anthropo- morphs, and one zoomorph, are overlain by Pecos River style paintings (Figure 10; Supple- mental Figure 18). One of the superimposed figures is a curvilin- ear anthropomorph (Figure 1 1 ; Supplemental Fig- ure 19) measuring 8.2 cm in height, with legs in a kneeling position. It is portrayed with a round head facing profile right. The figure is badly spalled in the abdominal region, making identifi- cation of gender impossible. It is located 8 cm to the left of a large polychromatic, yellow and red Pecos River style anthropomorph. A red fringed oval runs underneath the midsection of the Pecos River style anthropomorph and crosses over the head of the curvilinear figure. This demonstrates that the Red Linear figure was painted not only before the Pecos River figure, but also prior to ex- ecution of the fringed oval (Figure 12). Although the fringed oval lacks any attributes necessary for classification into any stylistic category, the yellow anthropomorph superimposing it is clearly Pecos River style. Five stick-bodied anthropomorphs, some of which are holding onto the legs of an artiodactyl, are overlain by Pecos River style (Figure 13; Supplemental Figure 20). The artiodactyl is also overlain by the red fringed oval. These figures are located left of the yellow Pecos River anthropo- morph and above the curvilinear figure. Sadly, the limestone support for these figures is badly spalled. As a result, the torsos of at least three stick-body figures are lost. A large swath of yel- low pigment, identical to that used to paint the yellow Pecos River anthropomorph, superim- poses the remnant Red Linear figures and is painted into the spalled area where their torsos used to be. This band of paint extends across the panel, superimposing the yellow Pecos River style anthropomorph and the red fringed oval. Therefore, not only did the Red Linear figures predate the Pecos River paintings, but the spall predated production of the Pecos River figures as well.</page><page sequence="23">478 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 78, No. 3, 201 3 Figure 11. Halo Shelter (41W1230). Curvilinear figure overlain by a band of red paint superimposed by Pecos River paintings: (a) original photograph; (b) photograph with illustration. See Supplemental Figure 19 for color image. Conclusions Red Linear is a style governed by rules, having a specific set of conventions directing how figures are portrayed. Previously reported descriptions for Red Linear pictographs as red, monochro- matic, miniature, stick figures (Gebhard 1960; Kirkland and Newcomb 1967) do not accurately reflect the range of variation we documented at the type site or the 1 1 other sites. Rather, the Red Linear style is best described as a matrix of at- tributes, not as a single color, size or body shape; it is polythetic in nature. "In a fully polythetic group of artifacts, (1) each artifact possesses a (large) number of the attributes of the group; (2) each attribute may be found in a (large) number of the artifacts in the group; and (3) no single at- tribute is found in every artifact of the group" (Davis 1990:19). This recently acquired and greatly expanded data set requires a reconsidera- tion of what we previously thought we knew about Red Linear rock art, not just in terms of its salient characteristics, but also in terms of its temporal relationship to Pecos River style and previous hypotheses regarding the culture(s) that produced them. The three examples from Mystic Shelter, Pan- ther Cave, and Halo Shelter, along with 35 other examples, demonstrate that Pecos River style pic- tographs superimpose Red Linear images through- out the region. We have not identified any exam- ples of Red Linear superimposing Pecos River style. The principle of superposition establishes that layers are deposited in chronological order (Harris 1989); layers located closest to the rock surface were painted prior to those overlying them (Loubser 2011). The superpositioning of Pecos River images over Red Linear style establishes that Red Linear pictographs were painted first. When they were painted is another question. The principle of stratification places layers only into a relative sequence; it says nothing about the dura- tion of time between sequences. The Red Linear figures may have been painted hours, days, or years before the Pecos River paintings. Continu- ing investigation is necessary to assess whether there are examples of Red Linear superimposing Pecos River style at sites beyond those included in</page><page sequence="24">Boyd et al.] REASSESSMENT OF RED LINEAR PICTOGRAPHS 479 Figure 12. Halo Shelter (41W1230). Stick-body anthropomorphs and a curvilinear figure are overlain by a red band, a Pecos River anthropomorph, and a wide swath of yellow paint identical in color to the Pecos River figure. this analysis. Additionally, radiocarbon dating of both assemblages is essential to determine ab- solute chronologies for the region. Stratigraphie analyses, such as presented, provide archaeologists with critical information necessary for selecting appropriate paint samples for dating. In analyzing the temporal relationship between Red Linear and Pecos River style, we must discuss the possible functional relationship of both art styles. Red Linear style was previously thought to deal only with the mundane or profane, in contrast to the sacred world of the Pecos River style artists (Turpin 2011). According to Turpin (2011), the dissimilarity between the two styles is so vast that they likely did not come from the same cultural system. "The contrast between the Pecos River and Red Linear styles permeates the whole range of defining variables: size- large vs. small, color- polychrome vs. monochrome, tone- static vs. active, intent- formal vs. narrative, mores- spiritual vs. sexual" (Turpin 201 1 :5). Based on our analysis, however, these "defining variables" be- come blurred. We have documented Red Linear figures possessing preternatural qualities, such as a deer wielding paraphernalia, conflated animals, and centrastyled anthropomorphs- all traits that before were associated only with Pecos River style. As Whitney Davis (1990:20) argues, "The polythetic nature of stylistic description implies that ultimately it is fruitless to look for neat or ab-</page><page sequence="25">480 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 78, No. 3, 2013 Figure 13. Halo Shelter (41VV1230). Badly spalled stick-body anthropomorphs superimposed by yellow paint associated with a Pecos River style anthropomorph: (a) photograph; (b) illustration. See Supplemental Figure 20 for color image. solute boundaries for and between styles." The blurring of attributes between Pecos River and Red Linear suggests that the stylistic differences may be functional and/or gender related rather than strictly cultural. David Whitley (2005:49) and others (Domingo Sanz 2012:310; Layton 1 99 1 : 1 5 1 ) argue that a single culture can produce more than one style of art and, if two styles of art are identified within one culture, it allows for "one to pass beyond general hypotheses of technical or perceptual limitation, and instead examine cul- tural reasons for the development of particular styles" (Layton 1991:151). The Pecos River and Red Linear styles may or may not have been pro- duced by the same cultures; however, at this time there is insufficient data to support the use of artis- tic style as a marker for ethnicity. Rock art is an archaeological feature and is subject to the same methods utilized in field ar- chaeology. Detailed description of these complex panels reveals the processes that produced the compositions, aids in identification of diagnostic attributes for rock art assemblages, and reveals in- ter- and intra-site patterning of attributes. Identi- fying the chain of operations leads to an under- standing of the rules that guided production of the art and provides insight into relative chronologies for rock art assemblages. It is only through metic- ulous description and robust analyses that we are able to identify the rules and patterns that form the foundation of the art. Acknowledgments.

In April 2011, a group of archaeologists and chemists were invited by the authors to the Lower Pecos to authenticate superpositioning of Pecos River style over Red Linear. They verified SHUMLA's findings and recommended an in-depth examination of a larger sample of Red Linear in order to bet- ter define the style and understand its relationship to other pic- tograph styles in the region, which resulted in this paper (Cas- tañeda et al. 2012). 2. The eight Red Linear sites reported were 41VV74, 41VV78, 41VV162A, 41VV201, 41VV282, 41VV324, 41VV408, and 41VV612. In 1990, Turpin expanded the in- ventory of sites containing Red Linear style rock art to 11, which included three new sites on the Devils River- 41 VV700, 41 VV888, and 41 VV1000. 3. Dino-Lite Pro AM413T 10X-20X, 220X Variable Mag- nification. 4. One of the 17 anthropomorphs (figure portrayed with a long neck and holding an arch over its head) is very dim and stylistically different from all other figures in the panel. New- comb (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:94) suggests that this figure is probably from an early period of the Pecos River style. Although we disagree with Newcomb's classification based upon our analysis of Pecos River style, we agree that it does not fall within the range of variation for Red Linear style identified at the type site or other sites containing Red Linear imagery. Therefore, the figure is not included in this analysis. 5. Two figures were lost to spalling in 1982 (Turpin 1982:107). These are not included in this analysis. 6. We use the term artiodactyls in our recording project to allow for non-Cervidae species to be recorded (e.g., bison, javelina, etc.). 7.
