<plain_text><page sequence="1">0£Ó&lt;;, Aaífacov, Opfjvlepií: Empedocles and the Divine Résumé. —L'auteur analyse d'abord la relation entre Theos et Daimôn dans le Poème Physique et dans les Purifications. Dans le premier, Empédocle appelle theoi le Sphairos et les éléments. Précisément, le philosophe d'Acragas appelle le Sphairos tout simplement theos. Pourtant, il appelle les éléments theoi dolichaiônes, alors qu 'ils forment quatre masses séparées et avant qu'ils ne se mêlent pour constituer les «choses mortelles » ; tandis que, lorsqu'ils se mêlent et abandonnent la condition de pureté pour créer un composé, il les appelle daimones. D'autre part, dans les Purifications, les daimones sont les dieux tombés dans le monde: redevenir un dieu, c'est la destinée de l'homme, ou au moins l'objectif qu'Empé docle propose. Enfin, l'auteur soutient que les frgs. B131-134 (dont le dernier concerne la fameuse phrèn hierèj pourraient provenir de l'Hymne à Apollon perdu. C'est ce que semble démontrer le fait qu'Empédocle suive dans ces fragments une ligne dogmatique à propos de la connaissance des dieux qui contraste avec la prudente gnoséologie suivie dans le Poème Physique et par la difference entre la théologie exposée dans ces fragments et le mythe eschatologique présenté dans les Purifications. Abstract. — The author starts by analyzing the relationship between Theos and Dai môn in the Physical Poem and in the Purifications. In the former poem it is the Sphairos and the elements which are called theoi. Ai a matter of fact, the Sphairos is called simply theos. The elements, instead, are called theoi dolichaiônes, when they are set in four separate masses and anyway before mingling up together in order to beget "mortal things whereas, when they mingle up, and pass from a pure condition into a compound, they are called daimones. On the other hand, in the Purifications it is the fallen gods who are called daimones: to become a god again is man's destiny, or at least the aim proposed by Empedocles. Lastly, the author maintains that frgs. B131-134 (the last of which concerning the famous phrèn hierèj might belong to the lost Hymn to Apollo — this is shown by the dogmatic approach to the knowledge of the gods, which is here taken by Empedocles, contrary to the cautious gnoseology defended in the Physical Poem; and by the theology taught in those fragments, which is very different from the eschatological myth introdu ced in the Purifications: Revue de Métaphysique et de Morale, N° 3/2012</page><page sequence="2">302 Carlo Santaniello For Mario Manfredini, A great scholar and a generous man. In memory I believe that no classical author has ever depicted so close a relationship between the Divine and the world — and, above all, between god and man — as Empedocles. Not even Pindar, who was compelled by his loyalty to Greek tradi tion to add many qualifications to the flattering statement that "the race of men and gods is one ; and we both receive life from one and the same mother".1 In a sense, this close relationship, so difficult to grasp for today's Westerners still so deeply pervaded by Christian culture, is implied and represented by Greek ôcù (loveç, both before Empedocles (Hesiod, especially) and after him (Plato and many others down to the end of antiquity). According to the index published in the third volume of D.-K., 0eó&lt;; occurs in some fragments currently ascribed to the Physical Poem: B3.1, B21.12 (a line also reconstructed in PStrasb a.II.2, and resumed, though declined at the accusa tive, in B23.8), B23.ll and B31. ©eôç also occurs in some fragments currently ascribed to the Purifications: B112.4; B115.1; B128.1; B131.4; B132.2; and B146.3. Aaí|itúv occurs once in the Physical Poem (B59.1), and once in the Purifications (B115.5).2 I. THEOS Let me deal with the fragments from the Physical Poem first. B31 very clearly states the divinity of the Sphairos, which is also witnessed by Arist., Metaph. B 4.1000b 3 ff. and GC B 6.333b 19 ff.=A40.3 We know that the elements are divine too from another fragment, B6, where they are mentioned by the names of four gods (their divinity is confirmed by Aristotle in A40 itself and by Aet. 1.7.28=A32). As to the other fragments pertaining to the Physical Poem, the occurrences of 0eóc; in B3.1 (evidently, from the proem) and B23.ll seem to be of a merely literary concern. In fact, the words in B3.1 (àXÀà 0eoi tcúv |ièv |iavír|v ànoxpé \|/aT£ Y^waarjc;), an invocation that Empedocles and his pupil Pausanias may be spared the folly of other philosophical schools (ttôv (xèv), remind me of the 1.

I think it would be rather naive to identify the "god" in question with Empedocles, just because he refers to himself as "an immortal god, no longer mortal" in B 112.4. First of all, the latter fragment is one of those surely belonging to the Ka0ap|ioi, as witnessed by D. L. 8.62 (see ad B112: ...évapxó|ievoi; tcùv Ka0ap|i(Sv), and I know no example of passages of the Physical Poem that are understandable only by refer ring to a passage of the Purifications. Secondly, I believe that no god whatever would mention his own divinity in such a plain, trivial way. Thirdly, B3.3-5 neatly declares that the physical doctrine is inspired to Empedocles by the Muse — so the Muse is the goddess in question (as is well-known, 0eoc; may be both masculine and feminine).5 As far as the Physical Poem is concerned, only B21.12 (=PStrasb a.II.2~B23.8) is left. Here is my translation of B21 : Now, look at this witness of my previous exposition, If anything in what preceded was lacking as to the form — The sun bright to see and hot everywhere, And such immortal bodies as bathe in heat and shining light, And rain, dark and cold in everything; 5 And from the earth flows out what is well-founded and steady. Under Strife they are all different in shape and separate, But in Love they meet and long for each other. From these arises everything that was and is and will be hence — Trees have grown from them, and men and women, 10 Beasts, and birds, and fish nurtured in water, And long-lived gods, most-honoured. It is them, and, by running through each other, They become different; so much does the mixing change them. Scholars have often wondered what the 0eoi &lt;5oÁi)(aítúV£c; are. We had better take into account the context of the passage, which is obviously the Physical Poem. Here the gods are the deified elements (and this goes also for Nestis who, as Aidoneus' spouse, is very likely to be identified with Persephone). In 4. Bollack III, 1 (1969) 26 thinks that 0eoí refers to the six powers; but, in consideration of the obvious proemial role of the fragment, it is not likely that Empedocles would refer to them before introducing them to his public. Wright (1981) 158 does not deal with this matter. Cerri (2001) 183 seems to be of the opinion upheld by me here. 5. The various interpretations of the 0£0ç mentioned at B23.ll are listed by Wright (1981) 181: she identifies the divinity mentioned with the Muse.</page><page sequence="4">304 Carlo Santaniello fact, B21 seems to describe first the elemental masses, indicated through sym bols (11. 3-6), then what originates from them: trees, human beings, etc. (11. 9-11) and the "long-lived gods" themselves (1. 12), i.e. the elements. These are no longer collected in masses but they are about to start "running through each other" in order that everything may be generated.6 Of course, the gods/elements are described as "long-lived" because their immortal life as separate elements is bound to be interrupted when they come together to form 0vqrá, "mortal things".7 In addition to the elements, the Sphairos itself might be one of the 0eol ôoXixaicoveç,8 as it is meant to dissolve so that the world may be started. But it is called simply "god" in B31 (see above), and, as an expression of the One and of necessity, it has some affinity (although should not be identified with) the Holy Mind/Apollo of B134. What is most important is to avoid all confusion among physics and "daimo nology".9 II. THEOS AND DAIMÔN What about the only occurrence of ôai^icov in the Physical Poem, at B59.1 ("and when ôaiiiovec; mixed up more and more together...")? No mingling of Love and Strife is ever admitted of by Empedocles; as a matter of fact, the verb (i£Íyvi)|ii in Empedocles always points to the elements mixing up with each other to beget things.10 But why are elements referred to as 0eol ôoÀ.ixcùœvec; at B21 and elsewhere, and as 5ai(iovec; here? Because in the former instance Empedocles is considering the time spent by elements as separate from each other and divine; whereas in the latter case Empedocles is describing elements mixing up with each other, i.e. accepting to give up their identity to form "mortal things".11 When the immortal and pure elements become mortal and mix up with each other (B35.14 15), their divinity seems to be downgraded from real to potential. 6. By the way, this expression is regarded simply as a poetical locution, but we should perhaps take it literally and imagine small particles of each element "running" among those of the other; all such particles preserve their original character. This is what Arist. GC B 7.334a 28 ff. (=A43) says, in expressing his dissatisfaction with the Empedoclean theory of mixture. See also Galen's passages in A34. 7. Cp. B35.14: «At once those, who had previously learnt to be immortal, became mortal». 8. It is, according to Primavesi (2008) 256. On the Sphairos as a long-lived god see already Bignone (1916) 414, and Trépanier (2004) 128, not quoted by Primavesi. Bollack (1969) III, 1, 118-119 apparently prefers to consider only the deified elements. 9. According to B23.10, 0eoi ôoXixakovex; must be included in "the countless mortal things that are to be seen"; this rules out the traditional gods or even the Ôaifioveç of the Ka0ap|ioi (and maybe also the Sphairos ?), as all these were not to be seen. 10. Cp. Wright (1981) 212. Already Knatz (1891) 9 rightly understood this as a reference to the elements. 11. Cp. Primavesi (2008) 255 ff.</page><page sequence="5">©eôç Aaí/uwv, Oprjv 'Iepr¡: Empedocles and the Divine 305 Therefore, in this instance the word &lt;5cti|iu)v seems to indicate a potentially divine condition which can develop into reality only when the elements are sepa rate from each other. And now to the Ka0ap|iOÍ. ©eol and 5ai|iovec; figure in one of the most fasci nating examples of Greek poetry, ft. 115, which I prefer to read as edited by J. Bollack.12 The Sai^ovec; guilty of a bloody crime and a peijure are exiled by a decree of the gods from their mysterious see into the world.13 As we know from B146-147 that the goal of the vast journey made by 6ai|iove&lt;; through every status in nature is the return to the divine condition, it is very likely that the banished 6ai(iovec; belonged to the number of the gods who made the decree. This is confirmed by comparison with Hes. Th. 780-806, where a forsworn god is depri ved of his divine status. The difference between the locutions Geo! SoÁi^aícovec; (B21.12) and ôaipovec; oí Te (aaKpaítüvoc; XeÀàxaai (3íoio (fr. 115.5: "daimons to whom long-lasting life is allotted") confirms that the 0eo1 ôoXixaiiûveç cannot be identified with the Sai |iov£ç of the Ka0ap|ioi.14 Of course, physics and 'daimonology' are linked by analogy. The break of the Sphairos has been repeatedly compared with the cpôvoç committed by the guilty ôaijatov. But there are differences too. Above all, the Sphairos exists only till it breaks down to allow for the elements to bring about the world, whereas the community of the Blessed is preserved when the culprit is exiled and is compelled to wander through nature: one can be banished only from a surviving community (cp. fr. 115.6: ano ¡iaicáptov à\àÀ.r|a0ai). This entails a great difference between the elements and the SctipovEc;. The former are described as having a definite identity only when they are assembled in four separate, pure masses after the rupture of the Sphairos and before they mix up to form things. Their identity is lost in the Sphairos owing to the mixing, although their divinity is transmitted to the Sphairos itself. As for the ôai|iov£c;, they express a divine principle present in every individual thing or animal or man after the primordial guilt, and therefore they are supposed to move towards reaching the Blessed again.15 All of them (or, at least, some16) will indeed join them after gaining the highest ranks among men (see B146-147); at B112.4, where Empedocles refers to the hommage already paid to him by his friends, he 12. Bollack (2003) 60. 13. See Santaniello (forthcoming). 14. Such identification is upheld by Karsten (1838) 504; Mansfeld (1981) 284 n58; Wright (1981) 273. It is denied by Detœnne (1959) 4 ff.; Darcus (1977) 186 and other scholars already quoted, like Bollack. 15. An idea of condivision is perhaps to be inferred from the etymological connection with ôaio|Ku: cp. Andres (1918) 267. 16. Cp. Mansfeld (1981) 284-285.</page><page sequence="6">306 Carlo Santaniello implies that he will attain such divine status. And, although not all of the scho lars are willing to admit that a "continuity of the self' should be recognised in the peregrinations of the daimon,17 it cannot be denied that the picture (preser ved by Clemens Alexandrinus, B 147.1) of the daimons going back to share the table of the other Blessed implies that the same entities as were exiled from such community are reaching back their original divine status; and a plurality of beings manifesting mutual love, each of them enjoying the divine status, is clearly mentioned. Another difference is worth noting. While the elements are called 0eoi SoXi Xaicûveç Ti(if)oi (pépier-roi (B21.12) with reference to their original condition as four separate masses, B146 describes the end of the journey of the daimons: after attaining the exceptional condition of seers, poets, physicians or political chiefs, they become 0eol xipfjai cpepicrroi.18 So, only up to a certain point is this highest status reached by daimons analo gous to that of the elements. Indeed, the elements seem to lack their individuality when mixed up in the Sphairos, then they gain it as they collect themselves in four separate masses at the rupture of the Sphairos, and lose it again when they mix up to bring about things. Instead, the óaípovEc; are gods first, then they lose their full divine status when banished from the Blessed, and finally they win such status back when (or if) they complete their peregrination through nature. They are now àxeipelc;, "undestructible" (B 147.2), whereas the elements are described as ctidvr|Toi Kcrrà kùkàov ("unchanged in the cycle"), because they are to keep their divine status only for a long time (that is why they are ôoXixaiûJveç) before losing it again. So elements and ôai|iov£&lt;; develop in two related but opposite ways — and the latter might even keep their newly regained divine status forever. III. ONE MORE THEOLOGY Empedocles teaches a theological physics in the Ilspi cpúcreuic; and a "daimono logical" and eschatological theology in the Ka0ap|ioi. It is well-known how difficult scholars have found it to assign fragments to one or the other of his poems. The four frgs. B131-134 have offered as many problems as any other. They have been ascribed to the Physical Poem by Stein, and later by Bignone, and Wright, and to the Purifications by Diels and later by Wilamowitz and 17. Alt (1987) 397 will acknowledge «die Kontinuitat eines Ich»; contra Wilamowitz (1935) 517-521, but not persuasively. 18. Cp. the difference mentioned above between the elements, 9eol ôoXixaiurveç, and the Sphairos, called just 0eôç</page><page sequence="7">&amp;£0ç Aaífjwv, 0pr)v Isprj: Empedocles and the Divine 307 Bollack; Zuntz and Alt have even assigned B133.134 to the former poem and B131.132 to the latter; no party has brought forward any decisive arguments.19 The lectio tradita of B131.1 has been understood and persuasively shown to be correct by Gallavotti (eix dp'é(pr||iepííov svekév tivoc; ktX.).20 So, the wrong emendation e'i yàp kt\. should be put aside. The reading transmitted shows the proemial character of the fragment very clearly. And such character results also from the reference to a previous occasion in which Kalliopeia granted her help to Empedocles "for the sake of one of the mortal men" — which seems to point to frgs. Bl, B2 (where at 11.3-4 the poet beseeches one unnamed Musa and alludes to the è&lt;pr)|iépioi), and B3. So the "mortal man" in question has been shown to be Pausanias by Wilamowitz, followed by Zuntz and Solmsen.21 This should suffice to rule out any possibility for B131 to be assigned to the llepi cpÚGEOx;. Besides, scholars have repeatedly pointed to the strong hymnic character of fr. B131.22 But, in my opinion, the main reason for thinking that this fragment does not come from the Physical Poem is the sheer incompatibi lity of the theology and the epistemology proposed by B131 and B132.133.134 with those expounded in the Ilepl (púaecoq. Indeed, the Physical Poem indicates the Sphairos and the elements as gods. And it also proposes a very cautious epistemology: B2.1-8 insists on the weak ness of human senses and on the exiguity of each man's experience; B2.8-9 and B3 mention the limits imposed on human research by Piety, and then underline the need for using all senses (without relying on any of them too much) and the reason. On the other hand, B131, 132, 133 and 134 introduce a very different theo logy and a very different attitude towards knowledge. At B131.4 Empedocles announces that he has a "good discourse" concerning the blessed gods in store for us (ci^cpl 0ecl)v |ia.Kápci&gt;v àyaOôv Xóyov): in this case, we do not hear of any limits or doubts concerning knowledge, not even with regard to the gods! The Acragantine is evidently reacting against Xenophanes' well-known caution in 21B34.23 And, by the way, nowhere in the Ilept cpúaecüc; are the element-gods called |iáKapec; as they are here. 19.

And also B133 and B134 are greatly at variance with the Physical Poem. According to B133, to 0elov is not to be percei ved by sense: sense is the main means of perception ("the greatest way to persua sion", says Empedocles), but not according to the doctrine illustrated in these four fragments. And B134 both resumes Xenophanes' polemic against anthropomor phism (2IB 11.12.14.15.16) and describes a sort of immaterial divinity, a &lt;ppr]v iepr|, which also seems to echo Xenophanes' (21B23.24) and Heraclitus' (22B64) views.24 Some have insisted on such immateriality,25 although this interpretation has not been unanimously accepted. Of course, the immateriality of the Holy Mind marks another striking difference from the ITepi cpúaeux;. All these reasons induce me to doubt Tzetzes' witness, when he quotes B 134.4-5 as coming from the third book of the Physical Poem.26 Then might not the four fragments come from the Purifications, after all? Some think that B131.132.133.134 should be assigned to this poem, which was once too simply regarded as the summa of Empedocles' religious thought. But let me consider the two main features of the Ka0ap|ioi — i.e. the impressive tale of the daimon's journey (B115.117.118.119.120.125.126.127.139.146.147) and the rich gallery of allegorical figures introduced by B121.122.123. The journey starts with the fall of a god into the condition of a daimon, and goes on with his embodying himself in several "mortal things" and then getting back to the divine status: so, it concerns the ever-changing relationship between divinity, mankind and the world. The allegorical figures partially resemble those described by Homer and Vergil. It is easy to see the deep difference between these features and the philo sophical theology of the four frgs. B131-134. Such theology describes a divinity pervading the kosmos with its thoughts, and rejects anthropomorphism, which is, instead, implicitly endorsed by the personifications introduced in the Ka0ap|ioi. Then, where should frgs. B131-134 belong? Are the Physical Poem and the Purifications really the only works by Empedocles of which fragments are - 24. The comparison with 22B64 is introduced by West (1971) 142-144. 25. Solmsen (1980) 223 points out that the «modes of action» of the Holy Mind are «decidedly non-physical»; Alt (1987) 396 f. defines it «ein nicht-elementares Sein», and aptly recalls the Anaxagorean distinction between the Nous and the «All-Mischung». Contra Darcus (1977) 182 ff., Wright (1981) 254 and Frère (2007) 8 f„ who connect the Holy Mind with the Sphairos and the kosmos-, Wright's position is approved of by Palmer (2009) 327 n5. Drozdek (2007) 77 thinks anyway that, «although requiring a material substrate, the Phren should not be identified with it», as the Phren cannot be perceived by sense. 26. Tzetzes' reliability is not rated very high. Diels (1898) 396.400-403 harshly blames him for his Leichtfertigkeit, and does not believe that a third book of the nepi cpúaeiot; ever existed. Although a complete copy of Empedocles may have been available in Byzantium in the xii c. — see Primavesi (2002) — Tzetzes himself admits (ad B50) that he is not sure what author such fragment comes from, which shows that he hardly had access to such copy. Besides, division in books was apparently introduced by hellenistic philologists (Solmsen [1980] 219 f.); lastly, if a third book of the Physical Poem ever existed, it might have been formed with the remnants of the Hymn to Apollo.</page><page sequence="9">0eôç Aaíjuov, Oprjv 'Isprj: Empedocles and the Divine 309 extant? As a matter of fact, traces of a work, the Passage of Xerxes, which — together with the Hymn to Apollo — was declared by Aristóteles {de poetis, fr. 17 Gigon=D. L. 8.57) to have been lost already in the fifth century, were perceived by Sider in a reading too readily dismissed by most scholars; and a well-known fragment, Bill, was (rightly, in my opinion) assigned to the Medical Discourse by Karsten, Mullach, Cent27 Striking thematic affinities and the peculiar epistemological views mentioned above make me sure that the four frgs. B131-134 are strongly linked with each other. And, although it is impossible to reach complete certainty in such matters, the cases of the Passage of Xerxes and of the Medical Discourse encourage me to regard it as possible that relics of a lost work, the Hymn to Apollo, might be recognized in such fragments.28 In fact, the main source of B134, Ammonius, de interpretatione 249, 1 Busse, explains that the fragment concerns Apollo, "on whom Empedocles was constantly speaking". Here is my translation of this fragment : (This divinity) is not provided with a masculine head on its limbs Nor do two branches spring from its back, Nor are there feet or swift knees or woolly genitals, but it is only a holy, unutterable mind, which runs through the world with its quick thoughts. The description of this 'antianthropomorphic' divinity corresponds (at least, up to a certain degree) with the character of the i)|ivoc; mentioned by the rhetor Menander (A23) on "what the nature of Apollo is". First of all, B134 might well come from a hymn owing to its sollemn rythm and its structure, marked by the several negative particles at the beginning of each of the first three lines (and I have just mentioned that B131, which is connected with B134, has a hymnic character). Secondly, the nature of this Apollo is incisively described not only as antianthropomorphic but also as asexual: he has no masculine head and no masculine genitals — which, again, marks a great difference both with the ITepi cpúoecoc; and the Ka0ap|aoi.29 Empedocles' &lt;Dpr|v iepr| was a tentative solution given to the problem of the relationship between god and nature — a question which engaged all presocratic thinkers — but probably a solution offered in a work different from the Physical Poem and the Purifications. 27.

FINAL REMARKS In the physical world everything is subject to necessity. Besides, as the two powers and the four elements are divine, the Sphairos is divine. From the point of view or religion, instead, the divine condition is a point of arrival, not a starting point, as I have shown. Otherwise, it would make no sense for Empedocles to propose a way of life instead of another to his disciples. Man is to become a god (maybe forever: cp. B 147.2 cnreipEu;), if he successfully completes a process of purification. In the same way, before man's history began, the conditional clause expressing the daimon's fault (B115.3 euxé tic; kt\., "in case that one daimon etc.") implies the acknowledgement that ethics or religion contemplate a freedom denied to the physical world: not all the gods belonging to the community of the Blessed betray mutual love and commit violence and peijury; some choose not to do so, and they remain part of such community. And the fact that the word kùkàoç is to be read in the Ilepl (púoetoc; (B26.12), but not in the Ka0ap|ioi. perhaps points in the same way: we should be wary of imagi ning that purified daimones are necessarily bound to fall again, after reaching again the divine community. Pindar's Second Olympian and his fr. 133 -— to quote a poet and a theologian who was about a generation older than Empedocles — clearly shows that at least some men are freed from the pain and turmoil of becoming incarnate again and again and even reach the Isles of the Blessed.30 Then, the analogy and the difference between physics and ethics (in the same way as the couples Love/Strife, aggregation/disgregation, etc.) offer an example of the duplicity which pervades Empedocles' works — and surely not the least important. That is why mistakes in evaluating the relationship among the fragments — in which it is easier to incur, if one ignores even the possibility of having to cope with relics of works largely different from each other as to inspiration and aim — may hinder understanding. For instance, if the repetition of some lines sug gests a connection between B29 concerning the Sphairos and B131 concerning the Holy Mind, this does not allow us to put the Sphairos and the Holy Mind on the same plan.31 The Sphairos is produced (and destroyed) by necessity, that is by the alternate action of Love and Strife, while the Holy Mind is (in my opi nion) necessity itself regulating the world, all the more so if its cppovtíÓec; are to be understood as the two powers, Love and Strife.32 Besides, the Sphairos is 30.

In other words, the effort made in these last decades in order to understand Empedocles' works as a whole — an effort which is praiseworthy in se — entails some risk of going astray.
