<plain_text><page sequence="1">HEAVEN OUR HOME: CONSOLATION LITERATURE IN THE NORTHERN UNITED STATES, 1830- 1880 ANN DOUGLAS Department of English Columbia University LYDIA HUNTLEY SIGOURNEY, THE ONCE FAMOUS "SWEET SINGER OF Hartford," in one of her more striking obituary poems, "Twas But a Babe," rhetorically upbraided an unspecified urban male passerby, apparently absorbed in his commercial profit mongering and indifferent to a sad funeral procession wending its way behind a little coffin to the local grave- yard. "Poise Ye, in the rigid scales/ Of calculation, the fond bosom's wealth?" she inquired bitterly. Sigourney's implicit point is that the private rituals of mourning should outweigh the public demands of business, that the claims of home and church should count for more than the imperatives of the marketplace. Her indignant tone suggests, however, her awareness that, in plain fact, most middle-class competitive American men did not share her priorities. Yet Mrs. Sigourney was hardly alone in her persistent effort to focus the attention of her society on its minors and its outsiders, the innocent children, pure maidens, holy women and sanctified men whose deaths could be seen as exemplars and warnings to a culture which in key ways ignored them.' Openly fictionalized and avowedly factual accounts of deathbed scenes and celestial communications crowded the bookstalls in the decades before and after the Civil War. This consolation literature, an important phenomenon in 19th century American culture,2 incessantly 'Mrs. Sigourney's poem has been reprinted in Gail Parker's anthology The Oven Birds: American Women on Womanhood 1820-1920 (New York: Doubleday, 197 2), pp. 59, 60. 21 am defining "consolation literature" to include not simply actual mourners' manuals, but also prayer manuals, poetry, hymns, fiction and biographies whose purpose is clearly consola- tory; whose authors, in other words, are writing to reach and comfort those suffering bereave- ment or loss.

The causes of this literary, and in some part actual, magnification of mourning in America between 1830 and 1880 are complex and elusive. The historian's first instinct is to turn to demography and to consider the possi- bility of an unusually high death rate in this period. There was of course the Civil War which took a million lives as its toll: massive, even national need for consolation and curiosity about the destination of the departed seem inevitable. Elizabeth Stuart Phelps claimed that she wrote her best-selling novel, The Gates Ajar (1868), a fictionalized mourning manual, touched by the grief of the thousands who had lost beloved sons and husbands in the war.3 Yet the shock imparted by the Civil War merely dramatized and ac- celerated a trend already well under way. Phelps' own father had felt for years that only his "conception of heaven as a place . . . not unlike this world," an idea key to the appeal of Gates Ajar, made living tolerable to him.4 Furthermore, writers both in England and America had anticipated Elizabeth Phelps' preoccupation with death and the afterlife;5 and Gates Ajar was even more successful in England, which had had no Civil War, than in America. Again, many cultural historians have assumed or implied that 19th century American children died of more or less natural causes in staggering numbers. In this view, the copious consolation literature, so largely con- cerned with deceased children, was a sentimental but viable way to cope with a widespread and valid sense of loss and deprivation. Recently, however, scholars have begun to speculate that the mortality rate of the pe- riod was not so high as once supposed.6 Although final results are not in, it is at least uncertain that the death rate for infants had increased from the 18th to the 19th century in the northern United States; it may well have decreased. The outpouring of mourners' manuals needs further expla- nation. The answer may well lie in contemporary perceptions or mispercep- tions of demographic data, perceptions shaped by economic and social fac- in the course of this article. Let me state here my awareness of the limitations of trying to get at a cultural phenomenon through its literary expression: of course the expression becomes conventionalized, even formulaic, and begins to conform to readers' literary expectations rather than to their fluctuating "real-life" needs. 3Chapters From A Life (Boston, 1897), p. 97. 4Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, Austin Phelps: A Memoir(New York: Scribner, 1891), p. 18. 5The most interesting and popular English examples are by William Branks, Heaven Our Home (Boston, 1864) and Life in Heaven (Boston, 1865).

Northern middle-class families by mid-century were beginning to "plan" their families; women hoped to have three or four children, rather than keep three or four. In a period of increasing prosperity and incipient scientific investigation, expectations were perhaps raised beyond the level of available medical competence. The historian can approach the problem from a different and non-demo- graphic angle, however. For it is clear that, whatever the actual facts or readings of them may have been, certain groups were particularly active in promoting funerary ritual and literature in the North between 1830 and 1880. Liberal clergymen and devout women were the principal authors of the mourners' manuals, lachrymose verse, obituary fiction and necrophiliac biographies popular at the time, and the characteristic features of such works make the clearest sense when placed in a context of clerical and feminine anxieties and ambitions. It has long been accepted that, during the course of the 19th century, ministers in the more traditional denominations in the Northern states were struggling with limited success against their diminishing status and weakening authority.7 In the opinion of many historians, clergymen com- pelled by disestablishment to turn from a state-supported to a voluntary system magnified and capitalized on the tactics of moral suasion which were their logical means of survival and self-promotion. In this reading, the so- called "Protestant crusades" of the period, for example, were the out- growth of a clerical and conservative alliance to redefine and regain power. Relatively little attention has been paid, however, to the more covert as- pects of the liberal ministry's attempt to exploit the inevitable weakness of its position as a new kind of strength. One can interpret the well recognized softening of Protestant theology especially among Unitarians and Con- gregationalists at this time as in part a reflection and a rationalization of the less authoritative and less commanding role its clerical formulators were forced to assume among their contemporaries. On a broader front, the non- evangelical sects promoted, if not altogether consciously, the senti- mentalization of Northern culture as a way to make the "Christian" val- ues-passivity, meekness, gentleness, reverence for the past and for the weak-consigned to them by a busily industrializing and expanding nation dominant at least in theory and in literature. 'Among Northern Protestant non-evangelical sects, I have focused particularly on the Con- gregationalists and Unitarians: their ministers seem to have been more vulnerable to loss of status than the clergy of the Episcopal or Presbyterian denominations, the other major non- evangelical groups. The Episcopalians had a complex ritual to sustain their identity; the Presbyterians, a powerful and semi-hierarchical system of church organization. The Uni- tarians, and the Congregationalists from whom they derived, had neither, although they were at various times attracted to both. The evangelical sects, most importantly the Baptists and Methodists, of course had the techniques of full-blown revivalism, sometimes allowed but al- ways controversial in the non-evangelical sects, at their disposal.</page><page sequence="4">Heaven Our Home 499 Liberal ministers propagated their changed theology not only in person but, often more effectively, in print. They edited religious and secular pe- riodicals; they published sermons, tracts, poetry, even fiction. There is no better way of measuring the radical shift in the relationship between the minister and his culture in the period from the Great Awakening to the Civil War than to note how many prominent ministers over its course turned to belles lettres as a means of self-expression and communication. At the turn of the 19th century, Nathaniel Emmons, a stern follower of the great New Light theologian Samuel Hopkins, returned a novel by Sir Walter Scott lent him by a friend with protestations of genuine horror.8 Yet a scant 50 years later, not simply notorious lightweights like Henry Ward Beecher, but se- date and serious Unitarians like the Ware brothers and more or less or- thodox professors of theology like Austin Phelps and Bela Edwards, were making secular literature a concern and even an occupation. Literature, with its aptness in substituting feeling for dogma,9 was an indispensable tool for a group of men who came increasingly to see their avenue to influence in their ability to soothe rather than to discipline and who perforce wanted to persuade the public that emotional nurture was its greatest need. Part of the problem facing the non-evangelical clergyman settled in the Northeast at mid-century was that his audience was feminine. The mem- bers of his church were more and more likely, in his opinion, to be women. 10 Benevolent organizations concerned with temperance, purity, education, pacifism, missions and other religious causes came to play a bigger and bigger part in parish life; and these were largely supported by feminine in- terest. The very reading public the non-evangelical clergymen wished to reach was principally middle-class, female and by definition attracted to the sentimental fare turned out briskly by successful women writers. To enlist and attain masculine authority, the liberal minister had to assimilate feminine demands and tactics. As a result, he suffered the taint of feminiza- 8It was characteristic of Emmons to boast, "I never thought of any style; I wrote as I thought"; see Edwards A. Park, Memoir of Nathaniel Emmons (Boston, 1861), 1: 296. 9The most important ministerial discussions of this process in the period are Horace Bushnell, "Preliminary Dissertation on the Nature of Language as Related to Thought," from God in Christ (Hartford, Conn., 1849), repr. in Horace Bushnell, ed. H. Shelton Smith (New York: 1965), pp. 69-105; and Edwards A. Park, The Theology of the Intellect and of the Feel- ings (Andover, Mass., 1850). For a discussion of the meaning of Bushnell's theory for contem- porary American literature, see Charles Fiedelson Jr., Symbolism and American Literature (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, c. 1953), pp. 152-56, 311-15. '0There are no reliable figures for sex breakdown of Protestant congregations as yet. My own impression from the few figures I have gathered is that the ratio did not shift dramatically in the 19th century, but that the ministers registered the more active presence of the women. They genuinely believed such a shift in sex proportion had occurred. For a dramatic statement, see Howard Allen Bridgeman, "Have We a Religion for Men?" Andover Review, 13 (1890), 388-96.</page><page sequence="5">500 A merican Quarterly tion,"I but he also learned much from the skillful methods of subversion and exploitation which his more prominent middle-class feminine peers had de- veloped in a complicated attempt to improve without overtly revolu- tionizing their own position. Liberal clergymen and literate women shared several common preoccu- pations. With incipient urbanization and the transfer of many industries from the home to the factory during the first half of the 19th century, mid- dle-class New England women were losing their status as productive units in their economy.'2 Not surprisingly, their most articulate members were in- terested, like the liberal ministers, in exploring the possibilities of "influence," in asserting rather than proving themselves as indispensable to their culture's less material and less apparent needs.'3 Literature was their natural vehicle also. Furthermore, while of course barred from the official ministry, writing women, whether their matter was fiction, tracts, biogra- phies or manuals, were impelled by contemporary opinion toward a re- ligious tone and message as consonant with their special feminine nature.'4 Paradoxically, clerical views of women's role pushed women onto clerical terrain as colleagues and competitors.'5 Both groups used the same setting to display their virtues: ladies and ministers tended to meet in theory if not in practice in the home; both, at least in part, identified themselves in "I base this remark on a study of approximately a hundred ministerial biographies and of the changing terminology used to describe non-evangelical clergymen in William Sprague's monumental compilation of contemporary accounts of American ministers over two and a half centuries, Annals of the American Pulpit, 9 vols. (New York: Carter, 1857-69). Adjectives connotating "feminine" are increasingly used (in praise) of 19th century non-evangelical clergymen. 12For the most perceptive contemporary statement about this process, see Horace Bushnell, "The Age of Homespun," in Litchfield County Centennial Celebration (Hartford, 1851). For more recent studies, see Alice Clark, Working Life of Women in the Seventeenth Century (New York: Harcourt, 1920); Gerda Lerner, "The Lady and the Mill Girl: Changes in the Status of Women in the Age of Jackson," Mid-continent American Studies Journal, 10 (1969), 7, 8; Mary Ryan, "American Society and the Cult of Domesticity, 1830-1860," Diss. University of California at Santa Barbara 1971; and Kathryn Kish Sklar, Catharine Beecher: A Study in American Domesticity (New Haven: Yale Univ.

See also Glenda Gates Riley, "The Subtle Subversion: Changes in the Traditionalist Image of the American Woman," Historian, 32 (1969-70), 210-27. 14For several classic statements of the clerical position, see "The Pastoral Letter" of 1837 provoked by early feminist activity, included in Aileen Kraditor, ed., Up From the Pedestal: Selected Writings in the History of American Feminism (Chicago: Quadrangle, 1968), pp. 50- 52; and Horace Bushnell, Woman's Suffrage: The Reform Against Nature (New York: Scribner, 1869). 15Many ministers expressed their often uneasy awareness that women writers were com- peting successfully with pulpit utterance. See in particular William Ellery Channing's view that "woman, if she may not speak in the church, may speak from the printing room, and her touching expositions of religion . .. sometimes make their way to the heart more surely than the minister's homilies," Works (Boston: J. Munroe, 1843), 2: 280.</page><page sequence="6">Heaven Our Home 501 parental roles. Women were assigned to familial and hearthside duty by popular mythology heavily backed by Christian precept;'6 non-evangelical clergymen were more and more consigned to a pastoral rather than an ec- clesiastical part, to the private rather than the public sphere. It is no ac- cident that a large percentage of the domestic and etiquette manuals poured out in such profusion in the first half of the century came from the hands of ministers. Nor is it accidental that ministerial biography was an art increas- ingly taken over in the same period by women, and by women who con- centrated on the personal lives of their subjects.'7 Neither group had the strength or consequently the inclination to repudiate the domestic arena as unworthy of their talents. Their largely unconscious strategy was to exalt home tasks and values and to depict a nation in crying want of domesti- cation.'8 Officially at least they accepted the home as their world, but they were understandably very concerned to define this world and even the next, as a home. One of the family dramas which ministers and women picked as a fa- vorite was that of death; and here we return to the consolation literature in whose production and shaping both groups were so influential. Tellingly, death in this literature was scaled to almost exclusively domestic propor- tions. Where an earlier author like Jeremy Taylor, who wrote the peren- nially popular Holy Dying (1651), intended his work for the Christian seeking general devotional and doctrinal instruction, the authors of the 19th century American death manuals directed their books toward the actually and recently bereaved parent, husband or wife seeking reassurance. Private, particular grief, in other words, was their declared starting point and raison d'Ptre. Moreover, such writers usually chose to commemorate the lives, last words and funeral rites of women and clergymen like themselves, seldom participators in the competitive world, and of small children who perforce had never left the nest. Finally, their attention was increasingly drawn, and in novel ways, to the world to which the dead gained admission. Unlike pre- vious religious thinkers in America and abroad, they were not concerned ex- clusively or even predominantly with the kind of life a believer must pursue on earth to attain heaven. They focused rather on the accessibility of the ce- "6See Ryan, "American Society and the Cult of Domesticity"; Barbara Welter, "The Cult of True Womanhood 1820-1860," American Quarterly, 18 (1966), 151-74; Ann Douglas Wood, "The 'Scribbling Women' and Fanny Fern: Why Women Wrote," American Quarterly, 23 (1971), 3-24. 17The most interesting of these are The Life and Letters of Horace Bushnell (New York, c. 1880) by his daughter Mary Bushnell Cheney; the Memoir of Charles Follen in his Works (Boston: Munroe, 1842), vol. 1 by his wife Eliza Follen; Life and Character of the Reverend Sylvester Judd (Boston: Crosby, 1854) by his cousin Arethusa Hall; and Austin Phelps: A Memoir (New York, 1891) by his daughter Elizabeth Stuart Phelps. 18See Sklar, Catharine Beecher, passim; Ann Douglas Wood, "The War Within a War: Women Nurses in the Union Army," Civil War History, 18 (1972), 197-212.</page><page sequence="7">502 American Quarterly lestial kingdom to earthly intelligence and the similarities between the two worlds which made communication possible. They depicted and emphasized heaven as a continuation and a glorification of the domestic sphere. The ce- lestial regions and their occupants were to pay, in other words, an intricate compliment to themselves. To suggest that problems of professional class or sexual status played a part in the creation and character of an important literary phenomenon of 19th century America is not, I hope, to suggest a conspiracy view of history in any pejorative sense. The authors of the consolation literature were intent on claiming death as their peculiar property, one conferring on them a spe- cial professional mission and prerogative: necessarily they wished to inflate and complicate its importance. To say this is to imply that they were rightly insecure about their position, that they sought to gain indirect and com- pensatory social control, and even that they and their readers were in part debased by their effort; it is not to imply that they were insincere, ill-inten- tioned or simple-minded. It must be remembered how these people saw themselves, and with what good reason: they were in the main genuine and sincere Christians reinterpreting their faith as best they could in terms of the needs of their culture. Sentimental as much of their output is in modern eyes, it indisputably served a valid function for those who read it as well as for those who produced it. Historians, inevitably finding various groups clearly motivated by forms of self-interest, occasionally tend to act as if they have detected hypocrites or villains, forgetful perhaps that self- interest, like class and status, is as pervasive and as complex as identity it- self. '9 Elizabeth Prentiss, daughter of one minister and married to another, was herself a successful leader of various prayer and Bible classes. A popular re- ligious author, she produced her best-seller in Stepping Heavenward (1869), a classic of 19th century consolation literature. She once gave an interesting and revealing definition of the function of "a pastor's wife": "to feel the right to sympathize with those who mourn, to fly to them at once, and join them in their prayers and tears." She goes on: "It would be pleasant to spend one's whole time among sufferers, and to keep testifying to them what Christ can and will become to them, if they will only let him."20 One can not help suspecting that Christ's was not the only power apparent at such moments. To up-play the psychological and spiritual crisis of a be- "9For a somewhat different viewpoint on this issue, see Henri Lefebvre, Everyday Life in the Modern World, trans.

Furthermore, the mourner was susceptible to feminine and ministerial authority. At least temporarily, he turned his attention from the competitive world where such authority had little force to the spiritual sphere where it was presumably most relevant and trustworthy. The ordeal of the Christian survivor forced to realize that he has "idolized" a loved one taken from him by a chastening God was a tradi- tional one in New England religious writing. The 17th and 18th centuries, however, had no real cult of mourning literature. The griever was seen as culpable, if human. His condition was hardly considered one of particular fascination in the same way, for example, that the state of a sinner on the eve of "conviction" might be. Thomas Shepard, a prominent 17th century divine, devoted only an eloquent page and a half to the loss of his adored wife, and he concluded his account with a characteristic stroke of partial self-condemnation: "Thus god hath visited &amp; scourged me for my sins &amp; sought to weene me from this woorld, but I have ever found it a difficult thing to profit even but a little by the sorest &amp; sharpest afflictions."12' In sharp contrast, the bereaved 19th century authors of tributes like The Empty Crib: The Memorial of Little Georgie (1873) and Agnes and the Key of Her Little Coffin (1837), frankly assumed, and apparently got, the engrossed attention of significant portions of their society in their emotional and moral welfare. The Reverend Theodore Cuyler, the prominent New York clergyman who wrote The Empty Crib, received thousands of more than sympathetic letters from kindred mourners. Cuyler added some of these epistles in later editions of The Empty Crib. I will quote from one to give the flavor of all: My dear Sir,-If it ever falls in your way to visit Allegheny Cemetery, you will see there "a flower" on three "little graves." "Anna, aged 7 yrs; Sadie, aged 5 yrs; Lillie, aged 3 yrs;" all died within six days, and all of scarlet fever! ["Georgie" died of scarlet fever also.] It sometimes may reconcile us to our own affliction to hear of one still greater elsewhere; and this is the reason why I, a perfect stranger, venture to trespass upon you in your sore bereavement, and to tell you of my heartfelt sympathy.22 The Reverend Nehemiah Adams, a New England minister, wrote a fascinat- ingly unabashed account of the protracted and all-absorbing grief he and his 21Perry Miller and Thomas H. Johnson, eds., The Puritans (New York: Harper &amp; Row, c. 1963), 2: 475. 22Cuyler, The Empty Crib (New York, 1873), pp. 81-82. Cuyler produced two other very popular mourning manuals, Beulah Land: or Words of Cheer for Christian Pilgrims (New York, c. 1896), and God's Light on Dark Clouds (New York, c. 1882).</page><page sequence="9">504 American Quarterly wife experienced over the death of their daughter, Agnes. By Adams' confession, the couple spent large portions of time at Agnes' grave and with other similarly afflicted parents talking about the merits of the departed and the possibilities of heavenly reunions. There is no escaping the sense that grief is not being used here as dis- cipline, in the way Shepard used it, but as therapeutic self-indulgence. Mourning is still intended clearly to foster spiritual development, but a cu- rious kind of exhibitionism seems to be doing the work formerly expected of the rituals of self-scrutiny. Here as everywhere in the consolation literature we find a slight but crucial transformation of that essential Christian pre- cept, "the last shall be first." The losers shall be the winners, if not of the world's goods and positions, at least of its concern. The mourner figure even if neither a minister or a mother is, through the experience of powerlessness grieving entails, a possible stand-in for them. As such, the attention he is so lavishly granted by his authors compensates him for more losses perhaps than he has consciously suffered. This is not to imply that the deceased always take second place to their survivors in these annals of grief. Indeed, it is usually the dying or dead child who is the most conspicuous exemplar of the new turn to the old prophecy, "the last shall be first." "Agnes" and "Georgie" were supposedly guides to their adult supervisors in ways that must have been both suggestive and flat- tering to their maternal and ministerial biographers, many of whom knew well what it was like to be treated, even to function, as children in a world of unheeding adults. Furthermore, these small saints usually chose their mother or their minister as their model. Little James, an early deceased son of the Universalist minister Sylvester Cobb, was memorialized by his mother Eunice Hale Cobb in 1852. According to her account, he was a clergyman in embryo. As a very young child, he disliked "to mingle with the boys [at school], so as to hear their profane and vulgar language." He advised "respect of the aged" and once rebuked a man who referred to his father as "the old gentleman." He loved the Bible, took communion at age seven, and was wont to argue with fellow passengers on boats and trains against the use of tobacco. But if he emulated his ministerial father, he adored his mother. During his last sickness, he expressed his wish to her that "we could die with our arms around each other's neck."23 Only she, he implied, was worthy to approach the confines of the heavenly kingdom with him. The dying infant was made supremely to flatter his feminine and clerical biographers: he shared their weakness while he dignified and ex- tended their authority. The death scene had too much crucial psychological and sociological 23Memoir of James Arthur Cobb (Boston, 1852), pp. 24, 30, 111.</page><page sequence="10">Heaven Our Home 505 potential for the minister and his feminine counterpart to be left to children, however, even to children who operated in a sense as their proxies. Many of the "memorials" of the day devoted to the lives of pious women and clergymen were consolation literature in very thin disguise. They revealed as much of the art of the mortician or the gravestone cutter as the craft of the biographer. From their opening pages, the reader is repeatedly reminded that their subjects are going to die, perhaps young, and certainly well. No example is more striking than the biography of the Reverend William Peabody written shortly after his death in 1849 by his brother Oliver. Peabody was a fervent Christian, an opponent of "controversial di- vinity,"24 a defender of the Sabbath and a pioneer in the cemetery and Sabbath School movements. A literary man of real if minor talent who contributed to the Christian Examiner, the North American Review and The Token, he published rather gentle pieces on autumn and death. His best poem began with characteristic melancholy: "Behold the western evening light!/ It melts in deepening gloom;/ So calmly Christians sink away/ Descending to the tomb."25 He was a clear candidate for a special senti- mentalized kind of martyrdom, and his biography is an exercise in necro- philia. From the start, his brother depicts him as one too good to live, the kind of pale, serious, sickly, pious little child that wise old women were al- ways clucking prophetically over in the domestic novels of the day. He survived to marry an extremely devout woman whose resolve to give "all the powers of . .. [her] soul to a private intercourse with God" had an im- mense impact on her husband. When she died at an early age in 1843, he told himself that she had been called first so that he might learn through sorrow to be more worthy of her. Cherishing his grief, he liked to sit by moonlight near her grave. His links with this life were further attenuated when his eldest daughter died suddenly only four months after his wife. At this point in the Peabody biography an extraordinary thing happens. A new and anonymous writer explains, "the pen fell from the hands" of Oliver Peabody just, symbolically, as he approached his brother's moving deathbed scene. Oliver, a consumptive, originally a lawyer but unsuited to enforced contact with a quarreling and litigious world, became a minister in his last few years. He apparently felt in writing his brother's story "as if he were carving the letters on his own gravestone." The second biographer sur- vives his task, describes William's saintly and gentle death and includes a memoir of Oliver for good measure. The special quality of a biography like this is in the rather sepulchral 24Sermons by the Late William B. 0. Peabody with a Memoir by His Brother (Boston, 1849), p. xxv. 25Rufus Wilmot Griswold, ed., The Poets and Poetry of A merica (New York: Miller, 1872), p. 266.</page><page sequence="11">506 American Quarterly sense it gives the reader that she is listening to a posthumous voice. During William Peabody's last months, he seemed to his loving congregation to be increasingly "standing on the confines of the eternal world, as one ready to be offered; permitted just before entering its gate to point out to those he loved, with the failing accents of a dying voice, the way to reach its blessedness."26 Death is anticipated and lingered over precisely because it lends significance, even authority, to its victim. Once again, the "last" is "first"; paradoxically, the dead live. Young women were especially popular subjects, both in biography and fiction, for the necrophiliac drama.27 Mary Clemmer Ames' account of the poetical Cary sisters, Phoebe and Alice, or George Prentiss' tribute to his wife Elizabeth, are as thoroughly morbid by modern standards as the Peabody memorial. And one remembers little Eva's doomed fragility and her generous deathbed disposal of locks of hair in Mrs. Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. Mrs. Sigourney of Hartford, however, was the undisputed mistress of feminine mourning literature. Any corpse was fair game for her verse; she ranged so far afield as to commemorate the long-deceased Venerable Bede; she came so close to home as to fantasize her own demise. In fascinating ways, she played daringly on the enticing boundaries between life and death where the Peabody brothers apparently lingered. Mrs. Sigourney's last recorded words were the benignly all-inclusive ones, "I love everybody." This is surely a commonplace if over effusive deathbed platitude, but one feels a little shiver when one remembers that a few decades before, Mrs. Sigourney had published a sentimentalized biographical sketch entitled Margaret and Henrietta: Two Lovely Sisters (1832). According to her account, Margaret had died with the same phrase on her lips. Could Mrs. Sigourney have mentally noted the appeal of such a last line, stored it up, and finally reenacted a deathbed scene which she had in part invented?28 Long before she uttered her last words, Mrs. Sigourney was prone to pla- giarize from the dead. Before her marriage in her late twenties she had been a distinguished schoolteacher in Hartford. At the first reunion she held for her former pupils she spoke of, and for, the girls who had already passed away. Moreover, although presumably in her usual plump and ruddy good health, she urged her listeners to go on meeting annually even if "the voice that now addresses you should be silent, the lip that has uttered prayers for your welfare should be sealed in the dust of death." In 1823 she told her 26Sermons, pp. xlvii, xc, lxxiv. 27Striking evidence of this sexual preference is seen in R. C. Waterston's Thoughts on Moral and Spiritual Culture (Boston: Crosby and Nichols, 1842). He opens his book with a descrip- tion of a child being born: it is a boy. He closes with an account of dying children: they are all girls. 28Mrs. L. H. Sigourney, Letter of Life (New York: Appleton, 1867), p. 408.</page><page sequence="12">Heaven Our Home 507 hearers that since they last met, she had been sick "(at least in thought) on the confines of the abode of spirits," and had brought back solemn words of wisdom.29 Mrs. Sigourney had become her own medium. The Fox sisters did not begin their table rappings in upstate New York until 1848, but Mrs. Sigourney had in several senses anticipated them.30 She was straining for the authority conferred on the Peabodys, the power granted by the privilege of extraterrestrial communication. Several of the little saints whose early deaths drew so many sympathetic tears showed ex- trasensory abilities similar to Mrs. Sigourney's. It was not just a matter of the conventional little finger pointing upward, the smile on the once rosy lips, the last gasped "Mother" or "Jesus." A dying child like James Cobb enjoyed extended communications with the spirit world: he watched angels dancing in anticipation of his speedy arrival, saw various deceased members of his own family and relayed their messages back to the living. He was quite literally a medium, and after his death he continued to appear to his relatives. Death, province of minister and mother, instead of marking the end of power, had become its source. Spiritualism in its most generalized and most specific sense, was a manifestation of a complex retransfer of force from the living to the dead, from the apparently strong to the ap- parently weak. It was absolutely essential to this process that the deceased not truly die. The planned and picturesque new "rural cemeteries," promoted and rapturously described by the same groups who produced the consolation literature of the period, were dedicated to the idea that the living, and the dead, still "cared." Paths with pastoral names, gentle rills, green slopes and newly popular graveside flowers31 were all meant to flatter the guaranteed but enduring docility of the deceased. Developing funeral customs reflected the same carefully fostered illusions.32 Elaborate and highly differentiated metal caskets replaced wooden ones in the early 19th century, although many protested their use. The metal casket, unlike its predecessor, insured that neither it nor its contents would disintegrate or return to the earth for a 29"A Record of My School," unpublished MS in Sigourney Collection, Connecticut His- torical Society. 30I am basing my interpretation of Spiritualism on work in progress by R.

The new graveyards were modeled on the ideas of the "pic- turesque" propagated by architect Andrew Jackson Downing.

Nehemiah Adams began his account of Agnes and the Key of Her Little Coffin by explaining that there had been a great improvement in the design of children's coffins. They no longer had "broken lines and angles.... They look like other things, and not like that which looks like nothing else, a coffin." He added maladroitly, "You would be willing to have such a shape for the depositing of any household article." There was apparently a soft lining and a nameplate inside the box, and a "lock and key" had replaced the old "remorseless screws and screw- drivers."34 The sensibility of the consolation literature manifested itself in the new cemeteries in other ways as well. The simple and severe tombstones of 17th century America with their stark reminders of death, a cross or a death's- head or an hourglass, gave way in the late 18th century to new anthropomorphic designs. Actual if crude portraits of the deceased ap- peared, willow trees and allegorical pictures of the resurrection were all in evidence by 1800.35 By the 1840s statues of what one popular graveyard guidebook calls "weeping female figures"36 marked various family plots in Mt. Auburn: Mrs. Sigourney had been immortalized and mass-produced in marble. Euphuistic sepulchral inscriptions like "asleep in Jesus," a favorite for children's graves, poetically stressed the continuing presence of the deceased.37 This was the spirit and the language of the consolation literature. The Reverend Mr. Cuyler, passing an afternoon at New York's Greenwood cemetery near the grave of his son "little Georgie," bid his son a by-no-means-final adieu in a similar mode: "The air was as silent as the un- numbered sleepers around me; and turning toward the sacred spot where my precious dead was lying, I bade him, as of old, 'Goodnight!"' Green- wood was to him "simply a vast and exquisitely beautiful dormitory."38 Cuyler's choice of terminology is important here. It was typical of the authors of consolatory literature to refer to the rural cemeteries, of which Greenwood was one of the most famous, in domestic terms. Their origina- tors and supporters had designed them to fulfill the same kind of sanctuary function the home was traditionally supposed to serve. To begin with, the new rural cemeteries were, in accordance with their name and in contrast to 33Ibid., pp. 196-97. 34Nehemiah D. D.

Furthermore, their quiet atmosphere was guaranteed and policed. Those responsible for the creation of Mt. Auburn in 1831, for example, laid down careful regulations about the plan- ning and use of its grounds: the trustees of the spot had the right to remove "offensive and improper" monuments; no "vehicles" were allowed but those owned by "proprietors" (owners of plots); no one was allowed within the gates on Sundays and holidays except proprietors.39 The "influence" of the rural cemetery was to be pre-industrial, uncrowded, privitized. One commentator on "The Law of Burial and the Sentiment of Death" for the Christian Examiner in 1836 expressed his belief that the new graveyards could foster "the sentiment of retrospection and reverence" and draw their visitors from "the busy competition" and "hurried . . . ambitious spirit" of the day.40 The home, in the words of a popular domestic manual by a Rev. Mr. Phillips, was the "heart's moral oasis"; like the cemetery, it was a "refuge" for the "bereaved and disappointed.'"41 In several very important senses, Cuyler, in saying that little Georgie is but asleep in a "dormitory," is implying that his son, such an exemplar of domestic virtue, has never left home at all. Books on spiritualism and the afterlife with titles like Watching Spirits, Voices from the Silent Land, Angel Whispers and Our Children in Heaven convey the clear impression that death widens rather than limits the minis- terial and maternal sphere of influence. These sainted dead hovering around their old haunts, whether women, ministers or pious children eternally firm in the virtues inculcated by their mothers and their pastors, are so many witnesses, even spies, for the church and the home. There seems some kind of compensation process at work here: declare converts among the deceased if you cannot make them among the living. To bring heaven closer to earth was not only to underscore sacerdotal and domestic authority by creating a kingdom to which ministers and women alone had the keys: it was to endow them at once with legions of invincible allies. No wonder that the creators and purveyors of consolation literature increasingly felt, with William Holcombe, the need of "some great spiritual telescope to bring [the dead] . . . near to us in all their beautiful reality," the need of "a clear, con- sistent, philosophical authorized revelation of the life after death."42 39See The Picturesque Pocket Companion and Visitor's Guide Through Mt.

This was a great pe- riod in American hymnology: countless Americans sang hymns at home and in church, and serious theologians began to rank the importance of hymns with that of sermons, a view which previous religious thinkers would have deemed highly heretical.43 The most popular hymns of the day were written by liberal clergymen and devout women authors; they were essentially consolatory rather than monitory, and their favorite theme was increasingly what Fanny Crosby, the blind poetess, eulogized as the "home beyond the skies."" Prayer manuals, another important part of the contemporary consolation literature, emphasized more and more the availability of the other world to the earnest supplicant. Austin Phelps, who published The Still Hour: or Communion With God in 1860, explained with the curious literalism characteristic of such manuals, "an astronomer does not turn his telescope to the skies with a more reasonable hope of pene- trating those distant heavens than I have of reaching the mind of God by lifting up my heart at the Throne of Grace."45 Phelps' analogy suggests the pseudoscientific spirit of assurance which the writers of consolation literature brought to the subject of heaven. Some- what as we might follow on television the lunar expeditions of our modern astronauts, mid-19th century Americans mourning their dead were en- couraged to follow their journey to heaven in minutest detail; to inquire what they ate for breakfast (if they did), who they met, how they lived. The consolatory books on the afterlife increasingly promised them that such facts were part of available knowledge. Heaven, as they depicted it, was not only similar to home but as readily accessible. In the 1880s, Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, carrying her father's metaphor to its logical extreme, produced two novels, Beyond the Gates and Between the Gates, which set forth the eating habits, occupations, lifestyles, methods of child care and courtship current in heaven. She even described with some care an oration York: Scribner, 1851); Mrs. H. Dwight Williams, Voices from the Silent Land; or Leaves of Consolation for the Afflicted (Boston, 1853). 43For the development of American hymnology and its context, see Louis F.

The only inquiry she could not answer was the natural one "touching the means" by which her deceased narrator, a male physician, was "enabled to give this record to the living earth." That is the only "secret" which, as she says in the last line of Between the Gates, she decides to let "remain such."46 The debate over the afterlife, to which the consolation literature made such an interesting contribution, had a complex history in American and European thought. Medieval Christians had shown an intense interest in the next world, an interest which created a special popular and long-enduring literary genre, the monastic vision. Yet built within this tradition was the notion that heaven itself was finally forbidden to human eyes. During and after the Reformation, Christian thinkers and believers showed an in- creasing preoccupation with the doctrine of the millennium, itself once ruled as heretical by St. Augustine.47 Millennial speculation was particularly in- tense in America: many could not help associating the birth of this new nation with more general and religious possibilities of regeneration. Before the Civil War, American Christians tended to be millenarians, al- though they split into two deeply opposed camps: premillenarians, usually members of the less educated and more evangelical sects, who believed that Christ would himself come to earth suddenly, even unexpectedly, at the start of the millennium to supervise its unfolding; postmillenarians who held that Christ would not appear until the end of the thousand-year period, leaving men to guess and execute his wishes in a more gradual and less dra- matic fashion. The former group habitually, and accurately, accused the latter of an Arminian reliance on mortal powers, and even a glorification of them. Significantly, postmillennial views had won an easy victory in the North by the Civil War, a victory for gradualism so complete that the millennium itself largely ceased, at least in non-evangelical circles, to be an issue at all. Yet the differences between pre- and postmillenarians were not as great as they seemed. Both groups had increasingly confused the millen- nial period with the heavenly afterlife, and in doing so had sacrificed the Augustinian and Puritan stress on the importance of the Last Judgment and the commanding role an autocratic and even alien deity played in it.48 Furthermore, both groups increasingly shared a conviction that this earth, 46Between the Gates (Boston, 1887), p. 223. 47For general discussion of the developing ideas of heaven and the millennium see James P.

Consequently, the millennial debate became part of a larger discussion over the nature of heaven: kingdom or home? American ministers of the 17th and 18th centuries had given relatively little attention to the subject. When they spoke of the next life, it was hardly in terms to attract the carnal heart. Nathaniel Emmons with his usual habit of calling a spade a spade had remarked in one of his grimmer sermons: "The truth is there is nothing which God requires men to do in this life in order to go to heaven that is harder to be done, than to be willing to be in heaven."50 Emmons attributed this aversion to men precisely because he looked upon the next world as the Lord's possession, a landscape foreign to mortal eyes, a scene ineffably emblematic of the divine will. There were men and women to uphold at least a portion of this view in the Northern United States at mid-century, but they were in the clear minority. Especially among non-evangelical groups, the out-and-out supporters of a domestic heaven were dominant: Andrew Peabody, F. W. P. Greenwood, the Wares, Charles Follen, William E. Channing and Austin Phelps, to name just a few, believed that heavenly life satisfied the human heart as presently constituted, that it offered homes restored, families regathered and friends reunited. They would have agreed with Henry Harbaugh, a Lu- theran at Mercersberg Seminary who wrote a series of learned but widely read books on heaven in the late 1840s and early 1850s in the belief that The piety of the times has too little of heaven in it. We venture to say that the reli- gion of the present day is too much the fruit of the impulsive, and not sufficiently of the attractive. . It seeks too much to woo heaven, and yields too little to being wooed by it. . . It lacks the meek, the quiet, the serene, the childlike, and the patriarchal. Its faith lies too much in self-will.5" To establish the key importance of the domestic heaven is to grant final vic- tory to the passive rather than to the aggressive virtues. Although Harbaugh is too close to the orthodox tradition not to stress "the beatific vision" and "Heavenly worship," the main message of his volumes is that 49For examples of premillennial books devoted to this thesis, see Henry F. Hill, The Saint's Inheritance; or the World to Come (New York, 1853); John Lillie, The Perpetuity of the Earth; a Discourse Preached Before the Premillennial Advent Association (New York, 1842); Anna Silliman, The World's Jubilee (New York, 1836). 5"The Works of Nathaniel Emmons, ed.

No one was better aware of this than Elizabeth Stuart Phelps who took heaven as her fictional specialty to the delight of hundreds of thousands of Americans and the scorn of Mark Twain.55 Phelps' best-seller Gates Ajar was published in 1868; two other books on the same subject followed it in the 1880s but she was able to claim, rightly, that her views were still what they had been in 1868 when she was only 24. Phelps was the descendant, not just of Austin Phelps and Moses Stuart, but of ten generations of Congregational ministers and deacons.56 She would have been a minister undoubtedly if such a path had been open to her.57 While her two brothers played at mock-sermons, she turned to literary preaching. Self-consciously plain, reform-minded, over-earnest, nearly an invalid from neuralgia and insomnia, she did not marry until 44, and the world laughed, for her husband Herbert Ward was seventeen years her junior, an aspiring writer clearly more drawn to her literary success than her personal charms. The marriage was not happy. In Gates Ajar, Phelps quotes from a Scottish divine who speculated that "Heaven may be a place for those who failed on earth."58 Phelps was hardly a failure-her books sold well throughout her long life-but she had missed not just love, but fulfillment. Always a sentimental, often a sloppy writer, seldom 52Ibid., pp. 181, 292 ff., 21-22. 530f course the big influence here was Emanuel Swedenborg, Concerning Heaven and Its Wonders and Concerning Hell: From Things Heard and Seen (Boston: Carter, 1844). For an example from consolation literature, see Thomas Baldwin Thayer, Over the River, or, Pleasant Walks Into the Valleys of Shadows and Beyond: A Book of Consolation for the Sick, the Dying, and the Bereaved (Boston, 1862). 54The most interesting is George Wood's Future Life (New York: Derby and Jackson, 1858), which he published to little effect, then, capitalizing on Elizabeth Stuart Phelps' best-selling Gates Ajar, republished as The Gates Wide Open: or Scenes in Another World (Boston, 1869). 55See "Extract from Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven," in The Complete Works of Mark Twain (New York, c. 1922), 8: 223-78. 56See Mary Angela Bennett, Elizabeth Stuart Phelps (Philadelphia: Univ. of Pennsylvania Press, 1939), p. 2.

She came increasingly if comprehensibly to see herself as a vehicle of suffering. In 1889 she wrote in a clear mood of self-revelation of the point when pain ceases in any real sense to be profitable: "there comes a limit ... beyond which the best that Fate could offer could not atone for the worst she has inflicted." Believing that God has chosen to impose on his creatures "the final test of love [:] . . . trust under apparent desertion," Phelps also stressed with a certain bitter animus that he has pledged them all the redress in his power. If earth is an orphanage, heaven surely must be home in every sense of the word.59 No one was more committed to the denial of death as a separate state than Phelps. In 1885 she published an extraordinary volume entitled Songs of the Silent World, filled with poems written by supposedly dead people to their living and grieving relatives assuring them of their continued existence. One such spirit addresses a mourning spouse: I lean above you as before, Faithful, my arms enfold, Oh, could you know that life is numb, Nor think that death is cold! A trusting survivor expresses Phelps' credo in the best poem in the book: There is no vacant chair. The loving meet- A group unbroken-smitten, who knows how? One sitteth silent only, in his usual seat; We gave him once that freedom. Why not now? ... Death is a mood of life. It is no whim By which life's Giver mocks a broken heart. Death is life's reticence. Still audible to Him, The hushed voice, happy, speaketh on, apart.60 Gates Ajar is posited on this hopeful, literal-minded assurance, and it constitutes the apotheosis of the consolation literature of the day. It is self- indulgent, domestic, "feminine." An admirer explained that the book offered "a woman's gentle word-a sweet fireside word'"6' to the grieving. The book appropriately focuses on the implicit conflict among the would-be consolers of Mary, a New England girl in her mid-twenties who has lost her adored brother in the Civil War. On the one hand, there is Dr. Bland, the local Calvinist minister, who preaches of a cold and abstract heaven as "'an eternal state"' where the 59The Struggle for Immortality (Boston, 1889), pp. 55, 61. 60Songs of the Silent World (Boston, 1885), pp. 11, 12, 17. 6'Elizabeth T.

After long talks with her aunt in the local graveyard, Mary is reconciled to the loss of her brother precisely be- cause she realizes that she has not lost him at all: she comes to believe he is always watching her, waiting for her. Winifred teaches her own little girl Faith to talk confidingly to her dead father and to expect that God will give her everything she wants, even her favorite cookies, in heaven. Heaven in Aunt Winifred's view is a consolation prize. It only takes a domestic tragedy to bring Dr. Bland, following the rest of the town, into her camp. When his wife burns to death he craves comfort, and only her creed can sup- ply it. Personal need has become the invincible criterion of truth. It is the confidently detailed information about celestial life which makes this book and its successors such extraordinary documents of American re- ligious and cultural history. Aunt Winifred predicts with assurance that her hair will no longer be grey "in heaven," that heaven will look (at least to her) like Kansas, the state she loves best. Given the depth of her knowledge of the next world, it is hardly surprising that she finds it a more interesting, a more real place than her present habitation. When she learns she is to die of breast cancer, she has no regrets. Yet she, like her author, is hardly weaned from the world in the way John Bunyan's pilgrim Christian finally is. Her egocentricity has been transferred, not conquered. Her will to power has been consecrated, not suppressed. All the logic of Gates Ajar, as of the consolation literature of which it is the culmination, suggests to the reader: you are going to end up, if you are well-behaved and lucky, in a domestic realm of children, women and minis- ters (i.e. angels), so why not begin to believe in them now? Phelps has at her disposal a bid for power which, if ignored, could become a threat of revenge. This is not to condemn her or her followers. It is to realize that they had an immense interest in visualizing the afterlife as one scaled to their domestic and pastoral proportions, as a place where they would dominate rather than be dominated. It is to understand that it was crucial to the rationalization and exploitation of their status that they inflate the significance of death, di- late heavenly time and compress earthly calendars, stake out a property in territory where claims were by definition untestable. In doing so, they of course confused reality with fantasy, they subordinated life to literature: Phelps' account was ludicrously detailed precisely to show it was authentic. By an inevitable instinct, she blew up that anticipated moment whose meaning she could legislate: she was compelled to the celestial close-up. 62Gates Ajar, pp. 48, 49.</page></plain_text>
