As part of an entire issue devoted to topics in Taoist philosophy, this article focuses on the understanding of the Tao as a cosmogonie power in the Daodejing and the Zhuangzi. The Tao is the ground of creation and it gives birth to the myriad beings ; the Tao is eternal, has existed from antiquity to the present, and will never die ; the Tao is anthropomorphic, makes moral judgments, and shows compassion. In all these traits, the Tao is the mother of the universe, not merely a natural force but almost a personal god. The Tao is transcendent. It is more than the sum-total of being and nonbeing ; in fact, in many instances, it is closely associated with nonbeing. The Tao is the uncarved block of potentiality at the beginning of space and time. It is at the root of the continuous cycle of existence, ontologically precedes all-that-is. Altogether, the Tao occupies a position not unlike that of God in the Judaeo/Christian tradition. LIVIA KÃ–HN</page></plain_text>
