<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cover A drum altar from the vicinity of Yaxchilan Nikolai Grube and Camilo Alejandro Luin During a recent visit of the impressive collection of Maya art kept under the custody of the Fundación La Ruta Maya in Guatemala City, the two authors were shown a small drum- shaped stone altar adorned with a circular inscription on its top and a palace scene carved in shallow, but well-preserved relief on the outer sides of the stone (see Front Cover; Fig- ures 1-4 &amp; 8). The object is now registered in the Registro de Bienes Culturales with the number 1.2.1.314. Given the im- portance of this monument, we present photos and drawings as well as a preliminary interpretation. The monument is a solid, cylindrical stone of 27.5 cm height and 47 cm diameter. The flat top of the stone carries a circular band of 29 glyph blocks. The palace scene covers a field of 57 x 21 cm and thus occupies only approximately half of the rear sides of the altar (Figs. 1, 2 and 8). The Hieroglyphic Band We will begin the description of the altar with a discussion of the circular hieroglyphic inscription on its top (Figs. 3 and 4). The hieroglyphic band consists of 29 glyph blocks. Each glyph block is approximately 3.4 cm high and between 3.5 and 4.4 cm wide. The text will be discussed according to the principal semantic units we have identified. The Date (Glyphs 1-2) The inscription begins with a Calendar Round date of 7 Mu- luk 17 Yaxk'in. The placing of the date in the Long Count would be problematic if we did not have the name of Yaxchi- lan's king Shield Jaguar II in Glyph 27 and the statement "5 K'atun lord" in Glyphs 23-24. This means that the date must be after Shield Jaguar II had reached this particular state of age. Although we do not precisely know Shield Jaguar II's age at his death in 9.15.10.17.14 6 Ix 12 Yaxk'in (June 15, 742), it is biologically very unlikely that he had achieved this Fig. 1. Left-Side view of the drum altar (Photo courtesy of Fundación La Ruta Maya ) mexicon • Vol. XXXVI • April 2014 40</page><page sequence="2">status long before (Martin and Grube 2008: 123). The best fit for the Calendar Round 7 Muluk 17 Yaxk'in therefore is 9.16.13.5.9 (June 14, 764). A later placement would make the date later than the last known inscriptions from Yaxchilan, which is highly unlikely. At the same time, the date places the dedication of the drum altar during the reign of Bird Jaguar IV, who, however, is not mentioned anywhere in the text. A potentially important aspect of the date is that it falls one day short of 22 tropical years after Shield Jaguar's death. It is very possible that the altar was carved for this reason, and that it served as a memorial monument in which a local noble commemorates his or her relationship to the illustrious lord and patron. The object dedication (Glyphs 3-5) The next three glyphs describe the dedication of the ob- ject. The first glyph is a variant of the so called "flat hand verb". Except for the unusual superfix, the elements of this hieroglyph can be read as i-?-K'AL-ja. While the k' al verb root usually is translated as "bind, tie", in dedication contexts the verb k' al may as well have a different meaning, probably related to Chontal k' al "presentar".1 A lose translation would be "and then it is presented". The superfix above the hand sign cannot be easily identified. It might be a version of the "mirror" sign T24, which usually forms part of the K' AL logogram. The next glyph block is the yu-xu-lu, y-uxul "the carving of' expression, a reference to the carved design on the monu- ment. The medium being adorned with the carving is referred to in the following two glyph blocks, which read u-yu-?-? -li. The superfix most likely is an incomplete yu syllable which lacks the left "hook" or "string" element. The reading of the main sign of Glyph 5 is more problematic. It could be the rab- bit head (T759), which represents the consonant p in Landa's alphabet, and for which there is good evidence as a syllable pe. However, it is lacking the "Etznab" element in the ears as well as the typical rabbit hairs, and therefore might as well represent another syllable. The first sign of the following glyph resembles a female head. Here, it seems to be another syllabic sign of unknown reading forming part of the word root naming the drum altar. That hieroglyphs 5 and 6 spell the word for the monument is very likely because th q y-uxul "the carving of' hieroglyph almost always precedes the general name of the artifact to which the carving is attached. Struc- turally, the u- prefix and the -li suffix at the end suggest that this is a possessed noun. The word root therefore should have the form yuC or yuCVC. Ideally, we now should be able to find a word for drum altar in one of the lowland Mayan languages, but a quick scan through pertinent dictionaries did not provide any clue. In any case, a rather free translation of Fig. 2. Right-side view of the drum altar (Photograph by Nikolai Grube) 41 mexicon • Vol. XXXVI • April 2014</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 3. Top view of the drum altar (3D-model generated by Carlos Pallán Gayol, based on photographs by Nikolai Grube) the first three glyphs after the date could be "it was executed/ finished the carving on the drum altar of . . The architectural context (Glyphs 7-8) The following two glyph blocks are more problematic in re- gard to their interpretation. Hieroglyph 8 shows the outline of a stepped structure with a skull in its interior. This is the logogram MUKNAL "burial place". It has a Xok-fish vari- ant of the u sign indicating possession and the syllable li as a suffix, which also form part of the possessive construction. The small sign under the Xok-fish u at first glance looks like a yi syllable. However, this would make little sense in this context. A better explanation would see this sign as a mu syllable, functioning here as a phonetic complement for the following MUKNAL logogram. Signs other than those for vowels, semivowels and kV/chV syllables, however, do not 42 appear as preposed phonetic complements other than during the Terminal Classic period, when many spelling conventions became obsolete (Grube 2010). Much more problematic is the preceding glyph block. It is composed of three signs of which only the first one, the personified version of the syllable ya can be read. The main sign consists of an anthropomorphic head with a V-shaped stepped design in its interior. The sign, which is identified as T 1078 in Thompson's catalogue (Thompson 1962) and as PE3 in Macri and Looper (2003) appears as part of the name of the dancing death god holding a child in his hands on a Codex Style vase (Kerr 2213, Fig. 6c). There are other occurrences of this sign with a prefixed ya syllable (Tikal Stela 10, Copan Stela J), suggesting that the stepped head sign is either a logogram representing a word yaC or that the ya sign spells the possessive pronoun y- in front of a logo- gram beginning with the vowel a. In regard to the semantic meaning, the occurrences of the stepped head sign with flint knife logograms on Copan Stela J and on a shell found in mexicon • Vol. XXXVI • April 2014</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 4. The dedicatory text on top of the drum altar (Drawing by Nikolai Grube) Piedras Negras imply that there might be a connection with a particular class of a material objects. The use of the sign after the compound sak-jal "white-becoming" on Kerr 22 1 3 leaves no doubt that the sign in question must be a noun. On the altar, the entire glyph connects the glyph for "drum altar" with the glyph for "burial place", so that the Stepped Head glyph seems to be a particular feature of this burial. The possessor of the burial place (Glyphs 9-14) The following six hieroglyphs provide names and titles of the possessor of the burial place, most probably the indi- vidual for which the burial was built that was associated in some way with the drum altar. For some unknown rea- son, this individual is never named explicitly and identified only through a series of titles, which begin in Glyph 9 with the ch'a-ho-ma ch 'aho 'm "young man" title, preceding the hieroglyph u-cha?-CHAN u chan "he is the possessor of', which is also known as the "captor of' expression. Through the use of this expression first identified by Tatiana Prosk- ouriakoff (1963: 1 52ff), rulers would include the name of their captive in their own extended name phrase. The glyph usually consists of two parts, the first probably reads u chan , and can be translated as 'the guardian of'. The second glyph is the name of the captive, which is given here as K'AN-na ki-ta-ma, k' an kitam in Glyph 11 . K' an kitam translates as "yellow peccary" in Yucatecan languages. In Cholan and all other lowland languages the word for peccary has become chitam (Kaufman 2003). This implies that the scribes who wrote the text on this altar were either using a very archaic form more closely connected to Proto-Mayan *kitam , or that they wanted to represent a specifically Yucatecan name. The second part of the captive's name appears in Glyph 12. We see here a cluster of four or five signs, of which only the two signs in the upper right corner can be read as the word ch'o- ko, ch 'ok "young boy". The possessor of the burial carries another "captor" title in Glyphs 1 3 and 14, which provide the 43 mexicon • Vol. XXXVI • April 2014</page><page sequence="5">laconic statement u-CHAN a-AJAW-wa, u chan aj aw, "he is the captor of the king", without providing any further clues in regard to the identity of the captive. The parentage statement (Glyphs 15-17) The possessor of the burial place is linked to the name of his mother in the following glyphs by means of an unusual parentage expression. The first part of the expression is the well-known u-B'AH-hi u-JUN-TAN-na u b 'aah u juntahn "he himself is the beloved one of' formula, which has been identified as a metaphor for "child of mother" (Stuart 1 997). In all cases known, it precedes the name of the mother. Here, however, it stands before the ya-"Bat"-na hieroglyph. The collocation ya-"Bat"-na has long been identified as an ex- pression for "mother of child". Peter Mathews was the first who noted that in texts from Bonampak, the usual reading order son - mother was inverted to mother - son, and that in such a case a hieroglyph with a bat head as its main sign would replace the more common "child of mother" state- ments (Mathews 1980: 64, see also Krochock 1988: 67-70). The bat main sign in this relationship glyph is framed by the syllabic sign y a as a prefix and the suffix na. The reading of the bat head main sign is problematic; several attempts have been undertaken by scholars in the past to apply the syllabic values xu and tz'i, which have been proposed for the bat main sign, to this hieroglyph. All of these attempts have not been able to explain the reading and derivation of this hieroglyph. More recent research concerning the decipherment of the bat sign has made clear that there are several bat signs in Maya writing which differ only in very little detail, and which have not been distinguished in previous glyph catalogues. The bat in the ya-"BAT"-na collocation usually lacks a lower jaw, or the lower jaw is replaced by a pair of volutes which probably represent streams of blood. It seems, however, that Maya scribes not always marked this distinction. The earlier examples of this glyph from the Southern Lowlands leave no doubt, however, that this bat head was neither tz'i nor xu but an entirely different sign. Given the limited distribution and the occasional absence of the na suffix, the sign most probably was a logographic sign. Good suggestions for the reading of this bat head include the term ANAT based on the Lowland and Western Mayan etymon *anat , (Kaufman 2003: Fig. 8. The palace scene carved on the side of of the drum altar (Rollout generated by Carlos Pallán Gayol, based on photographs by Nikolai Grube) 44 mexicon • Vol. XXXVI • April 2014</page><page sequence="6">83) or its Tzeltalan form ANTZ, both meaning "spouse, old woman".2 There is no question, though, that this word was used as a term for "mother" in the Lowland inscriptions, pos- sibly because being an old woman implied being a mother. Read in context, the entire phrase can be loosely para- phrased "... is the beloved [son of] the mother of . . .". In this case, the "mother of' hieroglyph does not follow a female's name. It seems that the identity of the mother was less im- portant than the fact that she was the mother of the possessor of the burial. The children's names (Glyphs 17-29) Another interesting feature of the parentage expression is the fact that the mother of child-expression is followed by a sequence of at least three names, all introduced by the prep- osition ti (Glyphs 18, 21 and 23). In Glyph blocks 19 and 20 we find two glyphs with an initial tu sign, which might also be related, since tu is a contraction of the preposition ti and the ergative pronoun u. So, all in all there might be five prepositional compounds after the mother of child glyphs. In regard to their syntax, they occupy the space where we would expect the name of the son in all other occurrences of the mother of child glyph. We take this as evidence that the prepositional compounds are names, perhaps the names of three or five different children of the mother. Eventually, the female head present in Glyph 18 belongs to the name of a daughter of the mother. The interpretation of the prep- ositional glyphs as a sequence of names finds support in the fact that the standard name and title sequence of Shield Jaguar II is also introduced by a ti preposition in Glyph 23: ti-HO ' - wi- WINIK-H AB ' a-AJAW-wa u-cha-CHAN AJ-?- ki ?-ITZAMNAJ?-B'ALAM K'UHUL-PA'CHAN-AJAW- wa b'a-ka-b'a, ti ho ' winikhaab ' ajaw u cha' an aj ?kltzam- naaj? B'ahlam k'uhul pa' chan ajaw b'akab' "of the five K'atun lord, captor of 'Aj Nik',3 Shield Jaguar, divine lord of Yaxchilan, first of the world". The Aj Nik title is the most common epithet of Shield Jaguar II and therefore leaves no doubt that this particular Shield Jaguar was meant and not one of his earlier predecessors or his later successor, Shield Jaguar III. An interesting feature of Shield Jaguar's name is the superfix, a sign of unknown meaning which appears no- where else attached to his name glyph. Fig. 8 (continued). Rollout- view of the palace scene carved on the side of of the drum altar (Rollout generated by Carlos Pallan Gayol, based on photographs by Nikolai Grube) 45 mexicon • Vol. XXXVI • April 2014</page><page sequence="7">Structurally, the preceding hieroglyphs with a preposition attached therefore should also be names. All of these names must be in the same relationship to the mother, which im- plies that the text talks about brothers and possibly a sister of Shield Jaguar, family members never mentioned in other contexts anywhere else in the corpus of Yaxchilan. One of the brothers is the individual "captor of K' an Kitam", who receives special attention as the owner of the burial place. Interpretation of the rim text Only a single event is mentioned in the text, the dedication of the carving of the drum altar. This drum altar had some particular function associated with the tomb of the captor of K' an Kitam, who was the son of the same mother who had also given birth to Shield Jaguar II of Yaxchilan. The mother remains anonymous in the text. Her importance stems from the fact that she was the mother of a series of children, the most important undoubtedly being Shield Jaguar II. The drum altar, therefore, seems to have been a monument dedicated to the death or a burial shrine of a brother of Shield Jaguar II. The palace scene on the side of the altar Approximately half of the side of this small altar is adorned with a remarkably well-preserved palace scene. There are five individuals represented in this scene, which we will number from left to right with the numbers 1 to 5 (see Figs. 5 &amp; 8). Figure 1 represents an adult male individual looking right towards the central part of the scene. The figure wears an elaborate feather address and a Chaak mask. The shoulders are covered with a cape which probably was made of strips of cloth or bark paper. On the back, the figure carries a skull, which seems to be tied to the body by means of a belt, very similar to the skulls carried by Shield Jaguar on Yaxchilan Lintel 45 and Bird Jaguar IV on Yaxchilan Lintel 6. The fig- ure carries two different rattles in its hands, a gourd rattle in the left and an oval-shaped rattle with feathers attached to it in its right hand. Two very unusual triangular-shaped objects are tied to the knees. The same objects are also attached to the knees of the figure to the right. A small hieroglyphic caption to the left of the figure iden- tifies its name (Fig. 5a). Unfortunately, the main signs of both hieroglyphs are still undeciphered. The main sign of the second glyph is the same flower sign which appears in the name of one of the seated individuals on Piedras Negras Panel 3 and in the name of the attendant on the so called "El Rey" stela from the vicinity of Yaxchilan. Since the sign is associated in all cases with the TE' "tree" logogram, it very likely represents the name of a particular tree. Figure 2 is dressed in a cape made of jaguar skin. The cape seems to consist in an almost complete jaguar hanging upside down with the head still attached to the body. The head of the figure is covered by a very elaborate feather headdress. In the same way as Figure 1, Figure 2 also displays triangu- lar-shaped objects tied to the knees. The short hieroglyphic caption identifying the individual consists of two glyphs (Fig. 5b). The first begins with the syllable u, but the two other signs are too eroded for identification. The second glyph undoubtedly is AYIN-na, ayiin "alligator". These first two figures seem to present a captive, which according to the count is Figure 3. This captive is kneeling on the ground, his hands seem to be bound and the left arm is bent and touches his right shoulder. The name of the captive probably was written on an elevated (and therefore highlight- ed) hieroglyphic caption. This caption once consisted of three glyph blocks now eroded beyond recognition. Figure 4 is the main figure of the entire scene. This is the king Shield Jaguar II seated on an elaborate throne with unusual, bent edges. The front side of the throne is embel- lished with small incisions which probably indicate writing. The king sits cross-legged with both feet barely visible on the throne, bending over to the left, the center of the scene with the kneeling captive. Dressed in a loincloth and a cape marked with jaguar spots, he holds a kind of triple ax with three shafted flint blades in his left hand, while his right arm is bent in front of his body. His jewelry includes a collar with a giant tubular pendant. On his head, Shield Jaguar carries a jaguar head adorned with long feathers. The face of the king is turned to the left so that he can oversee the presentation of the captive. We can be certain about the identification of the main pro- tagonist as Shield Jaguar because of the elevated cartouche in front of his head. The cartouche is heavily destroyed, and at least two glyph blocks have completely flaked off. How- ever, the missing glyph blocks can still be recognized through the breakage they have left. In spite of the incomplete and badly eroded caption, the last two pre- served glyph blocks in the ver- tical column still show enough detail to identify them as the title phrase "captor of Aj Nik"1 which usually accompanies the name of Shield Jaguar II. His name and emblem must have been written in the following glyphs which are entirely broken off. Finally, the fifth and last figure is an attendant wearing a hat with an animal head and long feathers attached to it. Like Fig. 5. Name captions of three of the individuals depicted on the altar, and the scribal signature, a) Figure 1, b) Figure 2, c) Figure 5; d) the scribal signature (Drawings by Nikolai Grube) 46 mexicon • Vol. XXXVI • April 2014</page><page sequence="8">Figure 1, this also holds two rattles in its hands. The skull attached to the belt and carried on the back is another feature shared by both individuals. Although the headdresses are different, Figures 1 and 5 share enough details to conclude that they are attendants with the same function and that they frame the central image. The name of the individual is written behind the back (Fig. 5c). The caption of three hieroglyphs begins with u-MAM "the grandfather of' and is followed by a hieroglyph of un- known reading but with an animal head main sign. The last glyph probably is a title of origin: AJ K'AN-a, probably aj k'an ha ', "he of the yellow water". A last sequence of hieroglyphs has remained without comment so far because it is not related to any of the five individuals (Fig. 5d). These three hieroglyphs are incised into the background of the monument between the captions related to the captive and to Shield Jaguar II. The first of the three glyphs is the yu-xu-lu y-uxul "it is the sculpture of' collocation which introduces the names of the scribes and artists who carved the monument. The name of the scribe is written xa-pa ka?-?. Unfortunately, the head sign in the last glyph has not yet been deciphered so far. Summary The scene on the side of the drum altar represents the deliv- ery of an important captive to Shield Jaguar II of Yaxchilan. The scene is located inside a palace, as is made obvious by the throne on which Shield Jaguar is seated. Three further attendants all dressed in costumes associated with death and warfare attend the scene. Two of the attendants carry rattles, an instrument which seems to have played an important role during the delivery of captives. Comparable scenes of captive delivery and the use of rattles can be found on La Pasadita Lintels 1 and 2. Fig. 6. The "Split-heaď'-hieroglyph. a) Tikal, Stela 10, G8; b) Co- pan, Stela J, back side; c) Kerr 2213 (Drawings by Nikolai Grube) There is no obvious connection between the individuals dis- played on the side panel and those mentioned in the hiero- glyphic inscription on top of the altar, except for the presence of Shield Jaguar II in both. Although much of the circular text on top of the altar still remains murky, the general meaning seems to focus on the dedication of an object, perhaps the altar itself, which may have been associated with the tomb of Captor of K'an Kitam, a brother of Shield Jaguar II. The object dedication took place on 9.16.13.5.9 (June 14, 764), exactly 22 tropical years after Shield Jaguar's death. Further- more, this is only four years before the last date associated with Bird Jaguar IV, Shield Jaguar's successor (Martin and Grube 2008). These dates suggest that Captor of K'an Kitam derived his prestige still from the connection with his famous brother. These kinship bonds obviously remained so strong that they became the principal topic of the altar inscription even after the death of both Shield Jaguar and Captor of K'an Kitam. It is a great pity that the place of origin of the altar remains unknown. The fact that it has been in a Guatemalan collection previously suggests that it may have come from a place on the Guatemalan side of the Usumacinta river, perhaps from one of the archaeological sites such as Retalteco, El Kinel or La Pasadita, which all have monuments related to the Yax- Fig. 7. The ya-BAT-na hieroglyph in different contexts: a) Copan Altar U; b) Yaxchilan Stela 35; c) Bonampak Stela 1 (Drawings by Nikolai Grube) 4 7 mexicon • Vol. XXXVI • April 2014</page><page sequence="9">chilan kingdom, executed in a style very similar to the lintels and stelae from Yaxchilan itself (Houston et al. 2005, 2006; Golden and Scherer 2006; Golden et al. 2005). We suggest that the secondary site where the altar originated maintained strong ties to Yaxchilan probably through the bonds between the brothers, and that it may have been the residence of Cap- tor of K' an Kitam. The scene of the delivery of captives on the side panel may be related to the history of the place of residence of K' an Kitam. The importance of the altar not only is that it provides us a glimpse into a little known part of the Yaxchilan king- dom. The circular inscription on top also contains a unique, though still very little understood combination of kinship terms, which is best understood as a reference to the mother of Captor of K' an Kitam, who also was the mother of several other individuals, including Shield Jaguar II. This is the first case in the corpus of Maya inscriptions of a list of brothers. It still remains to be explored why brothers are not addressed by one of the existing terms. Possibly, the scribes wanted to avoid the use of too many different kinship terms which would have been necessary in reference to older and younger brother as well as to an older sister and therefore decided to designate all brothers simply as the children of the same mother. This fact, on the other hand, forces us to ask why the mother was given more attention than the father. Shield Jaguar's mother was Lady Pakal, a female who reached the age of 6 K'atun at her death in 705 (Martin and Grube 2008). She is given great prominence on inscriptions from Shield Jaguar's reign. His father is known entirely from retrospective mentions and 'recreated' monuments carved long after his death, suggesting some irregularity or problems in dynastic succession in regard to his reign. It is possible, therefore, that the altar inscription pays more attention to the mother than to a father whose biography was rewritten and recreated to a large degree by his successors.
