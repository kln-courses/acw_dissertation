<plain_text><page sequence="1">500 REVIEWS The The Creation of Man: Philo and the History of Interpretation. By Thomas H. Tobin, S.J. Pp. viii+199. (Catholic Biblical Quarterly Monograph, Series 14.) Washington DC: Catholic Biblical Association of America, 1983. $6. This monograph is a revision of a thesis submitted to Harvard University in 1980 and, as such, concentrates on Philonic methods of interpretation of one single issue, the Creation of Man as described in Gen. 1 and 2. The author, after mentioning other views, definitely aligns himself with those who see Philo primarily as an exegete of biblical texts, who did not aim at formulating a consistent and original philosophical system of his own. The work of previous students of Philo's exegetical methods is briefly, but usefully, evaluated and the author then outlines his own methodology. Where there are conflicting Philonic interpretations he has used only those for which there is multiple attestation. Among these he has looked for patterns of dependence and development. He has distinguished as pre-Philonic those which Philo disclaims as not his own and those which contradict positions held in the Philonic corpus as a whole. Then he has tried to relate the manifold interpretations to traditions and the philosophical milieu of Alexandria and he outlines the growth of Middle Platonism there in the light of the scanty evidence available. The most relevant texts, discussed in detail, are Opif. pp. 69-88, Leg.Leg. 1, pp. 31-47, 53-5, 88-96, and Quaest. Gen. pp. 4-22, but Fr. Tobin also gives references drawn from the whole Philonic corpus. He starts by sharply differentiating the anti-anthropomorphic interpretations, which he sees as a later development designed to counter criticism and reflecting philosophical suppositions of the time. There is another basic conflict. The two descriptions of the Creation of Man may be taken as referring to a Single Creation. In interpreting, Philo at times introduces the Logos figure as both the instrument and paradigm of Creation. Here similarities with Plato's TimaeusTimaeus may be traced, also affinities with Wisdom. This is complemented in Gen. ii. 7 by a description of the Same Creation of Man by an inbreathing of divine spirit, more akin to Stoicism. Fr. Tobin remarks that Philo often interprets a text without explaining his methods and clarifies a crucial phrase to interpret a whole verse and as a bridge for introducing various philosophical concepts, leaning towards Platonism but still citing Stoic views too. Opposed to this is the interpretation of a Double Creation of Man, where the Man of Gen. i is taken as a Heavenly Man and of Gen. ii as an Earthly Man. Fr. Tobin discusses and discards</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 501 speculations as to an Iranian or Babylonian origin for this figure. Philo, he says, uses the same methodology as when he interprets the texts as referring to a Single Creation. The cosmogony of the Timaeus,Timaeus, interpreted by the textual exegesis of Middle Platonism, could be taken as based on the original Mosaic account in Genesis. So the concept of Man as created according to an intelligible paradigm served to foster the interpretations positing the Single and Double Creation alike. Finally, there are Philo's own allegorical interpretations of the Creation of two Men, one Heavenly and one Earthly. Here he includes examination of Gen. ii. 8, 15-17, which described the placing of man in Paradise. His allegories of the Soul are less akin to the physical allegorization of the Stoics than to Neoplatonic allegorization of Odysseus. Philo recognizes different levels of interpretation and adds his own allegorizations, rather than trying to supersede literal exegesis of the text. It is impossible to harmonize all Philo's accounts. Fr. Tobin in his last chapter, 'Conclusions and Limitations', draws together the threads of his investigation. He sees in Philo an idealogy of continuity which makes it possible to trace levels of interpretation and development of Platonically orientated doctrines of the Creation of a Single and a Double Man. Here Philo's own allegorizations, not to be taken as a paradigm for interpreting either the legal or the historical parts of the Pentateuch, contribute to the history of Hellenistic and Jewish exegesis and are also helpful for our understanding of early Christianity and its interpretation of biblical texts. This is an honest and industrious piece of research. The material is well presented. In particular the schemata and tables listing the evidence for conflicting interpretations from various Philonic texts are valuable for reference. The practice of ending each chapter with a summary facilitates understanding of the conclusions drawn from a mass of sometimes bewildering detail. This book should be a useful contribution to Philonic studies. Molly Whittaker</page></plain_text>
