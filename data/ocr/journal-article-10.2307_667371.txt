<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Interamerican Diffusion of a Cooking Technique: The Culinary Shoe,Pot1 KEITH A. DIXON Long Beach State College It is terrifying to think how much research is needed to determine the truth of even the most unimportant fact. Stendhal THIS paper explores a problem in archeological interpretation. Inferences are derived concerning the use and history of a peculiar pottery vessel shape, which are then applied to wider problems of interpretation. In archeological sites in the Southwest and in the Eastern U.S., as well as in Middle and South America, a number of pottery vessels have been found that are usually grouped together in a category called "shoe-shaped" or "bird- shaped"; more rarely, they are also referred to as "duck-", "boot-", "slipper-", "moccasin-", and "foot-shaped." (In Spanish, they are usually called "botas", "patos", "patojos", "zapatillos", or "zuecos.") While some are obvious effigies of the objects from which they take their name, others bear no more resem- blance to one of these objects than they do to any of the others. While studying the distribution and function of bird-effigy vessels in the Southwest (MS in preparation), I noted that some of the simpler vessel shapes cannot be surely identified as imitations of the bird form, and are therefore called "shoe-pots" by some authors. But other authors call the same shapes "bird-effigies" because there seems to be a continuous intergradation from the simple, plain, least bird-like to the most obvious bird-effigies with modeled head, wings, feet, and tail, and with painted eyes and feathers. More careful analysis, however, showed that among the simple vessels many of the larger ones have a number of features in common that the more obvious bird-effigies lack. These features include a wide, short-necked orifice and surface finish typical of cooking ware. In contrast to the other South- western "shoe-pots" and bird-effigies, these features are remarkably consistent in their association with each other and also show a consistent and restricted distribution in space and time. It seemed possible, then, that there is a category of pottery vessels which should be analyzed separately from the other "shoe-pots," on the grounds that they have a different use and a different history. Shortly afterward, during a visit to the Chicago Natural History Museum, I noticed displays of vessels from Nicaragua and Argentina that are identical in all visible respects to the Southwestern specimens. A check of the literature not only confirmed the widespread distribution of this particular form, but also reinforced the possi- bility of its independence from the other "shoe-pots" and bird-effigies. For many years, there has been speculation on the wide interamerican diffusion of the "shoe-pot" (e.g., as part of the famous "Q-Complex"-c.f. Stone 1948). But many of the vessels in this category have nothing more in common 593</page><page sequence="2">American Anthropologist [65, 1963 594 than egg-shaped or horizontally-elongated body, with the orifice at one end. Lumping them together in the same category without considering variation in form and use has tended to obscure some important problems of culture history and has sometimes made difficult the interpretation of pottery uses as well as wider cultural patterns such as ceremony (e.g., Jijon y Caamano 1920:25; Compton 1956). Therefore, the purposes of this paper are: 1) to define the nature of a special culinary kind of shoe-pot and to distinguish it from other "shoe-pots"; 2) to present interpretations of the use of the culinary shoe-pot; 3) to indicate the distribution of the culinary shoe-pot in space and time; and 4) to examine some implications arising from this appraisal. THE CULINARY SHOE-POT AS A SPECIAL-USE VESSEL FORM The culinary shoe-pot can be defined as a pottery vessel distinguished by the following attributes: 1. Body shape: Bilaterally symmetrical on one vertical plane, but asymmetrical about the vertical axis of rotation. That is, the vessels are elongated horizontally, resembling an egg or an oval; the prolonged end terminates in a point or more often is just a long bulge in the side of the pot. The base is usually rounded, occasionally flat, and more rarely has short tripod supports. 2. Orifice: Position: Placed at the broad end of the body opposite the prolongation; never in the center of the long dimension of the pot or at the narrow end. Shape: Restricted in vertical section, but not narrow. Varies from round to broad oval in plan; when oval, the long diameter is usually at night angles to the horizontal length of the body. Size: Large, diameter usually from one-third to two-thirds the horizontal length of the body. Rim: Usually outcurved, grading into vertical on some specimens. Neck: Very short. 3. Vessel size: Horizontal body length is seldom less than 10 cm. or more than 30 cm., and most are from 12 to 20 cm. long. They are therefore rather small compared to most cooking pots. A Mixe specimen that is 17 cm. long and 14.5 cm. high and is typical of the form, holds about 1.3 liters (1 quart 13 oz.) when filled to the brim. The normal capacity of most culinary shoe-pots can be estimated at from 1 to 3 liters (quarts). 4. Surface finish conforms to the style of local cooking wares-usually a rough, unslipped plainware, but may have decoration like other cooking pots that does not interfere with the cooking function and is of a kind not likely to be obscured or destroyed during ule. 5. Handles: Frequently none. When present, there is usually a single small vertical pottery loop attached to the lip and to the neck or shoulder, or else there is a single lip tab; the single loop handle or tab is always placed on the side of the orifice opposite the body pro- longation. In the few areas where there is a second loop handle, it is placed on the opposite side of the orifice from the first handle and may have had relatively less practical value. Even more rarely, the two handles are placed at the sides of the neck. At Chupfcuaro (Mexico), however, the rim sometimes had four small handles. (The lip tab was apparently used for moving the vessel, rather than pouring-Kidder, Cosgrove, and Cosgrove 1949: caption of fig. 13; similar lip tabs are also found singly or in pairs on other shapes of cook- ing pots-e.g., in Arizona: modern Pima "bean pots"-Russell 1908:128, pl. 18, b; late Gila Plain pots-Haury 1945: fig. 63; Sikyatki-Fewkes 1898a: pl. 118, b; and Upper Pima of San Cayetano DiPeso 1956: 286.) While the vessels classified as culinary shoe-pots consistently meet all of these rather specialized criteria of form, the other shoe-pots, bird-effigies, etc.,</page><page sequence="3">DIXON] Interamerican Diffusion of the Culinary Shoe-Pot 595 consistently lack them, except for the overall asymmetrical body shape. The non-culinary "shoe-pots" and effigies generally have considerable variety in shape and proportions of the neck; the orifices are usually narrower and seldom oval; rims are more varied; vessel sizes are far more varied; they are seldom made in cooking ware, but instead receive more careful treatment and are often elaborately painted, incised, or modeled; if there are handles at all, there is usually one large loop handle that arches over the length of the vessel or is attached to the neck on the side toward the prolongation, so as to aid in pouring. One of the reasons why culinary shoe-pots have often been classified as bird- effigies in the past is that occasionally the potter has added small, flat, non- functional lugs of clay to the sides of the vessel body, usually at the points of greatest breadth; sometimes also there is a lug added to the projecting end. These lugs are usually interpreted, probably correctly, as representations of the wings and tail of a bird. These most frequently appear on culinary shoe-pots in the Southwest U.S., where bird-forms are the most common pottery effigies, and are much more rare on culinary shoe-pots of Middle and South America. It should not be surprising that potters would notice the oddly-shaped pot's vague resemblance to the shape of a bird's body, and since they were also familiar with true bird-effigies in other wares, the potter might take the op- portunity of heightening the effect. However, it is important to note that the bird resemblance is never carried beyond this suggestive stage. Since more realistic bird features could not very well have been added without impairing the utility of the pots, and since relatively few such vessels have the bird fea- tures, it would seem that the bird resemblance is a secondary addition to a functionally-determined shape (cp. Latcham 1928:172; Kidder and Shepard 1936:341; Linne 1938:69;contrast, however, Debenedetti 1917:152 and Comp- ton 1956). A very few vessels have the appropriate shape attributes of culinary shoe- pots but are so elaborately painted they could not have been used for cooking; cf. vessels at Chupfcuaro (Peterson 1955:fig. 7), Costa Rica (Lothrop 1926: pl. 122, b), and Arizona (Fewkes 1898b: pl. 19, 3), where many other eccentric shapes also occur in painted wares. I would suggest that these similarities to the culinary shoe-pot shape are coincidental or, at best, the culinary forms or the bird effigies inspired the shape for asymmetric vessels that were put to other uses-fine examples of this practise are the handsome modern glazed copies of culinary shoe-pots for sale in Mexico City tourist shops. Significantly, non- culinary "shoe-pot" shapes do not occur in the culinary wares. The term "culinary shoe-pot" is admittedly not a good one. The form should probably be designated by some such horrific phrase as: "rotationally- asymmetrical horizontally-elongated offset-orifice cooking vessels." Instead, the "shoe" designation is retained because it is common in the literature and it is clearly an abstract descriptive term rather than an interpretive term (con- trast "bird-shaped"). "Culinary" is added in order to emphasize the inferred special use of these vessels and to distinguish them from the wide range of other vessel forms which have been called "shoe-pots."</page><page sequence="4">596 American Anthropologist [65, 1963 USE Evidence for the inferred special use of the culinary shoe-pot is based on 1) the attributes of shape and surface finish that themselves distinguish the ves- sels as a unique class, and 2) ethnographic reports of contemporary use of similar vessels. Unlike other kinds of "shoe-pots," all specimens, so far as published data allow judgment, are in locally-made cooking ware and frequently show soot and other marks of having been in a fire. The large size of the restricted orifice, as contrasted with most other "shoe-pots," is a clue to the specific kind of cooking that the vessels were best suited for. The relationship of orifice diame- ter to use is well expressed by Linton (1944: 370): an efficient cooking pot is one which has a mouth large enough to prevent explosive boiling over and to permit stirring of the contents; it must also have a mouth small enough, relative to the vessel's capacity and heating surface, to prevent it from frequently boiling dry. Furthermore, the tendency to globular body and round or flat bottom suggests the pot was used on coals rather than in flames (Linton 1944:373). The suita- bility of the culinary shoe-pot for boiling is clear. It is also logical that placing the vessel on coals with the orifice on the mar- gin of the hearth while the bulk of the body is toward the center of the hearth would allow the contents to be stirred or ladled out so the cook's hand is less apt to be burned during cooking. The position of the rim edge, loop handle, or lip tab at the outer edge of the hearth would keep it relatively cool and easy to grasp so that the pot may be moved in and out of the heat (cp. Jijon y Caa- mano 1914: 138; Ambrosetti 1908: 301-2). There is ethnographic support for the inferences derived from the form of the culinary "shoe-pots." They are still used by the Zapotec of Oaxaca and their neighbors the western Mixe, by the Popoloca of Puebla, and by the Mapuches (Araucanians) of Chile (de la Fuente 1949:49-50, fig. 5; Martinez Gracida, cited in Gamio 1922:203; Larsen, cited in Linne 1938:69 and 1942:72; Beals 1945:120; Paddock 1955:26; Parsons 1936:fig. 2; Carmen Cook de Leonard, personal communication; Lothrop 1936:16). The cited references indicate that among the Zapotec there is an additional advantage: with the orifice of the pot out of the way, there is room to set another vessel or a comal for baking tortillas in the center of the heat, partly over the body of the shoe-pot, which is pushed in between the hearth stones or the legs of a tripod vessel. By cooking several things at once, time and fuel are saved. The Ica of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, northern Colombia, reported that their ancestors used "shoe-pots" because the vessels could be partly pushed in under the ashes and coals (Bolinder 1942:18), but they may have been guessing. This might serve to promote more rapid boiling by subjecting to the heat a greater proportion of the pot's surface than would be the case with more globular vessels, but I suspect boiling would not be so much faster as to make the form advantageous for the average cook. Other accounts of the use of the culinary shoe-pots are apparently specula- tion on the form of archeological specimens rather than direct observation of</page><page sequence="5">DIXON] Interamerican Diffusion of the Culinary Shoe-Pot 597 their contemporary use (e.g., Southwest-Fewkes 1904:69, and 1898a:651; Argentina-Ambrosetti 1906:58; 1908:301-2). There is no good ethnographic evidence that culinary shoe-pots were used for cooking any one food in all areas. Although culinary shoe-pots are quite variable in size, the majority seem rather small, as indicated above (capacity usually from 1 to 3 liters). Ryden (1936:163), in his discussion of some small Argentine examples of the form, suggests they were "designed for preparing medicines, or the like." However, Beals (personal correspondence) states that the Mixe of Oaxaca use the culinary shoe-pot primarily for cooking beans, since the form is advantageous for long, slow cooking. Carmen Cook de Leonard has informed me that the Popoloca of Puebla use "shoe-pots" to boil potatoes and tomatoes. In 1957, when I interviewed a Zapotec family in Mitla, Oaxaca, I was told that "shoe-pots" are still used in a village nearby; they are apparently not strictly reserved for any particular food but are used for boiling beans and even for making coffee. Mr. Paul Van de Velde informs me he has also seen them used in the Mixteca for "brewed" liquids, as atole and chololate. It seems probable that references to the use of "shoe-pots" for toasting or roasting corn may be in error by identifying the "shoe-pot" with a pottery roaster or brazier (e.g., Boman 1908:307, Uhle 1919:33, and Ryden 1944:135; for an Inca example of the brazier, see Rowe 1946: 244, pl. 77, g). Ceremonial uses or meanings of the culinary shoe-pot are very rare and seem to be secondary to their culinary uses. Paddock (1955:26) was informed by his Zapotec workmen that "shoe-pots" are buried in the house area with the afterbirth. Parsons (1936:xiii) believes it significant that the Zapotec word for the culinary shoe-pot in Mitla is the same as their name for the stream the dead must cross, and that the stream runs near an old burial ground. She also notes that some "shoe-pots" are miniatures and that miniature offerings are buried with the dead. Beals (1945:120) reports that the Mixe culinary shoe-pots are quite variable in size and implies that the miniatures might be used "for moun- tain top offerings by potters, especially learners." In Central America, large "shoe-pots" often had secondary use as burial urns, but frequently the rim had to be broken out to admit the body (Lothrop 1926:254). That many culinary shoe-pots should be found in graves in all archeological areas is not necessarily significant, since burials are one of the archeologist's main sources for whole vessels of all types. DISTRIBUTIONS IN TIME AND SPACE In developed pottery industries, whether the potter's wheel is used or not, the most common vessel forms are rotationally symmetrical about a vertical axis. The asymmetrical vessels require special efforts to make. Even though their rarity and oddness has inevitably attracted the attention of archeolo- gists, the identification of published specimens as culinary shoe-pots is fre- quently difficult because this variety has not been defined before and informa- tion or illustrations are sometimes not sufficiently detailed. It is hoped that the distributions reported here will be checked and re-evaluated by specialists in each area.</page><page sequence="6">[65, 1963 598 American Anthropologist In tracing the distribution of the culinary shoe-pots, I have depended mainly on published sources. No consistent attempt has been made to run down unpublished specimens and they are noted only when they add signifi- cantly to published information. The catalog of published specimens is as com- plete as is presently feasible: coverage of the literature has been fairly thorough for the Southwest U.S., and somewhat less so for Middle America; only major publications and such other reports as were available have been consulted for the Eastern U.S., South America, and the Old World. The geographic distribution is arranged by major areas and keyed to the map (Fig. 1). Following the site name is the assumed dateof the"shoe-pots", then references in parentheses, then the number of specimens reported, and observa- tions of any special features or context other than burials and trash deposits. "Plain" means that available information indicates no decoration, no handles, and no "wing" or "tail" lugs. Unless otherwise noted, lugs, handles, and other features conform to the norms of shape and placement listed above under FORM. Number of specimens refers to the number mentioned by the author- in some cases, more were apparently found than the authors specifically indi- cate. The expressed time range does not refer to the span of existence of the speci- mens, but instead indicates only that they probably date from some time with- in the indicated range. Dating is sometimes difficult and questionable. The authors' opinions and later sources available to me are used (e.g., Willey 1958, Coe 1961). I. EASTERN UNITED STATES Coverage of the literature on the archeology of the Eastern U.S. has prob- ably been less thorough than for the other areas. Nevertheless, personal corre- spondence with Eastern archeologists has not brought more culinary shoe-pots to light. Four specimens are reported. A. Southern Illinois: Kincaid; 1598-post-1613 A.D. (Orr 1951:326, 332, figs. 3, i, 6, m) 2 specimens: two handles at sides of necks, notched fillet decoration. Lengths: 7.3 and 16 cm. B. Eastern Tennessee: Lenoir Mound No. 2; post-1600 A.D. (?) (Thomas 1894:402; Holmes 1903:181-2, fig. 68; Griffin 1943:249, 253, pl. 129, 2) 1 speci- men: two handles, with notched fillet and incised decoration. Length: 15 cm. Classification as culinary shoe-pot possible, but uncertain. (Ascribed to "Cherokee complex.") Citico Mound; post-1600 A.D. (?) (Thomas 1894:376, fig. 251; Holmes 1903:181-2, fig. 69; Griffin 1943:249, 253, pl. 130, 2) 1 specimen: two handles, notched fillet decoration. Length: 13 cm. Classification as culinary shoe-pot possible, but uncertain. (Ascribed to "Cherokee complex.") Comment: Whether these four specimens are actually culinary shoe-pots cannot now be posi- tively determined. They do not, according to available descriptions, show marks of fire or soot that would prove their culinary use. Nor is there ethnographic evidence of their use in the area. All four vessels seem entirely typical of the local pottery in everything but shape (e.g., Griffin's pl. 129, 2, is remarkably similar to the symmetrical vessel in his pl. 129, 4). At present, the only reason to doubt their being culinary shoe-pots, as defined in this paper, is their rarity and their apparent remoteness from the normal range of distribution.</page><page sequence="7">Interamerican Diffusion of the Culinary Shoe-Pot DIXON] 599 0IA 0, rC ' FIG. 1.

SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES Of all areas, coverage of the literature for the Southwest has been most thorough, except perhaps for the last few years. In this area, the separation of culinary from non-culinary "shoe-pots" and effigies is relatively easy because of full descriptions and the very nature of Southwestern pottery, where cooking wares were traditionally distinct from "service" wares (c.f. Kidder and Shepard 1936: 591). The dating of most specimens is fairly secure, though guesses had to be made especially in the cases of earlier publications. About 70 specimens are mentioned, with hints that a few dozen more have been found. A. Rio Grande area: Forked Lightning; 1250-1300 A.D. (Kidder and Shepard 1936:338, fig. 258, c) 1 specimen: handle, wing lugs. Length: ca. 8 cm. Pecos; 1300-1600 A.D. (Kidder and Shepard 1936:338-41, figs. 278, d-f, 280, a-f, 281, a-/) 13 specimens: some with front lug, some with wing and tail lugs, others plain (all late specimens plain, after ca. 1425 A.D.). Some in corrugated ware. Length: range 11-28 cm. Most have traces of soot. Pindi Pueblo; 1300-1350 A.D. (Stubbs and Stallings 1953: pl. 13, a, b; Stubbs, personal communication) 2 specimens: one with handle, both with wing and tail lugs. Corrugated ware. Length: ca. 15 and 20 cm. Paa-ko; 1275-1425 and 1550-1650 A.D. (Lambert 1954:105, 109, 110, pl. 22) Sherds only: "seem to be more common in the later occupation." Length: estimated 11.5 cm. Amoxiumqua; 1300-1700 A.D. (Reiter 1938:106, pl. 15a, g, h, i) 3 specimens: one with handle, one with front lug, one with wing lugs, two with tail lug. Lengths: 16, 17, and ? cm. Poshu; 1475-1600 A.D. (Jeancon 1923:39, pl. 38; Kidder and Shepard 1936:341) 2 specimens: plain, corrugated ware. Pajarito Plateau; 1475-1600 A.D. (Hewett 1906: pl. 14, c; Hewett 1908: pl. 15, j; Kidder 1915:425; Kidder and Shepard 1936:341) 1 specimen: tail lug. Comment: Stubbs (personal communication) reports a specimen from about 15 miles north of Santa Fe which dates to the period 1100-1150 A.D. The vessel has a handle and is in corru- gated ware, but "the pot was unfired and evidently cracked before firing. .... It would ap- pear to be almost identical in size and shape to the one illustrated in [Stubbs and Stallings 1953: pl. 13, a]. However, it lacked the wing and tail lugs of the Pindi specimen." Stubbs also states that he has culinary ware sherds from the Rio Grande area dating ca. 1000 A.D. that are probably from vessels about the same as those shown in Pindi (see above), though he has no examples large enough to give exact size or shape. Conclusions regarding the presence of culinary shoe-pots in this area before 1250 A.D. should await discovery of more surely identi- fiable examples. Pecos was the only site that provided enough specimens over a long enough span of time to allow judgment of possible tendencies of change in form (Kidder and Shepard 1936:338); Kidder only notes, however, that in the later periods (after ca. 1425) the wing lugs are absent. B. Western Pueblo area: Sikyatki; 1300-1600 A.D. (Fewkes 1898a:651-2, 656, pl. 120, a-c; Fewkes 1904:69) "Several" specimens: handles, lip tabs. One in corrugated ware. Length up to 30 or 45 cm. One, in a grave, rested in a "food bowl" and contained a "small rude ladle." Several are "covered with soot or blackened by fire." Kechipaun, near Zuni; 1300-1600 A.D.

MIDDLE AMERICA The contrast between culinary and non-culinary pottery is not as great in Mesoamerica as in the Southwest in some cases; this, combined with a tend- ency to less detailed published descriptions and illustrations, creates problems in identifying and tracing the distribution of the form. Interpretations of dat- ing are frequently much less secure. About 45 specimens are mentioned, with hints that many hundreds more have been found. A. Central and Western Mexico: Chupfcuaro; 300 B.C.-300 A.D. (Peterson 1955: figs. 8, 9; Porter 1956:542, 544, 545, figs. 6, n, o, 8, g, h) 10 vessels: one to four handles, wing and tail lugs. Five have red-painted lugs and rim, one has applique animal limbs and notched fillet from neck to vessel end. Length: range 11-30 cm. In museums in Mexico City, Guanajuato, and elsewhere, there are many dozens of culinary shoe-pots from the Lerma River drainage; for the most part these are like published specimens. The shoe- pot in Lumholtz (1902:405) may be from the same area; it has a handle and is ca. 19 cm. long. Huapalcalco, Hidalgo; ca. 300 A.D. (Florencia J. Muller, personal communication) 1 specimen: tail lug. Length: 23 cm. Clear signs of use on hearth. (Found in Burial J, Monticulo A, Complejo Sur.) Teotihuacan; 1-600 A.D. (?) (Gamio 1922:203, fig. 58; Noguera 1930: fig. 50, p) 1 specimen: plain. San Jose Zoquiapan, Tlaxcala; 1-600 A.D. (Linn4 1942:72, fig. 165) 1 specimen: plain. Length: 14 cm. Estado de Mexico (?); date ? There are at least a dozen culinary shoe-pots in t he State Museum in Toluca; no information was available on provenience at the time of my visit. Comment: Evidence for the culinary shoe-pot in the Teotihuacan culture is not clear. The only possible examples to my knowledge are the Gamio-Noguera specimen (size and ware not indicated) from Teotihuacan itself, and Linne's small specimen from Tlaxcala. There are a number of other small "shoe-pots," mostly miniatures, that are clearly not culinary: one from Teotihuacan (Sejourne 1959: fig. 110A); three purchased at A zcapotzalco bearing in-</page><page sequence="10">602 A merican Anthropologist [65, 1963 cised water symbols (Neys and von Winning 1946: fig. 1, a); two purchased at Ahuitzotla (von Winning, personal correspondence); and specimens on exhibit in the National Museum, Mexico City. These non-culinary specimens may imply the presence of larger culinary shoe- pots, but for the present the question must be left open. B. Gulf Coast: Tres Zapotes; 1200-1300 A.D. (Soncautla Complex) (Drucker 1943:104, 106, pl. 23, k) 1 specimen: handle. "Small, possibly a miniature vessel." Soncautla: 1200-1300 A.D.

Classification as culinary doubtful. Bernal states it is identical with one from Teotihuacan and feels it was imported from there; he also states it is not like the "shoe-pots" of Monte Alban I or V.

Comment: A "shoe-pot" that has frequently been referred to in the literature is the early Las Charcas Phase specimen from Kaminaljuyi (Shook 1951: fig. 1, E); Borhegyi has informed me it is definitely not a culinary shoe-pot. Since the specimen brought up from the waters of Lake Amatitl,n is at present the earliest reported culinary shoe-pot in North America, it is important to stress that Borhegyi feels sure of the phase placement. Another group of "shoe- pots," with effigy faces in applique and modeling on the projecting end of the pot, may not be culinary. They range from the nearly round specimens from Nebaj (Smith and Kidder 1951:68, fig. 74, q, r) to the more pointed specimens such as those from Zacualpa (Lothrop 1936:16, pl. 6, e) and Stephen's Zaculeu specimen (Stephens 1848: facing p. 231). Lothrop compares the Zacualpa "shoe-pot" with culinary shoe-pots he saw being used in Chile; how- ever, I suspect that the blackening of the tip by fire was incidental-despite the single handle, the plain ware, and the prolonged effigy tip, the effective form of the body and orifice does not suggest the special uses of the culinary shoe-pot. Employment as censers would seem more in keeping with the form and decoration. Seler (1904:110, fig. 25, b) illustrates an extremely elongated example of this form and says they are "properly called xe lahuh,</page><page sequence="11">DIXON] Interamerican Diffusion of the Culinary Shoe-Pot 603 'foot of the ten' "; my cursory attempt to discover the possible significance of this in the Popul Vuh and elsewhere had no meaningful results. This type might possibly grade into the culinary form-Bransford (1881:56-7), who apparently examined hundreds of asym- metrical vessels, saw gradual transitions from round to longest oblong, and from plain to obvious elaborated effigies. Whether or not the doubtful specimens discussed here are in- cluded, the general view of culinary shoe-pot distribution in time and space is not materially affected. E.

Comment: Whether or not these two specimens be accepted as culinary shoe-pots, it seems clear that such vessels are not part of the typical lowland Maya ceramic complex. F.

Bransford states that the smaller specimens "seem to have been designed for water and food, as shown by the remains of bones, &amp;c." though one wonders if they might contain cremations instead; the largest are of unusual size and their classification as culinary shoe-pots is not certain. Most of the culinary specimens seen by Coe have two handles. Highlands; 1100-1600 A.D. (Hartman 1901:23, pl. 6, 1; Strong 1948b: fig. 24, after Lothrop 1926: pl. 194; M.

SOUTH AMERICA The difficulties in tracing the distribution of Middle American "shoe-pots" are duplicated here, but in'magnified form. Descriptions tend to be less com- plete, dating is less secure, and relevant publications have been more difficult to obtain.

Jij6n reported 8 specimens in 1914 from three sites-five have tripod supports and all seem to be plain; illustrated tripod specimen is 20 cm. long.

The bottom of at least one is smoked and blackened from use. Comment: A fragment from Ecuador (Chorrera Phase, ca. 1500-500 B.C.), reported by Estrada (1958: fig. 45, 2), may be a culinary shoe-pot, but the ware does not seem appropriate; it would be the earliest specimen yet reported from South America.

Mapuches (Araucanians) of Chile; ethnographic present (Lothrop 1936:16) Comment: I wish to emphasize that I have been unsure in placing some of these specimens in time and cultures. A specimen from Santiago, Chile, reported by Toribio (1952:430, fig. 211), may be a culinary shoe-pot (handle, rather small orifice, length ca. 16 cm.). Bregante (1926:239-42, 307-8, figs. 290-2, pl. 15) repeats data and illustrations from earlier sources, mentions the locations of unpublished specimens, and provides a distribution map of "shoe- pots" in northwestern Argentina. OTHER AREAS AND CULTURES The "shoe-pots" that some authors have mentioned for other areas and cul- tures, such as early Pueblo (Southwestern U.S.), the middle Mississippi Valley, Brazil, west Mexico, etc., are not culinary shoe-pots judging by the evidence available in cited sources; they presumably form a separate and, in most cases, unrelated series of problems. To my knowledge, there are no culinary shoe-pots in the Old World. Bamps (1879:125) states that a vessel of this type was found in Basses-Alpes (south- eastern France) in 1877. But this in all probability is the rude specimen later published by Nadaillac (1892:99, fig. 26) It is more likely that this vessel's prolongation was only a handle-the effective vessel shape would not make it appropriate for the uses postulated here for the culinary shoe-pot. Nor should the pitcher forms of the Old World, such as the ruder askoi (e.g., Compton 1956: fig. 11, p-s), be confused with culinary shoe-pots. SUMMARY In published sources, about 215 culinary shoe-pots are specifically men- tioned, and relatively few of these are described in detail; there are hints that many hundreds more have been found. But imperfect as the available data may now be, a broad historical pattern seems to have emerged. Mesoamerica: The earliest culinary shoe-pot is the single specimen from Lake Amatitlan in highland Guatemala, if the early date for the Providencia-Sacatepequez Phase is accepted (500-300 B.C.). Otherwise, in the period before 200 or 300 A.D., culinary shoe-pots were present in abundance only in the Lerma River drainage of Mexico; there is only one possibly early specimen from Oaxaca re- ported so far. Except for the Lake Amatitlan vessel, all specimen could have been later than 1 A.D. In the period ca. 200-1000 A.D., culinary shoe-pots may possibly have oc-</page><page sequence="14">A merican Anthropologist [65, 1963 606 curred in the Teotihuacan culture, but if so they were rare. They seem to have been present in highland Guatemala at that time, and may have been more abundant in western Central America. After 1000 A.D., they were present in Oaxaca and on the Gulf Coast in Veracruz. They also continued in highland Guatemala, and in western Central America where they continued to be most abundant. At present, they are in use only among some peoples centering in the Oaxaca region. South America: Among South American specimens, the ones from the Peruvian Gallinazo Phase are perhaps the most likely to be the earliest (300 B.C.-100 A.D.), since the Ecuadorian Guangala Phase specimens may date anywhere between 500 B.C. and 500 A.D., and thus may have been contemporaneous with the speci- mens from the Narino zone of Colombia and from Candelaria, Argentina. All specimens could have been later than 1 A.D. In the period 500-1000 A.D., they were probably present in Colombia, Ecuador, and Chile-Argentina. After 1000 A.D., they continued in the same regions, but became most abundant in the Chile-Argentina region. At present, they are used only by the Araucanians of Chile. Southwestern U.S.: All Southwestern specimens were within the period 1250-1700 A.D., and the form seems not to have lasted into the historic period. Only some Rio Grande specimens, of uncertain identification as culinary shoe-pots, may have been earlier than 1250 A.D. It seems most likely that the form diffused from Mexico between 1200 and 1300 A.D., even though there is no likely source known at this time (the northernmost Postclassic Mexican specimens are from southern Veracruz). Whether the form arrived first in the Rio Grande Valley or in southern Arizona is not known; lip tab handles on "shoe-pots" and other cooking vessels may give a clue to diffusion patterns within the Southwest. It should be noted that other culture elements, especially of an artistic and re- ligious nature, arrived in both Southwestern areas from Mexico at this same time level. Eastern U.S.: The last area where culinary shoe-pots appeared seems to have been in southern Illinois and eastern Tennessee in late Mississippian sites that were influenced by the Southern Cult. The four known specimens seem to date after 1600 A.D. There is no good reason to doubt their identification as culinary shoe-pots, except for their rarity and distance from the rest of the form's distribution. Therefore, there are four possible explanations: 1) these vessels are accidentally asymmetrical products, no different in use from the other local vessels; 2) they are true culinary shoe-pots, independently invented in this area; 3) they represent a very late diffusion from the Rio Grande Valley; and</page><page sequence="15">DIXON] Interamerican Diffusion of the Culinary Shoe-Pot 607 4) they represent a very late diffusion from Mexico. The fourth alternative might seem most reasonable on the grounds that strong Mexican influences are known in other traits of the late Mississippian cultures, although no likely Mexican sources for "shoe-pots" are yet known at this time period. Discussion: Culinary shoe-pots are clearly Nuclear American, and first appear in the late Preclassic or Formative stage in both Mesoamerica and South America. The earliest specimen, ca. 500-300 B.C., is from highland Guatemala. At this stage, they are relatively more abundant in Mesoamerica, which suggests the form originated there. Diffusion of other traits to South America at even earlier periods, probably by a sea route, has been well established (e.g., Coe 1960). Ap- parent lack of early specimens in Central America suggests that this area was not the diffusion route. In both Middle and South America the form spread to a limited number of cultures, but over a wide area. Finally, after 1200 A.D., it reached the South- western U.S., and perhaps eventually the Eastern U.S. as well. It has survived to recent times only in Oaxaca and north Chile. The assumption in this paper has been that the wide distribution of the culi- nary shoe-pot is accounted for by diffusion from a single place of origin, rather than two or more independent inventions in different areas or times. However, as with most problems of this kind, it is hard to muster positive proof. Instead, it is a question of relative probability. Given a fairly uniform food and food- preparation complex in the area of the form's distribution, multiple inventions as responses to similar needs are a possibility; but the weight of this possibility is lessened, and the case for diffusion strengthened, when the role of the vessel in food preparation complexes is examined (see Discussion, below). Diffusion also seems more probable in view of the compact distribution, which is limited to Nuclear America and to marginal cultures that also received other extensive influences from Nuclear America. DISCUSSION The results of the analysis thus far can be conveniently summarized in terms of Thompson's four steps in the inferential process (1958'1-8, 27-8, 148-9)' 1) The indicative data are the relatively plain asymmetrical pottery vessels (a special class of "shoe-pots") made in cooking ware, which are spot- tily distributed in archeological context from northern Arizona, through Nu- clear America, to central Chile. 2) The indicated conclusion is that these pot- tery vessels represent a special cooking technique of such value they were widely diffused from one center of origin. 3) The probative data are the limited possibilities of use of the form itself, consistent association of the essential shape attributes with each other and with cooking ware, appropriate marks of contact with fire, and observation of use of similar vessels by a few peoples dur- ing the ethnographic present within the area of prehistoric distribution. 4) The probable inference, then, is that there is a special class of "shoe-pots" quite</page><page sequence="16">608 American Anthropologist [65, 1963 different in use and history from the total group of vessels usually classified by this term-namely, the culinary shoe-pot form, which diffused widely through Nuclear America and adjacent areas because it was convenient for long boiling of foods, especially when the contents needed frequent attention or the hearth was crowded. Given the probability of the inferences, certain wider problems of archeo- logical interpretation logically follow. Four interdependent questions will be considered here: 1) What significance does the culinary shoe-pot have for problems of inter-culture relationships? 2) What was the manner of diffusion of the "shoe-pot"? 3) What was the role of the culinary shoe-pot in the food-prepa- ration complexes of the cultures where it was used? 4) Why was the culinary shoe-pot absent from many of the cultures within its broad area of distribution? Although the analysis began with certain physical objects recognized by their attributes as a valid class in material culture, the true subject of analysis has become not so much a vessel form as a vessel use represented by the form. The vessel use, in turn, represents a cooking technique within the food prepara- tion complex of a culture. Since the vessels are made of local cooking wares wherever they are found, it follows that what was diffused (or re-invented) was the idea of the cooking technique, which found material expression in the vessel form made recognizable to the archeologist by its essential attributes (see defi- nition of the form, above). The concept of the culinary shoe-pot as representing a special cooking technique can therefore be considered an archeological "type" that serves two useful purposes at once: 1) it can be used as a culture trait that may aid in tracing culture relationships in space and time, and 2) it can be used as the kind of culture trait which contributes to reconstruction of culture content and cul- tural behavior.2 The significance of the culinary shoe-pot for the first purpose is of necessity closely related to its significance for the second purpose, as will be demonstrated in the following discussion. As shown above, the culinary shoe-pot was by no means universally used by all peoples within its area of distribution. It was logical, therefore, that Kidder (Smith and Kidder 1951:68) should point out that as humble, utilitarian household utensils, their distribution "might reveal, more clearly than that of fine and ceremonial pieces, the basic relationships of cultures." In other words, the presence of the culinary shoe-pot in two cultures might be interpreted as evidence for their common derivation, or for a kind of contact between them that was more intensive, more intimate, or more pervasive (e.g., conquest or colonization) than the more superficial kind of contact that might spread an attractive art style, a prestigeful religious cult, or interesting gadgets, curiosi- ties, and traded luxury goods. The utility of the culinary shoe-pot as an indicator of the nature of the rela- tionships of cultures depends, therefore, on understanding the possible reasons for acceptance or rejection of the shoe-pot cooking technique throughout its broad area of distribution. This in turn must be based on an understanding of the role of this cooking technique in the cultures where it is found. Unfortu-</page><page sequence="17">DIXON] Interamerican Diffusion of the Culinary Shoe-Pot 609 nately, there are few ethnographic data available to me that are relevant to this question, but some inferences may be drawn by turning largely to archeological context. In considering first the reasons for acceptance and persistence of the shoe- pot cooking technique, several alternative hypotheses can be discarded on the basis of discussion in the body of the text: a) The culinary shoe-pot's distribu- tion can be explained as the consequence of repeated accidental products of inept potters or by a "play" factor. While this hypothesis may possibly account for several origins of the form, it seems logical to disregard it as a general ex- planation for its persistence. b) The distribution of the shoe-pot cooking tech- nique is simply the result of the trade of a curious vessel form from one or more centers. This hypothesis may be discarded because the culinary shoe-pot is al- ways reported to be made in local culinary wares. c) The culinary shoe-pot diffused because it has esthetic appeal in the context of Nuclear American cul- tures. This hypothesis may be discarded on the grounds that the "shoe-pot" is never flamboyantly elaborated and because objects of primarily esthetic appeal were rarely made in cooking ware. d) The culinary shoe-pot diffused as part of a religious cult. We may discard this hypothesis because there is no indication of consistent ceremonial uses or associations with any religious manifestation either in ethnographical or archeological context, with the possible exception of Oaxaca (see above), which is evidently a local development. There are two remaining hypotheses that could account for the wide diffu- sion pattern of the culinary shoe-pot. 1) The cooking technique (and its material expression as the pot) was an essential response to some basic need common only to the peoples using the technique; e.g., its use is necessary to the prepara- tion of certain foods or for certain hearth types. 2) The cooking technique and the pot were a non-essential, alternative response to a need shared both by peoples who used and who did not use the technique-a convenient gadget of no great importance, in somewhat the same category as our own fads in auto- matic ashtrays and tricky potato peelers. In examining evidence for these two hypotheses, then, a key factor is the nature and importance of the need relative to the special use of the vessel. The most immediate observation is that the shoe-pot cooking technique is limited entirely to peoples with a sedentary village settlement pattern and a stable agricultural economy. That this is no accident is evident from the preceding text and from reasons discussed by Linton (1944), which explains why "shoe- pots" were rejected (or not invented) by less sedentary, non-agricultural peoples within the broad area of the form's distribution. However, present distributional evidence indicates that many peoples did not use the culinary shoe-pot but did have sedentary villages and stable agri- cultural economies and were in contact with users of the "shoe-pots". We must therefore search for a more specific need common only to those who used the form and cooking technique. The distribution shows that shoe-pots were limited to seed-eating agricul- tural peoples, and were not used by those emphasizing root-crops. Among such</page><page sequence="18">A merican Anthropologist [65, 1963 610 peoples, the most common food that is usually prepared by long boiling con- sists of several kinds of beans. The "shoe-pot" seems to have been used only among peoples who, to my knowledge, did use beans (though, as ethnographic evidence shows, other things are also cooked in "shoe-pots"). However, the cor- relation is far from perfect. Many more bean-eating peoples did not use "shoe- pots" than did use them. The same seems to be true of any other seed-food that requires boiling. Furthermore, distributions suggest that there is no interde- pendent relationship of the "shoe-pot" and a particular hearth type; that is, among cultures with the same kinds of hearths, some did and some did not use "shoe-pots." Thus, for the present time at least, the attempt to correlate the invention and diffusion of the shoe-pot cooking technique with the distribution of a par- ticular food or hearth type fails, and the first hypothesis suggested to account for the acceptance of the shoe-pot cooking technique may be temporarily re- jected in favor of the second. Turning now to reasons for the absence of the shoe-pot cooking technique in cultures where it might be expected, specific hypotheses are more difficult to propose and test. Several hypotheses may be tentatively rejected: a) "Shoe- pots" were absent in a culture because of lack of contact with people who did use them. This is unlikely in most cases because of known patterns of trade and in- fluence demonstrating contact over long periods of time; the extraordinary breadth of distribution of this special form and technique also argues against a lack-of-contact explanation. b) "Shoe-pots" are absent because the foods that need to be prepared by this technique are absent, or because the hearth type favoring use of the form is absent. This hypothesis does not seem to apply be- cause those peoples who used "shoe-pots" and those who did not seem often to prepare the same basic foods in the same basic way; no correspondence with a special food or hearth type of parallel distribution with "shoe-pots" has been discovered. c) The apparent absence of "shoe-pots" may be due to faulty re- porting, insufficient investigation, or poor preservation of whole pottery ves- sels. However, this explanation surely does not apply to such areas as the Valley of Mexico or to the Yucatan peninsula. While any of these hypotheses may apply in specific cases, neither singly nor together do they seem to explain the majority of cases among seed-growing peoples, within the broad area of distribution, where "shoe-pots" seem never to have been used or where they died out. For example, culinary shoe-pots are abundant in the late Preclassic of the Chupfcuaro area and are present in Oaxaca later but are rare or absent in the intermediate Valley of Mexico cul- tures, where so much more excavation has been done. They were present both early and late in highland Guatemala, but not in Yucatan. If present in Peru at all, they are apparently early, whereas they are relatively abundant both to the north and south in later times. There is no direct evidence for the manner of diffusion of the culinary shoe- pot to shed light on the nature of the contact between groups. In most cases,</page><page sequence="19">DIXON] Interamerican Diffusion of the Culinary Shoe-Pot 611 one might expect the shoe-pot concept to pass from woman to woman, in their usual role of either cook or potter. However, it would seem entirely possible that men could carry the idea (but not necessarily the cooking pots themselves) on trading expeditions over great distances-for example, between Mexico and the Southwest, or between Mesoamerica and Ecuador.3 Such expeditions have usually been associated with the spread of luxury goods, of decorative styles and techniques, and of ideas concerning agriculture and religion, which are in fact the principal evidences of contact between these areas. There is the possi- bility that trading expeditions or colonies did include women who played a role in the contact situations. But the culinary shoe-pot cooking technique cannot be considered at present as good evidence for interpretations of this kind. It remains to be determined how important the culinary shoe-pot was to the people who did use it. The best data would be the number of such vessels per person or per household at a particular time in various villages; however, there are no ethnographic data bearing on this problem, and reconstruction of "shoe-pots" from sherds is usually not sufficiently reliable for archeological data to be of help. Another indication would be the proportion of "shoe-pots" to other kinds of cooking vessels in a village; again, there are no ethnographic data, but archeological information can be considered relevant when there is a large sample of whole or reconstructed vessels of all kinds and a functional interpretation of these vessels. The report on Tumacacori, a small village in southern Arizona, describes the greatest number of "shoe-pots" from a single site and also offers a functional classification of other restorable vessels (DiPeso 1956:280 ff.). Here, the 31 culinary shoe-pots are about 23% of the total of small ("personal") cooking pots, a category DiPeso interprets as little cooking vessels "in which the indi- vidual heated or kept warm his portion of the family meal" (cf. an interesting parallel in Argentina, in Ambrosetti 1908:301-2). These small cooking vessels outnumbered the large ones, perhaps used for cooking the whole family meal, by a proportion of 2:1. Whether or not DiPeso's interpretations of the func- tions of different size vessels are correct, the culinary shoe-pots at Tumacacori form a reasonable proportion (15%) of all the restorable cooking vessels and may therefore be considered a standard, but perhaps not essential, household item. Since they cannot be matched to a use or food different from that of the other "personal" cooking pots, they are probably best interpreted as simply an alternative response to the same need. While the proportion of "shoe-pots" to other cooking vessels is relatively high at Tumacacori, the archeological record shows the form to be much more rare in all other sites. It is conceivable that the overall impression of rarity may be due to patterns of publication and, more important, to the difficulty of recognizing the form in sherd material (Kidder and Shepard 1936'338). But on the whole, it does not seem probable that the culinary shoe-pot will prove to be an essential item of household use, even in cultures where it was frequent.</page><page sequence="20">612 A merican A nthropologist [65, 1963 CONCLUSIONS This paper has had the purpose of testing the significance of a postulated special kind of asymmetrical vessel ("culinary shoe-pot"), separated on grounds of physical attributes and inferences of use from the other kinds of "shoe-pots" with which it has traditionally been classified. The general cate- gory of "shoe-pots" is meaningless; instead, there are various kinds of asym- metrical vessels, each with its own history and significance. The culinary shoe-pot probably originated among a seed-growing agricul- tural people in Mesoamerica in the middle or late Formative stage (in the cen- turies before 1 A.D.). During the same period it was probably brought by a sea route to the coast of Peru or Ecuador. In South America, it had spread north to Colombia and south to Chile and Argentina at least by 500 A.D. In Meso- america, the form also spread to a limited number of cultures, among which it came to be most abundant in Oaxaca, highland Guatemala, and western Cen- tral America. Along with other Mesoamerican influences, the culinary shoe-pot reached the Southwestern U.S. between 1200 and 1300 A.D., and perhaps the Eastern U.S. by 1600 A.D. The form apparently survives only in Oaxaca and Chile. On the basis of available evidence, I would suggest that the cooking tech- nique represented by the culinary shoe-pot diffused because in the context of the food-preparation complex of the peoples accepting it, it was a convenient way of boiling foods over a long period; by shoving the bulging side of the pot over the coals, with the orifice toward the outer edge of the hearth, the vessel may be moved and the contents may be stirred or ladled out with minimum risk of burning one's hand, and more vessels may be set over the shoe-pot body so that other foods may cook, thus saving time and fuel. However, the unique advantages of the form were probably not essential to food preparation since other pot shapes and hearth arrangements could be used for the same basic needs of cooking food. It is surprising that refinements which would seem of such minor advantage to the ordinary cook should be the reasons for the odd form's extraordinarily wide diffusion; its appeal as a gadget is ad- mittedly not a very dramatic explanation, but there seems to be little else to account for its spread and persistence. While the form was apparently attractive as a convenient gadget, it was "rejected" by some cultures, and by some families in cultures where it wvas known, for reasons that remain obscure. Perhaps the answer lies in differential receptiveness to innovations in gadgetry in the various cultures, which might also be reflected in other aspects of those cultures. However, the explanation for the rarity or even lack of "shoe-pots" in any culture where they might other- wise be expected should probably also be sought on the particular rather than the general level, in analysis of the whole food preparation complex of that cul- ture, including such aspects as hearth types, numbers of vessels usually on the hearth at one time, styles of preparation of various foods, spacing of meals, cooking habits, and social patterns connected with eating. Preliminary at-</page><page sequence="21">613 DIXOn] Interamerican Diffusion of the Culinary Shoe-Pot tempts along these lines have proved fruitless for lack of data, and only empha- size how little is known in detail of either ancient or recent American Indian food preparation complexes. On the basis of these conclusions, it would seem that the diffusion of the shoe-pot cooking technique does not have any unusual relevance for problems of the nature of inter-culture relationships, even though this humble, everyday trait is quite different in kind from the majority of those that are usually em- phasized in problems of wide inter-culture diffusion. In addition, suggestions that the culinary shoe-pot might be an especially significant indicator of the "basic relationships" among different cultures are not supported by present evidence for the role of the technique because it does not seem to be a trait that is relatively stable or resistant to replacement and does not seem to have had an essential role in food preparation complexes. Such questions require formu- lation on a far more abstract plane, for which a particular cooking technique such as this would seem to have only minor relevance. Nevertheless, the culinary shoe-pot, when precisely defined both in form and use, should have a clear and important place among the series of traits most useful to the archeologist and ethnologist in studying the growth and development of New World cultures, but only when its role in the whole cul- ture is understood. NOTES ' Earlier versions of this paper were given at the annual meetings of the American Anthro- pological Association in Santa Monica, California, in 1956, at the Southwestern Anthropological Association meetings in Berkeley, 1962, and at the XXXV International Congress of American- ists, Mexico City, 1962. I am deeply indebted to many people for reading parts of the MS in vari- ous stages of its preparation and for offering help in locating published and unpublished data on un- familiar areas. I wish explicitly to absolve my colleagues from any inadequacies of the paper or misinterpretations of what they have so kindly contributed to it. I wish especially to thank Ralph L. Beals, Stephan F. Borhegyi, the late George W. Brainerd, J. O. Brew, Michael D. Coe, Donald Collier, Charles C. DiPeso, Hal Eberhart, Robert F. Heizer, Olaf Holm, A. V. Kidder, Carmen Leonard, J.

Stubbs, Carr Tuthill, Paul Van de Velde, Gordon R. Willey, and Hasso von Winning. 2 However, the culinary shoe-pots themselves that are found in either archeological or ethno- graphical context can be broken down into more sensitive, detailed types for specific purposes, on the basis of such attributes as degree of asymmetry, size and capacity, handle type and placement, and decorative styles. Detailed types may be defined differently, of course, depending on their purpose-as time-space markers or for culture content reconstruction. Certain obvious possibilities have been purposely omitted from this paper for lack of space; examples are the distributional significance and possible meanings of applied notched fillets and zoomorphic-anthropomorphic ap- plique figures on culinary shoe-pots, which are found in Mesoamerica and South America. Instead, this paper has concentrated on the shoe-pot cooking technique as a broad trait. 3 In 1961, I searched for "shoe-pots" among women pottery venders in markets in the states of Michoacan, Jalisco, Mexico, Guanajuato, and Queretaro. Each time, I first explained the form of cooking vessel I wanted and how it was intended to be used, and finally drew one on paper. None had ever seen such a form, but about half the women seemed intrigued by it and acknowledged its utility; a few took the trouble to tell me exactly where I could have some made to my specifica- tions. It would be interesting if the "shoe-pot" should now have a latter-day spread, because of brief contact with a male foreigner.</page><page sequence="22">614 American Anthropologist [65, 1963 REFERENCES CITED AMBROSETT,, JuJABB. 1906 Exploraciones arqueo16gicas en la Pampa Grande (Provincia de Salta).
