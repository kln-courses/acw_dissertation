<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Young Gangster As Mythic American Hero: E. L. Doctorow's Billy Bathgate Minako Baba Kwansei Gakuin University, Japan Among the creative principles held by E. L. Doctorow are the notion that "history lives in people as imagery" (Ruas 200), and the idea of "using disreputable materials and doing something serious with them" (McCaffery 36). In Billy Bathgate (1989), he has turned to the image of gangsters as a usable past to compose a fantasized history of the 1930s. As critics have often remarked, lawlessness, especially when it is associated with rugged individualism, has always appealed to the American imagination, but the attraction of the gangsters in the early 1930s was phenomenal because of the distressed economic conditions of the time. Doctorow's recent novelistic rendition of the lawless era can be placed in the line of Jewish-American fiction exemplified by such works as Daniel Fuchs's Low Company (1937) and Meyer Levin's The Old Bunch (1937), which has given expression to one aspect of immi- grant life: "crime was one traditional route out of the ghetto" (Guttmann 41). What is remarkable about Billy Bathgate, however, is its basic scheme of blending fiction and historical fact. Doctorow has set the story in the year 1935-the year in which New York Attorney-General Thomas Dewey brought rigorous indictments against racketeers (Gor- don 153)-and against this historical background, he has conjured up an adolescent apprentice to Arthur Flegenheimer, alias Dutch Shultz, making the boy the big-time gangster's spiritual son. The result is the gripping historical fantasy of a young American hero's perilous jour- ney fabulously patterned after the mythic hero's archetypal journey discussed by Joseph Campbell in The Hero with a Thousand Faces. The following essay is an attempt to read Doctorow's gangster novel as Bildungsroman and, simultaneously, to illuminate his view of the streak of lawlessness in the American consciousness. 1 According to the author, the idea of Billy Bathgate has its origin in a peculiar image lurking in his imagination-"men in tuxedoes on a MELUS, Volume 18, Number 2 (Summer 1993)</page><page sequence="2">MINAKO BABA tugboat" (Freitag 46). The opening chapter, evidently evolving out of this original image, introduces an episode of a ritual murder in New York Harbor as epitome of the young hero's initiation journey into the dark unknown world. The rolling sea water in the dead of night, which gives the tenement boy from the Bronx an alienating sensation of riding on "a beast of another planet" (6), adds a mythic quality to the episode and turns it into a symbolic confrontation with a mon- strous father-figure. Billy experiences the cruelty of Dutch Shultz, his idolized gangster role-model, and the exasperated despair of Bo Weinberg, a loyal gunman, who is unfairly condemned to death for double-crossing. Billy as narrator confesses, "My witness was my own personal ordeal" (9, emphasis added). Moreover, Drew Preston, Bo's lover, who has been abducted from a party along with him,' is also portrayed here as a mythic figure. The beautiful but depraved society woman, characterized by her blond hair and her white neck and shoulders, is brought up to the cabin "as if she was rising from the ocean" (15). This image prefigures her role in Billy's adventure: an Aphrodite, a goddess of love and fertility, as well as a siren, a danger- ous temptress. In the second chapter, the narrative shifts back to the very first stage of Billy's adventure and begins the story again in a comic mode. Billy's early history of abandonment by his Jewish immigrant father not only mirrors the life of the historical Dutch Shultz but also makes him a comic orphan figure, like Huck Finn or Augie March, who lights out for a lawless realm. Mark Twain's novel, narrated in a rustic boy's unpretentious voice, presumably soon after the great adventure, re- captures both the pastoral dream and harsh reality of the antebellum South. Saul Bellow's Bildungsroman, on the other hand, is told in highly intellectual, allusive language, years after the main events, and repre- sents the realistic and the idealistic adventures of a modem urban hero over a long period of time. Doctorow's novel is also told from a mature man's perspective, but it is focused on the memory of an intense criminal adventure experienced in adolescence, and is written in a style that intermingles a street boy's gritty, vulgar language with a successful businessman's eloquent, but not obviously allusive, lan- guage. Despite these stylistic distinctions, however, the three novels share the motifs of fatherlessness, lowlife, and brushes with criminal- ity. Fleeing from his father and his society with a fugitive slave, Huck becomes involved with two villainous con men, the King and the Duke. Similarly, Augie, an illegitimate son from a ghetto, is at times made accomplice in such criminal acts as shoplifting, burglarizing, and selling stolen books. Billy's sense of special endowment and his inclination toward self- dramatization-even more than his sense of fatherlessness-are major 34</page><page sequence="3">GANGSTE1 RE AS MYTHIC HERO IN BILLY BATHGATE motives for his adventurous journey. Fifteen-year-old Billy prides himself on his dexterity and keen vision to the point of likening himself to a comic-book superhero, "The Phantom" (23). It is, in fact, his extraordinary juggling performance that distinguishes him from the rank of street-gang kids and draws Dutch Shultz's attention. Billy depicts his first encounter with Shultz as if it were a fairy-tale ritual of being knighted: on a bright summer day in a vacant lot in front of one of Shultz's beer drops, his "king" offered him a ten-dollar bill as a prize, called him a "capable boy," and then his hand "came down like a scepter" and held the boy's cheek (26-27). Here Shultz's whimsical act is interpreted by Billy as a symbolic call to adventure. A few days later, Billy buys a gun as "a kind of investiture" (33) and maneuvers himself into the inner-office sanctum of Shultz's racket, crossing the threshold into the unknown world. Billy's apprenticeship under Shultz may be compared to Augie March's education under the tutelage of William Einhorn, the most influential and eloquent of the Machiavellian figures in The Adventures of Augie March. Just as Augie's introduction to Einhorn's library, as well as to his real-estate office and his poolroom, gives Augie his bookish frame of mind, so Billy's induction into the system of the underworld will have a lasting impact on his later business career. The basic difference between the two relationships, however, is that Einhorn, who has a biological son and heir, does not quite play the part of surrogate father for Augie in the way Shultz and Berman finally do for Billy. In its declining days, Shultz's syndicate is kept afloat by his "rage of power" on the one hand and Otto Berman's "calm administration of numbers" (58) on the other, and Billy sees a different type of father figure in each of the two men. Berman, the financial wizard, is a practical mentor who employs Billy for the "brazen genius" (55) of his ambition and teaches him to respect the statistical laws of mathematics as well as the rigorous codes of racketeering. At the same time, he is a sympathetic man who takes the boy under his wing and shows ges- tures of concern for the Billy's mother. Shultz is a charismatic father figure with a booming voice and a furious but humorous manner of speech. When he adopts Billy as his young confidant and elaborates on the tribulations and challenges of managing an illicit business, Billy sympathizes with him almost completely and internalizes his point of view: How I admired the life of taking pains of living in defiance of a govern- ment that did not like you...and wanted to destroy you so that you had to build out protections for yourself with money and men, deploying armament.. .patrolling borders.. .by your will and wit and warrior spirit 35</page><page sequence="4">MINAKO BABA living smack in the eye of the monster, his very eye. (67) Here Doctorow plays with conventional heroic roles to convey the gangster's inverted notion of just and unjust: the criminal racketeer is the embattled hero and the reformist government is seen as the evil monster. Notwithstanding his fascinated identification with Shultz, Billy re- tains a double attitude of involvement and detachment that resembles Augie March's dual disposition of adaptability and opposition. Fur- thermore, Billy's ambivalence parallels the mythic hero's agony in transcending ordinary human life, which he must undergo in order to attain reconciliation with the father. Billy understands in theory his spiritual father's outraged sense of injustice, but he cannot acquire "the feeling" for the "first pure inverted premise" (74) of that peculiar code. Obviously, this is because he does not have what Peter Lupsha, in his essay on American values and organized crime, acerbically calls "a talent for violence," a talent that is supposed to reinforce "the individual decision" of a street-gang youth to become a real mobster (Lupsha 150). The positive obverse side of Billy's lack of talent for violence is his enduring sense of humanity, which first manifests itself when he witnesses the murder of a fire inspector who has appeared unexpect- edly at Shultz's night club, possibly looking for a petty bribe. The unpremeditated murder disturbs everybody, including Shultz, the impulsive murderer, but Billy is especially horrified to see that "it [life] can be so humiliated, so eternally humiliated" (82). The respect for human dignity he expresses here will motivate him to protect Drew for the humane purpose of keeping his promise to Bo Weinberg, the promise termed as "the first act of mercy in my life" (160). The heroic act of formulating his own values in opposition to gangland's tribal code can be compared to Huck Finn's famous decision to save Jim at the risk of transgressing the civic law and bringing damnation upon himself.2 In tandem with Billy's sense of humanity and justice is his self- image as redeemer, which he derives from his love for his neighbor- hood and his mother. The homecoming episode after the murder of the fire inspector is a symbolic withdrawal to ordinary human life as well as to his socio-psychological origins. The familiar ghetto street, crowded with pushcarts and open stalls and alive with hawking merchants and haggling women, has a sobering, pleasing effect on Billy. As he claims to be moved by "the sullen idyll of all this impover- ishment" (34, emphasis added), his indigent but lively immigrant neighborhood, together with the sooty but warm ambience of his mother's kitchen, is a pastoral, nourishing space for him. 36</page><page sequence="5">GANGS'IER AS MYTHIC HERO IN BILLY BATHGATE Like Augie March's gentle, vulnerable mother, Billy's mother suf- fers from the fate of a deserted wife and betrays signs of half-crazed sorrow in her appearance and behavior. Nevertheless, she is a reliable parent who has struggled to raise her son without the benefit of a domineering but supportive presence like that of a Grandma Lausch. The most sustaining image surrounding Billy's mother is her memo- rial candles, kept burning in glass tumblers even while she is away at work. This ritual observed by the beleaguered Irish immigrant woman who has adopted her Jewish husband's religion, is freighted with a graver significance than Grandma Lausch's "kitchen religion" (Bellow 17). It may be her own way of transforming her absconding husband into a dead one, thus giving order to her disrupted life. The candle glasses, which give Billy an uplifting illusion as if he were looking up into "a chandelier" or "a grand imperial firmament," are poignant reminders of the immigrant mother's unfulfilled material and spiri- tual dreams, as well as of her tall stature and "majestic" (90) air. Not only does Billy appreciate the spiritual significance of his mother's personal rituals, but he also respects her humble, honest work as a laundress, as opposed to his unduly lucrative criminal job. Another image pertaining to his loving mother is an old wicker baby carriage with a rag doll in it, which she has acquired during his absence and installed in his room. It is a pathetic token of the out- grown image of his innocent childhood, which his mother wishes to retrieve. Symbolically, the carriage will figure as his mother's protec- tive amulet in the last stage of his journey, when he uses it as a camouflage prop during his criminal mission.3 Succored by his impoverished but empowering neighborhood, Billy sports a reversible jacket with the team name, "The Shadows,"-a name suggestive of the mysterious comic-book superhero of the 1930s- stitched on it. This symbolizes his secret wish to become "one of the possibilities of redemption" (94, emphasis added) in the middle of the Depression. In other words, Billy sees himself as a candidate for hero, who embodies for his neighbors a sense of "hope...that as bad as things were, America was a big juggling act and that we could all be kept up in the air somehow...in the universe of God after all" (95). Here Billy's vague sense of God may be another instance of Doctorow's application of one of Shultz's legendary character traits, "a respect for religion as such" (Thompson 307). However, while the real-life Shultz's religious sense appears to have been rather prosaic and opportunistic, the fictional Billy's metaphysical sense may be said to be more in line with the idea of America as God's republic and the American tradition of mystic desire for a union with the higher sphere-what Robert C. Fuller calls "aesthetic spirituality" (11). Billy, a self-conscious juggler who feels that his life is "charmed" (53) and who draws a self-con- 37</page><page sequence="6">MINAKO BABA gratulatory anthropomorphic picture of God as the juggler of human conditions, is a roguish version of the romantic American hero. Cher- ishing his mystic sense of redeemership, Billy responds to a summons back to the underworld, whereupon the plot of the novel comes full circle and returns to the opening scene of the murder in New York Harbor. 2 The major episodes of Billy's initiation take place during his journey to upstate New York, a journey that comes on the heels of the episode in the harbor. This part of the journey, basically grounded on the historical fact of Dutch Shultz's trial in the remote town of Malone, New York (see Thompson 332-34), represents both the young hero's geographical and social initiation into the heart of an America hitherto unknown to him, and his psychological initiation into the depths of the underworld. Billy's initial encounter with rural America is in the mock-pastoral tradition of Jewish-American fiction, reminiscent of works like Ber- nard Malamud's A New Life and Saul Bellow's The Adventures of Augie March. Seymore Levin seeks a new life in an idyllic western town, only to become involved in encumbering love affairs and demoralizing college politics; Augie March prances off with rich, athletic Thea Fenchel to the exotic Mexican desert, where Augie is injured and shocked into recognizing the ferocity of nature and the falsity of his own love. Like his literary brothers, Billy first marvels at the peace and beauty of the country, only to be disillusioned later. Onondaga, ironi- cally named after an Indian tribe and flaunting a statue of an Indian and a token museum of Indian culture, is a frontier ghost town, where the conflict between nature and civilization is either past history or absurd mockery. During a pleasant, solitary walk along the outskirts of the town, Billy is disconcerted to hear "an uncountrylike sound with an alarming breadth to it" (132) and to observe a group of destitute farmers scrambling to pick up potatoes missed by harvest machines. This is a distressing picture of the machine in the wasteland, as it were. Ironically, Billy himself will soon be guilty of adding to the jarring sound of the machine as he takes part in practice shooting, with a sense of excitement and satisfaction. Indeed, the arrival of the gangsters turns what is already a material wasteland into a moral wasteland in which everybody is susceptible to corruption. The local banker is eager for Shultz's patronage; the police chief is paid off to let the gangsters use the police shooting range; the Catholic priest, willing to add a wealthy member to his flock, skirts around ecclesiastical rules to perform a hasty baptismal rite for Shultz; and finally, the local jury will be inveigled by the mobster's philan- 38</page><page sequence="7">GANGS1 'E AS MYTHIC HERO IN BILLY BATHGATE thropic gestures into handing down a verdict of not guilty. Another phase of Billy's social education in an unfamiliar rural town is a public-relations masquerade he is obliged to participate in with the gangsters and the captive woman, who is now the boss's lover. Rigged up in fine clothes under the guidance of Drew Preston as his temporary "governess" (126) and passed off as his boss's "protege" (128), Billy receives a crash course in respectability, learning table manners and horseback riding, and attending Bible study classes. Here he is a mischievous Huck Finn figure, especially in regard to the disrespectful language he uses in reference to Biblical Hebrews: "the desert gangs" (129), a phrase which may remind the reader of Huck's cursory expression for Moses and his fellows: "dead people" (Twain 2) . At the same time, he is-in his mocking self-description-like "Little Lord Fauntleroy" (138). Billy's uneasy, ironic reaction to Drew's "project" (135) of gentrifying him reflects the general dissonance between the tenement-bred Jewish gang member and the upper-crust WASP woman, manifest, for in- stance, in the dining room scene, where Drew eats her dinner in an ostentatiously genteel manner that antagonizes Shultz's men, includ- ing Billy. The question of ethnicity is most strikingly foregrounded through Shultz's strategic conversion to Catholicism for the purpose of aligning himself with the Italian Mafia. By declaring his preference for the "dignity" of "everybody singing something together" in church over the Judaic tradition of "the old men davening...everyone mum- bling to himself' (175), Shultz betrays his ignorance of the spiritual significance of his ethnic tradition and exasperates Irving, one of his men. To turn from the sociological aspects of Billy's education in Onondaga to its psychological aspects, the most symbolic episode is a clandestine picnic in the hills with Drew. Here the visual images of the deep forest as "cave" and as "great sunlit gorge" (151) evoke the mythic motif of descent into the earth. In this prenatal locus ("cave" as womb) within a picturesque early-American natural landscape, Billy witnesses Drew's silent mourning, and then relates the story of Bo Weinberg's last moments, making a verbal descent into the underworld and discover- ing himself as a storyteller. In recounting Bo's final testament, Billy recreates the brief moment of the gunman's "paradise of recollection," which in itself had the effect of carrying both the narrator (Bo) and the auditor (Billy) off the tugboat into downtown New York, as if "the story is a span of light across space" (159). Moreover, as Billy finishes transmitting Bo's pa- thetically euphoric reminiscence of his homicidal exploits, he com- pares the ecstatic, ephemeral quality of storytelling to that of juggling: 39</page><page sequence="8">MINAKO BABA The story was clearly over, as in juggling when the ball you throw up finds the moment to come down, hesitates as if it might not, and then drops at the same speed of that celestial light. And life is no longer good but just what you happen to be holding. (160) This is a self-conscious metafictional remark, for when Billy concludes his own narrative of Bo's life and death with the haunting image of him disappearing into the sea, Drew silently climbs down the gorge and submerges herself in the water as if she wished to experience Bo's death vicariously or to escape from a reality that is "no longer good." Surfacing, she returns to life, establishing "an alliance of sorts" (166) with Billy. In this way, the pastoral episode of the picnic marks the self- discovery of a self-conscious verbal juggler, at the same time as it inaugurates him in the role of Drew's protector and redeemer. Another important episode in Billy's psychological education is the trauma of being made accessory after the fact to yet one more case of unpremeditated murder. For the greater part of his stay in Onondaga, Billy has been impressed to see Shultz continue to manage "a working tyranny" (186) in New York. He has expected it to ensure his own survival. However, when he is made accomplice to the disposal of the body and then is suddenly whacked on the nose to draw his blood to cover up the telltale blood stains at the scene of the crime, he is shocked into recognition of the essentially sinister, destructive nature of the criminal organization, and he feels a frightening sense of es- trangement as well as a strong sense of injustice. Following as it does the reconfirmation of his secret pact with Bo to protect Drew, this episode underlines Billy's psychological independence from his sur- rogate fathers. Fortified with an insightful, individuated mindset, Billy is now ready to be initiated into manhood. On his way to Saratoga Springs, presumably keeping Drew in custody, he is again led into the deep woods by her, whose initial image as Aphrodite is evoked again by the green landscape and the green car she drives. During the love scene that follows, Drew's characteristic green eyes are described as going dim "as if time had turned in her and she had passed back into infancy and reverted through birth into nothingness" (217-18). Here she is an Aphrodite figure who obliterates the past, grants "absolution" (219), and promises a renewed life. Unpredictable as Drew Preston is, she plays the role of initiator into both culture and nature, leading Billy to positive self-discovery, and is, therefore, a more benign version, as it were, of Thea Fenchel in the Mexican episode in Augie March. Reinvigorated and redeemed by Drew, Billy arrives in Saratoga Springs, her annual summer resort, equipped with the wisdom and prowess to act as her redeemer. In this luxurious resort town, the 40</page><page sequence="9">GANGS'IER AS MYTHIC HERO IN BILLY BATHGATE social-cultural difference between Billy and Drew becomes most pro- nounced, making him feel a scornful sense of alienation from Drew and her aristocratic racetrack crowd. Nevertheless, the episode of her rescue takes place at a horse race, where people of different classes gather for "democratic ceremonies of gain and loss" (236). The motif of a racecourse as a theoretically democratic place is similar to that in the climactic episode of Daniel Fuchs's Low Company, but the situations in the two episodes clearly contrast. The callow young man in Fuchs's novel is coerced by a gambling hoodlum into stealing his boss's money and is taken to a race track where he loses all the money and becomes embroiled in a homicidal incident. Doctorow's ingenious young hero succeeds in blocking the planned murder of Drew by finding a way to call for her husband's rescue party. Waiting anxiously for its arrival, he fills her private box with flowers, thereby attracting a crowd of wealthy spectators who construct "a moving shield around her" (238), screening her from the plebeian Jewish gangsters standing at the rail. Billy's ability to act as a redeemer, though concluded in an obviously Hollywoodian fairy-tale scene where the fair lady takes off in a private plane, is supposedly a logical sequel to the pastoral scene of rebirth in the woods. 3 The apparent completion of Billy's initiation notwithstanding, the crossing of the return threshold is problematic. Billy comes home from the country to his urban neighborhood, feeling like "an absolute foreigner" (247), almost unrecognizable to his own mother. He, too, seems reluctant to go back to the realities of ordinary human life. His mixed emotions are best illustrated in the following scene: while he is having lunch with his mother in a restaurant, he suddenly sees Drew's image in his mother's face across the table, and is struck with horror at the illusory resemblance between the two women. In spite of his love and concern for his mother, his mind is still drifting in the extraordi- nary dream/nightmare world of adventure. Accordingly, the last stage of Billy's initiatory adventure is a tempo- rary reversion to the underworld. Reunited with Shultz after the gangster's upstate acquittal and entrusted with the critical assign- ments of delivering bribes and spying on the state attorney-general, Billy now moves around autumnal New York on behalf of his surro- gate fathers, who have gone into hiding. Here he is not so much a classic orphan-hero on a mythic journey as a modern existential hero struggling for survival and at the same time celebrating the urban landscape: New York, seen from a double-decker bus during his business trips, looks to him as if "it was all for me, my triumphal procession" (283). 41</page><page sequence="10">MINAKO BABA On the night Shultz and his henchmen are killed, Billy's "conviction of invisible empowerments" (256) and his identification with Shultz have reached their apex. As he reports on his mission (spying on Attorney-General Dewey to abet Shultz's outrageous assassination plot), he enjoys a sense of craftsmanship and feels "the malign plea- sure of conspiracy" (298). Furthermore, the occasion turns out to be a symbolic moment of atonement with his spiritual father: as Shultz puts his hand on Billy's shoulders, Billy feels "the warmth of the hand, and the weight of it, like a father's hand, familiar..." (299). Ironically, only a few minutes later, Billy is violently thrust back to the helpless state of fatherlessness and a sense of disorientation. Billy's "extraordinary peripheral vision" (26) and his keen sense of hearing makes his own survival possible: It is the peculiar power of mirrors to show you what is not otherwise there. I see the blue neon cast of the clock tube above the bar as it encroaches on the floor of the passageway to the dark tavern. It is like a kind of moonlight on black water. And then the water seems to ripple. At the same time I hear the bartender's rag suspended in its swipe over the zink bar beneath the draft beer taps. I hear now that I heard the front doors to the street open and close with unnatural tact. (300) By shifting to the present tense and adopting a descriptive impression- istic style, Billy as narrator presents a suspenseful reproduction of the brief second of young Billy's almost preternatural awareness of the killers' presence and thus creates an exquisitely tense scene that simul- taneously conveys of his own struggle for survival and the tragic, abrupt termination of the lives of the big-time gangsters who have figured as vivid characters until this point in the narrative. In the anticlimax of the novel, the moder absurd hero is apparently clothed in the accoutrements of the nineteenth-century popular or- phan-hero again by coming into a legacy and ascending to respectabil- ity. Here Doctorow capitalizes on the rumored existence of a man who may have had partial custody of the historical Dutch Shultz's hidden money (Thompson 345), as well as on the police record of Shultz's delirious last statement. After mourning the death of his spiritual fathers "like a wretched orphan"(306) and enduring one final ordeal (he is blackmailed by a rival gangster),4 Billy reawakens to the underworld's ongoing struggle for spoils and searches the record of Shultz's last words for clues to stashes of money. Subsequently, he brings his quasi-mythic journey through "the fateful region of both treasure and danger" (Campbell 58) to a successful completion, literally carrying away the "treasure" with him, in Tom Sawyer fashion, to the world of ordinary human life. To beguile the rival gangsters, he temporarily keeps a low profile, 42</page><page sequence="11">GANGS' ER AS MYTHIC HERO IN BILLY BATHGATE assuming the mask of a moneyless immigrant son. He moves himself up to a better high school and a better neighborhood by dint of his own intelligence and diligence. In this context, Billy fulfills his self-image as his mother's redeemer by taking her out of the ghetto and restoring her confidence, authority and beauty. At the same time, he effects a symbolic redemption for his Jewish neighborhood by setting an ex- ample of the American dream. Moreover, the unexpected arrival of his own baby at his door the following spring somehow redeems his criminal past and, hopefully, brings about his atonement with the heavenly Father: "the event that doesn't exonerate the boy I was but may delay for a moment reading him out of heaven" (321). Handed over to him by Drew Preston and welcomed by him in such pious terms, the baby not only signals the unequivocal end of his boyhood and his miraculous ascension from fatherlessness to fatherhood, but also symbolizes his spiritual rebirth through his offspring. Thus, unlike the open-ended narrative of Augie March or Huck Finn, Billy's Bildungsroman is apparently wrapped up in fulfillment and stasis. Nevertheless, Billy's spiritual redemption and rebirth is not unam- biguous. In fact, Billy as narrator makes the following confession about his failed attempts at self-renewal: I have many times since my investiture sought to toss all the numbers up in the air and let them fall back into letters, so that a new book would emerge, in a new language of being.... But...always it falls into the same Billy Bathgate I made of myself and must seemingly always be.... (321, emphasis added) He has never been successful in creating a new self ("a new language of being") or a new life ("a new book"), but has always been left with his old self. The concept of "numbers" is a memento of Otto Berman's world view, and likewise, "Billy Bathgate" is the moniker by which he, as an apprentice gangster, named himself after his neighborhood street. Presumably, not only has he retained his precious immigrant origin but also has inherited both the material and spiritual legacies of his criminal surrogate fathers. As Billy the narrator says, he has made his way through an Ivy League college and the U. S. Army to a certain fame and responsibility in corporate America; and so, he adds, he prefers not to tell whether or not he is still in the criminal trades. The implied figure of a shady businessman may remind the reader of Dave Plotkin, one of the "boys" in Meyer Levin's The Old Bunch, who keeps his association with the underworld even after he becomes a lawyer. Also, the reader may recall the conclusion of Augie March, in which Augie, an avowed quester after truth and harmony, seeks profits in the black market in postwar Europe in collusion with Mintouchian, a New 43</page><page sequence="12">MINAKO BABA York lawyer. It seems that Billy's deliberate obfuscation at the conclusion of his Bildungsroman is meant not only to make the nature of his own busi- ness suspect but also to hint at the general streak of lawlessness in American capitalism that Peter Lupsha has pointed out: "The line between sharp practice and criminal act has always been a blurred one" (145). Obviously, it is not Doctorow's intention to pass final judgment on such ambiguity. Moreover, in the scheme of the Jewish- American hero's adventure, this ambiguity may serve to add a finish- ing touch to the mythic quality of his journey: after traveling from a ghetto to the mainstream American society via the Jewish under- ground and gentile rural America, Billy is finally the master of two worlds, mainstream and ethnic, "normal" and criminal, and is free to go across the border in a manner curiously reminiscent of the way the mythic hero bridges his two worlds, divine and human. Furthermore, the above quotation from the novel, with its refer- ences to life as "letters," "book," and "language," inevitably poses another question of metafictional ambiguity-it expresses a degree of skepticism regarding the possibility of recollecting and redeeming human lives through verbal means. However, Billy, a verbal juggler with a fundamental respect for human life, is not wholly skeptical. Besides observing that his account differs from the public record, he makes the following comment on the nature of his memoir: "I have told the truth of what I have told in the words and the truth of what I have not told which resides in the words" (321). This cryptic remark is a deconstructive statement of a reconstructive way of reading/writ- ing, which invites the reader to participate in deciphering the written words and reading between and behind the lines in order to give life to a young American hero and to resuscitate the gangsters who were once idolized by poor tenement boys but whose lives were so violently eradicated. This statement, together with the earlier comparison of storytelling to juggling and to "a span of light across space" (159), is Billy/Doctorow's proclamation of the role of literary art in straddling two worlds, real and imagined, in order to compose an alternative history and to keep the reader enthralled in a brief fictional time and space. By creating an imaginative, adventurous street-gang boy with a mystic sense of being a redeemer and placing him at the end of gang rule in New York, thus keeping him just short of total commitment to the lawless realm, Doctorow has successfully played out the game of "doing something serious" with disreputable genres (McCaffery 36). Doctorow's gangster novel, rendered in a parodic style full of mythic and literary motifs and images as well as historical facts, is not only a 44</page><page sequence="13">GANGSTER AS MYTHIC HERO IN BILLY BATHGATE 45 violent but also a lyric-comic myth of the 1930s. At the same time, it is a Bildungsroman of a roguish but innocent hero with a variety of recognizable faces from the gallery of American heroes: Huck Finn, Tom Sawyer, Little Lord Fauntleroy, Augie March, Seymore Levin, Dave Plotkin, The Shadow, and The Phantom. In his review of Billy Bathgate, Terrence Rafferty argued, somewhat unfairly, that Doctorow clings to the notion of the Old World as the only true culture and that he "won't assimilate" (114). On the contrary, Billy Bathgate is not only in the mythic tradition but also in the American grain, with a certain Jewish-American texture. It is a fascinating performance of verbal juggling, a brilliant story, a bright "span of light across space" and time. Notes 1. The relationship between Bo (a gangster) and Drew (a society woman) is emblematic of the general atmosphere of 1930s caf6 society. For the character- ization of Drew, Doctorow may have taken a hint from the historical Dutch Shultz's short-lived association with Park Avenue people. See Thompson 336. 2. The suggestion that Billy's protection of Drew is reminiscent of Huck protecting Jim has been made by Gary Wills (3). 3. In the latter part of the novel, the baby carriage image is temporarily tainted by Shultz's account of a tragic shoot-out that had aroused public wrath because an innocent child had been killed while Dutch Shultz had survived unscathed.
