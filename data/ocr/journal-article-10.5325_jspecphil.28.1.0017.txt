         <title>Alien Encounters of Design and Object-Oriented Ontology</title>
         <p>The relationship between answer-motivated design that aims to resolve human symbolic or practical problems and question-inspired philosophy that hopes to understand and relate to the world is an uneasy one. Historically, design disciplines invite philosophers in moments when a crisis of meaning shakes the world of making. For example, philosopher Martin Heidegger spoke to architects concerned with postwar challenges in 1951 in a conference entitled “Man and Space.” Theodore Adorno spoke about “functionalism today” in a 1965 lecture on architecture. Jacques Derrida's interview “Architecture Where Desire May Live” addresses a postmodern design–philosophy encounter. Philosopher Graham Harman's interview in the March 2013 issue of the journal <italic>Design and Culture</italic> follows the same appeal to philosophy at a moment of crisis. Lucy Kimbell, design lecturer and interviewer, posits Harman's object-oriented ontology (OOO) as a counterpoint to the recent dominance of problem-solving user-centered design.<sup>1</sup> The attempt aims to remind design readers of the agency of materials and processes. As an academic trained in both design and philosophy, I read this encounter with keen interest and hoped to better understand Harman's articulation of the density of being, as well as find direction within the fissure of interdisciplinary motivations. As a result, this essay is an attempt to digest the taste of OOO offered in <italic>Design and Culture</italic> for dual and opposing perspectives of object-oriented ontology (by which I reference the autonomy and indecipherability of things) and design (a practice centered on the practical and symbolic function of things). I suggest that Ian Bogost's explanation of Harman's thought articulated in <italic>Alien Phenomenology, or What It's like to Be a Thing</italic> offers designers strategies toward object orientation, presented through experiences of roasted green chiles, udon noodles, and pound cake.<sup>2</sup> Furthermore, I argue that the opacity, complexity, and processes of things (or units, as Bogost defines) may offer a remedy for my interdisciplinary malaise.</p>
         <p>The strategy for this article borrows from the surprise ingredient basket moment of the popular Food Network show <italic>Chopped</italic>. Here contestants are given four ingredients that do not have immediate gastronomic connection for an appetizer course, a main entrée course, and a dessert course; for example, one episode presented the contestants with the challenge to construct an appetizer using baby octopus, bok choy, oyster sauce, and smoked paprika. The challenge requires each contestant to create a dish that offers a pleasurable taste experience but also celebrates the differing characteristics of each mystery ingredient. Ian Bogost leads us through the curiosity of what it is like to be a thing with surprising rigor despite the epistemological humility OOO demands, much like the <italic>Chopped</italic> contestants, who show their expertise by navigating new encounters with ingredients. Inspired by the experimental approaches of <italic>Chopped</italic> and Bogost's text, by way of argument structure, I serve this philosophical meal in three courses:

These three moments combined help characterize Graham Harman's idea about “the black noise” of things. The exploration of OOO through culinary examples is framed by an introductory synopsis of Harman's interview and concluding remarks that consider OOO as instructive for interdisciplinary encounters.</p>

      <sec id="s02">
         <title>“The Object Strikes Back: An Interview with Graham Harman”</title>
         <p>Lucy Kimbell, associate fellow at the Saïd Business School, University of Oxford, contextualizes the interview amid the central role of objects in design disciplines against the dematerialization of the object in design literature as “design thinking.” Kimbell invites the perspective of Harman's object-oriented ontology into this paradox for insight and writes, “Harman's position is immediately attractive to those of us working in design. It allows us to reconsider the assumption of human-centeredness in recent design thinking. Is design primarily concerned with creating meanings of things …, or is it possible to think about design as stuff having relations with other stuff, in which humans are not always relevant …?”<sup>3</sup> Further into the interview, Kimbell adds that Harman may be able to help designers think about material “kickback” against human intent. I agree with Kimbell that Harman's object-oriented ontology offers a way for us to peer into the souls of objects through speculative realism and challenge traditional human/nonhuman encounters and by proxy motivations of design. However, the relation, I argue, exceeds a postcolonial-like counternarrative of the “object striking back” against the human as the subject.</p>
         <p>A priority of “interobjectivity” that opposes a priority of intersubjectivity may be fruitful in thinking about human/nonhuman encounters. For example, an interpretation of interobjectivity may explain the humor of a <italic>Portlandia</italic> skit from episode 3, season 2, that shows a woman walking out to her car. She receives a phone call on her iPhone, and as she puts it to her ear, the iPhone drops. The drop prompts a series of happy memories with her phone followed by a series of worries about a life without her phone. The woman anxiously feels the Heideggerian ready-to-hand and present-at-hand aspects of the object. The phone hits the ground unharmed, and she sighs in relief. As she revels in her good fortune, a bicyclist hurls toward her and knocks her over. The scene ends with the woman, the subject of the skit, shattering into pieces. The inversion mocks our dependence on the anthropomorphized iPhone.</p>
         <p>The <italic>Portlandia</italic> iPhone scene calls our attention to the human/nonhuman encounter and offers a reversal of perspective. In doing so, the object strikes back through a positive emotive power instead of negative kickback, as in Ray Bradbury's short story “The Veldt,” in which an automated “happy life home” kills and replaces the parents of two young children. In these cases there is a reverse anthropomorphizing of objects, infusing them with intent and emotive power. The reversal of subject/object roles that these and other like examples depict certainly challenges the limits of user-centered design. However, object-oriented ontology aims at uncoupling the human measure of all things by affirmation <italic>or</italic> negation altogether.</p>
         <p>How can we make an ontology dedicated to the rejection of anthropocentrism serve design, a necessarily anthropocentric practice? To ask, “What are the design implications of OOO?” seems to miss the point of object orientation. The philosopher side of me cannot but feel that the interview sits uncomfortably in <italic>Design and Culture</italic>, particularly in an issue dedicated to design writing. Perhaps sensing this discomfort, Harman summarizes, “I suppose I'd put it this way: all human activity and inquiry deals with objects, but in some fields this relationship is so strong that there can never be any temptation of idealism, and I suppose design would be a good example of this. Though while visiting New York recently, I was surprised at the vehement anthropocentrism of a few designers I encountered.”<sup>4</sup> Design disciplines may have an anti-idealist advantage and access to things; however, this access is not guaranteed by the discipline but, rather, by the attitude of the designers themselves. In order to cultivate an object orientation, designers need to admit nonhuman agents as makers too. Making without intent directly assaults the notion of design as an expression of human symbolic, practical, and social intent. In contrast, for OOO, the agency of things is the frontier of human thinking beyond which we can only speculate. With such divergent agendas, design and OOO cannot be allies, yet neither are the disciplines enemies. What am I to make of the deep trenches between teleological, purposive user-centered design and speculative object-oriented ontology? Here, Ian Bogost's <italic>Alien Phenomenology, or What It's like to Be a Thing</italic> helps.</p>
         <p>As a practitioner and philosopher, Ian Bogost, video game designer, Georgia Tech professor of digital media, and radical philosopher, describes the trenches and fissures that divide things and disciplines, such as OOO and design. Bogost's text <italic>Alien Phenomenology, or What It's like to Be a Thing</italic> flows in and out of philosophical and material examples alike. His argument runs like rushing water over rocky terrain; it seems to diverge and splash everywhere and yet run a course. In this way Bogost avoids a strict causal and logical narrative and, instead, offers examples through the use of lists, images, and “meanwhiles.”</p>
         <p>I will focus on three moments represented by three culinary examples in his text. These moments help chart a course of thinking that might navigate the trenches between design and OOO through claims of object opacity, complexity, and process. In using these examples, Bogost approaches what Harman defines as the black noise of objects, writing, “Harman uses the name ‘black noise’ to describe the background noise of peripheral objects: ‘It is not a white noise of screeching, chaotic qualities demanding to be shaped by the human mind, but rather a black noise of muffled objects hovering at the fringes of our attention.’ <italic>Black</italic> is the color of sonic noise that approaches silence, allowing emissions of but a few spikes in energy.”<sup>5</sup> Bogost's oblique search for the black noise of objects is evident appropriately in his examples of specific things, rather than in conceptual proclamations. Roasted green chiles, udon noodles, and Alton Brown's pound cake are three of many alien encounters described in the text.</p>

         <title>Roasted Green Chiles</title>
         <p>
            <italic>Alien Phenomenology, or What It's like to Be a Thing</italic> opens with a series of descriptive passages about atomic bomb testing, Civil War battles, and aliens in Roswell and ends with an account as follows: “Just to the west, in Doña Ana County, the hot, dry sun increases capsaicin levels in the green chile crops that grow around the tiny village of Hatch. Tumbling in vented steel cylinders, chiles crackle over the open flame of roasting. Eventually their skins blister and brown, then blacken. Peel separates to reveal the bright green meat beneath, as if drawn open like the wounds of the mountain-Christ. They cover plates of enchiladas as shrubs cover the hundreds of square miles of their desert home.” The detail Bogost devotes to roasted green chiles aims to present an account of the experience of the chile through the use of metaphors and imaginative projection. The details introduce us to the challenges of thinking about what it is like to be a thing. The equal treatment of the green chile alongside the atomic bomb, aliens, and the Civil War ushers us to the guiding question of the book: “Why do we give the dead Civil War soldier, the guilty Manhattan project physicist, the oval-headed alien anthropomorph, and the intelligent celestial race so much more credence than the scoria cone, the obsidian fragment, the gypsum crystal, the capsicum pepper, and the propane flame?”<sup>6</sup> He ascribes the priority of the human over stuff to Kant's celebration of human intent in the form of transcendental idealism. The history of philosophy justifies the fallacy of human hubris that everything revolves around us and our needs, desires, and whims. And, according to Bogost, it is time we interrupt that legacy, not from a posthuman ecological stance, which ultimately serves human survival, but, rather, from a perspective of human awe and wonder at stuff as inherently meaningful. The green chile moment sets the stage for speculation about things independent of our use of them. This takes us to Heidegger's notion and Graham Harman's interpretation of “tool-being”: that all beings are always both present-at-hand and ready-to-hand. The implications of human cultivation, processing, distributing, and consuming are certainly a part of the story of the green chile, but not the only or whole story of what it is like to be a chile—this is what Bogost, Harman, and OOO want us to consider. To ask, What is the human purpose for this consideration, wonder, and awe about things? defeats the purpose of OOO. We could, however, ask, Why are things worthy of wonder at all?</p>
         <p>Let us consider mid-twentieth-century architect Louis Kahn's supposed claim that a brick wants to be an arch. At first glance it appears as if the architect, known for his attention to materials and construction, is taking the object perspective. Instead, OOO would search for the “soul” of the brick, beyond its material characteristics, relations and fissures, and encounters with human and nonhuman alike. How can we approach the opacity and dense being of a brick? We cannot. We assume failure to identify its being. Once we admit the opacity of things, we can only list (a “Latour litany,” as Bogost explains), whereby the soul of a brick is imagined to reside in the spaces between, in the black noise of its density of being: clay, hard, edges, building, arch, porous, weapon, cooking weight, heavy, fort, arts and crafts, mud, brown, red, waste, road, yellow brick road, house, Rome, winter, three little pigs, and on and on. When I as a designer construct a red brick house, I merely reduce the being of a brick to my intent. OOO imagines bricks capable of ontological agency with or without human intent. As Bogost states, “All things equally exist, yet they do not exist equally.”<sup>7</sup> While OOO grants equal existence to all things, it does not claim that all things experience existence equally. For Louis Kahn, the highest form of existence for a brick would be to be an arch. While Kahn's speculation granted the brick's desire, it also aligned that desire with his own. The density of being, as Harman claims, renders things opaque. The object does more than simply “kick back” against human intent; it also hides characteristics within that have yet to be expressed in ontological encounters that exceed human intent. Once Bogost establishes the ontological opacity of things, he continues to characterize alien encounters as also instances of ontological entanglement.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s04">
         <title>Udon Noodles</title>
         <p>Bogost offers another culinary image to characterize the black noise of things or the density of beings that is unavailable to us. We can only see specific incarnations or facets of an encounter. Here he speculates on the complex life of an udon noodle and writes, “Only some portion of the domain of being is obvious to any given object at a particular time. For the udon noodle, the being of the soup bowl does not intersect with the commercial transaction through which the noodle house sells it, or the social conventions according to which the eater slurps it. Yet there is no reason to believe that the entanglement in which the noodle finds itself is any less complex than the human who shapes, boils, vends, consumes, or digests it.”<sup>8</sup> Bogost's description elicits a richness of being that a human-centered perspective would collapse into a bowl of udon noodles waiting to be consumed and be rendered meaningful. Instead, he invites us to imagine the complexity of noodle entanglement, as it is shaped from flour, shipped, boiled, covered, and eaten, how the noodle encounters the hot water or cold bowl. The OOO perspective opens our curiosity to follow the noodle along its journey, all the while admitting its epistemological resistance to conceptual subsumption or idealism.</p>
         <p>Industrial designer Raymond Loewy's hugely successful 1934 Sears Coldspot Super Six helped establish the commercial value of industrial design in America by increasing profit by 400 percent. Much praise was given the new, sleek unified body of the refrigerator, which offered an aesthetic of easy-to-clean, smooth, white surfaces that spoke to the 1930s vision of a streamlined future. While Loewy was designing the refrigerator, he was also busy designing a car that utilized the new material aluminum for its front grille. The serendipitous simultaneity of design projects yielded his use of aluminum in the refrigerator. It resisted rust and consequently supported the clean look. The alien encounter with metal that does not rust prompted Loewy's curiosity and new applications. The initial awe gave way to the designer's motivation, much like Kahn's sensitivity to the demand of construction material brought the brick into alignment with his own motivation. Lucy Kimbell was alluding to this innate designer fascination with materiality in justifying the resonance between object-oriented ontology and user-centered design. Modulating Kimbell's insight, Harman pointed out the resistance to idealism that made design open to an object orientation. Bogost's udon noodle, in its complexity and the richness of its existence, emphasizes material resistance to clean categories. He explains, “Instead of worshipping simplicity, OOO embraces messiness. We must not confuse the values of the design of objects for human use, such as doors, toasters, and computers, with the nature of the world itself. An ontograph is a crowd, not a cellular automation that might describe its emergent operation. An ontograph is a landfill, not a Japanese garden. It shows how much rather than how little exists simultaneously, suspended in the dense meanwhile of being.”<sup>9</sup> Where an object-oriented ontologist will see a fuzzy haze of ontographs or a landfill, a designer will project a focused articulation of shapes or a Japanese garden. Bogost warns that we must not confuse the values of an object orientation with a user orientation.</p>

         <title>Alton Brown's Pound Cake Recipe</title>
         <p>The trenches between OOO and design seem too deep for us to even imagine the edges. If things are opaque beyond our understanding and what we do understand is only one facet of a complex dense being buffered by black noise, then how can we characterize the encounter of things with each other or with us? At this point of epistemological loss, Bogost offers speculative realism and a direction for philosophers, stating,
<disp-quote>
               <p>Speculative realism really does <italic>require</italic> speculation: benighted meandering in an exotic world of utterly incomprehensible objects. As philosophers, our job is to amplify the black noise of objects to make the resonant frequencies of the stuffs inside them hum in credibly satisfying ways. Our job is to write the speculative fictions of their processes, of their unit operations. Our job is to get our hands dirty with grease, juice, gunpowder, and gypsum. Our job is to go where <italic>everyone</italic> has gone before, but where few have bothered to linger.</p>
               <p>I call this practice <italic>alien phenomenology</italic>.<sup>10</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>
We make considered guesses, we speculate, we imagine. For Bogost ontographs, lists, metaphorism, and carpentry are strategies of alien phenomenology.</p>
         <p>Carpentry is the practice of tracing the effects of things on other things and imagining the surface black noise as it relates to the density of each thing's interior. As such, carpentry is the name Bogost gives to this double accounting of a thing with its surrounding and a thing within its interiority. We account for this ontological depth through specific metaphors. For example, the visual experience of a bat is like the sonar of a submarine. Bogost returns to a culinary comparison in identifying ontological wonder by referencing Charm City Cakes and Alton Brown's recipes. The show <italic>Ace of Cakes</italic> focuses on the human drama; in contrast, Bogost argues that Alton Brown, on the show <italic>Good Eats</italic>, attends to the specificity and complexity of ingredients. In doing so, Brown is engaged in alien phenomenology. For Bogost,
<disp-quote>
               <p>Brown's cakery embraces tiny ontology. The cake exists, to be sure. So does the Kitchen-Aid 5-Quart Stand Mixer, the preheated oven, the mixing bowl, and the awaiting gullet. But so too do the sugars, the flour granules, the butterfat crystals, the leavener, the gas bubbles. And they do not merely <italic>exist</italic>—they exist <italic>equally</italic>, and <italic>Good Eats</italic> proves that flat existence entails <italic>equal levels of potential worth</italic>. The relationship between fat crystal and sugar, leavener and batter is just as fundamental as that between cake and mouth. The dispersion of gases that rises is surely interesting and useful as it relates to the end product (a light and fluffy cake), but <italic>Good Eats</italic> also presents the gas bubbles and the flour granules as <italic>their own</italic> end product, worthy of consideration, scrutiny, and even awe.<sup>11</sup>

            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>This culinary moment is significant for design disciplines. It shows the capacity of attentive construction processes to promote an object orientation. Alton Brown's pound cake recipe acknowledges both roasted green chiles as an instance of opaque being and udon noodles as an instance of dense and complex being. Design that considers the opacity, complexity, and process of things can maintain at least a partial object orientation. Bogost's culinary examples together speculate on the character of object black noise that approaches silence.</p>
         <p>A <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic> review entitled “A Designing Woman with Radical Ideas: April Greiman Says Her Graphics Style Is ‘an Experiment in Creating “Hybrid Imagery”’ described the graphic artist and her work as follows:
<disp-quote>
               <p>When designer April Greiman's poster “Does It Make Sense” appeared in fall 1986, it was alternately hailed as a radical advance in the art of poster design and condemned as pornographic, self-indulgent and inappropriate.</p>
               <p>A life-size, nude fold-out of herself, digitized into an array of computer pixels—the microscopic spots of light that make up computer images—“Does It Make Sense” displays Greiman's naked body adorned with the graffiti of scientific symbols and photographs of exploding supernova.</p>
               <p>A brontosaurus, reproduced from a TV image, roams the figure's groin. A hand holding a crystal ball sprouts from her head. A printed border exhorts the viewer to “dance, make sounds, feel, don't worry, be happy.”</p>
               <p>Commissioned for the Minneapolis Walker Art Center Design Quarterly, the poster epitomizes Greiman's innovative bridge between art and technology.</p>
               <p>She describes her style, which epitomizes the 1980s California New Wave in graphic design, as “an experiment in creating ‘hybrid imagery.’”</p>
               <p>“At the heart of the concept of hybrid imagery is a recognition that, in inventing new technologies, we reinvent ourselves,” Greiman explained. “In the end, we can never be sure of who is creating who.”<sup>12</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>
Amid the conceptual analysis we find an isolated paragraph listing visual elements that seem to escape narrative cohesion, such as a brontosaurus, a hand holding a crystal ball, and textual fragments. The visual construction exposed the new and early technology of MacDraw and the wonders of digital technology against bitmaps. The representation of a new process of construction not only prompted a new graphic form of “hybrid imagery” but also, and more important for my argument, speculated on an alien encounter that gave equal attention to text, brontosaurus, crystal ball, moonrise, time line, bitmaps, breasts, hair, and so on.</p>
         <p>An anthropocentric interpretation of the image would only yield a description of a nude self-portrait by the designer, pornographic and self-indulgent, just as one can view Alton Brown's pound cake recipe as merely an expression of gluttony. However, in both cases details are treated not as parts of a whole but as deserving of equal attention in their own right. This curiosity about things independent of their relation to the human narrative amplifies the black noise of things jostling against each other in active existence. The nude human figure or the deliciousness of the cake certainly denotes user-centrism (a priority of human intent and use), yet both appear alongside and against object encounters. Bogost calls this action of “constructing artifacts as a philosophical practice” and amplifying black noise carpentry. He summarizes, “The carpenter, by contrast (to philosophical writing), must contend with the material resistance of his or her chosen form, making the object itself become the philosophy.”<sup>13</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The dense aggregation of things reveals that the trench or fissure between design and philosophy is anything but. Rather, as things are packed together in an uncomfortable contest of being, we can also consider academic disciplines as packed together and jostling to disconnect, to relate, and to speculate. The perspectives of object orientation or user orientation are manifestations, like Heidegger's simultaneous ready-to-hand and present-at-hand interpretations of object meaning. Instead of a correspondence with an idea, things demand attention to the simultaneity of existents: for Bogost, the “meanwhile.” <italic>Interdisciplinarity</italic> may be the wrong term. Perhaps we should consider the coincidence of philosophy and design in moments of Alton Brown's pound cake recipe style as carpentry. Bogost identifies practice as theory in terms of hyphenated job descriptions: the philosopher-chef, the philosopher-astronomer, the philosopher-mechanic, and such. Lucy Kimbell's suggestion that the moment of inversion between object orientation and user orientation is, following Bogost, a moment of concurrence, a flash of recognition, when the gas bubbles have simultaneous and equivalent being as a tasty fluffy cake. Returning to this essay's argument strategy inspired by <italic>Chopped</italic>, let us account for this imagined meal.</p>

Another example Bogost suggests is the road to Hana in Maui as both a destination and a process. Our encounters with things may well be driven by human motivation, but the journey noting our entanglement with things and things with each other propels us into the realm of hyperreality, magical realism, and speculative philosophy.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="s08_2">
            <title>b. Interdisciplinarity Interpreted Through OOO</title>
            <p>Engaging in an interdisciplinary confrontation requires a leap of imagination, as well as an acceptance of opacity and a hybridity. In the encounter we lose the structure that frames any given discipline. Lacking rational support we can only depend on speculation, imagination, and curiosity about what the offspring of two currents of existence might reveal. No truth as correspondence or corroboration can be expected in interdisciplinary research. Philosophy does not justify design, or vice versa, just as the gas bubbles do not alone justify the existence of a tasty fluffy cake. The connection between cake and gas bubbles is not causal but, rather, speculative.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, Louis Kahn, Raymond Loewy, and April Greiman designed, made, wrote, and spoke through their encounters with things as alien phenomenology. In <italic>Alien Phenomenology, or What It's like to Be a Thing</italic>, Bogost urges philosophers to go beyond writing, as he does by arranging conferences, designing promotional Web sites, engaging in digital experiments, and the like. We, as another thing in existence, among other things are an aggregate of competing actions and motivations that fuel the “black noise” of nonhuman objects. The difference between the human and the nonhuman is not ontological but epistemological. Speculative realism addresses this gap. We as ontological carpenters can make out the silence of objects, as Kahn, Loewy, and Greiman had. This call to speak to the approaching silence of things and amplify black noise is the challenge of design that is both object-oriented and user-centered. The arrival of Graham Harman's object-oriented ontology onto the topography of design studies is yet another alien encounter worthy of awe, wonder, and speculation.</p>
