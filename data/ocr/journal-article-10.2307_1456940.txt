<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JOURNAL OF BIBLE AND RELIGION Vol. XVIII April, 195o No. 2 The Bridge of Understanding S. VERNON McCASLAND* N MY first years of teaching as a new doctor of philosophy I had much in com- mon with Don Quixote riding forth as a valiant knight to do battle with windmills. It seemed highly important in those days to seek out all the restricting chains of the old orthodoxy which shackled my students and break them, but with the years I have come to see that an unenlightened faith is far better than no faith, and my policy has long since become a positive effort to build on the old foundation. It is usually possible to rear upon the base thus preserved a house of faith which serves as a comfortable residence for the soul and at the same time incorporates enough of the modem lines to make it fit harmoniously into the intellectual landscape of its time. A DANGEROUS OPPORTUNITY But that going to college should and does usually bring about important modifications of one's religious faith goes without saying. Ideas of religion, like everything that goes to make up the assorted furniture with which the house of the mind is equipped, are sub- jected to the possibility and likelihood of change when one goes to college. It is contrary to the character of the mind itself to assume that religious faith can remain static, while concepts about most of the other vital areas of knowledge and experience are being ac- quired, expanded, or radically altered. College life is a dangerous opportunity. It is not un- usual to hear the complaint that students lose their faith at college, and this is, in fact, sometimes true. They lose faith in God as well as their standards of morality. Loss of the latter not infrequently follows loss of the for- mer. What I have in mind is a school where real freedom exists, where students face every type of thought about politics, morality, and religion that has come from the mind of man. The curriculum of a real college is planned less for the purpose of careful indoctrination in a particular faith than to stimulate the intellec- tual development of students by bringing them face-to-face with every faith. The very real possibility of the distintegration of personality and moral character always inherent in a free college atmosphere emphasizes the importance of a wise program for the selection and guid- ance of college young people. Our colleges suffer at the present time from the results of a pernicious but appealing popular idea that all young people should be sent to college. The student who takes his place in a college classroom is in a position similar enough to that of a patient on an operating table under a surgeon's knife, to make the parallel disturb- ing. The patient's recovery depends on the surgeon's skill, but also, and very greatly, upon his own resources, not to mention the grace of God. Every professor who carries the welfare of students on his conscience under- stands this, but, like the specialist who per- forms the major surgery, the professor of re- ligion should feel it most. As he analyzes and interprets religion, especially the religion of the Bible, he knows that he is operating on the vital organs of his patient, and that in his hands are instruments which are able to kill as well as to cure. * John B.

VERNON McCASLAND RELIGION IS PRIOR TO THE BIBLE The Bible is a book about the religion of Jews, on the one hand, and of Christians, on the other. We are interested in the Bible as a source-book for the study of ancient history, and we admire the beauty of much of its literature, but neither the history nor the liter- ature of the Bible should be the primary con- cern of the professor who teaches religion to undergraduates. Naturally he must know not only the history of the ancient world, especially that which is connected with the Bible, but also the literary character of the Bible in re- lation to other literatures of the world, to English in particular. However, a professor can be an authority in both of these fields and teach them expertly, but if this is as far as he goes, he has not discharged his main responsi- bility as a teacher of religion. The Bible is important for history, literature, and its reflec- tions of the ideas of the ancient Hebrews about science, but it is primarily a book of religion. Moreover, the Bible is secondary to that re- ligion. The religion itself existed first, in the rich and colorful experience of Hebrews and Christians, as a living awareness of the pre- sence and power of God both in the external world of nature and in the inner life of man. This awareness of God was so natural for Hebrews and Christians that it could almost be regarded as instinctive. It was like our con- cept of universal law, which, in a general sense, would not be questioned by the average person of our time. Indeed, our concept of law is probably little more than the depersonalized and devitalized residue of the ancient faith in God. One can read the Bible through without finding a serious effort to prove the existence of God, who was accepted as readily then as is the law of gravitation now. It is interesting to speculate about the origin of this ancient idea, but the biblical view is that it came by the various processes of revelation by means of which God makes himself known to man. At any rate, the first responsibility of the pro- fessor of religion is to lead his students as far as is humanly possible into an understanding of this biblical apprehension of the nature and meaning of the world in which we live, of human personality, of the society of men, and of the history of nations. This leads us into what I consider the most basic insight into what occurs when a professor of religion really achieves his goal with a stu- dent. If any residue of wisdom can be distilled from my somewhat more than thirty years of teaching it is just this: the process of learning is consummated whenever a student realizes for the first time that a connecting bridge of understand- ing has been laid between his own life and ex- perience and the life and thought, either ancient or contemporary,.which he is studying. In other words, when he wakes up to the fact that what he is studying about could and does take place in his own experience here and now, the student has taken his first step in the way of under- standing. Although the various scriptures of the world have an extraordinary antiquarian interest, the professor of religion must not con- fine his interest to their value as museum pieces. LITERARY BARRIERS The function of the teacher is to break down and remove barriers of whatever kind which keep the bridge of understanding from being laid. These barriers are of the most diverse types. They involve language, vocabulary, idi- oms, symbols, customs, different social sys- tems, and the most baffling conceptions of psychology, philosophy and theology. The re- moval of these barriers may be exceedingly difficult; for some students the bridge across the deepest and widest chasms may never be laid, as the learning process presupposes certain intellectual qualifications; but the success of the effort depends very largely upon the intel- lectual penetration and spiritual insight of the professor himself, with reference to the student as well as to the subject. When he sees compre- hension dawn, he knows that the bridge has been laid. One of the first requirements for an under- standing of the Bible is ability to recognize figures of speech when they are encountered. Many of the biblical writers were masters in the use of the paradox, metaphor, simile, hy-</page><page sequence="3">THE BRIDGE OF UNDERSTANDING 93 perbole, metonym and most of the other figura- tive rhetorical devices which have been used to adorn good literature all through the ages. One reason for the great amount of symbolical and figurative expression in the Bible is the fondness of gifted writers for colorful language, but there is also the fact that abstract ideas about God and the spiritual world can never be given the kind of concrete, descriptive ex- pression which we associate with science, but at most can only be suggested in symbols. The degree of understanding attained by the reader depends on his ability to begin with the symbol and to use it as a means of advancing into the area of knowledge into which the author seeks to lead him. Gross confusion of mind always results for those who fail to recognize the figurative expression and try to interpret it in prosaic, scientific terms. When Amos said The Lord will roar from Zion, And utter his voice from Jerusalem; And the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, And the top of Carmel shall wither, (1:2) he did not pause to explain his metaphors in matter-of-fact words, but assumed that his hearers would immediately be gripped by his picturesque figures and held under their spell until the message of doom was burned into their understanding. In a similar way he ex- pected them to comprehend and never forget the arresting lines of his exquisite lament, The virgin of Israel is fallen; She shall no more rise: She is forsaken upon her land; There is none to raise her up. (5:2) Isaiah knew that the people of Judah would understand his accusing metaphors when he said Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom; Give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomor- rah. (1:10) The world has never been able to forget the haunting similes of Jeremiah in the lines which are the original expression of our idea of the Grim Reaper: Even the carcasses of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, And as the handful after the harvestman, And none shall gather them. (9:22) In the following transparent figures the great poet of the Exile has given us the unforgettable conception of the Good Shepherd: He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: He shall gather the lambs with his arm, And carry them in his bosom, And gently lead those that are with young. (Isa. 40:11) The greatest master of forceful language in the Bible was Jesus, who has hardly left a say- ing which does not use a penetrating figure of some kind. No better examples of this can be found than his words about loving and hating people. He said, If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his life also, he cannot be my disciple. (Lk. 14:26) Only the person who recognizes that this hard saying is an hyperbole can penetrate into its profound meaning. The same is to be observed in regard to the difficult sayings about "turn- ing the other cheek" and "loving your ene- mies" (Matt. 5: 39, 44). Literalists take these powerful hyperboles and turn them into impos- sible rules of conduct. The paradoxes of Jesus must also be read with insight, as, for example, Think not that I came to send peace on the earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. (Matt. 10:34) In no other respect do literalists get into greater difficulty than in interpreting the vari- ous figures applied to God. Even in the Old Testament Father had been applied to God to express his relationship with the Hebrews in various connections. In the New Testament Father has become a standard metonym. It is the Christian's favorite way of addressing God. But to apply Father to God in a literal sense, implying that God belongs to the male sex, with a capacity, desire and need of sexual ex- pression like a human male, is objectionable anthropomorphism; it is to introduce a biologi- cal concept into our idea of Deity which is utterly inadmissable. To think of God as a</page><page sequence="4">94 S. VERNON McCASLAND literal Father would require us also to postulate a divine Mother, who would be his wife, the mere mention of which is enough to indicate that a literal view can never grasp the meaning which this metonym carries. Except in a figura- tive sense, and as an inevitable corollary of the dominance of men in the social and intellectual life of biblical times, it is difficult to see how God could be associated exclusively with either the male or the female sex. If God has no wife, then it is also clear that the familiar phrase "son of God," which in the Old Testament refers to angels, or the king, or the nation, or an individual Hebrew, and in the New Testament is applied to the individual Christian as well as to Christ, cannot be taken in a literal or biological sense. The same may be said, moreover, of "the new birth," which the Gospel of John uses so effectively, and "adop- tion," the term which Paul uses to indicate how men become sons of God. It is clear that all these expressions, which are drawn from the powerful affections of family life, are metaphors which attempt to express in the most signifi- cant symbols of human experience something of the sense of security and the new quality of meaning which enrich the life of a person who has come to believe in an omnipotent, gracious God. The ancient authors had their own char- acteristic modes of expression. Not inhibited by the ideas of exactness and precision of statement which science has fastened like a millstone about the necks of modern authors the writers of antiquity were less obliged to make a habit of using colorless prose. Allowing free rein to the natural fondness for pictur- esqueness of expression, they knew how to de- light their hearers and readers with arresting figures and striking symbols which gave wings to the imagination. The scriptures of all the great religions were written long before the dawn of science which has so effectively closed the windows of our minds. The new type of thought has brought into disrepute the ancient folklores with their fanciful but symbolical legends, fables and myths, so that the average reader in our time has not only acquired a distaste for these old forms of expression, but finds them as unintelligible in their profound insights as would be a strange foreign language which he had never studied. He not only fails to understand, he misunderstands the old literatures and attributes to them meanings of which their authors never dreamed. PHILOSOPHY OF THE LEARNING PROCESS Underlying my philosophy of the learning experience are certain assumptions, which I believe to be universally valid, in regard to man, the world and God. I tell my students that it is reasonable to believe that, although the customs and habits of men have changed greatly through the ages, human nature itself has remained essentially the same; that God has not changed, that he is not altered by time; and that the natural world, although it has undergone certain geological modifications since recorded history began, is still the same world in which our primitive ancestors lived. One is justified in assuming, therefore, that in general terms there has been little change be- tween the fundamental things which happened or might happen then and those which happen or might happen now; that is, that whatever happened in human experience then might be expected to occur now, if our spiritual eyes and understanding were only keen enough to dis- cern and recognize it. Discernment is prevented by the barriers which lie between. One of the major obstacles, as noted above, is the bizarre and fantastic character of the symbolical modes of expression used by the ancients, which the modern reader attempts to take in a literal sense and so misunderstands. So he fails to grasp what happened to the man of antiquity about whom he is reading. Because of its un- earthly character, the reader assumes that al- though such an incident may once have oc- curred, it could never happen to him. On the other hand, since he is accustomed to look out upon the world through the monochrome lenses which modern science has fastened upon us all and to describe his experience with its de- vitalized vocabulary, it does not occur to him that his own experience is or may be essentially identical with that about which he reads in the ancient classics. One task of the teacher is to</page><page sequence="5">THE BRIDGE OF UNDERSTANDING 95 open the eyes of a student to what happened then; a second is to discover to him what is happening now; and a third is to show that the world in which we live, in spite of the obscurity introduced by the specious clarity of science, still offers to man today all the resources for spiritual life that it ever did. The only impor- tant change between then and now has not been in God, or the world itself, or even in man, but in man's ideas and vocabulary--in the way in which he interprets the same phenomena of the spiritual life which have been occurring ever since the race of man began. This is a new and startling idea to many persons, and I do not mean to suggest that all of my students grasp it fully and see its full implications for the religious life, but to an in- creasing number of them it brings release from much of the frustration they feel because of the spiritual dryness which they have been led to assume must be characteristic of their lives. Odd and unacademic as it may sound, one of the most effective ways for a student to cross the bridge of understanding in religion is to go to church, especially his own, which I always encourage my students to do. It is remarkable how many young people never attend church, have rarely been inside a church building in their lives. Hence they are almost totally il- literate in a religious sense, without apprecia- tion of the art, music, literature and symbols of religion, not to mention the place of faith in a man's life, and with no idea of the meaning of the symbolical drama enacted in every church service. Some students come to college with well established habits of church attendance. They are most fortunate if they do not lose this loyalty to their faith in college. A good many tragedies occur at this point because of the immaturity of the student, who is too easily influenced by the paganism of his fellows, on the one hand, and the reckless irresponsi- bility of some instructors, on the other. It is well known that most students have some difficulty in integrating what little religious faith they have with the new ideas they acquire at college or university, but this is probably unavoidable as they are attempting to pass through their intellectual adolescence into man- hood. This is the time, above all others, when they ought to go to church. Even if they cannot for the time being synthesize the church's theology with what they conceive to be the philosophy of the university, I point out that the most important values of life have never been fully rationalized and can be expressed only in symbols. Therefore I urge them to allow the symbols of religion to continue to speak to their souls, if only through esthetic channels, even while the mind still gropes for under- standing. Sometimes I illustrate this point with a little parable drawn from an achievement of the Illinois Central Railroad while I was a student in the University of Chicago many years ago. This road carried an enormous amount of traffic into the city over tracks not far from the university, but the company dis- covered that the old roadbed had become in- adequate for the traffic. Hence they were plunged into the problem of rebuilding their road at the same time that they kept the traffic rolling. It was fascinating to observe how the engineers and construction men, by means of a set of temporary tracks, were able to re- build the roadbed completely and lay new steel, while throughout the entire operation, which lasted for several months, they kept all trains running on schedule. A PROFESSOR's REWARD A surprisingly large number of students are hungry in our time for what Jesus in a fitting metaphor called the bread of life. They are anxious to discover a light in the dark labyrinth through which they are passing. They ap- preciate a sympathetic, intelligent discussion of their problems. They respond to the assur- ance that there are real standards of right and wrong and that the decalogue is just as true as it ever was. No experience in life is more re- warding than to observe a new light come into the eyes of a student as you show him that faith in God is not only a reassuring and inspiring philosophy of life, but that it is also a reason- able view, based on the kind of rational evi- dence that an honest and intelligent man can accept.</page></plain_text>
