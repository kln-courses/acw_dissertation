<plain_text><page sequence="1">Marcel Muller The Rhetoric of Pseudo-Nature: Or, Tropes and Dialectic in Proust's Novel We all know how important metaphor is in Remembrance of Things Past, not only through explicit statements made by the narrator about the virtues of this trope, but also through the ways it is found embedded in the actual fabric of the novel. One of the most salient features of the commentaries inspired (directly or indirectly) by Jakobsonian rhetoric, however, has been the claim that the image does not enjoy as exclusive a place in this novel as the fictitious "I" would have it and as had been accepted previously. More specifically, recent critics have referred to what they perceive as the métonymie tendency of Proustian discourse. Readers as different as Gérard Genette, Jean- Pierre Richard, and Paul de Man have tended to agree on the thesis that contiguity plays an underestimated role in the universe of Proust. The present article seeks to rehabilitate the narrator's own thesis of the primacy of analogy, a thesis endorsed by his readers up until Genette's 1970 article in Poétique, but it situates this primacy in a complex system accom- modating not only metaphor but also the other tropes, ascribing the latter a subordinate role. The rhetorical point of departure of this enterprise is provided by Roman Jakobson's fundamental distinction between metaphor and me- tonymy; however, while this dichotomy is essential to our understanding of tropes, I find it imperative to reintroduce the other figures put aside in a somewhat cavalier fashion by the author of "Closing Statement" and work with a complete inventory such as the one established by Heinrich Lausberg: metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, emphasis, hyperbole, antonomasia, peri- phrasis, litotes, and irony (282-307). As for the dialectic, it is the one usually evoked by that name, as defined by Rousseau and Kant, and whose consti- tutional categories are nature, culture, and their reconciliation. As a background to a statement on the rhetoric of pseudo-nature, let us examine what is meant by the tropological expression of the opposition be- tween nature and culture, and let us start with the former of these two mo- dalities, which is best represented in Remembrance of Things Past by some utterances of Françoise. Quasi-illiterate and therefore as close to the living word as she is to the nourishing earth, the servant predictably functions as the voice of nature, and her instrument of expression is metaphor. Under her gaze, the white clouds floating in the blue sky become "a lot of dogfish swimming about and sticking up their snouts" (1: 180).' No one could be more different from Françoise than Norpois, who is associated with the institutions of society. Metonymy and synecdoche are his Style: Volume 22, No. 3, Fall 1988 382</page><page sequence="2">Tropes and Dialectic 383 favorite means of expression: in his monologues, the governments or ministries of foreign affairs of different European states are automatically (this adverb is used here to allude to Henri Bergson's views on the comic) designated by phrases such as "the Wilhelmstrasse" or "the Quai d'Orsay" (1: 497, 498; 1: 461, 462), which makes his conversation sound like an echo of the articles he writes: ... it sufficed that M. de Norpois should write at a suitable point (as he never failed to do): "The Court of St. James was not the last to be sensible to the peril," or "Feeling ran high on the Singers' Bridge, where the selfish but skilful policy of the Dual Monarchy was being followed with anxious eyes," or "A cry of alarm sounded from Montecitorio," or yet again, "That perpetual double dealing which is so characteristic of the Ballplatz." By these expressions the lay reader had at once recognised and acknowledged the career diplomat.2 (1: 498; 1: 462) Norpois also displays a strong predilection for antonomasia and periphrasis. He uses the language of the "media" of his time: Le temps , Le journal des débats, and the monthly Revue des deux-mondes (a periodical to which he himself contributes). His discourse is riddled with clichés, and these are pre- dominantly métonymie: what he likes in these tropes is that, based as they are upon contiguity, they imply contingency; they are also coded, lexicalized fig- ures, as narrowly predefined by conventions as the whole behavior of the dipomat. In short, to borrow a phrase used by the grandmother about Le- grandin, he speaks like a book. (I will return on the convergence between the ambassador and the effete poet a little later.) Very different in this respect is the narrator's language, which can be called métonymie (and many of the critics with whom I take issue have called it that) only if one insists upon interpreting diegetic images as reflecting the triumph of proximity over analogy and not as operating a zionist reintegration of elements threatened with dispersal and saved by the embracing gesture of comparison. Not that metonymies in the strict sense of the term are absent from the narrator's discourse, but the extremely rare occurrences of this figure are a perfect illustration of the proverb, the exception proves the rule, for they appear in episodes involving failure or disappointment. The most eloquent example of this is the passage in which Gilberte and the Hero fight for the letter sent to her father, in the course of which fight the adolescent, at the peak of sexual excitement, spreads what is decorously and metonymically called his "pleasure" (1: 532; 1: 494). Or again, a metonymy may be used by the narrator, but clearly marked as a borrowing from a character associated with culture as in the following example where Brichot is the culprit. The passage provides an unusually clear (almost pedagogical) manifestation of the dialectic process by which Proust moves through metonymy to metaphor, thus reaching a level which is both superior to that of the digital tropes and to that of the unmediated image of Françoise. In this case the process unfolds in two codes: the rhetorical</page><page sequence="3">384 Marcel Muller one, which involves the noun plume ("pen" or "nib"), and the thematic one, playing on the referent denoted by the sign: Admittedly the "pen" of George Sand, to borrow a phrase from Brichot, who was so fond of saying that a book was written with a "lively pen," no longer seemed to me, as for so long it had seemed to my mother before she had gradually come to model her literary tastes upon mine, in the least a magic pen. But it was a pen which, unintentionally, like a schoolboy amusing himself with a real pen, I had charged with electricity, and now a thousand trifling details of Combray which for years had not entered my mind came lightly and spontaneously leaping, in follow-my-leader fashion, to suspend themselves from the magnetised nib in an interminable and trembling chain of memories. (3: 920; 3: 994) The metaphorical use of a noun having first functioned as a metonymy and the allusion to magnetism go hand in hand, for the phenomenon which pro- vides the vehicle of the image is one which appeals to our imagination and is easily interpreted as caused by some mysterious force. Magnetism and what I. A. Richards called the "interaction" of metaphor must be seen as related; the purpose or the effect of both is to go beyond a negative stage of dialectic, respectively the mechanistic relationship between two masses in Newtonian physics and the association by sheer contiguity in rhetoric. These considerations define the coordinates and present the essential points of the total project, in the context of which I situate the problem of the rhetoric of "pseudo-nature." In order to understand what is meant by this phrase, one must introduce a complication into the dialectic process as it is defined above. Two very important categories of Proustian characters and their correlative rhetorical modes will be identified when we recognize the relevance of a historical phenomenon which occurred in the way the relationship between nature and culture was defined after the year 1830. "Sir, come and drink the milk of our cows," wrote Voltaire, then settled not far from the Alps, to Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who had become a Parisian. Voltaire had just read his correspondent's First Discourse. The sarcasm re- flected a serious misunderstanding on Voltaire's part, for the author of the essay had not envisaged the possibility of returning to an original, unpolluted form of nature. What he had in mind was of course a reconciliation between the "Bon Sauvage" and what he called "l'Homme Policé." Though Voltaire's gibe was misplaced when applied to Rousseau's thinking, it would certainly have been germane to the thoughts of a number of writers who, half a century later, would be seized by a nostalgia for the inviolability of nature, as the development of technology, coupled with the appearance of a new actor on the stage of history, the crowd, brought forth a new French type called "l'Art- iste." Later, in England, he would appear as "the Aesthete," and later still, again in France, as "le Décadent." A religion of nature was to develop in the nineteenth century, which would really deserve Voltaire's sarcasm: "Come and drink the milk of our cows." When in Gilbert and Sullivan's Patience (dated 1881), the Aesthete appears with the caricatural name of Bunthorne, we find</page><page sequence="4">Tropes and Dialectic 385 Voltaire's irony applicable quite literally, for this "aesthetic sham" (as Bun- thorne calls himself), "the man of culture rare" who longs "for all one sees / that's Japanese" (199), is attracted to a milkmaid. How could one forget that in Proust's world too, the protagonist (caught at times in the same predicament as the decadent characters of the novel) also feels strongly attracted to milk- maids in the course of his trip to Balbec? The cult of nature! What an oxy- moron! And yet this is precisely the dream pursued by many people between 1 830 and the moment when the young Proust begins to write. It was just such people who would be resurrected in the form of characters in his novel. Swann, the most notable example, is in love with "a young seamstress, as fresh and plump as a rose" (1: 237; 1: 218), a variant, of course, on the milkmaid. Such characters turn their backs to the city: their refuge is Combray or Balbec, where the cliffs offer a convenient site from which Legrandin, for example, can daydream while looking at the sunset, close to the fishermen who have remained unchanged since time immemorial. This is not to say that Legrandin for his part (contrary to what he may think) can be aligned with someone like Françoise. The Decadent's sense of rusticity is spurious: his love of nature is that of the hypercivilized reader of literature. His rhetoric is there- fore inauthentic. We can expect to find him using metonymies and synecdoches like Norpois, and indeed we catch him saying: "I am a Jacobinical head,"3 when he claims to be hostile to the aristocracy. Totally mendacious, the claim is voiced in the language of the nonmetaphorical trope, as it should be ac- cording to Proust's values. But Legrandin is also capable of using images, as when he looks at the sky and expresses himself just as Françoise does: the blue tint of a cloud which he proposes to the admiration of the Hero's father is "more floral than aerial, a cineraria blue, which it is suprising to see in the sky" while a little pink cloud is said to have "the tint of some flower, a carnation or hydrangea." It is in this context that he will evoke the only other example known to him of a "vegetable kingdom of the atmosphere" which is to be found in the sky of Balbec: In that moist and gentle atsmosphere, these celestial bouquets, pink and blue, will blossom all at once of an evening, incomparably lovely, and often lasting for hours before they fade. Others shed their flowers at once, and then it is lovelier still to see the sky strewn with their unnatural petals, sulphur or rose-pink. (1: 142; 1: 130) Imagery just like that of Françoise? Well, not quite, of course, for while her use of images is the immediate expression of the illiterate peasant, Legrandin's rhetoric is self-conscious and exacerbated.4 It is no coincidence if this descrip- tion elicits on the interlocutor's part a very practical question prompted by the desire to give the grandmother a useful address should she feel the need to contact someone while vacationing in the area where Legrandin seems to be at home. This circumstance allows Proust to introduce the degree zero of rhetoric characteristic of the father's literal-mindedness, in which the reader</page><page sequence="5">386 Marcel Muller must see an inverted (and thus symmetrical) form of perversion: the bourgeois is neither more nor less alienated than the artist. The more pressing the father will be with his indiscreet questions, the more elusive (that is, the more met- aphorical) Legrandin waxes. "I have friends wherever there are clusters of trees, stricken but not defeated, which have come together with touching persever- ance to offer a common supplication to an inclement sky which has no mercy upon them"; and . . the places themselves seem like people" (1: 143; 1: 131- 32). Legrandin's anthropomorphic view of nature must remind us of Fran- çoise's: "Ah, they never think of making it rain a little for the poor labourers! And then when the corn is all ripe, down it will come, pitter-patter all over the place, and think no more of where it's falling than if it was the sea!" (1: 180; 1: 165). But this should not be read as the sign of a convergence between the poet and the servant; to the contrary, the reader is invited to measure the difference between genuine compassion and its ostentatious counterpart. Sim- ilarly, the diametrical opposition between Legrandin and the father, rather than interpreted as presenting an irreconcilable difference between two styles, must be read as the dual translation into two parallel registers of the spurious use of language: on one hand, the inability to recognize figurative language; on the other, the abuse of metaphors. Legrandin's behavior is imputable to his snobbishness: he is determined to prevent a commoner from meeting Mme de Cambremer, née Legrandin. In consonance with his rejection of social mo- bility (at least where someone other than himself is concerned), his metaphors, though by definition based on interaction, are meant to sever their user from the ordinary mortals (somehow in the same way that Robespierre- to whose guillotine a secret allusion has been made under the innocent guise of the adjective "Jacobinical"- separates the King's head from his body). The met- aphor of this make-believe egalitarian is a Faubourg Saint-Germain of rhetoric, not the open community of signifieds it is supposed to be, and as such it is a thinly disguised metonymy. I could pursue this demonstration by examining the language of the other Decadents of the novel (Swann, Charlus, and Bloch). But just as Norpois (to whom we have added the father) sufficed as representative of the rhetoric of culture, the poet-engineer's means of expression are typical enough to exem- plify the language of the pseudo-nature of the Artist throughout the novel. I say "the pseudo-nature of the Artist," for there is also another. The following text by Paul Bourget (taken from his essay on Baudelaire in Essais de psy- chologie contemporaine of 1881, which, incidentally, is the same year in which the publication of Patience occurred) will be useful at this point: Citizens of decadent societies may well be inferior artisans of the greatness of their country, but are they not superior as artists of the inner world of the soul? Though they are inept at private and public action, are they not overly skilled at solitary meditation? Though poor reproducers of future generations, are they not gifted with an abundance of fine sensations and a store of rare and exquisite feelings which have made them refined, albeit sterile</page><page sequence="6">Tropes and Dialectic 387 virtuosi of voluptuousness and suffering? ... A Germanic chief in the second century was certainly more capable of invading the Roman Empire than a Roman patrician was of defending it; but a well-schooled, refined Roman, one who was inquisitive and disillusioned like for example the Emperor Hadrian, . . . represented an even greater treasure of human wealth. The great argument against decadent societies is that they have no future and that some barbarian force always crushes them. But isn't it the fatal lot of those who are exquisite and rare to confess to a sin of this sort and to prefer the defeat of decadent Athens to the triumph of a violent Macedonia?5 (16-17) Those described here as "inept at private and public action" and as "poor reproducers of future generations," those characterized as enjoying "an abun- dance of refined sensations and an exquisiteness of rare emotions," have names familiar to the readers of Proust: Swann, Legrandin, Charlus, and Bloch. What about "the Germanic chief' and "the violent Macedonia"? Norpois alludes to these in a monologue in Within a Budding Grove, where he takes Bergotte to task for lulling his public "into forgetting, amid otiose and byzantine discus- sions of the merits of pure form, that we may be overwhelmed by a double tide of barbarians, those from without and those from within our borders" (1: 510; 1: 473). The context in which this is put by the diplomat points to the immediate relevance of his considerations to problems of style: "I am aware that this is to blaspheme against the sacrosanct school of what these gentlemen term 'Art for Art's sake,' but at this period of history there are tasks more urgent than the manipulation of words in a harmonious manner" (1: 510; 1: 473). But not only are these hordes the object of an allusion; we see them indeed appear in the guise of the "petite bande," seeming to merge from the sea, watched by the fascinated Hero, as they move along the pier with the steps of seagulls. The animality of these beings would be that of nature, were it not for the fact that it exerts itself in a vicious and destructive way. The "bande" therefore is an unrepresentative of what Proust calls nature as Legrandin is: the pseudo-nature of the Brute is the obverse of the pseudo-nature of the Artist. But let us not lose touch with our topic, which is rhetoric. By definition, the Brute does not speak, or does so very little. How can we expect to identify an oratorical register peculiar to this group of characters? And yet the sentence overheard by the Protagonist is sufficient to allow us to define their range of expression in rhetorical terms: "Oh, the poor old boy, I feel sorry for him, he looks half dead" ("C'pauvre vieux, i m'fait d'la peine, il a l'air à moitié crevé") (1: 849; 1: 792). The suppression of the mute és and of the / of //before another consonant, though quite normal even in cultivated speech, is nonetheless sig- nificant here since the writer chooses to record it (this being the only time that he does this in the novel). This pronunciation situates the "petite bande" at an inferior sociolinguistic level. The vocabulary does so as well, for "crevé" is a word used only in reference to animals. But above all, "the poor old boy, I feel sorry for him" is an ironic expression of a feeling of compassion uttered by creatures that René Girard once compared with the Hell's Angels. That the use of this trope is intimately associated with viciousness (and therefore with</page><page sequence="7">388 Marcel Muller an inauthentic form of nature) in Proust's discourse is demonstrated by the affinities between this passage and the scene of sadism in Montjouvain, which also takes an old man (actually the deceased father) as its target. The reader is expected to remember how Mile Vinteuil's lover expresses her hostility (a hostility which the narrator goes out of his way to define as sheer comedy): " 'Oh yes, it's so extremely likely that people are looking at us at this time of night in this densely populated district!' said her friend sarcastically" (1: 176; 1: 161). The two symmetrical expressions of pseudo-nature I have talked about can thus be identified with realities of French society between 1850 and 1900: on one hand, we have the overrefined craftsmen of the word (specifically the symbolists and the Parnassians), on the other, the hordes threatening to invade the country (the "Yellow Peril," very real in the imagination of many West- erners of the time) or the crowd of modern democracy, which had been allowed to express itself through the hated universal suffrage, or- more threatening still- the restless masses of the proletariat, much too visible at the time of the 1871 Commune, as faceless as the group of girls among whom the Hero has trouble distinguishing one person from another. The identification of the girls in the "little band" as mistresses of bicycle racers is very significant if one bears in mind the development of the practice of sports in France after 1871 with its attendant phenomenon of gathering crowds. Further, these two sym- metrical forms of pseudo-nature find their figurative expression in conformity with a rigorous system, irony being matched with the Barbarian and all the other nonmetaphorical tropes with the Decadent. So much so that a treatise on tropes (a kind of contemporary "Fontanier") could be written on the basis of Proust's novel and organized like a systematic study of his characters, who in turn could be shown to represent one of the categories of the dialectical pattern. The Decadent and the Barbarian are equally disapproved of by Norpois when, as he comments on the young Hero's prose poem, he denounces Bergotte as being insufficiently virile for a society on the verge of invasion or revolution. Yet the ambassador himself is included in Proust's blanket condemnation of all forms of unnatural modes of being and of expression: culture is of course not any less inauthentic than pseudo-nature. The word condemnation, how- ever, reflects a Manichaeanism which is patently foreign to Proust's view of things, for the implicit author's judgment is part of a system by which he situates all the species of tropes on a dialectical pattern which gives metaphor (the genuine one, that is) the place of honor and presents the other tropes as inferior modes of expression, but without denying their existence, nor even their relative validity as intermediary steps along the trajectory pointing toward the epiphany of the image.</page><page sequence="8">Tropes and Dialectic 389 Notes 1 All citations from Proust's novel will be quoted from Remembrance of Things Past. I give both the reference to this translation, followed by a reference to A la recherche du temps perdu. 2 Kilmartin provides the following identifications: Singers' Bridge: headquarters of the Russian Foreign Ministry in St. Petersburg; Ballplatz (more correctly Ballhaus- platz): the Austrian Foreign Ministry in Vienna; Montecitorio: the Italian Chamber of Deputies in Rome (1: 1022). 3 My translation of "Je suis une tête jacobine" (1: 126), whose import is unfor- tunately obscured in Kilmartin's "I am a bit of a Jacobin" (1:1 39), which is preferable, however, to Scott Moncrieffs "I am a bit of a Radical" (1: 98): neither alludes to the beheading. The use of synecdoche is particularly revealing (as revealing as the com- mentaries of critics are on such occurrences, be it in Proust or in any writer) when the vehicle of the trope is a part of the human body and especially when this part is the head. Roman Jakobson, for example, claims to see no necessary connection between the head and the torso in a human body. No wonder that he has done so much for the promotion of metonymy. On this, see his article "Futurisme" in Questions de Poétique (26). It is to this article, originally published in 1919, that Jakobson refers as containing one of his oldest statements on métonymie relationship in painting (Essais de linguis- tique générale 63n). A very interesting study on this question is that recently devoted by Barbara Woshinsky to what she significantly calls "métonymie mutilation" in Cor- neille. To return to Proust, let me quote here a passage in which the noun tête, used in a way which technically must be defined as a close-up of a detail, rather than as a trope, functions all the same as a kind of synecdoche: "Through the gap between a pair of curtains a head peeped with ceremonious deference ... : it was Swann" (1: 645; 1: 599). This occurs in the narrator's own discourse, but it finds its justification in the fact that the character described belongs to the category of Decadents. (The term "close- up of a detail" is the translation of "gros plan sur un détail" proposed under "synec- doche" by Bernard Dupriez.) 4 Students of preciosity as a means of characterization in Remembrance of Things Past have of course been preceded by Justin O'Brien. 5 1 want to express my gratitude to Susan R. Huston for the translation she kindly provided of this passage, as well as for numerous stylistic and structural emendations of this paper. 6 Unpublished paper read at the MLA convention on December 28, 1967.
