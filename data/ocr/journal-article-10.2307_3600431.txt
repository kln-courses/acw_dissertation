Our descriptions are better - we do not explain any more than our 1. Friedrich Nietzsche, The Gay Science, trans. predecessors . . . In every chemical process, for example, quality appears as a 'miracle', as Walter Kaufmann (Vintage: New York, 1974). ever; also, every locomotion; nobody has 'explained' a push. But how could we possibly explain anything? We operate only with things that do not exist: lines, planes, bodies, atoms, divisible time spans, divisible spaces. How should explanations be at all possible when we first turn eve ything into an image, our image! (p. 172) I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who make things beautiful. Amor fati: let that be my love henceforth! (p. 223) - Nietzsche, The Gay Science' Impersonality has long been part of modernism's self-definition. When T. S. Eliot famously compared the role of an artist with a filament of platinum, he was implicitly seizing for art certain qualities he thought were necessary as counters to one kind of prevailing ('romantic') description of the nature of artistic sensibility. Artists henceforth were to lay claim to the values of craft and order, detachment in the world of emotions, and a new kind of concentration for the purposes of a grand transmutation of appearance. As a catalyst unaffected in a reaction chamber, the artist would finally be at a remove from the material he or she dealt in. A measure of the success of Eliot's intervention in modernism is that at this late date we find it difficult to distinguish the dialectic of impersonality and its antagonist personality, from a logic which shares many of its features but which nevertheless can be said to be distinct. Nietzsche is the best exponent of this other conviction about the nature of modern life, and the vocation indispensable to it. Nietzsche' s ambition is to imagine the world against the grain of all the anthropomorph- isms that tradition has grafted on it, and hence, for him the artist must seek a recognition of all that is nonhuman in the very basic facts of one's existence. The human must confront the nonhuman without deluding itself as to its own superiority-that is, without subsuming difference or otherness under the hierarchy of identity. Strictures against the personal and those against the human and humanised share between them a tremendous energy of refusal, at the heart of which is a rejection of all kinds of specular satisfactions. The difference, I believe, however, turns on the question of exemplarity. The dream of impersonality is to find structures that can account for - or rather, make present - the phenomena of experience in a comprehensive way. The nonhuman, in contrast, is simply too concerned with the qualities of event - the constant appearance of an otherness confronting one's experience-to be content to search out adequate grounds for generalising categories. Will must return time and again to the most elemental descriptions it can muster and from that basis provide a sufficient foundation for motivating action. But how can art' s descriptive ambitions escape the fate of the empirical disciplines it seeks to better when both seem to rely on epistemic claims to truth-value?

They amount to descriptive fictions in the arsenal of traditional representation. And even if they were to succeed as accurate expressions of appearance, description alone remains alien to the very terms it would describe, insofar as it conceals a will to power it cannot justify on the basis of its own empirical values. Art must seek to account for the forces that solicit and engage will in the first place. What we everywhere take to be descriptions, Nietzsche seems to propose, are representational practices that cut us off from the world, especially the inorganic world, in deceptive ways. They do not describe well what they purport to represent. After all, they claim that there are such things as human bodies exercising powers different in kind from the forces and powers of things, of chemical processes, of movements and pushes. Do not human forces and powers have explanations - in fact, demand explanations? To answer in the affirmative is immediately to draw ourselves into a paradigm wherein human beings, retaining some notion of will, must put themselves at the top of a hierarchy that sorts out on the basis of varying levels of explanatory aptitude. And once we make that claim, once we give precedence to explanation, is it not so easy then to see everything else in terms of what we take to be our primary mode of seeing things, but only in weaker or lesser form? This resuturing of our relation to the world by turning it into our likeness-this false synthesis - entails a false analysis. Its origin is in a capricious distinction we make between the world and ourselves, a distinction that ignores the genuine bond or tie between us. Things and forces simply are. A proper explanation, Nietzsche implies, is one that weds itself to the world, to the way the world is - why? - simply because that is what there is, and we have no other. Oughts must be predicated on the factuals of the world - and not the reverse. This emphasis everywhere and always on explanation distracts us from what our powers and forces allow us to do. Perhaps (this is Nietzschian nicety at its subtlest) powers and forces are all the explanation one needs. They are values in their own right. Value is something not added onto powers and forces, something superior or antecedent to a given manifestation of power in an act of will. Perhaps will is just the means by which we realise powers, the means by which we align ourselves with what is powerful in things - ultimately, our way of exercising value in power. This is the wager then-that there is something nonhuman in the very sources of value - or rather, that value is the place of transaction between the human and the nonhuman. In this setting, explanations are subordinate phenomena, when they are not already afterthoughts and weak attempts at self-justification. If, as seems all too evident, explanation is already profoundly woven into description, what we appear to need are art practices that adhere to the urgencies of the nonhuman, and first and foremost, that means that we have to refashion what we have it in mind to do when we invoke 'description'. Description must be made to show its dependencies on will - yes-but this can only mean, conversely, that what is becomes the ground zero for the possibility of valuing, for the possibility of exercising our powers. Will can only do this by facing a kind of acknowledgement; it must accept its own contingent relation to the empirical facts of an experience it cannot but consider as other-and this without the least recourse to larger explanatory or generalising frameworks.2 Modernism has tried this under various dispensations. And yet it is only when we reach the hulking last stand of modernism that the extremity of this ambition gets carried through to its most acute form. I am thinking here of 2.

These prefatory remarks have been made with an eye to elucidating some of the consistent problems his work engages. If we take, as a point of comparison, Malevich's most typical Suprematist paintings, where the abstract shapes tilt against the coordinate axes of the frame in an effort of resistance against normalising parameters of viewing, we still feel that these levitating bodies are organised around a centre they are leaning away from (Fig. 1). The pictorial structure of the paintings aims at some sense of the momentary convergence of impersonal laws depicting 'a nonobjective principle of balance linking desire to fundamental cosmic laws' . 3 A typical Pollock of the drip period attempts to extirpate all vestiges and suggestion of human-centred design qualities. The alloverness of the drips radicalise the figures responsible for balance in Malevich's paintings by hashing and pulverising all implication of body. And the contingency of material gravitational forces, so important to the facture of the paintings, replaces the levitating, elated figures in Malevich. One only has to recall a Malevich title like Painterly Aealism. Boy with Knapsack in order to substantiate connections between the artist's abstractions and mimetic re-imaginings of the body. But one cannot push this contrast too far. Malevich is some kind of a Nietzschian also, and marshalling the evidence of such an idiosyncratic title seems to miss the in-your-face irony of the painting. In claiming that Pollock more consistently and more assertively returns to the nonhuman as the governing pressure placed upon his paintings (earlier figurative paintings included), I am not saying that his art has no precedents. Rather, I am saying that in certain respects, Pollock's art clarifies tensions that exist within modernism all the way through. When Merleau-Ponty remarks, in ' Cezanne' s Doubt', that ' Cezanne' s painting suspends . . . habits of thought and reveals the base of inhuman nature upon which man has installed himself',4 he is giving a famous version of this other dimension in modernism. Cezanne's landscapes are absent of people not because, or not merely because, the painter wants to provide an exemplary space for seeing, and for the construction of the act of seeing, without the distractions of a psychological proxy in the scene: Nature itself is stripped of the attributes which make it ready for animistic communions: there is no wind in the landscape, no movement on the Lac d'Annecy; the frozen objects hesitate as at the beginning of the world. It is an unfamiliar world in which one is uncomfortable and which forbids all human effusiveness. If one looks at the work of other painters after seeing Cezanne's paintings, one feels somehow relaxed, just as conversations resumed after a period of mourning mask the absolute change and give back to the survivors their solidity.5 Cezanne's nature requires mourning. This, one might say, is the traumatic other side to Nietzschian gaiety. One mourns the death of a world done up in anthropomorphic and anthropocentric terms. Such witnessing, according to Merleau-Ponty, eventually leads to a new solidity, a different 'foundation' for the world. Here, Nietzsche and Freud come together. For the criterion that measures the success of the work of mourning is not a newly realised metaphysics but merely a sense that one can move on. Before that happens, however, much has to take place. As Freud suggests in Studies in Hysteria, the work of mourning involves a compulsive need to bring before one the images of the lost object and grieve over them - summon up memories and then banish them, kill the loved object again. The description of this practice, it should be clear, applies much more to Pollock than Cezanne. Pollock's literal effacement of the figure in one of his earliest drip paintings, Fig. 1.

Here I am taking the figure as a sign for much of what needs to be rejected, or rather mourned over, if the nonhuman should be able to assert itself. It is true that this practice (and description) has a theatrical tenor to it, but this is part and parcel of the morbidity and gothic-ness that Greenberg ascribed to Pollock's work. It might be fair to say that Pollock shuttles between this and another mood, more Nietzschian in its tone, that tends to emphasise the positive labour involved in exploring and remaking a world severed from debilitating superstitions about nature. That which is human is not disposed of; it becomes a witness to its very other, and painting becomes testimony to the acceptance and responsibility for that otherness in its most elementary engagements of will. 6. Pollock's habit of beginning his large drip paintings with human-scale quasi-figurative outlines that he then paints over to the point of unrecognisability is meticulously documented in Pepe Karmel's essay for the catalogue of the MOMA retrospective. 'Pollock at Work: The Films and Photographs of Hans Namuth', Jackson Pollock (Museum of Modern Art: New York, 1 998). 7. Concerning this distinction, the author wishes to acknowledge T. J. Clark, who is the first to my awareness to make use of this duality to describe Pollock's work. His general style of thinking and manner of emphasis inform a great many of the readings below. Inscription and Depiction in Pollock's Early Paintings Isolating the tension between inscribed line and depicted figure7 remains a crucial step towards understanding the advances made in the Pollock drip paintings of his classic phase between 1947-1950. I propose therefore to turn to three early paintings in order to provide a basis for describing the solutions the compositions of the drip period address to antecedent paintings. Stenographic Figure (Fig. 2) fills the pictorial field with an ambivalent energy of line overwriting the figure underneath. Line anticipates the drip paintings in that it is not restricted to depicting or delineating edges and figures. On the one hand, line as a form of script, stays on the surface and flattens the underlying figure, which serves as its 'ground'. The figure rises to the surface and becomes a tableau for the scrawl. On the other hand, the disembodied line emphasises nothing if not its own distance from the figure. This distance is partly effected by the caricaturing role of line (Fig. 3). Notice the black line that exaggerates the fingers of the figure's red hand (fingernails?) and the slight embellishments that line creates, as both a partly autonomous pictorial a - :al Flg. 2.

In both cases, the underlying effect is irony. Line assumes a kind of violence that ultimately appears as a failed defensive posture: pseudo-mastery over the 'stenographic figure' it claims to overwrite. The figure herself or itself, alternating between a couch or bed and a monstrous whale-like creature with a patly burlesque - but not therefore untouching-gentleness, only makes the tension between the desired impersonality of irony and the intense pathos of the figure's intimacy all the more untenable and unbearable. By pushing impersonality to its extreme, Stenographic Figure verges on a set of metaphors that dispense with the ideals of a non-specific, generalisable sexuality, and move into the territory of the nonhuman. In one sense, line tends towards a form of writing whose ambition is to set down all the pre- scripted structures of the body and of sexuality in its manifestly gendered form. The skewed tic-tac-toe game, in which sexuality plays out its strategic gamesmanship, becomes a thing tattooed or inscribed on the body. Line comes to represent the principle of impersonal-not-fully-individuated, atavistic, compulsive-laws of behaviour. The white and orange lines that cross the figure's eye become emblems for the eye's demand to survey with an impersonality of vision, though this assumed attitude hardly covers over the grotesque bathos of the scene. But the very archaism of the line, its sheer indifference to human needs and human motives, seems to bypass or precede the whole economy of intimacy and impersonality, and reach towards a rather different organising logic. The blue background can almost be said to be an oceanic source. And script, in its quality of literalness, comes to look like 'inhuman arabesque'8. The more the painting insists on the impersonal, the more impersonal mark-making comes to have a specificity of its own. Sexuality then becomes a metaphor for other forms of desire, and their relation to aspects of experience in which a fantasy of control needs to be given up, and in which clinging to predictability and inevitability (impersonal laws) seem like a stance that shuts out other possibilities of engaging the world. This argument is anticipatory, and in that sense it cannot be fully realised in Stenographic Ficgure, which is among the earliest of Pollock's mature paintings. But time and again, the early paintings rehearse some version of this duality: they foreground the control-uncontrol dynamic as a tension between primordial - perhaps unconscious, but in any case generalisable - structures of totemic sexuality set against a kind of mark-making whose literalness resists the needy psychology behind the desire for impersonality. Experiments in automatic mark-making play a strange and ambivalent role in this regard. In one respect, lines claim some authority as instruments of the unconscious, which seem always destined to return to the scene of sexual difference re- enacted. In another respect though, these same lines abandon themselves to the vagaries of a hand that proceeds by whim and velleity, rather than by control and assertion. Here the Nietzschian question of how will engages a set of external determinants comes to the fore. And the pictorial result of the latter- a resistant materialism - seems to give the lie to the former's case for an unconditioned, unmediated truth of the unconscious. One could perform the same kind of analysis on Male and Female (Fig. 4) as on Stenographic Ficqure. The predatory male totemic figure becomes something like a blank slate or blackboard for a set of mathematical laws about chances for coupling. Through a kind of dream grammar that resembles the logic Freud spells out in his section on considerations of representability in The Interpretation of Dreams, a figure is the ground for 'figuring' in the mathematical sense. The pun suggests that the figure is merely the sum of the impersonal 8. T. J.

Especially intriguing are the eyes that form from these marks: the one at middle of the right-hand edge of the painting and the other at the base of the female totem (Figs. S and 6). It is hard to tell whether the eyes are figures of suspicion, and hence, agents of the totemic characters, or whether they are figures for the seeing that goes on at the periphery of the painting's incidents. As far as this last inference goes, something like an alternative to the vulgar and vociferous sexual antics finds space for itself- although clearly as marginalised concerns in respect to the painting as a whole. Guardians of the Secret (Fig. 7) performs the reverse gesture to that of ANale and Female. Whereas the former tends to relegate the more abstract marks to the peripheries of the canvas, the latter frames the abstract within the figurative and therefore attempts to contain it. The price exacted for this containing gesture is evident in the stasis of the scene and formal rigidity of the linear hieratic guards to either side of the painting. This is Pollock's gothic- ness at an unrelenting but contradictory extreme. The whole scene resembles nothing so much as a tomb or crypt, where whatever is buried under the abstract marks in the yellow square9 is being mourned as much as guarded. It is as if abstract marks have to figure for a content for which the key is no longer available. Content remains more or less dead, buried under a layer of abstract paint that seals the surface and denies what preceded it. It has been pointed out that the seemingly abstract black lines in the yellow square are stick figures turned upside down.10 The estranging effect that comes with inverting the pictorial field, and consequently turning our normal conceptions of the body and its orientation upside down, on the one hand allow the viewer to attend to the marks with an eye to their literalness. This is surely not an unanticipated or uncelebrated effect. On the other hand, the topos of the world turned upside down merely adds to the sense that content is no longer available to us, except in and through distortion. Even provided that one does not focus on or notice the inverted figures, the effect of framing the yellow square within a larger figurative context is such as to emphasise the disparity between an accessible content, and the furtive movements within-comprising a set of lines whose forrnal relation to the exterior figures seem entirely opaque by contrast. The painting cannot disperse the residue of an intense hermeneutic demand that figuration places upon the painting. The question of what solicits line then is 'secret', and inscription becomes hieroglyph. Seen in context with Stenographic Figure and Male and Female, the partly readable impersonal sign-making of these former paintings here becomes a dead or a dying law of signs. Aligning Will to the Given: How Pollock Re-Envisions Praxis Guardians of the Secret provides, I suggest, an attractive occasion for reflecting on what needs reorienting if the drip paintings much further down the line are to be conceived of as at all possible. An argument Giorgio Agamben has made about the relation between transmissibility and action suits this task by honing in on some of the pressures this painting manifests. Drawing on Walter Benjamin but giving him a melancholy twist, Agamben declares that the loss of cultural authority that art once possessed does not result in a decline of aura which then opens the space for reconstituting new values through revolutionary political praxis. The shock value of an art that no longer transmits culture becomes a value in itself. As a function of reproducible production, the art object loses none of its aura, but becomes 'the very cipher Fig. 5.

By destroying the transmissibility of the past, aesthetics recuperates it negatively and makes intransmissibility a value in itself in the image of aesthetic beauty, in this way opening for man a space between past and future in which he can found his action and his knowledge.12 Pollock's yellow square could be taken as an emblem for this paradoxical aesthetic space, where 'what is transmitted is the impossibility of transmission',13 creating a suspended site for action denatured of all content to play itself out. Agamben's notion of 'action' implies a condensed history of the avant-garde transformation of aesthetic production into a form of praxis, in which art aspires to contain its own determining principle within itself, as an immanent reflection of will. Of course, Guardians of the Secret resists this in its reference to the unconscious, but there is a part of the painting that is emphatically about the surface, about the yellow that rises up to the picture plane and leaves the background that frames it behind it. Whether in the form of exteriorised decision-making, or human activity as vital impulse, this disastrous metaphysics of the will seems incapable of bridging 'abstract' mark- making, and figural content in its surrounds. What is disastrous, to put it in an economic metaphor, is the fetishism at the heart of this expression of will. Aesthetic labour embraces will as its mode of externalised self-production, but OXFORD ART JOURNAL 27.1 2004 9</page><page sequence="8">Omri Moses only as the radical other to the productive subject and the disinterested observer alike. For the determining ground or constraint for will is seen as increasingly opaque to both, an impenetrable 'secret' divorced from the concrete social relations that allow the object to come into being. Given the resonance Agamben's argument has with Guardians of the Secret, we ought to ask whether it applies equally to the drip paintings. To do this, we first have to go into his argument in some detail. Regardless of its insufficiencies, we have to credit the terms by which the argument is constructed. The avant-garde ideal of poiesis becoming praxis, Agamben suggests, obscures the basis in Greek ontology from which the two concepts emerged. Art as a form of making (poiesis) can only vanish into doing or willing (praxis) by locating its essence within itself, and thereby erasing the notion of truth as unveiling - truth as referring to what originates outside itself: The central experience of poiesis, pro-duction into presence, is replaced by the question of the 'how', that is, of the process through which the object has been produced. In terms of the work of art, this means that the emphasis shifts away from what the Greeks considered the essence of the work - the fact that in it something passed from nonbeing into being, thus opening the space of truth (alatheia) and building a world for man's dwelling on earth . . 14 Art therefore achieves nature's immanence by abandoning a conception of truth that grants art distinctive powers, and it, like nature, comes to be valued only as a reflection of acting forces. For the Greeks, on the other hand, will could only be meaningful if priority was first granted to the work of bringing- into-presence, the work of poiesis in which will could only carry subordinate value. By treating praxis as the sole criterion - reducing questions about 'what' gets produced in a work to the question about 'how' it gets produced - one eliminates all possibility of discussing those aspects of a work that go beyond the gesture of doing, that subordinate technique to the authority of the presentational power of the work itself in its full disclosive power. The differentiating process that makes aesthetics a separate domain marks one beginning of this bad metaphysics. Aesthesis grounds art in the experience of a spectator, which gives rise to the schism between the genius-function that no one, not even the maker of art, can lay claim to, and the position of the disinterested observer, who can experience the art object only as something radically other. What the spectator sees in art, the formal matrix or rule of its own self-production, is alien to her, while what she sees of herself in the work (the content) appears no longer necessary, but something that she is perfectly aware of as a thinking subject, and therefore does not need art to disclose. One might consider the drip paintings as even more radical versions of a disastrous metaphysics of the will, because they do not even hide behind depth psychology as a putative explanation. How many commentators, after all, can we dig up who have suggested that the drip paintings are a radical attempt at avoiding all discursive or extrinsic principles of determination in an effort to found an ordering principle within the productive activity of painting itselfl Take Meyer Schapiro, for example, in referring to the Pollock illustration, Number 26A: Black and White, 1948 (Fig. 8): Modern painting is the first complex style in history which proceeds from elements that are not pre-ordered as closed articulated shapes. The artist today creates an order out of unordered variable elements to a greater degree than the artist of the past . . . His goal is often an order which retains a decided quality of randomness as far as this is compatible with an ultimate unity of the whole. That random corresponds in tum to a feeling of freedom, an unconstrained activity at every point.l5 14. Agamben, p. 70. 15.

As will be clear, I intend to argue that this description largely evades the main point of Pollock's paintings. But first, we should recognise that Schapiro's position falls perfectly in line with Agamben's assessment of the ambition of modernist art, though without the implicit critique that Agamben lays as to the seeming obscurity of the motivating criteria and constraints for mark-making. The usefulness of Agamben's anatomised history of the relation between poiesis and praxis is that it clarifies certain ideals within avant-garde practice - and none more so than Pollock's-for an immanent and generic principle of will as a self-determining ground for art. On the one hand, such a principle is seen as a guarantor for the impersonality, not to say the potential for collectivity, at the seat of artistic praxis. It becomes clear, especially after Kant, that valorising praxis restores to the divided nature of labour - labour as technical production and labour as artistic production - some common basis for attaching significance. Pollock's drip paintings seem to aver that finally we have an art not beholden to a rule or principle outside of the production process - an art without a discursive or practical or exemplary or mimetic end, bent on paring away more and more non-reproducible expressive effects of touch that are hamstrung to a rhetoric of individuality. Singularity henceforth will issue from an employment of will alone. Schapiro's word, 'unconstrained', harbours all the idealisms of labour reimagined as play, and as the exercise of will without the coercions experienced in the factory and the office. On the other hand, Agamben specifies one basic set of pressures within this concept of praxis as it pertains to art. Either aesthetic judgment becomes a deciphering process, intent upon finding a hidden content, a secret, in the art object, or it employs metaphors of freedom, absent the criteria for valuing that freedom. What makes Agamben's own account unsatisfying, though, is the rather impoverished concept of will his version of praxis draws on. Without a sufficiently detailed account of what constrains will, one ends up like Agamben arguing that the criteria for completion or fulfilment in a certain artwork (poiesis) amount to fetishised praxis. But so long as one takes Pollock's modernist commitments as still adhering to the values of 'realisation' central to Cezanne's legacy, then the obscurantism that Guardians of the Secret courts could not but have been an uneasy experiment on Pollock's part. In the drips, Pollock, it seems, would need to rethink the question of praxis, wherein 'technique is just a means of arriving at a statement' (Pollock interview) . 16 Here, I believe, we must return to Nietzsche for a more complex version of will, and doubly so because it is really a Nietzschian solution that Pollock pursues in the drip compositions. Contra Agamben's notion of will, which comes to resemble the popular prejudice exaggerated by philosophers that Nietzsche attacks in the beginning of Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche argues that one should avoid taking the word 'will' in univocal fashion, as that which is a sufficient determinant for action. Such a conception would only be in the service of ideologies of power - a condition to which Schapiro may be said to succumb if only because he refuses to specify constraints by which the word 'freedom' would have to be understood. In that sense, he deprives it of its critical punch. Will must admit to these constraints folded within itself: 16. Jackson Pollock, 'Three Statements, 1944- 1951', in Herschel B. Chipp (ed.) Theories of Modern Art: A Source Book by Artists and Critics (University of California Press: Berkeley, 1968), p. 548. now let us notice what is strangest about the will - this manifold thing for which the people have only one word: inasmuch as in the given circumstances we are at the same time the OXFORD ART JOURNAL 27.1 2004 11</page><page sequence="10">Omri Moses commanding and the obeying parties, and as the obeying party we know the sensations of constraint, impulsion, pressure, resistance, and motion, which usually begin immediately after the act of will; inasmuch as, on the other hand, we are accustomed to disregard this duality, and to deceive ourselves about it by means of the synthetic concept '1', a whole series of erroneous conclusions, and consequently of false evaluations of the will itself, has become attached to the act of willing - to such a degree that he who wills believes sincerely that willing suffices for action.17 An adequate notion of will cannot single out those aspects of control and assertion from all that constrains the will-opens it up to the contingencies that bind action to world. Nietzsche's resistance to integrating the various component forces that make up willing under a single rubric displays his insistence on seeking out, again and again, the degree to which things on the seeming exterior solicit will, and the degree to which will is dependent on them. Affect, habit, muscular sensation cannot be separated from the work of will; neither can a whole gamut of material constraints. Thus where Agamben sees in will the determining conditions for action, Nietzsche sees a heterogeneity that demands acknowledgment and acceptance. Pollock adopts Nietzsche's terms inasmuch as he refuses to put making in complete opposition to what is given. This means that mastery over the well- wrought art object has to undergo a level of deskilling. But more fundamentally, painting must take form as a stage - or more perspicuously, a support- in which action and decision-making, registered in the paint, resist formulas for their articulation - remain too literal and too much oriented to the particular events which give rise to them. This is an adulterated site in which volition shares company with contingency, rather than seeing itself as triumphing over it. The need to come to terms with contingency makes praxis for its own sake an idle activity. Pollock has a poignant little note, found among his papers, that expresses something of the ethical imperative behind his practice: 17.

No Sketches acceptance of what I dol8 The surprises that go with the territory of relinquishing sketches are inseparable from a compositional process that demands immediate adjustment, correction, and modification, but ultimately also acceptance of what happens and cannot be anticipated in advance. These enjambed lines offer a formal correlate to the work behind acceptance that Pollock pursues within the inevitable seriality of his mark-making. For what appears in subsequent lines is just the doing that makes receptiveness and acceptance necessary from the start, but only - grammatically speaking - as long as acceptance is 'of' a something that continually passes into something else. Especially here, I think, we must be careful to avoid, or at least to modulate, that age-old humanist hum about taking responsibility. For what Pollock's practice demands is not a supplementary or subsidiary activity to the primary work of scanning and painting. He demands a basic affirming stance. Affirmation is not 'taking responsibility'. As Deleuze says: 'affirmation is not action but the power of becoming active, becoming active personified' . 1 9 One basic such power in Pollock is the power of conception. Acceptance would be a misnomer if conceived of as mere assent, without any constructive work that makes a Pollock composition a painting and not doodle. Instead of entertaining gesture for its own sake, painting must pursue the point at which satisfactory metaphoric registers emerge from metonymy, the fetishised 12 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 27.1 2004</page><page sequence="11">Jackson Pollock's Address to the Nonhuman perspective in which only parts speak, as if for the whole - the perspective in which there is only praxis and nothing more. What we are after, then, is some way of stipulating the form in which metaphors offer themselves in Pollocks drip paintings, and I cannot help but feel that our starting point in the nonhuman gain us some sort of a foothold. Will's responsiveness to all that is not will turns out to require a radical anti- humanism as its starting point. It is not only distance from the human that is at stake in Pollock's construction of space. Hazarding an exposition of Pollock's metaphors has to move beyond a formalist ideal of opticality-where the drips are conceived of as rejecting tactile organisations of space for a distinctively painterly one. Metaphor in Pollock loses all claims to soliciting elemental investments so long as it remains an argument about medium. Opening up the given to self-acknowledgment would preclude seeing from being the ultimate effect- or acting (praxis) for that matter. Schapiro has a description of Pollock's 'endless tangles' that seems to me to hit upon the main emotional analogy that Pollock's line courts: The impulse, which is most often not readily visible in its pattern, becomes tangible and definite on the surface of a canvas through the painted mark. We see, as it were, the track of emotion, its obstruction, persistence or extinction. But all these elements of impulse which seem at first so aimless on the canvas are built up into a whole characterised by firmness, often by elegance and beauty of shapes and colors.20 It is in the sense of these tracks of emotion that Pollock can say his paintings represent 'memories arrested in space'.21 Yet I think a great deal still has to be specified regarding the relation between these local events and the totality, which never ceases having a claim upon Pollock's metaphors. In fact, one can characterise metaphor in Pollock as an attempt to achieve a balance between the claims of a totalising vantage point of conception and modification, and an attention to the local events that constitute the totality. These local events provide many of the constraints upon which the totality defines itself. The Nonhuman in Pollock: Inaugurating the Drip Style All this tends towards the unrelentingly abstract so long as we do not direct attention to the particularity of the paintings' solutions; only there will we be able to discriminate the overriding metaphors of Pollock's drip paintings, assuming that there are such, with any kind of specificity. The immediately preceding sequence of paintings to the drips, the 'Sounds in the Grass' series, offer an important place from which to assess the drip paintings' testimonial ambitions. Unlike the three early paintings we have already examined, these paintings make a landscape analogy central to their purpose. As in the drips which follow, landscape has something of a cosmological import to it (Fig. 9). Human presence is largely attenuated, although crucial to the metaphoric intentions of the paintings. The eyes that emerge within Eyes in the Heat ( 1946), some subtly and half by accident, and others with unequivocal assertion out of the rounded edges of the marks, reinforce the synesthesia motif. But once again, it is hard to pinpoint their metaphoric register. Are these eyes meant to behold the heaviness and mass of the paint - the artifice they seem to be turned to - or are they spontaneous human forms cut into the very warp of nature? Clearly synesthesia is meant as an affirmation of the correspondence between intelligence and sense, human presence and landscape. This is an art that insists on the role of metaphor - an art of proxy, of intensely imagined habitation. On the other hand, these eyes, some of which seem anxious and perturbed-suspicious in the extreme-look out as 20. Schapiro, 'Abstract Art', p. 219. 21.

Corroborating this 'dark' reading are some of Lee Krasner's paintings of the late 1950s, obviously in dialogue with this composition, in which the 'evil eye' motif surfaces explicitly. 23.

If synesthesia represents the totalising expansion of boundaries of sense, then these eyes are not all up to the challenge.22 Shimmering Substance (1946) has some of the same equivocation about it (Fig. 10). Serge Guilbaut connects the round, brilliant, yellow halo with contemporary accounts of atomic detonation over Bikini Island: The effect recorded by Pollock is one of bedazzlement, such as can be caused by staring too long at the sun, leading to complete perceptual disintegration . . . Things disintegrate not only on the surface, as seen, but also in their very essence, owing to the deeply searing quality of the light . . . What is shown, in short, is not the sun but its equivalent, the atomic bomb, transformed into myth.23 While one may not agree with his historicist desire to locate a particular event as a determining ground for this painting, Guilbaut is right to bring our attention to the traumatic overtones in the painting, coinciding not accidentally with the dissolution of the pictorial field. But one might add Fig. 10. Jackson Pollock, Shimmering Substance, 1946, oil on canvas, 76.3 x 61.6 cm.

Could Shimmering Substance be a figure for a totalising gaze, the A-bomb being just one limit-case variant? There is a seducing simplicity to the painting and its brash lighting effects. And yet, if an eye, this one has sickly, distempered and uncentered orange pupils. Though one does not need Greenberg's complaint that atomic bombs are theatre and not painting24 to suggest that Shimmering Substance is visually far less paradoxical or lofty than our verbal descriptions: there is an evanescence of effect to the halo, a subtle gathering of intensity that defines the boundaries of what the eye perceives. These two paintings are as close as Pollock had come to an allover composition until the drips. Plainly what is at stake is some notion of totality. And yet here is the rub: this totality, edging towards a residual gothic tone familiar to us from Pollock's earlier work, cannot help but register the disconnect within the synesthetic ideal. The eyes materialise the contention, developed in Walter Benjamin, of the auratic object's power to return the look,25 yet these eyes hardly display the means of reciprocation. They fall asunder to traumatic incapacity, where trauma becomes the psychological sign of an interruption or nonparity between human intelligence and its other. Shimmering Substance, for instance, is not large (two-and-a-half feet by two feet), and yet its metaphor speaks beyond its literal size to a virtual scale of immense but indeterminate proportions. It therefore seems to get lost in its own overpowering sublimity, and what resolve it maintains towards totalization remains the uneasy and discordant result of a will to completion or mastery. Full Fathom Five (Fig. 11), finished within a year of these paintings, already reveals a fundamental departure from the 'Sounds in the Grass' series. What is unmistakable is the keen desire on the artist's part to rework the question of totality such that an appeal to trauma is no longer the inevitable and obligatory register-in the first instance, by reconciling will to the otherness it confronts through an insistence upon a relationship of nonmastery. The internal illumination of Shimmerin, Substance gives way to a line that disburses and scatters the light it receives across the surface of the canvas, an effect that becomes the hallmark of the drip paintings. And the detritus embedded in the magma of paint - the cigarette butts, the nails, matches, tacks, and paint tube tops which in a felicitous turn of phrase, Frank O'Hara calls 'little blind eyes'26 - all these loose ends of ordinary life announce the incorporation of contingency and impurity into the material building blocks of totality. The gesture seems to fold in what such a totality might have sought to exclude, as the very source of its claim upon the world. But we have yet to specify what this totality looks like as a totality. Here we might turn again to Nietzsche, who with preternatural sense, anticipates a description of the early drips by well over half a century. One only has to read Pollock's pictorial surface as a version of Nietzsche's cosmology: 24. cf. Clement Greenberg, 'Art', Nation, 8 March 1947, p. 284. Reprinted in John O'Brian (ed.), Clement Greenbery: The Collected Essays and Criticism (University of Chicago Press: Chicago and London, 1986). 25. cf. Walter Benjamin, 'On Some Motifs in Baudelaire', Illuminations, trans. Harry Zohn (Harcourt: New York, 1968) p. 188: 'To perceive the aura of an object we look at means to invest it with the ability to look at us in return. ' Baudelaire, according to Benjamin, is the poet that makes the disintegration of aura inevitable for the modern age, and a poet for whom the new is always a shock, a traumatic event. Unavoidably, then, Baudelaire's own idealisations of synesthesia- his famous 'correspondences' - become melancholy affects, what's left of a world in which allegory is no longer available in its stable ritual form. The point for us, however, in bringing up a conception of the nonhuman is to be eventually able to talk about kinds of human affinity with things and forces staged not principally in terms of an intersubjective confrontation (a returned gaze) or its lack. To substantiate the intersubjective or broadly subjective character of Benjamin's notion of aura, cf. Kaja Silverman, The Thresholl of the Visible World (New York: Routledge, 1996) pp. 93-103. See also her recent piece on the artist James Coleman: 'Melancholia 2' James Coleman (Ostfildern: Hatje Cantz, 2002); Silverman, there, focuses on the melancholic nature of allegory as Benjamin conceives it in his later work, which is not, she argues, a metaphysical or historical longing for unity that never was, but a distinctively affective and synesthetic experience that comes over us on the basis of our particular memorial history as a subject. 26.

Let us beware of saying that death is opposed to life. The living is merely a type of what is dead, and a very rare t - .27 I have indulged in such a long quote because I think that at every point, Nietzsche adds something to a description of Full Fathom Five, or Phosphorescence (Fig. 12). Nietzsche helps us see, first of all, the deliberate refusal in these paintings to profess order and lawfulness on the one hand, or an absolute chaotic-ness on the other. For Nietzsche's 'contradictory' universe withdraws from such an economy, which is perceived as anthropomorphic in either case. There are no accidents, because accidents imply a humanistic bias, an implied reference to a world of purposes. We can note here Pollock's consistent claims in interviews and elsewhere that his painting is a 'denial of the accident' .28 Phosphorescence especially has a stiff, impenetrable surface, seemingly detached from any psychic values one would like to project onto it. Then there is the smallness of perspective common to both Nietzsche and Pollock: if there is such a thing as a human motive, a human purpose, a living figure, it gets swallowed up (literally in the case of Galaxy) in the cosmic largeness of the depiction. Notice the tropologcal reversal that Nietzsche effects in conventional notions of accident and necessity. It is the human that is accidental, triflingly small and diluted with respect to intention and will, while the universe itself gains accordingly in necessity. Behind this necessity lies the ethical demand to which we have already called attention in both Nietzsche and Pollock: the need to seek out acceptance in the events that circumscribe action. The critical spirit of Nietzsche's avowed negations can here be said to leave open the potential for affirmative powers - the vanishing point in which elemental description and valuing converge. They converge within a cosmological outlook; this, I think, is hardly a point to be missed. The largeness of prospect corresponds in Nietzsche to the monism inherent in his will to power, and in Pollock, to the ambition for a painting that dispenses with all extraneous assumptions, a painting in which all things are folded into it. And this palpable craving to recover the singular conditions that make figuration possible, a return to primordial experience-having line be the most elemental trace of transition, before its reification as a delimiting mark-seems indistinguishable from the immediacy that Greenberg refers to in his 1948 essay, 'The Crisis of the Easel Picture': '[Pollock's paintings] may express a monist naturalism for which there are neither first nor last things, and which recognises as the only ultimate distinction that between the immediate and the un-immediate' .29 Firstness and lastness, it seems to me, are immediacy for Pollock. But we cannot delude ourselves much less than Pollock did as to the outcome of his procedures. The scale of the paintings, the very largeness of depiction, which was intended to exorcise the ghosts of anthropomorphism, is precisely the thing that occasions their reappearance. Landscape's conversion into a scale of great dimension shows its own susceptibility to the imagination's power of metaphoric projection.30 The outlook, so perfectly human in its perspective-for-us, refers itself back to the perceiving subject. Aura in the paintings returns full force. The motif of concealment-in the first case, eclipsing the presence of the figure within enormous perspective, but then also the concealment of literal figures under paint, and the burial of the debris in Full Fathom Five, which one cannot see from normal viewing distance-works Fig. 12.

The other, perhaps more serious, problem is that cosmic necessity in the Nietzschian sense comes to look like inevitability the moment human criteria of self-risk dwindle to a cosmic or oceanic composure. To have painting continue to provide criteria for organising value, the human must attest to the otherness in its experience; otherwise it loses the grounds for its claims to singularity. Embodiment and Elimination: What Happens to the Drips Without doing justice to the paintings, I simply want to outline the trajectory that the drips take after their initial moment of conception has passed. The problematic of the nonhuman hardly disappears; Pollock simply finds a more literal tack to continue to press the issue. For if the difficulty with the landscape analogy is its susceptibility to an artificial magic, then painting must return to its roots in action and the body, where the human can cement its role as participant-witness to the nonhuman within its experience. One could hardly imagine a more fitting advertisement of this turn than Number IA, 1948 (Fig. 13). The new year brings with it an induction into bodily scale, which the handprints more than make obvious. Pollock allows the canvas to show through, a sign of transparency of manufacture, in which the constructedness of painting is given a new freshness. Line truly becomes a mark of decision- making, of the casting and pitching of the human arm, rather than any projected image of the body's scale, let alone the abstracted cosmological 18 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 27.1 2004</page><page sequence="17">Jackson Pollock's Address to the Nonhuman metaphors of the preceding compositions. More than any of the previous drips, perhaps more than any of the drips period, this painting confronts one. It does so in the literalness of its size with respect to the human body, and in the pathos of its fraglity and tenseness of line. The painting cannot allow itself to escape into metaphoric or visual extensibility either; the white loops are largely rebuffed at the edges. Other paintings of this period that confront the question of embodiment seem less successful in their attempt to sidestep the requisite literalism of Number IA, 1948. For instance, there is The Wooden Horse: Number IOA, 1948, that takes up where Full Fathom Five left off, incorporating mixed materials in a format even more explicitly akin to collage (Fig. 14). Like collage, this painting asks the viewer to admit the viewed object into a virtual space of the mind, where the fissured support becomes reintegrated through an act of imaginative recovery and completion. It is not the illusion of an object that is at stake, but the work of an imagination whose constructive activity becomes manifest as a negotiation of competing grounds. But in Pollock, event takes over the constructivist will, so that the orange banana at the top of the painting that may be supposed to signify the curvature of the hobbyhorse's back here gets displaced and scrambled beyond recovery by any seeing intelligence. The acknowledgment that contingency disrupts the imagination's work of reconstruction, and that the mind cannot wrest a space of virtual embodiment, ends up becoming a weepy story about lack. The moment there is some semiotic position outside the literalness of mark-making that the painting entertains for its criteria of success, that is the moment contingency can be thought of as articulating its own deficiency. Psychology also intrudes when marks become signs for something else, and especially here when there is even a hint of allegory (childhood disturbance and deception).31 In this sense, The Wooden Horse is subject to a fate not so different from Guardians of the Secret. In both paintings, the inferential demand of psychological allegory disrupts any claims that literalness of mark-making has for an internal sufficiency. In the end, though, even Number IA, 1948, if we can judge by Pollock's shift, comes to have too much of a prerogative to the human to be a sustainable direction for the artist. Of course, one can never specify a logic in painting which is necessary and assured in advance of its ultimate direction; really all 31. For a less peremptory statement about this painting, cf. T. 1. Clark- who sees the composition as employing an idiom both infantile and disorganised - but wilfully so: 'how could anyone looking at The Wooden Horse not see the depth of the painting's disdain for its own language? - but there is no other ground, it reckons, on which painting might rediscover itself as exploration, rather than dead entertainment . . . There may still turn out to be a kind of artlessness that has power to wound. Or an encounter with childhood touched by Little Hans's fears.

Number IA, 1948 and Wooden Horse both appear to have been judged unsuitably theatrical. Why not, then, disrupt the sense of an intersubjective confrontation by magnifying the pictorial field until the body and its perspective no longer encapsulate the framing edges of the painting? For especially in Number IA, 1948, the thing that gives the painting its hold on human experience also threatens to reduce that experience to pure performativity, to some kind of stagy theatre in which certain effects are anticipated in advance by the fact of their assimilation to the size and scale of the human body. Greenberg reasons that the move to a large format was an attempt to escape from the enclosing rectangle of the frame which the Cubists, following Cezanne's lead, had 'established as the all-controlling coordinate of design and drawing'.32 Rejecting the premature synthesis that a controlling frame would provide seems naturally to lead to the general undoing of structure. Part of Number I A, I 948's force lies in its totalising completeness. If one does not take in all at once the rose blotches at the bottom, the chromatic dip in intensity at top centre, and the hand prints (notice these are all incidents near the framing edges), then one does not really experience the utter wholeness of effect that the painting has. By contrast, One: Number 31, 1950 looms too large, is too even and compact, for there to be the same kind of intactness (Fig. 15). The surface becomes a matter of controlled distribution of light and colour hues. One might affix to Pollock what Greenberg implies in his description of late Monet, namely, that the avoidance of value contrasts and the expanse of 'sheerly physical space'33 produce a constant shifting of local viewpoints that only works because it is not dampered by the intrusion of a frame that is present at all moments. Towards an ever-greater degree of literalness, and towards the build-up of size - these are the two inclinations of what I have been calling by a kind of shorthand as the nonhuman.34 Paintings like Autumn Ahythm: Number 30, 1950 and One: Number 31, 1950 no longer embody action, it seems to me, but include action as one of their effects. They replace the craft-values of artful construction with a rhythmic separateness and 'endlessness' that attaches to the human only at discrete points and never entirely. Autumn Ahythm, with its magnificent mobility, is just barely able to maintain boundaries despite the whirling and driving force of its thickened line because the canvas exhales breathing space (Fig. 16): 32. Greenberg, Art and Culture, p. 219. 33. Greenberg, Art and Culture, p. 45. 34. This might be the place to locate my disagreement, if one can call it that, with T. 1. Clark. What it amounts to is a difference of emphasis, and some reasons for insisting on the difference. Clark, though his discourse is crammed with qualifications and distinctions, tends to imply that something is lost along the way to the late, large paintings: 'All the same, I would like to argue that Lavender Mist or One or Number l, 1949 are no longer propelled by the myth of entry, action, and immediacy on which the drip paintings were founded.' (Farewell to an Idea, p. 356). It is not that these attributes, uith their masculine undertones, are, in their sublimated (but not fully sublimated) forrn, the only things that can ground the value of abstract art-or, for that matter, that the late paintings lack these attributes entirely. It is only that the inflated scale of the later works seems for Clark to disperse the tighter and more evocative tension of Number 1, 1948-with its sheer smallness and humanness, and its pathos. Witness this statement: 'I think Number 1, 1948 contains contraries within itself, in a way that One does not . . .tI do notl want a criticism that posits contained contrariness as aesthetic quality. Though I agree with Longinus that some such push-and-pull is what most effectively generates passion in art . . . And passion, for modernism, is what art is ultimately made of. Of course modernism has many modes. I admire its coldness and craftsmanship as well as its pathos. But pathos is its deepest note, I think.' (Farewell to an Idea, p. 314). Clark's preference for Number 1, 1948 is also mixed with his tendency to read the 1950 paintings as an endgame of Pollock's production (something I vvill address shortly), and with a feeling that the erenness of the later paintings is on the side of decorativeness - or at least that it more palpably threatens that, even if size becomes a practical obstacle to hanging the paintings in the stock salon setting. My contention is only that there might be grounds for insisting on something other than pathos as a guiding imperative of Pollock's paintings - that if vwe remove ourselves from the standard psychological categories by which we discriminate value, affects of a rather different order make themselves available. Pathos amounts to a very limited rhetoric or expressixe register for admitting the powers of a given will - a will whose strength we have taken pains to show touches upon nonhuman sources. v-Hw- ---; Flg. 15.

The black lines form something like arabesques so that pressure on the line to maintain itself within his huge canvas manages to let playful activity also establish stabilizing form. In fact this linearib seems so secure in its own motion that it manages to spin off similar linear gestures in the aluminum and the much more subdued light brown forms.35 But again, one can only occupy that breathing space at a distance. One is not supposed to identify with its expansiveness without feeling it pull away, differentiate itself, and flatten. Its organic necessity is only ours by extension, and we fit but haply in its motions. On more than one occasion, Pollock enjoins the excellences of what he calls endlessness. In his painting, 'there is no accident, just as there is no beginning and no end'.36 But of course, the metaphor of endlessness equivocates. For the peril behind the ideal of the nonhuman is that the endlessness that is the source of the painting's fecundity turns quite imperceptibly into the endlessness of production, that is, production's inability to possess itself in its end. The technical logic undergirding the production of the nonhuman is capable of going on endlessly. But what distinguishes Pollock through and through is the desire to discover or conceive metaphors of totality sufficiently expansive to display the resistance to human-centred design while not losing out on human sources of value. I have found it justified to use the term 'nonhuman' merely as a way of folding under one name a set of descriptive terms and evaluative principles whose criteria may be said - not in any way that is foreordained - to map out a central direction of Pollock's production. Pollock's 1950 paintings show what happens when this logic tests the limits for achieving its own ends. 'Endlessness' hazards that the metaphors produced will no longer have a claim on the human sufficient to the painter's immense ambition. It hazards that its connection to the literal could break into hypostatisation. Certainly we do not think the paintings themselves succumb to this consequence; we merely think that they open themselves up to this final, unacceptable direction. To make the further extrapolation - to argue that there is something inherently teleological OXFORD ART JOURNAL 27.1 2004 21</page><page sequence="20">Omri Moses and contradictory in engaging the nonhuman - is in my view to succumb to a teleological formulation that the nonhuman itself resists, though its echo may have been powerful enough to kill a painter. In Pollock, we are accustomed to read the 1950 paintings as the end of a line. But to claim that for this reason the nonhuman could not be expected to continue - that it reached its consummation with Autumn Rhythm and One: Number 31, 1950-is not to take seriously the singular sources of its value. 22 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 27.1 2004</page></plain_text>
