      <p>The first question with which one is confronted in the representation of space flight is one it shares with some other genres, such as tragedy, for example, namely, why should we take pleasure in the contemplation of what must be among the most painful and uncomfortable, constricting, claustrophobic physical experiences recorded by human beings? There must be more to this fascination than simple Schadenfreude, one feels, more than the witnessing of all this from the safety of the reader’s armchair or the seat in the movie theater; and yet adventure has always been associated with the representation of extreme peril from a distance—the dangers of the open sea in a storm, the pursuit by ferocious enemies; the more improbable the hero’s challenges, the greater our sedentary enjoyment, which is warm when the hero is freezing and pleasantly cool when he sweats in the great heat of the desert or in the tropics with their hordes of biting insects.</p>
      <p>Yet initially none of this is at stake in spaceflight, in which only spatial misery is involved: the tiny cabin in which the astronaut is condemned to sit (and, indeed, as in <italic>The Right Stuff,</italic> to urinate) like a prisoner in one of those terrible dungeon chambers in which one can neither stand up nor stretch out. Here the principal danger is not yet an alien but the incompetence of the scientists who thought up the spacecraft in the first place and the stupidity of the astronauts who (as <italic>The Right Stuff</italic> [dir. Philip Kaufman, 1983] also makes clear) may push the wrong button or fail to grasp the nature of the challenge. This implied rebuke of a universal human incompetence may not exactly be the best material for adventure stories, in which generally the boy hero outwits his pursuers and ingeniously manages to overcome all obstacles.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile it is not merely the interior of the spacecraft that is inhospitable to the imagination of adventure but its external surroundings as well; nothing can surely be more dreary than outer space when you have removed that first awestricken gaze at the stars or at light (“God, what a heavenly light!”). Even speed cannot be registered in this emptiness, and Stanley Kubrick’s transcendental hyperspeed overdrive has not worn any better than its more mass‐cultural versions or than its equivalents in the superhuman attempts at the mutation of human perception and of color in modernist painting or photography.</p>
      <p>All of which confronts us with a curious dialectic: that between adventure and boredom. Why should not the epic of space or moon flight be the most excruciating of narrative representations, the most tedious rather than the more exciting? Or perhaps we need to look at the matter from another direction: perhaps it is the very blankness of this raw material and the possibilities it offers that allows the narrative of spaceflight to inscribe all kinds of different things, a surface on which quite different matters than those of space and technology might be registered.</p>
      <p>It is for example noteworthy that even in Georges Méliès’s original <italic>Le Voyage dans la Lune</italic> (1902), itself as satiric as <italic>Cyrano de Bergerac,</italic> the space vessel is deployed, not in order to pass through sheer emptiness, but rather to register and traverse the four earthly elements of earth, air, fire, and water. It is a recording device for those all‐too‐human experiences of the physical world we know already—the hot and the wet, flying and falling. Like the rides in amusement parks it offers the prenarrative satisfactions of extreme corporeal perceptions and sensations. At the very least, then, we may conclude that such films are experiments in an essentially spatial form, a form dedicated to the exploration, not so much of what is called outer space, as rather of phenomenological space as such and thereby of the camera’s capacity to register it and perhaps even to change or alter it.</p>
      <p>But there are any number of ways to make the spatial appear, and they do not all take the form of direct representation. This is indeed what is fascinating about Fritz Lang’s <italic>Frau im Mond </italic>(1929), where the ostensible space theme is delayed so long as to produce a new sense of the spatial by puzzlement and generic confusion, in a kind of strange inversion of that “distraction” that Walter Benjamin famously took to be our privileged mode of experiencing architecture. Indeed the Berlin sections of the movie—almost half!—show us, instead of spaceships and lunar flight, drawing rooms and attics, domestic servants, learned societies, police, spies, robberies, and the like—all the trappings of Lang’s other thrillers. The spectator’s reaction is not merely one of impatience: will we ever set forth for the moon? where is the technology of space rockets? why is Lang wasting time like this? or is he in fact not really very interested in science fiction as such? What also begins to happen here is that the domestic interior, which Lang rendered so brilliantly in all these early films, becomes gradually drawn inside the spaceflight motif and is itself radically estranged. It is as though our apartments and our middle‐class habits were themselves merely habituated forms of space travel, Earth being itself a kind of rocket ship or space vessel—Berlin and Weimar Germany themselves being immense space pods propelled on their way to an unknown destination. The moon‐shot motif then becomes a means to a very different end, a technique of unconscious defamiliarization in the service of Lang’s extraordinary realism of the material environment or context (a realism nowhere better underscored than in the very opening of <italic>The Testament of Dr. Mabuse</italic> [1932] with its unparalleled use of sound and musique concrète). This means that the spaceship itself, when we get to it, will seem rather flimsy as a set and somehow unworthy of this intense gaze and inspection Lang has forced us to develop as spectators. (I will say something more about this antiquated quality of the spaceship’s interior in a moment, however.) But then the oneiric ending, in which the woman reappears—but in reality or as a strange hallucinatory image?—foregrounds the very melancholy of the form itself, the absolute isolation and solitude of the spacecraft reproduced in this abandonment on the moon, an affect or <italic>Stimmung</italic> that is present, unheard, a kind of ground bass, in all spaceflight narratives (even where, as in <italic>2001,</italic> it is reversed by fiat and will power into a kind of manic or delirious metaphysical optimism). David Bowie’s wonderful song “Major Tom,” about an astronaut lost spinning around the earth in his “tin can,” might serve as the background music for this sadness of the loss of earth.</p>
      <p>But even in more generically orthodox spaceflight films the production of the spatial does not always lie where we might expect it, something we might illustrate by way of John Carpenter’s <italic>Dark Star</italic> (1974). I think it’s wrong to see this film merely as a spoof of space‐travel movies in general and of <italic>2001</italic> in particular. The parody of the existential is existential in itself, for one thing; what is funny about the dreariness is itself dreary, and that preserves the freshness of what would otherwise age and deteriorate as rapidly as what it sets out to mock.</p>
      <p>But I’m more interested in other features of the movie and, in particular, what it does with that inner claustrophobic space of the ship itself. The joke about the alien pet, as round as a soggy football, in fact initiates something like a phenomenology of space, whose very humor is itself derived from the properties of the latter. In English we talk about a square peg in a round hole; this is a round ball inside a square space (the squareness of the space itself a paradox for this presumably oval‐shaped spaceship). In older painting, deep into the tradition of Western mural or oil paint itself, it was the peculiar shape and properties of the human body that had to be somehow fit inside the more geometrical properties of the painted surface and of other objects more easily reduced to geometry. I’m thinking of Piero di Cosimo’s rounded limbs, a kind of anticipation of Fernand Léger; I’m also thinking of the great circle of the golden section as a myth whereby the problem is rationalized away, and the human body is alleged to be in perfect harmony with the ratios of geometry.</p>
      <p>In film, then, it is not so much the body that is at stake as rather precisely those geometrical proportions themselves, as they fit into the square or rectangular screen, on a plane surface. So the flabby alien volleyball also bounces around the square screen, off its edges, and within its cubelike dimensionality.</p>
      <p>But now it is finally time to turn to the greatest of spaceship movies. A friend has observed that everything in our conception of outer space and its representation changed forever when we experienced the opening sequence of <italic>Star Wars,</italic> and the underside of an immense spaceship crossed the screen ominously over our heads to the sound of John Williams’s unforgettable music. But with Lucas we are already in the whole new world of special effects; and our own starting point here must be somewhat earlier, in Kubrick’s truly epoch‐making <italic>2001</italic> (1968), a film that changed a good deal more than visual effects and their possibilities.</p>
      <p>Yet Carpenter’s phenomenological play serves neatly to foreground the inventory of inner‐screen peculiarities assembled in Kubrick’s moon shuttle: the pen that lifts mysteriously out of the sleeping director’s fingers and floats gracefully in what is now a new kind of space until the equally graceful hostess gracefully plucks it out of weightlessness; or the Velcro sandals (themselves a novelty in that period) that secure the hostess’s own traction as the giant screen itself revolves in space and shows itself to be weightless. These are the figures or the tropes of the screen space, which is to be identified as new, and at the same time they document the claims of the film itself, of <italic>2001,</italic> to be something new under the sun, a new kind of filmmaking, which at least defends its claim long enough for Carpenter to make fun of it (and in fact remains as fresh today as when it first appeared, probably because although these spatial experiences are long since familiar, they have never passed into our daily lives to the degree that has the space of say Tati’s <italic>Playtime </italic>[1968]).</p>
      <p>But of course <italic>2001</italic> introduces the whole question of so‐called special effects in the cinema (and Carpenter’s parody in effect does the same by underscoring what low‐budget sets and costumes look like after the onset of the special‐effects revolution, which will rise to new heights with Lucas’s <italic>Star Wars</italic> in 1977); no more astronauts in <italic>Star Trek</italic>‐type pajamas or tacky studio sets of the spaceship control room (itself abolished in Carpenter’s even more claustrophobic space, which is then symbolically reenacted within the film by the astronaut who isolates himself from all the others in his internal space turret—a kind of allegory of the space film in general). Nothing prepared us for <italic>2001,</italic> certainly nothing in the SF tradition, and nothing was quite the same after it. It has retained an extraordinary power, but now, thirty‐five years later, we may be in a position to observe, first, that that power is no longer perhaps the same as it was on that first opening day (which also represented something like the opening day of the world itself); and, second, that it has not exactly worn well and that something of its contemporary power has little enough to do with what amazed people and what was praised in the early years. For example, I will want to express the opinion that its special effects—or at least its setting and its imitation technology—are as cheesy and as dated as any of the now‐meretricious modern effects in 1960s films—effects imitated with loving detail by Terry Gilliam in <italic>Brazil</italic> (1985)—and as shoddy as the men’s long hair or women’s short skirts, along with the garish film color, of those years. I want to add as hastily as possible that it doesn’t matter and that those anachronistic fashions have no impact on the sheer filmic power I mentioned. But they put us on the track of something: what if all spaceship technology were dated by essence and in its very nature? These are, after all, objects that are outside the world, virtually by definition. It is not only that they can play no role in daily life but also that they do not correspond to human bodies or Earth’s space; they are alien to any phenomenology of the lifeworld and can never be humanized by it, as, say, cell phones have been, or automobiles, or computers—a point reinforced by the inevitable and necessary obsolescence of real technologies, which must change from one space shot or capsule to the next, leaving the previous stage as historically antiquated as its filmic representation. What I meant to say here is not only that such objects are of a radically different ontological kind from the human inventions that have historically been introduced, as realities, into our human lifeworld and that therefore speak to us as full forms of being from their ancient photographs: the railroad engine of the nineteenth century, the automobiles of more than ten decades, even the various photographic technologies themselves, cameras and equipment ranging from the cumbersome to the digital. But even the photographs of the great standing space vessels do not have that effect of the real, probably because for the most part they only exist as images and indeed mostly as filmic images at that. But I want to go further than this and to affirm that it is just such unworldly objects, just such strange and unreal visualities, that are the most open to the ravages of fashion, that are the most subject to the rapid aging inherent in the aesthetic modes and styles they have, by virtue of their very nature as objects, soaked up and been wholly drenched in. The spaceships and their contents are not time capsules; they are nothing but the contents of the time capsules as such; they are sheer zeitgeist, sheer period style and little else—and this from Méliès all the way to Kubrick. They cannot but be dated; and to try for a realistic film sequence of spaceship materiality as such, for its redemption as a material world (as in Kracauer), or its ontological registering (as in Bazin), is an impossible project, a contradiction in terms. There can be no realism of the space film and no modernism either except for the most trivial and uninspired kind, worthy of the basement storage of the Museum of Modern Art.</p>
      <p>But what is then the secret of such films, which we go on watching with more than pleasure? Perhaps <italic>2001</italic> can put us on the track. Surely this is a play of visual geometries of a well‐nigh abstract intensity that might well make us rue the ill‐considered remark about modernisms. It is noteworthy that there are always three objects in relationship here and not a one‐on‐one of two and of conventional representation; the latter, the mirror image, reflection in its worst sense, <italic>Widerspiegelung</italic> and the like, is certainly present, but it lies in the television screen, which epitomizes inauthentic geometry and which the film undertakes tirelessly and in a seemingly endless series of variations to discredit and I might even say to undermine ideologically. No, the authentic spatial relationship, the setting of three objects in coordination, the triangulation of space, if you like, is given its strong form at the beginning of part two, when the space shuttle is glimpsed, not only against the immense surface of earth, but also against the rotation of the great heavenly wheel of the space station itself, which seems to have called up the waltz by its own organic movement, out of the very spinning of its being itself. No doubt, as in the various eclipses, the primal form of the triad lies in the relationship of earth, sun, and moon; but we recover it again when the space pod leaves the Discovery in order to rescue Frank’s spinning body in its spacesuit as it dwindles into a speck in outer space. We may note in passing that what is evocative about the pod is not the modernity of its appearance or its technology but rather the threatening anthropomorphic character of its two segmented arms. Indeed, its approach to the dead Frank is a good deal more threatening, for reasons we will see in a moment, than the assault of the other pod on his living body, which it disconnects from his life‐support systems in an attack we do not witness.</p>
      <p>At any rate, the construction, in <italic>2001,</italic> of triadic space or rather the very construction of deep screen space by triangulation is so powerful as to overcome the nature of its contents; now, as part of this triadic system, it does not matter how childish the Lego ship may appear or how dated its equipment or its technology. The three triumphantly overcome the dyad of spectator and image, and it would certainly be worth speculating on the philosophical nature of these numerical operations and perceptions (which Lacan would no doubt have characterized as the overcoming of the dual relationship of the Imaginary by the triple order of the Symbolic).</p>
      <p>We might also have dwelt a moment on the nature of the filmic <italic>gestus</italic> as such, which has little enough to do with expression in its anthropomorphic sense, with the human face or any other anthropomorphisms. I was fascinated for a long time, without any tangible results, by the empty swinging trays in Sergei Eisenstein’s <italic>Battleship Potemkin </italic>(1925), which seemed to me the very epitome of the gestus of film: a purely visual/spatial signifier without any obvious human meaning, but not a language of objects either, whatever that might be. Here, however, in Kubrick I have remembered for over thirty years the way in which, in that initial hominid episode, the dry white bones fly into the air with their dust as the first humanoid warrior strikes them with his first weapon. They are scattered on the barren ground, the remains of the dead animals that once shared the earth with what was not yet Man. Now he flails into them, batters them over and over again, as he will shortly batter the Abel who is his first victim; and the broken pieces of bone fly up and fall back, in a little rain of shards, which imitate the crescent moon both in their own shapes and in the shape of their trajectories in the air. It is a movement Kubrick himself underscores when, in the final moment, the transition, the bone‐weapon of the aggressor is flung up into the sky and becomes the space shuttle, in a historical continuity that Adorno called the “straight line from the slingshot to the mega‐ton bomb.” But here we have a different kind of geometry, that of the crescent shape itself, as it gets added to the spheres of the triadic constructions.</p>
      <p>After which some kind of comment on the geometry of the megalith becomes unavoidable. I have already commented on the way in which certain shapes are incompatible with their media; such was, for example, the human body in the “objectal” perspective that developed on flat surfaces—canvas or wood—in the Renaissance and that determined ingenious and productive solutions in order to assimilate this “foreign body” to its surroundings. Think of the tubelike figures of Uccello or in modern times of Léger.</p>
      <p>Here, in <italic>2001,</italic> we have a different type of incompatibility. We have already observed the tension between the organic and the technological in films like <italic>Silent Running</italic> (1971)(which is of course a derivative of <italic>2001,</italic> the director himself being involved in making the latter), where this alternation takes on a more purely ideological form. And perhaps we might dwell for another moment on this more frequent occurrence, since there is a way in which a renewed ideology of nature emerges from it. Such would, for example, be my own judgment on Tarkovsky, where as I’ve pointed out elsewhere a whole mystique of nature and the elements—fire, the seepage of water in the forests, the dacha and its grounds, as they appear miraculously in the midst of the waves of <italic>Solaris</italic>—all this, which is the result of advanced technology in the apparatus of the camera itself, in film stock, in image production, has here in Tarkovsky been passed off as the stand‐in for nature as such, whereas in fact it is as technological and as humanly and historically produced as all modern plants and vegetables, emerging from the field grasses of the Paleolithic era. This is the sense in which <italic>Silent Running</italic> is somewhat more explicit, even though it exploits the pathos of the disappearance of nature much more openly and is a kind of ecological propaganda; for although its lush vegetation is given as natural, its manner of growth within the spaceship and its domes very clearly calls this immediate reaction into question.</p>
      <p>But in <italic>2001</italic> space is not natural in that sense. The galactic void certainly does not convey any sense of nature as it was developed out of essentially European traditions and cultural and poetic genealogies; nor is the archaic state of the prehuman earth, with its bloody sunsets and its stillness, apt to convey nature much more vividly and nostalgically than the moon itself. Space is here, as we have said, constructed by triangulation out of a relationship of geometrical figures. Yet those figures have their own specific logic and derive from a limited number of solids, which are spheres and crescents, rounded shapes, very much including the elongated tube and the domed pods and control stations of the spaceship <italic>Discovery</italic> itself. Remember that even the initial weapons, the dry bones of the animals, were rounded and ovoid in their shapes. It is against this logic that the megalith, a rectangular form, is in stark dissonance, even when—especially when—the sliver of the moon appears over its ceiling and at the top of its wall‐like surface in the effect of a kind of eclipse. This is indeed, I want to say, something like the geometrical message or drama of the film, this clash between the flatness—the edges and the corners of the rectangle—and the various spheres that people an empty depth itself in the sharpest contrast with the surface of the megalith, which closes more than it opens. It will gradually then become clear from this description that I think the megalith has become the stand‐in for the movie screen itself, for the flatness of the surface upon which the various images, of whatever depth or perspective, of whatever content, are projected. The megalith then becomes a form of autoreferentiality in which the filmic process introduces itself and its own inner constitutive tensions. Indeed it could be argued, although I will not go so far, that the various mutations it calls forth in its human or hominid witnesses are then themselves symbolic representations of some immense mutation attributed to cinema and what its invention and development has done to our lived realities. <italic>2001</italic> thus tells the story of its own revolutionary position in film history; it is its own megalith, a monument to its own extraordinary impact on the whole tradition, proposing a break with Hollywood more fundamental than any of the partial innovations that had gone before. This would be a megalomaniac delirium indeed, one not ill‐suited to Kubrick’s own gigantism and ambitions; but it can in fact be confirmed in terms of the testimony of two other features of this film.</p>
      <p>The first confirmation has already been touched on briefly; it is the status of the image, and in particular the televised image, throughout the narrative. We do not have to go back to Lacan’s thesis of the aggressivity of the mirror image as it is played out between the great apes in the first sequence. The paid televised communication system of the space shuttle is enough, in which the bland bureaucrat interacts with his childish daughter, herself embarrassed by the visual form of the communication; the cost in dollars and cents of the televisual call then completes the trivialization of this new technology, which is of a piece with the other technological wonders on offer in this episode: the Velcro shoes, which enable the stewardess of the future to negotiate weightlessness as well as the modification of her coordinates; the space food ingested through an interesting complex of tubes; and so on. These marvels, which might have come out of a set of Toffler predictions of the future in the mid 1950s, are part and parcel of what is both meretricious and dated in the film’s apparatus, as we have already said; but they are also in dialectical relationship with the blandness of the bureaucracy that rules this future world, a convergence with the Soviets, which includes suspicion but places more emphasis on culture shock than on the cold war and which the most innocuous diplomatic conversation buries so deep it is scarcely perceptible any longer—a peculiar outcome for that first technological innovation of the great apes that seemed to intensify and perfect aggressivity rather than attenuate it. I have not mentioned the background music so far, something so deeply integrated into <italic>2001 </italic>that it stands as a good deal more than a mere case study of the integration of sound and image in this medium. I think that the accents of the “classics,” in the horrible sense in which Adorno denounced the American term <italic>classical music,</italic> are also a commentary on this new culture of the technological age, which is in effect denounced by <italic>2001</italic>—one of its greatest products and a monument to its advances—by way of its longing for a mutation that will take us out of this stage of commodification into something else altogether: a new birth, a new momentum across galactic space. The much more dramatic use of seeing, HAL’s lipreading, the family interview on the <italic>Discovery,</italic> and the other versions of a televisual image, also confirm this denunciation of a mere image culture in the name of whatever else the megalith itself stands for.</p>
      <p>The other visual testimony has to do with the deeper innovations of this film as such, which is indeed in some more fundamental sense profoundly antifilmic; here then the megalith denounces, not merely television and Lacan’s Imaginary, but film itself, with whose screen it can never coincide. But the denunciation centers on the lie of continuity as such, on the illusions of movement generated by the rapid succession of the so‐many‐frames‐a‐minute. Even montage, Eisenstein’s punch in the eye, drew its power from its reinforcement of the narrative line and from the way in which it constructed narrative and narrative time out of so many building blocks. Narrative and temporal continuity are to be sure not absolutely inseparable from each other, but, along with history itself, they surely entertain a deep and even philosophical relationship. Indeed, what could be more historical than Kubrick’s great epic of human history from mutation to mutation? But a little thought suffices to see how profoundly discontinuous are the film’s four parts, like so many separate photos or cross sections pinned up side by side: ape, bureaucrat, astronaut, star child.</p>
      <p>In fact, this discontinuity cuts deep into the film itself, which can now be grasped as a series of stills rather than as any edited illusion of continuity or of continuous action: the great apes at dawn, at noon, at dusk, asleep—so many still frames registered by some vast photographic intelligence outside of time. The ostensibly narrative sections can then be seen to be themselves so many juxtapositions: the bureaucrat’s story little more than a series of gadgets and their little trick numbers, the whole soothingly orchestrated by the immense circular movement of the waltz of the space stations. As for Bowman and Frank and HAL, it is noteworthy to what degree this exciting adventure is governed by the ellipsis rather than the dramatic representation. I have already observed that Frank’s murder is not shown, it is deduced from the before and after—the space walk followed by the body spinning off into the infinite distance. But the most notable of such ellipses is yet to come; and this is the moment to note that the ellipsis is also the silence of action, the silence of the narrative—yet this in a literal way. Indeed the whole of <italic>2001</italic> is predicated, not on its remarkable soundtrack, but on the dialectic between sound and its even more shocking silence. Already the prehistoric savannah is brooded over by the stillness of its ominous sunsets and dawns, punctuated only by the songs of birds—astonishing to hear in this world bereft of human beings to hear them. Yet not even the substitution for the melodramatic or soothing music of the sound of human breathing is as astonishing as the moments of absolute silence: Frank and Bowman consulting together in the pod, a false silence penetrated by HAL’s ability to read lips. The truly astonishing silence comes when the hatch door is blown and Bowman’s body propelled forward in a silence so violent as to recalibrate our very notions of action: the smoke of a silent explosion, the instant rather than time itself. But all of these episodic views are lined up one after the other like so many stills, and the deepest silence of all is the one that intervenes between them and that serves as their enigmatic commentary: the neutral itself, the glacial and transcendent inspection of what had to happen that way, of a narrative necessity from which the viewer (and the filmmaker) draw back in icy depersonalization.</p>
      <p>The last sequence draws this logic of stills—which is even more profound in its consequences than the forbidding Chris Marker film <italic>La Jetée</italic> made a few years earlier (1962)—into a new dialectic of point of view, a dialectic at the very heart of the dynamics of film and yet fraught with even greater paradoxes and impossibilities than that legendary and nonexistent “persistence of vision” that seemed to have governed the matter of frames and their continuities. Whatever point of view turned out to be in the novel and in narrative language (and that was scarcely very simple or easy either), in film it is normally represented by its very opposite, namely, the face of the observer as such. Only when the camera follows the observing character from the outside do we understand that we are supposed to be experiencing his or her point of view from the inside. And the few attempts to rectify this ridiculous situation by endowing the camera itself with a first‐person point of view—Welles’s never‐realized <italic>Heart of Darkness</italic> project, Robert Montgomery’s <italic>Lady in the Lake</italic> (1946), the more successful (because only temporary) point‐of‐view opening of Delmer Davies’s <italic>Dark Passage</italic> (1947)—all fail by way of their very literality. So the suture of the shot‐countershot becomes the standard convention, and the scandalous paradox of some properly filmic point of view is quietly rationalized away. But in the final episode of <italic>2001</italic> Kubrick achieves the astounding feat of integrating the paradox of point of view with the paradox of temporal succession of the logic of his photographic stills; now each still becomes the point of view of the next, and Bowman’s rapid passage through the ages of man is a kind of photographic relay in which the external representation is passed on to the later stage, first contemplated by a younger Bowman who then passes into his older self as its new viewpoint—and this with a static dealing out of the temporal moments as with some ultimate card game, played out in the silence of breathing as among hospital equipment, only punctuated by that astonishing thing, the breaking of a glass!</p>
      <p>It is noteworthy that there comes a moment in <italic>The Right Stuff</italic> in which this very different and profoundly American film is confronted by the unavoidable necessity of paying homage to its predecessor, and John Glenn’s historic launch into space is accompanied by the solemn music of Holst’s <italic>Planets</italic> again—for all of us indissolubly associated with <italic>2001</italic>—and his space helmet positioned at the same angle and glistening with the same rainbow streaks of light we had already seen on Bowman’s. But with <italic>The Right Stuff,</italic> a remarkable film in its own right, we paradoxically abandon outer space for the earthbound world of competition, government funding, male bonding, patriotism, science, bureaucracy, and technological innovation; and the dilemmas of spatial representation that governed the filmic engagement with spaceflight come to an end.</p>
