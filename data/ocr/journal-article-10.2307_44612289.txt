ABSTRACT The interaction of the chest of the Hybrid III dummy with the air bag restraint system during a crash is complex. Forces applied to one component of the dummy can generate an unexpected response in a distal part. Motion, both linear and angular, of the pelvis during impact can create an enigmatic spike in the acceleration of the chest. Because significant changes in the chest acceleration response can affect the development of an airbag system, this pelvis-chest interaction is cause for concern. The factors that appear to affect the chest acceleration spike as a result of the pelvis- chest interaction are: the mass moment of inertia of the pelvis, the interaction of the pelvis with the femur, the characteristic of the lumbar spine, and the differential velocity of the pelvis with respect to the chest. INTRODUCTION One approach to developing a passive restraint system, which uses an airbag, is to balance the forces acting on the dummy. The knee bolster restrains the legs and pelvis (the lower half) and the airbag restrains the chest and head (the upper half). However, the upper half and the lower half of the dummy are connected by the lumbar spine; and an interaction between the two almost always exist. This allows either the upper half to manage some of the energy of the lower half or vice versa. In the current Hybrid III dummy, this interaction sometimes can be abnormally high due to the femur-pelvis-lumbar structure of the dummy. As a result, this internal force acts on the thoracic spine and causes high chest acceleration spikes. The femur-pelvis-lumbar-chest interaction phenomenon and its relation to femur-pelvis interference was first described for the Hybrid II dummy [1], where it was found from the vehicle crash tests that spikes in the driver chest acceleration was attributable to a substantial shock when the dummy's upper leg contacted the pelvic structure. Since then a similar phenomenon has been observed in the Hybrid III dummy and modifications of the dummy were suggested. One of the modifications where femur rotation range was increased gave improved results for the modified Hybrid III dummy [2]. The purpose of this paper is to present data and comparison analysis of Hyge sled tests using the Hybrid III, Hybrid II and the Hybrid III with different modifications on the dummy segments. METHODS 1. EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES - Results of several series of sled tests are presented in this paper to evaluate the response of the chest of the Hybrid III dummy due to the pelvis-chest interaction. The dummy response is that of a normally seated passenger occupant subjected to a 30 mph impact. The interaction is documented with a measurement system using linear accelerometers to determine two dimensional (three degrees of freedom) impact response of various segments of the Hybrid II and Hybrid III dummies. The sled tests were performed using a specially designed experimental fixture. Included were passenger air bags, seats, instrument panels, and windshields. The seat was inclined rearward at 22° from the vertical. 2. MOTION ANALYSIS - The motion analysis system employed uses "Spherical Geometric Analysis" (SGA). The complete description of this motion analysis system is beyond the scope of this paper. The following section gives a brief non-rigorous overview; for a more complete explanation, see ref [3,4]. SGA requires four accelerometers arranged in two biaxial clusters separated by a known distance. These clusters can either be attached to a rigid plate and then attached to the dummy or attached directly to a 1283</page><page sequence="2">rigid part of the dummy. The system requires that the two clusters are co-planar and that the orientation of the clusters with respect to each other is known. The four accelerations are processed using the SGA software which outputs angular velocity, angular acceleration and linear acceleration directly. In addition, the linear velocity, displacement and angular position are obtained through integration. The four- accelerometer packs are placed on the chest, pelvis and two femurs of the dummy. 3. HYGE SLED TEST MATRIX - A total of twenty tests in seven sled series were conducted. The test matrix is shown in Table 1. The occupants in all the tests had no seat belts and were restrained by air bags and knee bolsters. The tests were designed to simulate the 30 mph frontal impact of a small car (all series except IV) and a mid-size car (Series IV). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The results are presented in the sequence shown in the test matrix in Table 1. The data are plotted with the SAE sign convention. For linear motion, positive x and z indicate horizontally forward and vertically downward directions, respectively. For angular motion, backward rotation is indicated by positive y using the right hand rule. 1. SIGNATURE OF THE PELVIS-CHEST INTERACTION - Fig. 1 illustrates a typical response signature of an airbag restrained Hybrid III passenger with pelvis-chest interaction obtained from a Hyge 30 mph sled test. The peak chest x acceleration is about 70 G's; the z acceleration spike occurs a couple of milliseconds earlier (Fig. 1(a)). A similar spike is also seen in the head z acceleration (Fig. 1(b)). The femur axial (z) acceleration also shows (Fig. 1(c)) an abrupt drop at about the same time as the pelvis acceleration spikes. If an effective mass of the femur is used to obtain the force and is then compared to the femur axial force from the load cell, it is seen that the load cell force does not drop as the acceleration times mass force does, but increases for the right femur (Fig. 1(d)). This indicates that there is a sudden force from the pelvis acting in the opposite direction of the knee force from the knee bolster. Additional aspects of the signature are shown by the shear and axial forces induced in the lumbar spine (Fig. 1(e)). The x acceleration of the femur shows a "shock" of short duration and high magnitude in the left femur (Fig. 1(f)), which may indicate a metal to metal contact between the femur and pelvis. When the chest x acceleration peak occurs between 70 to 85 milliseconds (Fig. 1(a)), the chest deflection is actually decreasing (Fig. 1(g)), which may suggest that the acceleration is not due to the external (airbag) force, but the internal force acting on the thoracic spine box by the lumbar spine. Examining the time of the spikes reveals that the femur z acceleration, upper pelvis x and z accelerations (Fig. l(i)(j)) and the lumbar shear and axial forces occur the earliest; then the "shock wave" transmits upward to the chest, consequently through the neck (Fig. 1(h)) to the head (Fig. 1(b)) in the vertical direction. With the additional accelerometers installed in the dummy, it is possible to obtain the linear and angular motion of the rigid body segments as shown in Fig. 2. Before 50 milliseconds, the dummy's head, chest and pelvis basically translate. The femurs begin to rotate upward at 20 milliseconds when the dummy's feet are stopped (Fig. 2(a)). When the femurs impact the knee bolster at 50 milliseconds (Fig. l(c)(d)), the pelvis begins to rotate forward, with increasing angular velocity after 60 milliseconds, while the femurs continue to rotate upward toward the pelvis (Fig. 2(a)). At 76 milliseconds, the femurs have rotated with respect to the pelvis about 48° to reach their maximum and stopped abruptly (Fig. 2(b)). Afterward the pelvis reverses direction but the femurs keep rotating and rising in the same direction (Fig. 2(a)(c)). This is the so called "femur-pelvis interference". The best indication of the interference is probably the pelvis angular acceleration as shown in Fig. 2(d). Normally, without interference, the pelvis angular acceleration should be less than 3000 rad/sec2. In the same figure, the high angular acceleration is also shown in the femurs in the opposite direction. The smaller angular acceleration seen in the right femur as compared to the left suggests that it is subjected to a smaller interaction force without the metal to metal contact as seen in the z acceleration in Fig. 1(f). Although the available rotation range for the left femur is larger than that for the right femur [2], it does not mean that the interference will always start from the right side. Finally, the chest also receives a large angular acceleration at the time of the linear acceleration spike. 2. TESTS USING HYBRID III WITH MODIFIED FEMUR-PELVIS STRUCTURE - The purpose of the modification on the femur bone is to increase the femur to pelvis rotation range. The modification was based on the work of SAE Hybrid III Dummy Family Subcommittee and a similar modification is detailed in ref 2. With that modification the rotation ranges have been increased from about 45° for the left hip and 30° for the right hip to 48° for both to avoid the femur-pelvis interference. Three sled tests were conducted with one test using the Hybrid III dummy as a comparison baseline and the other two tests using the modified Hybrid III. The data are shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3(a) shows that the modified Hybrid III gives about 8 G reduction in the chest acceleration resultant. The pelvis angular accelerations is shown in Fig. 3(g); and the lumbar forces and moment are shown in Fig. 3(d)(e)(f). It is seen that all the acceleration spikes and the lumbar force spikes have been reduced and delayed for the modified dummy. The pelvis angular acceleration is reduced by about 50% and the peak delayed by about 5 milliseconds (Fig. 3(g)). Fig. 3(h) shows that the passenger pelvis rotates forward about 10° more with the modified dummy and reaches its maximum about 5 milliseconds later. In other words, the modification did not completely eliminate the interference; 1284</page><page sequence="3">it just reduced it by providing more time for slowing down the femur-pelvis impact. It is reasonable to conclude that in a more severe impact case, the interference may still be significant. Two more series of sled tests (4 each) were conducted. The first series was to simulate a small car with passenger only and the second a mid-size car with both driver and passenger. A new Hybrid III pelvis was used with the same modified femur-pelvis structure as the one presented above. The results for the first series are shown in Fig. 4 and second series in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. In the second series, the modified dummy reduces the data spikes drastically for all the tests, both driver side (Fig. 5) and passenger side (Fig. 6). It is interesting to note that before the interference the Hybrid III and the modified Hybrid III already respond differently. The modified dummy's pelvis rotates much slower and has a smaller rotation (Fig. 4(c)(d), Fig. 5(c)(d) and Fig. 6(c)(d)), which is different from what was seen in the previous test series. The femur upward rotation has been similar for all the cases in each series. The data also show that the femur-pelvis-chest interaction is sensitive with the higher variation for the unmodified Hybrid III. For the second set, it is clear that the passenger side (Fig. 6(b)) has the interference for all the unmodified Hybrid III tests while for the driver side, only one of the test exhibits the interference (Fig. 5(b)). In these two sled series, the different behavior of the two dummies before the femur-pelvis interference occurs may be due to the difference in aging and repeated usage of the dummies. Comparing the new (modified) and the old (unmodified) dummies, two areas are more likely to cause the pelvis rotation variation. The first one is located in the femur and pelvis interaction interface. Flexible vinyl materials in old dummies are likely to be torn, deformed or degraded in the pelvis and femur contact area. The second area is in the pelvis molding foam on the buttocks which supports the weight above the pelvis and is inherently unstable [5]. 3. TESTS USING HYBRID III AND HYBRID II - Although the interference occurs in the femur and pelvis, it depends on the lumbar spine to transmit the force to the upper torso. Therefore the lumbar spine plays an important role in the chest-pelvis interaction. Current design of the Hybrid III and Hybrid II uses a rigid thoracic spine and flexible lumbar spine. Since both thorax and lumbar flexibility is "lumped" into the lumbar spine, it is reasonable to use a more flexible lumbar spine. In cases with severe chest-pelvis interaction, the Hybrid II may have a higher biofidelity. Comparison tests [6] on the lumbar shear stiffness between the Hybrid III and the Hybrid II shows that the Hybrid III lumbar is about 2.5 times as stiff in shear as the Hybrid II lumbar. Recent comparison tests of the Hybrid III lumbar and the cadaver lumbar also indicate that the former is much stiffer than the later for the complete lumbar test and for the higher loading case [7]. With the more flexible lumbar, the shear and axial force transmitted to the thoracic spine can be significantly reduced and so can the chest acceleration. In this series of sled tests, there were four tests: 2 tests using the Hybrid III and 2 tests using the Hybrid II. The test results are compared in Fig. 7. In comparison to the Hybrid III, the Hybrid II chest accelerations were reduced by about 20 G's as shown in Fig. 7(a). Due to the lumbar spine difference, the initial position of the Hybrid II had a larger backward angle of the thoracic spine and it rotates forward with a larger range as shown in Fig. 7(d). Although it also rotates forward more rapidly (Fig. 7(c)), the angular acceleration is much smaller than that of the Hybrid III (Fig 7(b)). The smaller chest angular acceleration is in conjunction with smaller chest linear acceleration. In the Hybrid III, angular acceleration spikes in the pelvis (Fig. 7(e)) and femur (Fig. 7(h)) proceed the chest acceleration spikes by a couple of milliseconds. These spikes are believed to be the result of the high differential angular velocity between the pelvis and the femur at the time of interaction. In contrast, the Hybrid II differential velocity is less. Its pelvis angular acceleration, velocity and displacement are much smaller (Fig. 7(f)(g)), while the femur angular rotation is about the same (Fig. 7(i)(j)). The Hybrid II dummy can also experience femur-pelvis interaction when subjected to a larger femur to pelvis rotation. However, its chest acceleration generally is smaller than that of the Hybrid III because of the reduced pelvis- femur interaction (explained next) and reduced pelvis-chest interaction. Even in the case when the Hybrid II has the same interaction as the Hybrid III, its chest acceleration should be still smaller because its chest accelerometers are located about 4 inches higher than those in the Hybrid III. With the interaction, the higher located accelerometers in the thoracic spine will sense a lower chest acceleration. As observed previously, the chest angular acceleration has a negative spike at the time of the chest linear acceleration spike. It should be noted that general comparison tests of the Hybrid III and Hybrid II dummies with airbag restraint system shows no significant difference in the chest accelerations [8]. Test results cited [9] even shows that Hybrid II's chest accelerations were 8% to 24% higher than those of the Hybrid III. In those tests, the interaction problem was not identified or taken as a variable. 4. TESTS USING HYBRID III WITH MODIFIED PELVIS WEIGHT - One of the major differences between the Hybrid III and the Hybrid II is the mass distribution in the dummy. For the Hybrid II, the pelvis is about 15 lbs less while its femurs are about 10 lbs more. The smaller rotation of the pelvis in the Hybrid II's impact tests may be partly attributed to this difference. The biofidelity of the Hybrid Ill's pelvis rotation during impact is not clear; however, its moment of inertia is clearly too large since some of the abdominal weight is lumped into the pelvis. This extra weight attached to the top of the pelvis causes a higher center of gravity and consequently larger moment of inertia 1285</page><page sequence="4">and may result in a more severe forward pelvis-femur rotational impact in the Hybrid III. For this test series, the Hybrid Ill's weight (the lead portion of the block) attached to the pelvis top was removed and redistributed to its upper legs. That is about 13 lbs redistribution of the mass. Compared to the unmodified Hybrid III baseline test, the modified dummy has a much lower pelvis angular acceleration (Fig. 8(a)), although it has approximately the same amount of pelvis angular velocity and forward rotation. This means the interaction between the femur and pelvis in the modified Hybrid III is significantly reduced. The difference is also shown in the femur acceleration: the modified Hybrid Ill's femur angular acceleration spikes are not as obvious as that of the unmodified Hybrid III (Fig. 8(d)(e)). As a result, the chest acceleration for the modified Hybrid III is significantly lower (Fig. 8(f)) and the time of the peak delayed. 5. TESTS USING HYBRID III WITH THE HYBRID II LUMBAR SPINE - As demonstrated by tests using the Hybrid II previously, the lumbar spine plays an important role in the chest-pelvis interaction. For this test set, the Hybrid III lumbar spine was replaced by the Hybrid II lumbar spine. The results are compared to the Hybrid III baseline test as shown in Fig. 9. Their pelvis angular motion is similar with an indication of femur-pelvis interference (Fig. 9(a)(b)(c)). However, the one with the Hybrid II lumbar spine has a much lower chest angular acceleration and much lower chest acceleration (Fig. 9(d)(e)). CONCLUSIONS The pelvis-chest interaction and associated chest x and z acceleration spikes are a result of the moment of inertia of the pelvis, the response characteristics of the lumbar spine, and the interaction of the pelvis with the femur. In particular the following observations have been made: 1. Modification of the rotation range of the femur with respect to the pelvis can change the interaction. Increasing the range of motion can reduce or eliminate the interaction in some cases but not all. 2. Changing the center of mass of the pelvis affects its angular motion. When the moment of inertia is changed to reduce the angular acceleration due to femur loading, the pelvis-chest interaction is reduced. 3. The lumbar spine in the dummy plays an important role in the chest-pelvis interaction. A more flexible lumbar can reduce the force transmitted to the thoracic spine from the pelvis and significantly reduce the chest acceleration spike. REFERENCES 1.
