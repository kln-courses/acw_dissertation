<plain_text><page sequence="1">TELEOLOGY IN SCIENCE TEACHING A. J. BERNATOWICZ « Each of us is for good and against evil. For most teachers of science, teleology and anthropomorphism are not issues to be debated but to be deplored—we stand against the evil. In keeping with this attitude, I shall not here debate with any who may have philosophical convictions in favor of teleology; their concept of the good differs from mine. I do intend to challenge those of us who argue against teleology but permit it to appear in our own lectures and ignore it in assigned readings. If science is taught as a body of information, if a science course earns that ever-to-be-prized encomium, "A course with plenty of meat and a hard, solid core of facts," then a certain indifference to frills such as rigorous exclusion of teleology is not surprising, and an obliviousness to imprecise language must be expected. On the other hand, "lightweight" courses, courses designed to meet liberal-arts objectives through an examination of science as an intellectual discipline or through study of scientific attitudes and methods, are likely to contain at least some explicit treatment of these "evils," together with some examples of objectionable phraseology which the stu dent (but not the instructor?) is expected to avoid. When teleological, animistic, or anthropomorphic expressions escape notice in the latter type of course, we should perhaps shrug philosophically and admit that we cannot expect the same perfection in professors that we demand in students. Never theless, whatever the approach to science teaching, careless language seems inconsistent with our pious declarations * Associate Professor of Science, University of Hawaii.

XVII, NO. 1 against "evil." Evidences of careless language are not hard to find in texts, and a random selection to substantiate this point is quoted below. They may be even more common in lectures, although this is more difficult to document since one has so little occasion to listen to his colleagues' lectures and one's own lectures are without blemish! Quiz questions are also likely to be "contaminated"—probably the most unkind cut of all to students. In short, it appears that, despite our almost unanimous disapproval of teleology and anthropo morphism, they are far from lacking in our instructional ma terial and, I will argue, far from absent from our thinking. The Usual Excuses Before reading the evidence, perhaps we should review some of the reasons given by authors and lecturers for their lapses into teleological and similarly "unscientific" lan guage. Commonly, these reasons are accompanied by dis claimers of "evil" intent. First, there is the argument that the objectionable phrase ology is used only to avoid "awkward circumlocution" or "tire some periphrasis." At least in some instances it can be shown that greater rigor can be achieved without awkwardness, and it is debatable whether rigor should be subordinated to sim plicity. Second, the claim is often made that the objection is purely a terminological one, a mere quibble, and that the words under consideration are as suitable as any others. Here we can only counter with the army claim that "if an order can be mis understood, it will be misunderstood." Too often an acri monious dialogue ensues from which it emerges that "I am more rigorous than thou." Third, we hear the excuse that vivid writing or intimate lecturing may justifiably sacrifice rigor in the interests of more effective rapport. Since greater rapport is presumed to in crease learning, we have the paradox that the students are learning best that which we do not want them to learn. Fourth, quiz questions, especially on objective quizzes, are said to require directness and brevity; they are to be ques 64</page><page sequence="3">AUTUMN 1959 TELEOLOGY IN SCIENCE TEACHING tions on course material rather than on ability to read rap idly, and therefore brief teleological or anthropomorphic phrases may be excused "so long as the students know what is required." This interesting philosophy seems to maintain that grades may depend upon students' acceptance of termi nology that the professor would condemn if it came from a student. There is also something pernicious in the attitude that rigor is a luxury we cannot afford when something so im portant as a quiz is in the balance. Examples of Nonrigorous Language With these excuses in mind (and no doubt others can be adduced), let us look at examples taken from texts and books of the sort recommended for collateral reading. That the majority of examples come from books on biology should give little comfort to physical scientists, inasmuch as more biology books than others were conveniently at hand. Even without a thorough inspection, examples were found in every book examined, whether the subject was biology, chemistry, physics, astronomy, or geology. The quoted examples by no means include all those which were noted. Rather uncommon are the explicit statements of goal or purpose, perhaps because such statements are not inadvertent but represent a deliberate attempt to produce some (undis cerned) effect: It [the universe] emerged full-armed, as it were, out of nothing, apparently for the sole purpose of blaz ing its way to an eternal death.1 The structures named in quotation marks £root, stems, leaves of stoneworts} are not anatomically like the true roots, stems, leaves and seeds of higher plants, but they do serve similar purposes and show a remark able degree of differentiation for an alga.2 1 J.

In each of the last three quotations it is intimately involved with outright teleology. In more subtle contexts it is the most common producer of teleological implication. From the above state ments of "goal ... is to reduce" or "purpose is to function," we can continue with a graded series of quotations arranged to show that, regrettably often, to is merely an abbreviation of in order to: Very little is known concerning these forces, except that they must be considerable in order to overcome the normal repulsion between the positively charged particles in the nucleus.6 In combining with other atoms, the atoms of an ele ment strive to attain the stable arrangement of electrons that characterizes the inert atoms of the elements of Group O. {italics in the original]7 Seeds are modified to function as agents in the distri bution of the species.8 3 G.

Of those who insist the matter is one of far-fetched interpretation ("you're quibbling") we may ask at what point in the graded series they can con fidently plan to change a speech habit. And even if they do stop short of undeniable teleology, are they confident that students will do so—that students will not slip into uncritical acceptance of overt as well as subtle teleology? Others may feel that the infinitive in these cases is the most direct and simple mode of expression, and that its avoidance would re quire "awkward circumlocution." There is a simple remedy, however; substitution of and for to is quite sufficient in the majority of instances that are not complicated by other in fections of animism or anthropomorphism. 9 Krauskopf, op. cit., p. 503. 10 L.

XVII, NO. 1 Ideological Thinking And it is this very point, that generally a mere substitu tion of and for to will eliminate the most common ex amples of teleological phrases, which disclose the real danger behind the use of these phrases in our teaching. The danger is not that we teach "unscientific" terminology but that we are actually thinking teleologically and communicating these modes of thought to students. How else can we interpret the circumstance that, when two sentences differing in but a word can be formulated (compare "hydrogen and oxygen combine to form water" with "hydrogen and oxygen combine and form water"), we apparently find it easier to formulate the one with teleological overtones? If the alternative formula tion appears awkward, it would seem that the awkwardness is not due to circumlocution but to interference with our pre dilection for certain modes of thought. To return to the evidences of objectionable expressions in books, let us note another too frequently employed word, for. This time the series is arranged to show the more subtle usage first and the overt examples at the end: They [insects] have solved the problem of flight, which gives them immense advantages for dispersal, for seeking out appropriate growing places for their young.14 Resting spores of the akinete type, which are struc tures for tiding the alga over unfavorable periods, usually germinate into a vegetative filament as soon as favorable conditions return.15 In the insectivorous or carnivorous plants, e.g., Venus flytrap, bladderwort, and pitcher-plant, leaves are modi fied for the capture of insects and other animals.18 There has to be some sort of mechanism for raising sap [in trees], and energy is lavishly expended in the process.17 14 M.

One which is almost at that status in biology is store and its derivatives. Store connotes provision for the future—purposeful accumulation. A better choice is accumu late (or its derivatives), since it is noncommital concerning purpose or intent. Although it may be claimed that store in the biological sense has a special and irreproachable meaning, it is to be doubted whether students change their understand ing of the word when they enter and leave the classroom. Of the next four examples, those combining store with reserve or junction are especially likely to lead students astray, but none of the examples would suffer if accumulate were substituted: [In a description of food chains] Others, the con sumers, will be present because, directly or indirectly, they can utilize the food and its energy which is pro vided by the producers, whether it is an excess they have stored or the producer itself, usually after death.20 Starch is stored by plants in tubers, seeds, and fruits, and a similar substance called glycogen is stored by animals in the liver.21 18 H.

XVII, NO. 1 In some plants, e.g., Portulaca and century plants, the thick leaves function as water storage organs.22 Cells of Dinophyceae store their photosynthetic re serves as starch or as oil.23 Somewhat akin to the question of accumulate versus store is the substitution by many biologists of interphase for resting phase. Curiously, the objection to resting phase as applied to a nucleus has generally been that the nucleus is quite active metabolically during this phase. But, irrespective of whether or not the nucleus is active, the very notion of a nucleus resting between divisions should have been considered to be far too anthropomorphic. Yet despite the twofold argument against resting phase, this phrase retains some degree of cur rency, presumably because it is considered a technical ex pression. Even if careful biologists are willing to substitute inter phase for resting phase they have no similarly easy choice for various other words which impart more or less technical meanings—for example, dominance, competition, selection, and junction. If not carefully used, such words lose the re spectability granted to technical terms and communicate their intrinsic connotations of anthropomorphism, animism, or tele ology. This is, I think, apparent in connection with junction in some of the previous quotations. Selection, for which some biologists expect absolution because its unfortunate implica tions are freely admitted, is hardly innocuous when it is described as entailing a choice by the environment, as in the following: Artificial selection is a process similar to natural selection, except that the variants that leave the greater progeny are chosen by man rather than by the general environment, [italics in the original}24 Perhaps these examples from biology textbooks represent merely unfortunate choices of words for concepts which are 22 Hardin, op. cit., p. 531. 23 Smith, op. cit., I, 151. 24 Sinnott, Dunn and Dobzhansky, op. cit., p. 247. 70</page><page sequence="9">AUTUMN 1959 TELEOLOGY IN SCIENCE TEACHING not in themselves unsound. We can hope so, and leave analysis of the concepts to the philosophers of science, since our present concern is with the words per se and their effect on students' thought. But in physics there is used a familiar word which surely must disturb some thoughtful students, and as for the idea it represents, see what Erwin Schrodinger has to say: . . the notion of force, the most dangerous relic of animism in this science." 26 "Force," a cornerstone of New tonian physics, a word and a concept that pervade our lan guage and our thinking—if this is suspect, then what of the vocabulary of the less exact sciences? Hints at the Supernatural Not the least of the nonrigorous language habits in science teaching is that of implying the activity of a supernatural being. To the beginner, the idea of natural law presupposes a lawgiver, and this extrapolation is confirmed when we state that phenomena occur in obedience to natural laws, or when we imply such obedience by the words must or has to. For example, in one lecture I declared that an excited electron has to give up the absorbed energy when it returns to a lower energy level. A bright student should have pointed out that the electron doesn't have to give up the energy, it just does. In like manner, the idea of a planner may be con jured up by the idea of order or plan in the universe, par ticularly if other words support the inference. Note the mutual reinforcement of plan and constructed: It was he [Copernicus] who revealed to us, in its broad outlines, the plan upon which the Universe is con structed, or at least that part of the Universe which is of most immediate interest to us.26 Or, isn't it a sublimation of tendencies toward super naturalism when nature is personified (deified?): For we know, from ordinary observation, how ex 26 E.

XVII, NO. 1 ceedingly wasteful and haphazard are nature's means of securing her ends.27 These hints at the supernatural call to mind the "why" questions, which, admittedly, are often thought-provokers. Not uncommonly these questions do not provoke beginners into causal thinking, and insofar as they tempt students into seeking reasons other than causes, questions such as the fol lowing would be more appropriately put to a class in meta physics than to one in science: Why, for example, should the proton have eighteen hundred times the mass of the electron? 28 It {Bohr's theory] left unexplained such questions as why an electron preferred a small orbit to a large one, why in its jumps it chose one small orbit in preference to another, why it could not move in other orbits than the discrete ones required by the hypothesis.29 It is very easy to explain to the student that "why" in science requires a mechanistic rather than a teleological answer. It is not so easy to get him to adhere to this require ment, especially in biology. Rare indeed is the student who will explain "why a salmon swims upstream" in mechanistic terms. Incidentally, I have found considerable shock value in confronting classes with two questions in succession: (1) Why does a potted plant bend toward a window? (2) Why does a moth fly into a candle flame? At least temporarily the class realizes the advantage of rephrasing with "what causes . . . ," but more than a single device is needed to overcome the continuous beguilement into teleology, animism, and anthropomorphism to which our students are subjected. I will not attempt to classify the remaining few quoted passages. In addition to the specific words which are objec tionable (italics mine), the general tenor of these passages seems unnecessarily nonrigorous: 27 Sullivan, op. cit., p. 23. 28 Ibid., p. 188. 29 Krauskopf, op. cit., p. 321. 72</page><page sequence="11">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL.

Few of us would offer a brief in support of teleological language, but can't we be tolerant of occasional contaminations? Must our language be made aseptic? I maintain that we should try, and this means giving more than lip service to the attempt. Lip service is not merely insincerity; it may lead to unjustified feelings of security. In one of his expositions of operationalism Bridgman makes a point that applies here. He says, "The true meaning of a term is to be found by observing what a man does with it, not what he says about it." 34 So also, though we say we are against teleology and all the rest, we use these ideas in our language and thereby display the extent to which they affect our thinking. 30 H.

XVII, NO. 1 Suggested Remedies WT HAT CAN we do about it?—other than be more careful, VV that is. Carefulness is a rather passive approach; it may protect students from being led astray, but it is hardly likely to teach them to avoid the pitfalls consciously. If a little class time can be devoted to the problem, it can be a rewarding topic, not only for its own sake, but for its rein forcement of other topics. The following active approaches have been used in a large class (400 students) to sufficient advantage to encourage further attempts. First, we presented justification for our avoidance of the teleological, animistic, and anthropomorphic viewpoints, as follows: (1) When mechanistic explanations are available, tele ology and its allies violate the principle of parsimony. (Point ing this out is one of the easiest means of elucidating the application of Occam's razor.) (2) Teleological and similar elements of explanations are probably never heuristic in the natural sciences. (We used this point to reinforce discussion of the criteria of a good theory.) (3) Questions formulated in teleological and similar styles are "meaningless" in the sense that they are not sus ceptible of scientific investigation, whereas restatement in rigorously mechanistic or operational terms will often indicate the means of attacking the problem. (Substitute what causes in questions that begin with why.) To pursue this active approach, we attacked textbook state ments, some of which are quoted in this article. Sometimes passages were dissected in class; others appeared in examina tion questions. This was disconcerting to some students, who found it unorthodox to challenge the printed word. Since rejection of the method of authority is often taught as a feature of the scientific attitude, we feel that the technique was valuable. It is realized that some will consider such techniques to be distractions from what the author or lecturer is trying to teach. Indeed, the whole matter may be dismissed as a dis 74</page><page sequence="13">AUTUMN 1959 TELEOLOGY IN SCIENCE TEACHING proportionate concern with words at the expense of course content. But what is the lecturer trying to teach? What should be the content of science courses which, usually, pur port to satisfy the objectives of a liberal-arts curriculum? In view of the differences between the traditional content of physics and chemistry and biology, it seems unreasonable to claim that these different contents are equivalent for satisfying liberal-arts requirements. Rather, we should reexamine one of the platitudes—"teach them how to think." If this is what the lecturer hopes to teach, then an occasional distraction from the factual material is not only justified, it is essential. 75</page></plain_text>
