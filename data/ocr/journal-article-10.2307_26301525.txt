<plain_text><page sequence="1">Abraham and Monotheism by Dorothy F. Zeligs It is a rather fascinating task to approach the character study of a biblical figure "with the comparatively new tool of psychoanalysis. So much has been written over hundreds of years in the area of biblical commentary that one may well ask if there is anything new to be added. That is the chal lenge which psychoanalysis offers in this field as in so many others. It often indicates a new perspective and thus leads to a different integration of old material. An intriguing problem presents itself in regard to Abra ham, the first Patriarch of the Hebrews in ancient days, who is popularly known as the founder of ethical monotheism. According to tradition, Abraham took the momentous step of discarding many gods and identifying himself with One God, Who, moreover, had two unique qualities — He was not embodied in material form and He made morality the basis of His relationship with men. The question to be considered here is whether there was any connection between the personality of Abraham as re vealed in biblical and Midrashic* literature and the achieve ments with which he is credited in the field of religion. Such an approach is commonly followed in efforts to understand the creative products of artists and writers. It seems logical to assume that in the area of religion, too, great personalities "The Midrash is a collection of biblical commentary from the first to the eleventh century, with emphasis on the story and parable aspects for homiletic purposes.</page><page sequence="2">294 Dorothy F. Zeligs have been influenced in their insights and beliefs by the character of their psychological drives. The first question that arises is one of historicity. Are we talking about Abraham as a real person or as a mythical figure? This article will assume that Abraham was a real person and will deal with him not only as he is revealed in the Bible but as part of the world in which he lived. Howev er, even if he were considered a mythical figure, he would still be a psychic reality. Psychoanalysis has taught us to be somewhat more respectful of the opinions and beliefs of the "mass mind" as expressed in tradition and myth, and to seek for the psychological truths that underlie them. It could not be mere chance that associated the particular per sonality of Abraham and the stories and events gathered around his name with the role he played as the discoverer of God and the founding father of his people. We will deal with Abraham as a real person, however, because there is some basis for such a belief. During the last few hundred years, there was a prevailing tendency among scholars of modern biblical criticism to regard the Patriarchs of ancient Israel as legendary figures. Within the last few decades, however, these venerable personalities have been restored to a position where their plausibility in history is gratly strengthened. This has come about largely through archeological findings which give a reconstructed picture of the historical and social background of early bibli cal times. The excavations of the Chaldean city of Ur, for example, where Abraham grew up, as well as numerous tablets and monuments relating to the civilization of that early era make possible a convincing setting that re-animates the biblical stories and makes their authenticity credible. (1) Salo Baron* refers to the "now prevalent assumption of a solid kernel of authentic historic tradition in the biblical narratives" even of this period. (2) Moreover, a factor *Salo Baron, A Social and Religious History of the Jews, Vol. I, page 34, Jewish Publication Society, Philadelphia, 1952</page><page sequence="3">Abraham and Monotheism 295 which tended to be overlooked when the cathexis of interest lay elsewhere is the realistic human quality of these early leaders of Israel in terms of personality and behavior. Abraham not only believed that he discovered God but felt himself to be the "chosen one," destined to become the father of a great nation, a blessing to all the peoples of the earth. What kind of personality development could have made this rather grandiose concept possible and yet kept it within the limits of reality functioning? We know that from a psychoanalytic point of view the God concept grows out of the father relationship. This sub jective factor, as Freud points out, has nothing to do with either proving or disproving the existence of God. (3) Abraham's special relationship with God presupposes a certain kind of superego development. It indicates a strong identification with an admired and idealized father-imago. What figure might have played this role in Abraham's youth? We know little of his early years from the Bible and can only conjecture from the events of later periods and the world in which he lived, the influences that helped to mold his character. Tradition makes the relationship between Abraham and his father Terah quite clear. The latter is cast in the role, not only of an idol-worshipper, but of an idol-maker, who tries to get his son to follow in his footsteps. There is thus an important source of conflict between the two. Abraham discovers a "better" God than the gods of his father, thus in a sense denying and overcoming him. The purpose of this tradition is, of course, to emphasize Abraham's new re ligious concept and to show him as a man who separated himself from his past and became the founder of a new re ligion and a new people. However, if we accept Abraham's position in history as real, then such a conflict would indeed have been inevitable and we would assume that at some time in his life Abraham rejected his father as an ego-ideal. Who, then, might have filled this role? Archeological findings have related the time of Abraham</page><page sequence="4">296 Dorothy F. Zeligs fairly closely with the reign of the great Semitic king, Ham murabi. The exact date of the latter's rule is not agreed upon by scholars but recent evidence has revised it down ward. Albright now places it during the years 1728-1686 B.C., (4) a fact significant for this study inasmuch as an other scholar dates the time of Abraham at about 1600 B.C. (5) Hammurabi was a brilliant and able ruler, one of the truly great men of ancient times. His armies conquered Babylonia and he succeeded in establishing his control over the highly competitive and militant city-states. These latter had previously engaged in frequent warfare among them selves, the governor of each state trying to gain the title of king and make his city the capital. Hammurabi not only united Babylonia politically but also strengthened it through his famous Code of Laws whose influence can clearly be seen in Abraham's concepts of social justice. In his book, Moses and Monotheism, Freud states that the external condition favorable for the development of monotheism in Egypt was the political unity of that great empire under the awe-inspiring rule of the great Pharaoh. (6) This factor would also hold good for the beginnings of mono theism in Babylonia. Freud believed too that there was a general readiness at this period of history for such a develop ment in the field of religion. He points ou that society had gone through various stages of progress since the prehis toric era of the primeval crime. It had practiced totemism which, as Reik reminds us, (7) is a form of primitive heno theism. Then it had moved toward the humanized god in his various relationships to the animal totem, and late*, un der the favorable conditions of a more unified political so ciety, the tendency toward monotheism, the "longing for the father,' was again manifesting itself. This social readiness, however, is no proof that Egypt necessarily was better prepared than Babylonia for such a development. As far as cultural concepts are concerned, these two areas of civilization were not separate and remote</page><page sequence="5">Abraham and Monotheism 297 from each other. Archeological findings definitely establish that the lands connecting them, Syria and Canaan, were equally high in cultural development and that "Egyptian as well as Babylonian influence prevailed not only in Palestine but throughout Syria and neighboring countries. (8) Freud believed that the religion of ethical monotheism arose in Egypt under the influence of the young Pharaoh Ikhnaton, a religious reformer who lived in the fourteenth century, B.C. Freud's chief authority for this point of view was Dr. Breasted, whose book, Dawn of Conscience, em phasizes Ikhnaton's worship of "Aton," the mighty and all-pervasive power of the sun. Dr. Solomon Goldman, in his detailed analysis of the above-mentioned volume, points out that Dr. Breasted's efforts to distinguish this form of sun-worship as a symbolic one, reflecting the universal spirit behind it rather than the object itself, has little proof. He declares, "In the opinion of several distinguished Egyptolo gists, Professor Breasted to the contrary, Ikhnaton's religion was little else than a refined solar religion." (9) It is worthy of note, however, that even Ikhnaton's trend toward monotheism, which stood out conspicuously amidst the diverse and deeply-rooted polytheism of his day, may have been quite directly influenced by foreign cultural forces emanating from the lands of the northeast. Several hundred years before his reign, Egypt was invaded and con quered by the Hyksos, a people from Syria and nearby Asi atic lands, of mixed race although prevailingly Semitic. They became the ruling class and impressed their culture upon the upper strata of Egyptian society. After about a hun dred years, (1675-1567), the Hyksos were driven out. (10) But the foreign influence remained, and Ikhnaton's mother and wife were both believed to be of Asiatic origin, as Freud himself points out. (11) Freud postulated certain other conditions which he re garded as favorable to the development of Jewish monothe ism. He theorized that Moses, who led the Hebrews out of slavery, was an Egyptian nobleman imbued with the new</page><page sequence="6">298 Dorothy P. Zeligs religion of Ikhnaton. Disappointed because Ikhnaton's be liefs had been violently repudiated by the mass of Egyptian people after that ruler's death, Moses adopted the Hebrews as his people, taught them the new religion, and arranged for their escape from Egypt. It was Freud's theory that this leader was killed by the Hebrews during one of their revolts against his rule while they were sojourning in the desert. Decades later, under the leadership of another man, a Midianite priest who worshipped a volcano-god called Yah weh, the Hebrews revived the memory of Moses, endowed the second man with name and greatness of the first leader, and gave to the new god, Yah weh, attributes associated with the religion of the Egyptian hero. The biblical Moses was therefore a composite figure of an Egyptian nobleman and a Midianite priest of a later period. By re-enacting the original crime, the killing of the pri mal father, the Hebrews became particularly sensitized to a return of the repressed, according to Freud. The fixation of the Jews to the Father religion, he explains, was because they "acted out" the memory of the awful deed instead of recol lecting it. The immediate basic psychological factor in the develop ment of monotheism, therefore, was the overthrow of a father imago, then a period of latency during which this deed was repressed, and finally, the emergence of the father-figure on an idealized plane. This is the same process described as the origin of man's earliest religion in Totem and Tabu. Freud explains that the Hebrews were able to accept the new re ligion more readily because of the personal role they played in it as the "chosen people." Freud's theory that Moses met a violent end in the desert was based on a highly inconclusive interpretation of some passages in the book of Rosea by the biblical commentator, Ernest Sellin. This deduction has been described by other authorities as "far-fetched" and "fantastic" and as having no sound basis for acceptance. (12) Freud's own words re veal clearly the tentative nature of his hypothesis regarding</page><page sequence="7">Abraham and Monotheism 299 the Egyptian origins of Jewish monotheism when he writes, "To my critical faculties this treatise, proceeding from a study of the man Moses, seems like a dancer balancing on one toe. If I had not been able to find support in the analytic interpretation of the exposure myth and pass thence to Sel lin 's suggestion concerning Moses' end, the whole treatise would have to remain unwritten," (13) The myth to which Freud here refers concerns the rescue of the baby Moses from the Nile. He postulates that the motive in this myth, apart from its being a characteristic legend of the birth of a hero, was to change the Egyptian child into a Jewish one. "We have made this somewhat lengthy but necessary di gressions not only to set forth Freud's ideas about conditions favorable to the growth of monotheism, but to indicate the opinion that his application of these principles to the land of Egypt and the leadership of Moses is questionable and that the more traditional viewpoint that Babylonia was the land and Abraham the man deserves reconsideration. Let us now return to our study of Abraham. We have assumed that he lived several generations after the death of Hammurabi. When this ruler died, a period of decline set in, marked by disunion among the city-states and the es tablishment of local dynasties. The work of Hammurabi is thus overthrown after his death by rebellion and disaffection among his "sons." Here, then, may be seen a re-enactment of the destruction of the father. Several generations pass, the period of latency necessary for the full effect of the emergence of an important memory in the form of a tradi tion. Within the recollection of older inhabitants is the heroic period of Hammurabi. This recent historic event of a powerful father-figure who unifies his kingdom and is associated with high standards of social justice, must have been fateful for Abraham's development. We thus see in the life situation of Abraham several elements which Freud postulated for the emergence of monotheism in Egypt. Of course, the rise and fall of an empire and the memory of its king cannot be compared in degree of affect with the</page><page sequence="8">300 Dorothy F. Zeligs supposed crime of the "murder of Moses." Still, these events may have provided the fateful stimuli for a development which was already close to the surface of consciousness in the mass mind. Moreover, they have the advantage of being far closer to historical fact. The monotheistic concept, some believe, was not the dis covery of one person, but a folk idea, which grew out of the mass psychology of a group. That one individual more gifted than the others should "discover" this conception for him self and teach it to his followers is understandable. We cannot deny here the role of individual genius in being able to utilize available elements for a new synthesis, even though Freud points out that this factor, because it seems inexplic able, should be left until last in the striving for the under standing of causes. But what mutation is to biological change, genius must be to psychological progress. Genius is as much an inherent quality of natural development as other processes of growth. Having identified himself with a powerful father-imago, Abraham, in his competitive quest for a more effective god than the gods of his father, may have projected his superego on a cosmic scale and ' ' discovered ' ' God. This deeply person al religious experience would involve a close identification with God, a process which may have led Abraham to re-intro ject a large part of his own ego-ideal. His personality would then be characterized by a large amount of narcissism. This eould have found expression is his becoming the "chosen one." Because this development probably took place on the basis of a severe repression of Oedipal strivings, as will be indicated later, it took on ethical qualities. In the position of leadership as head of his tribe, Abraham could give ex pression in reality to his aim-inhibited drives and thus avoid extreme pathological consequences. The two chief characteristics of God, His incorporeality and His ethical demands on man can be understood both as the "next step" in religious development and as related to the Oedipal conflict. Freud points out that relegating the</page><page sequence="9">Abraham and Monotheism 301 gods to the heavens was an expression of ambivalence, a method of honoring them and of getting rid of them. The Patriarch was known above all as a righteous man. "And the Lord said to Abraham, 'Walk before Me and be thou perfect.' " It seems understandable that the man who attained the idea of an ethical God should consider it his first duty to be righteous, in identification with God. Abra ham thus represented the two main characteristics of Juda ism, the concept of monotheism and of high ethical conduct. It is significant to observe the deep need which tradition had to maintain the view of Abraham as a "perfect and righteous man," although it is customary in the Bible to disclose freely the faults of its heroes. There seems to be a greater tendency to repress and rationalize the human weak nesses of Abraham than is usual with other biblical figures. Perhaps that is because the area of conflict and guilt in Abraham is so closely related to developmental factors in Judaism and therefore to repressed areas in its followers. Freud points out that "ambivalency belongs to the es sence of the father-son relationship," and that out of the repressed hostility and consequent guilt of this Father re ligion grew the emphasis upon ethics in the development of Judaism. (14) "We should therefore expect to see in the life of Abraham a certain amount of conflict in his roles as son and father. It should be interesting to trace the pattern of ambivalence and the efforts to overcome it in the life of the ancient Patri arch. His relationship with his father Terah must have had elements of strong attachment, for the two left Ur together and Abraham remained with Terah in the town of Haran until the latter's death. But we know that Abraham must have rejected his father as an ego-ideal at some period of his development. It may have come during his adolescence as an expression of what Freud has described as the "family romance," in which young people tend to imagine that they are not really the offspring of their own families but belong</page><page sequence="10">302 Dorothy F. Zeligs to an upper strata of society. (15) Perhaps at such a time the image of Hammurabi took strong hold upon the gifted mind of the young Abraham and influenced the future course of his life. The development which led to his discovery of God may have been, in part, an attempted solution to his problem of ambivalence, leading to a splitting of the father-imago. One part became the ideal Father and the other was the weak, rejected father toward whom the son behaved with a solici tude which resembled a reversal of the father-son roles. Abraham teaches Terah the error of his ways in the field of religion but also maintains an attitude of loving care to ward him, a combination of duties usually assumed by a fa ther toward his child. We might say that Abraham identi fied with a father-imago stronger than Terah and thus be came "fatherly" himself. This "fatherliness" must have contained elements of competitiveness and hostility. Abra ham's devotion to Terah, therefore, would have had a com pensatory character because of unconscious guilt feelings. Rabbinic literature contains many legends about the continual conflict between Abraham and a legendary king called Nimrod, who supposedly ruled Babylonia at the time Abraham lived there. In these stories the idol-worshipping king futilely pits his his strength against the power of Abra ham's God. The hostility between Abraham and Nimrod may well represent an aspect of the relationship between Abraham and Terah. Evidently Hebrew tradition could not make Terah the chief opponent in the life and death struggle between the forces of polytheism and monotheism. It could not tolerate such a ruthless relationship between father and son, therefore displacing it to a legendary king. It is after the death of Terah that Abraham receives the "call" which commands him to leave his father's house for a new land to which God would direct him. This is the first reference in the Bible to Abraham's great mission, his selection by God as the "chosen one," who was to be a bless ing to all the earth. Not until Terah dies does Abraham</page><page sequence="11">Abraham and Monotheism 303 dare to receive such a "call," and then only by leaving "his father's house" and going to a new land. After his arrival in Canaan, a famine occurs there, forc ing Abraham to journey down to Egypt for food. Fearful that his life might be endangered because of Sarah, his beauti ful wife, who would be more easily available for the harem of Pharaoh if she had no husband, Abraham poses as her brother. His fears are realized and Sarah is taken from him. Through God's intervention, a plague falls upon the house of Pharaoh, he discovers Sarah's true identity, and returns her to her husband. A similar incident is repeated in almost identical fashion on another occasion when Abraham seeks asylum in the king dom of Gerar during the period of another famine in Canaan. Again Sarah is taken to the household of the king, a plague breaks out, and the king is warned in a dream not to touch Sarah. The king returns Abraham's wife with a gentle re proof because the true facts had been withheld from him. In addition, he heaps rich gifts upon Abraham and gives him safe conduct from the land. Commentators have been hard put to explain this un gallant behavior on the part of Abraham, and their rational izations have been far from convincing. Abraham's own effort at justification was closer to the truth when he said that Sarah was indeed his sister, the daughter of his fa ther but not of his mother. The rabbis hasten to ex plain that the word daughter in the Bible was also used to describe the relationship of granddaughter, so that Sarah was more likely Abraham's niece. In saying she was also his sister, Abraham may have been revealing his unconscious attitude toward her as an incestuous object, and while the factual statement served him as an excuse, the feelings of guilt underlying it may have prompted him to renounce the wife who was also a sister. The incidents both in Egypt and Gerar, with their strangely repetitive quality, and the fact that Abraham an ticipated them before they occurred, have a decidedly un</page><page sequence="12">304 Dorothy F. Zeligs realistic character. They seem more like a phantasy or a dream. The entrance into Egypt may have symbolized to Abraham an intrusion into the domain of the powerful fa ther-imago, the "land" that belonged to Pharaoh. Abraham must have been assailed by unconscious guilt and in a fearful mood pleaded with Sarah to pose as his sister and thus save his life. He was prepared, not only to surrender the wife that unconsciously belonged to the father, but even to deny his own realistic rights, as a kind of superego protection, as if to protest to himself that Sarah was not really his wife, but his sister. His tendency to utilize a king as a father imago may have increased his uneasiness and his readiness to submit. This behavior, whether in reality or phantasy, seems much more explicable on the basis of the unconscious factors mentioned than as an expression of physical coward ice. For in other situations Abraham clearly shows himself to be a man of courage. The happy outcome in both incidents adds to the phan tasy quality. Both rulers not only return his wife to him but enrich him with gifts, thus acknowledging that his God is greater than theirs, even as his God was better than Terah's. In this rather ambiguous father-son contest, Abra ham comes out victorious. He submits to the earthly father but is saved by the Heavenly One. It might be pertinent at this point to recall that there is no mention in the Bible of Abraham's mother. Evidently she did not leave Ur with him and her husband Terah, and therefore must have died in that city. That the mother of so important a person should not even be named must indi cate a strong repression of the Oedipal conflict. Abraham's wife, Sarah, on the other hand, plays an im portant role which is in contrast to the theoretic lowliness of the position of women in that era. This very importance, on an unconscious as well as on a reality level, must have been a factor in arousing guilt and fear within Abraham as soon as they entered Egypt, and later, in the kingdom of Gerar. The severe repression of the Oedipal relationship</page><page sequence="13">Abraham and Monotheism 305 may have caused a displacement of cathexis to the wife, also an incestuous object for his unconscious, thus increasing both his fear and his guilt. Abraham's ambivalent feelings in the father-son situation forced him to be submissive to the royal father-imagos. Many of Abraham's problems and conflicts center around the father-son nucleus. He remains childless for many years in spite of God's repeated promise that a son would be born to carry on the father's mission. The very fact of Abra ham's long years of childlessness could have had a psycho genic significance. If Sarah was a mother surrogate, then the sexual relationship with her would be impaired and the emotional reasons for childlessness explained. God's promise to him is of a very grandiose nature. His descendents were to be as numberless as the dust of the earth and as the stars in the heavens. Does not the comparison itself betray ambi valence by bringing together the most lowly substance with the most elevated? Was not the very nature of this promise, in its limitless abundance, an unconscious reversal of the real wish — a phantasy that he might never have a com petitor in the form of a son and thus never be displaced? His own ambivalence as a son gave him good reason to fear retalia tion from a son of his own. Abraham declared that his dearest wish was to have a son who would carry on his great task. We cannot doubt that this was true on certain levels. But let us see what Abraham's actual behavior was to the three people who stood in that relationship to him. The first of these was Lot, the son of his deceased brother Haran. Since Abraham had been childless for many years, Lot seemed the most likely person to become his heir. And indeed he took Lot with him from Ur and they dwelt in Canaan together. But on the first occasion of a conflict, Abraham suggests that Lot should leave him. This story is uniformly interpreted as showing Abraham to be a man of peace because he did not wish any strife between himself and his kinsman. It is also used to indicate Abraham's</page><page sequence="14">306 Dorothy F. Zeligs generosity since he allowed Lot to have the first choice of territory for his flocks. Another explanation for this action is that Abraham did not wish to arouse the hostility of the Canaanites by taking up so much of the pasturage for both his own herds and those of Lot. Rabbinic sources declare, moreover, that Lot, being an idol-worshipper, was not worthy of filling the role destined for Abraham's son. The fact remains, however, that Abraham, for a rather unimportant reason, sends away the man who stood in a son-relation ship to him, even though there was no other to fill that im portant position. He must have felt threatened unconscious ly by the idea of a son who would one day take his place. It might be argued that this separation from Lot indicated rather Abraham's faith in God, Who had promised him a son of his own. But even belief in such a promise would not necessitate his separation from Lot. In the actual sequence of events as described in the Bible, the promise of a son occurs immediately after Lot departs. "And the Lord said unto Abraham, after that Lot was sep arated from him: 'Lift up thine eyes and look from the place where thou art, northward and southward and east ward and westward; for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed forever.' " These words sound like an effort at reassurance. His hostility toward a son is here acted out on a reality level by sending Lot away, while his positive wishes in this direction find expression in the hope of a fulfillment safely put off in the future. In the meantime, he remains the sole important figure both in relation to God and to his people. Another possible complicating factor in Abraham's feelings for Lot should be noted here. Lot was related to Sarah, not only through her marriage to Abraham, but through actual blood ties. If Abraham identified with Lot as a son-imago, then the memory of his own Oedipal striv ings may have been activatèd, with resulting hostility and fear of Lot's incestuous desires toward Sarah. This would increase Abraham's wish to separate from Lot.</page><page sequence="15">Abraham and Monotheism 307 A situation occurs in which Abraham shows the positive aspects of his feelings for Lot and a sense of responsibility for this member of his family. Word reaches him that Lot, among others, has been taken captive during a war upon Sodom and Gemorrah. Abraham at once rallies his men about him and they pursue the enemy. They win a victory and free the prisoners. When the king offers him a reward for this deed and a part of the spoils he had recovered, Abra ham refuses to take even so much as a latchstring. To do so would lessen the virtue of his act in the eyes of God. This is clearly a deed prompted by the superego and its reward is the approval of the superego. The story about Abraham's hospitality, when he enter tains angels unawares, is one of the most beloved about the Patriarch. It presents a vivid picture of nomadic, pastural life in one of its most appealing aspects. Hospitality was akin to the saving of life, for a wandering stranger not only found himself without food and water, but was a likely object of suspicion and hostility. But once he has been wel comed into the encampment and has partaken of food, he is immune to aggression. Hospitality was therefore re garded as a great virtue. It was after Abraham performed his kindly act toward the three strangers that the prophetic promise of a son was again made to him. Later, on this same occasion, the famous scene takes place in which Abraham bargains with God in an effort to save the wicked cities of Sodom and Gemorrah from destruc tion. Two of the three visitors move on to Sodom to carry out their mission there. The third, evidently God Himself, tarries a bit. He decides to take Abraham into His confi dence about the impending doom hanging over the cities of the Plain and says to him, "I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto Me; and if not, I will know." Before meting out such dread punishment, God decides to investigate the situation personally. Abraham then lingers before the Lord and dares to argue the matter with Him, saying, "Wilt</page><page sequence="16">308 Dorothy F. Zeligs Thou indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?" He asks God if He would spare the cities should fifty right eous men be found there. Encouraged by God's assent, Abraham keeps decreasing the number on whom the fate of the cities should depend, ending with the plea, "Shall not the Judge of all the world do justly?" Psychoanalytically, this dramatic little dialogue might be explained as a projection of what was going on within Abraham, the conflict with his own superego. Lot and his family lived in Sodom, and their fate also was involved, if these cities should be destroyed. Abraham had been in strumental in sending Lot into this city of depravity, where even hospitality was a crime. Abraham himself had just enjoyed the glowing satisfaction of practicing this virtue and had been rewarded with the promise of a son. His feel ings of guilt toward Lot may easily have been stirred by this double stimulus, and a wish aroused to save him from the doom that threatened the city. The sequence of events must have some significance — the hospitality, the promise of a son, and immediately after, the discussion of Sodom and its imminent destruction. Might not Abraham's plea for the cities have been in the service of guilt feelings and a defense against hostility and therefore took on such an unusual in tensity of righteousness? Abraham pleads for all the people, thereby disguising the identity of the one in the many, a mechanism commonly found in dreams. The unusual and rather charming anthropomorphic quality of God in this scene conveys the feeling that Abra ham is standing before his personified conscience. The doubt which God expressed about what was going on in Sodom may have been the doubt in Abraham's own heart about the justice of his behavior toward Lot. Commentators have been inclined to eulogize this episode as marking the high point of nobility and righteousness in the character of Abraham. Yet this favored son of God is here more righteous than God Himself, even as he was su perior to his earthly father. He may thus not only be com</page><page sequence="17">Abraham and Monotheism 309 pensating for guilt feelings toward Lot, but also expressing some unconscious hostility toward God, the Father. The mechanism of displacement may be involved here. It is not he who wishes to put Lot out of the way, but God, and more over, without just cause. So Abraham reverses the roles, as he did with Terah, and becomes father toward God, gently reproving Him. Abraham thus removes the cloak of right eousness from God and dons it himself. He overcomes the Father in the very act of becoming like Him.* At the mo ment when he is altruistically pleading for others, his own narcissism stands clearly revealed. Only on such uncon scious defensive motivation can the behavior of Abraham be understood here. For nowhere else is there any indica tion that his concept of God is less than that of perfect righteousness. The interpretation that conflict about his nephew is the chief determining element in this scene is strengthened by the fact that during the events that follow in Sodom, Lot is quite openly the central figure. We hear no more about the number of righteous men or the lack of them in the city. Only Lot and his family seem to be involved. A series of events now take place, the meaning of which is most puzzling. Two of the three angels that had visited Abraham then proceed to Sodom. They meet Lot at the open space near the gates of the city and reluctantly allow themselves to be persuaded by him to take shelter in his home for the night. A mob surrounds Lot's house and de mands that he surrender the strangers to them, for the laws of Sodom forbid hospitality. Lot resorts to a rather drastic measure to appease the hostile crowd. He faces the mob and implores the people to take his two virgin daughters in stead and do with them what they will, but to spare his guests, to whom he owes the duty of protection. Lot is saved from this dramatic sacrifice when the angels open the door of the house, draw Mm inside, and at the same time •See Reik's discussion of the struggle between Moses and God, in Ritual, "The Shofar," p. 316</page><page sequence="18">310 Dorothy F. Zeligs cause blindness among the people outside so that they cannot find the door. The next day, again with the help of the angels, Lot and his two daughters escape the dstruction that takes place in the city, but his wife looks behind her and is turned into a pillar of salt. Biblical commentators say that Lot was saved, not for any virtue of his own, but for the sake of Abraham. And indeed, apart from his relationship to Abraham, Lot has little significance. On what basis, then, did this myth de velop and why did the editors of the Bible consider it im portant enough to be included in the sacred text? If Lot was saved because of Abraham, then the other events in the story must also have some connection with him. The entire myth might perhaps be understood as a phantasy that developed in identification with the thoughts and feel ings of Abraham as he contemplated the possible fate of his nephew in the light of the news he received regarding the impending destruction of the cities of the Plain. It was an answer to the problem of what happened to the cities and to Lot after Abraham's dramatic bargaining with God. There is considerable evidence that the cities of the Plain were actually destroyed by earthquake in biblical times. The fate of Lot therefore was one to tempt the phantasy of men. The ambivalent attitude toward him revealed in the myth might indeed be Abraham's own and may, as we suggested, have de veloped in unconscious identification with him. The line of association does indeed proceed directly from Abraham to Lot as two of the angels leave the former and move at once to the latter. The ambivalence toward Lot in this story is revealed in several instances. Lot is allowed to practice hospitality, the virtue which Abraham himself esteems so highly. But this virtue is offset by the price Lot was willing to pay for it — the degradation of his daughters. We know that even in those days the violation of a virgin was considered a heinous offense. When Jacob's daughter, Dinah, was violated by a prince of Shechem, his act was not forgiven even though he</page><page sequence="19">Abraham and Monotheism 311 fell in love with the girl and wanted to marry her, offering rich gifts for her hand. The whole town suffered a cruel punishment at the hands of Dinah's brothers. In the other instance of ambivalence, Lot is saved from destruction but the hostility is displaced to his wife, a person of whom we know practically nothing and so she can hardly in herself have earned such a punishment. Ernest Jones has explained the unconscious meaning of salt in mythology as a symbol for semen. (16) Thus the pillar of salt into which the unfortunate woman is transformed is a phallic symbol both in form and content. The displaced hostility toward Lot is thus expressed in symbolic masculine form, an immobilized phallus. The punishment may be for "look ing" while the city, a mother symbol, is being despoiled. The relationship of this episode with Abraham's own Oedipal conflicts and jealousy toward Lot might be indicated here. It is interesting to note that while biblical commentators have little that is good to say of Lot, the Bible itself nowhere states that he was an unworthy person, nor do his deeds ac tually condemn him as such. For the most part, the charac ter of Lot has been built up on inferences through the work of interpreters. It seems likely that they were influenced by unconscious identification with Abraham's own ambivalence and a wish to justify his conduct. The story of Abraham and his first-born son, Ishmael, shows a continuation of the pattern of ambivalence in Abra ham toward an heir. Ishmael is the offspring of Hagar, the Egyptian handmaiden of his wife Sarah. In accordance with the law and custom of those days, Sarah offered Hagar to her husband as a substitute for her own barrenness. In the conflict of jealousy that arose between the two women after Hagar conceived, the latter, we are told, despised her mistress and Sarah complained bitterly to her husband. Abraham told her to deal with Hagar as seemed suitable to her. This was also according to the law of those days as set forth in the Code of Hammurabi, which stated that a concubine could again be reduced to the status of a servant.</page><page sequence="20">312 Dorothy F. Zeligs (17) Sarah treated her handmaid so harshly that Hagar fled into the wilderness. There an angel appeared and told her to return to Sarah, comforting her -with the prophecy that she would bear a son who would be the father of a multitude of people. The tension between the two women continued and grew more acute after Sarah herself gave birth to Isaac. On the occasion when Isaac's weaning was celebrated by a feast, the Bible story says that Sarah saw the son of Hagar "making sport" of her. Whether this was a projection or real, Sa rah's ready anger utilized this mild incident and she said to Abraham, ' ' Cast out this bondwoman and her son ; for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac." "We are told that such a thing was "very grievous" in the eyes of Abraham but God Himself urged him to do what Sarah said, for his descendents were indeed to come from Isaac. As for Ishmael, God promised to make a great na tion from him also. So Hagar and Ishmael are sent forth into the desert with some bread and a bottle of water. They lose their way in the wilderness and would have perished had not God sent an angel to rescue them, according to the story. Beneath the manifest content of this episode, other mo tivations must have been present. Abraham sends his own son and the woman who bore him, into the desert to face a probable death. This is a hostile act, regardless of rational izations and defenses. The Bible, with its rather unusual protectiveness where the problem of Abraham's righteous ness is concerned, absolves him from guilt by putting God on his side. Commentators emphasize that this action was necessary in order to maintain peace in the household, point ing out that Abraham was known as a man who loved peace. But surely Abraham was not such a weakling, nor was he so afraid of Sarah, that he could not have settled this prob lem without resorting to so drastic a measure. In a large nomadic encampment people can live together without see ing each other for days at a time. Abraham's act can only</page><page sequence="21">Abraham and Monotheism 313 be understood as an aggressive one, an attitude manifested on two occasions, when he allowed Hagar, who was already bearing his child, to be mistreated by Sarah, and secondly, when he actually sent her and his son away into the wilder ness. Rabbinic tales try to make amends for this behavior. They tell how Abraham yearned for his son and visited Ish mael in the desert when the latter was a grown man. Abra ham does not find Ishmael at home but his wife is in the tent. She does not know Abraham's identity and fails to observe the most common laws of hospitality. Moreover, she is harshly mistreating her children. Abraham leaves a cryptic message with her to convey to Ishmael, advising him to put away the tent-pin which he had there and put another in its stead. Ishmael understood the message and divined what had taken place. He divorced his wife and got an other. In this legend, Abraham strives to correct a situa tion where a home is marred by an undutiful wife and moth er. May this not be an effort on the part of commentators to justify Abraham's own conduct toward an "undutiful" woman ? The next important event in the life of Abraham is the dramatic incident when he is called upon by God to sacrifice Isaac, the long-awaited only son of his union with Sarah, the son who was to be his heir, and through whom God's prom ise to him was to be fulfilled. Here we have a high point of drama and near tragedy, the culmination of Abraham's life time of ambivalence toward a son. It is significant that this story occupies a place of special importance in biblical lit erature and has been an engrossing subject in the Talmud and in the work of commentators throughout the centuries. Everywhere the courage of Abraham and his unfalter ing faith in God is extolled because he showed such readiness to carry out this supreme act of sacrifice. The underlying significance of this event, as an object lesson to the peoples of his time that God did not desire human sacrifice, is brought out. But nowhere, except in psychoanalytic writings, is this</page><page sequence="22">314 Dorothy F. Zeligs act described in its true unconscious motivation — the ex pression of an intense conflict within Abraham toward his son and strong feelings of guilt toward God, the Father. This understanding does not lessen the intensity of the struggle, the pain and grief that must have accompanied it, and above all, the final victory of love over hostility. This "call" from God to sacrifice his beloved son was not only an eruption of hostility toward Isaac, but also, of course, must have involved deep feelings of guilt toward the Father and the need for some form of self-castration as pun ishment. For, as Reik points out, "the religious sacrifice of a child is always in the nature of an atonement". (18) It seems significant that the covenant of circumcision which God established with Abraham was effected at the time when God promised that He would grant him and Sarah a son. A partial castration was thus the price which God exacted for a son, whose existence would place the father in a position analogous to God Himself. As the time drew near for the son to displace the father, even as Abraham unconsciously had often wished to displace his own father, then hostility and guilt created the crisis which reached its peak in the near-sacrifice of Isaac. For such an act would indeed have been in the service of both feelings, hostility and the need for punishment. It was significant for the development of Judaism that this sacrifice was averted and that Abraham's realistic ego triumphed over the sadistic superego. Freedom from guilt could not be won through self-castration as an act of submis sion to the Father, but on a reality level, through the over coming of ambivalence. Abraham's positive feelings, Ms genuine love for Isaac, gained the ascendency. Love over came guilt and fear, decreasing the amount of his narcissism. Thus one can say with Freud that psychoanalysis shows man to be not only less moral than was formerly thought, but also more moral. The life of Abraham gives indications of the relationship between man's intrapsychic struggle and the development of</page><page sequence="23">Abraham and Monotheism 315 an ethical social system based on religion. Freud has stated that cultural progress grows out of instinctual renunciation. In the greater number of Abraham's conflicts with his ambi valent feelings, the positive elements won over the hostile ones. Thus the tendency grew within him for a closer union, not only with his family and his tribe, but with the whole world, as expressed in the ideal of being the father of a great nation and a blessing to all the earth. Abraham thus typifies in the life of an individual, a process that to a certain extent is similar to the experience of a whole people. (19) 230 Riverside Drive New York 25, N.
