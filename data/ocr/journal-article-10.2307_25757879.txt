<plain_text><page sequence="1">AU-Consuming Faith Language, Material Culture and World-TVansformation among Protestant Evangelicals* Simon Coleman, Durham University, England Throughout the last two or three decades, the profile of conservative Protestantism as an active religious force has been greatly sharpened and extended. The apparent revival of such Christianity is notable not only because it has called into question unilinear theories of secularization (cf. Cox 1984), but also because it has spread far beyond the north American Bible belt.1 In the process, evangelicals have attempted to promulgate their faith as a form of global culture, easily comprehensible and applicable across conventional boundaries of belief and practice (cf. Coleman 1993; Poewe 1994). A striking and important aspect of this revival has been the exploitation of new forms of communications technology. Advocates of the 'Prosperity'/'Health and Wealth' Gospel in particular have been assiduous in deploying electronic means of evangelization, not merely through televangelism but also via the use of radio, cassettes, and videos (cf. Lindermayer 1995:27).2 My aim here is to focus on a particular branch of the 'Prosperity' Movement (a branch whose centre of opera tions is based in Sweden). Initially, I shall discuss the movement's attitudes towards language as an objectified means of pervading the physical world with divine force. I shall then examine how the use of mass media by these Christians facilitates the construction of a religious culture that lends itself - at least superficially - to easy consumption on a transcultural level. One part of my argument will be that, through using modern media, these Christians transform religious experience and language into commodities that thereby become available to be marketed for circulation. An evangelical economy is constructed wherein the cultivation of faith involves the mass consumption of goods in the form of books, cassettes, and videos. A major corollary of this point will be that, in the commodification of religious experience, sacredly-charged language and material objects interact in complex ways: words are taken to have 'thing-like' qualities in both their semantic and performative roles, just as physical phenomena are perceived to be imbued with and even transformed by language. ETNOFOOR, IX(1) 1996, pp. 29-47 29</page><page sequence="2">Language and the material world Any discussion of the relationships between words and things among Protestant evangelicals is likely to encounter some initial, apparent paradoxes. Such Christians commonly define themselves precisely through their attempts to achieve unmediated and inspired access to the divine. Identity in and through a 'living' Christ is commonly sought, rather than via the more overtly material sacraments of, for instance, Roman Catholicism. Holy places such as pilgrimage sites, as well as sacred objects such as icons, are regarded with some suspicion as they have the potential to promote an idolatrous emphasis of material form over spiritual meaning. Given that continued and personal revelation is seen as integral to valid religious experience, a concentra tion on fixed objects or even liturgies runs the risk of symbolizing an ossified state of being rather than a continually changing and developing process of becoming (cf. Patterson 1982). A number of academic authors concur with this evangelical perspective, stressing the importance of such Christians' manipulation of language rather than mate rial religious paraphernalia. Martin (1990:163-64) characterizes Pentecostalism as a system of communication in which personal and wider transformation can be achieved through such verbal forms as tongues, testimonies and song. Harding (1987: 169) emphasizes how Baptist services and revivals are stripped of imagistic and sacramental material as a means of intensifying and focussing religious rhetoric. Goethals (1985:151) refers to the way the expressive power of architectural settings and material artefacts is minimized in evangelical contexts, in deference to the persuasive functions of words. All these examples provide a powerful contemporary echo of the iconoclasm of original Protestant reformers who abhorred the base circumscription and materialization of the sacred on the grounds that it contaminated divine prerogative (Freedberg 1989:62). These depictions of evangelicalism undoubtedly capture much that is important in this version of Christianity. However, my argument is that they are limited by their lack of emphasis on the relationship between material culture and evangelical language. In practice, this faith contains a coherent if not always explicitly acknowl edged system of recognizing the presence of divinity in visual and material forms - a system that is most evident within but not confined to the 'Prosperity' Movement. Sacred words to these Christians are not passive receptacles of meaning confined to the pages of a book, but performative statements, inspiring the healing touch of the preacher or the phrase that will provide the sinner with salvation. Evangelical beliefs and practices often parallel those aspects of Austinian speech act theory which describe how discursive practice can produce that which it names (cf. Butler 1993:13). The Word 'lives' by being translated into a material indication of its efficacy, as signs of language are turned into physical signs of the presence of sacred power. If transformed objects and, as we shall see, human bodies provide indices of the sacred power of language, language is materialized in other ways, as well. Modern 30</page><page sequence="3">media of communication do not in themselves indicate the efficacy of language - they obviously cannot be used as signs of God's grace in the same way as a body that has been healed - but they are containers of words that can be used to affect circumstances. Neither the relic nor the conventional icon can be used by evangelicals as tangible, portable vehicles for the sacred; however, the video or cassette most certainly can. The 'Prosperity' Gospel in Sweden While the 'Prosperity' Gospel has permeated many different Christian denomina tions,3 it has been advocated strongly by the 'Faith' or 'Word' Movement during the present evangelical revival. Leading figures in the movement have tended to come from the U.S., and have included such figures as Kenneth Hagin, Kenneth and Gloria Copeland, and Jerry Savelle. These figures have cultivated substantial followings in Europe and the non-western world (Hollinger 1991:53), while in more recent years a number of Faith preachers from non-American countries have gained powerful reputations within the movement. My ethnographic research has concentrated on activities in Sweden, where - bolstered by contacts with other Faith organizations, and in particular those from the U.S. - local Christians have been active over the past 15 years in establishing congregations which currently involve perhaps 10,000 20,000 people (Skog 1993). The main local catalyst of the Swedish revival has undoubtedly been the Word of Life {Livets Ord) Bible Centre. This organization was set up in an industrial zone of Uppsala in the early 1980s by Ulf Ekman, a former priest in the Lutheran State Church. Ekman had attended Kenneth Hagin's Bible School in Tulsa in 1980-81, and today he heads an extensive operation: a congregation of roughly 2,000 people is combined with possibly the biggest Bible school in Europe, training hundreds of Swedish- or English-speaking students a year. Other educational facilities include a nursery, school and University, while a series of commercial departments also manufacture and market media products within and beyond Sweden. The Word of Life's mixture of business and religious interests, as well as its aggressively-promulgated evangelical principles, have made it an extremely contro versial phenomenon in Sweden throughout the whole of its existence. It has often been depicted as a fraudulent, money-grabbing sect, whose aim is to brainwash the many younger people attracted to its activities (cf. Coleman 1989).4 One factor that has bolstered members against such attacks in a national context has been the realization that the group is part of a wider network of like-minded people (cf. Coleman 1995). Members see themselves as gaining access to an imagined, translocal community (cf. Anderson 1983) of Christians engaged in a world-wide project of evangelization, and their imagination is sustained by constant flows of personnel and commodities through an internal economy of evangelical culture. 31</page><page sequence="4">The imagined community is therefore also an imaged community - in publications, satellite programmes and videos. We are led back to an examination of the role of commodified containers of sacred language and experience in sustaining particular forms of religious commitment. Embodying the word The roots of 'Faith' theories of language can be located in at least two sources (cf. Hollinger 1991). Pentecostal healing revivalism has been transformed into a neo charismatic attempt to appeal to a wide variety of Christians. In addition, ideas have been derived from nineteenth century New Thought Metaphysics (also known as the Science of the Mind) through the writings of the preacher E.W. Kenyon (1867-1948). Such metaphysics stressed the primacy of mind as the cause of all effects, as well as the divine nature of humans (cf. ibid.:61). Along with other faiths influenced by these notions, such as Spiritualism and Christian Science (cf. Zaretsky 1974:189) a belief in the inner power and meaning of language is maintained. Words, once uttered, are said to gain an objective reality, thus creating the referent which they symbolize (cf. ibid.: 190). Kenyon's assertion that what one confesses with one's lips controls one's inner being is extended to indicate power over the external world: biblical verses such as Mark 11:23-24, describing the moving of mountains through a combination of faith and spoken language, can be taken literally as an indication of the power of the Word over the world. Faith Christians refer to such performative verbal acts as 'positive confessions'. In these, words are regarded as creating the very reality which they purport to describe. Words of joy create happiness, and those of defeat result in despair. Books are published by Faith preachers with titles like The Tongue: A Creative Force and You Can Have What You Say. On a semantic level, these Christians combine a fundamentalist belief in the inerrancy of the Bible with a charismatic conviction that access to the Holy Spirit given to the born-again believer unites such a person with the ultimate source of truth. Believers do not regard themselves as interpreting sacred language, but rather gaining determinate understandings that can be shared by all who apply so-called 'spiritual' ears and eyes to sacred words. Such words are signifiers whose signifieds are supposedly assured in the context of the community of fellow evangelicals. The symbolic, ambiguous character of language is played down, just as it is denied that mere emotions can play any part in the perception of supernatural truth since they belong to 'the natural' (det naturliga) - the unpredictable, idiosyncratic world of mundane humanity which incorporates the fallible flesh and mind. As Ekman puts it: 'With [God's] eternal words in your Spirit you can't go wrong, because your mind is renewed. You think God's thoughts and only want what God wants' (Word of Life Newsletter, July 1984:1). Fenn argues (1982) that the language of liturgy can provide a last resort for 32</page><page sequence="5">problems of authority posed by ambiguities of human speech. Although much de pends on the relationship between speaker and hearer, the temporal and spatial boundaries of a church can create a closed linguistic garden of paradise (ibid.:ix-xv). Word of Life practice appears however to democratize and diffuse such authority, taking objective meaning beyond the boundaries of the church into the everyday life of the believer. An important aspect of this process is the belief in the concrete, tangible nature of language.5 Distinctions between the symbolic and the real, the metaphorical and the material become collapsed, as words are seen to take on many of the qualities of things. People talk of 'walking on the Word', as if it were a solid foundation for physical as well as spiritual support (cf. Forstorp 1990:161). It is said that to repeat sacred words is not to render them banal but rather to give them more potential to influence the world, as if one were accumulating quantities of a given resource. Frequently, also, statements of faith are literally objectified. Hand written or shop-bought signs are placed in houses or cars and perceived as protective devices.6 One Bible-school student described to me how she worked in a telephone sales firm, staffed entirely by fellow adherents. On the walls of the office were placed a series of notes with short phrases derived from the characteristic argot of positive confession - for instance 'I am more than a winner' and 'All I demand, in His name I have received.' These could be perceived as means of giving the self a supernaturally charged boost, thus adding to the success of the business. The Bible itself is also often regarded as a kind of talisman, a 'spiritual weapon', as many adherents put it, to be carried with them wherever they go. Weber of course noted how ascetic Protestant reformers were eager to discover intimations of God's grace and personal salvation in this world. All of life became a test of one's standing before a divine tribunal (Fenn 1982:47). However, groups such as the Word of Life illustrate how earlier concerns with salvation and self-denial have been transformed by many contemporary evangelicals into an equal or greater concern with self-realization in physical, economic and social, as well as spiritual, terms (cf. Lears 1983:4). Secular creeds of progress have combined with a shift from broadly Calvinist to more Arminian doctrines, with the latter giving the believer confidence to see salvation as potentially open to all, and the self as a representative of'the Word made flesh' (cf. Campbell 1987:108; 135). Perhaps the most striking example of how the Word is invested with physical qualities is evident in the way many Faith adherents describe the process of reading the Bible as a form of ingestion akin to eating. One can 'hunger' for or 'get filled' with the Word, while the following are the comments of a youth pastor in a sermon:7 Jesus said 'Our daily bread' and he meant it physically ... you can't desist from spiritual breakfast for a single day ... you'll come in to heaven like a spiritual bodybuilder ... God wants to give you spiritual nourishment, and when you're newly born you get milk ... when you grow you get a little bread ... but then when you've eaten for a sufficiently long time when God knows that you can eat... he gives you a real ox ... you go around like a giant ... like a Sumo wrestler, you become the biggest when you eat God's Word ? 33</page><page sequence="6">In this view, the text is embodied in the person, who becomes a walking, talking representation of its power. Eating is an especially powerful image because it evokes the notion of internalizing truth, bypassing the distorting effects of both social context and intellect, and ties in well with the common practice of memorizing as many Bible verses as possible. Ekman (1994:22) reinforces such ideas when he writes:8 In the same way as your outer person lives on food, so your inner person, the born-again part of you, lives off each word that comes from God's mouth? It means that God talks in your inner person and gives you a word or a picture of something that will come. God is depicted here as being able to communicate directly with the person through a language that can be physically appropriated. It is also signficant that the image invoked here is that of divine dictation rather than dialogue. Word of Life members, even students, are encouraged initially to consult God rather than other humans when puzzled about something they have read or heard, on the assumption that they will eventually understand the essential truth behind the words once they have been given supernatural aid. A member stated that if something is wrong in one's life one should not talk about it, but pray rather that divine force will help in changing the situation.9 Lecture notes of Bible students illustrate this attitude well: one student, for instance, has drawn arrows leading directly from God ('Gud') to a depiction of a human, implying the unmediated and hierarchical relationship between the two. Another writes exhortations to herself, using lecture notes not merely as a means of storing information, but also a form of positive self-confession. Employing a similar type of self-dictation, a teacher at the Word of Life Bible school talks in the following of her recovery from a serious car crash (Word of Life Newsletter, April 1985:6): I was so conscious of my inner person that I saw the body as a house that needed to be repaired. And ... I said to one part of the body after the other to begin to function: 'Leg, in the name of Jesus, walk! ... Hand, in Jesus' name, function! You are under God's blood! You are healed in the name of Jesus_V.. .We rule from the inside. We are in a position of rule over our body. We see here a vernacular version of the Pauline body as temple, but also the way collectively sanctioned language, having been internalized by the individual person, is externalized by that person to then act back on an undesired aspect of the self. The adherent learns to see her 'essential', ruling self as made up of Spirit and language, and in the process perceives herself as sufficiently separated from her body to view it as an object to be worked upon. Once healed, the body is no longer regarded as an alienating image of failure, but rather can be re-assimilated as a representation of the power of sacred language. Even the layout of the Word of Life hall where preaching takes place reinforces this sense both of the importance of language in worship and the sense that words are to be 'received' from God (often via preachers) rather than subjected to debate and multiple interpretation. Harold Turner (1979) describes how the great evangelical movements of the nineteenth century laid emphasis on the preaching of the word 34</page><page sequence="7">at the expense of the sacraments, and constructed buildings that enabled the closest possible encounter between the congregation and the message and personality of the preacher. This typically resulted in large, open platforms, allowing the preacher frequently to leave the shelter of the pulpit in order both to dramatize his perfor mance and interact directly with the listeners. In the main hall of the Word of Life, the most significant objects are the lectern, from which the sermon is preached, and the television cameras. The visual impact of the charismatic delivery, and perhaps even the seeming transparency of the message, are reinforced by the practice, present at the Word of Life and common in Faith congregations generally, of using perspex pulpits, actually allowing you to see directly through to the preacher even when he or she is standing behind it. The conventional celebration of communion is a rare, almost casual affair, and accordingly the sacramental table is not on permanent show in the hall. According to the logic of Faith ideology, such a communion is partially supplanted by the ingestion of the Word through preaching and reading, so that in a sense communion - union with Christ - is democratized and made constantly available by being collapsed within successful communication, a process which in the eating metaphor is remarkably similar to the actions of the Lord's Supper. Ideas about the relationship between the body and language illustrate connections between two core themes in Word of Life discourse: internalization of language as involving the unproblematic reception of the Word, and growth or healing as the automatic response to such ingestion (often after words are deployed and recon sumed by the same individual). Word of Life adherents seek to materialize the sacred not only within themselves, however, but also in their immediate environments. While bodies can be treated as objects, inanimate objects can possess the same relationship to supernatural principles as living humans. Thus, at an early stage in the construction of the group's new building in 1986-87, members of the group walked around its base, speaking tongues into the ground, thus appropriating the space for evangelical purposes.10 At the ceremony to open the building, all present recited the statement: Today, the believer is God's house,' again echoing Pauline imagery, as well as making the link between the body as temple and a building perceived as an organic manifestation of the power of sacred language. In a context where people and the material world provide visual evidence of the effects of divine force, Christ himself can be seen as the supreme example of the Word made flesh (the phrase 'Word of Life' is a reference to Jesus, from 1 John 1). Occasionally, Word of Life members talk of receiving visions of the living Christ in their dreams or waking lives. A vision of Christ, granted to the humblest of believers, can also apparently be used to confirm the truth of a text. Thus, a 10-year old girl states: When I was in the playroom Jesus came in. He shone as if a lamp had been lit? Only when the teacher read out the Book of Revelations in the Bible in school about how Jesus looked did I realize that it was actually written as I had seen him. 35</page><page sequence="8">Pictures of Christ located on paper or canvas are rare. In the hall where services take place, no such images, and not even a cross, are to be seen. Only on one occasion have I seen a painting of Christ publicly displayed at the Word of Life, and significantly this was merely a temporary decoration in an office corridor. Yet the painting is perhaps as close as one can get to an evangelical icon. A bearded Christ is shown, unfettered by a cross and staring directly at the viewer. He lifts his hands in exultation, displaying a youthful and heavily muscled torso. His whole body seems to be emerging, perhaps into the light from darkness, or at least exalting in physical and spiritual power. The picture recalls the youth pastor's image of the spiritual bodybuilder, as the viewer sees the results of verbal nourishment. Christ both constitutes the Word and indicates the physical effects of its internalization, with a body as firm and unambiguous in its boundaries as the apparently objective and objectified language of sacred speech and text. If, as Harre notes (1989), in bodybuilding one's physical form becomes a psychologically detached art object whose individual parts can be isolated and worked on according to rational principles, the picture and Word of Life believers as a whole display the same kind of attempt to subordinate nature, conceptualized as the flesh and the mind, to a calculating, quantifying faith. Underlying these attitudes is a kind of Foucaultian technology of the self (cf. Mansfield and McGinn 1993:52) whereby inner and outer states are objectified and monitored in order to maintain a socially-derived ideal.11 The result is the creation of a view whereby the Spirit and sacred language represent principles of collective faith and truth whose function is to colonize the rest of the person: it is as though the idea is to turn oneself into a living icon. The emphasis on presenting a powerful and positive image - the culture of display evident both in bodybuilding and the painting of Christ described above - is evident further in believers' body language. No matter how shabby one's home circumstances may be, it is considered important to present a successful face to others through smart clothes and a positive demeanour. As a self-exhortatory note written by a Bible student to herself in her lecture notes reads: 'Don't defend Jesus but let Him be seen in your life!' (here, Jesus is assimilated to the self and manifested in action). Such forms of representation have a similar ideological foundation as the use of words: by evoking the signs of a given state, that state may itself be made to occur. A claim on the world is being established through a form of visible, rather than purely verbal, 'positive confession'. For some, however, the rigidity of the group's insistence on a Goffmanesque presentation of an omni-competent evangelical persona becomes a source of con siderable inner conflict - one might say negative alienation from the iconic self image produced for one's own and others' consumption. An ex-Bible school pupil I interviewed abandoned her course, feeling unable to cope with the disjunction between her worsening physical condition and the ideology of the group. Other former pupils I spoke to had left, describing themselves as 'split', unable to reconcile a private inner-life of failure and self-reproach with the manufacture of an exterior 36</page><page sequence="9">image of happiness and success. In these cases, the division of the self between a Spirit (colonized by sacred language) and a partially alienated body or mental state proves unsatisfactory, not least as the body and the mind prove able to resist the rule and will of the divinity within the person. One ex-Bible-school student, who became disillusioned with the group, stated of Faith ideology: 4 One interprets it so that it's only through the Spirit one communicates with God ... And so the picture is that the Spirit is king, and the soul and the body are slaves.' In describing her unease with this authoritarian situation, she notes further: 'I felt resistance against the language,' highlighting even in her protest the importance of assimilating such language if commitment to the faith is to be achieved. Evangelical language and the mass media Having examined Word of Life theories of language in some detail, we are now in a position to focus on the affinities between such theories and the extensive use of the mass media by the group. Like many north American evangelicals, members propagate the view that the eternal truth of the Christian message is indicated by its easy adaptation to modern forms of mass media.12 In a Word of Life Newsletter (May-June 1987:5), Robert Ekh, the second pastor of the congregation, states: Video will be something big!... What is today's market square? The television!... God ... will come to people where they are. He will save them, heal and set them free in their living rooms! We've already received many reports about what those videos already produced have meant. Groups of up to 40 people have gathered in front of the television and had a meeting! In practice such novel means of spiritual communication are valued because they materialize words and experience in a very particular way. Central to such use of the media is the view that sacred words, as performative utterances capable of objective meaning, take on a semi-autonomous existence. Once recorded on tape, they retain their power to affect the material and spiritual world. The intense, physical effects that videos are supposed to have is expressed well by one of the most influential of the 'Prosperity' preachers currently working in Europe, Morris Cerullo:13 Open your heart, don't sit there and be a spectator ... let the truth and the revelation that flow from this message flow that they become seed and make you pregnant with the truth that God will give you supernatural provisions ? This time the word is supposed to enter the body not as nourishing food but through a supernatural form of procreation that leads to material and spiritual gain. Such media also have the advantage for evangelicals of providing a powerful means of resolving the tension between states of being and processes of becom ing as mutually contradictory embodiments of the divine. Videos fix the Word in physical, predictable, repeatable form yet also reproduce the appearance of inspired 37</page><page sequence="10">spontaneity. They provide a new way, complementary to that of sacred texts, of storing, transporting and scrutinizing language (cf. Goody 1977), but unlike writing retain a record of the original 'event' of verbal creation in time and space (cf. Ong 1991:75). The sacred words of the sermon and the service keep their place within the flux of evangelical experience while also offering the distant viewer or listener the opportunity vicariously to sample such experience. The excitement and sensuous quality of the oral and the visual are retained yet also objectified, made portable and removed from their original context of production but still regarded as capable of producing powerful responses in their consumers. The workings of such media have affinities with a religion whose roots, despite its stress on the centrality of the biblical text, lie in an oral, participatory culture. In adapting to the cassette and the video, evangelicals provide a potent combination of the pre- and the post-literate; a sort of mixture, as David Martin puts it (1990:165), of Levy-Bruhl and Marshall McLuhan. It may be that cassettes sold by the group have a similar function, albeit minus the visual dimension. Ekman at least has made the following claim:14 I had personally memorized hundreds of Bible verses, of which most weren't living for me, till one day I received a cassette with Bible teaching in the Holy Spirit's power. I became entirely free! The words I memorized earlier suddenly gained life within me and the life I had longed for, a life in victory and harmony, began to be realized for me. Here, the words of a cassette are made effective through this (literally) inspired quality, and in turn are able to animate those contained within the preacher. In the process of taping, words and actions are of course framed by the constraints of the material forms which contain them. If revivalist ritual is ultimately about the focussed dissemination of a message (cf. Harding 1987:169), videos and tapes extract the spiritually significant elements of the original event, editing out unnecessary distractions. Following Sontag (1977:3), one can remark that such technology renders experience into a mental object to be worked upon. The use of videos even opens up the possibility for ordinary participants to turn themselves into iconic objects of contemplation by being 'inscribed' into the official representation of a service. As participation is converted by the camera into the depiction of inspired worship (members of the audience, when filmed, are often speaking in tongues, praying, being healed, etc.), adherents are enabled to see themselves as embodying idealized, generic images of enthusiasm. Personal experience becomes collective representa tion, and moreover one that can be reconsumed by the person as they buy and watch a service in which they have taken part. Furthermore, the taping of services facilitates their rational classification as objects of knowledge (cf. Chaney 1993:99): when they are marketed, different tapes are presented as being particularly efficacious for different social, spiritual or physical problems, depending usually on the contents of the sermon. Such technology, then, has a kind of democratizing effect in the sense that ex periences are made widely if vicariously available (cf. Sontag 1977:7). The easy 38</page><page sequence="11">diffusion of divinely inspired messages in a video becomes a televisual counter part to the original Protestant reformers' concern to bring together a vernacular Bible and widespread literacy. At the beginning of many video tapes sold at the Word of Life, Ekman attempts to create the context of viewing with the following words: Before you go on I suggest you switch off the tape and take a moment, whether you're own your own, with your family, in a prayer-group or with your congregation, and pray that the Holy Spirit will lead you to the truth. It's important for you to expect that God will speak to you personally through His Word, that His Spirit will reveal itself to you. So the viewing of a video can theoretically become a consecrated act. The service can be relocated within individualized space and time, sanctifying the domestic context of the viewer or listener by permitting it to be permeated by the Word. The use of such videos of course varies, and some consumers treat them as ca sually as one would a Hollywood film. Yet they are also integrated for instance into 'cell-group' meetings - weekly gatherings of perhaps 10-15 believers. Among the testimonies I have seen or heard, one adherent compares their home-viewing with the experience of participating at the Bible school itself. To another person, a film involving intercession and healing has proved useful in promoting healing in their own living-room, so that the timing of the domestic attempt to apply spiritual power coincides not with the real event at the group but its image reproduced on the television screen. More broadly, the watching of videos has become the subject of a form of miracle discourse, ranging from personal self-realization, 'The video led [me] from defeat to victory,' to an appreciation of the transformation of language into images, 'Fine to see God's word in pictures.' Techniques of objectifying, disseminating and consuming images and words are repeated in minor ways by ordinary adherents. Participants commonly photograph services, for instance, while a former student at the Bible school explained to me how, as she fell asleep in bed, she would play tapes of her own prayers and readings back to herself. She thus indicated the ability both to exteriorize her own inspired words on tape and to reconsume these words - 'living' yet also objectified - as she listened to them again and again. (Parallels are evident here with the telephone sales rep encouraged by the positive confessions on her office walls, or even the woman healing herself through inspired language.) In contrast a former follower, writing negatively of his experience of faith practices, described how, whenever he attempted to pray, set phrases would appear in his mind like a motor set in motion (Swartling 1988:33-39). Here, the image of the machine seemed to have invaded his internal consciousness, and instead of providing access to a predictable source of inspiration was perceived as a form of disturbing self alienation. Instead of being able to re-appropriate and de-commodify the phrases by applying them to his present circumstances, he felt that they were appropriating him instead. 39</page><page sequence="12">To the woman described above, the use of tapes evoked a state of dynamic devel opment or 'becoming', despite their fixed form, because their use could constantly be adapted to changing circumstances. However, to the disillusioned former adherent, tapes had ceased to provide any sense of tapping into a dynamic source of power. His sentiments seem similar to those of adherents, mentioned earlier, who described themselves as 'split': the iconic, object-like nature of sacred language is perceived in such cases as a threat to the self, rather than helping to constitute it in a new way. As with the woman, a somewhat fetishistic attitude to language is displayed, ac cording to which a concretized linguistic form is given autonomous dynamic power (cf. Ellen 1988:219-23). However, the contrasting approaches to the objectification of sacred language evident in these two cases express in microcosm positive and negative forms of alienation offered by group practices. Miller (1987:12) sees objectification as 'a series of processes of externalization (self-alienation) and sublation (reabsorption) through which the subject of such a process is created and developed'. According to this view, consumption or sublation can act in positive ways, helping society to reappropriate its own external forms in a mutually constitutive process of develop ment. By way of contrast, the Marxist view sees objectification as a process whereby a product under conditions of estrangement becomes alien to its maker, taking on a reified external reality divorced from its origins of production (Miller 1987:39-44). From the cases discussed above, we see how adherents may indeed come to view their lives as positively transformed by the externalization and reabsorption of the performative effects of sacred language, not least as such language is brought to bear upon a range of different circumstances, taking on fresh resonances (therefore both constituting and being constituted by such circumstances). Such a reaction parallels the process described by Miller. On the other hand, adherents may be unable to see how circumstances are transformed in this way. Instead, the words and iconic images produced cannot be reabsorbed into a unified sense of self, and remain estranged from the desires and consciousness of the person. Conclusions My argument has been that contemporary evangelical practice extends and trans forms ritual practice through its use of the material culture of communication. Com menting on such televangelical practices, Horsfield (1984) comes close to accusing them of producing a form of fetishized Protestant sacramentality (cf. Goethals 1985: 149-53) in which idolatry is transformed into 'technolatry'. Horsfield's judgment is a product of his own denominational preferences but the point is still valid that videos and cassettes act like relics from other, older traditions, transcending spatial divisions by diffusing the sacred from centre to periphery. As with many relics, tapes are sanctified through their contact with a charismatic personality, retaining a kind of social substance in the form of their inspired words. 40</page><page sequence="13">In both, the authority of the personalities involved is enhanced through the apparent production of signs of divine approval. Just as a medieval pilgrim who reports a cure becomes a walking advertisement for the saint and the site in possession of their bones, so a modern viewer or listener who receives similar benefits will enhance the reputation of the preacher whose words are being replayed. However, with videos the connection established between object and believer is not merely the metonymic one of the relic but also a broader form of aural and visual reproduction. The lifelike nature of such reproduction is a key factor in implying instead a real, living presence to which the believer can respond. Community or even communion through communication is not seen as necessarily linked to spatial contiguity, given the supposedly performative power of words to reach a person's Spirit. In the Roman Catholic mass, of course, signifier and signified merge through mystical processes involving the manipulation of physical forms (bread and wine) as well as language (Ellen 1988:226). Here, the equivalent is performed with words alone, albeit words that take on many of the characteristics of objects. In their production and use, evangelical vehicles for sacred language can be com pared with objects drawn from very different ethnographic contexts. Tambiah (1984), for instance, describes how Thai amulets are seen as containing the sedimented presence and power of Buddhist saints. The process of sanctifying such objects involves them being impregnated with the sacred words of a holy figure. By circulating around the country, spreading the efficacious and protective energy of saints, amulets also help to bridge the gap between parochial and national traditions, thus reducing differences between religious centres and peripheries. Such objectification of sacred power echoes evangelical practices, not least in the way the charisma of individuals becomes converted into a more generic public good available for purchase, but important differences between the two traditions also exist. The look and form of amulets are important in their own right, not only because they depict holy figures but also because they can become precious items to be stored in a museum or private collection. Videos and cassettes, however, are not regarded as being aesthetically pleasing as objects, and derive their value merely from their function as the means to an end: the storing of words in the context of the replaying of a sacred event. Overall, we see how this attitude to the use of media and language produces a faith wherein believing does not appear to depend on belonging (cf. Davie 1990). Indeed, much contemporary conservative Protestantism encourages the attempt to create a translocal religious consciousness not tied to any particular institution or national culture (cf. Hoover 1988:150; 214). Both the participants at and the locations of services are rendered generic and usually easily able to be accommodated within the assumptions of the evangelical consumer, since watching a service on tape frames and focusses attention on the stage and stereotyped responses from the congregation. Even if one were not to understand the language being spoken, the images could pos sibly speak for themselves. Furthermore, at times the language videos and cassettes broadcast is not that of conventional speech but is rather glossalalia - a 'universal' 41</page><page sequence="14">means of representing inspired spontaneity without overt semantic meaning (cf. Csordas 1995:8). Electronic media can therefore help adherents to articulate a sense of place or belonging within a potentially infinite community of believers. Not only can they regard the whole world as a potential market for their products, but they can also come to regard their own actions as having far more than parochial significance. This attitude ties in well with other aspects of evangelical belief and practice. An essential part of Faith ideology is that each nation has a 'calling' both to convert its own citizens to the faith and to missionize on a global scale (cf. Coleman 1993). Every 'sender' of the evangelical message is therefore also a potential 'receiver' of it from elsewhere; the Word of Life regularly entertains north American preachers at its conferences (as well, increasingly, as preachers from other parts of the world), but Ekman as a 'worldwide man of God' also has a role to play in the USA, and so on. Apart from locating evangelical practice within a transnational narrative of sal vation, Faith ideology also appears to democratize divine power through making it accessible in domestic contexts. Indeed, this accessibility (combined with the stress on the need to monitor the self) makes Faith ideology appear to be a virtually omnipresent force. Since the body and Spirit of the person act as indices of one's spiritual state, a sense that all is not well in these areas of life might lead to a decision to leave the group. It might equally well encourage the believer to assume that they are being attacked by demonic forces - often personalized as 'spirits' of criticism or doubt - and therefore should redouble their efforts at collective worship and self monitoring. Even when adherents regard themselves as empowered by their faith and manipulation of sacred language, they are likely to think of such empowerment as a kind of decentering of the idiosyncratic self in favour of an externally-derived spiritual language that is part of them yet also has an autonomous existence. As Butler (influenced by Derrida) points out (1993:13), speech act theory might assume that a subject can produce a phenomenon through the act of naming, but performative utterances often rely for their apparent power on the fact that they are citations - formulae invoking an authority beyond the individual speaker. In speaking in tongues yet echoing phrases drawn from the glossalalia produced by Ekman, in 'demanding' worldly success in phrases derived from Word of Life preachers, and in surrounding themselves with sacred words contained in signs on the wall, books on the shelf, or videos on the television, believers gain spiritual sustenance but also reminders of the ubiquity of God and the authority of those who appear to embody his spiritual principles. Most importantly, the Faith notion that sacred words are signifiers whose meanings are fixed is served well by objectifying practices through which the possibility is largely removed of challenging 'official', collectively articulated depictions of sa cred experience by means of idiosyncratic responses. I am not arguing that the ideal of creating a translocal communion of Christians through the unproblematic, hypodermic-like broadcasting and reception of images and words is anything other 42</page><page sequence="15">than an ideal. However, evangelical beliefs and social arrangements undoubtedly lessen the possibility of mounting challenges to such an ideal from within the system. The Faith ideology of perfect consensus is reinforced by the perceived need to present an external, iconic image of the self which supposedly mirrors an equally controlled inner state. To participate in a service at the group itself is an experience not dissimilar to viewing it as a spectacle on the television screen in the sense that the responses of the congregation-cum-audience are mostly limited to conventional words of assent. Their reactions can be made even more predictable when safely recorded on tape. It is difficult, as Bloch (1974) notes in a well-known paper on the formalization of language in ritual, to argue with a song given that it has an inherent momentum built into its structure, but one might add that it is also pointless if the author and/or singer of the song is not even there to hear or respond. Beyond the group, in the living rooms of far-flung individual consumers, varieties of response are uncontrolled, but are given no voice, no representation in collective contexts unless they witness to the power of the mediated word and image. The creation of a distanced congregation, vicariously sampling its services, allows the Word of Life to maintain its reflexive presentation of a unified body of believers, whose sense of affiliation is extended to a community of the imagination located far beyond the borders of Uppsala. Notes * I should like to thank Danny Miller for encouraging me to send a paper to Etnofoor. Some of the issues discussed here are raised in a different paper produced for The Journal of Material Culture, 1995, 1(1). In addition, Leslie Carlin helped me with some of the final word processing of the paper, for which I am grateful. 1. Of course, evangelicals have been engaged in missionary work throughout their existence. However, the current revival has taken advantage of vastly improved systems of communi cation. 2. Radio has long been used by evangelicals. Carey (1992:16-17) notes how in nineteenth century U.S.A. the railway and morse code were both interpreted by some Christians as divinely inspired means of spreading the Gospel. 3. In Sweden, Christians who have been trained in 'Faith' Bible Schools have often gone back home and attempted to influence 'traditional' congregations, with results varying from tolerance to angry rejection. More generally, some preachers, such as Robert Schuller of the Reformed Church in America, is part of a mainstream denomination but preaches 'prosperity' doctrines. 4. Word of Life beliefs and practices form a powerful package that presents charismatic Christianity as a paradigm for anti-institutionalization on personal, religious and political levels in contemporary Sweden. The notions of empowering the self, as well as exercising personal responsibility for one's physical and financial state, can easily be read as criticisms of paternalist forms of Social Democracy that have been dominant in the country over the past 60 years. The radicalism of the group's message, on personal and political levels, appeals particularly to the young and those in early middle-age, though older people may also see the Faith Movement as taking up the mantle of revival seemingly abandoned by the previously vigorous but increasingly compromised Free Churches. 43</page><page sequence="16">5. During services, congregations collectively direct tongues towards written prayer requests that are held up on stage for all to see. Such verbal utterances are often accompanied by the pointing of the hand, as though words could act like arrows with magical powers (cf. Tambiah 1968), affecting the lives of those Christians linked to the prayer requests. Here, we see glossalalia implying an apparent detachment of linguistic utterances from its semantic moorings, combined with the stress on vocalization as a bodily act (Csordas 1995: 7). Yet we also see how on such occasions the lack of overt meaning does not descend into an entirely chaotic interpretative Babel. Rather, language is granted an object-like force, and deployed collectively in order to transform an undesired situation. 6. Parallels can be drawn here with other faiths, in particular those that have a bias against anthropomorphic representation. According to Starrett (1995:53), labourers and shop keepers in Cairo attribute the protective value of displaying or carrying Koranic verses to the latters' innate power as utterances of God (cf. also Graham 1987:61). 7. Tour Keys to Your Bible Reading': Word of Life Cassette No. LOS10, 1991. 8. In Magazines 1994, No. 7, p. 22. 9. By way of contrast, note how the liberal Christians in Sweden that Stromberg (1986) and Forstorp (1990) study accept, even welcome, the relevance of human participation in the interpretation of shared language. Sacred language is therefore seen as engaging in a mutually constitutive dialogue with the person, gaining power and resonance from its ability to blend with and therefore 'comment on' individual experience. Such a view clearly contrasts in ideal typical terms with the evangelical notion that such language forms a fixed canon of truth whose purpose is to dictate to, even assimilate, the idiosyncrasies of the speaker. 10. The construction is not only very large, it is also unlike the architectural styles of con ventional churches. Nevertheless, it blends easily into its immediate environment, that of an industrial zone on the periphery of the city, and evokes the classic modernist style of sustaining a limited number of ideas throughout a massive space. It also corresponds in visual terms with some of the assumptions of Faith ideology. The 'beauty' of the building lies for evangelicals both in its size and in the way it expresses ideals of maximum efficiency in the spreading of the group's message. It is a fitting container of state-of-the art communications technology, a technology whose presence not only indicates material success but also allows the Word to be broadcast to unprecedentedly large numbers of people. 11. It might seem that some of these ideas are likely to have particular resonances in Sweden, given that ethnologists have traced the processes whereby powerful notions of disciplining the body and the will have emerged in the country since the late nineteenth century (Frykman 1987). However, equally or more important are north American influences - those which assert the virtues of youth and the power of personal will over physical matter through positive thinking. 12. Some north American preachers even argue that the invention of satellites was predicted in the Book of Revelations, while a Californian televangelist has called his satellite dish the 'holy beamer' (Elvy 1986:19, 64). 13.
