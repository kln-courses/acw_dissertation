<plain_text><page sequence="1">82. AN EGYPTIAN STATUETTE OF BAST. T HE Museum has received the generous gift of a figure of the goddess Bast from Lady Juliet Duff (P1. XLII). In general appearance it belongs to the usual type of fayence seated statuettes of this goddess, assigned to the XXIInd Dynasty--a type character- ized by the decoration on the sides of her throne. There are regularly represented snakes and snake-deities (among whom Nehebka is prominent while others are from the Underworld), together with cat- and lion-headed anthropomorphic figures, and one or other of the divinities associated especially with women (of whom Bast her- self was one). It is, however, very much larger than the rest of its class, and is made of glazed sandstone, not fayence, as they com- monly are. This technique is interesting, more especially as there is a consider- able space between the body and the slender upper arms, which must have demanded great skill on the part of stone-cutter and glazier. But what makes the figure probably unique is the novel method of constructing the head. This consists of a bronze face (including the ears) attached to the 'ruff' (properly of Sekhmet) and wig which are part of the solid figure of the goddess. The face itself was evidently hollow, for gold foil was inserted behind the eye-sockets before the bronze was filled with a core which now keeps P IOI</page><page sequence="2">the gold pressed in position. There are signs that the shape of the pupils was lightly indicated (in repousse) on the gold; that the surface was treated so that the centre should appear brighter than the sur- rounding parts is almost certain, judging from the present effect. The result, effective to-day, would have been singularly cat-like with the addition of the crystal inlay, now lost, which must originally have been set in the deep sockets. The colour of the glaze is very good and gains from being spread over a wider surface than is usually available in glazed objects of this period. The base of the figure has been hollowed-probably in modern times, to hold a socket-up to a point a little below the level of the knees. This has caused the figure to break in two at this point, but it has been so skilfully mended as to make it almost im- possible in places to trace the break. Height Io-6 inches (26.5 cm.); No. 63516.
