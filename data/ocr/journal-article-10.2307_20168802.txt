We learned something of the ritual conducted by the Druids; the bare fact that the Gauls wor shipped five chief gods called by Caesar, Mercu ry, Apollo, Mars, Jupiter and Minerva; and the additional fact that the Gauls considered them selves offspring of the common father, Dis.1 Other Classical authors called Caesar's Dis "Dispater/' Dis the father, all in one word. Caesar's writing represented the sum total of human knowledge regarding paganism in Gaul until the commencement of scientific excavations of ancient rites and subsequent study of epi graphical and iconographie evidence. Only re cently has it been possible to form any concep tion of the physical forms which the Gauls, in large part under Roman stimulus, gave to their gods. For apparently before the conquest the Gallic deities lacked anthropomorphic crystal lization, a state of affairs incomprehensible to Caesar but highly desirable in our opinion. The extraordinary bronze here illustrated (figs. 1, 2) is a Gallic archaeological relic which has been said to represent Dispater.2 Far from being unknown, it was the cause of one of those violent archaeological quarrels which lent color to nine teenth-century intellectual society. During the controversy it was inaccessible to most of the scholars who discussed it and since that time its whereabouts have been unknown. It therefore seems advisable to republish it now. It is a large bronze, 1714 inches tall, consist ing of three parts: a base, a statuette, and a rod surmounted by a cylinder. From the cylinder five spokes project like spokes from the hub of a wheel, and each spoke ends in a small spool-like object. The effect of the half wheel appearing over the head of the statuette is indeed startling. The statuette is a male figure wearing an ani mal's skin on his head; the forepaws are tied on i De Bello Gallico, VI, 17-18. 2 Walters Art Gallery, no. 54.998.

The weight of the man's body is supported by the right leg, and the right hip is pushed far to the side. His left leg is relaxed, with the knee slight ly bent, and extended backward and to the side, with the toe alone touching the ground. The right elbow is bent and the hand stretches for ward to hold an olla, a kind of small jar. The left arm is raised and the hand is contracted to grasp something now lost. The man is sturdy and his muscles are clearly delineated, but there is no over-development. In pose and proportion the figure might be classed as a later version of a Polykleitan athletic type. The costume reminds one of Hercules, who ha bitually wore the skin of the Nemean lion to cover his head, but this is a wolf's skin. The face is reminiscent of Jupiter, or, better still, of that peculiar deity who emerged from Egypt and sometimes was equated with Jupiter, Sarapis. The brows and cheeks are broad and calm and the realistically treated eyes fail to convey an impression of great cerebral activity. The human hair is almost concealed by the wolf's skin, but we can see a lock of hair rising sharply at each side of the center and undulating side wards. The moustache turns up in spirals at the ends, as is the case with some late types of Ju piter and with Sarapis almost always. The beard is parted near the center and billows forward in two degrees. This arrangement is quite typical of Jupiter and Sarapis. This bronze was one of four pieces excavated in a Roman lararium at Vienne, Is?re, France, in 1866. It was announced in various publications immediately. A line drawing was made and was re-used frequently (fig. 3). In the drawing, a tall rod is held by the left hand. Flouest made the first serious and detailed study in 1885, and in terpreted this figure as Gallic Jupiter, or Celtic FIGURE 3 WALTERS ART GALLERY Deity called Dispatcr of the Gauls (after drawing in Reinach) Jupiter, or Dispater, with his usual attribute,the hammer, amplified into a huge hammer with five smaller hammers attached. His fellow country man, Bazin, denounced Flouest and his identifi cation. Mallet gods, in general, he considered to 87</page><page sequence="5">THE JOURNAL OF THE WALTERS ART GALLERY represent Silvanus. He claimed that our figure was a simple Hercules, to which foreign items had been added, chief of them being a horizontal attachment for lamps. Flouest replied to this at attack, reiterating his original contention, and published his first paper as a separate monograph before withdrawing from the fray. The next publication was by Salomon Rein ach, in the catalogue of the collection of bronzes in the museum at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, in 1894. Included in this collection is a telling ob ject, a damaged attribute like the one at the back of our statuette. The supporting rod, the central cylinder, and five spokes and two small cylinders remain. It was found at Vienne in 1874. The Saint-Germain museum and Reinach's catalogue also included casts of similar figures, of which the originals were to be found in other museums. Finally, Reinach republished the familiar line drawing of our bronze and illustrated and listed other objects of which no casts existed, and dis cussed the whole subject of gods with hammers, usually called Dispater. Reinach's long reperto ry included only one other free-standing figure holding a hammer; hammers are assumed for all figures with their left hands uplifted and pierced to grasp something; the basis for the assumption is a long series of relief carvings. Reinach point ed out that the nudity of our particular figure is exceptional, differentiating him from the usual Sarapis and from the usual mallet deity.- He de rived the physical characteristics of this mallet deity (whom he calls Dispater in his headings but not in his text) in large part, but not exclu sively from Sarapis. The basket on the head which this deity frequently adopts in imitation of Sarapis shows that he has some nether con nections. According to Reinach, the mallet which some authorities interpreted as a weapon is, in origin at least, a fetish. The very incon clusiveness of Reinach's summary is, for our generation as for his own, a virtue. By this time our bronze was famous. When Walters and Murray published the British Mu seum bronzes they acepted this piece as an im portant document on Gallo-Roman bronze work ing and they did not doubt its homogeneity. They interpreted the fancy attribute as five ham mers attached to a barrel. Walters mentions our piece as one of several remarkable bronzes with the barrel and hammer attribute.3 He considered a basket on the head and a jar in the hand to be the distinguishing attributes of Dispater, and the hammer to be but an additional feature. In dis cussing Ogmios or Gallic Hercules he remarked upon the similarity of types of Ogmios and Dis pater, but he did not suggest that our piece was an Ogmios. Murray made the observation that the barrel could be used for wine, and that the barrel which he saw in the attribute of our figure could connect our deity with wine production, as was suitable in a wine area. Indeed, works of art of all types indicate that in Gaul barrels were used for storing wine in preference to the pottery jars favored in Italy and Greece.4 At the end of the nineteenth century Bertrand wrote the first and only definitive book on the religion in Gaul as a whole.5 He placed all the small statues of gods and goddesses that we know late in the history of Druidical religion, a religion which was not essentially anthro pomorphic in character. He minimized the importance of the statuettes, viewed in the light of the complete history of France. Our statuette (he could not omit it!) was illustrated once more, and classified as a Roman type of deity, Jupiter, to which had been added the Celtic symbol, the mallet. Bertrand pointed out 3 H. B.

He agreed with Reinach that Dispater was repre sented after the model of Sarapis, and habitually shown draped, wearing modius, and holding olla and mallet; but he skillfully avoided men tioning our bronze at this point, and so gives no answer to the question: is our exceptional figure really Dispater? Finally, in 1912, came the sale catalogue of the John Edward Taylor collection, with a photograph (the only one ever published) of the statuette on its base, but taken without the rod in the hand and the attribute at the back. The catalogue entry stated that the object had been acquired for the Taylor Collection at the Wills sale in 1894. Mr. Henry Walters bought it at the Taylor sale. The rod had disappeared from the left hand before he bought it, or at least be fore he had it photographed. The present study is the first publication since its acquisition by the Walters Collection, and consists primarily of physical examination of the object, something that has been impossible for a long time. All three parts are to a large degree covered with a stony brownish coating, and all have a few bright green spots. The consistent coloring makes it probable that the parts were buried to gether. The rod which supports the ornament is broken off just above the base, but since upper and lower sections of the rod are of the same diameter, there is no reason to suppose that the parts do not belong together. Although some of the spokes may have been replaced, the orna ment, consisting of the five ''hammers' ' seems to be a whole. The rod has been inserted into the largest hammer (or barrel) through a broken piece of hollow rod which is firmly attached to the cylinder. This fact suggests that a piece of the rod is missing or concealed, and that originally the rod was longer and the ornaments higher above the base. There is no possibility that the object was made to hold lamps, as Bazin said. The attachment of the statuette to the base has been achieved by modern screws and nuts. Even a hasty glance reveals that the statuette is very small for this base. Actually, there are two old holes in the base, each a little farther from the center than the existing feet. They could have been used for the attachment of a larger figure, and it need not have been in the same position. An iron rust stain on the base, in front of the left foot, looks as if it had been formed around the right foot of a larger figure, attached by its toe to one of the holes, and pointing cross wise of the present foot (fig. 4). So much for the evidence of the hammer and the base. Now, what of the pose of the figure? There must have been a hammer in the left hand. But if there was a hammer in the hand, why should a whole collection of hammers tower above the figure? And so it seems to me probable that originally (Continued on p. 100) FIGURE 4 WALTERS ART GALLERY Deity called Disjnter of the Gauls (Detail of lower parts) 89</page><page sequence="7">DISPATER OF GAUL (Continued from p. 89) there was a larger statuette on this base. It may have been very like our figure, with a nude ath letic body, a wolf's skin, an olla, and a face like Jupiter-Sarapis. On the other hand, it may have been clothed. To find its place, we would pivot the present figure a little more than 90 degrees to its left, so that the hammer ornament would be based in front of the left foot. The large deity's left hand would grasp the lengthened rod which supports the hammers. The figure now present should be mounted on a smaller base and provided with its own hammer?pos sibly the hammer ornament, part of which is still preserved in Saint-Germain, or possibly the hammer the stem of which appears as a rod in the old illustrations. The consistent coloration of base, figure and hammer ornament makes it probable that the two pieces were buried to together and excavated together. The original re port that a lararium was excavated explains the presence of two on the same spot. There still is no proof of the identity of the deity involved. Any faith in the identification as Dispater which is based upon the presence of the hammer is no longer justified. Yet the pos sibility is great that we are dealing with Dis pater, ancestor of the Gauls, but with frag ments of two representations of him instead of one. 100</page></plain_text>
