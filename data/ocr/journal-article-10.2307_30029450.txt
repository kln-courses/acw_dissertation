<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DOMAIN POSTURE Gordon W. Hewes University of Colorado Some of the domains of meaning waithwhich Ethnoscience deals are universal, in the sense that they can be expected to occur in some form in all cultural systems, irrespective of local environment or level of technology. Others are more or less restricted in their occurrence, such as the semantic fields involving money, wheeled vehicles, or microscopic organisms. The domain posture, encompassing the ways in which people stand, sit, kneel, squat, and the like, is probably a language universal, as are kinship and color taxonomies. The domain posture is closely related to those for body parts, movements, and expressions, all of which are assumed to be universal. Pre- sumably it is as important to know how people in various cultural and linguistic environments organize the realm of human body positions as it is to know how they have structured the realms of kinship, color, or plant life., Postures are exhibited by human beings at all times and places, and some sort of posture is an inseparable feature of a human being not only throughout life, but after death for as long as the body or even the skeleton remains intact. It seems unlikely that there is any human group capable of effective functioning in the real world which does not describe postures in systematic fashion, for example, that an individual is standing rather than lying down, sitting rather than crouching. The lexemes used for human body positions may also be regularly applied to non-human animals having roughly similar bodies and limbs, and employed metaphorically to describe positions of inanimate objects and abstract entities -- perhaps another instance of language universality. 2 Nevertheless, postural terminologies have seldom been elicited by linguists or ethnographers, and scholarly material relating to postural habits is scattered over a dozen different disciplines, and for all practical purposes has never been assembled for scientific analysis. Portions of the domain have received attention, to be sure, notably from anatomists and physiologists, physical educatorf, dance specialists, painters and sculptors, archaeologists, psychologists, 3 and psychiatrists. Ritual postures have attracted the serious attention of theologians. Two major efforts to devise notational systems for postures (along with body movements and gestures) are those of R. Laban5 and R. Birdwhistell.6 Neither is wholly satisfactory. Workers in kinetics, physiology of body move- ment, orthopedic medicine, time and motion studies, etc., have likewise failed to develop workable terminologies. 7 The domain as a whole typically lacks a name . Posture in ordinary English usage has strong normative connotations, and unsophisticated subjects tend to associate it with physical 106</page><page sequence="2">The Domain Posture 107 education and with the formal attention stance. Pose, attitude, 8 body position, and their counterparts in other languages have been used to name the domain, but before effective communication can begin it is usually necessary to provide a gloss: 'the ways that people stand, sit,, kneel, squat, lie down, and so on'. Uncertainty over the scope of the domain and its name is probably significant. Weinreich 9 has noted that only some areas of ordinary language are marked by a degree of terminologization. Certain fields are more amenable to taxonomic gystematization than others. As we shall see, posture is perhaps less favorable for logical analysis than such fields as kinship or color terms, but more so than many other possible domains of universal occurrence. The number and complexity of discriminable human postures precludes any really simple or concise terminology. The human body with its fourteen or more independently movable segments can generate a vast number of different postures, although no actual cultural system finds it worthwhile to devise labels for all of these possibilities. There is reason to suppose that some cultural systems make use of richer postural vocabularies than others, thanks to the presence of more elaboration in the sphere of ceremonialismn or formalized interpersonal etiquette. The writer suspects, without having real evidence, that Sanskrit had a richer postural vocabulary than English. It is equally likely that Classical Maya had a richer postural terminology than modern Maya. Postural states, which result from modifications of the position of the major segments of the human body, can be expected to form a connected set, with the body as the consistent element. Recognition of the fact that various postures are spatial modifications of the body constant presumably long preceded the emergence of human language. Higher mammals seem to be quite capable of identifying the individuals in their own or in some other species in spite of radical alteration in posture or movement. The adaptive utility of such a cap- ability is fairly obvious. Moreover, particular postures are employed as signals or signs for important biological functions or states. It is hardly surprising that human beings should respond to postural cues in others, or that postures are everywhere matters of ceremonial concern, or at least never a matter of total cultural indifference. The semantic field of posture, though normally mediated through vision, also has kinesthetic dimensions. Postures can be perceived by touch. However, received, information about the postures of other individuals probably sets up some degree of kinesthetic reverberation in the recipient individual, although the writer is unaware of psychological research on this topic. If this be true, postural perception may lie closer to such biological fundamentals as color, smell, and other dimensions of the physical and biological world, than to the cultural levels such as kinship. Scientific, as opposed to folk-taxonomies of posture, are not marked up to now by logical consistency, hierarchical ordering, or absence of ambiguity. Prost, a physical anthropologist, recently commented that the scientific class- ification of posture and locomotion 'is in disorder' . 10 He then proceeded to organize the domains of posture and locomotion operationally, separating posture from locomotion, and both from what he termed 'dextrous activity'.</page><page sequence="3">108 Anthropological Linguistics, Vol. 8, No. 8 Prost held that posture and locomotion could not occur simultaneously, although an organism must be in either one condition or the other from birth to death. He neglected the prenatal postures of the fetus, and the possibility of post-mortem postural states which could, in fossil skeletal form, endure virtually indefinitely. Locomotion Prost defined as displacement of the center of gravity of the body, whereas posture was 'that organic activity which occurs while the summary displacement of the body mass is less than threshold value'. No provision is made for passive body movement which could occur in free falling, or when the body is moving on such devices as skates or skis. Dextrous activity involves only small displacements, such as hand movements. To the writer, 'dextrous' is so linked to manual movement that it is probably inadmissible as a general term. Movements of facial muscles hardly seem 'dextrous'. An elaborate postural taxonomy limited to the species Homo sapiens would be of restricted usefulness in comparative studies, nor should a postural classification be so tied to actual human anatomy or physiology that it could not serve for the analysis of postural representations - in sculpture, painting, etc. -- where proportions were not altogether realistic. Studies of the postures of ancient figurines, or those shown in other ancient works of art can provide time perspective in cross- cultural comparisons not otherwise available. 11 Since the human body or a reasonable facsimile thereof may be regarded as a mechanical system of movable parts with finite possibilities of angular displacement, a culture-free etic coding of all possible human postures is possible, though perhaps difficult of achievement. A certain amount of work can be carried on without an adequate coding, but the lack of a standardized terminology soon becomes awkward. 12 A precise coding system based on zero starting points at each major joint, and angular measurements, would probably become necessary eventually, but an extended discussion of the possibilities of such a system does not belong in a symposium on Ethnoscience. The modest aim of the present paper is to set forth some highly tentative and preliminary notions about the domain posture among speakers of American English. Although I collected data from a larger number, the results summarized here are based on the responses of only fourteen individuals, all university students, who happened to completely fill in a 101-item test or questionnaire. Before my results could have statistical significance, the sample size would have to be considerably increased, and the stimulus items would probably have to be much more carefully chosen, statistically randomnized, and so forth. Ideally, subjects in such an investigation should report on postures of living subjects, but for several reasons line drawings of human figures were used, although they were traced from photographs and can be regarded as fairly accurate anatomically. Admittedly, two-dimensional line drawings are subject to misinterpretation; one subject responded to a picture of a standing figure with the phrase 'lying down' - a mistake wholly unlikely had he been observing a live model. The illustrations were drawn from a diversified sample of ethnographic sources, travel magazines, and miscellaneous photographs, with the full realization that they represented only a tiny fraction of the range of human posture. Creation of a balanced sample, given the woeful state of current cross-cultural information</page><page sequence="4">The Domain Posture 109 in this field, would have been impossible. The best that can be said of the illustrations is that they ranged from several very common postures observable in everyday American life to some which the subjects regarded as bizarre or exotic. The 101st item, introduced as a tension reducer and not in final position in the sequence, was of a chimpanzee standing bipedally. The drawings, four to eight on a page, and more or less scrambled so that sitting or standing postures were scattered rather than grouped, were presented with only numerical ident- ifications, and, as far as possible, without clothing, artifactual, or other cultural cues. The subjects classified the illustrations as follows, according to majority judgments (i.e., eight or more agreements out of fourteen responses): 1. standing - 20 2. kneeling - 6 3. squatting - 10 4. sitting - 44 5. reclining - 2 6. lying - 8 7. on all fours or crawling - 1 8. crouching or bending - none 9. diverse, no agreement - 10 Category 4, sitting, was further subdivided by the writer into sitting on floor or ground, 29, and sitting on chair, stool, or other raised object, 15, although this distinction was not made by many of the respondents. The usual terminology for the illustrated postures consisted of a single lexeme such as sitting or squatting, or such terms followed by one or more modifiers such as: on the floor, in a chair [locational], with legs crossed, with knees together [further description of body parts], and more rarely, shooting with a bow, or hurling a spear [functional]. A few remarks were inappropriate, at least as responses to the instructions, which were to describe the illustrated posture briefly: sorrowful, uncomfortable, unusual, and, in one case, impossible. Quite unexpectedly, one subject correctly identified a yoga posture (the Lotus position) as padmasana. Altogether, there was considerable intersubjective agreement - greater than that for a series of body movement terms in English reported by Weinreich.13 If the protocols of those who were unable to complete the experiment had been used, this degree of agreement would have been somewhat reduced, to be sure. Using this rather loosely structured experiment, but also the experience of several years in working over materials on postural habits from a variety of sources, I have ventured to construct a componential diagram for American English posture terms (Figure 1). The incomplete portions on the left and right sides of the diagram suggest that posture is part of a superdomain covering various physically observable body states, such as body-movement and gesture or expression. The cross-cutting symmetrical/ asymmetrical dichotomny has been imposed by the writer, and was not developed from the responses of the experimental subjects. It seems plausible in view of the bilateral symmetry of the human body which permits one set of bilaterally symmetrical postures, and another of asymmetrical ones, in which left side parts may be in different relative positions than right side parts</page><page sequence="5">110 Anthropological Linguistics, Vo1.8, No. 8 asymmetrical symmetrical on head, shoulders, or hands at attention othe r with support bent or crouching on heels legs crossed to right to left knee, leg, or ankle crossed. legs together legs I apart on soles of feet on toes reclining - partly supported on side on back (supine) on stomach (prone) on all four s crawling position BODY MOVEMENT POSTURES FACIAL EX PRESSION, GESTURE STANCES SITTING, KNEELING, SQUATTING LYING DOW N QUADRU- PEDAL Kneeling "Sittirng Squat- ting Upright, Erect on floor, on ground legs -out on chair, stool; bench, etc. on both knees tightly flexe d semii flexed] ex- tendedI 3n one knee -tigure i</page><page sequence="6">The Domain Posture 111 Three-dimensional elaborations of the diagram are possible, but in dealing with problems of the morphology of flexible, irregular bodies one quickly reaches the limits of usefulness for formalized orthogonal diagrams. Workers in biological taxonomy typically employ detailed and highly realistic pictures of the organisms with which they deal, if not actual type- specimens . Generalized charts, keys, and similar abstract representations never wholly replace realistic representations and actual specimens. Although geologists and geographers also employ charts and tables, they too continue to use maps and cross-sections which are small-scale but isomorphic models of the highly complex forms with which they deal. Human anatomy whether at the gross or microscopic level also still depends to a large extent on realistic representations of structures. The recent development of computers capable of both display and analysis of complex graphics - including orthographic and other pro- jections of three-dimensional solids - suggests that the communicative 14 power of pictures has not been entirely superseded by numerical representation. The domain posture in English, and probably in other languages, is discontinuous, and does not lend itself to the class-product treatment suitable in some other taxonomies. Abrupt breaks and branchings are present; body postures cannot be arranged on a specturm, or in any simple unilinear fashion. A thorough analysis of the English postural terminology would doubtless re- veal some islands of precise terminologization, clustering around specialized activities such as choreography, certain athletic sports, particular rituals such as close-order military drill, and the like. The highly formalized equestrian art of dressage, gymnastics, and fencing, would form such islands of precise postural terminology. Classical ballet would be another instance There are few postures which are prescribed or proscribed with legal sanctions in American culture, but they would include the standing posture required in a courtroom when the judge enters or leaves (violations can be punished summarily as contempt of court), and certain postures in sexual intercourse which are forbidden in the legal codes of most American states, though they are described only in testimony or evidence, and not in the codes themselves. Our small sample of American English speakers did not consistently separate squatting from kneeling, as some languages may, nor was there any agreement as to postures which might be classified as crouching, stoolpn_, or s.ending (over). Although the writer feels as a result of lengthy preoccupation with the problem of postural classification that ground-sitting ought to be differentiated from chair (etc.) -sitting, his subjects did not think so, and the seemingly discrete actions of chair-sitting and floor-sitting were muddled. The polysemy of sitting is in contrast to the ambiguity of kneeling and squatting, which tend to overlap. It could be added that while stand, sit, and lie are frequently employed in anthropomorphic metaphors, squat and kneel are not, although squat may function as an adjective for something both low and unattractive. Future work on postural terminology should certainly include investigation of taxonomies in languages other than English and a broad study of the applications of anthropomorphic postural metaphors. It is possible that a comparative study of folk-taxonomies of posture might help in the development of a workable scientific terminology. Some of our more successful scientific terminologies are in fact expansions of folk-taxonomies, having at their core the lexemes o:f Latin or Greek.</page><page sequence="7">112 Anthropological Linguistics, Vol. 8, No. 8 NOTES 1.
